make a way with every situation and it it seems hard sometimes but we believe the word above our feelings amen amen amen God bless you today we really appreciated Wednesday's service with brother Mark I'll say if anybody has did not hear that go back and listen to that I just thought a good word for the church um today if you would like to turn with us to the Book of John chapter 10 we know there's a Super Bowl today and uh we want to talk about the supersonic voice of God today amen I want to entitle this message following the word and for a subject knowing the spirit that you're following amen before we read let's look to the author of this precious book Heavenly Father we stand here in need of the great Holy Spirit to come down you authored the word you give understanding of the word you give revelation of the word and Lord we are depending upon you today Lord we've we've prayed we've studied the Saints have prepared their hearts and they have come into your house with an expectation they're ready for you Lord and now God our dependency is upon you that you break the bread of life to us that you'd show us out of these scriptures Lord where we need to be where you would have us to be where we can find you in your will take this word Lord and let it let it become a part of each of Our Lives Lord we commit ourselves in this time into your hands that's your blessings on the reading of the word now for each one of us we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Saint John chapter 10 starting with verse number one verily verily I say unto you he that entereth not by the door of the Sheepfold but clineth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he that in Earth in by the door to the is The Shepherd of the Sheep and to him the Porter openeth and the Sheep heareth his voice and he called his own Sheep by name and leadeth them out and he puteth forth his own sheep he goeth before them and the Sheep follow him for they know his voice and his stranger will they not follow but will flee from him for they know not The Voice of strangers this Parable spake Jesus onto them but they understood not what things they were which he spake unto them then said Jesus onto them again verily verily I am I say unto you I am the door of the Sheep amen amen in verse 11 now I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the sheep and God bless you may be seated now back in the day the Shepherds would go to a pen where all the Sheep were mixed together and what it was is that there wasn't a lot of different areas so they would make these pens big enough for a number of shepherds sheep so all the sheep that were in this pen did not belong to one Shepherd and then each of the Shepherds would come up to the door or to the gate and he would call the Sheep by name he would say things that were by the Sheep knew that this was our Shepherd the Sheep recognized the voice of their Shepherd and they came out of the pen and then the shepherd would take these sheep and he would lead them into the place that the shepherd wanted them to go to for pasture and things and the illustration here is that there is um a an awareness between the sheep and the shepherd there's a distinct awareness there and um it wasn't even really matter so much uh what the shepherd was wearing the attraction was to The Voice and there was a tight connection between the two the sheep can tell the difference between the voices of the different Shepherds the Good Shepherd is Jesus Christ the voice of the Good Shepherd is his word it's not a feeling it's not an emotion it's simply the word of God we are his sheep and even this morning here at church we are in the pen we are in the pen and the shepherd is here speaking to his sheep and he is calling us out to go he's calling us out of the world to go where he's leading us to and it's all individual it's all it's all individual now we're we're going into a Rapture so ultimately that's where he's calling us too brother Brandon said God put something inside of his own that will recognize him he placed something there and when the hour comes he calls and they will come out of whatever they're doing to follow the voice which is the word of God Jesus said no man can come to me except the father draws him first so there's an appointed time for the call but the brand said in the message leadership and if the word of God is in you from the foundation of God in you he said my sheep hear my voice they know my hour a stranger will they not follow see it's got to be that first and all that the father has given me they will come every one of them see sir amen it's just like every seed brings forth of its own kind God placed something inside of his own which is a part of God Amen there are a lot of people who follow their emotions their feelings their senses some follow signs and miracles and wonders some follow their own understanding their own ideas their own knowledge and oftentimes they think it's God but only the Sheep only his sheep the Sheep of God recognize his voice that's right it's the word of God they recognize the importance of the word this is God to them not what their feelings say because their feelings could be contrary look Peter's feelings was contrary to the word you can't go by feelings the word is his voice to who the Sheep to the Sheep amen the word is the voice to a sheep it trumps feelings you've all played cards before right and there's something that trumps something else right right and many card games and the word of God trumps our feelings Trump's emotions it trumps signs that Trump's understanding the word is personal to them and they follow the word no matter what no matter how they feel no matter what they think no matter what they understand they follow the word that's why Church order is important because it's the word everyone is following someone another Brandon asked this question in the message leadership he says but now who leads you that's the question now we're all led by something tonight we have to be we're LED we're all following someone we could be following our wife we could be following her husband we could be following a close friend a certain author we could be we could have a favorite minister we're all following someone everyone is following someone and behind that someone is a voice and behind that voice is a spirit and there are only two spirits the spirit of error and the spirit of Truth there are many voices but there's only two Spirits behind all those voices and these voices can create a lot of confusion but we know God is not the author of confusion so one of the motives of all those voices is to confuse us now these two Spirits have two different agendas one is to get your soul ready for heaven a rapture a spiritual marriage for eternity this spirit is showing the bride is simply showing the bride how to make herself ready now the other is simply to keep that from happening just trying to keep it simple God's hidden Simplicity the other is just simply trying to keep it from happening and one common way to achieve this is to make the believer feel he's already ready that's true that's what laodicea is right in need of nothing now look at this first Spirit that's trying to make us ready Jesus said in John 16 13 how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth no not just part of the truth the motive is all the truth now the other Spirit the spirit of air will guide you slightly off the path of all truth it's not going to necessarily necessarily send you into the bars it's just gonna slightly get you off of the path of all truth and put you on a path with mostly truth remember in the garden there was a mixed tree yes it was the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and Eve lusted for that knowledge he she lusted for that understanding and and Lucifer who was that tree he was perfect when God created him but he chose to do his own will at that point he became a mixed tree that was the tree that God said don't partake of because that'll definitely destroy you now it had partial truth it was that spirit that spoke out and said we are we know you're the most high God but but there was something that wasn't right there they spoke part truth but not part truth so when they came out of Egypt they came out of Egypt a mixed multitude when the when Believers when humans come out of the world they come out as a mixed group lot pitched his tent towards Sodom mixed right balen pitched his tent towards exercising his gift for himself see mixed and there's two trees one is mixed and one is all truth and we're talking about following the word amen because the word is not mixed but Satan wants us to mix things with the word First Timothy 4 1 says we're not some of these scriptures we're not putting up on the board but you can write them down if you want he says now the spirit speaketh expressively that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith giving heed to what seducing spirits and doctrines of devils see they're mixing they were with the spirit they were with the faith but they started giving heed to other spirits mixing second Timothy 3 1 this no also that in the latter days perilous times shall come for men shall be lovers of their own self Covetous bolsters proud unthankful false accusations how do you high Mighty lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God see this there's a mixture mixing having a form of godliness but denying the power seeing a mixture right having part but not the other part and and this is this is the spirit of error it's wanting us to mix it's a mixed tree and that's why it's hard to tell the difference between the two this is what makes it real hard because it has part truth in it but the spirit of air the job of the spirit of error is to to guide you slightly off the path of all truth just slightly off the path of all truth just enough to where the devil can convince you that you're still following the Lord that you're still on the right path because of this this this this and this and he doesn't want you to look at this are you with me amen now both of these Spirits have an anointing they have an unction they have a power to express its plan to make you feel the way they want you to feel Matthew 24 24 says that these two Spirits or these two anointings would be so close in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect these two Spirits behind all these voices and behind people we are following now I don't think Jesus told us this that so we'd have to so we didn't have to worry because we're elect right now I don't think that's why that is there No in fact Jesus said when those well no Spirits tell you to go here or go there or this is where God wants you or that's where God wants you he said believe it not believe it not for where the carcass is there where the Eagles be gathered together where the true breaking of the bread of life is there is where you will find God's Believers God's children just gather in his name and you will find the true anointing of God in his what in his word in his word it isn't so important if I could say it like this the place that your physical body is at as much as where your soul is at amen because God is here to lead and guide us into all truth that's his that's why that was the definition that Jesus gave for sending the Holy Ghost was to send us to lead and guide us into all the truth that he has for us amen now in the course of the day we will hear many voices and the voices have a spirit behind them we've been instructed by the scriptures to try or test the spirit in order to know if it's really God or not and this takes effort because if we just go by our feelings whatever our feelings say that's it but you can't use your feelings can't choose your own your understanding you you can't use your your own ideas I mean how many times have you gotten up and you were just a little bit you know rough and your spouse says uh did you wake up on the wrong side of the bed foreign but you're the same person that woke up on the right side of the bed the day before and that's why we can't judge Spirits by how we feel we can't judge thoughts and Things by how we're feeling inside we need something so much greater than that the spirit of air being so close has the ability to mimic the spirit of Truth it is so close it has the ability to mimic the spirit of Truth the spirit of air brother Brandon said it can be 99.9 7 right but the spirit of truth will lead you into 100 percent truth wow I mean this is it this devil just he doesn't care that you're 0.03 percent off or 99 off he don't care true but God does care first John chapter 4. verse 1. beloved believe not every spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false spirits are gone out into the world there are many voices many spirits many false prophets no this word Prophet is not someone that's out there proclaiming I am a prophet of God these are spirits that are trying to tell you that they are of God when they are not hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come into the flesh is of God but we know Jesus has come in the flesh but do we know that Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever that means Jesus in his flesh is the same as in our flesh he will he will do the same thing he did in US it doesn't stop it's the manifestation of Christ but if the spirit is speaking the word and it isn't moving to live out that word in you then it's not the spirit of Christ remember that this is so important it's a mixed spirit it's a spirit of error any spirit that is speaking part of the word but denying another part is mixed any spirit that speaks to you and will not manifest it right now get away from it see because when the word is manifested in you that's Christ amen but if the word is not manifested in you how can you trust the word that's being spoken out of your mouth now it has nothing to do with whether we're children of God or not children of God it has to do about trying the spirit that gets on us brother Branham talked about we can get a rough Spirit and the Lord just leaves and he goes sits on a on a on a pole somewhere and he waits for the our nature to kind of uh calm down so he feels more at home to come live on us in spirits they get on us all different times and they motivate us and and we you know we we get angry at something we lash out start yelling or get upset or storm out or walk out of the room or quit how how can that be Christ even if we're right even if we're right in how we're looking at the situation how can that be Christ in US because the word isn't being manifested it now if the word is manifested and you're speaking the same words then that's the right Spirit that's God see the word has to be manifested and this is how you try the spirit and and mainly your spirit but you can see it in others of course so having a form of godliness but denying the manifestation of it is a mixed treat this is not manifested and Paul said from such turn away get away from that that type of person remember the devil's religious the Bible says that he believes and he trembles so the spirit of air is the most religious spirit right it's why it's so hard to see the difference verse 3 and every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit of antichrist we're of ye have heard that it should come and now already and even now already it it it it's in the world is it in the world the way we want to look at the Spirit of antichrist is any spirit that refuses to manifest Christ in you right it's not of God that's a that's a spirit of antichrist any spirit that refuses to manifest Christ in your body any spirit that says it's okay don't worry it's true what you're saying it doesn't matter like I'm gonna go blow up some abortion clinics because I know it shouldn't be well Christ wouldn't blow up abortion clinics even though abortion clinics are wrong so it's not about being right or wrong it's about having the right spirit I'd rather be wrong in my Doctrine but have the right spirit because the right Spirit Will Lead Me to the right Doctrine eventually I'll get my act straight but a wrong Spirit no matter how self-righteous I am it will lead me just off slightly off so any spirit that denies living out the word right now presently is an antichrist spirit it's strong it's a true statement amen any spirit that doesn't want you to live for others is an antichrist spirit because the spirit of Christ lives for others that's it's eternal life any spirit that doesn't want you to pay your tithes today is Antichrist spirit we're just trying to bring the word as it is because the spirit of Christ will never deny its word amen amen any spirit that enjoys skipping Church do you hear me enjoy skipping church is the Antichrist spirit because the spirit of God moved on holy men of old as they wrote the word and the word says forsaking not the assembling of ourselves together and all the more as we see the day approaching so we've got to recognize the spirit that is anointing us amen that's just getting us slightly off all the truth Satan is accuser of the brother right right so when any Spirit speaks to us about somebody else something ill something somebody did to us something that just wasn't right something that wasn't fair shouldn't be and we begin to agree with that spirit and think evil think evil agree with that or eventually open our mouth and say something we shouldn't say that is an antichrist spirit but see it's so close to the very light because it uses a truth it uses the truth where if it's God you're going to get on your knees and pray for that person you're going to be calling on God for Mercy to help that person you're going to want to see that person restored you're going to want to manifest Mercy you're going to want to manifest Grace you're going to want to see God moving on the scene if it's the right spirit out around but because we're not taking the word as our absolute and and going by our feelings and our emotions and our we get so caught so tricked by the spirit of error the Devil comes into your mind into your thoughts he's trying to start a battle with you he's trying to start a battle second Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 says for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh for the weapons of our Warfare they're not carnal but they're Mighty through God to the pulling down to the strongholds these strongholds cast down imaginations and every High thing that exalteth itself against the what the knowledge of God I always remember brother Hankins he used to tell us he says when you get a thought about somebody quickly pray for them quickly because if you don't sister Jeannie probably remembers that if you don't you'll end up probably thinking something bad about them and bring into captivity every thought to what to obedience God you still have a responsibility to in in the Warfare to every thought that comes into your head you still have to deal with it the right way and God is looking for you to be obedient in that in that battle even though somebody else did you wrong for instance they came to Jesus they spit on them they slapped them they made them bleed they made fun of them but he reviled not against them he was obedient to the word he he kept himself under subjection to the word of how to act right he didn't say I know you I know where you live and you know what you're when this thing's all over you're going to hell he didn't act like that either should we and having in a Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled when we're truly following the word we're truly following his voice and we're we're truly obeying the word that's how you know you're following the word is when you're obeying it so now all of us obeyed are obeying the word in some part of it what we want to do is be obeying the word in the part that we're not amen now best case scenario we don't know any part of our life that we're not obeying that's best case scenario and then you come to church and then you find out the part you need to build vain worst case scenario is that you know there's a part of the word of God that you're not following but you've been okay with that you're under the influence of a spirit of error that's that anointing that I was telling you about we must learn to try the voices that are speaking to our hearts try them test them how do you do that with the rest of the word we don't want to rely on our feelings or ideas or circumstances or our opinions but we must try them verse 4 ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world so we don't have an excuse for not living the word we don't have an excuse for not obeying this word if we are overcomed and all of a sudden we begin to act unchristianized we simply need to repent and say sorry Lord and quickly get back to the word do not wallow in that thing right do not live in that thing do not do not let the sun go down upon your wrath do not allow Satan to take the upper hand of the upper advantage in your life they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world notice here at them so who gets caught up in the spirit of air who listens to the spirit who follows this is they that are of the world the majority of the spirits that speak to us are of the world the majority of the voices that we hear in our head are of the world it's the truth it's the truth now if you're walking in the spirit I mean you are walking in the spirit well I'll just say it like this the devil don't want to be around you right you'll probably have a lot less I know you will you will have a lot less problems because you're walking in the spirit but you don't walk in the spirit because you're a child of God that's not what you don't find any scripture in the Bible that says that you have to walk in the spirit to not fulfill the lust of the flesh you have to press in Vite God in make them part of everything verse six now we we are of God and he that knoweth God heareth us he that he that is not of God they don't listen to us hereby know we the spirit of Truth and look the spirit of air there's your two spirits any Spirit wants you to compromise with the word mix with the word Paul said it like this let him be accursed if a man come preaching or Spirit come preaching any other thing that what's already been written that's why it's important for us to spend time in the word it isn't that we have it right it before it isn't that we haven't heard it before but we need God to bring things to our remembrance which he promised to do and and we hide that word it becomes important to us and that we don't want to miss him because he's leading us into all truth amen now Jesus said in Saint John chapter 10 he said I am the door I in the door verse that very very not saying to you I'm the door of the Sheep verse 8 and all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the Sheep did not hear them I am the door for if for for by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out and find pasture so this is you know what a blessing that we just come in and we feed on the word of God amen amen the thief cometh not but to steal to kill destroy and I've come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly thank God he's here to give his life more abundant than what we already have I want it I want more I want more joy I want more peace I want more love I want I want honestly I want to be able to love the person who almost kills me because if I have that then I know I have what Jesus had amen but anything short of that is really not the Abundant Life that he's promised says I am the Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep are there so many subjects in these scriptures but turn with me if you would if you got your Bibles with you I trust it you brought your swords Psalms 23. Psalms 23 following we're following the word now right Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd notice my it's a personal the Lord is my shepherd he's the Good Shepherd he's the the door of the sheep and the very next words is I shall not want if God is your personal Shepherd then he's your boss whatever you want outside of him becomes your struggle in life and eventually will become your downfall so this these four words that we want to just bypass are really crucial to the rest of the Psalms the Lord is my shepherd I shall not one now that needs to be exercised a one good way to do it is is as our brother Mark was saying seek ye first seek ye first the kingdom and everything else is going to be added to your life now if if God is your personal Shepherd you're not seeking your will think about it you're not seeking your wants you're not seeking your way you're not seeking your ideas in this personal relationship that you have with your Shepherd we don't have anything to do with God's leadership for our life it's his leadership we don't go into a meeting like they do when they're going to go to war or we're gonna go into a company meeting and we're going to talk about what we want to do where we want the company to go what how we want to surprise them in War and what angle we want to come from we're not having a meeting with God about what we are going to do in our life we didn't pitch in and create us we didn't give God some ideas or things or faith to build us right it's all him we are the Sheep of his pasture we are his creation so he's called the shots in her life I shall not want verse two he maketh me to lie down in church notice he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures because you've forfeited your will now he leadeth me beside the Still Waters praise God for that you ever just get so busy and you know the only answer is settle down just settle down slow down it's quite easy to see why a lot of Believers are not faithful to church they have not completely forfeited their will because when you forfeit your will he maketh me to lay down in Green Pastures he will bring you that brother Brandon said it like this he says you can't wait to get there just him inside of you drawing you to the place he's at so notice we're in a battle these Spirits are so close they will deceive you you'll end up getting to the place of missing church and you'll think it's okay look it's never God's will it's never God's will now I'm not saying that there's not times that God won't allow it and that it's just literally impossible something has come up I mean that's called life but I'm not talking about that I'm talking about when you have the the capability of making something happen and you don't that's the Antichrist spirit and if we if we do not get a hold of that thing then we're really not being led by God we're really not following the word right we're following a spirit that is getting us slightly away from all truth we got to allow the spirit of God to make us lay down in Green Pastures to set us by Still Waters to lead us to the place where we can drink from him amen now notice the reason that we're following him is not for the benefits of our Natural Life is for the benefits of our soul verse 3 he restoreth my soul he leadeth me in Paths of righteousness for his name's sake if you're really following Christ the word he's calling the shots and what he's wanting to do is to restore our soul to the place it needs to be we think our soul got restored when we repented and got baptized that just put us on the track that just put us on the track that put us on the right track and if we died at that moment praise God to whom little was given little is required but if you got more days to live it ain't for you it ain't for your life it's for your soul God wants more he wants to see her soul totally restored I believe that with all my heart ye though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death I will fear no evil thou art with me thy rod and thy staff they Comfort now what is that Valley of the shadow of death it's really not death but it's the Valley of the Shadow of death it's the shadow of death so what is that what is that that's you dying out to your will you're really not dead right but you're dying out to your will and as you walk through that you know what the hardest thing is you know that you that have helped your children with driver's ed and let giving them the wheel for the first time and you're sitting in the passenger seat you're really wanting them you're really wanting the driver's ed teacher to spend more time with them first but Driver's Ed wants the parent to be responsible for spending time so you're putting your life in their hands and when you die out to your will when you say God I'm going to do your will it's a scary thing you don't get to do what you wanted to do I mean I I wanted to do some I wanted to do things that I God didn't want me to do I mean I wanted to be a doctor I wanted to be a musician I wanted to be a hockey player I did not want to be a business owner it's like I had to surrender I'll say it today that God wants us to surrender every day to him and it it's like you're walking through a valley of a shadow of death but here's the thing I will fear no evil I don't I don't have to worry what's going to happen to me God is with me the rod of Correction it comforts me the staff the staff in which I lean on when I'm tired and I need a break and it's there to comfort me thou preparest a table before me in the presence of my enemies see I don't have to worry about the enemy because God's with me because greater is he that's in me then this outside man amen thou anointest my head with oil praise God he has a work for you to do your Kings and Priests just like David was anointed to be king he has an oil for us because he has a job for us to do for him for my cup runeth over God has joy unspeakable for us he wants you to get so full of him that you're just bubbling over surely goodness and mercy shall follow me notice you're not following it it's fall it's following you because you're following God God is good surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever praise the lord I can't wait to get there the word of God needs to become our absolute if we're going to follow the word follow his voice it needs to become our absolute not just when it's convenient for us not just when we want to use it to judge somebody else you know how quick we are to use the word to judge somebody right that's true not only when we are claiming God's promises but it needs to be our absolute in everything not just use it for our own benefits but use it for correction use it to get our life more pleasing to him I mean Jesus went up and he said these words if you love me keep my Commandments he's sending us a message that it doesn't matter what you feel like towards me I'm looking at I'm staring at one thing I am not staring at your feelings I'm not staring at your emotions yes I am touched by all the Affliction that you're going through and he sees our emotions he sees our feelings but when it comes to the love relationship he's looking at one thing are you doing everything that I've asked you to do therein is where you're showing your your love for God you know that I'm sorry Lord you know that I'm sorry and I didn't mean to do that please have mercy on me I don't care because until you learn to have mercy on somebody else I'm not going to have mercy on you amen amen see we want to take part of the word and claim part of the word and saying I'm following the word but God is wanting us to follow all the word the part that we're not given much attention to give much attention to it the word needs to become our absolute for our lives not just part of it but all of it if the word of God is forever settle in heaven it needs to be forever settled in her heart and there and here's the key we all believe that this word is true we do we all say yes amen the word is true say Amen to that I want you to say I am doing everything that I possibly can to follow every word of God that's what we should be saying Amen to because that's the part that's important it's the life not not a spirit that says I believe but is denying the life we're looking for the spirit that says it and lives it that spirit and there's a lot of spirits that come to us and quotes it but is it willing to come submission to it and I'll say when the word of God becomes personal to you your personal absolute you can you'll know you'll you'll recognize God leading you more but if the word is not really important to you and you just kind of want God to help you with things in life and you're wanting help with that you're wanting God or the word of God to be used to help you with things in your life you're going to miss God's leadership for your life because the word is everything to God the word is everything to God and what he's trying to get his sheep on the same page with is that the word becomes everything to the Sheep the word has to become everything to the Sheep and when it becomes your personal absolute you'll recognize him leading you more because people are looking for God but they're not recognizing him in his word I could go to God all day long about something and he may or may not give it to me he may lead me in that and he may not lead me in that and I could literally write a list of 100 things that I want I could I could write 200 things at the shop that I want I can write 500 things at home that I want of course the first one would be the greenhouse yeah but you know what to me wanting what does God want amen what does God want the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he's leading so if we can recognize the importance of this word that we've been maybe not putting enough emphasis in this is not a religion this is not just oh we're behind the message we believe in the Prophet this is our denomination that is not the message the message that Prophet The Prophet brought was that Jesus Christ was the same in you today as he was back then and if we never get him to manifest his word inside of us what does it matter if your brother and your sister isn't doing it matter what really matters is the word manifested in you my sheep hear my voice and they follow me God has not made us to just be to call out who's on sheepers no he's caught his sheep to follow him amen like to the place though he slay me yet why trust him so I go through the valley of the shadow that I will fear no evil where he leads I will follow whatever his word says no matter how small it may be no matter how insignificant no matter how minute it needs to become our absolute we don't know what God is speaking to every one of us in here but here's the thing the devil really wants to do he wants to take and dilute the word like you're doing the most important things this other stuff God understands see that Spirit of error where we got to have a hunger to please God and everything now look it's impossible for me to give every one of you a million dollars so that pressure is off of me that's gone because I don't have a million dollars to give everybody so God knows our limitations but I can spend some time praying amen am I doing that I can spend some time saying God there's part of this word that I am not obeying and I need your help I can't do that see it's all about your personal relationship with God God help us God help us Psalms 119 105 says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet a light unto my path I never I'll never forget brother Johnson talking about uh when he went in the mission field that there was uh some places that he went to where they would actually strap lanterns on their ankles or on their legs and as they walked through the jungle uh they had just enough light to see what was in front of them so they wouldn't be stepping on any wrong thing and when we come to church this word is a lamp for our feet it gives light to the path around now what is the path we're on he lead us is he he restores our soul he leads us in Paths of righteousness for so this word is to help us in the right way that's what the light is for that's what the word being preached for the word gives life to our walk God is leading you down a path to to Soul restoration that's the path he's leading you down Paths of righteousness he's he's making you to lay down in Green Pastures and he's leading you besides Still Water that's what the light is for my sheep hear my voice and they follow me down this path now here's the hardest thing for us to do is we're trying we're trying so hard to hear God speak something personal to us when we're at church like God you know my struggles you know what I'm going through or God you know what I want or you know I I didn't read chapter 10 and this is not I was reading chapter nine seasons why we're having a hard time connecting with hearing God's personal voice to us but just trying to keep this simple your God wants our heart to follow this word and I don't care if we're on chapter 10 chapter 11 12 13 14 it's all important to him and our longing needs to be God whatever you tell me I'm going to follow because if we don't we're just we're like a thief and robber that wants the good things of God but not willing to walk into the door not willing to go the right way Jesus is the door and he is the word there's not one scripture in here that isn't Jesus Christ in fact the prophet says if you don't see Jesus in that scripture go back and read it so all the word is important to God it needs to become important to us if we lose that importance if we shy away from that if we allow the things of the world to just kind of overshadow Our Lives become consumed we get off the path and that's only a spirit of air that will do that let's take a look at Peter for a moment when Jesus came to Peter he said come on Peter follow me I'm the Good Shepherd and you know what I'm going to make you a very rich person did he say that no no he said I'm going to make you real popular no Fishers of men's souls in other words you're going to be in the restoration business with me and you know straightway the Bible says straight away they left their occupation they left their business to follow him kind of a reckless abandonment wouldn't you say but there was something inside of Peter something inside of his brother my sheep hear my voice and they follow me and so Peter they began to follow the Lord and he followed him through discipleship Jesus taught them and they they went out two by two and they they casting out devils and healing all men are sicknesses and the word began to get hard to them all sudden they thought they were doing the right thing and Jesus said you don't even know what Spirit you're of don't act like that and did you know the majority of Jesus's disciples left him the majority let's pick it up in in John chapter 6. remember many are called if you are chosen the word keeps getting harder and harder as we follow him from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him now I want you to think about this these disciples never thought they were leaving God foreign they just thought that this man that they were following wasn't all of God wasn't all of God and there's the trick Satan wants us to make some reason why we're not going to keep following him but we're going to step back while we're going to take it easy why we're going to follow him from afar or why we're just going to start see they lean to their own understanding they had their own ideas their own thoughts their own feelings about the word that was being preached the Bible made it real clear that they did not understand the word that was being preached and we don't praise God we don't have to understand it how many times did the Bible say after Jesus got done talking about Parables and things he said and his disciples didn't understand it that's okay understanding comes it will come but you got to believe it there's many things you know the prophet went a long time not clearly understanding certain things in the scriptures God's the only one that can break it to us amen all right verse 67 then said Jesus unto the twelve are you going to go away also are you going to step back slide back are you going to start not being faithful and then Simon Peter answered Lord to whom shall we go thou has the words of eternal life amen and we believe and are sure that though at the Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered said I have have not a chosen to have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil that's a whole nother sermon that's a whole another sermon notice many are called few are chosen he uses that word chosen here and it's not the same word not the same meaning he spake or judasized Gary at the son of Simon for he it is that should betray him being one of the twelve so the more that Peter followed the word the harder it got for him the word kept getting harder and harder to follow there's no problem casting out Devils but when the word began to say that you need to suffer for the word and that was it when Jesus said look I'm going to die I'm going to be taken away I'm going to suffer from the high priest no that ain't going to happen Peter rolls up no that ain't going to happen Jesus said look I'm not the only one that's going to have to go through this you're going to have to go through this no way we're going to band together we're going to be United together we're going to fight this thing together I'm never going to leave you I'm never going to deny you I want nothing to happen to you you know that was an antichrist spirit here is his own disciple trying to stay in unity in in unity with Christ but noticed it was the Flesh of Christ it wasn't the spirit of Christ because the spirit of Christ was speaking and what the word says it's going to happen and Earth will pass away but the word is not going to pass away amen but see we can become attached to the Natural the natural and Jesus was speaking to the spiritual are you with me anytime we disagree with the word it's the wrong spirit that's why we need to to go on and get the Holy Ghost for ourselves and let God have preemness because that's what was really really missing and I'm not saying that I feel that all of us here have a portion of the Holy Ghost amen and I if I could say this if I could say we are all sealed with the Holy Ghost if I could say that I would still say to you you need to go on and get more Holy Ghost my message is not going to change because see it's only the devil that's wanting to make you feel like you have enough it is not the spirit of God God has wanted us to press in now the word is leading us to a complete restoration of our soul a complete manifestation of the word it is Christ in you the hope of glory and all the Earth is groaning waiting for this manifestation to take place we're kind of waiting around for this and that and God is waiting for his seed to come forth no it's not for everybody how many times we talk to some people and they turn us down it's sad but we are his sheep we're the Sheep of his pasture he has he has brought us in to feed on the word to get in his presence and to leave here manifesting the word that we hear here that we hear hear you know what I'm saying all right I'm going to stop there I have three more pages but time is up and I don't want to you get time read Matthew 19 27 229 can I at least read one quote Matthew 18 30. oh that is so hard to leave that one uh John 18. let me just at least read this I want to bring bring a a thought to you here Matthew 18 37 pilate therefore said unto Jesus art thou a a kingdom and Jesus answered thou says that I I'm a king to this and was I born for this cause came into the world that I should bear witness of the truth now notice the next sentence everyone that is of Truth heareth my voice if I know God's word says something and I'm not doing it all's I'm doing is declaring that I am not of Truth and that is scary but if I am of Truth I will hear that voice and I will bring this body under subjection and I will follow that word because he's leading us to Restoration do you believe that my sheep hear my voice I know them and they follow me all right relax just a moment I want to read this uh quote out of the message leadership Bible says but he refused to be guided speaking of the Rich Young Ruler he refused to accept the real leadership of Jesus Christ to give him eternal life the other leaders now this is important the other leaders that had been in his youthful days had such an influence on him till he refused to accept God's provided way which was Jesus Christ now the other leaders you see they had such a hold on him their people is taught well we belong to this and we belong to that and had such a hold on him but what a fatal thing to reject the leadership of eternal life now that life is present tonight that's right the holy spirit is here which is Christ in spirit form the the Holy Spirit the anointing is here a little while and the world seeth me no more but you shall see me my sheep know my voice they know God but I'll be with you even in you to the consummation of the end of the world now Jesus alone listen to this Jesus alone can lead you to eternal life forget about following anybody but the word now you can follow Paul as he followeth Christ but you cannot follow a man you have to make sure you have to make sure it's the word being spoken through the man even if they're speaking the word if they're not living it stay away from it because eventually it's going to get you off so Jesus alone can lead you to an eternal life there's no church no denomination no preacher no priest no nothing else can lead you to it you must be led by him and only the only one that can lead you don't you love that I'm so glad God sent a prophet could you imagine him leading you out of his word I can't imagine but some people are being let out of the word and they don't think they're wrong that's not God could you imagine him leading you out of his word that's why every word's important now maybe you think I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I'm going to heaven that don't mean one thing that you're going to heaven no sir you can have the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day every hour in your life and still be lost and go to hell the Bible says so exactly right and when a man has been born again by the word of God there's a difference between a true birth and being baptized with the Holy Ghost every day but when a man has been born again by the word of God predestined to eternal life called the elect it'll be word of God on top of word word on Word that's what our brother Mark was saying Wednesday what I'm looking at maybe you don't see that's why I'm here to try to tell you it's not because I don't love people it's because I do love people it's corrective when I see the slipping of the church going off see well we see we did this and we did that look around other over the church and see it just won't work then look here in the Bible and see it's got to be that way at the end the lukewarm laodicean Church age putting Jesus out the word putting the word out he ain't going to call no church he said as many as I love I rebuke and chasten I love that he's calling individuals taking the word and pounding on it telling you're wrong in it that's the reason I love you if you'll open the door and let me in I'll come in and I'll sup with you not a church he'd done been put out of that God's calling individuals I stand at the door and I knock If any man any person you see if you're ordained to see it you see if you're ordained to see it if you're not ordained to see it you won't see it said they have eyes to see but they can't see they have ears but they can't hear how thankful you should be Church how thankful you should be Church how you should straighten yourselves up from these things how you should be on fire for God that your eyes behold what you see in your ears here with the the things they see and the things they see leadership why did you come here tonight to hear the message like this I'm branded across the world by Churches as fanatic why did you come the Holy Spirit Led you here to listen to be circumcised to cut away the things of the world except the leadership of Jesus Christ or you'll perish as sure as the world that that that's our Our Shepherd our Good Shepherd who's trying to help us to get back to the word that we're part that were not fallen so it's up to all of us as we stand together as we stand together it's up to all of us to take time and evaluate which part of the word have we just let slip which part of the word have we not given much attention to which part have we not been following because this message following the word is man shall not live thy bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out the mouth of God now I'll say like this God is presented his word to us he's given us his will for our lives it's up to you to want God to bring the conviction to allow it to deal with you or to just leave church without that so as we go to the Lord we're going to just spend just a little bit of time praying I want you to be thinking about what God is trying to speak to you what is he wanting you to do because my sheep hear my voice and they follow me and I believe I do believe when we come to church God has something personal for every one of us amen I just believe that he's I don't know I don't know what's on your minds I don't know where you're at but I know God does and he's able to take this word and and deal with us let's if we could just see real quietly pleasing pleasing it's just maybe bow our heads for just a moment and close our eyes and just think on him maybe you've been running from something and it's it's time to stop running Just Surrender to him maybe you've been making excuses you heard from God today that he wants you to be faithful to him faithful to read the Bible faithful to get back to the tapes faithful to start supporting the ministry [Music] maybe maybe we've gotten away from prayer praying one for another thank you maybe we just been confused by so many commit or see things going on you hear God calling you back [Music] maybe you haven't been wanting to lay down in Green Pastures you you feel him wanting to make you to lay down Green Pastures today friend um I don't know what God's been speaking to you [Music] my advice to you is take heed to what he has spoken say yes Lord I I Surrender it to you I I I give you my will I I will walk in your word I will take your word as an absolute for my life I will straighten the things up in my life that have have not been perfect Lord have not been I know pleasing to you I will bring my tongue under subjection I will spend more time with you Lord whatever it is let God have his way in your life today Lord we come to you in prayer for your sheep Lord you come to give them life in life more abundant we thank you for Calvary today we thank you for giving your life for your sheep today and Heavenly Father we thank you that you've been leading them and that you've been guiding them from that time that they surrendered their life to this very moment today and we want to thank you that they've been in the palm of your hand but Lord through that time Lord there's been many stumbles many pitfalls and there's that song and Amazing Grace says it was your grace that taught our Heart To Fear and it's your grace that brought us out from that fear you brought us too many dangers many toils you set our feet upon a rock and God here we've subjected ourselves to the word today and I ask that you would take our lives Lord as your sheep you are the Good Shepherd you are the chief Shepherd you are the one that called us you're the one that leading us and Lord we could all testify today that things are getting harder it is harder to follow you the more the word that we hear the harder it gets foreign you've supplied us with a holy ghost comforter not Iran thy staff they do Comfort us you set the comforter and I pray that you would comfort your people here Lord that you would help them in their personal lives and all their battles that they're having with the Enemy God that's you would would be the high tower in their life that they could run into and be safe that you could be Lord that hiding place for them Lord that you can you would reveal yourself to them in that time of need be a present help in a time of trouble Lord I commit them to you I commit their lives to you I pray that you'd hear and answer their prayer and I pray Lord that your sheep your sheep here today will follow your word more closely Lord give more attendance care more about following your word we'll give you the praise for all these things now Lord we honor you and Praise You In Jesus Christ's precious name thank you Lord thank you I am needy Lord so needy of you I am so needy Lord to be more like you share all my rights away in this world of sin I am so needy Lord to be pure Within it I am so needy Lord Sony
