[37:46] I have a little bit of a um difficulty
[37:50] explaining just who it is I'm going to
[37:52] visit Michigan uh because not only do I
[37:55] consider um I note you know brother John
[37:57] is my father-in-law but I consider him
[37:59] to be a dear friend and a mentor it's
[38:02] one that someone I look up to so if I
[38:05] say I'm just going to visit the in-laws
[38:07] it doesn't quite convey uh just what's
[38:09] in store for me necessarily and then I
[38:11] feel the same way about the whole family
[38:12] and sister Cheryl uh just a wonderful
[38:14] friend and always had such wonderful
[38:16] Fellowship around the things of the Lord
[38:17] so for me it's wonderful to be here and
[38:20] obviously my wife is like a daughter to
[38:22] Brother John so she always looks forward
[38:25] to coming my kids are like grandkids so
[38:27] we we really look forward to coming for
[38:29] a lot of personal reasons but also the
[38:31] friendship and fellowship for myself
[38:33] personally is always wonderful even with
[38:35] Johnny uh you know people I say he's my
[38:37] brother-in-law but he's one of my best
[38:38] friends so just uh it's wonderful to

[39:07] from heart surgery and you're looking
[39:10] great God is so good amen so good we're
[39:13] so grateful for
[39:17] that amen if you could now just look in
[39:20] your Bibles psalms
[39:22] 27 we'll start with verse one we'll read
[39:24] to verse 6 you'll recognize this text uh
[39:27] in the message brother Bram takes it
[39:29] when he preaches the Rapture so this is
[39:31] not just a song it's not just poetry but
[39:35] it's Prophecy of the very moments that
[39:36] you're living in right now the Lord is
[39:39] my light and my salvation Whom Shall I
[39:42] Fear the Lord is the strength of my life
[39:45] of whom shall I be afraid when the
[39:47] wicked even my enemies and my foes Came
[39:49] Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled
[39:51] and fell though an host should encamp
[39:54] against me my heart shall not fear the
[39:55] war should rise against me in this will
[39:58] I be confident one thing have I desired
[40:02] of the Lord that will I seek after that
[40:04] I may dwell in the house of the Lord all
[40:06] the days of my life to behold the beauty
[40:09] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[40:12] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[40:14] me in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[40:17] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[40:19] me up upon a rock there's your there's
[40:22] the time we're in this wonderful Rapture
[40:25] season and now my head be lifted up
[40:27] above mine enemies round about me
[40:29] therefore will I offer in his Tabernacle
[40:32] sacrifices of Joy I will sing yay I will
[40:35] sing praises unto the Lord amen amen you
[40:39] can be
[40:40] seated we do desire that God would bless
[40:43] the word which we've read and that it
[40:45] would just be Amplified To Us by
[40:48] Revelation and I have just a real uh
[40:50] real simple thought today it's just
[40:53] wonderful to see the house of the Lord
[40:54] full and all of you making it out uh to
[40:56] church I I get the feeling that if
[40:58] everybody showed up you'd have to start
[40:59] bringing out chairs and so it's so good
[41:01] to see everyone here we know many some
[41:03] are traveling some are sick uh but it's
[41:05] just so good to see everyone here and I
[41:06] trust that you're expecting and and
[41:09] listening to what the Lord might have
[41:10] for you personally and individually but
[41:12] it should it's going to be real simple
[41:13] today real direct uh simply direct and
[41:17] so we just trust that it will be a
[41:18] blessing to you if we could just focus
[41:20] on verse four as we read this already
[41:23] Psalms
[41:24] 27:4 my title is going to be one thing
[41:28] desired one thing desired pulling it
[41:31] straight from this very verse here where
[41:33] David says one thing have I desired of
[41:35] the Lord that will I seek after so he's
[41:37] kind of combining his desire to what he
[41:40] seeks and his actions that I may dwell
[41:43] in the house of the Lord all the days of
[41:45] my life to behold the beauty of the Lord
[41:47] and to inquire in his Temple the subject
[41:51] of the house of the Lord is something
[41:52] I've just been studying I studying it
[41:53] personally for some time I just begin to
[41:56] Minister on it at our home Church in
[41:58] Phoenix and so there's just a really
[42:00] large context to what David is saying
[42:02] here and there's a lot that relates to
[42:05] the end times and the Rapture there's a
[42:06] lot that relates to uh the Tabernacle
[42:09] and the temple the house of the Lord and
[42:11] the one that David desired to build and
[42:12] the one that was built and what it
[42:14] represents so there's a large context to
[42:17] this but just want to focus on one
[42:20] aspect in this scripture even just
[42:22] zeroing in on one aspect or one phrase
[42:25] from this entire reading
[42:26] and he says that he desired one thing
[42:30] one thing have I desired of the Lord so
[42:32] there was I say one one main object that
[42:35] I have every day if you're to distill my
[42:37] life down to one thing if you're to kind
[42:39] of summarize what my singular wish would
[42:42] be this is the one thing as we could put
[42:44] it this way kind of the ruling desire of
[42:46] his heart everything else was judged by
[42:49] this for him to say one thing means I I
[42:51] judge everything by this if it won't
[42:53] further this ambition if it won't get me
[42:55] closer to this then I weigh everything
[42:58] by this desire and when he says one I'd
[43:01] like to put it this way kind of suggests
[43:03] that there's an exclusion of things one
[43:06] thing have I desired so he's excluding
[43:08] everything else you say well David what
[43:10] about the palace nope that's not what I
[43:12] desire what about to be back home and to
[43:14] be in Bethlehem what about uh uh what
[43:16] about wealth and what about power what
[43:18] about Fame what about victories and War
[43:20] he says he would say no there's one
[43:22] thing I've desired above everything else
[43:24] and in other words I I I I read
[43:27] somewhere where it kind of described it
[43:28] this way that if David was to lose
[43:30] family if he was to lose his own health
[43:32] if he was to lose riches it wouldn't
[43:34] hurt as bad as not having
[43:37] this so he said one thing have I desired
[43:40] he's saying that I I may not get this
[43:42] and I may not get that but those would
[43:45] not hurt if I if those things are lost
[43:47] whether it be health or uh um wealth or
[43:49] fame or even the throne if I lose all
[43:51] that it wouldn't hurt as much as if I
[43:54] lost this one thing or didn't have this
[43:56] one thing this is the the peak of my
[43:59] prayer this is the climax of my desires
[44:01] above all other things that I've asked
[44:03] for one thing have I desired the Lord
[44:05] that will I seek after so he desired one
[44:08] thing and because he desired one thing
[44:10] he's saying I sought one thing this has
[44:12] become the primary objective of my life
[44:15] this is my governing Pursuit this is my
[44:17] main aim if I if I take a step and it's
[44:19] getting going to get me further from
[44:21] this I don't want to take that step I if
[44:23] I'm going to do something that's going
[44:25] to make it harder for me to do this to
[44:26] seek this then I don't want to take that
[44:29] step and I I believe that when David
[44:31] says one thing have I desired the Lord
[44:34] that will I seek after H to say desire
[44:37] and seek I think he's acknowledging the
[44:39] pretense and the vanity of lip service
[44:42] oh I really love that I really I really
[44:44] love to go to church well when's the
[44:46] last time you went right I really love
[44:48] the word of God when's the last time you
[44:50] read the Bible and oh I just love to
[44:51] talk to God when's the last time you
[44:53] prayed and so David is even kind of
[44:55] acknowledging that a lot of people can
[44:57] say they want one thing oh was I was
[45:00] glad when they said unto me let us go
[45:01] into the house of the Lord and that's as
[45:03] far as it goes right I was just glad
[45:05] that I heard it I didn't necessarily
[45:06] meant I went and so there's a uh it's
[45:09] kind of good to preach it live to people
[45:10] at church because you be like you know
[45:11] what this that's right I'm here I'm in
[45:14] church but the to to say I desire and
[45:17] seek it it's kind of acknowledging that
[45:19] sometimes we can say things but not
[45:20] actually follow up in action if the
[45:23] heart truly desires one thing then the
[45:25] one thing Des IR ired will be sought
[45:27] after it'll become a priority you
[45:30] sometimes corporations or entities or
[45:32] organizations have a governing priority
[45:35] and you can have bylaws you can have
[45:36] rules and regulations you can have all
[45:38] sorts of parameters that you operate
[45:40] within but there sometimes is a
[45:41] governing priority that if you're in a
[45:43] situation you can't remember all the
[45:45] rules and you're not sure what to do ask
[45:47] yourself what is the one thing we're
[45:48] trying to accomplish and in that given
[45:51] instance make a decision that furthers
[45:54] the objective the main objective so it's
[45:56] a governing priority this is what we
[45:58] this is what dictates our actions this
[46:01] is what we go by to tell us what to do
[46:03] in a situation we're not sure of so if
[46:05] you have a priority it's the one thing
[46:07] that's more important than anything
[46:09] else and David to say one thing have I
[46:12] desired of the Lord I think it's
[46:13] expressing a hunger a desire as brother
[46:17] John was leading songs I was like well
[46:19] he's he's pretty inspired today he
[46:20] should just preach and I talked to
[46:22] Brother Bruce out there said maybe he
[46:24] should just preach since we he maybe was
[46:26] expecting to lead songs and I just got
[46:27] turn kept getting turned down but
[46:29] brother John just having some of that
[46:31] inspiration about hunger and desire
[46:33] David is expressing desire he's
[46:36] expressing hunger clearly in what he's
[46:37] saying but it's also indicates
[46:40] value when he says one thing have I
[46:42] desired it's not that he just had a
[46:43] hanen for something and he couldn't
[46:45] explain it like he was addicted to
[46:46] something that he hated but it was
[46:48] something that he valued showed some
[46:50] high esteem or great importance to the
[46:53] thing that he desired in Psalms
[46:56] 26:8 says Lord I've loved the habitation
[47:00] of thy house in the place where thine
[47:02] honor dwelleth the place where the
[47:04] shikina glory rest the place where God
[47:07] was pleased to dwell the place that he
[47:08] put his name and David is expressing
[47:12] desire I love the habitation of the
[47:14] house one thing have I desired that will
[47:16] I seek after that I may dwell in the
[47:19] house of the Lord all the days of my
[47:21] life he valued the house of the Lord now
[47:24] again I'm not going to get into what
[47:25] that would mean and what that would
[47:27] represent but it was a place where God's
[47:29] honor dwelt it was a place that God's
[47:31] habitation was a place that he put his
[47:33] name a place where the shikina glory
[47:35] would rest and would be at home amen and
[47:38] so David is expressing value and if you
[47:41] if you value something you recognize its
[47:43] usefulness so so you say oh I really
[47:45] love that well why do you love that I
[47:47] just really love it and they don't
[47:49] really give a reason you question
[47:50] whether or not they could really value
[47:52] it but when someone understands what it
[47:53] is and what it does and its usefulness
[47:55] then they really value it value often
[47:58] times is is kind of assessed in one's
[48:00] its capacity for good or what it can
[48:02] bring its importance or its worth and
[48:06] David is expressing value and I I want
[48:08] to maybe I haven't get a lot given a lot
[48:10] of context what's in my mind and what's
[48:12] in my heart as I say this so you might
[48:14] just be kind of on edge like where is he
[48:16] going with this that's a good place to
[48:17] be because then you just kind of follow
[48:19] tension and suspense is really good and
[48:22] so if you're if you're wondering maybe
[48:24] need a little bit more cont text I I'm
[48:26] challenging our hearts today on what we
[48:29] value what we desire so that's that's
[48:32] certainly at kind of what's at the heart
[48:33] of the things that we're talking about
[48:35] and David is expressing desire and value
[48:38] in Matthew chapter 6: 3132 and 33 Jesus
[48:43] says therefore take no thought let there
[48:45] not be any anxiety or concern saying
[48:49] what shall we eat or what shall we drink
[48:51] or wherewith All Shall we be
[48:54] clothed these these things of eating
[48:56] drinking and clothing these would be the
[48:58] essentials kind of the base needs uh
[49:00] that we might have if I'm going to make
[49:02] it many days I need to eat if I'm going
[49:04] to make it many days I need to drink and
[49:06] if I'm going to be able to make my way
[49:07] through my days I need to be clothed
[49:09] says for after all these things do the
[49:12] Gentiles seek now as we read that eating
[49:15] drinking and clothing it says nothing of
[49:17] the character or nature of the eating
[49:19] and drinking and clothing so it's not
[49:21] that they were seeking things that in
[49:23] themselves were these uh were needs in
[49:26] the sense that they were evil but
[49:28] Gentiles seek them because we need them
[49:31] but he says for your Heaven he says for
[49:33] after all these things do the Gentiles
[49:34] seek but then he says for your heavenly
[49:36] father knoweth that you have need of all
[49:38] these
[49:39] things when it says after these things
[49:42] the Gentiles seek and other this was
[49:44] their Chief
[49:45] intention uh that they engaged in
[49:48] seeking only seeking what they would eat
[49:50] and what they would drink and what they
[49:52] would wear that this was the only good
[49:54] that if there was any good it was what
[49:56] we're eating what we're drinking and how
[49:57] we're clothed and where we would live
[49:59] it's how well can we um dress and how
[50:02] well can we eat and can we preserve our
[50:04] life as long as we can and so this is
[50:07] telling us Jesus is telling us that
[50:09] one's diligence to something is a direct
[50:11] reflection of one's
[50:14] desires that if you you're diligent to
[50:16] seek after good food and a lot of food
[50:19] or this drink or this clothing all those
[50:20] things then it it's a reflection of
[50:22] one's desire towards it if you seek
[50:24] after it and you put a lot of attention
[50:26] to it after these things the Gentiles
[50:28] seek in other words these are the things
[50:30] that they valued above everything else
[50:32] what they ate what they would drink and
[50:33] what they would wear but then Jesus
[50:36] turns it completely around says but seek
[50:38] ye first the kingdom of God and his
[50:41] righteousness in all these things shall
[50:43] be added unto you I know it's it's it's
[50:47] simplistic that the Gentiles seek after
[50:49] food drink and
[50:51] clothing but it it points out to all the
[50:54] different things that we need in our
[50:55] daily lives for for comfort and to live
[50:57] and to uh to make our way through life
[51:00] and there's maybe a lot of lot of things
[51:01] that relate to us not just as easy as
[51:03] saying what we shall drink and we know
[51:05] this just even if we want water right
[51:08] you say well I want water is it ph
[51:10] balanced is it smart water I mean what
[51:12] does that mean is it collect my connect
[51:13] to my Bluetooth what's smart water and
[51:16] there's different things you can't even
[51:18] just get water anymore and you say well
[51:19] I just want water well I want spring
[51:21] water well where was that spring you say
[51:23] well I want a good clean spring all
[51:25] right so spring water and then you go to
[51:27] Bas says but is that a plastic or glass
[51:29] bottle we can't drink water anymore
[51:32] without worrying about whether or not
[51:33] it's going to kill us and so when we
[51:36] talk about what you're going to eat what
[51:37] you're going to drink and what you're
[51:38] going to wear we realize there's a lot
[51:39] of decisions there's a lot of different
[51:41] details and aspects when it comes to
[51:43] these things that that we say well I
[51:45] like water and I want it to be uh spring
[51:48] water and I want it to be from the south
[51:50] and I want it to be in a glass bottle
[51:51] and I don't want it to be more than 8.6
[51:52] ounces and we have a lot of precise
[51:55] things that we have it's very
[51:57] complicated just try to go by anything
[51:59] anymore and there's just so many choices
[52:01] and so many different things being
[52:03] presented but Jesus has a way of
[52:06] simplifying everything down to one
[52:08] phrase seek ye first the kingdom of God
[52:11] all the different kind of water we can
[52:12] eat all the cereals we can have and
[52:15] everything that we might want to eat
[52:16] drink or be clothed with it says just
[52:17] seek ye first the kingdom of God and his
[52:20] righteousness and all these things shall
[52:22] be added unto you what are we talk what
[52:25] we believe God hides himself in
[52:27] Simplicity we believe that God hides
[52:30] himself in Simplicity therefore that's
[52:33] where we find God is in Simplicity and
[52:37] when our lives are full of all these
[52:38] different details and desires and things
[52:40] that he want then God is not in those
[52:43] things God is in the Simplicity and the
[52:45] single the simple things and the
[52:47] ultimate Simplicity that we could have
[52:49] is when all of our desires are reduced
[52:51] to one right look at that the the Tim
[52:55] ultimate Simplicity is to have one
[52:57] desire and someone says well what do you
[52:59] desire above everything else well I want
[53:01] to have this I want to have that I want
[53:02] to have this I want to have that well
[53:03] that that that makes life complicated at
[53:04] worst life is complex in itself and then
[53:06] we just complicate it but the ultimate
[53:09] Simplicity would have desires reduced to
[53:11] one David says one thing have I desired
[53:13] Lord that will I seek after Jesus says
[53:15] well your heavenly father knows you need
[53:17] to eat you need to drink you need to be
[53:19] cloth knows that you need a car knows
[53:20] that you need jobs know that you need
[53:21] all these things but just simplify all
[53:24] your desires to to
[53:26] one simplified to one seek ye first the
[53:29] kingdom of
[53:30] God our ultimate aspiration to be
[53:33] focused on a singular objective one
[53:36] thing have I
[53:38] desired and I'll say this and I want to
[53:40] be very deliberate how I say it because
[53:42] this would be to me this would be one of
[53:43] those things if you could get this you
[53:45] could get this part out of this service
[53:47] it would serve you well but as we live
[53:50] life should be the process of
[53:52] determining value True Value which leads
[53:56] us to
[53:57] Simplicity that as we live life should
[53:59] be the process as each day goes by and
[54:01] week goes by and month goes by and years
[54:03] go by and decades go by that life should
[54:05] be the process of determining those
[54:07] things that are truly valuable things
[54:10] that are of actual worth and that leads
[54:12] us to make decisions to simplify our
[54:15] lives that make sense yes that we should
[54:18] we should have that maturing process in
[54:20] our lives where we're able to say you
[54:22] know that doesn't matter that doesn't
[54:24] really matter doesn't matter as much as
[54:26] it used to matter and we have this as we
[54:28] grow life becomes this process of
[54:30] learning what counts and what matters
[54:32] and what really is important to us and
[54:34] because we recognize the things that are
[54:36] important we begin to simplify our lives
[54:38] around that because we could be honest I
[54:41] think in the day and age that we're
[54:42] living in we just get spread so thin I
[54:45] found myself thinking a lot about a
[54:46] subject on uh you know certain
[54:49] particular subject I was like man I I
[54:50] want to preach that I want to preach
[54:52] that and I thought I think I preached
[54:53] that last time I was here and and they
[54:55] would probably be thinking that I was
[54:56] losing my mind if I just preached the
[54:57] same thing over again and that'd be good
[54:59] because then you just probably pray for
[55:00] me more or pray for your pastor for
[55:03] asking me to preach I don't know how
[55:04] that would work necessarily but as we
[55:07] were talking before about how technology
[55:10] and uh video games and our cell phones
[55:13] and just everything's trying to grab our
[55:14] attention and get in our minds and
[55:16] things just aren't simple things are
[55:18] just very uh trying to grab our
[55:20] attention and get a click uh hook into
[55:23] our desires I think we're just really
[55:25] spread thin in a lot of ways so many
[55:28] things we got to click or we have to
[55:30] update things we have to check in on
[55:31] things that we need we need the
[55:32] information it needs to be fed and we
[55:34] have so many irons in the fire and we're
[55:36] probably thinking that H if I could just
[55:39] attain this then I'm going to be
[55:41] satisfied and we can stop right isn't
[55:44] that what we kind of all thought you
[55:45] know we go Blue we won the National
[55:48] Championship right you we did that right
[55:51] and we're going to be happy but now
[55:52] we're all like crazy about why not the
[55:54] lion are going to do it today and we're
[55:57] not satisfied and I promise you if the
[55:59] Lions win the Super Bowl you all are
[56:00] going to be talking about the Red
[56:02] Wings right because nothing ever
[56:06] satisfied nothing ever plates there's
[56:08] there's always going to be another
[56:09] season there's always going to be
[56:10] another sport there's always going to be
[56:11] another thing to well which president do
[56:13] we want to win who's going to get the
[56:14] nomination and I bring it up and surface
[56:17] it not just to be relevant about what's
[56:19] currently happening in your area but
[56:21] just to recognize that there's we have a
[56:22] lot of desires a lot of things that we
[56:24] look for things that make us happy irons
[56:27] in the fire and maybe think man that I
[56:29] don't even have time to think about the
[56:30] Lions then maybe in your life you're
[56:32] spread thin because you're managing a
[56:34] household you're working you're paying
[56:35] the bills you're looking after this
[56:37] you're looking after that and we find
[56:38] ourselves so spread thin that we have
[56:41] all these things that we're anxious
[56:43] about and that we care about and Jesus
[56:44] says reduce it all to
[56:48] one if I could put it this way in our
[56:50] youth and it was wonderful just to see
[56:52] these young people continuing to grow
[56:54] and get old older and sitting on the
[56:56] front row singing the songs those are
[56:57] the voices you hear when you stand up
[56:59] here in song service that in our youth
[57:01] there's many things that receive our
[57:03] investment there's things that we value
[57:05] things that we we give a lot of thought
[57:07] to things that we give a lot of time to
[57:09] and even as we begin to make money and
[57:11] our gift will invest a lot of money in
[57:13] certain things things that maybe adults
[57:15] would be like ah I don't know if I'd
[57:16] spend my money on that or I don't know
[57:17] if I'd spend my time on that but it's
[57:19] just it's peculiar and unique to our
[57:21] youth but a lot of things that we want
[57:23] to do things we want to experience and
[57:25] places we want to go Paul puts it this
[57:27] way when writing to Timothy flee also
[57:29] youthful lust in 2 Timothy 2:22 flee
[57:32] also youthful lust but follow
[57:34] righteousness Faith charity peace with
[57:37] them that call on the Lord out of a pure
[57:39] heart amen and when he calls it youthful
[57:42] lust he's show speaking of desires of a
[57:45] particular age I think by calling it
[57:48] youthful lust you can say there's things
[57:49] that are peculiar to young people
[57:52] there's things that they would desire
[57:53] things that they would want to do things
[57:54] that they might be challenged with and
[57:56] things that they might feel are
[57:58] important well I wish I could fit in or
[57:59] I want to do this or I I really like
[58:01] that and it's just indicative of their
[58:03] age whether it be a desire to fit in or
[58:06] their their passion meter is very very
[58:08] high and they don't really have maybe a
[58:10] lot of things putting that in check so
[58:11] there's a lot of things that they desire
[58:13] it's a lust a passion or craving uh the
[58:16] Bible the word that used is like an
[58:18] inflaming wine it's intoxicating it's a
[58:20] desire that influences judgment so it's
[58:23] a desire that's going to determine value
[58:25] but then it's also one that determines
[58:27] Behavior what you seek after am and Paul
[58:29] says flee youthful lust things that kind
[58:31] of intoxicate you and energize you and
[58:34] sensitize you to certain things to where
[58:36] you value it you want it so you're going
[58:37] to pursue after it say these are things
[58:39] that are peculiar to an age we might say
[58:42] the same thing as you get older that
[58:43] there's certain things that relate to uh
[58:45] to an age where maybe when you're at a
[58:48] particular age if you're told to take a
[58:50] nap you refuse and then as you get older
[58:52] there's a time in life where you wish
[58:54] you could take a nap
[58:55] nap and so it just shows that there's
[58:57] things that we value at different ages
[58:59] he said these youthful lust there's a
[59:01] lot of things that might intoxicate you
[59:03] a lot of things that inflame you a lot
[59:05] of things that you desire after he says
[59:06] but flee
[59:08] them and this question of flee and
[59:10] follow is a challenge to mature and
[59:14] maturity is not marked by physical
[59:16] development but by by spiritual maturity
[59:20] when he says oh uh uh flee and follow
[59:22] he's not saying that you're just going
[59:23] to reach a magic AG and all of a sudden
[59:25] youthful us don't matter anymore but
[59:27] there's a way that as we grow there
[59:29] should be a narrowing of desire and a
[59:32] zeroing in on value to one thing am you
[59:35] look at a 17year old and you say well I
[59:37] get it why they why they're in they have
[59:39] four or five different fantasy football
[59:41] teams and I get it while they they they
[59:43] they want to pursue this and they want
[59:44] to pursue that because it's just
[59:45] indicative of the age but if someone was
[59:48] you know 50 years old and they were
[59:50] playing video games all day long you
[59:52] might be like well you you begin to
[59:54] question have they learned anything in
[59:57] 50 years have they found and I guess if
[59:59] you're saying that they're a
[59:59] multi-millionaire because they play
[1:00:01] video games all day that's a separate
[1:00:02] discussion but there's things that we
[1:00:04] recognize have you determined value have
[1:00:07] you lived your life conscious enough and
[1:00:09] aware enough have you learned in life
[1:00:11] that there's certain things that have
[1:00:12] weight and things that have True Value
[1:00:14] and because you've determined value
[1:00:16] you've simplified your life to where
[1:00:18] those things that are truly valued are
[1:00:21] pursued or do you still just have all
[1:00:23] these love in these desires that drive
[1:00:26] you around Paul says in 1 Corinthians
[1:00:28] 13:11 when I was a child I spake as a
[1:00:31] child I understood as a child I thought
[1:00:34] as a child but when I became a man I put
[1:00:38] away childish
[1:00:41] things if I could if I want to say
[1:00:43] manhood because he says man but I could
[1:00:45] say adulthood or maturity adulthood is
[1:00:47] marked by becoming not
[1:00:51] aging if it was just aging we would all
[1:00:53] just age into manhood we would Age into
[1:00:56] adulthood but we don't have to think any
[1:00:58] further than The Neighbor Next Door to
[1:00:59] see somebody who no matter how old they
[1:01:01] are they're just not really mature right
[1:01:03] I just say that kind of as a way of
[1:01:05] easing the tension that well we're not
[1:01:06] talking about ourselves maybe we're
[1:01:07] talking about somebody we know but
[1:01:09] adulthood is marked by becoming and
[1:01:12] notice he says when I became a man so
[1:01:14] he's become a man says I put
[1:01:17] away so it was then he woke up one
[1:01:19] morning and all of a sudden his voice
[1:01:21] started cracking and he oh my goodness
[1:01:23] I'm becoming a man no whether he says he
[1:01:25] had to put something away when I became
[1:01:28] a man I put away childish things I put
[1:01:31] away childish desires I I put in check
[1:01:34] youthful lust I recognize yeah maybe
[1:01:36] there's this inclination but I'm going
[1:01:37] to bring that under
[1:01:39] subjection it's a conscious effort to
[1:01:41] say that I want to I recognize what true
[1:01:44] value is I recognize things that are
[1:01:46] important I recognize that there's
[1:01:48] certain things I pursue that bring me a
[1:01:50] real benefit in life and that benefit my
[1:01:52] family and benefit my well-being
[1:01:54] physically and emotionally and those are
[1:01:56] the things I want to have preeminence I
[1:01:57] want to pursue the things of God and
[1:02:00] nothing else because there's real value
[1:02:02] in this and begin to moderate desire in
[1:02:04] light of the one thing desired
[1:02:07] Hallelujah brother Brandon makes this
[1:02:09] statement in the sermon what hearest
[1:02:10] thou Elijah I think it's just real good
[1:02:12] as a challenging uh note I believe that
[1:02:14] we've been children long enough God's
[1:02:17] going to turn his church into manhood
[1:02:19] now so it's an hour of maturity and
[1:02:21] maybe there's been a a a childish child
[1:02:24] likeness to us he says and we played and
[1:02:26] frolicked as children but now we're
[1:02:28] going to have to put away childish
[1:02:30] things and take on manhood
[1:02:33] maturity notice again there there it
[1:02:35] almost implies as Paul says it even as
[1:02:38] he challenges Timothy and even as he
[1:02:40] says it himself when I was a child I I I
[1:02:43] spake as a child I understood as a child
[1:02:44] but when I became a man I put away
[1:02:47] childish things and then brother abam
[1:02:49] saying that we've got to put away
[1:02:50] childish things and and take on manhood
[1:02:53] it implies that there's some conscious
[1:02:55] effort on our part to recognize maturity
[1:02:58] to recognize things that are of higher
[1:03:01] importance and meaning recog not just
[1:03:03] desire but value something and say
[1:03:05] that's what I want to pursue am and I'm
[1:03:07] not going to pursue this so well do you
[1:03:09] like it do well you know I'm admit I I
[1:03:12] get a lot out of that it does a lot for
[1:03:13] my flesh or it's enjoyable whatever that
[1:03:16] might be there's this conscious decision
[1:03:18] where we put away some things and we
[1:03:20] take on one
[1:03:22] thing there's a poem that was written by
[1:03:25] William Wordsworth it's called Ode to
[1:03:27] duty it's quite a remarkable poem but as
[1:03:30] he's writing he makes the statement a a
[1:03:33] a and one of the stanzas he says I feel
[1:03:36] the weight of chance
[1:03:38] desires what a phrase the the weight I
[1:03:41] feel the weight of chance
[1:03:44] desires he's talking about Duty and he's
[1:03:46] bringing it within even a spiritual
[1:03:49] context but it was this phrase chance
[1:03:51] desires that really got my attention
[1:03:53] because the world is full of enticement
[1:03:54] ments kind of mention that to the young
[1:03:56] people there's ways that it just kind of
[1:03:57] gets in our minds and catches our
[1:03:58] attention a lot of things that other
[1:04:00] people are doing that we kind of have
[1:04:01] the pho where we we want to be what do
[1:04:03] what everyone else is doing and we want
[1:04:05] to we want to fit in we want to have the
[1:04:07] language we want to have the experience
[1:04:08] there's a the world is full of
[1:04:10] enticements and there's a lot of things
[1:04:12] that I would call indulgences of
[1:04:14] opportunity and if you don't know what
[1:04:16] I'm talking about it's those things that
[1:04:17] are available to us right at the point
[1:04:19] that we're checking out at a grocery
[1:04:21] store right you go to some electronic
[1:04:23] store you need to go in you need a new
[1:04:25] keyboard and and you get a keyboard and
[1:04:27] then they they funnel you down rows of
[1:04:30] candies and little gadgets and all sorts
[1:04:32] of $2 items and what are they want
[1:04:34] they're wanting you to indulge because
[1:04:36] of opportunity I went in to get a
[1:04:38] keyboard and I left with more calories
[1:04:40] and more sugar than I have in my pantry
[1:04:42] back home at an electronic store why
[1:04:44] because there's certain things that they
[1:04:46] want you to indulge because of
[1:04:48] opportunity this is what this writer is
[1:04:50] talking about I feel the weight of
[1:04:51] chance desires the impulse buys
[1:04:54] to where there's always something that
[1:04:56] we can click on there's always something
[1:04:58] that we can buy and on sale and do it
[1:05:00] now and there's a timer right you better
[1:05:03] you better click now I remember one time
[1:05:05] and sister Elizabeth you shouldn't have
[1:05:06] laughed because I know what you're
[1:05:07] thinking about and I'm thinking about
[1:05:08] the same thing we were I was out
[1:05:10] preaching it was one of the first places
[1:05:11] we went and ministered I think after we
[1:05:13] were married a and I went into the
[1:05:15] bathroom and I came out and Elizabeth
[1:05:17] had in the time that I went to the
[1:05:19] bathroom she had bought something that
[1:05:20] she saw at infomercial on the television
[1:05:22] for because they said Act
[1:05:24] now right that's what that's what that's
[1:05:27] what happens when you raise a girl who's
[1:05:28] never watched Television right she
[1:05:30] doesn't know that this this is on all
[1:05:32] the time this price is going to be there
[1:05:34] not just in five minutes but five years
[1:05:36] from now but they do it because they
[1:05:38] create some sort of sense of urgency I
[1:05:41] better click I better buy this now
[1:05:42] because if I don't buy this in the next
[1:05:44] 20 minutes I can't get it in two hours
[1:05:45] with Amazon Prime and so you go ahead
[1:05:48] and buy it and then you realize no I got
[1:05:50] to add a few more items to it to get to
[1:05:53] $25 in order to get it on time and what
[1:05:55] are these are impulse buys because
[1:05:58] that's the way the mind works it's the
[1:05:59] way the body can be dragged around
[1:06:01] impulse buys chance desires as this poet
[1:06:05] put it I feel the weight of chance
[1:06:08] desires notice it's the chance and it's
[1:06:12] plural
[1:06:13] desires things that are opportunistic
[1:06:16] just by chance just by
[1:06:18] circumstance but David isn't being he's
[1:06:21] not putting it to chance about what he
[1:06:23] desired he said one thing have I desired
[1:06:25] that will I seek after has nothing that
[1:06:27] nothing to do with chance that's right
[1:06:29] in 1 Peter chapter 2:2 it says as
[1:06:31] newborn
[1:06:33] babes desire the sincere milk of the
[1:06:35] word that you may grow
[1:06:38] thereby this kind of gives
[1:06:40] us uh the proper aim amen as Paul says
[1:06:45] it to Timothy as Paul says it about
[1:06:47] himself as brother brandham even
[1:06:48] remarked about the church as it relates
[1:06:50] to maybe a church age and a growing that
[1:06:53] we ought to become to take on maturity
[1:06:56] put away immaturity Peter says he
[1:07:00] acknowledges the youth and says as
[1:07:01] newborn babes so he's acknowledging
[1:07:04] compulsion in our youth and desires that
[1:07:06] we might have of a particular age but he
[1:07:08] says as newborn babes who might put
[1:07:11] anything in their mouth might reach for
[1:07:13] anything and do anything he says desire
[1:07:15] the sincere milk of the word that you
[1:07:16] may grow thereby despite our youthful
[1:07:20] compulsion within despite maybe all the
[1:07:22] things that catch our attention it's
[1:07:24] asking us to simplify our desires to one
[1:07:26] thing desire the milk of the
[1:07:29] word brother bramman the sermon God
[1:07:32] hided himself in Simplicity then
[1:07:33] revealed himself in the same remember
[1:07:35] the ultimate Simplicity would be to have
[1:07:37] our desires reduced to one says many
[1:07:40] times teenage children and sometimes
[1:07:41] adults will get to you know young people
[1:07:44] pass a note or cut up or something in
[1:07:46] church says now you're old enough to
[1:07:49] know better than that you should know
[1:07:51] better than that and if you saw a little
[1:07:53] fivey year old doing it you'd say well
[1:07:55] you know that's what 5-year-olds do if
[1:07:57] you see somebody doodling and drawing
[1:07:58] and doing pictures and you look over
[1:08:00] there and say well that's an
[1:08:01] eight-year-old they said that would that
[1:08:02] would make sense but if that was the
[1:08:05] pastor like brother John I didn't know
[1:08:07] you were such an artist right what what
[1:08:09] is what's in his mind or even your
[1:08:11] parents if you look over your parents
[1:08:12] are writing their grocery list out or
[1:08:14] they're they're they're uh they're doing
[1:08:15] Wordle right there in church or
[1:08:17] something and you'd be like well where's
[1:08:19] their mind at what do they value and we
[1:08:22] and you would you but for if it was a
[1:08:24] kid doing oh you know that's kind of
[1:08:25] what kidss do and kids struggle with
[1:08:27] that and that but brother B saying
[1:08:28] there's a point where we ought to know
[1:08:31] better I want you to think of that the
[1:08:33] Simplicity of life that there's things
[1:08:34] that get our attention things that we
[1:08:36] might do pass notes cut up do something
[1:08:38] he's using church as an example he says
[1:08:41] you're old enough to know better you
[1:08:42] should know better than that he says if
[1:08:44] you expect to be a real man someday and
[1:08:46] raise a family to the kingdom of God
[1:08:48] then start it off in the beginning and
[1:08:49] act right and do right and there's the
[1:08:52] challenge to even and young people the
[1:08:54] challenge to young men even those four
[1:08:56] sitting here on the front row and the
[1:08:57] young ladies that are here that even in
[1:08:59] my youth and I might have a lot of
[1:09:00] things that I want to do a lot of things
[1:09:02] I want to pursue that there has to be
[1:09:04] this acknowledgement that as life
[1:09:06] continues life needs to be my desires
[1:09:09] need to be reduced to one and right now
[1:09:12] begin to pursue and seek the right
[1:09:14] things desire the sincere milk of the
[1:09:17] word we ought to know better if we want
[1:09:20] to be mature one day we want to be
[1:09:21] successful spiritually I'd even argue if
[1:09:23] you want to have integrity and do right
[1:09:25] even as a decent human being you got to
[1:09:27] start off right in the beginning act
[1:09:29] right and do
[1:09:30] right Paul said in Philippians chapter
[1:09:32] 3: 7 and 8 but what things were gained
[1:09:34] to me those I counted loss for Christ ye
[1:09:39] doubtless and I count all things but
[1:09:40] lost for the Excellency of the knowledge
[1:09:43] of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've
[1:09:46] suffered the loss of all things and do
[1:09:48] count them but dung that I may win
[1:09:50] Christ Noti that in time Paul at one
[1:09:54] point might have thought it it was great
[1:09:56] gain to understand the scriptures as he
[1:09:58] did it's great gain to be taught by the
[1:10:00] teachers that he was taught under great
[1:10:02] gain to be able to distinguish a a true
[1:10:05] Zeal and these different things that he
[1:10:06] thought might have thought were ex uh uh
[1:10:09] excellent to him and set him apart and
[1:10:11] Paul in some place just gives his resume
[1:10:12] hey Pharisee of the Pharisees and this
[1:10:14] and that and there were things that were
[1:10:16] gained to him that he had accumulated
[1:10:18] through life but now he comes to a place
[1:10:20] in life and says all the accolades all
[1:10:22] the things that could have accompass all
[1:10:24] the things I've accumulated I count them
[1:10:26] lost for Christ he had reduced it down
[1:10:28] to one thing that was gain and looked at
[1:10:31] everything else and said yeah you know
[1:10:32] what the trophies and and the ribbons
[1:10:34] and the badges and the and the high
[1:10:36] scores and all the accolades and all the
[1:10:38] popularity and all the wealth and all
[1:10:39] the fame I counted but lost that I might
[1:10:42] know Christ and that I may win Christ
[1:10:46] yes life had been simplified to one
[1:10:49] Pursuit life had been simplified to one
[1:10:51] desire do you want to memorize this do
[1:10:53] you want to compass that do you want to
[1:10:54] do this do you want said no I want to
[1:10:56] win
[1:10:58] Christ one
[1:11:00] thing Matthew chapter 6 we'll start with
[1:11:03] verse 19 I'd like to end up on verse 24
[1:11:06] we might jump around a few things as we
[1:11:08] go through
[1:11:16] this he says in Matthew 6: 19 lay not up
[1:11:20] for yourselves Treasures upon Earth
[1:11:22] where moth and r doth corrupt and where
[1:11:24] thieves break through and
[1:11:27] still he talks about Earthly Treasures
[1:11:30] lay up not for yourselves Treasures upon
[1:11:33] Earth these Earthly Treasures it's a
[1:11:35] just the storage of good and precious
[1:11:38] things and and and applies kind of a
[1:11:40] hoarding of
[1:11:42] valuables and he brings a lot into this
[1:11:45] as Jesus has already said or will say
[1:11:48] speaks of what we shall eat what we
[1:11:50] shall drink and what we shall be clothed
[1:11:51] with he touches on all of it right here
[1:11:53] here where moth and rust do corrupt and
[1:11:56] where thieves break through and still
[1:11:58] The Moth relates to the things that we
[1:12:00] would wear the garments that we would
[1:12:01] clothe ourselves with the rust the word
[1:12:04] that's used there isn't that of metals
[1:12:05] but that of food that would perish and
[1:12:08] corrupt and he says that thieves break
[1:12:10] through and still it' be the the gold
[1:12:12] the jewelry the finery of Life he's
[1:12:15] bringing us he's kind of laying the
[1:12:16] ground for what he says in verses 31 and
[1:12:18] 32 the things that perish the things
[1:12:21] that are unstable the things that are
[1:12:22] always changing
[1:12:24] well they're not constant they're not
[1:12:25] sure lay up not for yourselves Treasures
[1:12:27] upon Earth if it's clothing The Moth can
[1:12:30] eat it if it's food it it's gonna uh
[1:12:33] it's G to corrupt it's gonna it's going
[1:12:35] to expire and if you even think about it
[1:12:38] when it comes to food I I've noticed
[1:12:40] this and I just kind of comment on it
[1:12:42] that there's some foods that we could
[1:12:43] really really like and you know what
[1:12:45] given enough time sometimes it just
[1:12:47] disappears they just stop making it what
[1:12:49] do you mean the MC rib is gone I can't
[1:12:51] have a MC rib yeah they just stopped
[1:12:52] serving it Taco Bell just says you know
[1:12:54] what we're not serving tacos anymore
[1:12:56] there's too many tacos everywhere we
[1:12:58] want to do something different and just
[1:13:00] overnight your favorite thing can be
[1:13:01] gone so there's a lot greater
[1:13:03] application to this than sometimes we
[1:13:05] think there's things we wear things that
[1:13:07] we eat things that we buy thevs can come
[1:13:09] through and take it and steal
[1:13:11] it these are things that are not stable
[1:13:13] there's these are things that are not
[1:13:15] consonant they're not
[1:13:16] sure brother Brahman the sermon
[1:13:18] handwriting on the wall says as the
[1:13:20] Gentile age was issued into rotness and
[1:13:22] drinking and women and carousing Gentile
[1:13:25] dispensation going out in the same
[1:13:26] manner we're going out to chaos from
[1:13:28] drinking and drunken our little teenage
[1:13:31] children out here in school they start
[1:13:33] them off with smoking cigarettes and
[1:13:35] they go from there to
[1:13:37] marijuana I know that's maybe that might
[1:13:39] be a little oldfashioned just to talk
[1:13:41] about it but look where we
[1:13:43] are that that brother bradam is
[1:13:46] identifying maybe what we would call a
[1:13:47] gateway drug where there's certain
[1:13:49] habits and certain things we establish
[1:13:51] in life that just make it easier to do
[1:13:53] the next thing certain patterns and
[1:13:56] certain things we reach for and certain
[1:13:57] things that we ingest or we we vocalize
[1:14:00] or that we enjoy and he saying hey you
[1:14:01] know what they start smoking cigarettes
[1:14:03] but then cigarettes that you know that
[1:14:05] becomes Blas and that that's not good
[1:14:07] enough you got to move on to the next
[1:14:08] one why because the eye is never
[1:14:10] satisfied with seeing or the ear with
[1:14:12] hearing there's always going to be a
[1:14:13] little bit more that the body desires
[1:14:15] and craves and there's things that are
[1:14:17] related to this age desires that we
[1:14:19] pursue and say well is it going to stop
[1:14:21] there is it enough that Miss won a
[1:14:23] national championship no it's not enough
[1:14:25] let's just be
[1:14:27] honest right we want more and I'm
[1:14:30] talking about in a family where our
[1:14:31] favorite baseball team won the World
[1:14:34] Series right first time ever in
[1:14:37] franchise history and you think you know
[1:14:38] what shut it down let's go home we're
[1:14:40] finished right we've climbed to the top
[1:14:42] of the mountain we planted our flag
[1:14:44] we're World Series champions as a family
[1:14:46] we can just coast and go forward in life
[1:14:49] not worrying about sports but the next
[1:14:51] thing you know it's like yeah but you
[1:14:52] know what Michigan plays Ohio State
[1:14:55] right all of a sudden the stakes have
[1:14:57] never been higher but it's the things
[1:14:59] that work within our conscience and our
[1:15:01] hearts and our fleshly desires and we
[1:15:03] find that there's more than just one
[1:15:05] thing
[1:15:06] desired and nothing in this life ever
[1:15:09] satisfies because I promise
[1:15:12] you the Lombardi trophy will only be a
[1:15:15] gateway to the Stanley
[1:15:18] Cup right you think Detroit's going to
[1:15:21] go crazy if Detroit wins if if the red
[1:15:23] wings are still in it right there's
[1:15:26] going to be more octopus thrown under
[1:15:28] the
[1:15:29] ice right it might actually become
[1:15:33] hockey town
[1:15:34] again because you it never stops when
[1:15:37] our desires are on so many different
[1:15:40] things so Jesus says lay not up for
[1:15:42] yourselves
[1:15:43] Treasures upon Earth but he says in
[1:15:45] verse 20 but lay up for yourselves
[1:15:47] Treasures in Heaven and he says where
[1:15:50] moth nor rust doth corrupt where thieves
[1:15:53] do not break through nor to steal he
[1:15:55] takes it as the opposite of those things
[1:15:57] that are merely Earthly and I believe
[1:16:00] he's doing this deliberately he wants us
[1:16:01] to think of uh things that moth can eat
[1:16:04] and rust can corrupt and thieves can
[1:16:06] steal to where it's related to an
[1:16:07] Earthly realm that's subject to Earthly
[1:16:09] elements and Earthly desires and Earthly
[1:16:11] temperaments and changes he says but lay
[1:16:13] up for yourselves Treasures in Heaven
[1:16:16] for now I'm I'm looking beyond the flesh
[1:16:18] I'm looking Beyond natural desires and
[1:16:21] and I'm not just merely Earthly but now
[1:16:22] I'm thinking of things that are more
[1:16:24] eternal in Luke 12:33 says sell all sell
[1:16:30] that you have and give alms this
[1:16:33] phrasing is just so awesome provide
[1:16:35] yourselves bags which wax not old a
[1:16:39] treasure in the heavens that faileth not
[1:16:41] where no Thief approaches neither moth
[1:16:43] corrupted this is the the wording in
[1:16:45] Luke chapter 12 sell that you have give
[1:16:48] arms provide yourselves bags which wax
[1:16:52] not old a treasure in the heavens that
[1:16:55] faileth not where no Thief approacheth
[1:16:56] nor moth corrup it's a this is a
[1:17:00] challenge to them in that moment to have
[1:17:03] a shift in values amen that well we're
[1:17:07] worried about what we're going to eat
[1:17:08] we're worried about what we're going to
[1:17:09] wear we're worried about what we're
[1:17:10] going to drink we're worried about
[1:17:11] whether or not we're going to win the
[1:17:12] game we're worried about whether or not
[1:17:14] economics are going to go this way we're
[1:17:15] worried about who's going to have the
[1:17:16] nomination we're worried about this
[1:17:17] worried about that and I said shouldn't
[1:17:19] you be worried about something
[1:17:21] else should is isn't there something
[1:17:24] greater than all this that ought to put
[1:17:26] everything else in
[1:17:28] perspective says in Luke 12:3 and one of
[1:17:31] the company said unto him this is kind
[1:17:33] of how he's arriving at this very
[1:17:34] compliment Master speak to my brother
[1:17:36] that he divide the inheritance with me
[1:17:39] and he said unto him man who made me a
[1:17:41] judge or divider over you and he said
[1:17:44] unto them because here's this fixation
[1:17:45] on am I going to get my inheritance am I
[1:17:47] going to is it going to be left to me is
[1:17:49] my sister going to get it is it my
[1:17:50] brother going to get it who's going to
[1:17:52] get this who's going to that help
[1:17:53] resolve these natural things he says
[1:17:55] take heed and beware of covetousness for
[1:17:58] a man's life consisteth not in the
[1:18:00] abundance of things which he possesses
[1:18:02] and he spake a parable unto them saying
[1:18:04] the ground of a certain rich man brought
[1:18:05] forth plentifully and he thought within
[1:18:08] himself saying what shall I do because I
[1:18:09] have no room where to bestow my fruits
[1:18:12] now he he had certain uh silos or or
[1:18:17] barns or Grainer to where he would store
[1:18:19] his Harvest and it was adequate for all
[1:18:23] prior Harvest and it would meet his
[1:18:24] needs and it was sufficient as a a
[1:18:26] businessman he knew that if I could
[1:18:28] store this it's going to bring me the
[1:18:30] the means that I need I'm going to be a
[1:18:31] the barter I'm be to live off of it this
[1:18:32] is good but then he he has the land does
[1:18:35] exceptionally well beyond what he had
[1:18:37] done before and he realizes once I
[1:18:39] harvest all this I'm not going to be
[1:18:40] able to fit it all in the barns that I
[1:18:42] have built and he said this will I do
[1:18:45] I'll pull down my Barns and build
[1:18:47] greater and there will I bestow all my
[1:18:50] fruits and my goods and I will say to my
[1:18:53] soul soul that should have told us
[1:18:55] something's off this guy Soul speaks to
[1:18:58] himself Soul thou Hast much Goods laid
[1:19:00] up for many years take thine ease eat
[1:19:02] drink and be
[1:19:03] married and we might think this is a guy
[1:19:06] who's being prudent he he's putting
[1:19:07] things together for his retirement he's
[1:19:09] watching out for his future but there
[1:19:11] was something wrong about his desires
[1:19:13] because God then rebukes him saying thou
[1:19:15] fool this night thy Soul shall be
[1:19:18] required of thee then who shall these
[1:19:21] those things be which thou has provided
[1:19:24] so is he that layeth up Treasures for
[1:19:26] himself and is not rich toward
[1:19:30] God recognize what Jesus is talking
[1:19:32] about lay up not for yourselves
[1:19:34] Treasures upon Earth it's the hoarding
[1:19:36] of values the accumulation of wealth and
[1:19:38] assets a a and the the idea I recognized
[1:19:42] it for myself that even for years there
[1:19:44] was the you know I wanted to have if I
[1:19:47] wanted to have a charger in my room and
[1:19:49] I wanted that one to stay there because
[1:19:51] I want to be able to charge my phone in
[1:19:52] my room and so I wanted to have one for
[1:19:54] when I traveled and so if I traveled and
[1:19:57] I wanted to have one that I could keep
[1:19:58] stationary where I was traveling if I
[1:20:00] stayed in a in a barn or staying in a a
[1:20:02] hotel I wanted to have a charger there
[1:20:04] and then I needed one for the car just
[1:20:06] in case and so it's not just good enough
[1:20:08] to have one charging cable and a
[1:20:11] charging Breck you needed to have at
[1:20:12] least three and then you know you need
[1:20:13] some backups right right redundancy
[1:20:17] isn't that you know the great thing we
[1:20:18] need today is redundancy and so there's
[1:20:21] this thing where you just you have so
[1:20:22] many different cables and then you just
[1:20:24] you have one device that uses this one
[1:20:25] you have another one that uses that one
[1:20:26] and you have you have three different
[1:20:28] kind of cables so you have three three
[1:20:30] three kind of sounds scriptural all of a
[1:20:32] sudden and you've got all these
[1:20:33] different cables everywhere and you
[1:20:35] realize man I this is never going to
[1:20:39] end because we need I need to have this
[1:20:41] one I have that one and you're never
[1:20:42] satisfied with just the one and being
[1:20:44] wise with that one and and teaching
[1:20:46] yourself to remember and if you're going
[1:20:48] to have the one you use that you travel
[1:20:50] with it you don't forget it and you know
[1:20:51] what really at the end of the day if you
[1:20:52] forget it how much does it cost anymore
[1:20:54] I think you can get it for 50 cents down
[1:20:56] that aisle of compulsion
[1:21:00] right but there's just this accumulation
[1:21:03] this hoarding of
[1:21:05] things and this man who had enough as he
[1:21:09] always had when he got more instead of
[1:21:11] saying you know what I have more to give
[1:21:14] now and be rich towards God instead of
[1:21:18] just towards
[1:21:19] myself instead of recognizing man I've
[1:21:22] been blessed I want to hoard this and I
[1:21:23] want to I want to be stingy with this
[1:21:25] and I'm going to keep this oh what a
[1:21:26] windfall and I'm going to use it to
[1:21:28] myself and tear down perfectly good
[1:21:29] barns build bigger ones just so he can
[1:21:32] say soul we've done really good we can
[1:21:34] just relax and feed off of what we have
[1:21:36] here I I've made enough to where I can
[1:21:38] just coast and instead of saying you
[1:21:40] know what why don't I take my excess and
[1:21:42] give to the house of the Lord why don't
[1:21:43] I give it says nothing of even his
[1:21:46] tithing
[1:21:47] here why don't I give be rich towards
[1:21:50] the Lord be rich towards God
[1:21:53] Jesus said give and it shall be given
[1:21:55] unto you and he uses this phrase in Luke
[1:21:58] chapter 6 good measure pressed down and
[1:22:00] shaken together and running over shall
[1:22:02] men give into your bosom with the same
[1:22:04] measure that you met with all it shall
[1:22:05] be measured to you again know words God
[1:22:08] is inviting us to give with the promise
[1:22:11] that if we give and are rich towards God
[1:22:14] and we give for his sake there's a
[1:22:16] reward in that giving and then the
[1:22:18] reward even for this man if if we even
[1:22:20] took that principle he says man my land
[1:22:23] is given plentifully beyond what I've
[1:22:25] ever received before and he was to give
[1:22:28] whatever measure he gave he's going to
[1:22:30] get that and more right CU God says your
[1:22:33] reward is pressed down shaken together
[1:22:36] running over in other words you're not
[1:22:37] going to be
[1:22:38] cheated it's not going to kind of be put
[1:22:40] in there in such a way to where why we
[1:22:42] just kind of shift this around and make
[1:22:43] it look like it's full do you know what
[1:22:45] the whole purpose behind an ice cream
[1:22:47] scoop is for you ever thought about it
[1:22:49] and one person knows someone likes ice
[1:22:51] cream you take a true ice cream scoop it
[1:22:54] rolls the ice cream up in such a way
[1:22:56] where it makes it look a little bit
[1:22:58] Fuller and it's going to fill up a cup a
[1:23:00] lot faster than if you just used a
[1:23:02] regular sco spoon and chunked it out
[1:23:04] there's a tip Jack don't use the ice
[1:23:06] cream scoop you'll get more ice cream in
[1:23:08] your
[1:23:09] bowl but the scoop is there for the
[1:23:11] purpose of creating this illusion that
[1:23:13] I've got a whole cup but really it's
[1:23:16] just rolled together there's enough
[1:23:17] space and distance it's not very dense
[1:23:19] and so this is what Jesus is referring
[1:23:21] to that you're going to get back but
[1:23:22] it's not going to be scooped out in such
[1:23:24] a way to where you realize like some
[1:23:26] cups or glasses get narrower and
[1:23:28] narrower and you think oh man this is
[1:23:29] there's a lot in this but it's really
[1:23:31] really thick glass it has a false bottom
[1:23:33] in it you ever bought like a bucket of
[1:23:35] popcorn you're like man I'm be eating on
[1:23:36] this for days and there's a false bottom
[1:23:39] like that leaves this much out of it you
[1:23:41] jam your figure digging into it because
[1:23:44] it's an
[1:23:45] illusion but he says God is going to
[1:23:48] give back pressed down shaken together
[1:23:51] running over to where he's not going to
[1:23:53] cheat you amen if they're rich towards
[1:23:56] God we give in other words I can say
[1:23:58] give to the measure that you desire to
[1:24:00] receive from God that's and sometimes we
[1:24:02] complain about what we're getting back
[1:24:04] from God when we're not even bothering
[1:24:06] to give to
[1:24:11] him we ought to use this principle you
[1:24:15] saying here give
[1:24:16] alms give that which is
[1:24:18] beyond exactly what Jesus saying give
[1:24:21] alms as he's relating there to ma
[1:24:23] Matthew chapter 6 give arms provide
[1:24:24] yourselves bags which wax not old it's
[1:24:27] quite a
[1:24:28] statement but he says give beyond that
[1:24:30] which is what what you need and what's
[1:24:32] for your own
[1:24:33] support this man knew he had good land
[1:24:35] he knew that he could do he could work
[1:24:37] hard and get another Harvest and maybe
[1:24:38] if he worked hard he could get another
[1:24:41] harvest the equal to that one maybe
[1:24:43] build another barn in the offseason give
[1:24:45] what he has but instead he tore good
[1:24:47] ones down hoarded it all to himself and
[1:24:49] Jesus says give
[1:24:50] alms if you have well and we know that
[1:24:53] we're taught that we ought to give I
[1:24:54] like how One Pastor put it he's passed
[1:24:57] away but he says when God asked for our
[1:24:59] 10% that's what he requires you haven't
[1:25:01] even started giving until you get beyond
[1:25:04] the 10% I thought well that's
[1:25:05] interesting hey because that's his
[1:25:08] that's what he asked back you haven't
[1:25:09] even started to give until you've given
[1:25:10] back his but well that's kind of good
[1:25:13] maybe you'll use it I don't know but I
[1:25:14] like to look at it as it's all gods he
[1:25:16] just ask for 10%
[1:25:18] back and it's our duty to give we have a
[1:25:21] duty to to be rich towards God to not
[1:25:25] just lay up Treasures for ourselves to
[1:25:27] not be worried about our retirement to
[1:25:29] not be worried about these other extra
[1:25:31] things but can I reduce my desires to
[1:25:33] one and be obedient to the things that
[1:25:35] God has asked us to do knowing that he's
[1:25:37] promised that he'll provide for us
[1:25:40] Proverbs says he that hath pity upon the
[1:25:42] poor lendeth unto the Lord and that
[1:25:44] which he hath given will he pay him
[1:25:47] again do you recognize what the Bible is
[1:25:50] telling us so is he that layeth up
[1:25:51] treasure for himself and is not rich
[1:25:53] towards God if we do what we ought to do
[1:25:55] in giving back to God whether it be
[1:25:57] through our tithes our offerings and our
[1:25:59] missions which are all three separate
[1:26:00] things which we should know that that
[1:26:02] our tithing goes to the ministry it's to
[1:26:04] the pastor our offerings are separate
[1:26:06] and distinct from that and then missions
[1:26:07] giving is different from our tithes and
[1:26:09] our offerings that if we're given in
[1:26:12] these things we're we're lending unto
[1:26:14] the Lord and he says that he'll give to
[1:26:16] us he'll pay us
[1:26:20] again it's a it's a paradigm sh shift in
[1:26:23] values provide yourselves bags which
[1:26:25] whack not
[1:26:27] old it's the idea that you're just
[1:26:30] putting money in the bag over and over
[1:26:32] again and ha Hagi chapter 1 verses 3 and
[1:26:35] four I just want to I guess I don't know
[1:26:38] where I'm at in my time I could go by
[1:26:41] Arizona time and we have in fact not
[1:26:44] even
[1:26:46] started but in in
[1:26:50] Hagi it says
[1:26:52] quite a remarkable scripture reading if
[1:26:55] you want to read chapter one maybe more
[1:26:57] detail I'll just make reference to he
[1:26:58] says then came the word of the Lord by
[1:27:00] Hai the prophet saying is it time for
[1:27:02] you oh ye to dwell in your sealed houses
[1:27:05] and this house lie
[1:27:08] waste if you go back and read it the
[1:27:11] word of the Lord is rebuking Israel for
[1:27:12] living in fixed permanent dwellings that
[1:27:15] are sealed say Wayne's coating beadboard
[1:27:19] right the crown molding is up the new
[1:27:21] hardw for wood floors are in and it's
[1:27:23] it's being the amenities are getting
[1:27:25] better and the Furnishings are getting
[1:27:27] better and they're they're improving
[1:27:28] their dwellings and it's not just a
[1:27:30] place to lay their head now it's getting
[1:27:32] more fancy to say you dwell in your
[1:27:33] sealed houses but then the house of the
[1:27:36] Lord was being
[1:27:38] wasted and you your your house your
[1:27:41] living conditions your car your clothes
[1:27:43] what you eat what you drink and your
[1:27:45] house is getting better and better but
[1:27:47] the house of the Lord is in disrepair
[1:27:49] the things of God are being
[1:27:50] neglected and and this admonition to the
[1:27:54] people of Israel and the instructions
[1:27:56] that's given if you want to go back and
[1:27:57] read more in Hagi kind of laying out a
[1:27:59] real practical principle even for us
[1:28:02] personally things to consider for
[1:28:04] ourselves because he asked multiple
[1:28:05] places in chapter one consider your ways
[1:28:08] you're living in nice houses driving
[1:28:10] nice cars eating good things wearing
[1:28:12] nice clothes but what about the things
[1:28:13] of God Ponder your path your direction
[1:28:16] the things that take up your time your
[1:28:17] manner your habit the way that you're
[1:28:19] going what path are you pursuing what
[1:28:21] things are you seeking after what has
[1:28:23] your conduct LED you to what's your
[1:28:26] priority what are your
[1:28:28] goals and here God was correcting their
[1:28:30] passion correcting their one thing
[1:28:32] desired David said one thing have I
[1:28:34] desired Lord that will I seek after that
[1:28:36] I may dwell in the house of Lord all the
[1:28:38] days of my life and haggi says wait you
[1:28:41] dwell in sealed houses and the house of
[1:28:43] God lies in
[1:28:44] waste he was correcting their
[1:28:47] Vision they were not deliberate in their
[1:28:49] actions they were not considering God in
[1:28:51] them living with the wrong priorities
[1:28:53] and goals and he says you dwell in
[1:28:56] sealed houses Jesus says provide
[1:28:59] yourselves bags which wax not old this
[1:29:02] is a kind of a if I could say this this
[1:29:04] is what they're
[1:29:06] doing is a sealed house I guess in my
[1:29:10] mind maybe sometimes you you you maybe
[1:29:13] visit a house maybe you're looking for a
[1:29:14] house whether you're renting or buying
[1:29:15] and a house is listed maybe just looking
[1:29:17] at the pictures or or you visit and you
[1:29:19] go into the shag carpet in the master B
[1:29:23] bathroom and and you're horrified right
[1:29:25] initi you're just kind of horrified like
[1:29:27] what what were they thinking but you
[1:29:28] know at one time somebody thought that
[1:29:30] was an
[1:29:31] upgrade there was a there's some houses
[1:29:34] you walk into and you see all the the
[1:29:35] panel board and you see certain things
[1:29:37] and lolium and you know there and you're
[1:29:40] like you're horrified but at one time
[1:29:44] that was the right like honey I got
[1:29:48] lolium look at the new wallpaper we got
[1:29:51] look at this nice wood paneling that we
[1:29:53] got on the walls I got shag carpet in
[1:29:56] the master bathroom and this they going
[1:29:59] oh wow isn't this great give us some
[1:30:01] time it's outdated it's not
[1:30:04] fashionable and this G exactly what
[1:30:06] Jesus is saying bags with W not old this
[1:30:09] in other words he's referring to money
[1:30:10] that's hoarded in bags that eventually
[1:30:13] the bags the you're just hoarding it the
[1:30:15] bags rot
[1:30:16] through and the money in there's a value
[1:30:19] and but the bag you're putting it just
[1:30:20] rots through it gets out there's holes
[1:30:22] in it so Hagi comes to the same thing in
[1:30:25] verse six ye sow much and bring in
[1:30:27] little you eat but you have not enough
[1:30:29] you drink but you're not filled with
[1:30:31] drink now remember he rebuked them they
[1:30:32] have sealed houses but the house of God
[1:30:35] lays in waste he's making a direct
[1:30:36] connection to where where they spent
[1:30:38] their time and their money what their
[1:30:40] desires and how it reflecting the fact
[1:30:41] that they're never actually satisfied
[1:30:43] they sew a lot but they bring in little
[1:30:45] they have they they eat but they don't
[1:30:46] have enough they drink but they're not F
[1:30:48] drink you clothe but there's none warm
[1:30:49] notice how much it answers to Matthew 6
[1:30:52] yes but there's none warm and he that
[1:31:20] earnthenecklace
[1:31:22] we could spend more time in this but the
[1:31:25] lesson is don't prefer convenience and
[1:31:28] temporal enjoyment over God's
[1:31:31] will they would get their money and they
[1:31:33] would save it they'd be they'd Pat the
[1:31:35] bag glad to know that they had the money
[1:31:38] they lived in sealed houses but they
[1:31:40] were preferring just the convenience and
[1:31:42] Temple enjoyments over doing God's
[1:31:45] work if they were to have real Comfort
[1:31:47] real enjoyment they were going to sew
[1:31:49] and reap if they were going to have
[1:31:51] enough if they were going to drink and
[1:31:52] be filled if they were going to be
[1:31:54] clothed and be warm then they had to put
[1:31:58] God
[1:32:00] first otherwise anything we try to gain
[1:32:02] is just like putting money in a bag with
[1:32:05] holes not going to use it or in the end
[1:32:08] we're just going to come up
[1:32:13] empty you SE much and bring in little
[1:32:16] you eat but you have not enough he that
[1:32:20] earnthenecklace but Jesus says verse 21
[1:32:24] as we come back to Matthew chapter 6 for
[1:32:25] where your treasure
[1:32:28] is there will your heart be also your
[1:32:32] heart will follow after those things
[1:32:33] that you value that just that should
[1:32:36] just cause pause right now the reason
[1:32:39] why I pursue these things is because in
[1:32:40] my heart I value
[1:32:42] it I I I I think that there's some
[1:32:45] importance to it I know that it if
[1:32:47] impacts me it affects me whatever you
[1:32:50] make your treasure gains possession
[1:32:51] possession of your heart it takes
[1:32:54] control verse 24 no man can serve two
[1:32:57] masters for either will hate the one and
[1:32:58] love the other realse he'll hold to the
[1:33:00] one and despise the other you cannot
[1:33:02] serve God and Mammon am what a
[1:33:06] remarkable uh eye openening
[1:33:10] scripture it's not that you can't have
[1:33:12] if and not to make the argument but it's
[1:33:14] not saying you can't have two masters
[1:33:17] you just can't serve them both at the
[1:33:18] same
[1:33:19] time one has to have the pr priority you
[1:33:23] can't serve God and Mammon now you could
[1:33:26] have that duplicity in your heart where
[1:33:28] yes you desire the things of God but
[1:33:30] you're a slave to all these other
[1:33:31] desires but you realize you can't
[1:33:33] fulfill these desires and be serving God
[1:33:36] that you have to choose the one that's
[1:33:38] going to be the greatest you have to
[1:33:40] choose the one that's going to rule and
[1:33:41] we sometimes we think oh well if I
[1:33:43] choose to serve God I can't eat anymore
[1:33:45] and I can't drink anymore and I can't be
[1:33:47] clothed no God knows you have need of
[1:33:49] those things God knows there's a bit
[1:33:51] benefit in certain Recreation God knows
[1:33:53] that there's things in life that we can
[1:33:55] enjoy as an individual this message
[1:33:56] teaches us that God knew that somewh
[1:33:58] like mountains that some would like the
[1:34:00] ocean some would like this and some
[1:34:01] would like that and so he made this life
[1:34:04] full of things that we can enjoy that
[1:34:06] aren't necessarily really high
[1:34:07] Supernatural spiritual things and so
[1:34:09] your heavenly father knows that you have
[1:34:11] base instincts that you have desires
[1:34:13] even if it be to be entertained or to
[1:34:15] recreate or get away and relax God knows
[1:34:17] but what he wants you to have is one
[1:34:19] desire and if you have one desire he'll
[1:34:22] look after all these other
[1:34:24] things and it's through that that other
[1:34:26] hobbies and Recreations even if we do
[1:34:28] indulge in and the pursuit of of golfing
[1:34:31] or we like to enjoy this hobby or
[1:34:33] whether it be fishing or even enjoying
[1:34:35] sports that it has its place but it's
[1:34:37] not the one thing amen and we realize
[1:34:40] it's not a
[1:34:43] master in Colossians chapter 3: 1 and
[1:34:45] two if you be risen with Christ seek
[1:34:48] those things which are above where
[1:34:50] Christ sth on the right hand of of God
[1:34:52] set your affections on things above not
[1:34:55] on things on earth direct your heart to
[1:34:58] Christ means to seek to strive for to be
[1:35:02] purposed in your
[1:35:03] heart seek those things which are
[1:35:06] above because where your treasure is
[1:35:09] there will your heart be also what what
[1:35:11] was that the culmination to lay up not
[1:35:13] for yourselves Treasures on
[1:35:16] Earth because if you if you hoard
[1:35:19] Treasures on Earth that makes your heart
[1:35:23] Earthbound if it's all what you're going
[1:35:25] to eat what you're going to drink what
[1:35:26] you're going to be clothed with what
[1:35:27] your house if your house be house
[1:35:29] becomes your true
[1:35:31] desire I I if your house becomes the
[1:35:34] dominant thing the thing that's the most
[1:35:35] important that's where your heart's
[1:35:37] going to be it's downward right a
[1:35:40] tornado an
[1:35:42] earthquake the housing
[1:35:44] market right crazy things can
[1:35:46] happen but he says if you're storing
[1:35:49] Treasures in Heaven your heart begins to
[1:35:50] look upward
[1:35:52] like that's that's where it's at I even
[1:35:55] if you think about it if if there was if
[1:35:58] there was something going to happen and
[1:35:59] you heard the some economies were going
[1:36:00] to fail or there you know there was
[1:36:02] going to be something come in and uh you
[1:36:04] think you see your front door open when
[1:36:06] you get home from church today and
[1:36:07] you're thinking someone's been in our
[1:36:09] house you run to that one place where
[1:36:10] you know you got the valuables right and
[1:36:12] you check is my Nintendo switch still
[1:36:15] there right that's what you want to know
[1:36:17] you want to know is the gaming system
[1:36:18] still there is my laptop still there why
[1:36:19] you run to the thing that's valuable
[1:36:21] because
[1:36:21] that that's that's what you you
[1:36:23] recognize there's some value in but
[1:36:25] wouldn't it be great if you just knew
[1:36:26] that you had something secure in heaven
[1:36:27] that no matter what happened here like
[1:36:30] you get home and you're like thank God
[1:36:33] what I have can't be taken away from me
[1:36:37] and and the lord giveth and the lord
[1:36:38] taketh away when it comes to all these
[1:36:40] other things but man I've got something
[1:36:42] greater Hallelujah I've got something
[1:36:44] greater than all that because you've set
[1:36:45] your affections on things above amen I
[1:36:48] call High
[1:36:49] Ambitions brother the sermon thinking on
[1:36:52] our way he came across a floater is what
[1:36:54] he called them and he ran into this
[1:36:56] floater he had started to have a
[1:36:57] conversation with him took them to lunch
[1:36:59] I believe and he said where did you
[1:37:01] start this this is floating we might
[1:37:02] call him a bum or some kind of uh just a
[1:37:04] traveling man he said where did you
[1:37:06] start this the man said about 20 years
[1:37:09] ago he's asked where are you going
[1:37:13] nowhere where did you come from
[1:37:16] nowhere how long you expect to keep this
[1:37:19] up oh I don't know
[1:37:22] and he said no
[1:37:24] Ambitions he says why the Christian
[1:37:26] ought to be the most ambitious person in
[1:37:28] the
[1:37:29] world we ought to be the most ambitious
[1:37:33] people in the world and he says bring
[1:37:35] this glorious Gospel of eternal life to
[1:37:37] a dying and perishing world we should be
[1:37:39] up and at it not given to chance desires
[1:37:42] I feel the weight of chance desires I
[1:37:44] feel this impulse this compulsion of
[1:37:46] things let's be honest with ourselves we
[1:37:48] give in we make mistakes we pursue
[1:37:49] desires we do things that we know know a
[1:37:51] son or daughter of God should not do we
[1:37:53] get caught up in the fanaticism of
[1:37:54] certain things we maybe get our emotions
[1:37:56] stirred up and we get excitable about
[1:37:58] certain things and whether it be certain
[1:38:00] ideals or or theories or certain things
[1:38:02] we pursue it we get behind it we support
[1:38:04] it whatever it might be but that's just
[1:38:06] one way of spreading us thin it's one
[1:38:09] way of getting robbing us of our energy
[1:38:11] and our our our passion he says we
[1:38:14] should be ambitious we shouldn't desire
[1:38:16] to be play uh uh uh complacent and no
[1:38:19] energy no ambition like well I guess I
[1:38:21] just can't wait till church Sunday I
[1:38:24] ain't got anything else to do he says we
[1:38:26] should be
[1:38:28] ambitious we should be up and at it
[1:38:30] sermon as the eagle stir her nest that's
[1:38:31] the way God builds his church for his
[1:38:33] eaglets high above the Ambitions of this
[1:38:35] world she's got a high ambition not to
[1:38:38] please men but to please God she's built
[1:38:40] high and
[1:38:41] safe this is where Safety and Security
[1:38:44] is is in laying up Treasures in Heaven
[1:38:46] what does it mean being riched towards
[1:38:47] God one thing have I desired of the Lord
[1:38:50] that will I seek after still here in
[1:38:53] Matthew chap 6: 22 to 23 I'm just about
[1:38:56] to the end here those running the
[1:38:59] slideshow are probably already just
[1:39:00] counting how many slides left to know
[1:39:04] doing the math they can do the analytics
[1:39:06] wow we've gone through 50 slides so far
[1:39:08] he's been about an hour so far got this
[1:39:09] much to go they already know just how
[1:39:11] long I'm going to be all you have to do
[1:39:13] is ask AI right just just ask chat GPT
[1:39:16] how much longer does he have to preach
[1:39:18] he'll give you an answer may not be
[1:39:20] right
[1:39:22] Matthew chapter 6: 22 and 23 the light
[1:39:24] of the body is the
[1:39:26] eye if therefore thine eye be
[1:39:29] single thy whole body shall be full of
[1:39:32] light but if the eye be evil the evil
[1:39:35] eye is one that's
[1:39:37] chaotic it's
[1:39:39] disordered it's it's an eye that can't
[1:39:42] focus it's an eye that's not set on a
[1:39:45] single correct objective it can't focus
[1:39:48] on the object it's a one in eye it's
[1:39:53] caught it it it can't bring into Focus
[1:39:55] that's what he's saying here if an eye
[1:39:57] be single the whole body is full of
[1:39:58] light notice the benefit to the whole
[1:40:00] body but if the eye be evil thy whole
[1:40:02] body shall be full of Darkness if
[1:40:03] therefore the light that is in the be
[1:40:04] Darkness you perceive it to be light but
[1:40:06] in fact it's not how great is that
[1:40:09] Darkness a single eye Proverbs chapter
[1:40:12] 25 23: 5 and 6 wil thou set thine eyes
[1:40:16] upon that which is not for riches
[1:40:18] certainly make themselves Wings they fly
[1:40:21] away as an eagle toward Heaven eat not
[1:40:23] the bread of him that hath an evil eye
[1:40:26] neither desire thou his dainty meats
[1:40:30] that evil eye it's always changing
[1:40:31] always shifting yes this evil eye if I
[1:40:34] could put it this way it's that person
[1:40:36] it's that inclination that desire to
[1:40:38] where you found it right I found it this
[1:40:41] is going to solve all your financial
[1:40:43] problems right if you can just give me
[1:40:46] give me 500 bucks and start selling
[1:40:48] everybody else get them to give you 500
[1:40:49] bucks and what it's an ideal it's an
[1:40:52] idea this is the pro it's going to
[1:40:53] problem it's going to take away all your
[1:40:54] pain it's going to remedy this and
[1:40:56] usually they just cycle right into
[1:40:58] another one yeah true right because
[1:41:00] there's always something new there's
[1:41:01] always a new fat there's always
[1:41:02] something something new that comes along
[1:41:05] he said there's there this evil eye it
[1:41:07] isn't focused on the correct objective
[1:41:09] it always gets its attention on
[1:41:11] something else true amen so set thine
[1:41:14] eyes on that which is not why because
[1:41:15] riches will just fly away but a an evil
[1:41:18] eye is chaotic it's disorderly it can't
[1:41:20] Focus but a single eye is
[1:41:24] simple it's clear I can't do it with my
[1:41:27] eyes but it's not eyes is looking two
[1:41:29] different
[1:41:30] ways the ey is not looking at this and
[1:41:33] looking at that you know trying to serve
[1:41:34] two masters but it's that Simplicity of
[1:41:37] mind the singleness of purpose it's an
[1:41:40] eye that's able to simplify and reduce
[1:41:42] desires to
[1:41:43] one Proverbs 4:25 to 27 let thine eyes
[1:41:47] look right on let thine eyelids look
[1:41:49] straight before thee Ponder the feet of
[1:41:52] thy path and let all thy ways be
[1:41:54] established turn not to the right hand
[1:41:56] nor to the left remove thy foot from
[1:41:59] Evil let her eyes look straight on this
[1:42:01] is what David was saying all other
[1:42:03] things I even have enemies that would
[1:42:05] want to destroy me a host is surrounding
[1:42:07] me I've got all these problems these cha
[1:42:09] this chaos coming but he wasn't focused
[1:42:11] on all those things he wasn't trying to
[1:42:13] do the math well if I put an army here
[1:42:15] if I do this if I do that there was one
[1:42:17] thing he desired above all that there
[1:42:18] was one hope and consolation he had of
[1:42:20] all that let thine eyes look right on
[1:42:23] let thine eyelids look straight before
[1:42:25] thee think about your feet let your ways
[1:42:27] be
[1:42:28] established let thine eye be single so
[1:42:31] your body can be full of light that's
[1:42:33] the strength of character because you
[1:42:35] have a singular
[1:42:36] purpose this is something that a lot of
[1:42:38] people recognize even in the natural
[1:42:39] world they're not necessarily putting
[1:42:41] God first but they sold out to one thing
[1:42:45] and because they made that their goal
[1:42:46] they're successful in it amen it's a
[1:42:48] principle that works because it's a
[1:42:49] strength of character when we're able to
[1:42:52] simplify ourselves to a singular simple
[1:42:56] purpose if your heart's divided between
[1:42:59] Heaven and Earth your body is entirely
[1:43:03] dark the light of the body is the eye of
[1:43:05] the ey be single the whole body is full
[1:43:07] of light but if the heart is divided
[1:43:08] between Heaven and
[1:43:09] Earth it's entirely
[1:43:12] dark because our desire determines our
[1:43:14] character just wrapping up here just
[1:43:16] closing our desire determines our
[1:43:19] character as I as I close I'm asking is
[1:43:22] it
[1:43:24] simple is it one thing
[1:43:27] desired I know that it's
[1:43:30] good it's good to be ambitious brother B
[1:43:33] said we've got high
[1:43:36] ambition we should be up and at it in
[1:43:40] our family on Christmas every year and
[1:43:42] sometimes if it's not Christmas it's New
[1:43:43] Year's Eve we take out a little prayer
[1:43:46] book each one of us have our own and in
[1:43:47] it we write down our prayers for the
[1:43:49] next year and it's an opportunity to
[1:43:52] reflect on what we asked a year before
[1:43:55] and see whether or not it's come to
[1:43:58] pass and as we write these desires out
[1:44:01] it's we're not just writing one thing
[1:44:04] sometimes it's page after page several
[1:44:05] things that are being written down it's
[1:44:07] multiple things and so it's not that you
[1:44:10] say well what do you want it's like well
[1:44:11] you know nothing really just just the
[1:44:13] Lord I guess since that's what we're
[1:44:15] supposed to do you know one you know one
[1:44:18] thing desired you heard the preacher
[1:44:21] and it's kind of like I don't that's not
[1:44:23] that's not it but it's when you
[1:44:26] recognize that really at the end of the
[1:44:28] day the things all these different
[1:44:29] things that I want can be
[1:44:32] summarized by one thing I want to please
[1:44:35] the
[1:44:36] Lord I want I want I want the Lord I
[1:44:38] want to do right I want to do
[1:44:41] good I want to have it's singular there
[1:44:44] may be a lot of ways it looks there may
[1:44:46] be a lot of ways that it plays out in my
[1:44:48] life a lot of things I end up doing
[1:44:50] things I per and I find myself wanting
[1:44:51] to do this and this and this there's
[1:44:53] ways that I can help in the church
[1:44:54] there's ways that I can help the
[1:44:55] Believers there's all sorts of different
[1:44:57] things that I can do in missions work
[1:44:58] and there's things I could do overseas
[1:45:00] there's a lot I can do but when it all
[1:45:02] comes down to it what is it it's one
[1:45:03] thing I desired yes it all has to do
[1:45:05] with
[1:45:07] Christ Luke 11:36 If thy whole body
[1:45:10] therefore is full of light having no
[1:45:12] part dark the whole shall be full of
[1:45:14] light as when the bright shining of a
[1:45:17] candle doth give thee light
[1:45:21] when we can reduce our desires to one
[1:45:23] that's going to illuminate the right
[1:45:25] path it's not a a dull life it's not a
[1:45:28] bored life it's not a life or it's just
[1:45:31] a kind of like a monastery the monks who
[1:45:33] just try to deprive themselves of
[1:45:35] everything else sensory they refuse to
[1:45:36] speak and they dress in uncomfortable
[1:45:38] clothes and they just try to make their
[1:45:40] lives uncomfortable so they can have the
[1:45:42] pretense that they're seeking God but to
[1:45:46] be able to say one thing have I desired
[1:45:47] of the Lord that will I seek after
[1:45:52] musicians if you'd like to come to your
[1:45:53] instruments I want to close with this
[1:45:56] scripture but as we come to this
[1:45:58] scripture Jesus is saying that if you
[1:46:00] can have that singular
[1:46:02] eye there's a light that begins to
[1:46:05] shine that's where the true Joy is when
[1:46:09] there's one thing desired life should be
[1:46:11] the process of assessing things learning
[1:46:14] things by experience by wisdom by
[1:46:15] discernment by teaching by instruction
[1:46:18] learning to determine True Value and
[1:46:22] simplifying on the basis of it
[1:46:24] businesses do this often they find
[1:46:26] processes that are uh uh that are not uh
[1:46:29] producing good within their within their
[1:46:32] work environment there's things that are
[1:46:33] done that are duplicative or there's
[1:46:35] things that actually don't bring add any
[1:46:36] real value and they streamline they get
[1:46:38] those things out and they they get rid
[1:46:41] of all the excess and they and in doing
[1:46:44] so they make themselves healthier and
[1:46:45] more productive I say that that's just a
[1:46:48] that's just a cheap type of what God
[1:46:49] wants us to do in our own personal lives
[1:46:51] is recognize the excess recognize the
[1:46:53] baggage the weight the things that we do
[1:46:55] that aren't productive it's exactly what
[1:46:57] Paul says he says all things are lawful
[1:46:59] but they're not all expedient yes you
[1:47:01] can do this yes that's okay but there's
[1:47:03] a lot of processes a lot of desires a
[1:47:05] lot of things that we pursue a lot of
[1:47:07] extra things are being really spread
[1:47:09] thin but can we simplify based upon
[1:47:12] value David says in 1 Chronicles 29:3 my
[1:47:15] last scripture here says moreover
[1:47:17] because I have set my affection to the
[1:47:20] house House of my
[1:47:21] God I have of my own proper good of gold
[1:47:24] and silver which I've given to the house
[1:47:26] of my God over and above all that I've
[1:47:28] prepared for the holy
[1:47:31] house I know it's maybe worded in a
[1:47:33] unique way it's just the translation The
[1:47:37] King's English as we might say because
[1:47:38] I've set my affection to the house of my
[1:47:40] God because I have said and professed
[1:47:43] one thing have I desire of the Lord that
[1:47:45] will I seek after that I may dwell in
[1:47:47] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:47:49] life Amen to behold the beauty of the
[1:47:52] Lord to inquire in his Temple he says
[1:47:55] because that was my
[1:47:57] desire I have of my own my gold and my
[1:48:02] silver I've
[1:48:04] given over and above all that I've
[1:48:06] prepared prepared for the Holy House
[1:48:08] other words David's desire wasn't
[1:48:10] shallow it was
[1:48:12] real he put his money where his mouth
[1:48:15] was he put his actions where his mouth
[1:48:18] was one thing have I desired that will I
[1:48:20] seek after you could actually look in
[1:48:22] the Curious language as David is saying
[1:48:23] it there wasn't even a
[1:48:25] temple there was a
[1:48:28] tabernacle and what did David say he
[1:48:29] just wasn't saying you know I guess if
[1:48:31] there was a temple I'd want to be there
[1:48:33] but he put it his actions he wanted to
[1:48:35] build that place Amen in other words if
[1:48:38] it wasn't there and it was what he
[1:48:40] wanted he was going to do everything he
[1:48:41] could to make sure he had it what a
[1:48:44] challenge to us maybe we're just sitting
[1:48:45] around just waiting you know brother
[1:48:47] John's Got The midest Touch everything
[1:48:49] he touches turns to gold old and if we
[1:48:51] want it a certain way we'll just wait
[1:48:52] for Brother John to do it he'll get it
[1:48:53] where it needs to be and we want things
[1:48:55] to be a certain way or we want certain
[1:48:57] opportunities and if you really desired
[1:48:59] it maybe you would do as David did
[1:49:03] because I set my affection to the house
[1:49:04] of my God I have of my own proper good
[1:49:08] of gold and silver which I've given to
[1:49:09] the house Lord over and above all that I
[1:49:11] prepared for the Holy House in other
[1:49:12] words more than what was AC acquired
[1:49:15] elsewhere I've given even of
[1:49:17] myself I've done it because this is what
[1:49:19] I desired
[1:49:20] if I could do this and close on in where
[1:49:22] we were in that text if the Lord is
[1:49:24] indeed your light the Lord is indeed
[1:49:27] your salvation then this one thing will
[1:49:30] be
[1:49:30] desired then the Lord will be the one
[1:49:33] thing that is needful it'll be the
[1:49:35] highest aim the highest desire of your
[1:49:37] heart the Lord is my light and my
[1:49:39] salvation because that I don't have any
[1:49:40] fear I don't have anything to be afraid
[1:49:42] of and therefore he is what I desire
[1:49:45] because truly he is my light when things
[1:49:48] are dark that's who I reach for when I'm
[1:49:50] afraid and things come up against me
[1:49:52] that's who I Look to because I really
[1:49:54] mean it it's in my
[1:49:56] heart if I could put it this way no one
[1:49:59] who truly sees the beauty of the Lord
[1:50:01] will have his heart captured by anything
[1:50:05] else and so David David wasn't just
[1:50:08] satisfied in talking about it looking at
[1:50:12] a tabernacle of the Wilderness a tent
[1:50:15] and saying yeah one thing I desired I'd
[1:50:17] want to I'd want there to be a house
[1:50:19] that I could go to to it'd be like
[1:50:22] praying all these years that send the
[1:50:23] light would get their own church
[1:50:24] building right well if they just had
[1:50:26] their own church building maybe I'd
[1:50:28] visit I don't want I don't like fighting
[1:50:29] with all the used cars in the parking
[1:50:31] lot right and then and then you get it
[1:50:35] and don't show up anymore maybe I should
[1:50:36] be looking at the camera which one which
[1:50:38] one's live
[1:50:39] right just I'm just just being real but
[1:50:43] the idea that one thing I've desired and
[1:50:45] it wasn't even in one sense it didn't
[1:50:47] even
[1:50:49] exist but David said I'm going to do
[1:50:51] everything I can because I want to see
[1:50:53] that I want to see that house built am
[1:50:56] you know maybe I'm looking at it just a
[1:50:57] little bit different angle
[1:50:59] there but once you see the beauty of the
[1:51:02] Lord that's why we should seek
[1:51:05] it rarely rarely if I could say no one
[1:51:08] who sees the be of the Lord will have
[1:51:09] his heart captivated by any other so
[1:51:11] that's what we should seek for one thing
[1:51:14] desired could we stand together today
[1:51:17] and just like to say a prayer for you as
[1:51:18] we turn it over to your pastor
[1:51:22] one
[1:51:26] thing maybe this is something maybe this
[1:51:29] is something these young young men could
[1:51:30] think about one thing desired these
[1:51:33] young ladies these young people I have
[1:51:35] my own family here I see this these
[1:51:36] young people here today so many things
[1:51:39] to desire so many things to pursue so
[1:51:41] many things to consider what am I going
[1:51:43] to where am I going to go to college
[1:51:44] what am I going to pursue what kind of
[1:51:46] car am I going to own what what all
[1:51:47] these different things so much to think
[1:51:49] about but can we really honestly say in
[1:51:51] our hearts that when it all comes down
[1:51:53] to it I want to win Christ I want to
[1:51:56] gain him with our heads bowed let's
[1:52:07] pray maybe you could just pray today
[1:52:10] Lord help me to understand let help me
[1:52:13] to Value the right
[1:52:16] things where this thought uh came to me
[1:52:19] in my my life is I began to think last
[1:52:21] year about what God
[1:52:24] values and
[1:52:26] in thinking about what he values and how
[1:52:29] that we can identify the things that God
[1:52:31] values in scripture and God speaks a
[1:52:33] language to us makes decisions and
[1:52:36] teaches certain things to the scripture
[1:52:38] to where it's telling us things about
[1:52:39] his heart and things he
[1:52:41] values and for me I was thinking I if I
[1:52:44] could find what God values that's
[1:52:46] instructive to me about what I ought to
[1:52:49] value
[1:52:51] and I know that life's
[1:52:52] hard difficult it's not just a matter of
[1:52:55] what we eat and what we drink and what
[1:52:56] we're going to
[1:52:57] [Applause]
[1:52:59] wear and being really strict with that
[1:53:04] language those three things just refer
[1:53:06] to life and all that it demands and all
[1:53:08] that it
[1:53:09] entails and I do believe that we can
[1:53:13] seek first the kingdom of God one thing
[1:53:17] desired Above All Else
[1:53:20] we need the Lord's help in determining
[1:53:22] value so that we can simplify our
[1:53:24] desires and our aims and that's what I
[1:53:26] would pray for you today if you desire
[1:53:28] that just maybe lift your hand before
[1:53:29] the Lord Lord help me to determine True
[1:53:31] Value and have the grace in my life to
[1:53:34] simplify on the basis of it our gracious
[1:53:36] Heavenly Father Lord today as we've
[1:53:38] shared this this message with the people
[1:53:42] the close of the first month of the year
[1:53:44] Lord it is kind of a A good sermon at
[1:53:47] the start of the year when we're making
[1:53:48] changes and implement many new processes
[1:53:50] and having evaluated the past year and
[1:53:53] looking forward to a new one it's kind
[1:53:54] of affords us a nice opportunity to
[1:53:57] reset and Lord I pray that as this
[1:53:59] newness of the year is still with us
[1:54:02] we're still may be trying to change
[1:54:04] habits within our home or become more
[1:54:06] diligent with respect to personal things
[1:54:10] may we examine
[1:54:12] ourselves as the prophet said in Hagi
[1:54:15] consider your ways says it once says it
[1:54:18] again in that first chapter times
[1:54:20] consider your ways the proverb saying
[1:54:22] Ponder the feet of the your
[1:54:24] path consider what way your feet are
[1:54:27] going today Lord we've had ample
[1:54:29] opportunity while the word was preached
[1:54:31] to consider our ways to determine
[1:54:33] whether or not we've
[1:54:34] established a comfort on Earth through
[1:54:37] natural things and essentially just
[1:54:39] storing up Treasures on Earth that our
[1:54:40] heart is attached to and we've forsaken
[1:54:43] the house of the
[1:54:45] Lord which embodies another kingdom with
[1:54:49] speaks of your habitation what you
[1:54:53] value and orients us to the Heavenly and
[1:54:56] not the
[1:54:57] Earthly I pray that you help us
[1:54:59] throughout our lives to be able to
[1:55:00] determine value to be able to rightly as
[1:55:03] we grow Lord I don't expect some of
[1:55:04] these young boys here and 12 years old
[1:55:07] to be able to look at every situation
[1:55:08] and know what counts and what matters so
[1:55:11] I pray that you be with the parents who
[1:55:12] are teaching them training them raising
[1:55:15] them up in a way that's going to instill
[1:55:17] in them in integrity and hopefully give
[1:55:19] them the kind of experiences that build
[1:55:21] their character so that as they grow and
[1:55:23] they mature they begin to look at
[1:55:25] situations and they can determine things
[1:55:28] of True Value and simplify life on the
[1:55:31] basis of it what a great lesson we can
[1:55:34] all learn Lord if we were able to find
[1:55:38] you in Simplicity and get away from all
[1:55:41] the minutia and the all the
[1:55:45] the just the Surplus in the world today
[1:55:50] and just find you Lord help us I pray
[1:55:52] may you be with us strengthen our hearts
[1:55:54] and encourage us bless us I pray as we
[1:55:58] commit the people to you in the name of
