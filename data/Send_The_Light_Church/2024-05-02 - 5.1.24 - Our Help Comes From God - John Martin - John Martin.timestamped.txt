[16:14] to pray for that um also I
[16:19] uh um met a man at the I doctor out of
[16:24] all places and a young man and told him
[16:27] about the message and uh let's just pray
[16:30] for him I forgot his name right now but
[16:32] the Lord knows it and uh if it's him his
[16:36] he he'll come amen um we don't know if
[16:39] we don't ask so uh we just have to do
[16:44] what we can you know and I just I was
[16:47] going to give a testimony in the men's
[16:48] meeting but kind of time ran out but
[16:50] I'll do it for everybody else is um I
[16:54] worked
[16:54] for I retired a couple years ago worked
[16:57] for Pratt Miller for 35 years and
[17:02] uh I believe it was there when I got
[17:05] saved so thankful for that and um but as
[17:11] you know you your Zeal increases for the
[17:14] Lord people see
[17:16] it and uh so as I was uh just being a
[17:21] witness for Christ
[17:24] um brother Paul he's no longer here but
[17:27] he was he was there we would pray my
[17:30] office every day at a break so really I
[17:33] worked there for 35 years never really
[17:35] had a quotequote break I was just
[17:38] praying so uh anyway uh so we're there
[17:42] um praying continuously for I don't
[17:45] about a year and a half I guess and
[17:48] there was a man there that was dealing
[17:50] with uh alcohol abuse and some other
[17:53] things and and one day he came up and
[17:56] just you know said you know asked him
[18:00] questions and you know I just directed
[18:02] them to the Lord and he uh well
[18:04] basically he gave his heart to the Lord
[18:07] in my
[18:08] office and uh some of my you might know
[18:11] him his name is Ryan and um so from that
[18:16] day forward well before that we were
[18:20] praying in my office so there was
[18:21] another one more joined in there was
[18:23] three then there was four then there was
[18:26] five then there was
[18:27] six and
[18:29] and this is every day right and we work
[18:33] 10 hours 12 hours a day so it it's you
[18:36] know break was nice to have but they
[18:38] were willing to give it up for
[18:41] Lord
[18:43] and uh we outgrew my office so we moved
[18:48] upstairs and then when we moved upstairs
[18:50] now we were in front of a lot lot lot
[18:52] other people so they seen it so then it
[18:56] grew from 6 to 12
[19:00] and it stayed fluctuated through the
[19:03] years because different buildings and
[19:05] different things situations but anyway I
[19:08] went back to see
[19:10] him uh the other just the other day and
[19:14] I wanted to go early because they're
[19:16] still praying and I went over there and
[19:18] now there's you know there was probably
[19:20] eight of us out there praying and there
[19:23] was a whole bunch of new ones new guys
[19:26] out there amen so I guess the reason I'm
[19:29] saying this
[19:31] is God honors
[19:35] faithfulness so
[19:38] amen you know sometimes you might
[19:42] think it's all in vain but it's
[19:47] not excuse me so just keep being
[19:52] faithful keep on keeping on that's all I
[19:55] can say so let's just stand and and um
[19:59] let's just remember um all the
[20:01] missionaries through the world the
[20:03] special uh uh people that are coming the

[20:08] brother
[20:09] Ward and um just all the needs there's

[20:15] for other needs so let's just remember
[20:18] them in our hearts and just lift them

[32:38] as we begin reading here in Psalms 121
[32:41] and we're going to read just the first
[32:43] two verses and have a word of prayer and
[32:46] have you be
[32:47] seated uh the psalm says I will lift up
[32:50] my eyes unto the hills from whence
[32:53] cometh my help my Help Cometh From The
[32:56] Lord which made heaven

[33:27] unless you come and do that we're going
[33:29] to come up short of what you really

[33:39] ministry of the word God that you come

[33:46] anointing for we're Unworthy of your

[34:15] spirit that would keep this from
[34:17] happening Lord we ask that you would be
[34:19] with those that are not here today that
[34:21] would desire to be here for one reason
[34:25] or another we just ask that your spirit
[34:27] would go
[34:28] with them be with them and help them in
[34:30] this hour and bless them Father we

[34:43] amen God bless you you may be
[34:46] seated we want to en entitle this
[34:49] message our help comes from the Lord a
[34:51] very a simple uh message but I believe
[34:56] most
[34:58] necessary amen and we want for a subject
[35:02] to entitle this the believer's resource
[35:05] amen as we continue uh reading or read
[35:08] those two verses again I will lift up my
[35:10] eyes unto the hills from whence cometh
[35:14] my help my Help Cometh From The Lord
[35:17] which made Heaven and Earth so we know
[35:20] it's coming from a very strong Source
[35:23] the help is coming from someone who's
[35:25] able to create heaven and Earth he said
[35:29] he will not suffer thy foot to be moved
[35:32] he that keepeth thee will not Slumber
[35:35] behold he that keepeth Israel neither
[35:37] slumber nor sleep The Lord Is Thy keeper
[35:40] The Lord Is Thy shade upon thy right
[35:43] hand the sun shall not smite thee by day
[35:46] nor the Moon by Night the Lord shall
[35:49] preserve thee from all evil amen he
[35:53] shall preserve thy Soul the Lord shall
[35:56] preserve thy going out and like coming
[35:59] in from this time forth even and even
[36:03] forever more what a precious precious
[36:06] promise right there amen you know we go
[36:09] through a lot of stuff and because we
[36:12] live in the flesh and we're bombarded
[36:16] with so many problems here on the planet
[36:19] it's our natural tendency to be looking
[36:23] to the world to Natural Things to other
[36:28] people to see those problems resolved
[36:31] can you say Amen to that it's very
[36:34] difficult to live down here with all the
[36:35] problems and still keep God first keep
[36:38] God as the resource for all that we have
[36:42] need of Amen there's an astronomical
[36:45] amount of distractions that we face
[36:47] every day problems deadlines demands and
[36:52] all these things make it very difficult
[36:54] for us to keep our eyes upon the Lord
[36:58] amen where the source of all of our help
[37:02] should come from right when I think
[37:04] about
[37:06] David think about David's life for a
[37:08] little bit tonight all the wars that he
[37:11] had to
[37:12] fight he was being the chief commander
[37:16] the Strategic leader of all the fights
[37:19] and all the wars that he was in all the
[37:23] people he had to leave lead as a king
[37:27] all the problems he had to to to not
[37:30] just deal with but he had to resolve
[37:32] them amen because he was the the leader
[37:35] all think about all the trials and the
[37:37] tests that he went through yet David
[37:40] Held The Secret inside of his
[37:44] heart of to where to get his help from
[37:49] amen he didn't have anybody else to go
[37:52] to right it wasn't some religion some
[37:55] church some Works he didn't have a
[37:58] picture of Moses with the burning
[38:00] bush right he didn't have a plaque of
[38:03] the Ten
[38:04] Commandments he had to have God the
[38:07] realness of God in his life to meet the
[38:09] need because those things don't meet the
[38:11] needs
[38:13] amen David had a relationship with the
[38:17] actual creator of heavens and earth amen
[38:21] and he said My Help Cometh From The Lord
[38:24] which made Heaven and Earth right I
[38:28] believe if God could get every one of us
[38:31] to
[38:33] focus on where he wants us to focus with
[38:37] any problem that we would have I believe
[38:40] we would be finding favor with God and I
[38:43] believe that needs would be met in an
[38:47] astronomical way true there would be
[38:49] many testimonies amen but I'm going to
[38:51] be honest with you God does not want to
[38:54] share his glory with any person amen
[38:57] amen am it doesn't true he wants all the
[39:00] glory for meeting all of our needs and
[39:02] he he deserves all of our praise right
[39:06] amen now everyone in the world wants
[39:09] some kind of
[39:11] help all the nations of the world at one
[39:13] time or another want help from another
[39:15] Nation we see them in the news all the
[39:18] time going back and you know asking help
[39:21] in asking arms and uh doing uh uh
[39:25] Maneuvers uh working
[39:28] together so everybody wants help at one
[39:31] time or another the Democrats want help
[39:34] the Republicans want help special groups
[39:37] want help doctors nurses want help
[39:40] hospitals want help the police want help
[39:42] farmers want help we're hearing that
[39:45] colleges need help right
[39:48] now government wants help with
[39:52] inflation poor people want help everyone
[39:56] in the world wants some kind of help at
[39:59] one time or
[40:02] another and they're all looking to
[40:04] everything but
[40:08] God everyone wanting help is looking to
[40:13] everything but God
[40:16] Amen David learned at an early age to
[40:20] look to God and to rely on God for help
[40:26] and this is good for our our young
[40:29] people he had an experience one time
[40:32] with a
[40:33] bear
[40:34] right the bear was going after the sheep
[40:38] and his job was to watch the Sheep well
[40:41] I'm going to tell
[40:43] you David was no match for that bear am
[40:48] he was no match for that
[40:51] lion but he looked to the Lord for help
[40:54] in this situation amen he knew it was a
[40:58] reality that he wasn't going to be able
[41:00] to defeat this bear in this line just
[41:02] like when that ball was ready to rush
[41:05] brother
[41:07] brandom he knew that he did not have the
[41:10] ability in himself to beat that bow he
[41:14] went for his gun oh I I I left in the
[41:17] truck right when all the the swarm of
[41:20] bees came he wasn't uh bigger than all
[41:24] those bees
[41:27] so you see God has to be a real reality
[41:30] and I know that we're not living at that
[41:32] time but God is the same yesterday today
[41:34] and forever he can be in my life he can
[41:37] help me with my problems but I need to
[41:39] really truly Look to Him for help right
[41:44] and not just say that I'm doing it but
[41:46] I've really got to do it my heart
[41:49] amen David
[41:52] learned at an early age and he took his
[41:56] experience at an early age and he was
[41:58] maybe too young to go into the army but
[42:01] it was him that beat Goliath right and
[42:05] he couldn't do it with his
[42:08] ability but the same God that delivered
[42:10] him he said he testified of that bearing
[42:12] that L is the same one that will will
[42:15] defeat this this giant in his life amen
[42:20] and I I am sure that as David grew up he
[42:25] continued to grow in a
[42:27] and grew in his experiences that his
[42:30] battles became heavier became
[42:35] greater amen he was no longer facing one
[42:39] Goliath he began to face Goliath
[42:43] everywhere he was
[42:45] misunderstood some people hated
[42:48] him King Saul wanted to see David
[42:52] dead King David experienced trouble
[42:55] distress I'm talking about on a national
[42:58] level amen he was rejected forsaken he
[43:03] was spit upon not only by his own men
[43:06] but he was it was directed by God the
[43:08] Bible says think about it he suffered as
[43:12] a murderer as a thief as an
[43:16] adulterer he dealt with the Temptations
[43:18] of popularity and power and numbering
[43:21] the people he suffered loneliness
[43:24] anxiety and depression he had to learn
[43:27] to Humble himself and become broken and
[43:30] become contrite amen David we could say
[43:34] this this he been there done it he' been
[43:36] through it all right how could this man
[43:40] be a man that was
[43:42] after God's Own
[43:48] Heart he really wanted what God
[43:52] wanted David looked to God
[43:57] in his problems right right when it came
[44:00] time to repent the resource was God
[44:04] Amen when it when it came time to to uh
[44:09] to trust in God and and and fight
[44:11] through negativity and anxiety and
[44:14] depression and all those things he
[44:15] looked to God he trusted in God it was a
[44:18] reality amen it wasn't just something
[44:21] that he mentally thought about he made a
[44:24] decision in his heart I'm going to trust
[44:26] God in my situation and because the
[44:29] actual fact that he trusted that is what
[44:32] brought the Deliverance that's what made
[44:35] God a deliverer to him amen amen he said
[44:39] I will lift up my eyes unto the hills
[44:42] from Once cometh my help my Help Cometh
[44:45] From The Lord now we all know you know
[44:48] God is the answer to all of our problems
[44:51] he's the one that really helps us but
[44:54] how often we don't put God to the test
[44:57] you understand I'm sure we all say well
[45:00] I ask God to come I wish God would do
[45:02] this but I'm still dealing with this and
[45:04] I still got this problem I I still got
[45:05] this flat tire nobody has fixed it yet
[45:08] whatever the thing is
[45:12] right that is what happens when we trust
[45:16] God
[45:17] mentally we begin to get
[45:22] discouraged and that's when we begin to
[45:24] play Church
[45:28] all these things that I read and if you
[45:30] just read the book of Psalms you could
[45:32] see that David went through so many
[45:34] things true he was you you for for being
[45:38] a a king and chosen of God and and
[45:41] Anointed with that oil that man went
[45:44] through so much and was found so often
[45:46] alone without any support he didn't have
[45:49] a support group that's the
[45:52] truth it's not about how many problems
[45:55] we have it's about making God the
[45:58] resource of what our problems are amen
[46:01] we just can't you know only look to God
[46:04] for certain things amen that that makes
[46:08] people jealous I mean that makes God
[46:10] jealous I'm I'm sorry but just imagine
[46:13] if you're going to use
[46:17] somebody how does that make them
[46:19] feel use your husband use your wife use
[46:22] your children use your parents you don't
[46:24] get what you want you go somewhere else
[46:26] how does does that make them
[46:28] feel God is a jealous God and he wants
[46:31] you to go to him and only
[46:34] him yes God will use other people but
[46:37] you don't have to tell them right God
[46:40] orchestrates
[46:45] it David said in Psalms 46 verse1 God is
[46:49] our refuge and our strength a very
[46:53] present help in trouble that's
[46:58] right
[46:59] amen we
[47:01] either amen say Amen to the written
[47:04] word or we say Amen to the spirit of the
[47:09] word you understand I'm saying you
[47:11] believe it right
[47:14] here because the thing that we need to
[47:16] start exercising is trusting
[47:19] God faith is not
[47:23] built by a calendar look we we just
[47:26] turned into may this is our first day of
[47:28] May well we don't got more fate today in
[47:30] May than we did April just because it
[47:32] may happen we get like a new
[47:35] dose you know like uh you get your new
[47:39] check that month it isn't like that you
[47:42] have to actually work for
[47:46] faith our faith the devil deteriorates
[47:49] our
[47:50] faith brother Brandon makes statements
[47:52] if we we come up for prayer all the time
[47:55] it weakens our faith
[47:57] well there's things that weaken our
[47:58] faith there's things that strengthen our
[48:00] faith
[48:01] amen and you take little things and I'll
[48:04] tell you here's the biggest thing if we
[48:07] learn to be grateful for every single
[48:10] thing we have that in itself will build
[48:13] Faith Amen brother just being grateful
[48:16] for what you have and and God God just
[48:20] seems to come in when you're just
[48:22] thanking him in the morning for all the
[48:24] things that you have and all of a sudden
[48:26] you feel good you you feel like you can
[48:28] move forward and trust him more just
[48:32] because you started out being more
[48:36] thankful Paul said in Philippians 4:19
[48:39] but my God shall supply all your need
[48:43] according to his riches and Glory by
[48:45] Christ Jesus what a promise that we have
[48:48] but do we have faith to believe it today
[48:51] that's right we got to step out by faith
[48:53] and believe it our God Will Supply all
[48:57] now that I've underlined in that my
[48:59] Bible for I don't know how long because
[49:01] I've needed that since I come to know
[49:03] the Lord right and before I before I
[49:06] knew the Lord I didn't know what to do
[49:08] except you know ask other people
[49:11] right right but then when I read
[49:16] this I'm thinking who am
[49:20] I to go looking to somebody else for
[49:24] help come on
[49:31] I'm not you have not CU you asked not
[49:32] and I'm okay with with you know brother
[49:35] Ben I need some help can you help me
[49:37] move these hay bales I'm okay with that
[49:41] I am not okay with every time there's a
[49:45] need let's look to a human
[49:48] being we need to start looking to God
[49:52] more I'd rather be guilty of looking to
[49:56] him
[49:57] only when I could have maybe asked a
[49:59] brother or a sister you understand what
[50:01] I'm saying because this is a real thing
[50:04] God wants us to have a relationship with
[50:07] him that the word becomes real to
[50:10] us a living word yes not something we
[50:14] can quote not something we we know up
[50:16] here but something that's real to us yes
[50:19] amen God wants that I think that's
[50:21] beautiful that God wants that kind of
[50:22] relationship with us amen amen that's a
[50:25] special type of relationship
[50:27] ship when David needed peace God was his
[50:31] resource of Peace not his mother not his
[50:34] father that's right not his best friend
[50:37] not even the general of his army that's
[50:39] right right his source of peace came
[50:42] from God Psalms 29:11 says the Lord will
[50:46] give strength unto his people the Lord
[50:49] will bless his people with peace so
[50:52] where is peace coming from God Amen
[50:56] that's it God and God Alone Psalms 122:7
[51:00] says peace be within thy
[51:04] walls how many wants peace in their home
[51:07] peace be within thy walls and prosperity
[51:11] within thy palaces amen amen Psalms 119
[51:16] 165 great peace have they which love thy
[51:20] law and nothing shall F them you we've
[51:23] quoted these scriptures before I know
[51:25] that you you you know them but
[51:28] look why would we want to look at
[51:31] anything else but God who is the source
[51:34] of peace
[51:37] amen why would you want to go to Burger
[51:40] King and see if you could borrow $5,000
[51:43] from Burger King when the bank is next
[51:46] door that's where you go right you go to
[51:50] the bank to borrow money you go to
[51:51] Burger King to get the
[51:55] burgers God is source of our peace
[51:57] period period period period I don't I I
[52:02] I it it doesn't matter the turmoil
[52:04] that's happening at at work at
[52:07] home in in the church or anywhere and by
[52:11] the grace of God all is well but
[52:13] understand peace comes from God we can't
[52:16] be looking to others to give us peace
[52:19] amen peace doesn't come from jumping
[52:22] from one frying pan to another
[52:24] either amen
[52:27] Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace yes
[52:31] Isaiah 263 says Thou will keep him in
[52:34] perfect how many wants to be kept in
[52:37] peace I don't want to be there for a
[52:39] little bit I don't want to be there for
[52:40] a day I want to be kept there amen right
[52:44] I want to be stayed there at all times
[52:46] amen amen thou will keep him in perfect
[52:49] peace whose mind is stayed on thee
[52:54] because he trusteth in thee now in this
[52:57] age when knowledge has
[53:00] increased and and the devil has been let
[53:02] loose and we've got more distractions
[53:04] and problems than we've ever had on the
[53:07] planet I am a believer today that we can
[53:11] keep our mind stay on the Lord I believe
[53:14] that you can't say well I'm I'm
[53:19] busy I'm too busy to have
[53:23] peace no we're too distracted to have
[53:26] peace
[53:28] that's all we got to do is settle our
[53:31] minds on the
[53:33] lord well how do I I'm I'm it's time to
[53:37] eat my mind's on eating thank the Lord
[53:39] for the food I'm working I I I my mind's
[53:42] on working thank the Lord for a job keep
[53:45] your mind somehow stay on the Lord when
[53:47] no matter what you're doing
[53:50] amen we've got to remember our source
[53:54] amen for peace
[53:56] amen the peace of God is not the absence
[53:59] of
[54:00] fighting it's not the absence of losing
[54:03] a loved one or a close friend it's not
[54:06] the absence of our heart being
[54:10] troubled we want all those things but
[54:13] that's not what peace
[54:15] is that may be the peace that we get in
[54:18] this
[54:20] world you ever just wished I just wish
[54:23] there were some peace and quiet amen
[54:26] amen I I I'm at work and and and for
[54:29] three days I've been trying to steal
[54:31] away what wasn't really I was waiting
[54:34] all day Monday to find out what the Lord
[54:37] wanted and I got a a little but I had no
[54:40] time you know to spend and so I was
[54:43] constantly looking for time if I could
[54:45] just you know get an hour break here or
[54:48] hour break there and finally I just I I
[54:51] told my my son today I'm going to go in
[54:53] the other room and shut the door
[54:56] because there's just so much going on
[54:58] there's times that we just need peace
[55:00] and
[55:01] quiet amen well God can give you peace
[55:05] in the middle of the noisiest thing
[55:07] going on in the world Amen Jesus said in
[55:11] John 1427 peace I leave with you right
[55:18] my peace I give unto you not as the
[55:21] world giveth give I unto you let not
[55:24] your heart be troubled neither let Let
[55:26] It Be Afraid so in other words we play a
[55:29] part we have to say I am not going to
[55:32] let the devil bother
[55:34] me I am not going to let this situation
[55:37] bother
[55:37] me God has left us
[55:41] peace we've got to tap into it amen we
[55:45] got to be the one that I'm going to get
[55:46] on my knees until the presence of God
[55:48] comes amen we've got to be willing to
[55:50] pay that price amen peace is simply a
[55:54] fruit of God where God goes his peace
[55:57] goes right his Joy goes his love goes it
[56:02] is a fruit of God it it is
[56:08] God he's the source amen it's the
[56:13] believer's resource God is the
[56:15] believer's resource
[56:18] amen Paul's speaking in Philippians
[56:20] chapter 4 if you want to turn there said
[56:24] Paul said do not be anxious about
[56:27] anything but in everything by prayer and
[56:30] petitioning with praise with
[56:32] Thanksgiving let your requests be made
[56:35] known unto
[56:37] God he didn't tell us to go anywhere
[56:43] else he told us to go to
[56:45] God and the peace of God which passes
[56:49] all understanding shall keep your hearts
[56:53] and Minds through Jesus Christ there
[56:56] again Jesus not want he's a jealous God
[57:00] he doesn't want your mind and your heart
[57:02] to be kept through anything it has to be
[57:04] kept through Jesus Christ
[57:09] amen verse eight finally Brethren
[57:12] whatsoever things are true and
[57:15] honest
[57:17] just
[57:19] pure
[57:22] lovely and of a good
[57:25] report if there's any
[57:28] strength and if you can praise God about
[57:31] what you're thinking then think on these
[57:34] things but if it's zapping the strength
[57:37] out of you and making you feel
[57:39] weak you can't say praise God for this
[57:42] happening in my life don't think on it
[57:46] amen stop it at the door because it will
[57:50] steal your
[57:52] peace those things which you have both
[57:55] learned
[57:56] and received and heard and seen in me do
[58:00] them don't be a hearer of the word but
[58:03] do them and the God of Peace shall be
[58:05] with
[58:06] you Paul
[58:09] described the his source of of Peace
[58:13] where he got peace from
[58:16] and the believer believes that the
[58:21] believer believes that the believer
[58:23] doesn't say well that was for Paul but
[58:24] it didn't work for me that's
[58:28] right the believer doesn't look for a
[58:31] temporary source of peace you ever tried
[58:33] to do
[58:35] that a temporary Source just kind of get
[58:38] your mind away from it but it's still
[58:40] there it's still gnaws at
[58:44] you God gives us a peace it's a real
[58:47] peace yes sir I believe that the three
[58:50] Hebrew children had it I believe Daniel
[58:52] had it in the Lion's Den I really
[58:55] believe that their came a time in
[58:57] Jonah's
[58:59] prayer that peace came after he humbled
[59:03] himself and repented look to the Lord
[59:05] amen peace came without that I mean he
[59:09] didn't have peace at the beginning when
[59:11] the ship was a rocking you know he said
[59:13] look just to be honest with you I'm the
[59:15] trouble throw me
[59:17] overboard it ain't like he had peace
[59:19] about
[59:20] it he knew he was out of the will of God
[59:28] and and maybe he thought this was the
[59:29] end when he first got swallowed by the
[59:30] fish he said oh this is it maybe this is
[59:32] the
[59:33] end but when he was down there for a day
[59:36] or
[59:40] two well maybe the Lord is waiting for
[59:43] me to
[59:45] repent and he looked to the Lord and
[59:48] that's when God did what he was going to
[59:51] do set him
[59:54] free take a look at what Paul went
[59:56] through if we had you want to write it
[59:58] down 2 Corinthians chap 11 but I just
[1:00:00] want to describe we talked a little bit
[1:00:02] about David let's talk a little bit
[1:00:04] about Paul Paul was beaten with rods
[1:00:06] four times how many times were you ever
[1:00:08] beaten with a rod
[1:00:11] right I mean I was hit a couple of times
[1:00:14] right couple of
[1:00:17] times but I I would imagine his beating
[1:00:20] you know wasn't just okay we want to
[1:00:22] spank
[1:00:23] you I mean he got cloud it over
[1:00:28] yes you couldn't even measure how many
[1:00:32] stripes he bore in his body he said they
[1:00:34] were without
[1:00:36] measure he said of the Jews alone five
[1:00:39] times he received 39
[1:00:42] stripes in one place he said I bear in
[1:00:45] my body the marks of the Lord Jesus
[1:00:47] Christ amen I believe that his body was
[1:00:52] scarred just for standing for Jesus
[1:00:57] not because he did anything wrong but
[1:00:59] because he stood for
[1:01:02] Jesus he went to prison more often than
[1:01:05] anyone else he
[1:01:07] knew he was stoned he got
[1:01:12] weak and he got feeble at times and I
[1:01:14] want you to put yourself in Paul's shoes
[1:01:17] right now he suffered shipwreck he
[1:01:21] suffered perils on the water with
[1:01:23] robbers in the city in the wilderness
[1:01:27] with heathens with countrymen
[1:01:30] even among false
[1:01:34] Brethren this was a time of suffering
[1:01:37] this wasn't like hey we had a vacation
[1:01:39] we had you know bad weather came for a
[1:01:40] couple
[1:01:41] days it was a time of suffering amen he
[1:01:45] suffered weariness painfulness hunger
[1:01:48] and thirst he was often fasting he was
[1:01:52] cold he even said that he was naked
[1:01:56] didn't have clothes to wear and beside
[1:01:59] those things that happened outside of
[1:02:01] the church he said the things that came
[1:02:04] upon me daily the care of all the
[1:02:10] churches he wrote 14 books of the New
[1:02:13] Testament he ministered and labored more
[1:02:16] than anyone he
[1:02:19] said he was a a a a
[1:02:23] missionary because of his ministry he
[1:02:26] had a bullseye on his back and
[1:02:28] everything that happened to him through
[1:02:32] the hands of people was really
[1:02:34] orchestrated by the
[1:02:37] devil devil was just mad that this man
[1:02:40] was serious about God that's right that
[1:02:43] really he put God first in his
[1:02:46] life look what happened to to to to
[1:02:50] job God
[1:02:53] accused uh Joel I'm sorry the devil
[1:02:56] accused God that the only reason that
[1:02:59] job was serving him because he had all
[1:03:02] this
[1:03:04] money because he had a hedge of
[1:03:07] protection around him right and that
[1:03:10] soon as you take away everything that he
[1:03:13] has his heart is going to turn from
[1:03:17] you but God knew that he had a perfect
[1:03:22] relationship with him perfect
[1:03:27] and he had to prove
[1:03:29] it and it didn't happen in two days he
[1:03:33] went through a lot a lot he lost loved
[1:03:35] ones he lost a
[1:03:38] lot but he remained with his
[1:03:42] relationship with God he kept still
[1:03:44] going to church brother
[1:03:47] Dennis he still he kept giving his
[1:03:51] offerings he steep he kept praising the
[1:03:54] Lord right
[1:03:57] am he kept his Integrity with God Amen
[1:04:01] he kept his relationship with God he
[1:04:03] didn't allow his problems to dictate to
[1:04:07] him he knew God was still God right Paul
[1:04:12] still knew that God was God David knew
[1:04:15] that God was God Amen sometimes we
[1:04:18] forget who God is or where he's at and
[1:04:21] we we we struggle with things in life
[1:04:23] and we're we're missing out in that Rel
[1:04:25] relationship with God that we could have
[1:04:27] how is God going to meet our needs if
[1:04:29] we're going to question him if we're
[1:04:31] going to doubt him you know that here's
[1:04:33] the biggest
[1:04:35] thing we've heard so many people say
[1:04:38] it's hard for me you know to really
[1:04:39] believe in a God because why would God
[1:04:41] allow
[1:04:42] this why would God allow the Holocaust
[1:04:45] why would God allow uh all those uh
[1:04:50] people to Die the the the the Indians
[1:04:53] and and we've heard so many why would
[1:04:57] God allow my my my loved one to die to
[1:05:01] go through that suffering to get in that
[1:05:03] that that automobile accident right and
[1:05:06] what they are they're just open doors
[1:05:08] for the devil to get in
[1:05:10] there and cause people to doubt
[1:05:15] God instead of saying I know in whom I
[1:05:20] believed I'm trusting that God is a good
[1:05:24] god that he don't do anything UNG
[1:05:28] good everything God does is good amen we
[1:05:31] may not see it what some people call uh
[1:05:34] terrible God uh the prophet calls the
[1:05:37] tender hand of Jehovah yes sir
[1:05:40] amen because God is a good God but the
[1:05:43] thing is the difference is the attitude
[1:05:46] amen where do we stand with that are we
[1:05:48] looking to God are we leaning to our own
[1:05:52] understanding amen second Timothy y 2:9
[1:05:57] just thinking now of Paul what he went
[1:06:00] through 2 Timothy 2:9 says wherein I
[1:06:05] suffer
[1:06:07] trouble and he may he says as an
[1:06:10] evildoer I can see somebody who's doing
[1:06:13] Evil all these things happening to him
[1:06:15] even unto my bonds but the word of God
[1:06:18] is not bound he said therefore I Endure
[1:06:22] all things for the elect's sake yes amen
[1:06:27] he was willing to keep suffering day
[1:06:29] after day after day to keep living for
[1:06:32] God to keep preaching the truth because
[1:06:35] of one soul that might be
[1:06:39] saved that was a
[1:06:42] love that Paul had for God you know a
[1:06:46] lot of people aren't willing to go
[1:06:48] through
[1:06:49] anything wanting to
[1:06:52] quit Paul never quit
[1:06:55] he never gave up he never said this
[1:06:59] burden is too heavy because he would be
[1:07:01] calling God a liar that is right that's
[1:07:03] right because God wouldn't put anything
[1:07:06] on you that you couldn't bear but Paul
[1:07:08] could bear a
[1:07:09] lot amen sometimes people can't even
[1:07:12] bear making it to church faithfully and
[1:07:14] when they come they're not even paying
[1:07:16] attention come on it's the truth the
[1:07:20] something little comes along and they
[1:07:21] don't want to come to church because
[1:07:23] they got some sort of problem
[1:07:25] amen just take a look at what Paul went
[1:07:28] through he wasn't an angel from
[1:07:31] heaven he was a man like you and I yes
[1:07:34] sir amen he had to make a choice like
[1:07:36] you and I and he went through so much
[1:07:38] more than we ever went through yeah
[1:07:40] that's right true therefore I Endure all
[1:07:42] things for the elect sake that they may
[1:07:45] also obtain salvation which is in Christ
[1:07:48] Jesus which is in Christ Jesus with
[1:07:51] eternal glory amen 2 Timothy 1: 11
[1:07:56] Paul's speaking here says where unto I
[1:07:59] am
[1:08:01] appointed a preacher an apostle and a
[1:08:05] teacher of the Gentiles now each one of
[1:08:07] those things covers a lot of
[1:08:11] responsibility and he says for the which
[1:08:13] cause of these responsibilities I
[1:08:17] have I also suffer these
[1:08:20] things nevertheless I am not ashamed
[1:08:24] amenallah for I know I know whom I have
[1:08:29] believed and am persuaded that he is
[1:08:32] able to keep that which I've have
[1:08:34] committed unto him against that
[1:08:36] day you I'm a I just feel that we need
[1:08:39] to know the Lord a little bit
[1:08:42] more and we're not going to know God by
[1:08:44] coming to
[1:08:45] church right we're going to know God by
[1:08:48] getting our heart into
[1:08:49] church like getting a heart where we
[1:08:52] need to get it when the word is being
[1:08:53] preached so we can receive the
[1:08:56] revelation of the word and not just the
[1:08:57] knowledge of the word but we need to
[1:08:59] walk away from this building more
[1:09:01] connected to
[1:09:04] God and it ain't on God don't put on God
[1:09:07] that's a very proud
[1:09:08] Spirit that's on
[1:09:10] us the resource that Paul had was Jesus
[1:09:14] Christ amen it didn't matter what the
[1:09:17] need was it didn't matter how diverse or
[1:09:20] how unique if it was a a one of a kind
[1:09:23] or if it was the devil buffeting over
[1:09:25] and over every day God was his source to
[1:09:28] meet that need that he
[1:09:30] had Paul had a total Reliance on
[1:09:35] God a total Reliance on God imagine
[1:09:39] getting to the place that you're so
[1:09:42] trusting
[1:09:44] God I think it's one of the most
[1:09:46] beautiful places to be with to be at on
[1:09:48] the planet you talk about taking a
[1:09:50] vacation you talk about a sunset you
[1:09:53] talk about the ocean waves running in
[1:09:56] you talk about wyomi I'll tell you the
[1:09:59] greatest place to be in is in the
[1:10:01] presence of
[1:10:02] God that's where I want to be where I
[1:10:04] could totally rely on him for every need
[1:10:08] Paul said I have learned to be content
[1:10:10] amen with whatever situation I'm in
[1:10:13] there with to be
[1:10:14] content he lived by believing and
[1:10:17] trusting in God for all his needs
[1:10:20] amen he didn't say it but when God
[1:10:24] actually put him to the test
[1:10:26] he stayed faithful to trusting God you
[1:10:29] know a lot of times we have this because
[1:10:30] we live in a world of just you know
[1:10:33] storefront you know we want to make sure
[1:10:35] we got the best fo forward when we're
[1:10:38] talking to
[1:10:40] somebody that we you know we just got to
[1:10:42] show that we are the very very best
[1:10:49] Christian and that's like all that
[1:10:51] matters and we go home and we act like
[1:10:52] any way we want to act right trust God
[1:10:56] when we should be right doubting him
[1:10:59] questioning
[1:11:00] him amen God is calling the bride God is
[1:11:05] calling us to step up and start relying
[1:11:08] on him with our heart with our heart
[1:11:11] amen Paul said in Galatians chapter 2:2
[1:11:14] Christ liveth in me and the life which I
[1:11:19] now live in the flesh right I live by
[1:11:24] the faith of the Son of God he no longer
[1:11:28] is you know I got to find somebody else
[1:11:29] to help me with this situation he
[1:11:32] trusted in
[1:11:33] Goden I want that I want that for myself
[1:11:37] I want a greater faith in
[1:11:40] God let let the problems come yeah let
[1:11:43] them happen I I I I want to be able to
[1:11:48] if I can't trust him what does it matter
[1:11:50] anyways if the problems don't come
[1:11:52] because I'm still guilty you understand
[1:11:54] what I'm saying right that's right I'm
[1:11:56] not just trying to say oh yeah I trust
[1:11:58] God so much let all the problems go that
[1:11:59] is not what I'm
[1:12:01] saying what I'm saying is if I can't
[1:12:04] trust him no matter what then I need
[1:12:06] more of God that's what I'm
[1:12:10] saying Paul worked on his relationship
[1:12:13] every single day with
[1:12:17] God he kept so close to God that no
[1:12:20] matter what circumstance happened God
[1:12:24] was there to meet that need yes he
[1:12:26] didn't want he didn't run to
[1:12:29] Gia he didn't have a group of clergy
[1:12:32] lawyers or Scholars or counselors that
[1:12:35] he went
[1:12:36] to In fact when he met Jesus
[1:12:40] Christ after he met Jesus Christ he
[1:12:44] never even went up to Jerusalem to see
[1:12:47] the disciples right that's right and get
[1:12:49] some questions answered because he had
[1:12:51] this experience he had questions come on
[1:12:55] you're the disciples you got to help me
[1:12:56] with this what what you know I
[1:12:58] experienced this what do you see he
[1:13:00] didn't even do that you know what he did
[1:13:02] he went to the
[1:13:04] source Hallelujah he he went and spent
[1:13:07] time with Jesus Christ in prayer
[1:13:12] amen and it was through that prayer that
[1:13:14] Revelation came that he was able to see
[1:13:17] who God really
[1:13:19] was it wasn't hearing from some other
[1:13:22] man
[1:13:25] right amen I'll tell you no matter how
[1:13:28] much of God that we got in our heart I I
[1:13:30] feel that the real God that we serve is
[1:13:33] a God that wants us to know him
[1:13:36] more wants us to be able to depend on
[1:13:38] him more and and to be like David a man
[1:13:42] after God's heart where God I want you
[1:13:43] in the middle of everything in my life
[1:13:45] yeah not just in part of it but in
[1:13:49] everything he had a total Reliance on
[1:13:53] God learning to rely on God learning to
[1:13:57] trust God I'll say it will probably be
[1:14:01] the hardest thing that we'll ever learn
[1:14:02] in
[1:14:07] life
[1:14:08] because you heard the story uh about the
[1:14:12] man who
[1:14:15] could
[1:14:17] uh take a wheel barrel and and walk
[1:14:22] across Niger Falls
[1:14:26] he could just take that wheelbarrow and
[1:14:28] walk right across nagger
[1:14:31] Falls all in the crowd they were just
[1:14:34] cheering them yes you can do it you can
[1:14:36] do it and they believe that we believe
[1:14:39] you can do it and he says well you come
[1:14:41] and get in the
[1:14:43] wheelbarrow
[1:14:45] that's well we believe it without
[1:14:50] that a lot of us believe in God to a
[1:14:54] point Y
[1:14:57] true I believe the bride is the only
[1:15:00] group of people that is totally going to
[1:15:03] put their lives into his
[1:15:08] hands you remember God told Thomas Jesus
[1:15:14] told
[1:15:16] Thomas you're blessed that you believe
[1:15:18] right now it's true because you see
[1:15:22] right he say but you'll be more blessed
[1:15:25] more blessed are they which believe and
[1:15:28] have not
[1:15:29] seen so I think there's a greater
[1:15:31] blessing for all of us when we look to
[1:15:34] the Lord for what's cometh our help our
[1:15:38] help comes from the Lord and it's got to
[1:15:40] be so real that we can trust
[1:15:43] him God is looking for that do you
[1:15:45] believe
[1:15:47] that David said in Psalms 91 how many
[1:15:50] you like Psalms 91 that's such a
[1:15:53] favorite Psalm of many of us
[1:15:55] verse two says I will say of the Lord he
[1:15:58] is my refuge and my Fortress my God in
[1:16:02] him will I trust now if I could just you
[1:16:07] you know
[1:16:09] do the
[1:16:11] last five
[1:16:14] words because anybody can say I will say
[1:16:17] of the Lord he is my
[1:16:20] refuge he's my
[1:16:22] Fortress can we say that
[1:16:25] when we feel our back is against the
[1:16:27] wall
[1:16:29] yeah I want to be able to trust him and
[1:16:33] be seen in my
[1:16:36] life when things are against
[1:16:41] me at that stronger
[1:16:43] relationship verse three surely he shall
[1:16:46] deliver thee From The Snare of the
[1:16:49] Fowler and from the noisome
[1:16:53] pestilence that's like being delivered
[1:16:56] from from New York
[1:16:58] City verse five Thou shalt not be afraid
[1:17:02] for the terror by night nor the arrow
[1:17:04] that fth by you ever just get bombarded
[1:17:06] in your
[1:17:07] head all these thoughts
[1:17:13] coming verse n because thou has made the
[1:17:17] Lord which is my refuge even the most
[1:17:21] high thy habitation amen
[1:17:25] amen you got to settle
[1:17:27] it you got to settle
[1:17:32] it verse 10 then there shall no evil
[1:17:35] because notice that it wasn't a period
[1:17:37] That's the
[1:17:39] semicolon there shall no evil Beall
[1:17:43] thee because you've made the Lord your
[1:17:45] Refuge your habitation there shall no
[1:17:48] evil bether neither shall any plague
[1:17:51] come thy dwell now that's a promise for
[1:17:54] us verse 11 for he shall give his angels
[1:17:57] charge over you to keep you in all your
[1:18:03] ways what a
[1:18:05] promise they're here they encamp around
[1:18:09] about us they're in our homes amen
[1:18:12] praise God they're in our
[1:18:13] homes to protect us to keep us because
[1:18:18] the devil is is always sneaking trying
[1:18:20] to get in
[1:18:21] amen verse 14 because he has set his
[1:18:26] love upon me therefore will I deliver
[1:18:29] him so instead of just he will set his
[1:18:32] love upon me now that's really the key
[1:18:35] but if you trust him if you look to him
[1:18:39] for your
[1:18:40] help therefore will I deliver
[1:18:45] him I will set him high above his

[1:19:01] but what the name of Jesus really means
[1:19:03] amen he shall verse 15 he shall call
[1:19:06] upon me and I will answer him I will be
[1:19:10] with him in trouble and I will deliver
[1:19:12] him and I will even honor
[1:19:15] him wow amen all because he's making God
[1:19:22] the source of his help right yes and and
[1:19:26] and it uh you know what I'm talking
[1:19:28] about here when you read Psalms 91 we're
[1:19:30] not talking about making God some dob
[1:19:32] booy or some Santa Claus or so someone
[1:19:34] that just you know we call upon to meet
[1:19:36] our needs but a
[1:19:39] relationship it's got to be a real
[1:19:42] relationship we all have tests and
[1:19:44] trials can you say
[1:19:46] Amen we all have problems and difficulty
[1:19:51] uh we have circumstances that are beyond
[1:19:54] our our control right we all have uh
[1:19:59] need of answers and directions for our
[1:20:02] lives we all have or have had but
[1:20:06] probably have some sort of health issues
[1:20:09] that we'd like to see taken care of
[1:20:11] don't you say Amen to that
[1:20:14] amen this is what Peter said in 1 Peter
[1:20:17] chapter 5:9 knowing that the same
[1:20:22] afflictions
[1:20:25] that you
[1:20:26] have the same afflictions are
[1:20:29] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:20:33] in the world you're not the only one
[1:20:36] going through what you're going through
[1:20:38] amen don't let the devil isolate
[1:20:42] you don't don't do
[1:20:45] that and if these same things are
[1:20:47] happening to somebody else they're
[1:20:49] overcoming that means I can overcome
[1:20:53] amen and and what what's going to what's
[1:20:55] going to make the difference believing
[1:20:57] that greater is he that's in us than he
[1:20:59] that's in the world that's what it's
[1:21:00] going to be
[1:21:03] am amen now those other people that have
[1:21:07] problems and had problems before us they
[1:21:09] went on to overcome obstacles and they
[1:21:13] used a
[1:21:14] resource of faith in God the same thing
[1:21:17] that we have we don't use something
[1:21:18] different we use the very same thing
[1:21:20] that everybody else did turn with me if
[1:21:23] you would to Hebrews chapter 11 and I I
[1:21:27] I see myself slowing down and me not
[1:21:29] getting through my notes you know what I
[1:21:32] mean that's that's not good I got to get
[1:21:34] through these Hebrews chapter 11 but if
[1:21:37] we could just show you the difficulties
[1:21:40] that other people had to overcome when
[1:21:42] we stare at our problems there don't
[1:21:45] seem to be quite as
[1:21:47] big just trying to increase faith in
[1:21:49] that Avenue Hebrews 11:32 and what shall
[1:21:53] I more say for the time it would
[1:21:55] literally fail me to tell you of Gideon
[1:21:59] of baric and of Samson and japheth of
[1:22:02] David also and Samuel and of the
[1:22:05] prophets who through faith they subdued
[1:22:09] kingdoms they wrought righteousness they
[1:22:11] obtained promises they stopped the
[1:22:13] mouths of lions they quenched the
[1:22:16] violence of fire they escaped the edge
[1:22:19] of the sword out of weakness they were
[1:22:20] made strong they waxed Valiant in fight
[1:22:25] uh they turn to flight the armies of the
[1:22:28] aliens women receed their dead raised to
[1:22:30] life again praise God and others were uh
[1:22:33] were tortured not accepting
[1:22:35] Deliverance that they might obtain a
[1:22:38] better resurrection and others had trial
[1:22:42] of cruel
[1:22:44] mockings
[1:22:46] scorings y moreover of bonds and
[1:22:51] imprisonments yeah now this isn't
[1:22:55] Paul's testimony this is everybody but
[1:22:59] Paul they were Stone and S A Stone and
[1:23:03] were sown aunder were tempted were slain
[1:23:06] with the
[1:23:07] sword they they wandered about in sheep
[1:23:10] skins and goat skins being destitute
[1:23:13] Afflicted tormented of whom the world
[1:23:17] wasn't even worthy to
[1:23:18] have oh my think about how we look in
[1:23:23] the sight of God
[1:23:25] we're precious in the sight of God
[1:23:28] Amen they wandered in deserts and in
[1:23:32] mountains and dens and caves of the
[1:23:34] earth and these all having obtained a
[1:23:37] good report through faith receive not
[1:23:40] the promise God have provided some
[1:23:43] better thing for us that they without us
[1:23:45] should not be made perfect wherefor
[1:23:48] verse 12 chapter 12 verse 1 wherefor
[1:23:52] seeing we also are compassed about with
[1:23:56] so great a cloud of
[1:23:59] witnesses in other words they've run the
[1:24:02] race they kept the faith amen they
[1:24:06] didn't back down they kept believing and
[1:24:09] they overcame and now they're looking at
[1:24:12] us they're looking over the ballast if I
[1:24:15] could say it like the banner today

[1:24:34] other
[1:24:36] way so now that we're come pass about so

[1:25:35] for the joy that was set before me
[1:25:36] endured the cross despising the shame
[1:25:38] and is set down at the right hand of the
[1:25:40] Throne of God and God is wanting us to
[1:25:44] look to
[1:25:45] him right not just the one who saved us
[1:25:50] right but the one who's going to finish
[1:25:54] the
[1:25:55] race the one who's going to really bring
[1:25:57] us into the image of who he is he has an
[1:26:01] expected end for us but we have to keep
[1:26:04] laser focus on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:07] laser focus on him and don't allow the
[1:26:10] devil to distract us with all the
[1:26:12] problems that is happening and when we
