[37:51] where we all were in the
[37:52] past and then it was love that changed
[37:55] us it was his love we didn't have
[37:58] nothing to do with it it it was his love
[38:00] that changed us and that it it it it it
[38:04] something happened to us the scripture
[38:06] says it quickens something happened to
[38:08] us that we could not control it quickens
[38:11] and that quickening caused us to sit
[38:13] together with a new
[38:15] nature and and and and to to be raised
[38:18] higher than where we used to live amen
[38:20] amen St John Chapter
[38:25] 13 St John chapter
[38:35] 13 Jesus speaking of this love here in
[38:39] verse 34
[38:42] 35 St John
[38:44] 1334 and 35 a new commandment I give
[38:48] unto you that you love one
[38:51] another as I have loved you that you
[38:55] also love one another another with that
[38:59] same love that I've loved you with and
[39:02] by this shall all men know you're
[39:04] different that you're my
[39:07] disciples if ye have love one for one to
[39:12] another amen amen God bless you you may
[39:14] be
[39:18] seated amen we want to entitle this
[39:22] message our yard stick kind of a
[39:26] different type
[39:28] our subject is really the love of God
[39:31] manifested what we want to talk
[39:33] about and before we get into this I just
[39:36] want to say thank you
[39:38] for thank you for the cakes the cookies
[39:41] and the things that you made for us for
[39:46] pastor
[39:47] appreciation uh day or month I mean you
[39:50] can keep doing it even if you missed it
[39:52] you can keep doing it for the next month
[39:55] I'm just kidding but thank you so much
[39:56] and it's uh really hard to stay
[40:00] inbalanced with all these
[40:04] things um but we just had to keep eating
[40:07] it before it went bad
[40:09] right I wanted to say thank you it's
[40:12] it's well recognized and may God bless
[40:14] you for your love amen
[40:17] amen here in this scripture God is
[40:20] saying this is how I will be identified
[40:24] by this is the only identification
[40:28] of a disciple of Jesus Christ this is
[40:31] the yard stick that people are truly
[40:33] going to know where you stand with
[40:38] God Bible says we are written Epistles
[40:40] read and known of all men so we really
[40:42] can't hide the love of
[40:45] God you can't say you have it nobody
[40:48] knows about it you just can't do it
[40:51] there's something about the love of God
[40:53] that people
[40:54] know they know it's not human love
[40:56] anymore that's right because it has
[41:00] sacrifices that that human love just
[41:03] doesn't
[41:04] do it's a universal communication that
[41:07] has no language
[41:10] barriers it doesn't matter how much
[41:13] civilization has changed from the time
[41:15] that Jesus walked uh on the road with
[41:18] just
[41:19] sandals without any luxuries to the time
[41:22] that we have now we have cell phones we
[41:24] have TVs computers games
[41:28] Rockets trains cars fast food automation
[41:31] washer and dryer microwaves we have all
[41:33] that stuff now but you know God's love
[41:36] and his communication with love has not
[41:39] changed it's always remained the same
[41:42] throughout every age you could know
[41:45] exactly that someone was a disciple of
[41:48] Jesus Christ simply by the love that
[41:51] they loved with it was the same exact
[41:54] love that God loved them with
[41:58] and it it's a love that you can actually
[42:00] love somebody when they're dead in sins
[42:02] and trespasses and keep loving them to a
[42:06] nature
[42:07] change are you with me and I'll just say
[42:10] if you want to get into this message
[42:11] you'll get blessed more out you'll get
[42:13] more out of it I'll tell you that my my
[42:15] goal and my desire is to help it's all
[42:18] it's it's really people change
[42:21] civilization change times change but
[42:23] God's love it never changes that's and
[42:26] it never will change
[42:28] first John 4 tells us that God is love
[42:30] and people will know that we're his
[42:34] disciples by manifesting that same
[42:39] love and we're going to if we could have
[42:42] I'd like to ask brother James if he'd
[42:44] pass out some yard
[42:46] sticks we're gonna we're going to just I
[42:49] want us to have like
[42:51] a something to take home with us
[42:54] something to kind of remember this this
[42:58] Service uh we're going to kind of
[43:00] measure our our life as a
[43:03] disciple with the love of God
[43:06] today and uh I hope that's okay is that
[43:10] okay I I don't think anybody's going to
[43:13] be hurt or offended do
[43:15] you amen amen
[43:18] so
[43:20] uh if there's enough every everyone
[43:24] should can get one except the youth
[43:26] you're going to have to bow the the
[43:27] adults but I will say this this
[43:31] is actually is just as much for you as
[43:34] for the adults today this love of God
[43:38] that he has for us he had not just for
[43:41] the adults but he had it for us I
[43:43] remember as a child how many can
[43:45] remember God speaking to you when you
[43:47] were a child sometime amen God speaking
[43:51] to you so God is
[43:53] here now first of all we want to make
[43:56] sure that we're using the right stick
[43:59] when we're
[44:00] measuring in other words we don't want
[44:03] to be using the wrong stick these are
[44:07] just some different measuring sticks
[44:10] that we can measure with but if you
[44:11] notice that these cannot
[44:15] measure what those yard sticks can
[44:18] measure this is limited I can only
[44:20] measure a little bit but those sticks
[44:23] you have there can measure a great deal
[44:26] more
[44:27] so we don't want to be using the wrong
[44:29] stick we want to use the the correct one
[44:32] because if we use the wrong one we're
[44:34] going to get a a a a f a false
[44:36] calculation or indications or or
[44:39] misguidance or or and end up with a
[44:42] false sense of security because I've got
[44:44] what I feel I got the love of God now we
[44:46] all feel we have the love of God right
[44:48] in our hearts how many can say amen I
[44:51] have the love of God and and for you
[44:53] that don't want to participate I'm going
[44:55] to ask you to stand up now
[44:59] we've all been touched by the love of
[45:01] God because God you know he's so good
[45:03] that his love just pours out even to the
[45:06] enemies so we've all experienced the
[45:08] love of God but this here is God is
[45:10] wanting to be identified in our lives by
[45:14] love and nothing else not by what we
[45:16] know but what we
[45:19] manifest so let's measure our love have
[45:22] you ever experienced being treated bad
[45:23] by someone who had a bad attitude yeah
[45:28] good I love I love I love people
[45:29] entering in love that absolutely we all
[45:32] have this unfair treatment can grind on
[45:35] us and it can actually make us want to
[45:38] lash
[45:39] back
[45:41] right on the other hand being treated
[45:43] amazingly by someone who might have
[45:46] happened to be in a good
[45:48] mood this kind of treatment usually
[45:51] lifts us up and causes us to repay them
[45:53] with a kind
[45:54] gesture you ever you ever done that
[45:59] now most people reflect back to others
[46:01] what is projected to
[46:03] them come on say
[46:06] amen and this is the love that most
[46:08] people operate and it's called FAL love
[46:11] it's human love it's it's Foundation is
[46:14] selfish it's a selfish nature that's the
[46:17] that's the root of it and so most people
[46:19] love others based on how they are loved
[46:23] and that's what I think that about these
[46:25] little measuring things when we're
[46:26] trying trying to measure whether we got
[46:28] God's love inside of us how we treat
[46:30] people it's it's you know these things
[46:33] are like respector persons and I'll be
[46:36] nice to you if you're nice to
[46:38] me but that's not God's
[46:43] love if someone is always friendly or
[46:45] kind towards them then most likely
[46:49] they'll be friendly back but if someone
[46:52] is usually rude or forward towards them
[46:55] then they won't most likely be friendly
[46:58] back to them amen it's just just being
[47:01] honest if you give an extremely good tip
[47:04] to a
[47:06] waitress usually you're going to get a
[47:08] greater expression of gratitude than if
[47:11] you give them a poor
[47:15] tip you ever give somebody a tip and
[47:17] they just kind of like this
[47:20] it they don't say it but that's the
[47:22] expression they give you know what I'm
[47:23] talking
[47:24] about and then you have to go back you
[47:27] have to recalculate how many what
[47:28] percent was
[47:31] that if a person usually doesn't like to
[47:34] return things that they
[47:36] borrow and they want to borrow something
[47:38] from someone well they're going to do
[47:40] what they can to avoid lending that to
[47:42] that person is that
[47:45] true these are just a few examples of
[47:47] how our our selfish love it's love but
[47:52] how it works it's still love
[47:57] but it's under the nature of
[48:00] selfishness it works under the law of
[48:02] condition it's a conditional love I will
[48:06] consider loving you if you love
[48:10] me but you don't then don't expect me to
[48:13] love you back if you're going to treat
[48:16] me like that then I'm
[48:19] G
[48:21] right so we this is fial love it it's a
[48:26] conditional love
[48:27] it has
[48:29] limits it it it can only
[48:33] exercise in a unlimited
[48:37] capacity because of that we can conclude
[48:40] that this love is
[48:42] shallow there's no depth to it it's
[48:46] limited it's seasonal it's temporal it
[48:50] starts and it stops all the
[48:53] time you can't even depend on it
[48:57] its boundaries are never defined because
[49:00] it's it changes with moods and
[49:03] emotions this love is
[49:07] 100%
[49:09] selfish in fact this love will
[49:12] manipulate others to get what it
[49:17] wants this love will actually hurt
[49:19] others to get what it selfishly wants
[49:22] but yet it's still
[49:25] love but it's not God's love that's
[49:28] right human love is selfish which makes
[49:31] it limited and conditional therefore we
[49:34] cannot measure our discipleship to
[49:37] Christ based upon our human
[49:41] love what we kind gestures that we do
[49:45] for others where we bend over backwards
[49:47] and help somebody sometime and say well
[49:50] you know I'm just being you know a
[49:53] Christian there are people who do not
[49:57] believe in God that do nice things for
[50:00] people because inside of human love
[50:04] there is the ability to have somebody go
[50:08] through the door first or open the door
[50:10] or you know I'm telling you I don't know
[50:12] how many times people have paid for my
[50:15] coffee or my food at a fast food place
[50:18] and they say well that guy in front of
[50:20] you who he paid for you
[50:27] you ever go through the Across The Mao
[50:29] bridge and everybody that goes through
[50:31] they got paid for because they're paying
[50:32] for the guy
[50:36] behind so I'm just saying we can't
[50:39] measure the love of God based on nice
[50:43] things that we do for
[50:46] people you know the Bible says that
[50:49] Christ did not even want his own
[50:51] disciples to try and go witness until
[50:54] they were indued with power from on high
[50:58] think about that his own disciples he
[51:01] would not let them go and witness until
[51:03] they received a power and that power is
[51:05] the power of of
[51:08] love we know it as the Holy Ghost but it
[51:11] is the power of love because notice
[51:15] their Spirit would just quit as soon as
[51:17] they got persecuted right soon as the
[51:20] problem start they would quit well this
[51:22] is it for me I'm going to go find
[51:23] another church but when they got filled
[51:25] with the Holy Ghost see it didn't matter
[51:27] what the persecution happened they had
[51:29] power they had so much love that they
[51:32] could stand there get persecuted for the
[51:34] name of Jesus Christ that is the love of
[51:38] God the power of the Holy Ghost is the
[51:41] love of God it's agape love it's a
[51:45] unconditional
[51:47] love Jesus said in Acts 1 18 but you
[51:51] shall receive power you shall receive
[51:54] the power
[51:57] after that the Holy Ghost which is agape
[52:01] love the love of
[52:03] God is come upon
[52:07] you and you shall be Witnesses unto me
[52:10] both in Jerusalem and Judea and in
[52:13] Samaria and the uttermost parts of the
[52:17] earth you're equipped now to show others
[52:21] that you're my disciple when you have
[52:25] the life of God in you how can you have
[52:27] the Holy Ghost and not the love of
[52:31] God they're they're the
[52:35] same now we know you can have the word
[52:39] and not have the
[52:41] spirit because the devil has the word he
[52:44] he knows the word more than all of us
[52:46] combined he is so good he can take that
[52:49] word and confuse our minds if we if we
[52:51] let the wrong Spirit around us too
[52:54] long but you know what he he doesn't
[52:57] have the life because he'd have to fall
[53:00] in love with
[53:02] Jesus he doesn't love Jesus he hates
[53:04] Jesus he's
[53:07] selfish remember when Jesus was talking
[53:09] about the power he
[53:13] had class that was a question by the way
[53:16] it was a
[53:18] question I got a question
[53:21] mark the power he was speaking about was
[53:23] really the power of agapy love amen
[53:27] it can constrain a man to literally lay
[53:30] down his life for others that's right
[53:34] it'll cause him to to even leave his
[53:37] occupation just like the the the the the
[53:40] the Peter and James they just they left
[53:41] their
[53:43] occupation it can make you leave your
[53:45] dreams your
[53:47] Ambitions this power is so great that it
[53:50] can change the very nature into God's
[53:52] Own
[53:53] nature calls us to clean up our lives
[53:56] there's no power like the power of God
[53:59] the power and that helps us gives us
[54:02] strength to lay down our own life in the
[54:05] message God's commission commissioning
[54:08] Moses brother bam says and one of the
[54:11] doctors said well I tell you I find this
[54:14] that the greatest power in the world is
[54:17] not the atomic bomb but a
[54:21] Believer with a believer in contact with
[54:26] his
[54:28] maker so a Believer that's not in
[54:31] contact with his maker is no
[54:35] power that's why we're told walk in the
[54:38] spirit and you shall not fulfill the
[54:40] lust of the flesh because you're in
[54:43] contact brother Brandon says it changes
[54:47] the whole attitude it changes his mental
[54:52] it changes his habit it changes his body
[54:55] it changes his nature
[54:58] everything when we come in contact with
[55:00] the maker and this is why it's important
[55:02] when we're in church it's not good
[55:04] enough you know just to come to church
[55:06] oh my my just to come to church to say
[55:09] we went to
[55:13] church we need to learn
[55:16] quickly that doesn't accomplish
[55:20] anything we need to be
[55:22] prepared to come in contact with God
[55:25] Amen because that's the only time things
[55:28] are going to change in our
[55:30] life Jesus speaking of the power said in
[55:33] John 1018 he says no man takes my life
[55:38] from me but I lay it down of myself he
[55:42] said I have power to lay it
[55:47] down and I have power to take it again
[55:51] this commandment have I received of my
[55:53] father and I you know Jesus gave us the
[55:56] same
[55:57] commandment he gave us the same
[55:59] commandment I just wonder how many
[56:00] people sit in church but they never
[56:02] receive it from
[56:04] God they never received the Commandment
[56:07] from
[56:09] God you
[56:12] cannot you you absolutely cannot lay
[56:15] down your life with your
[56:18] love it will not lay down its life
[56:22] unconditionally it doesn't have that
[56:24] kind of power
[56:27] but when you love
[56:29] God God sees that love he gives you
[56:32] strength it's a
[56:34] reciprocating effect that goes back and
[56:36] forth and it grows and it grows and it
[56:38] gets stronger and stronger and before
[56:39] you know it you love God so much you'll
[56:41] just do whatever he ask you to do that's
[56:43] the love of
[56:45] God you don't just you know come to
[56:47] church one time become a Christian say
[56:48] oh I got the love of God I'm going to
[56:49] try to practice it don't work like that
[56:52] it's an ongoing process that you build
[56:54] on a daily basis that's who God wants to
[56:57] spend eternity
[56:59] with John 10:17 therefore doth my father
[57:03] love me because I lay down my
[57:06] life that I might take it
[57:13] again we know God loves unconditionally
[57:16] but I think he has a special love just
[57:19] for his
[57:20] bride he reserves it just for those who
[57:23] give their all back to God what a
[57:26] privilege that we have in Christ to
[57:29] share a love that God has only reserved
[57:33] for his bride think about that we know
[57:37] that God for God so loved the world that
[57:38] he gave but to think that he is reserved
[57:41] a love just for his
[57:45] bride unfortunately we see too many
[57:48] people trying to witness with only a
[57:50] conditional
[57:52] love a love that's not willing to lay
[57:55] down their lives
[57:58] a love that will not
[58:00] give its
[58:02] all just give a little
[58:05] bit try to see a nature
[58:09] change brother brand said the message
[58:11] hear ye him and when the Great trials
[58:13] are going on God wants children who will
[58:17] display his
[58:20] love it's easy to do something for
[58:22] somebody when it's convenient when
[58:25] you've got money when you've got time
[58:28] when you can maybe you get something out
[58:31] of
[58:32] it but when the Trials come well we're
[58:35] too busy thinking about
[58:37] self but that's the time that God wants
[58:41] children who will display his love love
[58:45] that quote no wonder John said in 1 John
[58:48] 3:16 hereby perceive we the love of God
[58:52] because he laid down his life for us we
[58:55] ought to lay down our life
[58:58] for one
[59:03] another we ought
[59:05] to that's the expectation that's what
[59:08] Jesus
[59:10] said so perceive we are we going to
[59:13] perceive the love of God with
[59:16] this or we're going to
[59:19] use the
[59:21] word
[59:23] amen the true love of God inside of us
[59:26] will lay down our lives for other
[59:29] people's nature change
[59:32] amen it's one thing to help somebody
[59:36] build a
[59:37] deck to fix a car to bake a cake and
[59:42] those are all good things they're nice
[59:44] and I'm telling you people who don't
[59:46] know God do those
[59:49] things but when you are willing to work
[59:52] with somebody with the purpose and your
[59:55] focus and your whole mind your whole
[59:57] thoughts everything is on them getting a
[59:59] nature change well then you're willing
[1:00:02] to do what you got to do to get that
[1:00:05] done but understand God is not
[1:00:07] interested in how much money trusted to
[1:00:11] makes just like it's not interested in
[1:00:13] numbers how big a church
[1:00:16] is but it is interested in one Soul
[1:00:20] being
[1:00:21] changed in fact all Heaven rejoices all
[1:00:24] the angels are rejoicing there's
[1:00:25] something going on when just one person
[1:00:28] repents and says God I want to be I want
[1:00:30] it to come back to the way it used to
[1:00:34] be I love that song a new commandment I
[1:00:38] give you that you love one another as I
[1:00:40] have loved you that you also love one
[1:00:42] another and by this shall all men know
[1:00:45] that you're my disciples I just think
[1:00:47] about the last time that you really
[1:00:50] knew that you laid down your life and
[1:00:54] you stayed there
[1:00:57] you stayed there with the purpose of
[1:01:00] changing somebody's
[1:01:02] nature think about
[1:01:06] that that's the that's
[1:01:10] the other brother Ron I got to borrow
[1:01:12] your yard stick
[1:01:14] here this is this is the yard stick that
[1:01:17] God wants us to measure
[1:01:20] with because his Love Changes nature
[1:01:28] our love is
[1:01:32] limited it starts and it stops all the
[1:01:35] time but God's love just keeps
[1:01:39] going and that's why no matter how much
[1:01:42] we've got away from
[1:01:44] God like
[1:01:47] Jonah if we just turn our heart towards
[1:01:50] the
[1:01:51] Lord his love is
[1:01:54] faithful he will will receive
[1:01:57] us and we can begin to build again
[1:02:00] that's what that Psalm was all about
[1:02:02] that we heard today it starts with that
[1:02:05] desire Lord I want it to be like it was
[1:02:07] before I want to be
[1:02:10] fresh we got some scriptures on
[1:02:14] thaten Amen turn with me if you would to
[1:02:16] First John chapter 4 these are not those
[1:02:18] scriptures but they're
[1:02:22] coming we're born again by God's Own
[1:02:26] nature and when we're born again by
[1:02:29] God's nature you know what happened our
[1:02:31] nature automatically starts to be like
[1:02:35] his it automatically happens you know
[1:02:38] brother BR talked about if you if you
[1:02:40] get baptized as a
[1:02:42] sinner which we all get baptized as a
[1:02:44] sinner but I mean if you go down without
[1:02:47] a True Heart of I'm going to give you my
[1:02:50] life he says you'll just come up a wet
[1:02:54] sinner and
[1:02:56] uh there's many people that just come to
[1:02:59] church because they feel obligated to be
[1:03:02] part of a
[1:03:04] church but they're not even focusing on
[1:03:06] the change of why they're going to
[1:03:10] church but when you become born again
[1:03:13] something happens to the
[1:03:15] nature and we're supernaturally
[1:03:17] transformed by the love of God into his
[1:03:21] divine nature 1 John 4:7 says beloved
[1:03:26] let us love one
[1:03:28] another for love is of God and one thing
[1:03:31] I wanted to say and I'm sorry for
[1:03:33] interrupting my own self have you ever
[1:03:35] interrupted your own
[1:03:37] self the reason I got this is because I
[1:03:40] I really want to point out 36
[1:03:43] things that the love of God will do that
[1:03:46] human love won't do and we'll probably
[1:03:50] have more of them we go through more
[1:03:53] than 36 but I'm not going to take time
[1:03:56] to like analyze which ones they are but
[1:03:59] I'll I'll bring out a
[1:04:00] few beloved let us not let us love one
[1:04:03] another for love is of God and everyone
[1:04:05] that loveth the way that God loves is
[1:04:07] born of God and knoweth God so we just
[1:04:09] got to love the way he does and he that
[1:04:12] loveth not the way that God loves
[1:04:13] knoweth not God for God is love and we
[1:04:17] know this in John
[1:04:19] 3:16 in this was manifested the love of
[1:04:23] God towards us because that God Sent His
[1:04:26] only begotten son into the world that we
[1:04:28] might live through him now here in is
[1:04:32] love not that we loved God but that he
[1:04:36] loved us and he sent his son to be the
[1:04:41] propitiation for our
[1:04:43] sins beloved if God so loved
[1:04:47] us we ought also to love one
[1:04:51] another now we know not everybody's
[1:04:53] going to fulfill that that scripture
[1:04:55] right there
[1:04:56] but God did love the whole worlden but
[1:04:59] the whole world is not going to love one
[1:05:04] another praise God praise God we're
[1:05:07] Believers amen if we're truly born again
[1:05:11] we will love the way that God loves we
[1:05:13] will lay down our lives to see other
[1:05:15] people's nature
[1:05:18] changed into God's
[1:05:20] nature that's what it really means to
[1:05:22] lay down your life I want us to get a a
[1:05:24] real good glimpse of what it means to
[1:05:26] lay down your
[1:05:28] life you know some people go through the
[1:05:30] course of the day and they're not even
[1:05:32] thinking about a
[1:05:36] soul they're not thinking
[1:05:38] about seeing a soul
[1:05:42] changed so let me just say this how in
[1:05:44] the world can we lay down our life for
[1:05:46] somebody when we're not even thinking
[1:05:48] about a nature
[1:05:51] change see you see all the denominations
[1:05:53] they take the scripture and they say
[1:05:55] well we just need to do kind things one
[1:05:56] to another be nice to one another and
[1:05:58] you know just kind of show that you know
[1:06:00] by being nice that that God's with you
[1:06:02] and hopefully you know you'll be able to
[1:06:04] like invite him to church and and I'm
[1:06:06] I'm All understand that
[1:06:09] but laying down your
[1:06:13] life is giving yourself your time your
[1:06:16] money your mind all that God has placed
[1:06:19] your life into his hands that you can
[1:06:22] help somebody get saved and that if they
[1:06:26] are saved that you can bring them to the
[1:06:29] next
[1:06:30] level to become more like
[1:06:34] Christ to deal with them with their
[1:06:36] habits that are just so ungodly and say
[1:06:40] look God has called us to this pray with
[1:06:43] them spend time with
[1:06:45] them this is what it means to lay down
[1:06:48] her life it doesn't mean anything else
[1:06:50] don't let it mean anything else to
[1:06:54] you and that's a Vindication right
[1:06:59] there so let's let's take a look at
[1:07:01] God's yard stick agape love the
[1:07:04] unconditional love for other people's
[1:07:07] soul brother Brandon said eternal life
[1:07:09] was living for
[1:07:13] others I think about that when we when
[1:07:16] we're when we think about eternal life
[1:07:17] brother understand will there be any
[1:07:19] paint brushes will there be any tile
[1:07:22] will there be any drywall
[1:07:27] will there be any
[1:07:29] Machinery will there be any bolts will
[1:07:32] there be any guns when we think of
[1:07:36] eternal life we don't think of those
[1:07:38] natural things right so when we think
[1:07:42] about living for others don't be
[1:07:44] thinking Natural
[1:07:46] Things think about the invisible thing
[1:07:50] the spiritual thing which is the nature
[1:07:52] of every human being amen because that's
[1:07:55] unless it's converted Jesus said unless
[1:07:57] you're born again you're not
[1:07:59] going so our interest needs to be in
[1:08:02] seeing other people saved
[1:08:05] amen a new commandment I give you that
[1:08:07] you love one another as I have loved you
[1:08:11] so God wants us to use his yard stick
[1:08:15] and not ours the greatest characteristic
[1:08:18] of God's love is giving is the giving of
[1:08:22] oneself to see someone else's nature
[1:08:25] change
[1:08:26] to me that is the greatest
[1:08:28] characteristic of God's love because for
[1:08:32] God so loved the world that he gave his
[1:08:33] only begotten son so whether it's your
[1:08:36] life your time your resources everything
[1:08:38] is with the purpose that I want to see
[1:08:40] this person's nature change because
[1:08:43] that's the bird that God has on that for
[1:08:45] that
[1:08:46] person you know we may be thinking of a
[1:08:48] way that we can get Advantage you know
[1:08:50] with this person but God is interested
[1:08:53] in trying to get their nature changed am
[1:08:55] amen amen Jesus said in John 15:12 and
[1:08:59] 13 John 15:12 said this is my
[1:09:02] commandment that you love one another
[1:09:05] as I loved
[1:09:09] you we need to practice
[1:09:12] that to really really practice that
[1:09:15] Greater Love have no man than this
[1:09:19] here's God
[1:09:21] defining the greatest love that a man
[1:09:24] can have
[1:09:26] Greater Love have no man than this than
[1:09:28] a man laay down his life for his
[1:09:31] friends now Jesus did this for us but
[1:09:34] he's also telling us that we can do this
[1:09:37] too if God's love is inside of us then
[1:09:40] we can do what Jesus did
[1:09:42] amen God's love is really a love for
[1:09:47] others it's not a selfish love it's for
[1:09:50] others and he's given us so much
[1:09:53] opportunity Matthew chapter 5
[1:09:55] you know here in Matthew Chapter 5 we're
[1:09:57] going to read about 12
[1:10:00] in just in this little this little part
[1:10:03] we're going to try to measure up our
[1:10:04] life with God's yard stick here Matthew
[1:10:07] 5:38 ye have heard that had been said
[1:10:10] and ey for an eye in a two for a two but
[1:10:12] I say unto you that ye resist not evil
[1:10:16] but whosoever shall smite thee on their
[1:10:18] right cheek turn to him the other
[1:10:22] also that's that's that's inch one
[1:10:28] so what what it means to somebody hits
[1:10:31] you on the cheek is they literally said
[1:10:33] something mean to you they disrespected
[1:10:36] you they did something bad to
[1:10:39] you and the love of God says I'm not
[1:10:43] going to pay attention to that I'm just
[1:10:44] going to turn the other
[1:10:47] cheek and that's how a a disciple of
[1:10:51] Christ is
[1:10:52] measured and if any man will sue you at
[1:10:56] the law and take away your coat let him
[1:11:02] have thy cloak
[1:11:04] also wow so somebody wants to do you
[1:11:07] harm take you to
[1:11:10] court well don't just give them what
[1:11:13] they're taking from you give them
[1:11:16] more give them
[1:11:18] more wow brother John this is not a 21st
[1:11:23] century uh gospel
[1:11:25] [Laughter]
[1:11:28] but you know what the word never changes
[1:11:32] the nature of God never
[1:11:34] changes and if any man oh okay that's
[1:11:38] verse 40 in verse 41 and whosoever shall
[1:11:41] compel you to go a
[1:11:45] mile go to amen go somebody ask you to
[1:11:49] do can you come over and help me Rake
[1:11:51] some leaves yeah I'll come over and help
[1:11:53] you make rake some leaves and you want
[1:11:55] me to help with the wood and uh let me
[1:11:57] go ahead and let me just do this for you
[1:11:59] and and wash your windows and and let me
[1:12:02] do this for you now that's just
[1:12:05] scripture Saints that's just
[1:12:09] scripture and so you're you're
[1:12:11] measuring see a human love will do that
[1:12:16] sometimes but God's love will do
[1:12:19] this God's love will do this the around
[1:12:22] we're going to share this okay if you
[1:12:23] want to grab it you can
[1:12:27] verse 42 give to him that ask thee and
[1:12:31] from him that would borrow of of thee
[1:12:35] turn uh turn not thou away and there's I
[1:12:39] don't have the scripture right here but
[1:12:40] you can read in the in Jesus talking
[1:12:42] about is you want to give to people who
[1:12:45] are not going to give back to you you
[1:12:47] know you you still give it to them I
[1:12:49] mean I I got people that I've given
[1:12:51] stuff to that I've never and I got quite
[1:12:53] a few of them that never got back
[1:12:55] am and if you're a Christian you
[1:12:59] will and they that live Godly in Christ
[1:13:01] Jesus shall suffer that type of all
[1:13:04] kinds of persecution not
[1:13:05] honestly so this is what this is what it
[1:13:09] means to have the love of God in your
[1:13:11] heart now ye have heard that have been
[1:13:14] said verse 43 that thou shalt love thy
[1:13:17] neighbor and be against the one that is
[1:13:20] your enemy but I say unto you love your
[1:13:23] enemy bless them that curse you do good
[1:13:27] to them that hate you pray for them that
[1:13:29] despitefully use you and persecute you
[1:13:32] now there's five of them right in that
[1:13:33] verse five inches right in that verse so
[1:13:36] we're at nine
[1:13:38] already that you may be the children of
[1:13:40] your father which is in heaven for he
[1:13:41] makes the sun to rise on the evil and
[1:13:45] the good and he sends the rain on the
[1:13:48] just and the UN there's two more that's
[1:13:51] what the love of God will do
[1:13:55] now most people probably want to go to
[1:13:57] church and hear about how God loves
[1:13:59] them but we also believe in going to
[1:14:01] church and making sure that we're doing
[1:14:04] what God wants us to do which is love
[1:14:06] others amen for if you love them which
[1:14:09] love
[1:14:10] you where's your reward do not even the
[1:14:14] publicans the same and if you salute
[1:14:17] your brother only you God bless you I
[1:14:19] love you and greetings what do you more
[1:14:21] than others do not even the Publican
[1:14:23] soul
[1:14:26] see in other
[1:14:29] words don't use the stick that everybody
[1:14:31] else
[1:14:32] uses the publicans chuse this they
[1:14:36] they'll greet you yeah if you're a
[1:14:37] friend you want to you know hang out
[1:14:40] have a good time I'll do that with you
[1:14:43] yeah I can
[1:14:44] connect that's the stick they
[1:14:48] use but God
[1:14:50] stick is I'm going to love I'm going to
[1:14:54] give
[1:14:56] I'm going to salute I'm going to give my
[1:14:59] very best
[1:15:02] knowing that the person is going to not
[1:15:05] use me knowing the person is going to
[1:15:07] use me I'll tell you one of the hardest
[1:15:09] things to do is know that you're being
[1:15:13] used it is one of the hardest things to
[1:15:17] do because you're faced with the word
[1:15:20] now nobody wants to be
[1:15:23] used but the word just told me I'm going
[1:15:26] to be used
[1:15:28] right and I can try to be a Christian
[1:15:30] without being used but then I ain't
[1:15:32] really a
[1:15:33] Christian I'm really not
[1:15:37] Christlike and I really can't be
[1:15:40] identified as a disciple of Christ amen
[1:15:43] because I'm not loving like Christ
[1:15:47] loved for verse 48 be ye therefore
[1:15:50] perfect even as your father which is in
[1:15:53] heaven is perfect there's number 12
[1:15:56] use God's love to determine where your
[1:15:59] love is at
[1:16:01] amen all right just going to touch on
[1:16:04] forgiveness if a man trespasses against
[1:16:07] you seven times in a day seven times in
[1:16:10] a day the love of God will forgive him
[1:16:12] is that true that's right and if he goes
[1:16:14] on for 70 days that's over two months
[1:16:18] the love of God will still forgive him
[1:16:20] is that true seven time 7 that's what
[1:16:23] Jesus said
[1:16:25] now this
[1:16:27] is this to me this is such an eye opener
[1:16:29] brother
[1:16:30] on that I mean I expect God to forgive
[1:16:34] me every time I go on my
[1:16:36] knees I I forgive him to be faith I mean
[1:16:39] I forgive him excuse me I I count on him
[1:16:42] to be faithful he's known to be faithful
[1:16:45] that if I confess my sins he's faithful
[1:16:47] and just to forgive me of my
[1:16:51] unrighteousness but can I be that way
[1:16:53] towards others
[1:16:57] because if I
[1:17:00] can to the degree that God has said
[1:17:03] which is to me endless because the love
[1:17:06] of God Bears all things endures all
[1:17:08] things it just doesn't stop it is it is
[1:17:11] endless it is
[1:17:14] unconditional that's what I want you
[1:17:16] want that today amen say amen God I want
[1:17:20] this
[1:17:22] word did you know love the love of God
[1:17:25] will actually
[1:17:27] correct and did you know the love of
[1:17:29] humans will actually
[1:17:35] correct boys you know what I've told you
[1:17:39] before you do that again you made me so
[1:17:48] mad you made me look bad in front of
[1:17:50] that person
[1:17:56] human love will
[1:17:58] correct but it's all with a selfish
[1:18:02] motive now I'm not saying that we as a
[1:18:05] we as parents only have selfish that's
[1:18:08] not what I'm saying because I trust the
[1:18:11] love of God in parents to be using the
[1:18:14] love of God to
[1:18:16] correct but I'm just trying to bring a
[1:18:19] point human love corrects and usually it
[1:18:23] it's it's without love right that's the
[1:18:25] Bible says speak the truth in love
[1:18:27] because you can speak the truth and hurt
[1:18:30] somebody but speak it in love can you
[1:18:32] say Amen to the word I the more you say
[1:18:35] Amen the less it hurts right Revelation
[1:18:37] 3:19 as many as I love I rebuke and
[1:18:41] chasen be zelous therefore and repent in
[1:18:44] other words there's a direction to go
[1:18:46] when God speaks to you
[1:18:49] right you want to go in that direction
[1:18:52] you don't want to resist it John 163
[1:18:55] says how be it when he the spirit of
[1:18:56] Truth has come he will guide you into
[1:18:58] all
[1:19:01] truth verse 8 says and when he comes he
[1:19:03] will reprove that means convict tell a
[1:19:06] fa or rebuke the worldly nature that's
[1:19:09] inside of you the very fact that that
[1:19:12] the holy spirit is inside when you let
[1:19:14] the holy you how many times have you
[1:19:17] kind of like didn't want to go to church
[1:19:20] because you knew you were going to get
[1:19:22] you know convicted
[1:19:26] you didn't want to go and be
[1:19:28] convicted you know what I'm
[1:19:31] saying well I don't want to talk to them
[1:19:33] right now because they'll probably just
[1:19:35] say something about God you've talked to
[1:19:37] people that don't want to talk to you
[1:19:39] because you know you're going to bring
[1:19:41] up Christ you understand what I'm
[1:19:43] talking about and see that that is what
[1:19:46] the Holy Ghost doesn't want to sit
[1:19:47] around and make friends I'm sorry it's
[1:19:49] not interested in having a big campaign
[1:19:51] he's not a politician he wants to see
[1:19:53] Souls changed Nature's changed so there
[1:19:56] is a motive that God has and when we
[1:19:58] come together and have family devotions
[1:20:00] and pray and read the Bible we should be
[1:20:02] looking for a change to take place
[1:20:04] that's why we do
[1:20:06] it we need to do
[1:20:09] it the Bram said in the message why he
[1:20:12] says and if we can't love one another
[1:20:16] how are we going to love God who we
[1:20:19] haven't
[1:20:20] seen we must find the thing we've got to
[1:20:24] love one another though we differ you
[1:20:27] got to love anyhow you can't Bluff
[1:20:31] it you got to be you got to really do it
[1:20:35] the greatest power I have found in
[1:20:38] healing how many wants healing the
[1:20:40] greatest power I found in healing is
[1:20:44] love and when you have sympathy and love
[1:20:47] for the people trying to help them
[1:20:51] sometimes I scold them and I go back
[1:20:54] home
[1:20:56] and just think this is Brother Bram
[1:20:59] talking now he says
[1:21:01] Lord what did I what did I do that for
[1:21:05] question mark well I could relate to
[1:21:08] that one I don't know how many times I
[1:21:10] thought why why did I do
[1:21:15] that but it's because I love them
[1:21:18] brother Ren
[1:21:19] said if I have to scold my little boy
[1:21:22] for running out into the street if I he
[1:21:26] says if I have to scold my little boy
[1:21:28] for running out in the street he will
[1:21:30] get killed if I don't get him off the
[1:21:32] street sometimes I have to whip them
[1:21:34] correct them and say son stay off the
[1:21:36] street not because I don't love that
[1:21:40] child it's because I do love that child
[1:21:43] right and that's the way that God has to
[1:21:46] do with us he scolds us he shakes us and
[1:21:49] he has to make it
[1:21:52] real a person that lets his child just
[1:21:55] do
[1:21:56] anything is not good uh a person that
[1:22:00] just lets his child do anything is not a
[1:22:03] good
[1:22:05] parent that's
[1:22:07] right there's too much of that in
[1:22:09] America today yes sir we need the
[1:22:12] oldfashioned
[1:22:14] mothers praise the Lord so glad this
[1:22:17] word has been preserved for us Look what
[1:22:20] Jesus said in Revelations 2:4 if we can
[1:22:22] put that up Revelations 2:4 for
[1:22:24] nevertheless I have somewhat against
[1:22:27] thee because thou has left thy first
[1:22:33] love so I when brother Gordy was singing
[1:22:36] this song I couldn't help but to think
[1:22:38] about this the scripture that I already
[1:22:39] had in my
[1:22:41] notes and and how many how many feels
[1:22:44] that you've gotten away from the love of
[1:22:46] Goden
[1:22:47] before amen amen you know the feeling
[1:22:51] and and I'll say it like this have you
[1:22:53] ever been so close to God that you would
[1:22:55] just do
[1:22:57] anything have you ever been so close to
[1:22:59] God that you just do almost
[1:23:02] everything have you been so close to God
[1:23:04] that you just do maybe half have you
[1:23:09] been so close to God that just you a
[1:23:12] part your quarter have you been so close
[1:23:14] to God that you didn't want to go to
[1:23:17] church right you know what I'm talking
[1:23:21] about and the and the thing is we ought
[1:23:24] to be on
[1:23:26] fire the love of God should cause us I
[1:23:29] can't wait till the doors are open I
[1:23:31] can't wait to get in there I can't wait
[1:23:33] to get close to
[1:23:35] God and if you're feeling that way I'm
[1:23:37] just going to tell you the Holy Ghost
[1:23:39] has preeminence in your
[1:23:41] life and if you're not feeling
[1:23:45] that I think God came and ministered to
[1:23:47] us through a song today and all we need
[1:23:50] to do is just hunger God draw me back to
[1:23:53] that place so here Jesus nevertheless I
[1:23:56] have so much to say against thee because
[1:23:58] thou has left thy First Love remember
[1:24:00] therefore from whence Thou Art
[1:24:04] fallen and repent and do the first works
[1:24:09] or else I will come quickly and remove
[1:24:12] thy Candlestick out of his place except
[1:24:15] thou
[1:24:17] repent I thank God for Grace you know
[1:24:20] what Grace is Grace is a time to make
[1:24:23] things right
[1:24:25] amen and I'm so thankful for God's grace
[1:24:27] but but we know one day it's going to be
[1:24:30] all over people will still be coming to
[1:24:33] the
[1:24:34] altar thinking they're getting saved and
[1:24:36] they're
[1:24:37] not because they let their time slip
[1:24:41] away we've got to recognize the time of
[1:24:43] our visitation when we come to church it
[1:24:45] is if our heart isn't I want to enter
[1:24:48] into you Lord you know it's just not
[1:24:50] going
[1:24:51] to you got to have a heart that I want
[1:24:54] more more of you today Lord than I've
[1:24:55] ever had
[1:24:56] before in the message hear ye him
[1:24:59] brother Brandon says come with come come
[1:25:01] with it with love the world is dying
[1:25:04] today for love Christians today we've
[1:25:06] got fine scly churches wonderful
[1:25:10] buildings but we got weak
[1:25:13] pulpits he said there's something wrong
[1:25:16] the congregation don't feel to one
[1:25:19] another like they used
[1:25:22] to preach it brother brandham
[1:25:25] he said there's something missing the
[1:25:28] world is looking to that Christians what
[1:25:32] we need today is the baptism of Love on
[1:25:35] one
[1:25:36] another and he said this will all men
[1:25:39] know you are my disciples when you have
[1:25:41] love one for another and no man have
[1:25:45] greater love than this than a man lay
[1:25:46] down his life for his friends here ye
[1:25:50] him appreciate that quote we're living
[1:25:52] in perilous times church people are
[1:25:55] literally in love with themselves and in
[1:25:57] love with Pleasures more than they are
[1:25:59] with God so how how how can we get more
[1:26:03] of God when we just I'll give you some
[1:26:06] God but I really want
[1:26:08] this Jesus said in the last days because
[1:26:11] iniquity in our lives iniquity in our
[1:26:14] minds iniquity in our hearts because it
[1:26:17] would abound the love of many would wax
[1:26:19] cold where I don't even feel like trying
[1:26:22] and and and loving put my arm and and
[1:26:25] and being affectionate and and telling
[1:26:27] somebody hey I've been praying for you I
[1:26:28] care about you what can I do to help
[1:26:31] you why is that
[1:26:34] missing because
[1:26:36] iniquity
[1:26:37] iniquity Jesus told us why we don't we
[1:26:41] don't we don't need to go any further
[1:26:42] than the word the word tells us
[1:26:45] right but yet at the same time that this
[1:26:48] is happening and and the people are
[1:26:50] Falling
[1:26:51] Away there's a a caps Stone that's
[1:26:55] coming down on the Bride of Jesus
[1:26:59] Christ and that Capstone is perfect love
[1:27:02] it's what we've been talking about it's
[1:27:04] why we're measuring today because it's a
[1:27:07] paradox why the world is is is is an
[1:27:10] apostasy and is going away from the love
[1:27:13] of God there is a small a very tiny
[1:27:16] little group of people who love God with
[1:27:18] their heart and they're calling on God
[1:27:21] God fill me with your love that I can
[1:27:23] that that I could be your
[1:27:28] wife because God wants to marry someone
[1:27:31] that loves him as much as he loves
[1:27:35] them that's what's happening right now
[1:27:37] it's a
[1:27:39] paradox the rest of the church don't
[1:27:41] even recognize it they're just they're
[1:27:43] satisfied with going to church satisfied
[1:27:45] with being in the
[1:27:50] message brother bam said the mess is the
[1:27:52] statue of a perfect man he says then
[1:27:55] they're waiting for the headstone which
[1:27:57] is love for God is love in the message
[1:28:03] god making his promise we need
[1:28:06] Christians like that who will display
[1:28:08] Jesus Christ that's right the love of
[1:28:11] God in our hearts that's what we need
[1:28:14] the Manifest the
[1:28:17] display I tell you if there's something
[1:28:19] that warms my
[1:28:20] heart is when I feel somebody loves in
[1:28:27] me but somebody just telling me the
[1:28:32] word just telling me
[1:28:36] something I don't always feel it and not
[1:28:39] that we go by feelings but you know
[1:28:41] brother brandom says you can't fake it
[1:28:43] you can't Bluff
[1:28:45] it you've all seen those pictures where
[1:28:49] they got that fake fire going you walk
[1:28:52] in and this thing's going like this and
[1:28:53] it's Amber lights and they're moving you
[1:28:56] go up there and you don't feel a
[1:29:00] thing it's not real
[1:29:03] right but there's something about the
[1:29:05] love of God when it's being projected
[1:29:07] towards you you know
[1:29:09] it you know
[1:29:13] it God is calling us to manifest love
[1:29:17] not just well I think the church should
[1:29:20] be doing this and brother Gordy you
[1:29:22] should have played my favorite song
[1:29:23] today
[1:29:25] you know I asked you to do
[1:29:27] it and you sister Genie you you know
[1:29:30] I've
[1:29:31] been you know what kind of cookies I
[1:29:38] like no it's not about what everybody
[1:29:40] else should be manifesting it's about
[1:29:42] what you should be
[1:29:44] manifesting it's not what should the
[1:29:47] what can the church do for me is what
[1:29:50] you can do to to be a part of the church
[1:29:53] to help the church
[1:29:55] church I love the word 1 John 3: 1 says
[1:30:01] and we need to hurry because time has
[1:30:03] gotten way too far too far too
[1:30:07] far 1 John chapter 3:1 be behold what
[1:30:11] manner of love the father have bestowed
[1:30:13] upon us that we should be called the
[1:30:15] sons of
[1:30:17] God therefore the world knoweth us
[1:30:20] not because it knew him not
[1:30:25] beloved now are we the sons of God it
[1:30:27] does not yet appear what we shall be but
[1:30:30] but we know that when he shall appear we
[1:30:32] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:30:34] as he is so we're going to be we're
[1:30:36] going to be bestowing love upon others
[1:30:40] the same manner of love the father has
[1:30:42] bestowed upon us we're going to be
[1:30:44] bestowing upon others that's how we're
[1:30:46] going to be like
[1:30:48] him it's it's not going to be I I
[1:30:51] believe God I know God in the message is
[1:30:55] a
[1:30:55] manifestation of that love towards
[1:30:59] others and every man that has this hope
[1:31:02] in him purifies himself even as he is
[1:31:06] pure amen how many has that hope this
[1:31:09] morning that you're going to you're
[1:31:11] going to be like Christ and I'll tell
[1:31:14] you if you do have that hope if it's a
[1:31:15] hope inside of you I know today that
[1:31:17] you're working with a a
[1:31:20] desire to make yourself better
[1:31:25] to purify yourself if that if that hope
[1:31:27] is there you you just are you're just
[1:31:29] you are ra said the message Blasphemous
[1:31:32] names he says first foundationally is
[1:31:35] Faith second add to your faith virtue to
[1:31:37] Virtue Knowledge from knowledge
[1:31:40] Temperance from Temperance patience
[1:31:42] patience godliness and from godliness
[1:31:44] Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and
[1:31:46] and then love being the Capstone now
[1:31:50] seven of those seven of those things
[1:31:53] seven Church AG see seven stars seven
[1:31:55] Church ages all of it tempered together
[1:31:58] by the Holy Spirit now that's what it
[1:32:00] takes to become a servant of
[1:32:03] Christ I read that and I just about fell
[1:32:08] over it takes that to be a servant of
[1:32:15] Christ don't just try to take one don't
[1:32:18] try to be a servant without it you know
[1:32:21] we got so many self-proclaimed servants
[1:32:23] right
[1:32:24] but the prophet said it takes this to be
[1:32:26] a servant of Christ Christ builds his
[1:32:29] church in seven Church ages his bride a
[1:32:32] person a woman a church seven Church
[1:32:34] ages constitute and makes the bride and
[1:32:39] some of this age and some out of that
[1:32:41] age some out of another age and all
[1:32:43] together and shaping it like a
[1:32:51] pyramid I believe
[1:32:53] the bride of
[1:32:55] Christ is the absolute best servant on
[1:32:59] the
[1:33:01] planet now she is she will be she is the
[1:33:04] only one that will be fit to ruin
[1:33:07] Reign she'll have the
[1:33:10] character but you know she just followed
[1:33:12] her her husband
[1:33:15] Jesus right who who made himself of no
[1:33:18] reputation laid down his life became
[1:33:21] obedient took on the the the the form of
[1:33:24] a servant of a man and he he just
[1:33:29] served and the and the bride that same
[1:33:31] Spirit comes upon the bride and it's
[1:33:33] been building there's more expected in
[1:33:36] this age than there was the first church
[1:33:38] age and she will manifest what it means
[1:33:41] to be a true
[1:33:44] servant and God says that's the one
[1:33:48] that's going to sit on my throne and
[1:33:51] Rule and reign with me
[1:33:54] amen the one that's working her tail
[1:33:59] off to see other nature change because
[1:34:03] that's God's priority right and we need
[1:34:06] to get our priority sunk in with God's
[1:34:09] because I tell you when it's all over
[1:34:11] when Jesus comes he really ain't going
[1:34:13] to care how many jobs they got out the
[1:34:16] door how much money I made how many cars
[1:34:19] I had then there's going to be no
[1:34:20] interest there with God his interest is
[1:34:23] is going to be the the jewels come from
[1:34:27] the souls that we get saved so how many
[1:34:30] Souls have we have we got saved how many
[1:34:32] souls are we working
[1:34:34] on Amen how many souls are we working on
[1:34:38] I I know this is this this but look look
[1:34:42] I would I I would not
[1:34:44] be I would not do you any justice in my
[1:34:47] life if I'm measuring your life with
[1:34:50] this
[1:34:53] and I don't want to face you on the
[1:34:55] other
[1:34:56] side with a watered down
[1:35:00] gospel I'd rather have the facts up
[1:35:02] front amen Galatians 5:13 for brother we
[1:35:05] have been called unto
[1:35:07] Liberty only use not your you only use
[1:35:10] not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh
[1:35:14] but by
[1:35:15] love serve one another is't that
[1:35:19] beautiful God's given us all Liberty we
[1:35:22] got Liberty what are we dealing with it
[1:35:25] nobody's going to tell me what to do I'm
[1:35:26] going to do this I'm going
[1:35:30] to you with your Liberty you're supposed
[1:35:32] to serve one
[1:35:34] another for all the laws fulfilled in
[1:35:37] one word even in this Thou shalt love
[1:35:39] thy neighbor as
[1:35:44] thyself we've been called to
[1:35:47] Liberty so
[1:35:54] we don't want to use that liberty for
[1:35:56] ourselves we want to use it for one
[1:36:00] another we want to serve the body we
[1:36:03] want to esteem others more than
[1:36:05] ourselves we want to focus on trying to
[1:36:08] help somebody get closer to God and not
[1:36:11] just become a good friend with
[1:36:13] him we want to be spiritually washing
[1:36:16] people's feet I know we had foot washing
[1:36:18] but we need to be practicing the
[1:36:19] spiritual foot washing find somebody's
[1:36:22] feet that you can help walk
[1:36:25] labor and
[1:36:26] prayer carry a burden for somebody's
[1:36:29] nature
[1:36:30] change when we're living and walking and
[1:36:34] laboring to see somebody changed we know
[1:36:38] that we're walking with the love of God
[1:36:41] in our
[1:36:42] heart and that's what it means to
[1:36:46] serve one
[1:36:48] another all right we can't we can't go
[1:36:51] we can't stop the service now there's a
[1:36:53] lot I'm not going to get to but we can't
[1:36:54] stop the service without going 1
[1:36:56] Corinthians
[1:36:57] 13 because in this there's like 15
[1:37:01] inches in these verses 15 points that
[1:37:04] the love of God will do that human love
[1:37:07] it's not even on the stick you can't
[1:37:09] even get it on
[1:37:10] there 1 Corinthians 13 starting with
[1:37:14] verse four charity suffereth
[1:37:17] long and is kind charity envieth not
[1:37:22] charity vaunteth not itself and is not
[1:37:25] puffed up there's quite a few right in
[1:37:27] that one verse it does not behave itself
[1:37:30] unseemingly it seeketh not her own is
[1:37:32] not easily provoked thinketh no
[1:37:35] evil but it re it rejoiceth not in
[1:37:38] iniquity but rejoiceth in the
[1:37:42] truth see as much as you may not
[1:37:46] like maybe a strong message this is
[1:37:50] really not a strong message but it could
[1:37:52] be
[1:37:54] the love of God inside you should be
[1:37:57] rejoicing just rejoicing for this truth
[1:38:00] that we're hearing
[1:38:03] today it beareth all things it believeth
[1:38:06] all things it hopeth all things it
[1:38:10] endureth all
[1:38:11] things charity never
[1:38:16] faileth that's it right there and uh we
[1:38:20] don't got time to read it but as as you
[1:38:22] know this is being typed in verse 11
[1:38:25] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[1:38:27] understood as a child I thought as a
[1:38:29] child but when I became a man I put away
[1:38:33] the childish things in other words this
[1:38:37] is the message charity grows
[1:38:41] up Charity grows up it don't stay like a
[1:38:45] baby it grows
[1:38:49] up and I I believe the bride the bride
[1:38:52] grows up
[1:38:54] but there's a lot of other people
[1:38:56] remember there was only Joshua and Caleb
[1:38:58] there was those were the only two that
[1:39:02] that really grew
[1:39:04] up because they wholly followed the Lord
[1:39:08] they had a different Spirit where the
[1:39:09] other ones they just no no I want to
[1:39:12] stay baby I want to go back into Egypt I
[1:39:14] wanna I I want to you know back there at
[1:39:16] least I could you know do this and do
[1:39:18] that and I could at least have
[1:39:20] this kind of out here in the wilderness
[1:39:23] in between right supposed to be serving
[1:39:26] God supposed to be going to church but
[1:39:27] you know think my knees aren't getting
[1:39:30] taken care of murmuring
[1:39:34] complaining we got to grow
[1:39:36] up Romans 5:2 we we need to read this
[1:39:41] because you had you said you have a hope
[1:39:44] in you right all right we need to read
[1:39:46] this five Romans 52 by whom also we have
[1:39:51] access by faith into this great where in
[1:39:53] We Stand and rejoice in the hope of the
[1:39:56] glory of God and not only so but we
[1:39:59] glory in tribulations knowing that
[1:40:01] tribulation it works patience how else
[1:40:04] are we going to get to the love of God
[1:40:06] right we because love of God is patient
[1:40:09] so we need the trials to get there and
[1:40:11] then impatience experience and patient
[1:40:14] and patience experience and experience
[1:40:17] brings more
[1:40:19] hope you ever been to a place where you
[1:40:21] just seem like all hope is gone
[1:40:24] start exercising just a little bit and
[1:40:28] that will produce a little bit more and
[1:40:29] before you know you'll have
[1:40:31] more amen and hope maketh not ashamed
[1:40:36] because the love of God is shed abroad
[1:40:38] in our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is
[1:40:41] given to
[1:40:43] us so you cannot
[1:40:46] have the you cannot have the love of God
[1:40:50] in you if you don't have the Holy Ghost
[1:40:52] In You
[1:40:54] now you can have it on you you can
[1:40:57] experience it but I'm talking about if
[1:41:00] you just if you focus on one thing I
[1:41:02] know we talked about a lot of things and
[1:41:03] I'm not asking you to go home and make
[1:41:04] sure you put all 36 things into practice
[1:41:07] today but what I am asking you to do is
[1:41:10] if if you want truly to be a disciple of
[1:41:13] Christ to where you line up with the
[1:41:16] word just seek more of the Holy
[1:41:19] Ghost get serious about about you make
