[31:21] amen you remember that night he came to
[31:23] you
[31:24] do you remember where he was at i
[31:26] remember
[31:27] i'll never forget
[31:29] there's no building by myself down in
[31:31] jonesburg tennessee about two o'clock in
[31:34] the afternoon
[31:36] i've been out drinking the night before
[31:39] i had a habit of my life i come out of
[31:41] the army with some habits that i'd be
[31:42] ashamed for you to know and
[31:44] i've been out all night long and
[31:47] there's an old building about two
[31:48] o'clock in the afternoon on a sunday
[31:50] he came into the room where i was at
[31:55] i knew it was him because i felt him
[31:57] when i was a
[31:58] boy and a voice spoke and said you go
[32:01] out that door i'll never call you again
[32:04] and there
[32:05] and that old building by myself
[32:08] i knelt at that door of that building
[32:10] and gave my heart to the lord
[32:15] amen
[32:17] you know i called that old place
[32:19] my birthplace
[32:22] and i used to
[32:23] you know you travel some you get a
[32:25] little tired
[32:26] i used to go down by there and i get a
[32:28] little tired and i pull in there and i
[32:30] just sit and remember
[32:32] sometimes it's good to just sit and
[32:34] remember
[32:36] what the lord did for you
[32:38] and i would just sit there and remember
[32:40] that day that he came to me and i got
[32:42] busy traveling it had been several years
[32:44] since i've been by that way and i was
[32:46] over in that part of the woods and i
[32:49] said you know i believe i'll go by the
[32:50] old birthplace
[32:52] i went down by there and it was gone
[32:55] the building was tore down
[32:57] the parking lot was changed there's a
[33:00] big supermarket there in the big old
[33:01] paint parking lot and lots everywhere
[33:04] kind of hurt my feelings a little bit
[33:06] but then i thought you know that's right
[33:09] they can change the landscape they can
[33:11] change the building
[33:12] but they can never take out of my heart
[33:15] what the lord did for me that day
[33:18] amen
[33:19] you'll never know him just by reading
[33:21] we have to know him by experience
[33:24] amen and i'm glad that we can deny do
[33:27] you love him
[33:28] we're kind of an honor to be with you
[33:29] and if you have your bibles turn with us
[33:31] to the book of mark and
[33:33] i just been
[33:34] seeking the lord all day of which
[33:36] direction to go and we trust her to
[33:38] please this would be pleasing to you we
[33:40] thought we'd take some of this and tied
[33:42] in with some of the last night and uh
[33:44] looking forward as we move into the
[33:46] dedicational service tomorrow of the of
[33:48] the new church that the lord has blessed
[33:49] you with and
[33:51] uh
[33:52] you know we looked at the scripture last
[33:53] night where the lord said my word will
[33:55] not return unto me void but it will
[33:56] accomplish that which i please amen and
[33:59] so you know when i was thinking on the
[34:01] theme of a new church and a dedication
[34:03] and you know what would we want to be
[34:05] and so i you know we'd want a church
[34:07] that he would be pleased to come and
[34:08] dwell in amen and so we looked at last
[34:11] night of what i was on this theme of
[34:12] what kind of church does god really want
[34:15] i mean does he want stained glass
[34:16] windows and fine carpet and fine pews
[34:19] and highly
[34:21] robed choirs and that might be all right
[34:23] but what does god really want for his
[34:25] church amen and so we looked at last
[34:27] night you know that god wants a church
[34:29] that will not turn back
[34:30] that no matter how bad the situation is
[34:33] or no matter what they throw at her she
[34:34] keeps marching towards the promise amen
[34:37] no turning back we're not going back
[34:39] we're going forward amen and so we
[34:41] looked at that last night and tonight we
[34:43] want to look at a thought of another
[34:45] along the lines of that god wants a
[34:47] church
[34:48] like him
[34:50] like him and that's what we want to look
[34:52] at tonight if you have your bibles turn
[34:53] with us to mark 10 we want to read
[34:55] starting at verse 35 and may the lord
[34:57] richly bless you and i appreciate
[35:00] brother john allowing us to come and i
[35:02] know dedicational services this weekend
[35:05] i
[35:06] i know he could have got a much
[35:08] greater minister to come and preach and
[35:10] yet he allowed me to come and i
[35:12] certainly appreciate that and i trust
[35:14] something to be said to help you and
[35:16] encourage you along the way
[35:18] but we want to read now from mark 10
[35:20] verse 35
[35:23] do you love him
[35:26] the bible says this
[35:27] then james and john the sons of zebedee
[35:31] came unto him saying master we would
[35:33] that thou should just do for us
[35:36] whatsoever we shall desire
[35:38] and he said unto them what would ye that
[35:40] i should do for you
[35:42] and they said unto him grant unto us
[35:44] that we may sit on thy right hand and
[35:47] the other on thy left hand in thy glory
[35:51] but jesus said unto them ye know not
[35:53] what you ask
[35:55] can you drink of the cup that i drink of
[35:58] and be baptized with the baptism that i
[36:01] am baptized with
[36:03] and they said unto him
[36:06] we can
[36:08] a good positive attitude
[36:10] we can
[36:11] and jesus said unto them ye shall indeed
[36:15] drink
[36:17] of the cup that i drink of and with the
[36:19] baptism that i am baptized with
[36:22] shall ye
[36:23] be
[36:24] baptized
[36:26] amen
[36:27] may the lord have the blessing to the
[36:28] reading of his word i want to speak to a
[36:31] few minutes this evening on ye shall
[36:33] indeed
[36:37] let us bow our heads
[36:43] oh lord
[36:46] father how we thank you this
[36:49] evening lord for your mercy that's been
[36:51] given to us
[36:54] and lord we thank you for the
[36:56] opportunity that we have to serve you
[36:58] lord
[37:00] knowing dear god that our faith tonight
[37:02] does not rest upon imagination dear god
[37:06] it doesn't rest upon an organization or
[37:08] a denominational program
[37:10] but our faith rests solely upon the word
[37:13] of god
[37:14] and lord as the old fellow said that
[37:16] time and he they ask him why do you
[37:18] carry the bible around you can't even
[37:19] read it
[37:20] he said because i carried around because
[37:22] i believe it
[37:24] he said i'd rather be standing upon the
[37:26] word than standing in the heavens
[37:28] and they said why would you say such a
[37:30] thing he said because the word said
[37:32] heavens that shall pass away but the
[37:34] word shall never fail and oh god that's
[37:37] where we want to anchor ourselves
[37:39] tonight is solely upon the word of god
[37:42] knowing lord that you'll bankrupt heaven
[37:45] before you let one promise fail the
[37:47] believer
[37:48] father we ask tonight lord that you
[37:50] would take this thought god and may the
[37:52] people understand it in the way lord
[37:54] that our hearts desire is to bring it
[37:56] god that you want a people lord who will
[37:59] be just like you and father we believe
[38:02] that through calvary lord through the
[38:04] death burial and the resurrection thou
[38:07] hast made a way lord for your church to
[38:09] accomplish that
[38:11] father god may we follow that program
[38:13] for it leads to eternal life bless your
[38:16] children tonight lord those that would
[38:17] be sick god those that would have a need
[38:20] may you just move among them lord in a
[38:22] great way and father we thank you for
[38:24] touching sister lafontaine last night
[38:26] lord and just the reading of the
[38:28] scripture just the quoting of the
[38:29] scripture at the end of the service
[38:32] of laying down the sleep that's asleep
[38:34] shall be sweet and the sister testified
[38:36] today that she went home and reminded
[38:39] you of that promise
[38:40] said she had been unable to sleep for
[38:42] several nights
[38:43] but she laid down and her sleep was
[38:45] sweet
[38:46] thank you lord
[38:48] thank you for keeping your word
[38:50] bless your children now father we ask
[38:52] for we ask these things in jesus name
[38:54] and the bride says
[38:56] amen god bless you may be seated
[38:58] now matthew in the matthew's version of
[39:00] it matthew 20 they said then came to him
[39:03] the mother of zebedee the children of
[39:04] her sons worshipping him and desiring a
[39:07] certain thing of him and he said unto
[39:09] her what will thou and she said unto him
[39:11] grant that these my two sons may sit
[39:13] thee one on the right hand and the other
[39:15] on the left and in thy kingdom
[39:17] now in the reading of the scriptures we
[39:18] find that there's two accounts of this
[39:20] event
[39:21] mark said it was james and john who
[39:23] asked jesus this question matthew said
[39:25] it was the mother that asked jesus this
[39:28] question but both matthew and mark
[39:30] agreed that it was james and john who
[39:32] answered we can
[39:34] and i believe that every person in this
[39:37] building this time can answer this same
[39:39] question by faith and the grace of
[39:41] almighty god is we can we can't overcome
[39:45] laodicea we can't overcome the devil we
[39:48] can't overcome habits in our life we can
[39:50] be victorious in this area that we're
[39:52] living in we can take a body change we
[39:54] can take a rapture why because the word
[39:56] of god says so amen
[39:58] oh my then we find in this passage of
[40:01] scriptures that they were desiring a
[40:03] position in his kingdom one wanting to
[40:05] sit on his right hand and the other
[40:07] wanting to sit on his left and jesus
[40:09] said unto them you don't know what
[40:11] you're asking you won't
[40:13] do you want to be a part of this kingdom
[40:15] and he said can you drink of the cup
[40:17] that i drink and can you be baptized
[40:20] with the baptism that i'm baptized with
[40:23] notice now he never said a cup
[40:26] in matthew he said my cup but he never
[40:29] said a baptism but he said this baptism
[40:33] the same cup the same baptism the same
[40:37] cup the same baptism and the word same
[40:40] means identical can you drink of the
[40:43] same cup and the same baptism and they
[40:46] said yes we can and jesus said ye shall
[40:50] indeed
[40:52] ye shall indeed not hope so not maybe
[40:55] not could be but you shall indeed
[40:59] it reminds me of elijah and elisha in
[41:01] the bible after 10 years of following
[41:04] elijah and his message and god never cut
[41:07] the message of elijah to fit elisha but
[41:10] he shaped elisha to fit elijah's message
[41:13] amen or his mantle and it came to pass
[41:16] that after 10 years we'd gone over and
[41:18] elijah said unto elisha ask what i shall
[41:20] do for thee before i be taken away from
[41:23] thee and elijah said i pray let a double
[41:26] portion of thy spirit be upon me and he
[41:29] said thou hast asked a hard thing
[41:31] nevertheless if thou see me when i go
[41:33] when i'm taken from me then thou shall
[41:35] be so unto thee if not it shall not be
[41:37] so and it came to pass the bible said
[41:40] that they still went on and talked and
[41:41] behold there appeared a charitable fire
[41:43] and horses of fire parted them both
[41:45] asunder and elijah went up into a
[41:47] whirlwind and elisha saw it and he cried
[41:49] out my father and my father
[41:51] the chariots of israel and the horsemen
[41:53] thereof and he saw him no more and down
[41:55] from the heavens came the mantle of
[41:57] elisha
[41:59] now notice they went down to the river
[42:02] and elijah took the mantle and he struck
[42:04] the water and the water parted and they
[42:06] went to the other side and elijah said
[42:08] unto elisha what do you will that i
[42:10] would do for you before i leave and
[42:12] elisha said i want a double portion of
[42:14] your spirit and elijah said thou has
[42:16] asked a hard thing but nonetheless if
[42:18] you see me when i go you can have what
[42:21] you asked for the charity fire came down
[42:23] picked up elijah and elisha kept his
[42:25] eyes on the promise and let me say
[42:27] that's what you must do tonight don't
[42:29] look at the situation don't look at that
[42:31] crippled leg don't look at that blinded
[42:33] eye keep your eye on the promise amen i
[42:36] am the lord thy god that healeth thee
[42:40] amen it comes and kept his eye upon the
[42:43] promise and when elijah went up down out
[42:46] of heaven came the mantle
[42:48] and elisha
[42:50] picked up the medal hang on here for a
[42:51] second he picked up the mantle
[42:54] don't be taking my man on
[42:58] hey buddy god bless you good to see you
[43:00] hey man
[43:02] watch your brother that's my man
[43:07] amen he saw the medal came down and the
[43:09] bible said he took the medal of elisha
[43:12] of elijah and he ripped his own clothes
[43:17] he rent his own clothes you know
[43:19] sometimes we need to rip off those
[43:22] garments of fear
[43:23] and the garments of doubt have the
[43:25] garments of depression and the oh my
[43:28] have the garments of our opinions and
[43:30] our own ideals we need to rip those
[43:32] garments off of it well i'll tell you
[43:34] the best thing i've ever done was take
[43:36] off the old coat and put on the new
[43:37] abraham hallelujah he ripped off his
[43:40] coat and he picked up the metal and
[43:42] elijah hallelujah and he goes down to
[43:44] the same river with the same metal with
[43:46] the same anointing hallelujah and he
[43:49] took the mantle and he struck the water
[43:51] and he said where is the god of elijah
[43:53] he oh my he wasn't asking a question he
[43:56] was making a statement that the god of
[43:59] elijah does now rest with elisha
[44:02] that's right
[44:06] amen
[44:07] not another mantle the same
[44:10] manner
[44:12] amen
[44:14] hallelujah
[44:15] oh my he took the same metal to the same
[44:19] water with the same god and got the same
[44:22] results
[44:24] because
[44:25] it was the same ministry
[44:28] thank you brother god bless you buddy
[44:30] amen
[44:32] but what did he ask for he asked for a
[44:34] double portion of his spirit
[44:36] that's right
[44:38] now look the prophet of god said one
[44:39] place that elijah had done four great
[44:42] miracles and elisha done eight
[44:45] double portion
[44:47] greater
[44:49] greater only but greater
[44:51] greater but only greater in in
[44:55] quantity and not quality i always have
[44:57] to slow down i say it backwards every
[44:59] time
[45:01] only greater equality not quality the
[45:05] quality was the same amen
[45:07] look at ruth and boaz ruth following the
[45:09] instructions of the naomi she goes down
[45:12] to the threshing floor in the barley
[45:14] season and nominee said cover yourself
[45:16] and go down there and mark the spot
[45:18] where he lays and when he lays down you
[45:20] lay down at his feet
[45:22] at about midnight
[45:24] boaz awoke and said who's there
[45:27] he felt somebody and she said it's ruth
[45:30] the handmaid spread thy garment thy
[45:33] skirt garment over me for thou art a
[45:36] near kisman and boaz took his garment
[45:40] and spread his garment over her
[45:43] she was covered
[45:46] she was covered
[45:48] by the same garment he was covered by
[45:52] not another garbage same garment
[45:55] amen
[45:57] she arose up early in the morning the
[45:58] bible said and he said to her take the
[46:00] veil that you're veiled with and he
[46:02] measured out six measures of fine barley
[46:05] a measure for each day
[46:08] oh wait a minute preacher
[46:10] there's seven days in the week you
[46:11] messed up no i didn't
[46:15] he gave her six measures of fine barley
[46:17] one measure for each day but you see on
[46:20] the seventh day he never gave her a
[46:22] measure you know why because of the
[46:24] sabbath day she didn't get a measure she
[46:27] got the lord of the harvest
[46:30] hallelujah and then the seven amen in
[46:33] the seven days we don't just get a
[46:34] prophecy we don't just get a tongue but
[46:37] every redemptive blessing amen is given
[46:39] back to the church
[46:43] hallelujah
[46:44] oh my you don't need a measure on the
[46:47] seventh day because on the seventh day
[46:49] she got him
[46:53] the lord of the harvest the two becoming
[46:56] one
[46:58] she laid at his feet
[47:00] with the same skirt same garment that he
[47:02] was covered with elijah and elisha share
[47:06] the same rule boaz and ruth
[47:08] share the same garment
[47:10] james and john was desiring to sit with
[47:13] him in glory
[47:15] to be
[47:17] where he was
[47:18] let me tell you something that is a
[47:20] great request
[47:22] i love that song you know we sing i just
[47:24] want to be where you are
[47:27] that's all they desired
[47:29] they just wanted to be where he was
[47:32] desire to sit with him in glory and
[47:34] jesus turned to james and john and said
[47:37] can you drink of the cup i drink from
[47:41] in other words she said unto them can
[47:43] you share
[47:44] in what i'm partaking of
[47:47] can you
[47:48] be a part of this
[47:50] are you a participator or a spectator
[47:55] can you get involved or sit idle
[48:00] amen i don't want to just come to church
[48:01] and sit
[48:04] if i come to church i want to do
[48:05] something
[48:07] i want to come through those doors
[48:08] shouting praises i want to come through
[48:10] those doors exalting my god
[48:13] that when i leave the building i can say
[48:14] what that sign said this day i give my
[48:17] all
[48:18] for jesus christ
[48:20] amen
[48:22] can you be a part of this can you be a
[48:24] part of what i'm a part of can you share
[48:26] in this he was asking them
[48:28] can you drink of the cup
[48:31] but what is the cup
[48:33] what is the color that he was asking can
[48:36] you drink of this cup i'm drinking from
[48:38] notice the cup was not empty
[48:41] nobody drinks one empty cup
[48:45] unless you got problems
[48:49] so what is the cup
[48:50] that he drank from
[48:52] that he asked him can you drink of this
[48:55] cup not a cup
[48:57] not a cup
[48:58] this cup
[49:00] that i drink from
[49:07] can you drink
[49:09] so we get a glimpse of the cup
[49:12] this cup what is it
[49:14] we get a glimpse of it in the garden of
[49:15] gethsemane when he was praying to the
[49:18] father matthew 26 39 and he went a
[49:20] little further and fell on his face and
[49:21] prayed saying oh my father
[49:25] if it be possible
[49:27] let this cup
[49:29] pass from me
[49:33] nevertheless
[49:34] not as i will
[49:36] but as i will
[49:38] and he said have a father all things are
[49:40] possible unto thee yes
[49:42] amen she said lord
[49:45] you can do anything
[49:48] it's your program
[49:52] all things are possible
[49:54] take away this cup from me
[50:09] when he was sweating it out the prophet
[50:11] said the anointing left him in the
[50:12] garden and he was sweating it out as a
[50:15] man going to calvary and he said your
[50:17] god you can do anything
[50:21] don't make me drink this
[50:24] but nevertheless
[50:26] nevertheless it's the only time what did
[50:29] he say i come to do the will of my
[50:31] father this is the only place you'll
[50:33] ever find jesus sweating out his own
[50:36] will
[50:40] he said nevertheless not what i will
[50:44] but let thy will be done
[50:48] amen
[50:49] what is in this cup
[50:51] what is in this cup that he would pray
[50:54] don't make me drink it
[50:57] the prophet of god said it is the cup
[51:00] of bitter
[51:01] persecutions
[51:06] amen as the old song said
[51:09] everybody wants to go to heaven but
[51:11] nobody wants to die
[51:13] in other words
[51:16] everybody just wants to cake walk in
[51:21] is a cup of bitter
[51:23] persecution
[51:25] the bible said he was a man of sorrows
[51:30] that word sorrows you know what it means
[51:31] pain
[51:33] physical pain
[51:35] mental
[51:36] pain
[51:37] a man of sorrow acquainted with grief
[51:41] you know what that word means
[51:42] sickness
[51:45] that's right he was acquainted
[51:47] with sickness
[51:49] the prophet that god said that he raised
[51:51] that winter woman's son from the dead
[51:54] and went over and sat on a rock and
[51:56] groaned with a headache
[52:00] that's right it's the truth
[52:02] i'm trying to paint your picture just
[52:04] stay with me for a second
[52:06] i'm trying to get you to see what he was
[52:11] a man of sorrow equated with grief
[52:14] he was called beelzebub
[52:16] a devil
[52:19] raised a widow woman sun from the dead
[52:21] and groaned on a sat on a rock groaning
[52:23] with a headache
[52:25] stop the storm that was started think
[52:27] about this he stopped a storm that was
[52:30] started with 10 000 devils
[52:34] and yet laid on the boat to rest
[52:36] from the meetings
[52:39] he wept at lazarus grave the death of
[52:43] his friend
[52:45] then he raised him from the dead
[52:47] amen that's right
[52:50] and he asked his disciples can you
[52:53] drink of this cup
[52:56] he was told he was the devil mocked made
[52:59] fun of rejected lied on persecuted
[53:04] and killed
[53:06] it is the cup the prophet said of
[53:08] persecution the cup of rejection by the
[53:11] world the cup of bitterness the cup of
[53:14] ridicule the cup of hatred the cup of
[53:17] death
[53:18] the prophet said sometimes the torture
[53:20] that that a sign has to go through is
[53:22] amazing the torture that jesus went
[53:25] through to prove the sign of god
[53:29] that he was the messiah think of that
[53:32] the torture that jesus went through to
[53:34] prove he was the messiah
[53:38] the torture to prove the sign the
[53:40] difficulties the ministry will face to
[53:43] prove the gift
[53:45] many people want fame
[53:47] but not pain
[53:51] many people want to be a great preacher
[53:53] but they don't want the training that it
[53:55] takes to be that
[53:59] the mooding
[54:00] of the character
[54:02] of a son of god
[54:05] you see if god gave us everything we'd
[54:07] just be a bunch of small children
[54:09] but our character is not motive by what
[54:11] god gives us
[54:13] but our character is mooted by the
[54:14] things that we suffer
[54:21] can you drink of this cup
[54:23] can you drink of this cup and he they
[54:25] said they said we can
[54:28] and jesus said
[54:30] ye shall
[54:31] indeed
[54:33] amen and indeed
[54:35] they did
[54:37] even to the point that paul said after
[54:39] the crucif after his conversion
[54:41] he said we've heard of my conversation
[54:43] in time past in the jews religion how
[54:46] that beyond measure i persecuted the
[54:48] church of god and wasted it
[54:52] they were thrown in jail as we looked at
[54:55] last night beaten persecuted rejected
[54:58] hated
[54:59] all drinking from the same cup
[55:02] he drank from

[58:04] james the son of zebedee was beheaded to
[58:07] jerusalem his guard was so moved by
[58:10] james's faith that he repented and
[58:13] declared his faith in christ and was
[58:15] beheaded
[58:16] with james
[58:23] but the man who's holding me as a
[58:25] prisoner was so moved by his testimony
[58:29] was so moved by his life
[58:32] that he repented himself and died with
[58:35] the one he was guarded
[58:40] oh god
[58:41] that's the real christian right there
[58:44] he just didn't talk to talk he lived it

[59:02] somebody asked one time you speak a
[59:03] foreign language i said yeah

[59:18] killed by arrows matthias was stoned
[59:22] and then beheaded
[59:25] all drinking
[59:27] from the same
[59:33] why did they kill them like that
[59:36] why did they persecute him
[59:38] because they saw jesus
[59:40] in them
[59:46] if i'm gonna be hated by the world
[59:48] let me be hated because they see jesus
[59:52] in my life
[59:54] the prophet said in the church book not
[59:55] only is the candlestick of gold it is a
[59:57] beaten goat handcrafted of beaten code
[59:59] according to her blueprints which are
[1:00:01] spirit given outside of her lord and
[1:00:02] master jesus christ was ever a people so
[1:00:05] beaten and purged as the bride of jesus
[1:00:06] christ surely she's filling up the
[1:00:08] sufferings that christ is left behind
[1:00:10] her goods are dispelled her life is in
[1:00:12] jeopardy she's accounted a chic for the
[1:00:14] slaughter she's killed all the day long
[1:00:16] and suffers much but in it all
[1:00:18] retaliates not neither does she cause
[1:00:20] others to suffer worthy of the gospel is
[1:00:23] this lovely bride of christ
[1:00:26] and as gold is malleable whereas brass
[1:00:28] will break with the beating this gold of
[1:00:30] god will bear her suffering for the lord
[1:00:32] not bound not broken not destroyed
[1:00:36] but formed as a thing of beauty and joy
[1:00:40] forever by the trials and testings
[1:00:44] of this life
[1:00:46] he shall
[1:00:47] indeed
[1:00:48] drink
[1:00:50] as we said last night many people think
[1:00:52] that christians that god loves us
[1:00:55] therefore we should never be sick that
[1:00:57] we should never have heartache or sorrow
[1:00:58] that we should we should we should never
[1:01:00] have to bury loved ones or battle
[1:01:02] pandemics we should never have mental
[1:01:03] pain physical pain every day should be
[1:01:06] blue skies
[1:01:07] but you see jesus never promised us that
[1:01:13] he just said can you drink
[1:01:15] of this cup
[1:01:20] he never said we wouldn't be persecuted
[1:01:22] mark laughed at hated ridiculed he never
[1:01:24] said we wouldn't get sick battle cancer
[1:01:27] but he did promise
[1:01:28] i'll never leave you
[1:01:30] nor will i forsake you
[1:01:33] amen
[1:01:34] amen
[1:01:36] many times we are led to that spot you
[1:01:38] say why is it if i go to church and i
[1:01:40] live with for god with all my heart and
[1:01:41] try to be a just and honest person all
[1:01:43] that christianity requires why is it
[1:01:45] that these things happen to me
[1:01:49] but you know many times they are
[1:01:50] blessings in disguisement
[1:01:53] many times we can't understand them
[1:01:56] but if you'll just let them alone
[1:01:58] god will work it out
[1:02:01] just
[1:02:02] right
[1:02:05] for the potter knows how to mold the
[1:02:08] clay
[1:02:13] amen you shall indeed drink
[1:02:16] of this cup
[1:02:17] that i drink
[1:02:21] amen
[1:02:23] some people tries to introduce
[1:02:24] christianity
[1:02:26] there's so much promises today made
[1:02:28] amongst christian people so many
[1:02:29] ministers promised people a false thing
[1:02:31] if you just come to christ all your
[1:02:32] troubles are settled i tell you when you
[1:02:35] come to christ that's when they begin
[1:02:39] why
[1:02:40] drinking from
[1:02:41] the cup
[1:02:44] now i said all that
[1:02:46] he said brother this is dedication
[1:02:47] service you've got us so depressed
[1:02:55] well you know sometimes you have to look
[1:02:57] at both sides of the coin
[1:02:58] and i'm fixing to flip the coin so hang
[1:03:00] on
[1:03:04] but why
[1:03:06] because they're drinking from this cup
[1:03:09] but i said all this to say this
[1:03:11] think about this for a moment all famous
[1:03:14] pictures
[1:03:15] before they can ever go into a hall of
[1:03:18] fame
[1:03:19] they first have to pass
[1:03:21] through the critics
[1:03:24] and the prophet said i like that because
[1:03:25] it's about like the church before the
[1:03:28] church can ever go into the great
[1:03:30] rapture
[1:03:32] it first has to come
[1:03:34] through the critics
[1:03:37] oh god are you listening to me
[1:03:40] look at where we're at
[1:03:41] look at what's happening around us look
[1:03:43] at all the things on the internet that's
[1:03:45] rising up against us look at all the
[1:03:48] critics
[1:03:50] who are posting all their commentaries
[1:03:52] come on somebody look at those around
[1:03:54] our ranks who has walked away friends
[1:03:56] that we used to eat with now are
[1:03:58] persecuting us
[1:04:00] but before we can ever go into the
[1:04:03] rapture we must go through the hall of
[1:04:05] critics could that be where we're at
[1:04:07] right now
[1:04:09] then how close are we from going home
[1:04:15] before the church can ever go into the
[1:04:17] great rapture it has to come through the
[1:04:19] critics all that live godly in christ
[1:04:21] jesus shall suffer persecution there is
[1:04:25] no excuses there's none that's the
[1:04:26] deferred i'll have to pass through the
[1:04:28] line of persecution and criticism but
[1:04:31] then if we pass through
[1:04:33] that with such a life that critics
[1:04:35] cannot point their finger to anything
[1:04:38] that's true
[1:04:39] then the pitcher is ready
[1:04:41] for the great hall
[1:04:43] of fame
[1:04:47] when all the critics get done with all
[1:04:49] their jabber and all their talk and all
[1:04:52] when they do all that they can do and
[1:04:54] the bride is still standing here and
[1:04:56] she's still presenting christ she's
[1:04:58] still come on somebody she's still so in
[1:05:01] love she's still reaching out with signs
[1:05:03] and wonders following the believer they
[1:05:05] will have to about the bible said every
[1:05:08] knee shall bow and every tongue shall
[1:05:10] confess that jesus christ is lord and
[1:05:13] the prophet of god said what's more this
[1:05:15] world will hear from god it will be
[1:05:18] through his bride
[1:05:25] before the church can ever be raptured
[1:05:28] and taken through the hall of fame it
[1:05:30] goes through the hall of critics
[1:05:33] all that live godly in christ jesus
[1:05:35] shall suffer persecution it must go
[1:05:38] through the criticism no criticism
[1:05:41] no
[1:05:42] glory
[1:05:50] have we not seen friends
[1:05:52] in just the last few years have we not
[1:05:53] seen an increase of critics from within
[1:05:57] and without many many of them that's
[1:05:59] right
[1:06:02] where
[1:06:07] listen to me
[1:06:08] god will never take a baby for his wife
[1:06:12] that's right
[1:06:14] if i told you i was getting married next
[1:06:15] week and you said who you marrying i
[1:06:17] said my my bride she's five-year-old
[1:06:19] you're gonna call it alone
[1:06:24] christ will never unite with a baby
[1:06:28] so what does the trials of testings of
[1:06:30] life what does it do it causes us to
[1:06:33] grow up
[1:06:35] through the tour
[1:06:36] to know what he wants done with the word
[1:06:39] and when we look hallelujah when we
[1:06:42] reproduce christ on the earth again
[1:06:44] he'll take us away
[1:06:51] remember if you follow christ you'll be
[1:06:53] hated by people for all that live godly
[1:06:55] in christ jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:06:58] and if you come to christ you'll not
[1:06:59] come by any church or any denomination
[1:07:02] or any creed
[1:07:04] not just by getting message books and
[1:07:06] wearing a message belt buckle and having
[1:07:08] a message picture on your wall
[1:07:11] there's only one way to come to christ
[1:07:13] and that is by the blood
[1:07:17] the blood is the only avenue amen
[1:07:21] it's too bad people come to a message
[1:07:22] search three times and we make them a
[1:07:24] message believer but let me tell you
[1:07:26] tonight saying to god if there's no
[1:07:27] repentance if there's no death of that
[1:07:29] old nature and you're not born again you
[1:07:31] have not arrived yet
[1:07:35] if christ is ever anchored in your soul
[1:07:37] you cannot walk away from the word he is
[1:07:40] the word
[1:07:44] brother why did this one walk away why
[1:07:46] did that one walk away because they
[1:07:48] never had a bird
[1:07:52] well that's all right man that's the
[1:07:53] truth
[1:07:57] how can you have the holy ghost and deny
[1:07:59] the very word that the holy ghost have
[1:08:01] vindicated
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:10] the gentile church
[1:08:12] the real truth church of god has exposed
[1:08:15] herself to public persecution
[1:08:18] by taking god in his word and saying i
[1:08:21] believe that divine healing and the
[1:08:23] power of the resurrection i believe that
[1:08:25] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:08:27] and forever with all these old cold
[1:08:30] formal morgues
[1:08:31] say the days of miracles has passed we
[1:08:33] expose ourself and lay at his feet
[1:08:37] when the apostles said they returned
[1:08:38] rejoicing because they're counted worthy
[1:08:40] they rather approach of his name how
[1:08:42] happy
[1:08:43] we ought to be
[1:08:46] 1900 years later to see the same holy
[1:08:50] ghost
[1:08:51] and the same kind of people
[1:08:54] causing the same results
[1:08:58] from the outside pointing a scornful
[1:09:01] finger like they did the first church so
[1:09:04] are they doing
[1:09:06] it's coming so fast like they did the
[1:09:08] alphabet now they're doing it to the
[1:09:10] omega bride
[1:09:12] the same finger the same finger
[1:09:14] of thumb for finger
[1:09:18] people on the outside hating and doing
[1:09:20] the same things they did to the first
[1:09:22] church but at the same time a people on
[1:09:25] the earth who has the same resurrected
[1:09:27] power of the lord jesus on the inside
[1:09:32] stretching forth his hand to do signs
[1:09:34] and wonders that he did at the beginning
[1:09:37] the same event taking place now a
[1:09:39] persecution of god's people like it was
[1:09:41] in the days of old why because god was
[1:09:44] in them and with them and today slates
[1:09:46] of god we are coming under the critics
[1:09:49] we are coming under the score for why
[1:09:51] the same god that was with them is with
[1:09:53] us doing the same thing confirming his
[1:09:56] word
[1:09:58] that's the church he wants a church not
[1:10:01] formal not a church of creeds not a
[1:10:03] church of dogmas not just a bunch of
[1:10:05] quotas but he's looking for believers
[1:10:12] not somebody that'll quote it
[1:10:14] somebody that'll live it
[1:10:18] a new church let's have a new commitment
[1:10:22] a re-dedication
[1:10:25] we are troubled on every side yet not
[1:10:27] distressed we're perplexed but not in
[1:10:30] despair we are persecuted
[1:10:33] but not forsaken we are cast down
[1:10:36] but not
[1:10:38] destroyed
[1:10:42] a woman once said to her lord lord grant
[1:10:45] unto you my two sons that one was set on
[1:10:46] the right hand and the other left into
[1:10:48] thy kingdom
[1:10:49] and he said can you drink the cup that i
[1:10:51] drink
[1:10:52] that's bitter persecution yes
[1:10:55] and he said
[1:10:56] you shall
[1:10:57] indeed
[1:10:59] drink
[1:11:00] and as we just proved it by the bible
[1:11:03] and by the message that his words
[1:11:06] were true
[1:11:07] amen
[1:11:10] for they surely indeed
[1:11:12] drank that cup
[1:11:14] of persecution
[1:11:17] why
[1:11:18] why did they drink that cup of
[1:11:19] persecution
[1:11:22] because they was baptized
[1:11:24] with the same baptism
[1:11:29] if it was true for them
[1:11:31] then it's true for us
[1:11:33] if the first part of that scripture is
[1:11:34] true
[1:11:36] then the rest of that passage
[1:11:38] is also true oh yeah that's right that's
[1:11:40] right
[1:11:41] for not only did he say
[1:11:45] just think if he had just said you shall
[1:11:47] indeed drink of this cup if he had just
[1:11:49] left it at that
[1:11:52] but there was a conjunction
[1:11:54] there was something else went with the
[1:11:56] passage
[1:11:57] he said you shall indeed drink of this
[1:12:00] cup
[1:12:01] and
[1:12:03] be baptized with the baptism
[1:12:06] that i am baptized with
[1:12:09] and if the first part of that was right
[1:12:11] about drinking the cup of bitter
[1:12:12] persecution then the rest of the passage
[1:12:14] of scripture is right that we as a
[1:12:16] people of god can receive the very life
[1:12:19] he had
[1:12:22] not another holy ghost come on somebody
[1:12:24] the same holy ghost
[1:12:28] for that calvary that day when he died
[1:12:30] he committed his spirit to god what
[1:12:32] happened on the day of pentecost god
[1:12:34] sent that life back down to the church
[1:12:42] think of it friends
[1:12:43] think of it
[1:12:45] a people so persecuted and hated a
[1:12:48] people who have sorrow and grief and
[1:12:49] sickness and death
[1:12:51] and the other people
[1:12:52] so anointed with the anointing of the
[1:12:55] messiah
[1:12:57] that they would be messianics
[1:13:01] did you catch the pictures
[1:13:15] that started by ten thousand devils
[1:13:18] a man who weapon at the screen's grave
[1:13:21] did raise him from the dead
[1:13:23] a man that raised a boy from the dead
[1:13:25] and then sat on a rock and groaned with
[1:13:26] a headache
[1:13:30] for what was he
[1:13:32] you see he was he was not just a man
[1:13:36] nor was he just a god
[1:13:38] but he was a unique blend he was a god
[1:13:45] it's going man get quite from now over
[1:13:46] there's all right
[1:13:50] but think of it look at the picture a
[1:13:52] man a god man walking the earth and yet
[1:13:55] he suffered bitter persecution to the
[1:13:58] point they killed him
[1:14:02] and yet god
[1:14:03] dwelled in him
[1:14:08] and then he says ye shall indeed drink
[1:14:11] this cup
[1:14:12] and be baptized just like i was baptized
[1:14:17] how many of the prophet god said he
[1:14:19] received the holy ghost on the river
[1:14:20] that day
[1:14:22] when you received the baptism of the
[1:14:24] holy ghost the prophet of god said
[1:14:26] you've got
[1:14:40] the same anointing
[1:14:42] the same
[1:14:43] life
[1:14:45] living in the flesh
[1:14:47] of his people
[1:14:50] a people so persecuted a people of
[1:14:52] sorrow a people of grief
[1:14:55] people who have sickness of people who
[1:14:57] bury loved ones and yet are people so
[1:14:59] anointed with the anointing of the
[1:15:01] messiah
[1:15:02] that they would be called
[1:15:04] messiahs
[1:15:06] the anointed ones
[1:15:07] of god
[1:15:23] thank you hallelujah
[1:15:25] [Applause]
[1:15:27] come into our position
[1:15:29] what are we coming to we are coming to
[1:15:31] what god thought of us but for the
[1:15:33] foundation of the world
[1:15:35] [Music]
[1:15:36] when god sees you he sees you the way he
[1:15:39] saw you before the foundation of the
[1:15:41] world
[1:15:45] hallelujah like ruth who laid down
[1:15:48] pulled the same cover over her not
[1:15:50] another cover the same cover like elisha
[1:15:53] when elijah was taken up
[1:15:56] got a double portion of elijah's spirit
[1:16:00] same mantle
[1:16:01] same anointing just more of it
[1:16:04] same skirt same robe same cup same
[1:16:06] baptism can you be baptized with the
[1:16:09] same baptizer i'm baptized with
[1:16:12] what is that baptism it is the holy

[1:19:18] how they knew your brother bannon never
[1:19:20] came to take the place of
[1:19:26] you know why i'm not a pastor
[1:19:28] i've had plenty of offers i say it
[1:19:29] humbly but i say it truthfully i've had
[1:19:31] plenty of offers for churches probably
[1:19:33] in my career of a minister if i could
[1:19:34] say it that way i'm ignorant i don't
[1:19:36] know fancy words i say the wrong word
[1:19:38] forgive me but what i'm trying to say is
[1:19:40] this in all my years of preaching i've
[1:19:42] had many offers
[1:19:44] you know why i've never took a church
[1:19:47] there's a brother told me one time that
[1:19:48] god told him i was to be the pastor of a
[1:19:50] church
[1:19:51] i sought god for three years because i
[1:19:53] wanted to be right
[1:19:56] and one day out in kentucky in a tree
[1:19:57] stand deer hunting when i was actually
[1:19:59] praying
[1:20:00] and i said god if you want me to take
[1:20:02] that church that brother said that you
[1:20:04] told him i was to take that church i
[1:20:06] said god if you're able to tell that man
[1:20:08] and i'm the one that's supposed to do it
[1:20:09] you're certainly able to tell me and i
[1:20:11] said lord if you want me to take that
[1:20:13] church if you'll speak to me
[1:20:16] i'll do what you tell me to do
[1:20:18] god is my witness sitting there in that
[1:20:20] tree stand a warm feeling come over me
[1:20:22] and avoid what otherwise i've never
[1:20:23] heard the honorable voice of god but a
[1:20:25] voice spoke just as real as i'm speaking
[1:20:27] to you
[1:20:28] told me he said stay on the field as an
[1:20:30] evangelist and by this you'll know that
[1:20:32] you're this is what you're to do he gave
[1:20:34] me two brothers names and said you'll
[1:20:36] preach for both of these brothers and by
[1:20:38] this you'll know that you're to stay on
[1:20:40] the field i come out of the woods a man
[1:20:42] by the name of billy laster he's go to
[1:20:43] glory now billy killed a big cow down
[1:20:45] here in kentucky and invited all these
[1:20:47] believers in for a big steak dinner man
[1:20:49] it was good too and i came out of the
[1:20:51] woods took a shower and went over to
[1:20:52] that steak dinner and god is my witness
[1:20:54] both of those brothers were there and
[1:20:56] both of those brothers that night asked
[1:20:58] me to come and preach for them i'll go
[1:21:00] back up
[1:21:04] i go back up to where where the brother
[1:21:06] said that and i took a message the sons
[1:21:07] of god are led by the spirit of god and
[1:21:09] i told him i cannot take the church
[1:21:11] because he told me to stay on the field
[1:21:12] as an evangelist i can't take the place
[1:21:15] of a pastor i'm not a pastor but brother
[1:21:17] brennan cannot take my place
[1:21:20] there's a five-fold ministry
[1:21:24] he never ordained the pushing to play to
[1:21:26] take the place of the fivefold ministry
[1:21:28] i don't care friends you get mad at me

[1:21:31] you the god's truth

[1:29:05] and it will never stop
[1:29:07] us
[1:29:09] they tried their best to kill john but
[1:29:10] they never could kill him and they will
[1:29:12] never stop this bride she has drank of
[1:29:14] the cup and has been baptized with the
[1:29:16] baptism he was baptized with
[1:29:19] now friends this can't be talking about
[1:29:20] the baptism he received of john
[1:29:22] if that was true we would all have to go
[1:29:24] to jordan and be baptized in the river
[1:29:25] that's right so he's not talking about
[1:29:27] that baptism when john baptized he's
[1:29:29] talking about another
[1:29:31] baptism
[1:29:35] but what did john say i baptize you with
[1:29:37] water under repentance but he that
[1:29:39] cometh after me is mightier than i whose
[1:29:41] shoes i'm not worthy to bear and he
[1:29:43] shall baptize you
[1:29:45] with the holy ghost and with fire
[1:29:50] you
[1:29:57] that's right i'm sorry that's the god's
[1:29:59] truth that's the truth
[1:30:00] i had some frail britches i was out
[1:30:02] burning the brush file and i was kicking
[1:30:04] up the brush in there to burn it and i
[1:30:06] was sitting there and all of a sudden i
[1:30:07] thought man my legs awful hot
[1:30:09] the other day i said jimmy cricket i'm
[1:30:11] on fire
[1:30:12] my passion was burning right up to i was
[1:30:14] two seconds away from ripping my
[1:30:16] britches right off in the neighborhood
[1:30:18] wow you said brother why i was on fire
[1:30:23] can you imagine the man who furnishing
[1:30:25] well look
[1:30:29] i'm burning
[1:30:32] golly
[1:30:39] no when you're on fire the neighbors
[1:30:42] knows it the fire department knows it
[1:30:44] everybody knows it and let me tell you
[1:30:46] this church amen let's get on fire from
[1:30:49] god let fit michigan know there's a god
[1:30:52] who answers the prayers of his people
[1:30:57] amen
[1:31:01] the clearest example i know of the
[1:31:03] meaning of the baptism
[1:31:04] is a text from the greek point by the
[1:31:06] physician nasander who lived in 200 bc
[1:31:09] it's a recipe for making pickles
[1:31:12] it's helpful because it uses both words
[1:31:15] now watch this neander says that in
[1:31:17] order to make a pickle the vegetable
[1:31:19] should be first dipped
[1:31:21] bapto
[1:31:22] into boiling water
[1:31:24] and then baptized baptizo
[1:31:32] in the vinegar solution
[1:31:35] both verbs concerning the immersion of
[1:31:37] vegetables
[1:31:38] in a solution but the first is
[1:31:41] temporarily
[1:31:43] the second is the act of baptism the
[1:31:45] baptizing the vegetable produces a
[1:31:48] permanent
[1:31:49] change
[1:31:50] and john said you're not just going to
[1:31:52] be dipped in water you are going to be
[1:31:54] pickled
[1:32:08] it's going to take a prostitute and make
[1:32:09] her a godly woman
[1:32:12] or the baptism of the holy ghost that he
[1:32:15] said i don't care what you've done you
[1:32:17] can't be baptized if you'll follow the
[1:32:19] formula
[1:32:24] hallelujah
[1:32:26] what is this baptism it is a new birth
[1:32:29] it is a regeneration it is a new
[1:32:32] creature
[1:32:33] he is standing in the midst of the
[1:32:35] church and he stands out revealing who
[1:32:37] he is
[1:32:38] in this last age he calls himself the
[1:32:41] author
[1:32:42] of the creation
[1:32:44] of god
[1:32:46] can i have just a few more minutes
[1:32:48] this to me
[1:32:50] is the church
[1:32:51] he wants
[1:32:53] this is what he wants us to be
[1:32:56] not just come to a message church not
[1:32:58] just those pictures are wonderful thank
[1:33:00] god i'm glad we understand what those
[1:33:01] pictures are but we have all this and
[1:33:04] not have healed we're nothing but a
[1:33:06] lodge
[1:33:07] are you here
[1:33:08] we're nothing but a lodge because they
[1:33:09] meet together they have pictures on the
[1:33:11] wall and everything else so we've got to
[1:33:12] be something besides a lodge god's not
[1:33:15] looking for a lodge but he is looking
[1:33:17] for a bride
[1:33:20] he's the author he's the author of
[1:33:22] creation of god
[1:33:24] this is another creation
[1:33:26] this is another creation
[1:33:29] this has to do with the church
[1:33:32] this is a special listen to this this is
[1:33:35] a special designation of himself
[1:33:39] so what does the church want
[1:33:41] what does he want his church to be he
[1:33:43] wants his church
[1:33:45] to be him yeah that's right
[1:33:49] bone of his bone flesh of his flesh
[1:33:51] spirit of his spirit the prophet said
[1:33:53] she is
[1:33:54] him
[1:33:57] hallelujah
[1:33:59] the author amen the author of creation
[1:34:02] of god this is another creation this has
[1:34:04] to do with the church this is a special
[1:34:08] designation of himself he is the creator
[1:34:12] of that church
[1:34:13] the heavenly bridegroom created his own
[1:34:18] bride
[1:34:21] as the spirit of god he came down
[1:34:23] as the spirit of god he came down and
[1:34:25] created in the virgin mary the cells
[1:34:29] from which his body was born mary was
[1:34:32] just the incubator
[1:34:35] god created the cells in that womb that
[1:34:38] produced that body
[1:34:41] i want to repeat that he said he created
[1:34:43] the very cells in the womb of mary for
[1:34:46] that body god not mary provided that
[1:34:50] body
[1:34:51] for he said in his word a body has thou
[1:34:55] prepared
[1:34:56] me
[1:34:58] mary was the human incubator and she
[1:35:01] carried the holy child and brought him
[1:35:03] to birth and he was a god
[1:35:06] man
[1:35:08] he was the son of god he was of the new
[1:35:12] creation man and god met and joined
[1:35:18] he was the first
[1:35:20] of a new race
[1:35:23] and he is the hand
[1:35:25] of this new
[1:35:27] race
[1:35:37] what
[1:35:38] did the spirit of god produce in the
[1:35:41] womb of mary
[1:35:42] it produced
[1:35:44] a god man
[1:35:46] that's right
[1:35:48] well let me just in case you don't
[1:35:50] the prophet god said when he slept in
[1:35:52] that boat that night because he was
[1:35:53] tired he was a man but when he put his
[1:35:55] book on the bow that boat and said peace
[1:35:57] be still that was more than the man that
[1:35:59] was god
[1:36:00] said when he wept at lazar's grave he
[1:36:01] was a man but when he threw those
[1:36:03] shoulders back and said lazarus come
[1:36:04] forth that was lower than a man that was
[1:36:07] god
[1:36:09] so what did he produce in the womb of
[1:36:11] mary a new creation a new race
[1:36:17] and god wants kind to bring forth time
[1:36:20] that's according to the book of genesis
[1:36:23] then if christ is to take a bride what
[1:36:25] kind of bride will he take somebody
[1:36:27] that's just like you
[1:36:31] how can they be like him they are
[1:36:34] baptized into a new creation
[1:36:43] what did the spirit of god produce in
[1:36:44] the womb of mary a god man what will the
[1:36:47] spirit of god produce in the womb of the
[1:36:49] church
[1:36:50] a god man
[1:36:53] he's the head of the body the church who
[1:36:55] is the beginning the firstborn from the
[1:36:56] dead that in all things he might have
[1:36:58] the preeminence therefore if any man be
[1:37:00] in christ he is a new creation old
[1:37:02] things have passed away behold all
[1:37:04] things have become new therefore you can
[1:37:06] see that no man was of the old order or
[1:37:08] the creation now listen to this i'm
[1:37:10] coming to a close now in union with
[1:37:12] christ
[1:37:13] he has become the new creation of god
[1:37:20] man
[1:37:21] though he was born of the old order or
[1:37:23] the old creation now in a union with
[1:37:26] christ he has become the new creation of
[1:37:29] god
[1:37:30] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:37:32] union with christ jesus under good works
[1:37:34] ephesians 2 10 ephesians 4 24 and now
[1:37:37] that you put on the new man which actor
[1:37:39] god is created in righteousness and true
[1:37:42] holiness
[1:37:44] this new creation is not a no creation
[1:37:45] made over or not because it couldn't be
[1:37:47] called a new creation this is exactly
[1:37:49] what it says it is it's not a no
[1:37:51] creation made whole it's a new creation
[1:37:54] the old man dies amen
[1:37:57] this is another creation distinct from
[1:37:59] the old one
[1:38:00] but now out of every kinder tribe nation
[1:38:03] he has produced a new creation he is the
[1:38:06] first of that creation he was god

[1:38:10] his spirit he has created many sons of

[1:41:55] what kind of church does he want
[1:41:57] he wants himself
[1:41:59] in action
[1:42:01] do you love him
[1:42:02] do you know the prophet god said the
[1:42:04] moon is the wife of the son
[1:42:08] and you know the prophet of god said the
[1:42:09] moon has no light of its own
[1:42:12] it only lives off the light of the sun
[1:42:15] it doesn't have its own light it's only
[1:42:18] reflecting
[1:42:19] the sun's
[1:42:20] light
[1:42:23] do you know a rainbow you've seen a
[1:42:24] rainbow in the sky
[1:42:26] a rainbow in the sky is caused by water
[1:42:28] droplets in the air and the light of the
[1:42:30] sun passing through the droplets splits
[1:42:32] the light into seven colors and makes a
[1:42:34] seven colored rainbow
[1:42:36] and we know that rainbow is a covenant
[1:42:38] that god made is that right the rainbow
[1:42:40] is the top of the covenant
[1:42:41] do you know that in this end time in the
[1:42:44] life magazine article of the cloud
[1:42:46] anybody anybody ever seen the life
[1:42:48] magazine cloud
[1:42:49] on one page it says a mile high mystery
[1:42:52] cloud and it's the picture of the cloud
[1:42:54] and it says and dot dot dot and and you
[1:42:58] turn the page over how many knows what's
[1:42:59] on the other page
[1:43:01] it's a rainbow how many knows where that
[1:43:03] rainbow was at it was in hawaii
[1:43:05] honeymoon capital of the world

[1:43:14] night to call in the 11th hour worker
[1:43:17] what was it showing us that we have a
[1:43:19] covenant with god we are god's covenant
[1:43:22] people
[1:43:28] knows there's a thing called a moonbow
[1:43:30] you know what a moonbow is a mumbo is
[1:43:32] the same thing as a rainbow except the
[1:43:34] rainbow is caused by the sun but a
[1:43:36] moonbow is caused
[1:43:38] by the light of the moon
[1:43:41] and it takes certain kind of conditions
[1:43:43] to produce the moonbow it takes so much
[1:43:45] darkness so much moisture and so much
[1:43:48] light
[1:43:49] so the only age that could ever been a
[1:43:50] moonbow
[1:43:51] is the last stage in the darkness of
[1:43:53] laodicea the light returns
[1:43:57] with the water of the word and produces
[1:43:59] a moonbow showing that god has made a
