[39:41] thankful for your prayers and support as
[39:43] a church you've been tremendously
[39:45] supportive of elizabeth and i
[39:47] and i believe it's not just because
[39:48] we're related uh to your pastor but it's
[39:51] just a real kinship with you and i know
[39:54] even my wife served in the beginning at
[39:56] this church uh and
[39:58] um and was just real instrumental in
[40:00] supporting her her pastor and her father
[40:02] and then you guys in turn have just been
[40:04] super supportive of her and our family
[40:06] and for us and so as a church um as a
[40:08] person and us as a church you've been
[40:10] very supportive to us in phoenix and uh
[40:13] we're grateful for that and brother john
[40:14] you've been a real a real friend and a
[40:16] real support to us and we're grateful
[40:18] for all that you've done and we're
[40:19] rejoicing in the goodness of god in what
[40:21] lord's done here
[40:22] um
[40:23] it's uh
[40:24] yesterday at the youth meeting we had
[40:25] young people sitting here young people
[40:27] sitting there and young people sitting
[40:28] here and for the f really for the first
[40:31] time ever i can kind of
[40:33] do this while i'm preaching it's in the
[40:35] light it used to just be like the
[40:36] shotgun
[40:38] you know and there's more i mentioned it
[40:40] wednesday i said there's so many cars in
[40:42] the parking lot that weren't for sale
[40:45] and it just is so awesome to see what
[40:46] god has done and god grow the body and
[40:48] not just in numbers but in um in service
[40:51] identifying gifts people supporting and
[40:53] stepping up and there could be a lot of
[40:55] newness to a building you get a new
[40:57] building a lot of people get motivated
[40:58] to help and do things and what you do is
[41:00] you forget
[41:01] that drive and enthusiasm and things
[41:03] kind of start slipping and then it gets
[41:04] right back to where
[41:06] 20 of the people are doing 100 of the
[41:08] work or 80 of the work however that
[41:10] works out whatever the math is
[41:12] uh but
[41:13] uh i'll just share this i don't know why
[41:14] i'm going down this path nobody's
[41:16] offered to pay me if you do um certainly
[41:18] open to that bro john but
[41:20] um when i i've learned this that there's
[41:23] times that god puts a burden on
[41:24] someone's heart and when that happens
[41:26] you've got to do it you absolutely have
[41:28] to do it that's a burden that
[41:30] everyone must bear their own burden
[41:31] that's laid upon you and you've got to
[41:32] do it and some of you felt that and you
[41:34] step in and do it but then it says that
[41:36] bear you one another's burdens and those
[41:38] are burdens you have to take on and so
[41:39] you may not have a burden to do
[41:41] something here at the church but if you
[41:42] see something that needs to be done take
[41:44] it on take that burden on and stay
[41:46] faithful with it labor in it because
[41:49] it's
[41:50] you can't even begin to describe just
[41:52] how much god will bless you when you
[41:53] serve other people it's the only source
[41:55] of true happiness and it's the only it's
[41:57] the only true eternal life is when you
[41:59] live for others and so we're rejoicing
[42:01] with what god has done here the
[42:03] beautiful building the beautiful
[42:04] congregation just the new converts the
[42:05] new families it's just wonderful very
[42:08] very wonderful
[42:10] to see everything and we're grateful
[42:12] personally for the martin family for
[42:13] sister cheryl and brother john we
[42:14] consider a mom and dad
[42:16] and i love their testimony and example
[42:19] and i'm very
[42:20] very
[42:21] happy to be here
[42:22] and then also i guess to say that um
[42:25] we had a celebrated anniversary this
[42:27] past week 21 years ago we ministered for
[42:29] the first time at this church and to see
[42:31] it continue it's just been a real honor
[42:33] and privilege to be able to minister
[42:34] here for so long and we said god bless
[42:36] you to you
[42:37] sister johnson happy 96th birthday
[42:39] that's wonderful what an honor to be
[42:41] able to honor one of god's servants
[42:44] nice to be here for that and then
[42:46] brother joshua i think you drove the
[42:48] furthest today to be in service or drove
[42:49] up from new albany indiana last night
[42:51] just to be in service today with joshua
[42:53] and his wife and children
[42:55] god bless
[42:56] you hopefully after service we'll have a
[42:59] chance to shake your hand but may the
[43:00] lord bless them
[43:02] genesis chapter 22.
[43:05] i'm going to read verses 1 to 14.
[43:07] i have a whole bunch that i want to
[43:10] minister on and i figure i got to make
[43:11] it worth it for brother joshua when you
[43:13] drive five and a half hours you don't
[43:14] want to preach a sermonette
[43:16] for somebody who's that hungry for the
[43:17] word
[43:18] and so genesis chapter 22 verses 1 to 14
[43:22] and it came to pass after these things
[43:24] that god did tempt abraham and said unto
[43:26] him abraham and he said behold here i
[43:28] am.
[43:29] and he said take now thy son thy only
[43:31] son isaac whom thou lovest and get the
[43:34] end of the land of moriah and offer him
[43:35] there for a burnt offering
[43:37] upon one of the mountains which i will
[43:39] tell thee of now doesn't that sound like
[43:41] when he first called him
[43:43] going to a place that i'm not going to
[43:44] tell you now but i'll tell you later
[43:46] he's doing the same thing now in genesis
[43:48] chapter 22 and later on in his life so
[43:50] many years later he's saying i want you
[43:52] to go
[43:53] and i'll tell you later which mountain
[43:54] you're going to and abraham rose up
[43:56] early in the morning and saddled his ass
[43:57] and took two of his young men with him
[43:59] and isaac his son enclaved the wood for
[44:01] the burnt offering and rose up and went
[44:03] under the place which god had told him
[44:06] then on the third day abraham lifted up
[44:08] his eyes and saw the place afar off
[44:10] and abraham said unto his young men
[44:12] abide ye here with the ass and i and the
[44:14] lad will go yonder and worship and come
[44:16] again to you
[44:18] abraham took the wood of the burnt
[44:19] offering and laid it upon isaac his son
[44:20] and he took the fire in his hand and a
[44:22] knife and they went both of them
[44:24] together
[44:25] and isaac spake unto abraham his father
[44:27] and said my father and he said here i am
[44:29] my son and he said behold the fire and
[44:31] the wood but where's the lamb for a
[44:33] burnt offering
[44:34] and abraham said my son god will provide
[44:36] himself a lamb for a burnt offering so
[44:39] they both they went both of them
[44:41] together
[44:42] and they came to the place which god had
[44:43] told them of and abraham built an altar
[44:45] there
[44:46] laid the wood in order and bound isaac
[44:47] his son and laid him on the altar upon
[44:49] the wood and abraham stretched forth his
[44:51] hand and took the knife to slay his son
[44:54] and the angel lord called unto him out
[44:55] of the heaven and said abraham abraham
[44:57] and he said here am i
[44:59] and he said lay not thine hand upon the
[45:01] lad neither do anything unto him for now
[45:04] i know that thou fierst god seen thou
[45:06] has not withheld thy son thine only son
[45:08] from me and abraham lifted up his eyes
[45:11] and looked and behold behind him a ram
[45:13] caught in a thicket by his horns and
[45:16] abraham went and took the ram and
[45:17] offered him up a burnt offering instead
[45:19] of his son and abraham called the name
[45:22] of that that place jehovah jireh as it
[45:24] is said to this day in the mount of the
[45:26] lord it shall
[45:28] be seen that's what jehovah jairu means
[45:30] the god who sees
[45:32] amen let's pray heavenly father as we've
[45:34] read this story it's just moving
[45:37] knowing that this is real it's not an
[45:39] allegory it's not a mythology it's not a
[45:42] fairy tale it's real
[45:44] and lord what an extraordinary event on
[45:46] mount moriah that abraham would take his
[45:49] son isaac and offer him up as a
[45:50] sacrifice
[45:52] and there you lord said i see jehovah
[45:55] jireh the god who sees
[45:57] and you saw his faith
[45:59] and you held that hand and you provided
[46:02] a sacrifice
[46:04] lord i pray today as we speak on the
[46:06] supreme faith
[46:08] of abraham and our own supreme faith i
[46:10] pray that you'd be present with us to
[46:11] guide us through these scriptures and
[46:13] these quotations
[46:14] that your people would be supremely
[46:16] blessed
[46:17] we commit this to you in the name lord
[46:18] jesus christ amen
[46:20] and then you can be seated
[46:23] i have a whole bunch i want to get
[46:25] through we trust by god's grace we'll be
[46:27] able to do it i told brother john if i
[46:28] don't finish i'll cut my vacation short
[46:30] and come back wednesday night uh so lord
[46:32] willing i'll finish
[46:34] but wednesday and i don't really have
[46:36] much time to kind of recapture where we
[46:38] were wednesday and i'm so grateful for
[46:39] that opportunity to kind of lay a lot of
[46:41] the foundational points on abraham and
[46:42] how he initially started out falling
[46:45] following god just by that command not
[46:48] knowing where he was going to go
[46:49] and we're wanting to take the example of
[46:52] abraham to show that even our own
[46:54] supreme faith will come
[46:56] by daily acts of faith bill abraham said
[46:59] that the rapture will be the same way
[47:00] just those acts of faith of starting
[47:02] your car and going to meet somebody for
[47:04] lunch that just that regular routine of
[47:06] following the scriptures and the plans
[47:08] of god is what's going to build our
[47:10] faith to rapturing faith and i've
[47:13] and i've that's quote has been so uh
[47:16] personal to me and so real to me for so
[47:18] the last couple years
[47:20] that uh it's becoming more and more of a
[47:22] reality that we're not i'm not looking
[47:24] for a great convention i'm not looking
[47:26] for a great convention speaker i believe
[47:28] the message has been delivered to us in
[47:30] its completeness and its fullness and
[47:32] it's a matter of just feeding on that
[47:33] word of god and living that word of god
[47:35] in its simplicity and that's what's
[47:37] going to bring forth this rapturing
[47:39] faith for the bride and then as we
[47:41] believe then the signs and wonders
[47:42] follow the believers and there's all
[47:44] sorts of manifestations and gifts that
[47:46] god has placed within the body of christ
[47:48] to encourage our faith and grow our
[47:50] faith but we know that in the end it's
[47:52] going to be that only believe in the
[47:54] word of god that's going to produce that
[47:56] rapturing faith
[47:58] and we've chosen abraham and we're not
[48:00] going to be able to do anything
[48:01] exhaustive on his life but abraham is a
[48:04] legend when it comes to faith he's the
[48:06] father of faith father of over 4 billion
[48:08] believers in the world today whether it
[48:10] be muslims or jews or christians they
[48:13] look to abraham as the father of their
[48:15] faith their conviction and their belief
[48:17] and i believe that as you examine
[48:19] abraham's life he's much more relatable
[48:21] than we might think he is and so
[48:23] hopefully today just at different points
[48:25] if god could quicken it uh just identify
[48:27] just how relatable his faith is to our
[48:29] own faith
[48:31] and as we were touching on wednesday we
[48:33] might not have done as good a job as we
[48:34] hoped to that abraham believed in a god
[48:37] that was personally revealed to him
[48:40] it wasn't taken his dad's word or his
[48:42] brothers or his nephews he wasn't taking
[48:44] the word of anybody else in babylon
[48:47] because nobody else knew this god it was
[48:49] the one god that he revealed himself to
[48:51] abraham and because god revealed himself
[48:53] to abraham and then isaac and jacob he
[48:55] became known as the god of abraham isaac
[48:58] and jacob because he singularly had
[49:00] revealed himself to abraham and to isaac
[49:03] and to jacob and so that was that was
[49:05] the simple pure faith of abraham is to
[49:08] believe the god that made himself known
[49:10] to them
[49:11] and the statement that brother bannon
[49:13] makes in the masterpiece as he started
[49:14] in abraham after the fall of the first
[49:17] masterpiece he started in abraham on a
[49:19] foundation to build another masterpiece
[49:22] so after mankind fell in genesis 3 15
[49:25] god prophesies of the seed that will
[49:27] come and crush the serpent's head and
[49:29] that's a prophecy of christ and god does
[49:32] not begin to build that back until
[49:35] genesis chapter 12 and the lord said
[49:37] unto abraham said unto abram and when
[49:40] god called abram that's when god began
[49:42] to build another masterpiece so abraham
[49:45] is the foundation of jesus christ he's
[49:48] the foundation of this another
[49:50] masterpiece christ is the capstone to
[49:53] that foundation the capstone to that
[49:56] masterpiece the capstone to the jewish
[49:58] church ages and so brother brown
[50:00] recognizes abraham as that foundation so
[50:02] that's going to determine the extent of
[50:03] it this is this is the foundation of
[50:06] this masterpiece christ comes as the
[50:08] culmination of it and then brother adam
[50:10] said there's another masterpiece in the
[50:12] making
[50:13] so there's going to be another
[50:14] culmination there's another masterpiece
[50:16] to come forth and that is who the bride
[50:18] is she is the capstone to the church
[50:20] ages uh in her union with jesus christ
[50:22] and so we are then
[50:24] following in that same pattern as god
[50:26] built up from abraham to christ we're
[50:28] following in the same pattern
[50:30] now we've read genesis chapter 22 in
[50:33] james chapter 2 verses 21 and 22
[50:36] james writes this about these very works
[50:38] of abraham he says was not abraham our
[50:40] father justified by works when he had
[50:42] offered isaac his son upon the altar
[50:45] brother braham takes this and looks at
[50:46] it in such a simple view and paul says
[50:48] you're justified by faith he said that's
[50:50] what god sees that's all god needs to
[50:52] see is your faith to know that you
[50:54] believe but then he says that the works
[50:56] of abraham when james said that his
[50:57] works justified him that was what was
[50:59] manifest in what was visible for others
[51:02] to see
[51:03] and so was not abraham our father
[51:04] justified by works
[51:06] when you'd offered isaac his son upon
[51:08] the altar
[51:09] and he asked a question but he's
[51:11] basically saying it was
[51:12] it's called the rhetorical question
[51:14] where the answer is assumed
[51:16] see is thou how faith wrought with his
[51:18] works and by works
[51:20] was faith
[51:21] made perfect
[51:23] by his works his faith was made perfect
[51:25] it reached fully consummated development
[51:27] it couldn't go any further it attained
[51:29] the very word there faith made perfect
[51:31] it's the supreme expression of his faith
[51:34] he had attained to it he had manifested
[51:36] he'd reached that pinnacle and that
[51:38] climax of his faith and so faith was
[51:40] made perfect through that act it was
[51:42] demonstrated and manifested on that
[51:44] mount moriah that this was perfect faith
[51:47] this was supreme faith on that mountain
[51:51] and so i'm asking the question what is
[51:53] it about this act
[51:55] that justified abraham's faith
[51:58] what is it on mount moriah when he took
[52:00] his son and was offering up as a
[52:02] sacrifice that demonstrated perfect
[52:04] faith how is this act supreme faith
[52:08] and when brother branham makes this
[52:09] statement and god is identified by his
[52:11] characteristics he says one day god saw
[52:14] or one day when god had seen his servant
[52:16] was determined to be an example for
[52:18] people of today
[52:20] so he had set him forth god had
[52:22] determined and set him forth to be an
[52:24] example for the people today and when he
[52:26] saw that abraham's determination had
[52:28] matched god's determination when he had
[52:30] seen that he puts them in this calls
[52:33] them to this place to demonstrate on
[52:34] mount moriah supreme faith
[52:38] and so what expresses as he says he was
[52:40] to be an example for people today what
[52:43] expresses the example of faith for the
[52:45] bride in the last days how is this
[52:48] and
[52:48] i'm wanting you just to
[52:50] think about this how does this embody
[52:52] brought the bride's faith
[52:54] and i'll say this at the outset that
[52:57] what abraham went through in his life
[52:58] was a process of faith coming to perfect
[53:01] faith
[53:03] and he didn't fully recognize that faith
[53:05] or realize that faith on day one
[53:08] could you imagine if there in her in um
[53:11] in ur of the chaldees he woke up one
[53:13] morning and a voice said to him i want
[53:15] you to go take your nephew lot and kill
[53:17] him
[53:18] or if you had a son god speaks to him
[53:20] says it says i want you go ahead and
[53:22] take your son over there and crucify him
[53:24] and
[53:25] and slaughter him on the rocks he'd be
[53:27] considered a murderer a madman listening
[53:29] to voices a psychopath he'd have no
[53:31] basis to believe he had no reason this
[53:33] would be no other than just some other
[53:35] premonition or idea coming to his head
[53:36] but that's not how god dealt with
[53:38] abraham he didn't knock on his tent door
[53:40] and say hey i want you to kill your son
[53:42] your only son he's like hey i don't have
[53:43] a son well then let me give you one so
[53:45] you can kill him that's not how god
[53:46] dealt with abraham
[53:49] but god was faithful to reveal himself
[53:51] to abraham
[53:52] constantly
[53:53] until supreme faith was realized he
[53:56] started with him on a particular basis
[53:58] and was the genesis the author of
[54:00] abraham's faith he's what cultivated and
[54:02] brought it up and abraham began to
[54:04] believe in something beyond himself
[54:05] something that nobody else believed
[54:08] and he believed it and he filed it
[54:09] despite whatever the stigma might have
[54:11] been and abraham's life is such an
[54:13] incredible testimony to the true god
[54:17] and so it's a it was something that god
[54:19] was faithful to do
[54:21] now
[54:22] i want to begin in genesis chapter 17
[54:26] to
[54:26] look at one of these examples of when
[54:28] god revealed himself to abraham verses
[54:30] three to eight
[54:32] and how that god is appearing to abraham
[54:35] to build give him what he needs to come
[54:38] to the supreme faith and it says in
[54:40] verse 3 of genesis 17 and abram fell on
[54:43] his faith and i referred to him as
[54:45] abraham we know his name was changed
[54:48] from abram to abraham and so now having
[54:50] that name change we just refer to him as
[54:52] abraham hope that doesn't stumble
[54:54] anybody but and abram fell on his faith
[54:56] and god talked with him saying as for me
[54:58] behold my covenant is with thee
[55:02] and thou shalt be a father of many
[55:03] nations and this would echo the
[55:05] sentiments that god had already
[55:06] expressed to him i'd make your name
[55:08] great and you shall be the father
[55:10] of nations and and all families of the
[55:13] earth will be blessed and so
[55:15] he said i'll make of you a great nation
[55:16] so this is echoing in these things he
[55:18] says i'll make thou shall be a father of
[55:20] many nations neither shall thy name any
[55:22] more be called abram but thy name shall
[55:24] be called abraham so it's going from
[55:26] father to father of many for father many
[55:29] nations have i made thee
[55:31] and i will make the exceeding fruitful
[55:34] remember our introduction to sarah in
[55:35] genesis 11.
[55:36] she was barren and they had no children
[55:38] so he's telling him something that seems
[55:40] to be impossible or at least had not yet
[55:42] manifested itself through these many
[55:44] years i'll make you exceeding fruitful
[55:45] and i'll make nations of thee and kings
[55:48] shall come out of thee and i will
[55:50] establish my covenant between me and
[55:52] thee and thy seed after thee and notice
[55:54] this in their generations for an
[55:57] everlasting covenant
[55:59] to be a god unto thee and thy seed after
[56:02] thee and i'll give unto thee
[56:05] and thy seed after thee the land we're
[56:07] in thou art a stranger all the land of
[56:09] canaan for an everlasting possession and
[56:12] i will be their god
[56:13] notice the language that god is using to
[56:15] abraham everlasting covenant everlasting
[56:17] possession this is ever enduring this is
[56:20] eternal and i will be a god to you
[56:22] forever
[56:24] genesis chapter 13 verse 15. for the
[56:26] land which thou seest to give
[56:28] to to thee will i give it and to thy
[56:30] seed forever
[56:32] it'll eternally stand as your possession
[56:35] now think about what god is telling
[56:37] abraham abraham i will be your god
[56:40] forever
[56:41] your seed after you will possess this
[56:43] land forever this is an eternal covenant
[56:46] this is an everlasting possession he's
[56:48] talking to him in a language ever
[56:50] enduring eternal persisting perpetual in
[56:53] perpetuity this is going to be yours
[56:56] and genesis chapter 21 verse 33 and
[56:58] abraham planted a grove in beersheba and
[57:01] called there on the name of the lord the
[57:03] everlasting god
[57:05] he said i will be a god unto thee
[57:07] forever
[57:08] i'm going to be an eternal god in this
[57:10] genesis chapter 21 i just recently did a
[57:14] series of sermons at our home church on
[57:16] our family tree and this scripture was
[57:19] uh the the inspiration for that because
[57:21] abraham planted an oasis
[57:23] he planted a grove and it wasn't that he
[57:25] just planted a tree but he planted
[57:28] something that was pre implanting it
[57:30] he's being proactive because you plant a
[57:32] tree that grows so that in the future
[57:34] can provide fruit or shade
[57:36] and so it wasn't a selfish act and when
[57:38] it says that he planted this grove it
[57:41] was a place of worship and there he
[57:43] invoked the name of the everlasting god
[57:46] and in to the hebrew it was a place of
[57:48] hospitality so that strangers would pass
[57:51] by and people would travel they would
[57:53] see this grove they'd see this oasis and
[57:56] abraham would invite them in and he
[57:57] would minister to them and give them
[57:59] rest and give them lodging and give them
[58:00] water and give them food and he would
[58:02] minister to them and when they would
[58:04] want to give thanks to abraham he would
[58:06] say no jehovah is the one
[58:09] who provided this give thanks to jehovah
[58:12] give thanks to the one true god and so
[58:14] he evoked the name of god by hospitality
[58:17] evoked the name of god by service and he
[58:19] declared the character of god how he
[58:21] ministered to the stranger the
[58:23] unbeliever who came by that grove what a
[58:26] beautiful picture of the church
[58:28] and so this is the seed of abraham's
[58:30] faith genesis 13 i'll give it to you
[58:33] forever you'll
[58:34] i will bless thee forever this is an
[58:36] everlasting covenant this is an
[58:38] everlasting possession and abraham
[58:40] begins to recognize this we see in
[58:41] genesis 21 he's coming to this place
[58:43] where he says this is after isaac is
[58:45] born he said this is the everlasting god
[58:49] and this here as i sow this seed in the
[58:51] beginning this really is the seed of
[58:53] faith holds the key of supreme faith
[58:57] because this is what god is wanting to
[58:58] give to energize abraham's faith
[59:01] and abraham's faith though he was
[59:04] earthbound he was born of a woman and he
[59:06] lived in
[59:08] physically
[59:09] there in the middle east and he had a
[59:11] family had a wife he had a lineage
[59:12] everything was natural but he was not
[59:14] bound we i didn't recognize that abraham
[59:17] begins to live beyond his flesh
[59:19] he's not constrained by natural
[59:21] dimensions he's not bound by natural
[59:23] time he's not uh he's not uh
[59:26] held back even by his physical physical
[59:28] flesh his faith transcends now his
[59:31] physical experience
[59:33] and in romans chapter 4 verse 17 and i
[59:35] believe we'll probably come back to this
[59:38] it says and as it is written i have made
[59:40] the father of many nations before him
[59:42] who he believed even god
[59:44] now notice this designation this is what
[59:46] abraham believed even god who quickeneth
[59:49] the dead
[59:51] and calleth those things which be not as
[59:53] though they were
[59:54] now what's amazing about this statement
[59:57] is that's an attribute of god who can
[59:59] call things that are not
[1:00:01] and make them so it's an attribute of
[1:00:04] god to call those things which be not as
[1:00:05] though they were but this also becomes
[1:00:07] the attribute of abraham who despite not
[1:00:10] being able to see it could speak it and
[1:00:11] believe it as though it was and so any
[1:00:14] he when he says he believed even god
[1:00:17] before him whom he believed god a god
[1:00:19] who's designated as the quickener of the
[1:00:22] dead
[1:00:23] and so abraham's actions in genesis
[1:00:25] chapter 22
[1:00:26] were testimony as this is the revelation
[1:00:29] he has of god it was a testimony of his
[1:00:31] revelation of the nature of god
[1:00:34] when abraham is acting in genesis 22
[1:00:36] it's the culmination of how god through
[1:00:38] a period of time made himself known to
[1:00:40] abraham and gave him a basis to believe
[1:00:43] in god in his attributes and his
[1:00:44] characteristics and his love and his
[1:00:46] concern and what his promises were and
[1:00:48] so it was a testimony of the character
[1:00:51] of god who had revealed himself to him
[1:00:53] through time
[1:00:55] it says here the god who quickens the
[1:00:57] dead or gives life to the dead
[1:01:00] and in this testimony that paul's
[1:01:01] writing he's testifying of isaac and of
[1:01:03] christ
[1:01:04] god that quickeneth the dead
[1:01:06] this is a this is uh the emphasis
[1:01:08] abrahams understanding this is a god
[1:01:10] that quickens the dead and as paul is
[1:01:12] writing he refers to isaac but he's also
[1:01:14] referred to christ
[1:01:16] and so abraham was willing to offer
[1:01:18] isaac
[1:01:19] his only son
[1:01:20] because of an understanding of the god
[1:01:23] he believed in
[1:01:24] and that's important because we have
[1:01:26] faith and that faith is in a god we
[1:01:28] believe that he is
[1:01:29] but there's this the real evidence of
[1:01:31] the holy ghost is as is when the holy
[1:01:34] ghost brings a clear understanding
[1:01:37] not of someone's doctrines or someone's
[1:01:39] opinions or a clear understanding of
[1:01:41] history but an understanding of god and
[1:01:43] his nature and his character that's what
[1:01:45] the word is to reveal is the nature of
[1:01:47] god to us
[1:01:49] and so it was an understanding of the
[1:01:50] god he believed in
[1:01:52] and he had this faith and i'm i'm kind
[1:01:55] of given it i'm not giving it away but
[1:01:57] i'm not maybe i'm not building to a
[1:01:58] great climax i'm already hitting it here
[1:02:00] at the outset
[1:02:01] but he had faith this is where abraham's
[1:02:03] faith was he had faith that god could
[1:02:05] bypass death
[1:02:07] or raise up isaac from it
[1:02:11] this is this is what this is abraham's
[1:02:13] faith is he's god god is he came to this
[1:02:16] place to based upon what god has told me
[1:02:19] if god's word is true and he's proven
[1:02:21] himself to be true he told me i'd have a
[1:02:23] son and i had a son and if he fulfilled
[1:02:25] that what about all the other promises
[1:02:27] that he gave me then can i not believe
[1:02:30] the simple word that he said to me when
[1:02:32] he said he'd be a god forever and this
[1:02:34] would be an everlasting possession
[1:02:37] and so the promise was from god himself
[1:02:40] this is what the bible said the promise
[1:02:41] was from god himself who makes the dead
[1:02:44] live again
[1:02:46] that's abraham's faith this god the one
[1:02:48] who can make the dead to live again is
[1:02:50] the one who gave me the promise so
[1:02:52] abraham was asked to believe something
[1:02:55] that was beyond nature something beyond
[1:02:58] himself and he knew i can't repair isaac
[1:03:00] i can't raise isaac up this is nothing i
[1:03:03] can do so he had to come to a place
[1:03:05] where he was totally dependent upon god
[1:03:08] if god had asked abraham to travel to to
[1:03:10] canaan abraham could do that
[1:03:13] if abraham asked god to build an altar
[1:03:15] abraham could do it abraham was also
[1:03:16] very
[1:03:17] obviously very industrious very skilled
[1:03:20] leader
[1:03:21] and whether it be
[1:03:22] the result of certain things that god
[1:03:24] had gifted him with or just naturally
[1:03:25] had these inclinations but he was able
[1:03:27] to rally his servants
[1:03:29] and to go chase after kings and rescue
[1:03:32] his his nephew lot and so there were
[1:03:34] certain things about abraham that were
[1:03:36] certainly tremendous but abraham finally
[1:03:38] came to a place where he realized this
[1:03:39] is something i can't do i got to trust
[1:03:42] god
[1:03:42] alone and we'll back up and kind of go
[1:03:44] through these instances in his life
[1:03:46] where this is what abraham is coming to
[1:03:49] so the vision that abraham had
[1:03:52] related to something that was beyond
[1:03:54] this life
[1:03:56] and in that way that's how he's that
[1:03:57] true hebrew one who has crossed over
[1:04:02] his faith he left the natural realm was
[1:04:04] living in a faith realm abraham was
[1:04:06] still there and even that land was given
[1:04:08] him as an everlasting covenant and
[1:04:10] everlasting possession abraham was
[1:04:12] called a foreigner or a stranger in the
[1:04:14] land that he possessed and the reason
[1:04:15] why is because he was no longer living
[1:04:17] in that land
[1:04:18] he was living in a faith realm he was
[1:04:20] there but he really wasn't there because
[1:04:22] something had crossed over and
[1:04:24] transcended natural life and so abraham
[1:04:26] was a foreigner right there in his own
[1:04:28] land because he was no longer living
[1:04:30] solely by natural things
[1:04:33] his faith had moved beyond the flesh his
[1:04:36] faith had moved beyond what was visible
[1:04:38] his faith had moved beyond what was
[1:04:39] capable of man and he was believing in a
[1:04:41] god even to a point where abraham was
[1:04:43] looking for a city whose builder and
[1:04:44] maker was god a city that had
[1:04:46] foundations that was eternal and
[1:04:47] permanent amen
[1:04:50] so abraham's faith catch this in the
[1:04:51] beginning his faith was directed towards
[1:04:53] god's power
[1:04:55] of life to give life his power either to
[1:04:58] preserve life or to raise it up
[1:05:01] and it was part of abraham recognizing
[1:05:04] the eternal nature of god's promise
[1:05:07] so we already read it in genesis chapter
[1:05:08] 17 genesis 13 and even as he declared it
[1:05:11] in genesis 21 abraham saying recognizing
[1:05:14] god said he would be a god unto me
[1:05:16] forever
[1:05:18] how can he be a god to me forever if i
[1:05:22] don't live forever
[1:05:24] how can this land be an everlasting
[1:05:26] covenant and an everlasting possession
[1:05:28] if me and my seed cease to exist
[1:05:32] so there was something about the word
[1:05:33] that already been given that he believed
[1:05:35] that begin to kind of marinate if we
[1:05:37] could say that and be evolved and the an
[1:05:39] evolution of this revelation and it
[1:05:41] begins to step forward and be like i've
[1:05:43] always believed this i've always
[1:05:44] believed this i've always believed this
[1:05:45] always believe this and you begin to
[1:05:47] realize just how big it was
[1:05:49] and listen that's exactly what this
[1:05:50] message is to each one of us we believed
[1:05:53] it in its simplicity we accepted it we
[1:05:55] could didn't really have a choice in it
[1:05:57] we were ordained to it and we loved it
[1:05:59] and we fed on it and then we began to
[1:06:00] realize the very things we believed in
[1:06:02] the beginning were so much larger and
[1:06:05] bigger than we could have ever imagined
[1:06:06] but yet we can say that's what i
[1:06:08] believed
[1:06:09] because it's the power in the seed
[1:06:13] and that's what abraham is faith was in
[1:06:15] an eternal promise as it says in romans
[1:06:16] chapter 4 verses 19 to 21 and being not
[1:06:20] weak in faith
[1:06:21] catch this revelation of what uh abraham
[1:06:24] is walking into so beautiful
[1:06:26] and being not weak in faith he
[1:06:28] considered not his own body now dead
[1:06:32] when he was about a hundred years old
[1:06:33] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[1:06:37] he staggered not at the promise of god
[1:06:38] through unbelief so if he staggered it
[1:06:40] wasn't through unbelief
[1:06:42] in god he staggered not at the promise
[1:06:44] of god through unbelief but was strong
[1:06:46] in faith giving glory to god and being
[1:06:49] fully persuaded that what he had
[1:06:52] promised he was able to perform
[1:06:55] and what paul does now and i think maybe
[1:06:57] some of you have already you've already
[1:06:58] jumped maybe to the end of where i'm
[1:07:00] going so if you if you have just get all
[1:07:02] the giddy and excited and pull on me i
[1:07:04] often tell people that the louder you a
[1:07:06] man and the harder you pull the faster i
[1:07:07] preach and all of a sudden like all the
[1:07:08] teenagers are like hey remember there
[1:07:09] come on come on you can do this
[1:07:12] but no if you're with me you'll help me
[1:07:14] just pull me deeper into the word and
[1:07:15] we'll enjoy this but he says and being
[1:07:17] fully persuaded that what he had
[1:07:19] promised he was able to perform in paul
[1:07:21] takes his faith and his conviction in
[1:07:23] god and he takes death
[1:07:26] and he puts it right next to it and he
[1:07:28] wants to take abraham's faith and
[1:07:30] position it against death
[1:07:32] because he says abraham believed god and
[1:07:34] was not weak in faith and considered a
[1:07:36] dead body and a dead womb
[1:07:39] so he's taken his faith and he positions
[1:07:41] his faith against death
[1:07:43] and this is what abraham's faith began
[1:07:45] to come up against is this idea that my
[1:07:47] body is dead that my wife's uh womb is
[1:07:50] dead and he brought his faith
[1:07:52] right up against death to face death and
[1:07:54] this is what abraham triumphs over when
[1:07:57] he believes that god is able to raise up
[1:07:59] isaac
[1:08:01] in genesis chapter 22 verse 4.
[1:08:06] abraham is told in genesis 22 he says go
[1:08:10] and i want you to go to the land of
[1:08:11] moriah to a mountain i'll show you later
[1:08:14] so it's in the very pattern how god
[1:08:15] called them in the beginning in the very
[1:08:17] end abraham's walking by faith
[1:08:19] to a mountain that god will show them
[1:08:21] and it says he rose up early in the
[1:08:23] morning
[1:08:24] and he begins to travel in verse 4 it
[1:08:25] says then on the third day
[1:08:28] abraham lifted up his eyes
[1:08:31] it's on the third day that he lifts up
[1:08:33] his eyes and sees the place that he's
[1:08:35] got to go it's on the third day that he
[1:08:37] takes isaac on top of mount moriah and
[1:08:39] it's on the third day the resurrection
[1:08:42] day that jehovah jireh provides a
[1:08:44] sacrifice
[1:08:47] and it's a resurrection of isaac by this
[1:08:49] ram that is caught in the thicket and
[1:08:51] he's demonstrating this on the third day
[1:08:53] just as christ would resurrect on the
[1:08:55] third day even abraham's life he's
[1:08:57] demonstrating foreshadowing how the
[1:08:59] sacrifice god will provide himself in
[1:09:02] his son christ as a sacrifice
[1:09:05] and this is how brother branham treats
[1:09:07] this in jehovah jireh he says then he
[1:09:09] and let them know
[1:09:12] that you provided a resurrection this is
[1:09:14] what he's uh is he saying it i could
[1:09:17] just say it this way you speaking of god
[1:09:18] you provided a resurrection in form
[1:09:21] there for isaac
[1:09:23] who had come to the end of his road but
[1:09:24] you provided a way for him
[1:09:26] what did god provide on that third day a
[1:09:28] resurrection for isaac
[1:09:31] in hebrews chapter 11 verses 17 18 and
[1:09:33] 19. notice exactly where the scriptures
[1:09:36] are placed in abraham's faith by faith
[1:09:38] abraham
[1:09:39] when he was tried offered up isaac
[1:09:42] and he that received the promises
[1:09:44] offered up his only begotten son so he
[1:09:46] wasn't just offering him up on a whim
[1:09:48] but he was one who was built upon these
[1:09:50] great promises through the revelation of
[1:09:53] the word of god he was built up to this
[1:09:55] place where when he was asked to
[1:09:56] sacrifice his son he's the one who had
[1:09:58] received the promises so it wasn't an
[1:10:00] offering without a basis
[1:10:02] it wasn't an offering without a
[1:10:04] foundation and we can't just pretend to
[1:10:05] be religious and do all sorts of
[1:10:07] religious acts and say that we're
[1:10:09] operating the faith of abraham if it
[1:10:10] doesn't report back to god's word if
[1:10:12] it's not based upon the word of god
[1:10:14] that's been given to us because abraham
[1:10:16] was acting on the word of god one who
[1:10:18] had received the promises and listen to
[1:10:20] what it says it's so beautiful that he
[1:10:22] offered up his only begotten son of whom
[1:10:24] it was said that in isaac shall thy seed
[1:10:26] be called
[1:10:28] so he takes his son and is offering up
[1:10:29] as a sacrifice let's just be real blunt
[1:10:31] he's going to kill his son
[1:10:33] he's going to die he's going to cease to
[1:10:34] be ceased to exist and he says this is
[1:10:37] the one through which your seed is going
[1:10:39] to be called so it means abraham has no
[1:10:42] children he finally he has isaac his son
[1:10:44] of sarah and then through him god has
[1:10:46] told him more seeds are going to come to
[1:10:48] the place where there's going to be
[1:10:49] kings there's going to be nations and
[1:10:51] abraham is being asked to kill the sun
[1:10:53] through which the rest of the seed is
[1:10:54] going to come so verse 19. this is
[1:10:57] abraham's faith accounting that god was
[1:11:00] able to raise him up
[1:11:02] even from the dead from whence also he
[1:11:05] received him in a figure
[1:11:08] paul is telling us that abraham believed
[1:11:11] he'd come to a place where he was
[1:11:12] absolutely convinced and fully persuaded
[1:11:15] that he that promised that isaac would
[1:11:17] birth kings and birth nations he
[1:11:19] believed that god was able to resurrect
[1:11:22] isaac from the dead
[1:11:24] and how can he believe that he had
[1:11:26] already witnessed life over death his
[1:11:28] body been dead sarah's womb been dead
[1:11:30] god had already demonstrated something
[1:11:32] to him to give him a reason to believe
[1:11:34] that if i could resurrect a woman if i
[1:11:36] could resurrect your body then can't you
[1:11:38] believe me that i can resurrect your son
[1:11:40] isaac
[1:11:42] this is the progressive revelation of
[1:11:44] abraham
[1:11:45] from faith to supreme faith
[1:11:49] he came to a place where he said wait a
[1:11:50] minute god wants me to kill him
[1:11:52] but he also told me he was going to give
[1:11:53] birth to kings that means god this is
[1:11:56] the revelation that means god's got to
[1:11:57] resurrect him
[1:11:59] that means god is greater than death
[1:12:01] that means god i am going to witness the
[1:12:03] resurrection i'm going to kill my son
[1:12:05] and god's going to raise him right back
[1:12:06] up again amen
[1:12:08] amen in my redeemer liveth brother
[1:12:10] braham said abraham said
[1:12:12] i've had the same kind of vision
[1:12:14] we're up yonder on the mountain when
[1:12:16] christ god met me listen to that god met
[1:12:19] me and christ gave me his redemptive
[1:12:21] names as jehovah jireh jehovah rapha and
[1:12:23] all those things seeing the death burial
[1:12:26] and resurrection
[1:12:28] so what was it that abraham saw
[1:12:30] what did god show him he showed him
[1:12:32] death burial and resurrection this is
[1:12:35] abraham's faith this is his revelation
[1:12:37] again in the sermon my redeemer liveth
[1:12:38] he says i laid him on the altar he was
[1:12:41] going to take his own life
[1:12:43] knowing abraham's testimony knowing that
[1:12:46] i had received him as one from the dead
[1:12:48] i believe that he would raise him up
[1:12:51] again
[1:12:52] and through this great hope that beats
[1:12:53] in my heart i know he said he could
[1:12:56] raise him up brother bram says it was a
[1:12:58] foresight of the resurrection
[1:13:02] abraham's revelation now if you could
[1:13:04] catch this abraham's revelation just it
[1:13:07] had grown from believing that god who
[1:13:10] called him would bring him to a place
[1:13:11] that he would show them thereafter he
[1:13:13] says the same god that called me showed
[1:13:14] me this is where i'm going to be they're
[1:13:15] saying god that told me i'd have a son
[1:13:17] gave me a son it matures to where he has
[1:13:19] a revelation of the rapture
[1:13:21] he has a resurrect a revelation of the
[1:13:23] resurrection he came to a place where he
[1:13:24] had a vision of the rapture he says the
[1:13:27] same thing that job had
[1:13:30] where job said for i know that my
[1:13:31] redeemer liveth job 19 and he shall the
[1:13:34] redeemer shall stand at the latter day
[1:13:36] upon the earth brother iran said that
[1:13:38] god met him christ revealed himself as
[1:13:40] jehovah jabber jehovah rapha he saw
[1:13:42] death burial and resurrection
[1:13:45] job sees my redeemer liveth
[1:13:47] and he shall stand at the latter day
[1:13:49] upon the earth and though after my skin
[1:13:52] worms destroyed this body what does he
[1:13:54] say yet in my flesh shall i see god
[1:13:59] so abram job wasn't just testifying well
[1:14:01] i know there's an eternal god and he's
[1:14:03] going to live forever
[1:14:04] and and he'll forever reign and this
[1:14:06] will be an everlasting covenant for him
[1:14:08] and this is god's promise and god's word
[1:14:09] is true
[1:14:10] and job just didn't testify in the end
[1:14:12] the redeemer's going to live but he said
[1:14:14] my redeemer liveth and therefore since
[1:14:16] he's my redeemer he's going to stand in
[1:14:19] the last days and i will be there with
[1:14:21] him because he's going to redeem me from
[1:14:23] the pit he's going to redeem me from the
[1:14:24] grave even if this body be destroyed the
[1:14:27] power of god is going to bring it back
[1:14:29] together and i'll stand eternally with
[1:14:31] my redeemer
[1:14:33] that's the same revelation that abraham
[1:14:36] had
[1:14:37] before sight of the resurrection
[1:14:38] brotherhood said about job he saw the
[1:14:39] coming of the lord
[1:14:41] he saw the manifestation and the power
[1:14:43] of god over death
[1:14:46] is that not what the transfiguration
[1:14:47] represents
[1:14:49] and he said they took him up on a
[1:14:50] mountain set apart in mount
[1:14:52] transfiguration and he was transfigured
[1:14:55] this is that power of god the glory
[1:14:57] being declared the power of god over
[1:14:59] death
[1:15:02] abraham saw what job saw the
[1:15:04] resurrection
[1:15:05] this is a very specific manifestation of
[1:15:07] god this is just not an appearing of god
[1:15:09] and god working miracles this is a
[1:15:10] climax of culmination because god's plan
[1:15:12] from the beginning is redemption
[1:15:16] in john chapter 11 verses 25 and 26
[1:15:18] jesus said
[1:15:19] i am the resurrection
[1:15:22] so the resurrection is not an event it's
[1:15:23] not a date
[1:15:25] it's a it's a person i am the
[1:15:26] resurrection and the life he that
[1:15:28] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:15:30] shall he live right now there's where
[1:15:32] abraham's faith that's right there he's
[1:15:35] abraham's saying i'm believing in the
[1:15:37] redeemer i'm believing in the eternal
[1:15:38] god if you believe in him though you're
[1:15:41] dead you shall live what does that
[1:15:42] testify of a resurrection he says and
[1:15:44] whosoever liveth and believeth in me
[1:15:47] shall never die believeth thou this that
[1:15:49] testifies of a rapture that there's
[1:15:52] believers who had no less faith in god
[1:15:55] than you do as far as salvation and
[1:15:57] believing that god is and having faith
[1:15:59] in christ in a revelation of the new
[1:16:01] birth personally to them a revelation of
[1:16:03] christ and people die in the faith and
[1:16:06] because they've died believing in the
[1:16:08] resurrection the first they're going to
[1:16:10] come right back up but there's also
[1:16:12] promise that he that believeth and is
[1:16:14] alive we that are alive and remain shall
[1:16:17] not taste death but we shall be changed
[1:16:22] that's the promise of christ
[1:16:25] and so jesus christ is the resurrection
[1:16:29] and so abraham's revelation brings
[1:16:30] christ into view brother ram said he saw
[1:16:32] christ on that mountain
[1:16:34] and so abraham's revelation brought
[1:16:36] christ into view now you see in my
[1:16:37] redeemer he's seen christ
[1:16:39] the very heart of god the revelation of
[1:16:40] god
[1:16:42] and this is how abraham is an example
[1:16:43] for us in the end time
[1:16:46] his life is even demonstrating that
[1:16:48] mystery of rapturing faith
[1:16:51] his life there's something
[1:16:53] embodied in his testimony something
[1:16:55] exemplified in his life
[1:16:57] his revelation his walk of faith is
[1:16:59] testifying of our walk of faith of our
[1:17:02] life
[1:17:03] and our supreme faith
[1:17:05] mark chapter 12 verses 23
[1:17:07] to 27
[1:17:09] mark chapter 12 verses 23 to 27
[1:17:13] he says in the resurrection therefore
[1:17:15] they're asking them this question when
[1:17:16] they shall rise and what's the story
[1:17:18] where he says that a man got married and
[1:17:20] he before any and he dies and he has a
[1:17:23] brother and is married
[1:17:24] through seven brothers right quite the
[1:17:26] question so they're wanting to know that
[1:17:28] this woman that had seven brothers as
[1:17:30] husbands according to the law of
[1:17:31] redemption that when he the husband died
[1:17:33] her brother had to marry his brother had
[1:17:34] to marry her they asked this question
[1:17:36] who's gonna be the husband for the seven
[1:17:39] hatter to wife
[1:17:40] and recognize his answer
[1:17:43] jesus answering some of them do you not
[1:17:45] therefore
[1:17:46] air
[1:17:47] because you know not the scriptures
[1:17:49] neither the power of god
[1:17:52] for when they shall rise from the dead
[1:17:54] they neither marry nor given in marriage
[1:17:56] but are as the angels which are in
[1:17:58] heaven
[1:17:59] and as touching the dead that they rise
[1:18:02] have you not read in the book of moses
[1:18:04] how in the bush god spake unto him
[1:18:07] saying
[1:18:08] i am
[1:18:10] the god of abraham
[1:18:11] and the god of isaac and the god of
[1:18:13] jacob that's the revelation that christ
[1:18:16] has he is not the god of the dead but
[1:18:18] the god of the living therefore
[1:18:21] ye therefore do greatly air
[1:18:23] this is abraham's revelation he realized
[1:18:26] that god is not a god of the dead
[1:18:29] so how can i believe in the god who is
[1:18:31] life how can i believe in a god who is
[1:18:34] eternal life himself how can i believe
[1:18:36] in him and have true faith in him and
[1:18:38] never die how could i ever cease to be
[1:18:41] because god is the god of abraham the
[1:18:43] god of isaac the god of jacob he is not
[1:18:45] the god of the dead he is the god of the
[1:18:47] living and that's where they air not
[1:18:49] knowing the power of god because when
[1:18:51] they shall rise from the dead he says
[1:18:52] you have not considered
[1:18:54] who god is i am the god of abraham i am
[1:18:57] therefore the god of the living
[1:19:00] amen
[1:19:00] he's rebuking their their full
[1:19:02] understanding of who god is and the
[1:19:03] nature of god
[1:19:05] and so in john 8 56 when jesus says your
[1:19:07] father abraham rejoiced to see my day
[1:19:10] and he saw it
[1:19:13] and was glad
[1:19:15] now that's a deep scripture
[1:19:18] abraham rejoiced
[1:19:20] to see my day we could say well that
[1:19:22] means abraham was you know he was
[1:19:24] excited to see it he wanted to see it he
[1:19:26] was hopeful to see it and he saw it
[1:19:30] and was glad
[1:19:32] his soul the word there he rejoiced to
[1:19:34] see his soul left forward in expectation
[1:19:39] to the revelation of jesus christ to his
[1:19:41] seed
[1:19:42] this is what faith does it's
[1:19:44] faith is i preached it and i guess maybe
[1:19:46] you have to be careful with the word and
[1:19:47] use it but faith in the word of god is
[1:19:49] ecstatic
[1:19:51] it's an ecstasy it transcends the flesh
[1:19:54] it goes it's going beyond our natural
[1:19:56] experience and abraham was transported
[1:19:58] from the time that he was living by
[1:20:00] revelation and he longed to see the day
[1:20:03] when this seed would be revealed to the
[1:20:04] people he longed to see the
[1:20:06] manifestation of the full promise and
[1:20:08] not only the bible say he hoped to see
[1:20:10] it and imagined it and believed it he
[1:20:12] rejoiced to see it and revelation
[1:20:14] carries him forward to see it and he saw
[1:20:17] the revelation of jesus christ to his
[1:20:20] seat after him
[1:20:22] hallelujah he saw the revelation of
[1:20:25] christ to his seed it says he saw it and
[1:20:27] was glad he beheld it to his joy
[1:20:32] what did abraham see
[1:20:33] he saw the manifestation of god
[1:20:36] it's all the manifestation of god in
[1:20:37] flesh he saw christ in melchizedek in
[1:20:39] genesis 14
[1:20:40] after returning from the slaughter of
[1:20:42] the kings who's the first one to try to
[1:20:43] meet him king of sodom tries to come in
[1:20:45] there and confuse things but then it's
[1:20:46] melchizedek who reveals himself serves
[1:20:48] him bread and wine after the slaughter
[1:20:51] institutes the communion abraham
[1:20:52] instituting the tithing
[1:20:55] abraham being taught by that angel
[1:20:56] repeating even what the king melchizedek
[1:20:59] says abraham begins to repeat it
[1:21:02] so he sees christ in melchizedek in
[1:21:04] genesis 14.
[1:21:05] he saw christ in the days of lot didn't
[1:21:07] he
[1:21:08] as it was in the days of lot so shall it
[1:21:10] be in the coming of the son of man well
[1:21:12] abraham lived it perfectly
[1:21:14] that's the original days of lot right
[1:21:16] that's not a hard one for us to say amen
[1:21:17] to it is the literal days of lot and
[1:21:20] what does he say he sees christ revealed
[1:21:23] in flesh in the plains of memory in
[1:21:24] genesis 18. he is seeing the revelation
[1:21:27] of christ
[1:21:30] you know the bible says abraham's seed
[1:21:32] will see the same thing
[1:21:34] does not the bible promise that the same
[1:21:36] revelation that came to abraham will
[1:21:38] come to the royal seat of
[1:21:40] abraham brother says in the sermon be
[1:21:43] not afraid he says and remember the last
[1:21:45] sign that was given to abraham
[1:21:47] which was a type of those who will go in
[1:21:48] the rapture
[1:21:50] abraham is a type of those who will go
[1:21:52] on the rapture
[1:21:53] and the sermon who is this melchizedek
[1:21:55] he says when abraham met him he was
[1:21:57] melchizedek
[1:21:58] he unfolds here what all the attributes
[1:22:01] will do in the final end every son of
[1:22:03] abraham
[1:22:04] every son of faith will absolutely do
[1:22:07] the same thing but i want to watch how
[1:22:09] we have to come
[1:22:11] think of that
[1:22:12] that's a mouthful brother john i'm just
[1:22:14] giving you a whole bunch of material
[1:22:15] you're gonna have you're gonna have to
[1:22:16] go to you just have to have service
[1:22:18] every night of the week to get through
[1:22:19] melchizedek just think about this
[1:22:21] he unfolds here with all the attributes
[1:22:24] will do in the final and that's you
[1:22:26] every son of abraham every son of faith
[1:22:29] will absolutely do the same thing but i
[1:22:31] want to watch how we have to come we
[1:22:32] have to come a certain way have to come
[1:22:34] the same way abraham did yes
[1:22:36] and in genesis chapter 18 verse 14 when
[1:22:38] he reveals himself in flesh to abraham
[1:22:40] he says is anything too hard for the
[1:22:42] lord
[1:22:43] at the time appointed i will return unto
[1:22:46] thee according to the time of life and
[1:22:48] sarah shall have a son
[1:22:50] he unfolds here what he will do to every
[1:22:52] attribute in the final end every son of
[1:22:55] abraham is going to receive christ they
[1:22:58] have to receive him in this revelation
[1:22:59] that he's going to come according to the
[1:23:01] time of life when the word is birthed
[1:23:03] when the word is coming forth into full
[1:23:05] manifestation and there's glory the
[1:23:06] bride is going to bring forth jesus
[1:23:09] christ in its fullness again
[1:23:11] according to the time of life what is it
[1:23:13] a season for resurrection
[1:23:15] where sarah had the dead think of that
[1:23:17] sarah who was dead in her womb abraham
[1:23:19] dead in his body i will return according
[1:23:21] to the time of life and i will quick in
[1:23:23] a dead womb
[1:23:24] to season for a resurrection a season
[1:23:26] when deadness is conquered a season when
[1:23:28] the promise is fulfilled
[1:23:31] and paul takes in romans 9 9 for this is
[1:23:33] the word of promise at this time will i
[1:23:36] come and sarah shall have a son
[1:23:40] realize abraham's life is actually set
[1:23:41] it in order the rapture
[1:23:44] a set time determined by god i will come
[1:23:48] and return and give life over death
[1:23:52] think of the four death messengers the
[1:23:53] fourth four life messengers who's that
[1:23:55] fourth messenger it's christ coming at
[1:23:57] the open word to what to give life
[1:24:00] the children have come to the birth and
[1:24:01] there's power now to bring forth i will
[1:24:03] come and sarah the bride will bring
[1:24:05] forth jesus christ
[1:24:08] if i can say it this way before the
[1:24:10] meeting in the air
[1:24:13] there must be a visitation to bring
[1:24:14] rapturing faith
[1:24:17] before that we we know that we're in
[1:24:19] that rapture cycle now
[1:24:21] and i say this with respect
[1:24:23] that god's going to work through his
[1:24:25] bride to bring the rest from the grave
[1:24:27] he's not going to work through those who
[1:24:28] are in the grave to bring us to rapture
[1:24:30] in faith we are actually going to draw
[1:24:31] the rest of them from the grave and go
[1:24:33] in the rapture
[1:24:34] so as much as i love those saints that
[1:24:36] have gone before us just thinking about
[1:24:37] brother daniel this week
[1:24:39] brother dan missing him and the
[1:24:41] different believers we know that have
[1:24:42] passed on and gone before us and you
[1:24:44] think of just as we continue and as time
[1:24:46] goes on there's gonna be more men of god
[1:24:48] there's gonna be more servants gonna be
[1:24:49] more moms and dads and faithful people
[1:24:51] that go on and they're waiting on us
[1:24:55] as much as i long to see them and be in
[1:24:56] fellowship with them again and there's
[1:24:58] friends i know i'm looking forward to
[1:24:59] see out that day and that meeting in the
[1:25:01] air but it's not going to be their
[1:25:03] resurrected bodies that give me
[1:25:04] rapturing faith it's going to be the
[1:25:06] resurrected jesus christ revealed
[1:25:08] personally to me through his word that's
[1:25:10] going to bring me to a place of
[1:25:11] rapturing faith
[1:25:14] brother braham says in the sermon
[1:25:15] abraham and his seat after him our
[1:25:16] bodies will have to be changed
[1:25:18] we just can't turn back to young men and
[1:25:20] women we've got to have a different kind
[1:25:22] of body so you can be caught in the air
[1:25:24] to receive the promised son so notice
[1:25:26] the very order of that meeting in the
[1:25:28] air where you'll see him in that
[1:25:29] corporal flesh that's what the church is
[1:25:31] waiting for now this is in 1961 the true
[1:25:34] church
[1:25:35] every manifestation that he did to
[1:25:38] abraham he has done to his seat after
[1:25:40] him leaving one thing out that's the
[1:25:43] rapture of the church
[1:25:46] so the rapture of the church is embodied
[1:25:47] in abraham's life he says everything
[1:25:49] that he's done to the seed of abraham
[1:25:50] he's done to a seed after him what he
[1:25:52] did to abraham he's done to a seat after
[1:25:54] him except for the rapture of the church
[1:25:58] think about the things he did to abraham
[1:25:59] i'm making great time today this is
[1:26:00] wonderful
[1:26:01] that in genesis chapter 14 it just means
[1:26:03] i may not be preaching wednesday night
[1:26:05] pastor i'm sorry i may be getting
[1:26:06] through this in genesis chapter 14 who
[1:26:09] is it that madam melchizedek the king of
[1:26:11] salem
[1:26:13] the priest of the most high god brother
[1:26:15] man says god himself
[1:26:17] came down and revealed himself to
[1:26:19] abraham that happens this is what needs
[1:26:22] to unfold to us in genesis chapter 18
[1:26:24] says the lord appeared unto abraham in
[1:26:26] the plains of memory
[1:26:28] who is it that's making himself known to
[1:26:30] abraham it's god revealing himself and
[1:26:32] he says what he did to abraham he has to
[1:26:34] do to his seat after him and there's
[1:26:36] only one thing he hadn't done yet reveal
[1:26:38] himself at the time of the rapture of
[1:26:40] the church
[1:26:42] so who's this melchizedek he says praise
[1:26:44] god for the opening of the seals
[1:26:47] to know these things
[1:26:49] now
[1:26:50] the true revelation of melchizedek comes
[1:26:52] into view
[1:26:53] now the true revelation of melchizedek
[1:26:55] comes in that had to be revealed abraham
[1:26:57] could have never made the top of mount
[1:26:59] moriah without king melchizedek prince
[1:27:01] the prince of salem
[1:27:02] could have never made it unless the lord
[1:27:04] had appeared to him and reaffirmed the
[1:27:06] promise what was the messenger of the
[1:27:07] covenant
[1:27:09] confirming the promise that god had
[1:27:10] given him in genesis 12 confirming the
[1:27:12] promise in genesis 13 confirming the
[1:27:14] promise in genesis 17 he appears to
[1:27:16] confirm the covenant he's a covenant
[1:27:18] angel
[1:27:19] and so the open of the seals we know the
[1:27:21] of the revelation of jesus christ
[1:27:23] is to bring supreme faith to the bride
[1:27:26] just as it did with abraham is to do it
[1:27:28] with the bride
[1:27:30] that's how we could say abraham's life
[1:27:32] testifies
[1:27:33] of the bride's supreme faith for a
[1:27:35] rapture
[1:27:36] where did his faith begin in election
[1:27:39] what was built on that's it
[1:27:41] abraham didn't have a better rock
[1:27:43] collection in his garden hit no offense
[1:27:46] he didn't have he didn't have you know a
[1:27:48] nice car he didn't have a better altar
[1:27:49] he didn't have a more perfect family
[1:27:51] it was election
[1:27:53] but his election
[1:27:54] grew as god revealed himself
[1:27:56] his faith grew from election
[1:27:59] and it began to manifest the character
[1:28:00] of god
[1:28:02] reverend says after you've trusted him
[1:28:03] and watched him do so many things till
[1:28:05] it just becomes like a regular routine
[1:28:07] and that's the condition i think the
[1:28:08] church will be in just before the
[1:28:10] rapture before the coming of the lord he
[1:28:11] says so the rapture will go on right on
[1:28:13] the that way it'll just be a regular
[1:28:15] routine of following the scriptures in
[1:28:17] the plans of god
[1:28:18] from a revelation of election to a
[1:28:20] revelation of perfection
[1:28:23] our rapture and faith brother i'm saying
[1:28:25] will come we'll it's going to rise by
[1:28:28] simply believing
[1:28:29] simply obeying amen not adding to not
[1:28:32] trying to be mysterious
[1:28:34] that's right brother brown says in the
[1:28:35] first seal he's talking about referring
[1:28:36] to revelations chapter 10 and the
[1:28:37] mystery of the seven thunders he says
[1:28:39] this in the first seal as he begins to
[1:28:41] preach we don't know what they are yet
[1:28:42] but my opinion they'll be revealed right
[1:28:44] away and when it does it'll give faith
[1:28:47] for that rapture and grace for the
[1:28:48] church to move out
[1:28:50] and he starts saying we've looked
[1:28:51] through the dispensations we've watched
[1:28:53] everything we've seen the mysteries of
[1:28:54] god we've seen the gathering the bride
[1:28:55] in last days but there's something that
[1:28:56] we just can't lighten ourselves with
[1:28:59] there's something another but i imagine
[1:29:01] when the mysteries begin to come forth
[1:29:02] god said hold it back wait a minute i'll
[1:29:04] reveal it in that day
[1:29:06] don't write it at all
[1:29:07] john because they'll stagger over it
[1:29:09] just let it go
[1:29:11] listen i know we're getting close to an
[1:29:13] hour here he says but it'll reveal it in
[1:29:16] that day when it has need to be done
[1:29:20] when's the revelation going to come when
[1:29:21] you need it
[1:29:23] the revelation is going to come in that
[1:29:24] time at that moment when you need it to
[1:29:26] be done this is exactly what happened in
[1:29:27] abraham's life
[1:29:29] when he needed that when he needed it
[1:29:31] god revealed himself
[1:29:34] god didn't reveal himself that way in
[1:29:35] the very beginning listen and i just
[1:29:38] there there's a way that i want your
[1:29:39] your the holy spirit maybe to search
[1:29:41] these things out in your heart god
[1:29:42] didn't wake abraham up one day in the
[1:29:44] tent there in chaldea and say hey wake
[1:29:46] up don't get scared i'm god
[1:29:48] and i'm this is what's gonna happen
[1:29:50] you're gonna travel down into canaan and
[1:29:52] you're going to do this and you're going
[1:29:52] to just you're just mapping it all out
[1:29:54] for me one day you're going to have a
[1:29:55] son he's going to be named isaac and
[1:29:56] he's going to go up to a certain age and
[1:29:57] when he grows up to that age i'm going
[1:29:58] to ask you to kill him but i'm you're
[1:30:00] going to pretend you're going to go
[1:30:01] through the motions to kill him then i'm
[1:30:02] going to stop your hand he's going to
[1:30:03] continue on and he doesn't lay it all
[1:30:05] out and everybody's like okay okay can
[1:30:07] you write this down because this can be
[1:30:08] really hard can you just remember can
[1:30:09] you give me some cues here
[1:30:10] he didn't lay it all out for him
[1:30:13] but he revealed he revealed himself in a
[1:30:15] way to where this is genuine faith being
[1:30:18] cultivated in abraham and he finally
[1:30:19] came to a place where it dawns on him
[1:30:22] and he begins to realize wait a minute
[1:30:23] wait a minute the god that met me there
[1:30:25] in ur the chaldeans the god that met me
[1:30:28] there and has revealed himself and met
[1:30:30] me and met me and met me and provided
[1:30:32] and provided and provided this god at
[1:30:34] the time that he needed burst forth into
[1:30:37] rapturing faith revealed himself as the
[1:30:39] resurrection and the life and abraham
[1:30:41] can say i know
[1:30:42] i know he's able to raise isaac from the
[1:30:45] dead
[1:30:48] and brother brown says in the seventh
[1:30:50] seal when he's talking about don't get
[1:30:51] weird don't get mysterious
[1:30:52] that's what people have tried to do to
[1:30:54] the third pull they've taken it right
[1:30:55] out of the realm of faith god manifested
[1:30:57] in flesh and they've made it some hocus
[1:30:59] pocus weird stuff and it's caused people
[1:31:01] to turn away
[1:31:02] the reality of the seventh seal is a
[1:31:04] life lived by the word amen
[1:31:06] brother says in the seventh seal it will
[1:31:08] be revealed in that day
[1:31:09] in the hour that it's supposed to be
[1:31:11] revealed in
[1:31:14] so the thing for us to do is to be
[1:31:15] reverent before god and serve him
[1:31:17] and do all that we know to do and live
[1:31:19] good christian lives
[1:31:20] why because that's the how the rapture
[1:31:22] is going to come the regular routine of
[1:31:23] following the scriptures in the plans of
[1:31:24] god
[1:31:25] this doesn't take away the reality of
[1:31:27] the seventh seal this is the reality of
[1:31:28] the seventh seal some people read that
[1:31:30] and said well forget the seventh seal
[1:31:31] we'll just put that up
[1:31:33] someone i've even heard somebody had
[1:31:34] said that they read it when it was when
[1:31:36] it was read it when it was first printed
[1:31:37] and haven't read it again because they
[1:31:39] read oh just be simple don't make
[1:31:40] anything out of it but they're missing
[1:31:41] the revelation of it abraham's life held
[1:31:44] the revelation
[1:31:46] his life lays the pattern of it
[1:31:49] here's the example of aaron he holds the
[1:31:50] type but the man says everything he did
[1:31:51] to abraham he's got to do to us
[1:31:55] so let's
[1:31:57] let's start all over in genesis chapter
[1:31:58] 11.
[1:32:00] and i was taking i was pulling a lot of
[1:32:02] this stuff out last night because i knew
[1:32:03] i just had way too much
[1:32:06] and i want to just do it quickly if i
[1:32:07] could just
[1:32:08] give a quick overview of abraham's life
[1:32:11] in genesis chapter 11 verses 29 to 32
[1:32:15] i'm not going to read all of it i'm not
[1:32:16] going to read the whole testimony of his
[1:32:18] life so if you're starting to get
[1:32:19] anxious
[1:32:20] wondering if the restaurants are going
[1:32:21] to close before i'm finished
[1:32:23] that's not going to happen
[1:32:26] i think some of them are open 24 7. so i
[1:32:28] know that's not going to happen
[1:32:30] genesis chapter 11 verse 29 to 32 it
[1:32:32] begins to tell the story of abraham
[1:32:35] as it leads up to this is all building
[1:32:37] from the moment that noah gets off the
[1:32:39] ark god's just trying to get to a place
[1:32:40] we can understand the setting for
[1:32:41] abraham
[1:32:43] and he's 70 years old when he's called
[1:32:46] and moved to haran with his dad and his
[1:32:49] nephew
[1:32:50] he's there in iran for five years before
[1:32:51] god moves him out of her own and it's
[1:32:54] his father that stays behind his father
[1:32:55] who dies
[1:32:57] and this move out of her
[1:32:59] to iran and then down into palestine
[1:33:01] these are the first steps of abraham's
[1:33:02] progressive faith progressive obedience
[1:33:04] i think we mentioned that wednesday
[1:33:06] he's progressively obeying god leave
[1:33:08] okay where am i going i'll show you
[1:33:09] later
[1:33:10] we know those many years later he comes
[1:33:12] to a place on a mountain
[1:33:14] go to a mountain i'll show you later
[1:33:16] abraham's i've been i've walked this
[1:33:17] road
[1:33:18] this is the regular routine
[1:33:20] this is how god reveals himself and so
[1:33:21] this is his journey of faith
[1:33:23] god having spoke to him in genesis
[1:33:25] chapter 12 i think we'll just start
[1:33:26] walking through these verses maybe one
[1:33:28] by one here
[1:33:29] and let's just start with verse two he
[1:33:31] says and i will make of thee a great
[1:33:32] nation this is god speaking i'll make it
[1:33:34] be a great nation and i will bless thee
[1:33:36] and make thy name great thou shalt be a
[1:33:37] blessing and i will bless them that
[1:33:39] bless thee and curse him that curseth
[1:33:40] thee and in thee shall all families of
[1:33:42] the earth be blessed
[1:33:45] if abraham if this really just the seed
[1:33:48] of that if it could dawn on him he'd
[1:33:49] have to realize
[1:33:50] my life is going to be so so transformed
[1:33:53] to what it is now
[1:33:54] and at any given moment he had to look
[1:33:56] at his life and say how is how are
[1:33:58] people being blessed by this life at
[1:34:00] this point so there's something such a
[1:34:02] beautiful seed here let's skip to verse
[1:34:03] 7.
[1:34:04] and then this is god spoke to him now
[1:34:06] he's going to speak to appear to him
[1:34:07] again and the lord appeared unto abram
[1:34:10] and said unto thy seed will i give this
[1:34:12] land so now he's journeyed to the
[1:34:13] promised land
[1:34:15] and the progressive revelation of god
[1:34:17] come out to a land that i'll show you
[1:34:19] and he comes and he's journey it's been
[1:34:20] a few years now and he comes to a place
[1:34:22] where now he says this is the land i'll
[1:34:24] give thee and then abraham builds an
[1:34:26] altar unto the lord
[1:34:28] who appeared unto him
[1:34:30] so his revelation has progressed
[1:34:33] he's now if this is the recognize the
[1:34:36] lord who appears the lord speaks and the
[1:34:37] lord appears to him and now he's called
[1:34:39] upon the name of the lord he's
[1:34:41] worshiping the lord who has appeared
[1:34:43] unto him
[1:34:45] and so he says i will unto thy seed will
[1:34:47] i give this land by offspring
[1:34:49] so what is he confirming god appears to
[1:34:51] him and confirms that you're going to
[1:34:52] bring forth many descendants that was
[1:34:54] the original message
[1:34:55] he says i'm going to give you this land
[1:34:56] the promise is coming into view the
[1:34:58] promised land this is the land that i
[1:34:59] told you i was going to show you this is
[1:35:01] it
[1:35:02] so god told me he'd have many nations
[1:35:03] come out of them he confirms it and he
[1:35:05] says and i told you that i'd show you
[1:35:06] the land and i've showed you so what
[1:35:08] ought that to do give him confidence
[1:35:10] that there's a seed coming amen see how
[1:35:11] god's working with abraham
[1:35:13] i'm going to show you a land and i'm
[1:35:14] going to give you nations
[1:35:16] he says here's the land did i tell you
[1:35:18] i'd give you nations so abraham could
[1:35:20] believe the next promise
[1:35:22] he says i give this is the land the lord
[1:35:24] is going to give to them this land has
[1:35:26] this eternal possession
[1:35:28] verse eight and he removed from thence
[1:35:29] unto a mountain on the east of bethel
[1:35:31] and pitched his tent having bethel in
[1:35:32] the west and haiy on the east and there
[1:35:34] he builded an altar unto the lord
[1:35:37] and called upon the name of the lord his
[1:35:39] revelations progressing you know this is
[1:35:42] different in his worship
[1:35:43] he he builds an altar to the lord now
[1:35:45] he's calling he's evoking the name of
[1:35:46] the lord this is part of abraham's
[1:35:48] testimony
[1:35:49] to others
[1:35:50] he's building a even a church a place of
[1:35:52] worship and abraham abram journeyed
[1:35:54] going on still towards the south
[1:35:57] this is where the story the plot
[1:35:58] thickens and there was a famine in the
[1:36:00] land
[1:36:01] and abraham went down into egypt to soul
[1:36:04] germ there that means to live and to
[1:36:05] tarry for the famine was grievous in the
[1:36:08] land
[1:36:09] now in tracking this story this is where
[1:36:11] faith i want abraham just begin to get
[1:36:13] really relatable to us because the way
[1:36:15] that the lord has structured this and i
[1:36:16] say it was the lord because
[1:36:18] um not that i would blame him if you
[1:36:20] don't get it but
[1:36:22] that first part of rapturing faith
[1:36:24] that's so surreal to me it's so amazing
[1:36:27] to see that in the scripture well
[1:36:29] abraham believed that god was going to
[1:36:31] resurrect the dead that's why he could
[1:36:32] offer up isaac it wasn't just this
[1:36:33] ignorant obedience
[1:36:35] we make out abraham to be some sort of
[1:36:37] you know murderer you know somebody
[1:36:39] who's disconnected from reality that's
[1:36:40] not god brother man talks about us
[1:36:42] becoming insane sensible believers
[1:36:44] and abraham wasn't just this psychotic
[1:36:47] believer oh my goodness if that's what i
[1:36:48] got to do poke my eyes out and do this
[1:36:50] and do that no it was firmly rested upon
[1:36:52] the revelation that god is either going
[1:36:53] to have to bypass death or raise them up
[1:36:56] it was a place of revelation and full
[1:36:58] understanding amen and so this part of
[1:37:00] abraham is so extraordinary to see that
[1:37:02] overview of rapturing faith and christ
[1:37:04] being revealed to abraham but now when
[1:37:05] you begin to get the nitty-gritty of his
[1:37:07] life god has given him all these
[1:37:08] precious promises even fulfilled him and
[1:37:10] showed him the land and then now
[1:37:11] abraham's saying oh there's a famine
[1:37:14] and a famine is what causes him to leave
[1:37:16] the promised land
[1:37:17] the place that god said this land i gave
[1:37:19] you i gave it to you forever
[1:37:21] and to your seat after you
[1:37:23] forever
[1:37:24] and all of a sudden abraham's like oh no
[1:37:26] there's not enough grain
[1:37:28] and leaves the place that god said he
[1:37:30] can live forever
[1:37:32] leaves a place that god said would be a
[1:37:33] seed to him forever
[1:37:35] and this is where i think just one
[1:37:36] instance and i can't i'm not gonna be
[1:37:38] able to get to all the different
[1:37:39] instances that are relatable
[1:37:41] but
[1:37:43] for us god has already promised us his
[1:37:45] blessings
[1:37:47] he's already promised us many different
[1:37:49] things we see in the word of god we see
[1:37:51] him fulfilling different things in the
[1:37:52] word and god had already promised him
[1:37:54] the land he'd already promised him
[1:37:55] blessings he promised to the seed after
[1:37:57] him
[1:37:58] and therefore abraham didn't need to
[1:38:00] fret he didn't need to worry
[1:38:03] this terrible famine that came upon the
[1:38:05] land the threat of death why was he
[1:38:07] afraid of a famine because if you don't
[1:38:08] eat you die
[1:38:10] so god had already promised to preserve
[1:38:12] him in the land but abraham got afraid
[1:38:15] of dying for the lack of grain and then
[1:38:17] the the drought and lack of rain and
[1:38:19] this caused him to move to egypt
[1:38:22] what did it speak about some uncertainty
[1:38:26] about the promise
[1:38:28] some lack of understanding about what
[1:38:30] the promise meant because as soon as
[1:38:32] death started looming abraham leaves to
[1:38:33] go find a place he can be fed
[1:38:36] and that's exactly what we do sometimes
[1:38:37] god has made promises to us he's
[1:38:39] fulfilled promises but we get in a
[1:38:40] difficult situation and we begin to
[1:38:42] doubt and misunderstand the fullness of
[1:38:44] the promise
[1:38:45] and in this particular example it
[1:38:46] created a terrible danger zone for
[1:38:48] abraham
[1:38:50] because when he when he leaves this
[1:38:51] we'll see this here in a moment when he
[1:38:53] leaves egypt he gets to a spot where now
[1:38:55] he's left the land of promise and now
[1:38:57] he's vulnerable
[1:38:59] and this is uh the the this is the
[1:39:01] lesson that we learned trust god trust
[1:39:03] his process
[1:39:05] trust him
[1:39:06] yield to that process brother brahma
[1:39:08] says in recognizing your day and its
[1:39:10] message isn't amazing he preaches
[1:39:12] recognizing your day and it's message
[1:39:13] and he keeps talking about the jews
[1:39:15] why because they're in that hosea
[1:39:16] there's a revelation to you
[1:39:18] your revelation for your day your
[1:39:19] message god never blesses israel outside
[1:39:22] the land right
[1:39:23] this brother madam abraham went outside
[1:39:25] the land and was condemned
[1:39:27] everyone that leaves the land is
[1:39:29] condemned
[1:39:30] god can only bless israel when she stays
[1:39:32] in her homeland and she's there now as a
[1:39:34] nation
[1:39:35] and the church is called she's just only
[1:39:37] waiting for the rapture the bride taken
[1:39:39] out the seals are open it's revealed to
[1:39:42] us
[1:39:43] and why did it open up to us a whole new
[1:39:45] land
[1:39:46] a whole new field stay in that land
[1:39:49] no matter how long this carries no how
[1:39:51] long it gets stay in that opening of the
[1:39:53] word
[1:39:54] we don't need to fret oh we got to go
[1:39:56] back to something else we need to
[1:39:57] conjure up the guests we need to figure
[1:39:58] this out when you get back to the way
[1:40:00] things used to be stay in the land
[1:40:03] that's where rapturing faith is there's
[1:40:05] a little bit of famine for emotional
[1:40:06] little famine for this little bit of
[1:40:08] famine for that people get all nervous
[1:40:10] and upset they want to run back to egypt
[1:40:13] oh my he says we're in this land the
[1:40:14] seals are open it's revealed to us this
[1:40:16] is the possession this is the promise
[1:40:18] and abraham left the land that had been
[1:40:19] revealed to him and went to another land
[1:40:21] where maybe there was a little bit more
[1:40:22] for the flesh
[1:40:24] instead of staying right there brother
[1:40:26] man says abraham was condemned outside
[1:40:27] the land
[1:40:29] so what comes up immediately in verse 11
[1:40:30] it came to pass when he's come near to
[1:40:32] enter into egypt
[1:40:34] he you can already see doubt starting to
[1:40:36] creep in notice what he says
[1:40:38] he said unto sarah his wife so this is
[1:40:40] his wife this is the one that
[1:40:42] conceivably no pun intended
[1:40:45] seeds are supposed to come from nations
[1:40:47] gonna come from sarah this his wife and
[1:40:50] this is what abraham says as they come
[1:40:51] down you can tell as he leaves the
[1:40:52] promised land his faith gets weaker
[1:40:55] behold now i know that thou art a fair
[1:40:56] woman to look upon
[1:40:58] therefore it shall come to pass and it
[1:41:00] is the power of the spoken word when the
[1:41:02] egyptians shall see thee they shall say
[1:41:03] this is his wife and they will kill me
[1:41:07] but they will save thee alive
[1:41:09] say i pray thee thou art my sister that
[1:41:13] it may be well with me for thy sake and
[1:41:15] my soul shall live because of thee
[1:41:18] what is it that stands out to you
[1:41:21] abraham's afraid of death
[1:41:24] he wasn't really even afraid of sarah
[1:41:25] being taken away from him he's just like
[1:41:26] they're going to kill me
[1:41:29] he said this is this man's wife and
[1:41:31] they're going to kill me he's afraid of
[1:41:32] death
[1:41:33] and because he's afraid of death it
[1:41:34] instigates a lie
[1:41:36] as soon as he left the promised land
[1:41:37] that had been opened up to him his faith
[1:41:39] gets a little weak and he starts fearing
[1:41:40] death
[1:41:42] then once he starts fearing death it's
[1:41:43] what instigates the lie
[1:41:44] and abraham's motivated he's acting out
[1:41:47] of the fear of death to leave the
[1:41:48] promised land famine is putting this
[1:41:50] onus of death over it's like oh no death
[1:41:53] it's this very ominous cloud is coming
[1:41:55] up he's looking around there's no rain
[1:41:56] there's no grain there's a drought
[1:41:58] people are dying they're starving i
[1:41:59] gotta leave and it was the threat of
[1:42:01] death that caused him to start to walk
[1:42:02] away as he begins to walk away his faith
[1:42:04] begins to get a little weak and now he's
[1:42:06] afraid that the egyptians are gonna kill
[1:42:08] him so it instigates a lie and he
[1:42:09] encourages his wife to lie to what spare
[1:42:12] his
[1:42:12] life what does he resort to his own
[1:42:15] wisdom
[1:42:16] death is death is certain honey so let's
[1:42:18] figure out a way out of this his own
[1:42:20] wisdom his own approach and he's put in
[1:42:22] this position because he leaves the land
[1:42:25] so abraham
[1:42:27] in genesis 12 after god has shown him
[1:42:28] the land and reaffirmed his promise and
[1:42:30] has appeared to him and he's worshiping
[1:42:32] he's a believer
[1:42:33] he begins to leave he leaves the land
[1:42:35] because he's afraid of death and having
[1:42:37] laid the left the land it's death that
[1:42:39] motivates him to lie to save his life
[1:42:44] and we know that he does
[1:42:46] he's spared
[1:42:48] and there's a lot that happens in
[1:42:49] abraham's life over the nearly next 25
[1:42:51] years
[1:42:52] after 25 years after this
[1:42:55] we know in genesis chapter 13 god
[1:42:56] appears confirming the covenant
[1:42:58] he begins to unfold it in more detail
[1:43:00] it's just progressive read it and notice
[1:43:01] how it
[1:43:02] it
[1:43:03] more and more it says he went up out of
[1:43:05] egypt and he came to bethel again and
[1:43:07] and they're separating from lot you're
[1:43:09] so it just unfolds once he separates
[1:43:11] from lot god can unfold the vision in
[1:43:13] more detail
[1:43:14] then in genesis 14 he rescues lot
[1:43:17] meets melchizedek genesis 15 the lord
[1:43:20] appears to him in his vision i am thy my
[1:43:22] shield and i exceeding great reward
[1:43:24] genesis 15 1 after these things the word
[1:43:26] of the lord came unto abram in a vision
[1:43:27] saying fear not
[1:43:29] why did he say fear not abraham because
[1:43:30] he'd been a weakness
[1:43:32] famine caused him to be afraid he's
[1:43:34] leaving the beauty of his wife caused
[1:43:36] him to be afraid of death so he says
[1:43:38] fear not abram i am thy shield i am thy
[1:43:40] protector i'm the one that will keep you
[1:43:43] i am by exceeding great reward i am your
[1:43:45] defender i am your cover i am your
[1:43:47] reward i am your life i am your
[1:43:49] preserver don't worry about economies
[1:43:51] don't worry about pandemics don't worry
[1:43:53] about stocks and bonds and don't worry
[1:43:55] about savings don't worry about health
[1:43:57] trust in me
[1:44:00] he speaks this to him he says i trust in
[1:44:02] me
[1:44:03] and then abraham's response is what can
[1:44:06] you give me when i have no children
[1:44:10] what no wonder he says is anything too
[1:44:12] hard for the lord later
[1:44:14] he suggested he said well what can you
[1:44:16] give me when i have no children and what
[1:44:17] does he do in that moment because he's
[1:44:19] not fully catching the revelation he he
[1:44:22] suggests his servant seed he suggests an
[1:44:26] heir born to his servant not even from
[1:44:27] himself he suggests that well i have
[1:44:30] this servant who's had a son lord could
[1:44:32] he be the one then could you just make
[1:44:34] him the seed could you give all the
[1:44:35] promises you've promised me and my seed
[1:44:37] and could you somehow allow it to become
[1:44:39] his
[1:44:41] and the lord replies in verse 14
[1:44:43] behold the word of the lord came unto
[1:44:44] him saying this shall not be thiner
[1:44:47] but he that shall come forth out of thy
[1:44:49] own bowel shall be thine air
[1:44:52] and notice what he does god doesn't
[1:44:53] rebuke himself oh my goodness forget
[1:44:55] about it there's more chaldeans i can
[1:44:57] appear to he's going to stick with him
[1:45:00] you know what he's wanting to give it to
[1:45:01] his slave i want to give it to a son of
[1:45:03] his servant no blood relation at all he
[1:45:06] says no abraham let me help you
[1:45:08] understand this even better if this
[1:45:09] wasn't clear to begin with let me reveal
[1:45:11] this to you in greater detail no it's
[1:45:14] not somebody else that's going to be the
[1:45:15] heir but from your own person
[1:45:18] you're going to bring this forth
[1:45:20] and so he says come let me show you
[1:45:21] something bring it to verse 5. and he
[1:45:23] brought him forth abroad and said look
[1:45:25] now toward heaven
[1:45:27] and tell the stars if thou be able to
[1:45:28] number them
[1:45:29] and he said unto him so shall thy seed
[1:45:34] be
[1:45:34] amen one moment he's saying lord you're
[1:45:37] my reward you're my shield god's
[1:45:38] revealed himself in this vision and
[1:45:40] abraham and his vulnerability and his
[1:45:41] fears saying but what does it all mean
[1:45:44] if i don't have an heir
[1:45:46] maybe it could be my servant's heir and
[1:45:49] he says hold on hold on no you from your
[1:45:51] own seed are going to bring forth the
[1:45:53] sun and let me show you what this is
[1:45:54] going to become look at these
[1:45:56] stars it says he believed in the lord
[1:46:01] he believed him
[1:46:02] he's married to a woman that can't have
[1:46:04] kids has no children of his own has just
[1:46:06] suggested his servant servant son and he
[1:46:09] believed he looked at the stars and he
[1:46:10] believed
[1:46:13] the stars that cannot be numbered
[1:46:14] there's no light pollution they need to
[1:46:16] worry about
[1:46:17] right and he looks up in the star they
[1:46:19] must have just been so thick like a
[1:46:20] blanket he says that's how your seed's
[1:46:22] going to be and abraham abraham says i
[1:46:24] believe you amen
[1:46:26] and somebody nearby is like
[1:46:29] what kind of joke is this
[1:46:32] verse chapter 17 genesis 17 god appears
[1:46:34] to him again what does he do he
[1:46:36] reaffirms the covenant further unfolds
[1:46:38] the promise to abraham changes his name
[1:46:41] and he specifies then in this instance
[1:46:43] that it's sarah who's going to bear a
[1:46:45] son and his name will be isaac
[1:46:47] you know what he's doing he's further
[1:46:49] unfolding it abraham is going to be
[1:46:50] yours and then this is i'm not not
[1:46:52] getting into this part but you want to
[1:46:53] relate to abraham abraham has marital
[1:46:55] issues right there's a little bit of
[1:46:56] strife between him and sarah and sarah's
[1:46:58] like well why don't you you're just a
[1:47:00] little bit of strife in the home and
[1:47:01] abraham i don't know he's putting
[1:47:02] pressure on her you got to have a baby
[1:47:04] so you gotta have a baby she's like you
[1:47:05] know why don't you just use my servant
[1:47:06] why don't you just have a child since he
[1:47:08] said it's through you and he's like okay
[1:47:10] and then he has a son and i don't know
[1:47:11] if we're going to get into this as we
[1:47:13] look into this but abraham comes to a
[1:47:15] place he says all that ishmael would
[1:47:17] live before you just as he said his
[1:47:19] servant son would he lived before you
[1:47:21] now the servant of the bondwoman let him
[1:47:23] live before you let him be the one
[1:47:25] through which the nations come and the
[1:47:26] revelation gets even clearer no it's not
[1:47:29] just your seed through someone it's your
[1:47:31] seed through your wife sarah
[1:47:34] and his he's got i have his name his
[1:47:35] name's going to be isaac
[1:47:38] so in genesis 18 god visits him veils
[1:47:40] himself in flesh and visits abraham
[1:47:42] confirms the promise again
[1:47:45] and vows to return
[1:47:48] so now are you kind of with me it's 11
[1:47:52] 45.
[1:47:54] that's not that's nothing is it but the
[1:47:56] member said the bride could sit hour
[1:47:57] after hour so this is the point where i
[1:47:59] i'm announcing we're in the after hour
[1:48:03] and and there's
[1:48:05] let's just read genesis chapter 20 i
[1:48:07] want to read to verse i don't know maybe
[1:48:09] maybe verse 18 get to at least verse 12.
[1:48:12] let's just read through this
[1:48:13] think about everything god has revealed
[1:48:15] to abraham now
[1:48:16] kind of kind of an idea of what his
[1:48:17] weaknesses were
[1:48:19] he says and abraham journeyed from fence
[1:48:20] toward the south country and dwelled
[1:48:22] between kadesh and sure
[1:48:24] and so journey gerard
[1:48:26] and abraham said unto his wife
[1:48:29] she is my sister
[1:48:31] said of his wife
[1:48:33] she is my sister wait a minute are we
[1:48:35] back in chapter 12 again
[1:48:37] i think it is over 25 years later he
[1:48:40] says she is my sister and abimelech king
[1:48:42] of guerrero sent and took sarah but god
[1:48:45] came to abimelech in a dream by night
[1:48:46] and said behold thou art a dead man for
[1:48:48] a woman who has taken is another man's
[1:48:50] wife
[1:48:51] and in verse seven he says you go to
[1:48:53] that man who just lied to you give him
[1:48:54] his wife back he's a prophet so have him
[1:48:57] pray for you so you can live
[1:49:01] that's powerful and if you don't restore
[1:49:03] then you're going to die
[1:49:05] so once again death is even coming into
[1:49:07] view
[1:49:09] and then abimelech's like man
[1:49:11] why'd you do this to me i said hey do
[1:49:14] you know that girl over there yeah
[1:49:15] that's my sister you want me to give you
[1:49:16] a number four he's like yeah
[1:49:17] yeah i do
[1:49:19] totally
[1:49:20] and he's and he lies he's like why'd you
[1:49:22] do this to me all you had to do is say
[1:49:23] that's your wife
[1:49:24] but notice abraham's response after
[1:49:26] believe it's like what have you done to
[1:49:28] me what kind of deed have you done
[1:49:29] abraham says in verse 11 get there so he
[1:49:31] could see this
[1:49:33] because i thought surely the fear of god
[1:49:35] is not in this place and they will slay
[1:49:37] me for my wife's sake
[1:49:40] abraham is still afraid to die
[1:49:44] he's still afraid to death after
[1:49:46] everything god has said abraham it's not
[1:49:49] going to be your servant son it's not
[1:49:50] going to be hagar son it's not going to
[1:49:52] be it's going to be your seed through
[1:49:54] sarah abraham knew when he came into
[1:49:57] under the presence of abimelech that if
[1:49:59] god killed him he'd have to raise him up
[1:50:02] and sarah also because he was going to
[1:50:04] have to have a son by sarah
[1:50:07] but his actions betray his doubt
[1:50:10] so he said yet indeed she i said she is
[1:50:12] my sister or then i'll notice how he
[1:50:14] kind of covers it up but yet indeed she
[1:50:15] is my sister and she is the daughter of
[1:50:17] my father but not the daughter of my
[1:50:19] mother and she became my wife
[1:50:21] maybe a little technicality there i mean
[1:50:24] i didn't really lie did i said that i
[1:50:26] mean she is indeed my sister she's the
[1:50:28] daughter of my father but not the
[1:50:29] daughter of my mother
[1:50:30] and i married her
[1:50:33] but it was because of fear abraham is
[1:50:34] still afraid of death
[1:50:37] and because he's still afraid of death
[1:50:38] his actions
[1:50:40] don't line up with the promise
[1:50:42] abraham i'm going to give you son i'm
[1:50:44] going to give you a son named isaac he
[1:50:46] comes into a situation and all of a
[1:50:47] sudden he's afraid he's going to die
[1:50:49] all he had to do is say sarah do we have
[1:50:50] a son named isaac yet no honey we don't
[1:50:52] okay all right
[1:50:55] i'm not afraid what man can do unto me
[1:50:57] i'm not afraid of what abimelech can say
[1:50:58] or what he can do
[1:51:00] but his actions testify that he hadn't
[1:51:02] fully
[1:51:04] absorbed the reality of the promise
[1:51:06] brother brown in the sermon christ
[1:51:08] revealed in his own word he says abraham
[1:51:09] for instance he called the father of the
[1:51:11] faithful
[1:51:12] do you think abraham would have wrote
[1:51:14] the book of himself on himself
[1:51:16] of his own cowardliness
[1:51:19] how do you think he would have wrote
[1:51:20] that he lied to the king that morning
[1:51:22] and that said that was his sister when
[1:51:24] it was his wife would it right of his
[1:51:26] cowardly deeds that he did surely he had
[1:51:28] never done that
[1:51:31] god is preserving abraham brother man's
[1:51:33] his cowardly deeds his lies
[1:51:36] and the bible preserves them
[1:51:38] he says abraham wouldn't have wrote
[1:51:39] about that
[1:51:41] i mean abraham said god spoke to me and
[1:51:43] i believed him and that was perfect
[1:51:45] faith
[1:51:46] i was a perfect christian and i
[1:51:48] conquered kings and i brought forth
[1:51:50] kings and i mean abraham would have told
[1:51:52] the story a little bit different
[1:51:55] and what is it signified
[1:51:57] though abraham believed it says he
[1:51:58] believed the lord and believe believe in
[1:52:00] god he counted it to him for
[1:52:01] righteousness so genesis 15 says
[1:52:05] he believed he was a believer god kept
[1:52:07] revealing himself to his seed kept
[1:52:09] revealing himself to abraham by election
[1:52:11] he wasn't going to give up on him it's
[1:52:12] the unconditional covenant
[1:52:15] adam with noah conditional covenant but
[1:52:17] now with abraham he starts on an
[1:52:19] unconditional covenant and then god says
[1:52:22] leave it to me now
[1:52:24] i will take it from here and no matter
[1:52:27] if you get weak no matter if you doubt
[1:52:28] no matter if you're a coward no matter
[1:52:30] if you lie even if against the in the
[1:52:32] face of the promise you're afraid of
[1:52:34] death i'm going to keep coming to you
[1:52:36] and coming to you and coming to you and
[1:52:38] revealing myself to you when you run
[1:52:40] after your servants turning plowshares
[1:52:42] into into swords and you run after them
[1:52:45] with man-made spears and you do battle
[1:52:47] with armies and kings i'll allow them to
[1:52:50] conquer because i've got to preserve
[1:52:51] your life
[1:52:53] i'm going to keep you alive and no
[1:52:55] matter where you go and what you do i
[1:52:57] made the promise i will keep you i will
[1:53:00] see you through even when you're a
[1:53:02] coward even when you're weak
[1:53:06] he believed abraham believed but it
[1:53:09] testifies there was a deeper
[1:53:10] understanding
[1:53:13] the full revelation of the promise would
[1:53:14] have pointed to a power to preserve life
[1:53:18] because he was going to have a son isaac
[1:53:20] it's just like paul when the ship was
[1:53:22] going to wreck
[1:53:23] he's like well i don't know how but i
[1:53:26] got to be there
[1:53:27] i got to go to rome
[1:53:29] he told me i was going to go i got to
[1:53:31] get there somehow did not paul say that
[1:53:33] in in leicester they were pressed beyond
[1:53:35] measure even were they despaired of life
[1:53:37] and they trusted in a god who what
[1:53:39] who would raise the dead
[1:53:41] paul came to a place in his own ministry
[1:53:43] where he knew god had made a promise
[1:53:45] this needs to be done but he was so
[1:53:47] certain in that moment he was going to
[1:53:48] die
[1:53:49] he's like this is it i'm going to die
[1:53:51] but he didn't despair he's just like wow
[1:53:54] god's just going to have to raise me
[1:53:55] from the dead
[1:53:56] that's what he did that's what the bible
[1:53:57] tells us he did he said so we just
[1:53:59] trusted in a god not in ourselves but a
[1:54:00] god who could raise the dead we're going
[1:54:02] to be killed we're going to be dumped in
[1:54:03] a ditch life is going to leave and god's
[1:54:04] going to come by and raise us right back
[1:54:06] up because i've got to fulfill what he
[1:54:07] said i was going to fulfill that's a
[1:54:08] revelation to the promise
[1:54:12] it says in genesis 15 6 i think we read
[1:54:14] it a moment ago and he believed in the
[1:54:15] lord
[1:54:16] and he counted it to him for
[1:54:17] righteousness but there's still a
[1:54:19] greater potential
[1:54:21] potential penetration
[1:54:22] of that revelation
[1:54:24] a greater unfolding a manifestation
[1:54:28] this is i believe where we can relate
[1:54:31] our faith justifies us
[1:54:33] our faith makes us righteous
[1:54:35] that's right where the bible says we're
[1:54:37] justified by faith and we're of the
[1:54:39] faith of abraham our faith in the word
[1:54:41] justifies us it makes us righteous but
[1:54:43] yet we can still be weak in our minds
[1:54:45] amen we can still believe but be
[1:54:47] oppressed by certain things and cause us
[1:54:50] to despair cause us to doubt there's
[1:54:52] times i'll just be i'll be the one that
[1:54:54] testifies there's times when my life has
[1:54:55] not lined up with my revelation
[1:54:58] and i've looked back and realized man
[1:55:00] how could i live such a defeated life
[1:55:02] and how can i be so negative and how can
[1:55:04] i get anxious and how can i despair and
[1:55:05] how can i worry when god made me these
[1:55:07] promises and the devil just tries to
[1:55:09] work in our minds that you can lose
[1:55:10] god's love and you can offend him for
[1:55:12] the last time and what's he doing he's
[1:55:14] trying to take everything god has told
[1:55:15] you and say just forget everything he's
[1:55:17] ever promised and believe my
[1:55:19] interpretation to you and believe my
[1:55:21] lies to you and god says wait a minute i
[1:55:23] called you by election and told you i
[1:55:25] would show you this and i showed you and
[1:55:27] i told you i would do this and i did it
[1:55:29] and you look back on your life as an
[1:55:30] abraham and you're like wait a minute
[1:55:32] wait a minute wait a minute wait a
[1:55:33] minute he's proven his love for me time
[1:55:36] and time and time again
[1:55:38] look at where look at some of you who
[1:55:39] are here today
[1:55:42] look where you are today did you ever
[1:55:43] think you'd still be here do you think
[1:55:45] you'd still be persevering did you ever
[1:55:48] think that this work would continue why
[1:55:50] has it happened god is faithful
[1:55:54] in your own lives and your own
[1:55:56] testimonies brother joshua i just we
[1:55:58] haven't even met yet
[1:56:00] he googled for my phone number and found
[1:56:03] some random phone number online and
[1:56:05] texted and he actually text our home
[1:56:07] phone number that elliot had in his
[1:56:08] possession he's like dad someone's
[1:56:10] asking for your phone number or asking
[1:56:12] if this is who you are and you look at
[1:56:14] just a little bit of your testimony you
[1:56:15] shared with me look at the grace of god
[1:56:18] that's the life of abraham
[1:56:20] we might want to look back say oh what
[1:56:21] about this and you did this and you did
[1:56:23] that and you failed this and you felt
[1:56:24] that no that may be my testimony but his
[1:56:28] testimony is faithful his testimony is
[1:56:31] true he never gave up he never gave up
[1:56:34] on me
[1:56:35] [Applause]
[1:56:38] and we might not conduct ourselves even
[1:56:40] according to the word that's been
[1:56:41] revealed to us but god says i'm not done
[1:56:42] with you yet aaron
[1:56:44] not done with you yet sin the light i'm
[1:56:46] not done with you yet brother i'm not
[1:56:47] done with you sister
[1:56:50] so in genesis chapter 22 i'm closing in
[1:56:52] this
[1:56:55] it comes in verse
[1:56:56] chapter 22 2 verse 8
[1:56:59] when isaac says dad
[1:57:02] dad what's going to happen
[1:57:04] you got the wood
[1:57:06] you're going to build an altar
[1:57:08] but isaac had seen enough in his dad's
[1:57:09] life to know there had to be a sacrifice
[1:57:13] he says daddy what are we gonna
[1:57:15] what are you gonna offer
[1:57:17] he says my son god will
[1:57:19] provide himself a lamb for burnt
[1:57:21] offering
[1:57:23] this isn't just a hope so
[1:57:25] this is not just well i'm sure i sure
[1:57:27] hope this happens he says and they both
[1:57:30] went up on together they both of them
[1:57:32] together
[1:57:34] and they came to the place which god had
[1:57:35] told them of this is notice this regular
[1:57:38] routine
[1:57:40] came to the place he says he knew he had
[1:57:41] to come right where god told him to go
[1:57:44] and when he came there abraham built an
[1:57:45] altar
[1:57:47] laid the wood in order
[1:57:49] bound isaac kissed son and laid him on
[1:57:51] the altar upon the wood
[1:57:54] and abraham stretched forth his hand and
[1:57:56] took the knife to slay his son amen
[1:57:58] he's no longer afraid of death
[1:58:01] just in prior chapter just in chapter 20
[1:58:04] he lied to avoid death
[1:58:06] chapter 12 he lies to avoid death
[1:58:08] abraham has demonstrated this fear but
[1:58:11] in this moment when he raised back that
[1:58:13] knife he was no longer afraid of death
[1:58:16] but he believed in the promise
[1:58:18] he believed what god had said and in
[1:58:19] that moment the the promise and the
[1:58:22] revelation
[1:58:24] imposes itself it's the word i like to
[1:58:26] use in this moment it's it just imposes
[1:58:29] itself so much upon abraham
[1:58:31] that it transforms his actions
[1:58:35] transforms his reality how could a man
[1:58:37] who looked forward to this son for so
[1:58:39] long suffered so much because of the son
[1:58:41] for so long believed in these promises
[1:58:43] for so long was an outcast was uh was
[1:58:46] castigated and made fun of because he's
[1:58:48] believing oh the father of many nations
[1:58:50] hi abraham is this really going to
[1:58:51] happen and he comes this moment where
[1:58:53] all his vindication
[1:58:54] all his testimony everything he believed
[1:58:57] he's being asked to sacrifice and in
[1:58:59] that moment it would all be gone and
[1:59:00] he'd come back down that hill and have
[1:59:02] to face his wife and says where's isaac
[1:59:04] he said i killed him on that mountain
[1:59:07] and and the revelation imposes itself so
[1:59:09] greatly upon abraham he raises back that
[1:59:12] knife
[1:59:13] not not believing that isaac would
[1:59:14] forever be dead but believing in a god
[1:59:16] that raises the dead
[1:59:19] in hebrews 11 19 according that god was
[1:59:21] able this is what he says according that
[1:59:23] god was able to raise him up even from
[1:59:26] the dead
[1:59:28] from whence he also received him in a
[1:59:30] figure
[1:59:31] finally abraham's actions are in harmony
[1:59:34] with the revelation of god's promise
[1:59:37] finally it's in it's in line with the
[1:59:39] truth of what god had told him that the
[1:59:41] eternal nature of the promise
[1:59:43] this is the this is the manifestation of
[1:59:45] how abraham's faith had matured
[1:59:48] these instances in his life where he
[1:59:49] demonstrated this weakness and this fear
[1:59:51] fear of famine fear of death fear of
[1:59:52] death all these different fears maybe
[1:59:54] let it be my servant son let it be
[1:59:56] ishmael all these different things but
[1:59:58] now he has a more perfect understanding
[2:00:00] and how did how did it happen by god
[2:00:02] just revealing himself
[2:00:04] god appearing god confirming god
[2:00:06] fulfilling his promise to him
[2:00:08] it was the results of a regular routine
[2:00:10] of following revelation in the plans of
[2:00:11] god for his life i love that and what
[2:00:13] pretty what it produced
[2:00:15] is a fully awake trust
[2:00:19] in the face of being asked to do
[2:00:21] something that we'd say is irrational
[2:00:25] there's different things that we could
[2:00:26] share
[2:00:27] other scriptures
[2:00:29] that maybe would be very appropriate
[2:00:30] here to where to to use but
[2:00:33] let me just say the manifestation of the
[2:00:35] promise is what made the difference for
[2:00:36] abraham
[2:00:38] and that's why it's so important to see
[2:00:39] the promised word for this day
[2:00:43] and as abraham was walking in the
[2:00:44] present
[2:00:45] the presence of god in his day in his
[2:00:47] time according to his promise
[2:00:49] it was that walking with god that
[2:00:50] matured his faith
[2:00:52] he didn't have it in chapter 12.
[2:00:55] he didn't have it in 15.
[2:00:57] he said well how can you bless me when i
[2:00:58] don't have kids he didn't have it even
[2:01:00] in ch after chapter 17 and 18 he didn't
[2:01:02] have it in chapter 20
[2:01:04] but he did in chapter 22.
[2:01:07] even even abraham's actions after death
[2:01:10] testified of a resurrection because he
[2:01:11] wanted to be sure that he was buried in
[2:01:13] the place where the resurrection would
[2:01:14] be
[2:01:15] even in death and he purchased a plot
[2:01:18] for sarah and he buried her there and he
[2:01:20] wanted him to be buried there and then
[2:01:22] isaac is buried there and the bones of
[2:01:23] jake why because that's where the
[2:01:25] resurrection would be even in his death
[2:01:27] abraham couldn't stop testifying of life
[2:01:29] amen
[2:01:31] it was just by walking with god that
[2:01:32] matured him to a place where he was no
[2:01:33] longer afraid of death
[2:01:35] he could believe in life
[2:01:37] through all his crises
[2:01:39] his ups and downs his doubting just the
[2:01:42] detours
[2:01:44] somehow through it all his faith grew
[2:01:45] stronger
[2:01:47] and the bible says in romans 4 19 to 21
[2:01:50] and being not weak in faith
[2:01:52] i think it's wonderful to know that god
[2:01:54] doesn't see our faith as weak yes
[2:01:57] he considered not his own body now dead
[2:02:01] when he was about 100 years old
[2:02:03] neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb
[2:02:06] he staggered not
[2:02:08] at the promise of god through unbelief
[2:02:11] he never staggered at the promise of god
[2:02:13] through unbelief
[2:02:14] but was strong in faith think about what
[2:02:16] we've already read strong in faith
[2:02:18] giving glory to god
[2:02:20] and being fully persuaded that what he
[2:02:22] had promised he was able to perform
[2:02:26] the bible says not being weak in faith
[2:02:28] the weak in the flesh his faith
[2:02:30] ultimately prevailed
[2:02:33] and even in that
[2:02:34] moment where god in genesis 22 where god
[2:02:36] asked him to sacrifice his son under the
[2:02:38] strain
[2:02:39] of the final crisis
[2:02:42] he didn't wake up that day and god speak
[2:02:44] to him and say it's enough lord i can't
[2:02:45] do this anymore
[2:02:47] you tell you promised me this and i'm a
[2:02:49] stranger you promised you that the
[2:02:50] famine comes you promise me this and
[2:02:51] this happens and i finally separate from
[2:02:53] lot only for him to get taken away and i
[2:02:55] finally do this and i find it and it
[2:02:57] doesn't he doesn't finally he doesn't
[2:02:59] break
[2:03:00] he doesn't give in
[2:03:02] but in that moment his faith rises above
[2:03:03] it
[2:03:06] and even in the birth of isaac even in
[2:03:08] isaac being born
[2:03:10] he didn't he refused to consider the
[2:03:12] physical impossibility of having a son
[2:03:16] and even in the sacrificing isaac he
[2:03:18] refused to consider
[2:03:21] the physical impossibilities that would
[2:03:22] make god's promise
[2:03:24] unrealistic
[2:03:27] but the bible says not being weak in
[2:03:28] faith he didn't consider his dead body
[2:03:30] didn't consider his wife's dead womb i
[2:03:32] even want you to think about how he
[2:03:34] stared death down in isaac
[2:03:36] he didn't consider all his disabilities
[2:03:38] he didn't consider the circumstances but
[2:03:40] he actually stared him down
[2:03:42] staggered not he wasn't afraid he didn't
[2:03:44] flinch staggered not but he stared him
[2:03:46] down
[2:03:49] he considered as he looked at him he
[2:03:51] considered how strong they were abraham
[2:03:53] you're dead your wife's never been able
[2:03:55] to have a child he stared him down and
[2:03:57] he looked at him he absorbed him he saw
[2:03:59] the reality of he didn't just stick his
[2:04:01] head in the sand well they're not real
[2:04:02] they're not real he saw what they were
[2:04:04] and he saw what they what they
[2:04:05] represented he saw what it meant and he
[2:04:07] looked at that and then he looked at the
[2:04:08] promise
[2:04:10] and he weighed the promise against his
[2:04:12] flesh
[2:04:13] he weighed the promise against sarah's
[2:04:14] flesh he weighed the promise against the
[2:04:16] death of isaac and he confidently
[2:04:18] decided the word of god was right amen
[2:04:21] and he declared god's word will stand
[2:04:24] yes
[2:04:26] and i say this is just what you can
[2:04:28] relate to
[2:04:30] i trust you can relate to this whatever
[2:04:31] our present weaknesses
[2:04:33] whatever we're current currently going
[2:04:35] through whatever temptations our faith
[2:04:37] is greater amen
[2:04:40] don't look at your own weaknesses
[2:04:43] don't
[2:04:44] don't even look at your past that's
[2:04:46] right abraham didn't
[2:04:48] abraham could have been walking up that
[2:04:49] mountain
[2:04:51] and who knows the devil could have been
[2:04:53] right there saying you've always been
[2:04:54] afraid of death
[2:04:56] always been afraid of death
[2:04:58] you you you offered up your servant son
[2:05:00] you offered up your ishmael
[2:05:03] you lied to the kings twice you did the
[2:05:04] same thing twice 25 years later hadn't
[2:05:06] you learned your lesson you've never
[2:05:08] you've you've always been afraid of
[2:05:10] death and he could have just looked at
[2:05:11] his past
[2:05:13] but he didn't thank you
[2:05:15] and neither should we
[2:05:18] and james 1 12 says blessed is the man
[2:05:19] that endureth temptation
[2:05:21] remains steadfast into trial
[2:05:24] perseveres when tempted
[2:05:27] for when he has tried he shall receive
[2:05:28] the crown of life
[2:05:30] which the lord hath promised to them
[2:05:33] that love him
[2:05:35] that was abraham's blessing
[2:05:37] his testimony was crowned
[2:05:39] and this is
[2:05:40] this is what he wants to do
[2:05:44] give you continual life-giving
[2:05:47] prevailing revelation
[2:05:48] because that's exactly what he did for
[2:05:50] abraham
[2:05:51] no matter what he was going through what
[2:05:53] he experienced it was that continual
[2:05:55] life-giving prevailing revelation that
[2:05:58] gave the
[2:05:59] that was the wind to his
[2:06:00] faith that's what kept lifting him up
[2:06:03] despite his weaknesses despite his
[2:06:05] doubts despite his trials his faith is
[2:06:07] so relatable to us because god has
[2:06:09] preserved for us
[2:06:11] his journey
[2:06:12] from election
[2:06:14] to supreme faith
[2:06:16] and i believe that he's with us saints
[2:06:18] and he wants to raise us to that place
[2:06:20] on our own mount moriah
[2:06:22] to believe the promise let's stand
[2:06:26] thank you for your patience today
[2:06:34] bless is the man that endureth
[2:06:36] temptation
[2:06:39] makes it through the trials
[2:06:43] that's our prayer that god would
[2:06:44] continue to give us
[2:06:47] by spirit to give us continuous
[2:06:50] life-giving
[2:06:52] and prevailing
[2:06:53] revelation i'd like to sing that song
[2:06:57] the winds of faith
[2:06:59] we could just bow our heads in a word of
[2:07:01] prayer
[2:07:11] if you need prayer today
[2:07:13] and you just want the lord to
[2:07:16] increase your courage you just want to
[2:07:18] raise your hand say lord help my faith
[2:07:21] i relate to abraham today i feel the
[2:07:23] pressures i feel the trials coming on i
[2:07:26] see how much i've doubted you and
[2:07:28] how my own actions don't always line up
[2:07:30] with my revelation
[2:07:32] but lord just keep appearing to me like
[2:07:34] you did abraham
[2:07:37] lord i know you won't give up on me and
[2:07:40] i'm sorry lord forgive me for my
[2:07:41] unbelief
[2:07:43] help me today like you did abraham would
[2:07:45] you appear to me again and encourage me
[2:07:48] lord could you tell me again what the
[2:07:49] promise was
[2:07:51] lord could you like you did abraham just
[2:07:53] take it a step further and tell me more
[2:07:56] let me see it
[2:07:58] our gracious heavenly fathers we're
[2:07:59] standing in your presence today lord
[2:08:02] we've had ups and downs we've had trials
[2:08:06] but lord we're enduring
[2:08:09] and we believe there's going to be a
[2:08:10] crown of life that you're going to give
[2:08:12] us
[2:08:13] and lord i want to be those that endured
[2:08:15] to the end
[2:08:17] lord i believe that i'm standing the day
[2:08:19] in the hour when rapturing faith has
[2:08:21] been given to the elect
[2:08:24] and lord it's a time when the faith of
[2:08:26] abraham is being demonstrated again
[2:08:30] and i ask lord that you can help us
[2:08:32] today through our weaknesses through our
[2:08:34] struggles our physical ailments
[2:08:37] may we not consider the weakness of our
[2:08:39] body may we not consider the sicknesses
[2:08:42] in our bodies may we not consider the
[2:08:43] debility debilitating depression or
[2:08:46] anxiety in our spirits lord
[2:08:49] but maybe look at the promise lord may
[2:08:51] stare down whatever our trials are

[2:09:03] know my past i know what i've been
[2:09:04] through but then look to the promise
[2:09:06] and say your word is enough
[2:09:09] your word is enough lord i know i'm not
[2:09:11] able and just as abraham came to the top
[2:09:13] of mount moriah to a place where lord
[2:09:15] you've asked me you've asked the
[2:09:17] impossible
[2:09:18] i'm done on my own i won't try any
[2:09:21] longer lord i yield to the supreme
[2:09:23] i yield to the divine take over from
[2:09:26] here
[2:09:28] lord may there even be births that take
[2:09:29] place today from those who finally give
[2:09:32] up on their own and are willing to
[2:09:34] receive your holy spirit lord those of
[2:09:36] us who've been in this pattern of
[2:09:38] abraham lord we're in the late hours

[2:10:40] winds of faith

[2:11:14] one by side
[2:11:17] one by faith
[2:11:21] and take the word of god

[2:11:28] what you believe
[2:11:31] is what will be
[2:11:35] oh set your wings
[2:11:38] to the winds of faith
[2:11:41] [Music]
[2:11:42] you can fly

[2:11:49] oh do not struggle
[2:11:53] it's by grace
[2:11:57] set your ways
[2:12:01] i want to sing that third verse it says
[2:12:02] watch the eagle in the sky i want you to
[2:12:04] think about abraham
[2:12:06] the power
[2:12:08] that he needed
[2:12:10] on mount moriah was given to him the
[2:12:12] moment god called him
[2:12:14] in babylon hallelujah why because it was
[2:12:17] in the promise
[2:12:18] the promise was you're going to have a
[2:12:20] son
[2:12:22] promises again nations are going to come
[2:12:23] from thee and god the the process was
[2:12:26] god amplifying and magnifying the word
[2:12:29] that had been given becoming richer
[2:12:31] becoming deeper
[2:12:33] even as brother brown talks about the
[2:12:34] spirit it's the same spirit that's been
[2:12:36] in the church ages just more of it more
[2:12:38] power
[2:12:39] it is coming clear and clear and clear
[2:12:41] to culminate in a rapture of the whole
[2:12:44] body a resurrection of those who've gone
[2:12:46] before it was already in the promise so
[2:12:48] the revelation abraham came to on mount
[2:12:51] moriah it wasn't a new message
[2:12:53] it was just the full understanding of
[2:12:54] the message that he'd given in the
[2:12:55] beginning
[2:12:56] and he could say yes that's it this is
[2:12:58] in this moment i can trust him i can
[2:13:00] fully believe him because the power was
[2:13:01] already in the word that he'd received
[2:13:03] he says watch the eagle
[2:13:07] in the sky
[2:13:10] he does not struggle
[2:13:14] he does not strive
[2:13:18] for the power
[2:13:21] that makes him
[2:13:24] rise is already
[2:13:29] in the sky
[2:13:31] oh set your wings
[2:13:35] to the winds of faith
[2:13:39] you can fly
[2:13:42] in a higher place

[2:13:52] grace set your wings
