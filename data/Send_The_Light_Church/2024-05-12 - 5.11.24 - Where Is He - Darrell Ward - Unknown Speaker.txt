Rebecca said she was old and I was her young people's leaders I guess that makes me ancient I thought my goodness I don't know if I could even get out there or not appreciate you all coming up brother brother Paige where are you buddy hey God bless you good to see you appreciate you coming from Canada may the Lord richly bless you and certainly appreciate you remembering our our family in prayer uh my sister Judy she's motor sister she's diagnosed here a few months ago with saroma of the liver very rare form of liver cancer and uh she's just right now they've just gave her just a few days it's it's now metastasized to her brain and so she's in a hospice house and she's really not uh any really even able to communicate or carry on sentence and so uh I just appreciate you remembering in prayer you know my mama used to say I I know you're standing but my mom used to tell me years ago she'd say you know Daryl as long as there's breath There's Hope amen amen and that's a true statement but I told my mom I said you know mama that's true that's really true I said but you know we serve a god that even when there's no breath there's still hope amen Our God raises the dead amen I've I've seen him do it I know that he does it may the Lord bless you rich if you have your Bibles as even turn with us to the Book of Mark want to read to Mark chapter 4 starting at verse 35 we greet you in the name of the Lord just kind of an honor to be with you once again and I think it's the 203d anniversary of this church and it's so good to see that still going on still sending out the light and working in while it's day amen amen we'll work till Jesus comes that's right and then we'll close our Bibles and set at his table amen amen amen what a day that'll be so may the Lord bless you richly amen hallelujah I want to read now from Mark chapter 4 starting at verse 35 appreciate each one coming the Bible says this and the same day when Eden was come he said unto them let us pass over unto the other side and when they had sent away the multitude they took him even as he was in the ship and there were also with him other little ships and there arose a great storm of wind and the waves beat into the ship so that it was now full and he was in the hinder part of the ship asleep on a pillow and they awake him and said unto him Master carest thou not that we perish amen but he cares yes I'm so glad he cares am amen and he arose and rebuked the wind and said unto the sea peace be still and the wind ceased and there was a great calm amen and he said unto them why are you so fearful and how is it that you have no faith amen and they feared exceedingly saying one to another what manner of man is this that even the wind and the Sea obey him amen he's our God Amen Let Us bow our heads I want to speak to you for a few minutes this evening on where is he where is he Heavenly Father we are so glad to call you father amen and we thank you Lord for all that you've done for us amen and we commit this congregation Thy word and ourself into your hands amen For Your Glory in Jesus name thank you Lord and the Saints said amen amen God bless you you may be seated I want to call your attention back to verse 40 where he said and he said unto them why are ye so fearful and how is it that you have no faith amen so faith and fear really can't coexist that's right and as I was thinking about this scripture on fear and faith it reminded me of something that the prophet said brother B said I thought tonight that I would talk on faith for a little while just to build up on Christian faith he said I find out that one of the greatest hindrances that the church has got today is that they're scared to death amen and what are you scared about that's what I'm wondering if you just only realize who you are you don't know who you are and you don't know who that is sitting next to you you say yeah that's my neighbor I know him all right but you see he's a Son of God see that's right adopted by Jesus Christ into the family and that's a daughter of God sitting next to you amen and who are you if you're a Christian a Believer you're a son and daughter of God then what are you scared about there's no need of being scared as long as the devil can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then amen all he wants to do as long as he can keep you scared that's all he wants to do he's got you right then amen so then we understand that Amnesia of not knowing who you are feeds fear amen I lost my daddy a few year ago to Alzheimer's and Alzheimer's is a cruel disease it is because you lose them twice that's right you lose them before you ever lose them that's right amen and we the last little bit of my daddy's life we had to put him into a Alzheimer's home where they was able to take care of him and they were having a little party for the patients or the the residents of the home and so I go to be with my daddy and he wasn't able to walk at that time and we wrote put him out into a wheelchair and they were passing out little gifts and they said James Ward and my daddy never answered cuz he didn't know who he was amen and I said Daddy you better raise up here buddy they've got a present for you they got a gift for you it's got your name on it it belongs to you but he never answered because he didn't know who he was amen and you say why do you say that because I want you to understand that no matter how great the services are when he would come service after service and call your name through his word and no matter how great the Revelation would be and no matter how rich the anointing is if you don't recognize it's for you am it'll do you no good the gift that stands behind the pulpit that God that gift in that man's life the gift in brother John's life is not for himself it's for you amen and if you don't recognize that gift that God has placed among you it'll do you no good amen not knowing who you are feeds fear if you've been around an Alzheimer's patient sometimes they get violent because they don't understand what someone's trying to do for them and so they strike out because of fear because they don't know who they are so Amnesia feeds fear but realizing who you are produces Faith amen Jesus had perfect Faith because he knew who he was in the word you know I heard a story one time of a beggar that was laying in the street and an artist came by and he stopped and he said to the man he said can I paint you portrait I'll give you a few bucks if you allow me to paint your portrait and the bum lady in the gutter said sure So the man painted the portrait and when he got done he handed the bum some money and he started to leave and the beggar said can I see the painting if you painted me I would like to see what it looks like so the artist turns the portrait around and in this portrait is a man that's well dressed every hair is in place clean well shaven just just like a prince of a man and the beggar laid in the street he said who is that and the artist said That's you and he said that's me and the artist said well that's the way I see you and the beggar said if that's the man you see then that's the man I'll be and he raised up and straightened himself and walked down the road and oh I say tonight if we could see ourselves the way God sees us we see our weaknesses we see our fa come on somebody we see our failures and many times that's what the devil wants you to see but if you can see yourself the way God sees you because when God looks at us he sees us through the blood of the Lamb amen and our sacrifice was perfect there was no flaw in him oh glory to God hallelujah oh see yourself tonight the way the word sees you he said you're sinless the perfect Hallelujah bride of Jesus Christ perfect love cast out all fear and love and faith is the same thing see love perfect love cast out all fear which gives you Faith then let us come tonight with this revelation of who we are we are not a cult though they try to make us one we are not an organization we are not a denomination right we are his body represented on the earth tonight B of his bone flesh of his flesh Spirit of his Spirit life of his life amen then let our faith in him cast out off all fear amen now we open our scriptures we find that Jesus is telling his disciples to get into the boat and let us pass over to the other side now where are they going to the other side why he said so amen he amen that's right amen that's right now the reason they're making this journey across the water is because on the other side is gadera and there is a man who's living among the tombs who's known as the maniac of gadera amen amen there's a bunch of them in Michigan and he's crying out for help yes he was wanting Deliverance oh my amen so Jesus got into the ship and he crossed the stormy sea that night for the call of one needy Soul amen you see it don't take a church full amen it don't take a well if there's a 100 I'll show up tonight that's not what he said what two or three are gathered in my name I will be in their midst so let tonight one sincere soul in this building can call him on the scene tonight amen he crossed all the way over into gadera to give Mercy to one man and I say tonight if there's only one in this building who gets Mercy tonight God let it be me when my daughter was was injured in the accident two of my family was killed and was hit by the train many of has seen the video and when she came home from the hospital we invited brother Billy Paul brother brenham's son down to the church for her homecoming and when the service was over and we were outside and Jessica was just threey old so I had her up in my arms and I I asked brother Billy I said brother Billy would you pray for Jessica and I just handed her to him and he took her up in his arms and he prayed for my daughter and he handed her back to me and he said this to brother Paul and it's always stayed with me he said brother Daryl daddy said in every meeting there's always one great miracle takes place he said this weekend that Miracle is your daughter amen but I thought so many times if there's only one Miracle takes place in this building tonight let it be me Lord you are to come with that attitude if you is the only one in need Hallelujah if he was the only one ever sick he would have took the stripes on his back for your healing if he was the only one ever lost he would have died on the cross to forgive you of your sins that's how much he cares for you but you let the devil lie to you and tell you there's no hope for you that's a lie amen Lord it always made amazing me people can tell you everything the devil told them that week and they can't quote one good Bible verse that's right that's right I say it's time you quit listening to the devil come on somebody amen well Glory yes sir amen always one Miracle one great miracle I say Lord let it be me you see he's the same one tonight he'll come from glory to one needy Soul setting in a Humble Church the same one he'll every time come to where he's wanted but he'll never come to where he's doubted that's right that's why some people when they come to church they seiz God every service because their faith can declare that he's here others come and never see him because their faith cannot declare but I'm tell you he's here the word says he's here well I don't feel it he never said did you feel it but he did say did you believe it if you start believing it you might feel it right Hallelujah he'll every time come to where he's wanted but he'll never come to where he's doubted then let's lay aside every doubt let's lay aside every fear let's believe him tonight there is nothing that's able to stop him from coming when we call the wind couldn't stop you the waves couldn't stop you the storm couldn't stop you the sea couldn't stop you the Devils couldn't stop it there was nothing n o t h i inde there was nothing that can stop him from coming when you call on him you see it wasn't the man's voice it's not how loud you scream it's not come on somebody he never heard the man's voice he was on the other side of the sea then what got Jesus attention it was not the man's voice it was the man's faith and it's his faith can get his attention your faith can get it tonight amen amen amen like the boy in the shopping mall that the prophet run into he said brother benam I'm lost as lost can be I'm like a coin in a sand pile lost and the prophet said but you don't have to stay that way that's [Music] righten amen well I got all kinds of problems may be true but you don't have to stay that way amen sometimes people like problems because they like pity right well well it's getting quieter already but that's all right I'm trying to amen I'm going Le said you don't have have to be you don't have to stay that way there's someone standing present now who can find you the minute that you're ready to be found and the boy said I'm ready oh are you ready tonight don't doubt him just believe him if you're doubting him just remember he'll never be at your door but if you love him and want him he'll come anytime you call for him to come he's ready to come Hallelujah but well I don't know he can help me my problems my marriage I don't know he'll never come with that kind of attitude right well I believe he's a Healer but I don't know if he'll heal me that's a hybrid Faith it'll produce nothing amen don't doubt him just believe him just believe him he'll come anytime that you call for him to come he's ready to come there's one standy present now who can find you the moment you want to be found who can heal you the moment you want to be healed amen amen so we find see if I can button this we'll find that the meeting is coming to a close and he tells his disciples to get into the boat let us go over to the other side now he's feeling the pull of the maniac need amen he is amen praise the Lord he's filling that pool so they get into the ship and Jesus is with them and they begin to cross the water now Jesus being the word he knew all things amen he knew the maniac was on the other side he knew he would deal with that tomorrow he knew the storm was coming he knew the Devils would try to drown them he knew the pig Farmers would reject him and ask him to leave he knew all that just like he knows every he knows everything about everybody in this building right now amen he knows what you're thinking he'll know what you think tomorrow come on somebody right amen you know there's a there's an organ a denomination tried to debate me on Divine Healing said that God don't heal no more I said look I'm sorry if your God subunity he can't heal but my God still heals my God still sa come on somebody there is no God like our God amen amen he knew all that he knew they would reject him he knew they would ask him to leave he already knew all that but he spoke let us pass over to the other side now that was his word and the Bible said his word will not return unto him void but it'll accomplish that which it was sent to do he knew the ways were coming he knew the storm was brewing he knew the winds would pick up but he also knew the word would carry them through so he finds a place to sleep and he lays down knowing the storm is coming amen now think about that for a minute now this this wasn't a storm this was a storm I'm not sure what the greatest category of a hurricane is but say it's C category five this was probably like a seven or an eight and this man knows that a hurricane category 8 Storm is Coming that'll fill the boat with water and he lays down to sleep amen praise the Lord now you've got to be all that because you get nervous for a tornado watch we'll stay up all night come on you know it's the truth but why would he do that because he had a promise from the father for the word says in Proverbs 3:24 when thou liest down Thou shalt not be afraid yeay Thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall be [Music] sweeten God said in a fearful time that's where we're at right now amen it might not be a hurricane but there is a storm brewing in this nation in this fearful time when people are so nervous that they can't even sleep sleeping pill cells are through the roof yet we have the promise that no matter how dark it is how evil it is how violent it is how great the storm is come on now he said when you lay down your sleep can be sweet amen go to sleep go to sleep go to sleep little bride don't you worry I am with you I'll be here till you rise amen praise the Lord just go to sleep not now but when the service is over just seeing if you're still awake he lays down to go to sleep knowing the storm is coming but he wasn't worried he wasn't nervous because he knew the storm oh I like this the storm did not control him that's right he controlled the [Music] storm Hallelujah remember who's in charge Our God has never lost control that's right that's right hallelujah amen you know and it seems like it we find it every time we try to do something for the Lord when you try to help someone or try to draw closer to God walking in obedience it's those times that it seems like the devil always tries to bring barriers or hindrances or snags you know what I'm talking about your phone not go off all day and you go in the prayer closet to pray and you think how did he know that it seems like every time and I was telling we was talking about me and brother martin I had a little got a little dry mouth there for a second me and brother martin we was talking about it yesterday I think it was that in a racetrack you know when they put those horses in behind that gate and Clos that gate do you know what that Gate's called it's called the barrier and the barrier is put there to keep the horses from jumping the gun that's right so it's a barrier to hold them back but the evidence that there's a barrier proves proves that there's a victory line amen if there was no Victory line there would be no barrier so when Satan tries to bring barriers when he tries to bring snakes that's the evidence that there's the victory laying ahead for you don't get discouraged well I'm trying to serve the Lord and this happened and that's happened that's just part of the course but remember that's the evidence you're moving in the right direction amen amen hallelujah the Bible says the thief cometh to steal and kill the destroy do you know a thief will never Rob someone who's got less than them about it is that not true what kind of thief would rob somebody that ain't got no money so what do they look for they look for somebody that they think's got some money and why is the devil attacking you because he sees there's value to your life L hallelujah amen Lord do you love him tonight amen it's them times when we try to draw closer to God that snags come and hindrances come and storms begin to like Moses when God told him when you bring my children out bring them to this mountain and they shall worship me here amen now where are they going to worship God on the mountain why he said so amen but notice he told Moses you go down there and tell Pharaoh thus sayith the Lord Israel is my son you see he never come to steal Pharaoh's slaves he come to he come to redeem his own hallu so God's desire was for Israel to worship him on this mountain amen so here they go after oh my and if you study it you'll find out that the 10 most favorable gods of Egypt was the 10 plagues that sent to Egypt God trumped every one of their gods with the plague showing he was the true and only Goden so they come out let Egypt's Gods literally destroyed and here they are in a Revival wow and where do they come to where are they supposed to be going they're going to the mountain but where do they come to a sea right amen yes think about that for a minute if God said my desire is for you to worship me on this mountain why the Red Sea why the hindrance so they come to the Red Sea and there's desert on one side Mountain to the other and here comes Pharaoh's Army behind them right but Moses had a commission from God bring my children to this mountain that means anything that stands in the way you have a right to speak to it and he said Moses why cry unto me speak Hallelujah hallu and the water parted and they went across on dry ground no oh my God not only did God split the water he dried up the ground he didn't even want their shoes to get [Music] muddy and the water closed and destroyed Pharaoh's Army and marryam and the sisters grabbed tambores and up and down the bank they went shouting and praising God amen amen that's right and where did they go into a desert amen three days with no water now the first day with no water is bearable second day it's getting pretty rough by the third day you about ready to kill somebody for water I'm just being honest you're so thirsty you can't stand it that's right so three days in the desert with no water and all of a sudden the animals begin to smell water and they begin to try to break ranks and the children they realize somebody else water and the kids begin to run and the the animals break ranks and begin to run and they get to the water just three days off like oh just amen get back get back it's bitter amen we can't drink it you Paul would have been almost better to find no water at all right than to find water and can't drink it amen and the Very ones who shouted and danced up and down the bank of the Red Sea now begin to complain that's right what are we going to do for water Moses you brought us out here ain't it something how soon they forgot the Red Sea Revival amen that's right and the thing about it is amen the thing about it is if God fixed one water problem on now can he fix all water problems that's right amen amen the Red Sea was a water problem God fixed it they cried out to God God said Moses cut that tree down throw it in the water and The Bitter Water became sweet then why why would God allow it to begin with because I believe that sometimes God makes the water so bitter that there's nowhere else to look but him that's right amen amen you see if they would have drunk the water they might have say well thank you Lord that's really good you know how we kind of do in a service you know but when oh God but when the water was so bitter they couldn't drink it and then God made it sweet I'd say there was another sweet water revival amen hallelujah sir well what I'm saying this they was going towards the mountain than anything that stood in their way they had a right to speak and go forward amen amen he never told Moses not one time to go back we are not to retreat that's that's right amen if you study the Christian armor there is no armor in the back that's right because God has never commissioned his people to turn back we are going forward well brother Daryl this happened we're going forward where they're saying this we're going forward amen amen Lord hallelujah you know I was in Army I know brother Bill you in the Army Vietnam thank you for your service buddy I was in the Army joined my parents signed for me when I was 16 and I went on active duty when I 17y old now we was raised poor and I always wanted to see the world so they say join the Army see the world so I joined the army for two reasons one to see the world the other to get the GI bill because they were phasing it out and the GI bill would pay for my college which it did when I got out of school I used the GI Bill and become a surgical technician assisted doctors in surgery for years so when I was in the Army I joined you know for those two reasons and when I got out of basic training in Fort S Oklahoma you know where they sent me Fort Brag North Carolina 6 hour hours from home I spent my whole military career 6 hours from home you can't make that up so when I got out of the army the United States Army when I was there oh my and brother Bill you can test father this they gave us a steel pot we call it a steel pot combat helmet they gave us combat boots they gave me an M16 rifle with a 32 round banana clip if I remember right they gave me a backpack to carry my stuff in in combat they gave me an m203 grenade launcher that attached underneath my M16 rifle now the reason they gave me that grenade launcher lot people don't even know what it is they've never heard of it I cared it the whole time I was in the Army but the reason it did I at on the rifle range sighten in the rifle and the drill sergeant looked at me and said you'll be the grenade launcher you don't have to be close just accurate you don't have to be accurate just close so I carried it the whole time I was in the Army I was on a 55 Houser that could fire a projectile 101 lb projectile 18 miles on a charge 8 green bag I lost my hearing being on that gun I have very poor hearing because of it all this the army gave me to defend this country but there's one thing the Army never gave me you know what that was the promise of a victory they just gave me the equipment to fight with no promise of a victory that's right so when I got when I got out of the United States Army in December the 21st 1981 I got into God's Army amen praise the Lord and since I got into God's Army I've been in 32 countries I just found out I was in the wrong Army amen amen amen but when I got into God's Army you know what I found out he gave me equipment he gave me the helmet of salvation he shot my feet with the preparation of the Gospel he gave me the shield of faith and the sword of the word but there's one thing that God gave me oh my that the United States Army never gave me you know what that was a promise of a victory Hallelujah God says look in the back of the book we win we win amen thank you Lord hallelujah yes sir yes sir amen amen if you've done all you can do keep going forward doctor says you can't get well keep going forward amen hallelujah hallelujah Don't Turn back amen speak and go forward Jesus said let us go over to the other side he had a job to do tired and weary he lays down to rest knowing he's in the will of the father moving forward across the sea to the maniac of gadera now here's the I hope I'm not taking too much time here's the disciples now they're moving across this this sea and they were in the message of the hour amen they had with them Jesus the messenger a Revival they was in a Revival sitting there testifying of all the things they seen him do amen it should be smooth saing that's right no worries no bumps were his disciples we moving with him it should be everything should be a picnic there's only one thing wrong with that he never promised that that's right he didn't and remember he keeps all his promises that's right he never said we wouldn't have trials he never said we wouldn't suffer he never said we wouldn't be laughed at made fun of he never said we wouldn't be called a cult come on somebody he never promised smooth saem he never said there wouldn't be storms he never said we wouldn't cry he never said we wouldn't bury loved ones he never said that but he did say I'll never leave thee nor will I forsake thee then no matter what I face brother Paul no matter how great the trial is no matter how great the storm is I do not face it alone he is with me yes sir amen amen he said he said let us go over to the other side so as they're sailing across the sea the storm begins to blow in now Peter being a seasoned fisherman you know Peter he must have been some character being a seasoned fisherman you said now boys I've been out here on this water before I know all about it see that right there so he had this attitude and sometimes it's I heart it's hard to say but it's the truth sometimes we find this attitude among message people I can do this myself I don't need nobody I don't need no help but you know sometimes it's good to be honest when we're going through a trial to be honest and go to God and say God I need help he said in his word if you call unto me I will answer thee amen amen you talk about a calling plan that's a good calling plan that ain't G come on somebody that ain't AT&T that's God call unto me and I will answer thee but Peter with this seasoned fisherman with this attitude boys I've got this in all his ability as a Sean oh don't worry I've got this right here but he didn't have it no he didn't amen his ability as a seaman but you see what Peter failed to realize this just wasn't a storm this was a storm Jesus crossing the stormy sea the devil knew he was on the road to a great win to a great Victory and he tried to drown them that night to cause a storm to come up and 10,000 Devils of the sea s that drowned him amen that night so this just wasn't a storm this was a 10,000 demon storm and he was tired and he was laying in the stern of the boat even the waves didn't wake him up and as the storm be to rise up and the cells were torn and the ores was broke and they begin to toss around the like a like a like a a bottle stopper on a choppy water maybe 20 foot waves amen mhm the boat rocking way up this way way back up this way way back up this way and every time it would go up water would come into the boat the shells were torn the ores were broke where was Jesus amen where was he it looked like if he really cared he'd have been up there with them if he really cared he would have told them the storm was coming right he knew it was coming he knew when it would hit he knew where it would hit he knew how great it would be am yes knowing the infant the beginning he knew what was going to happen he knew it was going to happen he knew when it was going to happen yes where was he where is he when we need you we need you the most he was up here when it was Cal when we got into the boat he was right here right where is he now he knew when it was going to happen he knew it was going to happen oh you're getting quiet that's good but listen the prophet said it only happened to test their faith that's right didn't he say so later so a real child of God in testing time they do not walk by sight they're physic eyes are closed to the things that are around them they only walk by faith you see you can't walk by sight and walk by faith at the same time the eyes of your head will lie to you they will deceive you but we must look not with the eyes of our head but with the eyes of our heart we look to the Unseen for there the Unseen things that are real they only walk by faith of the Lord Jesus looking to his word believing that he'll keep every word exactly the way he said he would do it testing times trials sometimes God let afflictions hit his people to test them for their faith he was oh don't miss this he was testing a saint not rebuking a sinner sometimes brother Bill things happen to us not because we fail god brother the Bible matter of fact the prophet said in Victory Day the more loyal the more testing amen so sometimes Christan when they have trials it's not because they fail God but it's because God's Got Confidence and you see the thing about test it's like going to the gym you you go to get into shape well I heard about it I don't know but and you start out with 5 PBS then you go to 10 15 20 then you go to 30 35 you pull a muscle you go back to five but what are you do doing every weight gets stronger it makes the muscles get harder makes them get and that's the way Trials Come God allows tests and you pass that one then a little bit more and a little bit more but each test stronger greater what's it doing it's building faith muscles if God delivered me out of this storm he can deliver me out of that storm [Applause] amen hallelujah amen so if you're in a trial not don't well God must hate me no no no matter of fact you'll find it's just the oppos it amen it's because he loves you amen maybe that's why you're sick tonight amen maybe that's why there's a law in Revival is to see what you're going to do about it are you going to pick it up what are you going to do so we find sometimes God listen to me when the when the church is on fire everybody's hollering amen and Hallelujah it's easy to say Amen man it's easy to raise your hand it's easy to stand when everybody else stands but let a law the Revival come when nobody says amen come on now are you still going to say Amen is the word still true whether anybody acknowledges it don't change the word and sometimes God allow just to see what are we going to do about it you see the testing of faith is not on top of the mountain when everything's going good it's really when we're in in the valley when everything's going wrong can we still praise him can we still worship can we still have Revival meetings amen I preached the message here a few years ago this day I give my all for Jesus Christ and I got it off of a when I was down at UT football stadium and they had a sign in the in the locker room and the and the guys would slap that sign when they went out onto the field and I was looking around in this locker room and I had an invitation to tour the UT Stadium I said yeah I'd like to see it so I go down there so I go into the locker room and when I walk in there brother Paige the carpet this is nice carpet but that carpet was about that thick it was like I thought my Lord I got that kind of carpet and these guys wearing cleats and I looked and they had lockers and above each Locker was the name of a football player who had played there who had done great things for the state of Tennessee for the for the utth volunteers and you know I don't know a lot about football but there was a few names I recognized one of them was pton Manning so this locker and above this Locker was P Manny it mean p Manny when he played for UT he had that Locker so when you get that Locker you can look up and say if P Manny did great things for Tennessee and had this Locker if I've got this Locker I can do great things for Tennessee too and they had another Reggie White and a few that's the only two I really recognize but I was looking at that and I thought you know God's got a locker room amen and above this Locker is a David and a Daniel you say if God did great things for Daniel and God did great things for David then he can do great things for Meen you see sometimes I think the devil wants to put these guys like a David and a Daniel and a Moses put them up so high right well you can well you can never be that but you see if you'll only realize David was just a man like you are who believed God for the day he lived in that's right amen amen amen you know you mentioned gono one of my favorite characters in history is gono a good just a you know the prophet said so many good things about gono mhm he did but when you mention the name jono people get an image in their mind of an Indian with feathers on a horse and flute music you know you mentioned gono you think of an Indian on a horse and Feathers but how many knows gerano drove a car I guess not you nobody amen how many know he wrote a ferris wheel do you know that you know Dono was on the 1910 inaugurational parade of Teddy Roosevelt he wrode in that parade you say what are you saying I'm simply saying this we get this image in our mind and a lot of times Hollywood produces that image and we get that image in our mind but in reality it wasn't that way at all brother B said he was just fighting he was just a man fighting for his god-given rights that God gave him a land and a nation and a place to live amen so I'm trying to tell you friends that that we are just like David just like we're just people for our day that God has placed Us in this hour that we would take the word for this hour and make that word live amen amen amen amen and so they would slap that sign and they would go out into the 96,000 screaming fans this day I'll give my all for Tennessee and they was willing to go out there and get bruised and break bones and and get dirty and sometimes even get paralyzed even people have died on a football field but they was willing to do that for Tennessee and I looked at that and I thought my God and brother Martin's got one above his church I thought that ought to be above every Church door of every message church this day I'll give my all not for Tennessee not for Michigan come on some not for the Red Wings but for Jesus Christ that when I go out that door I can say I gave everything I had I gave my best amen I gave my best Hallelujah I sung the best I knew how to sing that this I heard one time that a man was deaf and dumb he couldn't see couldn't hear couldn't that and he used Braille and so they asked him said why do you even come to church you can't see you can't hear and he answered back and Braille I come so the devil will know what side I'm on oh Hallelujah when you come through those doors let the devil know whose side that you're on I got to hurry I know you got to drive back home trouble set in the storm was so great the wind the rain the lightning they were so busy fighting for their lives they forgot the very one who said let us go over to the other side the very Creator amen was in the boat with them they should have known he knew all these things they should have known that he knew what's going to happen they should have remembered he had it all in control why was he letting it happen when he got into the ship he knew it was going to happen why was he doing that testing their faith do you believe believe what I tell you finally the waves had them beat de down the wind was just too strong they were going to sink everything was crashing in I know we've all had those times when you felt like everything was coming in against you seemed like your health is in trouble your marriage is in trouble your kids are in trouble and seem like everything is coming against you yes everything was crashing in what we going to do what are we going to do in all their fear in all their anguish the greatest storm of their life 10,000 demons trying to drown them somebody said wait a minute wait a minute where's Jesus where is he amen he's in the boat with us the answer to the storm was in the boat oh oh Hallelujah awake the master master we're going to Parish he rebukes the storm the wind the sea obey him a 2oot waves and he car on the bowle of the boat and he says peace be still and hallelujah amen yes just climb clear you could comb your hair in the reflection of the water amen how quick things change when he steps on to side of the boat and he turned to them and he said to them why are you so fearful where is your faith did not I say we're going to the other side was not I with you can have just a few more minutes I think I've told this sh before but it just comes to my mind there is a legend among the Cherokee it's called the ride of Passage that when a boy reaches the age of 12 his father takes him to a secret place known only by the father and he sets him on a rock or on a tree stump and he ties his feet but he ties them loose so he can get out he ties his hands but he ties them loose so he can get out and he blindfolds the boy boy now the boy must sit there all night long if he cries out he fails the test if he slips out of the ties and lifts the blindfold to see what's going on he fails the test if he gets up and walks around he fails the test he must sit there all night long but at the rising of the sun when the first rays of the new day domes and Strikes the boy's face he can come out of the ties take off the blindfold and he's a man it's called the right of passage so the father takes him to the secret place sets him down ties him up and the boy must sit there am first few hours no problem about 9 or 10:00 when the coldness of the night begins to set in and the cies begin to Yelp gets a little nervous I used to go camping with the girls out in the backyard and I tell my wife I said leave the door unlocked first time the cow is yep we'll be in that's true they let out that woo let's go to the house daddy so every rustle of the leaves he hears is it a coyote is it a bear is it a mountain line is it a Shae looking for a scalp he don't know he don't know he's blindfolded every rustle of the leaves makes a noise it's tfold when you're blindfolded setting in the dark but at the rising of the Sun when the ray strikes the boy's face he comes out of the ties he lifts off the blindfold and it's only then that he realizes setting behind him is his daddy he had been there the whole time he had never left him alone and I'm so glad in this darkness of last SE yes and the rustling of the leaves of confusion you don't have to be afraid brother Bill daddy is right here with us thank you Lord yes he is he's the same yesterday today and forever and if he calm the storm by being in the ship with them he can calm our storm by being in the ship with us the answer to the storm was in the ship with them and the answer to your storm tonight is in the ship with you right the same Jesus he just changed [Music] ships prise Hallelujah you remember we all had to wear those masks

in second Timothy persecution afflictions which came unto me at Antioch and and ionium and lth what persecutions I endured but out of them all out of them all out of them all the Lord delivered me
