TRANSCRIPT
========================================
it's just words right and uh there's something about words without heart it's just doesn't go very far amen but when you can put your heart into the things that you say it warms your heart person that's speaking to you you know if they mean it from their heart it just warms you and uh I believe I believe the Lord is pleased when we offer our hearts to the Lord behind the things that we said even said about the Pharisees he said uh they think that they're heard for they're much speaking it isn't isn't the words it's it's their heart that comes behind it and I think that it's a blessing for us to come here today and and have the opportunity that we have to Worship the Lord from the dictates of our heart and know that you know it may not be exactly the way that the person next to us is worshiping but God sees her heart and and that he's pleased with our love for him amen amen well God bless you turn with me if you would to the book of St Mark chapter 10 want to say it's really good to see sister hope amen God bless you Sister It's been a uh hard test and trials all the way around but um in in reality uh all of us go through tests and trials and uh sometimes the hardest one is the beginning when you first make your commitment to the lord the devil does everything he can to stand in that way I want to say it's good to see everyone here today God bless you we're we're missing uh so many and we wish that you could be here and pray that God would bless you there just as much as he could here amen pray that all of us are just in the spirit because uh it's God that speaks to us and not not brother John amen we're looking to the Lord let's just read just one verse of scripture we'll have a word of prayer and then have you be seated Mark chapter 10 just verse 21 this is the story of the Rich Young Ruler uh who come to the Lord and and wanted to uh have eternal life like every other human being does not want to die but wants to live forever and he went through his life and he did the things that he thought he needed to do but there was still something inside of him that was questioning and that's what made him ask uh Lord what can I do to to inherit eternal life and he said in verse 21 Jesus beholding him loved him and said unto him one thing thou lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou has and give it to the poor and thou shal have treasure in heaven and come take up thy cross and follow me amen let's look to the author of the scripture in prayer Heavenly Father we've read Thy word which were not even worthy to look upon it but you said blessed are your eyes if if you just read it but Lord you also gave a special blessing to those that understand and we pray that the Holy Ghost would come and give us the understanding Lord of not only the scripture but all the scriptures that we'd read today Lord the very subject that you have for us we pray that you would become so real to every one of our hearts that we could just look beyond the Flesh and and and ignore the things of the the past or or anything that the enemy would try to put into our minds and help us just to connect with you this morning and receive from you the things that we have need of Lord we commit this service now to you we give you the praise and honor for all that you will do but we ask it in Jesus name amen God bless you may be seated today we want to en tile this message terms God's terms and conditions God's terms and conditions and for a subject paying attention to the fine print often times when we do certain contracts uh renting mortgages purchasing cars getting insurances uh especially insurances um if you don't pay attention to the fine print you can come up disappointed and uh even in this great subject that of uh our relationship with God and getting eternal life um there's a lot of people that did we know that will not look at the fine print and in the day of judgment many will come to him and say Lord Lord did not we do this and this and this and he will say unto them uh you didn't look at the fine print it wasn't just this and this and this it's it's everything we got to look at the the fine print and say this morning where would we be without the Forgiveness of God in our Liv we'd be lost be lost in this world think about all the people that don't that you know that don't know God and they don't know where to go what to do their lives are in turmoil they're mixed up or they're just deceived thinking that they're right the world is falling apart people are being let us LED astray they're they're like sheep without a shepher they they don't know where to go or what to do and when we get Down On Our Knees to humbly ask God to forgive us we look to Calvary we look to the the blood of the Lamb that Supreme sacrifice and we give thanks and praise to God because we know that we're we're Unworthy of the mercies of God so I say Amen where would we be without the Forgiveness of God today even this day the sins that we sinned yesterday yesterday if we would not be forgiven today where would we be but there are many times that God's mercy and forgiveness doesn't come easy in fact we may not realize it but there are many scriptures and conditions that God has Clauses in the scriptures even for his forgiveness and let's just look at one of them today it's in Mark 11: 25 Mark 11:25 and I just want you to I want you to to focus in on things that we may Overlook in the scriptures when we think about God and his love and all the things that that God has towards us because a lot of times um these things that we're going to be talking about um are the things that disappoint us because if you you talk about those terms and conditions and you find out the insurance policy didn't work because uh because of this fine print here and usually it's the fine print that disappoints you I wish I would have known I would have never ever tried this hamburger I would have never bought this car I would have never got this insurance I would have never married you why didn't you tell me the fine print all right Mark 11:25 and when you stand praying forgive if you have ought against any that your father also which is in heaven May forgive you of your trespasses but if here's the fine print but if you do not forgive neither will your heavenly Father which is in heaven forgive your trespasses so it's not as easy as just you know Lord forgive me I the I I plead the blood but there's there's also more that God is expecting of us the condition of forgiveness isn't just asking God to forgive you or the blood automatically covers you or atones you or that Christ already died for you and already paid the price for your debts Jesus gave a condition of forgiveness that we have to be like God he wants us to be like him and that is about to forgive others think about that we want God to forgive us he's not look at us and says I want you to be like me you learn to forgive as well God is is Shifting our thoughts into a more mature way of looking at things away from a selfishness into a a a maturity amen Matthew chapter 6 ver14 Matthew chapter 6 ver14 for if ye forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you forgive you but if you forgive not men the trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses and uh if you're human you're we have trespasses if you're human if there's angels in here which we know there's angels in here we can't see him well uh at least the the angels that have not Fallen they have not trespassed but the fallen angels that are here they've trespassed and they're trying to get us to doubt the word to doubt what's being preached most of the time that we're seeking forgiveness from God our focus is on his Mercy right because we're looking for God to have mercy on us because we've sinned we've come short but God's focus is on our character he's not just interested in us being forgiven he's interested in being able to have the character to forgive others that's where his focus is at so he's he's Shifting the way way that we think towards the way that he thinks amen too often our attention is drawn to what we need or what we want from God and God's continuously drawing our attention to what he wants us to do and sometimes it's first and we need to remember that so A lot of times when we come to the Lord and just God I need your forgiveness we need to to shift from just God forgiven me to what is it that you want me to do remember his thoughts are higher than our thoughts his ways are higher than our ways we enjoy talking about how great God's love is we enjoy talking about his Rich mercies that that it rote our life and his Amazing Grace yet the conditions that God wants us to think about are the things that need to to trans Inspire our Our Lives into becoming more into his character and we don't want to forget those because we'll come short we realize that there's no condemnation now to them that walk in Christ Jesus right there's no condemnation to them that that walk in the spirit and not in the flesh but you know we do still walk in the flesh so that means condemnation can come and and and we don't realize it people like to to view God in a way that God is always happy with them they're doing a great job there isn't really much more that they could do they're really passing all the test so any gospel that's preached different than this way of thinking will keep a person from the ability to receive something from God I hope you're catching what I'm saying we all want to view God as God is happy with us because any view other than that makes us feel bad makes us feel uh immaturely convicted immaturely condemned but we don't want to feel that we want to feel that God's happy with us I I I came to church today God ought to be happy with me I ask God to forgiven he ought to be happy with me but there's many things that God has to tell us and we we don't want a relationship that's just I only want to carve out this part of God you know we we got to take them we got to marriages hook lion Sinker take the good with the bad the bad with the good if I could say it like that and uh we may view God in a way that's got bad when he's wanting us to crucify our flesh the problem was never with what Jesus preached it was the problem with how people re perceived what he preached the problem was with the attitude The View that they had about what Jesus preached and and so it is today it's not the word it just people want a different word that will not help us grow in the Lord it may make us feel better we may enjoy it more our flesh may want it more but it will not help our character God is continuously trying to shift our attention to view things the way that Christ viewed things to to have let this mind that was in Christ be in you be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind so God is is is is trying to make us think like God thinks to see things the way God sees things and we can't come into church with preconceived ideas about God or how God views us or looks at us or what he wants for our life we need to place oursel in a neutral position and let let God begin to speak to our hearts amen so as we grow in the Lord a way of thinking continues to grow as well first Corin Ians chap 13 verse 11 says when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I grew up I put away those childish way of thinking and and and we've got to be strong enough to do that we can't hang on to them nobody can put those away from you you've got to be the one willing to put away childish thoughts it's same thing for a Believer as he matures in the Lord he has to put away those childish things those well he didn't shake his my hand he didn't smile at me he didn't he didn't make me feel good he didn't it is nothing about that put away those things amen God expects us to put away childish selfish behaviors and to put on the behavior of living for others loving others laying down your life for others amen many are areas of our life if how could say it like that amen Jesus said in St John chapter 16:12 I've quoted it many times but as we're talking about these terms and conditions I want to repeat it again I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now bear that word bear means to carry to pick it up in other words the word is spoken but you just leave it there like water off a duck's back you just okay get on to the next thing that's not what I come to church for that's not what I'm looking for right how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you in all truth he will not speak of himself amen but whatsoever you shall hear that shall he speak and he show you things to come so when the Holy Spirit is in our life and is around us and I'm telling you I believe the holy spirit is by you today where you're sitting I believe that with all my heart he's wanting you to pick up the word to car and and carry it with you out of here and make it part of your life don't leave it here remember what God has said I have yet many things to say unto you the things that are in God's mind the things that are already in God's mind but the question is can we pick up the word that's presented to us can we walk in more of his will or are we going to get offended is it too hard to carry the responsibility of laying down your life the responsibility of forgiveness we just read about it we all want forgiveness but can we carry the responsibility of forgiving others right or are we going to talk about it you know it's so easy to talk about somebody else who's done wrong but where's the person who quickly covers who forgives who's exercising Christ amen because this is a responsibility it's a responsibility to be merciful to somebody Amen to to reach out to the for Souls it's a responsibility you got to pick up that word right you got to carry that we don't want to make the gospel private in other words this is The Gospel according to John Martin I want this and I want this and I want a Cadillac and I want this and whatever I ask in his name and I can make it whatever I want to make it but that would be my gospel and that would be my private relationship and at the end I'm going to end up saying Lord Lord did not I do this in the end I never knew you I never knew you because I had many things to say to you but you couldn't pick it up when I gave it to you when I showed it to you you didn't say I'm goingon to make it part of my life Hebrews chapter 5 verse 11 Hebrews chapter 5 verse 11 of whom we have many things to say many you ever come to church and say well this is the same old same old God has many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you're dull of hearing hard to be uttered did you ever have to say something to somebody but you knew it was going to be hard to say it because they you knew they were going to have a hard time taking it you could just say it like it is but that ain't going to work so you try to say it in such a way that they can take it so you're you're searching for the words and you're for the opportunity and and just the right way to bring it in it's hard to be uttered sometimes God is trying to get his word across but it's hard to utter it to us because of our condition because of our attitude seeing you are dull of hearing now that word dull it means sluggish lazy slothful it's just too hard to carry that word too hard too hard to try look there is nothing greater than the word of God the truth of God there is nothing greater on the planet than the word of God we are the Most Blessed people on the planet we've even been introduced to the messenger that God sent sent to get a bride ready we are blessed to have the understanding of the scriptures we are blessed why would we take the attitude of being dull of hearing yeah I heard you but you know whatever you're turning down Christ you're not turning down the person that's telling you you're turning down Christ verse 12 for when for the time he ought to be teachers you've heard this long enough you need to be teaching this to somebody else you have need that one would teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and are become such you became as such as have need of milk from a bottle and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is considered a babe this is not the hour to be satisfied with being a babe this is not the hour it's a dangerous hour that we're living in God is coming for a mature bride without spot without wrinkle there's a maturity she has the character she can lay down her life she can forgive she can be merciful she can love she can reach out for Souls she's mature look strong meat but strong meat that's stable steadfast nourishment if you look that up stable steadfast nourishment belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil now we know it is evil to kill somebody and it is good to help somebody but can we discern the good and evil that takes place in this between these ears can we discern the good and evil in our life because there are good and evil in our life continuously continuously but Satan wants us to feel that it's always good so therefore we never really exercise it on oursel I just exercise it on my brother Mark I see him make so so many sins that ain't even funny I call them out all the time too you know what he said one more time and I'm leaving you call my sin one more time I'm I'm leaving I'm gonna go find another place to be no he never said that because I never said that but we got to exercise what's going on in here don't wait for somebody to come up to you and say your tie is crooked take a moment look in the mirror see if the ti is crooked come to church I want to hear from you Lord I want you to tell me if my ti is crooked amen that's what it's all about if we're not at full age press into Christ this is not the hour to be laying around Jesus is coming soon now if we're of full age then we need to receive the strong meat of the word that's not just some strong Doctrine that's been laying in the message that we're hoping to hear something that excites us it's learning how to do all of God's will that's what strong meat is brother John you better give me scripture for that one okay okay I will John chapter 4:34 John chapter 4:34 Jesus saith unto them my meat is to do the will of him that sent me and to finish his work now it's one thing to receive instructions from the Lord but you got to answer the question have you finished the work that he gave you to do so what is your meat what meat are you looking for it's to do all not just part of the will of God but we ought to be looking for the part that we're not doing to be finishing the work that he gave us to do we all got meat to do his will I'd like to say I've done it but somehow when I wake up in the in the morning I feel something's missing in my life that there's more I can be doing for the Lord you know we can get so lost into ourself that we don't even have that anymore true many scriptures have conditional Clauses to them that we may not even realize it we may not focus on it we may not even pay attention this morning I want to take a look at some of the the fine print in the Bible if I could we want to allow the the Holy Spirit to shift our thoughts from the way that we're looking at things to another way of thinking how many want to be a friend of Jesus his name is Jesus he'll be your friend he's human as well as Divine oh I want you to know him I want you to meet him this wonderful friend of mine everybody wants to be a friend of Jesus I don't want to be his enemy John chap 15 verse4 you would think it's pretty easy to be a friend of Jesus he said ye are my friends if look at the fine print here if you do the things I command you the fine print here is if we are considered a friend of God if we walk in the things that he's already already told us yesterday what did he tell you yest yesterday don't don't just come to church keep looking for new things when we haven't done the old things amen now the First Command the First Command we're going to talk about commands the first command for any of us is to believe that's the first thing Faith it's through faith that God created everything that we see everything that we don't see all the Angels everything that's transpiring in those other Realms and the first condition that God has set forth for mankind is faith if thou can't believe all things are possible without faith we can't please God the Bible says and he that cometh to God must first believe not be proven must first believe that he is and that he is a rewarder to them that diligently seek him you don't ha God don't have to prove and he will not prove to anybody God he's the one that created gravity molecules everything that's in existence and the only way that God understands that we're stuck here on the earth is through gravity something that God made and so there's scientists and there's people who who seek out to to understand how Brave uh brain waves function and how the heart beats and and and and the nature of animals and and how the tides can go in different directions in the sea and all there's just so much that God is created and it's so wonderful and so beautiful but when it comes to knowing god in a relationship ship God is not going to prove to you scientifically who he is you must believe nothing short of it that's right you'll never know God outside of Faith he that believeth not Jesus said is condemned already because he believeth not in the name of the only begotten son John 8: 24 I said therefore unto you John 8:24 that ye shall die in your sins if ye believe not that I am he he shall die in your sins faith is a requirement we can obtain a good report if we exercise things through faith that's what the scripture says the elders obtained a good report by using faith in their life Matthew chapter 17:20 and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say unto you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say into this mountain remove hence into Yonder place and it shall be removed and nothing shall be impossible unto you faith it needs to be the the first the middle and the last part right we need perfect faith for a rapture we can't ever do away with faith we can't be we can't get away from that freshness with the Lord faith is what moves your relationship with God forward faith is what moves It Forward when you do not exercise faith when you do not build yourself up in the Most Holy Faith unbelief will move your relationship backwards with God you can become more distant with God when you get to a place when you have to if God don't do this and he don't show you this and he don't prove this when you start getting away from Faith you're starting to get away from God we're living in an age where we need to be earnestly contending for the faith amen that was once delivered to the Saints we need it till we get out of here the first condition that God has set forth for mankind is faith if you believe then you can make a choice to follow the lord Mark 16:16 he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned you got to believe but we got to believe as the scripture says we got to believe all the scriptures right the fine print let's look a little bit more closely into the condition of following the Lord in Luke chapter 9 verse 23 and he said to not just one person not just to you but he said to them all what he says to one he says to all If any man will come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me it's not just believing in being baptized anymore now there's there's some fine print here there's a denying yourself taking up the things that God would ask you to do and sometimes they're suffering they're hurtful we may view it as a cross that's the fine print in our opening scripture Jesus was talking to a a young man who had some some wealth in his life and he also was a man of authority and this young man he had a desire for eternal life enough of a desire that he tried to keep the Commandments of God from his youth but it wasn't enough the conditions he wants and expects is first place in her life how many times have you had a honeydew list and you just wanted to get the list done before things were added how many times did your boss give you a list of things to do and you just wanted to get that list done because it was weighing on you and and often times we just want to do whatever God wants us to do to get it off our back and this young man he was doing the Commandments that God's word asked to do but there was still something left undone in his life this man is a typical example of people wanting to hang on things in their life and not give them up we all have them we sit here today every one of us has little things hanging on that we don't want to give up he had other Desires in his heart that did not include God and those desires will always be the thing that sell you short from from a relationship with God always Mark 10: 21 our opening scripture then Jesus beholding him he loved him and he said unto him one thing thou lackest one thing go thy way sell look at the command now sell whatsoever thou has give it to the poor and thou shalt treasure in heaven now when you get that done come take up your cross and follow me God has terms and conditions one thing thou lackest to me that's a a term and and condition why didn't he say uh you have one additional thing in your life why didn't he say that it' be a true statement because most people feel that they can have something in their life as long as they're doing the things of God people don't realize that that desire that one thing that they're holding on to is the one thing that's keeping God from being first in their life and God wants to be first in their life terms and conditions is that God wants control of our life he just doesn't want to save us it isn't like we're co-equal with God that's what Lucifer wanted co-equal I want to be like him I want to be like the most high co-equal like God's going to do his will and I'm going to do mine co-equal we're born to do the will of God any extra Desires in our life will always be the things that are lacking for God to have complete control of Our Lives if he Lord of everything he's not Lord at all so you want him as your friend I mean how many's how many's really happy that you know somebody that can get you out of a pinch come on oh I got somebody in the police force I got somebody over here I got somebody who's a really good mechanic I got somebody over here I I know this one oh if I ever need yeah that's the way that a lot of people look at Jesus he's the the one that can help me out of this mess talking about relationship we're talking to the bride amen we're we're talking about something greater God would not allow this man to follow Jesus think about it with other desires even though he was coming to church and he kept the Commandments from a youth God would not allow him to follow him even with these other Desires in his life I want you to think about the other desires that are in your life because they could be keeping us from following the Lord come on it's a it's a strong statement Jesus told him to leave go thy way get rid of the desires that I cannot control inside of you and come in other words when you're willing pick up your cross and follow me huge huge fine print to me something that's overlooked by the churches overlooked by the multitudes they don't mind talking about God's love God's mercy what God did for protect him God did this God did that God what about the fine print talk to me about the fine print because when it gets on the other side is any of that going to matter is any of the other going to matter but God you were so good to me you did this and you did this and you did that and you protected me here and you met this need and I never ran out you okay okay okay okay I did but that has nothing to do with our relationship because our relationship is between me and you and I want you to start cough coughing up what you've done for me I want you to start talking to me about what I commanded you to do the fine print in my word because that's what's going to matter on the day of judgment notice as we read it again Jesus has love in his heart for this man he has compassion in his in his heart for this man's Soul yet God's great love couldn't save him against his own will I want you to think about that how great God's love is it's the greatest power on the planet and yet this power was not strong enough to save this man against his own will it's so strong it cannot penetrate self-will you're the only one that can turn that door you're the only one that can open that door of self-will he can knock and he can say I love you John Martin I love you but I've got to be the one to open that door I got to be the one to say Lord come in your will be done not my I'll sell what to have a give to the poor I'll go here I'll go there I'll do this I'll do that whatever Lord think about it God's terms and conditions verse 22 and he was sad at that same and one away grieved for he had great possessions and Jesus looked round about and saith unto his disciples how hardly shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God the thing about riches why I believe that this was brought out is because when I have money when we have money we can buy anything money buys any desire buys any desire without money I'm limited to what I can hold on to I mean if I was in love with Planters you know I'd be if I was obsessed with planners that would definitely between be keep me between God my relationship with him because I got lots of planners at my house so just because we don't have money doesn't mean we can't have things that we're holding on to right but when you got money oh it just opens the door for such such desires and the disciples were astonished at his words now this is his own disciples but Jesus anth again and saith unto them children how hard it is for them that trust in riches to enter into the kingdom of God in other words if I've got money I don't need you to help me if anything I don't need to depend on God for where my next meal is coming to help me with this surgery that I need because I got Blue Cross money get you to have what you want so you can't depend so you're not you're not forced to depend on the Lord yeah and God wants us to depend on him so I say it like this if you got money God bless you but live like you don't am Abraham did not flaunt his money right but he was very rich verse 25 it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God and they that and they were astonished out of measure saying among themselves who then is able to be saved and Jesus looking upon them saith with men this is totally impossible but not with God praise praise the Lord for with God God all things are possible and then Peter began to say unto him L we have left all we're now like this guy we've left all and have followed thee now that sounded pretty good at that point but Peter did not realize what was in his heart and a lot of times we don't realize what's in our heart when we have this feeling of all for the Lord how many times you made a decision I'm going to start doing this and you you did not continue to do it that's why we need to press in to the Lord press in for more of the Holy Ghost these terms and conditions gave this young man that were given this man weren't just for him but these these terms and conditions were for all of us Luke 14: 26 If any man come to me and hate not his father mother wife children brethen sister yeah in his own life he cannot be my disciple what a term and condition you know many people are claiming to be a disciple of Christ and they have not put Christ above other people God will only take first place in a relationship and whosoever does not bear his cross and come after me he cannot be my disciple terms and conditions if we want Jesus to pick up pick us as one of his disciples for for 2020 he's got terms and conditions for us too John 8:31 John 8:31 then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him if you continue in 2020 in my word then are ye my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now these Jews had already believed on the Lord they already believed in Jesus but Jesus was wanting them to read the fine print the fine print is that God is wanting us to continue in the things that he's going to further show us remember you're my friends if you do whatsoever I command you right if is that little word if you continue in my word in the things which I teach you you shall know the truth the truth shall make you free and then your disciple ready and then your disciple ready we want to claim where we're at with god without the following of the word and our emphasis needs to be on continuing coming to church I'm going to hear something that God wants me to do this week I'm going to try to do it that's really what this should all be about not smer not coming and and just picking what we want and not picking what we don't want and still saying I'm a Christian I'm not trying to make anybody feel bad and I think all of you know that but there's terms and conditions here Hebrews chapter 3:14 Hebrews chap 3:14 for we are made partakers of Christ when we repent and get baptized are you sure for we are made partakers of Christ if terms and conditions if we hold the beginning of our confidence which was when we repented and got baptized if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast unto the end so we've got to start we've got to repent we've got to get baptized but it's not over then that's just the beginning you've got to stay steadfast you got to keep going you got to hold that same confidence I remember when I got when I repented and I got baptized that was what I was told what I needed to do to get saved and I knew I was lost and wanted salvation and my confidence was when I got done doing this I was going to be set free and I was going to heaven now if I don't maintain that steadfastness well what do you mean keep getting re baptized keep repenting no what means is when the word is being preached to me if God shows me okay I want you to get rid of those records then I need to repent get rid of those records records right God says you need to quit that smoke I need to quit that smoking right you need to cut your hair I'll cut my hair whatever God commands me to do I need to continue to walk in that word I need to hold my that my beginning confidence steadfast to the end that's what it means that's the fine print in the Bible the terms and conditions that God has set forth for everyone of us now if you're having a hard time with that that's what verse 15's for while it is said today if you will hear his voice and Harden not your hearts as in the provocation this what is happening to all of us is not the first time it's ever happened everybody is tempted with getting their hearts hardened they don't want to follow the lord they don't want to do everything that God tells them to do they don't want to whatever I could say a lot of things but it's up to us that no matter what God is speaking to us personally we need to allow our hearts to be soft let that word penetrate come to that place where you can say as Jesus said not my will thy will be done Lord and he'll see you through amen Hebrews chapter 10:35 cast not away therefore your confidence why it has a great recompense of reward for you have needed patience we all about to say Amen to that one that after you have done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come he's going to come and he will not tar now the just are living by faith amen they're living by faith it wasn't just oh I believe in God but they're living by faith but if any man draws back on that way of living where he's no longer living by faith where he's no longer holding his confidence in his relationship the Bible says my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we and this is where we take a stand today this is where you said say Amen to the word today but we are not of them who draw back unto destruction to paraliz end to predition but of them that believe to the saving of the Soul what does that mean brother John that means he that endureth to the end the same shall be saved that today is the day of salvation and if you live tomorrow tomorrow will be the day of salvation the terms of God's love as we're getting ready to close but we're not closing I just want to make that real clear anybody that has an idea that we're closing no I say we're getting ready to close the terms of love that God has set forth for us let's take a look at the fine print it has to do with our relationship John Chapter 13 Verse number 35 by this shall all men know that you're my disciple okay well first we had to not put mom and dad first anymore not put our spouse first not put our our most loving children first we had to give up everything we have to get up in the morning and deny our our will we have to be willing to do the things that he asked us to pick up our cross and follow him and now and now what is he asking us to do by this shall all men know you're my disciples if you have loved one for another I thought I only had to do all those things and now that's not even good enough people I can do that and people will never not always know that I'm his disciple there's something greater that I have to do that for people to know that I'm a real disciple of God and that's to love you when you don't love me to care about you when you don't care about me to remember you when you don't remember me to lay down my life if you could care less about laying down yours that is the true evidence that you're worldwide everybody's going to know that you're a disciple of Christ amen do you know how often we try to prove other people that we belong to God without loving them I'm going to prove I'm right I'm going to prove I belong to God God but we don't use love and how many times somebody Tred proven to you that they were a disciple and you felt as cold as ice you didn't feel the love in their heart you just felt them defending they were so righteous but there's that there's missing of love and it made you question did it not it makes you question every single time but when they love oh wow love is corrected certainly is but you need to speak the truth in love you need to cover love covers a multitude love is patient kind endures all things believes all things hopes all love love does so much more than the flesh is willing to do Divine love is not an option it's a term and Condition it's a term and condition for us John 14:15 if you love me keep my Commandments if you love me keep them John 15 ver2 and this is my commandment excuse me John 15:12 this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you now don't you just wish it would put a period after that you love one another and just put a period there I could just love everybody but if I have to love everybody that little Clause that little yeah that's right brother r as God has loved me whoa It's a whole another ball game that's the big leads that's not double a tria a college high school that's the big league to love others the way that God loves us don't you like it when somebody brags about you that you were you love somebody the same way that God loved you what a feeling that is because we break about God's love how much he loves us right we ought to be hearing somehow someway through the grap Vine that our love is making an impact on one another that's what the the love of God does in the body of Christ it edifies it it grows it makes a difference it it covers it it blocks it it does what it needs to do to keep building praise God you know I feel his presence I know this is the truth Greater Love have no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends and ye are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you so he laid down his life for the world but most of the world kept the door shut very few open that door and say Lord come on into my heart I want to start obeying the things that you command me to do I want to love you the way that you love me and say has told a lot of people don't you worry about letting Jesus in your heart God still loves you and God does still love them but he doesn't love them enough to put them in heaven we've got to open that door let God in s with him amen praise the Lord let's look at the fine print in God's love Luke 6 verse number 32 Luke chapter 6 verse 32 for if you love them which love you what thank have ye what thank so here Jesus is is really saying people like to receive thanks hey thank you for you know thank you for doing that for me thank you for for saying that and if you're doing if you're loving them which only love you what thank have ye for Sinners also love those that love them and if you do good to them that which do good to you I'll give you a Christmas present if you give me a Christmas present what than have you you try giving a present to somebody that cannot give you you a present am try giving to somebody that you know cannot give you something you may have to give something and say Anonymous Giver because what you're doing at that point is you're really giving to the Lord yeah if you do good to them that do good to you what thank heav you for Sinners also do even the same and if you lead them if you lend to them of whom you hope to receive what think have he for Sinners also lend to Sinners to receive as much can I remember when I was in the world oh yeah you knew you go you went to your sinner friends if you needed something hey can I bum this off you yeah you make sure you give it back man think of all the times God has loved you when you weren't loving him how about think about all the the times that God's been good to you when you were not good to him all the times that he lent you a helping hand and gave you what you needed to get you out of trouble when you weren't doing anything for him now that's the type of believer God is calling us to be amen and we have it in our possession to do the same to one another as God has done to you God is trying to shift our way of thinking from an immature all about me to being like him amen that's what's happening I love it verse 35 but love ye your enemies and do good and lend hoping for nothing amen how many times we have motives selfish motives of recognition and your reward shall be great and ye shall be the children of the highest for he is kind unto the unthankful and to the evil be ye therefore merciful as your father also is merciful look at the fine print don't don't just love love as he loved don't just love those that you have respect to persons for try loving everybody all the time no matter what that will include your enemies terms and conditions of a love relationship with God is loving others the same way that God has loved us turn with me if you would to 1 John 3:1 16 love like God loves us is all about learning how to yield yourself to God that's really what it's all about because I'll be honest with you I was born in sin shaped in iniquity and I have no idea how to love like God loves the way that I love is whatever I got to do to get what I want that's what I I'll tell you I'm an expert at it I was it was like I was was born with this gift of selfishness and I can connive anybody out of anything get what I want I have that ability just gifted with it you know what we all were we knew how to connive something out of mom or dad or vice versa depending on the mood 1 John 3:16 hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren honestly I wasn't born with that nature I don't quite know how to do that I was told I need to do it but how do I do it I learn to you to the Lord basically all you're doing is Lending your body over to God God comes inside and does it for you amen that's how it happens in Simplicity it's not you mustering up a different nature you just yielding Your Vessel to the nature that's already there and he does it for you it's beautiful staying in love with Christ is essential and vital in this hour and we're we're getting ready to close because it's getting late St John chap 15: 10 if you love me keep my Commandments if ye I'm sorry if you keep my Commandments ye shall abide in my love so as soon as you stop commanding doing the Commandments of God you step out of love talking about love relationship even as I have kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love uh verse number four the same chapter 15:4 abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can you except you abide in me so we have to stay connected in this love relationship with God not just a relationship not just church attendance not just paying ties come on it's love relationship because that's what it's all about when Jesus addresses the condition of this church he's talking to the messenger of leoda it's a oblique situation the church wasn't filled with people holding up to God's terms and conditions if I could say it like this they were not reading the fine print there was ministers who were just preaching the this the skim or the the the the easy things of the Gospel the feeling good of God's presence the gifts even come on but we're not talking about the will of God they weren't acting right they weren't dressing right they weren't even believing right it was a bleak condition when the messenger was preaching he had a hard job telling the church where they were at in their relationship with God that's really what this message is when he's speaking he's speaking to the Church of Leia now of course in that message he's calling out a bride he's calling out the bride and he's dressing the bride but he's calling her out of the church amen the Church of leoda it's a pretty hopeless condition that's why we got to come out of it that church was naked they did not even realize that the things that they were believing were nothing they were invisible to God they going to hold up no water with God they didn't know that their own personal belief wasn't adequate for a relationship with God you know how many times you're talking to some and the first thing one of the things they say is well the way that I think the way that I believe the way that I see it those words do not mean anything it's really what the word says it's what Jesus said it's what's re what's between the pages of this book it's it's what what what the prophet said amen I'll say the Church of leoda Jesus called them blind they can't even see their own spiritual condition and the Bible tells us that the God of this evil age has has blinded the minds of them which what believe not they didn't do the first step they didn't believe and if you don't believe you become blinded God will never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever born you blind it's a choice that you make he told those disciples if you would say that I'm blind then you would see but since you say you see you're blind it's a it's a it's a choice it's a condition but there's a little flock in this age fear not little flock it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom that God is preparing a bride for a Rapture amen she's the one that that has ears to hear I want to leave you with this last condition that God gave to the church in Revelations 3: 22 he says he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches he that have an ear in other words everybody don't have an ear can you imagine if you came into church today and half of the people that came in did not have ears yeah that would look funny that would look weird that would be sad break our hearts but there are a lot of people in church who don't have ears they they have ears to hear what they want to hear and if they don't hear what they want to hear they're going to go somewhere else there's only a small group of people that have ears to hear what the spirit is saying what the Holy Ghost is saying and that ear has everything to do with desire like if I was to go ahead you're all I'm GNA clap my hands GNA be kind of loud so if I go everybody heard that like it or not they heard it because of these natural ears but spiritually when God is speaking we it's not like that he just doesn't speak and everybody hears it that sound has everything to do with desire it's condition of the horor Lord I got to hear from you today it's a hunger it's a thirst it's a it's a realness of the relationship and then you get to hear his voice it's a still Small Voice that he's speaking to the church today and it's personal it has nothing to do with me it has nothing to do with the person that sits next to you it has nothing to do with your spouse nothing to do with your best friend it has nothing to do with anything it's God reserves that between you and him and he's he leaves the church with these last words he that hasn't here I tell you if I wasn't hearing from the Lord it would make me desperate it would make me say God I'm not hearing you I need to hear from you I need to I need you Lord what more do I need to do so I can hear you do I gota do I gotta get come to pray more maybe I need to pray more I can't force God to speak to me sorry about that clap I didn't mean to scare anybody there you can't force God to do that you speak to me no it's a love affair it's all about desire and want I'll say today if you're Desiring and you're wanting God you will hear his voice and it may be as subtle as this boy I heard a whole sermon and I'm not sure if I heard from God well if you heard him to get serious about the terms and conditions you heard from God I don't think God expects us to you know hear this whole thing grab this whole thing every time we come to church it's hard there's a lot of information but I'll say it like this the reason that the sermons are the way they are is because I want you to catch a picture that's throughout the Bible it's it's a theme it's there it's real it's not just a little thought we've got to back up what we're saying so I'll say start out with just Lord I heard you speak to me to get serious about the terms and conditions and I want to start walking in that direction that's all you need to do do God will give you the next step don't get hard to the word allow your heart to be soft stand together now find for me one of the hardest things is I feel like I got three lives it can't be as simple as just you know I used to burn the candle at five different ends now I don't care how much I try they just fizzle out about 6:30 no matter how much I want to burn them no matter how much I want to do I just got to wait till the next day brother Stan knows what I'm talking about you can only go so far so much but I still got the same responsibilities that I did before and so it takes me so much longer to get anything done one of the hardest things I have for me is getting and spending time alone with the Lord just me and him oh I have to force myself just to get to study in the message to get prepared for church but set this thing aside Lord this is just between me and you what you want me to do one of the hardest things for me to do is just spend time with the Lord to get direction for my life the pressure we've got to make time we've got to we've got to carve out more time you see what the devil has done in this age with the covid all the fear and all the things that is happening just gets us so distracted and then we're looking for some sort of place of normality and trying to get involved more at the holidays and the the family and staying connected and and all these things and every one of these is taking us away from the Lord if there's ever an hour that we need to press in this is the hour we need to come together with purpose with a closer walk with the Lord with staying connected I think it was brother Mark was telling me yesterday you know brother John it just seems like it's been so long since I've been to church we missed one service but look how it affects you that's why I feel so so bad for those that haven't been here in a while it's got to be hard amen make a pledge with me to take God's terms and conditions sign on the line Lord I'm willing teach me your way amen let's look to him in prayer with every head bowed every eye closed maybe there's someone here today says brother John would you remember me today God knows what's on my heart pray for me God bless these hands God sees your heart so beautiful Heavenly Father Lord I Thank You above everything for a relationship with you it surpasses religion and opinions and thoughts and ideas to where Lord your word declares that the foundation of God stand is sure you know them that are yours Lord and you're calling us to turn towards you with more of Our Lives Lord as we've looked deeper or just as it were touched on the terms and conditions that is in the fine print of your word Lord we see that there's certainly many things that you have for us yet today and Lord we're thankful for church and we're thankful that we could come here and be here in your presence God we know that what you're really asking us is to to take you home with us today spend time applying the things that you've brought to us Lord I pray that you'd richly lovingly caringly look down upon the hearts of those that lifted their hands today Lord there was a desire there something special something very special it was between you and them and Lord You're you know every single one of those desires all at the same time because you're God and I humbly pray Lord that you would meet that need according to your re es in glory Lord whatever it is that they're asking whatever it is that they're Desiring may you give them that Assurance as they believe you today as they hold to this prayer Lord you said if just two or three would agree on touching any one thing it would be established establish this Lord establish Our Lives Lord let our our our think the way that we view things shift from from this immature way of of living of believing to a more mature way of living for others Lord I pray that you'd fill every one of us so full of the Holy Ghost so much power will we not be affected by the things that's happening in this world Lord let your people leave here here energized Lord with a a charge in their battery as it were Lord to about to combat all the doubts and the the the the battles that they are going through Lord some here need uh finances Lord to to help meet their needs some need a a a a better job some here need health some need a Deliverance Lord God we are a people with many needs but you're our God that's able to do exceedingly above all that we would ask or even think Lord You're a mighty God today we know in whom we believed and we're persuaded that you're able to keep us Lord father bless your people as they seek you as they spend time with you as they build in that relationship with you as they Things become more and more real let them hear that still small voice speak to them personally Lord as you're building your church up we love you we thank you for these things Lord we commit ourselves a little church in your hands Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ we thank you and give you the glory for it amen amen we give the glory to Jesus and tell of his love and tell of his love will give the glory to Jesus and of his on
