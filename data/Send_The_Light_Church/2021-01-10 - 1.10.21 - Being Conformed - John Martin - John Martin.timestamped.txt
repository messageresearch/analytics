[15:20] please continue to pray for
[15:23] aunt surely she has uh battling the
[15:26] covet and
[15:27] is still feeling very she's feeling very
[15:29] alone
[15:30] and then um i believe that's
[15:34] you know in a in a sense you know this
[15:36] covet i think is
[15:37] uh there's you know many losses from
[15:40] coveted here and
[15:41] everybody at some point has felt some
[15:44] touch of the covet in their life
[15:46] um you know not only does it leave you
[15:49] alone
[15:51] but because of it you know there's
[15:53] nobody that come and come and
[15:55] come and see you and everything and i
[15:57] think it's like almost like a prelude to
[15:59] hell
[16:00] you know because hell's gonna be a
[16:02] lonely place
[16:04] because god ain't gonna be there and
[16:08] so let's just you know pray for all
[16:12] those that's had it

[16:32] so let's just pray for that also mike
[16:35] has requests
[16:37] that god would speak to his daughter

[16:47] thing
[16:48] and they have daughters and all larry
[16:50] does we do
[16:52] and uh i know you know everybody here
[16:55] has a loved one that's not under the
[16:57] safety of the ark amen so let's just
[17:00] pray for that
[17:01] amen so i was also pray for all the
[17:03] missionaries throughout the world
[17:05] uh let's continue to pray for our the
[17:08] new church and
[17:09] uh let's pray you know that things go
[17:12] well

[34:12] of his son that he might be the
[34:15] firstborn
[34:16] among all of us amen god bless you may

[34:43] god of order amen today
[34:47] we want to take a little break uh from
[34:50] that

[35:01] and listen to the one prior because this
[35:04] is for our church amen
[35:10] today
[35:14] we want to take a fall in our opening
[35:17] scriptures here about being conformed
[35:21] and i got looking on uh on the internet
[35:25] it appeared to me
[35:26] that um yesterday
[35:30] on january 9 2007
[35:33] is when steve jobs introduced
[35:37] the first iphone
[35:41] the iphone put the internet in
[35:44] everyone's pocket course we know what
[35:46] the devil
[35:47] had in mind with that when steve jobs
[35:50] first
[35:51] unveiled the iphone he described it as a
[35:54] revolutionary
[35:56] mobile phone the original iphone
[35:59] set the stage for modern smartphones
[36:01] ushering
[36:02] in an error which pocket-sized
[36:05] touchscreens
[36:07] computers are the norm so look how it
[36:10] it kind of changed things
[36:14] another thing happened on that same day
[36:16] but it was 231 years before that
[36:20] on january 9 1776
[36:23] the writer thomas paine published the
[36:25] pamphlet
[36:26] common sense setting forth his arguments
[36:30] in favor of american independence
[36:34] and although little used today
[36:37] pamphlets were an important medium for
[36:40] the spread of the ideas in the 16th
[36:42] through the 19th centuries originally
[36:45] published anonymously
[36:47] common sense advocated the independence
[36:49] for american colonies
[36:51] from britain and is considered one of
[36:53] the most influential
[36:54] pamphlets in american history credited
[36:57] with
[36:57] uh uniting average citizens and
[37:00] political leaders
[37:02] behind the idea of independence much
[37:04] different than today
[37:08] sense played in a remarkable role in
[37:10] transforming
[37:12] a colonial squabble into the american
[37:16] revolution pain fundamentally
[37:20] changed the terror of the uh the tenor
[37:23] i'm sorry not the terror the tenor
[37:25] of the colonist argument with the crown
[37:28] when he wrote the following
[37:30] this new world have been
[37:34] a solemn for the pro for the persecuted
[37:38] lovers
[37:38] of civil and religious liberty
[37:41] from every part of europe
[37:45] how things have changed
[37:51] common sense today is that the world
[37:54] is insane
[37:59] people are wondering if there's going to
[38:01] be a second american
[38:03] revolution
[38:06] i know people today who are buying
[38:08] unregistered guns
[38:12] because of the unknown and i'm talking
[38:15] automated
[38:15] weaponry elon musk
[38:19] now the world's richest person is
[38:21] selling all his possessions so people
[38:23] know
[38:23] he's serious about putting a colony
[38:27] on mars
[38:30] he's serious about it he he he's he
[38:33] uh he wants to die there but he doesn't
[38:36] want to die when he lands right he
[38:39] doesn't want to die from a crash landing
[38:40] there
[38:41] but he wants to it's amazing how
[38:43] everybody just wants to be god of
[38:45] something
[38:49] ann had sent me a quote yesterday he
[38:52] says if you're
[38:53] a common sense person you probably don't
[38:56] feel you have a home in this world right
[38:58] now
[39:00] and if you're a christian you know where
[39:02] you never were meant
[39:04] to our home is from another place amen
[39:09] the world has fallen apart the hope for
[39:13] a better future
[39:14] is becoming extinct with the realization
[39:17] that the world
[39:18] is running out of control satan knows he
[39:22] has but a short
[39:23] time left and is manifesting
[39:26] lawlessness throughout the world
[39:30] brother brandon preached the world is
[39:31] falling apart
[39:34] today we can say the world has fallen
[39:36] apart
[39:38] people are rapidly losing hope for their
[39:40] future as they watch
[39:42] the world unravel into a complete
[39:45] insanity there's no hope for this world
[39:49] there's no chance of things coming back
[39:52] or
[39:52] or working out for their good
[39:57] but a bible believer's hope isn't in
[40:00] this world or this world's leaders
[40:04] even if you get a halfway decent leader
[40:07] in office satan
[40:08] will make sure he moves the rest of the
[40:10] world to get him out of there
[40:14] satan is the god of this evil age
[40:18] and he's conforming people to the
[40:20] pinnacle
[40:21] of his selfish nature i want you to
[40:23] catch that
[40:25] he's moving the world to become
[40:28] so selfish so full of hate for one
[40:31] another
[40:34] that they're willing to kill to get what
[40:36] they want
[40:40] brother or brother ron said earlier
[40:42] today he said that god has an agenda no
[40:44] matter what's going on in this world
[40:46] god's got an agenda i like to title this
[40:50] message being conformed
[40:52] and for a subject be not conformed to
[40:54] this world
[40:55] but into the image of god we're being
[40:58] conformed one way or the other paul said
[41:00] be not conformed to this world because
[41:02] that we've been predestinated to be
[41:04] conformed to the image of jesus christ
[41:08] and to those who understand
[41:09] predestination means
[41:11] we still have a part to play we don't
[41:14] lay back and do whatever we want to do
[41:15] no sir because if we do we're just going
[41:18] to fall
[41:18] to the conformity of this world we must
[41:22] allow
[41:22] the mind of christ which is the word of
[41:25] god to come inside of us
[41:27] transform the way that we think into the
[41:29] mind of christ
[41:30] that our whole life can be conformed
[41:34] into
[41:35] what we've been predestined to be
[41:36] conformed to and that's jesus christ
[41:44] it's there if there was ever a time that
[41:46] we needed to get serious about a
[41:48] relationship with god now say
[41:50] our love relationship with god this is
[41:52] the hour
[41:54] god is revolutionizing his bride
[42:00] he's changing her radically
[42:04] little by little line upon line word
[42:06] upon word
[42:08] isaiah chapter 9 verse 5 for isaiah
[42:11] chapter 9 verse
[42:12] 5 for every battle of a warrior
[42:16] i think there's another war coming i
[42:18] really believe that
[42:21] for every battle of a warrior is with
[42:24] confused noise we know armageddon's
[42:26] coming don't we
[42:28] and garments rolled in blood they said
[42:30] the blood will be so high
[42:33] it'll be at the the horse's bridle the
[42:36] blood
[42:37] will be that that much blood in that
[42:40] valley
[42:43] for every battle of a warrior is with
[42:45] confused noise and garments rolled in
[42:47] blood
[42:48] but this shall be
[42:51] with a burning and a few of fire
[42:55] for unto us a child is born unto us
[42:59] a son is given the government shall be
[43:01] upon his shoulders
[43:03] and his name shall be called wonderful
[43:05] counselor the mighty god
[43:06] the everlasting father and the prince of
[43:10] peace
[43:12] there's another way to win a battle
[43:16] remember when peter wanted to draw his
[43:17] sword jesus says put that away
[43:21] he even had to testify to to to pilot
[43:24] if or who i i'm pretty sure it was
[43:26] pilots is that my
[43:28] subjects were of this world that they
[43:29] would have have fought but they're not
[43:31] of this world we don't
[43:33] battle against flesh and blood
[43:36] it's a spiritual warfare
[43:39] while the world is fighting the devil
[43:42] from the outside
[43:44] the bride is fighting the devil from the
[43:47] inside
[43:50] the world is fighting the devil in
[43:52] everyone else
[43:55] right this political party says this and
[43:59] that political party says this this
[44:02] country says it's that country
[44:03] that country says is that country
[44:08] the world is fighting the devil and
[44:09] everyone else but the bride is
[44:11] overcoming the devil inside of her
[44:15] and i'll tell you that's the most
[44:17] important place
[44:19] how is she doing it with a fire of the
[44:23] holy ghost
[44:25] it's burning up all the dross all the
[44:27] world all that
[44:28] is that evil nature amen that she was
[44:32] born with
[44:34] she's continuing to be born again
[44:38] and when the holy ghost comes he will
[44:40] reprove the world
[44:42] of sin his job is to let us know
[44:47] what isn't like christ inside of us
[44:52] now the benefit of falling in love with
[44:54] jesus
[44:55] and working according to his eternal
[44:57] purpose
[44:58] is that all things are going to work
[44:59] together for the good regardless of what
[45:01] happens to you
[45:03] in this world or the rest of the world
[45:07] it really doesn't matter
[45:10] the world doesn't have assurance that
[45:13] things are working out for it's good
[45:17] you talk to people out there and they
[45:20] they don't have anything but the world
[45:22] to rely on and that's why they're
[45:24] getting more down and more depressed
[45:27] didn't
[45:29] but the bride does she has a revelation
[45:32] of the assurance
[45:35] that no matter what happens to her
[45:38] to her she is in a place
[45:41] she's fulfilling the purpose of god she
[45:45] knows that everything's going to work
[45:46] out for the good
[45:47] amen and we know that all things work
[45:50] together for the good
[45:51] to them that love god to them who are
[45:54] the called
[45:55] according to his purpose
[45:58] she not only is in love with god but
[46:01] she's found her
[46:02] calling in god's purpose
[46:06] brother branham said in the message
[46:07] stand still he said hell
[46:10] will be made up of church members
[46:14] wow hell will be made up of church
[46:18] members no wonder he could preach
[46:20] there's three types of believers
[46:22] in every church in the message the un
[46:26] unconditional covenant that god made
[46:29] with
[46:29] the people brother braham says you might
[46:32] live
[46:33] good all your life
[46:36] and you go to hell
[46:40] brother in the message christ is
[46:42] revealed in his own word
[46:44] he says you can love and even love god
[46:48] and still not be right
[46:54] we need more than just to love god we
[46:57] need to be called according to his
[46:58] purpose
[47:01] loving god is crucial but it varies from
[47:03] person to person from believer
[47:05] to believer but loving god with all your
[47:09] heart with all
[47:10] your mind with all your spirit all your
[47:12] soul
[47:13] that's really what's commanded of us
[47:16] it's a it's a degree of love that goes
[47:19] beyond
[47:21] it's the highest degree of love
[47:24] would anybody get excited i i you know
[47:26] we all have
[47:27] things that we like about somebody right
[47:30] especially if you've
[47:31] looked uh on on movies or
[47:36] movie stars actresses uh actors
[47:39] um you know all the vain people the
[47:42] singers and all that stuff
[47:43] that we we kind of like the way they
[47:45] sing
[47:46] you know when they're talking you really
[47:49] like that little part they do
[47:50] and whatever it might be we all have
[47:52] those little things
[47:55] would you i mean just if we just had
[47:57] like a little chance right now
[47:59] everything's kind of blank and you get
[48:00] to move forward and marry
[48:02] or get to you marry whoever you want and
[48:04] just pick them out yeah they've checked
[48:06] lists
[48:08] and you got exactly what you're you're
[48:09] looking for would you want
[48:11] to marry that person if there was a part
[48:13] of them that
[48:14] really didn't love you
[48:17] just a part
[48:21] i think god is looking for a bride
[48:24] that loves him with all her heart
[48:28] regardless
[48:31] that's why we can't be satisfied with i
[48:33] love god
[48:35] amen can be satisfied with that amen
[48:38] we've got to live according to god's
[48:41] purpose because
[48:44] we've been predestinated
[48:49] to fulfill god's purpose we've been
[48:52] predestinated
[48:54] if we don't we don't have the confidence
[48:58] because it's only half of the
[48:59] relationship or part of the relationship
[49:04] oh i i love brother mark but i'm not
[49:07] going to
[49:08] you know do things for him i'm not going
[49:10] to be nice to him i'm not going but i
[49:12] still love him
[49:14] this just doesn't make sense to me
[49:18] we may view god as having many purposes
[49:23] he has a purpose for your life and my
[49:26] life he has a purpose
[49:27] for you working at your job he has a
[49:29] purpose for me working at my job
[49:31] perhaps he has a purpose for the house
[49:33] that you live in
[49:34] and and he has a purpose for the house
[49:36] that i live in
[49:38] but i want to focus this morning on
[49:40] god's eternal
[49:42] purpose not just one of many purposes
[49:47] but the one purpose that is the same for
[49:49] you and i
[49:50] for every one of us it's the same thing
[49:53] paul describes
[49:54] a mystery in ephesians chapter 3 and if
[49:57] you ever get time read chapters one
[49:58] through three
[50:00] but paul describes a mystery in
[50:02] ephesians chapter three
[50:04] which was hid from the foundation of the
[50:06] world and was recently made known just
[50:08] two thousand years ago
[50:11] that the gentiles should be fellow heirs
[50:14] of the same body
[50:15] and paul calls this an eternal
[50:19] purpose god wanted to take out a bride
[50:22] out of the gentiles for his wife she
[50:26] would be chosen of him or elected
[50:29] by him
[50:33] i want you i got three different quotes
[50:35] from three different church ages
[50:38] i love this all talking about the same
[50:40] thing
[50:41] in the sumerian church age brother
[50:42] branham says you can't
[50:44] read it any other way the heart purpose
[50:46] now he calls it the heart purpose get
[50:49] right down to the middle of the purpose
[50:51] the heart purpose
[50:52] the eternal purpose of god was to take a
[50:55] bride of his own choosing and that
[50:58] purpose was
[50:59] in himself in other words he purposed it
[51:01] in himself
[51:03] as being eternal and was decreed
[51:06] before the foundation of the world
[51:10] so god had this all inside of him way
[51:13] before anything was created
[51:16] watch carefully now and and see this
[51:19] before there
[51:20] was ever a speck of stardust before god
[51:23] was god god is an object of adoration
[51:27] and no one
[51:27] was there to worship him so he was at
[51:31] that time only potentially god and
[51:34] he was known only as an eternal spirit
[51:37] the bride
[51:38] was already in his mind
[51:44] yes she was she was existing in his
[51:46] thoughts
[51:48] and what about those thoughts of god
[51:50] they
[51:51] are eternal are they not he said
[51:54] the eternal thoughts of god
[51:58] and the message the ephesian church age
[52:00] brother branham says now
[52:01] the word must definitely set forth that
[52:04] form
[52:06] set forth that from before the
[52:09] foundation of the earth
[52:11] the purpose of god was to share
[52:14] his eternal life with man
[52:20] i wasn't satisfied with just
[52:23] angels who never fell there was
[52:26] something
[52:27] about the appreciation of some human
[52:30] being
[52:30] that was born in sin and would
[52:33] appreciate him through eternity
[52:37] that god wanted to feel and express
[52:40] have that expressed to him and that's
[52:42] why god
[52:43] never likes coming into a cold former
[52:46] church
[52:47] god wants a church on fire that loves
[52:49] them will worship him in spirit and
[52:51] truth
[52:55] in the message the sardarian church age
[52:57] brother brahm said
[52:58] it was god's purpose to bring forth
[53:02] a people like unto himself that would be
[53:05] a
[53:05] word bride she was chosen
[53:09] before the foundation of the world in
[53:11] him so this is really
[53:13] between you and god it is not between
[53:18] you god and the person you're sitting
[53:19] next to or between
[53:21] you and your pastor it's between you and
[53:24] god this situation
[53:26] it didn't have anything to do with the
[53:27] angels it didn't have anything to do
[53:28] with lucifer
[53:29] didn't have anything to do with anybody
[53:32] except god god's desire god's purpose
[53:36] amen and all things work together for
[53:39] the good to them that love god
[53:40] and who are the called according to his
[53:43] purpose
[53:47] god's mind is still on his
[53:50] eternal purpose today
[53:56] chapter 2 verse 5 says let this mind be
[53:58] in you
[53:59] which was also in christ jesus
[54:04] was not the mind of christ to fulfill
[54:07] the father's will i do nothing except
[54:09] what pleases the father
[54:11] the father loveth me because i laid on
[54:13] my life
[54:15] he was working with the purpose
[54:18] the eternal purpose of god
[54:21] it hasn't stopped it has not stopped
[54:24] the holy ghost is the mind of christ
[54:27] john 14
[54:28] 26 but the comforter which is the holy
[54:30] ghost whom the father will send in my
[54:32] name
[54:33] he shall teach you all things
[54:38] i don't think he's and bring all things
[54:41] to your remembrance whatsoever
[54:42] i have said unto you amen you just go
[54:45] back and look at all the words
[54:47] in red and that's exactly what the holy
[54:50] ghost
[54:51] is speaking and bringing to your
[54:53] remembrance amen
[54:56] did not he say go ye out
[55:00] did not he say terry in jerusalem until
[55:02] you being due with power for mine
[55:07] did not he say i give you power
[55:13] this is what he brings to our
[55:14] remembrance this is the mind of christ
[55:18] look what happens when we get the holy
[55:20] ghost
[55:21] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 9
[55:26] because that's what really matters i
[55:28] want
[55:29] proof i have to prove what is that good
[55:32] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[55:34] to prove what the purpose of god is
[55:37] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 9
[55:39] says wherefore we labor that whether we
[55:42] be present
[55:43] or absent we may be accepted of him it
[55:46] is impossible to be accepted
[55:48] by god if you don't labor
[55:55] naturally speaking naturally you
[55:58] shouldn't eat
[55:59] if you don't work is what the scripture
[56:01] says
[56:02] spiritually it's no different if we
[56:05] don't
[56:06] partake of the will of god the purpose
[56:09] of god
[56:10] do the things that god has told us to do
[56:14] we're not going to be accepted for we
[56:17] must all appear before the judgment seat
[56:19] of christ
[56:20] that every one of you may receive the
[56:21] things that he's done in his body
[56:22] according to what i have done whether it
[56:24] be good or bad
[56:25] knowing therefore the terror of the lord
[56:30] we try to be a good person and be uh you
[56:33] know
[56:34] a good christian and be nice to one
[56:36] another and uh
[56:38] no that's not what it says
[56:41] is this knowing that we're all going to
[56:43] stand before god
[56:45] and be judged we better get busy
[56:49] persuading other people
[56:52] but we are made manifest unto god and i
[56:55] trust also may manifest to your
[56:57] conscience
[56:58] for we commend not ourselves to get unto
[57:00] you but
[57:01] give you occasion to glory on our behalf
[57:03] that ye may know somewhat to answer
[57:05] them which glory and appearance and not
[57:07] in heart but whether we be beside
[57:09] ourselves
[57:10] it is to god or it would be sober it is
[57:12] for your cause
[57:13] for the love
[57:16] of christ it constrains us
[57:22] i hope you're not here today because
[57:24] it's
[57:25] church and you have to be here or you're
[57:28] afraid you're going to get a phone call
[57:29] from somebody
[57:34] if the love of god is not constraining
[57:36] you to be here
[57:37] you need to be working on your
[57:40] love relationship
[57:44] because there is no way that i'm going
[57:46] to be able to stand before god on the
[57:48] day of judgment
[57:49] and say look out of the 1600
[57:53] different times i had a chance to go to
[57:55] church i made it
[57:56] 15 950.
[58:00] is that good enough
[58:04] i think he's interested in my love
[58:06] affair
[58:08] a love affair now that love affair will
[58:10] constrain you to come to church
[58:15] i don't want to get a church order right
[58:17] now but we will be getting into that
[58:19] forsaking not the sampling of ourselves
[58:22] together
[58:22] and what all the more how many sees the
[58:25] day approaching
[58:27] this world's going insane and this is
[58:30] making it even harder for people to come
[58:32] to church they got more excuses
[58:38] it's the love of christ that constrains
[58:40] me to be here
[58:44] because we thus judge that if one died
[58:46] for all then we're all dead and
[58:47] that he died for all that they which
[58:50] live should not henceforth
[58:52] live unto themselves
[58:55] you know when you're not here and you
[58:57] could be you're living
[58:59] for yourself don't you tell me
[59:03] this came up and that came up that's
[59:05] okay
[59:06] once in a blue blue
[59:09] moon but after a while your blue moons
[59:13] are happening every month
[59:17] so every month's a blue moon
[59:25] amen and that if he died for all that
[59:28] they which
[59:29] live should not henceforth live unto
[59:30] themselves but unto him that died for
[59:32] them and rose again
[59:33] wherefore henceforth we know no man
[59:36] after the flesh yeah though we have
[59:37] known christ after the flesh
[59:38] yep no more no more
[59:42] we don't look at jesus in some
[59:46] natural carnal
[59:49] fleshly way
[59:53] it's a spiritual relationship when the
[59:56] when jesus comes into your heart
[59:59] verse 17 says therefore if any man be
[1:00:02] in christ if jesus comes into your heart
[1:00:07] he is a new creature
[1:00:10] old things have gone by by
[1:00:15] behold all things are fresh
[1:00:19] our new are exciting
[1:00:22] are different are changing
[1:00:26] and you know it's not like we're in the
[1:00:27] world
[1:00:29] and i know brother marty you know
[1:00:31] brother marty and i could really sit
[1:00:33] together
[1:00:34] and who knows i know when i was
[1:00:36] listening to the moody boos
[1:00:39] it was you know dark
[1:00:44] and uh moody exactly well said sister
[1:00:48] well said but when i get done that it
[1:00:52] isn't like you change from that music to
[1:00:54] neil diamond yeah
[1:00:56] or to seals and crawf or kenny rogers or
[1:01:02] that's the same old old there's just a
[1:01:06] lot to choose from in the broad way
[1:01:08] but when you become a new creature it's
[1:01:11] a new spirit
[1:01:13] you feed on new things it's a new
[1:01:16] message in the music
[1:01:18] amen it's a message of hope amen
[1:01:22] a message that makes you want to lay
[1:01:23] down your life not feel like i'm so
[1:01:25] cool and tough
[1:01:29] it's a different message therefore if
[1:01:33] any man be in christ he's a new creature
[1:01:35] old things are passed away
[1:01:36] behold all things are become new
[1:01:39] well what's so different about this
[1:01:41] newness verse 18 tells us
[1:01:44] all things are of god now
[1:01:48] different message in the music
[1:01:52] who have reconciled us to himself
[1:01:56] by jesus christ
[1:02:00] he reconciled us to himself by jesus
[1:02:02] christ
[1:02:03] in other words we've been predestinated
[1:02:07] to be conformed to the image of jesus
[1:02:10] christ
[1:02:11] he's reconciled us to himself but it
[1:02:15] doesn't stop there there's not a period
[1:02:17] we don't go on to another subject
[1:02:20] there's a comma
[1:02:21] and there's an an and it says and have
[1:02:24] given to
[1:02:24] us a the ministry of reconciliation
[1:02:28] that is exactly the same ministry that
[1:02:31] jesus had when he was on earth
[1:02:35] to wit that god was in christ
[1:02:37] reconciling the world to himself
[1:02:39] and not imputing their trespasses onto
[1:02:41] them we're not interested
[1:02:43] in in telling people about their
[1:02:46] their trespasses and saying you're going
[1:02:48] to hell bye
[1:02:50] no we want to let people know that the
[1:02:53] situation the condition that they're in
[1:02:55] is that there is a reconciliation for
[1:03:00] you
[1:03:04] god has committed unto us now
[1:03:07] the word of reconciliation i'm telling
[1:03:09] you saints
[1:03:10] this is the eternal purpose of god
[1:03:14] god did not stop with me brother mark
[1:03:16] and said oh yes
[1:03:17] i got my bride i don't care about
[1:03:21] anybody else
[1:03:24] what kind of spirit would that be you
[1:03:26] know what that would be
[1:03:28] that's a selfish spirit
[1:03:31] that's i'm saved that's all that matters
[1:03:35] can you imagine jesus i'm not going to
[1:03:38] cross
[1:03:39] i'm saved that's all that matters
[1:03:42] i'm not i don't need to die i'm saved
[1:03:47] but because he looked at you
[1:03:51] knew you wouldn't get to be with him he
[1:03:53] was willing to suffer
[1:03:55] if that same god lives in you won't he
[1:03:58] feel the same way today
[1:04:04] that's his eternal purpose you want
[1:04:07] things to work out for the good
[1:04:10] you're called to that purpose not your
[1:04:13] own purposes
[1:04:15] not your private purposes i'm talking
[1:04:18] about an eternal purpose that was in the
[1:04:20] mind of god before
[1:04:22] anything was ever created you were there
[1:04:25] but not only you the people you should
[1:04:28] be talking to
[1:04:29] the people you should be reaching out to
[1:04:32] the people that don't know him yet
[1:04:34] you've been given a ministry of
[1:04:35] reconciliation
[1:04:37] but brother john it's a little bit hard
[1:04:39] with this coping and i don't even you
[1:04:40] know i can't even really you know go to
[1:04:42] the store today
[1:04:43] i can't even like eat a wrap you know
[1:04:44] what get the heart of god god will make
[1:04:47] a way
[1:04:47] he'll work through your texting he'll
[1:04:49] work through your prayers
[1:04:51] he'll work through your phone he'll work
[1:04:53] through you if you're willing if you got
[1:04:55] that burden
[1:04:57] if the ministry is inside of you he'll
[1:04:59] use that ministry
[1:05:02] but you know the problem is
[1:05:05] we need more holy ghosts that's what the
[1:05:06] problem is
[1:05:10] we just need more holy ghost amen
[1:05:14] more of god did not the prophet said if
[1:05:16] he could just get one man
[1:05:18] in his hands what he could do lord have
[1:05:22] thine own way have your way
[1:05:23] fill me with your spirit amen
[1:05:30] it's not for somebody else to do when
[1:05:33] you have that
[1:05:34] thought you're saying god you're not
[1:05:37] worthy of me giving myself to you
[1:05:41] it's exactly what you're saying
[1:05:45] if i was gonna hire brother mark to come
[1:05:47] work for me
[1:05:49] he stepped his steps inside the door
[1:05:52] and he says i'm here to work but i just
[1:05:54] want to let you know
[1:05:56] i'm going to do what i want to do
[1:05:59] i'm going to labor the way i want to
[1:06:01] labor
[1:06:02] choose my kind of jobs it's a lot of
[1:06:05] christians today
[1:06:06] i'm going to serve god my way according
[1:06:10] to my purpose
[1:06:13] oh i love him i know but you got to get
[1:06:16] called according to his purpose
[1:06:19] this is his purpose it hasn't stopped
[1:06:22] because as soon as somebody gets filled
[1:06:23] with the holy ghost in 2020
[1:06:25] god puts them on fire to serve him
[1:06:28] to win souls he gives them a ministry of
[1:06:31] reconciliation
[1:06:33] it ain't just for us friends
[1:06:38] when we get to heaven there's going to
[1:06:39] be other people there just as important
[1:06:41] as you
[1:06:42] part of the same family
[1:06:52] when we receive god the holy ghost
[1:06:55] become
[1:06:55] born again a new creature god puts us in
[1:06:58] harmony
[1:06:59] with his eternal purpose
[1:07:03] and you may not feel like it but you
[1:07:04] should say amen to that
[1:07:07] and he gives us the same ministry of
[1:07:09] jesus christ
[1:07:10] reconciling others back to god giving
[1:07:13] them
[1:07:14] eternal life that's what you possess
[1:07:16] inside of you
[1:07:17] why would you want to hang on to that
[1:07:18] and say it's all for you
[1:07:22] i don't deserve to have it i don't
[1:07:24] deserve to stand here today i don't
[1:07:26] deserve to say anything
[1:07:28] i'm just as evil and rotten amen
[1:07:31] who am i to stand here and tell somebody
[1:07:33] what they need to do
[1:07:38] i should be there and honestly there
[1:07:41] ain't a minister standing
[1:07:46] amen he chose the foolishness of
[1:07:48] preaching to save men
[1:07:49] amen he took a a a vessel
[1:07:53] that's not right not perfect
[1:07:58] to bring perfection to a bride
[1:08:03] so that this ministry is not
[1:08:06] of man this ministry is of god
[1:08:10] the word is of god
[1:08:13] he would not share his glory with a
[1:08:15] human being
[1:08:18] look what happened on the day of
[1:08:19] pentecost they all
[1:08:22] received the ministry of reconciliation
[1:08:25] as soon as they were filled with the
[1:08:26] holy ghost
[1:08:29] amen he sent them out
[1:08:32] immediately gave him the furtherance
[1:08:35] of his ministry
[1:08:40] he didn't say now you boys you you go
[1:08:44] have your own ministry out there
[1:08:47] no he didn't do that he said you wait
[1:08:50] till you get filled with me
[1:08:52] and then you'll know how to properly
[1:08:53] witness
[1:08:55] you know how to stand the test
[1:08:58] they exercised and used
[1:09:02] and brought souls to jesus with the
[1:09:05] ministry
[1:09:07] they just didn't say we believed in it
[1:09:09] they actually walked in it
[1:09:11] they actually used the ministry the
[1:09:13] exorcist they gave their life
[1:09:15] and produced souls were added to the
[1:09:18] church
[1:09:20] daily daily you mean i got to think
[1:09:23] about i
[1:09:24] i'm so used to just thinking about this
[1:09:26] stuff when i come to church brother john
[1:09:31] get filled with god you can't get it off
[1:09:32] your mind
[1:09:35] get renewed in the spirit get a fresh
[1:09:37] anointing
[1:09:39] it's there
[1:09:42] look what happened to paul born out of
[1:09:46] due season
[1:09:48] yet when the new birth took place in his
[1:09:50] life he unselfishly became
[1:09:52] all things to all men for the purpose of
[1:09:55] winning
[1:09:55] some of them amen
[1:09:59] it's the purpose of god being fulfilled
[1:10:03] and he was so in love with this
[1:10:06] situation
[1:10:06] that he wasn't discouraged by sufferings
[1:10:09] by afflictions
[1:10:13] today in 2021 god's purpose is still
[1:10:17] moving forward
[1:10:19] did not we sing that song brother ron
[1:10:24] that song about battle hymn of the
[1:10:26] republic
[1:10:27] his truth is marching forward his
[1:10:30] ministry is marching forward
[1:10:32] amen the holy spirit will always put you
[1:10:35] in harmony
[1:10:37] with god's eternal purpose of getting
[1:10:39] the rest
[1:10:40] of your family saved
[1:10:45] and getting his bride ready for him it
[1:10:48] always will
[1:10:50] i come from a larger family not myself
[1:10:52] but i mean i had some
[1:10:54] a few children
[1:10:57] and it always stuck in my mind
[1:11:00] those who were always trying to help the
[1:11:03] others
[1:11:04] versus those who only cared about
[1:11:08] [Music]
[1:11:10] themselves
[1:11:15] do you think anyone in the bride
[1:11:19] is not going to care about others
[1:11:25] here's abraham willing
[1:11:28] to lay down his life to go fight for lot
[1:11:37] lot wasn't even a type of bride
[1:11:43] see my friend we don't need to sit here
[1:11:45] and try to figure out hope that we're
[1:11:47] bright all you gotta do is look at her
[1:11:48] life
[1:11:48] what have i been doing the last month
[1:11:51] the last two months the last two years
[1:11:54] what am i doing you are living what you
[1:11:57] believe
[1:12:01] we're either being conformed to the
[1:12:02] world
[1:12:05] or we're letting this word transform the
[1:12:08] way we think so we can be
[1:12:10] called so we can be uh conformed
[1:12:13] to the image of jesus christ now if
[1:12:15] jesus was here
[1:12:17] today he would not be and
[1:12:21] he'd be here if he was here for sure
[1:12:24] he would not be saying brother john you
[1:12:26] need to put your stocks
[1:12:28] in you know apple because they're really
[1:12:30] going or uh
[1:12:41] he'd be saying look up our redemption
[1:12:43] draws nigh
[1:12:47] we need to get things in order
[1:12:50] we need to get salt the rest of the
[1:12:52] family in
[1:12:54] because when it's over people will be
[1:12:56] thinking
[1:12:57] they're still getting saved up here
[1:13:02] but he's oh it's over for the gentiles
[1:13:08] i can't put enough emphasis in being
[1:13:10] serious with god
[1:13:11] i know this is just church we only got
[1:13:13] an hour you know soon it's going to be
[1:13:15] over we're going to be doing our own
[1:13:16] things watching on football games
[1:13:17] whatever it might be
[1:13:19] but i'm telling you the hour is nigh we
[1:13:21] need to be serious
[1:13:22] about getting our hearts our lives in
[1:13:24] order you have a
[1:13:26] family out there it's a spiritual family
[1:13:28] you don't know her yet maybe
[1:13:30] but god has called you to get her
[1:13:34] you can't expect brother branham he's
[1:13:36] gone
[1:13:37] you can't expect paul he's gone you
[1:13:38] can't expect jesus
[1:13:40] the body of jesus
[1:13:43] christ in you the hope of glory the only
[1:13:46] hope that
[1:13:46] the world's god is christ in you you are
[1:13:50] his hands you are his arms you are his
[1:13:52] eyes you are that mouthpiece
[1:13:53] to get the prophet to them to get the
[1:13:55] message to them
[1:14:02] that's why the prophet would confidently
[1:14:04] say
[1:14:06] that missionary work is always
[1:14:09] in the will of the lord because it's his
[1:14:13] eternal purpose
[1:14:16] he said we're all called to be a
[1:14:19] missionary
[1:14:20] which means we're all called to be sent
[1:14:22] out
[1:14:24] not wait for the door to open
[1:14:29] let me ask you brother ron
[1:14:33] if
[1:14:38] you were going to wait til somebody
[1:14:40] called you and said hey
[1:14:42] would you like to go fishing
[1:14:46] you might be waiting longer than if you
[1:14:49] called somebody and said hey
[1:14:50] you want to go fishing
[1:14:55] if you're gonna wait for god to bring
[1:14:58] some soul to you
[1:15:03] you might be waiting longer than if you
[1:15:04] fulfilled the scripture and go yelp for
[1:15:06] that soul amen
[1:15:11] so it's where your heart's at where your
[1:15:12] mind is at
[1:15:14] see too much of us are involved in too
[1:15:17] much of our purpose
[1:15:21] and we're missing the big picture the
[1:15:22] big picture is god's purpose
[1:15:25] that involves every one of you the same
[1:15:30] i don't live in your neighborhood you
[1:15:31] don't live in mine you i don't work at
[1:15:33] your place you don't work at mine
[1:15:36] we don't live in the same house we don't
[1:15:38] have the same rules but i'll tell you we
[1:15:39] got the same god
[1:15:41] with the same eternal purpose calling us
[1:15:43] to do the same work
[1:15:50] it's a tall order to go out and bring
[1:15:52] him in
[1:15:54] especially in this age but i want to say
[1:15:56] it's his order
[1:15:58] it's a great commission it's his eternal
[1:16:00] purpose
[1:16:02] if god was willing to die for his
[1:16:06] enemies
[1:16:07] to save the enemies his enemies from
[1:16:10] hell
[1:16:12] wouldn't he be doing the same thing
[1:16:14] today in us
[1:16:22] i think it's easy for for me to judge
[1:16:24] whether i've got the mind of christ
[1:16:30] romans chapter 8 verse 28 we know that
[1:16:32] all things work together
[1:16:34] for the good to them that love god
[1:16:37] to them who are the called
[1:16:41] according to his purpose because we're
[1:16:44] all called right
[1:16:46] many are called
[1:16:51] have you been called to his purpose
[1:16:56] his heart purpose his eternal purpose
[1:17:01] have you been called to what was
[1:17:03] actually in the mind of god
[1:17:05] before the foundation of the world
[1:17:09] then tell me how could not every single
[1:17:13] thing that happens to you
[1:17:15] not work out for the good
[1:17:22] we don't need to question
[1:17:25] what's going on in our life
[1:17:28] he's got it under control
[1:17:33] seek ye first the kingdom all other
[1:17:35] things are added
[1:17:37] put your attention to god's eternal
[1:17:39] purpose he'll take care of everything
[1:17:41] else amen
[1:17:43] all heaven rejoices over one soul
[1:17:46] that is returning back to him than the
[1:17:50] 99
[1:17:50] just people amen
[1:17:54] his heart is for those that are out
[1:17:58] that's the priority right now that's the
[1:18:00] priority
[1:18:02] there's coming a time when we're going
[1:18:05] to enjoy our honeymoon with him
[1:18:08] we're going to enjoy heaven with him but
[1:18:11] for now
[1:18:12] we need to work we need to labor what's
[1:18:14] light
[1:18:16] we need to be in harmony with the
[1:18:18] purpose of god today
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:22] because when it's over it's over
[1:18:26] you love god to the extreme
[1:18:29] that his love constrains you to do god's
[1:18:32] own purpose
[1:18:33] you know everything is going to work out
[1:18:36] for your good
[1:18:39] now at the same time you're busy
[1:18:43] working according to god's own purpose
[1:18:47] and not your own purpose he is making
[1:18:50] sure
[1:18:51] that you're being conformed into the
[1:18:53] image of his son
[1:18:57] i love that because to have this weight
[1:19:00] on me
[1:19:01] of having to figure everything out and
[1:19:05] do this and don't do that and time here
[1:19:08] and
[1:19:10] just put god first
[1:19:13] every single trial that you're going
[1:19:15] through is working out for your good
[1:19:17] philippians chapter 2 verse 12 wherefore
[1:19:20] my beloved
[1:19:22] as ye have always obeyed
[1:19:26] not in my presence only but now much
[1:19:29] more my absence
[1:19:30] work out your own salvation with fear
[1:19:34] and trembling
[1:19:38] in other words don't you ever entertain
[1:19:41] a thought
[1:19:42] that i got it all under control
[1:19:46] that i'm so close so one with god
[1:19:51] i don't fear nothing either just
[1:19:54] either just lay out a seal
[1:20:00] so work out what's already worked out
[1:20:06] well it might be worked out yesterday
[1:20:08] but this is a new day today is the day
[1:20:10] of salvation it needs to get worked out
[1:20:14] i'm not talking about dealing with this
[1:20:17] i committed i got
[1:20:18] baptized james i don't want to scare you
[1:20:23] but
[1:20:26] the heater wasn't plugged in all the way
[1:20:28] last night it's a little bit chilly
[1:20:31] trying to warm it up
[1:20:34] now brother branham said that
[1:20:38] you make a commitment to god you raise
[1:20:40] your hand
[1:20:41] you make that commitment in your heart
[1:20:43] you're just as saved as save can be
[1:20:47] you repent you get baptized you're just
[1:20:49] as saved as save can be
[1:20:51] but you have another day to walk in the
[1:20:54] light
[1:20:56] and if you're truly saved you'll
[1:20:58] continue to walk in the light
[1:21:01] but at any time because we got free more
[1:21:03] agency we can say no i'm taking a break
[1:21:06] that's dangerous ground that's dangerous
[1:21:10] ground
[1:21:12] so that's where that fear and trembling
[1:21:13] comes in that's the importance of just
[1:21:16] making sure
[1:21:17] that that i'm really in harmony with
[1:21:19] god's purpose
[1:21:20] for my life amen for it is
[1:21:24] god which worketh in you
[1:21:27] both to will and to do
[1:21:32] of all of your good pleasures
[1:21:38] but isn't that the way we think a lot of
[1:21:40] times i want to do this i want to do
[1:21:42] that i want to go here i want to go
[1:21:43] there i'm going to do this
[1:21:46] what about the purpose of god
[1:21:50] for it is god which worketh in you both
[1:21:52] to will and to do
[1:21:53] of his good pleasure so in other words
[1:21:55] when you come to church and you hear
[1:21:57] what you need to do to get in order
[1:22:00] with god do it
[1:22:03] without murmuring without disputings
[1:22:08] that ye may be blameless and harmless
[1:22:11] the sons of god so when god tells you to
[1:22:14] reach out
[1:22:16] don't murmur about it don't dispute
[1:22:20] i don't have to do that god didn't call
[1:22:22] me
[1:22:26] it's not my calling not a minister
[1:22:33] you listen to those tapes and brother
[1:22:34] brahm talks about that old
[1:22:36] old couple i don't know if they think
[1:22:39] they were in their 90s i can't remember
[1:22:41] their names right now
[1:22:43] it's on there kid
[1:22:47] i think it might be they would take
[1:22:50] the rio to reel machine and they would
[1:22:53] go to houses
[1:22:55] and they would play tapes so other
[1:22:58] people could hear
[1:22:59] the prophet
[1:23:03] you don't got to stand behind a pulpit
[1:23:05] to be in the ministry
[1:23:07] of reconciliation all you got to do is
[1:23:09] offer your time to god
[1:23:12] because he can't do anything with you if
[1:23:14] you're not offering
[1:23:17] don't expect god to put you in a
[1:23:18] headlock and drag you
[1:23:20] to do his will he's not that kind of man
[1:23:25] he's a gentleman he says come on i'll
[1:23:28] give you my word sunday morning
[1:23:31] i'll tell you my heart if you're in love
[1:23:34] with me follow me
[1:23:36] this is the way walking in it
[1:23:39] hallelujah that ye may be blameless and
[1:23:43] harmless the sons of god
[1:23:44] without rebuke in the midst of a crooked
[1:23:47] and perverse nation that's us
[1:23:48] isn't it the world we're living in among
[1:23:50] whom you
[1:23:51] shine as lights in the world holding
[1:23:54] forth the
[1:23:55] word of life that i may rejoice in the
[1:23:56] day of christ that i have not run in
[1:23:59] vain
[1:23:59] neither labored in vain god
[1:24:02] is working inside of you with a fuel
[1:24:06] of fire he's revolutionizing
[1:24:11] your life your
[1:24:14] desires your plans
[1:24:17] your wishes and day by day you're
[1:24:20] becoming more in his image
[1:24:23] now it may not appear from the outside
[1:24:28] in fact the more i look in the mirror
[1:24:30] the more i'm looking the opposite
[1:24:31] direction
[1:24:35] i was trying on these new glasses
[1:24:36] yesterday
[1:24:39] and i had the mask on you know because
[1:24:40] you gotta have the mask on and during
[1:24:42] these brushes
[1:24:44] and sister laura you know what i've seen
[1:24:46] i seen all my wrinkles right here that's
[1:24:48] all i seen was these wrinkles
[1:24:50] and i'm thinking oh my
[1:24:56] it's been a long time since i put
[1:24:57] coconut oil on my face but i need to put
[1:24:59] some on
[1:25:02] but i'll tell you on the inside our our
[1:25:05] heart our nature our spirit
[1:25:07] we should be coming more conformed into
[1:25:09] the image of god
[1:25:12] of jesus christ who lay down his life
[1:25:15] daily he
[1:25:16] lived for others
[1:25:22] don't murmur don't complain
[1:25:26] first peter chapter 4 verse 12 says
[1:25:28] beloved think it not strange
[1:25:31] concerning that we're talking about all
[1:25:33] things working together for the good
[1:25:35] amen amen beloved thinking not strange
[1:25:38] concerning the fiery trial you ever been
[1:25:40] a trial that wasn't just a little trial
[1:25:42] but it was
[1:25:43] fire i mean this
[1:25:46] battle that's happening inside of you
[1:25:49] you think
[1:25:50] it's about something else you think it's
[1:25:52] about your boss
[1:26:00] you think it's because you don't got
[1:26:02] enough money
[1:26:05] you think it's because you have a
[1:26:07] problem with your neighbor
[1:26:10] but really what's happening is god just
[1:26:12] he's so multi-talented
[1:26:15] he takes every situation and he's
[1:26:18] working on your character
[1:26:21] he's bringing you into the conformity of
[1:26:24] this word using every situation
[1:26:27] if we can recognize what's really
[1:26:29] happening
[1:26:32] beloved thinking not strange concerning
[1:26:34] the fiery trials which is to try you
[1:26:36] as though some strange thing has
[1:26:38] happened unto you but rejoice
[1:26:41] and as much as you are partakers of
[1:26:43] christ's suffering now
[1:26:45] if you just stop there it's just like
[1:26:48] who in the world wants to be partakers
[1:26:50] of anybody's sufferings
[1:26:54] but it's the sufferings in which you
[1:26:57] have a chance for character to groan
[1:27:00] because character is not a gift you're
[1:27:03] not going to be given the gift
[1:27:05] of the image of jesus christ
[1:27:11] you're going to have to let your mind be
[1:27:13] transformed
[1:27:14] into letting god tell you the right way
[1:27:16] to be
[1:27:17] when you're in the middle of that trial
[1:27:21] it's the truth that when his glory shall
[1:27:25] be revealed he may be glad
[1:27:27] also with exceeding joy the holy spirit
[1:27:31] is trying to conform us into god's image
[1:27:36] we don't make it into god's image by
[1:27:39] joining the church or by coming to
[1:27:43] church
[1:27:45] or by saying i'm in the message
[1:27:50] or by listening to the tapes
[1:27:54] i wonder how many people listen to those
[1:27:56] tapes that really
[1:27:57] never get rapturing faith
[1:28:00] because the prophet said rapturing faith
[1:28:02] in those tapes
[1:28:05] how many people listen to him and are
[1:28:06] never going to get rapturing faith
[1:28:09] so it's not just listening to tapes it's
[1:28:10] not just coming to church
[1:28:13] friends we've been called to a
[1:28:14] relationship with god
[1:28:18] and this relationship is you
[1:28:22] are the second born
[1:28:26] jesus christ is the firstborn among many
[1:28:28] brethren
[1:28:30] we've been called to be like him either
[1:28:32] i don't somewhere down the line it's got
[1:28:34] to happen
[1:28:35] i am not of the belief that i have to
[1:28:37] sit here and go to church
[1:28:39] all my life listen to the word of god be
[1:28:41] preached
[1:28:42] and i'm only going to change when i go
[1:28:44] on the other side after the rapture
[1:28:49] something is missing with that mentality
[1:28:51] god gave us a fivefold ministry for the
[1:28:54] perfecting
[1:29:00] god is working in us both to will and to
[1:29:02] do of his good pleasure
[1:29:05] as the world is going insane god's bride
[1:29:08] is coming into a sound mind with christ
[1:29:12] brother bam she know said she knows what
[1:29:14] to do with the word when it's given when
[1:29:16] the word is preached to her
[1:29:17] she knows what to do with it she takes
[1:29:20] it
[1:29:21] she puts it into action she says i'm
[1:29:23] gonna be this word
[1:29:25] by the grace of god i'm gonna live it i
[1:29:27] don't know i'm just gonna
[1:29:28] have the right mental attitude i'm gonna
[1:29:30] march forward with
[1:29:31] it
[1:29:35] the world is becoming more like hell
[1:29:39] the bride is becoming more like heaven
[1:29:43] the world is becoming into the image of
[1:29:46] the beast
[1:29:50] the bride is becoming more into the
[1:29:52] image of christ
[1:29:54] the world is falling apart at the seams
[1:29:57] but god's bride is walking seven steps
[1:29:59] up to perfection
[1:30:02] the more you can stay out of what's
[1:30:04] happening in the world
[1:30:06] the better chance you've got to focus on
[1:30:09] staying with the lord
[1:30:12] the world is fighting every day to get
[1:30:15] ahead but the bride
[1:30:16] is laying down their lives every day to
[1:30:18] win another soul
[1:30:21] she does not care about what happens in
[1:30:24] this world
[1:30:26] so at the same time that you're busy
[1:30:28] working out
[1:30:31] god's purpose god is conforming you into
[1:30:34] his image
[1:30:36] day by day oh i just love that
[1:30:39] everything has already been set
[1:30:42] for god's elect from the foundation of
[1:30:45] the world
[1:30:47] god give us time this morning because
[1:30:53] we haven't even got to the good part yet
[1:30:58] i can't help it time is up
[1:31:01] but i got all the good parts
[1:31:06] so it's up to you do you want the good
[1:31:08] parts you want to go home
[1:31:13] no we've heard we've heard good parts
[1:31:15] there was no bad parts this morning
[1:31:19] the word is word
[1:31:26] for we know that all things work
[1:31:29] together for the good to them that love
[1:31:32] the lord and are called according to his
[1:31:34] purpose
[1:31:35] amen that's what the scripture
[1:31:38] reads and
[1:31:41] for whom he did for no
[1:31:45] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:31:47] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:31:49] the firstborn
[1:31:50] among many brethren moreover whom he did
[1:31:53] predestinate
[1:31:54] them he also called and whom he called
[1:31:57] them he also justified in whom he
[1:31:59] justified
[1:32:00] them he also glorified now as you
[1:32:02] continue to read this
[1:32:04] he is talking not about just those who
[1:32:07] are saved
[1:32:09] he's talking about the elect
[1:32:14] because many are called fewer chosen
[1:32:18] i'm so glad god's called everybody he's
[1:32:21] a fair god
[1:32:23] he's a fair god but you know you how
[1:32:25] many knows
[1:32:26] any of the bride of jesus christ
[1:32:31] okay you you know some people that are
[1:32:33] in the bride right
[1:32:36] has any of them ever told you
[1:32:39] that they found where brother branham
[1:32:43] they could pinpoint exactly from the
[1:32:45] bible or the message
[1:32:46] that they were part of the bride
[1:32:51] do you understand what i'm saying you
[1:32:54] know that you are
[1:32:56] when something in here is pulling you to
[1:32:58] be
[1:32:59] all the word something is happening the
[1:33:02] problem is
[1:33:04] we want to mentally psychologically
[1:33:07] try to believe that we are up here and
[1:33:09] do what we want to do down here
[1:33:16] and that's where all the confusion comes
[1:33:17] in that's why when we come to church we
[1:33:19] hear this and we feel like we're getting
[1:33:21] beat over the head and that wasn't right
[1:33:23] and you know i feel like he's not making
[1:33:25] me feel like i'm the bride
[1:33:28] when i come here i want to feel like i'm
[1:33:29] the bride
[1:33:31] why don't you just be the bride that way
[1:33:34] you can be in a fiery furnace
[1:33:36] you're still the bride there you can be
[1:33:38] in lion's den you're still the bride
[1:33:39] there
[1:33:41] you can be in church and you're still
[1:33:42] the bride there
[1:33:45] what's happening inside you your mouth
[1:33:47] it's where you're at with god
[1:33:49] i can't put you in the bride and i can't
[1:33:51] take you out
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:33:56] i just want to give the word if you
[1:33:57] believe the word you will become the
[1:34:00] word
[1:34:02] i'm so sorry but there's so much stuff
[1:34:07] many are called to the marriage but only
[1:34:10] a few come
[1:34:11] the rest of them are too busy with what
[1:34:14] their own purposes
[1:34:17] got my business i married a wife got
[1:34:20] built in the house
[1:34:22] own purposes and he says you're not
[1:34:25] worthy
[1:34:26] is that what he said
[1:34:29] both esau and jacob were called
[1:34:33] i'll tell you what made this real
[1:34:34] confusing
[1:34:36] the fact was that his father isaac
[1:34:41] which is one of the fathers of our faith
[1:34:43] right i'm the
[1:34:44] i'm the god of abraham isaac and jacob
[1:34:49] isaac loved esau
[1:34:53] and prayed with his personal intent to
[1:34:56] see all esau take the birthright
[1:35:03] so naturally everything looked in order
[1:35:09] but god did not love esau
[1:35:14] he hated him because he sold out
[1:35:18] to his own purpose
[1:35:22] he sold out to his own purpose
[1:35:26] his own life
[1:35:29] that's why we have to be born again to
[1:35:31] do the will of god
[1:35:34] jacob on the other hand he was a little
[1:35:36] deceiver
[1:35:39] oh you little devil you
[1:35:43] but he was willing to do whatever it
[1:35:45] took to get in harmony with god
[1:35:48] i love that what a what a scene are you
[1:35:51] willing to do whatever it takes to get
[1:35:53] in harmony with god's plan
[1:35:56] that's what god looks at that heart and
[1:35:57] says oh yeah i love that person
[1:35:59] i love the heart of that person god sees
[1:36:02] in her heart
[1:36:04] he sees whether we got a heart to lay
[1:36:06] down her life for him
[1:36:08] or he sees that we got a selfish heart
[1:36:10] come on now
[1:36:12] i know this says send the light out here
[1:36:14] i know we're part of a church but look
[1:36:16] the real church is inside of you
[1:36:20] we don't know who's who all
[1:36:23] i can do is look at a life so all i can
[1:36:26] do is look at life
[1:36:27] jesus said you don't you don't know
[1:36:30] who's just look just look at the fruit
[1:36:31] you'll know them by the fruit
[1:36:37] we all want that little badge
[1:36:42] in fact anybody ever question it pull it
[1:36:46] out
[1:36:48] look you may doubt but i don't i got the
[1:36:52] badge

[1:36:58] here's the badge
[1:37:02] i saw you spoke i got the badge all
[1:37:04] right
[1:37:09] when we have in our fingertips 24 hours
[1:37:12] a day to live for jesus
[1:37:16] to lay down our life to love everyone
[1:37:19] to to win souls that's the holy ghost
[1:37:23] badge
[1:37:24] [Music]
[1:37:28] no wonder god could say before they were
[1:37:30] born
[1:37:31] in romans chapter 9 verse 11 for the
[1:37:34] children
[1:37:34] being not yet born neither having done
[1:37:37] good and evil
[1:37:38] that the purpose of god according to
[1:37:40] election might stand not of works
[1:37:42] but of him that calleth it was said unto
[1:37:45] her the elder shall serve the younger as
[1:37:47] it is written jacob have i
[1:37:49] loved and esau have i hated
[1:37:54] it doesn't matter if you've been
[1:37:55] baptized or that you're in the message
[1:38:00] not a good time to be talking about
[1:38:01] doesn't matter if you're baptized
[1:38:05] if you understand what i'm trying to say
[1:38:07] because we got a baptism today
[1:38:09] but baptism as we know repentance and
[1:38:11] baptism is just the beginning
[1:38:15] so on this light here
[1:38:19] if you're despising the god-given right
[1:38:22] to be born again
[1:38:24] and despise being conformed into his
[1:38:26] image
[1:38:27] and the calling to god's eternal purpose
[1:38:30] god is still not pleased
[1:38:34] we can't be satisfied with just
[1:38:38] he's calling us to a higher calling this
[1:38:40] is just the beginning
[1:38:44] i've been spending a lot of time with
[1:38:46] church order
[1:38:48] just a lot of time
[1:38:52] and i got these thoughts this morning
[1:38:53] when i was back there in the office
[1:38:55] i thought there are so many things to
[1:38:58] say
[1:39:00] they wouldn't be out of bear at all in
[1:39:02] one service
[1:39:04] and immediately thought came to me
[1:39:07] i have many things to say to you but you
[1:39:09] can't bear it now
[1:39:14] so god just says take the first step get
[1:39:17] baptized
[1:39:20] walk with me i'll show you one step at a
[1:39:23] time
[1:39:25] he promised not to put anything on us
[1:39:27] that would be so heavy we couldn't bear
[1:39:29] it
[1:39:31] the problem comes is when he asks us to
[1:39:33] do something and we've
[1:39:34] refused to walk in it
[1:39:38] and then confusion comes in we have to
[1:39:40] come to church
[1:39:41] always with defending our belief defend
[1:39:49] we need to earnestly contend for the
[1:39:51] faith of what was already said
[1:39:55] not our new belief
[1:40:06] my
[1:40:09] i want to at least finish reading
[1:40:13] these scriptures in romans chapter 8.
[1:40:18] i can forget all my other notes i just
[1:40:20] don't want to forget the word of god
[1:40:22] here
[1:40:24] verse 31 of romans chapter 8
[1:40:29] what shall we then say
[1:40:32] to these things that we just learned
[1:40:35] about
[1:40:36] if god be for us who can be against us
[1:40:41] that ought to give us confidence right
[1:40:42] there
[1:40:44] he that spared not his own son but
[1:40:47] delivered him up
[1:40:49] for us all how shall he not with him
[1:40:52] also free to give us all things i think
[1:40:54] about where paul did not
[1:40:56] spare his own life but gave
[1:41:00] but it was christ in him just like it
[1:41:02] was christ and moses
[1:41:04] it was christ and paul he didn't spare
[1:41:07] his life he didn't count it dear to
[1:41:09] himself
[1:41:11] he said i i have i have not shunned to
[1:41:14] declare on you the whole gospel of god
[1:41:17] he gave us this gospel that we could be
[1:41:19] strong that we could put on the whole
[1:41:20] armor of god that we can
[1:41:22] overcome the enemy
[1:41:26] who shall lay anything to the charge of
[1:41:29] god's elect
[1:41:30] it is god that justify it
[1:41:34] so it to me it don't matter what you've
[1:41:36] done
[1:41:38] god is standing in your behalf
[1:41:42] god is standing in your behalf
[1:41:45] now don't expect the world to agree with
[1:41:48] god
[1:41:49] don't expect the world to agree with you
[1:41:51] but it doesn't matter
[1:41:54] what matters is your faith in this word
[1:41:57] that god is the one that justifies you
[1:42:00] and i'm telling you he doesn't look at
[1:42:02] you like
[1:42:04] okay here's the line right here as long
[1:42:07] as your sins don't go beyond that line
[1:42:14] i'm going to be honest paul was the
[1:42:17] chiefest of us all
[1:42:19] right according to the word of god the
[1:42:21] chiefess
[1:42:23] he made it
[1:42:27] anything above that we're in
[1:42:33] just don't blaspheme what god is doing
[1:42:39] don't blaspheme what god's doing
[1:42:43] we don't have a scripture for that but
[1:42:46] look stop looking about how bad the bads
[1:42:49] are
[1:42:51] start looking at how good the goods are
[1:42:55] that's all that matters
[1:42:58] who is he that condemneth it is christ
[1:43:00] that died yea rather
[1:43:02] that is risen again is even at the right
[1:43:04] hand of god
[1:43:05] who also maketh intercession for us
[1:43:08] who shall separate us from the love of
[1:43:10] christ
[1:43:12] shall tribulation distress persecution
[1:43:15] famine nakedness perilous sword
[1:43:16] as is written these things are happening
[1:43:20] for our sake
[1:43:22] right for thy sake we are killed all the
[1:43:26] day long we are counted as sheep as
[1:43:28] for the slaughter we don't want to go
[1:43:30] through it but we know that
[1:43:32] character is being molded in us and
[1:43:34] satan don't like us when we're
[1:43:36] living for others so this stuff's going
[1:43:38] to happen
[1:43:39] but it doesn't matter our security is in
[1:43:42] christ day in all these things we are
[1:43:44] more than conquerors we're not going to
[1:43:47] let anything
[1:43:48] stop us more than conquerors through him
[1:43:51] that loved us for i am persuaded that
[1:43:53] neither
[1:43:53] death nor life nor angels or
[1:43:55] principalities or powers
[1:43:57] nor things present nor things to come
[1:44:00] nor
[1:44:00] height nor death nor any other creature
[1:44:03] any
[1:44:03] other creature especially that most
[1:44:07] subtle beast
[1:44:09] shall be able to separate us from the
[1:44:12] love of god
[1:44:13] which is in christ jesus our lord
[1:44:16] hang on to the love of god
[1:44:20] hang on to the love of god let god's
[1:44:23] love constrain you
[1:44:25] to fulfill god's purpose god's eternal
[1:44:28] purpose
[1:44:29] and that is to win souls the love of god
[1:44:33] the bible tells
[1:44:34] us is shed abroad in our heart by the
[1:44:36] holy spirit so let that
[1:44:38] flame of fire inside of you that burning
[1:44:43] burn within you to win souls for christ
[1:44:46] i got one quote
[1:44:47] brother branham said christianity is an
[1:44:50] everyday
[1:44:51] rugged life living for god
[1:44:56] in this present 2021
[1:44:59] i put that party
[1:45:03] it's a constant burning
[1:45:06] of the fire and the love of god
[1:45:11] in other words it's still burning today
[1:45:14] it's still burning it's burning the
[1:45:16] world out of you
[1:45:20] but it's also fueling you
[1:45:24] to win souls let me read it again
[1:45:25] christina's everyday rugged life living
[1:45:27] for god in this present world it is a
[1:45:28] constant burning of the fire and love of
[1:45:31] god
[1:45:31] in the heart that sets you a fire
[1:45:36] and puts you out yonder with people
[1:45:39] making converts to christ
[1:45:43] he said responsibilities
[1:45:46] end of quote now that's what the holy
[1:45:49] ghost does
[1:45:51] do we have time for god's eternal
[1:45:53] purpose
[1:45:56] let him conform you into his image
[1:45:59] don't be conformed to the world because
[1:46:01] the world is just doing what it wants to
[1:46:02] do
[1:46:06] and when you are being conformed into
[1:46:09] his image

[1:46:43] wanted to
[1:46:45] i say thank you for your patience
[1:46:47] there's nothing more important than the
[1:46:49] word of god

[1:46:53] thing i ever want to do
[1:46:55] is stand here and take your time up
[1:46:59] with something that i thought was just
