[34:20] houses and everyone his house
[34:22] and everyone his date and sat and called
[34:25] for their three sisters to eat and to
[34:28] drink with them and it was so when the
[34:30] days of their feasting were gone about
[34:32] that job sat and Sanctified them and
[34:35] Rose early in the morning and offered
[34:36] burnt offerings according to the number
[34:38] of them all
[34:39] for job said it may be that my sons have
[34:43] sinned and cursed God in their hearts
[34:46] notice where it happened thus did job
[34:49] continually amen good example for us now
[34:53] there was a day when the sons of God
[34:56] came to present themselves before the
[34:58] Lord and Satan came also among them and
[35:00] the Lord said unto Satan once cometh
[35:03] thou and then Satan answered the Lord
[35:05] and said from going to control and all
[35:08] the Earth and from walking up and down
[35:10] in it and the Lord said unto Satan has
[35:13] thou considered my servant job there's
[35:15] none like him in all in the earth a
[35:18] perfect and upright man one that feareth
[35:20] God and excuse evil
[35:23] then Satan answered the Lord and said
[35:25] doth job fear God for naught
[35:29] has not Thou made a hedge about him and
[35:32] about his house and about all that he
[35:34] hath on every side
[35:36] that was blessed the work of his hands
[35:38] and his substance is increased in the
[35:40] land
[35:42] but put forth thine hand now and touch
[35:44] all that he have and he will curse thee
[35:46] to thy face
[35:49] the Lord said unto Satan behold all that
[35:51] he have is in thy power only upon
[35:53] himself put not forth thine hand so
[35:56] Satan went forth from the presence of
[35:58] the Lord
[35:59] there was a day when his
[36:02] sons and his daughters were eating and
[36:04] drinking wine and the elders brother's
[36:07] house and there came a messenger unto
[36:09] job and said The Oxen were plowing and
[36:12] the asses feeding beside them and the
[36:15] Siberian sibians fell upon them and took
[36:19] them away yeah have slayed the servants
[36:21] with the edge of the sword and I only am
[36:24] escaped alone to tell thee while he was
[36:27] yet speaking there came also another and
[36:30] said the fire of God has fallen from
[36:31] heaven and burned up notice where he
[36:34] said it came from Heaven the fire of God
[36:37] has fallen from heaven and burned up the
[36:39] sheep and the servants and consumed them
[36:42] and I and only am
[36:44] I only am escaped alone to tell thee and
[36:47] while he was yet speaking there came
[36:50] also another and said the Chaldeans made
[36:53] out three bands and fell upon the camels
[36:55] and have carried them away yea and slain
[36:58] the servants with the edge of the sword
[37:00] and I only am escaped alone to tell thee
[37:03] and while I was yet speaking there came
[37:05] also another and said thy sons and thy
[37:08] daughters were eating and drinking wine
[37:09] in their eldest brother's house and
[37:12] behold there came a great win from the
[37:15] Wilderness and smote the four corners of
[37:18] the house and it fell upon the young men
[37:19] and and they are dead and I only am
[37:24] escaped alone to tell thee then jobber
[37:28] Rose
[37:29] rent and rent his mantle shaved his head
[37:32] fell down on the ground and worshiped
[37:36] and said naked came I
[37:39] out of my mother's womb and naked shall
[37:41] I return dither
[37:42] and the lord gave
[37:45] and the Lord have taken away blessed be
[37:49] the name of the Lord
[37:51] notice this verse in all this
[37:54] job said not
[37:56] nor charge God foolishly amen amen God
[38:00] bless you may be seated
[38:03] this is quite a story and I hope you
[38:06] excuse me for my fast reading there but
[38:07] you are all familiar with the story of
[38:10] job anyways amen
[38:12] amen now notice here this was really a
[38:14] situation between God and Satan
[38:17] God who's the greatest and Satan who was
[38:19] the second greatest
[38:22] and and job was just in the crosshairs
[38:24] of this battle it was a conflict between
[38:27] Good and Evil and job's life was the
[38:31] battlefield
[38:33] and we we need to understand sometimes
[38:35] we're going through trials and we take
[38:36] it personally
[38:38] yeah
[38:40] see Satan never disputed how good job
[38:44] was
[38:45] never disputed that but Satan disputed
[38:49] job's motive
[38:54] and it was really a dig towards God's in
[38:58] integrity
[39:00] he said the reason the only reason that
[39:02] job is serving you so perfectly
[39:05] is that you have blessed them
[39:07] you put a hedge of protection around him
[39:09] and his family in his home on every side
[39:11] and you've increased his substance
[39:13] Beyond expectation
[39:15] yeah he's going to serve you perfectly
[39:18] but it is not a pure love
[39:21] it's because he's getting something out
[39:24] of it
[39:26] and you know there's there are believers
[39:29] who serve God because of what they can
[39:33] get out of it
[39:37] right Satan said put forth on hand now
[39:39] and touch all that he have and he will
[39:42] curse thee to thy face see Satan was
[39:46] challenging God's integrity
[39:48] Satan was accusing God that he didn't
[39:51] have a love relationship with job and
[39:54] that job did not have a love
[39:55] relationship with him
[39:57] and that he or God was actually
[40:01] manipulating job with blessings
[40:05] this is what was going on right
[40:12] and of course God won't have any of that
[40:16] God wanted to prove
[40:19] job's relationship with him
[40:23] job was a special man
[40:25] Noah was a special man he found Grace in
[40:27] the sight of God Moses was special Enoch
[40:30] was definitely special Joshua was
[40:33] special Joseph was special Paul was was
[40:36] special
[40:38] and I hope each one of you feel the same
[40:40] way this morning
[40:43] Deuteronomy 7 6 the Lord thy God have
[40:46] chosen thee to be a special people unto
[40:48] himself above all the people that is on
[40:50] the face of the Earth and he set his
[40:52] love upon us and chose us because he
[40:56] loves us
[40:59] right so there is the foundation for our
[41:02] relationship
[41:04] and though job was very special
[41:08] Saul was his trials
[41:12] job lost all
[41:15] his prosperity
[41:17] his all his children died
[41:20] he suffered great physical Agony and in
[41:24] the midst of all his sufferings
[41:27] job's closest friends were accusing him
[41:29] of transgressions right
[41:33] right now
[41:34] I don't care what trial you're going
[41:36] through what you've been through it
[41:39] can't compare with job
[41:43] and not that we want to compare trials
[41:46] but we do need to compare how we're
[41:49] reacting in our trials
[41:51] because that's what's important
[41:54] amen no
[41:57] if we're going to give this little
[41:59] message a title I like to entitle it
[42:00] meeting God in your trials amen
[42:04] amen but before we get to meeting God in
[42:06] our trials this morning
[42:09] I want to talk about
[42:12] meeting him with a revelation of Who We
[42:15] Are
[42:18] job knew who God was
[42:22] he knew who he belonged to he knew who
[42:25] had the final say-so in his life there
[42:28] was something inside of job that made
[42:30] him look at life and and that included
[42:34] his trials what he was going through in
[42:36] a different way than what most people
[42:37] looked at
[42:41] God wouldn't allow this to happen to job
[42:46] unless it was somehow going to work out
[42:49] for the good because job knew that God
[42:52] was a good God and everything he did was
[42:55] good
[42:56] even when he created Lucifer he was good
[43:00] he was perfect
[43:01] you can't point a finger at God at any
[43:05] time and say what God did was not good
[43:08] you just can't because he's a good God
[43:13] as we learned that a word is a thought
[43:16] expressed
[43:17] in God's thoughts are higher than our
[43:20] thoughts what we normally think
[43:23] his thoughts are eternal
[43:26] our thoughts are temporal
[43:29] in the samura church age brother Brandon
[43:31] says the Eternal thoughts of God let me
[43:34] ask you are the thoughts of God eternal
[43:38] he said if you can see this you will see
[43:41] many things
[43:43] God is unchangeable in both Essence and
[43:46] behavior that means he's the same
[43:48] yesterday today and forever he's never
[43:49] going to change
[43:51] God is infinite in his ability so
[43:55] therefore he is as God uh so therefore
[43:59] he as God must be omniscient in other
[44:03] words he knows everything
[44:07] so if he knows everything and he only
[44:09] does good
[44:11] we don't have to worry about anything
[44:13] right
[44:14] job 42 verse 2 says I know uh you don't
[44:18] need to turn there I know that thou
[44:20] can't do everything
[44:22] and that no thought can be withholden
[44:25] from thee so job knew had a good idea
[44:29] who God was it's important when you're
[44:32] going through trials to know who God is
[44:34] amen
[44:36] he said if he knows everything then he
[44:39] knows not now learning he's not now
[44:42] learning nor is he taking counsel even
[44:45] with himself
[44:47] nor is he at any time adding to his
[44:49] knowledge
[44:51] if he can add to his knowledge then he's
[44:54] not omniscient
[44:56] he has never had a new thought about
[44:58] anything
[45:00] that was such an amazing statement he
[45:03] has never had a new thought about him
[45:05] you know we get up and every day we're
[45:07] learning right we love learning we like
[45:09] watching the discovery trial we like
[45:11] learning how to do something faster and
[45:13] but with God you can't
[45:17] because all his thoughts he has always
[45:20] had and always will have
[45:22] and knows the end from the beginning
[45:24] because he's God thus the thoughts of
[45:27] God are eternal
[45:29] they are real
[45:34] they are not simply like a man right
[45:38] with a blueprint
[45:40] he has drawn up which one day he would
[45:44] translate into substance and form
[45:47] but they are already real
[45:49] Eternal and a part of God
[45:52] 's thoughts are not like our thoughts
[45:57] amen we can think a whole bunch of
[45:58] thoughts and at the end of the day
[46:00] probably 95 percent of them weren't even
[46:03] true right yes that's true but when God
[46:06] thinks brother Brandon says they are
[46:08] real they are a hundred percent one
[46:11] hundred percent of the time real
[46:14] amen there's no mistakes brother Brandon
[46:17] said the questions and answers before
[46:18] there was a world before there was a
[46:21] planet before there was a sun before
[46:22] there was a moon before there was light
[46:24] before there was anything when it was
[46:27] still God God and His Thoughts
[46:30] the Eternal thoughts of God chose you
[46:34] chose you
[46:36] by predestination by foreknowledge to
[46:40] know that you would be on the earth
[46:43] and to know there would be sin
[46:47] so we're serving a god
[46:50] who knows the trial that we
[46:53] either came out of are in or going into
[46:57] before it ever happens there's no
[46:59] surprise with God and this is important
[47:02] to have this understanding so we're just
[47:05] not blown away
[47:08] the Eternal thoughts of God chose you by
[47:12] predestination
[47:14] he put your name there
[47:19] we didn't have to do anything
[47:22] he did it all
[47:24] right to me that's just mind-blowing
[47:26] John 15 16 says ye have not chosen me
[47:29] but I have chosen you
[47:32] now notice you do have a part to play
[47:36] and we're going to get into this a
[47:37] little bit later in the message you must
[47:39] will your will to the Eternal thoughts
[47:41] of God Amen you can't keep your thoughts
[47:44] and expect to be predestinated
[47:46] you can't hold on to your will your
[47:48] thoughts your way and expect that by
[47:51] God's foreknowledge you're going to make
[47:52] it right
[47:53] no you have a part to play God played
[47:56] his part but you got to Play Your Part
[47:58] you have not chosen me but I've chosen
[48:00] you know I ordained you that ye should
[48:03] go and bring forth fruit that your fruit
[48:05] should remain
[48:06] in other words you have a part to play
[48:09] I have a part to play you have a part to
[48:12] play
[48:13] God has his part and then he said
[48:16] that whatsoever you should ask in the in
[48:19] my uh ask the father in my name he will
[48:22] give it to you now notice that comes
[48:25] after you do your part
[48:28] so many people want to claim the
[48:30] promises of God and they don't really
[48:31] care about the relationship part
[48:34] you know this promise is for everybody
[48:35] this promise isn't really for everybody
[48:38] it's for whoever can't believe yes but
[48:40] is God going to give you faith for
[48:42] promises all the time when you are not
[48:45] doing what he's asked you to do
[48:50] come on now I mean it's the word you
[48:52] should still be excited about it that's
[48:54] all I can say these things I command you
[48:56] that you love one another
[48:59] now he said to murder Church age brother
[49:01] Branham said he says so when Adam was
[49:04] formed of the Dust of the earth and his
[49:06] spiritual being created by God then Adam
[49:09] became God's thought expressed
[49:12] and those Eternal thoughts were now
[49:14] manifested amen amen now down through
[49:16] the centuries we go we find Moses and
[49:18] Jeremiah John the Baptist and each one
[49:20] of these were God's
[49:22] Eternal thoughts expressed in its season
[49:26] why are you reading that brother John
[49:28] because you are God's Eternal thought
[49:30] expressed in a season
[49:33] and you have to go through your child
[49:34] you won't be going through job's trial
[49:36] you won't be going through Moses's trial
[49:38] but you will be going through your trial
[49:40] and you must meet God there you got to
[49:43] know where you're standing
[49:45] now if God's thoughts are eternal
[49:49] where does
[49:51] that puts you in God's thoughts
[49:55] he thought of you he spoke of you
[49:58] and now you are going to manifest what
[50:02] he thought of you yes
[50:04] yeah God never intended
[50:08] and ever intended
[50:11] when he called any of us that we would
[50:14] slip away
[50:16] that we would revert but when he called
[50:20] us
[50:21] he predestinated us to be Overcomers to
[50:25] be in His image when this was over
[50:28] and we must keep focused on that yes
[50:31] yes you know the scripture Jeremiah fry
[50:33] I know the thoughts I think towards you
[50:35] saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not
[50:38] of evil to give you an expected end
[50:43] amen now these thoughts of you are just
[50:45] as eternal
[50:47] it's it's
[50:48] God wants to give us an expected end
[50:51] they must come to pass they his his word
[50:54] his thought his word being the same
[50:57] right will not return unto him void it's
[51:00] got to accomplish what it was intended
[51:04] for
[51:06] now job knew who he was
[51:10] he knew was somehow connected to the
[51:13] Eternal God
[51:14] and if we could go through life and all
[51:16] of our trials with this Revelation then
[51:18] we could really have more confidence
[51:20] that somehow God is going to see us
[51:23] through
[51:25] the Bible says that nothing shall be
[51:28] able to stand before thee all the days
[51:29] of thy life
[51:31] as I was with Moses so shall I be with
[51:34] thee I mean I
[51:37] as I was with job so shall I be with you
[51:41] but job had a part to play
[51:45] every seed must bring forth of its kind
[51:50] now it takes
[51:55] something to bring forth a seed what
[51:57] does it take
[51:59] we got grass growing out here they were
[52:02] just seed moisture is one
[52:06] light
[52:08] hate
[52:10] son Sun generates light and and light
[52:14] really generates heat and if you don't
[52:16] don't believe that just step in my our
[52:19] Greenhouse
[52:21] it was over a hundred in there yesterday
[52:25] trials create Heat
[52:28] and they really bring forth Who We Are
[52:31] [Music]
[52:35] now we're all in the midst of changing
[52:38] right
[52:40] from a corruptable seed to an
[52:42] incorruptible
[52:44] and so there's a constant manifestation
[52:48] First Corinthians 3 13 don't turn there
[52:50] just write it down every man's work
[52:52] shall be made manifest
[52:56] for the day shall declare it because it
[52:58] shall be revealed
[53:00] by fire yeah
[53:02] fire reveals Who We Are
[53:06] and the fire shall try every man's work
[53:08] of what sort it is
[53:12] right so God wants to prove us
[53:15] just like he wanted to prove to Satan
[53:17] who job was
[53:19] amen and it took the fire to do it
[53:21] because Satan said oh he's just serving
[53:23] you because of what he can get out of
[53:25] you of course anybody that you bless is
[53:28] going to just you know serve you better
[53:31] that ain't the truth right that is
[53:34] nothing but a lie
[53:37] amen Psalm 66 10 says for thou o God
[53:40] has proved us
[53:43] thou has tried us
[53:45] as silver is tried
[53:50] now
[53:52] when we're made out of the same
[53:54] substance that God is made out of then
[53:58] we'll be able to stand the test like job
[54:01] did
[54:03] that's why Jesus told the church age our
[54:06] church aged the church World in our age
[54:08] I counsel thee tobiome gold tried in the
[54:13] fire it's able to to go through a test
[54:17] and remain faithful to come to church
[54:20] it's able to go through when it don't
[54:22] have money it's able to still pay its
[54:25] ties
[54:27] because that is what deity is it stays
[54:32] true to the word amen the word is our
[54:36] foundation we don't learn this word so
[54:39] we can know the word and still do what
[54:41] we want to do
[54:43] That's what Satan is offering
[54:49] we need
[54:51] gold Tried by the fire
[54:55] God can take the Heat
[55:00] job could take the Heat
[55:02] job was a predestinancy to God
[55:07] and God be an omniscient new job
[55:09] would remain faithful to his sufferings
[55:13] now I want us to remember this
[55:16] God being omniscient new job would
[55:20] remain faithful through no but Satan
[55:22] didn't know that amen and even though
[55:25] God knows he still wants us to prove it
[55:29] this is an important subject because God
[55:32] knows everything knows it and from the
[55:33] beginning right he knew Abraham loved
[55:36] him
[55:37] he knew he'd be faithful
[55:39] but he still wanted
[55:41] Abraham to offer up Isaac to take that
[55:44] knife and to kill Isaac
[55:49] and when he stopped his hand he said now
[55:52] I know that thou lovest me you have to
[55:56] manifest you have to manifest you have
[55:59] to prove with your life how much you
[56:01] love God it is not good enough to say
[56:03] God knows my heart amen
[56:06] God himself wants you to prove it not me
[56:09] but but God does
[56:12] so we have to go through with it
[56:16] so Satan doubted God
[56:20] inside of job you can write this down
[56:23] God inside of job kept job inside of his
[56:27] trials
[56:31] because that's what it is
[56:33] right it is not the knowledge of God
[56:35] that helps you overcome trials it's not
[56:38] the learning that you can learn it's God
[56:40] in you the hope of glory amen
[56:47] job didn't know everything but he knew
[56:50] he belonged to God
[56:52] job understood that the creator of all
[56:55] life knows that he can try them that are
[56:59] his and he knows that they will still
[57:02] pass the test
[57:05] right
[57:06] because the receipt of God
[57:10] see you know what Satan is wanting to
[57:13] offer and brother bran talked about this
[57:14] is an intellectual salvation
[57:17] an intellectual relationship in
[57:20] intellectual I know I know the Bible and
[57:22] I just I believe the Bible but they're
[57:24] not willing to allow the trials that
[57:27] they go to to to Really Define where
[57:30] they're at with God to really prove in
[57:33] other words is God's God wants to prove
[57:37] us
[57:38] but we don't want to be proven
[57:42] we what we want to just sit with this
[57:44] magical belief of I believe the message
[57:50] no job understood that if he belong to
[57:54] God and God was in that he was going to
[57:56] be able to go through the trial
[57:58] because they're made out of the same
[58:00] substance
[58:01] job and you are made out of the same
[58:04] substance
[58:05] that God is
[58:07] but you have to believe that
[58:10] yes before we came to God we were
[58:14] outright sinners
[58:15] scared of everything ran after all will
[58:18] did what we want to do and I understand
[58:20] that that Cocker burn nature is still
[58:23] hanging on and we got to Die daily that
[58:25] that's the prescription that Jesus gave
[58:27] us but we must believe that we are of
[58:31] Christ
[58:32] to the point that we can go through the
[58:35] trials and remain faithful don't
[58:39] question God don't doubt God don't say
[58:41] something's out of order something must
[58:43] be no amen we've got to believe that if
[58:47] our children died and and our house blew
[58:50] up and and whatever happened that we
[58:52] would still remain in love with Jesus
[58:54] Christ
[58:55] don't always slay me yet but I trust him
[59:03] job 23 verse 10 says but he knoweth the
[59:07] way that I take
[59:09] see
[59:11] job understood this
[59:13] when he have tried me
[59:16] I will come forth as gold
[59:20] you have that attitude
[59:22] we need it
[59:23] my foot
[59:26] have held my steps
[59:29] and his way have I kept
[59:32] and not declined I love that
[59:37] there's no declining
[59:40] there's no sidestepping there's no
[59:43] taking a break we've got to remain
[59:45] faithful
[59:46] neither have I gone back from the
[59:49] Commandments of his lips
[59:52] I have esteemed the words of his mouth
[59:55] more than my
[59:58] necessary food
[1:00:01] that doesn't say more than my Double
[1:00:03] Stuffed Orioles
[1:00:06] I'm talking about necessary food when
[1:00:08] you need it his word is more important
[1:00:13] job didn't understand everything that
[1:00:15] happened to him but he still trusted God
[1:00:17] in the middle of his trials
[1:00:19] to the highest degree
[1:00:23] to the highest degree
[1:00:25] of Temptation
[1:00:27] which is
[1:00:29] though he slain me
[1:00:30] yet why trust him
[1:00:33] will you allow God to slay you
[1:00:37] amen
[1:00:38] [Music]
[1:00:42] praise the Lord
[1:00:44] amen
[1:00:46] it just proves your love for him how
[1:00:49] deep it is
[1:00:52] the whole world
[1:00:55] Church World loves God to a point
[1:00:58] and brother Brian said you love God
[1:00:59] every day and still miss it
[1:01:01] but we're talking about a real love
[1:01:03] relationship
[1:01:04] to where he's the Potter you're the clay
[1:01:08] he can put you through anything and you
[1:01:10] remain faithful that's what it's all
[1:01:12] about
[1:01:15] the most important thing in life is our
[1:01:18] relationship with God yes amen
[1:01:21] and it's not that we have a relationship
[1:01:24] with God
[1:01:26] but what is the proper and pleasing
[1:01:28] relationship with him right because
[1:01:31] everybody says oh I got a relationship
[1:01:32] with God oh I gotta walk with God I got
[1:01:34] a relation but is it pleasing is it
[1:01:37] proper
[1:01:38] is it is it according to what how he
[1:01:41] wants it
[1:01:42] or is it according to your standard
[1:01:44] right
[1:01:46] our trials do two important things
[1:01:52] they prove not just to God who knows all
[1:01:55] things already but to the devil who
[1:01:58] doesn't know
[1:01:59] nothing
[1:02:00] it proves to the world and to us who we
[1:02:05] really are yeah
[1:02:07] oh this is an important aspect amen it
[1:02:11] proves where we're at
[1:02:14] number two God uses them to purify the
[1:02:19] worldly nature outside get it out of us
[1:02:22] he uses the trials to purify and get rid
[1:02:26] of the worldly nature
[1:02:29] Oh Brother John I got rid of mine a long
[1:02:32] time ago I'm a new creature where you
[1:02:33] just woke up on a new day right and you
[1:02:36] got to Die daily brother Brian said in
[1:02:38] the church age the laodicean church age
[1:02:40] he says the gold of God
[1:02:43] is a character like is a christ-like
[1:02:47] character
[1:02:48] produced
[1:02:50] in the furnace
[1:02:52] in the fiery furnace of affliction
[1:02:57] this is the right
[1:02:59] kind of gold so how in the world are we
[1:03:03] ever ever gonna get character
[1:03:06] number one
[1:03:08] if we stay away and don't want to deal
[1:03:10] with our trials
[1:03:13] number two when we had the trials we
[1:03:15] ain't even interested in what we need to
[1:03:18] do to get the character we just want to
[1:03:19] get out of the trial
[1:03:24] I mean to me character isn't naturally
[1:03:27] produced when you're going through trial
[1:03:30] that would be like a gift did we say
[1:03:31] give me trials give me trials I'm off
[1:03:33] character when I'm done I'm sorry don't
[1:03:34] work like that that's right that's right
[1:03:36] brother Brian says now what kind of
[1:03:38] character will you take with you when
[1:03:39] you go to heaven
[1:03:42] will it be like his
[1:03:45] whose character was molded by the
[1:03:47] suffering in the fiery furnace of
[1:03:50] Affliction or will it be the softness of
[1:03:54] the character list
[1:03:56] laodicean people
[1:03:59] brother Brian said that's the only thing
[1:04:01] we're taking with us right it's our
[1:04:02] character right right just it just
[1:04:04] depends on what kind of character you're
[1:04:05] going to have
[1:04:08] this is a real Secret
[1:04:12] of the importance of Trials of why we
[1:04:15] can rejoice when we're going through our
[1:04:16] trials
[1:04:18] trials open the door of opportunity for
[1:04:21] a character to be manifested
[1:04:24] James 1 just just you know these
[1:04:27] scriptures I just kind of want to go
[1:04:28] through them James 1 verse 2 my brother
[1:04:31] encountered all joy when you fall into
[1:04:32] diverse temptation
[1:04:34] knowing this that the trend of your
[1:04:36] faith worketh patience but let patients
[1:04:39] have a perfect work that ye may be
[1:04:40] perfect complete entire wanting nothing
[1:04:46] what happens when we're going through a
[1:04:48] trial I don't want this what is this
[1:04:50] going on
[1:04:51] this is your fault
[1:04:57] well there's a reason
[1:04:59] that
[1:05:01] we go through these things
[1:05:06] and if we could come in agreement here
[1:05:08] with James
[1:05:11] that God is looking for us to get to a
[1:05:14] point when we're in our trial to not
[1:05:16] want
[1:05:18] just to Comm commit yourself to God Amen
[1:05:22] commit the situation to God
[1:05:26] and and and what happens when you commit
[1:05:30] yourself to God
[1:05:32] character will be manifested in your
[1:05:35] life
[1:05:37] but if you choose to fight your way
[1:05:39] through your trial
[1:05:42] without a submission to the way God
[1:05:44] wants you to handle it
[1:05:46] you will not get character you will just
[1:05:49] get miserable
[1:05:51] the whole world is full of miserable
[1:05:53] people going through trials
[1:05:55] first Peter 4 12. beloved thinking not
[1:05:57] strange concerning the fiery trials
[1:05:59] which is to try you as though some
[1:06:02] strange thing happen unto you
[1:06:07] don't think it's strange
[1:06:09] God is in control amen
[1:06:12] amen but rejoice in as much as ye are
[1:06:16] partakers of Christ's suffering that
[1:06:19] when his glory shall be revealed ye may
[1:06:22] be glad also with exceeding Joy
[1:06:28] the joy of the Lord is our strength amen
[1:06:31] we don't want to be afraid of our trials
[1:06:34] we're not alone in our trials God is
[1:06:36] there
[1:06:37] but we need to meet God in the trial
[1:06:42] we need to let him have his way
[1:06:44] we need to be conscious of his will in
[1:06:47] the trial or else how are we going to
[1:06:49] choose it
[1:06:50] and I'll tell you A lot of times when we
[1:06:52] go into a trial
[1:06:54] we are just so messed up in our mind
[1:06:56] about this thing that's happening this
[1:06:59] shouldn't be happening why did this
[1:07:00] happen and we're so distracted where are
[1:07:03] we going to get the money from where are
[1:07:04] we gonna how I I I don't want to go back
[1:07:07] to the doctor I mean it's endless of the
[1:07:09] distractions that happen to us when we
[1:07:11] enter a trial
[1:07:13] that we are so unfocused
[1:07:17] on what God wants us to do
[1:07:21] we need to learn to stand still
[1:07:23] and know that he is still God in the
[1:07:26] middle of our trial that's what job did
[1:07:29] he didn't run over here run over there
[1:07:31] and get his friends and make this phone
[1:07:32] call and
[1:07:34] come on he had something on the inside
[1:07:37] of them that was greater than all his
[1:07:39] friends
[1:07:40] change
[1:07:44] let him prove his faithfulness to you
[1:07:47] amen yes
[1:07:49] how about a love relationship
[1:07:52] it doesn't matter your child
[1:07:55] doesn't matter what you're going through
[1:07:57] it doesn't even matter how it's
[1:07:59] affecting you
[1:08:02] but I want you to remember this I want
[1:08:03] you to turn with me to this one first
[1:08:05] John chapter 4 verse 4. we got to take
[1:08:08] our time on this one
[1:08:11] all right that's enough time you should
[1:08:13] have got there by now
[1:08:20] first John 4 4 ye are of God
[1:08:24] settle it
[1:08:26] settle it ye are of God now if you can
[1:08:30] settle this this the rest of this would
[1:08:32] be quite easy
[1:08:33] you have got little children and have
[1:08:35] overcome them well how'd I do it
[1:08:38] because greater is he that is in you
[1:08:42] amen then he that is in the world
[1:08:45] that's in you
[1:08:49] amen
[1:08:51] see there's the white dog and the black
[1:08:53] dog there's the battle
[1:08:57] and if you know you can walk into your
[1:09:00] trial I am with I am of God I'm a part
[1:09:03] of God what he spoke has got to come to
[1:09:06] pass it's not going to be I'm not going
[1:09:08] to be the only person
[1:09:10] that he spoke and it doesn't come to
[1:09:12] pass
[1:09:15] but somehow the devil just gets us to
[1:09:17] wander off
[1:09:19] look we got to stand there in the trial
[1:09:22] we got to stand there as a Believer and
[1:09:25] know that I am of God
[1:09:28] and the Overcomer lives inside of me
[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:09:32] oh I don't have to worry about doing it
[1:09:34] he's going to do it through me I'm just
[1:09:37] going to trust him I'm going to believe
[1:09:41] the battle is inside of us amen and we
[1:09:45] don't got time to read it but James 4
[1:09:47] verses one through three it talks about
[1:09:49] it
[1:09:50] we must remember who we are and who we
[1:09:53] belong to
[1:09:56] yeah so how do we overcome by believing
[1:10:00] by believing first John chapter 5 verse
[1:10:04] 4 I want us to go here too first John
[1:10:05] chapter 5 verse 4. by believing God is
[1:10:09] greater on the inside of us than
[1:10:12] anything that we're facing
[1:10:15] I I just can't imagine anybody
[1:10:18] is going to say well you don't
[1:10:20] understand
[1:10:25] that's right
[1:10:29] you're going to tell me your trial is
[1:10:31] worse than job's
[1:10:33] right
[1:10:34] Joel why did Joe pass the test
[1:10:40] feared God he skewed evil
[1:10:44] he walked uprightly he had a real love
[1:10:47] relationship it was a real thing right
[1:10:51] he manifested this thing called
[1:10:54] predestination
[1:10:57] he manifested this foreknowledge he
[1:11:01] manifested in his time
[1:11:03] the word that God spoke before the
[1:11:05] foundation of the world
[1:11:09] it is no different for you and me
[1:11:13] don't say you don't understand don't
[1:11:15] think nobody understands
[1:11:18] thank God is with me
[1:11:20] God in Me is greater than this situation
[1:11:23] that's going on
[1:11:27] trials are essential part of our growth
[1:11:31] do you believe that
[1:11:32] all right for whatsoever is born of God
[1:11:36] overcometh the world have you been born
[1:11:39] again
[1:11:40] [Music]
[1:11:42] you've got the scripture right there yes
[1:11:44] you have no excuse of not overcoming
[1:11:47] right there
[1:11:49] and this is the victory that overcometh
[1:11:51] the world even our faith
[1:11:55] so you're going to go into your trial
[1:11:56] and you're you're not going to believe
[1:11:59] well number one you've got to get along
[1:12:02] with God and get that thing cleared up
[1:12:04] because the only way you're going to get
[1:12:07] Victory with God is through faith
[1:12:12] so many examples of that in the Bible
[1:12:15] trials are the last thing we want to go
[1:12:18] through they're the last things we want
[1:12:19] to face they're when we're in them we
[1:12:21] want to get out of them but they are an
[1:12:24] essential part of our growth
[1:12:27] it's like if a person never goes through
[1:12:29] a trial they don't grow amen I know this
[1:12:33] is hard to understand because we feel we
[1:12:35] can grow by listening to tapes
[1:12:38] by reading the Bible
[1:12:41] by memorizing scriptures
[1:12:46] you may grow into the knowledge
[1:12:49] intellectual knowledge
[1:12:52] of God
[1:12:53] but you literally if you choose what the
[1:12:57] prophet the words of the Prophet you are
[1:12:59] further away from knowing god than when
[1:13:01] you first started
[1:13:03] that's what he said
[1:13:05] so we can't know God in that way
[1:13:08] but yet the prophet told us we need to
[1:13:10] read we need to pray we need to listen
[1:13:11] to taste rapturing faith and The Taste
[1:13:13] we need that but it's not for this it's
[1:13:17] not for this organ right I don't know if
[1:13:20] this is an organ
[1:13:21] but it is for this organ
[1:13:26] that's why we should always pray Lord
[1:13:28] help me to see amen open my eyes when we
[1:13:31] go to read it amen
[1:13:34] amen a bunch of head knowledge will
[1:13:36] never prove anything right
[1:13:39] how many times have you known the right
[1:13:41] thing to do but you still didn't
[1:13:43] manifest it that's what head knowledge
[1:13:46] does there's no life in it you you need
[1:13:50] you need to prove you need to take that
[1:13:53] knife
[1:13:54] you just ah you need to prove how much
[1:13:58] you love God
[1:14:00] amen wait for God just hold back that
[1:14:02] knife and say now I know you love me
[1:14:04] first
[1:14:05] [Music]
[1:14:07] right because we all face the same thing
[1:14:09] all of us I don't care what color our
[1:14:11] skin is I don't care what gender we have
[1:14:14] as long as it's male or female and I
[1:14:16] don't care
[1:14:18] what country we're from I don't care
[1:14:20] what we're going through right
[1:14:24] we all need to put God first we got to
[1:14:28] have a love affair where he's number one
[1:14:32] now in your life God will prove you
[1:14:35] and you will prove God
[1:14:38] both of these things happen in the life
[1:14:40] of a Christian and this proving is all
[1:14:43] about what kind of relationship that we
[1:14:45] really have with God let me give you a
[1:14:47] couple examples here first is Malachi
[1:14:50] 310 and and you want to put that up
[1:14:52] there you can but you all know the
[1:14:55] scripture uh bring ye all the tithes
[1:14:59] into the storehouse that there may be
[1:15:01] meat in my table and look and prove all
[1:15:05] right prove me
[1:15:07] prove me now
[1:15:11] prove me now right now herewith saith
[1:15:15] the Lord of hosts
[1:15:16] if I will not open you the windows of
[1:15:20] heaven and pour you out a blessing that
[1:15:23] you shall not be uh not be room enough
[1:15:26] to receive it
[1:15:29] [Music]
[1:15:30] now those that are faithful
[1:15:33] have proved God to be faithful with that
[1:15:36] those who have skirted and not been
[1:15:40] completely faithful and did a little bit
[1:15:41] here and highly forget about this and
[1:15:43] God understands and you got your own
[1:15:45] quirks as of why you haven't been
[1:15:47] faithful I don't see God prospering it
[1:15:51] I'm just being honest with you
[1:15:55] another scripture now I'm not talking
[1:15:57] about ties so you can lighten up
[1:15:59] but I am talking about proving God and
[1:16:03] God proving you
[1:16:05] so we know the scripture brother Mark
[1:16:07] quotes it all the time seek ye first the
[1:16:09] kingdom of God and his righteousness and
[1:16:12] and all and all other things shall be
[1:16:14] added on to you so we're going to like
[1:16:17] prove God
[1:16:19] we gotta if we if we seek God with all
[1:16:22] of our hearts we seek the kingdom of God
[1:16:24] we put it first
[1:16:25] amen then God takes care of our life
[1:16:30] now those that only do it 90 of the way
[1:16:33] don't get everything added
[1:16:35] because God's still not first
[1:16:38] and it's all about relationship amen
[1:16:40] it's not about majority or or on a curve
[1:16:44] it's all about you proving God and God
[1:16:46] proving you
[1:16:48] now God proved the children of Israel
[1:16:50] Deuteronomy 8 2 this will be up on the
[1:16:52] board Deuteronomy 8 2
[1:16:55] and thou shall remember
[1:16:58] all the ways which the Lord thy God LED
[1:17:00] thee these 40 years in the wilderness
[1:17:05] well why do you do that
[1:17:07] the Bible says to Humble thee in other
[1:17:10] words you weren't humble and it took it
[1:17:12] took a long time to Humble you
[1:17:16] and what and to prove thee
[1:17:20] to know what was in thine heart
[1:17:26] well I thought he's God and he knows
[1:17:27] everything he wants it manifested amen
[1:17:31] it's manifesting time Brother Bruce to
[1:17:34] send that song a number of times it's
[1:17:36] manifesting time everything's being
[1:17:38] manifested
[1:17:40] how was the Liz off hell and the devil's
[1:17:42] being manifested
[1:17:45] to know what was in the heart which is
[1:17:48] important because we don't really know
[1:17:50] what's in our heart the majority of the
[1:17:52] time
[1:17:54] it's very deceptive
[1:17:56] whether thou what is keep his
[1:17:59] Commandments or no
[1:18:02] this is about relationship amen this
[1:18:04] proving is everything about relationship
[1:18:06] and he humbled thee and he suffereth
[1:18:09] thee to hunger and fed thee with manna
[1:18:12] which thou newest not neither did thy
[1:18:15] fathers know that he might make thee to
[1:18:18] know that that man doth not live by
[1:18:21] bread alone but by every word that
[1:18:23] proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord
[1:18:25] does Man live
[1:18:27] [Music]
[1:18:29] you know most of us are satisfied we're
[1:18:31] doing
[1:18:31] you know a lot
[1:18:34] and God's over here in the relationship
[1:18:36] he says I want to be first in everything
[1:18:43] the children of Israel
[1:18:46] what
[1:18:50] in a lot of the word
[1:18:52] they did but they did not walk in all
[1:18:54] the words they were they walked in a lot
[1:18:56] of the word that's why he he said these
[1:18:58] are my children I've come down
[1:19:00] to deliver them my children he called
[1:19:02] them
[1:19:03] but with many of them he wasn't pleased
[1:19:05] in afterwards he destroyed them
[1:19:08] so the key is we've got to follow all
[1:19:11] the word and he's going to prove us amen
[1:19:14] you know you know we got to get rid of
[1:19:16] this mindset well for the most part you
[1:19:18] know everybody likes me for the most
[1:19:20] part I'm doing this for the most part
[1:19:22] everything's okay with me and God
[1:19:25] God is interested in the parts that's
[1:19:27] not happening
[1:19:30] that's where God is at
[1:19:32] and then he uses trials to work on those
[1:19:35] things
[1:19:36] that's what he's using trials for and
[1:19:38] we've got to meet God there in the trial
[1:19:40] we've got to come to grips with what he
[1:19:42] wants us to do
[1:19:46] now we've all read this and I think
[1:19:48] brother Mark had maybe read this in
[1:19:50] Hebrews 3
[1:19:51] don't turn there I'm just going to read
[1:19:53] it real quick
[1:19:55] he said wherefore
[1:19:57] as the Holy Ghost say it today if you
[1:20:00] would hear his voice and heart not your
[1:20:01] heart is in the provocation the day of
[1:20:03] Temptation the Wilderness when your
[1:20:04] father's tempted me and what they proved
[1:20:07] me
[1:20:09] and saw my Works 40 years in other words
[1:20:11] God was faithful to them
[1:20:13] God God was faithful to them
[1:20:16] when they were not faithful to God yes
[1:20:21] that's how good God is
[1:20:24] and today every time we hear the word
[1:20:28] we have a choice
[1:20:30] to harden a heart or to unharden it
[1:20:35] to say God I want to obey what you've
[1:20:37] been speaking to me amen you know we all
[1:20:40] we would love to be in a church we're
[1:20:43] constantly
[1:20:45] who's ever at the pulpit is calling out
[1:20:47] something personal in everybody's life
[1:20:50] God told me this about you and God
[1:20:52] showed me that and this is what you need
[1:20:53] to do
[1:20:55] That's so exciting
[1:20:58] but what about the still small voice
[1:21:01] what about the way that he chose it to
[1:21:03] be
[1:21:04] I'm not against those other things I'm
[1:21:06] really not
[1:21:08] but relationship with God is much
[1:21:09] greater than that
[1:21:12] God proved the three Hebrews
[1:21:19] brother brother Bruce made mention of
[1:21:21] this God met them in the furnace
[1:21:26] he met them in the middle of the trial
[1:21:30] he wasn't on the outside when they were
[1:21:33] pushing him in
[1:21:35] he didn't say come on you guys we can do
[1:21:37] this together I'll be with you don't
[1:21:39] worry
[1:21:41] they didn't know what was going to
[1:21:43] happen they knew they had crossed the
[1:21:45] line that they were not going to bow
[1:21:49] they weren't going to say I'm not going
[1:21:51] to do part of I'm not going to have put
[1:21:54] something else before God
[1:21:59] and they walked in there by faith
[1:22:04] but because they were a part of God
[1:22:08] you can't burn God Amen they tried to
[1:22:12] burn John
[1:22:13] in boiling oil and they couldn't do that
[1:22:18] right if we're a part of God don't worry
[1:22:21] about the trial
[1:22:23] okay
[1:22:25] God will beat you there
[1:22:27] Isaiah 48 verse 10 says behold
[1:22:31] I have refined thee
[1:22:34] but not with silver
[1:22:37] he said I have chosen thee in the
[1:22:40] furnace of affliction
[1:22:43] remember
[1:22:44] I have you have not chosen me but I've
[1:22:47] chosen you
[1:22:49] from the foundation of the world
[1:22:52] but he chose you
[1:22:55] in the furnace of affliction
[1:22:59] here's the Beautiful You know I'm not
[1:23:01] trying to get us all psyched up about
[1:23:03] hey just blindly going trials and say
[1:23:05] well this is you know must happen I
[1:23:07] gotta just no I want you to walk in
[1:23:10] there with confidence that God is there
[1:23:13] you don't have to wonder now just
[1:23:16] literally Rejoice because the door of
[1:23:20] opportunity for character to be molded
[1:23:23] is about to happen
[1:23:25] it's about to happen by the choice I
[1:23:28] make when I'm facing this difficulty
[1:23:33] am I going to put God second
[1:23:35] because of this this this this and this
[1:23:39] or am I going to remain faithful
[1:23:42] because that's exactly what job did he
[1:23:46] remained faithful look God proved Daniel
[1:23:48] in the Lion's Den and Daniel
[1:23:51] proved God
[1:23:55] they prove one another
[1:24:01] sure we're going to face
[1:24:04] um have you ever been
[1:24:06] faced persecution by your family
[1:24:10] for doing something right so here here
[1:24:14] Daniel praying
[1:24:16] and he was going to face
[1:24:18] a persecution he knew that
[1:24:22] but he kept moving forward because it
[1:24:24] was the will of God and that's what you
[1:24:25] got to remember when it's the will of
[1:24:27] God you keep moving forward
[1:24:30] and so here Daniel goes into the lion's
[1:24:33] den
[1:24:36] and now this is where Daniel
[1:24:40] is going to see if God is faithful
[1:24:45] of course he knew he was going to be
[1:24:47] but it wasn't just intellectual
[1:24:49] knowledge
[1:24:51] the proof is in the pudding
[1:24:54] he went down there and that's where God
[1:24:56] was taking care of those lions
[1:25:00] making him such an enjoyable pillow for
[1:25:03] the night
[1:25:05] so God proved
[1:25:09] uh Daniel
[1:25:10] that he was going to remain faithful and
[1:25:12] open those doors and keep praying no
[1:25:14] matter what the persecution was
[1:25:16] and then there in the middle of the
[1:25:18] trial Daniel proved that God was
[1:25:20] faithful by remaining
[1:25:24] do you love the word
[1:25:26] amen Zechariah 13 9.
[1:25:30] I will bring the third part through the
[1:25:33] fire
[1:25:34] and will refine them as silver is
[1:25:36] refined
[1:25:38] and will try them as gold as tried they
[1:25:42] shall call on my name and I will hear
[1:25:45] them
[1:25:47] I will say it is my people and they
[1:25:49] shall see the Lord is my God
[1:25:52] so what are we going to do in the middle
[1:25:54] of the trial call on the Lord
[1:25:57] there was a time that they had a trap
[1:25:59] set for brother Branham
[1:26:02] I believe it was a Ministerial
[1:26:04] Association and it's one of the states
[1:26:07] here
[1:26:09] and um
[1:26:11] God had showed them that there was going
[1:26:13] to be a trap and brother branham's
[1:26:15] initial reaction is this okay well I
[1:26:17] won't go then
[1:26:19] thanks for warning me
[1:26:21] I won't go
[1:26:23] right and God said no you're going
[1:26:26] you're going you're going to go and
[1:26:29] you're going to face this trial you're
[1:26:31] going to get there you're he says
[1:26:34] I'll be with you
[1:26:38] and when you know God is with you you
[1:26:40] can have boldness yeah
[1:26:43] yeah not arrogancy right
[1:26:45] not haughtiness
[1:26:47] [Music]
[1:26:50] but just boldness
[1:26:54] and you know
[1:26:57] they even testified
[1:26:59] you know you may disagree with his
[1:27:01] Doctrine
[1:27:03] but I'll tell you what he's Fearless in
[1:27:05] what he believes
[1:27:07] and that's how we got to be when we're
[1:27:09] in a trial
[1:27:11] I believe that God is going to help me
[1:27:13] he's with me right now amen
[1:27:18] crazy
[1:27:19] First Peter chapter 1 verse 6 boy we
[1:27:22] have to we have to hurry
[1:27:24] wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now
[1:27:27] for a season if need be if need be
[1:27:30] air in heaviness through manifold
[1:27:32] Temptations so who determines if you
[1:27:34] need to be in a trial
[1:27:39] so I want you to stop saying well this
[1:27:42] wouldn't have happened if you wouldn't
[1:27:43] have
[1:27:44] you're not allowed to say that anymore
[1:27:47] that the trial of your faith being much
[1:27:50] more precious than gold that perish it
[1:27:53] though it be tried with fire might be
[1:27:57] found unto praise
[1:27:59] and honor and glory amen where at the
[1:28:05] peering of Christ of Jesus Christ why
[1:28:07] then because that's that's what you're
[1:28:09] taking with you when you leave is your
[1:28:11] character it's the only thing you're
[1:28:13] taking with you when you leave is your
[1:28:14] character
[1:28:16] whom having not seen look it's all about
[1:28:19] love relationship these this this is all
[1:28:22] about love relationship who whom having
[1:28:25] not seen you love in whom now you see
[1:28:28] him not yet believing that's how you
[1:28:30] overcame he Rejoice with joy unspeakable
[1:28:34] and full of Glory receiving the end of
[1:28:38] your faith even the salvation of your
[1:28:40] souls I'll say don't you take your foot
[1:28:42] off the pedal until you're in the
[1:28:45] rapture
[1:28:47] don't do what this the snake of laodicea
[1:28:50] is trying to get everybody in the
[1:28:52] message to do is just lay back don't you
[1:28:54] take your foot off the gas
[1:28:58] remember God's thoughts of you are
[1:29:00] eternal
[1:29:03] our thoughts
[1:29:07] in our trials
[1:29:08] are like up and down they're all over
[1:29:10] the place
[1:29:12] we must settle down in the middle of our
[1:29:14] trial
[1:29:16] and line up with God's original thoughts
[1:29:20] which we know that he wouldn't put us in
[1:29:22] the spot if it wasn't for our good
[1:29:26] I'm glad that God is interested in
[1:29:28] building my character because I'll be
[1:29:30] honest with you there's times that I
[1:29:31] don't even think about it
[1:29:34] I am so interested in doing what I want
[1:29:36] to do that I am not even thinking about
[1:29:38] it
[1:29:41] it's not about doing some do's and
[1:29:43] don'ts you got here's the three things I
[1:29:46] want you to do today this is my world do
[1:29:48] these three things and the rest of the
[1:29:49] day is yours
[1:29:52] it's not like that
[1:29:54] brother Branham
[1:29:56] uh I gotta I gotta I'm gonna read you a
[1:30:00] quote here in a second that this is
[1:30:01] important
[1:30:03] we know what God speaks must come to
[1:30:05] pass
[1:30:07] and what God has spoken of us
[1:30:11] is going to come to pass there's no
[1:30:13] doubt about it
[1:30:14] but where most Believers miss it is that
[1:30:17] they don't have to do anything
[1:30:20] you know you just sit there and God does
[1:30:22] it all
[1:30:25] things
[1:30:28] don't happen
[1:30:32] without
[1:30:34] you making the right decision let me
[1:30:36] just say this things do we know that
[1:30:38] there is a part that God plays
[1:30:41] but we don't sit back as if character is
[1:30:44] a gift and we don't have to do anything
[1:30:46] right
[1:30:47] character is not a gift it's a victory
[1:30:50] which means you must make a choice
[1:30:55] to overcome in your trial to get
[1:30:58] character and so this is what I'm saying
[1:31:00] you have a part to play and most people
[1:31:03] don't think about this
[1:31:05] they just they oh yeah God's gonna do it
[1:31:07] God's gonna do it God's gonna do it
[1:31:10] and they want to leave the trial
[1:31:12] there's no proving
[1:31:14] we ought to be interested and really I
[1:31:17] want character to be manifested in me
[1:31:19] let me read this quote to you brother
[1:31:20] Brian said in the samura church age he
[1:31:22] said unless we suffer with him we cannot
[1:31:25] reign with him
[1:31:27] you have to suffer to Reign the reason
[1:31:29] for this is that character simply is
[1:31:31] never made without suffering
[1:31:35] character is a victory not a gift
[1:31:38] a man without character can't Reign
[1:31:39] because power apart from
[1:31:42] character is satanic
[1:31:45] but Power with character is fit to rule
[1:31:47] and since he wants us to share even his
[1:31:50] throne on the same basis that he
[1:31:51] overcame and has set down in his
[1:31:53] father's Throne then we have to overcome
[1:31:57] to sit with him
[1:32:01] but be of good cheer I have overcome
[1:32:05] and the little temporal temporary
[1:32:08] suffering we go through now is not
[1:32:11] worthy to be compared with the
[1:32:13] tremendous Glory that shall be revealed
[1:32:14] in us when he comes oh what a treasure
[1:32:17] are laid up for those
[1:32:20] who are willing
[1:32:23] to enter in his kingdom through much
[1:32:25] tribulation
[1:32:27] it's basically a different attitude
[1:32:30] I I are you with me
[1:32:33] stay excited about the word
[1:32:36] don't oh my my I I don't like doing this
[1:32:39] I don't like having to throw away half
[1:32:42] of my message every time I come up here
[1:32:49] you have a part to play this is
[1:32:50] important
[1:32:53] when God created everything
[1:32:56] that didn't have a free more agency
[1:33:00] it automatically obeyed them
[1:33:03] but when he created beans with a
[1:33:05] Freemore agency
[1:33:08] they didn't always obey him
[1:33:10] right so remember when Jesus he
[1:33:14] descended from the mount
[1:33:16] and the starchy Pharisees who didn't
[1:33:18] like
[1:33:20] praise you know made him feel
[1:33:21] uncomfortable basically they weren't
[1:33:24] getting praised and I mean they probably
[1:33:26] like praise when they were getting
[1:33:27] praised
[1:33:29] but they didn't like humbling themselves
[1:33:30] to praise
[1:33:32] God
[1:33:34] and so they came to Jesus said will you
[1:33:36] tell them to hold their peace
[1:33:38] tell them to be quiet he said well if
[1:33:40] they hold their peace
[1:33:43] if they who have a free more agency hold
[1:33:45] their peace then these rocks who don't
[1:33:48] have a free more agency they're going to
[1:33:50] cry out praise me because it has been
[1:33:52] spoken that there should be praise given
[1:33:55] at this time
[1:34:00] so God's word demands
[1:34:04] praise
[1:34:11] God made us with a free more agency
[1:34:14] we must agree with his thoughts
[1:34:19] so the scripture says for I know the
[1:34:21] thoughts I think towards you saith the
[1:34:22] Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil
[1:34:24] to give you in an expected end
[1:34:27] we must line up with his thoughts to get
[1:34:31] the expected end
[1:34:33] this is no blindness God did not make us
[1:34:36] a mountain a tree a planet a dog a hippo
[1:34:41] he made us a human being with a free
[1:34:43] more agency
[1:34:45] so our will must be submitted to his
[1:34:47] will we must align our thoughts with his
[1:34:50] thoughts we must align our will with his
[1:34:52] will in order for there to be an
[1:34:54] expected end for us and that's just all
[1:34:56] there is to it if we're predestinated it
[1:34:58] will happen
[1:35:01] now I'm not talking about failures I'm
[1:35:04] not talking about mistakes
[1:35:05] I'm talking about outright disobedience
[1:35:11] no one is without mistakes
[1:35:15] we need submission to the whole word we
[1:35:17] can't leave part of it out we need to be
[1:35:19] zealous and and repent and we need to
[1:35:22] submit our life to God
[1:35:28] we can't stare at I've got this perfect
[1:35:31] relationship for a Rapture because I got
[1:35:33] this Badge of attendance
[1:35:37] we got to get back in line how Jesus
[1:35:40] said it with every word that proceedeth
[1:35:42] out of the mouth of God we just must we
[1:35:45] got to get rid of our double-mindedness
[1:35:47] amen get rid of our lusting for our will
[1:35:51] or judging others or our pride or
[1:35:53] arrogancy
[1:35:55] we need to let the mind that was in
[1:35:57] Christ Jesus be in US
[1:36:00] as he submitted himself to the father we
[1:36:02] must submit ourselves to the word of God
[1:36:05] and then
[1:36:07] we can have the correct expectation
[1:36:10] that we'll have an expected him
[1:36:14] second Timothy chapter two don't turn
[1:36:16] there we don't have time second Timothy
[1:36:17] 2 21 says if a man therefore Purge
[1:36:21] himself from these things he shall be a
[1:36:25] vessel so there is a part that you play
[1:36:27] it must go through three more agency
[1:36:30] all right Isaiah 50 55 verse 6 and I'm
[1:36:35] just going to try to hurry is just as
[1:36:37] best as I can
[1:36:39] and I know because you love me
[1:36:41] you'll be patient with me
[1:36:45] and if you if you're not patient with me
[1:36:48] then you know there's something that you
[1:36:50] need to pray about because you're going
[1:36:51] through a trial
[1:36:54] Isaiah 55 verse 6. seek ye the Lord
[1:36:58] while he may be found
[1:37:00] call ye upon and while he's near let the
[1:37:03] wicked forsake his way
[1:37:08] and the unrighteous man what his
[1:37:10] thoughts
[1:37:11] and let him return unto the Lord and He
[1:37:15] will have mercy upon them and to our God
[1:37:17] for he will abundantly you know God is
[1:37:20] just so good
[1:37:22] he's just looking for us to let him be
[1:37:25] first
[1:37:26] he said for my thoughts are not your
[1:37:28] thoughts neither are my ways uh neither
[1:37:32] are your ways my ways saith the Lord
[1:37:35] for as the heaven is higher than the
[1:37:36] earth Soul or my my way is higher than
[1:37:39] your ways and my thoughts than your
[1:37:40] thoughts for as the rain cometh down and
[1:37:43] the snow from Heaven return if not then
[1:37:45] there but watereth the Earth and maketh
[1:37:46] it bring forth and Bud look at that
[1:37:49] grass seed when you leave may you
[1:37:50] remember this service that it may give
[1:37:52] seed to the sower and bread to the eater
[1:37:56] so shall my word be that go forth out of
[1:37:58] my mouth it shall not return to me Glory
[1:38:00] but it shall accomplish that which I
[1:38:01] please and it shall prosper anything
[1:38:03] we're into I sent it so you don't have
[1:38:05] to be afraid of the trials right amen
[1:38:10] you have to be scared
[1:38:13] you can know that God is with you
[1:38:17] now
[1:38:19] it may take a couple it may take a while
[1:38:21] to go through trials
[1:38:24] before you get purified
[1:38:27] it took seven Church ages to get a bride
[1:38:29] ready without spot a wrinkle
[1:38:32] it took the dipping in muddy Jordan
[1:38:34] seven times for Naaman to be purified
[1:38:36] [Music]
[1:38:38] Psalms
[1:38:40] chapter 12 verse 6 this is the words of
[1:38:42] the Lord are pure words as silver tried
[1:38:45] in a furnace of Earth
[1:38:47] purified
[1:38:49] seven times
[1:38:51] so if you're going through something for
[1:38:54] a while I mean job went through a trial
[1:38:56] that I from what I understand from what
[1:38:58] I read it was it was with about a year
[1:39:00] within a year
[1:39:02] that's a long time
[1:39:04] to go without knowing your remedy
[1:39:08] without without without really
[1:39:12] having God come and just
[1:39:15] make it real clear
[1:39:17] he's walking by faith
[1:39:19] amen we need to accept God's plan for
[1:39:22] our life and our trials don't fight God
[1:39:25] don't fight his will don't tell God he's
[1:39:28] wrong amen
[1:39:30] just because this is happening he knows
[1:39:33] what he's doing
[1:39:35] first John chapter 3 verse 1 says behold
[1:39:37] what manner of love here it is love
[1:39:39] relationship what manner of love the
[1:39:41] father bestowed upon us that we should
[1:39:43] be called the sons of God therefore the
[1:39:44] world knoweth that's not because it knew
[1:39:46] him not but we know him beloved now are
[1:39:50] we remember we read that scripture now
[1:39:53] are we the sons of God
[1:39:56] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:39:58] be but we know that when he shall appear
[1:39:59] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:40:01] him as he is
[1:40:03] and so every man that has this hope in
[1:40:06] him purifies himself even as he is pure
[1:40:11] in other words he allows himself to go
[1:40:14] through the trials
[1:40:16] for the purpose of becoming more like
[1:40:18] Christ
[1:40:20] amen and it's a love that he's bestowed
[1:40:22] upon us what matter of love the father's
[1:40:25] bestowed you know many people go through
[1:40:27] trials and they don't see God in fact
[1:40:29] they Curse God how many people do we
[1:40:30] know
[1:40:31] actually get mad at God because
[1:40:34] something happened in their life
[1:40:44] oh my Psalms 26 1 Judge Me O Lord for I
[1:40:50] have walked
[1:40:52] in my Integrity I have trusted also in
[1:40:55] the Lord therefore I shall not slide
[1:40:58] examine Me O Lord and prove me and try
[1:41:01] my Reigns
[1:41:03] and my heart now this was a Psalm of
[1:41:06] David
[1:41:07] his heart wanted to be examined with
[1:41:10] sincerity
[1:41:13] amen
[1:41:16] all right
[1:41:18] I just want to read you one more
[1:41:20] scripture it's in Philippians chapter 2
[1:41:22] turn with me if you would there
[1:41:26] it's okay for God to try us
[1:41:30] amen we could
[1:41:33] did I say one more scripture
[1:41:38] yes praise the lord we got an amen there
[1:41:43] well
[1:41:45] if I only got one more scripture
[1:41:51] you read that when you get home
[1:41:53] because if I only got one I'm only going
[1:41:55] to do one I'm gonna do Hebrews chapter
[1:41:58] 13 verse 5.
[1:42:00] remember no man
[1:42:03] can pluck you out of the father's hand
[1:42:06] so no matter what you're going through
[1:42:08] no
[1:42:09] God will not put anything on you that
[1:42:11] you can't bear he will make a way of
[1:42:13] Escape
[1:42:15] so when you're going through trials
[1:42:18] I want you to remember
[1:42:20] to meet God inside your trials that's
[1:42:22] what this service was about
[1:42:24] Hebrews 13 Verse 5 says let your
[1:42:26] conversation
[1:42:27] be without wantonness
[1:42:31] without wanting
[1:42:34] and be content with such things as you
[1:42:36] have
[1:42:37] for he have said I will never leave you
[1:42:40] nor forsake thee
[1:42:43] so that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[1:42:46] helper
[1:42:47] and I will not fear
[1:42:49] what man shall do unto me
[1:42:51] amen let's Stand Together
