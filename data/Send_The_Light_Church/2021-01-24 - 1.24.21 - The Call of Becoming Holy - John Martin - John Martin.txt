sister donna this morning before i knew you were there before i knew you were here uh brother bruce kept coming to my mind brother bruce i said what is this what is this but now i know and what a great blessing it is to have you i want to thank you for your support and watching through the live streaming all the times that you did and just every service thinking of you and um brother marty sister kathy i'm sure they're piping in uh today we we miss you we know that you're always in each service and uh brother roger this morning it made mention that he misses being here mrs you want to give his greetings and if we could just continue to pray for them until they return uh very shortly next week uh god is blessing them and we just pray that god continues to do so amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of saint peter chapter one as we want to continue on in our series of of church order praise the lord we've got a four scriptures starting with verse 13 through 16 we want to read before we begin reading there let's look to the author of this word amen heavenly father we're not worthy to look upon these words they are they're holy they're righteous they're pure and they were written and created by god who's holy righteous and pure and we're unworthy unholy creatures to look upon a holy word but lord you've you've allowed us grace and you've you you've told us to to that we're blessed to just read your word lord the blessings fall upon us if we just take time to read it so you've you've given us grace to to read your word lord and naturally lord you've you've given us all schooling and ability to read the words of this book in our language and we're thankful for this lord and even the message of this hour in in english when it you could have sent a prophet to to any nation lord you sent him to our nation we're grateful for this lord before we read lord we recognize even with these blessings you've given and the ability to read we still need the holy ghost to come and give us revelation of this word and we pray that lord that your power and your spirit would be in each one of our hearts in our minds and our understandings that you just open us up uh open uh this word up to us lord that we might receive the very intention lord that you've written it for us god we give you the praise the honor and glory for these things remember lord every need that would be amongst us father as the word comes forth may there be a faith that would rise in our heart for whatever the need would be today give you the praise for these things in jesus precious name we pray amen amen praise the lord first peter chapter one starting with verse number 13 wherefore gird up the loins of your mind be sober and hope to the end for the grace that is to be brought unto you at the revelation of jesus christ as obedient children not fashioning yourselves according to the form or lust in your ignorance but as he which is but as he which have called you is holy so be holy in all manner of conversation because it is written be ye holy for i am holy god bless you may be seated this morning we're certainly not worthy uh not only to read this book but to preach this sermon knowing i don't know i've never experienced it before but i don't know if you get to a place where you feel like you are holy i don't know for speaking for me um this series on church order has been beyond challenging to me but has pointed me to where i've been out of order and i'm sure there are other things that are out of order that i don't even know about yet and uh i i can't put enough emphasis today on my wife who has been such an inspiration for this series uh uh outside of i'll say it's like this that god i believe used my wife to uh to bring about a better order and this something that's been god had been uh dealing with her about and of course my view was god is going to work on these things individually with people and um but seeing a need uh for teaching church order amen it's just something that has fallen through the cracks i think in 2002 we preached it in two thousand uh sixteen and and and here and here it is uh five years later and it it's something that needs to to be reviewed on on a yearly by yearly basis and and i've it's just definitely slipped and um i praise god for church order today i praise god for what he's doing to this series i praise god for the number of people have have come and said to me what is transpiring in their life and there's just been a number of people and i i thank the lord for it and i thank the lord for what he's he's he's doing in my life because he's he's calling us to a place that we're not there amen we had uh four parts uh to this series of church order first being god is a god of order the second god's order of reverence and respect to kind of sum up um you know we could talk about a lot of kings and uh magistrates and people down through the ages uh that were were kings that were emperors that were rulers that were presidents and and yet they were mean and evil and they called the shots but um and what they say it went but there was there was no righteousness there was no judgment and uh the god and that yet they were trying to have order of their kingdoms and when we think of nero i mean it's just history of how many uh christians he killed and how ruthless he was yet our god he's a god of order of reverence and respect and that's what he's called us to amen in part three we we talked about behaving in god's house and we're going to continue in that uh um as we as we further go on and in part four showing respect in god's house i don't think we can do too much respect we can't get to a place where we feel like we've achieved uh enough amen today we want to title this the call of becoming holy the call of becoming holy according to hebrews chapter 12 verse 14 we know that without holiness that none of us are going to see the lord amen so it's very important uh that we we pay attention to the importance of the subject holiness if god requires holiness from us then we he must be calling us to holiness amen can you can you say amen to that if if he he requires of us then he he's calling us to it amen first thessalonians chapter 4 verse 7 says for god have not called us unto uncleanness but unto holiness as soon as we come out and and we're born and and and as soon as we begin to be able to manifest our true nature it is selfish to the core we will begin to manipulate our mom our dad our brothers our sisters to get what not to get righteousness not to get holiness but to get what we want and and when it's young we think it's cute and when it gets old we put them in jail it just it's just the way it is but god is calling us unto holiness how many can hear the gospel call unto holiness amen god is holy and he's calling us to be holy in all manner of conversations now those of you that think that has just to do about how you talk it's not it's about our behavior amen it's in everything it's all about us it's it's the way that we behave so we don't want to look at holiness as a gift given by god to just certain individuals that he esteems to be his favorites it is also not merited through even sincere works or desires or efforts it's really god's spirit living inside of us manifesting his holiness through us it's the only way we can become holy is have a holy god in us otherwise a man at his very best is what all vanity so as we yield to the call god will draw us into becoming more like him and as we yield ourselves to god we'll automatically become more holy because that is what he's calling us to it starts with a right attitude now notice a number of times in the bible the bible says that if we would when we hear the word if we would harden not our hearts it's an attitude there's a connection there between the attitude that we have and how will we how our heart is going to be if satan can ever get us to think that we're already holy enough or i'll never be holy he has already defeated you he has stopped you in your tracks we need a different attitude to start with a right attitude an attitude that confesses i will walk towards the direction that god is calling me to amen just take the first step the bible says draw nigh to god he'll draw an eye to you you you've got to and every one of you at one moment this morning was laying in bed and you opened your eyes and you probably wondered what time is it [Laughter] what time is it but every one of you here today had determined in your heart that i'm going to go to church and so you made that that decision in your mind i'm going to walk towards that so when you originally had that you weren't here number of steps had to be made right like i said a number of times the wheels had to turn on the road to get here but it started with a thought that i'm going to go to church and it's the same thing with becoming holy it starts with a direction that i'm going to become holy i'm going in this direction amen it's important if god's calling us to holiness then holiness is a direction that i'm heading towards so let's look at the type of attitude we need to have in romans chapter 6 verse 11. romans chapter 6 verse 11 likewise reckon ye your soul also yourselves to be dead indeed unto sin but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord so you we reckon ourselves to be dead now every one of us just think about this for a second every one of us sinned yesterday we we've sinned today perhaps in our thoughts okay so so now it's not a matter of can i make it to a day to where i can say i i i i i'm like god no we have to have the attitude that i am going to die out to the lord and i am going to to walk towards christ and be alive unto god so it's it's a reckoning of yourselves to be dead as long as we're as long as we're not thinking that we need to die out it's hard to get anywhere with god so we have to reckon ourselves in a position like right now you can go to your house right now in your mind and you can go into a certain room and you know exactly where the bread is at or where the trash can is at because you you you have it visualized in your head you you recognize it right and you have to reckon yourself as dead because as long as you think you're just wild and do everything you want you're going to do anything you want so you have to reckon yourself dead amen let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body now who's in control that you are that's why the prophet could say you are your greatest enemy let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that ye should obey it in the lust thereof neither you ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for you're not under the law but under grace you just you confess it you can just as you have to confess i'm a believer i believe in god i believe that jesus died for me you have to confess sin is not going to have dominion over me you can't wait till it's gone to say it your children of abraham you have to say it before it happens there's something about the power that's behind the words that come out of your mouth think about this you you could walk into a perfect situation a perfect conversation a perfect atmosphere and you come in with a negativity oh me oh my and before you know it everything just comes down so your words are powerful and and according to uh to if you can put it up there and it's uh hebrews chapter three verse one it's not my notes but it came let's let's read that we're for holy brother and partakers of the heavenly calling consider the apostle high priest of our profession right amen if you profess positivity in your life god is going to stand for that but if it's negativity how is god going to be a high priest of a negative profession he can't do nothing so we must remain positive and we got to confess i'm not going to allow this thing in my life i'm going to work at getting rid of it i'm not under the law i don't need to listen to the devil i i i could have victory over it's through jesus christ who's going to give me a victory with the right attitude we can bring god on the scene we can begin to slice away the things that are in our life that we don't want there a little bit by a little bit i'll tell you it's all because of the selfish behavior ephesians chapter 4 verse 22 that she put off concerning the former conversations the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to his deceitful lust now every one of us that has sinned has been deceived and the devil tricks us we yes we should know better and and and and yes uh uh we ought to be doing better and yes we've done it before so there's another reason we but i'm telling you the devil tricks us comes from 15 different angles to do the same thing so we need to put off the former behavior which is corrupt according to deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that ye put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness now to put on now to put on i mean when i when i before i ever came in this message and i went to a church and they wore the robes and all this to me that was the representation of holiness on earth but that could be just an outside we don't know you understand but there is a true holiness that comes from the heart of man that's where it lies if you receive the holiness of god in your life it's not a put on it comes from the heart and and and it's it's true holiness notice after we recognize god is calling us to become more holy our attitude needs to to be that we want to put off a former behavior our formal behavior how we act so we're making a decision to go in the right direction and change the way that we think about things to be renewed in the spirit of our mind that's how we look at things like what really is holy is holy just you know that man that's standing behind the pulpit and he's dressed in these robes and we call that holy is that really no we got to change that because holiness is is is something that god is dealing with inside of every one of us think about this you are the temple of the holy ghost and god dwells in holy temples so he's working on the inside jesus on the inside working on the outside we don't we're not worried about the outside until the inside sees the holiness of god right we need to let the holy spirit teach us how to become more holy amen we're learning to put on the new man the bible says which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness with new goals new attitude new behavior new outlet new determination we can expect us to become a new man but if we don't change the way we think we are not going to change at all brother branham said the right mental attitude towards any divine promise of god will bring it to pass now divine promise well we can read and peter there where ad talks about the divine nature of god and and that add to to faith and virtue and these are promises that god has given us by these uh precious promises that we in we can become god's nature and um we need to have faith for these things in our life they're not just going to happen but we've got to believe for them we gotta have their the right mental attitude as the prophet said and uh i heard read a quote many years ago and i've i've quoted i don't have it written here but i believe it was uh uh by a man named james something that um the greatest discovery of any generation is that a man can alter his life by altering his attitude it starts with i believe i'm heading i'm going but if we're going to sit there and wait for feelings to change our our circumstances to change and all things around us to change before we're going to be moving in a certain direction it will never happen because there's a free more agency that god is dealing with and that's why i'm saying it is faith is simple you you just you step out of of you step out onto the water and say i'm going towards jesus as we learn to drop our selfish attitude and begin to look at things more the way that god wants us to look at them which is basically living for others right not selfish live for others our love will increase and as our love increases so were our holiness yes here's scripture first thessalonians chapter 3 verse 20 verse 12. first thessalonians chapter 3 verse 12. we're just pointing out certain ways to walk towards holiness here and the lord make you to increase and abound in love towards me towards one another and towards all men even as we do towards you to the end to the end now we're talking about the end of this he may establish your hearts unblameable in holiness before god even our father at the coming of our lord jesus christ with all saints so god is going to be looking for a holy bride that's what he's coming for we might as well put attention to it we might as well come to grips with what we need to come to grips with to become what god is for god is holy be he holy amen that's the scripture and so we need to dive into in our personal lives we need to get into the message and and look at where god is speaking to us about becoming that inside the message because a man-made church and a man way thinking in the way that god would try to interpret holiness to us is off we can't go by that it needs to become a personal revelation to us we cannot depend upon what's being preached to us to become a revelation now what i mean by that is we can sit in church for service after service never be in the spirit never hear what god is saying and say well i didn't hear that that's why we're not going to have any any quotes today from the prophet but we're probably going to have a service where we're going to talk about the quotes of of this just the whole thing but i wanted to lay a foundation scripturally that is not just coming from a man but this is from god this call to be hol to be holy is really from god and so often when we listen to the message our whole mind is already set on what we're looking for and we we are we don't just lay uh like the prophet said we come to church to find out where we're at in other words i don't know where we're at i'll be honest with you i'm i'm a a sheep that needs to make sure that i'm on the right track today and so when we listen to the tapes we're we're just looking for okay and i'm i'm not against any of that but the thing is if we're not open we're going to miss a lot of things through the tapes that god could be speaking to us about church order about how to get our lives in order and how to become more holy too often satan will try to trip up believers into thinking that since certain things have changed in their lives and that they've arrived to god's standard of holiness never feeling a need to go on to more holiness i'm doing this now i didn't used to do that i'm doing this now i didn't used to do that therefore i don't have to put much attention to holiness second corinthians chapter seven verse one tells us having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh into the spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god i have not perfected holiness has anybody the requirement is fear fear the lord i could be wrong lord show me so obviously there still is a cleansing needed because it says from all filthiness of the flesh not just the part that we that we did clean up we can testify we clean that up it's and and and we're good now well you're good now in that area right and and they god gives us that if i could say it like that but god is still calling us to be more like him now you know the army when they put you in the army they don't just set everybody down and they say look we're going to be starting boot camp here pretty soon i want you to understand is we're into this boob cup at any time that you feel that you're being pushed too much and things are a little bit too hard on you and you i just want you to raise your hand and then uh you don't have to do anything more than you feel you're capable of doing okay but see that's the way we want the gospel preached to us don't challenge me don't push me god god knows that you're his bride you just have to believe that and start walking in that not feeling this is too hard for me this is too much you've got to believe that you're going to become exactly the way god wants you to become but the thinking the attitude the heart that has to be right let's get straight with god the army they push you they push you they push you how many times have we seen somebody come out of the army they go in one way they come out of the army and they're just more they come out of the army and they still stand straight they still they still act the way they were taught a lot of them i mean maybe after a time they they go different but what i'm saying here is that god's trying to train us amen amen and he wants us to become holy in all manner of conversation he wants us to perfect us so we need the attitude of pressing towards the end result and not being satisfied at the area that you are in right now holiness is a divine calling from god it's it's for a chosen group it's it's not everybody doesn't receive it everybody that goes in the army does not become the elite they do not become special ops or green beret it's all that came out all of god's children that came out of egypt did not go into the promised land we're not chosen to go into the promised land right everybody that's called into this message and everybody that has come into the message does not go into the rapture because our prophet told us that there is a voice inside a voice there is a message inside of the message and there is a calling inside this what we're calling it's not just to a message and not just to a group it's not just i'm behind brother branham it's it's to be miss jesus so we have to go beyond the seed of comfortability-ness to making sure that there's a fear of god inside of his life i must hit the mark i must reach forth i must become all that he's called me to become amen amen first peter chapter 2 verse 9 but ye are a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation you look around and think well who's who's you know what's which nation is holy which is right and we think about when we brother branson says with every nation and nationality there's a spirit behind it and and and peter's talking about that we us sitting here today we're a part of a holy nation it's separated from this world it's separated from other churches it's separated from other believers it's it's been called to god amen we're a peculiar people that's why people look at you and they say oh you're you're you're you're weird you're strange yeah i i feel uh you know i just i have a hard time connecting you know it's okay it's really okay that just showing that you're you're connected with god amen that you should show forth the praises of him that have called you out of darkness into his marvelous light praise god which in times past we're not a people but are now the people of god which have not obtained mercy but now have have obtained mercy amen and those of us who are taking this seriously i'm saying we're part of a holy nation amen keep marching keep marching because in every nation there's needs there's needs there's there's things to fulfill right we're part of god's holy nation we've got a job to do amen amen god has called us to be holy it's a divine calling it's a divine order of god it doesn't happen on its own it doesn't happen with church attendance it is something that has to be worked on in other words you have to have the attitude make the decision this is the direction i want to go lord what do you want me to do how do i do it you have to believe the word beyond feeling that you're holy you have to believe it not easy it's not as easy as for a woman to put on a dress or for a man to cut his hair i don't know if brother um brother want to call you brother ron i want to call you brother roger brother bruce i wonder if brother bruce sister don't ever remember me having long hair no no okay so but when i first came you know i had long hair and when i cut that hair and i honestly i wanted to talk to brother larry about this he's not here and i can either get his permission afterwards or you know usually don't get permission afterwards but uh but uh you know just cutting my hair didn't make me holy it didn't make me holy putting a dress on doesn't make a woman holy it's not that easy it's not about the law of following do's and don'ts it starts with a right attitude and it's walking towards god's holiness now god will tell the men to cut their hair and when he does and you do it that is god's holiness in you and you're walking towards it but that is not the the completion that's not the the the perfection that's not the um it's not the establishment of it it is just a step but it's it's how we act and how we think and what we do paul said cleansing ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and the spirit and the spirit so if i cut my hair there's no you don't see a spirit we know there's a spirit behind it right but what about the spirit and everything else i do right that's true you know we don't see one another's spirit right it's true but we know that our spirits can become filthy right amen and we need to cleanse ourselves in other words it has to go through your gait a free more agency where you say i'm i'm done with this i'm not going to just yield to this thing i i'm going to put it away god fill me with your spirit and and that's where you are cleansing yourself from all filthiness of the flesh and the spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of god amen in the fear of god amen praise the lord first we need to recognize the calling that god is calling us to no man can come unless god calls first in other words it's not in our lost nature of a man to recognize a holy god no it takes god to knock on the door of our heart and say i am here and you are there and i'm calling you and that's what god does when we hear the word of god he speaks to our heart he he gets a hold of us and he lets us know something that we weren't thinking of that we weren't looking at and and when we see that and we respond to that i'm so grateful that it is the nature of god to knock on the children of his his his his lost children that are out of the way and to get him back in line because it's not in my human nature to go help anybody i know my human nature is to live for myself to lust after myself to give me everything i want for myself because that's who i was before i came to christ and i know even since then satan wants to get in there but that's why the nature of god is always to look for those who are lost and to get them back god is calling us to holiness there's something inside of the child of god that when he hears the call and he responds as jesus said in john chapter 10 verse 27 my sheep hear my voice i know them and what happens when they leave the church they follow me god is not calling us here to church attendance just no he's calling us to follow him every day every step of the way and when we hear god calling us to holiness we respond yes lord i will i will i will now he's dealing with every one of us in different areas just respond to the call stay away from i'm there stay away from i can't i don't got this straight stay away from both of those ends both of them are not with humility we come right down the middle say lord not my will thy will be done i believe i'm a believer we as god's children respond to god's call on to holiness now that god has got our attention we begin he begins to unveil himself to us that he is righteous and holy and as he unveils himself we begin to identify that's what we're supposed to become that's the reason that he unveils himself think about when he made man in his own image he didn't make him a selfish man a selfish nature he did that which god orchestrated him to do amen he made him a holy man he was holy and that's what god's calling us to now this is this to me this is why this age here is the hardest age of all ages because this is the age that we have so much more to satisfy us so much more that we can enjoy so much more that we can we can get satisfaction from the first time in even in the prophet's age he he did not have the world at his fingertips in a foam i'm i don't know if he he saw it or not but it doesn't make a difference i'm telling you it's much harder today than when he walked we have to defy so much of the flesh to become holy and the devil says go over here enjoy this enjoy that do this do that there's nothing wrong with this and before you know it we're so consumed with the things of the world that we're forgetting what we're being called to as god unveils his holiness to each of us he's magnifying his holiness just how pure he is how clean how true how right how powerful how mighty this is what's happening when god is unveiling his holiness he's opening our eyes to what he already is we may be able to say with no problem god is holy but what does that mean what does that mean people in denominations could go to church and say he's holy every car every church saying holy holy holy but what does that really mean i mean the very thought process of of some uh church or some denominations they they put people up on pedestals statutes they they make them higher and uh cannot attain where jesus he just said i'm the firstborn among many brethren what i am you are become you're going to become you've been predestinated to become what i am right amen the very presence of his holy word is sharper than a two-edged sword amen that's what we enter into when we come into this church hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 says for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of our soul and our spirit and of the joints and the very moral and solar bones and it is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of our heart right now i'm gonna tell you what all that make you do when you step into church you're stepping into the presence of the word and it's going to go to work look at verse 13 neither is there any neither is there any creature that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do how many has to do with god here today that's why you're here today because you have something to do with god amen now we're all wearing clothes for the obvious reasons because we want to cover ourselves rightly so but understand that god sees every single thing that we've ever done he sees where we're at he knows our thoughts he knows what we've been thinking it ain't some santa claus ain't some santa claus song he knows if you've been naughty or nice but when we come into his presence his word views us naked and open before him and we know he he knows everything about us how should that make you feel when you come and you sit in the presence of almighty god in the seats that you're sitting in this isn't some man-made religion when we talk but we give our thoughts and our opinions about who god is or what he is we're coming in in the living presence of almighty god walking into the presence of god all and make every one of us at all with god tremble at his presence just knowing we're naked just knowing he knows our thoughts he knows how upset i got yesterday he knows what i was thinking about this brother he knows because we don't want to think about something when we come to church it doesn't mean god's not thinking about it there's been many times that the word of god has discerned our thoughts and even made known the intents of our hearts yes especially when we didn't even know ourselves if you ever think about it we all think we got great intents and the god part inside of us the inner man the man that's created after his own image certainly does but unfortunately we're in this body which is not our yes our theophany our theophany body which is subject to selfishness subject to wrong intents but yet because we're a christian we think everything that we're doing is okay we come into the into the presence of the word and the word begins to speak to us and pull out things that we weren't even thinking about what is that that's not the preacher that's god that's god how many times have we experienced this did you tell the pastor that thing right i've had so many testimonies of people did you tell that's why i like knowing nothing i i love being able to say i don't know what you're talking about right but god does we don't come here to find out what you know brother john is going to discern about somebody's heart that is so ridiculous people get off on that we ought to be here in the reverence and respect the holiness of an almighty god that is concerned about your holiness according to isaiah chapter 6 when you enter the presence of the lord you're in awe that all is an overwhelming feeling of reverence fear adoration why because you're standing in the presence of the most powerful the most powerful the most powerful power that there is in existence you're standing in it it is this presence that created everything that you see everything that you've ever experienced every picture you looked at every every wild kingdom every animal everything that you wow that's amazing you're standing in the presence of that being it'll make you tremble i can't create anything i can't create anything except a bunch of confusion i can't create things up a mess but this god knows how to take our messes and he knows how to put him in order we're standing in the presence of god it ought to put such a fear in us we ought to be grabbing our seats we ought to be making sure that god am i pleasing to you amen because that's what happened isaiah standing in the presence of a god that not only knows your thoughts not only what you did but what you're going to do he knows the day you'll take your last breath amen he knows the very hour the very moment that you will breathe in on your own the last breath that you will ever breathe he knows the very moment your heart will beat the last time it will beat and you are standing in the presence of that being when you come to church yeah we just don't think about it like that we we make we have made church someplace we come to gather some information that will maybe help us in life but that's not it we're standing in the presence of god we ought to be at all it'll make us tremble brother john you're kind of getting beside yourself aren't you aren't you like pushing this preaching a little bit too far but you know you're making me feel a little uncomfortable the most powerful presence what it ought to make a person do it ought to make us feel undone unworthy unclean unable to speak a word of utterance against another person amen unable to criticize anyone why because no one can compare with the holy ghost no one can compare with almighty god this holy god that you're standing in the presence of and this god is saying vengeance is mine saith the lord i will repay this presence is saying judge not that ye be not judged for with what judgment you judge somebody i'm gonna use that same thing on you may not be the same boat that you stole or the same five dollars stored out of your brother's wallet but god will take that same judgment and judge you with the same amount of mercy the same amount of grace of course when you judge somebody did you know there is no mercy you know you came over my house you stole that tie that was wrong you're gonna pay now tell me what mercy's in there mercy is you took that tie for me that wasn't right but you know i want you to have it just don't do it no more that's mercy you don't say you didn't steal the tie you just handle it differently and when you start handling things that people deserve judgment right that's good god's going to look at you in that same way because think on the white throne judgment is there mercy on that day how the tree falls that's the way it lies today is our day he is on the throne of mercy today but one day we ought to be in awe when we come into church it all be we ought to be more serious about it not just not paying attention thinking about this thinking about what hoping you know this and no stand attention god is here he's speaking he wants to deal with us because he's calling us he's sending a call out to be holy and as we recognize him as being holy we will become holy if you will humble yourself in the presence of god he will clean you up so you can become closer to him yes he'll take a coal off the fire just like he did for isaiah and he will sanctify his life for service he'll sanctify our lives for service a more holiness come on now god is holy he's calling us to be holy the presence the very presence of god's holiness will make you more holy now the thing is in other words god did not allow isaiah to do anything that was undone anything that was filthy anything that was unclean because he was the one that confessed i am undone i'm not clean i'm not uh i i do all monks unclean i don't i i'm in a nation of uncleanness and i just stepped into a presence of holiness and god would not allow that uncleanness of that world to come into his presence so just being there in the presence of a holy god yielding his is on unworthiness to be in this presence it allowed god to take the coal off the fire touch his life and change it it became more holy and that's the way it happens but you know people can come and sit in church brother branham said they could be hearing discernment going by and the angel the pillar of fire and the angel of the lords there and they're sitting there chopping on their bubble gum joking around not recognizing the presence of god it don't have to be visible there is angels that are camp round about this place that's that fear the lord if you reverence respect the angels of god's camp around you and they're here amen we can't come into this room i'll tell you what i like to do sometime i like to come to church and everybody have blind folders on forget about looking at brother john forget about with these eyes trying to visualize because we need to close our eyes and we need to recognize that god's presence is here amen it's outside of this body called john martin amen that's why we can't look at this body it's the living word that's going forth it's what changes our life psalms 99 time is running out we're not about to get everything i want to as usual it's kind of a usual thing psalms 99 think that the situation that experience that wonderful experience that isaiah had there in chapter 6 is not isolated it's the way it needs to be here in this church but it's not something that just is physically laid out it's in the spiritual realm it wasn't it wasn't god coming down in his whole heaven coming down to a natural isaiah isaiah was lifted up and recognized something's out of place here i know this is not what i'm used to this is we have to recognize god's presence this is the part that you play you cannot depend on the music you cannot depend on the preacher you cannot depend on your feelings you need to enter into this place with a visualization with faith that you're going to meet god that god is here his presence is here and you're entering into it and it can't be any other way that's why you could you know two people could be sitting in church they walk out and one of them says oh he called me a buzzard and the other one says oh is that right well he called me an eagle same server same message what we're paying attention to what we're connected with there's so much more we could be getting out of those services if we can enter in to the spirit of christ and not depending on trying to receive from christ in the flesh verse 1 of psalms 99 the lord reigneth let the people trample not the angels not isaiah who reigns in your life who reigns in your life that means take from the state where you're at to go in the state of god he's here can you do that can you have a heart and a desire and a will and a do you are you willing to believe that god's presence is that real that it can make you trouble and i know this i've been in the presence of god where i have trembled amen and i understand i understand this you can't manufacture a thing you cannot manufacture the presence of god but we had a prophet come by and said if you meet the same requirements that somebody else said god is duty-bound to give you the same thing that he gave that person and if we humble ourselves in the sight of the lord he will lift us up but if we're already coming in his church lift it up kind of looking down we the people need to tremble the people need the tremble let the people tremble he sitteth between the cherubians let the earth be moved right well the nation that we live on they're not even thinking about a holy nation thinking about the throne of god they're not thinking about trembling in fact they'll do everything they can to deceive to cheat to to conquer to manipulate but you know god has called us to another kingdom that cannot be moved the lord is great in zion and he is high above all the people remember isaiah saw him high and lifted up let them praise thy great and terrible name for he is holy we have a responsibility when we come to church praise the name of the lord right amen the king strength also loveth judgment yes i do believe god wants me straightened up as much as i want to say oh lord look at this oh lord look at that god says no i'm not looking at that i'm looking at what i want you to do not where you're at it's where you need to get to oh we were sitting there men's man i hope this is okay brother mike was was sharing with us when he had come to church he got into when he came back to church and uh not when he came back but i think maybe maybe it was when he came back i can't remember it was the first time or when it was that you came but he came into churches kind of slum had a hoodie on just kind of you know whatever and the lord spoke to him and said i've called you to a higher standard than what you think and it got a hold of his attention and if we could realize that we don't got god all sold up that he's calling us higher and he he the bible says that the king's strength also loveth judgment thou dost establish equity equity in other words god wants to make all of us just like him amen that's what that means not what the world wants to give everybody is rob from the rich and you know pay for the poor not that type of thing not socialism god isn't into that but he wants to all of us to become like him he wants to establish that thou execute his judgment and righteousness in jacob exalt ye the lord our god and worship at his footstool for he is holy do we come into church trembling knowing this is the footstool of where god is at his presence now not this not this not this not this room but it's what's been dedicated to him he'll take what you dedicate to him amen has ever dedicated your car dedicate your house he'll take that and he'll use that he'll he'll he'll protect you in that he'll bless that why because you gave it back to him amen amen moses and aaron among his priests in samuel among that call upon his name they called upon the lord and he answered them notice what transpired in the tabernacle god his word goes forth they respond to the word and they say oh i'm a man of unclean lips lord i need you to move in the behalf of the people they interceded for the people they asked god for promises and what happened in the presence of the sanctuary god answered their prayers he spake unto them in the cloudy pillar and kept his they kept his testimonies and the ordinance that he gave them thou answered them o lord our god thou was a god that forgave us them though thou took his vengeance of their inventions yes you know every time i want to do my will it's an invention against god and he's showing that they were human we're human god deals with those but you know if we just humble ourself god will forgive us just like he forgave them exalt the lord our god and worship at his holy hill for the lord our god is holy with fear and trembling you know a lot of times we want to come in to church and we just want to feel good right we just want to just we always you know we just want to sing a song that makes us feel good and i am never ever ever i'm never against that but there needs to be some fear and trembling somewhere in the presence of god there needs to be there needs to be that respect you know god is not just someone who meets all of our needs i'm sorry he's just not that that is called an errand boy that's more of a santa claus type thinking yeah but god is our husband god is our husband you tell me one man on the planet that never ever ever wanted his wife to do anything exactly because woman was made for man we came out from god we're going back to god he is our head and he has a lot more say over us than we do him amen but the world has gotten to a place where the women were in the pants the women are calling the shots the women are an authority in our government there is a spirit that brother adam saw coming on this nation right before it was destroyed it wasn't a good spirit it was a spirit of of a woman dominating amen we as the church don't dominate god we don't tell god how things are going to be here we we're not of the church that has kicked god out we don't want god on the outside knocking to get back in we're a holy nation we recognize his presence in this place when we're driving towards church we know what we're driving towards amen we know what's going to happen when he gets there we're going to come into god's presence and we're going to shake we're going to tremble and we're going to fear before the before god because we're standing in the presence of almighty god and as we stand there what happens we become more holy because he's calling us to what he is yes he's called us to be holy how many will answer that call and say amen let's stand together he which have called you as holy so be ye holy in all manner of behavior i don't think it'd be very hard for any of us to look back and see some behavior in our life that wasn't as holy as it should have been so he's calling us from where we're at to where he wants us to go now we can have two choices we can have the choice of hey we're human and it's always going to be there or we can have the choice of he's he's called me to be more like him and that attitude will make the difference of what you will become just that attitude amen amen let's sing um we are standing on holy ground amen [Music] amen let's believe with all of our heart we are standing and i know that there are angels all around let us praise [Music] for jesus are standing in his presence on hold amen the more you believe this the more you'll feel it we are standing [Music] and i know that there are angels all around let us praise jesus for we are standing in his presence on holy ground more times we are standing [Music] and i know that there are angels all around let us pray [Music] we jesus standing in his presence on holy ground [Music] amen there's that little course we sing i see glory on every face surely the presence of the lord yes amen amen amen amen we can worship the lord praise him just and you know keep your mind on him you know what i mean just doesn't have to be loud doesn't have to be quiet what has to happen is it just you and him locked in amen surely the presence of the lord is in this place i can feel his mighty power and his grace i can hear the brush of angel's wings i see glory on each leg surely the presence of the lord is in this place oh surely the presence of the lord is in this place i can feel his mighty power [Music] [Applause] [Music] i see glory on each face surely the presence of the lord is in this play amen as she continues to play that if i could get you just to close your eyes for just a moment [Music] on that ask you you don't have to raise your hands do you know that you're standing in the presence of god [Music] he's not here because of me [Music] he's not here because we call this a church he's here because he loves you [Music] and he has set a place that you could come and know in the midst of many voices of confusion [Music] that you can hear directly from him [Music] so i ask you today do you recognize the presence of god here your feelings may not declare it but something inside of you a sense that is beyond all of our five senses should declare his presence is here surely surely surely the presence of the lord is in this place tap in tap into that presence let it become so real to you that you begin to yield to it that service has become more than just a dried-eyed place to visit a place you allow god to take your heart and put it in the palm of his hand and if he decides to squeeze it a little bit let him squeeze it he's the potter yes we're the clay when's the last time you saw the lord is the last time you cried out to him when's the last time you recognize you're standing in the presence of god a holy god that it'll move us that'll make us tremble and don't make us shake surely surely the presence of the lord is here [Music] yield your life huge your heart yielding is difficult because you've got every thought of the world coming at you you got uncomfortableness [Music] you've got your thoughts on what you're going to do what your thoughts are what you think is not right it's hard to yield but i say you need to press through every thought and yield to the holy spirit and yield to him just yield your vessel to him he wants to come in and fill you with his spirit that you might become more holy he's calling us there's got to be a deep to respond amen i'll say today just in your heart open your heart to him and just do what he tells you to do surely the presence of the lord is in this place anything is possible all things are possible because jesus is here we just have to only believe only believe god is here to do exceedingly above all that we would ask all that we would think our god is a mighty god we need to exalt his name lift his name appraise his name let his presence just feel welcomed in this place let's feel welcome in us our hearts today that's right just praise him from the dictates of your heart let him know how you feel about him what he means to

that you're yielding to the lord you're giving god the praise that he's worthy of we were created to worship him we were created to honor him to glorify him to magnify him and we weren't our first nature didn't feel that way in fact it didn't even want to think about god it just only wanted to think about what it wanted to do but god is introducing himself to us he's he's expressing uh through a human being through through the office that he has ordained [Music] to speak to his people he chose the foolishness of preaching to save men and he's chosen a five-fold ministry to bring those men to perfection and he's introducing himself to us if there's something inside of you that believes that then i encourage you to respond to the call respond to the call maybe just right there where
