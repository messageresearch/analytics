heart every morning amen amen make me a servant today to think about the creator of Heaven and Earth the creator of our souls uh who could do anything made himself a servant and then as an example was a servant for us and it to me it's an honor to serve one another yeah you may not get anything in return but that's okay you get to be Christ to somebody and and that is that is the greatest reason um to let Christ work his his life through you amen well I just want to say Happy third day after Thanksgiving and uh I believe us as Christians just got to remain thankful you know we don't get everything we want right I mean you don't got to go far in the course of the day to realize I'm not getting what I want but we can always remain thankful because there's things there's so many things that God has blessed us with and we need to continue to count our blessings amen well turn with me if you would uh in the book of First Thessalonians chapter 4. thank you it's good to see everybody in the house of the Lord amen amen I I definitely do not take our time together for granted because knowing one day um we will not be able to do this now there are times that Believers choose hey I don't feel like going to church but there's coming a day where we won't have a choice and so I think this is a great honor it's a great honor to put the flesh down to crucify it and and have our souls go to the house of the Lord and be with brothers and sisters of light precious Faith before we begin reading here in first Thessalonians chapter four let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer and just ask His blessings on this part of the service Heavenly Father Lord we love you we thank you that you you made it possible that we could be gathered together we thank you for the love and the Holy Spirit and the fire that you uh that is in each one of us that each one brought here to the service just to make this service better and we pray that you would come and consume our sacrifice Lord that you would burn it with the fire of God and may you Reveal Your word to us and may you draw us closer to you and may there be healings that take place not just in our bodies and but in our spirits and in our souls and every part of us Lord that need to be revived to be strengthened and to be helped to be encouraged father we also pray that you would direct Our Lives direct us into all truth Lord you know where we've been you know where we're at and Lord you know where you're leading us to we just pray that as a church you'd give us ears to hear what what you're speaking to us Lord father I pray that you'd close my mouth if I would go to say anything that would be of myself Lord let it not happen but I prayed Lord that you would use these lips you would use this mind you would use this heart and Lord that you would speak the Word of Life the wonderful Words of Life to each of your children here your elect your bride father we commit the service into your hands and we pray that you blessed now the reading of your word and give you the praise for it all in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen first Thessalonians chapter 4 starting with verse 13. but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the trumpet of God in the dead in Christ shall rise first then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words amen God bless you may be seated we want to entitle this message remaining in Christ and for a subject I want to have remaining alive in Christ and so we're going to talk a little bit about the difference here and I hope that you've come expecting to receive from the Lord amen and that you're you're here in the spirit because uh that's where you can really receive from God is when you are in the spirit Amen brother Branham said in the message the seed shall not be air with the shock he said not everyone is going into a Rapture but we're believing unto the coming of the Lord he says we are under great expectations for two things I listen to these two things one for the coming of the Lord and two for lost souls to come in to be ready for the coming of the Lord I mean his whole expectation is about the coming of the Lord for himself and for those that need to be in it and I'll tell you that's a good frame of mind to be in when the world's pulling on you we want to just get our Compass back towards where it needs to be amen it's hard to keep believing the scriptures as the scriptures teach us to keep that expectation in this age it's the hardest age to live in the Bible says that we're living in the greatest hour of apostasy that's been known to history iniquity in immorality are escalating in our society the world standard of right and wrong is changing at enormous speeds second Thessalonians 2 3 says let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away first and the man of sin be revealed the son of perdition when Believers began to Fall Away from walking in truth that is when sin begins to be revealed as soon as we begin to walk away from truth that's when sins become revealed now that word falling in May Falling Away means detection from the truth or not detection deflection defection from the truth apostasy forsaking or switching sides Lucifer switch sides he defected from the truth he got the Angels he got Eve to do it and he's working greatly in this age that we're living in to defect more and more people from the truth now we think well how does this have to do with us where does where do we come in what are you trying to say Brother John I'm trying to say that every demon in hell is fighting against us is trying to get us to to backslide into this lukewarmness amen and Cheryl had told me about the something she had read about the second largest denomination in the U.S they're embracing immortality in in Morality right now and because of it 20 percent of the people about 20 percent have decided to leave the church nearly 80 percent are remaining in the church now that doesn't mean that all 80 percent is lqb TQ analysis i a foreign we can distinguish between two types if of immorality one is wickedness and one is weakness remember Jesus said the fearful and the unbelieving end up in the same place so one we accept and embrace it that is wickedness we accept it we embrace it we become part of it but the other is we don't embrace the ACT but we're too weak to remove ourselves from it and a good example of that is lot right he pitched his tent toward Sodom towards the world and we learned that Sodom grew up around lot and he didn't separate from it then as it were embrace it but it was too weak and so it is a form of immorality a weakness I think believe the Bible says that his righteous Soul was vexed daily another example is Lot's wife she left finally had to leave because it was destruction and she left but in her heart she never left she left in her body but her heart didn't turned around and and so there's two ways that we could uh enter into apostasy and and the one is real deceptive you don't even know what's happening but God is calling his elect out we know the scripture come out of her my people and be not partakers of our sins and one way to look at um these people that have came out of that denomination because they were believing in something that wasn't scriptural we can look at it that it it they they came out of a man-made denomination and and and and now it's it can be a man-made non-denomination it doesn't matter if it's denomination or or non-denominational there could still be man-made but another way we can look at this is that we're coming out of man uh man's own man-made sin in his own life because we ourselves are a church and uh we have control what's in our church and uh either way we must take a stand against the immorality that's trying to come against us from the world or just you know inside of us the devil's always trying to get us to to compromise now we are promised in the last days when the gravity of sin is pulling the church down that there's a tiny little group that's going to remain faithful unto the coming of the Lord then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord I would like to take a minute and talk about the word remain Webster defines remain as staying in the same place or with the same person or the same group as a verb it means to abide dwell tarry hang around or stick around Cambridge Dictionary defines remain as to stay in the same place or in the same condition those of you that are Hunters when you go out to hunt you often face a decision am I going to stay here and be quiet believing that something's going to come or should I go to another place where I think they might be are you with me amen all right everyone who rides a bus needs to remain at the bus stop until the bus comes right so this is the way that we we look at the word remain but there's more to remaining unto the come to the Lord than just sticking around or staying in the same place look at the ten virgins ten remain unto the coming of the Lord but only five were caught up amen the five that were caught up or the five that weren't caught up they still went to church they were faithful they gave offerings they remained living a good clean life they even remained in the message but they did not remain alive they didn't take the only thing that could keep them alive and that was more Holy Ghost I like what brother Mark said today he said you want to stay on fire get more Holy Ghost that's what he said and there's a there's a truth to that because you take any oil any gas that you're trying to burn a furnace or burn a a wood fire you need to keep putting the wood to it you need to keep putting the gas to it and and you got to remember we have the Holy Ghost in portion that means we need more to keep burning five of them thought they had enough that's how Wicked that spirit is Church Believers are remaining in many things but they're not remaining alive in Christ the remaining they're keeping their confession but some have defected from even coming to church we know believers who sat with us that are not coming to church what is happening right we that are here are told to admonish those that are not to be here and all the more as we see the day approaching that's what God wants us to do to them now will they come I don't know some will some won't but we got a job to do amen amen amen some Believers are remaining a church but they have defected from humbly preparing their hearts some remain listening to The Taste but they defect it from pressing into living with a tape of saying so you're alive in Christ when you move forward in him that's what it means to remain alive in Christ is to remove to go forward what he's speaking to you amen five virgins kept moving forward in the Holy Ghost the other five did not they did not get on uh to getting all that they needed to to be accepted as God's bride because see God is the one that does the choosing and we know Satan is very good at telling people who don't have the Holy Ghost that they got it and he even tells people who got the holy ghost that they don't got it so he tells the people who's not elect that they're elected and tells the people who are elected they're not elect he is the god of confusion is true we don't want to be relying solely on the doctrine of predestination or just relying on that that God's love is not going to separate me and him I don't know how those foolish virgins were but they felt they had enough they felt all they had to do was remain unto the coming of the Lord right are you with me living the life that they were living but when it came time for the catching of the way catching away they weren't called they weren't called up or they weren't chosen however you want to say it because look I I think when the day comes when when the Rapture happens everybody's not going to know about it ain't like everybody's going to be called at that moment it's only those who are ready right the calling is now amen the calling is now the Rapture is the the actual proof that you were chosen now's the time that we believe that we're chosen but we that are chosen we follow what the word says that's how we know we're chosen the brand gave us some good advice about the Holy Ghost he says when you come up to the Altar and you're seeking the Holy Ghost and you think you got it he says you stay there and you keep praying for more and you just stay there longer until you get more he says and then after you get that you stay there more he was sending us a message Saints because Satan is always I mean just think about this when you get down to pray you're not even seeking the Holy Ghost but you're just getting down to pray to say your prayers or whatever you're getting down there to pray for and it isn't long before you hear Satan come by and say you prayed enough it's true it's time to get up and go on with the day but the holy spirit is the one that's telling us to wait upon him to wait on the Lord that's where the strength comes the longer you wait the more strength you get amen amen we can't stop moving forward we can't sit idle we can't remain alive in Christ without moving forward and manifesting Christ without manifesting the word that he's given us I think one of the biggest tricks the devil polls on Believers is that no matter what their choices are they're still remaining with God this is a it's a terrible trick we've seen too many people defect switch sides who who we believe we're solid enough that we're going to stay in the message they were going to stay in church and then they're gone that's scary so don't rely on a false sense of security Jesus warned us about remaining in the Vine that a branch can can be connected to the vine and yet it have no life in it brother Mark and I were talking about I believe it was brother Mark talking about trees with dead limbs in them they're still in the tree but there's no life in it and and Jesus talked about those uh branches that that weren't bearing fruit that he would actually prune it off the vine he'd get rid of it so you can be connected as it were in one way to Christ but not bearing fruit and it's a trick Jesus said without me you can do nothing without me you can't bear fruit except you abide in the Vine the moment that you're not abiding The Life of Christ is the moment that your spiritual life will begin to wither that the fruit of joy and peace and love for one another come on we're living in an age where iniquity is abounding the love of many is waxing cold everything's becoming selfish and unthankful every branch in me that beareth not fruit he said is taken away so we can be in Christ and not bear fruit it's a very very tricky so we don't want to just remain in Christ we want to remain alive at a place where we're bearing fruit and how do we know that we've got to allow the Holy Ghost to speak to us and I know it it seems a little bit discouraging uh when we hear that uh we didn't hit the mark that we're not perfect that we're we we're we're not where we need to be I understand that's discouraging but that's the job of the Holy Ghost he has many things to say unto us we got to let him speak amen now that's not John Martin speaking all right I'm sorry John Martin has nothing to do with what God's doing in your life he can use anybody he can use a donkey to speak to us look at the children of Israel they all came out of Egypt they all drank from The Rock they all ate Manna From Heaven they all had testimonies they all remained with the prophet the message of the hour but they stopped moving forward what the prophet spoke amen they all remain followers of the pillar of Fire the cloud by day but they stop moving further in truth God kept telling them to move forward in faith but they didn't want to complaining was their go-to character that was their default character we can't remain alive without moving forward in Christ he doesn't sit still he's still working on getting the last seed in too many people say that they're being led by God but they aren't willing to walk in the light that God gave them God is here to lead and guide us into all truth and I want that I want that for my life remember this statement there's no remaining in Christ without moving forward there's no remaining in Christ without moving forward the only way to not go backwards as a Christian is to keep moving forward see Satan wants us to think you know as long as we're doing this as long as we're doing that we're okay that is such a lie God is on a mission to see the the fullness of his the the fullness of the the statue of a perfect man inside every one of us that's where he's at that's what he's he's trying to get us to do to see that so when you get on fire for God don't allow the devil to tempt you to a bed of ease to take it easy I'll just say keep the pedal to the metal and keep going forward don't let up don't turn around don't take a minute I'll tell you I hate that phone what a distraction this is on sale Black Friday Cyber Monday Saturday 20 off more than it was Black Friday something to get our attention why did brother Brandon say you'll never leave the church the same way you came in he said well either get closer to God or further away from him and sometimes we think we're feeling the way we're feeling because of the preacher or the song leader or somebody in the church did something wrong we'll either accept the truth of where we're at of where we're at what the Holy Ghost has said to us what he wants us to do or will reject it truth amen amen and that's what determines whether we're closer or further away not about how we feel we can feel close sometimes we wake up feeling like a nut and sometimes we don't million bucks a million in a hole in debt the only way not to go backwards is to keep moving forward that's all there is to it the spirit of this age is lukewarm right it's not denying the truth Christ the word or the message of the hour it's compromising it's compromising in what God's given right right that's the apostasy and that's why it's so hard for people to see it because they say I believe I believe I believe but they're compromising with something in their lives and they're falling in that same apostasy right that's true they're neither cold or hot they're not ice cold they're not in total denial of God but they're neither walking in the spirit right hunting for God's right they're not ice cold and denying the Bible is God's word or God sent a prophet or but the message of the hour but yet they're confessing Believers are not willing to tally up with what he said what the Bible says they can hear the word preached and they won't change they won't do nothing and I'll tell you one of the greatest things that we can have sitting in the church is a heart that's pricked by the Holy Ghost a conscience that says oh God I want to please you more give me that over every perfect Sherman that makes me feel good because that will never get me where I need to go neither cold or hot not completely dead to God but not alive walking in the spirit either here is God's message to the lukewarm believer I would thou work cold or hot how would you just choose a side because when we're in a in the middle to where we don't choose a side we become a stumbling block to everybody that looks at our life I could see why God's saying that he finally told Lucifer hey if you do not want to be what I have created you to be to do the job that you were doing for I don't know how many thousands of years then you get out choose the side don't sit here and try to act this way in front of me go behind my back and talk to the other angels try to deceive them so then because Thou Art lukewarm neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because a Believer chooses to be lukewarm God chooses not to have them as bride he gets rid of them see we make the first choice it's okay whatever condition we're in is always okay what's the most important thing is when God speaks you say yes Lord and if he says get hot get cold I'm telling you think about it if you just turn cold from hot he'd be happier because lukewarm you've already made your decision and you don't know it that's why and and I'm speaking I believe from the holy spirit that it is not in none of our hearts to be legal lukewarm to be in a state of uncaring or departing from God but I'm speaking to the spirits that deceive us in making us think that we're okay in compromising you just can't keep pointing God will never leave us nor forsake us when we're the one leaving him just can't say Amen about being pre-decied to leave in a Rapture when we're not even preparing to leave in a rapture we're we're preparing to stay yeah we're saying amen we're going into rapture each time Jesus said he that have an ear let him hear what this spirit is saying to the church he was expecting them to turn around from their situation and start walking in truth every time he said it when the Church of Ephesus left their first love Revelations 2 5 he says remember therefore for once Thou Art Fallen and repent and do the first works or else I will come unto thee quickly and remove thy Candlestick out of his place except thou repent he's talking to the church he ain't talking to the world he's talking to a group of people who who love God first in their life at one time and then begin to defect switch sides to compromise and didn't realize it but he's letting him know return when the church and pergamists began to compromise and tolerate the wrong spirits in verse 16 he said repent or else I will come quickly and will fight against them with the sword of my mouth so he was wanting the church to turn around from their condition that's what the spirit is saying to the church and so that's what brother Branham was meeting him as we come to find out where we're at with God and when we find out wherever God is just an easy we just turn Friday isn't our whole life is bad it's just something he's dealing with me wants to say to work on that praise the Lord do you know what Jesus told the church to program us he said I have a few things against thee you know he told the Church of thyatira notwithstanding I have a few things against thee tolerating a compromising Doctrine mm-hmm it only takes a little compromising in our lives that God is against us even though we're his child even though we're his bride we can't do that see we're in the place of our building our territory because brother Ryan said that's the only thing we're taking with us so we come to church and we hear a strong word we hear things being spoken what's happening is it takes that strong word to build character because we have got to say I'm not going to do this in the middle of our trial that's where character is built instead of allowing the enemy to to to trick us a little 11 11th the whole lump remember apostasy isn't just leaving God but it's embracing sins embracing unbelief we can tolerate sometimes a compromising spirit true that it's okay in our lives now I'm speaking it's easy to to look at anybody and say this is your problem this is your problem this is what you need to fix you're compromising I'm not talking about that I'm not talking about us being judges of others I'm talking about us humbly judging ourselves that's something there's places that this the devil is trying to get us to compromise and that's just as much as just outright leaving God it's the beginning of leaving God right it's the same thing he says Jesus said you've heard whosoever uh committeth adultery is it should be stoned by saying to you that whosoever looketh upon a woman to lust effort is already committed adultery in his heart so he's taken this to the root of where it starts an apostasy starts with compromising an Open Door that he can get in and get you to become laxed lukewarm not hot not cold are you with me do you love me I love you amen amen all right we're just trying to get the devil out when God is dealing with someone something in their lives I say we don't want to take it lightly that's the Holy Spirit leading us into all truth and so the only way to move forward in Christ is is is not to stand still not to if you if you stand still you're going backwards because you you don't there is no standing still in Christ if I could say it like this you're you're either moving forward or going backwards you never remain the same when you come to church if you don't move forward by default you will begin to go backwards turn with me if you would to first Thessalonians chapter 2 the only way to remain alive unto the coming of the Lord is to remain moving forward with God I'll say Amen to that because if if somebody don't say Amen I'm going to read it again all right I just kind of want to bring everything I said now that I just said through the scriptures first Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 19 and 20. for what is Our Hope or Joy or a crown or rejoicing are not even you in the presence of the Lord Jesus Christ at his coming for ye are our glory and our joy so now this this whole thing is talking about the coming of the Lord and he's talking about you you that that your change life your change nature you you turning around and saying I accept Christ as my savior yes that is our joy that is our whole that is our crown or rejoicing of rejoicing he says first chapter 3 verse 1 wherefore when ye would no longer forbear we thought it good to be left at Athens alone and sent to malthius our brother and minister of God and our fellow labor in the gospel of Christ to want to establish you now they're already saved and to comfort you concerning your faith that no man should move be moved by these afflictions for yourselves know that we are appointed there and two so just catching this that these men are saved there are we read in in chapter four they're going to be raptured they that are alive they're remaining unto the coming of the lord they're part of the elect group but I want you to see what Paul is TR is is having them do until it happens are you with me verse 4 or verse verse oh yeah okay verily when we were with you we told you before that we would should suffer tribulation yes we all do even as it came to pass and you know for this cause when I could no longer forbear I sent to you to know your faith lest by some means the tempter have tempted you and our labor be in vain but now when timothius came from you unto us and brought us Good Tidings of your faith and charity that ye have uh good remembrance of us always Desiring greatly to see you as we also to see you therefore brethren we were comforted over you in all our afflictions and distresses by your faith you wanna Comfort somebody believe believe for them in all their distresses whatever is going on their afflictions believe for them that's a comfort to them for now we live if we stand fast in the Lord so here's our looks to me like a warning that there's there's no uh a once saved always saved do whatever you want for now we live talking about being alive and remain to the coming Lord if ye Stand Fast in the Lord for what things can we render to God again for you for all the joy we're with we joy for your sake before God before our God night and day praying extinctly that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith Viking well I I thought I'm gonna be saved I'm going in a Rapture and why do I have to be concerned about what's lacking I why I Think Jesus said to the church there's a few things that have against me there's a few things what do you tell the the Rich Young Ruler that that kept all the Commandments one thing they'll like us God is interested in the things that we don't think about that's where he's at that's why when we hear the word and it seems like brother John that doesn't help me that doesn't come for me well I'll tell you it didn't help the Rich Young Ruler either he walked away sorrowful right but we got to deal with it because he's bringing us to perfection and and Paul is speaking here that uh he's praying exceedingly that we that that we might see your face and might perfect that which is lacking in your faith no God himself and our father and our Lord Jesus Christ direct our way unto you and the Lord make you to increase and to Bound in love one towards another and towards all men even is we do towards you what what I gotta increase more aren't you satisfied I gotta bow more love what's wrong with my love ain't it good enough and I got to do it towards all men that means my enemies right oh what what is this gospel saying I thought I'm just we which are alive and remain are going God is calling us to a place he's calling us higher than where we're at verse 13 to the end he may establish your hearts unbelievable in Holiness before God even our father at the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ with all his Saints see this whole thing is pointing us to them which are alive and remain unto the coming Lord shall be caught up but we have a job to do till then and that means when we can look at ourselves and say you know what I'm not there I had a thought I shouldn't had and I dwelt on that too long in fact I carried that the next day when the love of God thinketh no evil when I had these little things start coming out of my mouth when the person wasn't there that I said about I mean come on we think everybody does it and it's okay it ain't okay right it ain't okay because if somebody as soon as somebody hears about it it's going to put a a it's gonna God is calling us to be alive not to keep our heart beaten right not to be on some life support he's wanting the spirit to be alive inside of us to be dealing with things to know to learn how to deal with life because if we don't that Devil's going to get so many people to compromise and Fall Away furthermore oh am I verse chapter 4. furthermore then when we beseech you Brethren exhort you that by our Lord Jesus Christ that as ye have received of us how ye ought to walk and to please God so ye would abound more and more so they went to church and they hear they had to do it more and more too foreign I thought you know Paul had been handing out the compliments that day he says no I want you to I want you to Bow more in walking more pleasing to God for ye know what Commandments we gave you by our lord Jesus for this is the will of God even your sanctification that you should abstain from fornication that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel and sanctification and honor not the lust of uh a longing desire even as the Gentiles which know not God that no man go beyond and defraud his his own brother you know we have a tendency of just overreaching instead of just praying with them in any manner in any manner because that the Lord is the Avenger of all such as we also have forewarned and test and forewarned you and testified for God have not called us unto uncleanness but unto Holiness there's many ways that we can be unclean you know just unclean things can come out of our mouth and I'm not just talking foul language I'm saying little things that we just try to give a dig a little dig I'm going to send this message that's unclean is that right and he's called us to go beyond that he therefore that despiseth despiseth not man but God he's actually doing it to God he don't know it because he's not walking in the spirit right who have also given us his holy spirit think about that God has given us his Spirit but we're not yielding to it amen amen but his touching brotherly love you need not that I write unto you for yourselves are taught of God to love one another and indeed you do it to all Brethren which are in Macedonia oh praise God let's put a period on that and go home that's not what Paul did did he he says but we beseech you Brethren that you increase more and more what a message the holy spirit is getting across to the church to stay alive in other words to remain growing to remain abounding more and more in the love of God in other words when you come to church next month there should be more love in your heart seen by everybody there should be less isms less schisms less talking about other people behind people's back there needs to be a growing in Christ somebody's got to believe this word don't stand around waiting for the whole church to become what you think it needs to be you become what the word says you may be the only one brother bear said they're only one in that City you make sure you're that one it's got to be real to us verse 11 and that ye study to be quiet there's a message in that line I'll tell you and to do your own business don't be a busybody and to work with your own hands as we commanded you and that that ye may walk honestly toward them that are without and that ye may have lack of nothing you serve a God who supplyeth all of your needs he's not a God that's sometimes hits it and sometimes don't if anything is lacking in my life it's because of me it's not because of God he is faithful to his word but I would not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them which are asleep that ye sorrow not even as others which have no hope for if we believe that Jesus died and rose again even so them which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him but we know in that statement not that everybody died is bride right there was bride in every age but only the elect only the bride is going to rule and Reign a thousand years right sit with him on the throne for this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive amen I like that quickened and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout that's the message of the hour the voice of the Archangel that's Christ and the trumpet of God shall uh the trumpet of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first there's a an announcement to the marriage supper amen then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore Comfort one another with these words there this is should be this is what we should be under expectation we should be right with the prophet amen amen if we were in the prophets uh meeting and he spoke these words I feel that that is where the church should be under expectation of the coming of the Lord because it is so easy to get to drift back in in a uh laodicea spirit where you're just kind of in your own life doing your own thing going your own places and we really need to share that burden of of getting Souls into Christ while we have an opportunity what an embarrassing thing it's going to be to stand before the Lord and know that we wasted our time come on I don't say that because I'm against you I say that because I'm your brother this is where I need to be this is where we need to be amen the only way to remain unto the coming of the Lord is to remain alive in his word to keep moving forward with Christ to keep growing higher and higher in increasing more and more and abounding in his love more and more in loving more and be able to look back from last month last week however you wanted to say it and you see that there's a spiritual growth taking place in your life not of knowledge not had learned more but I'm living it more I'm living it more it's just happening I'm giving my life away that's what needs to transpire that's how you know you're alive and if you're in that state when he when he comes I'm telling you you're going to go up praise the Lord don't stay idle don't focus on what you've done what you've achieved I like that brother Brandon's laying in his bath his hands folded behind his bounties thing if I'm going to do anything for the Lord I better do it quick he wasn't staring at the hundreds or or millions of people that he is saved he was looking forward he was looking at what he had with his life and he think we need to forget the victories which are behind us now and press towards press towards for more this is God's message to the church he that have ears to hear Let Him hear what the spirit is saying after Paul told the Philippian Church First Corinthians 1 6. you don't turn there but you've heard it being confident of this very thing that he which had begun a good work in you will perform until the day of Jesus Christ we all love that scripture but look what happens three verses later he says in this I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge and in all judgment I'll tell you if there's something missing in our judgment is love too often we judge Without Love and that's it's just totally unrighteous that ye may approve things which are excellent and that you may be sincere without offense without offense sincere and without offense to the day of Christ that that's a that's a that's a lot to live come on being filled with the fruits of the spirit which are by Jesus Christ unto the glory and praise of our God I believe to remain in Christ we need to grow more and more abound more and more and just keep his love growing amen Jesus told us to abide or to remain in his love and you can read about it and uh John 15 when you get time but in this age the love of many is waxing cold we think that it don't affect us but the spirit you know we may have came out of laodicea but I'm telling you that spirit is all around us sometimes we bring it into the church right right sometimes we can't even enter his Gates properly come on Jesus said he that abideth in me and I and him the same bringeth forth much fruit Karen is my father glorify that ye bear much fruit so shall he be my disciples and in verse 16 he says you have not chosen me but I have chosen you and ordained you that you should go forth and bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain now you know what happens when you take an apple or pear or peach or a banana and you let it remain on the counter too long you don't want it that's not the remaining that Jesus is looking for he wants us to keep bearing the fruit amen fresh fruit that whatsoever you asking the father in my father's name he will give it to you these things I command you that you love one and I believe that fruit has to do with his love I believe that walking forward in the love of God in the hardest age requires a continuous dine out to the flesh don't try walking a Christian walk without denying yourself you'll never be successful our flesh will always Savor us or entertain the things that belong to our first nature it's never changing it's never changing we're changing but the flesh never changes the mind of the flesh will always exercise the things that belong to our first nature that's why it has to be crucified you can't give an inch it'll take a mile you take a moment say I just want to look at that just one that before you know it you're looking at it longer that's just the way the flesh is it's not you it's the flesh if we don't keep dying out to the flesh how can we give God Liberty to use us for his kingdom amen amen how can we remain alive unto the coming of the Lord look at Balaam he never thought he left God no sir I'll only say what God tells me to say you can't curse something that God has blessed speaking the word he never thought he left God he never thought he was going into apostasy defecting switching sides but he got too weak and what did he do he began to compromise which is the other form of apostasy he was unwilling to keep his flesh crucified and if you don't keep your flesh crucified you will backslide and that's exactly what he did and he was a prophet of God he was much higher than me and if he could backslide where does that put me are you with me this is a this is a real a real thing to be alive is alive too often we use God and the Liberty he's given us for ourself and that's not what he gave it for for our desires and our flesh Galatians 5 13 and I'm trying to hurry so the more that you get into this word the more I'll hurry for Brethren you have been called unto Liberty only used not Liberty for occasion of the flesh well what am I supposed to do with it then serve me serve one another what are you doing with your Liberty who are you serving Oh Brother John you know I I just I'm so bad I got I don't know but hey don't defect from this truth stay with the word get back to it turn around and get back to it you think it's not that big a thing but that's because you've been so far away from the Lord you don't hear his voice you don't you don't catch it when he's speaking to you for all the law is fulfilled in one word even this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself man let's start practicing that around here let's start practicing it give a little bit more than you want to give say something nicer than you usually want to say Don't just walk out so much into yourself that you don't care about others that ain't Christ he says but if ye bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another great man this I say then walk in the spirit and it'll take care of everything and you shall not fulfill that lust of dividing and devouring one another for the flesh lusteth that the spirit and the spirit after the Flesh and these are contrary once in the so that you cannot do the things that you would we must stay in sync with the Holy Ghost in order to successfully walk in harmony with the Holy Ghost we must learn to separate the two spirits that are in us let's just get real there's two of them in US there's two Natures that are constantly at bat with one another and if we don't learn to call them out if we never learn them we're always thinking we're just doing the right thing every man's right in his own eyes we must recognize the two Spirits constantly and if we fail to do that we'll be blinded by the wrong spirit and begin we won't we won't have a problem saying these things it won't even bother us get to a point what was true is right they deserve it and don't even feel the conviction that's why we gotta understand what's happening if we don't continue to crucify our flesh we'll end up walking in it will become judgmental lawyers judges sentencing our own brothers and sisters to hurt becoming spiritual cannibals biting and devouring not even recognizing what's going on blinded by our pride we need to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God serve one another remain crucify your flesh that's how you remain alive in Christ Romans 8 chapter or chapter Romans 8 verse 10 I'm trying to hurry see my wife back there that means that's like hanging up a big sign services needs to be ending not really he wouldn't do that to me listen until I get to the restaurant all right and if Christ being you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken make alive your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you and this is why you you hear the word of God and it's being preached and you think it doesn't mean very much because it's kind of minor compared to your relationship with Christ it's not that way because that word is Christ and when you you make light of this particular message that God's trying to get across you you're making light of your relationship with God so when you receive the word that Holy Spirit the life of that word now becomes manifested inside of you it is simply a saint Lord I believe that word I believe that you speaking that's you speaking to me now the spirit will Quicken you don't wait for the quickening before you start saying I'm a Believer believe the word as it's preached and it will be quickened to you therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh ye shall die there it is but if he through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live see it's a continual process until the coming of the Lord for as many as beloved of the spirit of God they are the sons of God remain walking in the Holy Spirit amen and you will be alive unto the coming of the Lord walk humbly keep a abounding in his love more increase daily keep moving forward not knowledge not just popping on a tape but to where just one word God spoke to you and you're you're starting to follow it that's where life comes from and this this may seem strong to some and I don't mean to make as songs sound strong or be strong to you but this let me just tell you where this burden is at there are so many people that are falling away some we see and some don't even realize what's happening and I know there's a lot of terrible things in the world but I'm concerned about our souls I'm concerned about those that are are are going backwards instead of forwards I mean I think we should be hearing more testimonies I believe the love of God has shed abroad My Heart by the Holy Ghost and I'm loving more than I ever have in my life I think we need to hear testimonies like that that by nature is changing I'm able to handle situations without blowing up without creating another problem I mean God is still alive and he needs to be alive in us and this is a beautiful opportunity for us to take God's word amen and grow last scripture First Corinthians 15 verse 58. therefore my beloved brethren be he steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord Mission work is always in the will of God amen amen amen maybe my wife could come or try to sing a little song here how many wants to remain alive until the coming of the Lord yeah
