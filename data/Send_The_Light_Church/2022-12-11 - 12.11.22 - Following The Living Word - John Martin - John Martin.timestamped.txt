[41:35] Savannahs and tamalthius unto the Church
[41:38] of Thessalonians which is in God the

[41:48] Father and the Lord Jesus Christ we give
[41:51] thanks to God always for you all making
[41:55] mention of you in in our prayers
[41:57] remembering without ceasing your work of
[42:00] faith and labor of love and patience of
[42:04] Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the
[42:06] sight of God and our father knowing
[42:10] brother and beloved your election of God
[42:13] for our gospel came not unto you in word
[42:15] only but also in power and in the Holy
[42:18] Ghost and in much Assurance as ye know
[42:21] what manner of men we were among you for
[42:25] your sakes
[42:26] and you became followers of us
[42:29] and of the Lord having received the word
[42:33] in much Affliction with joy of the Holy
[42:37] Ghost so that you were examples to all
[42:42] that believed in Macedonian uh uh Akai
[42:47] for from you sounded out the word of the
[42:52] Lord not only in Macedonia in the K.I
[42:55] but also in every place your faith to
[43:00] God's word is spread abroad so that we
[43:02] need not to speak anything
[43:05] in other words
[43:07] their life
[43:08] did the job amen
[43:11] for they themselves show of us what
[43:14] manner of entering in we had unto you
[43:17] and how ye turned to God from Idols to
[43:21] serve the living and true God Amen God
[43:26] bless you may be seated
[43:29] thank you
[43:33] we got a text from a brother in in India
[43:37] somehow he got a hold of the live stream
[43:39] and he's been
[43:41] uh watching it for a couple months her
[43:44] brother a believer in India
[43:47] is in the message
[43:48] uh
[43:49] and
[43:51] let's just pray
[43:53] that God would bless him with Souls amen
[43:56] amen amen
[44:00] um how many times have you tried to
[44:03] speak to someone and share more truth
[44:06] with somebody only to have spoken back
[44:10] to you that thank you but we're
[44:13] following we're following the Lord
[44:16] we're good enough we're we're we're okay
[44:19] we don't need what you have to to give
[44:23] us and that could be as simple as just
[44:24] an invitation to come to church maybe
[44:27] they they know the truth maybe they
[44:29] don't but they they've made a decision
[44:31] that they they don't want to walk in it
[44:34] but but yet they're still Believers
[44:37] they've been going to church some maybe
[44:39] 20 something years
[44:41] and they they believe that they're uh
[44:45] following the Lord
[44:47] but
[44:49] I believe there's a lot of people out
[44:51] there who are
[44:54] are deceived by the enemy thinking that
[44:58] they're following God when they're
[45:01] really not
[45:04] Paul said in First Corinthians 11 verse
[45:07] 1 be ye followers of me even as I also
[45:12] am of Christ
[45:15] so when you're following a man that's
[45:17] following Christ with the living word I
[45:19] say follow him
[45:22] but when you're following a man just
[45:24] with a dead letter
[45:26] do not follow him
[45:29] because they're not following Christ
[45:31] is alive
[45:34] Christ is is noted as the I am God not
[45:37] the I was
[45:42] amen we never want to follow someone
[45:44] who's just following a dead letter
[45:47] no matter how much they say they believe
[45:49] the word has to be alive in that person
[45:51] or do not have confidence and follow
[45:54] them
[45:55] what happened to the churches who just
[45:58] took a a part of truth but refused to
[46:00] walk forward in more truth brother
[46:03] Branham taught us that they died right
[46:06] there
[46:07] they built a denomination around a
[46:11] partial truth a man-made religion from
[46:14] truth they took a revelation given to a
[46:18] man
[46:20] and built their belief system around it
[46:23] notice
[46:24] they themselves didn't get the
[46:26] revelation
[46:28] it was somebody else's revelation
[46:30] [Music]
[46:31] because God's revelation is never going
[46:33] to tell you sit still
[46:36] right it's going to tell you it's
[46:37] perpetual it's going to tell you to keep
[46:39] moving this is part now there's more for
[46:41] you
[46:44] so that's why you never want to follow a
[46:47] man with a dead letter
[46:48] but just a part of the truth right
[46:53] there are a lot of Believers following a
[46:55] man in this message
[46:59] they haven't moved forward in the Living
[47:01] Word
[47:02] and there's a difference between people
[47:03] being in the message and the message
[47:05] really being inside of them
[47:09] I believe that this message is alive
[47:13] they're like the true message is alive
[47:17] the false message is a dead letter right
[47:22] right that is followed by more than what
[47:24] we realize
[47:26] you would think there's some sort of
[47:28] security because somebody
[47:30] feels comfortable when somebody says oh
[47:34] yes I'm in the message oh like there's
[47:36] some some fellowship that we could have
[47:38] they they believe like we believe but
[47:40] the fact of the matter is they don't
[47:43] many of them don't
[47:46] so you can't find security by just being
[47:48] in the message it could be a dead letter
[47:50] everybody views it different
[47:53] many Believers are rallying behind the
[47:57] truth of the message but what's
[47:58] important is to live that message out to
[48:01] have it living inside of it to be made
[48:02] flesh again
[48:04] and so many people have lost visions of
[48:06] it it's not it's not about knowing it
[48:08] it's about living it
[48:11] because that's what he's coming back for
[48:13] he's not coming back for the the tree of
[48:15] knowledge of Good and Evil
[48:18] he's coming back for the Tree of Life
[48:21] amen
[48:22] so just because we're in the message it
[48:24] doesn't mean that we're automatically
[48:26] following the Living Word
[48:28] because I just want to focus on the word
[48:31] being alive let's take a look at the
[48:33] children of Israel The Living Word came
[48:36] down in the mouth of a prophet
[48:39] Moses and he led them out
[48:41] of the bondage that they were in
[48:44] and just look they left the World Behind
[48:46] they watched God divide the Red Sea
[48:50] and saw their enemy destroyed right God
[48:53] took care of them they ate the living
[48:55] manner the fresh man of the the it
[48:58] didn't last two days right
[49:01] The Living Word LED them by a cloud of
[49:04] in the day and and a pillar Fire by
[49:07] night
[49:09] they witness the rock of Christ that
[49:12] follow them they drank from that rock
[49:15] their shoes never retired I just bought
[49:18] another pair of shoes
[49:20] their shoes never retired
[49:23] they had endless health insurance
[49:27] their needs were met
[49:29] God was faithful to them
[49:32] but what happened
[49:34] The Living Word was leading them into
[49:36] all truth to the promised land but they
[49:39] made a choice that they didn't want to
[49:40] go
[49:43] so they were in the message
[49:46] partial
[49:49] but they weren't in all the way
[49:51] they built a denomination around what
[49:54] had happened and failed to continue to
[49:58] walk further on
[50:00] like a lot of people today
[50:02] they don't want to fall the harder way
[50:04] don't do anything you know because it
[50:07] was too hard to face their enemy and our
[50:10] enemy is our ugly nature that we wake up
[50:13] with every day that we don't want to
[50:15] deal with
[50:17] amen yet they still felt they were
[50:20] following God because of this or that
[50:25] the Pharisee said we have Abraham as our
[50:27] father
[50:29] Jesus said If Abraham was your father
[50:31] you would follow me
[50:34] The Living Word
[50:37] he said well we follow the law of Moses
[50:40] he says if you followed Moses
[50:43] will you follow me because Moses wrote
[50:45] Of Me
[50:49] they never recognized the Living Word
[50:52] and if you don't recognize the word
[50:54] living how are you going to follow it
[50:58] people have gotten so custom to just
[51:00] think well as long as I'm doing this I'm
[51:02] following God that that is not right
[51:06] I got a question for you has the word
[51:08] become alive in you
[51:11] [Music]
[51:14] have you recognized him leading you to
[51:17] himself
[51:19] minutes
[51:21] to himself
[51:24] are you truly following the Living Word
[51:28] brother sister I'm not interested in God
[51:30] making my life easier down here
[51:33] I'm interested in doing what he's
[51:36] interested in me doing that's what I'm
[51:39] interested in
[51:42] I'm interested in Souls I'm interested
[51:44] in getting his family together and and
[51:48] and God help me to help somebody get
[51:50] ready for his coming
[51:55] don't fail to follow the Living Word
[51:58] it will always lead you to himself
[52:03] the word that's important to us we're
[52:05] going to get into some personal stuff
[52:07] here in just a little bit but John I
[52:09] want to lay a foundation here John 16 13
[52:11] you've heard me often quote this when he
[52:14] the spirit of Truth has come he will
[52:15] guide you into all Truth for he shall
[52:17] not speak of himself
[52:20] it's not about you it's not about your
[52:22] flesh
[52:23] it's not about your life
[52:28] it's about God leading you to into all
[52:31] truth
[52:32] amen when I was born I was born into all
[52:35] sin
[52:37] and when I get born again I'm born into
[52:39] all truth and that Spirit does not stop
[52:42] leading us into all of it
[52:45] because I honestly I couldn't bear it if
[52:47] he just dumped it all on me the day I
[52:49] got baptized
[52:51] I'd say I'm out of here in fact I
[52:53] remember times in my life feeling too
[52:56] much pressure from someone telling me
[52:58] the word
[53:00] like I you know I don't know if I could
[53:02] take this this doesn't seem right I
[53:04] thought it was all supposed to be nice
[53:06] and easy
[53:10] for he shall not speak of himself
[53:14] that Spirit doesn't it's not about you
[53:18] it's about all truth amen that's where
[53:21] God is interested
[53:22] we want the Holy Ghost we want to feel
[53:24] good we want to speak in tongues we want
[53:25] to we want to dance we want to do this
[53:27] we want to sing We want to shout we want
[53:28] to do all this but he wants all truth to
[53:31] be inside of us
[53:33] all truth is all of Christ in you the
[53:38] hope of glory
[53:40] all truth is when all things are of God
[53:43] you've been reconciled unto him he's
[53:46] given you a Ministry of reconciliation
[53:48] the Bible says therefore If any man be
[53:50] in Christ he's a new creature old things
[53:53] are passed away and behold all things
[53:56] are become new who's interested in
[53:59] things in your life right now that you
[54:01] want to get rid of
[54:03] well that was awful quiet did I say that
[54:06] wrong who has things in your life that
[54:08] you're interested in getting rid of or
[54:10] do you want to keep the old things
[54:12] I mean we all got old things in our life
[54:14] that we want gone right we're just sick
[54:16] of them we're tired of them tired of
[54:19] dealing with them that that old nature
[54:20] that pops out that just you know get
[54:22] you're impatient you're you you just get
[54:25] rubbed the wrong way somebody looks at
[54:27] you just not right you just get bothered
[54:29] that ain't him that ain't Christ that's
[54:32] the old things
[54:35] should be a longing and a heart to get
[54:37] rid of that
[54:40] no our flesh is always interested in God
[54:44] leading Us in this life
[54:49] we want God to lead us in this life
[54:53] we want God to show us what to do in
[54:55] this life
[54:57] we want God to help us with this life
[55:00] we want God to meet our needs in this
[55:02] life we want God to make this life
[55:04] better this life easier
[55:08] we want God to show us how this life can
[55:11] be prosperous to us
[55:13] how things could be better for us in
[55:16] this life
[55:18] that's what we want to talk about the
[55:20] leadership of God that's what we want
[55:22] the Holy Ghost to show us
[55:25] and you know what
[55:27] that's just our flesh
[55:30] that's just our flash friends
[55:34] that is not what God promised he'd do
[55:37] when he sent the Holy Ghost
[55:39] that's what we want him to do
[55:42] and I'm not against that
[55:45] because we need God for all of our lives
[55:48] but I'm telling you if our focus is on
[55:51] that it is not focused the right way
[55:55] because when the Living Word comes he
[55:58] will speak seek ye first the kingdom of
[56:01] God is righteousness and all other
[56:03] things shall be added see that's not
[56:05] about this life
[56:07] but there's so much about oh you know
[56:10] God showed me this God show me that he
[56:11] wants me
[56:13] oh
[56:18] where is the hunger for God to show them
[56:20] how to denounce their own nature and
[56:23] have the nature of Christ where is that
[56:26] where is that hunger
[56:28] we come to church and we struggle with
[56:31] hearing the truth
[56:36] the children of Israel did the same
[56:38] thing for 40 years
[56:41] came to church
[56:43] heard Moses
[56:45] there was a promised land they wanted
[56:47] anything but to die out to get the Holy
[56:50] Ghost
[56:53] right they didn't want to face their
[56:55] real enemy
[56:56] and our real enemies ourself
[56:59] but the prophet said
[57:03] when the spirit of truth comes he will
[57:06] guide you into all truth
[57:09] all truth is Christ inside of you
[57:13] I'm talking about
[57:16] your whole Nature has become him
[57:20] I believe the Bible says I will not
[57:22] awake I will not be satisfied to awaken
[57:25] his likeness
[57:26] we get too satisfied and we just want
[57:29] God for everything in this world
[57:34] what about focusing on your nature
[57:36] change why isn't that important
[57:39] we can't lose focus of that
[57:42] because that's where the Living Word is
[57:44] at
[57:46] well I want to see God live in me and
[57:48] lead me to this and lead me to that show
[57:50] me what what about his will
[57:54] you're speaking of your will and God is
[57:56] good
[57:57] God will bless you
[57:59] he'll give
[58:01] he'll give he'll give
[58:03] because that's who God is he's good
[58:07] amen and he just like he gave to the
[58:09] children of Israel he gave and gave and
[58:12] gave and gave and they said we don't
[58:16] want to follow the Living Word
[58:19] they thought they were
[58:21] right but if God tells you to go after
[58:23] God his nature and you sit there like a
[58:27] bump on the log thinking the only way
[58:29] you're going to get is if he hands it to
[58:31] you all right yeah
[58:34] you're doing the same thing that's why
[58:36] we talk so much about the children
[58:37] because the Bible said it was in there
[58:39] for our example
[58:43] that happened in the natural but the
[58:45] same thing is happening in the spiritual
[58:52] all truth when you read that scripture
[58:54] he shall lead and guide you all the
[58:56] truth it's talk of it's God wants to see
[58:59] his character in you
[59:01] a nature change in you not just the
[59:04] beginning
[59:06] if it was just the beginning
[59:08] the children of Israel would have been
[59:09] okay
[59:11] because they did the beginning they came
[59:13] out they all got baptized
[59:17] they all accepted the message of the
[59:19] hour
[59:22] they they kept it going down Through the
[59:25] Ages
[59:26] Moses he was our prophet
[59:31] but they didn't go into all truth too
[59:33] many of us we want to delude all Truth
[59:36] by just the part we want to deal with
[59:40] and usually it's that part that we want
[59:42] God to help us in this life
[59:46] like there's no conversations about
[59:49] how to really take care of this ugly
[59:51] nature that we got how to how to spend
[59:55] time with our brother and her sister
[59:56] praying in the prayer rooms about
[59:58] something that we want to get rid of in
[1:00:00] our life that's what's important that's
[1:00:02] the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:00:04] [Music]
[1:00:06] Jesus said in John 10 8 all that ever
[1:00:09] came before me
[1:00:10] are thieves and robbers
[1:00:15] but the Sheep did not hear them
[1:00:18] so I want to say who are you listening
[1:00:20] to
[1:00:21] the question
[1:00:22] who are you listening to
[1:00:25] everybody
[1:00:28] wants to receive from God
[1:00:32] but God
[1:00:35] wants us to have his nature
[1:00:37] and it can't come in unless three more
[1:00:40] agency says
[1:00:42] I want you more than I want this the
[1:00:44] things of this world
[1:00:48] the children of Israel kept lusting for
[1:00:51] what their flesh wanted that's what the
[1:00:52] Bible tells us
[1:00:54] but they never longed for the Promised
[1:00:57] Land
[1:00:59] they were told this as we're gone they
[1:01:01] left Israel they said you know when they
[1:01:02] started out the journey oh yeah I want
[1:01:04] to get bad I'm gonna go I'm going to go
[1:01:05] on and get the Holy Ghost I'm gonna give
[1:01:06] my life to Christ but as they realized
[1:01:09] further in the journey that they had to
[1:01:11] give up their will
[1:01:13] they had to die out completely
[1:01:16] that wasn't very interesting to them
[1:01:17] they wanted to serve God in another way
[1:01:20] and they lost their hunger for the
[1:01:23] promised land and I want to say today
[1:01:25] how many people have lost their hunger
[1:01:27] for the Holy Ghost I'll just stay home I
[1:01:29] don't need to go to church
[1:01:32] they've lost their hunger
[1:01:35] but yet they think they're following the
[1:01:37] Lord
[1:01:39] they're deceived
[1:01:42] people are going to be deceived
[1:01:45] the children of Israel they had to
[1:01:47] they had to give up too much
[1:01:50] it they had to hurt too much they they
[1:01:53] had a fight for their nature change and
[1:01:55] they weren't willing to do it
[1:01:57] they were willing to go through the
[1:01:58] valley of the shadow of death and just
[1:02:00] trust God that everything's going to be
[1:02:02] okay when I die out to myself
[1:02:07] so they never long for the Promised Land
[1:02:11] worse yet they murmured and complained
[1:02:15] about the journey
[1:02:16] to get the Holy Ghost
[1:02:19] oh I have to go through this and I have
[1:02:22] to go through that and you know what it
[1:02:25] was easier for me when I just did what I
[1:02:26] wanted to do back in the world
[1:02:31] all that ever came before me
[1:02:34] were thieves
[1:02:36] robbers
[1:02:38] the whole world would go like this if
[1:02:41] God would just give him the Promised
[1:02:43] Land
[1:02:46] but God is asking us to denounce the
[1:02:49] devil to denounce this nature that wants
[1:02:52] to lust after everything but God
[1:02:55] to long for everything but God
[1:03:01] and we can't just say those words
[1:03:04] yeah I give my heart to God get baptized
[1:03:06] because how many people have gotten
[1:03:07] baptized in there are not nowhere is
[1:03:09] supposed to be in a fire for God
[1:03:12] Jude 1 5 says I will put there I will
[1:03:16] therefore put you in remembrance though
[1:03:20] you once knew this
[1:03:23] how that the Lord having saved the
[1:03:25] people out of the land of Egypt
[1:03:28] afterwards destroyed them
[1:03:31] that believe not
[1:03:34] I want you to understand I wish these
[1:03:37] people were here today to testify to you
[1:03:39] these people that didn't make it
[1:03:42] because they would testify of all that
[1:03:45] God did for them and how God blessed
[1:03:48] them
[1:03:49] and it was them that murmured and
[1:03:51] complained because the way
[1:03:53] to God's promise was just too hard for
[1:03:56] them
[1:04:00] they had Moses
[1:04:02] they believed
[1:04:06] to a point
[1:04:08] they believed to a point and it's like
[1:04:10] with every believer
[1:04:12] if they're not sold out Lock Stock and
[1:04:15] Barrel
[1:04:17] they will get to a point where they
[1:04:19] don't want to die out to their flesh
[1:04:20] anymore
[1:04:23] they say I've got enough
[1:04:25] I'm going to find some some church that
[1:04:27] just believes the way I believe
[1:04:31] I'm being serious
[1:04:35] oh after all the leadership that God
[1:04:37] gave all the leading of their natural
[1:04:38] lives they didn't want to follow the
[1:04:40] Living Word that was leading them to a
[1:04:42] complete nature change
[1:04:46] they want to bypass that
[1:04:50] Hebrews chapter 3 verse 11. I'll tell
[1:04:52] you we used to have more people that
[1:04:54] come to our men's meetings
[1:04:56] just gets less and less
[1:05:00] interest
[1:05:03] less people come to prayer meetings
[1:05:06] people coming to prayer meetings less
[1:05:07] people want to enter in
[1:05:09] come on yet still serving God
[1:05:16] people staying at home people making
[1:05:19] excuses
[1:05:21] look Saints I don't I don't mean this in
[1:05:24] any wrong way but I don't care if your
[1:05:27] family don't want to go you better get
[1:05:30] into Christ with everything you've got
[1:05:35] because that's what this word this is
[1:05:37] why God Has Come is for you
[1:05:40] for you that hunger for you that first
[1:05:45] Hebrews 3 verse 11 so I swear in my
[1:05:48] wrath that they shall not enter in my
[1:05:49] rest
[1:05:50] take heed brother unless there be in any
[1:05:53] of you an evil heart of unbelief in
[1:05:55] departing from
[1:05:57] the Living God
[1:05:59] they don't mind serving a dead letter
[1:06:01] God following the Bible well this is
[1:06:04] what the prophet said this is what I did
[1:06:07] but what about the Living God the one
[1:06:09] that gets up and speaks to you says this
[1:06:11] is the day I want you to die out to this
[1:06:12] this is the day I want you to reach out
[1:06:14] to somebody this is the day I want you
[1:06:16] to go help your brother your sister this
[1:06:17] is the day I want you go to church and
[1:06:19] spend some extra time praying where is
[1:06:21] that God where is that God today
[1:06:25] that's the god that we want to be an
[1:06:28] example to all
[1:06:32] but exhort one another daily while it's
[1:06:34] called day
[1:06:35] what I was called today lust
[1:06:38] any of you
[1:06:39] be hardened we should all better relate
[1:06:42] to this be hardened through the
[1:06:44] deceitfulness of sin you know I'll tell
[1:06:46] you what's so deceitful about Sin
[1:06:49] this is the to be the greatest deceit is
[1:06:52] that you can do it and everything's
[1:06:54] still going to be okay
[1:06:56] no matter what it is I mean certainly
[1:06:59] you get convicted more about certain
[1:07:00] things than other things but the real
[1:07:02] deceitfulness of sin is you can do it
[1:07:04] because we all sin and you know what
[1:07:05] we've all come short of the glory of God
[1:07:07] and the devil knows how to paint such a
[1:07:08] picture that you can just keep on doing
[1:07:10] what you're doing and you're still
[1:07:11] serving God and that is wrong
[1:07:14] the Holy Ghost is saying that is wrong
[1:07:18] if we don't stand up for this Tabernacle
[1:07:21] and say this is a tabernacle of God I
[1:07:24] will serve God for me in my house that
[1:07:26] will serve the Lord
[1:07:30] for we are made partakers of Christ if
[1:07:34] we hold the beginning of our confidence
[1:07:36] steadfast unto the end now I'll tell you
[1:07:37] what the children of Israel went out of
[1:07:40] Egypt dancing
[1:07:43] shouting they had even the things even
[1:07:47] Egypt just said take this gold and all
[1:07:49] this stuff with you
[1:07:51] they just wanted their headache away
[1:07:53] from them it was just too much God
[1:07:57] they got on the other side and they you
[1:07:59] talk about a Christmas meeting
[1:08:02] oh they were shouting and singing and
[1:08:04] singing the song of Moses I think
[1:08:07] Brother Bruce would probably know
[1:08:10] but they were having a glorious type but
[1:08:12] you know they didn't maintain that
[1:08:15] confidence to the end if they could have
[1:08:16] just said that same thing when they were
[1:08:18] going towards the Promised Land
[1:08:22] still singing still shouting still
[1:08:25] praising God for deliverance but you
[1:08:27] know they did they had such an
[1:08:29] unthankfulness that God delivered them
[1:08:31] out of the world
[1:08:33] that they forgot to continue to thank
[1:08:36] God every day
[1:08:38] for so great a Salvation
[1:08:41] it became Unfaithful that's the spirit
[1:08:43] in this age
[1:08:45] people we become Unfaithful we're
[1:08:47] unwilling to hold our confidence
[1:08:50] steadfast to the end
[1:08:53] amen Lord help us to follow the Living
[1:08:56] Word God is not a dad but he's alive
[1:09:02] while it is said today if you will hear
[1:09:04] his voice hard not your hearts as in the
[1:09:06] provocation you know there's a very
[1:09:07] scary battle that goes on when we come
[1:09:10] to church and hear the word if we're not
[1:09:12] careful
[1:09:13] we can hear the word and our heart
[1:09:14] becomes hardened
[1:09:18] it's not the fault of the word
[1:09:21] there was no fault with Moses
[1:09:24] there was no fault with Aaron
[1:09:27] there was no fault with those
[1:09:30] 170 or whoever it was that helped Moses
[1:09:33] when things got tough
[1:09:35] the word was given
[1:09:38] but if we don't want to take the word
[1:09:39] that's when our hearts become hard it
[1:09:43] has nothing to do with the preaching of
[1:09:45] the word
[1:09:45] right
[1:09:47] The Living Word is is calling us to
[1:09:50] himself calling to have a relationship
[1:09:53] that's real not some dead denomination
[1:09:56] that's hidden inside of a message Church
[1:10:05] Hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 let us
[1:10:08] therefore fear lest a promise being left
[1:10:11] us
[1:10:12] of entering into his rest
[1:10:15] any of you should seem to come short of
[1:10:17] it
[1:10:19] you know we may be satisfied with just
[1:10:21] an easy life down here
[1:10:23] but that ain't the promise that God gave
[1:10:25] us
[1:10:27] we may be satisfied with
[1:10:30] another house another car
[1:10:34] an early retirement we may be satisfied
[1:10:38] with a lot of stuff
[1:10:41] but we need to be interested in what God
[1:10:43] wants us to be interested in in what God
[1:10:46] is interested in
[1:10:48] and he's he wants to see his bride
[1:10:51] without spot without wrinkle he wants to
[1:10:54] see his bride getting ready what is she
[1:10:56] doing to get ready where is the
[1:10:58] testimonies of people who are saying I
[1:11:01] am getting ready
[1:11:03] amen this is what I put down and when I
[1:11:06] put it down it made me more ready I know
[1:11:09] I'm not completely ready but I'm moving
[1:11:11] towards that where are those testimonies
[1:11:14] now I'm speaking to the bride I can't be
[1:11:16] speaking to the foolish virgins I can't
[1:11:19] this message that can't be stunned by
[1:11:21] them this is for the bride we've got to
[1:11:25] realize who we are we got to stand up we
[1:11:28] got to tell the devil to get behind us
[1:11:31] we're not following some dead God we're
[1:11:34] following a living God
[1:11:38] For unto us was the Gospel preached as
[1:11:40] well as unto them but the word preached
[1:11:43] did not profit the foolish virgins
[1:11:46] not being mixed with faith what is faith
[1:11:51] it's the voice of God spoken to you as a
[1:11:53] living God it's a revelation that's
[1:11:56] concrete and alive
[1:11:59] uh honestly
[1:12:01] a fear coming into church and not
[1:12:03] hearing from God
[1:12:05] when God is there when God is speaking
[1:12:10] why would I come and just feel like I
[1:12:13] did my job to be there
[1:12:15] and not hear from him personally
[1:12:19] we must follow the Living Word
[1:12:23] how many times do you come to church and
[1:12:24] said you know I've heard this already
[1:12:26] come on
[1:12:27] come on I ordered this
[1:12:29] yeah
[1:12:31] why don't we just tell
[1:12:33] Paul and Jesus and everybody in the New
[1:12:36] Testament yeah we read the Old Testament
[1:12:38] why are you bringing it up in the new
[1:12:39] why are you telling me that I will I'll
[1:12:41] put you in remembrance of this
[1:12:43] why
[1:12:45] because the devil wants us to forget he
[1:12:48] just wants us to have church and play
[1:12:50] religion and oh yeah I'm in the message
[1:12:53] we're different we're the only church
[1:12:55] here in the area
[1:12:58] come on God has called us to be a Living
[1:13:01] Word a living example
[1:13:04] we can't do that if he's not pulsating
[1:13:07] living out of us
[1:13:11] let's look at Peter a moment
[1:13:13] when Jesus saw Peter and his brother
[1:13:16] Andrew fishing he said come
[1:13:19] follow me I'll make you Fishers of Men
[1:13:21] the very first words that we know that
[1:13:24] Jesus spoke to Peter
[1:13:27] we know straightway they left their Nets
[1:13:29] they followed they followed him
[1:13:31] I'll say there must have had been a
[1:13:33] spiritual connection there
[1:13:36] he never he never said uh you know come
[1:13:38] and I'll make your life easier
[1:13:41] I'll Prosper you
[1:13:44] I'll give you bigger boats and you know
[1:13:46] automatic fishing nets and all that he
[1:13:48] never said that
[1:13:50] he never promised them anything
[1:13:52] profitable for the Flesh in fact his
[1:13:55] promise include responsibility
[1:14:01] you want to fish you keep fishing but
[1:14:03] I'm going to make you Fishers of Men
[1:14:09] there must have been a spiritual
[1:14:11] connection they weren't worried about
[1:14:12] getting rich or an easier way
[1:14:15] Jesus taught them to be Fishers of Men
[1:14:18] he sent them out two by two he gave him
[1:14:20] power over the enemy
[1:14:23] but their Ministry really didn't start
[1:14:25] their calling
[1:14:28] the ministry that they were called to
[1:14:30] really didn't start for almost four
[1:14:31] years after God called them
[1:14:35] and even then Jesus warned them not to
[1:14:38] witness until they were filled with the
[1:14:39] Living Word
[1:14:42] it wasn't good enough just to be taught
[1:14:47] amen they had to have Christ living
[1:14:49] through them
[1:14:50] the dead letter isn't sufficient for us
[1:14:52] to witness
[1:14:55] it's not because that's all everybody
[1:14:58] else is witnessing with
[1:15:01] oh
[1:15:02] the Bible talks about prosely lighting
[1:15:05] and getting one from one Church to
[1:15:07] another church and
[1:15:09] what good is it if they don't meet
[1:15:10] Christ
[1:15:12] what good is it if their nature doesn't
[1:15:13] change
[1:15:17] it's got to change
[1:15:20] Peter like a lot of us who expressed
[1:15:22] their commitment to God said behold we
[1:15:26] are forsaken on to follow thee
[1:15:29] what else what shall we have therefore
[1:15:33] in other words what is left for us to do
[1:15:37] we've done everything we've we've left
[1:15:39] everything we've given up everything we
[1:15:41] are completely following you that's what
[1:15:43] Peter was saying
[1:15:46] a lot of us we testify like that oh yeah
[1:15:49] I'm serving God I give my heart to God
[1:15:51] but somebody try to hold you accountable
[1:15:53] to something and you get all offended
[1:16:04] Peter said though all men shall be
[1:16:06] offended because of thee yet will I
[1:16:09] never be offended
[1:16:13] oh he had a strong belief
[1:16:17] Jesus said verily I say unto thee that
[1:16:20] this night before the Crow thou
[1:16:22] shall deny me Thrice
[1:16:24] look at Peter's response back to the
[1:16:27] Living Word
[1:16:28] though I should die with thee yet will
[1:16:32] not yet will I not deny thee
[1:16:36] and he would he was the spokesman for
[1:16:38] everybody in the church there and he
[1:16:40] said likewise also said all the
[1:16:42] disciples yeah yeah we're with Peter
[1:16:45] well we know what happened
[1:16:49] Jesus knew what Peter and his elected
[1:16:52] disciples had done
[1:16:54] up to that point was not sufficient
[1:16:59] he wasn't like discouraging them
[1:17:02] where they were at
[1:17:05] but he was also letting them know that
[1:17:08] where you're at isn't enough amen
[1:17:13] if you stay there with that because look
[1:17:15] the devil's always trying to tell us you
[1:17:17] got enough
[1:17:20] you got enough
[1:17:22] and then
[1:17:24] if he can't get you with that and say
[1:17:26] well that's not true that's not the
[1:17:28] right Spirit you've got to press towards
[1:17:30] the mark and you start trying to press
[1:17:33] towards the mark then the Devil comes
[1:17:35] and he condemns you
[1:17:36] and he says God ain't going to hear your
[1:17:38] prayer there's no use for that you
[1:17:40] mouths are just lay back
[1:17:43] I mean this is a spiritual warfare when
[1:17:45] we're in it's a real battle we're in the
[1:17:48] greatest battle over fault
[1:17:50] yes
[1:17:53] we got to keep pressing
[1:17:59] we've got to continue to keep following
[1:18:01] the Living Word
[1:18:04] Matthew chapter 19 verse 28 Jesus said
[1:18:07] to Peter now
[1:18:10] Peter is a monks and when he said this
[1:18:11] verily I say unto you
[1:18:13] that ye which have followed me in the
[1:18:15] Regeneration when the son of man shall
[1:18:18] sit in the Throne of his glory ye also
[1:18:21] shall sit upon the twelve Thrones
[1:18:23] judging the 12 tribes of Israel but
[1:18:26] notice
[1:18:28] the criteria here is to follow him into
[1:18:31] regeneration
[1:18:33] if we're not completely regenerated that
[1:18:37] word regeneration it means a spiritual
[1:18:39] rebirth
[1:18:41] completely spiritually rebirth
[1:18:48] now when it all came down to it at the
[1:18:51] end the children of Israel they went in
[1:18:53] and took the Promised Land
[1:19:00] before they did that
[1:19:02] those that were not elected
[1:19:06] but they were in the church
[1:19:08] wanted to stay outside and serve God out
[1:19:12] there
[1:19:15] they started
[1:19:17] the they started down the birth canal if
[1:19:21] I could say
[1:19:23] or
[1:19:24] any way that you want to visualize this
[1:19:26] thing they did not completely become
[1:19:29] born completely born again something
[1:19:31] stopped in the in the process
[1:19:35] and the church is full of those people
[1:19:37] just like it was then
[1:19:41] there was the majority of those people
[1:19:43] over 20 years old all but two were like
[1:19:46] that I'm not speaking
[1:19:49] of something that's odd
[1:19:52] it's just odd
[1:19:54] to the Natural Church world
[1:19:56] but it's scriptural it's right in the
[1:20:00] word
[1:20:01] our souls must be completely regenerated
[1:20:04] we have to keep following Christ and we
[1:20:07] be until we become just like him without
[1:20:10] spot without wrinkle or any such blemish
[1:20:13] now I know we can all look at one
[1:20:15] another's life you can look at mine I
[1:20:17] can look at yours and we can call out
[1:20:19] things I understand that I know that and
[1:20:22] I'm not talking about that
[1:20:25] I'm talking about where is your hunger
[1:20:27] today where is your thirst today what
[1:20:30] are you pressing towards today
[1:20:33] is this just church and then it's over
[1:20:36] then you're going on today or do you
[1:20:37] want this word to change your life
[1:20:40] because it all has to do with you if
[1:20:43] you're waiting for God to come down and
[1:20:44] shake your chair pick you up and make
[1:20:47] you feel good brother sister that's
[1:20:49] wrong
[1:20:53] I have sinned so much I am Unworthy of
[1:20:56] his presence I'm unworthy to be in this
[1:20:59] house I am unworthy for him to come down
[1:21:01] and change me
[1:21:04] that's why the Bible says if my people
[1:21:06] which are called by my name shall humble
[1:21:08] themselves I will hear from heaven
[1:21:11] we got a job to do
[1:21:16] it's an individual affair
[1:21:19] but our nature must become completely
[1:21:21] his nature inside of us manifesting
[1:21:25] outside to where we become an example
[1:21:28] to everyone amen
[1:21:31] no
[1:21:33] nature isn't seen until it's in trouble
[1:21:41] anybody can be polite and open the door
[1:21:44] for somebody
[1:21:48] but if the last three people shut the
[1:21:51] door on your nose
[1:21:54] you're not going to be so eager
[1:21:56] to want to open that door
[1:22:01] so when I'm talking we come to church
[1:22:03] and we hear about nature change we're
[1:22:05] not hearing about how good we act in
[1:22:07] front of one another
[1:22:09] we're talking about what thoughts we
[1:22:11] think about one another when they're not
[1:22:13] around when the Devil comes and pollutes
[1:22:16] our mind with the wrong thoughts
[1:22:20] where are you going to take a stand
[1:22:24] now watch this we're
[1:22:27] focusing our attention and I see God for
[1:22:30] his leadership in our life Jesus draws
[1:22:33] your attention away to his purpose here
[1:22:36] in verse 29 and every one of them that
[1:22:39] are forsaken houses
[1:22:41] and Brethren sisters father or mother or
[1:22:45] wife children look lands
[1:22:48] we got to forsake a lot here our whole
[1:22:51] desire is God help me with this light
[1:22:54] give help me here show me this Lord lead
[1:22:56] me over here I need you for this
[1:22:59] and now we're seeing here the scripture
[1:23:01] saying we got to forsake that
[1:23:03] we gotta forsake it and yeah we're
[1:23:05] asking God for leadership in it
[1:23:09] uh no this servant can be twisted but
[1:23:12] the spirit is right the spirit is right
[1:23:16] God take these words and make them right
[1:23:18] in our hearts
[1:23:22] for my name's sake we've got to give it
[1:23:26] all for God's name's sake shall receive
[1:23:28] a hundredfold and shall inherit
[1:23:32] eternal life
[1:23:35] you know that wasn't just at the
[1:23:36] beginning when you got baptized
[1:23:40] but many that are first shall be last
[1:23:44] and the last shall be first
[1:23:47] I'll just say like this either way
[1:23:49] you're going to have life
[1:23:51] everybody that's born one time has life
[1:23:53] right
[1:23:55] you either have it here
[1:23:58] first
[1:24:00] or you give everything up and have it a
[1:24:03] thousand times better over on the other
[1:24:04] side
[1:24:06] choice is yours
[1:24:08] it's all of our choices individual Fair
[1:24:10] it's why it doesn't matter to me what
[1:24:11] anybody does that's why I'm free from
[1:24:14] all men
[1:24:17] and nobody can hold me back from giving
[1:24:19] my all to Christ
[1:24:21] no one
[1:24:23] no matter what comes against me no
[1:24:25] matter what is said about me no no
[1:24:27] matter how many
[1:24:29] doesn't matter
[1:24:32] doesn't matter
[1:24:35] The Living Word is leading us to store
[1:24:38] up Treasures on the other side that's
[1:24:39] what it's doing and we've got to follow
[1:24:41] the Living Word
[1:24:45] now here in John 21 if you want to turn
[1:24:47] there
[1:24:50] Jesus has his last conversation with
[1:24:52] Peter remember we started out there ever
[1:24:54] since they started but a little earlier
[1:24:56] in this message we started out talking
[1:24:57] about when Peter Peter was first called
[1:25:00] to follow him make Fishers a man
[1:25:03] we're trying to con get to the end
[1:25:07] The Living Word
[1:25:09] has a a very important message for Peter
[1:25:12] to remember when Jesus is gone
[1:25:15] and he told us this is Peter do you
[1:25:17] still love me more than
[1:25:19] your brothers and sisters father mother
[1:25:22] these other disciples he says yay Lord
[1:25:25] thou knowest I love thee and Jesus says
[1:25:28] feed my Lambs
[1:25:31] still talking
[1:25:33] about being a fisher of men
[1:25:38] because we do not lead call somebody we
[1:25:43] don't catch somebody
[1:25:45] to Christ
[1:25:46] without trying to feed them
[1:25:50] God wants us to keep feeding them
[1:25:53] keep nurturing them
[1:25:57] Peter do you remember your original
[1:25:59] calling come and follow me and I'll make
[1:26:03] you Fishers amen then keep feeding my
[1:26:06] Lambs
[1:26:08] John 21 18 verily verily I say unto thee
[1:26:11] when thou was young
[1:26:14] thou greatest thyself and walk us
[1:26:16] whether thou wouldest
[1:26:18] but when thou shall be old
[1:26:21] thou shall stretch forth thine hands and
[1:26:24] another shall girth thee and carry thee
[1:26:27] whether thou wouldest not
[1:26:31] this fake he signifying by what death he
[1:26:35] should be glory that he should glorify
[1:26:37] God
[1:26:38] and when he had spoken this he said unto
[1:26:41] him
[1:26:47] here Jesus
[1:26:49] is telling Peter about his death the end
[1:26:55] of his life
[1:26:57] and his last word was to him was follow
[1:26:59] me
[1:27:04] if we could focus on how important it is
[1:27:06] to follow God instead of just trying to
[1:27:08] use God for our life
[1:27:14] God doesn't work for every one of us
[1:27:17] I mean we have enough people here to
[1:27:19] shake up things
[1:27:21] we do if we could just stay focused on
[1:27:25] following the Living Word
[1:27:28] not using God for what we want but
[1:27:31] putting ourself in the hands of God and
[1:27:33] saying God use me
[1:27:37] verse 19 this spake he signified by what
[1:27:41] death he should glorify God Amen and
[1:27:43] when he had spoken this he said unto him
[1:27:45] follow me in other words Peter you keep
[1:27:49] following me to the end of your death
[1:27:55] don't just wander off yeah I'm following
[1:27:59] it's real Peter got off many times
[1:28:03] but I'll tell you when he got the Holy
[1:28:04] Ghost he was a lot more consistent
[1:28:08] he was a lot more consistent when he got
[1:28:10] the Holy Ghost
[1:28:13] not at that point in this very intimate
[1:28:16] conversation with Jesus at the end
[1:28:18] before Jesus is leaving
[1:28:20] think about you just only had a little
[1:28:22] bit longer with Jesus what would you say
[1:28:24] to him
[1:28:26] well this is what Peter said Peter
[1:28:29] started getting nosy with other men's
[1:28:30] business
[1:28:33] verse 20 then Peter turning around
[1:28:35] seeing the disciple whom Jesus loved
[1:28:38] following
[1:28:40] which also leaned upon the breast at
[1:28:42] supper and said Lord which is he that
[1:28:45] betrayeth thee
[1:28:47] we know that Peter was speaking to John
[1:28:50] Peter seeing John saith to Jesus Lord
[1:28:54] and what shall this man do
[1:28:58] come on he's one of us he's one of the
[1:29:02] disciples what's he gonna do and Jesus
[1:29:05] saith unto him if I will that he Terry
[1:29:08] till I come what is it to thee
[1:29:10] would you just focus on the what's been
[1:29:13] ministered to you today follow me
[1:29:17] follow me don't worry about this brother
[1:29:19] this sister don't worry what's going on
[1:29:21] over here
[1:29:23] what is it to thee and I want to just
[1:29:24] say it like this it is nobody's business
[1:29:27] what's happening in your life
[1:29:29] it's between you and God
[1:29:32] it's your relationship with God
[1:29:35] if God shows you anything about anybody
[1:29:37] he wants you to help them
[1:29:41] never talk about it
[1:29:43] never entertain thoughts of the devil
[1:29:46] don't wait till you get all mad and
[1:29:48] upset and want to tell somebody say I'm
[1:29:49] telling you this you know in confidence
[1:29:51] don't say it that's what the devil wants
[1:29:58] what is it to thee
[1:30:00] just follow me
[1:30:02] focus on what God wants you to do
[1:30:05] amen God has a work for you
[1:30:08] well I just want to know you know it
[1:30:11] doesn't matter if he puts John up here
[1:30:14] puts John down there
[1:30:16] it doesn't matter
[1:30:18] if I don't do my job what does it matter
[1:30:20] if everybody else what anybody else does
[1:30:22] I don't want to fail the Lord we don't
[1:30:25] want to fail the Lord and if we don't
[1:30:27] stay focused on that sometimes we come
[1:30:29] to church and because everybody else is
[1:30:31] down we're going to be down yeah because
[1:30:33] nobody else is in the room I'm only
[1:30:35] going to spend three minutes in there
[1:30:38] come on where's where's somebody who's
[1:30:41] going to be an example when nobody else
[1:30:44] is
[1:30:44] where is that person
[1:30:54] keep focusing on the Lord
[1:30:56] keep helping others get to heaven keep
[1:30:59] saving Souls keep feeding the Sheep
[1:31:04] keep feeding the bride
[1:31:07] verse 23 then went this saying abroad
[1:31:11] among
[1:31:12] the Brethren that the disciples should
[1:31:14] not die yet Jesus said not unto him he
[1:31:17] shall not die but
[1:31:19] if I will that ye Terry till I come what
[1:31:21] is it to thee
[1:31:22] it's amazing how we want to interpret
[1:31:24] the word
[1:31:27] we desperately need the Holy Ghost to
[1:31:29] tell us what the word is saying
[1:31:31] the main message I see here that Peter
[1:31:34] should be interested in that we should
[1:31:35] all be interested in is follow the lord
[1:31:38] Follow The Living Word
[1:31:40] if we're following the Living Word we're
[1:31:42] following Christ if we're following a
[1:31:44] dead letter we are not following Christ
[1:31:50] we're just we're just following a
[1:31:52] religion a religious covering
[1:31:55] too many people have forsaken The Living
[1:31:57] Word
[1:31:58] they've opted out to now walk in the
[1:32:00] light that's being presented to them at
[1:32:02] church
[1:32:03] or if they're listening to tapes or if
[1:32:05] they're praying
[1:32:07] and God speaks to them
[1:32:13] there are believers who are faithful to
[1:32:15] going to church
[1:32:17] but refuse to walk in the light
[1:32:22] we've got to keep walking in the light
[1:32:24] as he's in the light
[1:32:25] take time to pray
[1:32:30] take time to humbly ask God I don't
[1:32:32] really have ears enough to hear what
[1:32:34] you're speaking to me I honestly need
[1:32:36] your help
[1:32:37] that that being clothed with humility is
[1:32:40] what brings God personally to you
[1:32:42] what makes a personal connection with
[1:32:44] you
[1:32:46] the Bible says that God was not pleased
[1:32:48] with many of them
[1:32:51] that he saved out of the land of Egypt
[1:32:54] why was that
[1:32:56] because they only wanted to follow the
[1:32:58] lord until they were saved from their
[1:33:00] natural problems
[1:33:03] and how many people today only want to
[1:33:05] be saved from their natural problems
[1:33:07] there isn't much of an interest
[1:33:11] for giving their life to Christ
[1:33:14] let's pick it up here in numbers 32
[1:33:15] verse 10. are you with me can I take a
[1:33:17] few more minutes
[1:33:20] and the Lord's anger was Kindred in
[1:33:23] Numbers chapter 32 verse 10.
[1:33:26] the same time and he swear saying surely
[1:33:29] none of the men that came up out of
[1:33:32] Egypt from 20 years old and upward shall
[1:33:35] see the land which I swear unto Abraham
[1:33:37] Isaac and Jacob because now here's
[1:33:39] here's some really important because
[1:33:42] they have not wholly followed me
[1:33:47] now every one of them I can say followed
[1:33:49] the Lord
[1:33:51] look they went for 40 years wandered
[1:33:54] around in the wilderness had all these
[1:33:55] experiences and here they were
[1:33:59] foreign
[1:34:01] but God said no they haven't it don't
[1:34:04] matter what our eyes see
[1:34:07] God's seeing the heart and in their
[1:34:09] heart they had forsaken giving God their
[1:34:12] whole heart
[1:34:13] the whole church world is full of people
[1:34:15] who just give part of themselves
[1:34:17] and that's why there's a falling away
[1:34:19] but if you sell out Lock Stock and
[1:34:21] Barrel I'm telling you you're secure
[1:34:24] you're secure
[1:34:26] because God will not let anything
[1:34:29] separate you from him
[1:34:32] but you got to sell out you can't go
[1:34:35] halfway and try to claim the promises it
[1:34:38] don't work
[1:34:43] because they have not wholly followed
[1:34:46] the Lord
[1:34:48] verse 12 save Caleb and the son of
[1:34:51] juniper and
[1:34:54] the kensanite and Joshua the son of none
[1:34:57] for they
[1:34:59] have holy follow the lord so here they
[1:35:02] were they were in the same church they
[1:35:03] followed the same prophet
[1:35:05] but God is making a separation between
[1:35:07] the two
[1:35:08] amen one was following one was not
[1:35:11] and what's important here he uses the
[1:35:14] word holy we all know what hole is
[1:35:17] we all know the difference between the
[1:35:21] the pumpkin pie that was still in the
[1:35:23] container at the end of the potluck
[1:35:25] yesterday and the other pie that was
[1:35:28] partially used
[1:35:30] right one was whole and the other was
[1:35:34] partial
[1:35:37] so if I say would you like to take a
[1:35:39] piece of pie home
[1:35:41] we would be taking it from
[1:35:43] the pie that had part of it but if I
[1:35:46] said would you like to take the whole
[1:35:47] pie home
[1:35:49] you take the whole pie and you know what
[1:35:51] it is you've been to certain stores or
[1:35:53] restaurants and they say I like to get
[1:35:56] to get a pie and they say would you like
[1:35:57] a whole pie or a piece
[1:35:59] oh this is this is this is no different
[1:36:02] than what God is doing
[1:36:04] he said I really don't want lukewarm I
[1:36:08] really don't want a partial believer all
[1:36:11] in or all out and if you don't make that
[1:36:14] decision he said I will make it
[1:36:18] I will spew you out of my mouth and
[1:36:20] that's what he did to those there was
[1:36:23] only two
[1:36:24] two
[1:36:26] that made the right choice
[1:36:28] the other ones were too afraid
[1:36:31] they were just holding on that God would
[1:36:33] still love him and find a way for them
[1:36:36] but he didn't and tell you this is for
[1:36:39] us spiritually
[1:36:42] trust spiritually
[1:36:45] we've got to follow the Living Word
[1:36:48] did you know when you follow the Living
[1:36:50] Word you come to church and you hear the
[1:36:51] word and it may seem very minute like
[1:36:54] nothing really to do
[1:36:56] with what you think is important but yet
[1:36:59] God spoke it to you and something
[1:37:00] happened in here yeah
[1:37:03] if you follow that you obey that it will
[1:37:06] literally liberate you more
[1:37:08] yeah it'll liberate your life
[1:37:11] and that's what the word does it it
[1:37:13] comes to liberate us
[1:37:16] into all truth
[1:37:18] John chapter eight I'm skipping a lot of
[1:37:20] stuff here eight
[1:37:22] verse 31 then Jesus said to those Jews
[1:37:25] which believed on him if you continue in
[1:37:28] my word then are you my disciples indeed
[1:37:30] so after this example about the children
[1:37:32] of Israel there was a group of people
[1:37:33] who did not continue to follow the lord
[1:37:36] and now he's given them the same message
[1:37:39] in the New Testament these are believers
[1:37:41] who already believed on Jesus they
[1:37:44] already believed he didn't deny it he
[1:37:47] said but you've got to continue
[1:37:49] you can't stay where you're at right and
[1:37:52] you shall know the truth and the truth
[1:37:54] shall make you free
[1:37:57] that word make
[1:37:58] means to liberate
[1:38:01] it will liberate you now we've all had
[1:38:04] of course when we came to Christ we had
[1:38:06] a lot of vices
[1:38:08] right we had a lot of habits we had a
[1:38:12] lot of things that we did wrong and you
[1:38:14] know God didn't take them all away at
[1:38:16] one second
[1:38:21] he's building the church he did how he
[1:38:23] want when he went for whatever reasons
[1:38:25] he did
[1:38:28] but when we continue to come to church
[1:38:32] and hear the word and get serious with
[1:38:34] God
[1:38:36] good things happen to a believer
[1:38:39] now there are
[1:38:41] there are many who come to church and
[1:38:44] don't do nothing with the word
[1:38:46] and their life seems to be dormant
[1:38:50] from real vibrant life from real joy and
[1:38:53] peace
[1:38:54] but God has come to set us free amen
[1:38:58] all right
[1:39:02] he gives us Grace when we receive that
[1:39:05] truth because right now when we're in
[1:39:07] the world how many times we've talked to
[1:39:09] people who want to be set free but don't
[1:39:11] know what to do can't do nothing I can't
[1:39:12] do it I don't know what to do I tried
[1:39:14] that it don't work how many times you
[1:39:15] had people tell you oh I tried that it
[1:39:17] didn't work
[1:39:18] I tried God I tried church I tried it
[1:39:21] didn't work
[1:39:25] well I do know this on the day when we
[1:39:29] all stand before the Lord Judgment Day
[1:39:31] there won't be one failure with God
[1:39:38] will have not failed one person
[1:39:42] but the devil convinces a lot of people
[1:39:44] oh I tried it didn't work
[1:39:47] which automatically tells us
[1:39:50] that they didn't do their part
[1:39:54] it isn't God
[1:39:55] is perfect how can he be wrong in any
[1:39:58] scenario
[1:40:00] even in his waiting for us to get to a
[1:40:03] place
[1:40:04] where he could do what he wants to do
[1:40:06] he's just perfect in his timing he's
[1:40:09] perfect in everything
[1:40:13] so he that the son is set free is free
[1:40:16] indeed so we just got to keep following
[1:40:19] the Living Word
[1:40:21] and we've got to recognize the Living
[1:40:22] Word before we can follow it
[1:40:25] look at the two disciples walking on the
[1:40:27] road to DeMent
[1:40:28] to Emmaus they didn't recognize the word
[1:40:32] how about Jesus when he was inside of uh
[1:40:36] a Marion and and was born and they did
[1:40:39] not recognize the living word among them
[1:40:42] in fact there was so much a reputation
[1:40:44] of being a bastard child
[1:40:47] and there was just a total negativity
[1:40:51] they weren't recognizing they weren't
[1:40:53] walking with the word
[1:40:55] they just wanted God for their natural
[1:40:57] lives
[1:41:00] how about who do men say that I am
[1:41:04] this that and the other everybody has
[1:41:06] their opinion about the word
[1:41:09] amen but there are very few that are
[1:41:12] catching the Living Word God help us
[1:41:15] let's stand together I don't mean to
[1:41:16] take so much your time I'm just going to
[1:41:18] have to
[1:41:19] I see some of you just struggling and I
[1:41:21] don't like to see that
[1:41:22] I know there's some that are enjoying it
[1:41:25] but some are struggling
[1:41:27] brother Brian says we've got to
[1:41:29] recognize
[1:41:30] the message
[1:41:32] amen the hour that we're living in the
[1:41:34] day that we're living in
[1:41:36] my sheep hear my voice and they follow
[1:41:40] me
[1:41:42] just to encourage you with this
[1:41:43] scripture here in first Thessalonians
[1:41:45] chapter 2 verse 13 for this call is also
[1:41:48] thank we god without ceasing because
[1:41:50] when you receive the word of God
[1:41:52] which he heard of us
[1:41:54] you received it not as the word of men
[1:41:58] but as it is in truth the word of God
[1:42:00] which effectually worketh also in you
[1:42:03] that believe
[1:42:06] so let's become followers of a Living
[1:42:09] Word
[1:42:10] take the time
[1:42:12] to find out where Christ is alive inside
[1:42:14] of you
[1:42:16] what he wants you to be doing
[1:42:18] and I'll tell you let's just stay away
[1:42:21] from asking God
[1:42:25] anything for this Natural Life
[1:42:31] but I will say this if you want God to
