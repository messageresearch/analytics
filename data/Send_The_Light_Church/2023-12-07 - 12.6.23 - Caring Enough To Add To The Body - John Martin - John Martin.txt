volunteer but uh it would be you know I wish there was more the whole church was here because it'd be nice to get some new volunteers to help out after service and clean up and do tidy up the house of

it is an honor when we were in the world we were a sanctuary for the enemy we just didn't realize it and now to know that all that time we were doing exactly what the devil wanted us to do we've been born again converted come into this new walk and it is an honor to be a sanctuary for the Lord am amen well God bless you we're we're a few in number we're our hearts go out to those who are battling the different sicknesses and things let's approach the Lord in a word of prayer before we get into his word tonight our heavenly father we thank you that you've given us strength and health to be here in your house today we thank you for watching over us in our travels and uh just bringing us here this moment Lord and our our prayer together Lord this part of the body that's here is is praying for the other part of the the body that is not here tonight that you would be with each and and every family that you would be with each and every member that's uh hurting at this moment that's uh going through uh this Affliction and and sickness and we just pray father that you would raise up a standard against the enemy father that you would put a hatch of protection around your children today Father may you your grace be with each and every one we pray and now Lord as we look look into the scriptures today we pray father that you would just bless your your Church Father for Lord we're we're unworthy to even approach you unworthy to look upon Thy word and yet Lord we're looking to you and asking that your mercies would be upon us father that you would Prosper this little church Lord that you'd help us to to be a more healthy church that to to function in a way that when you look down upon us you would be pleased with how we handle things here Lord we need you to come and and just help us to mature father we commit this service into your hands and we give you the praise and honor for all these things now for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen well uh we want to continue in this uh series functioning uh uh of a healthy uh body and we want to take our our scriptures once again from Ephesians chapter 4 verses 15 and 16 because there's a lot in these these scriptures and if we um continue to go over them we would just get more and more out of them amen it's been about a month since we we started with uh or that we last spoke on on this but here it says in verse 15 the Paul speaking to the Ephesian Church age which we know was a mature church but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body that you and I fitly join together and compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body un the edifying of itself in loveen God bless you may be seated now if you can just imagine for a moment that the whole church would be filled there'd be somebody in every seat and you would be sitting amongst others who if when you look to your left uh that person you and that person there there would be a joint there when you look to your right that would be a joint there and we're connected with one another we're a body and we been given this word to to grow up and handle things the way that Christ would in in in in supplying what is needed in that joint with that person and so that's I I we all struggle at times of of having um good relationships or working out situations sometimes we struggle and we have a a hard time getting along and and making a situation be win-win in our homes or in our jobs or family members and and it's no different than here in church and to be honest with you if you're very good at working out problems in in in your home you're pretty good at working out things in a church you're better all you're better able to work out things in a church because the same the same um the same things that you use to work out problems in a home are are the same things that you use to work out problems in a church in other words you when you're working out a problem in in the home I I if if me being ahead I could not go to my my wife all the time and say you better listen to me I'm the head of the home what I say goes and I don't care what you got to say that that that wouldn't work right okay so that don't work in church just because we tell somebody the word we need to speak the truth in love amen so God has to be behind it amen so in part one we talked about recognizing our spiritual position so as brother brandham Tau us we've got to find oursel in the scriptures uh so one day I found myself in the script rure I was a sinner I was going to hell and I needed salvation and and God Justified me and then I I found myself in the scriptures again that I was justified but I I wasn't living a Sanctified life there was a lot of stuff still in my life that was hanging on and and bad habits and evil things and uh I had to I had to find what the answer was to help me with my my position that that I recognized in the scriptures and I needed to live a Sanctified light I need to start putting things away and I needed to start doing adding the right things to my life and and then after I became Sanctified I I I had to find myself in the scriptures again I was missing the Holy Ghost even though I was living a clean life I I was still missing the the the the the Lord Jesus Christ filling my heart with joy every day to serve him and to to give my life to him because I could be justified ifed and Sanctified and still not live for God you're you're that when you got the Holy Ghost when you are filled sealed with the Holy Ghost you are living for God Amen that's just just all there is to it so we've got to we've got to find oursel in the scriptures and then as we find ourselves in the scriptures we recognize that there's other people in the church who are in they're doing the same thing we're doing they're finding themselves in the scriptures and they're trying to become more like Christ and then we have to learn to get along with them we have to learn to grow and discern the rest of the body it and and not have uh thoughts of this person is a little bit you know off you we don't want thoughts like that if anything I'm off so we have a spiritual position in the church body now many people think of a spiritual position as someone who's a pastor or a deacon a teacher uh some sort of leader it's like an official office that's recognized by the church and I'm not talking that that's not a spiritual position that I'm talking about we may not all have an office in the church but we all have a spiritual position in the church and God has called each of us to spiritually edify every part of the body of Christ in love we just read that he wants us to be a spiritual supplier to others and to to to give a measure to help every person that would be in need and you don't got to talk to somebody very long you we should better be recognizing there's something there that we can help with and we just we walk into that the focus has to be turned towards others that's what makes a healthy body is when we're when we're when we're thinking of others so we must believe and we must recognize that that there is number one a spiritual position for us in the church and it doesn't have anything to do with us with what we want with what we got going on in life it has everything to do with what God has going on in the church and we're to fit into that amen so in order to recognize it we have to be spiritually minded we have to have spiritual eyesight and then once we recognize it we can begin to step into it because we've just read you know we're supposed to love one another and we're supposed to be connected and and and Supply well that's great I recognize that but but and now I got to step into it now I got to start doing it amen that that's a lot harder it takes a a lot more of the mind of Christ amen we just can't come into church at the last minute not be prepared and and think that you know we're going to spiritually be in our position we can't have the world hanging on us we got to spend some time in in prayer and and and get prepared so when we step into our spiritual position we're stepping into the realm of helping others don't ever forget that statement amen you're stepping into a realm of helping others you've left yourself and now you're stepping in to helping others it's not about ourselves it's not about edifying ourselves it's it's it's about others we mentioned one of the greatest enemies of of stepping into our position with selfishness I'm just recapping a little bit I hope that's okay one of the biggest reasons a church is not healthy is because of selfishness it's the same thing with the marriage amen you get in a marriage and if if one of the persons is is is extremely selfish it puts all the responsibility on the one person that's not amen and so it'll it'll it'll it's an at to me selfishness can be it's like an attitude and in other words the attitude is all about me all about what I want and it will break a marriage it'll break a company it'll break a church it'll break whatever it it it's around too often people walk in the vanity of their mind and not thinking about others selfishness and pride will blind us from being able to actually see nor step in our spiritual position because I mean imagine coming to church and if the whole thing you did was talk about you just for a moment think about that then church would become about you but we're a body to go ahead and ignore the body is to ignore Christ right because heaven was not made just for me heaven was made for the whole body of Christ amen and so we have to be more conscious of the whole body and that's that takes I believe the mind of Christ so we I want to read this again it's in Philippians chapter 2 because this not only helps us in stepping into our our position having the mind of Christ about to step into it but it also is going to uh help us in in our in our in our our part three of caring enough about the body of Christ and that's really what part three is going to be is we have to care enough if if we don't care enough we're going to stop short so Philippians chapter 2 starting with verse number one if there be any therefore any consolation in Christ any comfort of love any Fellowship of the spirit any bows and mercy mercies fulfill ye my joy and be likeminded so we want to be a healthy Church be likeminded amen I I don't want you to to to believe in me liking Fords or or blueberry pie or or chicken without bones in it that's not the likeminded that I want or wearing ties or not wearing ties or nothing like that the what we need to be likeminded with was what what does the word require of us amen what does the word require of us that that being light-minded having look at the same love that means I don't want you to have my love and I don't want your love but we both want the love of God Amen because that will get the job done being of one Accord and one mind so one love one Accord one mind likeminded let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory okay that that would not be that would not be Christ right that that's not the mind of Christ but in loneliness of Mind Let each person talk about the other person better than themselves yes so this is what makes a healthy church I just kind of if I could just say something for a moment at my work I learned a lot having a business amen and I had employees working for me and I still got many of the same employees of course we had some retire but one he's really like one of my favorites his name is David Bailey and uh God willing he may come here um and and and and visit uh maybe for this weekend but um um once in a while you know we would kid around with one another and I noticed that when there would be a a a a sarcastic comments going back and forth it would could create an atmosphere where eventually somebody gets hurt does anybody know what I'm talking about eventually somebody gets hurt but then we started esteeming the other better than ourself we started complimenting one another every time we were working on something every time we did something and you know what we just kept building one another up building one another up and the atmosphere in the in the shop was so much more beautiful right because we followed the word amen we followed the word it was the mind of Christ to be in unison you don't lose anything by building something somebody up amen you gain you gain Christ because Christ is is pleased with that it says look not every man on his own things but every man on the things of others imagine that you're coming in and everybody's wanting to know about you what's going on how can I help is that beautiful let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus in other words that was the mind that was in Christ and so if we want a healthy church we have got to let this mind be in us personally now don't wait for it to happen in somebody else right come on don't do that don't wait till everybody around you has got the mind of Christ before you start trying don't do that because the devil's going to show you lots of problems lots of things amen and you just got to step up into your position and be what Christ wants you to be be the first one on the Block that says I'm gonna I'm going to have the mind of Christ I'm going to help uh a situation that nobody else would help amen amen all right who being in the form of God thought not robbery to be equal of God made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men so imagine having a conversation that your conversation never talks about how good you are that's what Christ did and he took upon him the form of a servant verse eight and being found in the fashion as a man he humbled himself there's there is the humble mind of Christ right there we want a healthy Church everybody you talk to let them see the humility of Christ let them see that humble mind because you'll recognize how you can help people if you humble and he became obedient unto death even the death of the cross I just love that that that scripture we we we need the mind of Christ The Humble mind of Christ in order to function as a healthy body and it needs needs to be the body we can't have favorites you can't have favorites that's like putting peacock feathers that's like trying to be a a a a a good show Christian at certain times you can't pick and choose who you want to help the mind of Christ has no respect of persons amen that's right if you're favoring certain people in the church or listen to this or you're ignoring others in the church you won't be able to supply every joint and we just read we need to supply every joint we won't be able to effectually work in the measure of every part because that's what the scripture says if you're pulling favorites or you're ignoring some hey how can Christ use you to help the whole body God doesn't want us to just fitly join together with a few of our friends no sir he wants us to fitly join together with everyone that's a healthy body so I want to title this this morning caring or this this evening caring enough to add to the body caring enough to add to the body now that seems like a uh like a pretty almost like a a harsh statement because we all feel we care right but you just look back at how many times that you you stop caring about a situation and you had an excuse well what they said what they did what they didn't say what they didn't how they ignore me how they treated me and it'll all boil down to did we care enough to help the body we've got to care enough to be like-minded to have the same love to be of one mind one Accord we've got to care enough to not let anything be done through uh Strife for vain Glory we've got to care enough to actually get out of oursel and start esteeming others better than oursel BR and preached a message convinced and then concerned we have to be convinced that what we're what we read tonight our opening scripture these two verses that this subject that we're working on functioning as a healthy body we need to be convinced that this is God's will for our lives Because unless we're convinced of it we will never be concerned we'll never grow up in Him in all things we've got to say this is not brother John's desire for the church we've got to say we've got to find our position in the scriptures that this is what God wants for the body and this is what what this this teaching is is for now spiritual maturity how many feels you're spiritually mature all right this is the John Martin definition spiritual maturity is manifested when we trust God for our life and our focus is on edifying others in love amen that's true maturity we don't have to worry about ourselves God's going to take care of us we just got one job to do and that's edify the body amen Jesus said when thou art converted strengthen thy brother and he he told Peter that when thou are converted when there's a spirit spiritual maturity there then strengthen thy Brethren it's not about you Peter it's about the Brethren so what does the scripture tell us uh what what we should do when a brother is overtaken in a fault Galatians chapter 6 he which is spiritual spiritual maturity go to them in a spirit of meekness you can't turn it on and off like a switch by the way meekness is a part of the Holy Ghost right amen and so that word meekness if you look it up it means gentleness and humility so if we're going to help somebody we don't got to be we don't got to just know the scriptures we don't just tell them what's right or wrong we've got to have a certain type of spirit we've got to be gentle and it we've got to be humble we still have to deal with the problem but if you don't have those two ingredients it's probably going to backfire right sometimes we find ourselves correcting problems with a wrong Spirit instead of a spirit of meekness sometimes we're using a self-righteous Spirit maybe we're just arrogant or and proud and and we know that we're right and and and we think because we're speaking speaking the word that it's going to correct the problem but the thing is it's missing the love right amen sometimes we got a sharp tongue or using worldly wisdom or just depending on our knowledge of what's right and wrong we've been guilty of these things have we not now here's another thing how sometimes we we go about correcting a problem we simply avoid the situation altogether we just walk away wash our hands about it just don't deal with it that's not healthy that that's still a sar in the body and that's not how healthy body functions well wait a wait a minute brother John I got just look look if I say something I'm going to make the matter worse come on is that true how many times have we thought that how many I've heard that many times from a lot of people yes we don't want to make the matters worse I'm total for that but we're still a ways off from spiritual maturity there's no excuse not to get mature it just shows the condition that we don't know how to deal with it and I understand that you know I wasn't brought up by Christian parents I wasn't and I was certainly not brought up this is how you handle a problem just the opposite but I do believe that God in you teaches you how to be and we need faith that God will teach us the first thing that we need I'm tell when the children of Israel they came out of Egypt and God told them to go into the the promised land what what what did they fear they feared the Giants they did not think they could do what they were asked to do by God right okay so here we are in a church we're trying to learn to function with people that don't see things the way we see them that that that are that are that are odd that are different that that we're going to maybe we want to hurt them we don't want to offend them but you know the first thing we need is we need to believe that Christ in us can do it even if we don't know how we need to have faith that Christ in us will help us amen because to me this is you know to me it don't matter what you believe it don't matter what Revelation you got if Christ cannot live through your body and handle problems what good is it yeah that's what good is what good is what you have so it's not about what you know it's about what you live now if we always feel hesitant about trying to handle a problem when are we how will we ever mature right how how will we ever get to the place that we can handle something we've got to be able to to to to walk into a situation and do our very best and when we fail I learn from the Holy Ghost what to do next time but if we don't do that if we're always staying hesitant we're you know we're we're GNA you know we're going to let you know brother Ron do it or we're going to let brother Dennis handle it how will I be able to handle anything if God puts a situation in front of me I believe God in Me can can can take care of the problem right amen amen and I'm I'm okay I'm okay with getting help but I'm not okay with getting somebody else to take care of it there's a difference there is a difference another reason we don't want to deal with things is we're just simply afraid but the answer to that is the same love am perfect love casteth out all fear when you're so full of the love of God you're not scared about getting your hands dirty God's love is the answer to care enough to help the church body that is what we need more of the love of God Amen functioning as a healthy Church body requires spiritual Believers that are filled with the love of of God we just can't come into church somebody hurts us somebody offends us somebody does something wrong and we're all bothered about it and and and and and and we're okay being bothered about because we didn't do the wrong thing no what is required is for you to be filled with God's love because God's love has the answer amen God's love has the answer God isn't asking us to just barely get along with one another just tolerate one another just barely no he's asking us to be fitly joined together yes one mind one Accord one love amen his love my love don't do the job it's it has a limit it'll stop but God's love right will take care of all things he wants us to grow up in Him in all things all things not all things except this don't ever say I I I I can handle just about but I just can't handle don't say that believe that God wants to give you more love more wisdom am more leadership amen he wants to give you this experience he wants you to make increase of the situation bring some good resolution to bring some edification to this situation that just seems to be uh spoiled and we need a humble mind of Christ to do it spiritual maturity it requires getting our hands dirty when Jesus looked at his disciples he said you don't know you don't know what I just did by washing your feet but I'm cleaning your feet now Peter you know obviously being carnal didn't understand and without the grace of God I'd probably be in the same spot Lord wash me all over but he didn't need wash all over right but you do end up stepping into situations that are just dirty you end up making mistakes you end up falling short you end up stumbling you end up walking in areas you shouldn't walk amen and we are told by the Lord Jesus Christ to wash one another's feet amen that means to take time and help somebody that's having a a a a hard time spiritually spiritually because it's a spiritual position too much we focus on help me with this natural thing would you take any natural thing and there you can get to the spirit behind it you you you certainly can now when there's a problem if our goalto plan is to get upset or bothered or correct a person out of frustration or just default walk away we're simply not caring enough so this is this is really important for part three because if we don't get part three right we're not going to be able to do part four and part four is the actual functioning in a healthy way but if we don't have enough love behind it if we got all these excuses of why we're not going to move forward with it we're going to miss we need to shift our Focus to loving one another more to loving the whole body to edifying the whole body to care enough to help don't just saywell I'll care as long as they don't do this whatever it takes the love of God Has No Limit right it endures all things it believes all things it it's forever it's Eternal it doesn't stop it doesn't quit amen and that's why we need his love when we're trying to function with one another in the body of Christ spiritual maturity isn't just for you and your family Amen Brother John I didn't hear any amen so I wanted to say that you know it's about edifying the body of Christ in love you see we have a spiritual family here amen you know why would you care so much about your natural family and you didn't care about your spiritual family right we need to supply every joint in the spiritual family with what it needs so we got to turn our focus on what what do others need that's why I say it's a spiritual position it isn't somebody for who's who's not spiritual this is going to go over the top of their head this is going to be like I I'm not there yet we need to grow up that's what the scripture we read it today tonight we need to grow up in Him in all things don't pick and choose what you want let's just just say Lord you would not put anything on me that I couldn't bear just stay with the scriptures but with he'll make a way for us amen amen Lord if our focus is just on us and our family I'll say it like this it's wrong God has given us a body and we have a responsibility to to help God's body every single one of us it's a spiritual family when we ignore our responsibility you know what we're doing we're working iniquity his brother brandham simply taught us iniquity was not doing the things that you know you should be doing right wow just by simply ignoring helping one another is working iniquity think about this and Jesus said and because iniquity would abound the love of many shall wax cold the more and more you ignore doing the simple things that God has been asking you to do the more and more you're just going to be in love with yourself iniquity starts off with being selfish and ends up with losing love for others hate as we talked about is on a rise in the the world today we know that love is waxing cold yes but I want to say that that that Spirit out there in the world is having an effect on Church natural on Church natural and you know Church natural is inside of a building that's Church spiritual we know that so you see there's an intermingling of hate trying to come in through church natural but I'll tell you Church spiritual won't bite into it right no why because they are of another Spirit like Joshua and Caleb were they were of another Spirit it it's it's not a matter of of of of reasoning it's just it's not right to begin with we just don't hate one another we love one another regardless so when so many does something wrong we have a choice to make WEA carnally well that was wrong shouldn't have done it get upset murmur and even complain have you ever murmured and complained because somebody did something wrong well God has allowed that in the church but he doesn't allow allow the mistakes in the church for us to murmur and complain amen he allows them so we can react in a correct way you know if everything had to be perfect then we wouldn't need to be longsuffering patient forbearing one another right we wouldn't have to be patient because we'd be in a perfect church but there is no perfect Church the only thing that's perfect is the Believers who submit themselves to the word of God and do what God wants them to do then the perfect God Lives to them and manifest right so amen but you to get a group of Believers to do that perfectly it don't exist but what we can do is humble oursel and start pressing towards that Mark recognize our position amen so we can react in a more spiritual way pray for them am to recognize that there's a need there and and maybe since I see the need God's calling me to go help this person but I don't know what to say to them because you know that was like really rude what they did to me how about just go up to them and say I love you I just want to say a word of prayer with you we don't got to Di knows everything maybe we could just say hey look I maybe I offended you maybe I did something I'm sorry look we don't maybe see eye to eye but hey right now I want to see heart to heart I want I want Christ to be here amen I want to maintain the right spirit and I want to maintain his Spirit until he brings us into the truth of the situation right don't wait till you you know see everything perfect with somebody before you have the right spirit amen so if we want to function as better function better as a healthy body we need to care just like Jesus cares no different love one another more live for one another pray for one another lay down our lives lay down our pride lay down our self our arrogancy our self selfishness or hypocrisy and be clothed with humility this will help us when we're dealing with problems you know sometimes it's just be honest we're struggling to know what to do and I'm going to tell you why it's because the spirit that's on you is it of Christ I'll tell you the spirit that was on David didn't have it all all figured out you know he didn't have some vision of how he was going to take care of Goliath when he was back taking care of the sheep for his daddy he didn't even know what was happening what was going on who is this guy why is he acting this way against the church sometimes there's spirits that come and they attack but what we need is a faith to rise up in our hearts to start dealing with things instead of saying well that's not my business it's not mine okay okay okay it's not yours so you're part of the body of Christ but it's not your responsibility so you don't have to fitly join it you don't have to supply you don't have to edify in love you don't have to grow up in all things see see how crooked the devil gets and we we become scared about just caring about one another and look us that are older understand that those that are younger than us have much more years to live before they get our wisdom before they get our experience the older sisters are to teach the younger sisters that's right come on now I mean we're talking about learning how to function together us Brothers got to got to step in we need to come to church with a mind mindset of caring more for others just I'm coming to church for for others I'm just not used to this I'm barely making a church because I got I know I should be there no get rid of that I I I I I have a I have a position I have a post of Duty I have a I have a reason why I'm coming there and I want to help somebody amen love is the one ingredient that will edify every situation that one thing do you know the Bible says love love covers a multitude of sin amen you know love just doesn't cover your sin right it covers your sister's sin your brother's sin it covers everybody's yes and and it to me it's an honor that God would live through me to cover somebody else's sin that's an honor because I know some God has lived through somebody else to cover my sin come on you know the Bible says if we don't forgive one another he's not going to forgive us it's an honor to let God come through us and live a life of Love towards others not judging whether somebody's worthy of it or not worthy of it who is worthy no one's worthy of God's love no one's worthy of God Amen only time we might be thinking that somebody is worthy or unworthy is because we're sitting in the Judgment seat comparing them with ourselves yes the Bible says charity suffereth long this is why we need the love of God and is kind it envieth not it vaunteth not itself is not puffed up it doesn't behave itself unseemingly it seeketh not her own and it's not easily provoked and it does doesn't think evil if we just humble ourselves I'm sure we could find our we could find where we've missed a little bit in this scripture right here so when we have more of God's love we'll automatically be caring more about the body so I I'm thankful for the love that we have but how many wants more of God's love and then when that comes in when we invite it in we say God fill me with your love we would just automatically start caring more about others now God doesn't battle selfishness a amen amen okay because we want to keep going here God does not battle selfishness for God so loved the world that he gave amen he owns everything everything was made by him for him but you know he's not selfish Heaven is his throne Earth is his foot to what house will you build him he's a great God but he doesn't battle selfishness now one way to battle selfishness in our life is to be more thankful for what we have God does not need to go build some more things and some planets and some stars and to do all this stuff he already has everything yes and when we are thankful for what we have we won't battle selfishness the Bible says godliness with contentment is great gain yes and a Believer can become so grateful and so thankful for what they already have that they could actually live not feeling like they need anything else when you have when you're satisfied when you're content with what you have your life now is more open to be lived for others right Amen to help others Amen to care for others see selfishness it's a horrible thing yes horrible thing to me people who are selfish it's like they're not free from themselves and you and and when you when they get what they want it's not it's just a matter of time they're wanting more the the Bible says the eye is not satisfied with with seeing the ear with hearing am I no no let's see what I'm quoting this wrong but I do know this that the flesh is Never Satisfied am it just not it's always want more right and so we must just be more thankful the answer is just be more thankful be content with you be more thankful be grateful always praising God for what you have amen amen let our hearts be filled to the brim so much with gratitude that we just feel in debt to God more that's right be gratefully content turn with me if you would to First John chapter 3:1 16 we have to I want to at least get two more three more scriptures here be so in love with God that you want to give to his body you know you remember brother Brandon said this statement he saidif you ever want to do something for me do it for my children if you really want to do something for me do it for my children and I'll say like this if you want to do something for God do it for his children amen 1 John chapter 3:16 Says hereby perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren amen and this is just a natural thing but I want to read it for whosoever hath this world's good and seeth his brother have need and shutteth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but let's do it in deed and in truth amen amen be so filled with thankfulness that you're you're content you're content and now you you can spend your life trying to help other people don't get so busy that you can't help other people amen don't look on your your own things be so content that you don't have to look on your own things amen now you can start looking and trying to help somebody that isn't as spiritual as you are come on because to me I don't care if you got $1 or you got $10 million you can't be content but I'll say this it's harder to be content with 10 million the more money you got the harder it is because now you got more things that are that Satan can use to get you going away I'm telling you just godliness with contentment it's the great that's great yes all right Colossians chapter 3 Colossians chapter 3 verse number 12 put on therefore as the elect of God holy and beloved bows of Mercy okay so I know we're in the church this person hurt you this person Did You Wrong this person but now you as the elect of God than they may not be the elect of God but you as the elect of God holy and beloved put on bows of Mercy kindness humbleness of Mind meekness longsuffering forbearing one another forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do ye yes well they didn't say sorry yet that's not what the Bible says they may never say sorry you still have a responsibility I would not want anybody to miss Heaven because I didn't want to forgive them that's right that would be horrible yes and I don't want I don't want to be there before the Lord and the Lord said you know I'm not forgiving you of your sins because you didn't forgive ABCD of their sins that's right that's right so we're talking about functioning as a healthy body we're going to be put into uh situations to either be forbearing or snap come on Amen and and and and the life of Christ is going to follow these scriptures right the Life of Christ the Holy Ghost will follow these scriptures and and if we find ourself not following we just quickly Lord I'm sorry I this is what your word says I'm gonna I'm GNA do better I'm gonna make this thing right I'm going to get up and I'm going to Mar March forward if it happens seven times seven times I'm going to get up amen that's what the scripture tells me to do all right look at verse 14 and above all things put on love right which is the bond of perfectness amen and let the peace of God ruin your heart yes in other words don't be bothered about things that others are doing or have done or haven't done in the church don't don't let that thing be inside of you amen but God has peace peace I give unto you right Amen Let the Peace of God rule in other words it's champ it's champ it calls the shots to the which also you are called in one body called in one body well he's not listening she's not listening they hurt they offended they Tau behind my back they they they you know what God has not made you to judge that they are not of the body doesn't matter what they've done right we have been called to one body so we act like one body now just being honest with you God is good to the evil and to the good right and if you are the elect you will be good to the evil and to the good amen and and and and if you're not you're going to sit there and try to be the judge who isn't who isn't but we've been called to one body and look at this and be ye thankful and be ye thankful we have so much to be thankful about and let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom let's stand together let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom teaching and AD admonishing one another in Psalms there it is scripture we need to teach and admonish one another Psalms hymns spiritual songs singing with Grace in your heart to the Lord and whatsoever you do in worded D do all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the lord Jesus giving thanks to God and the father by him amen amen wonderful scriptures am amen we're recognizing and we're actively stepping into our position we're coming to church with more love we're coming to church with more concern we're being reminded our pastor is telling us hopefully we're hearing little bits when we're listening to the message and listen to other ministers that God is calling us up higher and in in part four by the by the grace of God we're going to be talking about putting into practice these things we're going to be having examples of how we function with one another amen amen let's sing people need the Lord we

Dreams God is is the answer to every hardship to every heartache to every problem he is the open door this morning we stand here as his wife those that are perhaps watching through the live stream where the archive of your head is bowed and God has spoken to you God wants to use us God wants to work through us to help one another not just not just outside for people that that don't know the Lord at all but maybe right here inside the church where people don't know the Lord as much as you do say won't you let God just work through you if that's your desire you don't have to lift your hand but just lift up that prayer before him Lord just use me use me to help someone in this body use me Lord when things are crashing down when my brothers and my sisters are going through Lord a a hardship Lord use me to lead them directly to you work through my life Lord work through my mind let me have the the Same Love Lord that you have and let me spread that love to them let me have their

we March forward Lord From This Day Forward even coming into this this new year that's before us Lord I pray that we'd be more determined to live for others than ever before in a world that's that's going in the opposite direction that's that hate is rising Lord may you just fill us so full of your spirit of your love that Lord we'll be representatives in this dark hour that you are still alive you're the same yesterday today and forever you still have a people on the planet that love uh the unlovable that that that can can lay down their lives just as you laid down your life for the world

way that we would grow up in in other things that we haven't grown up in oh Lord we thank you now we
