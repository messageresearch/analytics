we've got to set aside everything that isn't Christ he's the only thing that is the common denominator for all of us amen because we may not like the same pie all right but we do love Jesus amen God bless you this morning turn with me if you would to the book of First Corinthians chapter 15. a brother Gideon once again sends his greetings to each and every one of you in someday Lord willing we would like to have him with us amen once again amen First Corinthians chapter 15 and we're going to be we'd like to entitle this message standing on top of our problems and for a subject positionally placed positioning place so good to see sister Bertha with us been a long time and we're just grateful that she could be here today amen before we begin reading in verse 25 let's look to the author of this great word Heavenly Father we are unworthy Lord to even look upon this word it's it's holy it's pure it's it's you've kept it from man it was your anointing that moved upon holy men of old as they wrote your word Lord and you stand behind this word and today Lord we're approaching you humbly asking that you would bless our eyes to see our ears to hear and our hearts to receive the engrafted word today Lord we ask that you would forgive us and cleanse us from anything that would hinder that from happening you just take away all doubts from Lord and just bless the the sanctuary now with your great presence in the opening of the word father we thank you for the time of worship that we've had that we could express ourselves and worship you in spirit and in truth and now Lord we're Desiring to receive the Living Word into our our bosom and father unless you would come and break it to us Lord Lord it'll come short so we're leaning upon you and trusting you for each need now Lord we commit the service now to your hands for your honor and Glory we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen First Corinthians chapter 15 starting with verse 25 he must reign till he have put all enemies under his feet amen amen The Last Enemy shall be destroyed is death amen for we have put all things under his feet but when he saith all things are put under him it is Manifest that he is accepted which did put all things under him and when all things shall be subdued unto him then shall the son also himself be subject unto him that put all things under him that God may be all in all amen God bless you may be seated Jesus said I have power to lay down my life and I have power to pick it up again in other words he said I am the resurrection and the life he had a power and we all want power to fix our problems we want Power when the Devils bothering us in our minds and we just can't seem to get the Victory and so we're all searching for that power and I believe the answer to standing on top of our problems is to get positionally placed in Christ amen which is to get underneath his word that's where you have true power over the enemy Jesus said in John chapter 10 verse 17 therefore doth my father love me because I lay down my life that I may take it up again he says no man I taketh it from me but I lay it down of myself I have power to lay it down and I have power to take it up again this commandment have I received of my father amen Jesus loves us when we lay down our life amen and it is the hardest thing to do is to lay down her life but we're always searching for a power that can fix our problems right and I believe God is hidden Simplicity amen I believe the answer to Victory is to empty out of ourself and to come under subjection to God Jesus said in Matthew 28 18 He said all power is given unto me in heaven and in Earth and he in Luke chapter 9 I'm just laying a foundation here he gave that power to his disciples some power to his disciples in Luke 9 1 then Jesus called his 12 disciples together and gave them power and authority over all devils and to cure diseases and he sent them to preach the kingdom of God and to heal the sick so here Jesus has power he has power to lay on his life he has power to raise it again and he gives this he gives a power a portion of that power now to his disciples isn't that beautiful amen amen and uh how many is a disciple of Christ today amen amen I mean I believe that we that God has given us power he's given us a force he's given us Authority which to me is a privilege if you look up that word Authority it means privilege what a privilege we have that we can use the name of Jesus Christ amen in our lives to benefit Our Lives now brother Branham said that Judas was among them who received this power and this authority to have dominion over the enemy and if God would do that for Judas how much more would he do it for you me amen now we can have power and get out of position with God and and Judas did that and brother Brandon said that power without character or satanic and and Satan himself Lucifer he had a a power God had given him a power but he he took that power and he used it for himself at any time we take something that God has given us and we're not trying to point people to Christ you understand that that is the wrong way to use the power that God has given you because God has created all things for his glory now we all need to be in our spiritual position too many Believers are out of their position amen that's the truth Amen brother Brandon said preaching attracts The Sinner and it's it's just you know preaching is really more enjoyable than teaching but brother Brown said that teaching places us in position with Christ places Us in the body so what is our position what is our place what is our our ranking if if we look at the word sanctification we are taught by the prophet that it is a cleansing it's a washing and it sets us aside for the service of God so it actually places us in a position to be used by God and Jesus has given us power and he's given us Authority but are we in our spiritual position brother random I got a few quotes here if I could read this one is in the position of a believer in Christ brother Branham says and the tree is planted in Christ Jesus the unexhaustible Fountain of Life and in everything that a Believer has to do after he's placed in Christ Jesus everything he has need of in this Earthly journey is given to him when he is placed in Christ now how important it is to be in position amen that's right and all he has to do is drink and drink and push out and drink to every fruit of the spirit every gift of the spirit everything that's in Christ Jesus that belongs to you will be in you for the entire Journey wow Brandon said in the message Jehovah Jireh he says and them baptized by the Holy Ghost into the Church of the Living God and positionally placed into the body as a position to work with the members of the body of Christ so when we get in position with Christ we are actually working together with one another amen so you know it just kind of stuffs out you know the thought process of of coming to church being a part of a church but not working together you're not really in in position uh when you're not working with the members of the body of Christ there has to be a working together message India trip report brother Brandon said when God has positionally placed you stay there amen and be loyal to that word as you know how to be and God will bless it Amen in the message hear ye him Brothers says oh I wish I had the ability to grind that into the people's heart God is looking for time tested Christians amen every son that cometh to God must be tried child trained tested and you who jump from Pillar To Post and this to that and in and out how can God ever adopt you into his family or positionally place you right right now think of that for a moment he said how can you be positionally placed when you won't stand still long enough for God to do it I believe as we come to church and we hear the word this word is what is is God is speaking to us to positionally place us but if we just ignore we we do what we want to do we take what we want we kind of make it a smorgasbord because we're just too busy they were not standing still long enough to get serious with the word you remember the Centurion we all remember the ceterian he was positionally placed he was clothed with humility he felt Unworthy of God's authority to come underneath his roof think about that I wonder how many times we go home and we feel unworthy to take the word that God just gave us at church I mean he was in his position he understood rank and that the word of God was the final absolute Jesus said the word that I've spoken shall judge you in the last day it is the final absolute Matthew chapter 8 verse 8. let's look at this Matthew 8 verse 8 the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that thou should come under my roof but just speak the word only that's all that's needed it just speak the word only and my servant shall be healed he says for I am a man under Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and he goeth and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and and he doeth it and when Jesus heard it he marveled and said unto them that followed those that were around him verily I say unto you I have not found so great of Faith No not in Israel it takes great faith to know your position and to remain in your position it takes Faith to do that you're no match for the devil brother Brian son the principles of Divine Healing he says the word of God will defeat the Devil any place anywhere anytime or on any condition the word of God is what defeats the devil not us that's why we have to get into our place and that Centurion knew his place amen maybe you have children under you maybe you tell them what to do and they do it maybe you tell them what they're doing they don't do it maybe have a wife maybe you have workers under your Authority at work the word has authority over the devil not you you're no match for the devil but God gives us authority over the devil when we are under the word can't separate them a man is only as good as his name we heard a little bit about that last service his name is Jesus his name is good in my name you'll cast out devils you're only as good as your word and Jesus's word is so good that even the Devils have to come under subjection to it and they don't want to amen Jesus said they shall take up serpents they shall drink deadly uh if they drink any day anything it shall not hurt them they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover all in the name of Jesus his name is a high tower the righteous could run into it the name of Jesus is our security but the question is are we under that name are we under that name or do we just use that name because we know the people in the world they use that name in vain even Jesus said in vain do they worship me in vain they worship me so to be to worship God correctly and I don't have the quote right now but I do got it back in my office that you can only worship God correctly when you're in your position and he's Jesus said that you they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth so God is looking for us to take our positions not just over the devil but under his word we can't halfway get into our position right amen I mean just using the word to benefit Our Lives but not using the word to please God in all things the only thing that's above the devil is God we need to remember that brother Brandon said in the message going beyond the camp he said when God fortified his church in the Garden of Eden his people they had one wall to stand behind and that was the word they had one Shield one armor one thing because God known what would defeat the Devil and that's the word and that's why we have to get underneath the word because the word is our protection or behind the word as brother Brandon is saying here when we take our position over the devil we want to rebuke him and we want to tell them to get out and not be subject to God's word we're trying to lift ourselves up above both the devil and God wow truth the truth and that and God that's where God draws the line it's true amen amen God is looking for us to take our position of laying down our lies first give me some scriptures brother John humble yourself under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you in due time submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you notice the order here be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and gives grace to the humble so we got to take our position under the word under the mighty hand of God Amen and God will take care of our problems amen now just as a centurion since uh the Centurion knew his place we've got to know our place we've got to be in our place of God's Great spiritual body and it's our own personal responsibility to make sure that we remain in that place we just can't you know come in on Sundays we got to remain in our place which is under the word in First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 1 we know that uh turn with me if or just write it down every every man has a head and I just want to bring this scripture Paul is saying be followers are me even as I also am of Christ so he's telling stay in your position get behind me because I know that what I'm preaching is the truth if an angel from heaven comes preaching any other gospel than what I've ordered even if I preach something different he's let him be a curse so we have the gospel it was given by Paul be followers of me even as I am of Christ remember when brother Branham had that that vision and he saw the bride in this age get out of line and then he screamed get back in position get back in line is really what he said but get in position and so when we got a five-fold Ministry and when they're yielded to the Lord they will scream out this message and if we're true blue and we want to please God we will get back in line with the word of God yes every time verse two now I Praise You Brethren that ye remember me in all things and keep the ordinances now you remember this and keep the ordinances as I've delivered them to you but I would have you to know that the head of every man is Christ and the head of the woman is the man in the head of Christ is God so you have God you have Christ you have man you have the uh the woman under the man now there's positions Every Man Has a headship and of course Christ is the head of every man but he has placed a spiritual leadership over us and that is a pastor amen now for you that did not say Amen to that I know some things are hard to accept but there's a reason for it brother Brian said that man is the man that God has ordained to lead us through we certainly don't want to be without the man that is ordained to lead us through we need to find a scripture that says uh God has ordained me to lead me through and and then you can have confidence not being under that headship uh it's I hope it's okay that I'm preaching this to me there's a reason that God gave us headship amen amen and here's the reason it's not too usurp authority over anybody right but God is not the author of confusion that God works because look I can go through on to a number of people and get a number of different opinions about something and then all they got to do is pick what I want whatever appeals to me whatever I think but it's not going to be Christ because that's not how God operates God has offices and we must remain under the office that he's placed us in and God will use that office somehow some way to meet the need that you have amen he will direct you have you ever wondered why God has given us a pastor I mean I I've said this years ago but you know a pastor really isn't a financial institute he's not the handyman that fixes all the problems I asked someone one time what they thought headship was the purpose of headship not a pastor but headship and they said to protect or comfort or Shield them and I thought well you know there's truth to that but that's only part of it that's missing something it carries a greater meaning than that headshep also means leadership for our lives Ephesians chapter 5 verse 22 and I just we're talking about positions right we're talking about being positioned there's certain things that we we must get in position with it says wife submit yourselves to your own husband as unto the Lord Brother John are you read that because you're having a problem with your wife right now no I'm not things couldn't be better right now between me and her for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he is the savior of the body so showing us position I looked up that word head you know what it means the husband is the head of the wife when I looked up that word head if you look it up there's just one word that it means you know what it means head means head in other words the wife is not she doesn't do the thinking the church doesn't do the thinking the church doesn't call the the shots Christ is the head of the church it is his mind his thinking his direction for us he is the head period that's all there is to it therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wise be to their own husbands and everything now this is so so mightily important I remember the prophet I don't got the quote here but I remember the prophet saying that you wives need to be subject to their husbands even if they're wrong wow that's true why because God doesn't want you to get out of position and there's no excuse for it because we all day could say well I think you're wrong I don't agree with you I think you're wrong God's not going to honor that so God will honor your place God will correct your head he will the church may say the church must stay subject to the word it must it must reverence the word it must obey the word amen now as we near the end more and more people feel they don't need a pastor they're staying home they don't need headship they kind of keep their distance from the pastor they they don't like being told what to do but God will hold every person accountable to their head and a good example of that is Jezebel brother bran said that Elijah was Jezebel's pastor now she didn't go to church she didn't come under subjection but she was still held accountable by God that's right now the pastor cannot give you a revelation of who your pastor is only God can show you who your head is if you don't have a head or you don't want a head then you're basically headless and will become Lawless in some way I want to give you some scriptures to help to help us make sure that we're positionally placed because God uses the office of a pastor to lead us amen Hebrews chapter 13 Hebrews chapter 13 verse 17 if you want to write it down now he doesn't just use it from the pulpit right the offices of a pastor let me just say this Saints am I your pastor only when I'm behind the pulpit no no am I your pastor just Wednesdays and Sundays am I your pastor when I'm on vacation okay pastor's pastor Pastor is a is an office it's a position it's a place so God can use that in any conversation at any time amen all right Hebrews 13 verse 17 obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourself notice get in position for they watch for your souls now we find out the real the real purpose here is for the soul it's not all the other things it's for the soul now it doesn't mean he can't help it the other things but there's a watching over the soul and if we get the spirit or the attitude that I don't need help over my soul because I already gave it to Christ you're really missing your relationship with God as they must give an account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you can you say Amen to that all right Romans Chapter 13 Verse number one Romans 13 Verse 1 let every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be ordained of God let every soul be subject unto the higher Powers whosoever therefore resists the power resisteth the ordinance of God now remember Paul said keep the ordinances and they that resist shall receive to themselves a damnation for the rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil will thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shall have Praise of the same for he is the Minister of God to thee for good but if thou do that which is evil be afraid he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the Minister of God a Revenger to execute wrath upon them that doeth evil wherefore ye must needs be subject not only to not only for wrath but also for conscious sake and for this cause payee tribute also for they are God's ministers attending continually upon this very thing and render therefore to all their dues tribute to Tribute is due custom to whom custom feared unto whom fear honor to whom honor oh no man nothing but love one another for he that loveth another have fulfilled the law it kind of you know we're living in these perilous times and Paul told Timothy that one of the great uh things that you would find in the church is unthankfulness and people are just basically more in love with themselves people don't feel like they owe anybody anything it's kind of like every man from himself now I just say one way to help you to remain thankful is just pray for your head amen pray for your head pray pray for your pastor not that he'll just you know bless us with a in more of an enjoyable service but pray for him it was the very camels that Rebecca water that carried her to her destination amen but if you just use the church for what you can get out of it see God sees right through that thing how how is God ever going to honor that we find today that more and more people are forsaking going to church the assembling of themselves together they got their reasons but you know you can't find any scriptural ones I'm so glad that God sent a Prophet by and said well if you can't get to a church that can get a whole loaf get to a church where you can at least get a slice of bread amen he showed us the importance of staying in church so when a person forsakes going to church they're getting more and more out of their position with God brother Brown says that every Christian should have a home church that he belongs to right and he said to become a good member there amen find a home Church and become a good member we're going to be talking a little bit about members when a Believer is positionally placed in Christ they will undoubtedly support from their position but if you're not in position you're not going to support are you with me 's enjoying this amen praise the Lord I got some quotes here four different messages brother Brandon first one I greater than Solomon is here brother Brandon says that's right support your pastor support your church support the cause that stands for the right thing that's right if it's right I owe something to it that's the way we should feel if this be of God not only our money our money is little but we owe him our hearts our time amen time amen amen our talents and everything we have we owe it to God if it's right let's go into it with everything we got if it isn't right go find what's right then get into it amen you're not allowed to go anywhere without getting into it that's that's what he's saying in God manifesting his gifts brother Brian said if Christian religion is right it's worth everything that you can do for it support your church support your pastor support your missionaries do everything that's in your power to do and give God the best you got [Music] I think we all of us have more than just showing up the church to hear the word I think we all got more than that don't you in the message God's provided away brother Brian says go to church every day that they have service go attend your church be real loyal amen amen just stand by your church stand by your pastor help them out with everything you've got give them spiritual support fast and pray for him and have faith in him and God will lead the church aunt to that glorious day that we're looking forward to come in the message why brother Graham says I believe that every person should join the church I absolutely I absolutely believe that every person should stand at their post of Duty and when they're pastors they're preaching or an evangelist or something I think they ought to stand at their post of Duty they ought to support that church with everything they got in them with their ties with their offerings with anything that they that they're called on to do now we're talking about being called unto do he said be willing and be happy if your pastor asks you to do something in your church you should do it not only be willing but be you got to do with a smile good quotes good quotes he's he's positionally placing us amen now we have message Believers today that ignore their position in the church and yet struggling with their problems they take on a an attitude that isn't doesn't line up with these quotes or what the word has said I don't need to listen to that I'm already baptized in Christ then give you scripture for by one Spirit we're all baptized into the body that's a good that's a good scripture and that's the truth but brother Brian says when you're become baptized with the Holy Ghost you become positionally placed in the body of Christ and in the message this great warrior David he said positionally placed here on the Earth for a purpose to do the will of God isn't that precious I mean to me I love these teachings this helps us this places us the very holy spirit that baptizes us into the body will positionally place us see we still need a church in the message the voice of the sign brother Brandon says we believe that every Christian ought to have a home church that they go to every Christian ought to meet somewhere with believers another place he said that they ought to be in church every time the doors are open so every person needs a church and they need a pastor where they can come under the authority of the word and it be the absolute for their life because look outside of the trueness of this message people are looking for Fellowship Halls they're looking for a place they can come either enjoyment be entertained and feel good when they leave get pumped up be feel good about their lives and they're missing Holy Ghost leadership so we need a place that we can come under authority to whatever that word says it's the way that God has ordained it to be just pushing play at home won't work God won't respect that God has given us a five-fold Ministry to get us out of here and if we don't we don't follow his way we try climbing up some other way you you can't just look it you'd be absolutely wrong just to listen to me you'd be absolutely wrong and I'll say it like this you couldn't make it by just listening to me and I'll be honest with you I couldn't be who I am without the prophet amen and I couldn't be who I am without sitting under other pastors so we need the whole five-fold Ministry amen no God has given us headship not only for comfort and protection but also Direction for our lives God is not the author of confusion and I'll say it like this headship eliminates confusion headship eliminates confusion remember that this word eliminates confusion you know if our idea isn't lining up with something in the word brother Brandon says go back read it because this word needs our ideas need to dovetail with this word from cover to cover from Genesis to Revelations so to be positionally placed brother Brandon said we must be at our pulse of Duty we are not going to be at our pulse of Duty if we're not a member of the church so if you're a member of the church you got to be at your post to duty there's just there's so much Spirits out there that I don't have to come to church and we just don't we don't want that Spirit to get on us because it's not right what constitutes us as being a member of this church now we know everybody's welcomed here but what makes you a member here anybody got any ideas it's awful quiet can I tell you what makes you a member here it was the same thing that made somebody a member in brother branham's Church I figured I'd go with that what's the best thing I know brother Brian said the message church or he says we are responsible for our own our own and now he's going to Define what's on what our own is he said that's steady constant members of the Tabernacle that come here and worship with us we are Duty bound to them as our brothers and sisters who have proven to be our members of this Gathering so we got a little a little clue here it's not everything but we got a little clue it's constant members steady constant members amen amen and they have to they have to prove two things were required to be a member at brother randoms Tabernacle at Brandon Tabernacle on the placings of deacons brother Brandon said and the church are those who come and support the church with their presence with their ties and their offerings amen every member of this church that comes here regularly and supports it with your tithes and offerings which is which is considered and I'm quoting a member of this church it it's pretty clear-cut so you can go to church never pay your tithes and you're really not a member you can come to church pay your tithes don't come here regularly and you're really not a member right it goes both ways you got to have both amen amen I looked at that word regular it means arranged in a constant or defined pattern especially with the same space between interval incidences Wednesday Sunday Wednesday Sunday Wednesday Sunday I think that's sane don't you systematic or well ordered another way is faithful all right another way to define it is faithful a person that didn't attend church regularly or didn't support the church with their tithes and offerings were not even allowed to vote about church matters in brother branham's Church weren't even allowed to and if I remember correctly when I went to Brother Johnson's Church you had to be going there two years um not only going there two years you had to be faithful for two years because a lot of times people come in slow and they don't even get on track of paying their ties or get on track or coming Faithfully but you got to be doing that thing for two years and that doesn't mean that you did it you know six months last year and stop doing it that don't work now I want us to really take inventory are we in our position and I know you know you all here you're you're all in your position you're here okay I I I told one brother I said I don't even know who pays tithes it's none of my business it is God's business and it is my business to get across the importance of paying your ties I will say we've in our men's meeting someone brought up tithe pain and I don't know who it was it doesn't matter but uh uh it was concluded that you know we need to talk about tide paying next men's meeting because it's an important issue amen all right Hebrews chapter 7. he says you see what a strict thing it is to pay tithes tithing is right every Christian is Duty bound to pay tie he said that's right that's never changed Redemption by judgment Brethren said in his prayer Our Kind Heavenly Father thou has taught us in the word that let every man lay aside that which God has prospered him and when the first that when the first day of the week when he when we come together that we should bring in our tithes and our offerings into the place your house and the message my life story brother Brian says I worked and I paid my tithes right at the church I believe in paying tithes and God has blessed blessed it to me many millions of times what a testimony in the message the pilgr the pergamon church age God bless our brother here I I you're not a member of our church but you're hearing if you ever wanted to be what we believe in but this is not to you you know this is not to you but if it if it if it's uh bearing witness in your heart just you know praise the Lord amen but I just want to know we're not preaching to you okay okay um the pergament church age if people were taught to pay their tithes that would be all there would be they would all uh would be to it that's God's plan but God but God has a plan but man wants to make his own plan hi breading God's plan right your ties belong to God they are to be brought to the into the storehouse of the church that feeds you that you attend to the pastor that God has given you what your pastor does with it now that's his business now there are pastors out there that take that money and they they don't use it the way God wants them to use it I'll just say it like that that's why it's important to get a revelation of your pastor because if you if if if a man is taking money and he's just using it on himself to get more Cadillacs and more gold chains and more houses and whatever he's doing with it then it's kind of hard to have confidence to stand behind that Pastor and support him okay Malachi chapter 3 verse 6 for I am the Lord I change not therefore ye sons of Jacob are not consumed even from the days of your father's you're gone away from my ordinance so here's the statement now you've gone away from my ordinances remember Paul said keep my ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and I will return unto you notice get underneath the word and I will support you amen right return unto me get in your place and I will return unto you saith the Lord of hosts but ye said wherein shall we return people don't even realize when they leave God right right well a man rob God yet you have robbed me but you say wherein if you rub wherein have we robbed thee Lord and he says in ties and in offerings and because that you you you stole from me you're cursed you're cursed you don't even know it you're cursed with a curse for you rob me even this whole nation see when we don't submit ourselves under the mighty hand of God's word we can be cursed and if we're cursed with a curse then how are we going to have authority over the devil amen how are we going to get all of our other problems underneath our feet are we just going to preach a gospel that just says use the name of Jesus and do this and take care of this and you don't got to listen to him and forget about coming under subjection to the word of God the only thing that's stronger than the devil is God and God requires us to have submission to the word so part of the equation of putting your problems underneath your feet is getting under all of God's word amen verse 10 bring ye all your tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now we're with saith the Lord of hosts if I will not open you personally the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that you that there shall not be room enough to receive it he promised to do exceedly above all that we would ask or even think and now he's given us a promise that you can't even you don't even have room enough to receive it and I will say this anybody that's been faithful paying their tithes because we all started out at least I did I started out with nothing and I'll never forget as long as I live being in brother Johnson's Church one time they took up a little offering for me the only offering that I've ever accepted in my life because I didn't have nothing I didn't have a job I just came in I didn't understand what was going on I just knew the love of God was in this place God was in this place and I didn't have work I didn't have a job they took up I'll never forget it as long as I live but since that time in my life it has been a multitude of I cannot hold I can't I don't have room for this blessing and God had to provide so I'd have room and then I'd go on and then there would be more and I couldn't take it I couldn't take and there was just kept happening and multiplying and increasing to my life put God first you can't out give God doesn't get to a place and say okay you know what you've given so much now i that's enough I can't give you any more you keep giving and he'll keep giving we serve an endless God when you are positionally placed under the authority of the word then you have all the word on your side and that's what we want yeah I just this just came to me and I God helped me to get through everything I want to get through today but I remember one time I I believe brother Brandon had a dream or a vision or somebody did and I I believe it was brother Branham and there you know he was trying to take care of this one problem get it under his feet and he had a dream of this black mamba snake and for some reason you know it was the most deadliest snake and he just he just couldn't take care of it and God spoke to him and told him that he needed to be more sincere now think about what take takes care of this worst snake in the whole world was just more sincerity with God come under subjection to more of the word amen amen amen and God will take care of of whatever problem we might have all right when we tried to take our position over the devil and not come under subjection to the word we can't have perfect faith because we know we're not we're not under some ordinance we're not we're not we're not doing what God wants us to do it's like trying to lift ourselves up above the devil which we want but we're also doing it above God and the message be not afraid brother Adam says you can never serve God correctly till you get every little thing out of the way where you can stand free and I'll say it like this God knows the things that are standing in the way between us and him and I'm so grateful that God takes care of us I tell you he takes care of things that we can't even take care of because he wants to see us free if there's anything in your way in your way hindering you you just can't do it because that thing Rises up in front of you all the time see and so be honest truthful serve God with all your heart laying aside every sin that easily beset you that you might run with patience the race that's set before you look into the Altar and the finisher of our faith the Lord Jesus Christ God is looking for us to take our position of laying down our life [Music] lay down your life Jesus said in Luke 9 he says if any man come after me let him deny himself take up his cross and follow me notice the first thing in getting in a position with Christ is lay down your life lay down your will the second thing is obey the word pick up your cross whatever God tells you to do pick it up and carry it then and only then can we follow Christ in our position remember the man who was using the name of Jesus to profit his life and his reputation there in the book of Acts he was using the name of Jesus to cast out demons but he his mold of it was just about his reputation and for his own personal life and the demons spoke out and said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you in other words I know the authority of Jesus and I tremble at it I know the authority of Paul who was submitted or Sub in submissioned to Jesus and I tremble at it but I don't recognize your Authority in other words you're not over me you're still underneath me I only bow before Jesus I'm going to tear your life apart he wasn't in position and we we must make sure that we're in our right position underneath the word of God so I say to the church humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt you above your problems in due time submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you remember submit yourself first be clothed with humility for God resisteth the proud and giveth grace to the humble make sure you have power to lay down your life before you try taking power to rise it up against an enemy I mean if you've got a demon that's bothering you better tell him to get out amen you got a demon in your home you got a demon yeah yes use the name of Jesus but I'm telling you if you want to go anywhere with God you you want to make sure that your life is submitted to all the word and that you're you're looking God what would you have me to do you're working out your salvation with fear and tremble God what would you hand me to do just speak to me your word and be looking for it because if you're going to follow Jesus from afar you're not going to get very far when we come under subjection to God then God will give us the grace that we need he'll exalt us over our problems and we can get rid of the devil that's bothering us when we are positionally placed amen I believe when we're positioning placed we'll live for others we'll love others just like Christ loved amen amen and will be steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the Lord now that's positionally placed not any time we can get out of our place and think about it when you're out of your place you're out of the protection of the Holy Ghost [Music] now look at the laodicea church age they were more at a position than any other Church she was the most deceived and she got out of her position because she was deceived and she she wanted she was looking for the easier path she thought she was in need of nothing she didn't know that she was miserable naked and blind she she had to get now here was what she had to do to get right she had to get under the anointing of God to see straight thank you in other words it's still your responsibility to get into the spirit and it's not a Feeling I'm not saying God won't bless us with a who following presence here but there's more that God expects out of us than to get blessed because of an atmosphere she had to repent to get into the right position with Christ be zelious and repent she needed deity and that was the only thing that can overcome the devil amen Christ is the only thing that can over and when we recognize didn't didn't isn't there some quote and maybe Brother Bruce knows this or brother Ferguson but when the the bride knows who she is the Rapture will take place we got to know our position all right in the message Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever brother Brian says and let me say this now that the word of God will defeat the Devil anywhere anytime or any place amen amen he will defeat the Devil and he said the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass amen amen so if you can look at it the way God wrote it and accept it in your heart God will make the word become life hmm you know something just came to me and if I could I just want to go there I think it's first John first John okay um and and I don't know and I'm so sorry I don't know where it is but the scripture talks about that God is greater than our conscience he is able to speak to us whatever is not in its place so in order for me to have the right mental attitude I've got to be concerned about the things that God wants me to take care of remember we're in a relationship with Christ this is all about a relationship this is not about us of how we can attain to be super duper full of Faith just you know constantly have this great ability no we're just human beings Sons and Daughters of God that are building a relationship with Christ putting on character getting ready for the Rapture so in this process of us manifesting the word there's things that God wants us to come under subjection to and so if they're like like I remember a time in my life that I was listening to worldly music I had long hair I mean I I you you name it I was in the world and when God began to deal with me with those things he was not just pulling me out of the world but he was he was positionally placing me I couldn't remain in that condition and just say well I've been baptized I'm a Christian now and so so God is continuously bringing us more into position in the message convinced and concerned we're wrapping it up here he said that's right and God and the god that could defeat the Devil in my life Brother Brad I'm saying and pour into me the baptism of the Holy Ghost can slay that uncircumcised devil out there that's trying to defy the armies of the Living God that's one way to help somebody is get the devil out of your life amen let's Stand Together if you all want the benefits of Christ Place yourself underneath all of his word place your problems under his feet Place yourself underneath his word when we're positioning placed in the word then we can stand on top of our problems I remember a story I used to tell lots of stories and I hardly don't tell them anymore and I'm sorry about that but there was a story one time about this donkey and this donkey he was just kind of old and he wasn't very useful much anymore but he was still a donkey he was still alive but he got tripped up and he fell into this well it was kind of a deep well and when the owner of the donkeys went out there because he heard this yapping and yelling and oinking and whatever they do whatever sound they make from the bottom of that well coming up he recognized that his donkey was down there and instead of trying to help the donkey get out because he'd been faithful to him all those years he just thought well you know he's just no use to us anymore we mouths were just bury him there and so this man went back to his barn he got the shovel out and he's just started putting shovel shoveling the dirt into the well to cover up the Donkey and this donkey had a choice at that moment is he going to let these problems bury him or is he going to have a right mental attitude is he going to observe these line vanities and forsake his own Mercy but you know what he did with each shovelful that went down inside of that well and hit his back he just shook it off and he stood on top and that guy who his owner who really just didn't care about him anymore thought he was going to bury him was surprised that eventually he started rising up and went out of the well and just said thank you and I'll tell you it doesn't matter if anybody's not helping you or not it's you and God that's a majority and if you just have the right attitude God will see you through it seems like often our trials are long and stretched out but you just got to keep shaking things off keep keep yourself in a position that God can use you and he will use you amen shake off discouragement shake off disappointment shake off everything that the devil throws at you amen let's say I know the Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord will make a way for me if I live a holy life shun the wrong and do the right I know the Lord will make a way amen let's sing that again I know the Lord will make a way for me know the Lord will make a way amen get in position now if I live a holy light shunned the wrong and do the right I know the Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord will make a way for me I'm counting on it I know the Lord Will Make A Way for we if I live a holy life know the Lord make a way for me I know the Lord has placed his hand on me I know the Lord Lord's laid his hand on me I know the lord has laid his hand on me [Music] I know the Lord is laid his hand on me I know the Lord is coming back for me I know the Lord for me if I spend my life in prayer I will meet him in the air I know the Lord is coming back for me do you believe that with all your heart amen
