[19:13] sister trish do you uh have an
[19:16] announcement
[19:19] do you want to come up
[19:21] from here okay
[19:22] so um first of all i just wanted to make
[19:24] some announcements about sunday school
[19:26] but before i do i just want to say how
[19:27] much of a blessing
[19:29] it has been for me to watch you know all
[19:31] these children come in and be excited
[19:34] about hearing about from the lord and to
[19:36] learn
[19:37] um and not only that it's been exciting
[19:39] for each of them you know to see it grow
[19:41] and to just blossom
[19:43] um
[19:44] so thank you thank you for the sacrifice
[19:46] your parents take to make sure they get
[19:48] to me on time and you know that they can
[19:50] be involved in that
[19:52] but i wanted to go over just kind of
[19:53] like the time frame of what sunday
[19:54] school is just to so everybody's on the
[19:57] same page sunday school does start at 9
[19:58] 15.
[20:00] it's very important because we're a very
[20:02] small room with lots of kids
[20:04] that we try to get there on time because
[20:06] when we have interruptions or you know
[20:08] kids coming in late or anything like
[20:10] that it does pause everything and then
[20:12] it's hard to get the kids back on track
[20:14] and have such a limited time with them
[20:16] it's very difficult
[20:18] i usually shut the door about 9 20 9 22.
[20:21] at that point we're fully into whatever
[20:23] lesson we're learning at that point i
[20:25] have asked the kids if the door is shut
[20:27] to just kind of stay with mom and dad
[20:29] because to start over
[20:31] it's very difficult to start back over
[20:33] and to actually get it completed in a
[20:35] lot of time
[20:36] the other thing i wanted to ask
[20:37] everybody is if we could be mindful
[20:39] about the last seven minutes before
[20:41] church starts is when i take all the
[20:43] kids to the restroom and i do that so
[20:45] that parents can be in service and they
[20:46] don't have to leave when the kids come
[20:48] in the kids are already taken care of
[20:50] but if we could kind of leave that open
[20:52] for them the last seven minutes before
[20:54] service starts so i can get them in and
[20:55] out in time would be greatly appreciated
[21:00] if there's an emergency and i know those
[21:01] things happen that you're going to be
[21:02] late there is an app in the telegram for
[21:05] that you can just communicate with me so
[21:07] i can hold back or kind of change things
[21:09] a little bit so they can still be
[21:10] involved
[21:13] and let's see what else i also put this
[21:15] sunday school script scripture each week
[21:17] in there so that they can work on those
[21:18] and i
[21:19] really just
[21:20] ask ask the kids what they're learning
[21:22] get them talking about it
[21:24] um
[21:25] it's a it's a great way to get them
[21:27] asking like it's supper what was your
[21:28] scripture what are you learning and it
[21:30] just could open up to a whole different
[21:32] kind of bible study to get where they're
[21:34] at their perspective
[21:37] many times in sunday school we'll be
[21:39] learning something but it's not till we
[21:40] come in here and the lord will speak
[21:42] something through the minister
[21:44] and it just clicks and they're like oh i
[21:46] get it
[21:47] and i know sometimes it doesn't seem
[21:49] important that they're there but it's so
[21:50] important for them it's so important for
[21:52] their perspective
[21:54] so i just encourage that sacrifice you
[21:56] won't you won't regret it
[21:59] so
[22:00] thank you and thank you guys for working
[22:01] hard on your scriptures and coming to
[22:03] sunday school i really appreciate it
[22:05] amen hallelujah
[22:08] amen thank you sister
[22:10] amen thank you for your sacrifice amen
[22:13] also i just wanted to mention our
[22:14] brother jason is battling some stomach
[22:16] issues

[22:20] uh roger has some unbespokens and if
[22:22] anybody else has them just lift him up

[34:33] our heavenly father
[34:36] we thank you for all the wonderful
[34:38] things that you've done for us
[34:41] in our life
[34:42] and today
[34:45] you've given us health and strength to
[34:46] be here
[34:48] lord when we think about something
[34:50] greater than that it was the desire you
[34:52] placed in our heart to be here
[34:54] we thank you for that desire we thank
[34:56] you that you haven't taken the way we
[34:58] we're thankful that you've protected us
[35:00] from the enemy who would try to just
[35:03] drown that out with the things of the
[35:05] world
[35:07] but lord we want to be together with our
[35:09] brothers and sisters and lord you
[35:11] promised to be where just two or three
[35:13] would be gathered together in your name
[35:15] you'd be right there in the midst and
[35:17] lord we don't see
[35:19] with our physical eyes and we don't
[35:21] always feel you with our our the
[35:23] feelings and of our flesh and our
[35:26] emotions but something on the inside
[35:31] lord knows that you're here because
[35:33] we believe in your word
[35:35] your word has never failed you promised
[35:38] that we're just two would be gathered
[35:40] together in your name you'd be there in
[35:42] the midst lord we we're your believing
[35:44] children we believe it today
[35:46] and father as we enter into this
[35:48] precious part of the service
[35:52] the reading of the word and the the
[35:54] ministering of the word and the the
[35:55] receiving the hearing and receiving the
[35:58] word we just pray that you would anoint
[35:59] it all
[36:01] lord we know your word is already
[36:02] anointed but
[36:04] lord we want that same anointing to be
[36:06] on us that was on the word when it was
[36:08] written
[36:09] that you'd give us the revelation of the
[36:12] word let us leave here
[36:14] more in love with you than when we came
[36:17] and commit all this to you now with all
[36:19] the needs that would be in our midst we
[36:21] love you in the precious name of jesus
[36:23] christ
[36:24] amen amen saint john chapter 15 verse
[36:29] number 9 and 10
[36:32] as the father have loved me
[36:34] so have i loved you
[36:36] continue
[36:37] in my love
[36:40] and if you keep my commandments
[36:43] you shall abide in my love even as i
[36:45] kept
[36:46] my father's commandments and abide in
[36:49] his love
[36:50] and then in
[36:52] first peter chapter five just one verse
[36:54] verse number five
[36:56] likewise ye younger
[36:58] submit yourselves
[37:00] unto the elder yea all of you be subject
[37:03] one to another
[37:05] and be clothed with humility for god
[37:07] resisted the proud
[37:09] and giveth grace
[37:11] to the humble
[37:13] amen god bless you may be seated
[37:18] i want to say it's certainly
[37:21] good to see brother jonathan sister
[37:23] gabriel
[37:25] back with us we've missed you and know
[37:27] there's been hard trials for you
[37:31] but may the lord just keep you
[37:34] and may you continue
[37:37] to grow in the love of god amen
[37:40] amen
[37:42] well
[37:43] we want to
[37:46] when brother johnson was closing in
[37:48] prayer last sunday
[37:53] he made a statement that we could just
[37:55] never
[37:57] finish
[37:58] ministering on the love of god
[38:01] and how true that is
[38:04] we're having a hard time just getting
[38:06] through this one part
[38:08] about the love of god
[38:12] but
[38:14] we want to just try to take a little
[38:17] a little bit
[38:19] of
[38:20] uh of god's love
[38:22] and and
[38:24] and and and meditate upon it this
[38:26] morning amen
[38:28] we want to title this message it's
[38:30] really part two of of the last service
[38:32] remaining in love but through humility
[38:35] and we may seem this as two different um
[38:39] two different subjects love and humility
[38:41] and could be but
[38:44] um
[38:45] i think if you really want to remain in
[38:47] love
[38:48] one of the most important things that we
[38:50] must have is humility
[38:54] in fact peter says we need to be clothed
[38:57] in it
[38:58] we all got up this morning we all picked
[39:00] out the clothes we got and we're all
[39:02] here and we wanted uh we know that when
[39:05] people would look us it'd be looking at
[39:07] our clothes
[39:09] to some degree is that true
[39:11] okay so when god is looking at us he
[39:13] wants to see humility
[39:16] he doesn't want to see any pride
[39:19] because in fact he kind of like wants to
[39:22] go the other way
[39:24] he resists that
[39:26] but he's he's looking for humility
[39:30] we think about his great love where with
[39:32] he loved us it brings us a warmth and it
[39:34] brings us a security to our hearts
[39:37] but when we think about the requirements
[39:40] of abiding in god's love it brings an
[39:42] uncomfortable feeling
[39:46] but yet they're both god's love
[39:49] and
[39:50] jesus did not mind expressing for god so
[39:53] loved the world that he gave his only
[39:54] begotten son but then he also makes a
[39:57] statement that if you love me you'll
[39:59] keep my commandments
[40:02] showing that there's a relationship that
[40:04] he's interested in amen
[40:07] now
[40:09] um uh saint john chapter
[40:12] 15 verse 7 if if if we could just
[40:16] i would just want to read that here
[40:18] it says if you abide in me
[40:20] and my words abide in you
[40:23] you shall ask what it what you will and
[40:26] it shall be done unto you
[40:29] look at the prerequisite here is the in
[40:31] abiding
[40:33] you've got to abide in christ and christ
[40:34] has got to abide in you and then you ask
[40:36] what you will it's like a prerequisite
[40:39] we want to stare at using the name of
[40:42] jesus for all the benefits that we can
[40:44] get out of it in my name they'll cast
[40:46] out devils
[40:47] but there's coming today in in matthew
[40:50] chapter 7 right around verse number 22
[40:53] it says in my name um
[40:56] many will come to me in that day and say
[40:58] lord then we use your name to cast out
[41:00] devils and to to do many wonderful works
[41:03] and and to speak with tongues
[41:06] but he says but then i'll say unto you i
[41:08] never knew you
[41:11] and so there is a
[41:13] a part of us that that wants to use the
[41:15] name of christ and and see the power of
[41:18] god and things to happen and that is
[41:21] wonderful and there's nothing wrong with
[41:23] it there's many churches that emphasize
[41:27] that
[41:29] but i believe that the most important
[41:31] thing is our relationship with god by
[41:34] far it's the most important and i think
[41:36] that's what makes this ministry uh maybe
[41:39] hard to have that real warm comfortable
[41:42] feeling with because we're dealing with
[41:44] things on our end of the relationship
[41:48] because god's end of the relationship is
[41:50] perfect it's not lacking anything
[41:53] our faith may be lacking but but god is
[41:57] not lacking amen
[42:01] so
[42:02] it's not what we feel but it's believing
[42:05] the word that really changes our life
[42:08] perfect love not only saves us
[42:11] but it lifts us up when we're down
[42:15] and his love is presently
[42:18] leading us to a perfect love
[42:21] relationship with him
[42:22] that's what's happening he's leading us
[42:25] to a place that he that we can say um
[42:28] we um
[42:30] the bible says
[42:32] uh his wife have made herself
[42:35] ready
[42:36] and and that ready is the relationship
[42:38] it's not being able to use the name of
[42:40] jesus
[42:42] and i understand about uh there's a
[42:45] place that we all got to come to an
[42:46] adoption to where we can you know take
[42:48] the checkbook and use the name and and
[42:51] god put a stamp of approval behind it
[42:54] and we need that
[42:57] but we need to emphasize
[43:00] staying in love with god
[43:03] that word abide it means to remain so to
[43:07] to remain in love to be present in love
[43:09] to dwell in love to stand and stay in
[43:12] love that is our goal
[43:15] in part one of our series remaining in
[43:17] god we talked about remaining faithful
[43:21] and it's impossible to grow in christ if
[43:24] without remaining faithful
[43:26] it's like the foundation of of growing
[43:30] anywhere if you take a regular tree
[43:34] and and it's this high and you you dig
[43:37] it out from where it was from a ceiling
[43:40] and you go take it out and you put it
[43:41] over there the first year it's not going
[43:44] to grow
[43:47] it spends all of its time becoming
[43:49] re-established in the ground
[43:53] and then if you take that same tree and
[43:54] you plant it again the next year
[43:57] from one place to the next place to the
[43:59] next place it never has a chance to grow
[44:01] because it's constantly working and
[44:03] getting established
[44:05] in its new foundation and we as
[44:07] christians we've got to remain faithful
[44:09] in the spot that god had planted us if
[44:11] we're going to grow
[44:15] it's in
[44:16] it's important it's pertinent
[44:20] every time we think that certain things
[44:22] that god has commanded us
[44:24] to do
[44:26] are important
[44:27] that's when problems
[44:29] begin to develop
[44:31] because if god told us it's
[44:34] important we send a strong message that
[44:38] god
[44:39] isn't really interested in the
[44:41] relationship he's just interested in
[44:43] certain things and before you know it we
[44:45] really don't even know god because it's
[44:47] you know one person believes this so one
[44:48] person believes that one person thinks
[44:50] this is but what really is important is
[44:52] that we all come under subjection to
[44:55] this
[44:57] and the closer we can do that the more
[44:59] we can do that the more we can represent
[45:00] what true faithfulness is true christian
[45:03] is god is looking for faithfulness not
[45:06] picking and choosing but to remain
[45:08] faithful to every word
[45:11] it is the secret to growing in christ
[45:15] you know brother branham says if you
[45:16] want to get closer to the lord read your
[45:18] bible and pray every day and god is
[45:21] really hidden simplicity
[45:24] and if we just do that i don't know how
[45:27] many times i've read the bible
[45:29] and then god has spoke to me
[45:31] how many times i've gotten on my knees
[45:34] you know you're trying to figure
[45:35] something out but i got on my knees and
[45:37] then boom it was just unfolded
[45:40] and and but both of these things take us
[45:43] away from what our flesh wants to do
[45:46] but we've got to discipline ourselves
[45:50] faithfulness is so important that
[45:51] brother branham says this he says god is
[45:53] not obligated to show you anything more
[45:56] until you've walked in the light that
[45:58] god has shown you that's how important
[46:01] faithfulness is to god
[46:02] we need to be faithful and remain
[46:04] faithful and part two
[46:07] we spoke on remaining fruitful
[46:10] when you remain fruitful in the vine
[46:12] you'll be bearing the fruit of the holy
[46:15] spirit continuously
[46:17] continuously now there there are certain
[46:20] fruits the bible tells us that come in
[46:22] their season
[46:24] right
[46:25] but then there are certain fruits
[46:28] that should be continuously
[46:32] and we don't want to get it mixed up but
[46:34] we ought to be bearing the fruit of the
[46:35] holy ghost all the time
[46:38] all the time
[46:39] i don't care if somebody's yelling at
[46:41] you somebody's cutting you off on the
[46:43] road well you look at the next gas price
[46:46] it doesn't matter the fruit of the
[46:48] spirit should always be there
[46:53] and it's god's desire that we we bear
[46:56] much fruit that's what what jesus said
[46:59] jesus told us that we should expect to
[47:03] be pruned even if we're bearing fruit
[47:06] even if we're bearing fruit he sends a
[47:08] message that you need to expect some
[47:10] prunings coming
[47:12] not because we're bad we're wrong we
[47:14] haven't done good but god is showing his
[47:17] nature and his desire what he's wanting
[47:19] to see out of his children and that's to
[47:21] see such a fruitful life
[47:23] not to be satisfied with a little but
[47:26] but but god has a great expectation for
[47:28] us i know the thoughts i think towards
[47:30] you saith the lord thoughts of peace to
[47:32] give us an expected end and i believe
[47:35] peace is a part of the fruit of the holy
[47:37] ghost don't you
[47:39] he is our peace
[47:43] he is the potter worthy clay he's
[47:45] allowed
[47:46] to prune us
[47:48] jesus said in saint john chapter 15
[47:51] verse 16 you have not chosen me but i
[47:54] have chosen you
[47:56] and i've ordained you that you should go
[47:58] and bring for fruit and that your fruit
[48:01] should remain
[48:03] don't stop bearing the fruit
[48:06] and if if that happens look at here it
[48:09] is that whatsoever you ask in the
[48:12] father's name he may give it unto you
[48:15] jesus is looking for the fruit before
[48:18] he's wanting us to just use his name for
[48:22] things
[48:24] come on
[48:25] speaking of relationship and i know this
[48:27] isn't a good feeling for our flesh
[48:31] but we don't come here
[48:33] because of that
[48:35] we don't if we did i would be the first
[48:37] one to get out of the way and get
[48:39] somebody up here that knows how to make
[48:42] us feel good
[48:45] because i know i wouldn't be the
[48:46] candidate for that nor do i ever want to
[48:49] be
[48:50] it's not in me i don't want to face god
[48:52] with bats
[48:55] i've done a lot of bad things
[49:01] i want to stay with the word amen
[49:04] now look at the very next verse he
[49:06] shares with us what the fruit ought to
[49:07] be bearing he said these things i
[49:09] command you that you love
[49:12] one another
[49:14] that's the fruit that we should be
[49:16] bearing all the time not just to our
[49:19] favorite friends
[49:21] not just to somebody that we're trying
[49:23] to get somebody from get something from
[49:25] them
[49:26] but our enemies
[49:28] the ones that bother us the most
[49:31] the ones we have a hard time with
[49:34] god don't have a hard time bearing love
[49:36] he didn't have a hard time bearing love
[49:38] with judas
[49:41] he didn't kick him out fact he chose
[49:43] them
[49:46] i don't think you know we should be
[49:48] struggling ever with loving one another
[49:54] no i don't and i think that love should
[49:57] be so strong in us that we should better
[49:59] humble ourselves and love one another
[50:02] those
[50:04] that
[50:05] use us
[50:07] despitefully
[50:09] in other words they do over and over and
[50:11] they know what they're doing
[50:15] but to to lay down our life for them
[50:18] that shows god in you
[50:21] to go ahead and say i'm not going to do
[50:22] this for this one but i'll do it for
[50:24] this one it shows that's not god
[50:28] it shows that there's a respect to
[50:30] persons and god is not in that
[50:33] so i'll say like this i know when i look
[50:35] in the mirror i've got growing to do
[50:38] i want you to grow with me i want you to
[50:40] just put your teeth into this and say
[50:42] god i don't want to be halfway he's not
[50:44] choosing halfway
[50:46] he's calling his bride to a perfect love
[50:48] now i say everybody but the bride will
[50:51] have less than perfect love so why would
[50:53] we want to stay there
[50:55] amen so we got to press towards it
[50:58] now early in the chapter
[51:01] our of our opening scripture jesus said
[51:03] in in in chapter 15 verse 9 is the
[51:06] father have loved me so have i loved you
[51:08] continue in my love if you keep my
[51:10] commandments you shall abide in my love
[51:12] even as i kept my father's commandments
[51:14] and abide in his love
[51:18] last sunday
[51:20] we spoke on remaining in love
[51:24] we first described that god is love and
[51:26] it and it's so powerful
[51:29] that it's always living for others and i
[51:32] think that is a good way to say god's
[51:34] love is so powerful that it's always
[51:36] living for others what it seems like in
[51:38] our life we try to live for others when
[51:40] it's convenient when we got this done
[51:42] that's done we've got all the things
[51:44] handled and there's no problems in our
[51:46] life and then we can do something to for
[51:48] somebody that is not the love of god
[51:50] that's the convenient love
[51:53] but i say that love of god is so
[51:54] powerful that i don't care if you're on
[51:57] a cross and you're looking down at
[52:00] your at your at your disciple and you
[52:03] say to him son behold thy mother mother
[52:06] behold the son and he was suffering or
[52:09] stephen when they were throwing stones
[52:11] on them and he said father forgive them
[52:13] i i pray that you have mercy on them
[52:16] that was god in stephen living for
[52:19] others and going through the hardest
[52:21] times
[52:25] anybody can pick and choose when it's
[52:28] okay
[52:32] too often we think that we have god's
[52:34] love
[52:35] when we're trying to help
[52:36] someone
[52:40] we'll give them the truth and they get
[52:42] offended
[52:44] or they dislike us
[52:46] and we give up on them
[52:50] but it's feeling love
[52:52] it's not a gap i love
[52:55] feeling love has limitations
[52:58] it feels like i've tried i did my best i
[53:00] can't do any more
[53:02] and and what we need to do is be
[53:04] repeating the word
[53:07] the word
[53:09] the word doesn't quite
[53:15] god's love
[53:16] remains
[53:18] faithful
[53:20] it bears all things it believes all
[53:22] things it hopes all things it endures
[53:24] all things in fact it just never quits
[53:27] it keeps going
[53:29] every time you see the integer energizer
[53:31] bubble bud bubble bunny
[53:35] i want you to think
[53:37] about
[53:38] god's love never quits
[53:43] it never quits
[53:45] so if you feel like quitting that's
[53:47] normal but it's not god
[53:50] it's us
[53:53] and it's okay
[53:55] but we just need to identify
[53:57] and if you're okay with not having
[53:59] enough of god love well then that's fine
[54:01] but when you have that thought you'll
[54:03] realize i need to get more love
[54:06] see we're looking for an excuse not to
[54:07] keep going we're looking for an excuse
[54:10] that i've done enough but god don't have
[54:12] that
[54:17] this is the love that god wants us to
[54:19] remain in the mindset the the attitude
[54:22] that he wants us to have
[54:24] it's not a gift just like character
[54:28] jesus is not going to hand that to us
[54:32] it's a victory
[54:37] if you want love
[54:39] shout hallelujah praise the lord
[54:42] you've got to do something about this
[54:45] relationship with god
[54:51] you've got to abide in him you got to
[54:53] abide in the word you got to keep the
[54:55] commandments it's got to be important to
[54:57] you
[54:59] not just
[55:01] i love god god loves me everything's
[55:03] perfect no matter what i do we got to go
[55:06] after it we got to seek more of the holy
[55:08] ghost
[55:10] the love of god is shut abroad in our
[55:12] heart by the holy ghost so when you're
[55:14] seeking god you're seeking the living
[55:16] word
[55:18] god will come and fill our hearts and
[55:21] when he does you ain't gonna have a
[55:23] problem laying down our life
[55:25] for the brethren we're not going to
[55:30] it's good to see
[55:31] brother david with us today
[55:34] amen in god's house but we need the hat
[55:36] off we should take that hat off
[55:39] god deserves
[55:42] the
[55:42] most utmost respect amen
[55:46] amen but our brother homie's been
[55:47] praying for brother davian
[55:49] amen amen amen
[55:52] because
[55:52] he's a child of god he's a child of the
[55:55] king
[55:56] amen and he belongs under the protection
[56:00] of the holy ghost amen
[56:03] and i'll tell you i'm so grateful
[56:06] for the person who loved me when i was
[56:08] in the world
[56:11] who took time to share with me that
[56:13] there's a greater life because i was
[56:15] into a lot of stuff as you know
[56:19] for the nominal church believer it may
[56:20] not seem critic so be seen important or
[56:24] crucial or are critical to keep all of
[56:26] god's commandments but to god is very
[56:30] important he said this is my commandment
[56:32] that ye love one another as i have loved
[56:36] you
[56:39] now god's love isn't just for our
[56:42] fleshly benefits
[56:45] god loves me
[56:47] god blesses me
[56:49] god met all my needs
[56:51] if there's a need that i want god to
[56:53] meet in my life
[56:55] it's the need
[56:56] to be able to live completely for him
[57:02] i'd rather take that than
[57:05] having money to pay my house bill
[57:07] honestly
[57:11] i i can't have everything that i every
[57:14] does anybody got everything they want
[57:16] no we might also take priority god fill
[57:19] me with you
[57:20] fill me with you
[57:23] we must learn
[57:25] to live for others be long-suffering
[57:28] with others greater love have no man
[57:29] than this and a man lay down his life
[57:32] for his friends
[57:34] and you are my friends if you do
[57:36] whatsoever i command you
[57:40] how many got how many
[57:42] how many is my friend today
[57:46] okay how many didn't want to vote
[57:50] what we're really saying there is that
[57:52] you'll lay down your life from me
[57:58] amen
[58:01] ye and my friends if you do so
[58:03] whatsoever i command you
[58:05] and we we ended up talking about what
[58:07] has god commanded you
[58:10] what has god commanded you is your is
[58:13] our walk this personal that we we have
[58:16] recognized what god is speaking to us to
[58:18] do
[58:22] and because if we if we don't
[58:24] capture that then we can't walk in it
[58:27] how can we keep it if everything is just
[58:29] so generic
[58:31] amen so it's a personal
[58:33] walk with god we have to to to choose to
[58:38] abide in that commandment to to continue
[58:41] to stay connected to remain in the love
[58:43] of god
[58:45] it it it it just doesn't happen at
[58:48] convenience but it's a choice that you
[58:50] have to make at the hardest time
[58:53] how many times have have uh somebody
[58:56] said something did something to you and
[58:58] it just hurt the daylights out of you
[59:01] just really hurts you and something
[59:04] inside of you didn't want to let the
[59:07] other person know
[59:09] that you were hurt
[59:11] because you didn't want to hurt them and
[59:13] you didn't want to hurt them back
[59:17] i mean it takes the love of god inside
[59:20] of you stronger than the situation
[59:23] to be able to love
[59:26] and that's what we're we're looking for
[59:28] is to remain in that love amen and it
[59:32] can only be done
[59:33] i believe not only but the greatest
[59:35] asset that we need is humility
[59:39] it's not easy
[59:40] as we think to abide in god's love
[59:45] jesus said that many will be offended in
[59:47] the day that we're living in and many
[59:48] would actually betray one another
[59:51] and hate one another
[59:53] and because iniquity has gone bonkles
[59:56] bonkles i mean just iniquities all over
[59:59] the place the love of many is just
[1:00:01] waxing cold so it looks just like some
[1:00:03] picture
[1:00:05] some formality
[1:00:09] help us lord
[1:00:11] we want to be full of the love of god
[1:00:14] brother branham said in the message the
[1:00:16] new ministry he says
[1:00:17] that god would keep me humble in my
[1:00:20] heart and i like the way that he says
[1:00:21] that he didn't ask god to make him
[1:00:23] humble he asked him to keep him
[1:00:27] humble in heart
[1:00:28] and would help me and bless me so that i
[1:00:32] could be a blessing
[1:00:33] to you people
[1:00:36] he says i found out that the greater
[1:00:38] blessings in life is giving something
[1:00:40] out not receiving it in
[1:00:43] but giving it out
[1:00:44] what you do
[1:00:46] for others
[1:00:53] so the display of eternal life is not
[1:00:55] always wanting for ourselves
[1:00:58] it's looking to help somebody
[1:01:01] help someone in the church
[1:01:03] if you don't
[1:01:05] know of of a need that somebody has
[1:01:07] spend some time with them you'll see the
[1:01:09] need you can't help but talk to somebody
[1:01:11] and see need
[1:01:14] you just become aware you become aware
[1:01:17] i'm so glad that we're having fellowship
[1:01:19] after service
[1:01:21] now we as believers are often confronted
[1:01:24] with enticing spirits
[1:01:26] these spirits
[1:01:29] they convince us that we still love god
[1:01:34] even if we're not following the word
[1:01:37] and to me it's it's the same spirit that
[1:01:40] came
[1:01:41] to eve in the garden
[1:01:43] he's doing the same thing
[1:01:45] it doesn't you don't have to do
[1:01:46] everything because you're doing the
[1:01:48] majority
[1:01:50] and it's that spirit that will
[1:01:52] eventually lead us away that's why
[1:01:53] brother branson i'd rather have the
[1:01:55] right spirit in the wrong doctrine than
[1:01:57] have the right doctrine in the wrong
[1:01:58] spirit because eventually a wrong spirit
[1:02:00] is going to lead you in the wrong
[1:02:01] direction
[1:02:03] but the right spirit even if you're
[1:02:04] wrong in how you're viewing something
[1:02:06] we'll venture to get you on the right
[1:02:07] track because it's him
[1:02:09] it's him
[1:02:12] so we ended up in this statement saying
[1:02:14] oh foolish galatians who have bewitched
[1:02:16] you that you should not obey
[1:02:19] the truth
[1:02:22] any spirit that says it doesn't matter
[1:02:24] if we go to church
[1:02:27] it doesn't matter if we do communion
[1:02:29] full rushing
[1:02:30] it doesn't matter if we we don't have to
[1:02:32] lay down our life
[1:02:34] those
[1:02:35] are enticing spirits
[1:02:39] and
[1:02:40] they're sent to get us off track
[1:02:44] but today we want to get on track here
[1:02:46] i'll say you know for the church-goers
[1:02:49] that's okay but
[1:02:50] for the bride she has an ear to hear
[1:02:52] what the spirit is saying to the church
[1:02:54] amen
[1:02:55] turn with me if you would to jude
[1:02:57] chapter 1 verse 17. and we want to start
[1:02:59] our message today
[1:03:01] remaining in love to humility and it's a
[1:03:03] terrible thing about uh having to go
[1:03:06] over the foundation of the last service
[1:03:07] because it eats up a little bit of time
[1:03:11] but here jew says but beloved remember
[1:03:13] ye the words which were spoken before
[1:03:14] the apostles of our lord jesus christ
[1:03:17] how that they told you that there should
[1:03:18] be mockers in the last day who should
[1:03:20] walk after their own desires
[1:03:23] these be they that separate themselves
[1:03:25] central having not the spirit notice the
[1:03:28] the the consensus of that that comes
[1:03:31] together that they separate themselves
[1:03:33] they're central and they don't have the
[1:03:35] spirit so church outgoers in this hour
[1:03:38] are walking after their own desires
[1:03:42] if they don't get what they want they'll
[1:03:43] leave
[1:03:45] i've heard from so many sources there's
[1:03:48] more church hopping going on than than
[1:03:51] there ever was
[1:03:54] think about it don't get what we want
[1:03:57] just go somewhere else
[1:03:58] i think jesus did tell us at one place
[1:04:01] he said if if they say go here it says
[1:04:04] go not
[1:04:08] if you don't got enough faith that god
[1:04:10] can speak to you in the middle of a
[1:04:12] storm
[1:04:15] we don't need a perfect church we need a
[1:04:17] perfect word living inside of us that's
[1:04:19] what we need that's what make our church
[1:04:20] better is someone who's willing to lay
[1:04:22] down their life for the
[1:04:24] body we got so much christ then we
[1:04:27] should be able to help the church
[1:04:29] but that's the thing there's too many
[1:04:31] people who are just in it for themselves
[1:04:33] we're at a men's bible study and our our
[1:04:36] brother um
[1:04:38] uh brother ferguson he brought out a
[1:04:40] real good point
[1:04:42] and and he said that if if the spirit
[1:04:44] isn't right
[1:04:46] it's
[1:04:47] when it's trying to uh to do something
[1:04:50] if it don't get what it wants it just
[1:04:51] quits right away
[1:04:53] he says but if if it's god in that
[1:04:55] person he'll never stop he'll just stay
[1:04:57] right there and he'll keep working
[1:05:00] because that's the spirit of god he
[1:05:01] doesn't stop with us every time we sin
[1:05:04] make a mistake or quit or bail out he's
[1:05:07] he's he's going to see us through as
[1:05:09] he's patient he's long suffering
[1:05:14] if you're trying to separate yourself i
[1:05:17] say this check your spirit
[1:05:20] when we walk after our own desires we
[1:05:22] have the tendency to not walk in the
[1:05:24] unity with the ministry with the word of
[1:05:27] god
[1:05:29] so i say don't choose to separate
[1:05:31] yourself don't allow yourself to be
[1:05:32] separated by some demonic influence
[1:05:36] these be they who separate themselves
[1:05:39] central having not the spirit
[1:05:44] but they think they do
[1:05:46] if you've got the spirit
[1:05:50] then
[1:05:53] you're going to have love
[1:05:56] love
[1:05:57] because the love of god is shed abroad
[1:05:59] in our heart by the holy spirit
[1:06:02] verse 20 but ye beloved building up
[1:06:05] yourselves
[1:06:06] on your most holy faith praying in the
[1:06:08] holy ghost here it is the verse i want
[1:06:10] to get to keep yourselves in the love of
[1:06:13] god
[1:06:14] keep yourself in the love of god
[1:06:17] this is your this is your job this is
[1:06:19] what you do this is your choice this is
[1:06:22] your attitude
[1:06:24] you either keep yourself there or you
[1:06:25] just wander off and it just doesn't
[1:06:27] matter not real important to you and you
[1:06:28] just expect everybody to love you even
[1:06:30] though you're not loving everybody
[1:06:36] keeping yourself and the love of god
[1:06:39] looking for the mercy of our lord jesus
[1:06:42] christ unto eternal life
[1:06:45] jesus said continue ye in my love if you
[1:06:48] keep my commandments ye shall abide in
[1:06:51] my loves and some having some have
[1:06:54] compassion what happens those are those
[1:06:56] are special people
[1:06:58] you find somebody that's got compassion
[1:07:00] they make a difference
[1:07:02] they make a difference when you get done
[1:07:04] talking to them you feel like living
[1:07:06] more for god
[1:07:09] because it's not about
[1:07:10] getting close to one another i don't
[1:07:12] mean it wrong i love you and i want you
[1:07:14] to love me but i made a decision a long
[1:07:17] time ago
[1:07:18] if you never love me i want to i want to
[1:07:21] spend my life helping build your
[1:07:24] relationship with god
[1:07:25] because that's more important
[1:07:30] and if it's just for one soul
[1:07:34] that's what's important
[1:07:37] god and you that's the most important
[1:07:39] thing we could jesus said you could have
[1:07:41] the whole world
[1:07:43] what would it gain you
[1:07:45] what would it gain you all the
[1:07:46] popularity all the money all the things
[1:07:48] that you could have what would it gain
[1:07:50] you
[1:07:51] nothing
[1:07:53] nothing
[1:07:54] keep yourself in the love of god
[1:07:57] some having compassion making
[1:08:00] a difference and we must remember it's
[1:08:03] our choice
[1:08:04] to stay in love with god
[1:08:08] if it's all about convenience and all
[1:08:09] the needs are met and all you got to do
[1:08:11] is just
[1:08:14] well you're going to soon be sifted out
[1:08:16] because satan wants to sift every one of
[1:08:18] us like wheat
[1:08:22] we're to stay connected to the vine of
[1:08:25] god's great love wherewith he has loved
[1:08:27] us amen
[1:08:28] now jesus summed it all up in this when
[1:08:31] he said if you keep my commandments you
[1:08:33] shall abide in my love
[1:08:36] now the problem is is it's hard
[1:08:41] to keep god's commandments we get
[1:08:43] distracted
[1:08:45] a lot
[1:08:47] and we forget about them how important
[1:08:49] they are and what becomes important is
[1:08:51] all of our problems and to find answers
[1:08:53] to all of our problems and to find a way
[1:08:56] to
[1:08:57] uh
[1:08:58] to get more money to pay for the gas now
[1:09:00] and
[1:09:01] i
[1:09:02] mike was telling me about uh
[1:09:05] somebody had to sell his semis and all
[1:09:07] of his his company his equipment because
[1:09:09] he he he didn't have enough money to buy
[1:09:12] the gas to to truck the supplies because
[1:09:15] they don't give you more
[1:09:16] and trucking companies are going out of
[1:09:18] out of business and i'm telling you
[1:09:20] we're all feeling and if not we're going
[1:09:22] to be feeling the effect there is a
[1:09:24] squeeze and brother brian said that
[1:09:26] squeeze is even going to come on the
[1:09:27] bride
[1:09:31] first john chapter 2 verse 4 first john
[1:09:33] chapter 2 verse 4 he that saith i know
[1:09:36] him and keepeth not his commandments as
[1:09:37] a liar
[1:09:39] and the truth is not in him but who so
[1:09:41] keepeth the word in him verily is the
[1:09:44] love of god perfected and hereby know we
[1:09:48] that we are in him
[1:09:49] he that abideth him all ought himself
[1:09:52] also to walk even as he walks so i mean
[1:09:54] if you want to see the love of god
[1:09:57] perfected in you keep the word
[1:10:00] put more emphasis
[1:10:02] on you following the word not you
[1:10:05] saying i agree
[1:10:08] i agree that the word is true i believe
[1:10:09] it's god
[1:10:11] that's not going to help you
[1:10:14] what you got to step out and say lord
[1:10:16] where am i missing you where am i not
[1:10:19] following your word not just focusing
[1:10:21] only on what you are doing but what
[1:10:23] you're not doing that's important i
[1:10:25] don't want you to be discouraged or or
[1:10:27] be bothered but we need the love of god
[1:10:30] perfected in us right
[1:10:34] all right
[1:10:35] his commandments
[1:10:38] are the whole
[1:10:39] bible
[1:10:42] and not only the whole bible but what
[1:10:44] about the things he comes and speaks to
[1:10:46] you when you're in prayer
[1:10:48] maybe you can't find that exactly
[1:10:51] for word but it's still god
[1:10:54] brother says we come to church to find
[1:10:56] out where we're at with god
[1:10:58] we have that tendency of forgetting the
[1:11:00] commandments so this is why we want to
[1:11:02] come and be reminded this is where we're
[1:11:04] at god speaks to us personally
[1:11:08] i want to talk about some practical
[1:11:10] things but we're only going to get
[1:11:12] hopefully hopefully
[1:11:14] at least with my notes through just one
[1:11:16] and and that's
[1:11:18] to keep keep ourselves humble god gives
[1:11:21] more grace to the humble
[1:11:24] while resisting the prowl so god hates a
[1:11:27] proud look
[1:11:29] a proud smirk
[1:11:30] a proud comment
[1:11:32] a proud uh roll of the eyes uh some sort
[1:11:36] of gesture god hates that spirit
[1:11:41] amen
[1:11:42] but he's looking for us to be clothed
[1:11:44] with humility a realness
[1:11:46] a real
[1:11:48] humility
[1:11:50] don't ask to be humble
[1:11:55] in other words don't put it off on god
[1:11:57] it's an attitude that we choose to carry
[1:12:00] around i remember in brother johnson's
[1:12:02] church when brother hankins was
[1:12:04] preaching
[1:12:05] one time he says don't you pray to be
[1:12:07] humble
[1:12:10] he said just be humble
[1:12:12] be humble it's your choice
[1:12:16] it's an attitude thing
[1:12:18] your attitude is going to make a big
[1:12:20] difference in where you go
[1:12:22] with re remaining in the love of god
[1:12:25] the bible says humble yourselves under
[1:12:27] the mighty hand of god
[1:12:30] now god's company is not with everybody
[1:12:33] he loves everybody but his company is
[1:12:35] not with everybody
[1:12:37] his company is with the humble
[1:12:39] of heart
[1:12:41] isaiah 57 verse 15
[1:12:44] says for thus saith the lord saith the
[1:12:47] high and lofty one that inhabits
[1:12:50] eternity so we all know who we're who
[1:12:52] we're
[1:12:53] looking at here whose name is holy i
[1:12:56] dwell in the high and holy place with
[1:12:58] him also that is of a contrite
[1:13:01] and a humble spirit
[1:13:04] to revive the spirit of the humble and
[1:13:06] to revive the heart of the contrite one
[1:13:08] so god is dwelling with a humble spirit
[1:13:17] and if he resists the proud i'll say to
[1:13:20] try to remain in love with god and not
[1:13:23] have a humble spirit is going to be
[1:13:25] impossible
[1:13:27] impossible
[1:13:29] no matter what we feel
[1:13:31] what we think what we believe
[1:13:33] we've got to stay with the word
[1:13:37] if you really want to keep yourself in
[1:13:39] the love of god then keep your spirit
[1:13:42] humble broken and contrite
[1:13:48] it's important when you're talking to
[1:13:49] people people see whether you're clothed
[1:13:51] with humility or your clothes with look
[1:13:53] at me
[1:13:57] look for areas in your life that need
[1:13:59] work
[1:14:02] and work on them
[1:14:05] be zealous and repent
[1:14:07] we're going to dive into something
[1:14:08] perhaps that we've never quite seen
[1:14:11] before but first john chapter 3 verse 1
[1:14:14] behold what matter of love the father
[1:14:16] bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:14:18] called the sons of god therefore the
[1:14:20] world knoweth this not because it knew
[1:14:21] him not
[1:14:22] beloved now are we the sons of god and
[1:14:24] it doth not yet appear what we shall be
[1:14:25] but we know that when he show up here
[1:14:28] we're going to be just like him first we
[1:14:29] shall see him as he is
[1:14:31] now that's the truth now if this is the
[1:14:33] way you believe
[1:14:34] it says in every man that has this hope
[1:14:37] in him
[1:14:39] purify it
[1:14:41] that word makes clean sanctifies himself
[1:14:44] even as he is pure so there is a work
[1:14:47] for us to do
[1:14:49] there's something and we need to be
[1:14:51] looking at what we need
[1:14:54] and when you look at your needs you will
[1:14:57] act more humble
[1:15:02] when you look at everybody else's needs
[1:15:04] you will be more judgmental
[1:15:08] because if god ever shows you something
[1:15:11] about somebody
[1:15:12] you will lay down your life to help them
[1:15:16] but if the devil shows you something
[1:15:18] wrong about somebody you'll do nothing
[1:15:20] to help that person
[1:15:22] you'll just state what's wrong and it's
[1:15:24] real easy to know what spirit is
[1:15:26] speaking to you
[1:15:29] because you don't got to know the truth
[1:15:32] to find critic to find something wrong
[1:15:34] about somebody
[1:15:39] the more you remain humble
[1:15:41] the more you'll have a repentant
[1:15:44] spirit
[1:15:46] and the more you repent the more you'll
[1:15:48] be forgiven and the more that you're
[1:15:50] forgiven
[1:15:55] the more that you're forgiven
[1:15:57] the more you love god
[1:16:00] i want that to soak in
[1:16:06] we've all been forgiven
[1:16:08] of our sins
[1:16:10] we've asked
[1:16:12] but i wonder just
[1:16:14] how much of us look at
[1:16:18] forgiveness is such a treasure to be
[1:16:21] forgiven
[1:16:23] or if it's just
[1:16:25] oh yeah you know i just asked god to
[1:16:27] cover me with his blood and it's done
[1:16:29] and i don't even think about no more
[1:16:34] look at isaiah chapter six
[1:16:36] he was
[1:16:38] in that high and holy place
[1:16:41] the high end with with the high and
[1:16:43] lofty one the one that inhabits eternity
[1:16:46] and the first thing
[1:16:48] that isaiah recognizes when he's there
[1:16:51] is how unworthy he is to be in the
[1:16:54] presence of god amen
[1:16:58] so we can kind of come into church and
[1:17:00] we just feel you know
[1:17:03] like where is that humility
[1:17:06] where is that unworthiness to be in his
[1:17:08] presence
[1:17:14] what are we entering into
[1:17:17] and we've all felt the presence of god
[1:17:19] in our cars right
[1:17:21] listening to a song
[1:17:24] praying sometime and his presence just
[1:17:25] comes and
[1:17:27] saturates you baptize you and you end up
[1:17:30] crying
[1:17:32] so we know about the presence of god and
[1:17:34] when the presence of god comes you feel
[1:17:37] unworthy
[1:17:41] you do not feel like you're something
[1:17:43] special
[1:17:46] like you've got something more than
[1:17:47] somebody
[1:17:50] you feel unworthy to be in the same
[1:17:52] place that god is at
[1:17:55] this is something that isaiah was
[1:17:58] feeling
[1:17:59] and he says this word he said woe is me
[1:18:04] he didn't need some preacher to tell him
[1:18:07] what was wrong in his life
[1:18:12] if you got to have somebody tell you
[1:18:13] what's wrong you got to get in the
[1:18:14] presence of the lord
[1:18:17] you're in the wrong presence
[1:18:24] he said in chapter 6 verse 5 woe is me i
[1:18:27] am undone because i am a man of unclean
[1:18:32] lips
[1:18:33] and when we remain in the presence of
[1:18:35] god we'll always feel unworthy
[1:18:38] this is important if you want to be
[1:18:40] close with humility
[1:18:42] you need to feel this way
[1:18:45] i mean how many times i i brother stan
[1:18:48] was telling me uh of of vision he's
[1:18:51] visited a number of churches in the past
[1:18:53] he's telling me about a a certain church
[1:18:55] he went into and and and and the the
[1:18:58] minister um would drive up on in the
[1:19:01] biggest
[1:19:02] uh cadillac
[1:19:04] and and there that gold all over him he
[1:19:06] was just almost plated with gold he had
[1:19:08] so much gold on him
[1:19:11] and he was trying to tell everybody that
[1:19:13] you need to give
[1:19:14] more money to the church
[1:19:22] when we're clothed
[1:19:24] i'm just saying like this when you're
[1:19:25] clothed with humility you feel unworthy
[1:19:31] it's a spirit that you decide that you
[1:19:33] want to pack around
[1:19:35] just like
[1:19:36] if you want to pack around a lot of gold
[1:19:38] you're going to do it
[1:19:40] if you want to pack around a lot of
[1:19:41] pride you're going to do it if you want
[1:19:43] to pack around a lot of humility you're
[1:19:45] going to do it
[1:19:48] now isaiah repented
[1:19:50] and he fell more in love with god
[1:19:56] and it took god
[1:19:58] to actually cleanse him
[1:20:00] but if he didn't start with lord i need
[1:20:03] you i'm undone
[1:20:05] amen
[1:20:06] he would have never got cleansed it took
[1:20:08] a repent of heart
[1:20:10] and the beauty of this
[1:20:15] he fell so much in love with god that
[1:20:17] when god asked him to do something he
[1:20:19] said i'll do it
[1:20:23] who go for it lord send me
[1:20:25] he didn't say send that guy
[1:20:27] send that girl you know
[1:20:30] no lord send me
[1:20:32] it's a personal thing
[1:20:34] i mean i would to god that we would all
[1:20:36] get so personal with god that we would
[1:20:38] actually say lord send me
[1:20:41] send me lord
[1:20:44] that's where our relationship needs to
[1:20:46] get to
[1:20:48] a repentant heart and spirit will always
[1:20:51] stay in love with god and i want to go
[1:20:53] with kind of a lengthy reading and this
[1:20:55] perhaps may be our our last but it's in
[1:20:58] luke chapter 7 verse 36
[1:21:03] how important is to be clothed with
[1:21:04] humility to always have that repent of
[1:21:07] heart that repentant spear not wanting
[1:21:08] to hurt anybody but to help somebody
[1:21:12] are you with me now just so you know um
[1:21:17] you did not come to church today to hear
[1:21:19] a sermon about how great you're doing
[1:21:25] we just we just came to hear how we can
[1:21:28] stay more in love with god how many has
[1:21:30] felt that you've drifted away from the
[1:21:33] love of god
[1:21:35] okay it is something that happens to
[1:21:37] every one of us from time to time
[1:21:40] and so this is just showing us
[1:21:43] the way
[1:21:44] to remain in god's love
[1:21:46] so in luke chapter 7 verse 36
[1:21:49] and one of the pharisees desired him
[1:21:52] that he would eat
[1:21:54] jesus would eat with him and he went
[1:21:56] into the pharisees house and sat down
[1:21:58] to to meet and be hold a woman in the
[1:22:02] city
[1:22:03] which was a sinner when she knew that
[1:22:05] jesus said it meet in the pharisees
[1:22:08] house brought an alabaster box of
[1:22:13] anointment
[1:22:15] and he stood at his feet behind him
[1:22:17] weeping
[1:22:19] look at the humility wasn't in front
[1:22:21] but behind began to wash his feet with
[1:22:24] with tears
[1:22:26] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[1:22:28] head
[1:22:29] and and kissed his feet and anointed
[1:22:32] them with anointment
[1:22:34] now when the pharisee
[1:22:37] which had
[1:22:38] bitten jesus
[1:22:40] saw it
[1:22:41] he spake
[1:22:43] within himself saying
[1:22:45] this man
[1:22:47] this man who you claim
[1:22:50] if he were a prophet
[1:22:52] he would have known who and what matter
[1:22:55] woman this is that touched him
[1:22:57] for she
[1:22:58] is a sinner
[1:23:05] hmm
[1:23:07] i say like this if you're going to do
[1:23:08] something for the kingdom you better
[1:23:10] have tough skin
[1:23:12] because the devil is going to find
[1:23:13] someone he can use to come against you
[1:23:19] why is that it's because he wants to
[1:23:21] stop what you're doing
[1:23:24] think about this a cup of cold water
[1:23:27] did you know
[1:23:28] that ever since we got these bottles
[1:23:32] you lost the opportunity to give a cup
[1:23:34] of cold water
[1:23:36] but a cup of cold water
[1:23:39] given in his name
[1:23:41] it shall not lose its reward we should
[1:23:43] not lose our reward
[1:23:46] but the devil is trying
[1:23:48] to stop
[1:23:50] the work of the lord
[1:23:52] here was a sinner doing something for
[1:23:54] the kingdom and satan hated it
[1:23:58] how much more
[1:24:00] will the bride of jesus christ when
[1:24:02] she's walking in harmony with the holy
[1:24:04] ghost
[1:24:05] and doing something for the kingdom will
[1:24:07] the devil just try to stop it
[1:24:15] you'll have the weapons of hell coming
[1:24:17] against you
[1:24:19] we need to work together for the kingdom
[1:24:22] of god
[1:24:24] i'm okay with not carrying the ball
[1:24:28] but i'll tell you i am not going to sit
[1:24:30] around and let somebody else carry the
[1:24:31] ball without blocking
[1:24:36] that's just not me
[1:24:38] i by far would rather sit in the back
[1:24:41] seat
[1:24:44] but there's something inside
[1:24:48] you just don't want to sit around for
[1:24:50] god
[1:24:52] you want to do something for the kingdom
[1:24:54] of god
[1:24:59] now simon
[1:25:00] said if this man was of god if he was
[1:25:03] being led of god certainly he would have
[1:25:06] not
[1:25:06] allowed and done this awful thing
[1:25:11] it's amazing to me how judgmental people
[1:25:14] can get
[1:25:16] in this last day people are becoming
[1:25:18] more and more judgmental
[1:25:21] they're they're hating they're offending
[1:25:23] their love is waxing colder and colder
[1:25:27] the devil is looking for anybody that he
[1:25:31] can just whisper something negative to
[1:25:42] brother branham
[1:25:44] said it's not the action that takes
[1:25:46] place but the reaction
[1:25:50] simon was reacting wrong in his heart to
[1:25:53] a situation
[1:25:56] the scripture says be careful how we we
[1:25:58] talk to strangers
[1:26:00] for some have entertained angels
[1:26:02] unawares
[1:26:04] it's not the action the reaction
[1:26:08] if you think someone is wrong
[1:26:10] this is your chance
[1:26:12] to help them
[1:26:15] and if we're too lazy or we don't got
[1:26:17] enough faith to help someone then we
[1:26:19] should
[1:26:22] zip the lip
[1:26:25] brother john
[1:26:28] i don't like this kind of preaching
[1:26:34] well i don't like this kind of judgment
[1:26:38] god don't like this kind of judgment
[1:26:41] god would rather see all of us washing
[1:26:43] one another's feet
[1:26:45] helping one another
[1:26:47] functioning as a body as a family
[1:26:50] and we can only do that if we come in
[1:26:52] harmony with the word
[1:26:54] we humble ourselves get close with
[1:26:56] humility and realize that god hasn't
[1:26:58] called me this church to kind of
[1:27:00] straighten it out
[1:27:05] how about just
[1:27:06] help someone
[1:27:08] help them get underneath them brother
[1:27:10] brandon says it takes a big man to get
[1:27:12] underneath another man
[1:27:15] get underneath him
[1:27:23] telling somebody they're wrong in a fit
[1:27:25] of rage
[1:27:27] and judging them is not going to help
[1:27:30] simon's motive was not to help this is
[1:27:33] what we must understand
[1:27:36] he had he invited jesus
[1:27:39] to his place
[1:27:42] but his motive was not to help it was to
[1:27:44] be judgmental
[1:27:48] it's why the prophet taught us to check
[1:27:49] our motives
[1:27:53] it's easy to judge someone but it's
[1:27:55] difficult to deny our flesh that lust
[1:27:59] and only wants to please itself
[1:28:05] now i would imagine if this same jesus
[1:28:07] who simon judged
[1:28:11] would have just kind of like left the
[1:28:12] woman there and came over to simon and
[1:28:15] said simon you're the greatest thing
[1:28:17] here in this building today
[1:28:20] well i don't think he would have had
[1:28:21] those thoughts do you
[1:28:25] but simon
[1:28:26] is still who simon is
[1:28:29] we must remember that
[1:28:32] this is why it's important for us to be
[1:28:35] close with humility
[1:28:37] like right now as much as you wanted to
[1:28:39] wear a different color you couldn't do
[1:28:40] it right now
[1:28:41] because you already decided to do what
[1:28:42] you're doing
[1:28:44] you can't just put on
[1:28:45] humility and and and and take it on and
[1:28:49] off like a light switch
[1:28:51] it's there it's there
[1:28:53] he ever been so mad and so angry and
[1:28:56] you're trying to suppress it
[1:28:58] but then in talking to somebody just
[1:29:00] like
[1:29:01] comes out
[1:29:03] that's how pride is
[1:29:05] that's how being judgmental is it can
[1:29:08] just it just comes out so humility is a
[1:29:10] real clothing
[1:29:12] of the spirit amen
[1:29:15] people are missing
[1:29:18] the love of god in their heart
[1:29:21] people are
[1:29:22] are never going to know
[1:29:24] that we're his disciple if we're always
[1:29:26] judging what's wrong
[1:29:29] we've got to move up to the next step we
[1:29:32] got to lay down our lives for what's
[1:29:34] wrong
[1:29:35] for who's wrong
[1:29:37] but if i do that you know what they're
[1:29:38] going to do
[1:29:41] oh just tell me a list of it i really
[1:29:43] don't care because jesus never gave an
[1:29:45] excuse why not to do it
[1:29:47] why not to lay down your life he didn't
[1:29:49] say lay down your life except brother
[1:29:52] brandon never said eternal life is
[1:29:53] living for others except
[1:29:57] if we can't do it for our enemy we still
[1:29:59] got the goods
[1:30:01] how much more are we to do it for one
[1:30:03] another
[1:30:06] think about it
[1:30:10] bible says
[1:30:11] when a man is overtaken in a fault god
[1:30:14] wants a spiritual man to go restore him
[1:30:18] not just someone who knows the person's
[1:30:21] fault
[1:30:22] who has a bunch of head knowledge of
[1:30:24] what's right or wrong but someone with a
[1:30:26] another spirit like joshua and caleb had
[1:30:29] another spirit a spirit that's capable
[1:30:32] to restore
[1:30:34] it would be better to say
[1:30:36] like if i was to ask you right now there
[1:30:38] is a man
[1:30:40] down the road from us he said he is so
[1:30:42] possessed with a demon
[1:30:45] and i'd like
[1:30:46] you to come cast them out
[1:30:50] well some of you may feel like i'm
[1:30:52] unprepared for this
[1:30:57] sometimes we're unprepared to restore
[1:30:59] somebody
[1:31:02] we really just don't got the meekness
[1:31:05] the love
[1:31:06] the patience and the long-suffering
[1:31:10] but we still know that they're wrong
[1:31:13] but knowing they're wrong
[1:31:15] and not having what it takes to help
[1:31:17] them doesn't help the situation
[1:31:21] god is looking for people who know how
[1:31:23] to help
[1:31:25] amen
[1:31:26] to remain in the love of god
[1:31:34] simon didn't want to lay down his life
[1:31:37] turn with me to verse 40 or continue on
[1:31:39] to verse 40 jesus answering
[1:31:43] jesus never blasted
[1:31:45] simon
[1:31:46] for his wrong
[1:31:47] but he still
[1:31:49] taught him in humility
[1:31:52] he's jesus answered he said unto him
[1:31:54] simon i have so much to say unto thee he
[1:31:57] saith master say on and he said a
[1:32:00] certain creditor which had two debtors
[1:32:03] the one owed 500 pence and the other 50.
[1:32:08] and when they had nothing to pay he
[1:32:09] frankly forgave them both tell me
[1:32:12] therefore which of them will love him
[1:32:15] most
[1:32:17] what a lesson to learn
[1:32:20] here
[1:32:23] simon answered ice and said i suppose
[1:32:27] that he
[1:32:28] to whom he forgave him also
[1:32:32] and even in his judgmental spirit
[1:32:36] not being right he was able to discern
[1:32:40] that who was ever forgiven the most
[1:32:43] would love the most
[1:32:45] amen
[1:32:47] talking about abiding
[1:32:50] remaining in god's love and he said unto
[1:32:51] him thou has rightly judged and he said
[1:32:54] to the woman
[1:32:57] and he turned to the woman and said unto
[1:32:59] simon
[1:33:00] see as thou this woman i've entered into
[1:33:03] thine house thou gavest me no water for
[1:33:06] my feet but she has washed my feet with
[1:33:08] her tears
[1:33:09] and wiped them with the hairs of her
[1:33:11] head though gave us me no kiss but this
[1:33:13] woman since the time i came in have not
[1:33:16] ceased to kiss my feet
[1:33:18] my head with oil thou does not anoint
[1:33:21] but this woman have anointed my feet
[1:33:23] with anointment
[1:33:26] in simon's mind and heart now
[1:33:29] he judge
[1:33:31] correctly the situation
[1:33:34] but jesus
[1:33:37] the word
[1:33:41] had assessed
[1:33:43] what was happening in simon's heart
[1:33:45] prior
[1:33:48] where he didn't judge the situation
[1:33:51] correctly
[1:33:55] the word
[1:33:56] will always
[1:33:58] correct
[1:34:00] the air
[1:34:02] always but i tell you
[1:34:05] we can all stand testify of this i'm so
[1:34:08] glad
[1:34:09] god corrected me in love
[1:34:13] we'd nev we'd not we ought to be here
[1:34:15] today none of us would be here today we
[1:34:18] would have gave up a long time ago if it
[1:34:20] wasn't god continuing to love us
[1:34:23] regardless
[1:34:26] now notice here that jesus the word
[1:34:29] judges simon for all the love that he
[1:34:32] did not manifest
[1:34:35] so now we come to church the word is
[1:34:37] here and the word is judging simon for
[1:34:40] all the love that he did not manifest
[1:34:43] though gave us me no water for my feet
[1:34:45] thou kissed me uh thou gavest me no kiss
[1:34:48] my head with oiled out dis not anoint oh
[1:34:50] my
[1:34:52] what are the things that are missing
[1:34:55] today in our lives
[1:34:58] where what have we missed on loving one
[1:35:01] another
[1:35:05] the things that simon never thought
[1:35:07] about
[1:35:09] i wonder why because he didn't maintain
[1:35:12] a humble spirit he had a judgmental
[1:35:13] spirit upon him
[1:35:18] there simply wasn't enough love in
[1:35:20] simon's heart to want to forgive
[1:35:23] amen to cover love covers a multitude of
[1:35:27] sin
[1:35:29] jesus tells us the reason
[1:35:31] why is that he himself
[1:35:34] had not received
[1:35:37] much forgiveness
[1:35:39] and this this this thought just blows my
[1:35:42] mind out of the water
[1:35:44] that simon was not able to love much
[1:35:48] because he wasn't
[1:35:50] forgiven much
[1:35:53] now wonder why simon wasn't forgiven
[1:35:55] much was simon so perfect that he didn't
[1:35:58] need much forgiveness
[1:36:01] or was it because he didn't think
[1:36:04] he needed much forgiveness
[1:36:09] you abide in the love of god through
[1:36:12] humility
[1:36:15] wherefore
[1:36:16] i say unto thee her sins which are many
[1:36:21] are forgiven
[1:36:23] for she loved much
[1:36:26] but to whom
[1:36:29] little is forgiven the same loveth
[1:36:32] little
[1:36:33] now notice he never told simon
[1:36:36] he had little to forgive
[1:36:39] he just simply said
[1:36:41] to whom little is forgiven little loves
[1:36:46] i
[1:36:48] i think
[1:36:49] i want to spend more time asking god to
[1:36:52] forgive me
[1:36:53] to search for the things in my life
[1:36:56] and ask god to forgive me because if
[1:36:58] that becomes my clothing i feel that i'm
[1:37:01] going to fall more in love with him
[1:37:05] and he said unto her thy sins are
[1:37:07] forgiven
[1:37:09] and they that said it meet with him
[1:37:11] begin to sit with say within himself who
[1:37:13] is
[1:37:14] who is this that forgiveth sins also and
[1:37:16] he said to the woman thy faith have
[1:37:18] saved thee go in peace
[1:37:22] the more we can find to repent for the
[1:37:24] more we'll be forgiven
[1:37:26] and the more that we're forgiven the
[1:37:28] more that we'll love jesus christ
[1:37:32] the way up
[1:37:34] is down
[1:37:38] more humble
[1:37:40] it's not trying to be great to prove
[1:37:43] your love for god
[1:37:45] it's humbling yourself back
[1:37:49] humbling yourself
[1:37:51] back to god
[1:37:53] amen humbling yourself back to god
[1:37:57] find things in your life be zealous
[1:38:01] to repent
[1:38:03] think about those things the part of the
[1:38:04] problem is we don't like to think about
[1:38:07] all of our mistakes
[1:38:09] because they discourage us
[1:38:13] but to me
[1:38:15] what we're doing when we're doing that
[1:38:16] is we're interested we're showing god
[1:38:18] that we're interested in our
[1:38:19] relationship with him
[1:38:21] we're trying to build it
[1:38:23] now the prophet pulls out a golden
[1:38:26] nugget out of these scriptures here in
[1:38:27] god's gifts always find their places he
[1:38:30] said he said this woman
[1:38:32] she was so grateful that her sins were
[1:38:35] forgiven
[1:38:36] until she spent all her money that she
[1:38:40] had
[1:38:43] and she took an alabaster box and
[1:38:46] broke it and poured the oil
[1:38:48] and just
[1:38:49] odored the room with the fine smells of
[1:38:51] this myrrh and she anointed him for his
[1:38:54] death now she did this service not
[1:38:57] knowing what she was doing but
[1:39:00] she was so grateful to god
[1:39:03] think about that
[1:39:05] god doesn't always tell us
[1:39:07] what we're doing
[1:39:10] but something inside knows it's him
[1:39:14] she was so grateful brother branham says
[1:39:17] that her sins were forgiven until she
[1:39:19] spent all of her money that she had
[1:39:23] when we realize how much we've been
[1:39:25] forgiven we'll spend our life for god
[1:39:29] we'll pour it on jesus we'll pour it out
[1:39:31] for the kingdom
[1:39:33] i'm not trying to pull money but i'm
[1:39:35] pulling your life for jesus today
[1:39:41] when you keep your attitude humble
[1:39:45] don't forget what god has done for you
[1:39:49] and if you're having a hard time get
[1:39:51] alone in prayer
[1:39:53] spend time with him ask him to read to
[1:39:55] remind you
[1:39:57] start counting your blessings name them
[1:39:59] one by one it will surprise you what the
[1:40:01] lord have done before you know it an
[1:40:04] attitude of gratefulness will begin to
[1:40:06] swell up inside of you and when that
[1:40:08] gratefulness
[1:40:10] swells up and and it starts pouring out
[1:40:12] the love of god will just be coming out
[1:40:14] of you
[1:40:17] we're talking about remaining in love
[1:40:20] remaining in love
[1:40:22] if you forget first peter
[1:40:25] chapter 1 verse 8 through 10 you get a
[1:40:28] second
[1:40:29] you can write that down
[1:40:31] but if you forget
[1:40:35] the fruit of the spirit forget god
[1:40:37] living forget what god has done for you
[1:40:40] you can become barren and unfruitful the
[1:40:42] bible says
[1:40:45] so it's a calling
[1:40:49] peter says you got to give diligence to
[1:40:51] make your calling an election
[1:40:54] sure
[1:40:56] don't just say you're thankful
[1:40:59] manifest it
[1:41:02] manifest it well what do i do brother
[1:41:05] john
[1:41:06] be committed to manifest it
[1:41:09] be committed
[1:41:12] continue to be zealous about repentance
[1:41:14] in your life
[1:41:15] don't let it
[1:41:16] become a once in a day
[1:41:21] thing
[1:41:22] amen
[1:41:23] i'm like at the end of the day i'm just
[1:41:25] going to ask god to forgive me for
[1:41:26] everything i said god forgive me for
[1:41:28] everything
[1:41:29] get up and kind of go out and do your
[1:41:31] no
[1:41:33] on a regular basis lord i'm sorry for
[1:41:35] that thought
[1:41:38] that wasn't that wasn't a thought of
[1:41:39] humility that was a judgmental thought
[1:41:41] that i just had
[1:41:43] don't i don't want to be like simon
[1:41:45] i want to be like that woman
[1:41:47] who was just at the feet of jesus just
[1:41:50] loving on him because i've been forgiven
[1:41:52] so much
[1:41:54] we're talking about remaining in love
[1:41:57] with god abiding in his love through
[1:41:59] humility
[1:42:02] it's not far
[1:42:04] from us
[1:42:06] now i do have a few extra minutes today
[1:42:11] brother mark you're going to have to get
[1:42:12] going
[1:42:17] he's
[1:42:18] we gotta
[1:42:19] kick this man out of the church
[1:42:21] he's gonna go get our food
[1:42:24] you know i was talking to
[1:42:26] a minister the other day and
[1:42:29] just sharon had to deal with something
[1:42:31] that was inside the church that just
[1:42:32] wasn't right
[1:42:35] and finally had to get it out of the
[1:42:36] church
[1:42:39] and i just say we've been blessed in our
[1:42:41] little church here
[1:42:43] and not having to deal
[1:42:45] with
[1:42:46] a spirit
[1:42:47] that's trying to take over
[1:42:50] the church
[1:42:51] we're blessed
[1:42:53] we're blessed to have god the head of
[1:42:55] the church
[1:42:57] and to allow him to be the head of the
[1:42:59] church
[1:43:01] it was so sad
[1:43:03] to hear that
[1:43:05] keep
[1:43:06] yourselves in the love of god looking
[1:43:09] for what
[1:43:11] looking for the mercy
[1:43:12] of our lord jesus christ
[1:43:16] in other words
[1:43:18] god have mercy on me
[1:43:21] i'm not quite right i need to be ready
[1:43:23] lord i haven't dug you i didn't do your
[1:43:25] bidding like i should have i i'll tell
[1:43:27] you when i
[1:43:29] you know brother johnson he's up here
[1:43:31] and he's
[1:43:32] he's talking he's praying and sometimes
[1:43:34] there and he's he's in his frail body
[1:43:37] sharing that you know we just need to
[1:43:39] say a prayer that before we go to the
[1:43:41] store somewhere that we should pray god
[1:43:43] just just use me speak to me to speak to
[1:43:46] some soul
[1:43:47] i'll tell you i had that thought
[1:43:49] how many times have we
[1:43:51] tried to do something
[1:43:53] in our business and we had no concern
[1:43:55] about somebody's soul
[1:44:00] and that that that word that brother
[1:44:02] johnson spoke that was that's not
[1:44:04] brother johnson that was god that was
[1:44:06] god speaking
[1:44:08] amen
[1:44:09] he's pouring out his heart
[1:44:12] that we need to be about the father's
[1:44:14] business
[1:44:16] to remain in love with god because when
[1:44:18] you remain in love with god you just
[1:44:19] want to do his will
[1:44:21] when you lose that love you get out of
[1:44:23] that love you always you're thinking
[1:44:25] about your life
[1:44:27] that's all you think about is your life
[1:44:29] god help
[1:44:32] us want to
[1:44:36] share this last scripture with you
[1:44:39] second timothy chapter 4 verse 8
[1:44:40] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[1:44:42] crown of righteousness which the lord
[1:44:45] the righteous judge shall give me in
[1:44:46] that day and not to me only but unto all
[1:44:49] them also that love his appearing
[1:44:55] now
[1:45:06] there are so many things
[1:45:10] to help us
[1:45:11] abiding
[1:45:13] in god's love to remain in god's love
[1:45:17] but if there's one thing that we could
[1:45:20] target it was the thing that we spoke
[1:45:22] today
[1:45:24] humility
[1:45:26] god dwells with with a person who's
[1:45:29] humble who's grateful who's thankful and
[1:45:32] we're if it be the will of god we want
[1:45:33] to get in to these things of
[1:45:36] gratefulness and thankfulness
[1:45:38] because there's there's so many nuggets
[1:45:41] uh
[1:45:44] have you just ever been so grateful you
[1:45:46] just you'll just do anything
[1:45:50] have you just been so
[1:45:51] bothered with all your problems you just
[1:45:53] didn't want to do anything to help
[1:45:54] anybody
[1:45:55] [Laughter]
[1:45:58] and uh
[1:46:00] lord
[1:46:00] help us
[1:46:02] to be close with humility
[1:46:04] so we can abide in his love is this your
[1:46:07] desire
[1:46:08] just your desire know that this is not a
[1:46:11] feel good service
[1:46:14] but if it deals with your relationship
[1:46:17] with god
[1:46:18] if it provokes you to good works
[1:46:22] if it helps you with the closeness with
[1:46:25] god well then
[1:46:27] i'm i'm grateful his will is is done
[1:46:31] amen let's stand together
[1:46:58] it was like
[1:46:59] last
[1:47:00] week i had two different people from two
[1:47:02] different direct nobody to do with
[1:47:04] church
[1:47:07] but they had said
[1:47:09] um brother john oh it's talking about
[1:47:11] brother john excuse me
[1:47:13] they weren't even brothers
[1:47:15] um
[1:47:17] they were family members is that what
[1:47:19] they were
[1:47:20] and they said
[1:47:23] john is the nicest person
[1:47:27] and i thought
[1:47:30] i don't care about being nice
[1:47:34] i want to i want to be close with
[1:47:36] humility i want it to be real
[1:47:40] because if it's real you'll
[1:47:42] automatically be nice
[1:47:48] it's because it's christ in you yes
[1:47:51] so let's just take a moment
[1:47:53] yield ourselves to the lord
[1:47:56] and if this is your desire to draw
[1:48:00] close to him
[1:48:02] and he you feel that he's calling you to
[1:48:06] to put some clothes of humility on to
[1:48:08] make sure that you're dressed with more
[1:48:09] of those and just yield to the lord make
[1:48:12] make
[1:48:13] that commitment to him because look
[1:48:16] this is not a force manipulative type of
[1:48:18] situation this is all about god making
[1:48:21] the invitation to his bride
[1:48:24] and it's uh it's up to us whether we
[1:48:26] want to step at it individually and if
[1:48:28] we don't well that's fine but perhaps
[1:48:30] for those that want to let's just take a
[1:48:32] few minutes before we have our
[1:48:33] fellowship
[1:48:35] with with one another we gotta wait for
[1:48:36] the food to come back anyways
[1:48:38] that's why we kicked brother mark house
[1:48:40] to go get the food
[1:48:42] amen
[1:48:46] let's sing um
[1:48:48] mercy rewrote my life
