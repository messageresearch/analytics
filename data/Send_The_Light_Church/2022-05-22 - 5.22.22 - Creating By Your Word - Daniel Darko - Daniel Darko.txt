the word lord god may we have communion in it lord we love you we praise you in jesus name this morning amen hallelujah and there's such a peace being in the presence of the lord and i'm thankful that there is everybody can be in his presence i think the bible says it like this to whomsoever will let him come but we have to come we have to we have to reach out to him and the more that we yield the more we empty out the more he comes so it's it's kind of like i always say church is like a trading post you come and you empty out the more you empty out the more you give of yourself the more you open up for the lord we had a wonderful time with brother daniel and sister rita yesterday at frankenmuth and anybody that's ever been to frankenmuth knows you you don't leave frank and move hungry but after we got done eating at frankenmuth there was just no way we could sit down and have another meal you understand what i'm saying we got to empty out and be out so the lord can have his way among us this morning amen amen well we we wanted sister rita to come up here we've asked her to sing a couple songs but i i haven't asked her but i'd like to ask her now if she would no i did ask her about the songs but i'd like her to share a testimony as well just to praise the lord give a testimony whatever be on your heart we just want you to take a few minutes and and and do that for the lord amen amen amen he's been so good um i want to start from my marriage i got married in 1995 but the lord knew what he was going to do for me it took me 10 years before i got my first child you have to get patience you have to give everything to the lord at his own time he will bless you and when the blessing is coming it comes in abundance i was pregnant for almost three three weeks to a month and i didn't know i was pregnant because it was the lord who gave it to me the doctors didn't even know that i was pregnant after all the lab tests i did and all that almost a month because i was still taking my drugs waiting on the lord waiting on the lord when it came the doctors were surprised they were asking me did you know you were pregnant i said no i didn't know i didn't know after one month before the lord blessed me the doctors got to know after the lab test i got my boy who was named zephaniah o furry darko the meaning is the lord shall be praised because it is only to him i give the praise to i wait just for three months and then my work will spoil i have to sit home and then after the birth of the fanaya the law started opening more avenues i now work with the department of state i wrote the application i just forgot about it they were calling me for two weeks i was not picking the call they kept on calling me that i should come for my interview just one day i took up my phone and the call just came at the same time i received the call said madam why don't you want to work and i asked please who are you he said i'm calling from the american embassy in accra we've been calling you for two weeks and you are not picking your call i said madam please i'm very sorry where are you they called me i went for my exams they were asking me when do you want to come for your interview it never happens they would rather tell you you are coming for interview on this day but they asked me when do you want to come for your interview i said wow well i arranged with them i went for the interview then they asked we need you to work so you rather tell us when you want to start working i said wow god it is you i don't know anytime you want me to start they said okay get this go and do your medicals do these goodies when everything is done just come i went to the interview they asked me a lot of questions frankly before god a man i didn't know the answers i gave them it

[Laughter] amen [Applause] now if we were at a concert we would probably say well i i didn't i'd rather go to a different concert but we're not at a concert and that's the beautiful thing about all of our hearts we can worship god from the dictates of our heart and god receives it we don't need to give the okay for god for for somebody else to worship the lord and we just are so grateful that there's liberty here amen to worship the lord from the dictates of our heart we don't have to feel out of place in fact when somebody's worshiping the lord it should make us feel right at home it should make us feel home well we're going to ask our brother daniel darko to come and give us the wonderful words of life to us as our brother is coming i just want to share a need that they have in in case you would like to pray for the need there in ghana uh they're um are renting and they've got uh a piece of property that's about two-thirds paid for already and they want to pay the rest of it off and start building and right now they got about 120 people 120 130 people coming to their church half of them are inside that's all they can fit another half are sitting outside um kind of through the windows and things and having church like that and there's people that have come they they stay and then they leave because they don't have much of a place so if we could just join together with our brother that god would supply the need that they could have a building for all the people in that area amen god bless you brother daniel let's stand together we appreciate our brother he's just a fine fine spirit and this man if you would ever have him we appreciate brother mark having him at his his home this man and his his wife they would never ask for one thing nor would they ever complain about one thing and to me this is a huge testimony a huge testimony for the bride of christ brother daniel come give us the words of life we just appreciate our brother amen and and you you have to and god bless you you have to interpret what your wife was saying she said amen let's bow down heads for prayer grace yourself believe father we thank you this morning father your grace have found us again this day thank you for this day that you have made for us west say that we should live in it and rejoice father we are rejoicing because of what you made us to be we are rejoicing all gold because of the pitches of salvation on mount calvary before the foundation of the world we are rejoicing because you have revealed yourself to us in this end time we are rejoicing because of all the things oh god that you are doing for us spiritually fiscally financially socially materially and law we acknowledge every bit of it this morning we say receive the glory as you've given this opportunity to assemble again father in thy service continue to be with us oh lord let your spirit come down or father use me to speak your word to your people and lord jesus let it go and manifest what you have send it for the lord your name will be glorified we thank god bless you for all that you are doing lord in jesus christ and we pray amen let's take our city well we are happy again to be together in the house of god david said i was glad when they told me let's go to the house of god indeed when you come to the house of god there is liberty and there is healing there is progress there are sources there is joy hallelujah so therefore the bible say that we should always enter into his gate with thanksgiving in our hearts well um i think my sister said i should give the interpretation to the song that he sang bible said when somebody speaks in tongues there has to be somebody to interpret so i am very grateful to the lord today i'm going to be the interpreter of the speaking in tongues well that song that she just sang says that all things will pass away kingdoms will pass away but the word of god will abide forever and for that matter he is god amen he doesn't change so we bow down and we worship him that is all the interpretation let's give club to the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah yeah indeed everything is passing away whether we like it or not everything nations kingdoms are rising and breaking what is nebuchadnezzar kingdom today where is alexander the greatest kingdom where is the medications and even the kingdom that is governing the world now is passing away gradually by the word of god and for that matter the people of god we will abide forever amen so we don't have any cause but to praise and to magnify him always hallelujah well before we go into the word of god then there are some a few missionary reports i want to give to you as your the church brother john as the captain of the ship hallelujah i don't know how to put it i'm not a sailor so i wouldn't know how to put it this year in the the what do we call it the seer of the ship hallelujah we've been able by god's grace continue to go on mission trip locally and this uh in fact forgot the previous previous pictures are supposed to have brought them but i forgot them as it was um oversight so the these are the current one that we've been this is a church about two and a half hours from where i live and they have benefited from the bible amen uh fortunately i'll go back to that side fortunately when i went there there were some new people in the church for the first time and when they heard the word of god they were really touched and this woman is one of them and she immediately asked for the bible hallelujah and so yeah that is that is the pastor standing by there amen we can go to the second one yeah this church have previously received the supply but then new people came again and they have to get it so that place too is about almost three hours from where i live yeah yeah they are also pressing on let's go to the nest now this it's a church um remember he gave send me some money for that church they bought a land and it was not enough for the church so they were looking for a place close to them it belongs to someone but they were able to negotiate and the owner sold the land to them and they didn't have money so i remember i called you and swiftly you send money to help them and so there's the land that they have purchased yeah so now they have i mean a little vast land that they can put their building and they can get some place to do other things yeah that is a pastor over there and i think you know this man yeah that's the pastor over there and uh this was one of my deacon in the church that i do travel with he is no more addicting because he has resigned anyway so that is the pastor and this is the structure that you have started so we are praying to the lord jesus christ that gradually but the last time he told me that they have already moved because they've been able to roof it and they have started worshiping over there amen yeah yeah that is the structure so these are the structures they have roof we have removed the structure and i think they have cemented the ground so they they just worship under the sheep like that yeah okay and this is another these new people that came to my church and they need the bible to i give to them yeah yeah yeah yeah that's that's a member of my church also there's another brother in the church he also came from about um five hours five hours drive from one city to where we are and when he's a student anyway so he didn't have money to buy bible so i have to he came for the bible and i gave to him yes yes so let's go on this tattoo in same situation yeah this is uh um a place called encounter in our country it's about 327 kilometers away from where i live and this is the pasta here yeah they put up a structure and he called me to dedicate it for them and they were they were the people that were in the church we needed the bible and by god's grace uh we had a consignment and we gave to them so that is also another church over there there's another church there's about a two and a half hour drive from my place they also have benefited from the bible yeah yeah okay these are some of the bible that you are seeing now on the screen yeah that man is was on mission trip ready to share the bible to the brethren and i hope you remember that man amen okay all right yeah so that is the brother there's the pastor pastor enoch yeah these are his members some of his members of course they also needed the bible and then we made sure that i will give to them yeah and this is also about 274 kilometers from where i live there's the pastor pastor anani and these are members and though there are many but these were the people that needed the bible so we have supplied them with the bible in fact one thing is that in a place that we go when they get the bible they are very happy they are very happy you know people people always there was here something happened and i was very very i laughed because when after i gave the bible out then there was one sister who came through pastor i didn't get some because that concern when the moment i give it i reserve the rest for another church so when i contact those who requested i make sure i'll give the figure but this was a sister that after i have given the bibles out there she came calling me oh pastor i didn't get my bible i said oh where were you did you ask for it he said no and when i looked to the sister he was a dickens wife who was preparing food for me to eat so i couldn't review sir i couldn't refuse it so i had no option but other than that i would eat [Laughter] isaan will you will you go to the next picture yeah yeah and that that was the sister that was the dickens wife who chased me for the bible and because of that these two these three also came around and i couldn't refuse them because i have already given to the the deacon's wife so yeah they also had this yeah let's go to the next picture yeah this also um about 259 kilometers from where i live and here that is the pastor also standing at the corner there they also had um what we call it um yeah their supply they also had their supply i was very happy when i visited them because they were equally happy and uh we we had a good time over there so yeah that is it yeah the next yeah this is just about an hour drive from where i live and this is a pastor here and these are the members who were looking for the bible and the way you look to your faces you read that they were very happy especially look at this man here he was smiling with all his teeth because he was happy that you have got the word of god amen hallelujah so yes is there any other that is it all right so we will say god bless you bro john and the church for supporting us in this mission work there are a lot more to do but in all we pray for the lord jesus christ to bless you and to strengthen us also so that together we will expand the kingdom of god god bless all of you amen now after that then uh we want to go to business now um as we turn our scriptures this morning to first kings chapter 17. is there any question about the mission work before maybe we continue no question god bless you we are reading um 1st kings chapter 17 verse 1 and we read matthew chapter 17 verse 20. first king chapter 17 verse one and elijah the tishbite who was of the inhabitants of gillette said unto here as the lord god of israel leaveth before whom i stand there shall not be due nor rain these years but according to my word matthew chapter 17 verse 20 and jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if ye have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hands beyond that place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you the lord add his blessing to the reading of his word amen let's take our seat god bless all of you let me appreciate our noble senior brother pastor samuel johnson yeah i am happy that he is sitting and i'm preaching for him to hear because when they were preaching we were youth we we were not even in the message we came to the message before we heard of them and i'm always happy when i meet veterans like that god bless you brother samuel johnson i'm very happy the first time i met him was when brother josiah picked me from here he was taking me to um rapport yeah and we passed by his church i didn't know i didn't know in fact the moment brad johnson had that i'm around he requested that i should preach and in fact i was i was taken aback because i was not i didn't know that i was going to be called upon to preach so i couldn't do that and i i apologize but he gave me the opportunity to read the church yeah yeah so i'm happy today john said that we have met again god bless you sister god bless you amen yeah so this morning we want to speak on creating by your word creating by your word um i would say the second part of last um wednesdays someone will preach here but those of you who were not in church and the title was look unto jesus but i'm not going to preach that and we just want to continue amen creating by your word and in fact i always say that when i am preaching to you you must also preach to me amen because i don't do the preaching alone i pray to you and you preach to me by you responding to amen where you need to respond to amen hallelujah creating by your word now the bible said west are spirits is that yes west are spirit and that is why christians you must always be careful what comes out from your mouth because it can be a case and it can be a blessing upon someone that is why we are always seasoned when we want to speak and we speak nothing but the glorious ways of the kingdom amen and amen so whatever you are whatever you do whatever you say make sure that it isn't amen amen hallelujah you know by god's word he created all things amen one day well sometimes the science scientists for that matter you see them writing so many things that the world has been existing 72 000 million years and all that sometimes they say 80 million years but we have a prophet and we know what time he told us amen that this world has you know stood hallelujah so no scientist can confuse us but what i'm trying to say is that when we are talking about our god nobody can determine how many years he existed before one day he got up and said let there be and when he said let there be there was amen it was out of his word that created the heavens and the earth when he said let there be light the light came up and the bible said that he created man after all his creation man was the only creation that he created in his image the trees the fowls the beasts on the field none of them were in the likeness of god but man and so when god created man he gave him the ability of creation that adam could have created yes in fact the bible account says that all the creation was named by adam so you realize that he had the power to do everything that would be in line of god's word but something happened and that creative power left him right in fact the prophet said that adam could have told these three move i don't like where you are standing go and situate yourself here and the tree has to obey adam because of that creative power the lord put in him now but after sin came into the garden of eden man lost that ability adam loved that ability and he became so miserable and even the garden the precious gardener god made for him and his wife god sucked them from the garden and they started suffering they started working hard before they could find ends meet and i'm sure that adam didn't like that idea but there was nothing he could do about it now let me ask you a question before i continue everybody know in this world that america is the number one nation is that not it well there is there is i mean let's say freedom enjoyment and peace and all that that is why millions and millions and millions of people from other nations always want to come to america go on to the emergencies and you see how many applications for visas that are piled over there everybody wants to come to america because america is sweet we have ice cream here we have pizza here we have hamburger here yesterday brad jonas is a cheryl and sister i'm too curious to uh have i don't pronounce those uh that place well what's the name frank franken frankfurman we enjoy ourselves very well in a gentleman who i have never been to german before but of acting german fruit can you imagine that everything is okay here so everybody want to come here now let me ask a question will you be happy if they will tell you move from america and go and live in one of these poor nations will you be happy about that certainly not yes i am not sure you'll be happy and so that was the condition of adam after he was sat from the garden he became so miserable he was not happy he has lost his his joy he has lost his power he has lost his ability to create so he became so miserable and brother and sister do you know have you ever sat down to realize that as much as adam was so miserable in that condition god was also miserable amen because god also lost his fellowship the bible said at the cool of the day he always descended into the garden and he have con fellowship with adam but when adam was sat from the garden that fellowship broke so adam was not happy god was also not happy god was miserable and god didn't want it that way so god found another way to restore that solution back amen and one day there was a man called abram whom was in his father's home he only heard a voice abraham come from among your people and he did he did that by faith because he didn't know which god was speaking to him he only had a voice and by faith he followed the voice hallelujah and we know that when god called abraham he put in him faith and that was the faith that restored man back to that creative power hallelujah we can talk about enoch we can talk about noah hallelujah whom god used to build the ark okay cannot imagine that even human being refused to to lift him to the call but noah spoke to animals and they entered into the act for safety so now when god called the abram he said abram comes from among your people and he obeyed and you put in him faith and watch it this way that all that abraham went through was just a test but nothing none of these tests made him to fail i remember when he was living even though god didn't ask him to you know add a lot to it but he allowed lord to go with him anyhow and it came to a point when the uh cattles and their sheep and those things were being increased they became contention between adam servants and that of lots and i'm sorry i said adam i'm talking about abram and abraham call lord you say lord now our animals are increasing day by day and that is why our servants are you know at loggerheads now separate yourself from me look we have so many you know vegetations that if you go to the east i'll go to the west if you go to the north i'll go to the south pick choose lot didn't say that oh uncle you are the elder make your choice first he didn't do that well well i don't know about america but when you go come to ghana africa always elders first yes when you are eating with the elder and you go for fish they will knock you yes they will knock your head you don't respect the elder has to break the fish i give to you i don't know about that but lord the bible said that he looked where the vegetation was green and he picked that one he didn't consider his elderly uncle and abraham told you that where you are picked it there's danger there but he didn't listen steve naked hallelujah love did not lift him he picked that place anyhow and when he left there was a trouble there was trouble one day that there were some five kings who mounted up together and they attacked sodom and gomorrah they killed people and lord and his family were taken captive and the bible said that a man escaped and came to abram and told abram what has happened but now when abram had this information someone who said that well i told him not to go and he didn't mind me but abram didn't do that abraham didn't do that but the bible said that he organized the the men the men in his house they were about i think 2018. he trained him and he said whether you know how to walk or not we are going to war hallelujah and then he went with this 318 men the bible said that he pursued the five kings he them he conquered them and he rescued his lord nephew and his household what can do such a miracle it is by faith because there was no way that 318 men are going to fight five nations for them to conquer but he did it anyhow and he came with a lot they were rejoicing and the bible said that while they were coming on the way they met a man amen and the man's name was melchizedek was so happy that abram has won that battle in fact the prophet he pulled one of the bodies in heaven and he jumped inside and he came as a human to meet abram on the way because that was the only thing he could do mercy said that up to today philosophers intellectuals and what we call them um bible scholars theologians still don't know who merkel zedek was and they cannot know hallelujah they cannot know because mercy was not an ordinary person mexican was not an ordinary man the bible said that he has no father he has no mother he are not beginning of days or ending of days but the theologians don't know him but thank god when the seals were open we got to know that melchizedek is no one but god almighty he descended say abram oh my you are so wonderful this that you have done praise be the most high god in fact let's read it in genesis chapter 14. genesis chapter 14. and verse 18 and mercy sadiq king of salem brought forth bread and wine and he was the priest of the most high god oh and he blessed him and said blessed be abram of the most high god possessor of heaven and earth blessed you see because abraham became an overcomer mexico gave him communion and when you are child of god when you overcome the sin of this world when you refute the sin of this world when you break the chains of this world you have the right to command with god that is the reason why we take the last supper and drink the wine because we are overcomers in fact beloved let me say tonight or this morning if you are not taking let it be that short that you are an overcomer break the chance of unbelief and dine with your master done with the lord because mercy said introduce it in the beginning and now after this then melchizedek being god formed another way and met abraham and gave him a promise because he knew that abraham was living without a child abraham was childish churchill's but in the mind of god there has to be a promise or there was a promise god knew that he was going to make a nation out of abraham and so the situation of abraham at that time did not confuse god but then god came down and gave him a promise that a year by this time according to the time of life you have a child by your wife sarah well when you read some place in the bible abraham laughed god didn't say anything but another time when he said the same thing and sarah laughed god questioned why did sarah laugh you see that different two different ways someone laughed god didn't say anything but under one last god question amen because the laughter of abraham was faith he knew that surely the lord would not stand by his word but the woman doubted with the god knew that the woman doubted that is why he questioned praise be the name of our god and when this thing was said from that day abraham became a changed man he knew that the wife was 19 years old how can it be possible but he accepted it anyhow and like the prophet dramatized this he said from that the first man came and abram asked sarah sarah how do you feel he said sarah said well the same old story and everyone said bless the lord there shall be a performance can you imagine abraham an old man who everybody knew who have gone on childless who enter into um shops well back home we call it madake i don't know how you call it in america here where they sell um children item you know those things yes abraham will enter and ask for baby food he will ask for baby diaper he will ask for baby towels and people look at this old man what are you grabbing this for he said yes my wife is expecting they will look at abraham and they will laugh because to them it will be impossible but abraham was turning upon the word of god amen abraham was allowing his word to create he said bless the lord it will be amen amen and amen no matter how the people in all disbelief no matter how they put doubt no matter how the people look on you let your word become the creative power oh hallelujah amen and amen and one day when abraham asked sarah sarah how do you feel today he said well today i felt something unusual the first time in my life something is moving within my my belly i don't know what it is then abraham held her hand he asked him to be a doctor and he felt his for her pause he said no the promise of god has made manifested amen there is something that has taken place in your womb that what promise of god that you are going to have the child it has begun amen oh hallelujah speak the word my brother my sister and there shall be a performance of your word amen amen and we all know that story that sarah gave birth to isaac and isaac became a blessing to all of us and now this melchizedek in the old testament when you come to this new testament he is the lord jesus christ in fact when you read about account in hebrews the way paul explained it you realize that with that term creative power he came on this earth even though people said that well the people look on him and they said well it's joseph's son it depends upon what you are looking for if you want to look on jesus and see joseph's son you will see him if you want to look on jesus and you you want to see a bell you see you want to see jesus you want to look on jesus for you to see an illegitimate child you will see him and if you want to look on jesus to see the almighty god you will see him it depends upon how you are looking for hallelujah but when paul anointed by the holy spirit yes when you look on jesus christ that day he saw that he was the mercy deck who met abraham on the way and he gave him communion with that creative power with that unfailing promise one day the bible said that he was walking with the disciples and they came to see a blind man the bible said that he was born blind and the disciples were the one who asked jesus christ a question it's a master who did sin in this man or his parents but listen to the answer that jesus gave he said this man was born blind not the sin of the parents or he himself but he was born blind that the glory of god might be made manifest hallelujah you see beloved that is why many many times we have to stop complaining because look what that will like it or not god knows the affairs that concern his children anything that will go through god is already aware of it it all is to his glory brother sister we have to understand that sometimes we may not like the situation sometimes we may cry on the situation sometimes we may rejoice on the situation but you know it is to the glory of our creator hallelujah amen he said not the man not the parents but the glory of god might be made manifest and the bible said that after he said that he spat on the on the ground and he used the spittle to form a clay and anoint the eye of the man oh hallelujah the prophet said that we consider existing elements and he said at home they put a potassium and something something something petroleum and cosmic light and all that they were all in us they are all in us in fact i don't know the type of clay god used in creating my nose i cannot determine the type of clay he used in making my ear i cannot determine what he used to make my leg or my belly which i stopped foot inside i don't know but i believe that that day when jesus met the blind man and he looked on the ground he realized that the type of clay that he used in making the eye of the man was there oh hallelujah and he spot on that and you use it and another i said go and watch yes the man went on watch and he saw [Music] the pharisees should have praised god for this but because of the way they are looking to jesus they doubted amen they refused to believe and they called this man they questioned the man the man said well after me i don't know him whatever you say the only thing i know once i was blind but now i can see hallelujah so who are those who are criticizing the message of this hour who are those who are condemning the message of this hour whether they condemn it or not one thing that i know was i was a sinner but now i am a believer [Applause] last wednesday i was telling you how we came into the message we were pentecostal believers need we need we knew nothing but about speaking in tongues but we couldn't live a christian life it was bunch of hypocrisy hallelujah but that day i said that day when the lord jesus met us in the face of this message oh brother sister something different happened to our experience we realize that not knowing we have not even started christianity yet so it was the opening of this message that put us into christianity so i don't care whoever will say this that is that once i was blind but now i can see hallelujah that day on the mountain after elijah have spoken about three years he said so long as i live as the prophet of god on this land there are not going to be any rain nor do that will fall until i call for it and the moment elijah said that god locked the heavens no rain do you know why he said that because he was on line of duty amen he was standing in the foot of jesus christ for that matter he locked the heavens so when they were suffering here and there oh brother even it affected elijah himself he locked the heavens and god said that go i'll let some bed feed you and god made beds to feed elijah and he came to a time the best could not bake the bread any longer they were shocked they had shortage of flour so elijah was going hungry can we imagine that then god told elijah rajon go to the widow the widow didn't have anything but god didn't care about that he said go to that widow you see god sometimes put us into a situation that in human thinking it will not be sensible but if you are a child of god and you have strengthened your years to follow the commandment of god you don't have to complain hallelujah it's unbelievable why should elijah go to the widow who didn't have anything and even he said i don't have anything to eat this thing that i'm breaking is i have what a muscle of uh what do we call it yes and i'm going to prepare it for myself and my son and we and we die because that was their last hope elijah said well go and do it but make sure you give to me first he was standing instead of god and everything that you do beloved make sure god is first the prophet said that don't never make god second in your life never make god second he said everything that you do make god first let god be first hallelujah and then a time came that elijah has to meet uh after ahab has come all the regions and have not found him like i said well today i'm going to show myself so he told obadiah go and tell you again today he will see me and then he told him today we will not stand upon double opinions if baal is god let us prove it if jehovah god is the god of the israelites let us prove it but this is how we are going to do it let all the bad prophets meet me on mount carmel and we are going to ask the god that will answer by fire to be the god of the israelites and they assembled all about prophets elijah said well take up your your sacrifice and do the sacrifice because you are many i'm alone and they prepare their sacrifice and uh you know this bad prophet started chanting they were calling on bar they called them back they called them back they called them ba ba was nowhere to to to come what they call and call and call and call and call then illegal started to mock them he said look call him call call call bow because perhaps he has gone to he has gone to little uh little caesar he's going to buy pizza so call call call call call call balwell they call and call uncle say oh no no wait wait wait wait maybe paul has gone to a dq he's going to get some ice cream so call call call call call and they called and called and called the bible said that then they started cutting themselves with knives you know why because sometimes they sacrifice human beings they knew they thought that baal needed blood of human that moment before he would respond they cut themselves with knife and still there was nowhere to be found hallelujah they didn't know that could under no circumstance come to that mountain listen not that they didn't know what they were doing they were always calling for baal and baal responded to them but that day bow did not respond their reason was that god was standing on the mountain hallelujah where elijah was standing god was standing today where you stand god also stand there as a child of god so bad didn't come then elijah said well in fact the bible said i went it was getting to the evening sacrifice time like i said oh wait it's okay now your bowel didn't answer you stay aside now step back and the bible says that elijah prepared the altar with 12 stones he built the altar and he killed the sacrifice and he requested for 12 barrels of water to wash the sacrifice and he said lord i've spoken this thing in your name let there be creation amen immediately fire come down from heaven burn all the sacrifice bend the stone and lick all the water around it and the people started praising god the bible said that they said oh god is god god is god and they worship the god of elijah now all the bad prophets were dumbfounded they didn't know what to do they wanted to escape elijah said no don't allow any of them to escape kill all of them and elijah kill all of them that is why today we kill every unbeliever in our life anything that rise against gods when we kill it hallelujah let your word kill everything that is contrary to the word of god oh praise be the name of our god by the word of elijah jezebel was killed amen yes sir by the word of elijah jezebel was killed today let your word also kill jezebel in your life let your word kill unbelief in your life let your word kill sickness in your life let your word create something amen that will be a blessing to you in your life amen amen one day when god has made pharaoh so stubborn and moses have rotted so many plagues in the land of egypt then we all know the final plague the death of the firstborns of the egyptians and that was so much for for pharaoh now pharaoh said well now get out from my land and go and worship your god i would say that they left but they came face to face with another obstacle and that was the red sea amen oh believe us once upon a time in our lives we also face situations like that sometimes you come and face an obstacle and you don't know what to do but it should not be believers of today we have so many examples in the bible that we look on to build our faith some of them didn't have anybody to look on but thank god we have so many they came facified with the red sea and the people of israel started crying against god and moses they have forgotten the salvation that god rotted in egypt for their sake the moment they felt that obstacle it it occurred to them that there was no god and that should not be any believer today anything that comes away don't never allow the devil to put that in your mind amen because it will defeat your faith why moses is it not this we told you that allow us to be servant for the egyptians moses are there no graves in egypt that you have brought us yet to die on the wilderness this were some of the questions the children of israel asked moses because they have came they have come first filled with the red sea they don't know how to cross and more so they have seen pharaoh and his soldiers coming chasing them oh brother when the situation is coming don't look to the situation but look to your god if you look to the situation you'll fail if you look to the situation you'll be discouraged if you look to the situation you'll be sad but don't look to the situation but look to the god that have called you and they wept and they cried and cried and cried until moses himself started crying oh moses but there and then the amazing god who always know how to deliver his people from trials and temptations the bible says that then when the soldiers of egyptians were getting close he placed the pillar of fire right between them the egyptian could not cross over to attack the israelites did they know that god was going to do that they did never know but god knew that he was going to do that that is why the troubles the problem that rise in your way don't never look to it but look beyond that that god is able and more than able to do exiting abundantly then what even we ask him for and moses himself started to cry oh god how am i going to do for these people to be saved how am i going to do for her to crawl the red sea let's read exodus chapter 14 quickly now exodus chapter 14. and verse 10 and when pharaoh drew nine are you with me the children of israel lifted up their eyes and behold the egyptians marched after them and they were so afraid oh my for your sake for your sake israel for your sake god turned the rivers of egypt into blood they could not drink but down in goshen you were drinking fresh water for your sake god made frogs to come from nowhere to disturb the egyptians for your sake look or scheme destroy their plants for your sake egypt were into total darkness for three days and the bible said that you could even felt in the darkness amen for your sake fellows first born and the firstborn of all them died for your sake why then should you come and complain because you are facing red sea now and say when they saw the egyptian match after them and they were so afraid and the children of israel cried out unto the lord and they said unto moses because there were no graves in egypt had thou taken us away to die in the wilderness wherefore her thou dealt thus with us to carry us fought out of egypt they were even blaming moses now for coming out from bondage for coming out from slavery verse 12 is not this the word that we did tell thee in egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the egyptians for it had been better for us to serve the egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness oh god have mercy verse 13 and muslims said unto the people fear yeah not stand still and see the salvation of the lord which he will show to you today for the egyptians whom ye have seen today ye shall see them again no more forever verse 14 the lord shall fight for you and you will hold your peace the troubles the problems it is god's own fight and not your fight the only thing is that stand still and see look to the salvation of our god amen verse 15 and the lord said unto moses wherefore christ died unto me speak unto the children of israel that they go forward so it means moses himself was also crying in all the quote that he was telling them that go forward and we see the salvation of the lord he was crying and god said moses why are you crying amen tell your people to god forward go forward away in front of them was the red sea god where are they going are you thinking about it there is there is red sea and you say they should go forward where are they going to go but god said go forward he knew what he was talking about he said tell them to go forward and today we tell ourselves let's go forward irrespective of any challenges let's go forward amen amen for our god that we serve there is nothing that is impossible just speak the word he said tell them in other words speak tell them to go forward hallelujah amen but lift down up thy road and set out thy hand over the sea and divide it and the children of israel shall go on a dry ground through the midst of the sea hallelujah go forward and stretch forth your road on the sea amen and your the children of israel will go on a dry ground below that let us pause a little and let's ask ourselves question that god said they will go through the red sea on a dry ground how can that be possible the waters that has been over there since creation you and i cannot determine the volume of the mud even when it rains for just five minutes look the way the grounds become slippery and these waters has been there since creation we cannot determine the volume of the mind but god said don't walk on the great ground just speak to the word and when moses spoke the word and struck for the road and the sea it patted into two and israel walk on a dry ground oh hallelujah we are walking on dry grounds no matter what we are walking on dry grounds the lord have dried the muddy water for us and that's our victory because of our faith in him amen they walk on a dry ground now when they what they were crossing and the egyptian soldiers tried to follow them what happened you see their people did not reason for the sake of israel look at how god have turned egypt upside down and now today for the first time you have seen the arrested pattern and the people of god walking through it you're an unbeliever you want to walk through it also you don't value your life why does israel walk on a dry ground and cross when they wanted to pass through the river or the water any place that they step a turn into mud and they place egypt's step it turned into bad and the bible said that god came down and removed the arterial wheel and so they were going just like this and they were not able to catch the israelites and they cross over then god released the waters again and it swallowed all of them up that is the god that we are serving hallelujah that is the almighty god that we are serving no matter what we face no matter what comes our way we know that we are serving that yes god and he is able to turn the situation around for it to favor us amen oh brother sister will you speak the word this morning will you speak the word this morning like the last wednesday we were talking about the woman with the blood issue for 12 good years from one hospital to another the physicians could not solve a problem but one day when jesus and the disciples came around the woman allowed her word to make a creation of healing for her nobody advised her but she said if i could touch the hem of his garment i'll be made whole amen didn't advise the woman but john did not advise the woman but lamar did not advise the woman but the woman herself she made her own word to create healing amen and he indeed touched the hand of jesus and the baptism immediately she was made oh until the pull of that healing affected the strength of jesus christ he could not stand he said peter someone have touched me hey peter said oh master ah there are a lot of people who have touched you by the way and here why are you complaining he said peter i know many people have touched me but this touch that i am talking about is a different touch this is a touch of healing this is the touch of revelation because virtue has gone out of me right the woman could not hide and she owned herself up jesus christ look at the woman it's a woman your faith has made you free your faith not mindful by yours has made you free and the woman was indeed set free that day oh brother jesus said in matthew that if we can speak to the mountain and don't doubt the mountain will obey us hallelujah he says because of your unbelief for verily i say unto you if you have faith as the grain of mustard seed yes shall say unto this mountain remove hands to yonder please and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you sometimes we forget whom god has made us to be and sometimes we cherish our situation more than our faith we raise our situation more than our faith and that is what is setting us back but as people of god let us be aware that the power which is invested in the word of god will never lose that power as he gave to the early believers that power he gave to peter john andrew and the rest that power he gave to paul that power he gave to arenas that power he gave to martin that power he gave to columba that power he gave to uh martin luther that power he gave to john wesley that power he gave to william mariam abraham that power is given to you the same god hallelujah when the prophets are not here we still worship god hallelujah when they are not here the spirit of god is the guide when moses was taken away joshua didn't lead that move to the promised land he led them and the prophet said that today joshua is the holy spirit and the holy spirit is nothing but god so we are with god and god is with us he said that day you know that i am in the father the father in me are in you and you in me amen amen hallelujah with him or things are possible one time let me tell you a story before i continue i hope my time is not yet up yeah since uh i came the last time 2019 2020 i was not here 2021 i was not here so i'm adding all okay mixing it all up amen praise be the name of our god the prophet and some of the brethren went on square i mean hunting they come all over the place they didn't get in the game and at this time he has separated himself from the rest then he said he heard that voice say you can speak i know you like squirrel and you know scream was the favorite of the prophet if you are not tasted square before you do not understand the prophet but those of us who have got opportunity to taste squirrel will understand why the prophet said that it was his favorite because he's good very sweet hallelujah he said that the voice said that speak you will get squirrel you can speak them into existence he said initially he was he said god is at you there was no answer he waited for a while and the voice came again you can speak squirrel into existence the prophet said then he wiped his face to to i mean ascertain whether it was real not that he doubted no because he has been hearing the voice all along well god if that is you then i want one of the squirrels to come upon brother james head i am using that as just an example okay so the prophet wait yes said i want one on brother mark i'm sorry i said bro james bro mark said we didn't know time there was a squirrel down there buy sweat hallelujah then the prophet said i want one also on the head of la james good friend amen and i want one brother roger's head he asked for three then lo and behold the screen was brother mark's head and he shot it he waited for some minutes then he saw the other one also um jim's head and he shot it power amen then he saw another one on sister richard's head and even he said that that that ring was even closer than the rest he shot it and he missed it he shot it and he missed it he shot it and he said what how can i miss amen such a close range hallelujah then some few minutes went by then you saw another one on brother james brother roger's head he aim it and he shot it yes then you ask yourself a question here why is it that the one guy he asked i'm sorry the one that he saw on the head of cesarita which was even closer he missed that one bro john let's ask ourselves that question the answer was that the prophet requested by his word one on brahma's head one umbrella james head and one umbrella roger's head the one that he saw over there he didn't request for it that is why he missed that one but if anyone that he requested they came exactly on the spot this word created and your word today can create if only you have that kind of faith hallelujah amen and amen oh brother sister god said in here that i will shake the world i will shake the world and god is shaking the world no matter what god is shaking the world here and there and people are making becoming confused god is shucking the world here and there and people are afraid god is shaking the world here and there you and i you and i the people of god we are certain that no wind will blow on this earth no storm will raise nothing can shake our faith but we are standing on a solid rock amen preach the name of our god moses spoke peace into existence elijah spoke this into existence and brown sparked things into existence and today you can speak amen things into existence when you speak do you know what you have done you put god into action anything that you say by the word of god you put god into action when we lay our hands upon the sick and we pray we put god into action hallelujah whatever desires that we ask when we pray we put god into action amen when you go on a mission field you put god into action amen when you do look at evangelism preaching to people telling people about jesus christ you put god into action amen and by that word he will make creation out of it amen let me quote something from the prophet okay don't worry don't be scared i'm not preaching three hours i am quoting from the message things all things are possible just gospel trying to hide behind some kind of a church doctrine instead of coming out and saying you ain't got no faith that is all satan never received the holy ghost you don't got nothing then to give you faith it is god that god the faith and just as you are filled with with god you are filled with faith thank god if you are the son of god you are like god and you can say amen here if you want or you didn't hear that let me go back i don't want to tell you to say amen before you say amen he says if you are the son of god or for that matter a daughter of god you are like god amen that's it god bless you bro amen he just speaks the word and it creates itself yes sir amen his words the creative power how would the world come here he made it out of things which were not he just said that let there be and here it is yes he believed his own word and as we have been made into the image of god let us believe what we say [Music] let us believe what we claim amen hallelujah a brother gave us a testimony when we came around now he's electrician and the lord is raising his business to higher ground and there was a shop that they put it on how do you call it uh oh there's a word there's a word that a function auction is that a word yes and they said that the targeted 800 000 and the brother said he looked at the shop and he read that if he get it for his business it will help him so he pray to the lord say lord in your name i want to claim this this this this shot right eight hundred thousand anything he does he don't have that eight hundred thousand right and so he called the oceania and he bid it you know how much he asked he said i will give hundred thousand eight hundred thousand dollars he said i'll give hundred thousand it's okay well we are waiting for other bidders if they come and eat food but naturally i am sure that the owner will not even accept that i am selling 800 000 and you give me 100 oh my god if the mathematicians were to be here they will tell you the what you call the percentage i'm not a mathematician so i can't work hallelujah amen he said he was there waiting and then they gave him a call he said well are you the one who bid for uh the the building he said yes how am i saying i built a hundred thousand come and take it amen praise the lord amen praise the lord come and check it just like that you yes is working there right now and say but you know what happened bro john even the hundred thousand dollars before they put the team on the sale they are pulled off all the roofing and they put new roofing on it and it cost them 53 000 dollars [Music] so you realize that if you calculate things well even the brother bought between 47 thousand dollars out of 800 000. praise god if it is not god let your faith create let your word create your victory for you praise be the name of our god amen i am cutting this from patmos vision okay amen cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected like in the garden of eden i was going to choke it but i am going to say it the prophet said that he didn't want to say that but he will say it and i also would say this morning he said man is omnipotent amen hey this is a heavy statement man is omnipotent now listen to the prophet he said you don't believe that but he is a man that is fully surrounded to god is omnipotent did not he said in mark 11 22 whosoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to pass you can have what you have said your weight amen must create what happens when two omnipotents meet when god and man comes together through omnipotence something has to shake and when you meet with god something might shake oh hallelujah whosoever you say with that creative power of omnipotence of god knowing that he has promised it and he said it in his word it creates hallelujah it creates a power that goes out yonder and brings things to pass things that is not it makes them though they are because two or many potents have met their histones oh isn't he wonderful two omnipotence has met and this morning you and god pure omnipotent has met speak the word and let it create for you that day on the beautiful gate when the the was looking on what we call him peter and john oh can i get some arm from you peter said look on us look on us and i said it was not that peter was calling the attention of the man to himself but the power of god that was standing with him jesus christ was standing with them he said look on us silver we don't have amen god we don't have but such as we have we are given to you in the name of jesus christ rise up and walk his weight created healing and the man got up and the man started walking hallelujah the man started walking the man is jumping they must sleep and he was oh brother sister amen he is the same yesterday today and forever if we allow the omnipotence of god to make us or be important amen something must happen hallelujah something has happened what happened on a sunset mountain when we are told that there was some wind that blew and rocks were cut in in pyramid shape what happened it was because two omnipotent meth amen two omen important met to prove to you and i that indeed the book of revelation chapter 10 amen is fulfilled amen when the prophet saw some bears coming from the east or from the west he said in the beginning it was tiny tiny tiny beds that it tends to be like the size of uh of a doves that it turned also to be like jet planes coming with full speed and they hooked him up took him high hallelujah hallelujah he said the seventh one was so much notable to him and they brought him down to see the sins which have been hidden from all this time is revealed go back and preach it and when they were going back there in the skies above all odds there was a cloud today people are doubting it but whether you doubt it or not whether you believe it or not there are people on this earth who have believed that one that it was nothing but the power of jesus christ looking down to his bride because two of many potents met today it is you and god something has to happen something has to happen amen one time the same prophet he went to the home of sister heidi we know that mr hattie was in the church right with he did he did have been crippled all the years yes that does not mean that god didn't hear their prayers but i said that anything give god the glory before he has it for a purpose lord i've already spoken to the prophet says sir haiti just say the lord ask anything and if it doesn't fall on your lap don't believe me as a man of god and was going up and down the anointing was so much sister haiti was poor he could have asked anything he could have asked 100 million dollars he could have asked her mansions he could have asked even her sister indeed the was sitting in a wheelchair at the corner she could have asked for her healing but you know what while all this were going on his two sons they were making mockery of this experience they were laughing somehow so sister hetty attention caught on them and he said i had salvation for my two sons the prophet said have it immediately the boy ran and knelt before god and they asked for forgiveness they repented and they started serving the lord amen brother sister we are serving that same god we are serving that same god he changed yet not he the same yesterday today and forever now i'm going to the holy spirit and when i get into here in the holy spirit by baptism is that right what does the holy spirit do it gives me power power to be a preacher power to be a singer power to speak with tongues power to interpret tongues is full of power for the holy spirit is the power of god it was the power of god that turned me around it was the power of god that sanctified me now it's the power of god that fills me amen allow me to do some quotes okay so that we can close don't look to your time i'm having the time here okay hallelujah i'm quoting from all things possible uh what see possessing all things okay you say brother abraham i need healing the promise is yours but if you ever get it you aren't going to get it easy not that hallelujah he said i am going to tell you that you are going to have to take it away from satan yes sir take it from satan believer don't accept any sickness into your body oh ra danielle you know yeah i feel it the doctors the doctors examined yes i know that it's because of the food and the things that sometimes we eat and brother abram said every sickness there's a demon behind it so don't accept any sickness into your body look the doctors can examine you okay and it is true that your body has proven that you have that but i said don't accept it if you accept it you are accepting the person of the devil into your body reject it amen yes they have diagnosed me i have cholesterol i have this i have that but i refuse it in my body my word will create for me the prophet said take it from satan he has taken your healing and i've given you sickness hallelujah amen he said you are going to have to take it away from satan satan captures your health you've got to you got the right to go to satan and say give my help back to me hand it over amen i come in the name of the lord the possessor of heavens and earth and i am his heir amen give it back to me hallelujah that is why when we got up we shikkah's house we jump and we sing praise to our god any other thing is down i looked to the doctor when they diagnosed me and they told me something in my body i said doctor i refuse it he said oh say you have to accept it so that we can start the medication i said i don't care you can start your medication but i refuse that thing in my body amen yes that's what i can do when i accept it satan will capitalize on it i don't have the sickness the sickness all the sickness belongs to the devil let us give it back to the devil don't accept everything yes sir oh pastor my condition is that yes i know it but i say do not accept it amen hallelujah he said you took my child you got him messed up with the wrong boy you took my boy and mix mix up with the wrong girl i claim them that is right i claim my child i claim my brother i claim my sister yes satan you have you took them from god's house you quest them out there but i am coming after them i claim them and your word can do that creation hallelujah well how do you know i am an heir of all things amen it is given to me i am an heir i can claim everything that god promised me and the prophet said amen here there you are mine we can claim everything because we are a of his kingdom our words can create your words can create your faith can create no matter what the devil says i'm closing very soon okay are you with me are you tired i'm feeling sleepy we don't sleep here we come to preach the word amen i'm cutting from paradox he said whatever god did i don't know but the sun stood still on the moon and the moon over a jalon because a man a human being a human being was in the line of duty you remember that story the enemies were still coming and general joshua wanted to finish them and the son was going so fast and he wanted to finish them before the night falls so he spoke a word to god's creation because he was in line of duty he has also become omnipotent amen he said son stand still till i finish my enemies moon don't cross over and the bible said that there had never been a day like that that a man could interrupt god's creation like that and it was done and joshua destroyed his enemies by his word he created the situated atmosphere hallelujah he said in a line of duty he commanded the son to stand still and if we are christians we have to believe this to be the infallible word of god everywhere he stopped the world stop the sun whatever he did he stood still for 24 hours i believe it that is the prophet saying that i believe it proving his word and as long as you are in a line of duty keeping god's word doing just what he told you to do martian by the orders of god you've got a right to say to that mountain be moved god keeps his word if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but believe that that what you said will come to pass you can have that what you have said amen hallelujah he proved his word god always proved his word because he is not a man that should lie and amen now let me tell you this before we close do you remember the woman called jemima at memphis that their son took a bad company and he he he found himself in drugs and all that and destroyed the the organs in his in his you know within him and he was dying the doctors gave him up to die but a woman was a christian the woman went on her knees and prayed a prayer he said lord where is the elijah i want the elijah in my home lord bring me the elijah my son is dying i remember that there was an elijah in the bible who who brought back the dead child back to the to the mother after the woman prayed that prayer that night got the the doctors have rejected the guy to die he tried to try there was no hope he left the child in the room and he came out and stood outside put her hand on her fence like this at 2 30 a.m waiting to see the elijah coming where is elijah coming from he didn't think about that he only spoke it out and by that it created can you imagine that the prayer of this woman met an airplane developed a fault immediately a plane that the prophet was flying okay wait he developed fought and they have to land and when they landed as they were turning to the plane to fix the so-called fault the prophet wanted to post some letters somewhere he said the moment he moved then the voice came again he said don't go this way but go that way and he followed the voice and he said god is that you he said go ahead and the prophet went ahead continually continually continually and he kept he didn't know where he was going then all of a sudden he got to where this woman was standing the moment the woman saw him is are you the elijah and he called the the prophet person and the prophet said how did you get to know that um person he said well do you know the woman in the bible who had a son and a son died and he called for elijah to come and pray for the child to bring him back to life and he told the prophet that i am that woman amen my son have taken bad company amen and all his organs are gone he's dying he's in the room and i pray to the lord that you bring me the elijah to my home a word created can you imagine the faith that the woman used to do that prayer and a whole airplane with passengers in it have to land by force because the prophet of god was in it and god wants to send him to duty he said where is your son they say he's in the room the prophet entered into the room he said a woman was a poor woman the room was nothing to talk about but he said you saw an inscription god bless our home and he was very happy amen in fact when the prophet entered in there the boy was groaning the boy was in serious pain because time has left him life has left him he has reached the region of the lost right and he was groaning [Music] and the prophet said woman let us pray together and they prayed and the prophet had the power the woman used to pray oh then after the prophet said our lord if this is the reason why you brought me here i pray let this boy come back to life immediately the boy got up he said mama i can see light mama i can see light in the room mama i can see light in the room what happened he was in the region of the lost where there was nothing but darkness but god brought this boy back to life because of the weight of a woman he created the atmosphere brother cesar you can do the same today you can do the same today in your workplaces in your homes in your school any place that you are you can do the same because god is still the same god he changed not one situation are right don't look to the situation but look to god he is the one that will solve your problems for you don't tend to end up left or right don't turn to you know back or front but i say look to god be focused and know that he the same yesterday today and forever god bless all of you i pray that the lord will strengthen you i pray that the lord will let his face shine upon you anything that you have asked the lord be not be discouraged maintain your faith and know that he will bring it to pass shalom let's burn our heads gracious heavenly father we thank you again lord jesus your word you've told us will never come for it to return to you void but it will always accomplish what you have centered for father i pray this moment o lord commit myself and entire brethren into your mighty hands in the church lord god as you fed us with this word lord create an atmosphere within us that father will always turn upon your promised word to look on today no matter what surround us no matter the concern that we find ourselves in lord jesus help us to speak the word always to create an atmosphere that will be a blessing unto us thank you very much lord for us you do for us always we know you have done it again strengthen their brethren heal all those that are not well fill us with the power that will control to walk your way we always want to be on duty oh lord jesus christ help us to be on duty at all times that father our worst will begin to create for our success thank you lord in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless all of you brother will you please we have not just been encouraged but we have been challenged amen challenged to believe for our situations our personal situations to take this word the examples the things that were spoken the quotes and believe them for our personal situation because our personal situation isn't like what we heard but we can take those things that what god has done for others in the like manner if we can believe them personally for our personal situations we know god is the same yesterday forever he is not going to change we're the variable we're the very sometimes we listen to the devil to us sometimes we look at our situation too much sometimes we question is god really with us am i have i been too far away from the lord is he going to really really help me and i just say today don't let this word which we know is true there's no question in our mind that what we heard was the truth amen but what we're standing today is will we stand up and say i trust god for my situation amen will you will you stand upon god's word for your situation amen will you stand for god amen will you stand that that god will help you with your situation if you if you do believe then you can stand amen amen and if you don't believe you can keep sitting down you've got to stand on god's promise for your situation you've got to take a stand now like what our brother read about what the prophet said it's not going to be easy because you've got to tell the devil to get out amen there's a spiritual battle doubt in faith and it's okay to say you're in the battle because we are in the battle whether we feel it like it or not but i think what god wants to see in our lives because every one of us if we're not going through something real serious in our life we're praying for somebody that is we know somebody that is and then either either way god wants to use you your use your faith your words to claim god's promise it would just be it would be supernatural and very nice and very easy if god just came down right now with every one of our situations and said your name this is what's going on in your life and this is what i'm doing for you right today but god wants us to step out in faith and say god i heard your word i am your son i am your daughter i am a believer and i'm going to take a stand amen amen and it's through that that your faith will grow that's you saying boo to the devil and he gets smaller your situation becomes and before you know it you can just lay claim the way god wants you to lay claim and think of the times that the prophet god spoke to the prophet and he had to pinch himself was that him right it's okay that you know we heard the word we're not sure was that for me or was that for another brother or for a sister but you keep believing and that will become so personal that that was god speaking to me i went to church i don't know where everybody but god was speaking to me for my situation he wants you to leave here as if that word was just for you amen we need our musician the other musicians let's sing there is power in the blood move forward walk forward for how much power you got what forward and more would you be free from the burden of sin there's power in the blood power in the blood would you or evil a victory win there's wonderful power in the blood there is [Music] precious [Music] yes [Music] wonderful power in the blood [Music] precious [Music] there's wonderful power in the blood [Music] precious [Music] [Music] [Music] precious [Music] is [Music] it's here it's here we've got the power amen we've got the power [Music] we've got the power [Music] in the name of the lord though satan rages we shall not be defeated [Music] we've got the power [Music]
