[29:13] Hallelujah.
[29:14] And when you trust and obey, he fills
[29:17] your cup. Amen. Fill my cup, Lord. Amen.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; [music]
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Fill [singing]
[29:22] my cup, Lord.
[29:26] [music]
[29:27] I lift it up, Lord. [music]

[30:06] I lift it up, Lord.

[30:30] Here's my cup. Fill it up and make me
[30:36] whole.
[30:38] [music]
[30:40] Fill my cup, Lord. [music]
[30:44] I lift it up, [singing] Lord.
[30:50] Come and quench
[30:52] this [singing] thirsting of my soul.
[30:59] Bread [singing] of heaven,

[31:11] [singing] it up and [music] make me
[31:14] whole.
[31:17] Hallelujah.
[31:19] Hallelujah.
[31:21] He is the only one that can fill our
[31:24] cup.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; And that we'll never be thirsty again.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; For he is a living living well of Amen.
[31:35] He's alive in a well. Amen. You believe
[31:38] that he's [music] alive
[31:41] and [singing] well, living in me to tell
[31:47] the world [singing and music] that he is
[31:51] the same.
[31:53] [music]
[31:54] He's the same [singing]
[31:56] yesterday,
[31:58] today, [music]
[32:00] and forever.
[32:02] [singing] Jesus is [music] alive and
[32:06] well. Amen. Let's stand tonight. He's
[32:09] alive
[32:11] and well, living in me
[32:14] [music and singing]
[32:14] to tell the world that
[32:18] [music and singing] he is the same.
[32:24] He's the [singing] same yesterday,
[32:27] [music]
[32:28] today,
[32:29] and forever.
[32:32] Jesus is alive and well. [singing]
[32:37] Amen. He's alive and well, living in me
[32:43] [music and singing] to tell the world
[32:47] that he [singing and music] is the same.
[32:53] He's the same [music and singing]
[32:54] yesterday,
[32:56] is today, and forever.
[33:03] &gt;&gt; [music]
[33:03] &gt;&gt; And [singing]
[33:08] &gt;&gt; amen.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; Because he lives, we can live also.
[33:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:15] &gt;&gt; He proved
[33:18] &gt;&gt; that he could die and raise again. Yes.
[33:21] &gt;&gt; Giving us faith that he living inside of
[33:25] us will also quicken us and we can be
[33:30] live for eternity.
[33:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Good to see
[33:35] everyone here in the house of the Lord
[33:37] today.
[33:39] &gt;&gt; And uh I trust that you've come
[33:43] expecting.
[33:44] &gt;&gt; Certainly we all have needs, do we not?
[33:47] Is there is there a need that you would
[33:49] like to see God begin to work on and
[33:52] even Amen. Amen. We serve a God of
[33:56] reality.
[33:58] &gt;&gt; We do not serve a God of history or a
[34:01] God of future. We serve the present I am
[34:06] God.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's uh stand together for the
[34:10] reading of the word. And uh let's before
[34:13] we begin reading uh let's look to God in
[34:17] in a word of prayer and just ask him to
[34:20] come in a supernatural way today. Our
[34:23] heavenly father, we're so grateful that
[34:26] you're here amongst us. You're not just
[34:30] someone who's uh only uh capable of
[34:36] helping once in a while, but you are a
[34:38] God that is able to do exceedingly above
[34:41] all that we could ask or even think.
[34:45] And we humbly pray that you would come
[34:48] and minister, Lord, to the hearts of
[34:50] your people here today. Perhaps those
[34:53] that are on the live stream.
[34:57] Lord, we ask that you would remember
[35:00] them today. Look down in their heart and
[35:02] see the need, the very cry, the very
[35:06] yearning. Lord, comfort those that need
[35:09] comfort. Bring peace to those that need
[35:11] peace.
[35:13] &gt;&gt; Lord, bring direction and guidance to
[35:15] those that need direction and guidance.
[35:19] Lord, may you come and just settle
[35:21] hearts, Lord, and draw us closer to you,
[35:24] heavenly father. Lord, lift us up into
[35:27] that, as your scripture says, into
[35:30] heavenly places
[35:32] &gt;&gt; where we could be seated with you, Lord,
[35:35] in that secret place of the most high,
[35:38] God, where we're we're just in the clft
[35:41] of the rock. We're not we're not
[35:43] bothered by the things of this world,
[35:45] but Lord, we're caught away with you.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; Come and meet with us today, Lord.
[35:51] bless the reading of your word and bless
[35:54] your
[35:56] commit the service in your hands and the
[35:59] things that you're going to do for our
[36:00] lives. Give you all the glory for it for
[36:03] we pray these things now in Jesus
[36:05] Christ's name. Amen.
[36:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Our first scripture reading, we
[36:10] got two. The first is in First
[36:12] Thessalonians
[36:15] chapter 5. First Thessalonians
[36:18] chapter 5. one verse there.
[36:23] We want to
[36:27] speak on a subject consecrating
[36:29] and rededicating our lives to God.
[36:34] How many has something in your life that
[36:36] you would like
[36:38] to just see overcome?
[36:42] Amen.
[36:44] Maybe just uh a certain victory
[36:48] or uh just a little habit that you wish
[36:51] wasn't there or there's some habits
[36:53] maybe that are not there that you'd like
[36:55] there maybe to be a little bit more
[36:57] faithful in prayer or uh being able to
[37:01] control your tongue or just a closer
[37:04] walk. And I believe that um you know,
[37:09] brother Brandham often rededicated his
[37:11] life
[37:13] in his walk with the Lord. So I think
[37:14] it's in service uh for us to do that.
[37:18] All right. 1 Thessalonians chapter 5
[37:20] verse number 23.
[37:24] And the very God of peace sanctify you
[37:28] holy. And I pray God your whole spirit
[37:33] and soul and body be preserved blameless
[37:38] unto the coming of our Lord Jesus
[37:41] Christ.
[37:43] Amen. And then in uh St. John chapter
[37:48] 17,
[37:51] the God of peace, hallelujah, sanctify
[37:56] you holy.
[37:58] Now we are a triune being, a body, a
[38:02] soul, and a spirit.
[38:09] And we need to be preserved blameless
[38:11] until the coming of the Lord Jesus. And
[38:13] Jesus said here in St. John chapter 17
[38:16] verse number 17, sanctify them through
[38:21] thy truth. Thy word is truth. God bless
[38:26] you. You may be seated.
[38:30] Well, in order to be blameless, the
[38:32] first thing that must transpire in our
[38:34] life, we must be born again. Amen.
[38:36] &gt;&gt; A new nature fit for heaven. Peter said,
[38:40] "Seeing you have purified your souls and
[38:42] obeying the truth through the spirit
[38:45] unto unfeigned love of the brethren, see
[38:47] that you love one another with a pure
[38:49] heart fervently." Brother Brandham said
[38:52] it like this. Get to the place where you
[38:55] can love everyone, even your enemy.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; But see, the the world the world says
[39:01] they love, but they love with a human
[39:04] love.
[39:05] They don't love with the love of God.
[39:07] They can't love in every condition. They
[39:10] can't love in every situation. They
[39:13] can't love unconditionally. They can't
[39:15] love no matter what.
[39:20] We know that God can.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; God can do that. [clears throat] And
[39:25] when God lives in a human being, then
[39:28] God can do that through them
[39:30] &gt;&gt; because he's the same yesterday, today,
[39:32] and forever. Verse 23, being born again,
[39:35] not of corruptible seed of of just human
[39:39] love now, but incorruptible by the word
[39:43] of God, which liveth and abideth
[39:45] forever. Now, here is what's going to
[39:47] preserve us until the coming of the Lord
[39:50] is the word of God.
[39:54] This is what is going to give us
[39:57] deliverance over every addiction,
[40:01] over every problem.
[40:03] This is what will give us the Holy
[40:05] Ghost. This is what will give us peace.
[40:07] This is what will give us the victory.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Only God can give us to us.
[40:14] Jesus said,
[40:16] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, you
[40:19] must be born again, or you cannot see
[40:23] the kingdom of God." We must start with
[40:26] this experience called the new birth.
[40:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 5:17 tells us what happens
[40:32] when we get the new birth. Therefore, if
[40:34] any man be in Christ, he is a new
[40:37] creature. Old things are passed away,
[40:40] and behold, all things have become new.
[40:42] Now we all can say amen. I want all
[40:45] things new in my life.
[40:47] &gt;&gt; I want to be completely full of God. I
[40:50] want victory on every hand. I don't want
[40:53] to be cow down to anything. I don't want
[40:55] to bow anything. I don't want to fear
[40:57] anything. I want Jesus Christ in my
[40:59] life. I don't want full victory because
[41:01] God does not fear anybody.
[41:07] &gt;&gt; And and perfect love cast out that
[41:09] thing.
[41:10] But it it ain't perfect love for
[41:14] anything but God.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Now when you you have perfect love for
[41:23] God, then you can love your enemy.
[41:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; It isn't trying to muster up strength to
[41:30] love other people with your human love.
[41:33] It just can't be done. That's why we
[41:35] need a born again experience.
[41:38] &gt;&gt; All right. And ver okay. Therefore, if
[41:40] any man be in Christ, he's a new
[41:41] creature. The old things are passed
[41:43] away. Behold, all things have become
[41:45] new, and all things are of God.
[41:50] That's what we're trying to get to. In
[41:52] the message, enticing spirits, Brother
[41:54] Brandham says, "And so do you know that
[41:58] you're not right with God when you're
[42:00] still backbiting,
[42:02] lying, and doing everything?" He says,
[42:05] "You can't be right with God. I don't
[42:09] care how many churches you belong to
[42:11] &gt;&gt; until your soul becomes converted.
[42:17] &gt;&gt; See, too many people I want to say, you
[42:19] know, they they love God. They're out
[42:21] there serving God. They're born again,
[42:23] but they're still living like the world.
[42:25] They never got a nature change. Amen.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; Now, what we need to do is we need to be
[42:33] pressing to this born again experience,
[42:36] &gt;&gt; this complete nature change.
[42:40] We're all thankful for the work that God
[42:42] has started in us, but we must keep
[42:44] focused on what we're to become.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; And Paul said it like this in
[42:49] Philippians chapter 3:13. Brethren, I
[42:51] count not myself to have apprehended
[42:53] yet, but this one thing I do. I'm
[42:56] forgetting those things which are behind
[42:58] me and I'm reaching forth unto those
[43:01] things which I have not yet attained.
[43:04] &gt;&gt; I press towards the mark for the prize
[43:07] of the high calling of God in Christ
[43:09] Jesus. There's a pressing towards
[43:12] something that I don't have yet. And and
[43:15] if we're not pressing towards it, as
[43:17] brother Ron was saying, we're going to
[43:18] be drifting back, right? We're going to
[43:21] drift back. and and and Paul speaking to
[43:24] the Hebrew church in in chapter 3 or
[43:27] chapter 6 uh verse one.
[43:31] Hebrews chapter 6 verse1 he says
[43:33] therefore leaving the principles of the
[43:37] doctrine of Christ let us go onto
[43:41] perfection.
[43:43] Let us go on to perfection. Don't be
[43:47] satisfied with where you're at. That's
[43:49] right.
[43:50] &gt;&gt; Because God ain't satisfied with where
[43:52] you're at.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; So, you shouldn't be satisfied.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; Now, we know perfection means to be
[43:59] complete.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; And we're complete in Christ.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; But Christ needs to be complete in us.
[44:09] &gt;&gt; We need to be like Jesus. Jesus said in
[44:11] Matthew 5:48, "Be ye therefore perfect
[44:15] or complete as your father which is in
[44:18] heaven is perfect."
[44:21] &gt;&gt; He completely loves everybody. He
[44:23] doesn't just love some people when
[44:26] they're doing good.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; He loves everybody.
[44:31] Now, he doesn't love the sin, but he
[44:32] loves everybody.
[44:34] &gt;&gt; And there should be something inside of
[44:35] the believer who wants to get to the
[44:37] place that Jesus told them to get to.
[44:40] Yes,
[44:41] &gt;&gt; just to get perfect. And in order to do
[44:44] that, you got to get serious with God.
[44:46] More serious with God.
[44:48] &gt;&gt; And we've read this uh scripture many
[44:50] times. Romans 8:29, for whom he did
[44:52] forno, he did also predestinate to be
[44:55] conformed to the image of his son. So we
[44:58] I don't care how you say it, but if
[45:00] you're truly the bride of Christ, you
[45:02] have been predestinated to be in the
[45:05] image of Jesus Christ.
[45:07] &gt;&gt; It's predestinated. Like if I was going
[45:09] to say on such and such a date, it's
[45:11] predestinated. This is going to happen
[45:13] in your life. You're going to walk
[45:15] outside. There's going to be a car in
[45:17] the driveway and uh two people are going
[45:20] to step out of that car. They're going
[45:21] to walk over to your house and they're
[45:23] going to they're going to tell you that
[45:25] um you have re you have won a new washer
[45:28] and dryer. And if it happened,
[45:31] you would know it was true.
[45:34] &gt;&gt; That's what you predestinated for that
[45:36] to happen. The bride is truly
[45:38] predestinated to be like Jesus.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; But not the foolish virgin.
[45:45] &gt;&gt; There's I'll be honest with you, the
[45:46] foolish virgin, there's not even an
[45:48] interest.
[45:55] &gt;&gt; 1 John 3:1 says, "We're laying a
[45:58] foundation with all these scriptures.
[46:01] Behold, what manner of love the Father
[46:03] bestowed upon us that we should be
[46:05] called the sons of God. Therefore the
[46:06] world knoweth us not because it knew him
[46:09] not.
[46:12] Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and
[46:14] it does not yet appear what we shall be,
[46:16] but we know that when he shall appear,
[46:18] we shall be like him, for we shall see
[46:20] him as he is. And every man that has
[46:22] this hope in him.
[46:25] &gt;&gt; He's purifying himself. There's there's
[46:28] like a a continual washing going on even
[46:31] as he is pure. We have this one osmosis
[46:34] system.
[46:36] It's a kinetical. I don't know if
[46:38] anybody's got a kinetical uh osmosis KFI
[46:42] system, but it is the only system in the
[46:44] world as I understand that it has a
[46:47] selfcleaning
[46:49] uh carbon cartridge in there. And how it
[46:51] does the water continually, you don't
[46:54] have to replace the cartridge. The water
[46:55] continually runs over it and and gets
[46:58] all the impurities off of it. And so the
[47:00] cartridge is always being used to to
[47:03] keep to make the the water taste good
[47:05] and and and and purify the water. It's
[47:08] the it's the last filter that it goes
[47:10] through. So the water's always dripping
[47:11] on it and it's always uh keeping it
[47:14] pure. So it's purifying it. and to to to
[47:18] a believer who has the uh the heart that
[47:22] I love you God and I know my purpose is
[47:24] to become in your image that I am going
[47:27] to work on purifying myself on a regular
[47:29] basis. That's why I'm saying we always
[47:31] sitting here there should be things in
[47:32] our life that we'd like to see gone
[47:36] &gt;&gt; and we should be wanting to work on them
[47:37] and I believe that this service can help
[47:39] us really that's what it's been set
[47:41] aside for. The last scripture I want to
[47:43] read here before we we get into this is
[47:46] 2 Corinthians chapter 3:17. It says,
[47:48] "Now the Lord is that spirit, and where
[47:51] the spirit of the Lord is, there is
[47:53] liberty."
[47:55] &gt;&gt; But we all with open face, beholding as
[47:58] in a glass the glory of the Lord, we're
[48:01] changed into the same image from glory
[48:04] to glory, even as the spirit of the
[48:06] Lord. So I want I usually read these
[48:09] these scriptures together because they
[48:10] go uh hand inand um to become more into
[48:14] the image of Christ. It's not something
[48:16] that um it it just happens that um it it
[48:21] it it happens when um we give God
[48:25] liberty in our heart and we allow the
[48:28] word to really come deep down inside of
[48:31] us. And we want to dedicate our whole
[48:35] lives. And I think what happens is that
[48:38] people do not get they do not focus on
[48:41] what they really should be dedicating to
[48:43] the Lord.
[48:45] And in other words, they dedicate part
[48:47] of themselves to the Lord, but not their
[48:50] whole being. So I want to take a few
[48:52] moments and I want to kind of break this
[48:54] down.
[48:56] And everybody, most everybody remembers
[48:59] a long time ago, we made this nice
[49:01] little
[49:04] man here.
[49:12] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham talked about it as
[49:14] three circles
[49:19] and uh maybe in a service and no it not.
[49:24] Oops.
[49:25] Good thing that wasn't glass, right?
[49:26] We'd all be like, "Ah,
[49:32] might have to lower that a little bit."
[49:34] All right. He talked about three
[49:36] circles. He he he describes that a human
[49:39] being is a triune being. He says the
[49:42] outside is the body and it has five
[49:47] gates or senses that goes into the
[49:52] innermost part of you.
[49:55] And uh and that you see him see, taste,
[49:57] feel, hear and smell. And then inside of
[50:01] that uh circle is another circle
[50:06] and that also has five entrances to
[50:10] enter into the heart. Um and that's
[50:13] reasoning, imagination, conscious,
[50:15] affection, and memory. And inside of
[50:18] that is the inner circle. And that only
[50:23] has one gate to get in and that's called
[50:25] freemore agency. We've talked about
[50:27] that. And he said there's only two
[50:29] things that can ever dwell inside of
[50:32] this and it's called faith or doubt. Now
[50:34] I do want to bring this to your
[50:35] attention. This is so strong that it's
[50:38] not just faith or doubt but it's faith
[50:41] or doubt in the word of God.
[50:45] This is important
[50:47] because
[50:50] if we don't realize what it takes to
[50:53] change our lives, it's not just faith or
[50:56] doubt. It's faith or doubt in the word
[50:59] is what changes our lives.
[51:01] &gt;&gt; So if we're thinking about, you know,
[51:02] rededicating our lives and consecrating
[51:05] our lives, this we need to understand
[51:08] what we're trying to uh achieve. So,
[51:11] what I did is I took these three circles
[51:13] and I wanted to
[51:17] um that's about all I can go is up to
[51:20] there. Can you can see those? Okay.
[51:21] Right.
[51:22] &gt;&gt; I went ahead and I just broke these
[51:24] circles up
[51:26] so we can kind of concentrate on these
[51:29] uh a little bit. A lot of times when
[51:32] somebody's got like a a bad habit, uh
[51:37] let's say they're looking at the wrong
[51:39] things on their phone or on a computer
[51:43] and they say, "Oh, you know, I've got to
[51:46] just I've got to deal with that. I got
[51:48] to I got to stop looking." And so they
[51:50] they kind of deal with this over here
[51:52] with their their their sight and they
[51:56] just or maybe they have a a a a bad
[52:01] imagination or their memory think keeps
[52:05] cropping up something from their past.
[52:08] Um or they're they're they're just
[52:09] dealing with the reasoning reasoning a
[52:11] lot in their in their mind. And um they
[52:14] they begin to try to focus on I got to
[52:17] stop thinking. I got to think on these
[52:19] things. And they they're trying to get
[52:22] victory over certain things in their
[52:24] life by doing that and not really
[52:26] realizing that this is where it needs to
[52:30] begin.
[52:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[52:33] &gt;&gt; And when brother Brandon preached the
[52:34] message, the majority of the messages he
[52:36] preached it where the the outer circle
[52:38] is the body, the inner circle is the
[52:41] soul and uh and the very smallest circle
[52:45] is the spirit. Now that is the way that
[52:47] he preaches it most of the time and he
[52:49] says that the the soul the is the nature
[52:52] of the spirit. He makes those those
[52:54] statements but if you go to the end of
[52:56] his ministry he brings out just the
[53:00] opposite where the spirit is the center
[53:03] and the the soul is the very very uh
[53:06] core of a human being.
[53:08] &gt;&gt; And so for now we're just going to go
[53:11] with that. But if what what you name
[53:13] these two really just doesn'tite quite
[53:15] matter to the very fact that the things
[53:18] that he said about them are all the
[53:20] same. You are you with me?
[53:22] &gt;&gt; Okay. So I want to read some quotes and
[53:25] I want to go through these quotes and
[53:28] kind of break some things down. Brother
[53:31] Brham said in the message you must be
[53:32] born again. He says but if you're born
[53:35] of God this is your father.
[53:42] If you're born again, this is your
[53:43] father. A lot of people, brother Brown
[53:46] has often said this, separate God from
[53:50] the word.
[53:51] &gt;&gt; You cannot separate God from the word.
[53:54] &gt;&gt; When you're when you're born again, this
[53:56] becomes your absolute. This is your
[53:58] father. This is who you obey. He is the
[54:02] word. The word. No matter how many
[54:04] sensations you have,
[54:08] &gt;&gt; still a child of Satan until you become
[54:11] dead to the world and alive in Christ.
[54:13] Listen quickly now because a lot of, you
[54:17] know, a lot of things happen out here in
[54:19] these two realms.
[54:21] I mean, dancing in the spirit and so
[54:24] many things happen in these realms and
[54:28] inside this is still dead. Now,
[54:31] &gt;&gt; that's what the prophet said.
[54:34] He said, "A soul,
[54:38] good or bad,
[54:40] good or bad,
[54:42] doesn't change it." Now, I have a lot of
[54:45] scripture wrote down on here on this one
[54:46] I want to comment in. He said, "What is
[54:49] a soul?"
[54:52] What is a soul? He says, "You are a
[54:55] soul." So when you're looking at these
[54:56] three things, I mean, if you look at me,
[54:59] of course, every time you you think
[55:01] about me, you think about probably how I
[55:04] act, my face, the outside part of me.
[55:08] And we we don't really think about who
[55:11] we really are.
[55:13] &gt;&gt; Who we really are is inside. You don't
[55:16] see it.
[55:18] I mean, look, when you go How many We've
[55:20] all been to a funeral.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; And when we're at at the funeral, you
[55:26] don't see that person. You see the
[55:28] outside shell laying there. These two
[55:30] things are gone. The spirit and soul is
[55:33] gone.
[55:36] But when we look at one another, we're
[55:37] looking at our body and our hair and
[55:40] things like that. But in reality, who I
[55:43] am is on the inside of me.
[55:47] a soul. That's who I am.
[55:53] Brother Brandham says, "The part inside
[55:55] of you and when you die, ever what shape
[56:00] that soul is in,
[56:02] that's the way it goes. It goes to its
[56:05] destination."
[56:06] He says, "You couldn't pull it up. No
[56:08] matter how much you do for it, that
[56:11] soul's got to be changed here. It's got
[56:14] to be born again here. Amen.
[56:18] &gt;&gt; You know, people they they get baptized
[56:20] and they they they they make this little
[56:23] commitment to God and they they do a few
[56:25] things and they they think they're born
[56:27] again, but there's no scripture for
[56:29] that. All the scripture is about a
[56:31] nature change, about all things becoming
[56:34] new and the old has passed away and that
[56:36] that becomes the biblical uh the the the
[56:40] biblical definition of being born again.
[56:43] So, it doesn't really matter what we
[56:45] think. And the prophet, he's just he's
[56:46] spelling it right out here. He says,
[56:48] "Say, what about the Holy Ghost?"
[56:50] Brother Brandham,
[56:56] he says, "The Holy Ghost baptizes you
[56:58] into the body for service, but you
[57:01] believe unto eternal life." Now, this is
[57:03] real powerful because
[57:07] the Holy Ghost can come and and baptize
[57:09] you.
[57:13] And it can it can it can really do a
[57:15] work. But here's the thing. Your journey
[57:19] is to believe the word for a nature
[57:21] change.
[57:24] &gt;&gt; In other words, if you're not going to
[57:26] believe that God's going to do this in
[57:28] your life, it's just not going to
[57:29] happen.
[57:31] &gt;&gt; That's why Jesus said, "If you can
[57:32] believe, all things are possible.
[57:37] He that heareth my words and believeth
[57:39] on me that sent me has eternal life.
[57:42] Then you're baptized by the Holy Spirit
[57:44] into the body for the manifestation of
[57:45] the gifts and so forth and believed to
[57:48] eternal life. He that believeth has
[57:50] eternal life. And when you believe and
[57:53] when you believe is when you're dead
[57:57] and you're born regenerated, a new
[58:00] creature. I love that. How many people
[58:02] say they believe and their life is just
[58:04] like the world?
[58:06] I mean, they're deceived.
[58:08] &gt;&gt; I'm so glad we got the word to tell us
[58:10] the true definition.
[58:13] &gt;&gt; The soul. Now, remember, good or bad,
[58:15] death doesn't have one thing to do with
[58:17] it. Death just takes it to its
[58:20] destination.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; He says, "You hear it? And if you still
[58:24] got the world and the love of the world
[58:25] in you, it'll die with you because the
[58:28] world must die."
[58:30] God has condemned the world and the
[58:32] world order. God has condemned it and
[58:34] has got to die.
[58:37] And if that world is in you, you'll die
[58:40] with the world.
[58:43] My I don't see how it could be any
[58:45] planer, brother. [laughter]
[58:48] And if it's good, born of God, it has to
[58:51] go to God. And if it's of the world,
[58:54] it'll remain perished with the world. If
[58:56] it's of God, it'll live with God.
[58:59] Educated or not, educated or literate.
[59:01] If the world is still there, it must
[59:04] die. And if the world is in your soul,
[59:08] if the world is in your soul,
[59:20] your desire is of the things of the
[59:23] world, you'll perish with the world.
[59:26] That's clear, isn't it? It should be.
[59:28] you're part of the dead world and the
[59:31] world is dead and you're dead with the
[59:33] world. But if you're born again and
[59:35] you're alive with Christ and your
[59:37] affections is on the things above and
[59:40] and and not on the things of the world.
[59:42] But if you're born again of the spirit
[59:45] of God, you're part of God and of and
[59:48] are eternal with him. Then death cannot
[59:50] touch you when you are born again. Death
[59:54] cannot touch you when you're born again.
[59:56] You are eternal. You have changed from a
[59:59] creature of time to a creature of
[1:00:02] eternity.
[1:00:04] You have changed from death unto life.
[1:00:06] I'm talking about eternal from eternal
[1:00:09] death to eternal life. If you're of the
[1:00:12] world, you'll die with it. The Bible
[1:00:15] says if you love the world or the things
[1:00:17] of the world, the love of the God's not
[1:00:18] even in you. You can't love the world.
[1:00:22] Jesus said you can't love God and
[1:00:25] mammon.
[1:00:26] Mammon is of the world. You can't love
[1:00:28] the world and God at the same time.
[1:00:33] He that says he loves me and keeps not
[1:00:37] my sayings, the Bible said he's a liar
[1:00:41] and the truth not even in him. Says
[1:00:44] there you are. Now that's pretty pretty
[1:00:46] strong. But um it's the truth.
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; It's the truth. Brother Brandon says
[1:00:52] it's easy to know where you're going.
[1:00:53] Just see where you're being drawn to.
[1:00:55] What's drawing you,
[1:00:57] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:01:00] If you're being drawn to God, the word
[1:01:03] is important to you. If you're being
[1:01:06] drawn to the world, then you're you're
[1:01:09] not putting much emphasis on the word of
[1:01:11] God. Your your emphasis is on meeting
[1:01:15] all your other needs.
[1:01:17] And um
[1:01:22] God is is is calling us to have this
[1:01:29] completely changed.
[1:01:32] When this is changed, this and this will
[1:01:35] line up.
[1:01:37] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:01:39] Now, we all have uh things in our our
[1:01:46] life that we'd like to see changed.
[1:01:51] And um
[1:01:54] it's going to take faith in the word
[1:01:58] through self-will
[1:02:01] to get the doubt out
[1:02:04] to see that change in her life.
[1:02:12] If you walk into a bar, you're going to
[1:02:15] see and you're going to smell and you're
[1:02:18] going to hear and you're going to taste.
[1:02:22] Everything is going to declare that
[1:02:24] you're in a bar
[1:02:27] with your body.
[1:02:29] You come into a church,
[1:02:33] you're going to see it looks like a
[1:02:34] church.
[1:02:37] You're going to smell that it's clean
[1:02:39] like a church. [laughter]
[1:02:41] It's going to feel like a church. You're
[1:02:43] going to hear the singing. It's going to
[1:02:44] hear like a church. This is what your
[1:02:46] body is identifying.
[1:02:50] And
[1:02:52] um
[1:02:56] once these, you know, you walk into a a
[1:03:01] bar or you walk into a party, you walk
[1:03:05] into a a mall, you see things, you hear
[1:03:09] things, you you walk into a circus, and
[1:03:11] that you can the popcorn, the candy, and
[1:03:14] uh the things that are going around the
[1:03:16] circus, the animals. All of a sudden,
[1:03:18] you're these gates now are open from
[1:03:22] what you're seeing and smelling. And
[1:03:23] then you can imagine what it's like to
[1:03:26] be on the on the uh on the mira or the
[1:03:30] or the the the different rides or to see
[1:03:33] the different animals and you can begin
[1:03:35] to reason what it's like to stand on top
[1:03:38] of an elephant.
[1:03:40] Um and then
[1:03:43] um
[1:03:45] um you can um
[1:03:49] you cannot
[1:03:52] um try to become a new creature by just
[1:03:58] dealing with these.
[1:04:03] Because if you still don't if you're
[1:04:07] still doubting
[1:04:10] if you're still doubting living by God's
[1:04:12] word, in other words, you don't put the
[1:04:14] emphasis in the word of God is so
[1:04:17] important to me. It's my absolute. This
[1:04:19] is my absolute. It isn't just this is my
[1:04:21] religion. This is my church. This is
[1:04:22] what I go to. I believe in the prophet.
[1:04:24] It's not that.
[1:04:27] Your heart has to be faith in the word
[1:04:29] of God for your life.
[1:04:32] And if it's not number one, it don't
[1:04:34] matter how much we put on.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; No matter how we dress, it don't matter
[1:04:39] how we try to, well, I'll try to think
[1:04:41] better and I I I I'll try to set my uh
[1:04:45] my I only try to think about good
[1:04:47] things. That only lasts so long because
[1:04:50] if you still got doubt in here. So when
[1:04:53] we're talking this whole thing is when
[1:04:55] you if you really want to consecrate
[1:04:57] yourself, if you really want to dedicate
[1:04:59] yourself, you really want to become a
[1:05:00] better person, you need to focus on your
[1:05:03] heart.
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Your heart, your heart needs to be
[1:05:09] filled with faith in God's word. So now
[1:05:12] you come to church and it's like what's
[1:05:15] important to you is that the word is
[1:05:16] being preached that you want to hear
[1:05:19] what God is speaking to you. So you can
[1:05:21] say, "Lord, I I want to follow this.
[1:05:25] &gt;&gt; You're opening my eyes." And and you're
[1:05:28] not even thinking about this over here.
[1:05:32] &gt;&gt; Because how many people do we know
[1:05:35] they'll come and they'll dress right,
[1:05:37] but they live like the devil?
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; Or they can they can talk right, but
[1:05:45] then all of a sudden the words start
[1:05:47] slipping out of their mouth.
[1:05:50] you you it isn't about trying to change
[1:05:52] up your words.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; It's about changing your heart.
[1:05:57] &gt;&gt; And it needs to BE DONE ON A REGULAR
[1:05:59] BASIS.
[1:06:02] &gt;&gt; A regular basis.
[1:06:09] Ezekiel 18:4 says, "Behold, all souls
[1:06:15] are mine.
[1:06:17] As the soul of a father, as the soul of
[1:06:20] the son is mine, the soul that sinnth
[1:06:24] shall die." We know the bodies are going
[1:06:27] to die,
[1:06:33] &gt;&gt; but we don't want our soul to die.
[1:06:36] We have a body waiting for us.
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; This is the thing that we got to get
[1:06:42] born again.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; Is the is the very very heart of man.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; Now in our in our the spirit realm is
[1:06:52] our mind. This is our mind. This is
[1:06:55] where we do our imagining, our
[1:06:56] reasoning, our conscious, our affection,
[1:06:58] our memory. All that stuff happens in
[1:07:00] our mind and we think in our mind.
[1:07:04] But there is a distinct difference
[1:07:06] between thinking in your heart. As a man
[1:07:10] thinkketh in his heart, so is he.
[1:07:14] &gt;&gt; So there's a dividing line between these
[1:07:16] two thinking. This thinking trumps this
[1:07:19] thinking.
[1:07:22] Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God
[1:07:24] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[1:07:26] any two-edged sword, piercing even to
[1:07:28] the dividing of sunder of the soul and
[1:07:31] the spirit and of the joints and the
[1:07:34] marrow and is a discerner of the
[1:07:37] thoughts and the intents of what? The
[1:07:40] spirit."
[1:07:44] See, the intents come from here. The
[1:07:47] intents come from here. God knows what
[1:07:50] our intents are. We You ever talk to
[1:07:52] somebody?
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; You ever talk to somebody and they're
[1:07:57] saying something, but you know their
[1:07:59] intent is different than what they're
[1:08:01] saying?
[1:08:03] &gt;&gt; People have the ability to have a
[1:08:07] different intent
[1:08:09] than what they're talking.
[1:08:12] But the word of God, which is Jesus
[1:08:15] Christ, the Holy Ghost,
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; can discern the intent.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; And it it knows.
[1:08:25] And the thing is, we need to realize
[1:08:27] that God knows our intentions.
[1:08:33] And then if if we're if we're not going
[1:08:35] to be true blue to the word,
[1:08:40] then it doesn't matter how much we try
[1:08:42] to be a good Christian.
[1:08:45] &gt;&gt; It it just it doesn't matter because the
[1:08:48] the this is what's got to be born again.
[1:08:53] &gt;&gt; When this becomes born again, we we
[1:08:55] naturally do the right things.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; We naturally do the right things.
[1:09:01] Now, I'm not saying we don't fall. We
[1:09:03] don't make mistakes,
[1:09:05] but we're not battling. We're not being
[1:09:07] rebellious. We're not battling things.
[1:09:09] We're not sitting there, I don't I don't
[1:09:10] feel like going to church. I don't I
[1:09:12] don't feel like being a good person. I
[1:09:14] just want to do my own thing.
[1:09:16] And so,
[1:09:19] the key is that we can only let God's
[1:09:22] word into our heart and soul through
[1:09:26] self-will.
[1:09:29] We've got to say, "God, I want you in my
[1:09:31] heart."
[1:09:35] &gt;&gt; And and we can say the words. We can
[1:09:38] sing the songs,
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; BUT GOD KNOWS WHETHER WE'RE DESIRING IT
[1:09:43] or not.
[1:09:46] &gt;&gt; And here's what's beautiful about this.
[1:09:52] There's doubt in our hearts
[1:09:56] because we're not exercising faith.
[1:10:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus comes to the man and he says, "Do
[1:10:07] you believe I can do this?" And he says,
[1:10:10] "Yes, I can, but help thou my unbelief."
[1:10:16] The way to get rid of doubt is to start
[1:10:20] flooding yourself with faith in the word
[1:10:24] of God.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; In other words, if there's a stronghold
[1:10:29] there,
[1:10:33] &gt;&gt; start feeding your faith the word of God
[1:10:36] and watch that thing get smaller and
[1:10:39] smaller.
[1:10:44] Because
[1:10:45] if you have faith
[1:10:49] to say unto this mountain, be thou
[1:10:51] removed and cast into the sea, it'll
[1:10:54] happen.
[1:10:55] But it's not a gift.
[1:10:57] It's not a gift. Faith is not a gift.
[1:11:00] Now, there are gifts of faith, but let
[1:11:02] me just say this.
[1:11:04] I'm not talking about gifts. I'm talking
[1:11:07] about what it takes for a nature change.
[1:11:09] A gift of faith will never change the
[1:11:11] nature. This is something that has to go
[1:11:14] through self-will. And gifts are given
[1:11:16] by God are not self-willed.
[1:11:19] Gifts are without repentance.
[1:11:21] So I'm talking about if you really want
[1:11:24] to see a victory in your life, you want
[1:11:26] to be to a place where you're not
[1:11:29] murmuring, complaining, bothered, upset,
[1:11:32] you're you're you want victory, you have
[1:11:35] to self God, fill me with your word.
[1:11:38] Fill me with the living word, Lord. Let
[1:11:40] your word become alive inside of me. And
[1:11:42] you begin to build on this real
[1:11:46] relationship with God. It's not a
[1:11:48] religion. Remember, Brother Brandham
[1:11:50] said, "Religion is the bark of a tree.
[1:11:52] It's the outside. It's the way they
[1:11:54] dressed. It's the the jumping. It's it's
[1:11:56] all this outside stuff.
[1:11:59] &gt;&gt; But inside of them, their nature,
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; that's where the life is. It's on the
[1:12:06] inside.
[1:12:15] Now we we want
[1:12:18] this dedicated to God. We want our
[1:12:21] bodies dedicated to God.
[1:12:24] Jesus said or Paul said, "Let the mind
[1:12:27] that was in Christ be in you."
[1:12:30] &gt;&gt; So we want to we want to think like God.
[1:12:32] We want to uh uh humble ourselves
[1:12:37] and and and make ourselves of no
[1:12:40] reputation. But but the thing is don't
[1:12:43] try to do that without giving your soul
[1:12:47] to God. Because now here's the thing.
[1:12:49] God owns your soul.
[1:12:54] You don't like this.
[1:12:56] How many's got their house paid off?
[1:12:58] One. I did have it paid off one time,
[1:13:01] maybe twice. It's not paid now, but it
[1:13:04] was that one time,
[1:13:07] but you know, you don't own that house.
[1:13:10] The moment you stop paying taxes,
[1:13:14] &gt;&gt; they can take it from you.
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; It's only yours to use for a while.
[1:13:20] &gt;&gt; Your soul belongs to God.
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; You can do what you want to do.
[1:13:28] live the life you want to live. But one
[1:13:30] day you will answer for that soul that
[1:13:34] God created.
[1:13:38] Your soul belongs to God.
[1:13:41] Now, it's important to have a right
[1:13:44] spirit in here because brother Brandon
[1:13:45] said only faith or doubt. I'll say it
[1:13:48] like this. Before you're born again,
[1:13:52] what what spirit is in here?
[1:14:00] class.
[1:14:02] Let's get involved. Yes, there's doubt,
[1:14:04] but what spirit is that?
[1:14:10] It's the devil as sure as anything.
[1:14:14] That's why we have to be born again of a
[1:14:17] different spirit.
[1:14:19] I I mean, you take a a I bet you Reese
[1:14:22] when he was born, he was probably a
[1:14:24] sweet little boy, little baby boy. He
[1:14:28] just batting his eyes and
[1:14:33] drinking the bottle and
[1:14:37] cuddling and being passed from adult to
[1:14:40] adult. And look at he's so cute. Look at
[1:14:43] those freckles.
[1:14:46] But eventually
[1:14:49] that little cute boy
[1:14:52] began to start doing some deceiving
[1:14:53] things.
[1:14:57] And all of us did.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; All of us did. There wasn't one human
[1:15:02] being born that wasn't bad.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "All have sinned come short
[1:15:08] of the glory of God."
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; We were born in sin, shapen in iniquity.
[1:15:13] We come into the world speaking lies. We
[1:15:15] do not have the spirit of godness. That
[1:15:17] is not the image of God.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; We have to be born again and get a
[1:15:26] different spirit in here. The greatest
[1:15:29] thing that we could do if we want to
[1:15:30] dedicate life is seek God for more Holy
[1:15:34] Spirit.
[1:15:37] And don't just seek it for, you know, I
[1:15:40] just want to be a better person. I just
[1:15:42] don't want to swear. No, I want to
[1:15:44] believe all the word of God for my life.
[1:15:48] &gt;&gt; I want my life to be dedicated to the
[1:15:50] word of God. I want the word to mean
[1:15:52] more to me.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; I want to live by the word of God.
[1:15:58] You know, because if we don't have that
[1:16:00] mentality, all we're doing is having our
[1:16:02] own little private denomination,
[1:16:06] &gt;&gt; just our own little belief system.
[1:16:14] Now if a person
[1:16:17] um has
[1:16:19] um
[1:16:20] you know who's the author of confusion?
[1:16:26] Hey, how many's ever been confused
[1:16:28] before?
[1:16:31] When when that happens,
[1:16:34] do you say, "Satan, get out of here."
[1:16:39] Or or or or do you say, "Why am I so
[1:16:42] confused?"
[1:16:45] Did you ever make a decision and just a
[1:16:47] few minutes later say, 'You know, I
[1:16:49] think I want to do this. And I don't
[1:16:51] mean at a restaurant.
[1:16:54] Okay. The Bible says a doubleminded man
[1:16:58] is unstable
[1:17:01] in all the things that he does through
[1:17:04] his whole being, everything that he's
[1:17:07] producing. Because
[1:17:10] Satan,
[1:17:13] his goal is to divide and conquer.
[1:17:17] Divide and conquer
[1:17:20] a a church, a business, a world. Satan's
[1:17:24] weakening the nations, but he's also
[1:17:27] wanting to divide us ourselves as an
[1:17:30] individual.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; He's wanting to fill our lives with
[1:17:33] confusion.
[1:17:35] And the only thing that can get our life
[1:17:37] straight is the word of God.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; And I don't mean the written word of
[1:17:42] God. I mean the spirit of the word of
[1:17:46] God.
[1:17:48] Because when you receive the Holy Ghost,
[1:17:50] you truly receive the word of God.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; And people want to say, "Well, I got the
[1:17:58] Holy Ghost. I spoke in tongues. I danced
[1:17:59] in the spirit and I did all these
[1:18:01] wonderful things." But yet they're
[1:18:02] denying the word of God.
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; But if you got and look, here's the
[1:18:09] thing. You can have the Holy Ghost on
[1:18:10] your body,
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; the true genuine Holy Ghost. You can
[1:18:14] have the true Holy Ghost in your spirit.
[1:18:17] Dance in the spirit. It could be truly
[1:18:19] God. Prophesy, speak in tongues. But if
[1:18:21] you do not get that spirit inside your
[1:18:24] soul, your nature will not change.
[1:18:37] So when we're talking about
[1:18:41] dedicating ourselves,
[1:18:43] I want you to think about dedicating
[1:18:47] your heart. The genuiness. You ever talk
[1:18:51] to somebody and they weren't acting
[1:18:52] genuine? They're being hypocritical.
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about? You see
[1:18:56] that and you think, "What? What in the
[1:18:58] world's going on?"
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; It It's like there you're not going to
[1:19:02] go anywhere with God if you're not real.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; And it you can only get real by
[1:19:12] self-will.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; You let God into your heart and say, "I
[1:19:18] surrender, Lord, to you. I surrender to
[1:19:20] the word."
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; All right. Are you getting something out
[1:19:24] of this?
[1:19:28] Brother Brandham said in the message
[1:19:30] works is faith expressed.
[1:19:33] He says but when it's directed from the
[1:19:37] inside
[1:19:40] it throws the rest of it together.
[1:19:44] That's the guidepost. That's the control
[1:19:47] tower. The inside of the inside. The
[1:19:50] soul controls the spirit and the spirit
[1:19:54] controls the body.
[1:20:00] So an outside whitewash don't make any
[1:20:04] difference. Them religious people back
[1:20:06] there that Paul called whitewashes and
[1:20:08] so forth, they were outward just every
[1:20:11] way a believer. They had prophecies
[1:20:13] among them and everything else. But the
[1:20:15] inside, the soul that disbelieveth,
[1:20:20] that's the reason I say people can jump
[1:20:22] up and down, speak in tongues, people
[1:20:24] can shout, lay hands on the sick, they
[1:20:26] heal the sick and for so forth by faith,
[1:20:31] all these great things by the spirit and
[1:20:34] still be lost.
[1:20:38] He calls them anointed ones
[1:20:44] in the message and knoweth it not.
[1:20:46] Brother Ram says, "Now
[1:20:48] this outside man
[1:20:52] is the flesh.
[1:20:56] That's what we look at, what we see. And
[1:21:00] it has inlets, five inlets to the body."
[1:21:04] And any grammar school child as myself
[1:21:07] would know that there is five senses
[1:21:10] that control the body. See, taste, feel,
[1:21:12] smell, and hear. Without that, you can't
[1:21:15] touch the body. That's the only way to
[1:21:18] have the body. See, taste, feel, smell,
[1:21:22] hear. You see it, you taste it, you feel
[1:21:24] it. Now, that is the evil one on the
[1:21:29] outside.
[1:21:31] Now the inside
[1:21:34] uh now the inside of that is the spirit
[1:21:39] which you become when you're born in the
[1:21:43] earth and the breath of life is breathed
[1:21:45] into him. The spirit is of a worldly
[1:21:48] nature because it's not given from God
[1:21:53] but it was permitted by God. Now you got
[1:21:57] that. For every child that's born in the
[1:21:59] world, he's born into sin, shaping
[1:22:02] iniquity, come into the world, speaking
[1:22:03] lies. That's right. That person inside
[1:22:06] there is a sinner to begin with.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; I mean, I don't know why my mom and dad
[1:22:17] never told me that.
[1:22:19] They told me I was a good boy if I did
[1:22:20] what they told me to do.
[1:22:25] Now, it's got five inlets.
[1:22:28] I don't know whether I can call them
[1:22:31] right now, but they're listed here.
[1:22:33] Imagination, reasoning, conscious,
[1:22:35] memory, and affection.
[1:22:38] He says you can't think with your body.
[1:22:42] You have to think with your spirit.
[1:22:46] You can't have a conscious in your body.
[1:22:48] There is no mental faculties at all.
[1:22:52] Your body doesn't. So you have to think
[1:22:55] with your spirit. You have to reason.
[1:22:58] You can't reason with your physical
[1:23:00] being
[1:23:02] because you your reason because reason
[1:23:05] don't see it. It don't taste it and
[1:23:07] don't feel it and don't smell it. It
[1:23:09] don't hear it. Reason is what you can
[1:23:12] make in your mind.
[1:23:15] If you're asleep or you're out, your
[1:23:19] body is laying there dead, but your
[1:23:21] spirit can still reason. That's a good
[1:23:23] one. When you're sleeping and you're
[1:23:25] dreaming and all that stuff,
[1:23:27] there is five senses that control that
[1:23:30] man. Now, to the last man, which is the
[1:23:34] soul, there's only one sense that
[1:23:36] controls that, and that's free more
[1:23:38] agency.
[1:23:40] It free more uh free agency, free will
[1:23:43] to choose or to reject.
[1:23:47] And now the reason that people today
[1:23:49] don't forget this now you see that the
[1:23:53] initial evidence of the Holy Spirit now
[1:23:57] people can live in the spirit dance in
[1:23:59] the spirit shout in the spirit they can
[1:24:01] go to church in the spirit they can they
[1:24:04] can absolutely have the real spirit of
[1:24:06] God anointed on that ste spirit but
[1:24:10] still be lost and just as devilpossessed
[1:24:13] as they can be with that spirit.
[1:24:17] This is why people get so confused
[1:24:21] of of a person being a Christian or not
[1:24:23] a Christian or are are they real or
[1:24:27] they're not real.
[1:24:30] See, God's reign can fall on the just
[1:24:33] and the unjust. And God can use any any
[1:24:36] body or any spirit
[1:24:38] when you yield. But when we're talking
[1:24:41] about becoming in the image of Jesus
[1:24:43] Christ,
[1:24:45] we're talking about changing this,
[1:24:48] the seriousness of our soul being
[1:24:50] changed.
[1:24:52] In the message, the greatest battle ever
[1:24:54] fought, Brother Brandon says, "But
[1:24:56] somebody get somebody by the arm and
[1:24:58] say, "Oh, brother John, you know what?
[1:25:01] Me and you were neighbors at that time.
[1:25:03] Come up here to the altar and get down."
[1:25:05] He says, "What are you doing? What's he
[1:25:07] doing? Wish I had a blackboard here. I
[1:25:10] could show you what he's doing. He's
[1:25:12] trying to work through the affection
[1:25:17] and that don't work.
[1:25:20] That's not the avenue. Certainly isn't.
[1:25:23] Maybe he's working in the memory.
[1:25:26] Oh, brother John have a had a wonderful
[1:25:28] mother. She died a long time ago. A
[1:25:31] memory. See, you can't do that. It's got
[1:25:34] to come down in line with the freemore
[1:25:37] agency.
[1:25:39] You got to come to the altar and get
[1:25:42] serious with God yourself.
[1:25:47] &gt;&gt; You yourself let the word of God, this
[1:25:50] is such a powerful quote. You yourself
[1:25:52] let the word of God, you don't come
[1:25:55] because your mother was a good mother.
[1:25:58] You don't come because you're a good
[1:25:59] neighbor.
[1:26:01] You come because that God has called you
[1:26:03] to come and you accept him on the basis
[1:26:06] of his word.
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; That word is what means everything. That
[1:26:12] word, if you can get everything out of
[1:26:14] the way, all conscious, all senses, and
[1:26:17] just let the word come in, that word
[1:26:20] will produce exactly.
[1:26:24] It'll produce exactly what it is.
[1:26:29] Brother Brandon in the message, God's
[1:26:31] gifts always find their places. As he
[1:26:33] said, if you're a young woman, dedicate
[1:26:36] your morals. If you're a young man,
[1:26:38] dedicate your morals, dedicate your
[1:26:41] mind, dedicate your thinking, dedicate
[1:26:44] your heart, dedicate your soul, dedicate
[1:26:46] all you are, and let Christ work through
[1:26:49] that. What a glorious thing.
[1:26:52] The message fellowship brother says now
[1:26:55] with your heads bowed and the organ
[1:26:58] continue continuing playing now don't
[1:27:01] just halfway
[1:27:04] dedicate yourself.
[1:27:08] Don't just halfway dedicate yourself.
[1:27:12] Just think now as you're going down,
[1:27:15] take from me, Lord, all that is unlike
[1:27:17] you.
[1:27:19] Let me be your child from this time on.
[1:27:22] So, I'm just reading these quotes
[1:27:24] because you're you're going to
[1:27:29] somewhere down the line, you're going to
[1:27:31] be rededicating your life to Christ.
[1:27:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Random is just showing with us
[1:27:37] how to do that
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; message God's provided approach to
[1:27:41] divine worship. He says, "You're you're
[1:27:44] worth something. Each one of you is
[1:27:45] worth something. God gave his life for
[1:27:48] you. Why can't you give your life to
[1:27:50] his? See, it's the inside. You've got to
[1:27:54] give your heart to God all the way, not
[1:27:57] part way.
[1:28:00] Why can't you dedicate yourself and your
[1:28:03] time all day other come? If you stay, if
[1:28:06] you don't come with the right approach
[1:28:08] now, if you just go and start and turn
[1:28:11] over a new leaf, he says that won't
[1:28:13] work. You've got to come God's way under
[1:28:15] the blood. Then that shakina glory in
[1:28:18] your in in the presence of God. Then you
[1:28:20] can worship him um the way that you
[1:28:23] should see. So
[1:28:30] God don't want us to just try to do a
[1:28:33] little bit better
[1:28:35] because our emotions are stirred.
[1:28:38] We feel like I want to try a little
[1:28:40] harder today. something is listening to
[1:28:43] my favorite song and you know I just
[1:28:46] feel like you know somebody you know
[1:28:49] said they were sorry and I want to try a
[1:28:51] little bit harder now it can't be that
[1:28:55] that's all carnal that's carnal thinking
[1:28:59] God is calling us to dedicate our life
[1:29:01] to him
[1:29:03] body soul spirit everything that we are
[1:29:06] in a message a man running from the
[1:29:08] presence of the Lord he says let's just
[1:29:10] all consec consecrate ourselves to God.
[1:29:14] Just dedicate ourselves over to the
[1:29:16] Lord. Take me, Lord. I ain't nothing but
[1:29:19] whatever I am, Lord. If you can just use
[1:29:22] me, I dedicate myself to you. And I
[1:29:24] pray, dear God, for each of one of these
[1:29:27] these dear people that stood yonder in
[1:29:29] the mountain in Arizona and cried out.
[1:29:31] And here they now at the altar with us
[1:29:34] tonight praying, consecrating their
[1:29:35] lives. We love you, Father, more than
[1:29:39] our own lives.
[1:29:41] We love you more than our families.
[1:29:45] We love you more than wife, children,
[1:29:49] father, mother, sister, brother,
[1:29:52] husband, wife. We love you, Lord Jesus.
[1:29:55] Make that so real in our hearts, Lord.
[1:29:58] Pour in the oil of gladness this week,
[1:30:01] Lord, in our souls. Give us a bathing, a
[1:30:04] washing of the word by the water of the
[1:30:07] word, dividing unto us truth. Remember
[1:30:11] Jesus, he said um th his truth is what
[1:30:15] sanctifies us.
[1:30:18] Why it had to be shepherds? Uh what can
[1:30:21] I do, dear God? What can I do? Help me.
[1:30:24] and these other shepherds, Lord, around
[1:30:27] the world, shepherds, talking about
[1:30:29] pastors, shepherds of the word to
[1:30:32] proclaim it. Lord, in this next year,
[1:30:34] help us, Lord. We pray. Give us the love
[1:30:37] and thy give us thy love and thy spirit
[1:30:40] and thy light. We dedicate ourselves
[1:30:43] tonight to thy word
[1:30:46] and to and to thy call in the in Jesus
[1:30:51] Christ's name. We receive
[1:30:54] thy word. Amen. The message possessing
[1:30:58] all things.
[1:31:00] And God, you're still the same
[1:31:02] yesterday, today. You protect your own.
[1:31:07] We know it's the truth. And we dedicate
[1:31:10] ourselves a new. Wash our sinful souls,
[1:31:14] Lord, as we confess our faith. Notice
[1:31:17] what he's confess our soul. wash our
[1:31:21] souls, dedicating our soul to you, Lord.
[1:31:25] In the message, God hiding himself in
[1:31:28] simplicity, then revealing himself in
[1:31:30] the same, brother Ram says, "And now
[1:31:32] that we have a place to dwell, a roof
[1:31:34] over our head, a clean, nice church to
[1:31:36] sit in, let's dedicate ourselves newly
[1:31:40] to the task and concentrate consecrate
[1:31:43] our ourselves to Christ. Father, we now
[1:31:47] dedicate ourselves to the service
[1:31:50] through the word with all that's in us,
[1:31:54] Lord, and the congregation and the
[1:31:56] people. They dedicate themselves this
[1:31:59] morning to the hearing of the word. And
[1:32:02] we as ministers dedicate ourselves to
[1:32:04] the preaching of the word. See, it's all
[1:32:08] around the word. The dedication isn't I
[1:32:10] just want to be a better person. I just
[1:32:12] want to have these bad habits. I just I
[1:32:14] just want people when they look at me,
[1:32:15] they they don't think I'm like this. No,
[1:32:18] it's all about us becoming the word.
[1:32:21] See, we're predestinated to become the
[1:32:23] word. And the only way we become the
[1:32:26] word is
[1:32:29] getting the word in our heart. Not just
[1:32:32] the body, not just the spirit, but in
[1:32:34] our heart.
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; In the message dedication. So while you
[1:32:40] are here today, brother Brandham says in
[1:32:42] the dedication of this material here
[1:32:45] that the worshippers are coming to
[1:32:47] worship the living God, why not dedicate
[1:32:49] ourselves to worship to the worship of
[1:32:52] the living God and let him fill us with
[1:32:56] himself
[1:32:58] and then we shall see his glory around
[1:33:01] us. Amen.
[1:33:03] But we are but what we are we give to
[1:33:07] you. my soul, my strength, my heart, my
[1:33:12] all. We dedicate ourselves, Lord, on the
[1:33:15] altar. Not on this little earthly altar
[1:33:18] here, but we but that real altar that
[1:33:21] we're all leaning against this morning,
[1:33:23] weeping with tears as we lay on the
[1:33:26] eternal altar and ask you to take us and
[1:33:29] mold us and fashion us your way and make
[1:33:32] us witnesses, Lord.
[1:33:35] And may they never forget this morning's
[1:33:37] message. Amen.
[1:33:41] We're not going to be able to get them
[1:33:42] all, but I want to get one more.
[1:33:47] Oh, that's a long one. We don't have
[1:33:48] time. Let's stand together. God bless
[1:33:50] you. I sure you got the the the the
[1:33:55] message. Amen.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:57] &gt;&gt; We want to dedicate our our soul to the
[1:34:00] word of God. There'll be times you'll be
[1:34:03] sitting or you'll be alone and you'll be
[1:34:05] thinking, "How can I make my house
[1:34:06] better? How can I make certain things
[1:34:09] better?" You got to take a stand for the
[1:34:11] word. Don't ever compromise with the
[1:34:12] word.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; I would rather literally die and have I
[1:34:21] remember when I was raising the kids and
[1:34:24] they were all in the house and Cheryl
[1:34:26] might remember
[1:34:31] He remembers. I don't remember.
[1:34:33] [laughter]
[1:34:40] But everything was going to stop until
[1:34:43] we got the right spirit in the home.
[1:34:49] We just weren't going to let something
[1:34:50] go.
[1:34:52] We're going to get things right. And to
[1:34:55] to me, to get things right is to get our
[1:34:57] heart right.
[1:34:59] and and to to walk in the word. And all
[1:35:04] of us is missing some word.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; Every one of us here is missing some
[1:35:08] word.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; That's why we come to church is to get
[1:35:11] more of the word.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; We listen to the tapes. We read our
[1:35:15] Bibles. We we we pray to get more of the
[1:35:17] word.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; And that word is what makes us who we
[1:35:21] are.
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; Because you know when brother Brandham
[1:35:24] says, "Who are you? Your soul?" When you
[1:35:27] There's a difference between a spiritual
[1:35:28] Christian
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; and a carnal Christian.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Big difference. When you're looking at
[1:35:36] somebody and you can tell by the way
[1:35:39] they're acting what's on the inside of
[1:35:41] them.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Jesus said you'll know them by their
[1:35:46] fruits.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; The fruit is on the outside. Right.
[1:35:52] But it all because of what's happening
[1:35:55] inside of here. That's why the outside
[1:35:57] is like it is. So I just
[1:36:00] we're going to be thinking, you know,
[1:36:02] brother um brother Boaz brought this,
[1:36:05] you know, we got to fight the battle,
[1:36:07] keep fighting to the end. You know,
[1:36:09] brother Brando often rededicated his
[1:36:11] life.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; He just got alone and rededicated
[1:36:15] himself to God. It's a normal thing to
[1:36:17] do. Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; But when you're doing it, what we want
[1:36:20] to be thinking about is the in part of
[1:36:22] our heart. That alls we have to do is
[1:36:25] dedicate our heart to the word of God.
[1:36:28] &gt;&gt; That the word has to become more
[1:36:30] important to us. Not the things that we
[1:36:32] want to see changed in our life,
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; but the thing that God wants to see
[1:36:38] changed in our life first. Remember, he
[1:36:41] stands at the door of our heart and
[1:36:44] knocks. Not our body, not our spirit,
[1:36:46] but our heart. Amen.
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; And and he says, "If any man will will
[1:36:51] open the door and let me come in, I'll s
[1:36:54] with him and he'll s with me. There'll
[1:36:56] be a a fellowship."
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; If my word abides in you and you abide
[1:37:00] in me, then you can ask what you will
[1:37:02] and it shall be done.
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; So, as we're thinking about
[1:37:04] consecrating, think about that innermost
[1:37:07] part of us that God wants to see
[1:37:10] sanctified
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; by his word.
[1:37:14] Amen. Amen. Let's sing that that song,
[1:37:17] Pass Me Not. It's been a while since we
[1:37:20] sang that.
[1:37:26] Amen. I hope this is your [music] desire
[1:37:27] tonight.

[1:40:23] do not pass me [music] by.
[1:40:31] Now the spring of all might come.
[1:40:36] Comfort [music]
[1:40:38] more than life to me. [singing]
[1:40:43] [music]
[1:40:44] Whom have I on earth beside
[1:40:49] thee? [music] Whom in heaven but thee?
[1:40:56] [music]
[1:40:57] Savior,
[1:41:01] Savior,
[1:41:03] [singing]
[1:41:04] hear [music]
[1:41:05] my humble
[1:41:07] cry.
[1:41:10] Anothers
