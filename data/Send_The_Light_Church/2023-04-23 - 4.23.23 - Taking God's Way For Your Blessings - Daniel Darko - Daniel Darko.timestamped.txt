[31:56] amen amen
[31:59] how many has
[32:01] a responsibility or an obligation
[32:04] today
[32:06] that's right see because God comes and
[32:09] he wants the buses he wants to meet her
[32:11] needs
[32:13] but we also have a responsibility
[32:17] and we heard last service
[32:19] that behind the the Angels there's a
[32:22] voice
[32:23] and that we have to follow what that
[32:26] voice is telling us
[32:28] and
[32:30] um we've even entertained angels
[32:32] unawares
[32:34] and and so we have an angel sent in this
[32:38] age I'll just tell you what's coming
[32:40] down the pipe I can see how the Lord is
[32:42] using these services for what's coming
[32:44] amen
[32:45] he knows what he's doing I just say I
[32:49] want us to have those attentive ears to
[32:52] hear that personal voice speak spoken to
[32:54] us today that we know what to do when we
[32:57] leave here
[32:59] amen let's just sing only believe as our
[33:02] brother comes I just want to also make
[33:04] mention hopefully he's going to share a
[33:05] little bit about what's happening and
[33:08] kind of what he's been doing in his
[33:10] church and
[33:12] um this would be a good opportunity if
[33:14] you want to give at all for the helping
[33:17] of his church building his land got all
[33:20] paid for from the last time but uh the
[33:23] building's going to be expensive because
[33:25] it's not in the boonies the churches in
[33:28] the boonies they don't cost very much to
[33:30] build but you get in the city got all
[33:32] these uh rules that you got to abide by
[33:36] or you can't so so let's just be in

[38:09] and this church has been a blessing to
[38:11] us brother John in particular
[38:15] um by the grace of God
[38:18] for all these years we have been
[38:19] fighting tooth and kneel to get a place
[38:23] to build our church house
[38:25] uh in fact about 10 years ago
[38:29] we
[38:31] bought a piece of land not a piece but a
[38:34] about two piece of land
[38:37] and we didn't know that there was a
[38:39] problem on the land
[38:41] we gave the money to the people
[38:44] and it was just up and down up and down
[38:47] up and down till today
[38:49] we are so struggling to get our monies
[38:52] back but well the Lord made a way and
[38:55] you have been able to buy a new land
[38:58] yeah brother John helped us very very
[39:01] very well to get that land and uh by the
[39:05] grace of God I am happy this morning to
[39:07] stand in your presence
[39:09] to say that we are almost ready to crack
[39:13] the ground
[39:14] hallelujah sister and will you please
[39:17] put the pictures yes this is where the
[39:21] Lord have given us
[39:23] the erection
[39:25] hallelujah amen yeah yeah yeah and then
[39:29] also along the years
[39:32] um I was able to use
[39:34] the offerings to give buy this for John
[39:38] I think I told you about this this was
[39:40] purposely for the Crusade
[39:43] yeah we bought this in our addition to
[39:46] the instruments that we bought for the
[39:48] Crusade yeah and then also
[39:52] um even though we didn't have our own
[39:54] church house but by the grace of God we
[39:56] didn't want to be selfish there were
[39:59] some other churches that were in our
[40:02] condition our situation but where they
[40:06] are is not like where we are in fact
[40:08] where we are we are in a city we are in
[40:10] a industrial city of our country so
[40:13] everything is expensive
[40:15] so it is very not so easy to get up and
[40:18] do things fast fast but unlike other
[40:21] places that we realized that we could
[40:24] help them by God's grace we push
[40:27] something there to you know help them
[40:29] and let's go to the other picture
[40:33] okay this this is a a sprinter bus that
[40:38] I bought for my church because uh I
[40:42] remember some of the Brethren where they
[40:44] lived and most of them were
[40:47] working apprentices and you know
[40:50] students they don't have the means
[40:51] always to come to church in fact there
[40:54] has been the occasion that
[40:56] um they they work
[40:58] distance before they come to church
[41:02] and uh especially when they are coming
[41:04] into the church late oh they are full of
[41:06] sweat and all that so the Lord laid upon
[41:08] my heart to make a provision for this so
[41:12] by God's grace we have this that is you
[41:15] know cutting them to and through from
[41:17] church Hallelujah and this is
[41:21] um one of the towns
[41:23] are about two and a half hours drive
[41:25] from where I live there is a pastor
[41:28] there who also didn't have church and by
[41:30] God's grace we have helped them to you
[41:33] know Reach This level
[41:35] amen yeah so we are praying to the Lord
[41:39] Jesus that if he will they will soon you
[41:43] know finish and then they'll go in
[41:45] amen yeah and uh
[41:50] on a Bible Mission as I already told you
[41:53] I went to three churches but then I was
[41:58] able to share Bible in only one church
[42:01] because the other one I didn't get the
[42:04] chance but there was another one also
[42:06] that received Bible Consignment last
[42:08] year
[42:09] yeah and they are not requested for it
[42:12] again so this is the church
[42:15] that we were able to share Bibles
[42:19] other strength and uh I have to cut this
[42:23] machine short because I have to go and
[42:26] be with Brazil so that we can go to
[42:28] Malawi you know
[42:30] um in fact I was trying to bring some of
[42:32] the pictures from Allah we buy uh all
[42:35] the all the pictures are corrupted on my
[42:37] phone I don't know why
[42:38] yeah so this is
[42:40] what we were able to do this year and
[42:43] hopefully God willing when I get back we
[42:45] are going to continue amen amen so
[42:47] continue to pray for me and pray for my
[42:50] team also that will always be able to be
[42:54] on the field amen God bless all of us

[43:36] replenish your coffers
[43:39] in million fools
[43:41] if you don't like million I'll say
[43:42] trillion amen
[43:46] God bless all of you amen let's just be
[43:49] on our feet at this moment
[43:50] and we are reading uh
[43:53] Joshua chapter 1.
[43:58] Joshua chapter 1 we are reading verse 8
[44:01] and 9.
[44:04] and then
[44:06] we will equally read
[44:10] First Corinthians
[44:11] chapter
[44:14] 2 verse 16 but first let's take a
[44:17] Joshua chapter 1.
[44:23] and verse 8 and 9.
[44:27] this book of the Lord shall not depart
[44:29] out
[44:30] of thy mouth
[44:32] but thou shall meditate therein
[44:35] day and night
[44:37] that thou mayest observe to do according
[44:40] to all that is written therein
[44:44] for then thou shall make thy way
[44:46] prosperous
[44:48] and then thou shall have good sources
[44:52] have not I commanded thee be strong and
[44:55] of good courage
[44:57] be not afraid
[44:59] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[45:02] thy God is with thee with us forever
[45:06] thou going
[45:08] First Corinthians
[45:12] chapter 2.
[45:16] and verse 16.
[45:23] for who have known the mind of the Lord
[45:27] that he may instruct him
[45:29] but we have the mind of Christ
[45:34] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[45:36] of his word amen let's take our our seed
[45:39] now
[45:40] this morning we want to talk on a topic
[45:43] taking God's way
[45:45] for your blessing
[45:49] the Bible says that there is a way that
[45:51] cement right unto a man
[45:54] but at the end of it
[45:56] is death
[46:00] and uh
[46:02] If any man
[46:04] will have to come to the Lord
[46:07] he must come by God's way
[46:11] Hallelujah
[46:14] because the broad is a way that leader
[46:16] to destruction
[46:18] but narrow and straight is the way
[46:20] dilated to eternal life
[46:23] and that is where God has assigned all
[46:27] his people
[46:28] to go
[46:29] amen once upon a time when Jesus Christ
[46:33] was asking the apostles or the disciples
[46:40] unless you eat my flesh and you drink my
[46:43] blood
[46:45] there is no life in you
[46:48] the bible say that
[46:50] a lot of
[46:51] the disciples went away
[46:54] and they didn't walk with Christ again
[46:57] because to them it was a hard way
[46:59] how can we eat the Flesh of a man
[47:02] and drink his blood
[47:04] we are Jews we are Israelites there are
[47:07] even some creatures that we don't eat
[47:09] and this man is suggesting that we eat
[47:11] his blood his flesh and drink his blood
[47:14] is he trying to make us carnivals
[47:17] no
[47:18] that was their mind they didn't have the
[47:21] mind of Christ if they had the mind of
[47:24] Christ they'll realize that Christ was
[47:26] not talking about the flesh or the
[47:28] physical but he was talking about
[47:30] spiritual
[47:32] that is why it's good that we believe
[47:34] this we must have the mind of Christ
[47:37] Hallelujah
[47:38] and so when it happened like that and it
[47:41] went away
[47:42] this has turned around
[47:44] and it was left with only that that he
[47:47] chose and he asked them a question
[47:51] will you also go
[47:53] will you also desert me
[47:56] and Peter said
[47:58] to whom should we go
[48:05] where do you think we can go
[48:07] you are the only one
[48:10] that have
[48:12] the words of eternal life
[48:15] therefore no matter what no matter the
[48:18] situation no matter how somebody would
[48:20] think
[48:22] you are the only one that will follow
[48:25] amen
[48:27] and beloved
[48:29] Peter and the rest follow Jesus Christ
[48:32] till the promise that he promised them
[48:34] was made manifested
[48:39] approaching
[48:46] Christ in you
[48:49] amen
[48:51] we have our own thinking
[48:54] as we're saying last Wednesday
[48:57] when we were outside of God's word
[49:01] we still had some part of God within us
[49:05] God had something to do with us that is
[49:09] why we did so many things even in those
[49:12] days and we have some condemnation
[49:14] within us because we had the mind of
[49:17] Christ already in US
[49:20] Hallelujah other than that they wouldn't
[49:22] we wouldn't feel any guilt
[49:24] when we we we we did so many wrong
[49:27] things but because we had this the seed
[49:31] of God within us always when something
[49:33] go wrong then immediately it tricked you
[49:37] it tells you now no why should you do
[49:39] this
[49:41] that was the mind of Christ amen
[49:43] Amen to show us the way
[49:45] to keep us on the way of God and in fact
[49:48] when we take God's way the only thing
[49:50] you get is your possession
[49:54] we all have part in Christ Jesus
[49:56] Hallelujah as he told Joshua now let's
[50:00] read Joshua
[50:01] let's let's uh start from the verse one
[50:04] perhaps
[50:05] Joshua chapter 1 verse 1.
[50:08] now after the death of Moses the servant
[50:10] of the Lord
[50:12] it came to pass that the Lord spoke unto
[50:15] Joshua the son of none Moses Minister
[50:19] saying
[50:20] Moses my servant is dead
[50:23] now therefore I Rise
[50:25] go over this Jordan thou and all these
[50:29] people
[50:30] onto the land which I do give to them
[50:34] even to the children of Israel
[50:37] every place that they saw of your food
[50:40] shall tread upon
[50:42] that have I given unto you as I said
[50:45] unto Moses
[50:47] from their wilderness
[50:49] and this Lebanon even onto the Great
[50:52] River the river who freitans or the land
[50:56] of the Hittites
[50:58] and unto the great sea toward the going
[51:00] down of the sun shall be your Coast
[51:03] now listen to verse 5. there shall not
[51:07] any man be able to stand before thee all
[51:10] the days of thy life
[51:12] as I was with Moses so I will be with
[51:15] thee
[51:16] I will not fail thee nor forsake thee
[51:21] oh what a Blessed assurance
[51:24] if God will call you
[51:27] and tell you this
[51:29] oh man and you go away from this way
[51:33] what do you think you are doing to
[51:35] yourself
[51:37] that is the question
[51:39] it's a blessed he said there will be no
[51:41] man and when God said no man he means no
[51:44] man
[51:46] no man will be able to stand you away
[51:48] and whatever the soul of your feet would
[51:51] trod did this the land that I have given
[51:53] to you
[51:54] verse six he said be strong
[51:57] and of good courage
[51:59] For unto these people shall thou divide
[52:02] for an inheritance the land which I
[52:04] swear unto their fathers to give them
[52:08] only be thou strong and very courageous
[52:10] that thou Mayors observe to do according
[52:14] to all the law which Moses my servant
[52:16] commanded thee
[52:18] cannot from it to the right hand or to
[52:21] the left that thou mayest Prosper with
[52:25] the server thou goes
[52:26] verse 8. this book of the law shall not
[52:30] depart out of thy mouth
[52:32] but thou shall meditate therein day and
[52:35] night
[52:36] that thou mayest observe to do according
[52:39] to all that is written therein
[52:41] for then thou shall make thy way
[52:44] prosperous and then thou shall have good
[52:47] sources
[52:51] foreign be strong and of good courage
[52:55] be not afraid
[52:57] neither be thou dismayed for the Lord
[53:00] that God is with thee with us forever
[53:03] thou goest amen
[53:05] amen oh brother I can equate this
[53:08] to the topic we treated last Wednesday
[53:11] the Angelic protection
[53:13] he is always with us
[53:16] he will not
[53:18] deny his himself
[53:21] the Bible said that God is not a man
[53:23] that you lie
[53:24] amen therefore God always want to stand
[53:26] by his word
[53:28] Hallelujah his word of protection
[53:31] his word of Liberty
[53:34] his word of Freedom his word of
[53:36] redemption his word of salvation
[53:39] all these promises as he promises people
[53:43] the only thing we need to do is to take
[53:45] God's way
[53:47] Hallelujah
[53:49] if you take God's way then of course
[53:52] there is something for you
[53:55] Hallelujah he said blessed are the eyes
[53:58] that have not seen but yet believe
[54:01] take the way of God by inspiration take
[54:05] the Way of the World by by Revelation
[54:08] and when you do that beloved there you
[54:11] see your possession lying for you now no
[54:15] man will be able to stand against you
[54:17] the prophet said that footprint means
[54:20] your possession
[54:21] it is where you put your foot
[54:24] that is where that is what belongs to
[54:27] you in a place that the soul of your
[54:29] feet will trod or will tread God said is
[54:33] the part of the land that he has given
[54:36] to you there will be no man who will be
[54:38] able to stand before you
[54:41] Hallelujah that is God's way
[54:44] Hallelujah that is God's way beloved
[54:46] amen let's let's read uh Deuteronomy
[54:49] chapter 11.
[54:53] Deuteronomy chapter 11 we are reading
[54:56] verse 13 down
[54:59] to establish ourselves
[55:04] Deuteronomy chapter 11 verse 13.
[55:07] and it shall come to pass remember the
[55:10] prophet said whatever you read in the
[55:12] scripture put yourself there
[55:15] right so this scripture that we are
[55:16] reading we are not reading for the Old
[55:18] Testament Believers we are ready for
[55:20] ourselves today
[55:21] Hallelujah and it shall come to pass
[55:27] unto my commandment which I command you
[55:30] this day to love the Lord your God and
[55:33] to serve him with all your heart
[55:36] and with all your soul that I will give
[55:39] you the reign of your land in his due
[55:42] season
[55:42] the first rain and the latter rain the
[55:45] thou Mayors Gather in thy corn and thine
[55:49] wine and thy oil
[55:51] and I will send grass in thy fields for
[55:54] thy cuttle that thou mayest eat and be
[55:57] full you see God has already prepared
[55:59] all this for his people
[56:00] the only thing God wants is that his
[56:03] children will come his way
[56:05] oh my
[56:07] God and I will send grass in thy field
[56:09] for thy cattle that thou mayest eat and
[56:13] be full oh thank you God we won't always
[56:16] to be full
[56:18] take heed to yourself that your heart be
[56:21] not deceived and yet turn aside and
[56:24] serve other gods and worship them
[56:27] and then the Lord's route be Kindle
[56:29] against you
[56:31] and he shut up the heaven that there
[56:33] will be no rain and that the land yield
[56:36] not her fruit unless you perish quickly
[56:39] from all the good land which the lord
[56:42] giveth you
[56:44] therefore shall ye lay up this my words
[56:47] in your hearts
[56:50] let me repeat that please
[56:51] therefore shall ye lay up this way this
[56:55] my words in your heart and in your soul
[56:58] and bind them for a sign upon your hand
[57:02] that there may be as frontless between
[57:05] your eyes
[57:08] and yes I teach them your children
[57:11] speaking of them when thou seated in
[57:13] their house and when thou workers by the
[57:16] way when thou lies down and when doubt
[57:20] Rises up
[57:22] meaning in every situation in every
[57:25] condition we must make sure that we are
[57:28] meditating upon God's word
[57:31] and for that matter we teach our
[57:33] children oh thank God that we understand
[57:35] those truths
[57:37] Day by Day and Night by night we are
[57:40] teaching our children he said when we
[57:43] sit we should speak about that he said
[57:46] when we walk by the way we should speak
[57:48] about that he said when we sleep we
[57:50] should speak about that when we rise we
[57:52] should speak about that meaning at all
[57:55] times we should speak about the word of
[57:58] God
[58:00] he said let us meditate upon it
[58:04] shall write them upon the doorpost of
[58:07] thy house and upon thy Gates
[58:11] that your days may be multiplied
[58:14] and the days of your children in the
[58:17] land which the Lord swear unto your
[58:19] fathers to give them
[58:21] are the days of Heaven upon the Earth
[58:25] for if you shall diligently keep all
[58:27] these Commandments which I command you
[58:29] to do them to love the Lord your God to
[58:33] walk in all his ways and to claim unto
[58:35] him then will the Lord drive out all
[58:38] these nations from before you and yesha
[58:42] possess greater Nations and mightier
[58:44] than yourselves amen every place where
[58:48] on the soul of your future tread shall
[58:51] be yours from the Wilderness and Lebanon
[58:55] from the river the river uffrage is even
[58:58] onto the ottoman sea shall your Coast be
[59:01] there shall no man be able to stand
[59:04] before you for the Lord your God shall
[59:07] lay the fear of you and the dread of you
[59:10] upon all the land that yea shall tread
[59:13] upon as he has said unto you
[59:17] oh my goodness
[59:19] if the situation is like this
[59:23] then I think we have a great weapon
[59:27] we have a great weapon to defeat any
[59:29] opposition that rises in our way
[59:33] because the fight does not belong to us
[59:35] the fight belongs to God
[59:38] Hallelujah he said I'll fight for you
[59:40] and you hold your peace
[59:42] so who is the enemy
[59:44] who is disappointed who is frustration
[59:47] and I believe with all my heart that
[59:49] whatever God leads the way and you
[59:53] follow there is no problem
[59:55] there is no disappointment
[59:58] there is no frustrations
[1:00:00] there is no failure because God is the
[1:00:03] leader
[1:00:05] amen
[1:00:07] Hallelujah
[1:00:08] Once Upon a Time
[1:00:10] when it came to the time that Naomi
[1:00:13] was patterned from Moab
[1:00:16] because they took a journey
[1:00:18] oh my goodness it's always better to
[1:00:21] take the way of the Lord
[1:00:24] but Naomi and the husband
[1:00:27] well they said that problem has come to
[1:00:30] uh Bethlehem for that matter they have
[1:00:33] to live to Moab
[1:00:34] leaving the god of Israel among the
[1:00:39] Israelites and going to a place where
[1:00:43] Idols are worshiped think about that
[1:00:47] and when they went great Calamity fell
[1:00:51] upon them
[1:00:52] okay let me put it this way great
[1:00:54] Calamity fall upon the woman the husband
[1:00:57] died
[1:00:58] the two sons that's supposed to have you
[1:01:01] know console her also perished it was
[1:01:04] left with this woman alone
[1:01:06] but when I tell God
[1:01:08] that the woman realized
[1:01:11] that no
[1:01:13] after all
[1:01:14] she has lost everything that she came
[1:01:17] with so therefore let me go back to my
[1:01:20] country
[1:01:22] and it is always good to turn around
[1:01:27] when you see that the going is not
[1:01:28] favoring you just turn around
[1:01:31] when you realize that you are not going
[1:01:33] God's way just turn around and come back
[1:01:36] to God's way
[1:01:37] [Music]
[1:01:38] because God's way is the only way that
[1:01:41] can help all of us
[1:01:43] so the woman realized no let me turn
[1:01:45] around and go God's way
[1:01:48] so one day according to the Bible
[1:01:51] this to
[1:01:54] you know uh
[1:01:56] he loss
[1:01:58] root and upper
[1:02:00] and told them that look women
[1:02:04] I came here four
[1:02:06] but I'm not empty
[1:02:08] but I want to take my emptiness
[1:02:11] back home
[1:02:13] so therefore
[1:02:14] go back to your people
[1:02:18] I am going back to Bethlehem
[1:02:20] I'm going back to Israel because after
[1:02:22] that's where I belong
[1:02:25] and the Bible says that
[1:02:27] these two women
[1:02:29] oppa
[1:02:30] and Ruth
[1:02:32] all agree
[1:02:35] but you see
[1:02:36] rude was looking
[1:02:39] on one way an opera was looking another
[1:02:43] way
[1:02:45] the prophet said that Opera represents
[1:02:47] the denomination
[1:02:49] and wrote represent the bride
[1:02:52] and there is always this thing that the
[1:02:57] bride will always have the mind of
[1:02:59] Christ
[1:03:01] amen so Ruth look at it now these are
[1:03:04] two ways
[1:03:06] should I go back
[1:03:08] to my people to worship kamash or I
[1:03:12] shall follow Naomi there were two ways
[1:03:15] Hallelujah
[1:03:17] because there was nothing in her there
[1:03:21] was no Revelation in her there was
[1:03:23] nothing like the seed of God in here
[1:03:26] she reached and kissed a woman and bit
[1:03:29] her farewell okay God be with you
[1:03:32] amen after all she has had Jehovah being
[1:03:36] preached
[1:03:37] so he said God be with you and she left
[1:03:39] back for her Idols yes
[1:03:42] but Ruth
[1:03:44] mine look at the woman's face Naomi he
[1:03:48] said madam
[1:03:49] and treat me not to return amen for
[1:03:54] where you go I will go
[1:03:57] the way that you have chosen I know that
[1:03:59] that is the way of God
[1:04:01] so therefore don't tell me to return
[1:04:04] for your God shall be my God
[1:04:08] your people shall be my people
[1:04:11] Hallelujah
[1:04:14] amen meaning she was ready to worship
[1:04:17] Jehovah
[1:04:19] he said your goal shall be my God your
[1:04:21] people shall be mine people a gentle
[1:04:24] woman proclaiming this
[1:04:27] oh brother
[1:04:28] she did that by inspiration amen
[1:04:31] she did that by Revelation she was
[1:04:34] taking God's way she was ready to pay
[1:04:37] God's way because she knew that that is
[1:04:40] where
[1:04:41] she will come
[1:04:42] into the terms of the god of Israel
[1:04:49] he said where you sleep there I will
[1:04:51] sleep why
[1:04:52] there I will die and while you are
[1:04:54] buried there I'll be buried
[1:04:57] what made Ruth to talk about all this
[1:05:01] talking about that talking about
[1:05:03] Resurrection
[1:05:04] because the mind of Christ has been
[1:05:08] placed in that woman already so she was
[1:05:11] talking about death
[1:05:13] amen he said when Naomi will be buried
[1:05:16] there should be buried
[1:05:20] she knew
[1:05:21] Hallelujah that when Abraham died
[1:05:26] he was buried at a particular place
[1:05:29] when Sarah died Abraham bought
[1:05:31] machipella and buried the wife Sarah
[1:05:34] and all their patrons were buried there
[1:05:37] Hallelujah so now Ruth caught the
[1:05:40] Revelation that there is going to be
[1:05:42] something happening over there and that
[1:05:44] would be the resurrection
[1:05:46] so she wanted to be buried when Naomi
[1:05:49] will be buried
[1:05:51] oh praise be the name of our God Amen
[1:05:54] amen and today we thank God that Jesus
[1:05:57] Christ is how muchipella
[1:05:59] Hallelujah and all of us have been
[1:06:01] buried in him
[1:06:03] Hallelujah your baptism signifies your
[1:06:07] death
[1:06:08] and when you were brought from under the
[1:06:10] water signifies your Resurrection
[1:06:12] so that is what we have done that is our
[1:06:15] experience and we have taken the way of
[1:06:17] the Lord
[1:06:18] oh brother sister can you imagine that
[1:06:21] this woman took the way of God
[1:06:24] she went to bedland empty there was no
[1:06:28] hope but yet because she was on the way
[1:06:31] of the Lord God himself Made A Way
[1:06:34] where there was no way
[1:06:37] amen one day
[1:06:39] she got up
[1:06:41] and Naomi said that
[1:06:43] my daughter
[1:06:45] we don't have anything to eat
[1:06:47] why don't you go to the field and see
[1:06:49] whether you can you know go follow those
[1:06:52] Harvesters and then see if you can get
[1:06:53] something to knock home so that we can
[1:06:56] you know share
[1:06:58] Ruth said Mom I would go
[1:07:01] and she got herself up and went to the
[1:07:04] field
[1:07:06] but look at what God did
[1:07:11] Ruth didn't know that there was anybody
[1:07:13] called Boaz
[1:07:15] but God directed her way
[1:07:19] and he went to the field of Boaz do you
[1:07:22] know why
[1:07:23] because she already took God's way
[1:07:27] and when you tell God's way today all
[1:07:30] the days of the old days all the days of
[1:07:33] your life God will lead you
[1:07:36] amen God will lead you so God LED Ruth
[1:07:40] and found herself on the field of Boaz
[1:07:43] the Reapers were reaping
[1:07:46] and she was just following trying to
[1:07:49] gather you know the leftovers
[1:07:52] it was not quite long
[1:07:54] when
[1:07:55] Boaz came around
[1:07:58] and when boss came around and he saw
[1:08:00] Ruth
[1:08:01] then he asked his workers hey who is
[1:08:04] that woman
[1:08:06] they said well
[1:08:07] that is the woman that
[1:08:09] Naomi brought from Moab
[1:08:12] I said hey
[1:08:13] take good care of that woman
[1:08:17] treat her very well
[1:08:19] make sure
[1:08:21] that you Harvesters
[1:08:23] because of this woman
[1:08:24] deliber briefly live some of the food
[1:08:28] behind you
[1:08:30] what was that that the grace of God
[1:08:34] will intentionally make a way to bless
[1:08:36] you
[1:08:37] but what are you like the blessing or
[1:08:39] not he will bless you because it tastes
[1:08:42] his will it's his desire to stand by his
[1:08:45] weight
[1:08:46] it's a god a way that I have given you
[1:08:50] and you see your blessings upon your way
[1:08:52] yes he said meditate upon the word day
[1:08:55] and night not someday not sometime but
[1:08:59] all the time
[1:09:02] that is why I don't believe in
[1:09:04] Christians
[1:09:05] who come to church today
[1:09:08] and uh 2000 years they will not come
[1:09:11] again
[1:09:12] the third thousand year they will come
[1:09:14] to church I don't believe in that
[1:09:16] Christianity brother sister let us be
[1:09:19] firm and and free
[1:09:21] that doesn't help our Christian Journey
[1:09:24] we must be able to find ourselves always
[1:09:28] or you say brother is my work yes I know
[1:09:31] sometimes it's your work but sometimes
[1:09:34] it is not your work sometimes it's your
[1:09:36] laziness yes
[1:09:38] Hallelujah so I say sometimes it's not
[1:09:41] your work sometimes you share laziness
[1:09:44] but the Holy Ghost don't produce
[1:09:47] laziness
[1:09:49] the Holy Ghost always produce vibrancy
[1:09:52] people that can stand on your feet yes
[1:09:55] and respond to their names
[1:09:57] that is what the Holy Ghost want us to
[1:09:59] be Hallelujah you think if Ruth stayed
[1:10:03] at home will he have received that
[1:10:04] blessing no root wasn't a lazy woman
[1:10:08] but because of the way that she took but
[1:10:12] what said this woman I want you to live
[1:10:16] in fact deliberate leave the food behind
[1:10:18] you so that she will pick them
[1:10:22] oh brother I see God
[1:10:25] I see God living certain things on your
[1:10:29] way
[1:10:30] I see God deliberately living your
[1:10:33] blessings and you are coming to carry
[1:10:36] them
[1:10:37] I see God raising you up oh Lord from
[1:10:40] your things that has brought you down
[1:10:43] God is Raising you up
[1:10:45] mine
[1:10:47] and Ruth guarded all that
[1:10:50] another time
[1:10:53] she went back
[1:10:55] this time Boaz richer
[1:10:59] you say woman
[1:11:02] anytime you come and drink
[1:11:06] come and drink from my band I have a
[1:11:08] cooler
[1:11:10] that the water is so cold don't go to
[1:11:13] that you know Muddy Waters come and
[1:11:15] drink here
[1:11:16] it was God's favor for Ruth because she
[1:11:19] took God's way can you say Amen here
[1:11:22] hallelujah she took God's way and you
[1:11:25] know that day he said woman
[1:11:29] open your sack
[1:11:32] and he himself
[1:11:34] measured six measures
[1:11:37] of Bali
[1:11:39] and put in a sack of Ruth amen he said
[1:11:43] go
[1:11:45] and feed on that
[1:11:47] when it's finished come back
[1:11:50] Hallelujah and you ask yourself
[1:11:52] why six
[1:11:54] because we believe that normal sex is
[1:11:57] the number of a man
[1:11:59] Hallelujah but do you know the number
[1:12:02] seven is also always a mystery
[1:12:06] the number seven is always always a
[1:12:10] mystery
[1:12:11] after Boaz gave six measures of belly
[1:12:17] to Ruth
[1:12:19] the seventh one was on the way
[1:12:24] and the seventh one was Boaz himself
[1:12:28] amen hallelujah
[1:12:30] that someone was born you know the story
[1:12:33] already
[1:12:34] when Naomi told Ruth that hey boss is
[1:12:39] going to
[1:12:41] um we know
[1:12:43] you know his Harvest
[1:12:44] and there will be going to be a party
[1:12:48] prepare yourself and go
[1:12:50] but this is the trick
[1:12:52] or for that matter this is the way of
[1:12:54] God
[1:12:55] after the man has made himself merry
[1:13:00] watch him
[1:13:03] watch him
[1:13:05] wherever you lay ah go and lay at his
[1:13:09] feet
[1:13:12] and perhaps
[1:13:13] when you got up and asked you who is
[1:13:16] this
[1:13:17] tell him straight to his face
[1:13:21] you are the kingsman
[1:13:24] cover me with your skate
[1:13:27] and Ruth did exactly so
[1:13:30] Hallelujah that day oh brother but what
[1:13:35] was so shocked to find a woman you know
[1:13:37] Israelis are very careful of whatever
[1:13:40] they do he didn't want anybody to accuse
[1:13:43] him
[1:13:44] he didn't want anybody to think that he
[1:13:46] was a very bad man so when he saw root
[1:13:50] by his he said who is who are you
[1:13:53] he said I'm Ruth you are the king's man
[1:13:55] come on me with your skirt
[1:13:59] it was imparable yes
[1:14:02] but like the prophet said
[1:14:04] when they deep collect onto the Deep
[1:14:06] there must be a dip to respond
[1:14:09] so when Ruth made that statement but was
[1:14:11] understood and said well
[1:14:14] there is a Kingsman that is closer than
[1:14:17] myself
[1:14:18] I would deal with him if he will do what
[1:14:22] he's supposed to do but if he will not
[1:14:24] then I will take over
[1:14:26] to cut their story short the woman the
[1:14:29] man refused and then the Redeemer ship
[1:14:33] fell upon Boaz
[1:14:35] and Boaz has to marry Ruth
[1:14:39] oh praise be the name of our God and
[1:14:42] that was the blessing and the joy of the
[1:14:45] army again
[1:14:46] because every blessing That Came Upon
[1:14:48] Ruth it affected Naomi
[1:14:51] beloved take God's way amen amen and
[1:14:55] when you take God's way God will surely
[1:14:58] stand by you
[1:14:59] amen and amen
[1:15:02] Hallelujah
[1:15:03] he told Joshua he says
[1:15:07] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:15:09] that's verse 8 shall not Depart of the
[1:15:12] out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate
[1:15:15] therein day and night that thou mayest
[1:15:18] observe to do according to all that is
[1:15:20] written therein for them Thou shalt make
[1:15:23] thy way prosperous and then thou shall
[1:15:26] have good sources not just sources but
[1:15:30] good one
[1:15:31] amen you see good sources
[1:15:36] my
[1:15:38] oh I'm blessed oh yes I'm blessed oh I'm
[1:15:42] blessed how are you blessed
[1:15:45] I am successful
[1:15:47] I am successful
[1:15:49] how are you successful
[1:15:51] can you be successful without the Lord
[1:15:52] Jesus Christ
[1:15:54] can you be blessed without the Lord
[1:15:55] Jesus Christ so he said I'll give you
[1:15:58] good sources amen
[1:16:01] you are blessed and you have the Lord
[1:16:04] Jesus Christ also in your life
[1:16:07] oh what is more than this brother
[1:16:10] Hallelujah two ways tell God's way
[1:16:14] like you told the Israel I said today
[1:16:16] I've said before you two ways
[1:16:18] the good and the evil but I God I am
[1:16:23] telling you to take the good one that's
[1:16:24] right because when you take the good one
[1:16:26] I will bless you
[1:16:28] I'll multiply you I will make you great
[1:16:32] and you will subdue all your enemies
[1:16:35] amen
[1:16:37] now
[1:16:42] all mine
[1:16:45] let's listen to this type of prophet
[1:16:47] said
[1:16:50] he said I'm talking I'm taking this from
[1:16:52] talk on the word
[1:16:54] he says full steps is Victory
[1:17:00] he told Joshua
[1:17:01] everywhere the food or your soul the
[1:17:05] foot will trod I will give it to you
[1:17:09] and I'll tell you today brother sister
[1:17:12] let's throw it on the lands that God
[1:17:15] give to us
[1:17:17] okay Divine Healing
[1:17:20] powers of God everything
[1:17:22] coming into Christ is like going down to
[1:17:25] the big arcade down here
[1:17:27] maybe Walmart
[1:17:30] or any big shop that you can talk about
[1:17:33] going into a variety store just think
[1:17:37] in a variety store the size like this
[1:17:40] Tabernacle perhaps this is a small place
[1:17:42] for Walmart
[1:17:44] as compared to Walmart we can have about
[1:17:47] 100
[1:17:48] 100 uh
[1:17:51] send the light
[1:17:54] Auditorium in Walmart
[1:17:57] very huge
[1:17:59] and what is the prophet trying to imply
[1:18:01] here he says when you enter into that
[1:18:04] shop there are varieties there are
[1:18:06] things so many things
[1:18:08] and you go in for a purpose
[1:18:11] you need something that is why you go
[1:18:13] there
[1:18:14] you want to buy something you want to
[1:18:16] own something right
[1:18:17] so you go and grab it and then you go
[1:18:20] and pay
[1:18:22] it don't make you pay
[1:18:24] it belongs to you yeah yeah that is why
[1:18:26] you are given receipt when you pay
[1:18:30] but on our case
[1:18:32] the price is already paid
[1:18:35] Jesus have already paid
[1:18:37] we don't pay anything again but we go
[1:18:41] there and take what belongs to us
[1:18:42] whatever our needs are we go there and
[1:18:45] take it because we are going by his way
[1:18:49] oh Hallelujah
[1:18:53] I look around
[1:18:55] there is everything in here
[1:18:58] the shelves are all full of nice pretty
[1:19:00] things
[1:19:01] and everything that that I like they are
[1:19:05] all mine
[1:19:06] they belong to me
[1:19:08] every one of them belongs to me I can go
[1:19:11] over and take what I want oh yes yes yes
[1:19:14] yes yes yes I can go into Jesus Christ
[1:19:17] and take whatever I want
[1:19:19] nobody can question me
[1:19:22] Hallelujah because everything that is in
[1:19:25] Christ belongs to us
[1:19:30] amen
[1:19:32] everything not some things everything
[1:19:35] that is in Christ belong to us
[1:19:38] it depends upon you
[1:19:41] whether you want to take it or not
[1:19:44] Hallelujah
[1:19:45] there are certain things that is in your
[1:19:49] life you need courage to take it
[1:19:53] there are certain things in your life
[1:19:55] you need Faith to take it
[1:19:57] amen hallelujah look at the Centurion
[1:20:00] when his his daughter or whatever was
[1:20:03] was was was sick
[1:20:06] and he reached to Jesus
[1:20:08] he knew that there is something in Jesus
[1:20:10] Christ
[1:20:11] that he can take it he said master when
[1:20:14] you come please and pray for my my
[1:20:16] servant
[1:20:19] when Christ made attempt to go
[1:20:22] he said no no no I am not even worthy
[1:20:25] for you to come under my roof
[1:20:27] I am a captain of the army
[1:20:30] I have servants under me I said to this
[1:20:33] go and you go with I said to this come
[1:20:36] and they come so don't come to my house
[1:20:40] just pick the word
[1:20:42] Oh my Jesus look at the man so what a
[1:20:45] faith
[1:20:46] what a faith
[1:20:49] the man knew that something is Jesus
[1:20:51] Christ and you need to take it and you
[1:20:54] took it
[1:20:55] at that time the seven got healed
[1:20:58] because Jesus said Let It Be according
[1:21:01] to your faith
[1:21:03] we can talk about the woman with a blood
[1:21:06] issue
[1:21:08] when all over the place he has been to
[1:21:10] one hospital to another and there was no
[1:21:13] cure for her
[1:21:14] she has heard Jesus Christ performing
[1:21:17] and she knew that indeed if Christ has
[1:21:21] performed in the life of other people
[1:21:23] then of course he can also perform in
[1:21:27] his life amen that is the challenge of
[1:21:29] every child of God if God has done it
[1:21:31] for me he will do it for you also if you
[1:21:34] have done it for you he can do it for me
[1:21:36] also the only thing I have to do is to
[1:21:39] make sure that I am on his way
[1:21:42] not my way not my choice but the choice
[1:21:46] of God
[1:21:47] Hallelujah the woman said well the
[1:21:52] people are many around this man
[1:21:54] but if I can Touch the Hem of His
[1:21:57] government
[1:21:58] that's right I think that would be
[1:21:59] enough for me
[1:22:02] he didn't even request that Jesus prayed
[1:22:04] for him for her he said I will touch
[1:22:07] only the Hem of the Garment
[1:22:10] and the woman was able to crawl
[1:22:14] between the people
[1:22:16] I don't know how their legs were open
[1:22:18] anyway but she was able to crawl and
[1:22:21] touch the hand
[1:22:23] of the Garment of Jesus Christ
[1:22:27] and for the first time
[1:22:29] Jesus said
[1:22:31] Peter somebody have touched me
[1:22:37] oh Christ
[1:22:39] was that the first time somebody's
[1:22:40] touching you
[1:22:41] the answer was no
[1:22:45] Peter said Lord
[1:22:48] many people have touched you
[1:22:49] by the way before we even Gotti so so
[1:22:53] why this statement
[1:22:55] he said Peter
[1:22:57] I know
[1:22:58] that many people have touched me
[1:23:01] but all those touches were ordinary
[1:23:03] touches
[1:23:05] this particular touch is a touch of
[1:23:08] faith
[1:23:10] this particular touch was a touch of
[1:23:13] demand
[1:23:15] this particular Touch Somebody knew that
[1:23:18] he has something in me so he or she is
[1:23:21] coming for it
[1:23:23] because virtue has gone out of me
[1:23:28] oh
[1:23:29] we can imagine the faith of that woman
[1:23:32] the woman that nobody respects
[1:23:36] respect the woman that has been with
[1:23:38] infirmity for 12 good years
[1:23:41] oh brother
[1:23:42] there is something in God there is
[1:23:45] something in Jesus Christ for you
[1:23:47] go get it
[1:23:49] I said go get it
[1:23:51] Go Daddy don't let us talk
[1:23:54] amen Jesus said that you have gone out
[1:23:57] of me
[1:23:58] and then when they were looking around
[1:24:01] then the woman owned up
[1:24:03] say Lord
[1:24:05] I did touch you
[1:24:08] and this is the reason
[1:24:10] he said look at the woman
[1:24:13] he's a woman
[1:24:15] you're fake
[1:24:16] has made you whole
[1:24:20] Jesus didn't say
[1:24:22] by my power
[1:24:24] he said your faith that's right has made
[1:24:27] you whole
[1:24:29] okay the faith
[1:24:31] the faith that you use in touching me

[1:28:20] even on the cross he said it is finished
[1:28:24] and he will sit down and look at his
[1:28:27] children
[1:28:28] that we are not able to claim what
[1:28:30] belongs to us
[1:28:31] we are not able to take what belongs to
[1:28:33] us oh we are crawling sometimes or is
[1:28:38] because of our attitude
[1:28:42] our attitude
[1:28:44] sometimes a retards our progress
[1:28:48] the way we we handle Christ
[1:28:53] the way we behave as Christians
[1:28:56] sometimes it blocks our progress it
[1:28:59] doesn't make us to be an energetic you
[1:29:03] know to go for what we need to go for
[1:29:06] sometimes our thinking
[1:29:09] Hallelujah
[1:29:10] that is why Paul said let
[1:29:13] the mind of Christ
[1:29:16] be in US
[1:29:19] and if the mind of Christ in US brother
[1:29:23] we can pick anything that belongs to us

[1:30:16] when the oil is in you
[1:30:18] and your lump is being bent oh brother
[1:30:21] you cannot walk in darkness
[1:30:24] because you have your long burning all
[1:30:26] around you why because Jesus Christ is
[1:30:29] not alive in you
[1:30:33] all beloved brothers and sisters the
[1:30:36] prophet said that if we know what God
[1:30:38] has made us to be oh man we'll do
[1:30:40] exploit
[1:30:41] but sometimes we ourselves as Christians
[1:30:44] inventing here we don't know who we are
[1:30:48] true well people may see us to be
[1:30:51] ordinary
[1:30:53] but we are not ordinary like that right
[1:30:56] right we have the whole Heavens always
[1:30:58] around us
[1:30:59] because we are walking on God's way
[1:31:03] he said that if you walk by my way
[1:31:06] there is nothing that can be able to
[1:31:09] stand before you
[1:31:12] asked brother Ferguson was giving his
[1:31:14] testimony
[1:31:16] you may take it to be light
[1:31:20] but it was God's protection
[1:31:24] but God allowed that to happen for you
[1:31:27] to know that there was a trap
[1:31:30] the impact
[1:31:33] wouldn't be so much
[1:31:36] but don't think that way
[1:31:40] the impact became less because Christ
[1:31:44] stopped that thing yes
[1:31:47] but he allowed the what do you call the
[1:31:50] crash for you to know that Satan set a
[1:31:52] trap
[1:31:57] my pastor in the Pentecostal realm in
[1:32:00] those days
[1:32:02] give us a testimony about a Chinese
[1:32:05] who was working
[1:32:07] and I think
[1:32:09] there was something that fell on one of
[1:32:13] his finger
[1:32:15] and it cut deep
[1:32:17] blood was oozing and the man held that
[1:32:20] finger and said oh thank you Jesus thank
[1:32:23] you Jesus thank you Jesus
[1:32:26] and the workers
[1:32:29] you have you have such an accident and
[1:32:31] you are thanking Jesus what is wrong
[1:32:34] with you
[1:32:35] then the man said
[1:32:38] the devil had want
[1:32:40] had wanted to cut my finger completely
[1:32:42] off
[1:32:44] but Christ
[1:32:46] same the situation
[1:32:48] Hallelujah so I only have a little cut
[1:32:51] even though I'm in pain but I thank God
[1:32:53] that my finger is so intact
[1:32:56] Hallelujah because he was walking
[1:32:58] Christ's way
[1:33:01] amen
[1:33:03] no this brother and his children
[1:33:08] had the accident
[1:33:10] God removed the impact
[1:33:14] had he not been there who wouldn't know
[1:33:16] what would have happened
[1:33:19] he is always with us
[1:33:22] he is always with us you see
[1:33:25] I'm saying that let us have the mind of
[1:33:29] Christ
[1:33:31] that we are not alone
[1:33:34] in our homes
[1:33:36] at our workplaces in the schools on the
[1:33:39] streets he is always with us
[1:33:41] you always want to work with us like how
[1:33:44] he worked with cleopas and his friend
[1:33:46] and they didn't know that he was working
[1:33:48] with them oh Hallelujah they didn't know
[1:33:51] about you and I we must know
[1:33:55] Christ is with us
[1:33:57] look at the testimony I gave to you last
[1:33:59] Wednesday it was life testimony
[1:34:02] it was not an imagination something that
[1:34:04] will happen
[1:34:06] so if the sister Dorcas was not walking
[1:34:08] the way of God do you think that the
[1:34:11] angels will come and rescue him
[1:34:14] because she was working on God's will
[1:34:18] when she was kidnapped
[1:34:20] by three men four
[1:34:22] say driver let me get down
[1:34:25] the driver said no
[1:34:28] you just boarded the car why do you want
[1:34:30] to get down he said no I've forgotten
[1:34:32] something at home
[1:34:34] I have to go and get it the driver said
[1:34:36] no I'm not stopping
[1:34:39] so while they were going all of a sudden
[1:34:42] by the roadside
[1:34:43] there there were three men standing
[1:34:45] there
[1:34:47] one of them stopped the car
[1:34:49] and he said driver
[1:34:51] I have heard the voice of this woman
[1:34:54] from far
[1:34:55] that she wants to get down why are you
[1:34:59] not trying to stop for her to get down
[1:35:03] so at this juncture sister Dorcas got
[1:35:05] the chance to open the door
[1:35:07] and came out
[1:35:09] and she banged the door
[1:35:11] only to 10 and said thank you to the men
[1:35:13] and nobody was behind her
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:19] she walked God way
[1:35:21] if you walk God way brother I don't care
[1:35:24] whatever you are God will be with you
[1:35:27] sister God will be with you because he
[1:35:31] has promised in his word
[1:35:34] and when he came to tell me I said
[1:35:35] sister go and tell the church what God
[1:35:37] has done for you
[1:35:39] but it reminded me straight away when
[1:35:42] Abraham and Sarah were in their home and
[1:35:45] three men also came around
[1:35:47] oh my it was only one man among the
[1:35:51] three that spoke
[1:35:54] it has always been like that
[1:35:56] Jesus will always speak to our lives
[1:36:00] Hallelujah anything
[1:36:02] that he has for us why he will not
[1:36:05] deprive us of them
[1:36:07] it's our duty to go his way and take
[1:36:10] what belongs to us
[1:36:12] that's right amen
[1:36:15] let me let me read few things so that
[1:36:18] now
[1:36:20] he says now
[1:36:23] well now God just didn't go over there
[1:36:26] is the challenge
[1:36:28] and take a broom and sweep out the
[1:36:31] Canaanites and all the amorites and he
[1:36:33] tights and all of them and sweep sweep
[1:36:36] them out and say Come O Israel come my
[1:36:39] people this is yours
[1:36:42] even planted the cross for you no no no
[1:36:45] no no no sir God didn't do that
[1:36:48] they had to fight every inch of the way
[1:36:52] that is right yes that's why sometimes
[1:36:55] people say Christianity is hard
[1:36:58] no
[1:37:00] it's not hard you only have the mind of
[1:37:02] Christ
[1:37:04] and follow the principle of the Bible
[1:37:06] refuse the things of the world
[1:37:09] overcome the trust and temptation of the
[1:37:11] world what the word loves so much to
[1:37:13] overcome it
[1:37:15] coming and the moment you do that
[1:37:17] you'll be able
[1:37:19] Hallelujah
[1:37:23] he said they have to fight every inch of
[1:37:25] the way that is right but they hurt the
[1:37:28] promise of Victory God told Joshua
[1:37:32] whatever The Souls of your feet tread
[1:37:34] that I have given you
[1:37:37] so Footprints meant possession
[1:37:40] remember that sister
[1:37:42] Hallelujah remember that brother
[1:37:45] your Footprints means your possession
[1:37:48] every time the soul of your feet touch
[1:37:50] that is it take that much ground
[1:37:56] Hallelujah
[1:37:58] no wonder
[1:38:00] either an animal like the mama opposium
[1:38:04] can even have the mind
[1:38:08] with the wounds all over it
[1:38:12] and crawl on a highway
[1:38:16] and go and lay at the door of the
[1:38:18] Prophet right
[1:38:20] can you imagine this
[1:38:23] even if God can use this creature
[1:38:27] to go to the man of God for prayer
[1:38:31] how much more
[1:38:33] you and I amen
[1:38:35] who God have given part of his himself
[1:38:41] how much more
[1:38:43] the prophet met the Apostle he said hey
[1:38:46] what are you doing here
[1:38:48] why don't you go to the bush
[1:38:51] I'm a right man to kill right now and
[1:38:53] make good use of you
[1:38:56] and the prophet entered into his room
[1:39:00] picked certain things and came back
[1:39:03] the opposal was still there
[1:39:06] and when you look around
[1:39:09] it was full of wounds
[1:39:12] then all of a sudden
[1:39:14] the Spirit came down to the prophet
[1:39:17] say no
[1:39:18] something is happening and I've not
[1:39:21] realized that
[1:39:23] this creature is here for prayer that's
[1:39:25] right
[1:39:27] so he removed his heart
[1:39:29] and knelt
[1:39:31] laid his hand upon the creature and
[1:39:34] prayed a simple prayer Lord
[1:39:37] if this is the reason why this opposom
[1:39:40] is here
[1:39:41] granted the healing
[1:39:44] immediately
[1:39:47] immediately
[1:39:51] all the wounds vanish from the creature
[1:39:55] and this of them
[1:39:59] climb the ladder
[1:40:03] and went to the shelves
[1:40:06] and pick what belonged to it
[1:40:10] and when it was healed you know what he
[1:40:12] did
[1:40:14] Bow Down
[1:40:16] a head
[1:40:18] before the prophet
[1:40:20] it went back again did the same thing it
[1:40:23] went back again the third time then
[1:40:26] you know this creature was thanking God
[1:40:30] for the healing
[1:40:33] this creature was recognizing that God
[1:40:37] indeed worked in mysterious ways
[1:40:41] and if it happened to an opposal
[1:40:45] how much more
[1:40:47] you
[1:40:50] who have been baptized
[1:40:52] no purchased
[1:40:54] by the blood of Jesus Christ and you
[1:40:57] have been baptized he said he knew you
[1:41:00] before the foundation of the world Amen
[1:41:02] so all our ways are already prepared by
[1:41:06] God beloved let us go God's way
[1:41:10] the world has nothing to offer
[1:41:13] don't let us lean on our own
[1:41:16] understanding let us always come into

[1:41:54] that is it

[1:41:59] what the prophet said let's kick certain
[1:42:00] things out yes you understand that
[1:42:02] statement

[1:42:06] way kick it out

[1:43:13] that can bring you freedom
[1:43:15] only the way of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:43:18] Hallelujah
[1:43:21] beloved brothers and sisters
[1:43:23] in order not to keep you so much longer
[1:43:26] let me read my last quote okay
[1:43:28] and then we'll call it
[1:43:31] he says
[1:43:33] God's word is
[1:43:35] a seed
[1:43:38] God is in his word
[1:43:41] look at him when he makes his word
[1:43:44] manifest
[1:43:46] his promises or what he will do look at
[1:43:50] a hundred and twenty people taking God's
[1:43:52] word
[1:43:54] um
[1:43:54] they went up to the day of Pentacles and
[1:43:57] waited until that Commission
[1:44:00] he said tarrier in the city of Jerusalem
[1:44:03] until you are endured with power from on
[1:44:06] high
[1:44:07] God's word sunk into their hearts
[1:44:10] and they waited
[1:44:12] they waited
[1:44:15] hmm
[1:44:17] what was or what were they doing
[1:44:21] just sitting around
[1:44:22] saying well I'll see what will happen
[1:44:25] hmm
[1:44:26] you can't water it that way
[1:44:29] that's what the prophet said you can't
[1:44:31] water it that way oh well the promise is
[1:44:34] there but well I'll fold my hands let me
[1:44:37] sit down and see what will happen no
[1:44:38] right you don't progress by that
[1:44:42] you don't progress by that
[1:44:44] right huh
[1:44:45] anything even when you come to the
[1:44:47] Physical Realm those Athletics those who
[1:44:51] go on Sports they always do exercise
[1:44:54] the train because they want they are
[1:44:58] what do we call it they want to get more
[1:45:00] uh
[1:45:01] oh there's a term
[1:45:03] ah there's a term that they use they
[1:45:05] want to get more stamina
[1:45:06] so they can stand and as Christians we
[1:45:10] don't sit down and fold our hands
[1:45:12] and think that things are going to draw
[1:45:14] from the sky for us to pick them on the
[1:45:17] ground
[1:45:18] in those days that God brought the
[1:45:20] manner Hallelujah even the manner felt
[1:45:23] quite all right but the manner didn't go
[1:45:26] into their homes they went on their
[1:45:28] field to gather them
[1:45:32] are you catching it so the prophet said
[1:45:34] that you don't water it that way that oh
[1:45:37] I have the promise of God I fold my
[1:45:39] hands and I said no
[1:45:41] you must be in action
[1:45:45] what happened
[1:45:46] he said you don't water it that way
[1:45:50] if you say well yes I believe in Divine
[1:45:53] Healing oh sure it is in the Bible yes
[1:45:56] it's in the Bible that is not the way to
[1:45:59] get healed
[1:46:00] you might have the seed but you got to
[1:46:03] water it
[1:46:05] you got to water it brother water your
[1:46:08] face sister what are your faith
[1:46:10] and let's go get what belongs to us in
[1:46:13] Jesus Christ
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:15] he said when they were in the upper room
[1:46:18] they were blessing and thanking and
[1:46:22] praising God why praising him because
[1:46:25] they knew it was coming amen
[1:46:28] for they had the seed in their hearts
[1:46:31] God's promise
[1:46:34] hmm
[1:46:37] many times
[1:46:39] you see Believers so happy
[1:46:44] beautiful face nice face
[1:46:47] because everything is going on well
[1:46:51] [Laughter]
[1:46:54] but when they begin to face challenges
[1:46:57] oh
[1:46:58] sometimes they don't even want to come
[1:47:00] to church
[1:47:02] but staying from church that does solve
[1:47:05] your problem
[1:47:09] no becoming present yourself so
[1:47:12] miserable oh I don't have food I don't
[1:47:15] have anything to eat today
[1:47:18] oh Lord what am I going to do and you
[1:47:21] sit down
[1:47:22] will God bring you food
[1:47:25] no
[1:47:26] that is why
[1:47:28] in all things we must rejoice
[1:47:32] we must Rejoice look let us show to the
[1:47:35] devil that we are stubborn to him
[1:47:40] under no circumstance we allow the devil
[1:47:43] to make us sad
[1:47:46] no
[1:47:47] that of us
[1:47:49] we have to clean things out let anything
[1:47:52] any hindrance obstacles that the devil
[1:47:54] tried to put on you take it out

[1:48:02] God as if nothing has happened praise
[1:48:04] God as if nothing has happened and that
[1:48:06] was what they were doing in the upper
[1:48:09] room according to the court of the
[1:48:10] Prophet amen
[1:48:11] even though
[1:48:13] the Pharisees and the services were
[1:48:15] looking all over the place to arrest
[1:48:18] them and perhaps kill them
[1:48:20] but they were not quiet
[1:48:22] they gathered at the upper room and they
[1:48:25] were praising God they were worshiping
[1:48:27] God and the prophet said that you know
[1:48:29] why he said because they knew that their
[1:48:31] promise was coming
