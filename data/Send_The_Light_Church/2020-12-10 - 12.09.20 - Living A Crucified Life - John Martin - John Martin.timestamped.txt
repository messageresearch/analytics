[22:33] requests
[22:35] but i know there's many needs amen
[22:38] sometimes it seems like there's too many
[22:40] but
[22:41] the lord still wants us to bring them to
[22:43] them you know
[22:44] and sometimes i think we stop short
[22:48] i know i do and that brings to christ
[22:54] so let's just remember all those that
[22:56] aren't here amen
[22:58] remember all the loved ones that

[32:08] for me
[32:10] [Music]
[32:12] if i live a holy light

[32:20] no the lord will make a way
[32:24] for me
[32:29] amen we all
[32:33] are in that place of learning to shun
[32:37] the wrong
[32:39] and do the right and
[32:43] where we mess up
[32:46] we have the blood of christ to claim
[32:50] and but i believe he wants us to
[32:53] continue to strive
[32:55] to live a holy life i think the bible
[32:58] declares without holiness
[33:02] no man shall see the lord
[33:05] and it's just it's a striving
[33:08] it's not a comparing with one another
[33:10] it's a striving
[33:12] to become more like jesus well god bless
[33:15] you this evening sure good to see
[33:16] everyone in god's house and
[33:19] good to see sister linda back amen
[33:23] praise god we're grateful to see you
[33:26] amen and
[33:31] sister cheryl wanted me to make mention
[33:33] if you see her
[33:34] get cut out here a little bit from time
[33:37] to time
[33:39] the doctor has asked her to limit her
[33:43] exposure with her immune system
[33:47] she really doesn't go out anywhere and
[33:49] do anything
[33:50] i mean this is this is it and she's
[33:54] comes here to
[33:56] to be a blessing to us to help us if we
[33:58] had a full orchestra here
[34:00] you know it would be different but
[34:04] let's just pray that god continues to
[34:06] put a hedge of protection around her
[34:09] amen i wouldn't want to have her immune
[34:12] system
[34:14] you know we are we're fortunate to have
[34:17] a strong immune system
[34:20] brother roger and sister trisha wanted
[34:22] us to express
[34:24] their gratefulness
[34:28] for your continued prayers for them
[34:31] during this time
[34:32] and as you know this is not something
[34:34] that
[34:36] gets over in any time
[34:39] soon things get easier but then
[34:43] thoughts would come and it would become
[34:46] very hard
[34:47] and so i'll just say anytime that the
[34:49] lord would
[34:51] put them on your heart please continue
[34:53] to pray for them they appreciate your
[34:55] continued prayers
[34:56] and for the kindness that everybody is
[34:58] shown towards them in various ways
[35:01] it has touched their hearts and they
[35:03] wanted uh you to know
[35:05] how much it meant to them so god bless
[35:07] you for that and
[35:09] you know we're a small church but uh
[35:12] when you when you stay united
[35:16] you can be a great blessing one to
[35:18] another
[35:19] and we're just appreciate every one of
[35:22] you just
[35:24] loving the lord by loving god's children
[35:28] amen turn with me if you would to the
[35:30] book of
[35:31] galatians chapter 2 very familiar
[35:34] scripture
[35:36] we've read it many times i could say
[35:38] this that
[35:39] i believe ann told me this is her
[35:41] favorite scripture in the bible
[35:44] amen galatians chapter 2 verse number
[35:48] 20.
[35:53] amen let's read this scripture and then
[35:56] we'll go to the lord in prayer amen
[36:00] paul saying to the galatian church i am
[36:03] crucified
[36:04] with christ nevertheless
[36:07] i live yet it's
[36:10] not i but it's christ that lives in me
[36:14] and the life which i now live in the
[36:16] flesh
[36:17] i live by the faith of the son of god
[36:20] who
[36:20] loved me and gave himself for me
[36:24] amen let's bow to the author
[36:28] father we've looked into your word
[36:33] we've read this scripture many times it
[36:36] means
[36:37] very much to us
[36:42] lord we're asking humbly that you would
[36:46] unveil just a little bit more of
[36:48] yourself to us today
[36:50] give us eyes to see ears to hear
[36:54] a heart that understands
[36:57] and lord that we could become more
[37:00] like you that's our prayer today
[37:04] to the ministry of the word may you
[37:07] you you meet needs
[37:10] in all of our lives lord you can
[37:14] take just one word from this
[37:18] precious book of yours and quicken
[37:22] it to all of our hearts and meet
[37:25] all of our needs lord in an hour when
[37:29] our faith is being tested and
[37:33] and fear in men's
[37:36] hearts is on a rise we need
[37:40] you the author and the finisher of our
[37:44] faith
[37:45] god increase faith in our hearts and
[37:48] help us to see you living in your word
[37:51] today
[37:52] bless this word to our hearts quicken it
[37:55] to us and
[37:56] we commit this now into your hands
[38:00] in jesus precious name we pray amen god
[38:04] bless you may be
[38:05] seated
[38:09] i just want to say how thankful i am to
[38:11] everybody that's
[38:13] live streaming amen
[38:18] may the lord jesus continue
[38:22] to meet with you in your homes and bless
[38:24] you with his presence and just reveal
[38:26] the word
[38:27] there to you now
[38:32] we want to entitle this message living a
[38:35] crucified
[38:36] life this is i'll say not
[38:40] a popular subject and not
[38:43] one that we feel um
[38:46] real comfortable with and we've kind of
[38:49] given it a negative connotation
[38:52] about suffering and i would like
[38:55] uh to go beyond that to go beyond that
[38:59] and i just need you to be patient
[39:02] with me this is uh such
[39:05] an important subject when we get into
[39:08] the depth
[39:09] of the meaning and when it's faithfully
[39:12] executed in her life
[39:14] it can yield benefits that can only be
[39:19] that can only come forth from living a
[39:22] crucified life so
[39:23] one aspect is i i'm suffering
[39:28] in this moment i'm crucifying myself in
[39:30] this moment
[39:31] and paul i believe was referring
[39:35] to a crucified life not just a certain
[39:39] situation or a certain period in his
[39:41] life
[39:42] but a life that he lived so i'd like to
[39:45] start out by making this statement
[39:47] to properly live for christ means to
[39:51] live
[39:52] a crucified life that's a strong
[39:55] statement but that's how important it is
[39:58] it may seem like an oxymoron
[40:01] to to live for christ and to be
[40:03] crucified to live and to die
[40:06] but it's a simultaneously because we
[40:09] have a
[40:10] carnal nature that that we're born with
[40:13] and that even though we become born
[40:15] again
[40:16] it's it wants to creep its head out
[40:19] we know paul was born again amen
[40:23] yet he had to continue to keep his flesh
[40:27] under subjection
[40:31] the entire church world would most
[40:34] likely defend that they live
[40:36] for christ regardless of whether they
[40:39] are
[40:40] crucifying their flesh at all
[40:43] but to properly properly live for christ
[40:47] means we need to live a crucified life
[40:51] brother brandon
[40:53] helped bring a little light to this
[40:55] statement when he said it took
[40:56] a hundred lots to make just one abraham
[41:01] a hundred lots to make one abraham so
[41:04] there's different degrees
[41:06] of living a crucified life
[41:10] abraham was completely sold out
[41:14] to god he did what god told him to do
[41:19] he obeyed not even knowing where he was
[41:21] going
[41:23] he learned not to lean to his own
[41:25] understanding
[41:27] he separated from everything and he
[41:30] walked with a burden for others
[41:35] now a lot on the other hand he was not
[41:37] completely sold out
[41:39] right he was a believer
[41:42] but he wasn't sold out he
[41:46] he leaned to his own understanding he
[41:49] chose the easier path
[41:52] right he chose the easier way to serve
[41:55] the lord
[41:57] he didn't separate from everything
[42:00] his burden was for himself
[42:03] it was he wanted to become a mayor
[42:07] i mean it was about him and building his
[42:10] kingdom
[42:10] right true so there are simply different
[42:14] degrees of living a crucified life
[42:20] and what we want to do is try to just
[42:21] get into this a little bit because
[42:23] you know when we when we hear scriptures
[42:25] like this or we talk about this
[42:27] you know there's that cringe and that's
[42:29] oh no not again
[42:31] you know we don't have to be afraid of
[42:34] dying out
[42:37] there's benefits there's such benefits
[42:42] jesus was well aware of the different
[42:46] degrees and how men would
[42:49] uh look view and understand
[42:52] that
[42:57] people are not going to know what it
[42:59] really means
[43:00] to die out for him nor to live for him
[43:04] even his own disciples remember peter he
[43:07] thought he would go
[43:08] so far that he would be willing to die
[43:14] and then we found out he was denied that
[43:17] he even had a relationship
[43:19] with jesus
[43:23] god understands that people do not
[43:26] see clearly what it means to live for
[43:30] god
[43:31] to die out for god mark chapter 10 verse
[43:38] 35.
[43:43] and james and john
[43:47] the sons of zebedee they came to jesus
[43:50] saying master
[43:52] we would that thou should has do for us
[43:56] whatsoever we shall desire
[43:59] isn't that the typical carnal
[44:06] christian
[44:08] and he said unto them what would
[44:11] ye that i should do for you
[44:16] and they said unto him grant unto us
[44:18] that we may sit
[44:20] one on my right hand and one on thy left
[44:23] hand
[44:24] in thy glory
[44:28] now was that fair to you brother mark
[44:32] was there no consideration for the other
[44:35] children
[44:40] but see this is how we can get sometimes
[44:43] in our
[44:44] desires for god are just about us
[44:48] now if they said you know we just we
[44:50] want to better serve you better please
[44:52] you better understand
[44:54] how to serve you well that's not selfish
[44:57] and that's not wrong
[45:02] look how jesus answered in verse 38
[45:06] he said you know not what you're asking
[45:13] can you drink of the cup that that i
[45:16] drink of
[45:18] and be baptized with the baptism that i
[45:21] am baptized with
[45:25] can you completely crucify yourself
[45:28] and surrender yourself over to the will
[45:31] of god
[45:33] that's what he was asking
[45:36] because they're wanting to sit right
[45:38] next to jesus
[45:41] and then he asked if you want to sit
[45:43] next to me
[45:44] can you crucify your flesh like i can
[45:49] can you give up your will completely to
[45:52] the father
[45:53] because if you want the reward
[45:59] didn't jesus say to him that overcometh
[46:01] i'll grant to sit with me on my throne
[46:03] as i have overcame
[46:04] and sat with my father and his amen
[46:08] so this is the question he goes right
[46:09] back and he talks to them
[46:11] about the sacrifice a sacrificial life
[46:15] that they would live
[46:16] not how many great deeds he would do
[46:20] but a life of crucifixion
[46:24] that's what he's staring at and that's
[46:26] what he's wanting them
[46:28] to to to to view it's why he asked the
[46:31] question
[46:32] romans we're going to go back uh to this
[46:35] but i just want to read romans chapter
[46:37] six
[46:38] verses number three and number four
[46:43] because it's it's an important question
[46:44] that jesus asked he says
[46:46] and paul said here to the romans he says
[46:48] know ye not that
[46:50] so many of us as were baptized into
[46:54] jesus christ
[46:56] were baptized into his
[46:59] death
[47:02] therefore we are buried with him by
[47:04] baptism
[47:05] into death that like as christ was
[47:08] raised up from the dead by the glory of
[47:10] the father even so
[47:11] we should walk in newness of life
[47:16] now what most people want to do is they
[47:19] want to become the perfect
[47:20] christian without any crucifixion
[47:24] it it just can't be done
[47:29] going back i just want to finish that up
[47:32] there in mark chapter 10 verse 39
[47:34] and verse 40 and they said and they
[47:37] said unto him we can not knowing exactly
[47:42] and jesus said unto him ye shall indeed
[47:45] drink of the cup that i drink of and be
[47:47] baptized with the baptism where shall he
[47:50] be baptized but to sit on my right hand
[47:53] and on my left hand
[47:54] is not for me to give but it shall be
[47:56] given to them
[47:57] for whom it is prepared notice it's not
[48:01] handed out like
[48:03] you know i know i'm sorry i know
[48:07] to the best of my ability of knowing i
[48:10] will not be sitting on the right hand
[48:12] and on the left or the left hand i'm
[48:15] pretty sure
[48:16] that is prepared for those who have
[48:18] given who've
[48:20] partook of self-crucifixion the most
[48:24] who have given their life over to do the
[48:27] will of the father
[48:28] the most i think that's who it's
[48:31] prepared for
[48:33] because that's the question that jesus
[48:35] asked
[48:39] in luke chapter 9 jesus shows how people
[48:44] are willing to follow him but they don't
[48:46] realize the cost
[48:49] behind it the cost that's involved
[48:52] with following the lord properly because
[48:55] there's a proper way to follow the lord
[48:57] and not a proper way to follow the lord
[49:00] properly
[49:01] is you are right there following his
[49:04] steps as he's taking them one step at a
[49:07] time
[49:08] the improper way is to follow jesus from
[49:11] afar
[49:12] like peter did still following
[49:15] his heart's not there he doesn't have
[49:17] faith in what he's doing
[49:19] he's full of fear
[49:25] there's our way that we want to follow
[49:27] the lord and then there's
[49:29] his way that he wants us to follow the
[49:31] lord it's true amen
[49:33] the cause to follow the lord our way is
[49:35] much
[49:36] cheaper than the cost of following the
[49:39] lord
[49:40] his way the cost of following the lord
[49:44] his way
[49:45] is a crucified life
[49:48] luke chapter 9 verse 57 if we could go
[49:51] through these scriptures luke chapter 9
[49:53] verse 57 and it came to pass that as
[49:56] they went
[49:56] in the way a certain man said unto him
[49:59] lord
[50:00] i will follow thee whether so ever thou
[50:04] goest so there's this i'm gonna do it
[50:07] and look how jesus responds he didn't
[50:09] say oh that's great i'm looking for
[50:11] followers
[50:14] he says i want you to understand that
[50:16] the foxes have holes and the birds
[50:19] of the air have nests but the son of man
[50:21] have not
[50:23] where to lay his head
[50:26] in other words it's not going to be easy
[50:29] the birds got it easier the foxes
[50:33] they got a place just i don't have that
[50:37] it's not going to be easy it's going to
[50:39] be a straight and narrow path
[50:42] you're going to be forced to do things
[50:44] that you don't want to do
[50:51] and i'll say it like this there are some
[50:54] people that catch a glimpse
[50:56] that it's going to be a harder way but
[50:59] you know what
[51:00] they want to do other things first
[51:04] he talks about that right here in the
[51:06] next four verses
[51:09] and then he said to another follow me
[51:11] and he said lord
[51:12] suffer me first to go
[51:16] and bury my father no i don't know what
[51:19] this was really referring to because i
[51:21] didn't
[51:25] was he wanting to stay home for a while
[51:26] until his dad had passed away and
[51:28] then he would go follow i don't know i
[51:31] don't know what he meant
[51:32] but one thing is sure he wanted to put
[51:36] something else first
[51:41] jesus said unto him let the dead bury
[51:43] the dead but go
[51:45] thou and preach the kingdom of god in
[51:48] other words
[51:49] that's what's important
[51:52] amen and another said also lord i will
[51:56] follow thee but let me
[51:57] first go bid them farewell
[52:00] which are at home at my house and jesus
[52:04] said unto him no man haven't put his
[52:06] hand to the plow looking back is fit
[52:08] for the kingdom of god think about how
[52:12] god
[52:12] is viewing your intentions in following
[52:15] him
[52:16] he doesn't want second place
[52:21] now this is just not a denomination or
[52:24] belief or a non-denominational belief or
[52:27] a
[52:27] message belief this is a jesus belief
[52:31] like a god belief this is what the bible
[52:34] says
[52:37] now to come to grips with this you can't
[52:40] really do it in your flesh
[52:44] the majority of the people who start out
[52:46] to follow jesus
[52:47] do not continue that's just the facts
[52:53] they don't endure to the end they don't
[52:55] hold that confidence they had at the
[52:57] beginning
[52:59] jesus said in matthew 24 13 but he
[53:02] that shall endure to the end
[53:06] the same shall be saved now notice when
[53:09] a a a a lot of ministers are given the
[53:12] invitation to come
[53:14] and give your heart to jesus none of
[53:16] them say
[53:17] if you come now make sure you understand
[53:20] you're not going to get saved until you
[53:22] endure to the end
[53:26] but it's part of the gospel it's part of
[53:28] the gospel
[53:30] god is looking for commitment you know
[53:33] that's right i don't know how to say it
[53:35] it's just it's just it's just
[53:37] it's commitment and we all want that we
[53:39] even want that in our friendships with
[53:41] one another
[53:43] if i make a mistake and i i say
[53:45] something wrong or i get upset at you
[53:48] i i i don't want you to just leave me
[53:53] we got to be willing to
[53:56] to go through hebrews chapter 3 verse
[54:00] 14.
[54:02] the writers say in the book of hebrews
[54:04] we are made
[54:05] partakers of christ if we hold the
[54:09] beginning
[54:10] confidence steadfast unto the end of our
[54:13] walk
[54:16] we can't just you know i'm a partaker as
[54:19] soon as i got baptized as soon as i
[54:21] repented as soon as i that's good for
[54:24] that part
[54:25] but every day that goes by is another
[54:28] day of salvation
[54:30] because today is the day of salvation
[54:33] i mean yes we've started the walk yes
[54:35] this is where it started we can say that
[54:40] but the next day is a new day where you
[54:43] make choices
[54:44] about your will to do god's will or to
[54:48] do your own
[54:50] hebrews chapter 10 verse 35
[54:54] and we're just again laying one of these
[54:56] lengthy foundations
[54:59] hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 cast not
[55:02] away therefore your confidence
[55:06] which have great recompense of reward
[55:08] for
[55:09] you have need of patience
[55:12] and that after you've done the will of
[55:14] god you might receive the promise
[55:17] for yet a little while and he that shall
[55:20] come will come and will
[55:22] not tarry now the just
[55:26] shall live by faith is that not what our
[55:29] opening scripture said
[55:30] paul lived by the faith of the son of
[55:33] god
[55:34] now the judge shall live by faith but if
[55:37] any man
[55:38] draw back in other words he begins to
[55:41] not
[55:41] live by faith that's really good
[55:46] maybe a carnal understanding maybe a
[55:48] feeling
[55:49] maybe uh well just see what happens
[55:54] right my soul shall have no pleasure in
[55:56] him but we are none of them that draw
[55:58] back
[55:59] unto perdition but of them that believe
[56:01] to the saving
[56:03] of the soul which is in the end
[56:06] i'm really not you know it would be
[56:09] wrong for me
[56:10] to just say i know that i'm saved no
[56:12] matter what i'm saved
[56:13] and then just go out live in the world
[56:15] but every time you talk to me i'm going
[56:17] to tell you i'm safe
[56:21] i think we should just settle on every
[56:23] day we need to live for jesus
[56:25] just settle on it and and let the end
[56:30] be the end let it let it be our
[56:32] testimony the end
[56:34] of course we're going to have pitfalls
[56:36] along the but i i i tell you
[56:39] just get back up you get back up
[56:42] yeah he never
[56:46] said he that never falls
[56:49] to the end is going to be saved that's
[56:51] not what he said
[56:53] just to get back up we're not perfect
[56:56] but we learn to get back up and and be
[56:59] faithful at serving the lord even i
[57:00] believe the lord is pleased with that
[57:03] now most of us have heard the prophet
[57:06] say that
[57:07] we were with him at calvary
[57:10] we were with him when he rose out of the
[57:12] tomb remember when he spoke like that
[57:14] yeah we could not only identify with him
[57:18] at that point but we were also
[57:21] with him at calvary we were apart inside
[57:25] of him
[57:25] is that true therefore we
[57:29] when he was crucified we were crucified
[57:32] with him at calvary
[57:33] in message spiritual amnesia
[57:38] brother branham said i most surely
[57:42] with him at calvary i must be identified
[57:45] with him at calvary
[57:47] i must be there to a place that
[57:50] where not also was i identified with him
[57:53] at calvary
[57:54] i died with him at calvary
[57:57] and every christian must die with him
[58:00] at calvary if you don't die with him at
[58:04] calvary
[58:05] you can't be none of his i was there
[58:09] when he died
[58:10] i died with him i was
[58:14] and then i was with him when he raised
[58:17] up from the dead
[58:18] and i come up on easter morning with him
[58:22] in the resurrection whatever he did i
[58:25] was right there with him
[58:26] every believer was the same
[58:30] now brother branham is referring to i
[58:32] being identified with christ in the past
[58:37] and most believers can identify with
[58:39] that
[58:40] but paul in our opening scripture was
[58:43] not identifying
[58:44] a past tense he was identifying being
[58:48] crucified
[58:49] with christ in a present tense
[58:53] i just want to read another
[58:56] one more quote brother branham said in
[58:58] the message the cruelty of sin and the
[59:00] penalty that it caused
[59:01] to rid sin from our lives brother man
[59:04] says oh
[59:05] why don't you crawl up calvary
[59:08] yonder tonight hallelujah let your
[59:11] own life be hacked out and die yonder
[59:15] on the cross with him throw your arms
[59:18] around the rock of angels cleft for me
[59:20] let me hide myself in thee while
[59:24] the near old waters roll while the
[59:27] tempest still is high
[59:29] hide me oh my savior hide me let the
[59:32] world
[59:33] do whatever they want to do let the
[59:34] theologians do what they want to do
[59:36] i don't want their theology i want
[59:40] what i want is jesus christ in my heart
[59:43] let me die with the lamb oh i know how
[59:47] hard it was that night
[59:49] he's referring to when he gave his heart
[59:51] to the lord when i walked
[59:53] into that little old colored mission
[59:56] church out there and all the white folks
[1:00:00] who are standing out there
[1:00:01] said there he goes into a colored
[1:00:04] mission
[1:00:05] wow brother brandon says it was hard
[1:00:09] i walked up there with my
[1:00:12] with a whole lot of kentucky pride in me
[1:00:15] yeah
[1:00:16] like that but god said if you want it
[1:00:20] walk right on in there
[1:00:23] and i walked right in there and knelt
[1:00:25] down at the altar and there i
[1:00:27] stayed until the lamb i died
[1:00:30] to my old self bill branham 20 years old
[1:00:35] hallelujah it was about a
[1:00:39] dying out to receive christ amen
[1:00:43] and he says these words i was crucified
[1:00:47] with christ i was
[1:00:51] crucified with christ amen
[1:00:54] but paul speaking here in a present
[1:00:57] tense
[1:00:59] galatians chapter 2 verse 20 he said i
[1:01:02] am crucified with christ
[1:01:06] i am crucified with christ
[1:01:10] but he wanted to make it clear that he
[1:01:14] that he was alive
[1:01:18] so there was a crucifixion going on and
[1:01:21] there was a life
[1:01:22] going on happening all at the same time
[1:01:25] in his life in his body
[1:01:29] and he's trying to explain it
[1:01:32] uh yet it's not i but it's christ that
[1:01:35] liveth in me
[1:01:37] and the life which i now live in the
[1:01:39] flesh i lived by the faith of the son of
[1:01:41] god
[1:01:41] who loved me and gave himself for me it
[1:01:43] was almost like he was expressing
[1:01:45] another life was taking over
[1:01:50] another life was taking over inside of
[1:01:52] him amen
[1:01:54] so it's not a natural
[1:01:57] physical crucifixion right
[1:02:01] you couldn't be physically crucified and
[1:02:03] be alive at the same time
[1:02:07] paul said in second timothy chapter four
[1:02:10] verse number six
[1:02:12] for i am now ready to be offered in the
[1:02:15] time of my departures at hand
[1:02:16] so paul at this place was
[1:02:20] offering his body
[1:02:25] so because you know once you once you
[1:02:27] die that's it
[1:02:31] you you die once the bible says and then
[1:02:33] the judgment
[1:02:34] so paul's not referring to the physical
[1:02:37] death
[1:02:39] paul is referring to living a crucified
[1:02:42] life
[1:02:44] where christ was able to live inside of
[1:02:46] him now
[1:02:47] our thinking that the devil wants to
[1:02:49] tell us
[1:02:50] is that christ can live in you
[1:02:53] regardless
[1:02:54] of whether you live a crucified life or
[1:02:56] not
[1:02:58] and all i'm going to say to that
[1:03:00] statement because i don't want to
[1:03:02] debate it but all i'm going to tell you
[1:03:04] is there's different degrees
[1:03:07] there's different degrees and god is
[1:03:10] calling the bride
[1:03:11] to a total sell-off
[1:03:15] christ can only be presently manifested
[1:03:17] in our lives
[1:03:18] to the amount that we are presently
[1:03:20] crucified
[1:03:24] we do not ever get to the place that we
[1:03:27] do not need
[1:03:28] to ever be crucified anymore
[1:03:31] that would mean that your selfish nature
[1:03:34] would have been
[1:03:35] permanently annihilated
[1:03:38] and if you just want to know the truth
[1:03:39] all you got to do is get up the next
[1:03:42] morning
[1:03:45] paul never thought nor preached
[1:03:48] that christ could live in him outside of
[1:03:52] his flesh
[1:03:53] being crucified first
[1:03:56] paul said that he died on a daily basis
[1:04:01] most people want to believe that
[1:04:03] regardless of living a crucified life
[1:04:05] they that christ is still living inside
[1:04:08] of them
[1:04:12] okay so if i get really mad and upset
[1:04:15] and i hit somebody and i knock him down
[1:04:18] my question to you is is christ living
[1:04:21] in me
[1:04:25] come on am i am i born again is christ
[1:04:28] living in me
[1:04:29] do you see how hard and confusing the
[1:04:32] question is
[1:04:35] that christ wouldn't do that
[1:04:40] but yet i'll defend that christ is
[1:04:42] living in me
[1:04:44] no matter what i will never say no
[1:04:47] christ wasn't in me
[1:04:56] but we do see this one thing that if i
[1:04:59] do do that
[1:05:00] you see a need that i my flesh needs to
[1:05:02] be crucified
[1:05:04] that we do see clearly and that's really
[1:05:08] the the message is so we can understand
[1:05:10] that we need to
[1:05:11] live a crucified life to stay in the
[1:05:14] state
[1:05:15] of a crucified mindset
[1:05:19] we're going to get to the good stuff
[1:05:22] this is the hard stuff
[1:05:25] as believers oftentimes we can fight
[1:05:28] a negative connotation about
[1:05:32] dying daily
[1:05:35] about denying our flesh mortifying the
[1:05:37] deeds of the body crucifying our wealth
[1:05:39] or picking up our cross just a
[1:05:42] negativity
[1:05:43] that goes with that that i don't want to
[1:05:45] hear that no more
[1:05:50] whereas sermons that refer to walking in
[1:05:52] the spirit
[1:05:53] praying in the spirit being led more of
[1:05:56] the spirit
[1:05:56] god using us in the spirit has a more
[1:06:00] positive acceptance
[1:06:04] but in reality they work hand in hand
[1:06:08] one opens the door to the other
[1:06:12] we don't want to bypass one and try
[1:06:15] just to the other because then it
[1:06:17] becomes a carnal
[1:06:19] a carnality of serving god a carnality
[1:06:23] of god's in me if christ is going to be
[1:06:27] seen in you it's
[1:06:28] it's because you're dead to the flesh
[1:06:40] i see two mainstreams of thinking
[1:06:44] when it comes to living a crucified life
[1:06:47] one is negative and the other is
[1:06:50] positive i want to talk about the
[1:06:51] negative one first
[1:06:55] when you're fighting the crucified of
[1:06:58] yourself
[1:06:59] while walking in the will of your flesh
[1:07:03] it is a negativity
[1:07:08] you you don't want to do it
[1:07:12] because you're in your flesh your flesh
[1:07:14] wants to have its way
[1:07:16] it's not encouraging it's not exciting
[1:07:19] and
[1:07:20] quite frankly i don't want to be
[1:07:22] reminded about it anymore thank you
[1:07:26] in other words there isn't anything
[1:07:28] positive about the subject
[1:07:30] so get off of it and that's good
[1:07:33] and i like just want to say that this is
[1:07:35] a a negative way
[1:07:37] of viewing living a crucified life but i
[1:07:40] want to talk about a positive way
[1:07:43] it's where you're focused on how much
[1:07:46] more you'll be able to do for the lord
[1:07:48] amen how much more you'll be able to
[1:07:50] please the lord that you're not able to
[1:07:52] do when you're in the flesh
[1:07:56] it is the answer to walking closer
[1:07:59] to jesus it will make jesus smile
[1:08:03] towards you when your flesh has been
[1:08:05] crucified
[1:08:07] it will bring more of a spiritual
[1:08:09] purpose to your life
[1:08:11] it will open the door for spiritual
[1:08:13] fulfillment
[1:08:15] it opens a door to joy to peace and
[1:08:18] being able to love
[1:08:20] amen love everyone the way that he loves
[1:08:24] to think of others without respect to
[1:08:26] persons or without
[1:08:28] judgment and this can't happen if you
[1:08:30] haven't crucified the flesh
[1:08:33] so i want to look at this tonight in a
[1:08:36] positive
[1:08:37] manner the benefits that you get from
[1:08:40] doing it
[1:08:42] the negative view is always about what
[1:08:45] you have to give up
[1:08:46] which is your will but a positive view
[1:08:50] is about what you can gain it's about
[1:08:53] what you're gaining
[1:08:54] by doing it the focus is on what you get
[1:08:57] out of it
[1:08:57] not what you got to give up
[1:09:02] and when you exercise the love part of
[1:09:05] your relationship with god
[1:09:08] giving up your flesh becomes easier
[1:09:11] if it's just a law i got to do this i
[1:09:14] got to do that
[1:09:15] but you don't see the purpose of god
[1:09:19] behind it you don't see the fulfillment
[1:09:22] of god's joy behind that right i have no
[1:09:25] greater joy than to hear my children
[1:09:27] walk in truth
[1:09:28] god gets happy when we do things and and
[1:09:30] sad
[1:09:31] when we don't do the right things it's
[1:09:34] part of our relationship
[1:09:37] and we're it's we're just growing saints
[1:09:40] we're growing there
[1:09:44] on mount olive in the garden named
[1:09:46] gethsemane
[1:09:47] jesus agonized and he battled in prayer
[1:09:51] he had spent years in his ministry
[1:09:54] sharing
[1:09:55] that he would be crucified and it didn't
[1:09:57] seem to be
[1:09:58] much of a problem to him just to those
[1:10:01] that he spoke
[1:10:03] right no this ain't going to happen
[1:10:04] we're not going to let it happen
[1:10:08] but when the time had come when he was
[1:10:11] in that garden he
[1:10:12] battled a great warfare in his mind
[1:10:16] he searched for ways in his mind to
[1:10:19] bypass
[1:10:21] this cup of crucifixion
[1:10:24] now i'm sure the devil was right there
[1:10:26] bringing more confusion
[1:10:28] to his mind the bible said that jesus
[1:10:32] fell on his face and prayed saying oh
[1:10:35] father
[1:10:36] if it be possible let this cup
[1:10:40] pass from me
[1:10:43] it wasn't just a cup of suffering
[1:10:45] friends
[1:10:47] it was a cup of self-crucifixion
[1:10:50] let this cup of self-crucifixion
[1:10:54] pass from me
[1:10:57] now when we're asked to go the second
[1:11:01] mile
[1:11:03] to give up your time for somebody else
[1:11:07] to reach a soul to spend more time
[1:11:11] to to to to pray for somebody
[1:11:16] to to turn your cheek to not get
[1:11:19] mad at somebody when they did you wrong
[1:11:23] your flesh is always wanting that cup to
[1:11:26] pass from you
[1:11:29] it's the human nature that we have
[1:11:33] if we let it have its way then christ
[1:11:36] cannot be manifested
[1:11:38] we don't gain anything
[1:11:41] but in our carnality satan would teach
[1:11:44] us
[1:11:44] well you just prove to them that they're
[1:11:46] wrong and that they shouldn't have done
[1:11:48] that and that's all you need to do
[1:11:50] because it's the truth
[1:11:54] is that what jesus did when they pulled
[1:11:56] his beard
[1:11:57] and mocked him and no he did he opened
[1:12:00] out his mouth
[1:12:03] but the glory of god was being
[1:12:06] manifested
[1:12:12] there are benefits
[1:12:15] to letting your life be crucified
[1:12:19] it's not don't let it be scary
[1:12:23] right there in the garden in the midst
[1:12:25] of the greatest battle ever being fought
[1:12:27] there was a joy that was set before him
[1:12:30] it was the salvation of man's souls
[1:12:34] and that joy is what gave him strength
[1:12:37] and power
[1:12:38] to lay down his will that's the same
[1:12:40] thing that we got to do every day
[1:12:43] as soon as you're coming into a rough
[1:12:45] trial it's right there
[1:12:47] are you going to lay down your life are
[1:12:48] you going to crucify your flesh
[1:12:50] are you going to let them have it
[1:12:54] it was the love for the father's will
[1:12:57] in jesus heart that allowed him to say
[1:13:01] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[1:13:04] done
[1:13:04] it was the love for the father's will
[1:13:07] that's what we
[1:13:08] need to live a crucified life that is
[1:13:10] our victory when we can love
[1:13:12] the father's will to gain the father's
[1:13:15] will
[1:13:16] in our life then you can live that
[1:13:18] crucified life
[1:13:20] without feeling any kind of hurt or
[1:13:23] pain or scare or fear
[1:13:28] it's a love relationship
[1:13:32] it was love and joy that brought the
[1:13:35] power
[1:13:36] of calvary it will be no different for
[1:13:40] you and i
[1:13:42] it will be our love for the father's
[1:13:45] will that will give
[1:13:46] us power to lay down our life to
[1:13:49] self-crucify
[1:13:50] and to be willing to live a crucified
[1:13:54] life
[1:13:58] when i think that god refused
[1:14:02] to use my vessel
[1:14:05] when i would rather have my fleshly will
[1:14:07] and i just want you to think about this
[1:14:09] god does not cross our freemore agency
[1:14:13] this has such great respect for that
[1:14:16] but when i think about that god refuses
[1:14:19] to use me
[1:14:22] when my the will of my flesh
[1:14:26] is to do what i want rather than what he
[1:14:28] wants
[1:14:30] when i realize that i'm restraining
[1:14:33] god from using me when i can see clearly
[1:14:38] that is that is only going to use me
[1:14:43] if i surrender myself to him
[1:14:47] it's in that moment of realization it
[1:14:50] does something
[1:14:51] to my heart it makes me realize
[1:14:56] that i love him
[1:14:59] more
[1:15:03] and that love for him makes me want to
[1:15:06] die out to what i want to do
[1:15:09] and gain his will in my life
[1:15:13] now friends i'll say this we go through
[1:15:16] this
[1:15:17] dozens of times a day
[1:15:22] you know we might be thinking of some
[1:15:24] you know big things but if you just you
[1:15:26] know if the prophet said
[1:15:28] we backslide 100 times a day i want you
[1:15:31] to think how many
[1:15:32] opportunities that god wants to use us
[1:15:36] but our will is in the way
[1:15:40] so we've got to get excited
[1:15:43] about letting god using our life and as
[1:15:46] we get excited about god using our life
[1:15:48] then we're willing to lay down ours
[1:15:52] and living that self-crucified life
[1:15:55] is is is nothing to be scared of
[1:16:01] look god took us on when he did
[1:16:05] and look how many times he failed
[1:16:08] did god say no way i don't want to do it
[1:16:12] no he's still interested
[1:16:16] i believe that he's proud
[1:16:20] of the church that overcomes in laodicea
[1:16:23] the hardest age of all ages could go
[1:16:26] right back
[1:16:27] could just get just like they are in
[1:16:30] need of nothing
[1:16:31] i'm just going to do my own thing
[1:16:34] but we are blessed because god's given
[1:16:38] us eyes to see and we're overcoming
[1:16:41] the greatest enemy which is herself
[1:16:46] you know it's hard to die out to
[1:16:48] yourself
[1:16:50] the greater your pride is
[1:16:53] the greater you want to do your will
[1:16:55] right the greater you want to be first
[1:16:58] but first lord let me
[1:17:02] the greater that is the harder it is
[1:17:08] but the more you look what i can gain
[1:17:12] i can gain
[1:17:16] pleasing the lord i can gain
[1:17:20] doing his will
[1:17:25] he may want you just to chop wood that's
[1:17:28] really good amen
[1:17:31] but it don't matter well lord i want to
[1:17:34] go i want to go preach the 5 000.
[1:17:37] chop wood for that little woman
[1:17:41] that's the will of the lord
[1:17:44] you gain his will
[1:17:48] i don't i'm sorry it just naturally
[1:17:51] don't happen
[1:17:52] i don't naturally do the will of god
[1:17:56] it just doesn't come to me my flesh is
[1:17:59] just against god's will
[1:18:01] as it was before i ever met the lord
[1:18:06] that's why it has to be crucified that's
[1:18:09] why we got to learn to
[1:18:11] not enjoy
[1:18:14] heaven its way right when we want the
[1:18:17] lord to have his way
[1:18:19] in our life think about not what you're
[1:18:22] giving up
[1:18:23] but what you can gain
[1:18:29] outside of living a crucified life
[1:18:34] we have limited ourself from gaining all
[1:18:36] of god's will
[1:18:38] right but living a crucified life
[1:18:43] is living dead to your will
[1:18:49] it's living dead to your will it's
[1:18:52] living
[1:18:53] not my will thy will be done to live a
[1:18:56] crucified
[1:18:57] life it means you're living not my will
[1:19:00] thy will be done
[1:19:03] it's not automatic philippians chapter 2
[1:19:06] verse 5.
[1:19:07] now we've got to start hurrying
[1:19:10] let this mind be in you
[1:19:14] which was also in christ jesus not my
[1:19:17] will
[1:19:18] but thine be done who being in the form
[1:19:21] of god
[1:19:22] thought of not robbery to be equal with
[1:19:23] god but he made
[1:19:25] himself of no reputation
[1:19:29] and took upon him the form
[1:19:32] of a servant and was made in the
[1:19:35] likeness of banff
[1:19:37] he was so humble
[1:19:40] and being found in fashion as a man
[1:19:45] he humbled himself and became obedient
[1:19:49] unto death
[1:19:51] even the death of the cross now notice
[1:19:54] this starts out
[1:19:56] let this mind be in you which was in
[1:20:00] christ jesus now that
[1:20:02] mind humbles itself continually
[1:20:06] until it becomes completely
[1:20:11] completely sold out to god
[1:20:16] and it is certainly easier for any man
[1:20:20] to preach the gospel than it is to live
[1:20:23] the gospel
[1:20:32] romans chapter 8 verse 7.
[1:20:35] i'm going to talk about the other mind
[1:20:37] that we deal with
[1:20:39] because the carnal mind is enmity
[1:20:43] against god for it is not
[1:20:46] subject to the law of god neither indeed
[1:20:48] can be
[1:20:50] so then they that are in the flesh they
[1:20:53] cannot please god
[1:20:55] so now if i take my fist
[1:20:59] and i hit this person we
[1:21:02] know that i was in the flesh
[1:21:06] and that i did not please god
[1:21:10] but if i don't hit this man
[1:21:16] outwardly but inwardly
[1:21:21] nobody knows about it except me
[1:21:28] now you take that line and you just keep
[1:21:31] running it right back to what you're
[1:21:34] doing with your time
[1:21:39] they that are in the flesh they cannot
[1:21:41] please god
[1:21:44] being in the flesh is not just doing the
[1:21:46] most horrible things that you can think
[1:21:48] of
[1:21:48] and comparing yourself with those that
[1:21:50] do the most horrible things
[1:21:52] we've got to think about the mind of
[1:21:55] christ what did he do with his time
[1:21:58] right amen and was he
[1:22:01] looking to gain the will of the father
[1:22:04] or was he just looking to get by with as
[1:22:07] easy
[1:22:08] as he could so the carnal mind
[1:22:13] has wrote down a few things between the
[1:22:15] carnal mind versus
[1:22:16] the mind of christ the carnal mind
[1:22:19] is proud it wants to be
[1:22:23] served it's self-willed
[1:22:27] it it loves walking in the flesh
[1:22:32] it's
[1:22:35] it's living without crucifixion
[1:22:40] now the mind of christ as we just read
[1:22:43] in the scriptures
[1:22:44] is humble it serves
[1:22:47] it obeys god's will it walks in the
[1:22:50] spirit
[1:22:51] and it's living a crucified life
[1:22:54] right to the end right to the end
[1:22:57] it doesn't stop it doesn't say i've done
[1:23:00] this i've gone this far
[1:23:01] i've done this deed it keeps going
[1:23:06] galatians chapter 5 verse 6 this i say
[1:23:09] them
[1:23:09] walk in the spirit and ye shall not
[1:23:12] fulfill
[1:23:13] the lusts of the flesh
[1:23:17] surrendering our will to god is the
[1:23:19] greatest privilege a believer can
[1:23:20] experience
[1:23:23] it's what happens when you first got
[1:23:25] saved and the wonderful thing about it
[1:23:27] is you can you can experience that same
[1:23:29] experience
[1:23:31] as you surrender your will
[1:23:35] what did jesus say the father doth loved
[1:23:38] me
[1:23:39] because i lay down my life
[1:23:43] the father loves us when we live it
[1:23:48] a crucified life
[1:23:51] because now he says there is a vessel
[1:23:53] that i could work he did not the prophet
[1:23:54] say
[1:23:55] if i could just if god could just find
[1:23:57] one man
[1:23:59] one man get him in his hands he could
[1:24:02] turn the world
[1:24:03] upside down and that's what a crucified
[1:24:07] life does
[1:24:11] turn with me if you would to second
[1:24:12] corinthians chapter four
[1:24:15] second corinthians chapter four verse
[1:24:17] number seven we read the scripture and
[1:24:19] maybe even been last service
[1:24:23] and you know a lot of times when the
[1:24:24] lord
[1:24:27] this was not even in my thoughts of what
[1:24:30] we were this whole sermon
[1:24:31] was not even my thoughts or what we were
[1:24:33] going to preach it didn't transpire for
[1:24:36] a couple days but
[1:24:39] what i notice when you start looking at
[1:24:41] these sermons
[1:24:42] in sync in in
[1:24:45] order you can see a continuity
[1:24:49] in them and you don't even to me i don't
[1:24:52] even know what's happening as it's
[1:24:53] happening as it's unfolding
[1:24:55] but when you look back you can see it
[1:24:58] much easier
[1:25:00] but i think we read the scripture second
[1:25:03] corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 but we
[1:25:04] have this treasure
[1:25:06] in earthen vessels that the excellency
[1:25:09] of the power may be of god not of us
[1:25:12] we're troubled on every side
[1:25:14] yet we're not distressed we're perplexed
[1:25:16] but not in despair
[1:25:18] what a testimony to have persecuted but
[1:25:22] we're not forsaken
[1:25:23] cast down but not destroyed always
[1:25:26] bearing about in the body
[1:25:30] the dying of the lord jesus
[1:25:35] for a purpose look at the purpose look
[1:25:38] what we gain
[1:25:41] that the life also of jesus
[1:25:44] might be made manifest in our body
[1:25:47] but the devil tricks us and he gets us
[1:25:50] to think
[1:25:51] that we can still manifest christ in
[1:25:53] your life without dying out
[1:25:55] and that is not scriptural
[1:26:02] that's another gospel
[1:26:05] i know the more that i'm dead the more
[1:26:07] jesus is going to be seen
[1:26:11] and the more i'm worried about my
[1:26:13] reputation
[1:26:15] the less people are going to see jesus
[1:26:19] they may see a better john martin but
[1:26:21] who cares
[1:26:22] who cares
[1:26:25] 16 elements how much are we worth less
[1:26:28] than a buck
[1:26:30] it's that soul the character of that
[1:26:32] soul that's what's important
[1:26:37] all right verse 11 for we which live
[1:26:40] are always delivered
[1:26:44] unto death
[1:26:48] paul said i am crucified with christ
[1:26:54] now that was
[1:26:57] i'm living that life why
[1:27:02] that the life also of jesus might be
[1:27:06] made manifest in our mortal flesh now
[1:27:08] look at what we
[1:27:09] gain we gain christ in our life
[1:27:13] it goes beyond knowledge about what we
[1:27:16] beyond what we know
[1:27:17] it goes to a life lived for others
[1:27:21] brother brandon said eternal life is
[1:27:22] living for others it's manifesting
[1:27:24] christ
[1:27:25] to a world so verse 12 so then death
[1:27:28] it works in us but life
[1:27:32] in you and if i don't
[1:27:35] die i'm sorry you're not going to get
[1:27:38] life
[1:27:38] out of me
[1:27:42] we may get you know a friendship you may
[1:27:46] get my knowledge
[1:27:49] changing at life because i'm still in
[1:27:52] the way
[1:27:54] look at what we gain don't look about
[1:27:56] what we got to give up
[1:27:59] i am crucified with christ
[1:28:02] ending with this nevertheless i live yet
[1:28:05] not i
[1:28:06] but christ he's living in me
[1:28:09] and the life which i'm now living in the
[1:28:11] flesh i live by
[1:28:13] god by god
[1:28:17] not believing in jesus
[1:28:22] but by jesus in me believing
[1:28:27] there's a difference
[1:28:30] who loved me and he gave himself for me
[1:28:33] so why wouldn't we want
[1:28:35] to crucify ourselves and give ourselves
[1:28:38] back to god
[1:28:39] that his will could be accomplished it
[1:28:42] is no different
[1:28:43] than what jesus had to go through in the
[1:28:45] garden
[1:28:47] that great battle there of giving up
[1:28:49] your will that god's will could be done
[1:28:52] amen god bless you let's stand together
[1:28:59] praise the lord we did that under 60
[1:29:08] minutes
[1:29:12] praise the lord amen let's just
[1:29:16] go to him in prayer how many desires in
[1:29:19] your heart
[1:29:20] to find that place where
[1:29:24] dying out is not so scary

[1:42:03] deeper in the love of god
[1:42:06] well i want to say how blessed we are to
[1:42:09] have
[1:42:10] a wife
[1:42:19] in multiple ways
[1:42:24] but we i just i i fell in love with the
[1:42:27] worship service
[1:42:28] before the word today
[1:42:31] and uh
[1:42:34] being able to just express your love to
[1:42:37] god
[1:42:38] through worship i just it it's
[1:42:42] great it's great
[1:42:45] and uh we just appreciate what the music
[1:42:48] does to help us
[1:42:50] enter into that spirit because he
[1:42:52] inhabits the praises
[1:42:54] of his people and we just want to keep
[1:42:57] if if for some reason we don't have a
[1:42:59] muse
[1:42:59] musicians here we just want to double up
[1:43:02] behind
[1:43:03] brother ron and just worship with
[1:43:06] more of our heart and sing it louder and
[1:43:08] clap twice as loud and
[1:43:11] just put put put everything into it
[1:43:13] because it makes the difference
[1:43:16] it makes a difference amen yes
[1:43:20] it's something i hope it said to me
[1:43:23] she's been expressing over and over
[1:43:25] again the appreciation of me
[1:43:27] which is able to be here and she said
[1:43:29] one thing that's
[1:43:30] spoke to her so much was our worship
[1:43:33] amen
[1:43:34] we worship the lord she said she had
[1:43:35] never heard like that before
[1:43:38] and she's the strong presence of god
[1:43:41] comes over her every time she comes in
[1:43:43] praise god
[1:43:44] so i just wanted to share the testimony
[1:43:46] of that yes
[1:43:48] he inhabits the praises of his people
[1:43:51] and if we can believe
[1:43:54] we'll i believe we'll experience it
[1:43:56] we'll feel it we'll
[1:43:57] well no more it's not just one day um
[1:44:01] you know the sacrifice of just giving of
[1:44:04] yourself whether you have to go
[1:44:06] clean or you just go do something that
[1:44:09] you know denying that flesh that the
[1:44:11] woman is not wanting to go
[1:44:13] you know you're tired you don't feel
[1:44:15] good or whatever just ignoring that
[1:44:17] and going forth in the lord to do what
[1:44:19] he wants you to do
[1:44:21] brains about change in people's lives
[1:44:25] amen i just see it over and over again
[1:44:27] the more i say nobody
[1:44:29] yes to someone else the lord just
[1:44:32] becomes so evident
[1:44:33] and it's a domino effect because
[1:44:36] now hope is telling your brother who is
[1:44:39] wanting to come
[1:44:40] to service before you know it it's just
[1:44:42] going to keep on going
[1:44:44] yeah you know that's the way it's
[1:44:45] supposed to
[1:44:48] amen praise the lord thank you for
[1:44:50] sharing that
[1:44:51] yeah just second for the run it's like
[1:44:55] dominoes it's like when you said the
[1:44:59] first time
[1:45:28] these we see the holy ghost and they
[1:45:32] and they go out and they would nerve to
[1:45:35] attend to god and they bring their
[1:45:37] family into
[1:45:38] the soul and that and then god when he
[1:45:42] does
[1:45:57] that's right amen
[1:46:10] amen
[1:46:24] that's right what we gain what we can
[1:46:26] gain by dying out
[1:46:28] and when
[1:46:32] you know us as a congregation are out
[1:46:35] here that when
[1:46:38] you know
[1:46:52] and
[1:47:15] amen it's perfect perfect amen
[1:47:18] well praise the lord lord be with you
[1:47:21] till we meet again
[1:47:22] and we'll be dismissed in the word of
[1:47:24] prayer goodness our brother larry if you
