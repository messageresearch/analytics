[31:10] we have asked
[31:12] brother johnson to come and minister for
[31:14] us she may be seated just a moment
[31:17] yes
[31:18] um
[31:20] we're going to ask him to come i i'm
[31:22] thinking that he's
[31:24] sees me in the room or hears me but we
[31:26] want to welcome him yes
[31:30] when you read chapter 11 in the book of
[31:33] hebrews
[31:34] we hear about all the patriarchs
[31:37] of the old testament
[31:40] and i believe that brother johnson is a
[31:42] patriot of the new testament
[31:46] of this century that we're in
[31:48] and
[31:50] none of us
[31:52] have
[31:54] uh
[31:56] the full scope
[31:58] of what this patriarch has done for the
[32:00] kingdom of god
[32:02] but i say
[32:03] with all my heart that we are privileged
[32:06] to have him amongst us
[32:09] and um
[32:11] like all of us we're human
[32:14] but
[32:15] is god in us the hope of glory
[32:20] and i'm just so grateful
[32:22] to have
[32:23] come under brother johnson's ministry
[32:26] and to learn the importance of having a
[32:30] right spirit over the right doctor
[32:33] because it was lived
[32:35] in our brother
[32:36] and um
[32:38] we just want him to take his his liberty
[32:40] and i want to i want to learn i want to
[32:42] grow i want to become
[32:45] another
[32:46] uh
[32:47] another
[32:48] higher up in in the lord you know what
[32:51] i'm trying to say so
[32:52] um how many is going to pull the word
[32:56] amen i believe the word is hid in his
[32:58] heart
[32:59] and if we just help pull the word out i
[33:02] believe it'll feed our soul and give us

[34:54] in the word of prayer
[34:56] heavenly father
[34:59] we feel so grateful
[35:01] for the privilege to be here
[35:04] with this congregation tonight
[35:07] and stand in this position
[35:10] but lord
[35:11] i can't feed them
[35:14] you must do that
[35:16] i give myself to you
[35:19] let the word of the lord come forth
[35:23] lord fully and completely
[35:26] and
[35:27] may you come and anoint the word
[35:30] so we'll understand the word
[35:33] in the precious
[35:35] and wonderful name of jesus
[35:38] amen
[35:41] now
[35:42] i don't know uh is everyone hearing me
[35:45] okay
[35:47] maybe i should say is there anyone that
[35:50] can't hear me
[35:52] properly
[35:55] all right
[35:57] that's good i won't need to have that
[35:59] then
[36:00] praise the lord
[36:02] all right
[36:04] you may be seated
[36:08] let's turn in our bible
[36:16] hallelujah
[36:18] amen
[36:30] all right
[36:34] let's turn to the 12th chapter
[36:37] of the book of exodus
[36:45] i did want to say that
[36:48] brother martin has been fair kind
[36:51] and he's always
[36:54] just
[36:55] giving out roses
[36:58] and
[37:00] and it's been so nice
[37:02] to have brother bruce
[37:04] be a chauffeur for me
[37:07] uh he came and
[37:09] offered that
[37:11] what a blessing special nights like
[37:13] tonight
[37:15] and uh they're gonna be working on the
[37:18] road
[37:19] but uh
[37:21] uh
[37:22] and i was so happy to see brother larry
[37:26] again he's been
[37:28] showing up pretty often
[37:31] we really miss him
[37:33] when he's not here
[37:35] uh
[37:36] brother larry has quite a testimony
[37:40] of how one little track
[37:43] he had the address to the church
[37:46] in an arbor
[37:47] and he read it but he
[37:51] he held on to it for 40 years
[37:54] before
[37:55] looking up the church
[37:59] but that encouraged me
[38:02] for we have sent millions of tracks out
[38:06] by the help of the brothers
[38:09] in ann arbor
[38:11] and uh
[38:12] so
[38:14] that just encourages me
[38:16] uh
[38:17] the word will not return voice
[38:22] it will accomplish that
[38:25] to which
[38:26] it is sent
[38:28] so just remember that
[38:30] amen
[38:32] and uh
[38:35] it's good
[38:36] when you're going to the store to town
[38:40] just to pray
[38:42] a little prayer lord
[38:44] let me be able to testify
[38:48] to someone amen because you just don't
[38:51] want to try to stop everybody on the
[38:54] isle
[38:54] but yet
[38:56] it's such a blessing
[38:59] to get to tell someone about the lord
[39:03] and
[39:05] it won't return void
[39:07] and we'll be happy when we get over
[39:10] there
[39:11] amen
[39:13] we'll be happy
[39:14] all right i'm going to turn
[39:17] in the bible now and
[39:19] and read
[39:21] uh
[39:22] from the book of exodus
[39:26] chapter 12.
[39:29] i had it marked but
[39:31] that's okay
[39:33] the word of god hadn't changed
[39:37] and it'll still be in chapter
[39:40] 12. although this was probably
[39:45] this was probably recorded
[39:49] uh
[39:50] well it was spoken by moses
[39:53] way
[39:54] back before israel
[39:58] came out
[40:00] all right
[40:02] amen
[40:04] so
[40:05] if
[40:06] if anyone
[40:08] cannot hear me you have my liberty to
[40:12] just
[40:13] put that a little closer
[40:15] amen
[40:21] all right we got one saying he thinks
[40:24] it'd be good
[40:26] so
[40:28] uh
[40:31] oh that's
[40:33] that's even better
[40:36] hey man
[40:41] the lord said he would supply every need
[40:45] amen
[40:47] and so he's doing that all right
[40:51] now you can hear me better way back in
[40:54] the back
[40:55] amen
[40:57] and the lord spake
[40:59] unto moses
[41:01] and aaron
[41:02] in the land of egypt saying
[41:06] this month
[41:08] shall be unto you the beginning of
[41:10] months
[41:12] it shall be the first month
[41:14] of the year to you
[41:17] speaking unto all the congregation of
[41:20] israel saying
[41:23] in the tenth day of this month
[41:26] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[41:31] according to the house of their fathers
[41:35] a lamb foreign house
[41:38] and if the high soul
[41:39] be too little for the lamb
[41:43] let him and his neighbor
[41:46] next unto his house
[41:48] take it according to the number of the
[41:52] souls
[41:54] every man
[41:55] according to his leading
[41:58] shall
[41:59] make your count for the lamb
[42:03] your lamb shall be without blemish
[42:06] do you know why
[42:08] sure you do
[42:10] because it was a type of the lamb of god
[42:14] that took away the sins of the world
[42:18] it had to be a male of the first year
[42:22] you shall take it
[42:23] out from the sheep
[42:26] or from the goats
[42:29] and you shall keep it
[42:31] until the 14th day
[42:34] of the same month
[42:36] and the whole assembly
[42:39] of the congregation of israel
[42:42] shall kill it
[42:43] in the evening
[42:45] you may be seated
[42:47] and
[42:48] i just don't want to keep you standing
[42:51] too long
[42:53] but i love
[42:55] i love this story hey man
[42:59] it's such a story
[43:02] and uh
[43:03] notice
[43:04] it was to be
[43:07] the this month he said shall be unto you
[43:10] the beginning of months
[43:13] now
[43:15] the reason i believe
[43:17] to them it was the beginning of months
[43:21] remember
[43:23] god had already told abraham
[43:27] that israel would be under bondage
[43:30] for 400 years
[43:33] is that right
[43:35] but actually they were there
[43:38] for 403
[43:40] you know the the critics sure do like
[43:44] to make out like god didn't know what he
[43:47] was
[43:48] what he was
[43:49] saying or he missed it
[43:52] no he didn't miss it
[43:54] joseph
[43:56] had saved their lives and the lives of
[44:00] all of his loved ones
[44:02] jacob's family
[44:05] so
[44:06] it was gonna be a a new a new month
[44:11] a new life
[44:13] a new liberty
[44:14] a new victory
[44:17] and a new walk
[44:19] a walk they had never made before
[44:24] amen
[44:25] so
[44:26] ah
[44:27] it's the first month i like that
[44:31] and he said
[44:32] you just speak to the
[44:34] congregation
[44:37] to take the lamb out of the flock
[44:41] from out of the goats or out of the
[44:44] sheep
[44:46] of course the lamb would have to come
[44:49] from the
[44:50] sheep
[44:52] amen but they were usually
[44:56] in
[44:56] one great
[44:58] area
[44:59] and
[45:00] was watched over by the family and so it
[45:05] was on the 14th day
[45:08] of the month
[45:10] that this lamb
[45:12] was to be slain
[45:15] why 40 days because it was to be
[45:19] the 10th day
[45:21] they were to pick out that lamb
[45:24] but the 14th day
[45:26] because it had to be inspected
[45:30] they had to be sure there was no blemish
[45:35] nothing wrong with it
[45:37] if it had a
[45:39] broken leg
[45:41] it wasn't
[45:43] it wouldn't be
[45:44] ready because
[45:46] remember
[45:48] in jesus body not one bone was to be
[45:52] broken amen
[45:54] and even this lamb
[45:56] they were not to break one bone in its
[46:00] body
[46:02] because it's a perfect type
[46:05] of the lamb of god
[46:07] that taketh away
[46:09] the sins of the lamb
[46:11] of the lord
[46:13] he said your lamb shall be without
[46:15] blemish a male of the first year
[46:18] if you'll notice
[46:20] uh
[46:22] probably you've seen pictures of little
[46:26] little lambs
[46:28] little goats
[46:30] little horses
[46:32] that are bored
[46:34] and when they first are born
[46:37] they sure seem
[46:39] very
[46:40] unstable
[46:42] they just
[46:43] you know
[46:45] but as soon as
[46:46] their mother
[46:48] can have time
[46:50] to start licking with the tub
[46:54] amen cleaned it up
[46:58] and so
[46:59] that little fella though if you see him
[47:02] about
[47:03] six months later
[47:05] i'll tell you what
[47:07] you'll be running circles around the
[47:09] mama
[47:11] all around
[47:13] showing his
[47:14] his
[47:16] his
[47:17] love of liberty
[47:19] the love of being able to do something
[47:22] he had never been able to do before
[47:26] amen
[47:27] i believe god makes them that way amen
[47:30] amen
[47:32] and they shall take of the blood
[47:35] it says that they shadowed the 14th day
[47:39] and they shall strike it on the two
[47:42] side posts
[47:44] and on the upper
[47:45] door post
[47:48] of the houses
[47:50] where they shall eat it
[47:53] notice
[47:54] they they had to eat the lamb
[47:57] in the house
[47:59] where the blood was supplied
[48:02] amen
[48:05] when you
[48:06] when you partake of the bread
[48:09] and the wine
[48:11] or the supper of the lord
[48:14] or
[48:15] the breaking of bread whatever you call
[48:18] it
[48:19] amen
[48:21] it's it has to be
[48:24] eaten in a clean house
[48:28] the houses are qualified till the blood
[48:32] is supplied
[48:34] now the israelites didn't want it
[48:39] they
[48:40] they knew that israel was putting blood
[48:43] on their doorposts
[48:45] they never asked for it
[48:47] except there might have been a few
[48:50] that are called mixed
[48:53] multitude
[48:55] oh god help us
[48:57] never to be mixed up
[49:01] neither
[49:02] in or out
[49:04] you know all the way just
[49:07] you know kind of in between help us lord
[49:11] brother john's been giving us some good
[49:13] lessons
[49:14] and a lot of scriptures
[49:16] of how the lord wants us to grow
[49:19] in grace
[49:21] and in knowledge of the son of god
[49:24] real good advice
[49:26] and that's why we're here
[49:29] that's why we come
[49:31] amen to be fed to the word of god amen
[49:36] and god
[49:37] is trying to help us
[49:40] let's let's listen carefully
[49:43] if something
[49:44] you know something is spoken that you
[49:47] don't understand
[49:48] write a question
[49:50] and talk to brother
[49:52] the preacher
[49:54] uh brother john or if there's someone
[49:57] else
[49:58] uh this feasting
[50:00] if i say anything to you that mixes you
[50:04] up tonight
[50:06] i would i'd be happy for you to
[50:09] to ask me
[50:11] before i leave you
[50:13] now
[50:13] i'm just going to take my time and
[50:16] that's the reason i wanted you to sit
[50:18] down because
[50:19] you'll be able
[50:21] hopefully
[50:23] to grasp and i didn't feel quite right
[50:27] to be setting out and you stand it out
[50:32] amen
[50:33] in fact
[50:35] i didn't like preaching set down
[50:38] and i still don't have quite the liberty
[50:42] of the voice
[50:44] but i found where jesus told peter
[50:47] bring your boat
[50:50] and when he brought the boat pete jesus
[50:53] got in the boat
[50:56] he went out a little ways in the shore
[51:01] he spoke to thousands of people
[51:04] there
[51:06] because he didn't need a microphone
[51:10] because water is a reflector
[51:14] of the voice
[51:16] and so
[51:17] the lord knew that because he made it
[51:20] that way
[51:22] he knew that someday
[51:24] he'd be preaching on the water
[51:27] hallelujah
[51:30] amen
[51:32] and
[51:32] if you hadn't been to the water you know
[51:37] all you need to do is just take care
[51:39] that you ask him
[51:41] to take your sins away
[51:44] amen and meet it from your heart
[51:47] and show that you meet it by being
[51:50] faithful in prayer
[51:52] and that's one thing all of us
[51:55] all of us need to do more
[51:59] the lord's been talking to me about it
[52:02] i hope i can just spend more time
[52:06] in prayer
[52:07] all right listen
[52:10] eat he said now
[52:13] they shall eat the flesh in the night
[52:17] roast with fire
[52:19] unleavened bread
[52:22] with bitter herbs
[52:25] they shall eat it
[52:28] amen
[52:30] would you come to eat the word
[52:35] leaven is a type of false doctrine
[52:40] if you remember when jesus said to the
[52:44] disciples beware of the leaven of the
[52:48] pharisees
[52:50] he was referring to their doctrine
[52:54] be worse
[52:56] amen
[52:58] so it's a type
[53:00] of
[53:01] of
[53:02] a
[53:04] misunderstood word
[53:06] or a type of disobedience
[53:10] to the word
[53:11] that we know is written in the
[53:14] scriptures
[53:15] you know
[53:18] many years ago
[53:19] when my first son was born
[53:23] and you know
[53:25] after a while they grow up
[53:27] and they have to go to school
[53:30] and so he had been going to school
[53:33] a week till he come
[53:35] he would come home for lunch
[53:37] he had to run almost a mile not quite
[53:41] maybe and uh
[53:44] so
[53:45] anyway
[53:46] he came in just patting and blowing and
[53:50] said hey
[53:52] what's happening
[53:53] oh he said two boys threatened to beat
[53:57] me up
[53:59] he said i just outrun him
[54:03] amen
[54:04] i said we're not gonna talk about it
[54:07] before you eat
[54:09] we're going to eat first
[54:11] then we're going to go
[54:13] talk to the lord about it
[54:16] so
[54:17] we eaten
[54:19] and
[54:20] i finally said let's go and
[54:22] have a little prayer in the living room
[54:25] and a scripture
[54:27] while i'm praying came to me
[54:31] i don't know how long it had been
[54:33] i don't remember ever preaching on that
[54:37] scripture
[54:38] but it's a good scripture
[54:41] if all of thy ways
[54:44] please the lord
[54:46] he'll make even thy enemies
[54:50] to be at peace with you
[54:54] boy i love
[54:55] i love the answer
[54:58] and so i told john what the answer was i
[55:01] said john maybe you haven't been too
[55:04] friendly
[55:06] maybe you need to
[55:08] kind of lighten up a little bit
[55:11] be a little nicer i said tell you what
[55:14] if somebody
[55:18] needs a pencil even one of those boys
[55:22] give him one of yours
[55:24] if he needs one piece of paper give him
[55:27] two
[55:29] amen
[55:30] and so
[55:31] and so i didn't hear anything
[55:34] about two weeks passed i said uh
[55:38] sean
[55:39] what about the the two boys
[55:42] boys said one of them's my best friend
[55:47] i said what happened
[55:49] he said well he needed
[55:51] a piece of paper and i give him two
[55:56] and he said now he's my best friend
[56:00] see he
[56:03] i didn't
[56:04] i didn't know the little fella would
[56:06] need some paper but the lord knew
[56:10] amen
[56:11] the lord knows ahead of time
[56:14] exactly what's going to happen
[56:17] but i've thought about that and you know
[56:23] sometimes
[56:25] some
[56:26] some people don't want
[56:28] your friendship
[56:31] but you can
[56:32] you can act nice
[56:36] don't don't become stuck up
[56:39] you're not the first one
[56:41] that somebody's turned their nose up
[56:45] amen
[56:47] but
[56:48] i've always been told
[56:50] if you turn your nose up and it rains
[56:54] you might get
[56:55] too much water
[56:58] amen
[57:00] all right i'm going to try to hurry
[57:02] he said now
[57:05] he said
[57:07] he did not raw
[57:10] nor satan at all with water
[57:14] brother john mead taught me that
[57:17] he said
[57:18] you know when you
[57:19] you take meat home
[57:22] after you hunt
[57:23] don't don't put a lot of water on it
[57:27] and that's
[57:28] he said but roasting with fire
[57:31] his head
[57:33] with his legs
[57:35] and with the pertinents
[57:37] thereof
[57:39] when i come to the word perturbance i
[57:41] thought i knew
[57:43] what it meant and so i have a little
[57:45] bible at home that
[57:48] that brother
[57:50] mother colin fisher gave me
[57:53] it's a jerusalem bible
[57:56] so i said i wonder
[57:58] you know what they
[58:00] so
[58:01] they they used the word intrus
[58:06] well
[58:07] we understand that for sure
[58:10] but that's what i thought it was i had
[58:13] never looked it up
[58:15] but uh
[58:16] anyway
[58:18] if you see a word you don't understand
[58:21] write it down check it out
[58:24] amen
[58:26] uh
[58:27] quite often i think of something
[58:30] i appreciate it brother
[58:33] brother martin's message separating
[58:37] in the bible the word love
[58:40] comes from two words in the greek
[58:44] and
[58:46] both of them are loved but they're not
[58:48] the same kind of love
[58:51] he tried to show us the difference

[59:07] that's trying to serve god
[59:10] and trying
[59:11] my best to love my enemies

[59:21] you can tell
[59:22] when you really truly love
[59:27] someone that's really

[59:32] and that's what you pray for
[59:36] when you pray for
[59:38] lay not the sin
[59:40] to their charge
[59:42] i want to just tell
[59:44] one little thing that happened to me
[59:47] many years ago it's a testimony i
[59:50] haven't mentioned it quite a while
[59:53] but one night
[59:56] you know i had
[59:58] moved to california and pastored there
[1:00:01] for two and a half years
[1:00:04] and uh
[1:00:05] so
[1:00:06] when i came back
[1:00:09] it was actually
[1:00:11] i came back in 63.
[1:00:14] this was in
[1:00:15] january of 65
[1:00:19] so
[1:00:20] i hadn't heard from them
[1:00:23] i
[1:00:24] really
[1:00:25] had written too many letters to them i
[1:00:29] did get one letter
[1:00:31] from one little sister that got so
[1:00:35] mad at me
[1:00:38] and she come up for prayer there was
[1:00:41] about five
[1:00:42] people that come up
[1:00:44] and the whole
[1:00:46] it seemed like something said don't lay
[1:00:49] hands on her
[1:00:52] and
[1:00:53] so i took a little
[1:00:55] walk around on the platform
[1:00:58] i
[1:00:59] i wanted to hear that a little a little
[1:01:01] plater
[1:01:04] he said don't
[1:01:06] lay hand shoulder
[1:01:09] so
[1:01:12] i said lord
[1:01:14] please help me
[1:01:16] you help me to know
[1:01:18] what i can say to her
[1:01:21] because she's gonna
[1:01:23] be upset
[1:01:25] she was one of our best friends
[1:01:28] and
[1:01:29] so
[1:01:31] uh
[1:01:32] i said sister you want to be here
[1:01:35] yes that's why i'm here
[1:01:38] i said go pay your vows
[1:01:42] and it'll be all right
[1:01:46] oh the way she walked back to her seat
[1:01:50] i i knew she wasn't happy you know
[1:01:54] people
[1:01:55] do have a way of letting you know when
[1:01:58] they aren't happy
[1:02:01] and
[1:02:02] so
[1:02:04] anyway
[1:02:06] i went in talked to the lord because i
[1:02:09] knew there'd be a phone call coming
[1:02:12] and
[1:02:13] so i told her exactly what the lord told
[1:02:16] me
[1:02:18] after he told me i even remember
[1:02:21] hearing her pray one time
[1:02:24] and i heard her pray help me doctor
[1:02:28] gossip anymore
[1:02:30] and i thought that's a good prayer amen
[1:02:33] you know
[1:02:34] we all could use that
[1:02:36] amen
[1:02:38] and so
[1:02:40] anyway
[1:02:41] i prayed for her
[1:02:43] and
[1:02:44] about a week pass maybe two weeks
[1:02:48] i got a phone call
[1:02:51] and it was
[1:02:52] my little widdle
[1:02:55] sister
[1:02:57] who
[1:02:58] was a widow
[1:03:01] and she was in her 60s i would think
[1:03:05] and so

[1:03:28] the sun was shining
[1:03:31] it was such a lovely temperature
[1:03:34] in
[1:03:35] l.a
[1:03:36] and said
[1:03:38] she had never felt better in her life
[1:03:41] and all of a sudden she just
[1:03:45] lost all strength and fell to the ground
[1:03:50] and the first one she thought about
[1:03:53] was me
[1:03:54] she should have been thinking about
[1:03:56] jesus
[1:03:59] but she called me right away
[1:04:02] and we had a prayer meeting
[1:04:05] and uh
[1:04:07] after i got back here
[1:04:09] i got a letter from her saying
[1:04:12] i'm so glad you did what you did because

[1:05:13] always trying to walk without me
[1:05:17] if i lean it on something it'll fall

[1:05:57] time
[1:06:00] try to
[1:06:02] you know mark those scriptures
[1:06:05] because they'll help you
[1:06:08] but i in other words
[1:06:10] they had to be ready
[1:06:12] for a journey
[1:06:14] to a promised land
[1:06:17] and that's what we have to do
[1:06:20] we've got to stay ready we don't know
[1:06:23] what day
[1:06:24] what hour
[1:06:26] we don't
[1:06:28] uh
[1:06:30] one time i mentioned
[1:06:33] brother branham had
[1:06:34] said something about 77
[1:06:39] and uh i thought man
[1:06:42] that would be something if god would
[1:06:44] tell him
[1:06:46] but
[1:06:47] i
[1:06:48] i spoke it one time
[1:06:51] the holy spirit said don't put no date
[1:06:55] on it
[1:06:57] and i thanked him
[1:07:00] a lot of churches lost about half of
[1:07:02] their congregation
[1:07:04] when he didn't come in 77
[1:07:08] so i told the lord
[1:07:09] i'm not putting no date
[1:07:12] brother branham i thought he'd give us a
[1:07:15] good
[1:07:16] little uh lesson
[1:07:18] when he said
[1:07:20] live for him like he's coming today
[1:07:25] work for him like you got 40 more years
[1:07:29] amen
[1:07:31] you know
[1:07:32] that's good advice
[1:07:34] real good
[1:07:36] all right
[1:07:37] so be ready to travel
[1:07:40] because
[1:07:42] actually that very night
[1:07:46] they
[1:07:47] they left out of the land
[1:07:51] that very night of the passover
[1:07:54] in fact
[1:07:56] the egyptians begged them to go
[1:08:01] get out of here even pharaoh said hey
[1:08:05] take your cattle take
[1:08:07] take everything you need
[1:08:10] to make your sacrifices but get out of
[1:08:14] here
[1:08:15] but god knew
[1:08:17] that he would change his mind
[1:08:20] but
[1:08:21] it never stopped the children of israel
[1:08:26] but for five seconds maybe
[1:08:29] just long enough for moses to say
[1:08:33] stand you still
[1:08:36] and see the salvation of the lord amen
[1:08:40] when you can't move it's always safe to
[1:08:44] stand still
[1:08:46] amen
[1:08:47] then have a little prayer meeting
[1:08:51] they had looked
[1:08:53] the pillar of fire moved from before
[1:08:56] them
[1:08:59] and stood between them behind israel
[1:09:04] so that
[1:09:07] they
[1:09:08] they could not see the egyptians
[1:09:11] neither could the egyptians
[1:09:13] but
[1:09:14] it was where israel could still see the
[1:09:18] light how to walk
[1:09:20] amen
[1:09:22] they were able to walk in the light
[1:09:25] but not for the egyptians
[1:09:28] oh i tell you
[1:09:29] god just he knows how to help the
[1:09:32] believer for he said i passed through
[1:09:34] the land of egypt this night i'll spite
[1:09:38] all the firstborn in the land of egypt
[1:09:41] both man
[1:09:42] and beast have you noticed that the
[1:09:46] beasts also
[1:09:48] he said and against all the gods
[1:09:52] of egypt
[1:09:54] hallelujah you know god
[1:09:57] god knows how to
[1:09:59] take care of them gods amen one time
[1:10:02] they brought one into the philistines
[1:10:04] god
[1:10:06] and set him in front of their god
[1:10:09] and their god
[1:10:13] lost his
[1:10:15] fell on the floor
[1:10:18] so they
[1:10:19] stuck him together
[1:10:20] put him back in there and the next time
[1:10:23] he broke
[1:10:25] they didn't try that again
[1:10:28] hey amen
[1:10:30] all right and the blood shall be to you
[1:10:34] for a token
[1:10:36] upon the houses
[1:10:38] where ye are
[1:10:40] and when i see the blood
[1:10:43] i will pass over
[1:10:45] you
[1:10:46] and the pledge shall not be upon you to
[1:10:50] destroy you
[1:10:51] when i smite the land of egypt
[1:10:56] when i see the blood
[1:10:59] oh hallelujah
[1:11:02] and that's what he has to give every one
[1:11:05] of us
[1:11:06] amen
[1:11:08] and this day shall be unto you a
[1:11:11] memorial
[1:11:12] and you shall keep it a feast
[1:11:15] to the lord throughout your generations
[1:11:19] and you shall keep it a feast
[1:11:22] by an ordinance
[1:11:24] forever amen amen
[1:11:28] now
[1:11:29] i want to mention that
[1:11:33] we learned
[1:11:35] by the prophet
[1:11:37] there's three ordinances
[1:11:40] that brother branham said
[1:11:43] and
[1:11:46] one of them
[1:11:48] is to break the bread
[1:11:51] break the
[1:11:52] bread one of
[1:11:55] his foot washing
[1:11:59] and the other one was marriage
[1:12:02] is that right marriage
[1:12:05] amen some of you are looking at me
[1:12:08] like you're not sure
[1:12:10] well you look it up
[1:12:12] correct me because i take correction
[1:12:16] i learned long ago if i say anything
[1:12:19] contrary to the prophet just go ahead
[1:12:22] and say it right
[1:12:25] i don't have to repent
[1:12:29] amen if i don't know what to say
[1:12:32] i just won't say nothing
[1:12:35] but
[1:12:36] the reason this
[1:12:38] means so much to me this subject
[1:12:41] is
[1:12:43] the passover was just the beginning
[1:12:47] and the ending
[1:12:49] was in the new testament and jesus eat
[1:12:52] it with his disciples
[1:12:55] just before he was crucified
[1:12:59] amen
[1:13:00] so
[1:13:01] it was
[1:13:03] it was the start
[1:13:05] and it wasn't the finish
[1:13:08] now
[1:13:09] when i was a little fella
[1:13:11] uh
[1:13:12] my dad thought that he had
[1:13:15] maybe
[1:13:17] found scriptures
[1:13:19] that
[1:13:20] he didn't he didn't think he needed to
[1:13:23] take
[1:13:24] the literal bread
[1:13:26] and the wine
[1:13:27] well number one we couldn't buy wine
[1:13:31] in there
[1:13:32] in the town that we lived in not even in
[1:13:36] the county
[1:13:37] so
[1:13:39] anyway
[1:13:40] anyway
[1:13:41] one day i told my wife
[1:13:44] i said
[1:13:46] brother brenham
[1:13:48] taught
[1:13:50] serpent seat he was right
[1:13:54] i was wrong
[1:13:55] i didn't understand it
[1:13:58] he taught evidence of the holy ghost
[1:14:01] he was right
[1:14:04] he taught
[1:14:06] the
[1:14:07] the
[1:14:11] everything that the new testament church
[1:14:14] had
[1:14:16] is available for the believers today
[1:14:20] everything amen without any faith
[1:14:24] so i said
[1:14:27] i'm going to go
[1:14:29] and
[1:14:31] head for the woods
[1:14:33] you can pray in the woods
[1:14:35] and
[1:14:36] you might hear the squirrel spark at you
[1:14:40] but
[1:14:41] it seems like heaven says amen
[1:14:44] amen
[1:14:46] isn't it good to get an answer
[1:14:49] just keep praying amen if you haven't
[1:14:52] got the answer that's okay
[1:14:54] just keep praying
[1:14:57] amen
[1:14:58] so i headed for the
[1:15:00] for the wilderness
[1:15:02] uh we had rented a campground for our
[1:15:05] first camp meeting
[1:15:07] before we went to christ lake and so
[1:15:12] anyway
[1:15:14] they gave me a bed
[1:15:16] just
[1:15:17] i told her what i was going to do
[1:15:19] and
[1:15:20] they said
[1:15:21] just go right ahead it won't cost you
[1:15:25] anything
[1:15:26] so
[1:15:27] i went there for two days but the third
[1:15:30] day
[1:15:31] they were coming in to clean the whole
[1:15:34] place
[1:15:35] and the rooms
[1:15:37] and i didn't
[1:15:39] i didn't want to be
[1:15:40] [Music]
[1:15:41] in a lot of traffic
[1:15:44] among a lot of people
[1:15:46] so
[1:15:47] i just
[1:15:49] got in my car and drove over to sac
[1:15:52] rider hill does everybody know where
[1:15:55] secretary hill is
[1:15:58] you know where grassland is
[1:16:01] well
[1:16:02] if you turn south instead of toward
[1:16:04] christ's lake within a mile
[1:16:08] there'll be a park in space
[1:16:10] there
[1:16:11] and there'll be an old path
[1:16:14] going up to an old rugged cross
[1:16:18] and it's big
[1:16:21] and it's tall
[1:16:23] so
[1:16:24] i thought that'd be a good place
[1:16:27] i've never found anybody up there
[1:16:31] when i
[1:16:32] went but
[1:16:34] i know there's
[1:16:36] other people to visit it
[1:16:38] so i took an old blanket
[1:16:41] threw it on the grass that was about
[1:16:43] this tall
[1:16:45] just knelt
[1:16:47] toward the cross
[1:16:50] and as soon as i knelt
[1:16:52] i felt a little breeze
[1:16:56] you know what i'd wondered how brother
[1:16:58] brother knew but i'll tell you when it's
[1:17:01] him
[1:17:02] you'll know
[1:17:05] you'll know
[1:17:07] and as soon as that breeze
[1:17:10] came in and i began to weep
[1:17:13] and while i'm winking i heard a voice
[1:17:17] inside
[1:17:19] what does that remind you of
[1:17:23] i said oh lord
[1:17:25] it reminds me
[1:17:27] of your death on calvary
[1:17:30] for my sins
[1:17:32] and the sins of the whole world
[1:17:36] amen
[1:17:38] and i said lord that piece of wood can't
[1:17:40] save me
[1:17:42] and that's true that piece of wood there
[1:17:46] couldn't save me
[1:17:48] but it sure happened
[1:17:51] and so
[1:17:52] and so
[1:17:55] the lord
[1:17:57] you know
[1:17:58] i just said lord
[1:18:01] i
[1:18:02] i have taught the people
[1:18:04] your word takes the
[1:18:07] preference over everything
[1:18:10] show it to me in the book
[1:18:14] and we'll cover that
[1:18:16] we'll cover that cause i gotta hurry i'm
[1:18:19] not gonna
[1:18:21] i don't wanna
[1:18:23] i
[1:18:24] all right
[1:18:26] i'm going to turn you over to
[1:18:29] the 12th chapter verse 32.
[1:18:32] also take your flocks and your herbs
[1:18:36] as ye have said
[1:18:38] and be gone
[1:18:40] and bless me
[1:18:42] also
[1:18:43] he
[1:18:44] that was when pharaoh called moses
[1:18:49] can you imagine pharaoh finally won a
[1:18:52] blessing
[1:18:53] from moses
[1:18:55] he had run him off
[1:18:58] a
[1:18:58] they threatened to kill him but he
[1:19:00] decided to
[1:19:02] find his way to another country
[1:19:05] and there
[1:19:07] he found his bride
[1:19:10] amen
[1:19:12] a gentile bride
[1:19:14] that's amazing in it
[1:19:17] amen
[1:19:18] he said
[1:19:21] the egyptians were urged upon the people
[1:19:25] that they might send them out of the
[1:19:27] land in haste
[1:19:29] for they said
[1:19:31] we be all dead men
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:38] hallelujah
[1:19:40] they became believers
[1:19:42] i'm going to skip all the way to 46
[1:19:46] in chapter 12 of exodus
[1:19:49] in one house
[1:19:51] shall it be eaten
[1:19:54] thou shalt not carry forth ought of the
[1:19:58] flesh abroad
[1:20:00] out of the house
[1:20:03] neither shall you break a bone
[1:20:07] thereof amen
[1:20:09] that's a prophecy
[1:20:10] because of the messiah amen
[1:20:13] amen our bone was to be broken
[1:20:18] amen
[1:20:20] hallelujah
[1:20:21] well now

[1:20:37] so
[1:20:39] if somebody's putting it on the board
[1:20:42] some of you might not have your bible
[1:20:45] but
[1:20:46] i'm taking you to first corinthians
[1:20:50] amen
[1:20:53] paul's first letter as far as we know
[1:20:58] hallelujah
[1:21:03] does everybody find it
[1:21:06] i've got a marker
[1:21:08] but you don't have to find it
[1:21:11] except
[1:21:13] i want you to be able
[1:21:15] in the
[1:21:17] in the 10th chapter
[1:21:20] first i want to read that
[1:21:22] this is
[1:21:24] this is a little help to understand the
[1:21:27] spiritual way
[1:21:29] that we partake of the lord
[1:21:32] in the spirit
[1:21:34] moreover brethren
[1:21:35] i would not that she should be ignorant
[1:21:39] how that all of our fathers were under
[1:21:42] the cloud and all pass
[1:21:45] through the sea
[1:21:47] and were all baptized unto moses
[1:21:51] in the cloud
[1:21:53] and in the sea
[1:21:55] and did
[1:21:56] all eat the same
[1:21:59] spiritual meat
[1:22:01] and did all drink the same
[1:22:04] spiritual drink
[1:22:06] for they drank of that spiritual rock
[1:22:10] that followed them and that rock was
[1:22:14] christ
[1:22:16] and i'm wonderful
[1:22:18] but with many of them
[1:22:21] god was not well pleased
[1:22:24] for they were overthrown in the
[1:22:27] wilderness
[1:22:28] now these things were our examples
[1:22:32] to the intent
[1:22:35] that we should not lust after evil
[1:22:39] things
[1:22:40] as they
[1:22:42] also lustered
[1:22:44] neither be your idolaters
[1:22:47] as were some of them as it is written
[1:22:50] the people sat down to eat and shriek
[1:22:55] and rose up to play
[1:22:58] you remember that's when
[1:23:00] aaron had took the gold
[1:23:04] and
[1:23:06] and they made a golden calf
[1:23:09] neither let
[1:23:11] us commit fornication
[1:23:14] as some of them committed
[1:23:16] and fell in one day
[1:23:19] three and twenty thousand
[1:23:23] lord
[1:23:24] deliver
[1:23:26] all of your children
[1:23:28] everywhere
[1:23:30] neither let us step christ
[1:23:33] as some of them also tempted and were
[1:23:36] destroyed of serpents
[1:23:39] neither murmur ye
[1:23:41] that's good advice
[1:23:43] as some of them also murmured
[1:23:46] and were destroyed of the destroyer now
[1:23:50] all of these things happen unto them
[1:23:54] for in samples
[1:23:57] and they are written for our admonition
[1:24:01] upon whom
[1:24:03] the ends of the world are come
[1:24:08] now in the 11th chapter
[1:24:11] where
[1:24:13] i got mixed up
[1:24:16] you see
[1:24:18] i couldn't understand
[1:24:21] it says
[1:24:24] in
[1:24:29] verse 18
[1:24:31] of the 11th chapter
[1:24:33] for first of all when you come together
[1:24:36] in the church
[1:24:37] i hear that there be divisions
[1:24:40] among you
[1:24:42] and i partly believe it
[1:24:45] for there must be also heresies among
[1:24:49] you
[1:24:50] that they which are approved
[1:24:53] may be made manifest among you
[1:24:57] when you come together therefore into
[1:25:00] one place
[1:25:03] this is not
[1:25:06] to eat the lord's supper
[1:25:10] and if you go to strong's
[1:25:12] concordance
[1:25:14] it just says
[1:25:16] you cannot eat the lord's supper
[1:25:20] the reason is the lord's already eat his
[1:25:23] supper
[1:25:25] and the disciples
[1:25:27] when he did he served them
[1:25:31] he said
[1:25:32] but i want to here's a spiritual lesson
[1:25:35] for us
[1:25:36] for in eating everyone taketh before
[1:25:39] other his own supper
[1:25:42] one was hungry another's drunken
[1:25:46] oh my
[1:25:47] what
[1:25:49] have you not houses to eat and to drink
[1:25:52] it
[1:25:53] or despise ye the church of god
[1:25:56] and shame them that have not
[1:26:00] what shall i say unto you shall i praise
[1:26:03] you in this
[1:26:05] i praise
[1:26:07] you not
[1:26:10] so
[1:26:11] when i said lord
[1:26:13] show it to me in the scriptures
[1:26:17] he told me to come
[1:26:20] in this book
[1:26:22] and start reading right there
[1:26:26] for i have received of the lord
[1:26:29] that which also i delivered unto you
[1:26:33] that the lord jesus the same night
[1:26:37] in which he was portrayed
[1:26:40] took bread
[1:26:42] and when he had given thanks
[1:26:45] he break it and said
[1:26:48] take heat
[1:26:50] this
[1:26:51] is my body
[1:26:54] which is broken for you
[1:26:58] amen
[1:26:59] this
[1:27:00] is my body
[1:27:02] which is broken
[1:27:05] for you
[1:27:07] hallelujah
[1:27:09] he said
[1:27:14] take heat
[1:27:15] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:27:20] this do ye
[1:27:21] in remembrance of me
[1:27:25] then the holy spirit
[1:27:28] just stopped me right there and said to
[1:27:31] me
[1:27:32] what are you going to stop partaking
[1:27:35] of the lord spiritually
[1:27:38] the lord i hope
[1:27:41] never
[1:27:42] because my eternal life
[1:27:44] depends on my eternal
[1:27:47] relationship with you
[1:27:51] now
[1:27:53] he said read the rest
[1:27:55] amen
[1:27:58] so
[1:28:00] after the same manner also
[1:28:04] he took the cup
[1:28:06] when he had stopped saying
[1:28:09] this cup
[1:28:10] is the new testament in my blood
[1:28:14] this
[1:28:15] to ye
[1:28:18] i said how long are you going to stop
[1:28:22] take it particularly spiritually i said
[1:28:26] lord
[1:28:27] i don't ever stop
[1:28:31] but
[1:28:32] notice here
[1:28:34] he said
[1:28:36] this do you as soft
[1:28:39] as you drink it
[1:28:41] in remembrance of me
[1:28:44] for as often as you eat this bread
[1:28:48] and drink
[1:28:50] this cup
[1:28:52] you do show
[1:28:54] the lord's death
[1:28:57] till he
[1:28:58] come
[1:29:01] amen
[1:29:02] hallelujah
[1:29:04] i'm going to go just a little further
[1:29:07] wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread
[1:29:10] drink this cup of the lord unworthily
[1:29:16] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[1:29:20] the lord
[1:29:21] so you need to start praying
[1:29:25] and keep praying
[1:29:26] all the time
[1:29:28] that if there's anything between you and
[1:29:31] him
[1:29:33] get it all out of the way
[1:29:36] amen because you're going to find out
[1:29:40] the reason why
[1:29:42] he said let a man
[1:29:44] examine himself
[1:29:47] now the devil would like to have you
[1:29:50] examine everybody else
[1:29:54] don't let him
[1:29:55] get you into that
[1:29:58] examine himself
[1:30:01] so let him eat of that bread
[1:30:03] let him drink of that cup
[1:30:08] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:30:11] eateth and tricketh damnation to himself
[1:30:15] not discerning
[1:30:17] the lord's body
[1:30:20] for this cause listen to this
[1:30:23] many are weak
[1:30:25] and sickly among you
[1:30:27] and many sleep
[1:30:36] to get out of fellowship
[1:30:39] with one another is dangerous
[1:30:43] to get out of fellowship with the lord
[1:30:45] is very
[1:30:46] dangerous
[1:30:48] for if we
[1:30:50] would judge ourselves
[1:30:52] we should not be judged amen
[1:30:55] but when we are judged
[1:30:57] we are chastened of the lord
[1:31:00] that we should not be condemned
[1:31:05] with the world
[1:31:08] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:31:11] together to eat
[1:31:13] carry one for another
[1:31:16] and if any man hunger
[1:31:19] let him eat at home
[1:31:22] so we
[1:31:23] we don't come
[1:31:25] to eat to feel
[1:31:27] a
[1:31:28] hunger on the breaking of bread
[1:31:32] amen
[1:31:34] see
[1:31:35] he said
[1:31:37] let him eat at home
[1:31:39] that she come not together under
[1:31:42] condemnation
[1:31:44] and the rest will i set in order
[1:31:48] when i come
[1:31:49] i wish we had that business meet
[1:31:53] but i believe this is sufficient
[1:31:57] amen
[1:31:59] it's important i'm going to show you now
[1:32:03] god told moses
[1:32:06] if israel doesn't take
[1:32:10] the
[1:32:11] 11th bread
[1:32:14] and keep the passover
[1:32:18] he is not
[1:32:21] he is not
[1:32:23] to be called an israelite anymore
[1:32:28] amen think of that
[1:32:32] and if they eat leaven
[1:32:35] now
[1:32:36] as far as i know
[1:32:39] the best bread in the whole world is
[1:32:42] right here
[1:32:44] it's not mixed with any false doctrine
[1:32:47] but it does warn you
[1:32:49] there will be false prophets
[1:32:52] amen
[1:32:54] hey let your roots
[1:32:57] go downward
[1:32:59] let your arms stay up
[1:33:02] amen
[1:33:04] love the lord
[1:33:05] with all your heart amen
[1:33:09] and get ready for it for brother john's
[1:33:12] already told us it's gonna be
[1:33:16] pretty soon
[1:33:17] amen
[1:33:19] and so
[1:33:20] i'm gonna try to close some time
[1:33:25] is there anyone here tonight
[1:33:28] that you've been praying about a certain
[1:33:30] thing
[1:33:31] just
[1:33:32] just lift your hand
[1:33:35] amen all right
[1:33:38] now heavenly father
[1:33:40] here we are in your presence
[1:33:44] here we are having
[1:33:46] feasted on
[1:33:48] some things from the old testament
[1:33:51] some thinks from the new testament
[1:33:55] and they're both true
[1:33:58] they both applied at a certain time for
[1:34:02] certain people
[1:34:04] but by your grace
[1:34:08] you
[1:34:09] have crafted a sin
[1:34:12] that we might be children
[1:34:15] of the kingdom
[1:34:18] the same kingdom of god
[1:34:21] that israel's going to be a part of
[1:34:24] you have different plans
[1:34:27] for both of us perhaps
[1:34:29] but the main thing
[1:34:31] all of us want eternity with you
[1:34:36] credit lord
[1:34:37] if there's any anything in our heart
[1:34:40] against any brother
[1:34:43] just let us have the
[1:34:45] courage and the faith
[1:34:47] to pray
[1:34:48] for that brother
[1:34:50] until there's no bitterness
[1:34:53] in our heart
[1:34:54] whatsoever
[1:34:56] and
[1:34:57] the lord will take it away and may god
[1:35:00] bless you
[1:35:02] and if you
[1:35:04] need the holy ghost
[1:35:05] hey
[1:35:07] make it known
[1:35:09] hallelujah
[1:35:11] just let's really pray
[1:35:14] for
[1:35:18] naomi's husband
[1:35:20] his name is tim
[1:35:23] is that right
[1:35:26] jimmy so let's remember him
[1:35:31] in prayer
[1:35:33] i i felt i was so glad several come and
[1:35:36] prayed with him
[1:35:38] and before i left he came back and slept
[1:35:42] by me
[1:35:43] and i had a little prayer meeting with
[1:35:46] him
[1:35:47] and
[1:35:47] there was tears
[1:35:49] so i believe
[1:35:50] he really is meaning business
[1:35:53] just pray
[1:35:55] for him that god will fill him
[1:35:58] full of that spirit
[1:36:00] very soon
[1:36:01] god bless you
[1:36:03] thank you brother john
[1:36:06] amen
[1:36:08] [Applause]
[1:36:22] that word was so timely there was
[1:36:25] so many things i was
[1:36:29] could be said
[1:36:30] um
[1:36:31] and
[1:36:33] wish
[1:36:35] uh they they could have been said
[1:36:36] because they're all good and edifying
[1:36:38] the the story that you had about uh
[1:36:42] forgiving
[1:36:44] you know showing the difference between
[1:36:46] uh affiliate love and agape love
[1:36:49] lay not this into their charge and just
[1:36:52] so many wonderful
[1:36:54] stories but
[1:36:55] um getting into
[1:36:57] um the importance
[1:36:59] of
[1:37:00] communion that will be taken and the
[1:37:02] reverence
[1:37:04] and to make sure that our hearts
[1:37:06] um
[1:37:07] are are right before the lord
[1:37:10] um when we when we think
[1:37:12] so often we allow little thoughts and
[1:37:15] feelings and things to
[1:37:17] to be there thinking it's not that big a
[1:37:19] difference and in reality
[1:37:23] it is it is because
[1:37:26] when jesus makes this statement
[1:37:28] that he will not forgive us if we don't
[1:37:31] forgive one another
[1:37:33] and and in all honesty i know that
[1:37:35] there's a big bullseye on me because i'm
[1:37:38] up here all the time i say things
[1:37:41] and
[1:37:42] i'm not perfect
[1:37:44] and
[1:37:45] decisions have to be made and they're
[1:37:47] not always perfect
[1:37:49] um
[1:37:50] so it is it is easy
[1:37:53] um
[1:37:53] to um
[1:37:55] to get in trouble
[1:37:57] uh but we we need
[1:37:59] to uh bear one another pray for one
[1:38:02] another love one another
[1:38:05] uh and
[1:38:06] and uh
[1:38:07] sometimes we just got to love covers a
[1:38:10] multitude of sin and that has to prevail
[1:38:14] that has to prevail because if you think
[1:38:16] about it our relationship with the lord
[1:38:18] it always ends with this
[1:38:21] if it wasn't for the grace of god i
[1:38:22] wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the
[1:38:24] love of god i wouldn't be here and so it
[1:38:26] is an honor for the lord to be inside of
[1:38:29] us doing the same thing one to another
[1:38:31] just loving one another beyond reasoning
[1:38:34] or understanding but just the holy ghost
[1:38:37] loving others
[1:38:38] through you
[1:38:39] amen let's sing
[1:38:42] um
[1:38:44] when i uh see the blood um
[1:38:48] i do we know that one okay when i see
[1:38:50] the blood amen
[1:38:52] amen
[1:38:53] amen
[1:38:57] christ
[1:38:58] our redeemer
[1:39:00] died on the cross
[1:39:03] died for the sin
[1:39:06] paid
