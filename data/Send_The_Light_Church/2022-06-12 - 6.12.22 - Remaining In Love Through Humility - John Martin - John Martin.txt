that i was just sharing the gospel with it at the grocery store and she um she wants to know christ but she don't she just believes that you know your spirit just moves on that goes where it's going to move on to the dog and her animal or i mean you know you know so i said just pray that the lord would just reveal himself to her she knows who he is amen also just for all the missionaries uh let's just pray for all everybody that's uh has maybe an illness here today that the lord would just strengthen you give you strength amen to serve it more to serve him better and uh for all the people that we're witnessing too that they can just receive christ amen also just one announcement uh let's not forget uh next sunday uh we're gonna have uh communion and foot washing so amen i know a lot of people has been uh anticipating that and uh whether it's your first time or or your one on earth it doesn't get old and um so we just pray for that and we just pray that the lord would just put it upon our hearts this week to prepare our hearts that we can go covered under the blood amen uh let's just stand let's go on one accord amen dear heavenly father lord as we come before you this morning lord god we are your children lord you've called us out of the darkness into the light lord and lord we just uh we're we've put these petitions and prayers before you lord god for this uh collins family lord with this house explosion lord that lord and lost their lives lord god that you would just comfort the rest of the family lord you accept them in your arms or god we don't know where they

lord in their lives lord god we thank you lord jesus we pray that you just be with our pastor as he would prepare the word and for us lord let us receive it as it was out of your mouth lord we love you we praise you in the precious name of jesus christ this morning amen you may be seated amen sister trish do you uh have an announcement do you want to come up from here okay so um first of all i just wanted to make some announcements about sunday school but before i do i just want to say how much of a blessing it has been for me to watch you know all these children come in and be excited about hearing about from the lord and to learn um and not only that it's been exciting for each of them you know to see it grow and to just blossom um so thank you thank you for the sacrifice your parents take to make sure they get to me on time and you know that they can be involved in that but i wanted to go over just kind of like the time frame of what sunday school is just to so everybody's on the same page sunday school does start at 9 15. it's very important because we're a very small room with lots of kids that we try to get there on time because when we have interruptions or you know kids coming in late or anything like that it does pause everything and then it's hard to get the kids back on track and have such a limited time with them it's very difficult i usually shut the door about 9 20 9 22. at that point we're fully into whatever lesson we're learning at that point i have asked the kids if the door is shut to just kind of stay with mom and dad because to start over it's very difficult to start back over and to actually get it completed in a lot of time the other thing i wanted to ask everybody is if we could be mindful about the last seven minutes before church starts is when i take all the kids to the restroom and i do that so that parents can be in service and they don't have to leave when the kids come in the kids are already taken care of but if we could kind of leave that open for them the last seven minutes before service starts so i can get them in and out in time would be greatly appreciated if there's an emergency and i know those things happen that you're going to be late there is an app in the telegram for that you can just communicate with me so i can hold back or kind of change things a little bit so they can still be involved and let's see what else i also put this sunday school script scripture each week in there so that they can work on those and i really just ask ask the kids what they're learning get them talking about it um it's a it's a great way to get them asking like it's supper what was your scripture what are you learning and it just could open up to a whole different kind of bible study to get where they're at their perspective many times in sunday school we'll be learning something but it's not till we come in here and the lord will speak something through the minister and it just clicks and they're like oh i get it and i know sometimes it doesn't seem important that they're there but it's so important for them it's so important for their perspective so i just encourage that sacrifice you won't you won't regret it so thank you and thank you guys for working hard on your scriptures and coming to sunday school i really appreciate it amen hallelujah amen thank you sister amen thank you for your sacrifice amen also i just wanted to mention our brother jason is battling some stomach issues amen and brother uh uh roger has some unbespokens and if anybody else has them just lift him up to the lord this morning amen uh let's just sing near the cross amen [Music] there's a precious fountain free to uh stream flows from calvary's mountain in the crosses the cross be my glory ever [Music] till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river near the cross a trembling soul love and mercy found me there the bright and mornings star sheds its beams around me in the crossing the cross be my glory ever till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river near the cross oh lamb of god brings its sins before me help me walk from day to day [Music] [Applause] [Music] my glory ever till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river near the cross i'll watch and wait hope being trusted ever till i reach that golden stream just beyond the river in the cross in the cross be my glory [Music] till my raptured soul shall find rest beyond the river [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen we can have rust on this side of the river but hallelujah just imagine the rest on the other side hallelujah amen lord you are so precious to me hallelujah lord you are so precious to me lord you are so precious to me and i love you yes i love you because you first love me to sing it to him lord you are so precious to me lord you are so gracious to me and i love you yes i love you because you first love me oh lord you are so precious to me lord you are so precious to me and i love you yes i love you because you first love me hallelujah hallelujah amen if we could just stand we're just going to change the order of service and just pray for the offerings amen dear heavenly father we're so thankful lord that you have a full house tonight lord that lord we can gather in your presence lord we can receive from you lord and i pray that lord you would just receive our worship receive our hearts and to yours lord god that we might receive lord what you would have for us in this late hour lord god we look forward to the lord the word coming and just transforming us lord lord we're so thankful for this building and it's the ability to come and worship you of with a free heart lord god lord we know that there's many things lord that supplied our our needs lord and we just pray that you would just prick our hearts lord that we just be just lord just faithful to you as you've been faithful to us in this hour lord we thank you in the name of jesus christ amen let's just stay standing amen and just sing mercy rewrote my life amen [Music] my life [Music] god's mercy reroll my love [Music] i should have fallen my soul cast out but mercy rewrote my life mercy [Music] i should have fallen my soul cast out but mercy re-wrote my life hallelujah let's just thank him for his mercy today and to sing i will enter his gate amen hallelujah i will enter his cage with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his courts with praise i will say this is the day that the lord has made i will rejoice for he has made me glad oh he has made me glad he has made me glad i will rejoice for he has made me glad he has made me glad he has made me glad i will rejoice for he has made me glad i will enter his cage with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his gorge with praise i will say this

jesus hallelujah hallelujah god bless you hallelujah hallelujah [Music] amen i will enter his gates with thanksgiving in my heart i will enter his courts with praise i would say this is the day that the lord has paid i will rejoice for he has made me glad just express it to him he has made me glad he has made me glad i will rejoice for he has made me glad he has made me glad he has made me glad i will rejoice for he has made me glad [Laughter] hey man amen it's a good place to express it is in his house can you imagine if somebody came to your house as soon as they came in they just began to complain about everything this is god's house somebody come into your house and say i like this i like this this looks beautiful this is nice it makes you feel good and and god god wants us to remember all that he's done for us it's a good place to give thanks is in the house of prayer amen amen i say god bless you it's good to see each one good to see brother cal and sister linda with us amen uh turn with me if you would to the book of saint john chapter 15 and then we're going to also be reading in first peter chapter five i want to say happy birthday to brother bruce man i know he doesn't want me to say anything but praise the lord amen we appreciate brother bruce and just appreciate god's god's grace and protection upon sister johnson she our sister got a hurt foul and her hurt her head a lot of blood but she's here today by the grace of god we just thank the lord for that amen thankful for brother johnson and the message he brought to us on wednesday and still been feeding on that and meditating and trying to pray more we just appreciate brother johnson so much amen before we read god's word let's just bow on a word of prayer our heavenly father we thank you for all the wonderful things that you've done for us in our life and today you've given us health and strength to be here lord when we think about something greater than that it was the desire you placed in our heart to be here we thank you for that desire we thank you that you haven't taken the way we we're thankful that you've protected us from the enemy who would try to just drown that out with the things of the world but lord we want to be together with our brothers and sisters and lord you promised to be where just two or three would be gathered together in your name you'd be right there in the midst and lord we don't see with our physical eyes and we don't always feel you with our our the feelings and of our flesh and our emotions but something on the inside lord knows that you're here because we believe in your word your word has never failed you promised that we're just two would be gathered together in your name you'd be there in the midst lord we we're your believing children we believe it today and father as we enter into this precious part of the service the reading of the word and the the ministering of the word and the the receiving the hearing and receiving the word we just pray that you would anoint it all lord we know your word is already anointed but lord we want that same anointing to be on us that was on the word when it was written that you'd give us the revelation of the word let us leave here more in love with you than when we came and commit all this to you now with all the needs that would be in our midst we love you in the precious name of jesus christ amen amen saint john chapter 15 verse number 9 and 10 as the father have loved me so have i loved you continue in my love and if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i kept my father's commandments and abide in his love and then in first peter chapter five just one verse verse number five likewise ye younger submit yourselves unto the elder yea all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for god resisted the proud and giveth grace to the humble amen god bless you may be seated i want to say it's certainly good to see brother jonathan sister gabriel back with us we've missed you and know there's been hard trials for you but may the lord just keep you and may you continue to grow in the love of god amen amen well we want to when brother johnson was closing in prayer last sunday he made a statement that we could just never finish ministering on the love of god and how true that is we're having a hard time just getting through this one part about the love of god but we want to just try to take a little a little bit of uh of god's love and and and and and meditate upon it this morning amen we want to title this message it's really part two of of the last service remaining in love but through humility and we may seem this as two different um two different subjects love and humility and could be but um i think if you really want to remain in love one of the most important things that we must have is humility in fact peter says we need to be clothed in it we all got up this morning we all picked out the clothes we got and we're all here and we wanted uh we know that when people would look us it'd be looking at our clothes to some degree is that true okay so when god is looking at us he wants to see humility he doesn't want to see any pride because in fact he kind of like wants to go the other way he resists that but he's he's looking for humility we think about his great love where with he loved us it brings us a warmth and it brings us a security to our hearts but when we think about the requirements of abiding in god's love it brings an uncomfortable feeling but yet they're both god's love and jesus did not mind expressing for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son but then he also makes a statement that if you love me you'll keep my commandments showing that there's a relationship that he's interested in amen now um uh saint john chapter 15 verse 7 if if if we could just i would just want to read that here it says if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what it what you will and it shall be done unto you look at the prerequisite here is the in abiding you've got to abide in christ and christ has got to abide in you and then you ask what you will it's like a prerequisite we want to stare at using the name of jesus for all the benefits that we can get out of it in my name they'll cast out devils but there's coming today in in matthew chapter 7 right around verse number 22 it says in my name um many will come to me in that day and say lord then we use your name to cast out devils and to to do many wonderful works and and to speak with tongues but he says but then i'll say unto you i never knew you and so there is a a part of us that that wants to use the name of christ and and see the power of god and things to happen and that is wonderful and there's nothing wrong with it there's many churches that emphasize that but i believe that the most important thing is our relationship with god by far it's the most important and i think that's what makes this ministry uh maybe hard to have that real warm comfortable feeling with because we're dealing with things on our end of the relationship because god's end of the relationship is perfect it's not lacking anything our faith may be lacking but but god is not lacking amen so it's not what we feel but it's believing the word that really changes our life perfect love not only saves us but it lifts us up when we're down and his love is presently leading us to a perfect love relationship with him that's what's happening he's leading us to a place that he that we can say um we um the bible says uh his wife have made herself ready and and that ready is the relationship it's not being able to use the name of jesus and i understand about uh there's a place that we all got to come to an adoption to where we can you know take the checkbook and use the name and and god put a stamp of approval behind it and we need that but we need to emphasize staying in love with god that word abide it means to remain so to to remain in love to be present in love to dwell in love to stand and stay in love that is our goal in part one of our series remaining in god we talked about remaining faithful and it's impossible to grow in christ if without remaining faithful it's like the foundation of of growing anywhere if you take a regular tree and and it's this high and you you dig it out from where it was from a ceiling and you go take it out and you put it over there the first year it's not going to grow it spends all of its time becoming re-established in the ground and then if you take that same tree and you plant it again the next year from one place to the next place to the next place it never has a chance to grow because it's constantly working and getting established in its new foundation and we as christians we've got to remain faithful in the spot that god had planted us if we're going to grow it's in it's important it's pertinent every time we think that certain things that god has commanded us to do are important that's when problems begin to develop because if god told us it's important we send a strong message that god isn't really interested in the relationship he's just interested in certain things and before you know it we really don't even know god because it's you know one person believes this so one person believes that one person thinks this is but what really is important is that we all come under subjection to this and the closer we can do that the more we can do that the more we can represent what true faithfulness is true christian is god is looking for faithfulness not picking and choosing but to remain faithful to every word it is the secret to growing in christ you know brother branham says if you want to get closer to the lord read your bible and pray every day and god is really hidden simplicity and if we just do that i don't know how many times i've read the bible and then god has spoke to me how many times i've gotten on my knees you know you're trying to figure something out but i got on my knees and then boom it was just unfolded and and but both of these things take us away from what our flesh wants to do but we've got to discipline ourselves faithfulness is so important that brother branham says this he says god is not obligated to show you anything more until you've walked in the light that god has shown you that's how important faithfulness is to god we need to be faithful and remain faithful and part two we spoke on remaining fruitful when you remain fruitful in the vine you'll be bearing the fruit of the holy spirit continuously continuously now there there are certain fruits the bible tells us that come in their season right but then there are certain fruits that should be continuously and we don't want to get it mixed up but we ought to be bearing the fruit of the holy ghost all the time all the time i don't care if somebody's yelling at you somebody's cutting you off on the road well you look at the next gas price it doesn't matter the fruit of the spirit should always be there and it's god's desire that we we bear much fruit that's what what jesus said jesus told us that we should expect to be pruned even if we're bearing fruit even if we're bearing fruit he sends a message that you need to expect some prunings coming not because we're bad we're wrong we haven't done good but god is showing his nature and his desire what he's wanting to see out of his children and that's to see such a fruitful life not to be satisfied with a little but but but god has a great expectation for us i know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord thoughts of peace to give us an expected end and i believe peace is a part of the fruit of the holy ghost don't you he is our peace he is the potter worthy clay he's allowed to prune us jesus said in saint john chapter 15 verse 16 you have not chosen me but i have chosen you and i've ordained you that you should go and bring for fruit and that your fruit should remain don't stop bearing the fruit and if if that happens look at here it is that whatsoever you ask in the father's name he may give it unto you jesus is looking for the fruit before he's wanting us to just use his name for things come on speaking of relationship and i know this isn't a good feeling for our flesh but we don't come here because of that we don't if we did i would be the first one to get out of the way and get somebody up here that knows how to make us feel good because i know i wouldn't be the candidate for that nor do i ever want to be it's not in me i don't want to face god with bats i've done a lot of bad things i want to stay with the word amen now look at the very next verse he shares with us what the fruit ought to be bearing he said these things i command you that you love one another that's the fruit that we should be bearing all the time not just to our favorite friends not just to somebody that we're trying to get somebody from get something from them but our enemies the ones that bother us the most the ones we have a hard time with god don't have a hard time bearing love he didn't have a hard time bearing love with judas he didn't kick him out fact he chose them i don't think you know we should be struggling ever with loving one another no i don't and i think that love should be so strong in us that we should better humble ourselves and love one another those that use us despitefully in other words they do over and over and they know what they're doing but to to lay down our life for them that shows god in you to go ahead and say i'm not going to do this for this one but i'll do it for this one it shows that's not god it shows that there's a respect to persons and god is not in that so i'll say like this i know when i look in the mirror i've got growing to do i want you to grow with me i want you to just put your teeth into this and say god i don't want to be halfway he's not choosing halfway he's calling his bride to a perfect love now i say everybody but the bride will have less than perfect love so why would we want to stay there amen so we got to press towards it now early in the chapter our of our opening scripture jesus said in in in chapter 15 verse 9 is the father have loved me so have i loved you continue in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i kept my father's commandments and abide in his love last sunday we spoke on remaining in love we first described that god is love and it and it's so powerful that it's always living for others and i think that is a good way to say god's love is so powerful that it's always living for others what it seems like in our life we try to live for others when it's convenient when we got this done that's done we've got all the things handled and there's no problems in our life and then we can do something to for somebody that is not the love of god that's the convenient love but i say that love of god is so powerful that i don't care if you're on a cross and you're looking down at your at your at your disciple and you say to him son behold thy mother mother behold the son and he was suffering or stephen when they were throwing stones on them and he said father forgive them i i pray that you have mercy on them that was god in stephen living for others and going through the hardest times anybody can pick and choose when it's okay too often we think that we have god's love when we're trying to help someone we'll give them the truth and they get offended or they dislike us and we give up on them but it's feeling love it's not a gap i love feeling love has limitations it feels like i've tried i did my best i can't do any more and and what we need to do is be repeating the word the word the word doesn't quite god's love remains faithful it bears all things it believes all things it hopes all things it endures all things in fact it just never quits it keeps going every time you see the integer energizer bubble bud bubble bunny i want you to think about god's love never quits it never quits so if you feel like quitting that's normal but it's not god it's us and it's okay but we just need to identify and if you're okay with not having enough of god love well then that's fine but when you have that thought you'll realize i need to get more love see we're looking for an excuse not to keep going we're looking for an excuse that i've done enough but god don't have that this is the love that god wants us to remain in the mindset the the attitude that he wants us to have it's not a gift just like character jesus is not going to hand that to us it's a victory if you want love shout hallelujah praise the lord you've got to do something about this relationship with god you've got to abide in him you got to abide in the word you got to keep the commandments it's got to be important to you not just i love god god loves me everything's perfect no matter what i do we got to go after it we got to seek more of the holy ghost the love of god is shut abroad in our heart by the holy ghost so when you're seeking god you're seeking the living word god will come and fill our hearts and when he does you ain't gonna have a problem laying down our life for the brethren we're not going to it's good to see brother david with us today amen in god's house but we need the hat off we should take that hat off god deserves the most utmost respect amen amen but our brother homie's been praying for brother davian amen amen amen because he's a child of god he's a child of the king amen and he belongs under the protection of the holy ghost amen and i'll tell you i'm so grateful for the person who loved me when i was in the world who took time to share with me that there's a greater life because i was into a lot of stuff as you know for the nominal church believer it may not seem critic so be seen important or crucial or are critical to keep all of god's commandments but to god is very important he said this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you now god's love isn't just for our fleshly benefits god loves me god blesses me god met all my needs if there's a need that i want god to meet in my life it's the need to be able to live completely for him i'd rather take that than having money to pay my house bill honestly i i can't have everything that i every does anybody got everything they want no we might also take priority god fill me with you fill me with you we must learn to live for others be long-suffering with others greater love have no man than this and a man lay down his life for his friends and you are my friends if you do whatsoever i command you how many got how many how many is my friend today okay how many didn't want to vote what we're really saying there is that you'll lay down your life from me amen ye and my friends if you do so whatsoever i command you and we we ended up talking about what has god commanded you what has god commanded you is your is our walk this personal that we we have recognized what god is speaking to us to do and because if we if we don't capture that then we can't walk in it how can we keep it if everything is just so generic amen so it's a personal walk with god we have to to to choose to abide in that commandment to to continue to stay connected to remain in the love of god it it it it just doesn't happen at convenience but it's a choice that you have to make at the hardest time how many times have have uh somebody said something did something to you and it just hurt the daylights out of you just really hurts you and something inside of you didn't want to let the other person know that you were hurt because you didn't want to hurt them and you didn't want to hurt them back i mean it takes the love of god inside of you stronger than the situation to be able to love and that's what we're we're looking for is to remain in that love amen and it can only be done i believe not only but the greatest asset that we need is humility it's not easy as we think to abide in god's love jesus said that many will be offended in the day that we're living in and many would actually betray one another and hate one another and because iniquity has gone bonkles bonkles i mean just iniquities all over the place the love of many is just waxing cold so it looks just like some picture some formality help us lord we want to be full of the love of god brother branham said in the message the new ministry he says that god would keep me humble in my heart and i like the way that he says that he didn't ask god to make him humble he asked him to keep him humble in heart and would help me and bless me so that i could be a blessing to you people he says i found out that the greater blessings in life is giving something out not receiving it in but giving it out what you do for others so the display of eternal life is not always wanting for ourselves it's looking to help somebody help someone in the church if you don't know of of a need that somebody has spend some time with them you'll see the need you can't help but talk to somebody and see need you just become aware you become aware i'm so glad that we're having fellowship after service now we as believers are often confronted with enticing spirits these spirits they convince us that we still love god even if we're not following the word and to me it's it's the same spirit that came to eve in the garden he's doing the same thing it doesn't you don't have to do everything because you're doing the majority and it's that spirit that will eventually lead us away that's why brother branson i'd rather have the right spirit in the wrong doctrine than have the right doctrine in the wrong spirit because eventually a wrong spirit is going to lead you in the wrong direction but the right spirit even if you're wrong in how you're viewing something we'll venture to get you on the right track because it's him it's him so we ended up in this statement saying oh foolish galatians who have bewitched you that you should not obey the truth any spirit that says it doesn't matter if we go to church it doesn't matter if we do communion full rushing it doesn't matter if we we don't have to lay down our life those are enticing spirits and they're sent to get us off track but today we want to get on track here i'll say you know for the church-goers that's okay but for the bride she has an ear to hear what the spirit is saying to the church amen turn with me if you would to jude chapter 1 verse 17. and we want to start our message today remaining in love to humility and it's a terrible thing about uh having to go over the foundation of the last service because it eats up a little bit of time but here jew says but beloved remember ye the words which were spoken before the apostles of our lord jesus christ how that they told you that there should be mockers in the last day who should walk after their own desires these be they that separate themselves central having not the spirit notice the the the consensus of that that comes together that they separate themselves they're central and they don't have the spirit so church outgoers in this hour are walking after their own desires if they don't get what they want they'll leave i've heard from so many sources there's more church hopping going on than than there ever was think about it don't get what we want just go somewhere else i think jesus did tell us at one place he said if if they say go here it says go not if you don't got enough faith that god can speak to you in the middle of a storm we don't need a perfect church we need a perfect word living inside of us that's what we need that's what make our church better is someone who's willing to lay down their life for the body we got so much christ then we should be able to help the church but that's the thing there's too many people who are just in it for themselves we're at a men's bible study and our our brother um uh brother ferguson he brought out a real good point and and he said that if if the spirit isn't right it's when it's trying to uh to do something if it don't get what it wants it just quits right away he says but if if it's god in that person he'll never stop he'll just stay right there and he'll keep working because that's the spirit of god he doesn't stop with us every time we sin make a mistake or quit or bail out he's he's he's going to see us through as he's patient he's long suffering if you're trying to separate yourself i say this check your spirit when we walk after our own desires we have the tendency to not walk in the unity with the ministry with the word of god so i say don't choose to separate yourself don't allow yourself to be separated by some demonic influence these be they who separate themselves central having not the spirit but they think they do if you've got the spirit then you're going to have love love because the love of god is shed abroad in our heart by the holy spirit verse 20 but ye beloved building up yourselves on your most holy faith praying in the holy ghost here it is the verse i want to get to keep yourselves in the love of god keep yourself in the love of god this is your this is your job this is what you do this is your choice this is your attitude you either keep yourself there or you just wander off and it just doesn't matter not real important to you and you just expect everybody to love you even though you're not loving everybody keeping yourself and the love of god looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ unto eternal life jesus said continue ye in my love if you keep my commandments ye shall abide in my loves and some having some have compassion what happens those are those are special people you find somebody that's got compassion they make a difference they make a difference when you get done talking to them you feel like living more for god because it's not about getting close to one another i don't mean it wrong i love you and i want you to love me but i made a decision a long time ago if you never love me i want to i want to spend my life helping build your relationship with god because that's more important and if it's just for one soul that's what's important god and you that's the most important thing we could jesus said you could have the whole world what would it gain you what would it gain you all the popularity all the money all the things that you could have what would it gain you nothing nothing keep yourself in the love of god some having compassion making a difference and we must remember it's our choice to stay in love with god if it's all about convenience and all the needs are met and all you got to do is just well you're going to soon be sifted out because satan wants to sift every one of us like wheat we're to stay connected to the vine of god's great love wherewith he has loved us amen now jesus summed it all up in this when he said if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love now the problem is is it's hard to keep god's commandments we get distracted a lot and we forget about them how important they are and what becomes important is all of our problems and to find answers to all of our problems and to find a way to uh to get more money to pay for the gas now and i mike was telling me about uh somebody had to sell his semis and all of his his company his equipment because he he he didn't have enough money to buy the gas to to truck the supplies because they don't give you more and trucking companies are going out of out of business and i'm telling you we're all feeling and if not we're going to be feeling the effect there is a squeeze and brother brian said that squeeze is even going to come on the bride first john chapter 2 verse 4 first john chapter 2 verse 4 he that saith i know him and keepeth not his commandments as a liar and the truth is not in him but who so keepeth the word in him verily is the love of god perfected and hereby know we that we are in him he that abideth him all ought himself also to walk even as he walks so i mean if you want to see the love of god perfected in you keep the word put more emphasis on you following the word not you saying i agree i agree that the word is true i believe it's god that's not going to help you what you got to step out and say lord where am i missing you where am i not following your word not just focusing only on what you are doing but what you're not doing that's important i don't want you to be discouraged or or be bothered but we need the love of god perfected in us right all right his commandments are the whole bible and not only the whole bible but what about the things he comes and speaks to you when you're in prayer maybe you can't find that exactly for word but it's still god brother says we come to church to find out where we're at with god we have that tendency of forgetting the commandments so this is why we want to come and be reminded this is where we're at god speaks to us personally i want to talk about some practical things but we're only going to get hopefully hopefully at least with my notes through just one and and that's to keep keep ourselves humble god gives more grace to the humble while resisting the prowl so god hates a proud look a proud smirk a proud comment a proud uh roll of the eyes uh some sort of gesture god hates that spirit amen but he's looking for us to be clothed with humility a realness a real humility don't ask to be humble in other words don't put it off on god it's an attitude that we choose to carry around i remember in brother johnson's church when brother hankins was preaching one time he says don't you pray to be humble he said just be humble be humble it's your choice it's an attitude thing your attitude is going to make a big difference in where you go with re remaining in the love of god the bible says humble yourselves under the mighty hand of god now god's company is not with everybody he loves everybody but his company is not with everybody his company is with the humble of heart isaiah 57 verse 15 says for thus saith the lord saith the high and lofty one that inhabits eternity so we all know who we're who we're looking at here whose name is holy i dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and a humble spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite one so god is dwelling with a humble spirit and if he resists the proud i'll say to try to remain in love with god and not have a humble spirit is going to be impossible impossible no matter what we feel what we think what we believe we've got to stay with the word if you really want to keep yourself in the love of god then keep your spirit humble broken and contrite it's important when you're talking to people people see whether you're clothed with humility or your clothes with look at me look for areas in your life that need work and work on them be zealous and repent we're going to dive into something perhaps that we've never quite seen before but first john chapter 3 verse 1 behold what matter of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth this not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he show up here we're going to be just like him first we shall see him as he is now that's the truth now if this is the way you believe it says in every man that has this hope in him purify it that word makes clean sanctifies himself even as he is pure so there is a work for us to do there's something and we need to be looking at what we need and when you look at your needs you will act more humble when you look at everybody else's needs you will be more judgmental because if god ever shows you something about somebody you will lay down your life to help them but if the devil shows you something wrong about somebody you'll do nothing to help that person you'll just state what's wrong and it's real easy to know what spirit is speaking to you because you don't got to know the truth to find critic to find something wrong about somebody the more you remain humble the more you'll have a repentant spirit and the more you repent the more you'll be forgiven and the more that you're forgiven the more that you're forgiven the more you love god i want that to soak in we've all been forgiven of our sins we've asked but i wonder just how much of us look at forgiveness is such a treasure to be forgiven or if it's just oh yeah you know i just asked god to cover me with his blood and it's done and i don't even think about no more look at isaiah chapter six he was in that high and holy place the high end with with the high and lofty one the one that inhabits eternity and the first thing that isaiah recognizes when he's there is how unworthy he is to be in the presence of god amen so we can kind of come into church and we just feel you know like where is that humility where is that unworthiness to be in his presence what are we entering into and we've all felt the presence of god in our cars right listening to a song praying sometime and his presence just comes and saturates you baptize you and you end up crying so we know about the presence of god and when the presence of god comes you feel unworthy you do not feel like you're something special like you've got something more than somebody you feel unworthy to be in the same place that god is at this is something that isaiah was feeling and he says this word he said woe is me he didn't need some preacher to tell him what was wrong in his life if you got to have somebody tell you what's wrong you got to get in the presence of the lord you're in the wrong presence he said in chapter 6 verse 5 woe is me i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and when we remain in the presence of god we'll always feel unworthy this is important if you want to be close with humility you need to feel this way i mean how many times i i brother stan was telling me uh of of vision he's visited a number of churches in the past he's telling me about a a certain church he went into and and and and the the minister um would drive up on in the biggest uh cadillac and and there that gold all over him he was just almost plated with gold he had so much gold on him and he was trying to tell everybody that you need to give more money to the church when we're clothed i'm just saying like this when you're clothed with humility you feel unworthy it's a spirit that you decide that you want to pack around just like if you want to pack around a lot of gold you're going to do it if you want to pack around a lot of pride you're going to do it if you want to pack around a lot of humility you're going to do it now isaiah repented and he fell more in love with god and it took god to actually cleanse him but if he didn't start with lord i need you i'm undone amen he would have never got cleansed it took a repent of heart and the beauty of this he fell so much in love with god that when god asked him to do something he said i'll do it who go for it lord send me he didn't say send that guy send that girl you know no lord send me it's a personal thing i mean i would to god that we would all get so personal with god that we would actually say lord send me send me lord that's where our relationship needs to get to a repentant heart and spirit will always stay in love with god and i want to go with kind of a lengthy reading and this perhaps may be our our last but it's in luke chapter 7 verse 36 how important is to be clothed with humility to always have that repent of heart that repentant spear not wanting to hurt anybody but to help somebody are you with me now just so you know um you did not come to church today to hear a sermon about how great you're doing we just we just came to hear how we can stay more in love with god how many has felt that you've drifted away from the love of god okay it is something that happens to every one of us from time to time and so this is just showing us the way to remain in god's love so in luke chapter 7 verse 36 and one of the pharisees desired him that he would eat jesus would eat with him and he went into the pharisees house and sat down to to meet and be hold a woman in the city which was a sinner when she knew that jesus said it meet in the pharisees house brought an alabaster box of anointment and he stood at his feet behind him weeping look at the humility wasn't in front but behind began to wash his feet with with tears and did wipe them with the hairs of her head and and kissed his feet and anointed them with anointment now when the pharisee which had bitten jesus saw it he spake within himself saying this man this man who you claim if he were a prophet he would have known who and what matter woman this is that touched him for she is a sinner hmm i say like this if you're going to do something for the kingdom you better have tough skin because the devil is going to find someone he can use to come against you why is that it's because he wants to stop what you're doing think about this a cup of cold water did you know that ever since we got these bottles you lost the opportunity to give a cup of cold water but a cup of cold water given in his name it shall not lose its reward we should not lose our reward but the devil is trying to stop the work of the lord here was a sinner doing something for the kingdom and satan hated it how much more will the bride of jesus christ when she's walking in harmony with the holy ghost and doing something for the kingdom will the devil just try to stop it you'll have the weapons of hell coming against you we need to work together for the kingdom of god i'm okay with not carrying the ball but i'll tell you i am not going to sit around and let somebody else carry the ball without blocking that's just not me i by far would rather sit in the back seat but there's something inside you just don't want to sit around for god you want to do something for the kingdom of god now simon said if this man was of god if he was being led of god certainly he would have not allowed and done this awful thing it's amazing to me how judgmental people can get in this last day people are becoming more and more judgmental they're they're hating they're offending their love is waxing colder and colder the devil is looking for anybody that he can just whisper something negative to brother branham said it's not the action that takes place but the reaction simon was reacting wrong in his heart to a situation the scripture says be careful how we we talk to strangers for some have entertained angels unawares it's not the action the reaction if you think someone is wrong this is your chance to help them and if we're too lazy or we don't got enough faith to help someone then we should zip the lip brother john i don't like this kind of preaching well i don't like this kind of judgment god don't like this kind of judgment god would rather see all of us washing one another's feet helping one another functioning as a body as a family and we can only do that if we come in harmony with the word we humble ourselves get close with humility and realize that god hasn't called me this church to kind of straighten it out how about just help someone help them get underneath them brother brandon says it takes a big man to get underneath another man get underneath him telling somebody they're wrong in a fit of rage and judging them is not going to help simon's motive was not to help this is what we must understand he had he invited jesus to his place but his motive was not to help it was to be judgmental it's why the prophet taught us to check our motives it's easy to judge someone but it's difficult to deny our flesh that lust and only wants to please itself now i would imagine if this same jesus who simon judged would have just kind of like left the woman there and came over to simon and said simon you're the greatest thing here in this building today well i don't think he would have had those thoughts do you but simon is still who simon is we must remember that this is why it's important for us to be close with humility like right now as much as you wanted to wear a different color you couldn't do it right now because you already decided to do what you're doing you can't just put on humility and and and and take it on and off like a light switch it's there it's there he ever been so mad and so angry and you're trying to suppress it but then in talking to somebody just like comes out that's how pride is that's how being judgmental is it can just it just comes out so humility is a real clothing of the spirit amen people are missing the love of god in their heart people are are never going to know that we're his disciple if we're always judging what's wrong we've got to move up to the next step we got to lay down our lives for what's wrong for who's wrong but if i do that you know what they're going to do oh just tell me a list of it i really don't care because jesus never gave an excuse why not to do it why not to lay down your life he didn't say lay down your life except brother brandon never said eternal life is living for others except if we can't do it for our enemy we still got the goods how much more are we to do it for one another think about it bible says when a man is overtaken in a fault god wants a spiritual man to go restore him not just someone who knows the person's fault who has a bunch of head knowledge of what's right or wrong but someone with a another spirit like joshua and caleb had another spirit a spirit that's capable to restore it would be better to say like if i was to ask you right now there is a man down the road from us he said he is so possessed with a demon and i'd like you to come cast them out well some of you may feel like i'm unprepared for this sometimes we're unprepared to restore somebody we really just don't got the meekness the love the patience and the long-suffering but we still know that they're wrong but knowing they're wrong and not having what it takes to help them doesn't help the situation god is looking for people who know how to help amen to remain in the love of god simon didn't want to lay down his life turn with me to verse 40 or continue on to verse 40 jesus answering jesus never blasted simon for his wrong but he still taught him in humility he's jesus answered he said unto him simon i have so much to say unto thee he saith master say on and he said a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 pence and the other 50. and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most what a lesson to learn here simon answered ice and said i suppose that he to whom he forgave him also and even in his judgmental spirit not being right he was able to discern that who was ever forgiven the most would love the most amen talking about abiding remaining in god's love and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he said to the woman and he turned to the woman and said unto simon see as thou this woman i've entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she has washed my feet with her tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head though gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time i came in have not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil thou does not anoint but this woman have anointed my feet with anointment in simon's mind and heart now he judge correctly the situation but jesus the word had assessed what was happening in simon's heart prior where he didn't judge the situation correctly the word will always correct the air always but i tell you we can all stand testify of this i'm so glad god corrected me in love we'd nev we'd not we ought to be here today none of us would be here today we would have gave up a long time ago if it wasn't god continuing to love us regardless now notice here that jesus the word judges simon for all the love that he did not manifest so now we come to church the word is here and the word is judging simon for all the love that he did not manifest though gave us me no water for my feet thou kissed me uh thou gavest me no kiss my head with oiled out dis not anoint oh my what are the things that are missing today in our lives where what have we missed on loving one another the things that simon never thought about i wonder why because he didn't maintain a humble spirit he had a judgmental spirit upon him there simply wasn't enough love in simon's heart to want to forgive amen to cover love covers a multitude of sin jesus tells us the reason why is that he himself had not received much forgiveness and this this this thought just blows my mind out of the water that simon was not able to love much because he wasn't forgiven much now wonder why simon wasn't forgiven much was simon so perfect that he didn't need much forgiveness or was it because he didn't think he needed much forgiveness you abide in the love of god through humility wherefore i say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little is forgiven the same loveth little now notice he never told simon he had little to forgive he just simply said to whom little is forgiven little loves i i think i want to spend more time asking god to forgive me to search for the things in my life and ask god to forgive me because if that becomes my clothing i feel that i'm going to fall more in love with him and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven and they that said it meet with him begin to sit with say within himself who is who is this that forgiveth sins also and he said to the woman thy faith have saved thee go in peace the more we can find to repent for the more we'll be forgiven and the more that we're forgiven the more that we'll love jesus christ the way up is down more humble it's not trying to be great to prove your love for god it's humbling yourself back humbling yourself back to god amen humbling yourself back to god find things in your life be zealous to repent think about those things the part of the problem is we don't like to think about all of our mistakes because they discourage us but to me what we're doing when we're doing that is we're interested we're showing god that we're interested in our relationship with him we're trying to build it now the prophet pulls out a golden nugget out of these scriptures here in god's gifts always find their places he said he said this woman she was so grateful that her sins were forgiven until she spent all her money that she had and she took an alabaster box and broke it and poured the oil and just odored the room with the fine smells of this myrrh and she anointed him for his death now she did this service not knowing what she was doing but she was so grateful to god think about that god doesn't always tell us what we're doing but something inside knows it's him she was so grateful brother branham says that her sins were forgiven until she spent all of her money that she had when we realize how much we've been forgiven we'll spend our life for god we'll pour it on jesus we'll pour it out for the kingdom i'm not trying to pull money but i'm pulling your life for jesus today when you keep your attitude humble don't forget what god has done for you and if you're having a hard time get alone in prayer spend time with him ask him to read to remind you start counting your blessings name them one by one it will surprise you what the lord have done before you know it an attitude of gratefulness will begin to swell up inside of you and when that gratefulness swells up and and it starts pouring out the love of god will just be coming out of you we're talking about remaining in love remaining in love if you forget first peter chapter 1 verse 8 through 10 you get a second you can write that down but if you forget the fruit of the spirit forget god living forget what god has done for you you can become barren and unfruitful the bible says so it's a calling peter says you got to give diligence to make your calling an election sure don't just say you're thankful manifest it manifest it well what do i do brother john be committed to manifest it be committed continue to be zealous about repentance in your life don't let it become a once in a day thing amen i'm like at the end of the day i'm just going to ask god to forgive me for everything i said god forgive me for everything get up and kind of go out and do your no on a regular basis lord i'm sorry for that thought that wasn't that wasn't a thought of humility that was a judgmental thought that i just had don't i don't want to be like simon i want to be like that woman who was just at the feet of jesus just loving on him because i've been forgiven so much we're talking about remaining in love with god abiding in his love through humility it's not far from us now i do have a few extra minutes today brother mark you're going to have to get going he's we gotta kick this man out of the church he's gonna go get our food you know i was talking to a minister the other day and just sharon had to deal with something that was inside the church that just wasn't right and finally had to get it out of the church and i just say we've been blessed in our little church here and not having to deal with a spirit that's trying to take over the church we're blessed we're blessed to have god the head of the church and to allow him to be the head of the church it was so sad to hear that keep yourselves in the love of god looking for what looking for the mercy of our lord jesus christ in other words god have mercy on me i'm not quite right i need to be ready lord i haven't dug you i didn't do your bidding like i should have i i'll tell you when i you know brother johnson he's up here and he's he's talking he's praying and sometimes there and he's he's in his frail body sharing that you know we just need to say a prayer that before we go to the store somewhere that we should pray god just just use me speak to me to speak to some soul i'll tell you i had that thought how many times have we tried to do something in our business and we had no concern about somebody's soul and that that that word that brother johnson spoke that was that's not brother johnson that was god that was god speaking amen he's pouring out his heart that we need to be about the father's business to remain in love with god because when you remain in love with god you just want to do his will when you lose that love you get out of that love you always you're thinking about your life that's all you think about is your life god help us want to share this last scripture with you second timothy chapter 4 verse 8 henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me in that day and not to me only but unto all them also that love his appearing now there are so many things to help us abiding in god's love to remain in god's love but if there's one thing that we could target it was the thing that we spoke today humility god dwells with with a person who's humble who's grateful who's thankful and we're if it be the will of god we want to get in to these things of gratefulness and thankfulness because there's there's so many nuggets uh have you just ever been so grateful you just you'll just do anything have you just been so bothered with all your problems you just didn't want to do anything to help anybody [Laughter] and uh lord help us to be close with humility so we can abide in his love is this your desire just your desire know that this is not a feel good service but if it deals with your relationship with god if it provokes you to good works if it helps you with the closeness with god well then i'm i'm grateful his will is is done amen let's stand together it was like last week i had two different people from two different direct nobody to do with church but they had said um brother john oh it's talking about brother john excuse me they weren't even brothers um they were family members is that what they were and they said john is the nicest person and i thought i don't care about being nice i want to i want to be close with humility i want it to be real because if it's real you'll automatically be nice it's because it's christ in you yes so let's just take a moment yield ourselves to the lord and if this is your desire to draw close to him and he you feel that he's calling you to to put some clothes of humility on to make sure that you're dressed with more of those and just yield to the lord make make that commitment to him because look this is not a force manipulative type of situation this is all about god making the invitation to his bride and it's uh it's up to us whether we want to step at it individually and if we don't well that's fine but perhaps for those that want to let's just take a few minutes before we have our fellowship with with one another we gotta wait for the food to come back anyways that's why we kicked brother mark house to go get the food amen let's sing um mercy rewrote my life [Music] [Music] i should have fallen my soul cast down but mercy reroll my life mercy rerolled my life mercy [Music] rerolled my life i should have fallen my soul passed down by percy my life think about god's mercy mercy rewrote my love god's mercy rerolled my love i should have fallen my soul cast down but mercy rerolled my love oh god's mercy rewrote my love mercy rerolled my love i should have fallen soul cast down but mercy re-roll my love humble yourself humble yourself
