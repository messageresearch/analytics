and thank you jesus christ and we pray amen so saint john chapter one what's up reverse 29 the next day john seeth jesus coming unto him saith behold the lamb of god which taketh away the sin of the world amen this is he of whom i said after me cometh a man which is preferred before me for he was before me and i knew him not but that he should be made manifest to israel therefore it might come baptizing with water and john bear record saying i saw the spirit descending from heaven like a dove and abold upon him and i knew him not but that he sent me to baptize with water the same said unto me upon whom thou shall see the spirit descending and remaining on him the same as he which baptizes with the holy ghost and i saw and bear record that this is the son of god you may be seated uh so the title of this little message is the lamb and the dove so before we get into it let's uh go into luke chapter 3 verse 21 and 22 same account that luke is talking about in john as well praise god amen so luke 3 chapter 20 or luke chapter 3 21-22 so it says now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that jesus also being baptized and praying the heaven was opened and the holy ghost ascending in a bodily shape like a dove upon him and a voice came from him and said thou are my beloved son and thee i am well pleased let's go to the chapter let's go to mark chapter one and we'll read two scriptures there nine and eleven i'd love to hear the the bible turning so mark chapter 1 verse 9-11 says and it came to pass in those days that jesus came from nazareth of galilee and was baptized of john and jordan and straightway coming out of the water he saw the heavens open in the spirit like a dove descending upon him there came a voice from heaven saying thou are my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and go to matthew chapter 3 and get right into it so matthew chapter 3 verses 13 or verses 13 through 17. so it says then come to jesus from galilee to jordan unto unto john to be baptized of him but john forbade him saying i have need to be baptized of thee and cometh out of me and jesus answering said unto him suffered to be so now for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness then he suffered him in jesus he was baptized and went straight away out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of god descending like a dove and lightning upon it and lo a voice from heaven saying this is my beloved son whom i am well pleased so if you notice in each account of that scripture the author uh mentioned is like a dove and we know jesus was the lamb of god so if you notice that a dove in the lamb that's the only two creatures or that can mix and i'm trying to say is we have a spirit and we have to make sure we have a lamb spirit constantly because jesus was the lamb of god and god was represented as a dove those only two that could mix they could only two that you connect together so we cannot get by with having a wolf-like spirit we got to make sure we have a lamb spirit daily that's the key right there and jesus gave us that perfect example he was a lamb he was led he always wanted to do what the father told him to do so a little quote to read but a lamb is so gentle that it can be led notice that and that's the reason that god represented christ as the lamb and himself as the dove and on that day that john baptized jesus at the river of jordan one of the greatest events that ever taken place taking place right there notice how beautiful the lamb the meekest of all the creatures of the earth and the dove the meekest of all the fowls of heaven and that's the only way they ever could be united is the only way the dove would ever come on the land now when the dove came down john saw jesus and said behold the lamb of god that taketh away the sins of the world and john said i bear record seeing the spirit of god like a dove coming down and abiding on him hallelujah there you are the dove and the lamb united together that's when god and man became one that's when heaven and earth embrace each other hallelujah that's when god was made flesh brought it that's when god came down from the spirit form and was made amen amen and dwelt among us that's when he all eternity embraced each other that's when the human fallen race of adam's people and jehovah god and every angel come together when god in man was made one and that great memorial day when john baptized jesus praise god so we're once again we're talking about lamb we've got to have a lamb-like spirit if you want to serve god to the fullness of the potential he wants you to you got to make sure daily that you have a lamb-like spirit and a lamb knows that has rights but is willing to lay down every right to be shared by the master shepherd that's what we that's the decision and question we come with each day we wake up every morning whether we want to do our will or god's will as it's no switzerland's no down the middle it's either god's will or your will and and god is looking for a full surrender believer to give him full control of his vessel now he's a he's a gentleman as it says in revelations 3 he's knocking at the door of each heart right now he is at the each heart right now he's waiting for you to open that door he's not going to blow the door open dynamite he's not going to kick it down but he's waiting for you to let him in he wants to have communion with you but you have to initiate that first draw nigh to god and he'll draw an eye to you that's a promise in the word that each one of us can have praise god now the lamb is a very gentle little fellow he doesn't he can't help himself he isn't self-reliant because he can't help himself here's some time ago i was going through a pastor when i used to patrol and i found a little lamb and all of them had gotten away from him somehow and he was all wound up a little bunch of barbed wire and the poor little fella was laying there and bleeding and i come by and and i seen way up about half a mile up was a whole herd of sheep now he laid right there and the crows would have been picking in his eyes pretty soon if we hadn't gotten him out but i wanted a little fellow up picked him up in my arms he never refused notice that he laid real quiet i picked him up in my arms first time perhaps a human being ever had their hands on him but he was gentle he was willing to be led and i noticed that that's what we had to be gentle we had to be willing to be led he was willing to be helped see god wants to help your current situation but you have to let them help you that's what he's waiting for amen he was willing to be led so he was not willing to try to resist or kick back or bite lambs a true lamb doesn't kick back he doesn't he doesn't complain he just lets the master shepherd work in his life so he humbled themselves that's the key we must humble ourselves under his mighty hand i picked him up packed him up and set him down the rest of the sheep in a few minutes his mammy found him how happy he was now typical that is of the lamb of god now jesus he lived a purposeful life he had a plan he had a purpose from the father and each one of us has that we're supposed to be disliked him in his example and with to make sure that we're have a purposeful life every day set goals aspirations these things we're going to get into a little bit later in the service so you want to turn me to john 10 and we'll read verses 1 through eighteen amen so reverse one verily verily i say unto you he that enterth in not by the door into the sheepfold but climeth up some other way the same as a thief and a robber but he that entereth in by the door is the shepherd of the sheep to him the porter openeth and the sheep hear his voice and he calleth his own sheep by name and leadeth them out and when he put forth his own sheep he goes before them and the sheep follow him for they know his voice now the thing is we got to know the voice of god for our life the same voice for sister trisha is not going to necessarily be the same voice for me it's a customized relationship god speaks to us in certain ways that he wouldn't speak to brother jonathan as he looked to me god speaks in different ways you have to make sure you get still so you can get tuned in to that holy ghost frequency so you can hear his voice that's what's going to lead you and guide you into knowledge he sent the holy spirit to what to lead you and guide you into all truth and there's certain things he can't say to you yet because you can't bear them yet so the thing is your walk with god is a progress it may be baby steps maybe large leaps at times but the thing is we got to make sure we're moving forward don't just be moving and moving make sure you're moving forward in the right direction ask god check your motive motive is so key with your walk with god because a lot of times we think we have a pure motive but in reality we have a mixed motive that's why david said search my heart and try me see there's anything wicked in me and that's just the honesty god loves honesty you can't hide anything from him there's nothing you can hide there's nothing that's you could hide under a rug or in a closet like like your room but the thing is the more open and eyes you can be that's when the lord can deal with your heart he wants to deal with your heart but you have to be honest with him in a stranger they would not follow but will flee for him for they know not the voice of a stranger so that's why it's so important to make sure you're hearing the voice of god this parable spake jesus unto them but they understood not what things were which he spake unto them then said jesus unto unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep so notice he he says in his word i am the way i am the door and there's only one way you can enter in and god's provided way is through jesus christ and if you don't enter in that way then you're a thief and a robber this is point blank like this like i'm not trying to be me but it's point blank like that you got to make sure you're entering in by the provided way his the blood that was shed on calvary made a way for you to have a personal intimate walk with him each one of you god is not respecter of persons you the thing is you have to realize and recognize that blood is was shed for you that he when he rose and resurrected that made it possible for the holy spirit to come back upon the believer amen praise god all that ever came before me are thieves and robbers but the sheep did not hear them i am the door he says i am the door by me if any man enter and he shall be saved so once again he's not a respecter of persons but you have to go you can't go through the cellar you can't go through the side door but you have to go through that that one and only door jesus christ he shall be saved so the thing is if you truly go through that door then you shall be saved but if you don't if you're questioning what door you're going through then you want to make sure every man has to with fear and trembling with their salvation so the thief cometh not but for to steal and to kill and to destroy i love this part right here i am come that they might have life they might have it more abundantly he wants to give you life tonight he wants to restore you from the inside out he wants to give you uh he wants you to serve him in the newness of the spirit so the thing is his mercies are new each day the thing is i think sometimes we get so caught up in a routine in a rut that we we miss the newness because because just jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever as jesus was speaking at this very time in this moment to the disciples and the fairies and sadducees he's still the same jesus christ only things different is 20 22. so god is still trying to speak to each one of us tonight but the thing is you have to want it more than life itself you have to get desperate to hear from them the thing is nobody no nobody should force you have to get desperate to hear from god you should want to get desperate to hear from god so he can use you because the more he can use you the more you're going to be able to help the kingdom of god grow the more you can reach lost souls because each one of us were once lost souls and god sent somebody your away and we it should be an honor privilege to be used to win a lost soul to the kingdom of god all one sinner repenteth all of heaven rejoices remember that says i am i'm gonna read again i am come that they might have life they might have it more abundantly i am the good shepherd he is the good shepherd giveth his life for the sheep he was willing to as brother alex preached on sunday he was homeless he was made homeless for you he literally left his place in heaven to come as a man to win you over he became you that you might become him so think about that he forsaken everything that he could win you that he could come and redeem you if he didn't do that we would you and i wouldn't be here today so i count that as that's what love is god is love that's what true love is even on the cross bearing all that grief and all that pain and all the sins of the world he said father forgive them they know not what they do that's true love human love can only go so far but that was the love of god in action right there amen but he that isn't heraling and not the shepherd whose own the sheep or not see it the wolf coming and leaveth the sheep and fleeth and wolf catches them and scattereth the sheep the heralding fleeth because he is a herling and careth not for the sheep he says i am the good shepherd and know my sheep and am known of mine so god knows your every weakness he knows your strengths he knows everything about you he knows you better than your wife does he knows you better than your best friend knows you he even knows the very numbers of the hairs on your head think about that just think about that i couldn't even imagine to begin what number of hairs i got on my head i couldn't even imagine as the father knoweth me even so i know the father and i lay down my life for the sheep and other sheep i have which are now this fold i love it we weren't all that full he came to get us to bring us into that fold because once again this god is it's a one-fold it's not many folds but it's one fold the body of christ this one body therefore does my father love me because i laid down my life that i might take it again no man taking it from me but i lay down of myself i have power to lay it down and i have power to take it again this commandment have received in my father notice each day we awake we have the choice to either to lay our life down or not to lay our life down we have that same choice right there and that's what god is looking at and seeing if you really mean business so on each day you have the choice to dial to your own will you have a choice to lay down your life to help the kingdom of god see if you lay down your will you have an opportunity to help the kingdom of god when the honor and privilege that is uh so let's go see the thing is to be about the father's business in luke 249 jesus speaking he says i love this he says luke 249 and he said unto them how is it that you sought me was he not that i must be about the father's business now jesus christ was always about the father's business he didn't make excuses when he was sick he didn't make excuses when he was paying he didn't make excuses when he was busy he always put the father first and we need to be putting god first daily in our lives not just uh at the first part in the morning but all throughout the day 24 hours a day yes i understand we we're busy when we have lives but the thing is if we put god first then everything is going to fall in place that's how that's how god set it up to be but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added to you so he knows you need money to pay the bills he knows you need health he knows you need a car he knows you need gas in your car money to pay the light bill he knows all these things so he said but seek ye first everything is going to be even a sparrow doesn't fall without him knowing think about that right i think so nothing's surprised let's go to matthew 6 actually what was into my notes but that's okay so go to matthew 6 and we'll start with verse 25 therefore i say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what you shall drink nor yet for your bodies what shall you put on it's not the life more than the meat and the body than remnant behold the fowls of the air for they so not neither they reap nor gather into barns yet your heavenly father feedeth them think about that are ye are you not much better than me which of you by taking thought can add one cupid unto his stature and why take ye thought for the remnant consider the lilies of the field how they grow they toil not neither do they spin and yet i say unto you that even solomon in all of his glory was not arrayed like one of these wherefore if god so clothed the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not so much more clothe you a little faith therefore take no thoughts saying what you shall eat always drink or that you shall be clothed for after all these things the gentiles seek for your heavenly father knoweth that you have need of all these things he knows it but seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself sufficient today is the evil thereof amen amen yeah get situated real quick notes praise god so the thing is each day you have a chance to have a victorious day no matter how hard the enemy is pressing on you no matter your blew a flat tire whatever it is you still have a chance of a victorious day only way you can have a victoria's day is to die out to your flesh that's the key right there even jesus told us before you even pick up your cross you have to deny yourself first see a lamb a lamb is always willing to die out always no matter the circumstance and to forfeit their rights to the good shepherd remember you have to make that choice no one can force you to make it you have to the thing is having a lamb spirit isn't something you just put on like a coat it's something that you have to strive for you to labor for because the thing is satan is trying to get you anyway to be a wolf he he any way he can get you not to have a lamb spirit he's one he's one over you but the thing is when we can have that lamb spirit i don't care what goliath is in your life you can conquer amen so each day you have a choice to be a lamb so think about that each day you have a choice to be in land if you want god to come and do mighty things and deal with the hearts and deliver us and heal us we have to have lamb spirits we have to what does a lamb do it submits itself to the shepherd and we must submit ourselves to the master shepherd daily jesus was always in unity with the father guess what he had to do he had to strive to keep a unity it wasn't something that just happened magically but something that he he's in prayer constantly he was looking to see what the father wanted him to do same thing that we have to do you've constantly be seeking and saying lord what direction you want me to go how can i be a light to this brother to the sister to the stranger i don't even know see we must do the same thing we have to fight to keep unity with jesus fight to keep the lamb spirit it won't be handed to you you must suffer by dying out to your own will that's the suffering we see things your carnal flesh does not want to serve jesus and if it does it wants to give the bare minimum at best but the thing is god's standards are up here and sometimes we hold our standards here with her realize he says my ways are not your ways my thoughts are not your thoughts so sometimes we think that we're always thinking like god but once again we gotta check and to see if we are because his word declares that his thoughts are not like our or his thoughts are not my thoughts so just in the previous this chapter is the quarterback we find one place there where the son of god spent so much time in prayer think about that the son of god spent so much time in prayer and if jesus had to spend much time in prayer to stay in fellowship with the spirit that was in him how much more do you and i have to spend in prayer if you only knew what time and prayer meant what sometimes when you're in prayer god changes the complete destination of different things are going to be one more time god changed the complete destination of different things that's going to happen do you believe that amen might be some fiction happening your prayer can change the whole situation i want to tell you the power of prayer a true sincere prayer offered to god is stronger than any atomic bomb think about that think about you have direct connection with the throne room of god praise god think about that when jesus christ died upon the cross he gave you that as a gift how much more you should be using that daily i think prayer is a weapon we don't utilize it's stronger than any atomic bomb any sword any uh smart bullet you name it it's stronger than anything praise god praise god so there's only one way to enter in and that's through jesus christ and that requires what a full submission daily submission to the word of god god is order one you can't separate in the beginning was the word words with god and the word was god so the word and god are one you can't separate the two you've got to have both because they're they're in unity god is his word the thing is how can we hear his voice if we see the thing is we get so busy in this world we get busy we have a job we have kids i don't have kids but but you know your kids and everything but the thing is the more we can get still we can hear his voice if you're moving a million miles an hour how can god ever speak to you he's always trying to speak but we have to get in that channel so we can hear him and god understands you have a busy schedule he understands you have children he understands you have a job but the thing is he still wants to be put first anything put before god is an idol it could be your car it could be your kid even jesus said i i came to he said i came to he he said i i came to bradford let me i'm trying to think of this anyways he said i came to bring separation pretty much and a man against his wife and you know brother and everything he knows that family can be put before him so he's trying to he's trying to put family in a proper place see it should be god family than you has a proper place if you put god before those things then they won't become an idol because it's so easy to put something before god it's really easy i've been guilty of i'm pretty sure we all been guilty of it in some time in some shape or form so thing is lambs lambs don't complain a true lamb doesn't complain think about this jesus submitted to the father he was a perfect example return to john 5 19. john 5 19 so it reads then answer jesus unto them verily verily i say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do whatsoever things he'd do with these also the son likewise see they didn't notice in the men's meeting uh that that scripture was brought up in the notes i didn't say anything but it just really shows you just how how god works on both ends such a beauty to see those little golden nuggets this you know in the men's meeting and you know just people mention it some other things that was said that i will get into it later in this little service so lambs don't make excuses see the thing is we get so caught up on making excuses well i couldn't do it because i couldn't give more time to prayer because i i god isn't looking at your excuses god doesn't want to hear excuses the thing is if you if you make that excuse learn from the excuse don't make it again say lord i'm giving you time no matter what if i have to lose sleep for it i'm giving you time lord if i have to cut something out i'm giving you time lord and that's what's going to touch the heart of god see the thing is it the obedience is better than sacrifice in a sense you see the thing is i think a lot of times when god is calling us to be obedient to something we try to make it up by doing things for sacrifice well i just get the church you know i'll just well i made it or oh i'm gonna do this instead to cover it up thing is don't try to cover things up when god is trying to see if god's calling you to do something you can't just try to cover it up with good deeds that's what i'm trying to say a lot of times we try to cover we try to cover things up with good deeds thinking that uh you know it'll make it go away but no if god has called you to do something be obedient to it the thing is sacrificing your time for god is always in order i believe i believe it's always an order for prayer to get the service early and to pray that's something we should be doing getting the service 30 minutes early and just just praying for the service praying for one another see the thing is the more we can get in tune in unity with god the more his spirit can move see thing is that's what god's looking for is to we got to strive to keep that unity once again it's not going to be handed to us something that we all have to strive one in each one of us is an individual affair we have to strive for that unity don't expect brother ron to bring it or brother jonathan to bring it but you be the person that bring it you bring the lord here you know you bring the lord to his house amen the thing is uh we must don't make excuse they just submit to the master shepherd they count counted an honor to suffer for the gospel amen they're willing to submit their rights no matter how fair they think it is see things we have rights in this world right we all have american privileges american rights but if those rights go against the word of god i don't want him i'll be straight up with you i don't want him lord share all my rights away in this world of sin let's go to philippians 2. philippians 2 and we'll start with verse one through eight amen praise god so philippians two verse one says there be therefore any consolation in christ if any comfort of love if any fellowship of the spirit if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be like minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind notice unity let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves edify one another look not every man and his own things but every man also in the things of others verse 5 is key right here let this mind be in you which is also in christ jesus see the thing is this mind isn't going to be gifted to you in a bow and a ribbon you have to strive and fight for it you have to strive for the mind of christ whatever see the thing is there's thoughts in your mind there throughout the course of the day devil's trying to speak to him god's gonna speak to you and you have to be able to try those spirits and see if they're of god of satan don't just let any old kind of thoughts go into your mind to think well that's god it might be god no the thing is if you have that kind of attitude you're going to have a devil's playground in your mind you have to take control of the things that go into your mind you have the choice whether you want to ponder or take that thought further than it has to go so the thing is your mind has to be set in order you have to make sure you're you're feeding on the right things you're thinking the right things so yeah attitude is so important when serving god it's so it's really so important and we got to make sure our mind is under control you want to make sure that that mind let this mind be in you which is also in christ in christ jesus who being in the form of god thought in that robbery to be equal to god but made himself of no reputation not even the very son of god was trying to make a reputation but who who are we to try to make a reputation the thing is god we're not gonna be like for every person and if we are i think even jesus said whoa onto them you know who who who pretty much are you know pretty much saying all these good things about you all the time so the thing is but made himself no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant that's the key right there we have to be we're we're called to be servants if jesus christ the very god of heaven was made a servant then who are we not to be servants like him he was willing to wash his disciples feet he was willing to wash feet and we have to be willing to wash feet i'm not saying we gotta you know go out just wash them around this person's feet but the thing is being a servant you see that person and realize that they need jesus christ and you might be the only person that can bring jesus christ to him even paul said we're living epistles that person may never read a bible it might be the only bible they ever read i count that in honor of privilege of the lord will when he used me for that and being us keep going but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself so we have to humble ourselves as well it became obedient unto death even the death of the cross i'm reading these scriptures and just show me that the lamb of god he was a lamb he was represented as a lamb for a reason and we have to make sure our life that we're lambs don't just think you're a lamb or assume you are but make sure that you're having that lame spirit daily let's go isaiah 53 verse 7. so it says he was oppressed and he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth he's brought as a lamb to the slaughter as a sheep before her shears is dumb so be opening out his mouth now notice when he was being judged by piloting them he never complained about the situation he never cried about it you know he was he was willing to be a lamb he knew that this was the perfect will of god so he was willing to do this for you and i if he didn't do that we couldn't be here today sitting in these nice seats this nice building it's all about his grace and mercy that we're even here today praise god let's go to romans chapter eight and go to verse 35 through 39. open pastor so it says who shall separate us from the love of christ who shall separate us from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or perel or sword and is written for thy sake we are killed all the day long we are counted as sheep for the slaughter remember we are sheep in this pasture nay in all these things we are more than conquerors through him that loved us from persuaded neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things that come nor height nor depth nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of god which is in christ jesus our lord so we should let nothing come between our walk with god the scriptures telling me not not height not depth principalities there's nothing that should come in your in your way of the walk with your god nothing because things were innate all these things were made more than conquerors through him that loved us that blood has made you an overcomer that blood was not shed you couldn't become an overcomer that blood wasn't shed we couldn't be cleansed of all our sins behold the lamb of god taken the sins the way of all the world so the thing is lambs are willing to lay down their life for their brothers and sisters no matter the no matter if they're humiliated no matter made fun of they're willing to lay their life down jesus christ he was humiliated he was spitting on he was hit in the head he was called beelzebub for your sake for my sake he didn't care what it took but he was willing he even counted that he knew what the cost would would be and he still wanted to do it that's love right there i want that kind of love in my life i want more of that love daily in my life just radiating out of me let's go to uh turn with me to first corinthians 6 19. so then also what lamb is willing to do is to lay their life down for a lost soul they realize that one lost soul was worth more than ten thousand worlds they realized their life isn't what they also realized their life is not their own i wasn't put on here to live my own life out here in the left field but the thing is when you realize that this life is to be lived for the master then you'll have a truth you'll be living life to the fullest people say oh this is living life to the fullest or this is living life to the fullest going out and partying and drinking and smoking all this stuff living life to the fullest is recognizing who your father is that's living life to fosters until then you're just wandering around aimlessly let me get there first corinthians 6 verse 19 through 20. what know ye not that your body is a temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and you are not your own read one more time what know ye not that your body is a temple of the holy ghost which is in you which he have of god and your ye are not your own for you are bought with a price remember that therefore glorify god in your body and in your spirit which are god's so this body god is loaning out to you he i guess he says he's written it out to you in a way and we're going to be responsible the things that we've done to this body and body in our spirit so the thing is the quicker like i said quicker we can realize that you are not your own we're bought with a price that's when the lord can do mighty things in your life he can change your nature he wants to change your nature he wants to give you peace he wants to give you joy he wants to give you all these things his promise in his word but you have to recognize that you have to give your life to him and he'll even bless you if you're not serving them he blesses the just and unjust but i don't want i don't just want uh material blessings i want spiritual blessings i want my nature to change i want to be made more into his image i want to go through these trials they're going to shape me and mold me so he can see more of himself in me that's what i want in my life because the more we can suffer for the kingdom's sake we have an opportunity to win a soul so count it a joy to suffer glory in your infirmities glory in your tribulations like paul said because i remember paul or jesus said to paul my grace is sufficient remember that his grace is sufficient don't forget that let's go to first corinthians 15 31. so it says i protest by your rejoicings which i have in christ jesus our lord i die daily so paul was paul even said i die daily and we consider paul a a patriarch and he had to still die daily so where are we at so and if you want to be a christian you've got to be a lamb and if you're going to be a lamb you've got to get away from your own thoughts just let the holy spirit do the leading read one more time and if you want to be a christian you've got to be a lamb if you're going to be a lamb you've got to get away from your own thoughts just let the holy spirit do the leading certainly i think the problem is we like to mix our own thinking of what we think a lamb is and jesus taught us what a true lamb does thing is you can't mix your thoughts and god's thoughts together the word and your thoughts don't mix the word is when you do that you make the word uh you hinder the word you make the word lie see the word is unadulterated it's pure it's holy it's perfect no no no word will turn void it can't because it's the word of god god and his word are one like we said before the thing is don't try to mix don't try to pick and choose what scriptures best fit you or what you don't like i don't like but just take all the word rake it all in say lord i may not understand this but i believe with all my heart that that attitude right there will touch the heart of god than trying to pick and choose what you think fits with it this and that so what we need today is to submit all our rights to let go let lay let go lay down and let god shave all your rights off you amen could you imagine how this little lamb all the fleece hang over him that's his rights yeah burned up and they just lay up the sharing table they know what's best for him take all of his rights away him and sheer all off how cool and light he runs my my he's happy jumps around has a big time yes sir if you'll forfeit your rights that's what you'll get but you gotta forfeit your rights and let the word of god shave all the word off of you take all the habits of the world and you become a new creature in christ you got to let the word of god shave all your rights away all your rights shave everything away you know when moses when moses was trying to deliver the children of israel he thought he could do it his way but it took 40 years for god to beat out him to shave all the world out of all the egyptian intellects and five minutes in the presence of god did all did way more than he had four years of teaching let's think about that five minutes in the presence of god if we can spend five minutes in the presence of god it'll do more than all the news you can watch all the history you can learn all the you know you fill in the blank what you can learn just five minutes can transform you more than 40 years of school teaching just think about that amen thing is don't just say well i'll lose these bad habits someday no this is the day say today is a day for deliverance say lord i'm serious about overcoming this habit say lord you're still a deliverer think about this when he died upon a cross and rose again for your deliverance for your healing for your salvation all those things all those things in one package think one package deal say be serious about overcoming this habit say lord your deliver in hebrews 13 8 it says jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever he's the same god he's the same guy that gave you deliverance ten years ago five years ago he's the same god that picks you about their murray clay and set your feet in a rock to the state he's the same powerful god jesus christ said all power is given to me in heaven and in earth so there's no goliath that should be staying in your land like we preached last time there's no giant that should be causing you to cower like saul and then when they were cowering david was willing to take the word of god take his sling and knew that the same guy delivered him off the mouth of the lion and the bear he delivered him out this uncircumcised philistine don't let any uncircumcised philistine dwell in the land that god is giving you don't be like the the other 10 spies and say oh we're grasshoppers no you're you're a son and daughter of god he's giving you authority thing is if you want deliverance in your life say be serious about it show the lord that you mean business that's what a lamb does say lord i am taking that your word i am your lamb share all my rights away shave me clean from this world say lord today is the day for my deliverance say lord please give me the strength to break this stronghold of the enemy the more we can surrender our will fully to the lord and submit like a lamb the more god's spirit can transform your life all things must become new in your life daily don't settle for nothing less than that then we can transform your life he can use you to win souls see thing is always talking about it takes discipline if he knows the word disciple has the word discipline in it you'd be yet to discipline yourself daily you can't you can't wait for brother ron to come help you discipline yourself but you it's an individual affair this was straight and narrow it's only room between you and god not you god and the pastor you can't write off the pastors coattails you can't run out brother jonathan's coattails you have to have a personal walk with him yourself that's the only that's the only way so take discipline is the key it's not going to be given to you on a silver platter you have to work at it to make sure you're manifesting a lamb spirit daily humility is so key with your walk with god humility is the key to keeping that lamb spirit let's go to galatians 6. how we doing on time pretty good pretty good praise god so we'll go with galatians 6 7-9 be not deceived god is not mocked for whatsoever in man soweth that shall he reap also for he that sowed to his flesh shall of his flesh reap corruption but he that soul to the spirit shall the spirit reap life everlasting and let us not be wearing and well doing for if in due season we shall reap if we fight not so if you're putting the bare minimum little into your walk with god you're going to get what you sow if you're willing to put everything you got into the in your walk with god you're going to reap a lot it's like with anything at your job if you're just putting in the bare minimum at your job you're going to get the bare minimum so the thing is hold yourself accountable hold yourself to higher standards than what the world and society is trying to hold you to see society isn't going to help you get your work closer you'll walk closer with a guy only person to get your walk closer with god is you kicking yourself out the way your biggest enemy is not me it's not it's not the devil necessarily but it's yourself you're gonna be a reason why god can't move in your life and you have to realize that you have to crucify this old man because it likes to rile up it likes to come up and distract you likes to get you all your time engulfed but the thing is the more you can realize that your biggest enemy is yourself then you can have a victorious life but the thing is just knowing it is not going to help you you have to be willing to put it to action daily don't just be a hearer of the word but a doer as the scripture says so read a couple quotes from denzel washington that i thought really just fed with this with this uh service without commitment you'll never start but more importantly without consistency you'll never finish so the thing is you have to be committed to your lord and savior but more importantly you have to be consistent don't just be committed to them on wednesdays and wednesday nights and sunday mornings not just fridays not just easter service but every day seven days a week 24 hours a day you have to have consistency don't be up and down like a roller coaster be consistent with your walk with god daily found nothing in this life is worthwhile unless you take risks you'll be willing to take risks you'd be willing to be uncomfortable see the thing is the disciples when they uh when they met jesus that first time when they cast that net and all the fish came and they were willing think about it they were willing to let go of everything they took a risk that was their livelihood that's all they knew was fishing that's what their dad did that's probably what their dad's dad's dad dads did and that's all they did but they were willing to take that risk they were willing to jump up by blind faith he said i'll make you fishers of men he must make each one of you fishers of men we're here to fish after all souls that's the key just keeps going there is no passion to be found playing small ball and selling for a life that's less than the one you're capable of living there is no passion to be found playing small ball and selling for a life that's less than the one capable of living it's nelson mandela think about that god has called us to such trump's god is calling us we're sons and daughters of god he's giving you authority he's giving you you can create peace in a situation you can create joy happiness the thing is he's called us to reconcile another soul but the thing is we live so below our calling and god didn't intend for you to do that when it says lay the hands on the sick and shall recover they shall recover god have faith to believe that the same holy spirit that was in the book of acts is the same holy spirit that's here tonight speaking to the hearts the same holy spirit that's changed your nature into what it is now and still changing it he's no different so he's gonna do the same works they did in the book of acts right now he should be doing the same works so ease is the greater threat to progress and hardship think about that ease is a greater threat to progress and hardship without commitment you'll never start but more importantly without consistency you'll never finish so the thing is hardship actually helps you to get desperate because you're in a hard trial when jonah was in that welly's bell if i said that right that that whale's belly let me say that right he was he was desperate he realized remember he turned that temple and he remember what solomon said but the thing is when everything's all good and all easy and you know i'm relaxing in zion it's easy to kind of relax off your prayer life i'll pray every day but it'll just be the bare minimum i'll read but it'll be the bare minimum but the thing is the more we can get desperate always be desperate for god always in the good times and the bad times in the valley and the mountaintop then you will never get ease it's so easy that this laodicean spirit it says in revelations 3 they're lukewarm thing is you don't want to have a form of godliness you want to you want to have the real thing make sure you're the real thing daily don't don't take any substitutes guys and looking for you take a substance to take that real thing be be hot for god be on fire for god be like a forest fire it's hard to put that thing out then to think that day we're living in is that so many people cut off that privilege this is from 1957 sirs we would see jesus i think the the day we were living in so many people cut off that privilege from the people why we're living millions of miles below our god-given privilege the church of god should never be divided we should be one and together we should never live under our privilege as we are today the great powers of god lays within the reach of every member of the body of christ the great powers of god lays within the reach of every member of the body of christ whatever things you desire when you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have it it shall be given to you now think about that just about where our churches are getting we're the children of god but we're losing our inheritance by our conduct the things that we do the things that we permit to be done we let the bars down you know what happens that's when the goats come in we can't let the bar there was things that we wouldn't do 15 years ago that we're doing now today we have to keep those bars up we have to set a standard in a world full of dropping the standards dropping the morals let us hold high those morals let us hold high though the conducts of the word of god let us let us be oddballs we're oddballs in this world we're not here to fit in with the world we're not here to act like a world we're here to live in the world yes but we're here not to be like the world jesus jesus didn't come to be like the word he can't he was different he knew that his king he was a heavenly kingdom and we have to recognize that we're not of this world we're from a heavenly kingdom and we have to hold ourselves with the standards of the word of god that's the blueprint right there this word is a blueprint and uh we're living millions of miles below our privilege and then someone can say the work of god being done dr so-and-so and dr jones say it's all the other doctors say this and that and we believe instead of looking into the word the word verifies what's the sheet food it comes out of the word now it's funny actually uh so reggie jackson you might he's a baseball player he struck out 2600 times the most in the history of baseball but you don't hear about the strikeouts you were people remember the home runs it's funny because uh brother ferguson mentioned thomas edison and i i just i just laughed and i'm like man i was gonna mention this so it's thomas edison conducted 1 000 failed experiments think about that do you know because the i didn't know that but did you know the thousand one was the light bulb every failed experiment is one step closer to success you've got to take risks don't be scared to take risks you're going to make mistakes in your walk with god you are i'm sorry you are you're human but thing is learn and grow from those mistakes don't be scared to to try new things you never tried before and witnessing don't don't be scared don't don't let those failures uh deter you you learn and grow from those things the thing is you've got to take risks you've also got to take risks i'm sure you probably heard that before first you will fail at some point in your life except is denzel washington speaking you will lose you will embarrass yourself you will suck at something there is no doubt about it but here's the thing this is him talking about his acting i didn't quit i didn't fall back i walked out there for prepare for the next audition the next audition the next audition i prayed i prayed and i prayed but i continued to fail and fail and fail but it didn't matter because you know what so you'll catch a break and i did catch a break so the thing is i'm trying to get what you guys say is you're gonna it may seem like you're getting no ground no ground you keep pressing forward you keep marching forward in that in the word that's promised to you you keep praying with all your heart the thing is god is going to move in a situation it may not be the right time yet see god's timing is perfect so just realize it says they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength they shall come up with wings as he goes they shall run and not be where they shall walk and not faint now notice there's no time limit when it says they that wait upon the lord it says they that wait upon the lord so he'll give you that strength in due time when you need right when you need it see god is a god of perfect timing not on your timing and the reason why it's the thing is if you pray as soon as you pray for everything he gave it to you every every second you pray for it you'll be what a spoil you turn into a spoiled brat eventually and god is an ant see it's a reason why he's doing certain when you're first christian you give your heart to lord he answers things right away sometimes like that but the thing is he's trying to shape you and mold you he's trying to he's trying to teach you even from him you make mistakes he wants you to learn from he's trying to teach you the thing is when you make a mistake don't dislike oh oh it's me but learn from it like analyze what you could have done better or what you shouldn't have done analyze it take the time to to not make that same mistake because sometimes we make the same mistake over and over and over and over again because we're not looking the steps that we did from the last time the previous time let's keep going everyone here today has the training and the talent to succeed can i get amen on that but do you have the guts to fail if you don't fail you're not even trying i'll say it again if you don't fail you're not even trying he said my wife told me this great expression to get something you never had you have to do something you never did one more time to get something you never had you have to do something you never did to lose a battle is not to lose a war patton lost several battles but he never lost the war that's right and we'll lose lots of battles too but would not lose the war i'll make mistakes but i won't lose the cause god gave it to me god will take care of it that's from 1960 i know this uh this quote that kind of hit home i just so imagine on your deathbed and standing around your deathbed are the ghosts representing your unfulfilled potential the ghost of ideas you never acted on the ghost of talents you didn't use they're standing at you around your bed angry disappointed and upset they say we came to you because you you could have brought us to life they say and now we have to go to the grave together so i ask you today how many ghosts are going to be around your deathbed when your time comes so the thing is there's there's talents in each one of your lives that i don't know about but you know about and the question is are you using them for the kingdom of god are you scared to use them don't be scared there's brother roger he's playing the guitar now he's giving that talent back to the lord and that's a beautiful thing the thing is there's talent there might be a talent to even know about yet but the thing is use what god has given you for his kingdom's sake see when jesus earthly ministry and his corporate body was coming to an end but he still had more work to do but he couldn't do it at that point in time because you weren't here i wasn't here yet but the thing was he could say in john 17 4. go to john 17 4 with me i have glorified thee on earth i have finished the work which thou gavest me to do think about that so when his earthly ministry was done at that point all he was had to do at that point are the things that the lord has asked you to do have you been putting them off don't let your earthly journey when it comes to an end be filled with a grip regret is something you can never go back and redo so if god's telling you to do something right now you do it don't hesitate don't i'ma put off tomorrow because tomorrow's never promised how many people said that lord i'm gonna do this tomorrow and tomorrow never came for him just because you're young middle-aged doesn't mean anything death doesn't care about age i could walk out here and get hit by a car and i tried you know trying to solve sobering but it's the truth it could happen i could die of a heart attack tomorrow so don't try to put something off that you can do right now see the world needs christ we need to invest all we have put it into the kingdom of god invest your time your talents your money your life this world is dying and need you to be fully surrendered so jesus can use you to win those last souls the time is urgent it's high in time to wake out of your slumber fenton needs you graham blank needs you linden flint auburn hills utica sterling heights bloomfield pontiac they all need you they need us so you got to get out there you got to give it everything you got whether it's your time your talents your prayers or your treasures because remember this you'll never see a u-haul behind a hearse i never forget when denzel washington said that you'll never see a u-haul behind a hearse the egyptians tried it they got grave robbed they thought they could take it with them but they got grave robbed so the thing is so the question is what are you going to do with what you have i'm not talking about how much you have whatever your gift is what are you going to do with what you have what are you going to do what god is giving you he's giving you time he's giving you money whatever he's giving you what are you going to do with it don't just do it because my brother mark said it but you do it because you want to please god that should be the root reason why you're here tonight is that but i see you today and i'm encouraged by what i see i'm strengthened by what i see i love what i see this is denzel washington speaking of the event and i feel the same way i love what i'm glad i'm glad you guys are here i love to see you guys here pressing in there there's still work to do for us we have to work together as a body we have to build one another to edify one another we gotta make sure we're building iron sharpens iron here's my last point on failure sometimes it's the best way to figure out where you're going think about that sometimes it's the best way to figure out where you're going so my brother and my sister i want us to look at this in the spirit god has called us to win souls no matter if you witness to a thousand people and they reject you and the thousand and one person expect and accepts it i tell you that soul was worth all the labor all the tears all the rejection all the time spent he has called us to win souls we'll close here in a couple more first corinthians 9 22. have like seven more minutes all right you know what a preacher says that usually uh it's more than seven minutes all right so it says to the week became my as week that i might gain the week so once again you're trying to lift that person up you're trying to show that the person in value i'll listen to this uh this individual i can't remember his name sister ann sent it to me and he's like these five steps he had i can't remember all the five steps but pretty much his thing was when you when you're waking up and going out to the world your vision should be to help somebody help to build somebody help to show that person he has value or that woman she has value and that's what a true servant does they're willing to edify that's why paul said to the week became i as the week that i gained the weak i made all things that i might by all means save some you're not going to save every single person in this world but i rather die trying to to save at least one at least one so we all know that abraham fell in his life right we know that but when people talk about them i don't hear about they talk about the failures not even god mentioned the failures you know it will go to in the book of hebrews he we'll go to the book of hebrews hebrews 11. we'll just read a couple scriptures there and then we'll go to romans so it says by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should have to receive for inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he saw adjourned in the land of promises in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles isaac and jacob and heirs with the same promise if you look for a city at foundations builder makers guys let's go to romans chapter 4 19. let's read that real quick so the thing is we see in abraham's life we read in the old testament did he fail did he have failures he did but he didn't let that shaper define his walk with god see the thing is and we can we do the same thing he's the father of our faith you know we're as children but i promise and we're going to make mistakes too we're going to fail too but don't let your failures define you negatively let them positively affect you grow from you can help help another brother or sister not make that same mistake let's go romans 4 19 and be not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of sarah's womb he staggered nuts at the promise of god through unbelief but we're strong in faith giving glory to god i notice in this scripture right here god doesn't say he he lied twice or he did this or that but he said he staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief that's what it says in faith giving glory to god he and being fully persuaded you have to be fully persuaded not part way not 98 not 99 but 100 persuaded you have to be if you want god to help your situation you have to be fully persuaded that he can change situation that's what faith is he's rewarded of them that diligently seek him able to perform and therefore is imputed to him for righteousness now it's not written for his sake alone that was imputed to him but for us also to whom shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up christ lord jesus from the dead who was liberated from our offenses and raised again for our justification sorry i'm going a little fast so let's keep going we'll go to after this we'll go to proverbs 24 16 just keep your place there for your walk with god it's not going to be flawless you're going to make mistakes but the key is to learn and grow from them for him for a just man falls seven times and rises up again but the wicked shall fall on the mission so if you fall get back up don't stay down get back up we're gonna ask ourselves to remind ourselves what was the holy ghost given for the purpose of the holy ghost is the father again the father dwelling in you working out his plans to finish his plan of redemption working through you to make you a co-worker with him giving you a place to give you a part for your fallen lost brother and sister giving you his spirit and his love to go hunt the lost as he did in the garden of eden adam adam we're out there that's the holy spirit does to a man or woman when he strikes into the heart takes a bold thirst there's a thirst and a hungering for lost souls now i thought of how the how the how god the dove is such a loving bird and the dove of god wanting to make love with his human beings god wants to be loved god wants to love you god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believed in him should not perish but have everlasting life blessed be the lord the god wanting to make love he had to some something something lovable he had to make something gentle like himself he'd take his something that could be loved he had to make something of his own nature let's keep going i'm gonna skip a couple couple things all right our attitude is so important a bad attitude will affect your growth a walk your walk with the lord it will hinder you from keeping that lamb spirit it also hinders you from helping someone god will wait in that telephone wire until you drop that bad attitude a bad attitude will cloud your judgment and influence your decisions it will cause you to entertain negative thoughts about others it will hinder your faith so these three three things i want us to close on something denzel washington was like he was the first thing he said in the speech he said put god first i love that he said in everything you do he said you think you see in everything that i've accomplished everything you think i have i have a few things everything that i have is by the grace of god so remembering where all the things that you have come from don't forget where you came from don't forget what he's blessed you with and what he's still blessing you with don't forget that that's what that's how you stay humble if you have the attitude of gratitude that helps you to stay humble everything i have by grace understand that is a gift i've been protected i've been directed and i've been corrected he's i've kept god in my life and has kept me humble so stick with god in everything you do stick with that's the first thing so put god first in everything you do number two fail big don't be afraid to fail don't be afraid to think outside the box don't be afraid to fail b to dream big but remember dreams without goals are just dreams the ultimate feel disappointment so have dreams but have goals have life goals so i actually implemented this in my life i started last week i made daily goals monthly goals yearly goals and weekly goals and some of my daily goals the first one is put god first be still more the other one is to pray for greater sensitivity to recognize him in all aspects of my life all aspects not just up here while i'm preaching but in my at work in my car at home and uh some other ones i put uh not to murmur and complain because then flipping says do all things about murmurs and disputing something so easy for it says do all things without murmurings and disputing the scripture tells us so that's something i'm trying to work on also to really take control of the thoughts that i'm thinking to really ask myself is that thought i just thought is it is it helping me or is it hindering me see thing is you have to challenge yourself you'd be willing to put yourself in that chopping block and look in the mirror of the word and challenge yourself to see if you're really lining up with it don't just assume and i got another goal one of my yearly goals is to pay my credit card debt off by next year of december of april 2023. thing is you can't just put these goals we had to put action steps between them you got to make sure that check each day for your daily goals i'm going to challenge you guys make some day make five daily goals make five of them and make sure you're hit if you're not hitting the goals ask yourself why and then the next day you do your best to hit that goal strive to hit that goal don't just be satisfied with failure but learn from that failure and girlfriend as we said so see i try to give myself a goal every day understand to achieve these goals you must apply what discipline that's the key if one hit these goals discipline yourself inconsistency in order to achieve your goals you must apply discipline and consistency every day you have to work at it every day you have a plan every day you have heard we don't fail to plan we we don't plan to fail but we fail to plan that's the key we don't plan we just kind of see things we just kind of just oh well the day's going to go how it's going to go the thing is make a plan don't just walk around life aimlessly what a true leader does he he leads others he makes a plan he follows it problems don't surprise him he can take any problem on by the bull with the horns it's not him but it's the god god in him handling those problems that's the key right there if you want to be a leader and one last thing i'll close and we can we can stand so hard work really works hard that's what success people do just remember just because you're doing a lot more does not mean you're getting a lot more done just because you're doing a lot more does not mean you're getting a lot more done remember that just because you're doing a lot more i could be running in place and i'm not getting a lot done i'm not moving anywhere i'm just i'm moving but i'm not going anywhere so the thing is
