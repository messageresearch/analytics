[0:09] At last and did my Savior bleed, and did
[0:16] my sovereign die.
[0:20] Could he devote that sacred head for
[0:25] such a worm as I?
[0:30] At the cross, at the cross where I first
[0:34] saw the light and the burden of my heart
[0:38] rolled away. Hallelujah.
[0:40] It was there by faith I received my
[0:45] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[0:51] For if for crimes that I have done, he
[0:56] grown up on the tree.
[1:01] Amazing
[1:03] pity, grace unknown, and love beyond a
[1:09] degree.
[1:11] The cross at the cross where I first saw
[1:15] the light and the burden on my heart
[1:19] rolled away.
[1:21] It was there by faith. I receive my
[1:26] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[1:32] Well might the son in darkness hide and
[1:37] shut his glories in.
[1:42] When Christ the mighty maker died for
[1:47] man the creature sin.
[1:52] At the cross at the cross where I first
[1:56] saw the light and the burden of my heart
[2:00] rolled away. Hallelujah. It was there by
[2:04] faith I received my sight and now I am
[2:09] happy all the day.
[2:13] But drops of grief can naray
[2:18] the debt of love I owe.
[2:23] Here Lord I give myself
[2:27] away. is all that I can do. Just give
[2:32] yourself away. The cross at the cross
[2:36] where I first saw the light and the
[2:39] burden of my heart rolled away.
[2:43] It was there by faith. I received my
[2:48] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[2:53] At the cross. At the cross where I first
[2:57] saw the light and the burden of my heart
[3:01] rolled away.
[3:04] It was there by faith I received my
[3:08] sight. And now I am happy all the day.
[3:14] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. It
[3:18] was there by faith.
[3:20] Amen. But it's still by faith.
[3:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So if you got faith to believe for
[3:25] tonight,
[3:26] he's got something for you.
[3:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Bring them in. Amen.
[3:35] Heart is a shepherd's voice I hear
[3:41] out in the desert, dark and dre,
[3:46] calling the sheep who've gone astray.
[3:51] far from the shepherds fold away.
[3:56] Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them
[4:02] in from the fields of sin. Bring them
[4:07] in. Bring them in. Bring the wandering
[4:13] ones to Jesus.
[4:17] Oh, go and help the shepherd kind.
[4:21] Helping the wondering ones to find. Oh,
[4:27] bring the lost ones to the fold where
[4:32] there be shelter from the cold. Bring
[4:37] them in. Bring them in. Bring them in
[4:43] from a field of sin. Bring them in.
[4:48] Bring them in. Bring thou wondering ones
[4:53] to Jesus.
[4:56] Out in the desert, hear their cry. Out
[5:01] on the mountains, wild and high. Heart
[5:06] is a snacker. Speak to thee. Go find my
[5:12] sheep where they may be.
[5:15] Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring them
[5:22] in from the fields of sin. Bring them
[5:26] in. Bring them in. Bring the wandering
[5:32] ones to Jesus.

[8:05] Creation. Amen.
[8:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[9:38] Shackled by a heavy
[9:42] burden
[9:46] neath the load of guilt and shame.

[9:54] Then the hand of Jesus
[9:58] touched me

[21:18] Hallelujah. Well, let's just uh we're

[21:22] little. Brother Jonathan, can you lead
[21:24] us in tithes and offerings? Amen.
[21:57] Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Brother
[21:59] John, you want to come up?
[22:04] So good to be in the house of the Lord.
[22:08] &gt;&gt; That you brought your sacrifice of
[22:09] praise.
[22:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we can we can help the
[22:15] ministry as the brother comes forth. I
[22:19] believe there's something for every one
[22:20] of us.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; Uh we all may be going through different
[22:25] things and have different trials and
[22:27] have different questions.
[22:30] Um, but I believe the Lord uh has
[22:33] something for us to help us with what we
[22:37] have need of.
[22:39] &gt;&gt; And I also believe that God has
[22:41] something for us that we're not asking.
[22:44] &gt;&gt; It's what that's on his mind.
[22:46] &gt;&gt; And uh so we want to just be prepared.
[22:50] Let's stand and sing that that little
[22:52] course. Um Lord, prepare me to be a
[22:56] sanctuary. As brother Aaron comes, we
[22:58] just appreciate Brother Aaron in many
[23:01] different ways and for many different
[23:03] things. He's such a precious, precious
[23:06] brother.
[23:09] Lord, prepare
[23:11] me
[23:13] to be a sanctuary,
[23:16] [Applause]
[23:16] [Music]
[23:19] pure and holy,
[23:24] tried and true
[23:28] with thanksgiving.
[23:32] I'll be a living
[23:38] sanctuary
[23:42] for you.
[23:47] Lord, prepare
[23:49] me.
[24:05] With thanksgiving,
[24:09] I'll be a living
[24:14] sanctuary
[24:19] for you. Sing it again.
[24:22] Oh Lord, prepare
[24:26] me
[24:28] a sanctuary,
[24:33] pure and holy,
[24:37] light and true.
[24:42] With thanksgiving,
[24:46] I'll be a living
[24:51] Amen.
[25:01] Praise the Lord. Wonderful. If you could
[25:03] just take your Bibles. We'll be reading
[25:05] from Matthew chapter 5. Just a few
[25:07] verses there.
[25:09] It's wonderful to be in the house of the
[25:11] Lord again.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; I hope that this week I look more tanned
[25:16] and rested than I did last Wednesday as
[25:19] we enjoyed this past Sunday off.
[25:21] and really enjoyed the service on
[25:24] Sunday. Really love the fellowship here
[25:26] and everyone. It just always feels like
[25:28] home when we come here and so it's nice
[25:29] just to set participate in service with
[25:32] you join Gideon's ministry and on a
[25:35] Wednesday night it's nice to see all the
[25:37] people are here on Sunday back on a
[25:38] Wednesday night. I think that speaks
[25:41] well of the church when you have a core
[25:42] that's always there always faithful. Uh
[25:45] some churches that are much larger than
[25:47] this one have smaller crowds than this
[25:49] even on a Wednesday night. So, I think
[25:50] it's a real testimony to your love of
[25:52] the Lord. I'm sure you've heard it
[25:53] before. I've probably mentioned it
[25:55] before that if you come on to church on
[25:57] Sunday morning, you love um you love
[26:00] church. If you come on Sunday evening,
[26:01] you love the pastor. If you come on
[26:03] Wednesday night, you love the word.
[26:06] &gt;&gt; Kind of self- serving on a Wednesday
[26:08] night. And so, I joke that that's why we
[26:10] don't have a Sunday evening service at
[26:12] our church.
[26:15] But we love you. We're going to be
[26:16] leaving tomorrow to go back to Arizona.
[26:18] And just been a real privilege to be
[26:20] here. We'll be praying for all of you,
[26:21] especially sister Cheryl and her dad and
[26:23] brother John as he's going to be driving
[26:25] up too. And I think Ann's already gone
[26:27] up to see their grandpa. So let's just
[26:29] remember them in prayer that God would
[26:30] be merciful. Matthew chapter 5 verse 14
[26:34] to verse 16. You are the light of the
[26:38] world. A city that is set on the hill
[26:41] cannot be hidden. Neither do men light a
[26:44] candle and put under a bushel, but on a
[26:46] candlestick, and it giveth light unto
[26:48] all that are in the house. Let your
[26:50] light so shine before men, that they may
[26:53] see your good works and glorify your
[26:55] father which is in heaven.
[26:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. If
[26:58] &gt;&gt; we could bow our heads in prayer.
[27:00] Heavenly Father, as we have read this
[27:02] word, we believe it to be eternal. We
[27:04] believe that in each one of these
[27:05] verses, there is a mystery of Christ to
[27:07] be revealed to us, for us to see.
[27:10] And also Lord, not just you only, but
[27:13] see ourselves as looking into a mirror.
[27:15] For we are a part of that word. We are
[27:17] part of the body of Christ. So speak to
[27:19] us today by revelation. That's in a
[27:21] manner that only you can. So we submit
[27:23] ourselves to you and this service to
[27:24] you. We ask that you take control of it
[27:25] for your glory. In the name of Lord
[27:27] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; You can be seated.
[27:32] My title is the gospel according to the
[27:35] bride
[27:37] part two.
[27:39] And so I hope that brother Gideon if he
[27:41] finds out about this doesn't take
[27:43] offense. They say uh mimic or imitation
[27:47] is this most sincere form of flattery or
[27:49] the highest form of flattery. And so I'm
[27:51] not going to try to repreach it but so
[27:53] inspired by it and blessed by it. I
[27:55] thought well I can't think of a better
[27:56] title for what I want to minister. Felt
[27:58] led to minister tonight other than the
[28:00] gospel according to the bride part two.
[28:02] So brother Giddy and I just preach in a
[28:04] little mini meeting together a
[28:05] miniseries. you want to look at your
[28:08] text and trust that you could just stay
[28:10] focused. I think most of you here are
[28:11] familiar with the way that I minister
[28:13] and so uh maybe it could be laborious
[28:16] but just uh if you just pay attention I
[28:18] believe it'll be a blessing to you.
[28:20] Matthew chapter 5 we'll just start again
[28:21] with verse 14. It says ye are the light
[28:24] of the world. So the bride is the Lord's
[28:28] light. So there speaks of you are the
[28:30] light that's a brightness that's a lamp.
[28:32] You are an emitter of light. So you give
[28:35] light. That's what you are. You're one
[28:37] that shines. And so light here, it
[28:39] speaks of truth and knowledge. And it
[28:41] even symbolizes uh moral and spiritual
[28:44] truth, moral purity. And that's what uh
[28:47] you represent. You represent light. You
[28:50] are to be light. And then it says a city
[28:52] that is set on a hill cannot be hid. So
[28:54] if you're light, now Jesus begins to
[28:56] expand upon. Now if you're light, what
[28:58] are we going to do with that light? Says
[28:59] a city that is set on a hill cannot be
[29:01] hid. Neither do men light a candle and
[29:03] put it under a bushel, but on a
[29:05] candlestick, and it giveth light unto
[29:07] all that are in the house. So you must
[29:10] be put uh be you must be in plain view
[29:14] publicly.
[29:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:16] &gt;&gt; That if you are the light of the world,
[29:17] if the bride is the light of the world,
[29:20] then you must be in view publicly.
[29:22] That's why anything that tries to get
[29:24] too cultish or too clanish, try to hide
[29:26] itself from view, hide itself from the
[29:28] public, withdraw itself from being
[29:30] servants in the community or whatever it
[29:32] might be, even just being good citizens,
[29:34] then you see that that that's not what
[29:36] the verse is. That's a anti-word.
[29:39] But the gospel so the gospel is not
[29:41] intended to be a secret.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; Now, as it's revealed to you, the
[29:46] revelation of it is for you personally.
[29:48] The mystery of it is for the bride. But
[29:50] the gospel is not to be a secret.
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; I think there's a lot of layers to that,
[29:55] but I trust you can uh kind of process
[29:57] that in the way that I mean it. So he
[29:58] says, "Let your light so shine before
[30:01] men that they may see your good works
[30:04] and glorify your father which is in
[30:07] heaven."
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:08] &gt;&gt; This glorifying your father which is in
[30:10] heaven.
[30:12] There is a there there's such a a deep
[30:16] meaning in this. I want you to really
[30:17] think about that. that you're going to
[30:19] as light, let your light so shine before
[30:22] men that as you display this light,
[30:25] others will see the light, see your good
[30:28] works, and then glorify your father
[30:30] which is in heaven.
[30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:32] &gt;&gt; And Ephesians 5:es 8 to10, it says, "For
[30:35] ye were sometimes darkness, but now are
[30:37] you light in the Lord." I want you to
[30:39] amplify this. Ye are light in the world,
[30:41] and so let your light so shine. He says,
[30:44] uh, that you are now light in the Lord.
[30:46] Now that you're light in the Lord, he
[30:48] says, "Walk as children of the light."
[30:50] So you are children of the light. If
[30:53] light has children, what would it have?
[30:55] Lights.
[30:56] &gt;&gt; Dogs have dogs. Cats have cats. God had
[30:58] children, they'd be gods, right? If
[31:00] you're a child of the light, then you
[31:02] are light, too. So the fruit of the
[31:04] spirit is in all goodness and
[31:06] righteousness and truth, proving what is
[31:08] acceptable unto the Lord. So now that
[31:10] you are light, you are emitters of
[31:12] truth. Now that there's a shining that
[31:14] you're doing and in your life, you're to
[31:16] walk as children of the light. And then
[31:18] he kind of gives this for the fruit of
[31:20] the spirit is in all goodness a and and
[31:23] righteousness. And so these good works,
[31:25] as Jesus refers to it, let your uh light
[31:28] shine that they may see your good works.
[31:30] Good works are characterized as a
[31:31] shining light. What is that shining
[31:33] light? Fruit of the spirit on display.
[31:36] That fruit of goodness and
[31:38] righteousness. a life that is proving
[31:40] what is that perfect and acceptable will
[31:43] of the Lord.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 6 verse 5, he says,
[31:47] "And when thou prayest
[31:50] because kind of thinking in terms of a
[31:52] light, let your light so shine." What
[31:53] does that mean? It kind of it has if you
[31:56] read it one way, it kind of seems showy,
[31:58] right? Like it's this is kind of a a
[32:00] broadcasting or a display. But he says,
[32:01] "When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as
[32:03] the hypocrite are, for they love to pray
[32:06] standing in the synagogues and in the
[32:07] corner of the street, that they may be
[32:09] seen of men. Verily, I say unto you,
[32:12] they have their reward." When it says,
[32:15] "Let your light shine," and there's to
[32:17] be this broadcasting. There's this
[32:19] emmission of light. It is this attention
[32:22] catching brilliance.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:24] &gt;&gt; That the bride has some attention
[32:26] catching brilliance, but it's not showy.
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:29] &gt;&gt; It's not self-s serving. It's not well
[32:31] we're just going to kind of put on the
[32:32] heirs and we're going to make broad our
[32:33] felactories and we're going to have
[32:35] certain wear certain clothing and
[32:37] certain garments with people look and
[32:38] say whoa they're different they're
[32:39] really different. It's not to be self-s
[32:41] serving. Mark 8:es 34 and 35 it says
[32:45] when he had called the people unto him
[32:47] with the disciples also he said unto
[32:49] them whosoever will come after me let
[32:52] him deny himself and take up his cross
[32:54] and follow me. For whosoever will save
[32:57] his life shall lose it, but whosoever
[32:59] shall lose his life for my sake and the
[33:01] gospels, the same shall save it. So
[33:05] there's things that we do for the sake
[33:08] of the gospel.
[33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:10] &gt;&gt; There's an obedience that we do for the
[33:11] gospel's sake, for the sake of Christ,
[33:13] not for our own sake. He says, "Ye are
[33:16] the light of the world." We're not
[33:17] saying, "Oh, this is my moment. This is
[33:19] my 15 minutes of fame and this is
[33:20] everybody's going to know that I'm
[33:21] famous. I'm going to I'm about to go
[33:23] viral." Uh that's not what it's implying
[33:26] that clout or popularity or RZ or aura
[33:28] or any of those things that we so
[33:29] desperately want in these days. It's
[33:32] about having a life that speaks of the
[33:36] fruit of the spirit of goodness and
[33:38] righteousness.
[33:40] &gt;&gt; Now think of this as we look at these
[33:42] scriptures in more detail and just add
[33:44] scripture upon scripture upon scripture.
[33:46] In Colossians chapter 4:5, walk in
[33:49] wisdom toward them that are without
[33:51] redeeming the time. The lot that uh is
[33:55] behind that phrase, redeeming the time.
[33:57] But you're to walk in wisdom. Walk in uh
[34:00] the wisdom of God. Walk in
[34:01] righteousness. Walk in goodness. Walk in
[34:03] the mind of Christ. To walk in wisdom
[34:06] here is not the wisdom of this world,
[34:08] but it's the wisdom of God. To walk in
[34:10] wisdom towards them that are without. So
[34:13] we are to live the gospel for the
[34:16] benefit of others.
[34:18] &gt;&gt; Walk in wisdom toward them or as an
[34:21] example to them that are without wisdom.
[34:24] &gt;&gt; We are to live the gospel for the
[34:26] benefit of those who have not heard the
[34:27] gospel or who do not presently believe
[34:29] the gospel.
[34:31] &gt;&gt; Really think this is what the gospel is.
[34:33] &gt;&gt; That if you believe the gospel, the
[34:35] preaching of the gospel isn't to
[34:36] reinforce that you're right.
[34:39] &gt;&gt; Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[34:40] Christ is right. By God, I I was
[34:43] baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[34:44] Christ, so I'm right. Holiness unto the
[34:46] Lord is right, and we're holy, so we're
[34:48] right. No, it's not to convince
[34:49] yourselves and everybody else who
[34:51] believes it, but rather the gospel being
[34:53] preached, there's this element that it's
[34:55] for those who've never heard it,
[34:57] &gt;&gt; for those who do not yet believe it,
[35:00] &gt;&gt; to walk in wisdom towards them that are
[35:01] without the body, outside of the body of
[35:03] Christ, to those that are without
[35:05] wisdom. Ephesians 5:es 15, 16, and 17
[35:09] speaks of the same thing. So see then
[35:11] that you walk circumspectly.
[35:14] That means perfectly, not as fools, but
[35:16] as wise. Again, there's that walk in
[35:18] wisdom. Walk wisely. Walk as the wise,
[35:21] redeeming the time. So that gives you
[35:22] another parallel to Colossians 4.
[35:25] Because the days are evil.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:27] &gt;&gt; And then us living in the darkest day
[35:29] there's ever been, the most evil day age
[35:30] there has ever been, then this is never
[35:32] more appropriate and applicable that
[35:34] we're to walk circumspectly. We're not
[35:36] to walk foolishly. We're to walk wisely.
[35:38] were to redeem the time because the
[35:40] present age and the evil. It says,
[35:42] "Wherefore, be ye not unwise, but
[35:45] understanding what the will of the Lord
[35:48] is."
[35:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:51] &gt;&gt; These are scriptures telling us that we
[35:53] are to know God's will. And in knowing
[35:55] God's will, we will obey the will of
[35:58] God. That's wisdom to obey. Walking
[36:00] circumspectly because the days are evil.
[36:03] Paul said that we're to walk in this
[36:04] wisdom redeem the time toward them that
[36:06] are without. So Jesus said, "Let your
[36:09] light so shine before men."
[36:12] &gt;&gt; Right?
[36:12] &gt;&gt; There's that this brilliance. It's
[36:14] eye-catching brilliance. This light
[36:16] emitter, especially in the darkest age
[36:19] has ever been because the days are evil
[36:20] and an evil day, someone that walks
[36:22] circumspectly is going to stand out.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:24] &gt;&gt; Any more honestly is is it shocks
[36:26] people,
[36:27] &gt;&gt; right?
[36:28] &gt;&gt; You go to pay for you go to pay for just
[36:30] a pack of bubble gum and and um you give
[36:33] them a $5 bill and they give you back
[36:34] change for a hundred and you're kind of
[36:36] like, I gave you $5. you just gave me
[36:38] $97 back in change. And and they're
[36:40] like, "Oh my goodness, thank you for
[36:43] being so honest." You're thinking,
[36:45] &gt;&gt; you know, you know, how do people sleep
[36:47] at night? And they say, very good
[36:48] because I sleep on it. What is it? A,
[36:50] you know, serta or something, a
[36:51] mattress, some kind of really expensive
[36:53] mattress. I sleep all night long is what
[36:55] they say. But it's there's this lack of
[36:58] consciousness anymore. So that when
[36:59] you're honest and you're just doing
[37:00] what's decent, people take notice like,
[37:02] wow, that guy put his grocery cart back.
[37:05] &gt;&gt; It's got an upstanding citizen. So in
[37:06] the days of darkness and the days of
[37:08] evil, our right behavior stands out as
[37:11] light.
[37:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:12] &gt;&gt; But it says that we are to let our light
[37:15] shine before men that they may see your
[37:17] good works and glorify God.
[37:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:22] &gt;&gt; And this this is a scripture that really
[37:24] opened up to me recently.
[37:26] It may be at some time in my mind I
[37:29] thought, well, I I'm going to do good
[37:31] and when I do good, people are going to
[37:33] see that I'm doing good and like, you
[37:34] know what, this son of God is just so
[37:37] awesome. I'm really this guy this guy's
[37:40] figured it out. And they'll give God
[37:42] credit. God, thank you so much for
[37:44] brother Aaron. He's such a good
[37:46] Christian. But there's more that is
[37:49] meant to this in that if you look at it
[37:52] especially in light of these other
[37:53] scriptures and I've got so many much
[37:54] many more that I want to share this with
[37:56] you because I'm wanting you to see this
[37:57] aspect of the gospel according to the
[38:00] bride.
[38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; The gospel according to the bride is not
[38:02] history.
[38:03] &gt;&gt; The gospel according to the bride is not
[38:05] self-indicating. The gospel according to
[38:07] the bride isn't about her. Even if the
[38:09] Jesus said the spirit of truth will
[38:10] come. He won't speak of himself or
[38:11] testify of himself but he'll show you
[38:13] things to come. Then our gospel has to
[38:16] be pointing to God. It has to be
[38:17] pointing to Jesus Christ.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; So there there's not this selfishness
[38:21] involved, but this glorification of God.
[38:23] It means that as you let your light
[38:25] shine that other hearts will be
[38:28] enlightened by your example,
[38:31] &gt;&gt; your honesty, your decency, your
[38:33] holiness, and that in seeing your
[38:35] example, it leads to conviction in their
[38:38] hearts. And following that conviction,
[38:40] they come to know the Lord as you have
[38:42] known them, and they are converted.
[38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let your light so shine before
[38:46] men. Let the gospel be broadcast so that
[38:49] when people would see your good works,
[38:51] it would draw them as salt does. In the
[38:53] prior verses to this, Jesus says, "If
[38:55] the salt loses its flavor, if it loses
[38:57] its power, what is it good for?"
[38:59] &gt;&gt; So when you're salty and you live a
[39:01] certain way, people just don't say,
[39:02] "That's salty. That's that added flavor
[39:05] to my life." No, it makes them thirsty
[39:08] and they want to know where did this
[39:09] come from? Where does where's this
[39:11] truth? Where's this righteousness? Where
[39:13] is this keep in your head while everyone
[39:14] else is losing theirs? You say, "I know
[39:16] I know one who's my peace."
[39:19] &gt;&gt; I found a love that pardons and you
[39:20] begin to testify and witness.
[39:24] &gt;&gt; And so when you are that example, that
[39:27] light that is emitted shines into their
[39:29] hearts. It leads them to conviction and
[39:31] ultimately their conversion. And what
[39:32] happens when they're converted? They
[39:34] glorify God.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is let your light so shine
[39:38] before men that your good works would
[39:40] cause one to be led to God. I realize
[39:44] that uh that the way that I used to view
[39:46] it in a sense was really I mean hardly
[39:49] ever do people see you do good and give
[39:51] God glory for it.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; But the real glory to God is when the
[39:54] heart itself sees God.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; Says this in Ephesians chapter 2 10. I
[39:59] hope this kind of amplifies that that
[40:02] angle I'm looking at tonight. For we are
[40:04] his workmanship.
[40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:10] &gt;&gt; Workmanship
[40:11] is that which has been made like a work
[40:14] of art
[40:15] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[40:20] which God hath before ordained that we
[40:22] should walk in them. Well, think of it
[40:25] this way that if we are to let our light
[40:27] so shine before men that men would see
[40:29] your good works, we're ordained to good
[40:31] works. We're we've been created in
[40:33] Christ Jesus. We are his workmanship for
[40:35] the purpose of good works. And Jesus
[40:38] said it's these good works that'll be a
[40:40] light that shines to others that when
[40:42] they see could potent could come to a
[40:45] place to where they glorify God as well.
[40:47] Paul said now you are light where the
[40:49] fruit of the spirit is all goodness and
[40:51] righteousness and that we are to walk in
[40:54] this light for them are who are without
[40:56] the light.
[40:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:59] He says we are his workmanship, that
[41:01] which has been made. And if we are his
[41:04] workmanship created in Christ Jesus,
[41:06] think of it this way. The artwork that
[41:07] is created, if you're an artist, how
[41:10] many artists do we have here? Just
[41:11] selfidentify today. Anybody? Nobody's
[41:15] Okay, finally. We got one, two, two
[41:16] artists. Well, then they they they could
[41:19] uh well can appreciate this. And I
[41:21] haven't asked for any favors. Uh um but
[41:24] you can subscribe to my Patreon later.
[41:26] But artwork does not the artwork does
[41:30] not receive the honor.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; When somebody paints a painting, they're
[41:34] not looking at the paint and say, "Oh,
[41:35] Monaise.
[41:37] You're so wonderful. You're so
[41:38] beautiful." But when they see the
[41:40] artwork, the one who created the art is
[41:43] the one that's praised. Right.
[41:45] &gt;&gt; You look at a piece of art and I maybe
[41:48] an example that had come to mind
[41:49] recently as well is that you could it's
[41:51] not until you really begin to understand
[41:53] the artist and the context of the art
[41:55] that you can really begin to fully
[41:56] appreciate it. You might just look at
[41:58] something say well that was nice like
[41:59] well that was painted in the 1600s
[42:01] before they had all the colors we have
[42:03] today before there was graphic artist
[42:05] before there was ability to trace and
[42:06] all these things that was painted with
[42:08] using these materials was painted over
[42:10] this period of time. This is what it
[42:11] represents. This is the artist that
[42:12] painted it. this is how old they were
[42:14] and you begin to get more context and
[42:16] all of a sudden the painting comes alive
[42:17] like wow I really appreciate that
[42:20] &gt;&gt; there could be something you look at and
[42:21] like ah that's that's nothing that just
[42:24] looks like cartoon that looks like
[42:25] graffiti and somebody says well that's
[42:26] an original banky all like whoa that
[42:28] thing's beautiful uh uh that is a real
[42:32] that's cultural cultural history and
[42:34] that's a real heritage to the community
[42:36] and it's like so knowing the artist
[42:38] gives us insight into the piece of art
[42:40] itself
[42:42] &gt;&gt; and so when we see a work here. It says,
[42:44] "We are his workmanship, created in
[42:46] Christ Jesus by God, new creatures in
[42:49] Christ. We are God's workmanship.
[42:52] Therefore, we are to be pieces of art
[42:56] set on display, not that we would
[42:58] receive glory." That's right.
[42:59] &gt;&gt; But that the artist would receive the
[43:01] glory.
[43:02] &gt;&gt; And so God's purpose for placing light,
[43:05] you are the light of the world.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; A city set on the hill cannot be hid.
[43:09] You're to be in public view. Neither
[43:11] does a man light a candle and put under
[43:13] a bushel, but on a candlestick so that
[43:15] it can give life light to all that are
[43:17] therein. God's purpose for placing light
[43:20] is to give light to others.
[43:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:24] &gt;&gt; The city set on a hill is there for one
[43:26] traveling to the city, for one to know
[43:28] that the confines of that city are
[43:30] nearby. That it's it's set on a hill to
[43:32] guide people to to know which way to go.
[43:35] The light is put on a candlestick in a
[43:38] dark room. It says to give light to
[43:40] those to all that are in the house.
[43:45] &gt;&gt; God places you as a light. You are
[43:47] light. You are the light of the world.
[43:49] Now you are light in the Lord. He places
[43:51] you as light so that you can give light.
[43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:54] &gt;&gt; Set on a hill. Put on a candlestick.
[43:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:57] &gt;&gt; To give light to others.
[43:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:59] &gt;&gt; The gospel according to the bride.
[44:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:03] &gt;&gt; We have a gospel for others to enjoy.
[44:06] the goodness and righteousness and the
[44:08] truth of Jesus Christ.
[44:11] &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy chapter 4:es 5-9
[44:15] there. I' I've I've laid out what my
[44:17] thought is. Now I want just to give you
[44:19] some ways that what this looks like in
[44:22] scripture, maybe some examples. I failed
[44:23] to look at what time I got up here. So,
[44:25] Brother John, you just tell me when to
[44:27] stop.
[44:28] If there's more than one brother John
[44:30] here, I may be in trouble. Deuteronomy
[44:33] 4:es 5-9. Behold, I have taught you
[44:35] statutes and judgments, even as the Lord
[44:38] my God commanded me, that ye should do
[44:40] so in the land whether you go to possess
[44:43] it. So these commandments have been
[44:44] given to them. You should observe them.
[44:46] You should live by them. You should
[44:47] apply them. Keep therefore and do them.
[44:50] For this is your wisdom and your
[44:52] understanding. Notice in the sight of
[44:55] the nations.
[44:57] Think of this and make application to
[44:59] the word which we have received as the
[45:00] bride. We have a message. We have a
[45:02] word. We have a new testament. It's a
[45:04] lot of things that we could claim to
[45:05] possess and have of our own. Now God as
[45:07] he's given statutes and judgments to
[45:09] Israel when they go to possess their
[45:11] land. He's saying do it because this is
[45:14] your wisdom and your understanding not
[45:16] just to impress one another but in the
[45:18] sight of the Gentiles in the sight of
[45:21] the other nations which shall hear of
[45:22] all these statutes and say surely this
[45:24] is a great nation. This great nation is
[45:27] a wise and understanding people.
[45:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:30] &gt;&gt; Notice what he's saying. that if they
[45:32] were to do what God told them to do, it
[45:34] would be a witness to all their nations.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:36] &gt;&gt; Their wisdom, their understanding, the
[45:38] way that they treat one another, the way
[45:40] that they take care of the poor, the way
[45:41] that they look after one another, the
[45:43] way that they uh take care of their
[45:45] worship and the service to their God.
[45:47] For what nation is there so great? Who
[45:49] hath God so nigh unto them as the Lord
[45:51] our God is in all things that we call
[45:53] upon him for?
[45:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what nation is there so great
[45:56] that hath statutes and judgments so
[45:59] righteous as all this law which I set
[46:01] before you this day? Only take heed to
[46:04] thyself and keep thy soul diligently,
[46:07] lest thou forget the things which thine
[46:09] eyes have seen, and lest they depart
[46:12] from thy heart all the days of thy life,
[46:14] but teach them thy sons and thy son's
[46:17] sons.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:18] &gt;&gt; What are these statutes and judgments?
[46:20] It's the law. These divine instructions
[46:22] that God here is saying contain wisdom
[46:25] and understanding of God. That your
[46:27] wisdom and understanding will be seen in
[46:29] light of all the nations. And this
[46:30] learning and keeping of the law, this
[46:34] wisdom and understanding demonstrates
[46:36] wisdom. It demonstrates the
[46:39] understanding of God. And he says, "Keep
[46:42] these things. Teach these things so that
[46:44] you can continue to demonstrate this
[46:46] wisdom through your obedience."
[46:49] And when it says that other nations will
[46:51] see it, I know in our minds we think,
[46:52] "Oh, everybody's going to agree.
[46:54] Everybody's going to see it." Not
[46:55] everybody does.
[46:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that I I I can't
[46:59] make you believe it. And and maybe just
[47:00] paraphrase a little bit. He says, "It's
[47:02] not my responsibility to make you
[47:03] believe." All I I'm just required and
[47:05] I'm responsible to preach it.
[47:07] &gt;&gt; So you're not responsible to get
[47:09] everybody to agree with the gospel or
[47:10] say, "I like that. That's good." Or give
[47:11] God glory. But you're responsible for
[47:14] sharing it. Amen.
[47:16] &gt;&gt; Responsible for living it.
[47:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; And when it says that these other
[47:21] nations would see your wisdom and
[47:22] understanding and say, "Wow, what a
[47:24] great nation these people are. Who has a
[47:26] God like this?" He's saying that the
[47:28] Gentiles would be influenced to reject
[47:30] idol worship.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; And serve the one true God.
[47:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:35] &gt;&gt; So he's saying Israel was to be an
[47:37] example.
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:39] &gt;&gt; And they were witnessing by their works,
[47:42] not by their words.
[47:43] &gt;&gt; Right?
[47:44] They they weren't going to uh you know
[47:46] the gentile markets and the gentile
[47:48] places and preaching on the street
[47:50] corner necessarily. They weren't telling
[47:51] you you circumcised heathens, right?
[47:54] They they lived they treated the
[47:56] stranger well.
[47:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:58] &gt;&gt; They treated one another well. And and
[48:00] as they as they lived and conducted
[48:02] themselves, people say, "You know what?
[48:03] There's something different about this
[48:05] people
[48:06] &gt;&gt; and this God they serve.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; I want to know this God. I want to be a
[48:09] part of this."
[48:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that their religion was by
[48:13] by their government. It was their
[48:16] religion was their way of life. And
[48:17] there was a lot that was there. So if
[48:19] one was going to be converted, they'd be
[48:21] converting to Judaism. But it's a shadow
[48:23] of Christianity.
[48:25] In 1 Peter 2 11 and 12, it says, "Dearly
[48:28] beloved, I beseech you as strangers and
[48:30] pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lust
[48:33] which war against the soul."
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:35] &gt;&gt; Having your conversation honest among
[48:38] the Gentiles.
[48:40] Just as it was spoken to Israel, that
[48:42] their wisdom and understanding could be
[48:43] displayed in the sight of the Gentiles,
[48:45] which are the nations, the people. He
[48:48] says, "Have your conversation honest
[48:50] among the Gentiles, that whereas they
[48:51] speak against you as evildoers, they may
[48:54] be they may by your good works, which
[48:56] they shall behold, glorify God in the
[48:58] day of visitation."
[48:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; A lot that's being mentioned here
[49:03] &gt;&gt; that there is something in your heart
[49:05] that is honest. And you have this honest
[49:07] conversation among the Gentiles. And he
[49:08] says that they may speak evil against
[49:11] you as evildoers, but they may by your
[49:13] good works. If you do something wrong
[49:16] and they say something wrong about you,
[49:18] you earned that.
[49:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; If if you misbehave, if you're
[49:21] dishonest, if you hurt, if you pain
[49:23] somebody, if they they speak against you
[49:25] as an evildoer, you you've asked for it.
[49:27] But but they may by your good works
[49:30] which they shall behold, they'll see it
[49:32] glorify God in the day of visitation.
[49:35] that there's a time even a time when God
[49:37] visits them or there's this time going
[49:39] to be why would they glorify God in the
[49:40] day of visitation if it hadn't been your
[49:42] good works
[49:43] &gt;&gt; that gave him a place of safety and
[49:44] refuge in that day of visitation
[49:48] &gt;&gt; in 2 Kings 5:es 1 to18 it's been a while
[49:52] since we've heard this story
[49:54] and and this is what really inspired me
[49:56] and I just felt the Lord linked some
[49:57] things together and I just felt this
[49:59] open door to minister on this subject
[50:03] but Sunday brother Gideon preached on
[50:05] the gospel according to the bride. His
[50:07] text was here and he ended in this
[50:08] story. And so I I'm I'm not going to try
[50:11] to bring out all the things that he
[50:13] brought out because I think it was just
[50:14] perfect and I wouldn't want to add
[50:16] anything to it. But with the benefit of
[50:17] that, let's just look at it again
[50:19] because we've had this so recently in
[50:21] our hearts
[50:22] &gt;&gt; and and brother Justin, I don't know if
[50:23] you need to go get it on the archive,
[50:24] but you're familiar with the story in 2
[50:27] Kings 5:es 1-8. says, "Now non captain
[50:30] of the host of the king of Syria was a
[50:32] great man with his master and honorable
[50:34] because by him the Lord had given
[50:36] deliverance unto Syria. He was also a
[50:38] mighty man in valor, but he was a
[50:40] leper." What a de speaking of this
[50:42] captain non
[50:45] this captain to the king of Syria and
[50:47] he's a mighty man and God had actually
[50:49] given a deliverance to Syria because of
[50:52] this honorable man but he's a leper and
[50:54] he's categorized now in one of the worst
[50:56] classes of people and the Syrians had
[50:58] gone out by companies and had brought
[51:00] away captive out of the land of Israel a
[51:02] little maid and she waited on non's wife
[51:05] so now you can see these degrees of
[51:06] separation you have the the girl little
[51:08] Israelite girl who's been captured
[51:10] She's a servant to Non's wife. So here's
[51:13] the wife. Then there's non. There's the
[51:15] king. So she's she's a few ways down.
[51:18] And she said unto her mistress, "Would
[51:19] God, my lord, where were with the
[51:21] prophet? Would God, my lord, non were
[51:24] with the prophet that is in Samaria, for
[51:27] he would recover him of his leprosy."
[51:31] So here is this maid who's testifying. I
[51:34] know the word of God is powerful enough.
[51:36] I know there's a power present to heal a
[51:39] man even of his leprosy.
[51:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[51:41] &gt;&gt; Perhaps non's wife was lamenting, "My
[51:43] husband's a leper. We've been ostracized
[51:44] from social gatherings. He's should be
[51:46] this honorable man above what he has
[51:49] given and is uh this privilege that he
[51:51] would have." He says, "Uh uh we're we're
[51:53] just in this category of people that are
[51:55] rejected and there's so much sorrow."
[51:56] Maybe she's lamenting and and the
[51:59] mistress just testifies, "I just wish
[52:01] that my Lord I just wish Non could be in
[52:04] the presence of this prophet in Samaria
[52:07] and I know God could heal him."
[52:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:10] &gt;&gt; Reminds me of even said, "Oh Jesus, if
[52:12] you had been here, my brother hadn't
[52:14] died."
[52:14] &gt;&gt; And all these things that just have so
[52:16] much confidence in in God in this way.
[52:18] And one went in and told his Lord,
[52:20] saying, "Thus and thus," said the maid
[52:22] that is in the land of Israel. I like
[52:23] how it just kind of says thus and thus,
[52:25] &gt;&gt; right? So it's like thus and thus. Now
[52:27] we we have scriptural reason to say well
[52:29] what did they say? Not thus and thus.
[52:31] But we read it said she said you know
[52:32] that I just wish that my my master
[52:34] naming could be in the presence of the
[52:36] prophet. He'd be cured of his leprosy.
[52:38] But the word gets to uh uh the Lord. And
[52:41] then the king of Syria said
[52:44] uh go to go and I will send a letter to
[52:47] the king of Israel. And he departed and
[52:49] took with him 10 talents of silver and
[52:51] 6,000 pieces of gold and 10 changes of
[52:52] raignment. He brought the letter to the
[52:54] king of Israel, saying,"Now when this
[52:55] letter has come unto thee, behold, I
[52:57] have therew with sent name in my servant
[52:59] to thee, that thou mayest recover him of
[53:01] his leprosy." There was a little bit of
[53:03] a misunderstanding. The thus and thus
[53:05] didn't convey that it was a prophet in
[53:08] Samaria, not a king,
[53:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[53:10] &gt;&gt; But yet there, this is what they're
[53:11] seeking. And it came to pass when the
[53:13] king of Israel read the letter, he rent
[53:15] his clothes and said, "Am I God to kill
[53:16] and to make alive that this man doth
[53:18] send unto me to recover a man of his
[53:20] leprosy? Wherefore consider
[53:24] I pray you and see how he maketh the
[53:26] quarrel against me. So there's where
[53:28] even it's now it's misunderstood.
[53:30] &gt;&gt; There's just a little bit of a
[53:31] testifying. Someone hears it says, "Oh,
[53:33] we need to go to Israel because there's
[53:35] a king there and he'll be able to
[53:37] recover non of his leprosy." And now the
[53:39] king of Israel thinks this is mischief.
[53:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:43] &gt;&gt; He is doing this because he knows I
[53:44] can't heal this man of leprosy. and I am
[53:47] now tested and tempted to take gold in
[53:49] these things or if I try anything and it
[53:51] doesn't work I'm going to be blamed he
[53:52] means mischief. But then it says and it
[53:55] was so when Elisha the man of God had
[53:57] heard that the king of Israel had rent
[53:59] his clothes that he sent to the king
[54:01] saying wherefore hast thou rent thy
[54:04] clothes.
[54:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:05] &gt;&gt; So there's a lot that's being
[54:06] communicated in this. There's a lot of
[54:07] thus and thus that's being conveyed
[54:09] around and they did this without the
[54:10] benefit of X Twitter. the old folks.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; There wasn't
[54:17] Elisha wasn't in the snap group
[54:19] &gt;&gt; with uh with all these people and
[54:21] realizing something's going wrong at the
[54:22] palace there. This is word is getting
[54:24] around. And so it says that Elisha hears
[54:29] and he says uh let him come to me and he
[54:33] shall know that there is a prophet in
[54:35] Israel. Amen.
[54:37] &gt;&gt; So non came with his horses and with his
[54:40] chariot and stood at the door of the
[54:41] house of Elijah. And Elijah sent a
[54:43] messenger unto him, saying, "Go and wash
[54:45] in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh
[54:48] shall come again to thee, and thou shalt
[54:50] be clean."
[54:51] &gt;&gt; Now, this is the word of God uh through
[54:54] the messenger. So you have Elisha who
[54:56] has sends the message through his
[54:58] messenger. And this messenger is
[55:00] faithful to it. And the response
[55:01] initially isn't good. Non's angry. and
[55:03] he went away and said, "Behold, I
[55:04] thought he will surely come out to me."
[55:06] So maybe some pretense. I'm an honorable
[55:08] man. Surely that the prophet, if it was
[55:10] important for me to hear, he would have
[55:11] delivered it to me face to face. He
[55:13] needs to be in my I need to be in his
[55:15] presence. He would stand and call on the
[55:16] name of the Lord with his God and strike
[55:18] his hand over the place and recover the
[55:20] leper. So what do you want? Something
[55:21] fantastic. Maybe a prayer line, right?
[55:24] Maybe that's that's what we need. We
[55:25] need a prayer line. We need some
[55:26] excitement. Get the music going, right?
[55:28] Set the atmosphere. Put it on a stage
[55:29] and a platform so everybody can see.
[55:31] Make sure this hits the stream. make
[55:33] sure this goes viral. And so there's a
[55:35] he's wanting this to be very uh maybe
[55:38] ceremonial.
[55:41] And Elisha sent a message to him saying,
[55:42] "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times,
[55:44] and thy flesh shall come again to thee,
[55:46] and thou shalt be clean."
[55:48] But non was wroth and went away and
[55:50] said, "Behold, I thought he will surely
[55:51] come to me and stand and call in the
[55:52] name of his God, and strike his hand
[55:54] over the place, and and recover the
[55:55] leper. Are not Avana and Farfar rivers
[55:58] of Damascus better than all the waters
[56:00] of Israel? May I not wash in them and be
[56:02] clean? So he turned and went away in a
[56:04] rage. And his servants came near and
[56:07] spake unto him and said,"My father,"
[56:10] this is just uh beautiful. These things
[56:13] set in motion by a maid. One comment by
[56:15] a maid, "These things that are set, my
[56:18] father, if the prophet had bid thee to
[56:19] do some great thing, wouldest thou not
[56:21] have done it? How much rather than when
[56:23] he saith unto thee, wash and be clean?"
[56:25] Now what a striking statement. Hey, you
[56:28] wish he would have had you do something
[56:30] great.
[56:31] &gt;&gt; You wish he would have had you travel
[56:32] all the way back to these clean rivers.
[56:34] You wish that he would have come and had
[56:35] some sort of ceremony. You you're
[56:37] wishing that there was more to it. He's
[56:38] just saying, "Wash and be clean."
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; Believe.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Just believe. And it and it's such a
[56:45] simple simple gospel, a simple message,
[56:47] and it struck non's heart. Then went he
[56:49] down and dipped himself seven times in
[56:51] Jordan, according to the saying of the
[56:52] man of God, and his flesh came again
[56:54] like unto the flesh of a little child,
[56:56] and he was clean.
[57:00] &gt;&gt; All by the testimony of this maid
[57:03] &gt;&gt; who knew the truth,
[57:05] &gt;&gt; who spoke a word. Oh, I just wish he
[57:07] could get in the presence of that
[57:09] prophet.
[57:11] Prophet maybe even demonstrated. It
[57:12] doesn't need to be in the presence of
[57:13] the prophet. It's obedience to the word.
[57:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. But it says in verse 15, he
[57:17] returned to the man of God. He and all
[57:18] his company had came and he stood before
[57:20] him and said, "Behold now I know that
[57:21] there is no God in all earth but in
[57:23] Israel." Now notice where who he's
[57:24] glorifying.
[57:25] &gt;&gt; Not glorifying the king of Israel.
[57:27] &gt;&gt; Not glorifying his own king. Not
[57:29] glorifying the prophet. Not glorifying
[57:31] the maid. Not glorifying his friends who
[57:32] said, "Whoa, slow down. Why don't you
[57:34] just go do it?" He glorifies God.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:36] &gt;&gt; There's no God in all the earth.
[57:38] Remember how God said, "If you keep my
[57:39] commandments, if you live in wisdom and
[57:41] understanding that all nations will will
[57:43] say there's no other God like thee."
[57:44] Here's an example where one says there's
[57:46] no god in all the earth but in Israel
[57:48] like this.
[57:49] &gt;&gt; Now therefore I pray thee take a
[57:50] blessing of thy servant. But he said as
[57:52] the Lord liveth before whom I stand I
[57:54] will receive none. And he urged him to
[57:56] take it but he refused. And non said
[57:59] shall there shall there not then I pray
[58:02] thee be given to thy servant two mules
[58:04] burden of earth. Notice this. It's just
[58:06] really really uh uh striking. Give to me
[58:12] calls himself a servant. two mules
[58:14] burden of earth. For thy servant will
[58:18] henceforth offer neither burnt offering
[58:21] nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto
[58:23] the Lord.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:24] &gt;&gt; The healing was wonderful.
[58:27] &gt;&gt; That's part of the atonement.
[58:29] &gt;&gt; Divine healing. But what's the other
[58:31] part? Salvation.
[58:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[58:33] &gt;&gt; The bride's gospel has divine healing in
[58:35] it. The bride's gospel has salvation.
[58:38] Healing of the soul. And notice through
[58:40] this great miracle and this work of
[58:41] witnessing, he wants to take earth from
[58:46] Israel. And he says,"I will not offer
[58:50] any other sacrifice to any other gods
[58:52] except in the Lord. In this thing the
[58:54] Lord pardon thy servant, that when my
[58:56] master goeth into the house of Rimman to
[58:58] worship thee, and he leanth on my hand,
[59:00] and I bow myself in the house of Rimman,
[59:02] when I bowed myself in the house of
[59:04] Reman, the Lord pardoned thy servant in
[59:06] this thing." Now he's repenting. Amen.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Of his idol worship.
[59:10] &gt;&gt; He's repenting of the false gods. He's
[59:12] repenting of the ideology and idolatry
[59:15] and all this spiritual fornication in
[59:17] his life. In this thing, Lord, forgive
[59:19] me when I have worshiped in the house of
[59:21] the false god. Let me now take and it's
[59:24] maybe some fanaticism. Let me take earth
[59:27] from Israel and bring it to where I am
[59:29] in Syria so that I can build an altar on
[59:32] dirt from uh Israel where God lives and
[59:35] God dwells. And there I will praise God.
[59:37] and there I will glorify God on dirt
[59:39] from Israel because there's only one
[59:40] true God and it's the God that's with
[59:42] Israel.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; He says, "Forgive me in this idol
[59:46] worship."
[59:48] I know it speaks in uh maybe future
[59:50] tense, but as I wrestled with this and
[59:52] just really wanted to understand it
[59:54] myself, there could be this
[59:56] pre-adventure. If I ever worship a false
[59:58] idol again, Lord, forgive me in that
[1:00:00] thing.
[1:00:02] &gt;&gt; If it be by peer pre peer pressure, a
[1:00:04] mistake or just memory, Lord, forgive
[1:00:06] me. But there's this repentance that's
[1:00:08] being done. If I have bowed where I have
[1:00:09] bowed myself to this false god, forgive
[1:00:12] me for my idolatry, I believe now in the
[1:00:14] one true God.
[1:00:17] &gt;&gt; What we see in this maid's story
[1:00:20] is her faith testified of a God who
[1:00:23] could heal her master's husband or
[1:00:25] spouse of leprosy.
[1:00:28] And it set in motion a chain of events
[1:00:30] that led to this honorable man who was a
[1:00:33] mighty man in valor that God had seen
[1:00:35] something in him. And God had ordained
[1:00:38] captivity,
[1:00:40] poor circumstances, you name it, to
[1:00:41] where there's one witness, one
[1:00:43] testimony, and it leads to now this
[1:00:44] great man saying, "I will from
[1:00:46] henceforth forever serve the one true
[1:00:49] God."
[1:00:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; The gospel according to the bride,
[1:00:54] that's you demonstrating truth for
[1:00:56] Christ's sake. for Christ's glory and
[1:00:58] for someone else's benefit.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:01] &gt;&gt; If we have a message, if we have a
[1:01:02] gospel, if we are the final voice to the
[1:01:04] final age, if if we've got thus sayith
[1:01:06] the Lord or keep still, if we have the
[1:01:08] mind of Christ to know what he wants
[1:01:10] done with the word, then God has a
[1:01:12] purpose in it. There's something that he
[1:01:13] wants to accomplish by it. And I'm not
[1:01:15] trying to give you the whole gospel or
[1:01:17] every aspect of it and what it can
[1:01:18] accomplish. But the gospel is given to
[1:01:21] you and you have good news. You have a
[1:01:23] gospel to share to give glory to Christ.
[1:01:27] and to benefit someone else.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Notice what the scripture says in 1
[1:01:31] Peter chapter 3:es 1-2. Likewise, ye
[1:01:34] wives, be in subjection to your own
[1:01:35] husbands. I pause for all the husbands
[1:01:37] to say, "Amen."
[1:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; You can keep going. I'm behind in my
[1:01:45] water consumption today. I got to get 64
[1:01:47] ounces while I preach
[1:01:51] and I'm not stopping until I get all 64.
[1:01:58] Maybe there'll be a part three.
[1:02:01] 1 Peter chapter 3:es 1 and 2. Likewise,
[1:02:03] you wives be in subjection to your own
[1:02:05] husbands, that if any obey not the word,
[1:02:09] they also may without the word be one by
[1:02:12] the conversation of the wives.
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; We understand what the scripture is
[1:02:17] saying. wives, believing wives, be in
[1:02:20] subjection to your own husbands, that if
[1:02:22] any of them do not believe the gospel,
[1:02:24] if they won't obey the word, they also
[1:02:28] may without the word, without believing
[1:02:32] would be one to the gospel by the life,
[1:02:35] the conduct and character of the wives,
[1:02:38] while they behold your chasteed
[1:02:40] conversation.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Coupled with fear.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; The chasteed conversation.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. is that holiness, that sanctity,
[1:02:49] that faithfulness in life
[1:02:52] coupled with fear. That's not just the
[1:02:53] fear of God, even reverence and respect
[1:02:56] for the husband.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; There's a lot that um I'm pointing to in
[1:03:00] this in terms of the teaching of the the
[1:03:02] wife and the husband and those
[1:03:03] relationships. I know there's a lot in
[1:03:04] that, but just take it into our mind
[1:03:06] what's taught about the role of these
[1:03:08] spouses and here speaking specifically
[1:03:10] of a believing wife who has an
[1:03:12] unbelieving husband is saying that the
[1:03:14] wisdom of the word is demonstrated
[1:03:17] without speaking by obedience to the
[1:03:20] word.
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; She doesn't have to be like, well,
[1:03:22] Christian wouldn't do that and you're
[1:03:23] not supposed to do that
[1:03:26] on and on and on nagging about what the
[1:03:27] Bible says. You know what the Bible says
[1:03:28] about that, right? That's probably not
[1:03:30] going to work. But it's saying that if
[1:03:32] you will serve your husband as a
[1:03:36] believer ought to serve their husband.
[1:03:39] Your obedience to the word will begin to
[1:03:41] work in the heart of the husband that he
[1:03:44] might be one. That means to gain one to
[1:03:47] faith in Christ. One who before was
[1:03:50] faithless that they may be one to Christ
[1:03:52] by what? By seeing this reverential fear
[1:03:54] of God, reverence, respect for their
[1:03:56] husband and holy life.
[1:03:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. to be one
[1:04:04] through your gospel lived
[1:04:08] the testimony. It's not being able to
[1:04:10] sit down and say, "Husband, I got
[1:04:10] something to show you here. You believe
[1:04:12] in trinitarian baptism, but let me show
[1:04:13] you something right here. If you want to
[1:04:14] turn to your Bibles right now, I want
[1:04:15] you to show you in the Bible where the
[1:04:16] trinitarian baptism is wrong."
[1:04:19] Okay. All right. You know, you explained
[1:04:21] it really, really well. So maybe that's
[1:04:23] true. And you said, "Well, the Bible
[1:04:25] says this and the Bible says it's a sh
[1:04:26] sin to do this and it's a shame to do
[1:04:28] that." He's like, "Well, I guess I'm
[1:04:28] ashamed.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Guess I'm a sinner." It's in that you
[1:04:32] could live the word of God in such a way
[1:04:34] to where it pricks the heart of the the
[1:04:36] husband,
[1:04:36] &gt;&gt; the heart of that spouse,
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; and he begins to get thirsty.
[1:04:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:41] &gt;&gt; And it wins him.
[1:04:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:45] If
[1:04:45] &gt;&gt; I could put it this way, the gospel is
[1:04:47] muted
[1:04:49] by a believing wife who's not subject to
[1:04:51] her unbelieving husband.
[1:04:53] The Bible's saying that if you are not
[1:04:56] if a believing wife and I'm not trying
[1:04:57] to I'm not trying to move into these
[1:04:59] areas and I'm not using it to make a
[1:05:00] point to situations here. I'm clueless.
[1:05:03] I just like to fish with brother Ron. So
[1:05:05] if I want to talk about fishing and
[1:05:06] things like that if you want to say what
[1:05:07] do we know about this church? Well, I
[1:05:08] know we like to fish, right? It's all
[1:05:11] the socializing I've done in this
[1:05:12] church. So I'm not trying to make a
[1:05:14] point about anything. I'm just showing
[1:05:15] you an example in the scripture
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; wherein the believing spouse makes an
[1:05:21] impact on the unbelieving and wins them
[1:05:24] to Christ.
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; So what happens when we don't obey the
[1:05:27] gospel? What is he saying here that if a
[1:05:29] believing wife is disrespectful a and
[1:05:32] mistreats her husband? It mutes the
[1:05:35] power of the gospel.
[1:05:37] Second Peter chapter 2:2 and many shall
[1:05:40] follow their pernitious ways by reason
[1:05:42] of whom the way of truth shall be evil
[1:05:44] spoken of. And if you look in the
[1:05:46] context of this, he's saying
[1:05:48] Christianity is going to be blamed for
[1:05:50] your bad behavior.
[1:05:52] &gt;&gt; Those that profess to believe the truth,
[1:05:54] who act peritiously, those who profess
[1:05:56] to be message believers, those that
[1:05:57] profess to be Christians, those that
[1:05:59] profess to be men of God, who abuse the
[1:06:01] people, who live unfaithfully, who live
[1:06:02] double lives, who live hypocritically,
[1:06:04] who fleece the people. I saw something
[1:06:06] today where God spoke to a pastor in
[1:06:08] Denver to tell everybody to invest in
[1:06:11] his crypto exchange that he created,
[1:06:14] heaven's exchange or something like that
[1:06:16] and got like $1.5 million and spend it
[1:06:19] all on himself and his wife. He said the
[1:06:21] Lord told him to do it. He said, "I was
[1:06:23] just doing it believing that God would
[1:06:24] reward them for their faithfulness and
[1:06:25] their giving and I've obeyed the Lord
[1:06:27] and I'm going to suffer this trial. This
[1:06:29] is an evil assignment against my life."
[1:06:33] Why is he just he's just a frost? He's
[1:06:34] just a con man.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; What happens? Of course. What do the
[1:06:38] publications say? Of course he was a
[1:06:39] pastor. Of course he was a Christian.
[1:06:41] That's what these Christians do.
[1:06:44] &gt;&gt; And it's a shame that that is the case
[1:06:47] anymore. That Christians have some of
[1:06:49] the worst testimonies.
[1:06:52] &gt;&gt; They're right up there with lawyers when
[1:06:53] it comes to really, really bad
[1:06:55] reputation.
[1:06:57] But professing believers who act unwise
[1:07:01] or dishonestly or disobedient or do not
[1:07:03] honor the word are a reproach to the
[1:07:06] gospel, the very thing that they are
[1:07:08] called to preach. In Acts 4:13, it says
[1:07:13] this, "And when they had saw the
[1:07:15] boldness of Peter and John, and
[1:07:16] perceiving that they were unlearned and
[1:07:18] ignorant men, they marveled and they
[1:07:20] took knowledge of them that they had
[1:07:23] been with Jesus." Notice now how their
[1:07:25] lives, how they lived. They saw their
[1:07:28] boldness, their manner, their character,
[1:07:30] the way they conducted themselves and
[1:07:31] they marveled and they took note that
[1:07:34] they had been with Jesus. In other
[1:07:37] words, they were reflecting the life and
[1:07:39] the teaching of the one they followed.
[1:07:41] &gt;&gt; It says they'd been with Jesus. They
[1:07:43] didn't notice that they had the
[1:07:44] wristband from having been at the sermon
[1:07:45] on the mount. Didn't mean that they had
[1:07:47] had got the stamp and their passport for
[1:07:49] being on the boat uh when they crossed
[1:07:51] the the sea. No, they looked at it. It
[1:07:53] says, "These are people that we identify
[1:07:55] with the kind of nature and character,
[1:07:58] the teaching of the one they professed
[1:07:59] to follow."
[1:08:01] &gt;&gt; It says in Actsap 11 26, "And when he
[1:08:03] had found him, he brought him unto
[1:08:04] Antioch. It came to pass at a whole year
[1:08:07] they assembled themselves with the
[1:08:08] church and taught much people. And the
[1:08:11] disciples were called Christians first
[1:08:13] in Antioch."
[1:08:15] Christian, that's Cristianos, a follower
[1:08:18] of Christ,
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:08:21] because they were a follower of Christ.
[1:08:22] They were they obeyed the teachings of
[1:08:25] Christ. They were Cristiano is speaking
[1:08:27] that they were im they they imitated
[1:08:29] Christ.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; And notice it's not that the Christians
[1:08:32] it took them a year to come up with a
[1:08:34] name for themselves.
[1:08:36] They gathered together for a year and
[1:08:37] they they they kind of broke out and
[1:08:39] they had these these uh spitball
[1:08:41] sessions and these uh name building
[1:08:43] groups and got these committees and they
[1:08:45] took a whole year and they put it up for
[1:08:46] boat uh vote and it wasn't Christian
[1:08:49] mcch Christian or whatever it is. Bodie
[1:08:51] McBod face or whatever. That's not what
[1:08:53] was voted in. Nobody voted on it. The
[1:08:55] people said the people said these are
[1:08:57] Christians.
[1:08:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:59] &gt;&gt; They might have used it as a term of
[1:09:00] derision. They might have used it to try
[1:09:02] to make fun of them, but at least they
[1:09:04] were faithfully reflecting the one they
[1:09:06] claimed to follow.
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; They were followers of Christ.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:10] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in the sermon, God's
[1:09:12] chosen place of worship says in his
[1:09:13] promised word, you won't have to
[1:09:15] interpret it. He will interpret it
[1:09:18] &gt;&gt; through you.
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:09:19] &gt;&gt; man. Okay. I thought I got out of that.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; Thought he would just use the prophet to
[1:09:23] interpret it. He's the divine
[1:09:24] interpreter of the word always, right?
[1:09:26] We just say it's the prophet so I don't
[1:09:27] have to interpret it. Well, you can
[1:09:29] misinterpret it then by the way you
[1:09:30] live,
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:09:32] &gt;&gt; I'm not an interpreter of the message. I
[1:09:34] don't interpret the message. I just say
[1:09:36] what the tapes say and then live
[1:09:38] contrary to the tapes. Yeah. You're not
[1:09:40] an interpreter of the message. You're a
[1:09:41] misinterpreter of the message.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:09:44] &gt;&gt; If you don't live what the word says
[1:09:47] because he says he will interpret it
[1:09:49] through you what you're doing what he
[1:09:51] promised to do. The church that follows
[1:09:54] him will be so much like him until the
[1:09:56] people will know.
[1:09:59] &gt;&gt; That's what we want.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; I don't want to have to interpret it. I
[1:10:03] want him to interpret it through me.
[1:10:05] &gt;&gt; A life lived by the word will be the
[1:10:06] word expressed.
[1:10:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:08] &gt;&gt; First Peter chapter 3 13-1 17. And who
[1:10:11] is he that will harm you if you be
[1:10:13] followers of that which is good? Listen
[1:10:15] to this. He's expounding upon this, but
[1:10:18] just want you to catch these narrow
[1:10:19] principles in this. But and if you but
[1:10:21] and if you suffer for righteousness
[1:10:23] sake, happy are ye. And be not afraid of
[1:10:26] their terror, neither be you troubled.
[1:10:28] But sanctify the Lord God in your
[1:10:30] hearts, and be ready always to give an
[1:10:32] answer to every man that askketh you a
[1:10:34] reason of the hope that is in you with
[1:10:37] meekness and fear.
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; We ought to sanctify God in our hearts
[1:10:42] and be ready to answer when they have a
[1:10:45] question. ready to answer anybody who
[1:10:49] asks you a reason of the hope that is in
[1:10:51] you with meekness and fear.
[1:10:53] &gt;&gt; So there's a certain uh disposition and
[1:10:56] character you want to have in answering.
[1:10:57] But why are they even going to ask you
[1:10:59] the question? If the whole world is
[1:11:02] doing something and you're doing along
[1:11:03] with them, nobody's going to say, "Well,
[1:11:05] what's your how do you have so much
[1:11:06] hope?" You're you're going along with
[1:11:08] the masses.
[1:11:09] &gt;&gt; You're dressing like them, acting like
[1:11:10] them, doing all the things that they do.
[1:11:12] They're not going to ask you. But when
[1:11:13] your life is lived in such a way to
[1:11:15] where it's it's counterculture, not
[1:11:17] because you're trying to be a hipster,
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; not because you're trying to be
[1:11:20] different, not because you're trying to
[1:11:21] get clicks, but you're different because
[1:11:23] you obey the word of God, then they're
[1:11:25] going to ask you, "Where's your hope?"
[1:11:28] It says, "Having a good conscience that
[1:11:30] whereas they speak evil of you as
[1:11:31] evildoers, they may be ashamed that
[1:11:34] falsely accuse your good conversation in
[1:11:37] Christ.
[1:11:39] For it is better if the will of God be
[1:11:40] so that you suffer for welloing than for
[1:11:42] evildoing.
[1:11:46] &gt;&gt; There's a there's a there's a messaging
[1:11:48] in the way that you live, the way you
[1:11:51] treat people,
[1:11:53] &gt;&gt; the way you treat them when you're
[1:11:54] checking out at the gas station
[1:11:55] &gt;&gt; or the grocery store, the way you treat
[1:11:57] people when you come into contact with
[1:11:59] them. Whether it be in hospitality
[1:12:01] situations or it be in uh point of sale
[1:12:04] transactions, whatever, there's a way
[1:12:06] that you're you're you're messaging.
[1:12:09] You're sharing something.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; The way that we treat other people.
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; I had a I saw a tweet one time. I saved
[1:12:17] it. It's been a number of years now,
[1:12:18] maybe five or six years since I've seen
[1:12:20] it. I don't know that I've used it here
[1:12:22] ever, but uh preaching here for 24
[1:12:25] years, so I've already preached
[1:12:26] everything I know already. This is just
[1:12:28] a reheat from maybe 2006. I don't know.
[1:12:33] But there's a tweet said something like
[1:12:35] and it was a server is and if you ever
[1:12:37] worked in the restaurant industry I
[1:12:38] think you have and they say that there's
[1:12:40] nothing worse than seeing a church crowd
[1:12:42] come on Sunday.
[1:12:42] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's the truth
[1:12:44] &gt;&gt; because they treat the staff the worst.
[1:12:46] They don't tip. They act entitled.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; And this is the this is what's
[1:12:50] representing Christianity.
[1:12:52] &gt;&gt; And who wants to go to your church,
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; right? If that's the way you treat
[1:12:55] people when you get out of church.
[1:12:59] &gt;&gt; They should be ashamed to falsely accuse
[1:13:01] you. They'll they'll lie about you.
[1:13:02] They'll say all sorts of things about
[1:13:04] you. But when they they'll be ashamed if
[1:13:06] it's false, but it's better if the will
[1:13:08] of God be so that you suffer for
[1:13:10] welloing than for evildoing.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Get kicked out of a restaurant because
[1:13:14] you're rude. Don't say it's because
[1:13:16] you're a Christian,
[1:13:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:13:18] &gt;&gt; Don't say it's because they didn't like
[1:13:19] your long hair. They said because they
[1:13:20] know this and they know that. If you're
[1:13:22] rude, if you're not Christlike, then
[1:13:24] you're you're you're be you're you're
[1:13:25] suffering for evildoing. Amen.
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 4:12. That you
[1:13:31] may walk honestly toward them that are
[1:13:34] without
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; and that you may have lack of nothing.
[1:13:37] Chew on that.
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; We're to walk honestly with integrity
[1:13:41] and righteously towards them that are
[1:13:43] what? Without honesty, without the
[1:13:45] gospel, without truth. Those that are
[1:13:47] without the body of Christ. So this is
[1:13:49] you are to be honest towards them that
[1:13:51] are not Christians. Right?
[1:13:53] &gt;&gt; Why is it we think sometimes that if
[1:13:54] they're not a brother, they're not a
[1:13:55] message believer, they don't believe in
[1:13:57] the prophet, that we can just treat him
[1:13:58] however we want.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Well, my neighbor, he's just a rank
[1:14:00] heathen. I'm going to drive on his lawn.
[1:14:02] I'm not going to obey him. He told me to
[1:14:04] do this. I'm not do you're not a
[1:14:05] Christian. We can just treat people any
[1:14:07] way we want if they don't believe the
[1:14:08] message. I said, "Well, you know, he's a
[1:14:09] believer." Oh, excuse me. I'm so sorry.
[1:14:11] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:14:12] &gt;&gt; I had one one guy one time, he was a
[1:14:14] Christian. He was in theological school
[1:14:16] there in Fort Worth and they were doing
[1:14:18] he's part of a group that did a lot of
[1:14:19] investing in houses. And as an attorney,
[1:14:21] I was doing some work for him and he
[1:14:22] said, we were talking about the feed. He
[1:14:24] goes, and you know what? I'm I'm a
[1:14:25] Christian. So, what do you want? He
[1:14:27] wanted the brother deal, right? And I
[1:14:30] just said, oh, man.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; I said, I just And it said it just like
[1:14:34] this. I said, I I just can't believe it.
[1:14:37] I said, I'm I'm just so happy to finally
[1:14:40] have a client who, because I'm a
[1:14:42] Christian, is willing to pay me more for
[1:14:44] what I do.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Love it.
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; And he said, "Oh, no. I was actually
[1:14:49] thinking the other way around. But
[1:14:50] that's all I needed to say, right?
[1:14:51] Before you realize, why would I want to
[1:14:53] defraud my brother?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; He's a Christian. Why would I want to
[1:14:56] pay him less,
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Anybody needs some legal work? I think
[1:15:01] I've kind of established some
[1:15:02] expectations.
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; But this it's when we mistreat others,
[1:15:11] then we're not walking honestly towards
[1:15:13] them that are without. And then it says
[1:15:15] that ye may lack of nothing. Could it be
[1:15:18] where we lack be directly attributable
[1:15:21] to our attitude towards others?
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Walk honestly towards them that are not
[1:15:26] Christians, those that are without
[1:15:27] wisdom, though that those are without
[1:15:28] the gospel, those that don't believe. So
[1:15:30] that you won't whack for anything, God
[1:15:32] is even promising them that if you could
[1:15:34] walk uprightly, if you can be faithful
[1:15:36] to the gospel, if you could faithfully,
[1:15:38] the gospel according to the bride can
[1:15:40] truly be light emmitting, saying, "I'll
[1:15:42] take care of you."
[1:15:44] says in Galatians chapter 6:es 9 and 10,
[1:15:46] "And let us not be weary and welloing,
[1:15:48] for in due season we shall reap if we
[1:15:50] faint not. As we have therefore
[1:15:52] opportunity, let us do good unto all
[1:15:54] men, especially unto them who are of the
[1:15:57] household of faith." In other words, pay
[1:15:59] your lawyer a little bit more if he's a
[1:16:00] believer.
[1:16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:02] &gt;&gt; But he says we should do good unto all
[1:16:04] men.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:05] &gt;&gt; I know we like the especially unto them
[1:16:07] of the household of faith because we
[1:16:08] have a very specific duty to those
[1:16:11] within the household. We're to look out
[1:16:12] after one another.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; You realize if we as believers did our
[1:16:18] duty, I'm just gonna go ahead and maybe
[1:16:19] I can start evangelizing. Brother Kyre
[1:16:21] ever preached here?
[1:16:23] &gt;&gt; No. If this room could handle him,
[1:16:27] I might just start like a hound dog
[1:16:29] start sniffing something out.
[1:16:31] &gt;&gt; But if believers would just do their
[1:16:33] responsibility,
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; it would it would unbburden so many
[1:16:37] other people who end up doing
[1:16:38] everything.
[1:16:40] Did you know that if you just paid your
[1:16:43] tithe like you're supposed to,
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; the church would never lack for
[1:16:46] anything,
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; nor would the ministry.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Pay your tithes like you should, give
[1:16:51] your offers like you should, support
[1:16:52] missions like you should, and
[1:16:54] everything's going to be taken care of.
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; And the Bible teaches that families are
[1:16:58] to take care of their family.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; And that's why that's why when you lose
[1:17:02] the the bedrock of Christianity, that's
[1:17:04] why you need nursing homes.
[1:17:07] &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Bible taught you take
[1:17:08] care of your parents.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; That's not the responsibility of the
[1:17:11] church. It was a responsibility of the
[1:17:13] family to take care of the widow.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; And then if she didn't if she lacked
[1:17:18] family and there wasn't, then the church
[1:17:19] is there to take care of them.
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; There's so much that's missed out on in
[1:17:23] the gospel when we're not doing right.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; But don't be weary and welloing, but let
[1:17:29] us do good unto all men. Amen. Amen.
[1:17:33] &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 17:19, "And for their
[1:17:36] sakes I sanctify myself, sacrifice
[1:17:41] for the sake of others." The gospel
[1:17:43] according to the bride isn't the gospel
[1:17:45] of the bride. It's not the gospel for
[1:17:48] the bride. It's the gospel according to
[1:17:51] the bride.
[1:17:52] &gt;&gt; And what is her message? What is her
[1:17:55] good news? We've read enough already in
[1:17:58] this that the lives we live even in our
[1:18:01] particular absences, the things we don't
[1:18:04] do as believers and the things we will
[1:18:06] do as believers isn't so much just to
[1:18:08] identify ourselves to other believers,
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; But to identify Christ to those who
[1:18:13] aren't believers.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; And they may look at it and not want it.
[1:18:17] They may hear it and not believe in it.
[1:18:19] That's just what they're going to do.
[1:18:20] But could it be that there's one who can
[1:18:22] see your chasteed conversation and in
[1:18:24] the heart and say that looks like
[1:18:26] something that's real?
[1:18:30] &gt;&gt; He sanctified themselves for their sakes
[1:18:32] that they might be sanctified through
[1:18:33] the truth. It wasn't just sanctification
[1:18:36] for himself and also for the example but
[1:18:38] that by that example they too could be
[1:18:41] sanctified through truth.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; I'm going to close on an example of
[1:18:46] three four believers.
[1:18:49] I want to use the example of Daniel,
[1:18:50] Haniah, Aariah, and Misha. You may know
[1:18:52] them as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego.
[1:18:56] But I'm sure you're familiar with the
[1:18:58] story and most if not all look out,
[1:19:00] everybody here is well taught. And I'm
[1:19:02] sure even within your homes, you do your
[1:19:03] devotions. You read your Bible and pray
[1:19:05] and these are things you understand. But
[1:19:06] Daniel, Haniah, Azariah, Michelle,
[1:19:08] they're part of a larger group of
[1:19:10] princes and wise young men are uh born
[1:19:13] of royalty, good bloodline that are
[1:19:15] kidnapped and they're now exiled in a
[1:19:18] Calaldian uh nation, Calaldian culture
[1:19:20] in Babylon. And they attempt to
[1:19:23] brainwash them. They attempt to teach
[1:19:25] them the language to eat the food. And
[1:19:27] they're trying in every way they can to
[1:19:28] break them. It's kind of like uh Babylon
[1:19:30] boot camp
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; so that they would just obey and become
[1:19:33] these models of Calaldanss.
[1:19:36] But it says in Daniel 1:8, "Daniel
[1:19:39] purposed in his heart that he would not
[1:19:40] defile himself with the portion of the
[1:19:43] king's meat, nor with the wine which he
[1:19:44] drank. Therefore, he requested the
[1:19:46] prince of the Unix that he might not
[1:19:47] defile himself."
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:51] &gt;&gt; Just trying to see how many There's only
[1:19:52] eight ounces. I need eight more of
[1:19:54] these.
[1:20:00] You would think with humid as is here, I
[1:20:02] could just breathe and get enough water.
[1:20:06] But he purposes in his heart that he not
[1:20:08] defile himself with the king's meat, the
[1:20:11] wine, and he says, and he asked for
[1:20:13] what? Water and vegetables.
[1:20:15] What was this by Daniel? A deliberate
[1:20:18] decision to not violate God's word.
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; I was going to take the time tonight. I
[1:20:22] could show you exactly where the
[1:20:24] commandment to not drink wine pertain to
[1:20:26] him, to princes. It pertain to those who
[1:20:30] are of a good bloodline and and royal
[1:20:32] royal family. I can show you in the word
[1:20:35] of God that he could not he was to
[1:20:37] abstain from eating meat sacrificed to
[1:20:39] idols. So Daniel wasn't a vegan. No
[1:20:42] offense to our vegans here. Sorry
[1:20:44] granola crowd. But he was standing for
[1:20:46] the word of God.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; That's what he was standing for. He
[1:20:49] said, "No, the word of God says and
[1:20:51] that's what I'm going to do. I'm going
[1:20:52] to obey the word of God." So he chose
[1:20:55] not to violate what? God's statutes and
[1:20:57] God's judgments
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; in the face of pressure.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; This is where we really need to
[1:21:01] understand. There's a lot of times that
[1:21:02] Christians want to be activist and and
[1:21:05] they want to be radical about it and
[1:21:06] they want to they want to revolt.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; The word of God does not call us. Our
[1:21:12] obedience to the word of God does not
[1:21:14] require us to be revolutionary.
[1:21:17] &gt;&gt; Doesn't even require us to overthrow
[1:21:20] ungodly rulers.
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; The the religion does not command our
[1:21:24] religion does not command us to do that.
[1:21:26] maybe one of the few religions that's
[1:21:28] not advocating for violence in the face
[1:21:30] of oppression, but say take it
[1:21:31] patiently.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; And so in the face of pressure though,
[1:21:37] we can't violate God's word.
[1:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; He said, I will not violate God's word.
[1:21:42] So it says in verse 16, thus Melar took
[1:21:44] away the portion of their meat and the
[1:21:45] wine that they should drink and gave
[1:21:47] them pulse vegetables. As for these four
[1:21:50] children, God gave them knowledge and
[1:21:52] skill and all learning and wisdom. And
[1:21:54] Daniel had understanding in all visions
[1:21:56] and dreams.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; God told them, he promised them, "If
[1:21:59] you'll keep these statutes and these
[1:22:02] judgments, the Gentiles, the heathens
[1:22:04] will look at you and say, "What wisdom
[1:22:06] is there?"
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:08] &gt;&gt; What understanding, what laws, what
[1:22:09] judgments? And God is giving them
[1:22:11] according to his word. Now, at the end
[1:22:12] of the days, the king had said he was
[1:22:13] should bring them in. Then the prince of
[1:22:15] Enix brought them in before
[1:22:16] Nebuchadnezzar. And the king communed
[1:22:18] with them and among all them all and
[1:22:20] among them all was found none like
[1:22:22] Daniel, Henaniah, Misha and Azariah.
[1:22:26] Therefore stood they before the king. In
[1:22:28] other words, they he singled them out as
[1:22:29] being wise and knowledgeable.
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; And in all matters of wisdom and
[1:22:33] understanding, the king inquired them.
[1:22:34] He found them 10 times better than all
[1:22:37] the magicians and astrologers that were
[1:22:38] in all his realm.
[1:22:39] &gt;&gt; Listen, young people, you don't have to
[1:22:41] resort to the things of this world to
[1:22:42] get ahead.
[1:22:44] the the the magicians, the astrologers,
[1:22:46] all the gimmicks and the get-richqu
[1:22:48] things and all the hustling and
[1:22:49] everything the world may try to get you
[1:22:50] to do. You don't need to do that. Honor
[1:22:52] God's word.
[1:22:54] &gt;&gt; That that's your secret to success.
[1:22:56] That's how you're going to stand above
[1:22:58] the rest.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; So, here we see in this chapter one
[1:23:01] example
[1:23:03] that they make this stand for the word
[1:23:06] of God and God singles them out and
[1:23:08] blesses them.
[1:23:11] And we understand that in the next
[1:23:13] chapter the the he's his dream is unable
[1:23:16] to be interpreted. Daniel interprets the
[1:23:18] dream and the king is so uh moved by
[1:23:23] that that he commands an image of Daniel
[1:23:26] to be erected
[1:23:28] &gt;&gt; and that everyone at the sound of the
[1:23:29] music is to bow down and worship this
[1:23:32] image of Daniel. And so maybe to
[1:23:34] Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that
[1:23:36] might have been like their hero. That
[1:23:37] could have been the guy they looked up
[1:23:39] to. But they're maybe looking at us like
[1:23:40] this is our buddy. This is our brother.
[1:23:42] Uh but yet they were under the threat of
[1:23:44] death to worship this image. That would
[1:23:47] have been a violation of God's word.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; And if you are curious about Brother Bam
[1:23:53] teaches that that image was Daniel.
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; If you want to take exception to that,
[1:23:56] then just explain to me why Daniel
[1:23:58] wasn't thrown in the lion's den.
[1:23:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:02] Because then if he you would either be
[1:24:04] assuming one thing that he worshiped
[1:24:08] and that's why he wasn't subject to
[1:24:09] punishment.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; But we know that's not true.
[1:24:12] &gt;&gt; But the other thing would be if it's an
[1:24:14] image of himself, he wouldn't be
[1:24:15] required to worship it.
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; right there in the word of God. And so
[1:24:20] after they have been cast into the
[1:24:21] lion's den
[1:24:24] and they have
[1:24:26] been preserved
[1:24:28] or excuse me after they've been cast
[1:24:29] into the fiery furnace for they refused
[1:24:31] to bow down. It says in Daniel 3:es 28
[1:24:34] and 30, then Nebuchadnezzar spake and
[1:24:36] said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach,
[1:24:38] Meshach, and Abedneo, who has sent his
[1:24:40] angel and delivered his servants that
[1:24:41] trusted him and have changed the king's
[1:24:44] word and yielded their bodies that they
[1:24:46] might not serve nor worship any god
[1:24:48] except their own god."
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; This is now this is a king recognizing
[1:24:56] that this is more than just a a an
[1:24:59] aversion to red meat.
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is more than an allergy with
[1:25:02] wine,
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; This is more than just a healthy
[1:25:05] lifestyle and a nutritional mindset
[1:25:07] where they want to drink water and eat
[1:25:09] vegetables and they this is not just
[1:25:10] genetics where they excelled from
[1:25:12] everybody but they have this core
[1:25:14] conviction that will not allow them to
[1:25:16] violate God's word. And they stood there
[1:25:18] says we will not bow down to worship the
[1:25:20] image and and our God is able to save
[1:25:22] us. They evoked Elohim. They evoked
[1:25:24] Yahweh. They evoked the one true God. No
[1:25:26] other god. They said, "But even if he
[1:25:28] doesn't save us, we're still not going
[1:25:30] to violate his word."
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; So it moved Nebuchadnezzar, my blessed
[1:25:34] be the God of them. It says in Daniel
[1:25:38] 4:es 1:3, Nebuchadnezzar the king unto
[1:25:40] all people, nations, and languages that
[1:25:42] dwell in all the earth, peace be
[1:25:44] multiplied unto you. I thought it good
[1:25:46] to show the signs and wonders that the
[1:25:47] high God hath wrought toward me. How
[1:25:51] great are his signs. How mighty are his
[1:25:54] wonders.
[1:25:54] &gt;&gt; Right? His kingdom is an everlasting
[1:25:57] kingdom and his dominion is from
[1:25:58] generation to generation.
[1:26:00] &gt;&gt; He's saying things that Jews hadn't said
[1:26:04] in the Bible.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; He is prophesying. He is glorifying the
[1:26:08] Lord. This is a gentile king. How great
[1:26:10] is his signs. We sing these words.
[1:26:13] &gt;&gt; These are the words of a a heathen king
[1:26:15] who says, "Mighty are his wonders. His
[1:26:17] kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. And
[1:26:18] his kingdom shall know no end."
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; And his glory shall know no bounds. from
[1:26:24] generation to generation. How great is
[1:26:25] this God? Mighty are his wonders.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Begins to praise the Lord.
[1:26:34] Then notice here in verse 28 of that
[1:26:36] chapter, and all this came upon King
[1:26:38] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:26:39] at the end of 12 months. He walked in
[1:26:41] the palace of the kingdom of Babylon.
[1:26:43] King spake and said, because God's
[1:26:44] blessing him, he's he's giving honor to
[1:26:47] the one true God. Is it not is not this
[1:26:50] king great Babylon that I have built for
[1:26:53] the house of the kingdom by the might of
[1:26:55] my power and for the honor of my majesty
[1:26:58] while the word was in the king's mouth
[1:27:00] there fell a voice from heaven saying oh
[1:27:02] king Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken
[1:27:04] the kingdom is departed from thee
[1:27:08] and they shall drive thee from men and
[1:27:11] thy dwelling shall be with the beast of
[1:27:12] the field
[1:27:14] &gt;&gt; it shall make thee to eat grasses oxen
[1:27:16] and seven times shall pass over thee
[1:27:17] until thou know that the Most High
[1:27:19] ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth
[1:27:21] it to whomsoever he will. I want you to
[1:27:24] recognize this.
[1:27:27] I want to read in uh chapter five. Come
[1:27:29] back to chapter four. Just I want to
[1:27:31] read a little bit more in five and four.
[1:27:32] I think we're doing good on time, I
[1:27:34] think. So, I want to finish the story of
[1:27:36] Nebuchadnezzar, but I want to pause here
[1:27:38] and make this point. God is dealing with
[1:27:41] Nebuchadnezzar as a son.
[1:27:44] &gt;&gt; He's not dealing with him as a heathen
[1:27:45] king and just ripping it away and
[1:27:46] tearing him up. He's saying, "I'm I'm
[1:27:48] going to deal with you until you will
[1:27:50] come to your senses and say that God
[1:27:52] rules the kingdom of men."
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:54] &gt;&gt; That he gives to whomsoever he will. The
[1:27:56] same hour was the thing fulfilled upon
[1:27:57] Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from
[1:27:59] men and did eat grass and ox. His body
[1:28:01] was wet with the dew of heaven till his
[1:28:02] hairs were grown like eagle's feathers
[1:28:04] and his nails like bird's claws. Madness
[1:28:07] came over.
[1:28:11] Daniel chapter 5 17 to 24
[1:28:15] says then then Daniel answered and said
[1:28:17] before the king let thy gifts be to
[1:28:19] thyself
[1:28:20] give thy rewards to another yet I will
[1:28:23] read the writing of the king
[1:28:26] make known to him the interpretation so
[1:28:28] now we see maybe I should I don't know
[1:28:30] if I need to read more but we know where
[1:28:32] we are in the scripture
[1:28:35] says oh thou king the most high God gave
[1:28:38] Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and
[1:28:40] majesty and glory glory and honor.
[1:28:43] So, Belshazzar
[1:28:48] in his feast and in his feasting, is
[1:28:51] everybody familiar with the story? I
[1:28:52] don't know if I need to go through this
[1:28:53] more. I'm just realizing maybe now I'm
[1:28:55] assuming too much in terms of what the
[1:28:57] scripture speaks of, but Nebuchadnezzar
[1:28:58] is no longer king. This is in the next
[1:29:00] chapter. And he's throwing a feast and
[1:29:03] he's feasting after the false gods and
[1:29:05] he's worshiping false gods. And in doing
[1:29:08] so,
[1:29:10] there's writing on the wall and he's
[1:29:13] being judged. God's going to judge him.
[1:29:15] And this is the this is what the David
[1:29:18] Daniel says. Oh thou king, the most high
[1:29:20] God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a
[1:29:22] kingdom and majesty and glory and honor.
[1:29:25] Please just stay with me. If I'm
[1:29:26] fumbling around, I apologize. And for
[1:29:28] the majesty that he gave him, all
[1:29:29] people, nations, and languages trembled
[1:29:31] and feared before him, whom he would
[1:29:34] would sue, and whom he would kept alive,
[1:29:36] and whom he would set up, and whom he
[1:29:38] would put down. But when his heart was
[1:29:40] lifted up, and his mind hardened in
[1:29:42] pride, he was disposed from his kingly
[1:29:44] throne, and they took his glory from
[1:29:46] him. And he was driven from the sons of
[1:29:48] men, and his heart was made like the
[1:29:50] beast, as dwelling as with was with the
[1:29:52] wild asses. They fed him with grass like
[1:29:54] oxen and his body was wet with the dew
[1:29:56] of heaven till he knew that the most
[1:29:58] high God ruled in the kingdom of men and
[1:30:00] that he appointed over it whomsoever he
[1:30:02] will.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; So what God said would happen in Daniel
[1:30:06] 4 happens to Nebuchadnezzar and he
[1:30:09] remains in that condition until he knows
[1:30:12] and he realizes the error of his ways
[1:30:13] and he says God rules in the kingdom of
[1:30:16] men. So look what had been done in the
[1:30:18] eyes of Belshazzar his father. It says
[1:30:20] Nebuchadnezzar thy father had a kingdom
[1:30:22] that God had given him. So let's go back
[1:30:24] to verse 34 in Daniel chapter 4. And at
[1:30:27] the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar
[1:30:29] lifted up mine eyes unto heaven. So it
[1:30:32] says that he did eat grass as oxen. His
[1:30:35] body was wet with the dew. His hairs
[1:30:36] were like eagle's feathers. His nails
[1:30:37] like bird claws. He'd completely given
[1:30:39] over to madness and and to act
[1:30:41] amalistic. But now at the end of the
[1:30:42] days says, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up
[1:30:45] mine eyes into heaven and my
[1:30:47] understanding returned unto me and I
[1:30:49] blessed the most high.
[1:30:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; And I praised and honored him that
[1:30:52] liveth forever whose dominion is an
[1:30:54] everlasting dominion and his kingdom is
[1:30:56] from generation to generation. He's come
[1:30:58] back to his conviction again. Come back
[1:31:00] to that utterance he gave when he saw
[1:31:01] the power of God and the glory. That
[1:31:03] moment when I could say his heart turned
[1:31:05] to the Lord. Away from making images of
[1:31:07] the prophet, away from making images to
[1:31:09] false gods. He said, "There's the one
[1:31:11] true God. Let us give him honor, let him
[1:31:12] give his glory." And he comes back to
[1:31:14] that core revelation. His kingdom is
[1:31:16] forever.
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; And all the inhabitants of the earth are
[1:31:20] reputed as nothing. And he doeth
[1:31:22] according to his will in the army of
[1:31:24] heaven and among the inhabitants of the
[1:31:25] earth. And none can stay his hand or say
[1:31:28] him, "What doest thou?" At the same
[1:31:30] time, my reason returned me. This is his
[1:31:32] testimony. And for the glory of my
[1:31:34] kingdom, my honor and brightness
[1:31:35] returned unto me, and my counselss and
[1:31:37] my lords sought unto me. And I was
[1:31:38] established in my kingdom, and excellent
[1:31:40] majesty was added unto me. Now I,
[1:31:42] Nebuchadnezzar,
[1:31:44] praise and extol and honor the king of
[1:31:46] heaven.
[1:31:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:48] &gt;&gt; All whose works are truth, and his ways
[1:31:50] judgment, and those that walk in pride,
[1:31:52] he is able to abase.
[1:31:55] &gt;&gt; There may be times when our gospel is
[1:31:57] muted. There may be things we do and we
[1:31:58] make our mistakes. We get lifted up in
[1:32:00] pride, we fall. Maybe we find ourselves
[1:32:02] wandering a little bit, but we've got to
[1:32:03] come back to this revelation and this
[1:32:05] gospel and declaration. It's not about
[1:32:08] excusing me myself,
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; Well, I just wanted to go undercover
[1:32:11] like a madman and I this is the God
[1:32:13] doing this. This is the evil things.
[1:32:14] This is the government. This is this is
[1:32:16] no, he acknowledged that his judgments
[1:32:18] were because of his own pride.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; But he came back to that great
[1:32:22] exaltation of God. Bless the most high.
[1:32:26] Now I praise and extol and honor the
[1:32:28] king of heaven. Amen.
[1:32:30] &gt;&gt; All whose works are truth and his ways
[1:32:32] judgment. What he does is just. What he
[1:32:34] says is truth. He says there's no
[1:32:36] arguing with him. And those that walk in
[1:32:38] pride as I did, he is able and he will
[1:32:40] obease.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; God dealt with him as a son. He came
[1:32:44] back to his mind. And this is his
[1:32:45] gospel.
[1:32:47] And this is the example that Daniel is
[1:32:49] saying.
[1:32:51] The most high God gave your father
[1:32:53] majesty, glory, and honor. And what did
[1:32:56] Nebuchadnezzar? What was his witness in
[1:32:57] testament? not all his majesty, glory,
[1:32:59] and honor, but it went to the king. So
[1:33:02] Daniel continues in verse 22, "And
[1:33:03] thou," verse chapter 5, "And thou his
[1:33:06] son, and thou his son, oh Bazar, hast
[1:33:08] not humbled thine heart, though thou
[1:33:10] kneest all this."
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; What did he know? There was a good God.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; What do you know? There was a God of
[1:33:17] truth and a God of righteousness. What
[1:33:18] do you know? There was one true God, the
[1:33:20] King of heaven.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; One who set the affairs of man that no
[1:33:24] one no one should trifle with. says,
[1:33:26] "You knew all this, but hast lifted up
[1:33:28] thyself against the Lord of heaven, and
[1:33:30] they have brought the vessels of his
[1:33:32] house before thee, and thou, and thy
[1:33:34] lords, thy wives, and thy concubines,
[1:33:36] and have drunk wine in them. Thou has
[1:33:37] praised the gods of silver, and of gold,
[1:33:39] and of brass, of iron, wood, and stone,
[1:33:40] which see not, nor hear nor know, and
[1:33:43] the God in whose hand thy breath is, and
[1:33:46] whose are all thy ways hast thou not
[1:33:48] glorified."
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; And he says, "You knew better." How do
[1:33:51] you know better? His dad did.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; His dad glorified him. Had he been
[1:33:55] raised in a heathen nation, had he not
[1:33:57] seen the example, had there not been a
[1:33:59] witness in Babylon that the king had
[1:34:01] received, then this judgment wouldn't be
[1:34:03] written this way. But he knew better.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; Then was the part of the hand sent from
[1:34:09] him and this writing was written because
[1:34:12] you rejected the gospel that was
[1:34:14] witnessed to you.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; How was it witnessed? Did Belshazzar
[1:34:17] have to go to a temple? Did he have to
[1:34:19] go to school? Did he have to be taught
[1:34:20] in it? No. He saw it lived,
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; right? He saw the example of it. And
[1:34:24] they took all these vessels and they
[1:34:27] worshiped drunkenly worshiped silver,
[1:34:30] gold, brass, iron, wood, stone,
[1:34:35] and did not glorify God.
[1:34:42] And the example they saw was the gospel
[1:34:44] according to Nebuchadnezzar
[1:34:48] who could testify the goodness of God.
[1:34:55] Not everyone will listen.
[1:34:57] Not all will take heed. But I I I I'm
[1:35:02] not a king. I never have a kingdom like
[1:35:03] Nebuchadnezzar's. But I want to be the
[1:35:05] type that if I fall, if I make a
[1:35:06] mistake, if I go, if I begin to act out
[1:35:08] of character, Lord, let me come back
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; to recognize what pride can do to the
[1:35:12] gospel, what it can do to my witness,
[1:35:14] what it can do to my testimony. And the
[1:35:15] only way to restore it is to not make
[1:35:17] excuses, but come back and say, "I've I
[1:35:19] repent." Amen.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I've made a mistake.
[1:35:24] The gospel according to the bride is the
[1:35:27] voice of God to the world.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; It's for the lost,
[1:35:35] for the hurting. It's for the the
[1:35:37] unsaved, the unbelieving. It's not for
[1:35:39] ourselves, but it's for the glory of
[1:35:41] Christ.
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; We ought to live it that way,
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; unselfishly.
[1:35:47] And as much as you may know that you're
[1:35:50] to be a witness
[1:35:53] and and and know that that's part of the
[1:35:56] working out of the third pool in our
[1:35:57] lives is how we witness to others.
[1:36:01] But the best thing we could do is live
[1:36:03] the witness
[1:36:05] &gt;&gt; and live the life.
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; Because if you're not living the life
[1:36:08] and you try to sit down with the family
[1:36:09] member and kind of explain to them where
[1:36:11] they're wrong in their religion, they
[1:36:12] may look at you and be like,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; "Child, seriously,
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; I'm more faithful to my wife.
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; I pay my taxes.
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; I I I I do good to others." And you're
[1:36:25] going to tell me I'm a trin because I'm
[1:36:26] a trinitarian. I'm worshiping the devil.
[1:36:30] It's lost.
[1:36:32] &gt;&gt; The gospel's muted when we don't live
[1:36:35] it.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; Challenge you tonight. You'll be glad
[1:36:38] that I'm leaving, I guess, tomorrow.
[1:36:40] Challenge you tonight to live this
[1:36:42] truth. It's a beautiful truth.
[1:36:43] &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Sister Cheryl,
[1:36:45] if you could come to your instrument,
[1:36:47] sister
[1:36:51] Trisha, you just the ones that are
[1:36:53] playing, just come. Let's just bow our
[1:36:55] heads in a word of prayer and we'll just
[1:36:56] turn it over to your pastor. your
[1:36:58] gracious heavenly father tonight. Maybe
[1:36:59] we've taken a lot of time, but I trust
[1:37:03] that it's been engaging in a positive
[1:37:05] way for everyone.
[1:37:07] &gt;&gt; What I ask tonight as we consider these
[1:37:09] things that is certainly with the
[1:37:11] foundation of what brother Gideon
[1:37:12] preached because Lord, this is not
[1:37:15] this is just not repeating the gospels.
[1:37:17] Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; This is not just trying to read the red
[1:37:20] letter and pretend uh you know that or
[1:37:24] just to remark that Jesus is alive and
[1:37:27] he died for our sins, but this is a
[1:37:29] living word. This is a living truth.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; A truth that's been restored, a truth
[1:37:33] that's been revealed in this hour.
[1:37:36] &gt;&gt; We're talking about a God that is
[1:37:38] present, that has declared himself alive
[1:37:40] and well, still confirms through signs
[1:37:42] and wonders his word.
[1:37:45] So Lord, this witness that we have, this
[1:37:47] gospel that we preach is is not history.
[1:37:50] It's not fortuneelling,
[1:37:53] but it's Christ the same yesterday,
[1:37:55] today, and forever.
[1:37:58] And Lord, we are to
[1:38:00] convict the sinner, make whole the
[1:38:03] broken,
[1:38:07] to save the lost, heal the sick, and use
[1:38:10] words if necessary.
[1:38:12] For truly, Lord, our lives can live the
[1:38:15] gospel.
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; And in living it first, give more weight
[1:38:19] if we have to use our words.
[1:38:23] May we have the heart of a witness
[1:38:26] to reach the ear and the heart of the
[1:38:29] one who hears
[1:38:33] so that we can be faithful works.
[1:38:36] that as we are rendered and set on
[1:38:39] display, the glory does not go to the
[1:38:42] church. It does not go to the pastor. It
[1:38:43] does not go to me, the person, the the
[1:38:46] viewer, the frame. It doesn't go to the
[1:38:48] painting or the work. It goes to you.
[1:38:51] &gt;&gt; And I pray Lord that in this church
[1:38:54] there will be souls saved
[1:38:57] &gt;&gt; because the lives that are lived
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; by the members here.
[1:39:01] May it be Lord that the next time we
[1:39:03] have this precious opportunity to be
[1:39:05] together, we will witness souls will
[1:39:08] hear the testimony of those who've been
[1:39:09] baptized in the name of Lord Jesus
[1:39:10] Christ and it'll be because the light
[1:39:13] shined unto them.
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; It convicted their heart and they're
[1:39:17] converted and now they glorify you.
[1:39:20] Lord, may there not be a Belshazzar
[1:39:22] who's now accountable because the gospel
[1:39:25] has been lived before them. And they
[1:39:28] knew better, but they did not glorify
[1:39:31] you.
[1:39:33] Lord, think about it. Bible says that
[1:39:35] when they knew God, they glorified him
[1:39:38] not as God.
[1:39:40] Leads me to believe that they know,
[1:39:45] but they choose to deny him.
[1:39:49] Lord, let us not ever get lifted up in
[1:39:50] pride. May we give you the glory. May we
[1:39:52] recognize your goodness to us. We give
[1:39:55] you the praise. We give you the honor.
[1:39:56] We repeat these words of the king. Your
[1:39:59] kingdom shall know no end.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Your dominion is everlasting from
[1:40:03] generation to generation. Thou art the
[1:40:04] king of heaven.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to give you the praise
[1:40:08] that's due your name. We lift you up. We
[1:40:09] exalt you. We glorify you. Lord, now
[1:40:12] glorify us,
[1:40:15] Lord. We want to walk honestly towards
[1:40:16] those that are without. We want to walk
[1:40:18] in wisdom to those that without.
[1:40:19] &gt;&gt; For we recognize that in doing so, we
[1:40:22] faithfully represent your heart and your
[1:40:24] character and we give you the glory, not
[1:40:25] ourselves,
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; but yet it's a benefit for somebody
[1:40:28] else. And Father, you said that if we do
[1:40:30] that, we won't lack for anything.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; May we acknowledge today that perhaps
[1:40:34] it's our failure to be an accurate
[1:40:37] witness that has resulted in what we
[1:40:39] lack. We commit all things to you
[1:40:41] tonight, Lord. I pray that this is
[1:40:43] received as coming from a sincere heart,
[1:40:45] Lord, with no nothing intended, not
[1:40:46] meddling in anything, Lord, just trying
[1:40:48] to preach the gospel.
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:40:50] &gt;&gt; Bless this church. Bless its pastor and
[1:40:51] its family, those that labor and serve
[1:40:53] here.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; Lord, I see many familiar faces that are
[1:40:57] just be faithful here now coming for the
[1:40:59] word of God. May you increase L or
[1:41:02] increase them not so much in numbers
[1:41:04] Lord
