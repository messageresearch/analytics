all things are possible only believe only believe only believe all things are possible only be let's just sing Lord reveal yourself to me amen reveal yourself to me reveal yourself to me all things

here hallelujah all things are possible Jesus is here Jesus is here Jesus is here and all things are possible Jesus is here God bless you amen praise the Lord amen well we have a a late announcement always like late announcements right so uh brother Gabriel tari have a a church in an arbor it's called Little Flock and they're having a Memorial Day picnic at Hudson Mills Metro Park they had one last year brother Beckman and I were both there we had a great time lots of food so you'd be blessed to come so we're going to put this out in the back we want you to know about that amen so I don't have to ask you if you love him because if you didn't and you came then you get a gold star amen if you don't love God and you came that's that's important i' like you to turn with me this evening to uh Romans chapter n praise the Lord amen amen Romans chapter 9 and starting with verse 14 it says what shall we say then is there unrighteousness with God God forbid for he saith to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion so then it is not of him that willth nor him that runneth but of God that showeth Mercy for the scripture saith unto Pharaoh even for this same purpose have I raised thee up that I might show my power in thee and that my name might be declared throughout all the Earth therefore hath he Mercy on whom he will have mercy and whom he will he hardeneth and thou Willl then say unto me why do he then find fault for who hath resisted his will nay but oh man who art thou that repliest against God shall the thing formed say to him that formed it why hast Thou made me thus hath not the Potter power over the clay and of the same lump to make one vessel unto honor and another unto dishonor what if God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the the vessels of Mercy which Heath for prepared unto Glory even us whom he hath called not of the Jews only but also of the Gentiles let's bow our heads for word of prayer dear Lord Jesus we're so grateful Lord that you called us Lord we're so thankful father tonight that we could have ears to hear Lord I pray that you just come and be merciful to us and may you walk amongst us may you open your word to us may you speak to us plainly Lord that we can just walk uprightly before you and serve you with a pure heart in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen you may be seated praise the Lord so I'd like to speak for a little while on a a successful walk amen when I when I read these scriptures these scriptures are always real sobering to me because I always wonder if in my failures is God going to cast me away and when I hear you know that that there'll come a time when when we'll come before the Lord and the Lord will start to talk to us and we go but Lord I didn't I I I did this for you and I did that for you and I did that for you and and God says depart from me I didn't even know you that is a very sobering and scary thought what is a successful walk what is a righteous walk before the Lord amen because the Bible here in verse 15 he says he says God said to Moses I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy and I will compassion on him who I will have compassion well I want to be on that good side but it's God that does the choosing and then Paul recognizing that and he's talking to the young believers in Rome the Roman Church there he says he said you know he says then you will say to me then why does God condemn me for sin in my life why does he do that why does why didn't he give me a better chance and I can see that from these scriptures that there's not much hope for me amen cuz he says you can't can't even say to the Potter why did you make me like this why what what choice did I have in the matter and he says what is God willing to show his wrath and to make his power known endured with much such much longsuffering the vessels of Wrath fitted to destruction and that he might make known The Riches of his glory on the vessels of Mercy which he had before prepared unto glory amen even us Amen brother Brenham made this interesting statement which I just you just have to bear with me you know because we always got to lay a little bit of foundation before we can go and a lot of us might be W you know a lot of times I wonder I say Lord am I Pharaoh are you raising me up that I that I you're just going to destroy me in the end brother Brenham said you know when you think about God when you keep your mind oh you think he says think about it you said in church and you think about everything else but God how are you going to do your washing and what you're going to do at the office tomorrow and and how you're going to do this that or the other keep your mind off of that and think on God Amen I mean when you come when when your wife or you know you go somewhere and you've been working all day and you you go to the well you don't go to the drive-through window but you you go to the restaurant and everything and and you're going to get down and you're going to sit down and have a meal the very first thing you do is you go and you wash your hands because like brother Dennis had really dirty hands tonight and when we come into church this is a spiritual meal that we've come to right we need to wash our hands so it's good to greet one another and everything and talk of you know take say your peace and everything else but then you go in the prayer room and you wash your hands and that's wonderful that you're washing your spiritual hands your spiritual heart but then when you come back out and you start talking about the things of the world you've just got your hands all dirty again and how can you come in and and then try to worship God it's what if God is is watching us amen keep your mind off of those things and think on God and the Bible says if there be any praise if there be any virtue think on these things wonder wonder if I'll be called in the prayer line wonder if God will even speak to me I wonder how many tonight came and said oh I wonder if God will even have anything does he even know that I showed up because he's got to speak to my heart because if he doesn't speak to my heart then I'm going out just as hard as I came when I came in amen praise the Lord he says now brother brandham says I wonder if I'll be called in the prayer line I wonder if God will speak he says don't think that kind of negative thought how are you going to do that if your focus is on not going in the prayer room and we're not we're not talking it's you know God doesn't have a a this isn't like when I go to work course when I when I got into management I've been on salary for so long people used to talk to me about overtime they said don't they pay you time and a half I said oh I know it's in my base pay I guess I said so I work all the time I just I just show up I don't have to punch a clock but when I come here and I go in the prayer room and I spend God isn't looking did you spend two minutes in there well you got to spend three or I'm not going to hear you you got to spend 12 or no but brother I got to wash my hands and I got to find a way to do that and I want to be a success amen so brother brandom said he said in here he says so he says Abraham it was becoming to Abraham to separate himself from unbelief and it's becoming to any believer to separate yourself from unbelief Abraham it was becoming to him to walk in a Land of his own him and God and when brother brandham says becoming in here he's talking about that it was a reflection it was something that was when God called Abraham to come out Earth the ches then it was becoming it was it was a result of that call Abraham walked in that word that Revelation and when he walked in that it manifested what God had spoke to him amen so he said it it was becoming to him to walk in a Land of his own him and God alone because he was a prophet and the world didn't understand why Abraham made such a choice why'd he leave his home why'd he leave his church why'd he leave his people why did he do such a rational thing to sourn in a Strange Land when there's no food there's no water why did he go into these Bleak deserts where men had not went yet but it was becoming to him for he was a prophet to separate himself from all unbelief and to walk alone with God and God said separate yourself and I'll bless you amen amen and I always struggle every time even when I hear it today I heard it today on the tape and I was working out and and brother Brandon was quoting that scripture you know if you if you love the world or the things of the world you're toast you are Pharaoh how many things do we do how many things do we do involves the world amen but remember we want to talk about a successful walk God when he calls people he calls for a total separation from all the things of the world Annihilation from the worldly things that is big that is annihilation of all worldly things amen separate yourself and God will bless you come out from among them be not partakers of their sins yoke yourself not among unbelievers but yoke yourself with Believers fellow citizens of the Kingdom amen how am I even going to be the Abraham the elect the bride of Christ in this age what is it that I'm going to somehow sacrifice that I can be in that called out number and if there is a Bible question there has to be a Bible answer amen and if you've never thought on these things I'm making you thinking about them tonight because every time I read Romans 9 I go God said I raised up pharaoh and put him in a position of authority blessings servants money a great place to live food on the table he raised him up to that place that he might Harden him at the appropriate time what if you're that pharaoh amen so I want to go tonight to go to Isaiah 43 we're going to start we're going to look at some scriptures in Isaiah amen praise the Lord Isaiah 43 verse1 it says but now thus saith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have called thee by thy name Thou Art mine I love that God is thus sayith the Lord you know what that is that's forever settled and God speaking here he says he says thus sayith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel fear not for I have redeemed thee you didn't do anything about it he did he created you he brought you into this world as some mothers used to say I brought you into this world I can take you out now I wouldn't say there's any mothers like that here but but you know that's what but God created Jacob and he brought him into the world and he said you know what Jacob he says I have redeemed thee praise the Lord amen he says when thou passest through the waters I will be with thee praise the Lord amen he says and through the rivers they shall not overflow thee I'm not even going to drown in this mess amen amen they shall not overflow thee and when thou wst through the fire thou shall not be burned hallelujah amen neither shall the flame Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy God the Holy One of Israel thy savior praise God amen amen now when I look at this I'm excited amen and when I look at verse one put verse one back up there I want you to look at verse one he says but now thus sayith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob and he that formed thee o Israel wait a minute Jacob and Israel's the selfsame person we're not talking about two people here we're just talking about one turn over a couple of scriptures or to chapter 5 and we want to look at verse four he says here he says for Jacob my servant's sake and Israel mine elect I have even called thee by thy name and I have surnamed thee though thou Hast not known me amen God created Jacob and he created Jacob for a purpose and he call Israel amen amen God even called him by his name so if we're going to understand this we've got to go back here a little bit to the Book of Genesis praise God Amen in Genesis 32 and verse 24 it says and Jacob was left alone now Jacob had spent his whole life you know he he stole the birthright we know that and he tricked his father into doing that and his father actually knew that he had tricked him because his father if you go back and you look at the scriptures but we're not preaching about that but we'll find out that when Jacob went into his father he had put uh some wool on his arms to make himself look hairy and he he put some perfume on to make him smell like the field and he went in with the Venison and daddy said to his son his very deceitful son he said uh you got the venison awfully fast he said oh yeah the Lord blessed me really well and I I I shot the bow and I killed the venison right away and it was a sheep that he that was it was disguised you know you can do a lot with spices and he came in with a sheep right and he gave it to his dad and his dad come here he says come here he says because my eyes are blind he said ' let me feel you H and he kind of feeling him he said let me smell your neck he said you know this is a funny thing he said you feel like uh Esau and you smell like Esau but you got the voice of Jacob I don't get it Daddy knew Jacob went off to the land of you Mesopotamia and he went over and he he met up with laan and and he had a very successful life he he had he got a lot of things he got sheep and and he had a what if fact had two wives and then he got some concubines and he had a pel of kids and and he had money and he had a whole bunch of things and everything else but there came a time when God called for a reckoning God called calls man to a reckoning man thinks he's got everything and that he can get it he can do whatever he wants and else but God's going to call us to a reckoning and we saw that in Romans n he said I will show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and I will show compassion on whom I will show compassion and he says in fact he says I can raise people up and I can put people down because I am God and I don't need counsel I don't need your opinion I don't need your ideas because I already know you I already know what's in your heart I already know what you're thinking tonight and when you came in service tonight you probably weren't thinking this but you need to know what the scripture says so Jacob he he was going back and he realized that now he had he he's his Mommy and Daddy they had passed away and he says now I gotta I got to meet up with my brother Esau and Esau's a pretty big guy he's kind of like brother Marty and compared to me I'm little with brother Marty you know and and I'm a little bit afraid of that so Jacob thought I'll I'll connive a plan and that's the problem with us we're always conniving a plan we're going to come up with a plan I'm going to come up with a plan and what I'm going to do is I'm going to send all of the blessings that God has given me I'm going to I'm going to pass them by Esau and and and when he sees all the blessings and how I'm prosperous and maybe his greed will get the better of him and he'll think I can bless him too maybe he'll think that'll be you know and then he'll see my wives and my kids and he'll take pity on me because you know these babies are really cute they are mothers grandmas they melt for babies they they love that stuff amen so he he took them all over there and in verse 24 it says and Jacob was left alone and there Wrestled a man with him until the breaking of the day now you think they just sat down and maybe talked but I'm telling you right now Jacob was fighting for his life this guy was punching him and he was punching him back and they were down on the ground and wrestling and kicking each other in the grin and in the in the side and in the they were they were going at it and they were fighting Jacob knew this was a time he had to make the right kind of decision amen and it says here it says and when he saw that he prevailed not against him so when this this man this unnamed man saw that he prevailed not against Jacob Jacob was so serious about what he was doing that the angel realized he wasn't he needed an extra little thing to do to Jacob and he reached over and he touched him in the thigh and popped his hip joint out and that hurt and Jacob didn't like that but Jacob didn't let go Jacob didn't let go even in all that pain all that trial he didn't let go and and they angel said to him he says let me go for the day cometh the day breakthe said to him and says I'm not going to let you go except you bless me you have got to do something because my brother's about to kill me amen and he said unto him what is thy name and he said Jacob and he said thy name Shall be Called no more Jacob but Israel for as a prince hast thou power with God and with men and has prevailed it's the only place in the scriptures where a man has won he has prevailed over God Jacob prevailed over God and God looked at Jacob and said he's got something that I'm looking for and he popped his knee out or his his thigh out and the Bible says God didn't heal him either because he had a point that's something he wanted him to know and Jacob limped the rest of his days till he died he probably asked God a lot of times said God what why don't you heal me of this thing God M NOP nope so it's a funny thing now we see let's let's go back to Isaiah 43 and and let's look at this again I'm going to spend just a moment here I can find Isaiah again Isaiah 43:1 says but now thus saith the Lord that created thee oh Jacob God was the one that created Jacob's fleshly body God created him God brought him into the world God gave him a family God gave him a mother and a father and a brother God did that but God also formed thee o Israel and the Israel the prince with God wasn't the guy with the limp it was the elected predestinated seed that was in his heart Jacob was the outward man and Israel was that seed on the inside that said I'm not leaving till you bless me I'm not leaving till I get the Holy Ghost with all I want it I'm not leaving till you answer my prayer I'm not leaving till you change my life he's not looking at the outward man he's looking at the inward man amen praise the Lord amen so I'm going to go to Exodus 3 so a lot of people when you know when they come to the Lord they it's always it's a battle they when they come to the Lord they they they got all kinds of carnal ideas they got all kinds of things but we're going to take a look in the scriptures tonight and we're going to watch how that we're hidden in here amen amen in Exodus 3 starting with verse 6 it says moreover he said now this is Moses he's at the burning bush Okay so so we've got our foundation stones in place he says moreover the burning bush the fire it says I am the god of thy father the god of Abraham the god of Isaac and the god of Jacob not the god of Israel the god of Jacob the god of the flesh ly man the guy that had the DNA that Abraham had the guy that had the bloodline the guy that had the promise was to and the god of Jacob and Moses hid his face for he was afraid to look upon God you know see that's a that's the mystery that's always the mystery how you can come in church and not watch your hands or wash your hands and then just get all mess and then spend half the service looking at your phone and and you know turn it off you're meeting God don't you know God is here if you're looking at your phone you don't believe what I just said and you're all looking at me like I'm crazy I was a senior executive where they wanted to know everywhere I was at just ask my wife hey don't you ever turn your phone off Bruce but God we are coming when Moses stood before the burning bush I imagine he was terrified this wasn't just a little friendly talk I am the god of Abraham I am the god of Isaac I am the god of Jacob amen and Moses hid his face and the Lord had said I have surely seen the Affliction of my people which are in Egypt and I have heard their Cry by reason of their taskmasters for I know their sorrows and I have come down to deliver them out of the hand of Egypt out of the Egyptians and to bring them up out of the land unto a good land and a large unto a land flowing with milk and honey under the place of the Canaanites and the Hittites and the amorites and the perizzites and the hivites and the jebusites and you notice if you go back and just take a good look and underline Isaiah 43 God gives a gives a promise in there he says I am the one that redeemed you I am the one I can protect you in the storm I can protect you in the fire I can protect you in the flood I am God I change not my promises are yay and amen it has to become part of our Lives amen amen and he says he talks about here he says a land flowing with milk and honey in a place he says now therefore Behold The Cry of the children of Israel not the Cry of Jacob not the Cry of the flesh you know because Jacob had a lineage but but everybody that's called Jacob is in Israel God didn't hear Jacob's cry God heard the elect cry he said Jacob my servant Israel my elect isn't that what we read you do believe the scriptures right he says is come unto me and I have also seen the oppression wherewith the Egyptians oppressed them come now therefore and I will send thee under Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my people the children of Jacob you know you wonder about that you I tell Don I don some I we go home and we talk because we had a long drive to go home and I say you know it's really a funny thing I mean you know 3 million people coming up out of is you know coming up out of Egypt they all came up there but but they weren't all the children of Israel they were the children of Jacob it was the children of Jacob that came out of there I want you to skip down here to Exodus 4 amen Exodus 4 and verse 22 I thought brother darl Ward I thought he was going to preach some of the things that I saw last week I said otana I said I'm seeing things and brother Daryl he was he was kind of dancing around it well let me show you this verse 22 and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh thus sayith the Lord Israel is my my son but I am the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob why didn't he called Jacob his son because Jacob was his servant but Israel was his amen Israel is my son even my first born that was Esau's mistake Esau thought that when that when Jacob asked for the birthright that there was no way absolutely no way that Esau would you know how many I [Music] know gi's got kids he's got lots of kids now Ryan and Lori have children and you have children and we we there's children here my firstborn is Rebecca and and Ruth which is my second born she can never become the firstborn I don't care what you do she's the firstborn jonath Jonathan's the no jonath Abigail's the firstborn so Jonathan can't become the firstborn so Esau's mistake was he said yeah so what if you want the birthright he said I've got the birthright cuz I'm the first born I it don't matter what I do with it it does matter it does matter it mattered to God and God right here testifying says Israel is my firstborn what happened to Jacob God's not saving Jacob amen I say unto thee let my son go that he may serve me and if thou refuse to let him go beh behold I will slay thy son even thy firstborn amen I'll take him out amen so brother bham said he says so now we're going to take a talk about a journey how that God brought his people out of Egypt into the promised land and it's a perfect type of leaving sin and coming into the spirit amen now there's three stages of this journey first Israel is in Egypt Israel and Jacob is the same person I don't know why they call it Israel why didn't they call it Jacob was in Egypt because God wasn't looking at the natural man God was looking at the spiritual man he was looking at the guy on the inside amen Israel was in Egypt Israel in the journey Israel in Palestine which is a perfect type of justification by faith coming out sanctification as it passed through the blood and the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's perfect the stages of the church that is where the church is staged now amen amen praise the Lord so there in five Junctions of time brother bam say so there down there in Egypt and how he performed those signs and wonders and the things that he had done he is God none can take his place so now we're going to talk about what happened in Romans 9 because Romans 9 talks about Pharaoh talks about how God hardened Pharaoh's heart amen but you know in in Romans n it doesn't talk much about Israel and he don't talk about Jacob but he talks about Pharaoh praise the Lord amen none can take his place notice God performed his Miracle he gave Pharaoh a chance and Pharaoh failed and refused to take his chance and then there was nothing left and when a man spurns the mercy of God there's only one thing left and that's judgment and my dear friend today God helping us when you see the end of this text come and if you spurn the mercy that's offered to you today by Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost there will be nothing left but Divine judgment and and there can't be nothing left Pharaoh finally send away his day of Grace and there wasn't nothing left because the junction was at hand God blessed Jacob in Egypt 400 years Jacob was in Egypt they went down there and they they built houses they had families they had successful businesses they forgot about God they read the promise every once in a while they got up and read Abraham's prophecy you know they went to church they were good people you know but God had a time he had a time when he was going to call for that elected seed he was going to call for Israel he was going to call for him but Israel was hid inside of Jacob he was hid inside of him and what I thought when I started seeing that I started looking and said oh look at that he's taking them to the promised land and you know who's in the promised land Baptist Pentecostals Presbyterian Catholic couple different kinds of Catholics hundreds of them 900 denominations there's all kinds of people living in the promised land all trying to discourage Israel from possessing the land amen amen those those denominations weren't in Egypt they weren't in Egypt Jacob was in Egypt you were in Egypt we were all in Egypt but there was something inside amen amen I love this Isaiah F or Exodus 5 verse one it says and after Moses and Aaron went in and they told Pharaoh they said thus saith the Lord God of he identified himself as the god of Jacob at The Burning Bush Moses knew him as the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob yet when he went before Pharaoh he made no mention of that because he was calling the elect out of Egypt praise the Lord he said let my people go that they may hold a feast on unto me in the wilderness praise God amen amen and Pharaoh said who is the Lord who is this God that I should obey his voice to let Israel go I know not the Lord neither will I let Israel go Pharaoh didn't know anything about and you know Pharaoh is the type of the devil just thought i' let you know couple of nice real good types here so when God started to call you out of Egypt he had to go to Pharaoh he had to go to the devil and say hey that's my son time to give him up that's my daughter time to give him up and he said you know you know when God calls a Believer Out Of The World God is obligated to start doing Supernatural in his life life and he does Supernatural in his life so that you know it's God it's not some man's made idea it's God you'll see things other people go that ain't God don't talk to me about it because I see it's God and everything that happened Israel got well Jacob got excited but he didn't know Israel was in there Moses did 10 miracles and and Pharaoh every time Moses you know cuz when when God went to the devil to to fight over your soul the devil didn't believe him said well let me tell you about all the bad things that person did let me tell you about what a mess they are that's not your son said okay and he started little things started to crack little things that all of a sudden you wondered about you're just going to wait a minute I never seen God before but now weird things are happening things are starting to happen that's because you're Israel You're not Pharaoh pharoh's the devil God didn't raise you up to destroy you amen Jacob I created Israel I formed the scriptures are perfect amen praise the Lord so Pharaoh he he had a problem with it he he said well he didn't know the Lord and then so God started to show you who God was amen because all of us were born in sin shap and in iniquity come to the world speaking lies lies was our second language probably our [Laughter] first and we were a bunch of Rascals to be begin with we were no good not I mean brother brandom he gave all kinds of examples about ratten people and we're all rten everyone us to stand up and say I was the chief of Sinners wouldn't you say that and and if you don't believe you were the chief of the sinner what church you in right God is trying to do something for you tonight amen praise the Lord amen so he goes through here and he starts to reveal to Israel that there's Deliverance the time of our deliverance is at hand amen he's not looking at Jacob he's looking at Israel and Pharaoh he's just bringing judgment on pharaoh and Pharaoh is a tough guy because he will not let you go easy he won't let you go easy he'll come up with all kinds of ideas look at this I'm I'm going to take you to Exodus 8 verse 25 praise the Lord amen am amen and Pharaoh called to Moses and for Aaron and he said okay I've had I okay I yeah okay Dennis yeah I might let him go C but Dennis you can go but look I know you're already going to church so just worship God in the church after the dictates of your heart you don't you don't really have to go to a Promised Land you don't really have to have a holy ghost you don't you don't really have to get baptized right you don't you don't really have just just stay right here you can that look at what he says that's what he told him he goes sacrifice to your God in this land right here you don't have to leave Egypt serve him here but you know Moses and God they don't make no deals with the devil praise God he doesn't make no deals with it so then he goes he goes down here to verse 28 because look at well let's read some of this verse 26 so Moses said uh no we're not doing that it is not meat to do so for we shall sacrifice an abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord Our God first of all we might speak in tongues and you call that of the devil so the things that we're about to do we're going to change our lives we're going to do a lot of things that you aren't going to like amen Lo shall we sacrifice an abomination of the Egyptians before they're even their own eyes and then won't you kill us we will go three days journey into the Wilderness and sacrifice to the Lord Our God as he shall command us and pharah says Pharaoh goes okay that's a good argument I I'll admit he says well look I'll let you go and you can sacrifice to the Lord your God in the wilderness so you know we use brother Dennis because we're using brother Dennis and so you can you can leave the church I know you're going to go down to some crazy bunch of people they don't even have 200 people in their Church no pip organ you know how much you like the pipe organ and if you if you want to go down there in the wilderness go right ahead be my guest amen you may sacrifice in the wilderness Only You shall not go do don't like don't get you know if you're thinking about giving up smoking and drinking don't don't don't get that fanatical because God don't care God doesn't care about any of that he he's that's a little bit too fanatical for you so yeah well look at what look at what Moses said behold I'm leaving and I'm taking brother Dennis with me and I will entreat the Lord that the Swarms of flies May depart from Pharaoh from his servants and from his people so he he he gives a blessing you know the devil God even blesses the devil because because you know the rain falls on the just and the unjust and and God will do that he even he he entreated Pharaoh but Pharaoh dealt deceitfully because Pharaoh is not willing to let you go amen he's not willing praise God so first he said you could just stay here then he says well you can go but don't go very far let's go over here to Exodus 10 because I'm on I'm on a mission and and verse eight it says and Moses and Aaron were brought again unto pharaoh and he said unto them uh okay go and serve the Lord your God but who's going I mean I'll let you know I'll make a deal with you I'll give your brother Dennis not your wife not your kids but I'll give your brother Dennis I'll make a deal with you I'll let you go but not your husband not your kids I just take you you yeah just go ahead go ahead but God don't play that game God doesn't work that way because I like what he says in verse n Moses said we will go with our young with our old with our sons with our daughters with our flocks with our herds we will go we're taking everything with us now here's a mistake that people make they think they can't go and follow God until they unpack everything that they have but that isn't what the scripture said the scripture said Come As You Are come buy of me amen by isav I know you're blun I know you're naked but that's okay come naked because I've got clothes I can clothe you come come all the come everybody come amen but not everybody that's in the church is Israel this is Jacob too because Jacob's counter to the promise amen amen so let's go down here to verse 24 it says and then Pharaoh called unto Moses and he said all right fine go serve the Lord take your wives take your families go ahead but I want you to leave your flocks and I want you to leave your herds I want you to leave all of them here now there's a signific ific there's a reason he wants you to leave them there because he wants you to believe in a trinitarian God he don't want you to go and take the flock he don't want you to take the Lamb of God with you no no no no no no no no no no no no no we don't believe in the blood anymore you leave you leave the sacrifice here don't bring the sacrifice of praise we got a rock band that'll knock you out and we can do rck really good Jesus Loves Me Jesus Loves Me Jesus Loves Me Jesus I'm Bor of blood and look I got crosses to prove it right God says not not where I'm taking my son praise God Amen and Moses said he says you know what devil you must give us also a sacrifice and a burnt offering and there's only one sacrifice and burnt offering that God will accept amen that we may sacrifice unto the Lord Our God our cattle also shall go with us there shall not leave a hoof be left behind and there we will take to serve the Lord Our God and we know not what we must we don't even know because you know all of us you know I I apologize but you know God doesn't tell us everything that's going to happen to us out in the wilderness he don't tell us all that stuff and just don't don't come to me and say well if you had known it was going to be like this would you have come I don't even hear that that argument isn't even in my head because it's not my seed the seed inside of me when I heard his voice I went and where he leads I go when he tells me to stop I stop I know I'm not looking for a way out I'm not looking for an easy way I'm not looking for that I don't want to go back to Egypt it was a rotten place even though I loved it it was not a good it didn't have a good ending everything that happened there just didn't work out amen praise the Lord so when we get there we don't even know look what he tells him he says he says we must take to serve the Lord Our God and we we know not with what we must serve the Lord until we get there and that's the problem you you you said oh well I'm going to go serve the Lord okay what are you doing I'm getting rid of all this stuff what are you getting rid of all that stuff for who told you to get rid of it well I gotta I got to get rid of that before I can serve God you don't even know how to serve God you don't even have the fantasy idea you can't even wash your hands right think about it this is serious stuff amen so he says and then and and this is before the even you know all of this conversation and all the examples and everything that I've showed you is before they were baptized in the water and before they got the Holy Ghost this all happened before people think that somehow you know brother Bruce I'd really like to serve God but you know I love my cigarettes so much that I don't care come on our church anyways that's what brother rham said he says come on this isn't this isn't the place of the Holy this is the place of the Unholy we're coming in here and get them cleaned up we can't clean it up if we leave them all on the outside oh no no you got to clean up everything because you don't know what God's going to require of you till we get there amen amen praise God and then in Exodus 11 I like Exodus 11 and the Lord said unto Moses verse one he says yet will I bring one more plague more upon pharaoh and upon Egypt and afterwards he will let you go from there when he shall let you go and he shall surely thrust you you know you know that's what well that's how the devil works the devil hangs on to you and hangs onto you till he finally sees he's lost and then he turns on you and pushes you out maybe they only do that to me I don't know but I tell you brother Mikey just it's the he will push you out but you know what's good about it before he pushes you out he gives you all his gold and silver and he and he he get they gave everything to him they gave everything you know before and there was a reason why he did that there was a reason that God didn't make you get rid of all your rock and roll and stuff and and he didn't make you give up all these things because God has a plan for you you know because when they got out into the into the desert and after they they crossed the Red Sea and they were all rejoicing and were having a great time now remember who was rejoicing on the seashore was it Jacob or was it Israel who was dancing who was beating the tambourine who was singing who was shouting because they went three days into the desert and God said now now you know God always has a plan God has a plan for all of us brother Marty he thinks you know God is horrible because he took his wife that's horrible kind of a God would do that what kind of a God would not answer your guys' prayers what kind of a God would have you go on and fast and then still not answer your prayers that's what the devil would tell you but you know you see when they got out there and the water was remember brother darl talking about the water being you couldn't drink it because it was better and Jacob jumped up and said you brought us out here to die and Israel said mm God's bigger than that let's go see what God's got let's go to the mouthpiece and see what God's got let's see what God's got hid here in This Bitter rotten place I mean the water is no good but let's go see what God says you see all of us we we fail on arm of Flesh we fall down we we things start to go bad and we go well what should we do I don't know I guess I better get my resume all get my resume all put up get it put on LinkedIn get it all updated and and just hope somebody calls me well wait a minute who you serving LinkedIn or you serving your God in heaven huh well I got kicked out of this house I don't know where I'm going to go live but I'm going to get on Zillow and see what I can afford did you did you ask your heavenly father first did you call the did you did you call the chief realator the guy that can make a way where there seeming to be no way and then when the water's coming up and everything's going the pipes are bursting in the house and the electrical is no good you see the problem is I'm sorry but I'm telling you see you see people some people jump up sometime they say oh praise the Lord the Lord did this for me the Lord did that for me and the next thing you know the Trials come and then they're jumping from Pillar To Post because the Lord never did did that for them in the first place but because God does all things well my God does oh I got testimonies I got testimonies but this ain't about me it's about the word of God it's about seeing that God took care I we need brother brandham in God in his word he says this is way back in 195 57 he says God doesn't tempt man God tries Men He tests them God cannot tempt you but God can test you and every son that cometh to God must be tested or child trained before he can be a son and if we can't stand chastisement the Bible said then we're going to become illegitimate children and not the children of God Amen cuz a child of God is born of God and he will stand the test anywhere anytime in any condition that's right a child that's born of God Amen praise the Lord he does not commit sin does not commit sin that's what the Bible says amen praise the Lord amen we got to read this then I can read the rest of the quotes here go to Deuteronomy 8 people sometimes they don't understand oh wait a minute you forgot what's the subject tonight a successful walk how will you have a successful walk if you're always looking to Jacob and not Israel amen amen this is this is I got this highlighted and I got all kinds of notes written in the flag Lea and everything else says 8 verse1 he says all the Commandments which I command thee this day shall You observe to do that you may live brother that is way too much for this frail Jacob flesh to handle because Jacob is gonna fail but Israel isn't you see Jacob and Israel was one guy that's what I like about this when I saw I said wait a minute Jacob and Israel's one guy and so are you this flesh out here God isn't even looking at it he's looking at the seed on the inside amen and the word on the inside he can do all the Commandments of God and he will live and multiply and go in and possess the land which the Lord swear unto your fathers and thou shalt remember all the way which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness first first you're way too proud Jacob Had a Brain Jacob was pretty smart he stole all the Laban sheep he he got all the cattle he he yeah but God didn't want him that like that when he wrestled with the Lord when he wrestled with the Lord he was a pretty strong guy because he had he had God and God said you know what if I'm going to Prevail I'm going to have to do something very serious and he popped his his hip out amen you see it amen and God did that he said he said I took you out look at what he did he took them to the bitter water you know I remember as a young believer as a young Christian I didn't know God I'd never been that way before I was raised as a presbyterian what they don't we you know we read the Bible but nobody believed it they read it I remember the first time I met God I told the Presbyterian preacher he came to see me and I said you know what Reverend Cole I said I got to tell you I says I learned one thing in underneath that car because I had a car fall on me I said I learned one thing when I when that car fell on me I said the Bible says I didn't even know the Bible said this the Bible says behold I stand at the door and knock If any man open the door I'll come in and sit down and Su with him and he will Su with me and I said now we can admit there's a God in this universe or we can keep the door shut and say there is no God but I'll tell you for sure God is not in the Presbyterian Church that's a direct quote from a sinner who was in Egypt you see Israel was on the inside already that elected seed you know brother brandom said he said you didn't get eternal life the night you got born he said if you ever had eternal life you had it from the beginning you had it at the end there is no end there's only an end for the devil and those that are going in the Lake of Fire but but Israel is my son and has eternal life praise the Lord amen he took him down there you know he he took them through the bitter water and then you know the CH children of Jacob while they were in Egypt they had 7-Eleven and Walmarts and Kroger and family fair and they they could go anytime they wanted but when they got out in the desert they had to learn they had to learn to trust the heavenly father they had to learn that all these blessings that you have God gave you they had learn that and what God was doing when he gave him the Mana and that he was separating Jacob from Israel amen they had to remember the Sabbath they had to remember to keep it holy you know God gave them all that gold and silver and everything else the Egyptians if they had not got the gold and the silver from the Egyptians they would have not have made the golden calf what would they have made it out of sand you see God let them leave with all of that to prove what was in their hearts we don't have to have somebody come and tell you what you know you got to do this gota do that everything else God will prove to you God will show you what you're look at what he says here in Deuteronomy he says I led thee these 40 years ears in the wilderness to Humble thee to prove thee to know what was in thine heart whether thou would keep his Commandments or not God is omniscient omnipresent all knowing all powerful he knows what's in your heart do you know what's in your heart today you're serving the lord but next week you may not God will put put the pressure on you to find out what's in your heart and then you'll know what's in your heart and then you'll know and then you'll say I'm undone and you'll mean it you'll really mean it when you see that you can't even walk without God you can't breathe without God you can't you can't everything that I have God gave amen and that only comes from God proving that to Israel Jacob he don't well Jacob's happy brother brandham said Jacob has always got his hand on the money bag right the water from the rock they they made they made you see everywhere you go and if you read the whole book of Exodus and you read everything that I'm talking to you about and we had to make it short but you can see every time something went wrong Jacob raised up his head and said hey that ain't right hey but Israel said wonder what he's going to do now wonder how he's going to get us out of this wonder what he's got wonder what he's got next he's got such a big bag of tricks God's got all kinds of stuff in his bag he's got all kinds of Deliverance he's got all kinds of Miracles he's got all his his Bounty is wow Hallelujah God is God has got everything if we can just yield to him if we can just recognize what God is trying to do with us amen amen amen amen you think about it I was when I was telling Don about this earlier this week I said Don I said oh my I said look about it I said you know children of well not the children of Israel Jacob they all got to complaining about Moses then they got the back biting you know like we do right sometimes we don't like each other but you know oh that brother didn't shake my hand took my parking spot I told that not to do that guy was in the bathroom too long this was other things so you know what God did he sent fiery serpents in caused more division in the church well that seems awfully extreme but you know God did that and then Jacob got mad because now he's getting bit Israel said hey I got bit what do I do and he went to Moses and Moses said God Moses went to God said what do we do God says you know what let him alone let him let him back bite some more it's it'd be fine really that's what he told him John he said let him back bite some more he says but this is what I want you to do I want you to take a Brazen serpent I want you to put it on a pole and everyone that believes the word of God that is coming out of a Vindicated prophet's mouth will look and live he didn't take the snakes away he didn't there was Israel people there were the elect that got bit and you sometimes say oh how's this is this bad thing coming why why is this happen why is that happen because God's trying to form you into the image that's he's trying to form you into the image that's right let God form you amen amen if for everything in everything in the 40 years I asked Donna I said Donna you know I said I've been thinking about this I said I don't know where I got three million people come up out of Egypt right okay so they said the Bible says that e that Caleb and Joshua had a different Spirit right they were the only two that were going to go into the promised land right but they weren't the only two that went in the promised Lane there wasn't there was Joshua and Caleb and 12 tribes of Israel there was many all of those that generation that disbelieved God died off and believe it or not their offspring you mean Jacob's Offspring went into the promised land uh-huh uh-huh so Joshua and Caleb went into the promised land and God still had elect inside of Jacob that went into the promised land but there were people that went into the promised land that were unbelievers they just happened to grow up in the message they just happened to they could quote it they listen to the tapes just like everybody else but they weren't elect but how can you tell how can you tell who's elect and who's not well let's give a us let God put the thumb screws on them we'll find out whether they're Believers or not brother I'm telling you there ain't no I'm I ain't going nowhere this is where I'm at oh I wish I had the ability to grind that into the people's hearts God is looking for Tim tested Christians every son that cometh to God must be tried child train tested and you who jump from Pillar To Post and this to that and in and out how can God ever adopt you into his family or positionally place you so now think of that for a moment how can you be positionally placed when you will not stand still long enough for God to do it amen amen praise the Lord so he says when a son is Born Into the family he's a son at Birth is that right and brother said you see that's where the Pentecostal people jump the fence so I'm going to take that and we're going to apply it to what we heard tonight so Jacob God created him he was a son at Birth and you thought that when you were born again that settled it that was only the beginning that's right you are a son surely when you're born but when the son is born he is not an heir of all things yet because he has to go through testing trials to find out what's in his heart really to find out whether he'll stay with God come thick or thin high water low it's it's wonderful because God's already told us in the word that the flood comes I will walk with you when the fire comes it won't burn you I'll take care of you I'll take care of you amen praise the Lord when this son was born he wasn't heir of all things he had to go through testing trials to find out if he has the right type of son to fall air of all things and listen God's word said that every son that cometh to God must be first tried chastened child trained before it can be adopted into the family amen sometimes Believers are getting put to the test not sometimes every time for every son that cometh to God must be chasen tried child trained remember the trials the dusty roads the hot sun of persecution but the Loyalty of your heart beats that material till she is ready to go into the mold God's children is made up of they are made up correctly on his word for they are living examples and the word of God is living through them see the trial comes to shake you to put you to the very bottom to see whether you'll stand amen you want a successful life recognize who you are amen amen amen are you Jacob or are you Israel amen amen let's bow our heads for word of Prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord we see in the scriptures that even today there are still nuggets there's still things Lord that you want to get to us Lord that through the revelation of these things not just teaching but when it becomes part of us then Lord we'll stand strong and we'll stay with your word and I pray Lord that You' take the simple message father Lord even though when we look at the scriptures there in Roman we realize that we're not pharaoh and you didn't raise us up to destroy us you didn't bring us out of the world to kill us here you didn't do that you brought us here to be a reflection of the invisible God Moses had never seen God till he saw the burning Bush and then you stepped right into Moses because there's no way Moses could turn the water into blood no way he could pick up sand and turn it into flies no way he could call for frogs could not do it but God can God can do all those things and I can do all things in Christ amen who strengtheneth Lord when I'm weak then I'm going to say I'm strong Lord Jesus I just pray Lord that you will speak plainly to all of us forgive us of our sins and our slothful ways sometimes we're just weak we just we fall down we we don't know how to walk we we don't know how to live but Lord you know how to live you know how to walk you know how to you can teach us how to speak you can teach us when to keep our mouth shut you can you can show us how to love our neighbors you can show us how to love our enemies because we don't have the ability to do that Lord I just pray I just pray father you just take the simple message Father you'll make it one with us Lord let us meditate on these things we love
