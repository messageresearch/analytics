[35:03] every heart in Jesus Christ's name we
[35:06] ask it amen amen you may be
[35:11] seated so I like to speak to you for a
[35:14] while on except you abide in the
[35:20] ship so we find out that our scene opens
[35:24] here that they had just started on a
[35:27] little journey and it got very
[35:31] dangerous the wind was blowing and the
[35:33] sea was contrary and and what's this uh
[35:37] Ura uren means it's a strong easterly
[35:41] Mediterranean wind it it came in
[35:43] unexpected of them and the ship was
[35:46] tossed and and the Bible says there in
[35:49] verse 15 it says so when the ship was
[35:52] caught and could not bear into the wind
[35:54] we gave up we just let her drive because
[35:58] the wind was contrary we couldn't we
[36:00] couldn't control we couldn't say well we
[36:02] were going to go here today or we're
[36:03] going to go there tomorrow or we we just
[36:05] let it go with the wind because we
[36:07] didn't have any choice it was so it was
[36:10] a temptu wind and if you've ever seen in
[36:14] I mean those movies when the storm comes
[36:18] up and the waves I mean 70 foot waves
[36:21] and the wind you in the Mediterranean
[36:24] had some really horrible storms a year
[36:27] ago there was a a they called it a
[36:30] Mediterranean hurricane and we're not
[36:32] used to a Mediterranean hurricane but it
[36:34] it hit Libya and it blew out a dam and a
[36:38] whole city washed into the sea it just
[36:41] washed into the sea and here's Paul and
[36:44] and these people on this boat and and
[36:46] the wind was so contrary everything was
[36:48] just it was such a
[36:51] disaster and he says so he said we we we
[36:55] couldn't e we couldn't be we couldn't
[36:57] even drive our ship so we just we just
[37:00] let her go and running under a certain
[37:02] Island which is called Claudia we had
[37:05] much work to come by the boat so they
[37:07] were struggling there was it was a
[37:09] temptu time there was there was the
[37:12] water was coming it was blowing on them
[37:16] there lightning was flashing rain it was
[37:20] horrible and which they had taken up
[37:22] they used helps under ging the ship and
[37:25] and Don and I have seen some of these
[37:27] these old movies you know from the 1800s
[37:30] and the 1700s when the ship and the
[37:32] water starts to come in the bottom of it
[37:34] in fact we were up uh in Lake Erie we're
[37:37] up coming up on Buffalo and we went on
[37:39] and we stopped and we saw where they had
[37:40] built a fort and and the ship the ship
[37:44] it start when the water gets you know
[37:46] they build the ship with dry wood but
[37:49] then when it gets wet it swells shut but
[37:51] when the storm gets too strong the water
[37:54] can come in through there and then they
[37:56] have jacks
[37:57] they have Jacks and things and and they
[38:00] they stretch it across the the bow of
[38:02] the ship inside where the ribbing is and
[38:04] everything and they try to make sure
[38:06] that it will hold fast and that's what
[38:08] he's talking about here you got to get
[38:10] the picture that this was a rough rough
[38:13] rough
[38:15] time it was a horrible time so they
[38:19] undergirded the ship fearing lest they
[38:21] should fall into the quicksands they
[38:23] stri the sail which means they lowered
[38:25] all the sails
[38:27] and they still were driven they were
[38:30] afraid for their lives they couldn't
[38:32] figure out what was going to happen they
[38:35] didn't know what was going on they knew
[38:37] where they wanted to go but they
[38:39] couldn't get
[38:40] there
[38:42] amen and we being exceedingly tossed
[38:45] with the Tempest the next day they
[38:47] lightened the ship and the third day we
[38:51] cast out with their own hands the
[38:52] tackling of the ship they started to
[38:55] throw the the seats overboard anything
[38:58] that was not tied down they threw it
[39:00] overboard because they wanted to survive
[39:02] and the waves were still contrary
[39:05] everything was such a disaster for them
[39:09] amen and the third day we cast out with
[39:12] our own hands the tackling of the ship
[39:14] and when neither Sun nor stars in many
[39:17] days
[39:18] appeared and no small Tempest lay on us
[39:22] and hope that we should be saved was
[39:25] taken away
[39:29] Amen brother brandham said when Paul was
[39:31] out on the ocean that night 14 days
[39:35] nights without moon or Stars why all
[39:38] hopes was gone is that right no hope at
[39:40] all on those seamen oh though men with
[39:42] Barnacles on them almost they'd been in
[39:45] the sea so long and they said all hopes
[39:47] is gone if they should ever live and
[39:50] even he said' look at Paul when he was
[39:52] Shipwrecked out there why he had lost
[39:55] his hopes too
[39:59] Paul lost all hope the waves everything
[40:02] it looked terrible it was horrible
[40:05] time and they had gotten very
[40:09] discouraged but verse 21 Paul says but
[40:14] after long absence Paul stood forth in
[40:17] the midst of
[40:19] them I'm so glad that Paul didn't give
[40:23] up on
[40:24] prayer everything his hope everything
[40:27] everything was gone and he went down and
[40:30] he got down and he prayed he got down
[40:33] and asked the Lord what is it you'd have
[40:35] me to
[40:37] do we spend so much time looking at all
[40:40] the things going around in the Tempest
[40:42] and the wind and the rain and everything
[40:44] else when God says get down on your
[40:46] knees and pray and I will hear from
[40:49] heaven and Paul had lost all his hope
[40:52] but he had his rest in a God that had
[40:55] saved him somebody he had met on the
[40:58] Damascus Road he had that that Assurance
[41:01] in his heart if I get down and I pray he
[41:04] will hear from Heaven he will answer
[41:07] me
[41:09] amen amen after long
[41:14] abstinence Paul stood forth in the midst
[41:17] of them and he said
[41:18] s you should have hearkened unto me and
[41:22] not have Lo loose from CRE and to have
[41:25] gained this harm and loss
[41:27] you should have
[41:28] [Music]
[41:29] listened and now I exhort you to be of
[41:32] good
[41:34] share for there shall be no loss of any
[41:38] man's life among you but of the ship for
[41:42] there stood by me this night the angel
[41:44] of God whose I am and whom I serve and
[41:47] the angel said fear not Paul thou must
[41:50] be brought before Caesar and lo God hath
[41:53] given thee all them that sail with thee
[41:56] wherefore s be of good cheer for I
[42:00] believe God that it shall be even as he
[42:03] has told me praise the Lord
[42:07] amen but standing down in the
[42:11] galley well wait a minute say so all
[42:13] hopes Paul his hopes was gone the little
[42:17] old ship was water logged 14 days and
[42:19] nights no moon stars or nothing you look
[42:22] at that from verse 19 up there it says
[42:24] in the third day we cast out everything
[42:27] and it was 14
[42:31] days storm water nothing to eat they had
[42:37] things to eat but was afraid to eat
[42:39] because you know when you eat on a boat
[42:40] that's doing like this and going like
[42:41] this you're going to throw it right back
[42:44] up and then nothing to drink 14 days but
[42:50] Paul he went down and he cried out to
[42:53] God
[42:54] Amen that little old ship was water
[42:57] and they couldn't see no Knights there
[43:00] was no moon no stars or nothing the
[43:02] little boat tossed about in the waters
[43:04] and everything and Paul said well I
[43:06] guess all hopes is
[43:08] gone so he didn't
[43:11] know Paul gave
[43:13] up and he and he went down into the into
[43:17] the belly of the ship and he prayed till
[43:20] he got a hold of
[43:22] God brother Brenham said but standing
[43:24] down in the gallery that night praying
[43:27] pring a vision come before him and he
[43:30] saw the angel of the Lord come and said
[43:32] Don't Fear Paul don't
[43:35] fear there's something I've got to you
[43:38] to do you're going before Caesar there's
[43:41] something God has for us to do don't
[43:44] fear don't get all caught up in the
[43:46] Tempest and the storm and the wind and
[43:48] everything blowing Every Which Way oh it
[43:50] looks horrible but pray to God amen amen
[43:58] that's right and lo God give all these

[44:04] therefore you be of good courage and you
[44:07] go on out and have good courage and

[44:18] hose just throw it on you and have the
[44:20] water everywhere salt
[44:23] water and lightning and wind and it's

[44:29] and says be of good cheer brother
[44:32] John be of good cheer sister Linda be in
[44:35] good
[44:37] cheer everything's blowing
[44:40] up when God gets a hold of a man he acts
[44:44] contrary to all the circumstances around
[44:47] him
[44:49] amen little old Paul right in the middle
[44:52] of the storm he run on the outside
[44:53] shaking his hands and screaming at the
[44:55] top of his voice saying be of good
[44:57] courage
[44:58] brethren for there stood the angel of
[45:00] God before me last night saying don't be
[45:04] scared oh yeah my brother you know this
[45:07] is oh this oh oh

[45:23] amen don't be scared we are going going
[45:27] to come right before Caesar and I tell
[45:29] you there's not one of you is going to
[45:32] die not one hair of the head is going to
[45:35] perish but we're going the ship's going
[45:37] to be wrecked somewhere and in the
[45:39] vision I seen it sitting on the shore
[45:41] wrecked somewhere but there's nothing
[45:43] going to harm us let's take something
[45:45] and
[45:46] eat
[45:49] amen I believe God verse
[45:53] 25 that it shall be even as he has told
[45:56] me
[45:58] and how be it we must be cast Upon A
[46:00] Certain Island but when the 14th day was
[46:04] come as we were driven up and down in
[46:07] adaa and adri that's a adrionic sea and
[46:11] that's a if you don't know where the
[46:12] adrionic sea is it's that it's that body
[46:15] of water between the heel of Italy and
[46:19] the Balkans it it goes up in there where
[46:22] Italy becomes like a peninsula and
[46:24] that's where they were at and he says so
[46:26] we were up up and down in the adrionic
[46:28] sea and about midnight the shipmen
[46:30] deemed that they drew near to some
[46:33] country oh the wind was still blowing
[46:35] the storm was still going on but they
[46:38] they they said we we believe we're
[46:40] getting close to some land and they
[46:43] sounded and found it 20 fathoms and when
[46:45] they had gone a little farther they
[46:47] sounded again and they found it 15
[46:49] fathoms and then
[46:53] fearing lest they should have fallen
[46:55] upon the rocks they cast four anchors
[46:58] out of the stern and wished for the
[47:00] day
[47:02] amen and as the shipmen were about to
[47:05] flee out of the ship they still didn't
[47:07] believe
[47:09] Paul they didn't believe
[47:11] him they were still looking at all the
[47:14] circumstances they were still trusting
[47:16] in the arm of Flesh oh if I can just put
[47:19] the anchor out here we can survive and
[47:21] then it got to the point where they
[47:22] thought for sure they couldn't survive
[47:24] and they were getting off every man for
[47:26] himself you know that's how it is today
[47:28] every man for himself get do whatever
[47:31] you got to do brother I don't care just
[47:32] do what you got to
[47:37] do they cast four anchors out of the
[47:40] stern and they wish for the day
[47:42] amen and as the shipmen were about to
[47:45] flee out of the ship when they had let
[47:47] down the Lifeboat they let it down into
[47:49] the Sea Under color as though they would
[47:51] have cast anchors out of the force ship
[47:55] Paul said he turned to the C tan and to
[47:57] the soldiers and he said except you
[48:00] abide in this ship you cannot be
[48:08] saved you've got a decision to
[48:12] make
[48:14] amen
[48:17] amen and while the day was coming on
[48:21] Paul besought them all to take meat
[48:24] saying this day is the 14th day that we
[48:27] have carried and continued fasting so
[48:29] they hadn't eaten in 14 days having
[48:31] taken nothing and wherefore I pray you
[48:35] to take some meat for this is for your
[48:37] health for there shall not a hair fall
[48:40] from the head of any of you and it's
[48:42] like he's preaching to deaf
[48:46] ears
[48:48] amen amen he's preaching to DEA
[48:51] ears brother said oh they they was
[48:54] afraid to do it
[48:56] and Paul went and he got a sandwich and
[48:58] he made it and he started eating why he
[49:01] wasn't
[49:02] scared because God had said so and that
[49:05] anchored in Paul's heart
[49:09] amen
[49:11] amen he says for there shall not a air a
[49:14] hair fall from the head of any of you
[49:17] and when he had thus spoken he took
[49:20] bread and he gave thanks to God in the
[49:23] presence of them all he didn't hide it
[49:27] he didn't just stand off in the corner
[49:29] but in the presence of them all he said
[49:32] Thank You Lord and the wave hit him
[49:34] thank you Lord and the rain and the
[49:36] Thunder was still clattering thank you
[49:39] Lord for this bread I'll eat it and all
[49:43] of them standing there looking at him
[49:45] this man is out of his mind
[49:50] amen
[49:52] amen and he had and gave thanks to God
[49:56] in the presence of them all and when he
[49:58] had broken it he began to
[50:00] eat and then were they all of good
[50:05] cheer because of his attitude in the
[50:09] midst of the
[50:10] storm because of his faith all these
[50:14] discouraged
[50:16] men felt
[50:19] encouraged you think you can't do
[50:21] anything but your attitude in the life
[50:24] that you live and how you present
[50:25] yourself God will reward you for that
[50:31] amen they was afraid to do it Paul went
[50:34] and got the sandwich he made it he
[50:36] started eating why he wasn't scared God
[50:39] done said so and it anchored in Paul's
[50:41] sh heart and I don't care the ship was
[50:45] pitching just as hard as it could there
[50:47] was no stars no moon days passed on by
[50:50] that didn't work Paul didn't worry Paul
[50:52] a bit I imagine one sandwich after
[50:55] another walking up and down the deck
[50:56] saying glory to God we're not far from
[50:58] Land
[50:59] Brothers another wave another thing you
[51:03] know another and the wind is contrary
[51:05] everything's going wrong but Paul had
[51:08] his eyes focused on the
[51:10] Unseen
[51:12] amen
[51:14] amen there you are no matter how dark it
[51:17] got the whale might have come up to turn
[51:19] the ship over the Sharks following them
[51:21] by the hundreds and that didn't phase
[51:24] Paul no sir he knew what God had said he
[51:28] believed what God had said he said
[51:30] wherefore Brethren be of good courage
[51:32] for I believe
[51:35] God praise the Lord I don't care what
[51:38] happens I believe God what do you

[52:06] Faith

[52:13] they were all of good cheer and they
[52:16] also took some
[52:17] meat and they takeen and they eat and
[52:21] eating and they got encouraged because
[52:23] they
[52:25] believed what did they believe they
[52:28] believed Paul's
[52:30] testimony cuz I'm going to show you they
[52:32] still was really
[52:34] afraid but they believed T Paul's
[52:37] testimony and he was able to lift them
[52:39] all up out of their fear to get be
[52:45] encouraged it was able to do
[52:48] that because they believed Paul believed
[52:51] that what God told him was the truth and
[52:53] now it was several days before they were
[52:56] ever
[52:58] shipwreck yeah the evidence everything
[53:00] was against what he was
[53:03] saying but yet Paul believed God every
[53:08] everything that you could put your hand
[53:09] on was shaken everything that you could
[53:11] look at all the circumstances everything
[53:14] but Paul said God has told me I must go
[53:16] to
[53:18] Caesar
[53:21] amen it was several days before they
[53:23] were ever Shipwrecked or gone on the
[53:25] island but God God brought it to pass
[53:29] because they believed it don't you

[54:03] Lord the kings of the earth set
[54:05] themselves and the rulers take counsel
[54:08] together against the Lord and against

[55:15] up amongst your brethren God will lift
[55:18] you up in the community where you live
[55:19] God will lift you up above everyone if

[55:25] him oh oh yeah but you know whatever
[55:27] word you want to fulfill that's the part
[55:30] if you're all mad if you're all
[55:33] confused God will stand against

[55:38] amen let's look here at Matthew
[55:42] 24 praise the Lord
[55:48] amen praise
[55:50] God
[55:54] Amen in Matthew
[55:58] 24:33 he says so likewise when you shall
[56:02] see all these
[56:04] things what things all the things that
[56:07] we're seeing right
[56:08] now all these things know that it is
[56:12] near even at the
[56:15] door verily I say unto you this
[56:18] generation shall not pass till all
[56:20] things be fulfilled Heaven and Earth
[56:23] shall pass away but my word shall not
[56:27] pass
[56:28] away
[56:31] amen God sent an angel to Paul because
[56:35] Paul prayed in the midst of the
[56:38] storm and God gave Paul a sure
[56:41] word and when Paul believed that word he
[56:45] went and testified of that word am and
[56:48] he even caused those around him to be
[56:51] encouraged because they could see in
[56:53] Paul that he believed what he said
[56:58] amen
[57:00] Amen brother Bram said so he he said he
[57:03] will keep his promise to Abraham and his
[57:07] seed
[57:09] amen and the promise was given
[57:14] unconditionally I like that we need to
[57:17] start believing that you know that means
[57:19] there's no
[57:21] conditions God said I will I will do it
[57:24] he tried it before brother B said he
[57:26] tried it he tried it with adamy just
[57:28] gave him a little bit of word to keep
[57:30] and it fell he gave it to the next guy
[57:32] and it fell and it fell and it fell but
[57:34] when he came to Abraham he said Abraham
[57:36] come on I'm taking you out of ir ches
[57:39] I'm taking you a place you've never seen
[57:41] before and I will bless you and there's
[57:43] nobody going to stop
[57:45] it because I'm going to do the blessings
[57:48] and it's
[57:49] unconditional it doesn't dependent on
[57:52] how many times you fall it dependent on
[57:54] on how it's I am God and when he could
[57:58] swear by no other he swore by himself
[58:01] right
[58:04] amen and brother random said so what
[58:06] we're trying to do here he was starting
[58:08] a a healing campaign he says is to get
[58:12] fear out of people's hearts and mind
[58:16] that's the greatest curse that's in the
[58:18] church today is the people who are
[58:22] afraid but what are they afraid of to
[58:25] lay hold of God's
[58:29] word not what Instagram says or X or
[58:33] truth social or what the news says or
[58:36] that news channel not what they say but
[58:38] what God's word
[58:42] says we're all tossed about
[58:45] because we've forsaken the word of
[58:51] God the greatest curse that's in the
[58:53] church today is people are afraid afraid
[58:57] to lay hold of God's word the
[59:00] promise how can God ever take back one
[59:03] of his
[59:04] words it would be easier as we said last
[59:07] night for all the stars to just vanish
[59:09] out of the
[59:10] Skies the Sun the moon the Earth to pass
[59:14] away but you see God's word can never
[59:16] pass away it's Eternal and it's forever
[59:20] right and how I love to rest my weary
[59:23] Soul upon every word of it it's just
[59:26] seems like when you could just hang it
[59:28] up there and say there it is it's got to
[59:30] happen because God said so and if God
[59:32] promised it God has to keep his word God
[59:36] has to keep his word
[59:39] amen let's go back to
[59:41] acts let's see what's going on
[59:44] here praise the
[59:53] Lord and they were all of good cheer and
[59:55] they also took meat and we were in all
[59:59] in the ship
[1:00:01] 260 and 16 Souls so that's 276
[1:00:05] people and Paul Paul's influence was so
[1:00:10] strong that he convinced them to be of
[1:00:13] good
[1:00:15] cheer that's influence you have that
[1:00:20] unless you don't believe you're the seed
[1:00:21] of
[1:00:24] God and and when they had eaten enough
[1:00:28] I'm going to show you see they were
[1:00:29] still afraid they lightened the
[1:00:31] ship and they cast out the weed into the
[1:00:34] sea they took the last provisions of
[1:00:37] food that they had they threw that
[1:00:40] overboard because the storm was still
[1:00:43] very
[1:00:46] strong amen and when it was day they
[1:00:50] didn't even recognize where they were at
[1:00:52] but they discovered a certain Creek
[1:00:55] within the shores so they're looking and
[1:00:56] there's there's big rocks where you
[1:01:00] because they were afraid that they were
[1:01:01] going to get thrown into the Rock so
[1:01:02] they put down the four you know they put
[1:01:05] down the um the four anchors then they
[1:01:08] said okay I ain't standing with this
[1:01:10] boat we're dead and they got the
[1:01:12] Lifeboat already and and Paul looked at
[1:01:14] the Centurion and he said you know let
[1:01:17] me tell you he
[1:01:18] says you have to stay in the
[1:01:24] ship and one of the soldiers said you
[1:01:27] know I kind of believe this guy I don't
[1:01:29] there's no evidence as you read all that
[1:01:32] there is no evidence that Paul was
[1:01:33] anything he just just
[1:01:36] words didn't do a miracle before them he
[1:01:39] didn't do anything he's just he's still
[1:01:41] probably still in
[1:01:43] Chains and and there he
[1:01:47] was and when they looked they saw that
[1:01:50] there was a place there was a creek you
[1:01:52] know if you've been along a seashore
[1:01:53] there sometimes there's a tributary that
[1:01:56] goes in and where the water comes down a
[1:01:58] stream comes down and and it empties out
[1:02:01] in the sea and they saw this Safe Haven
[1:02:03] they said you know if we could get
[1:02:06] there we'd be
[1:02:09] okay and then went verse 39 so and when
[1:02:13] it was day they knew not the land but
[1:02:15] they discovered a certain Creek with a
[1:02:16] Shore into which there they were minded
[1:02:20] if it were possible to thrust in the
[1:02:22] ship and when they had taken up the
[1:02:24] anchors look at what they did they
[1:02:26] committed themselves under the sea I
[1:02:29] think I'd have committed myself under
[1:02:31] God but these guys were just they're
[1:02:34] unbelievers I mean you know they
[1:02:37] committed themselves to the
[1:02:40] Sea
[1:02:41] amen and loose the rudder bands and
[1:02:45] hoisted up the main sail in the wind and
[1:02:47] said let's do it
[1:02:52] jonal they just
[1:02:54] blindly were we're going for
[1:02:59] it they Hil hoisted up the main sail in
[1:03:02] the wind and they made toward the shore
[1:03:04] and falling into a place where the two
[1:03:06] Seas met they ran the ship around and
[1:03:10] the four parts struck fast and remained
[1:03:13] unmovable but the hinder part was broken
[1:03:15] with the violence of the Waves you see
[1:03:17] the storm just because Paul got them to
[1:03:19] eat didn't mean the storm went away the
[1:03:20] storm was still there the storm was
[1:03:23] still just as violent as it had been for
[1:03:25] 14 days and the soldiers took counsel to
[1:03:29] kill all the
[1:03:30] prisoners now if they believe that
[1:03:36] Paul they wouldn't have threatened to
[1:03:38] kill
[1:03:40] him so the soldiers took
[1:03:43] counsel to kill all the prisoners unless
[1:03:46] any of them should swim out and Escape
[1:03:48] but the
[1:03:49] Centurion willing to save
[1:03:52] Paul kept them from their purpose and
[1:03:55] commanded that they should all that they
[1:03:57] which could swim should cast themselves
[1:03:59] into the sea and get to land and the
[1:04:02] rest some un boards some that were on
[1:04:06] broken pieces of the ship and so it came
[1:04:09] to pass they escaped all safe to
[1:04:15] land because they
[1:04:18] listened
[1:04:20] amen Matthew
[1:04:23] 10 has a scripture that we've all heard
[1:04:28] before 10 verse 41 it says and he that
[1:04:32] receiveth a prophet in the name of a
[1:04:35] prophet shall receive a prophet's
[1:04:38] reward and he that receiveth a righteous
[1:04:40] man in the name of a righteous man shall
[1:04:43] receive a righteous man's
[1:04:46] reward when they received Paul's
[1:04:51] message they received Paul's reward
[1:04:58] right Amen brother brandham said in
[1:05:02] questions and answers he said so brother
[1:05:04] brandom if you have time please explain
[1:05:06] Matthew 10:41 I'd like to know what a
[1:05:08] prophet's reward is well now Jesus said
[1:05:12] whosoever receiveth a prophet in the
[1:05:14] name of a prophet receiveth a prophet's
[1:05:16] reward and a prophet's reward is to be a
[1:05:19] friend with the prophet whosoever
[1:05:22] receives a righteous man in the name of
[1:05:23] a righteous man receives a righteous
[1:05:25] man's reward is that right and if they
[1:05:27] want to know what a prophet's reward is
[1:05:29] well that's to be the friend of the
[1:05:31] Prophet the Centurion became
[1:05:35] friends and when he accepted the prophet
[1:05:38] you know Paul was a prophet right he was
[1:05:41] the first church age messenger he was a
[1:05:44] Divine interpreter of the word all the
[1:05:46] scriptures that were hidden in the Old
[1:05:47] Testament Paul revealed he wrote them
[1:05:49] all loud he wrote him in on the books
[1:05:51] don't you know who Paul was the angel to
[1:05:54] the first church age when the Centurion
[1:05:57] respected that gift in Paul he received
[1:06:00] the same reward that Paul received and
[1:06:03] that was his
[1:06:05] life and so all the 276 people that were
[1:06:09] in that
[1:06:10] boat when they received Paul's message
[1:06:14] they all got to safety doesn't mean they
[1:06:17] all got
[1:06:19] salvation but they all got to safety
[1:06:22] because they believed the voice of a
[1:06:30] Prophet so brother bandom said a
[1:06:32] prophet's reward is to be a friend of
[1:06:34] the Prophet see there's a reward he's
[1:06:36] your friend like the schite woman it
[1:06:38] might come in handy sometimes see it did
[1:06:42] with her brother M him says you see
[1:06:46] Watch God's
[1:06:49] servants
[1:06:52] amen people so quickly forget
[1:06:56] the place of the seventh angel messenger
[1:06:59] and where God has placed him in the
[1:07:02] economy of
[1:07:03] God you know when brother brandham went
[1:07:05] across the curtain at
[1:07:08] time and brother brandham got there and
[1:07:10] and the angel he said well I'm want to
[1:07:11] see Jesus and he talk about the white
[1:07:13] Throne judgment and everything else and
[1:07:14] he said well
[1:07:16] Paul well all of are these all bandoms
[1:07:19] and he said no that's your
[1:07:21] converts and he said he said well he
[1:07:25] said said will Paul be
[1:07:27] judged and he said yeah Paul will be
[1:07:30] judged and all of
[1:07:32] Paul's when Paul receives his reward all
[1:07:37] of his
[1:07:38] converts get the same
[1:07:43] reward when brother brandham said he
[1:07:45] said to me he said well praise the Lord
[1:07:46] he said I preached just what Paul said
[1:07:49] and all those that can't preach like
[1:07:51] brother brandom said one thing
[1:07:55] we are resting on
[1:08:03] that amen the only way you're getting in
[1:08:07] this thing is if you believe everything
[1:08:10] that that Prophet
[1:08:11] said that's right how do you know you
[1:08:15] were baptized right Prophet said so how
[1:08:17] do you know you got the Holy Ghost
[1:08:18] Prophet told me how to how do you know
[1:08:21] he's got the Holy Ghost he told me how
[1:08:22] what it would act like how do you know
[1:08:25] your right Prophet said so how do you
[1:08:27] know seven angels came and so on Prophet
[1:08:29] said so I believe him and God will bring
[1:08:31] that to
[1:08:33] pass but we're real quick because the
[1:08:36] storm is so strong and the winds are so
[1:08:40] contrary to all of our thinking if we
[1:08:43] will receive a prophet in the name of a
[1:08:46] prophet we will receive a prophet's
[1:08:50] reward amen praise the Lord
[1:09:00] amen what should we do
[1:09:04] now so let's go let's take a little
[1:09:07] let's take a look at the Centurion I
[1:09:09] want I want to show you some
[1:09:11] things so we're going to start at verse
[1:09:14] one of chapter
[1:09:18] 27
[1:09:20] amen and it was determined that we
[1:09:22] should sail into Italy they delivered
[1:09:26] Paul and certain other prisoners under
[1:09:28] one named Julius a centurion of
[1:09:30] augustus's
[1:09:32] band brother brandham said well a
[1:09:34] centurion he said that's a man uh the
[1:09:37] right word would be over a century which
[1:09:39] would be a 100 men so he a he was pretty
[1:09:42] high up and entering into a ship of
[1:09:48] adrum we launched meaning to Sail by the
[1:09:51] coast of Asia one artius and Macedonian
[1:09:56] of thessalonica being with us and the
[1:09:59] next day we touched at sidon and Julius
[1:10:02] courteously entreated Paul he was he was
[1:10:06] kind to him showed him kindness gave him
[1:10:09] Liberty to go unto his friends to
[1:10:11] refresh himself but he was still a
[1:10:15] prisoner the Centurion didn't know who
[1:10:19] Paul
[1:10:22] was praise the Lord
[1:10:25] and when he had launched from then we
[1:10:27] sailed under Cyprus because the winds
[1:10:29] were contrary and when we had sailed
[1:10:32] Over the Sea of sisila and pamilia and
[1:10:36] came to Myra a city of liia and and I
[1:10:39] looked for all those places and they
[1:10:41] just said it's part of the Mediterranean
[1:10:43] Coast in Asia Minor and there the
[1:10:47] Centurion found a ship of Alexandria
[1:10:49] sailing unto Italy and he put us thereon
[1:10:54] and when we had sailed slowly many days
[1:10:56] because the wind was starting to pick up
[1:10:59] you know 10 years ago the wind wasn't so
[1:11:03] bad 15 years ago it wasn't so bad but
[1:11:06] there's some place we got to go and the
[1:11:08] wind is getting contrary now and the
[1:11:11] waves are getting
[1:11:13] bigger and then War it's getting a
[1:11:16] little more
[1:11:21] temptu and when we had sailed slowly
[1:11:23] many days and scarce were some over
[1:11:25] Against cetus the Wind not suffering us
[1:11:29] we sailed under cre and over against um
[1:11:33] salmone and hardly passing it we came
[1:11:35] into a place which is called the fair
[1:11:37] Havens n weing to was the city of lassia
[1:11:41] I like that fair Havens you know that's
[1:11:43] kind of a nice safe place you know
[1:11:46] things look well them that are asleep in
[1:11:48] Zion right they forsake their own you
[1:11:51] know everybody thinks ah this is great
[1:11:53] you know but the Lord is coming the
[1:11:54] Lord's coming and we're wh it's going to
[1:11:57] be great it's going to be
[1:11:59] great and when the time was spent and
[1:12:02] when sailing was now
[1:12:04] dangerous because the fast was now
[1:12:07] already passed
[1:12:10] Paul stood up and preached the message
[1:12:13] to
[1:12:17] them false anointed ones at the end
[1:12:21] time this day the scriptures fulfilled
[1:12:25] yeah he got up and he started preaching
[1:12:28] them marriage and divorce he started
[1:12:30] preaching the Seven Seals who is this
[1:12:34] MDC he admonished
[1:12:38] them and sent to them sir I perceive
[1:12:42] that this Voyage will be with hurt and
[1:12:45] much
[1:12:46] damage you don't have to listen to too
[1:12:48] many tapes before brother brandham
[1:12:50] starts telling you
[1:12:52] that not only of the leading
[1:12:56] and everything that we hold precious and
[1:12:58] the ship but also our
[1:13:04] lives
[1:13:06] nevertheless the
[1:13:08] Centurion believed the master and the
[1:13:13] owner of the
[1:13:14] ship more than those things which were
[1:13:18] spoken by
[1:13:23] Paul the life that you you now
[1:13:26] live is fulfilling that
[1:13:31] scripture who do you
[1:13:40] believe I want to turn to Matthew
[1:13:44] 8
[1:13:52] amen Matthew 8 we find another centu
[1:13:55] another man of authority another man of
[1:13:58] of renown and I want you to notice that
[1:14:01] every
[1:14:02] Centurion every one of them in the New
[1:14:06] Testament is a
[1:14:10] gentile there are no Jewish
[1:14:13] centurions they're all
[1:14:18] Gentiles and this German or this Gentile
[1:14:22] in verse 5 of Matthew 8 it says and when
[1:14:24] Jesus was entered into capernium there
[1:14:26] came unto a centurion beseeching him and
[1:14:29] saying Lord my servant lith at home sick
[1:14:32] of the py grievously tormented and Jesus
[1:14:35] said unto him I will come and heal him
[1:14:38] and the Centurion answered and said Lord
[1:14:41] I am not worthy that thou should comest
[1:14:44] under my
[1:14:46] roof because the Gentile realized the
[1:14:49] Jew looked at him as a
[1:14:52] dog and even though God has no respect
[1:14:55] of me or respect of you to even hear our
[1:14:59] prayers I plead the blood of the Lamb of
[1:15:02] God and he will hear my
[1:15:05] voice that's what the scripture
[1:15:10] says I am not worthy Lord that you'll
[1:15:13] even come into my RO into my roof but
[1:15:15] speak the word only and my servant will
[1:15:18] be healed for I am a man under Authority
[1:15:22] having soldiers under me and I say to
[1:15:25] this man go and he goeth and I say to
[1:15:26] another one come and he cometh and to my
[1:15:28] servant do this and he does it and when
[1:15:31] Jesus heard that he marveled and said
[1:15:35] unto them that followed verily I say
[1:15:37] unto you I have not found so great faith
[1:15:40] not in
[1:15:43] Israel and look at the next verse and I
[1:15:47] say unto you that many shall come from
[1:15:50] the East and West and shall sit down
[1:15:53] with Abraham
[1:15:55] and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of
[1:15:59] heaven and those that are from the East
[1:16:02] and the West are the
[1:16:06] Gentiles we are not of the economy of
[1:16:10] God but if we believe God God will do
[1:16:14] great things for
[1:16:16] us
[1:16:18] Amen brother renam says so now look
[1:16:20] jeras he said come jerius now it's the
[1:16:23] Jew he said come and lay your hands on
[1:16:25] my daughter that was his faith because
[1:16:28] he was a Jew and they were taught laying
[1:16:29] out of hands but the Roman he didn't
[1:16:32] want that he said I'm not worthy you
[1:16:34] come under my roof just speak the word
[1:16:37] I'm a man to under Authority I'm a
[1:16:39] centurion I have a hundred men under me
[1:16:41] they have they have to do everything
[1:16:42] that I tell them if I tell one to go and
[1:16:45] another one to come they just do as I
[1:16:47] tell them I have my power and authority
[1:16:49] over them and he says and what was he
[1:16:52] saying to Jesus he wasn't telling Jesus
[1:16:56] I'm the guy that's got the power he said
[1:16:59] I recognize your power and when the
[1:17:02] church recognizes his power God will do
[1:17:07] for us what we
[1:17:09] ask
[1:17:11] amen praise God
[1:17:15] Amen he was telling Jesus I recognize
[1:17:18] you to be God In the Flesh and that's
[1:17:21] right I recognize that every disease
[1:17:23] every sin is in your power hallelujah
[1:17:26] it's under your jurisdiction you can
[1:17:28] speak it that's all you have to do and
[1:17:30] every devil will mind you amen praise
[1:17:33] God Amen speak the word Lord my servant
[1:17:37] will be healed my servant he'll live
[1:17:41] that Roman Centurion knowed he was a man
[1:17:43] under Authority and he know that
[1:17:45] whatever came underneath him whatever he
[1:17:48] said they had to do it he said I say
[1:17:50] this to this man come he comes say to
[1:17:52] that man go he does it I say to this man
[1:17:55] and he says I'm a man of authority and
[1:17:58] everything under my authority obeys me
[1:18:01] and Lord I'm not worthy that you come in
[1:18:03] my house just speak the
[1:18:05] word so we see there in our story
[1:18:08] tonight in the history we see that that
[1:18:12] Centurion
[1:18:13] disrespected the voice of God for his
[1:18:19] hour because he believed the ship's
[1:18:22] owner over the Vindicated voice voice of
[1:18:25] the
[1:18:25] Prophet what are we
[1:18:30] doing we take our own opinions we take
[1:18:32] brother so and so's opinion with
[1:18:34] everything else when we've got a
[1:18:35] Vindicated
[1:18:37] voice
[1:18:40] amen let's go here to acts 10 let's take
[1:18:44] a look at this one this is another
[1:18:48] Gentile in Acts
[1:18:51] 10 verse one it says and there was a
[1:18:53] certain man in cesaria called Cornelius
[1:18:57] a centurion of the band called The
[1:18:59] Italian
[1:19:05] band and he was
[1:19:07] devout and he feared God with all of his
[1:19:11] house amen
[1:19:13] Gentile he feared God who do you
[1:19:18] fear I hope so he feared
[1:19:23] God and he gave much alms to the people
[1:19:26] and he prayed to God always and he saw a
[1:19:29] vision evidently about the ninth hour of
[1:19:31] the day an angel of God coming into him
[1:19:34] and saying unto him Cornelius
[1:19:37] amen what a

[1:21:46] the room where he's at and he said
[1:21:47] Cornelius raise up and go down to japa
[1:21:49] and ask for one named Peter who dwells
[1:21:52] in the house of one called Simon and
[1:21:54] he'll tell what to do amen that's the
[1:21:56] only kind of voice I want to
[1:21:57] hear I'm just looking for that day when
[1:22:00] God says hey Bruce get up get in your
[1:22:02] car I want you to drive around over here
[1:22:04] and you'll find somebody and then go

[1:23:09] Lord let's go back to acts
[1:23:13] 27 think I got
[1:23:16] a
[1:23:19] yes so verse 11 says
[1:23:23] nevertheless the Centurion believed the
[1:23:25] master and the owner of the ship more
[1:23:28] than those things which were spoken by
[1:23:30] Paul and because the Haven was not
[1:23:33] commodious to Winter in the more part it
[1:23:38] the more part advised to depart then
[1:23:40] also if by any means they might obtain
[1:23:43] to fenus and there to Winter which was
[1:23:46] an Haven in cre and which lith towards
[1:23:49] the southwest and the Northwest they
[1:23:52] were still trusting in their own own
[1:23:57] ability when Paul had already told him
[1:24:00] guys I'm going to tell you right now
[1:24:02] stay here don't leave and they listened
[1:24:05] to their arm of Flesh and they left
[1:24:08] anyways and the Bible says and when the
[1:24:11] south wind blew
