helping us get into the spirit to receive the word amen amen I appreciate that very very much may God bless you brother brucees our sincere prayer amen well it's good to see brother Johnson back amen how many's happy to be in in the house of the Lord am amen amen well we wanted to just share a couple praise reports the first one is from Sister Elizabeth Murphy she got her blood results back and they are in normal range prise the Lord praise the Lord amen the head of the oncology said that this would not happen and Sharon Van white uh both of her tumors have shrunk 170% and one 90% and they and and they said they would just be happy if they wouldn't be growing that's what they were looking for so our God is worthy to be praised amen we appreciate those those reports I mean with uh what's happening in Israel and the negative stuff that's going around it's just it's good to know that our God still Reigns amen turn with me if you would in the book of second Peter for opening scripture and second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 we want to talk you titled of the message precious promises and for a subject uh we want to try to uh look at the promises that the purpose that God has given us many of his promises is for our relationship with him and I I don't know if we really ever dove into looking at God's promises about our relationship with him to make us one with him to make us unified with him we have often looked at God's promises are there to meet our needs to help us and uh I want to just dive in uh to the scriptures take our time it wasn't our original our thought here but um we want to just rightly divide the word of Truth amen right down the the middle of the road let's let's bow our our hearts in in a word of prayer and then we'll read two verses here our heavenly father Lord as we stand before you we know Lord that without you we can do nothing it was your grace that God us had a bed this morning it was your grace uh in our hearts that said I I I want to be in the house of the Lord today it was your grace that gave us the health to get here and the desire to come in here and praise you with our brothers and sisters father it is your grace that has touched our two sisters that we could hear this report father we just thank you for your Amazing Grace this morning and we pray that it would just continue to abound here in our midst and in our hearts and our lives and that Lord we could draw closer to you that's why we've come to draw closer to you Lord you're going to show us how to do that your Prophet said we've come to find out where we stand with you Lord but Lord you don't just leave us where we stand with you you show us how we can draw even closer to you we thank you for this come and bless the reading of the word the scriptures Lord may they just come alive to us only you can do that we just commit it all to you Lord we trust in you for all things now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen second Peter chapter 1 starting with verse number three according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust God bless you may be seated may may God just come and make this more real to us is our prayer some of God's promises are unconditional like God loves you unconditional when Satan came to brother brandham after he lost his wife and his daughter and beating him up and say God you know is upset with you and forsaken you and and and and and when the devil said that God don't love you anymore was at that time that brother Bram could recognize that the it was the devil speaking to him because he knew that God loved him unconditionally so it's an unconditional promise and God paid the price for every human being on the planet at Calvary that's right that's right Calvary paid uh John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave himself just unconditionally he gave himself for the world Amen another unconditional promise is that God cannot lie he cannot fail it's unconditional you you there's nothing that you can do is it's always going to be that way unconditional promises that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever it's just unconditional nothing changes it some of God's promises can bless our lives naturally and some bless us spiritually in either case many Believers miss that a lot of God's promises are conditional promises right and that there's needs that have to be certain terms or conditions that have to be met to believe them uh it is true that alls we have to do is believe all things are possible to him that believeth but the thing is what is going to give you that Faith to believe there's certain terms and conditions and we've heard uh uh we've heard before that it's more important to know why you're sick than to get healed purposes and things maybe God we've heard you know ministers come and they say that sometimes God has allowed sicknesses on people that's true and so there's just more to it than just grab this this promise and and and claim it you know I'm going to be so prosperous I'm going to be a millionaire I'm just going to claim it well there's more to it than that let's let's take a look at some let's look at uh Psalms 122 today I this wasn't in my noes but in the light of what's happened in Israel I want to be reminded uh of this Psalms 122:6 says pray for the Peace of Jerusalem amen they shall prosper that love thee you don't pray you don't love you don't have the promise of prosperity amen is that right now look what it says peace be within thy walls and prosperity within thy palaces for my brethren and my companion sake I will now say peace be within thee there are brothers there they just don't know it yet but see you know we're told to pray but then God says if you pray you get blessed amen right there's like a condition and many of God's promises are like that if we take the promise in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy paths we all know that scripture right now there there's times that we use this scriptural promise is when we're wanting God to show us his will about something is that true and there's like certain thing and and we're reminded of the scripture and we're going to go to the scripture and say God what do you want me to do with this would you direct my path with this the word doesn't say in whatever way you acknowledge Him He Shall direct you that's not what the scripture says but Believers will just take the scripture and they'll use it the way they want to the promise is in all thy ways acknowledge Him in other words get your life involved with God in all your ways let him be the Lord of all that's what's happening don't just come to him when you got this certain need and God I need direction over here about this certain thing and I'm coming to you because you know you're going to direct me it's it's it's like using God the promises that go God uses promises to draw a relationship with his children he's interested in long-term uh uh uh he wants to be with us eternally sometimes we look to God's promise because we got this need we get this need me we just kind of forget remember there were 10 lepers nine of them did not come back to give thanks to give God glory but one did and I just I I just want us to look at God's promises in In a Different Light because the scripture tells us that by these exceeding great and precious promises we might be partakers of the divine nature right divine nature not that are light bill gets paid a a and not that we just get healed although when God heals you is his divine nature that does it but brother bom says you know we're going to get healed we're going to die of something someday but when that soul that soul grows in the character of God that does not die anymore and that's what God is interested in God has always been interested in relationships God loves everybody he he even heals his enemies but ultimately he's interested in a deep relationship with us so we want to pay attention to God's conditions terms you you all of us have have purchased something and we just got our our floor put in the greenhouse and they got these terms and these conditions you know you want to uh have an extended warranty you got certain terms and conditions you got to register your product you got to put the name here's the receipt here's what I bought this is where I bought it from terms and conditions God has terms and conditions he's no different in all thy ways acknowledge Him He Shall direct thy paths and the condition terms here there's some there's some scriptures right before this verse and after that helps us see the terms the conditions the Bible says trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not to thy own understanding similar to the verse right after be not wise in your own eyes fear the lord and depart from your ways because our ways are evil my ways are evil amen if if I'm doing something that is not evil it is not my way it is God's way it's just all there is to it I'm not going to take credit for God I'm not going to take credit for God's goodness I'm going to take credit I'm going to take credit for my bone head nature so we see the conditions you can't just you know lean to your own understanding trust in yourself and then expect God to lead you he just he doesn't want that he doesn't he doesn't want to share his glory with us in that in that carnal nature let's look at the fifth God's fifth commandment it's a natural promise yet there's a condition honor thy father and thy mother that thy days may be long upon the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee long life appeals to all of us we all want to live can you say Amen you want to live a little bit longer than you are living today well God gives us a condition here honor thy father and thy mother that's right he never said honor your father and mother if you agree with them if they were good to you if they gave you what you want now there's other Commandments that don't seem as appealing like remember the Sabbath to keep it holy that's not his feeling Thou shalt not do any work thou nor thy son nor thy daughter thy man servant nor thy maid servant nor the cattle and the stranger that is within thy gates in other words working on the Sabbath is an Unholy thing think about that now God will permit it he certainly will in fact you can operate in God's permissive will just fine sometimes you can function in it you can survive in it you can even prosper in it naturally that's true but you'll never Prosper spiritually you just can't why is God going to bless you for going out of his word are you with me many of God's promises are conditional on Sunday the Bible says bring all your tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now here with sayith the Lord of hosts if I will not open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there shall not even be room enough to receive it not everyone pays ties some do some don't now I believe that God can provide spiritual food for one person and not another out of the same message God is the one that opens the eyes God's the one that blesses people spiritually but not only spiritually this blessing is also natural you can be blessed naturally for this obedience to the Lord so sometimes the conditions are naturally and he pays you He blesses you spiritually with spiritual Revelation spiritual food and due season uh I'll tell you I I don't want to close the doors of Heaven I want those wide open I want to prove the Lord amen because he told me come prove him right it's got to be done personally not collectively because you don't have the same heart condition Vision Revelation that somebody else does so it's up to you but see the condition are you with me Proverbs 3:9 honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruit of all thine increase so shall thy bars be filled with plenty and thy pressence shall burst out with new wine stimulation from the father's Revelation by following the natural you think it doesn't have anything to do your spiritual what doesn't have anything to do with your yes because there's a relationship involved and it's you being obedient to what God wants you to do amen sounds like God has a perfect will and He blesses the man that walks in it now too often we try to prosper on our terms instead of God's we try to serve God on our terms instead of his we'll even try to defeat the devil on our terms instead of gods and we're going to see in the next I don't know how many services here as we go through these but God's terms are the only terms for the believer amen it's a it's a you know I personally I don't even want God to bless me if it is not his will I don't want him to smile upon me I don't want him to give me anything I don't want him to bless me in any fashion form way if he doesn't want to I know that everything that God does is good everything but if there's something I'm not pleasing him with doing something I'm not paying attention I'm ignoring this and he's he's wanting to get my attention he's wanting to give me more character in my life I want that more than I want anything that I want and and and we've got to remember that a lot of times we just struggle why isn't God doing doing this for me and why isn't that and this is what the word says and we should have this and you know maybe we need to pay attention to the terms and conditions maybe there's something more that we're missing because we've always got it figured out let's say we have a need doesn't seem like the needs being met you ever been in that position how about the rest of you you need didn't eat your weedies lift up your hands we've all been there let's say we we have this need that we really want to feel God's presence want to feel his Joy want to feel his love some direction for our life and we want to get God's attention hey Lord look at me I need you right if you don't want anything to get in your way what are his terms number one you must believe that you can have it that's number one if you're going doubting I'm not gonna probably not gonna he's not not GNA find favor with them had didn't happen before it's not going to work you have to have faith without this confidence that you can have it how can you please the one that you're looking to get attention from because without faith you can't please him so you want attention you want God to look down on you favorably but you're not going to believe he's going to do it see that don't work you've got to have confidence that he's going to come through for you got to so we always must remember every promise of God requires Faith do you believe that except the ones that bring judgment are you with me this we're we're we're this is not Evangelistic message we are gonna we're going to learn about the Bible today all right look at Matthew 16:14 Matthew I'm sorry Matthew 6:14 Jesus said for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you see the condition there forgiveness comes with God's terms this is not your terms this is God's terms if you want forgiveness you've got to learn to forgive others amen it's just all there is to it there's no exceptions it's a condition and we need faith in the precious promise of God which is I know that if I forgive then I can have confidence that God will forgive me there's your faith and now let's look at the next verse but if you forgive not men their trespasses neither will your heavenly father forgive your trespasses now here's the promise here you don't need faith for it oh yeah I don't you know God's for you know like I don't really care what that that that says because God knows how much they wronged me and I'm trying to live a good life and God knows I'm better than them whatever you justify and however you justify it you don't have to have faith in that promise but it will come to pass see because that's what judgment is about you don't have to have faith for judgment you just have to have faith for the for the for the blessings and and the the the the the character that that God wants to give you the Oneness with him the the overcoming power you have to have faith for these things I hope you can see what I'm saying now if youve have if you're having a hard time entering in I say get behind me devil because this is this is a good word this is a good word this will help you spiritually amen Jesus said as as I said all things are possible to them that believeth but does this problem mean if I can believe for forgiveness without forgiving others then I'll be forgiven see so all things are not possible because God will never give you the faith for that faith comes from God he's not going to give you Faith to be forgiven if you haven't forgiven somebody you're Crossing his terms his conditions so we don't want to try to muster up Faith for something that just ain't going to happen until we meet the conditions are you with me he's teaching us that God's not going to give us Faith until not going to give us confidence not going to give us Faith until we fulfilled his word all right 1 John chapter 3:20 I want to drive this home so we can understand this and get this 1 John 3:20 says for if our hearts condemn us God is greater than our heart and he knoweth all things did not Jesus say when you come up to the Altar and you pray and there you remember that someone has ought against you leave your gift there go to that person and make things right and then come back to the Altar and offer your gift to me so God is not going to flood you with faith here and confidence here if he wants you to go take care of something first see we have such individual we think we have these personal Walks With God that is just between me and him and it doesn't matter if I cross the word or not that's right the only thing that's personal is are you lining up with the word or you like the others who are not that's that's what's you're either personally being obedient or personally being disobedient are you with me I love this word I'm just gonna say Amen because I love the word if I was sitting there and I was hearing somebody preach the word I would be saying amen and I know you must have had a bad day bad night something must have not went right for you but I'm just telling you get into the word because the word's got life in it life all right verse 21 beloved if our hearts condemn us not then we have confidence towards God that's right did you ever get in a fight with your wife or you wives did you ever get in a fight with your husband and you knew when it was time to pray that you felt uncomfort able about praying you didn't even feel like praying for the meal you were hoping that somehow the prayer would bypass you something just inside said you need to get that thing right but once you say sorry now you can have confidence that's what I love about our God we we serve a God who has the ability to speak to our hearts heart and let us to know where we're standing with him have we met his conditions because if we meet his conditions then we can have faith all things are possible to him that believeth all right verse 22 and whatsoever we ask we receive of him why why why because we keep his Commandments and we do those things that are pleasing in his sight it doesn't say we just don't go murder we don't go rob banks we don't steal from the waitress that's not what it's saying it means we do the things that please them right and and too often we want to make the scriptures sound different so we can just go ahead and live our personal life that's right our life belongs to God we're not our own we need to please God in the decisions we make everything you know a Believer can get so far from God they don't even know they're not walking with God Lord help us we know the rain falls on the just and the unjust we know God is good to his enemies I believe God has healed people he has delivered people he has blessed people and those same people have walked away from God amen look God isn't regretting what he's done because he's just that's his nature amen he gives he's good he knows the majority of the people don't appreciate him come on Paul said I became all things to all men he knew he wasn't going to win them all he used the word some you become Christ to all but you only win some it's okay you still are Christ everybody that's God's nature now God is not looking just to bless somebody temporarily he has something else in mind because those people that turn away he he's not going to spend eternity with them they they've rejected him many will come to me in that day God is looking for our just say it like this God is looking for Eternal relationships Eternal relationships that's it but we don't have to wait to get to heaven to have our Eternal relationship in fact we need to get what we need now character hey look if we don't need character what is you know what do we need to go through trials for why do we need to hear God's trying to build character if we don't need it you know I don't think God just wanted me to have character so I can you know be nicer to my wife i' be nicer to my employees just so I open the door at the church and let somebody go in no God is looking for someone he wants to be with just like him throughout eternity so we we we just have to be serious about the terms and the conditions that God has for us now why are so many God's promises conditional do I have to start calling their names because just simply God wants something out of it why would you make a condition why why would you tell your children yeah you can go play when your bedroom's cleaned when the garbage up when the dishes are done why do you make conditions yes you can use the car but just make sure it's filled with gas when you bring it back conditions why do you want conditions you want something out of the deal God wants something out of me and he deserves more than I'm giving him by the way uh he hasn't come short on the deal I've I'm the one that I'm the one that's coming up short of giving in this relationship too often Believers are after something from God without thinking about the relationship now at at the be at the beginning of all I'll just say it like this we were taught by the prophet that his that God gave him a a gift and he had the gift of of healing and it attracted a lot of people and we were taught by the message that that healing um it it's a bait on the hook it it was to to show people that God is alive he's the same yesterday he's the same yesterday today and forever what he's done for others he could do for you God is alive he's real but that is not all God wanted to get across to us he wants a a relationship which his word can be impregnated in the believer's heart and they can begin to manifest his character amen amen now that is what the his end game is what he's looking for he prayed Jesus prayed when he prayed to the father that make us one make them one as we are one father that same Oneness that same um I am here to do the will of the father not here to do my own will to get my own thing to use God for what I can get out of him it's not about that I believe we could have many more promises manifested in our life in our church if we come to the terms of God's word and and I understand all you got to do believe believe believe get people to believe I believe that I do and I I also know that God at the beginning of anybody's life will make things so simple to see the manifestation he really will but when it comes to building the relationship now there's things that he expects out of us and it's up to us individually to say Lord where do I stand with you what is it that you'd have me to do amen I'm trying to believe I'm coming to church I'm hearing you word I I I believe that you s it's not believing intellectually God sent a prophet just saying I'm in the message intellectually it's not it it's really hearing from God what God wants you to do am I can't give you that know we can sit here in church and we can hear the word being preached but everything that I'm I'm saying is not directly directed towards you it's a general truth but you've got to hear the voice of God personally for you you've got to better leave here with the message that God is has for you and then you leave here and you carry it out you know to come in here and hear the church and say you know that was a good sermon I don't care if it's a good sermon I really don't care if it's a good sermon what I do care about is you heard from God you're going to walk in obedience when you leave here and God's going to bless you for it and if we could just repeat that Wednesday Sunday Wednesday Sunday that's growing in the Lord amen always keep in mind God's wanting to to mold Us in His image to build the character that needs to be seen in us no God is not interested in just handing out power to us without character remember that power without character is satanic he's not interested in just giving power out if there's no character you know we're looking for this power to do this power to do that power power power God is looking for character character character amen at the beginning he sent them out and gave them all power to do everything and after their power they wanted to cast fire down where they shouldn't have been casting fire down they were talking about how who was the greatest among them with this power well this this this is not the character of God it's not the humility of God it's not the love of God so God doesn't want to hand out power where there's no character so we really need to pay attention about the terms terms and conditions this is terms and conditions we know we can go to church and feel God's presence all around us God is good we know we can we can go to another church service and feel so good about the service feel God's presence I ask you a question what happens the day later what happens three days later what happens a week later where is that presence where is that that feeling that you were feeling if you want God's presence more if you really want an audience with God you want him there all the time God may be requiring humility talking about terms and conditions now at the beginning he may you know he said he pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh but now you're wanting it more okay you like what you feel you like that goodness that you're feeling you've tasted that the Lord is good okay now I have some terms and conditions for you it's it's understanding the nature of our heavenly father amen I mean every child if I was to ask brother Gabe Hey Brother Gabe if I was to ask brother Gabe brother Gabe do you really do you recognize that your mom and dad ever asked you to do anything the answer is yes now if you willingly just ignore it what happens to you discipline amen or maybe you don't get a certain benefit but if you do that which your parents ask you to do then you get more and it it never stops eventually you're going to be driving eventually you're G to you're going to get this big job and you're going to bring home the paycheck and you're going to hand it over to them God is not interested in just where we're at he has a long-term goal he an expected end for us right and he's trying to get us there and so understand that he he's the things that we want from God are are good they're all right but let's find out the condition what is it Lord that you want so he might be requiring humility God actually resists any kind of Pride or arrogancy any any hoty Spirit if you got one ounce just 1 ounce I got on the scale this morning and I was 175 if just 1 ounce of that 175 pounds is pride get rid of it am get rid of it don't just say well the majority of me is humble get rid of it bring God the sacrifice of humility and respect amen that's what you come to church with you don't just come any old way and expect God to just bless you God don't owe anything to us we got to meet terms and conditions Psalms 51: 17 says the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and contrite heart oh God thou will not despise amen terms and conditions you like ah don't want to read the fine print I'm just coming to church and you want God to you want an audience with God but you're not worried about the the the the the terms and conditions of of having a right Spirit right being prepared in your heart see I believe we're missing out on the on the blessings of God because we're not paying attention to the fine print we're ignoring the things that are important to God because they have to do with our character they have to do with our long-term relationship I'll be honest with you anybody anybody here if you spend enough time with a hoty arrogant person you want to leave their presence as quick as possible can you say Amen to that like you've had your F I'm done with it see you later adios and you just want to get away from that thing what do you think God just going to put his arm around that and say yeah I love to be with that yeah I'm glad that you're here filling my house with your arrogancy no terms and conditions he'll despise you if you come with that and you that may not be your nature that's not what I'm saying here what I am saying is that Spirit can get on you and so what you got to do if you really want an audience with you really mean business with God you're desperate for God a broken and contrite spirit and keep it on you keep it on you don't don't turn it on and off like a some some some like the Pharisees the Pharisees you know they dressed up a certain way their outside countenance was just you know presenting themselves as something but inside the life wasn't there inside they didn't have that humble and contriteness amen terms and conditions let's say you want the devil off your back you're trying to get the devil off your back how many's ever been in that situation all right all right well in order to get the devil uh under your feet the first thing you got to do is get your will under your feet we never think about that what we think about is that devil get devil get up I'm so get out of here devil and then you still want to do your will that's not what the vine print says we don't defeat the devil on our terms we defeat the devil on God's terms we don't use our name to cast out Devils we don't use our will to cast out Devils we use God's name in my name you shall cast out Devils there is only one Authority that is over the devil and that's God and when you submit to God you're you have authority over the devil but if you don't submit to God don't let somebody try to tell you well you just take the name of Jesus and you get rid of excuse me excuse me Paul I know Jesus I know but who are you you know we're we're trying to make the gospel fit our life we need to get our life to fit the gospel all right I decided I wrestled for like three days am I just going to try to get this done in one service and maybe I'll go an extra 15 minutes and I'll just fit it all in yeah exactly it as much as I I don't know what it's like I just I want to do a complete compl thing you get this thought you want to get it done you want to move on to the but it is too important this subject is too important turn with me if you would to James chapter 4 let's look at this promise here James chapter 4 verse 6 the Bible says in verse six but he we want audience with God we want God's grace he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resists the prop and giveth Grace unto the humble so all of us have desires in our life all of us has needs all of us has prayer requests all of us has things we we want to see happen Okay how do I get that how do I get that to happen in my life how do I get you know Noah found Grace in the sight of the Lord I'm sure he wasn't hoty and arrogant and thinking you know I'm God's Prophet I'm sorry he didn't act like that he would have never found Grace in the sight of God and I am not asking any of you to compare yourself with somebody that's more proud than you are to say you know I'm not so bad that's not what I'm asking you to do I'm asking you to get rid of every ounce every ounce how many times you come in from doing something and you say I just don't have any more energy I don't have one ounce left that's how you want to get with your pride I don't have one ounce left it's all gone well God can now do something God finally got a vessel if he could could just get one man in his hands now I don't know how long it's going to take it took Moses 40 years to get his out come on it took 40 years God wasn't wasting time with him in that desert he wasn't and he had a a hot tempered wife on top of it well God uses things to build character we don't got nothing in those 40 Years of what he went through but I believe with all my heart what he went through was building his character because God had a big job for him a real big job it was a oneman army but it wasn't no longer his strength and his ability and he's going to cut this Soldier and kill him and bury him it was no longer him it was God in him right this is what we're after we're after to get more of God in us and the way to do it is come under terms and conditions with him then the promises are his promises are yay and amen amen but we got to come under underline come in in Duty with this the promise of receiving more grace comes with humility he gives Grace unto the humble all right so verse 7even look at this God's conditional promise submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you the first thing is get your will under your feet forget about what you're trying to accomplish submit to God I'm already submitted to Brother John no you think you're submitted because once you get submitted to God you can resist the devil and he will flee from you because that scripture and I've told you unconditionally God cannot lie amen now that's the word you're having a hard time getting the devil off your back take a look at what's going on Amen maybe there's something in your will that you're trying to push some agenda you're trying to push it may may not be God's will get it under your feet submit to the word maybe there's something that you haven't been doing God wants you to start doing it maybe you've been doing things God don't want you to do it submit well I'm having a problem with this why would God want me to go do that does have nothing to do with it that's just as much God's word as this over here it may not be what we're thinking about but if God wants us to go be faithful over here and do something over here do that you'll see maybe you'll have faith to resist the devil come on this to me brother Mar don't you feel that this is this is a word for all of us it's a word for all of us here we can all apply this to our lives it's it's it's not about uh you know I'm on the top 10% of the Church of a believer of a spiritual believer or you know this this what's being preached is for the lower 10% come on the word is the word and I don't care where I'm at with God I know there's a lot more for me a lot more for me you know Paul he had such he gave up everything he forsook everything that he might win Christ and he did it but 30 years later he's still pressing on after he already forsook all and metrist Christ he still pressed none he really wanted to be like Jesus he wanted to be in the image of God too often we just want to use God to get what we want in life come on he's not an N boy and we got to be honest with it God is interested in things that we don't think about and and this this Services is to help stir up that thought process stir up that God is interested in a relationship here we're interested in getting what we need here's the promise I'm believing for it I'm claiming it that's good but God is interested in something other than that but brother John he cares for me he's touched by the fs of my infirmities and I I know he cares for me yes he does and he will never stop but he's also interested in longterm long term I'm just going to be honest with you is character character in your life that's longterm there's there's short-term blessings from God there's long term job I will not be satisfied till I wake in his likeness long term I want to be in His image I mean the the very goal of God was to make a man in his own image and when he was able to make man in his own image then he could have fellowship with him it was not lonely anymore and I think sometimes God just gets lonely with us he wants to be with us but the only thing we want is we want we want help at this situation or that situation and we really don't care about spending much time with them right why call call thou me Lord Lord not do the things they say maybe God wants us out there speaking to somebody about Jesus amen terms and conditions all right it's 25 after let's Stand Together praise the Lord but you're going to let me come back to verse eight won't you all right we because I what I liked about this verse eight it says draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands you siners purify your your heart you double mind Brother Bruce quoted that before service see there's something that we have to do to draw nigh to God conditions I just want to I want to pay attention to the part that God wants me to do I know God's going to do his part am he is faithful he can't lie amen let's sing um let's sing deeper deeper deeper deeper in the love of Jesus I'm going
