We are going to read from verse 1 to3 and Revelation chapter 10 and we'll be reading verse 8 to 11. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Kings chapter 5 the Bible read us. Now non captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria. He was also a mighty man in valor but he was a leper. And the Syrian had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid. And she waited on Neon's wife. And she said unto her mistress, "Will God my Lord with a prophet that is in Samaria? For he will recover him of his leprosy." Revelation chapter 10 from verse 8. And the voice which I heard from heaven spake unto me again and said, "Go and take the little book which is open in the hand of the angel, which standed upon the sea, and upon the earth." And I went unto the angel and unto and said unto him, "Give me the little book." And he said unto me, "Take, eat it, and hit it up. Take it and hit it up, and it shall make thy belly bitter, but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as onion. And I took the little book out of the end out of the angel's hand and ate it up, and it was in my mouth sweet as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my belly was bitter. And he said unto me, "Thou must prophesy again before many peoples and nations and tongues and kings." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And may the Lord bless the reading of his holy word. God bless you. May be seated. This morning we want to speak on this simple subject you know that I titled the gospel according to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The gospel according to you. The gospel according to me. Amen. &gt;&gt; The gospel according to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we know that the word gospel means good news. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's the meaning of the word gospel. It means good news. &gt;&gt; Good news. And we are living today in a world of bad news everywhere. &gt;&gt; Is bad news everywhere you turn to. You look everywhere on the media, on the radio, on the newspaper. Bad news everywhere. And it's becoming popular and is becoming more and more and more. &gt;&gt; You can hardly hear anything good. All what you are hearing is bad news. Although there are scientific advancements in the world today, but yet we have bad news at the end of it all. For it is the tree of knowledge of good and evil &gt;&gt; and is bringing bad news everywhere on earth. Because this is not God's Eden. This is Satan's Eden. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it has become as it was in the days of Sodom. You know in the days of Sodom, the news were flickering and the news in Sodom were faxing the righteous soul of Lot &gt;&gt; and they had no grace, you know, to speak against it because the prophet said that his wife wouldn't let him speak against it. And we have a lot of people today who are like m Mr. Lords. They are pastors on the pit. There are pastor in the world. There are great men everywhere. But they could not speak against you know the sin of Sodom and it's fixing their righteous soul. They don't have the grace. Their church, their wife, their church wouldn't allow them to speak against it because it's a meat ticket. is a meth ticket and there's a lot of compromise you know everywhere on earth today &gt;&gt; and pollusions and perversions on earth today and is bringing bad news everywhere &gt;&gt; but thanks be to God we are not in Sodom &gt;&gt; we are outside Sodom for we are not sodomite we are not Lite but we are Abramite &gt;&gt; and the Abraham was not in Sodom Abraham was outside Sodom. He was living not in Sodom. Therefore, the sin of Sodom. The news of Sodom don't affect Abraham didn't affect Abraham. They are not fixing Abraham's righteous soul. Hallelujah. Because he was not in Sodom. He was outside Sodom. And I want to tell you this morning, church, we are not in America. &gt;&gt; We are not living in America. We are not living in Canada. We don't live in Europe. And we don't live in Nigeria. The bread of Jesus Christ. We are living in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Heaven on earth. &gt;&gt; That's where we live. We are living in heaven. We are pilgrims and we are strangers here. We do not belong here. Our own land is heaven. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; It is heaven. And I tell you tonight church or this morning, heaven is not a place that you can geographically locate by your compass and GPS. &gt;&gt; The prophet said that heaven is a dimension faster than here. &gt;&gt; And the brother it is a realm and it is really real and we get into heaven and atmosphere. Hallelujah. that was brought down and we are caught up into it. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible said in Hebrews 12 from verse 22, it said, "But ye are come unto Mon Zion and unto the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an innumerable company of angels, to the general, hallelujah, assembly and church of the firstborn, which are written in heaven, and to God the judge of all, and to the spirit of judgment made perfect, and to Jesus Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What a place to live. &gt;&gt; What a place to dwell. &gt;&gt; What a place to abide. Heaven not just a geographical, you know, place. &gt;&gt; It's not a place that you travel and you go to by GPS &gt;&gt; or you go to by your compacts. But brother, a faster dimension that is beyond modern science. Hallelujah. Is an atmosphere is being brought down, you know, unto us. And we are caught up into it. And right now, the Bible said in the book of Ephesians chapter 1 from verse 1 to3 that we are in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't sit here this morning in send the light church &gt;&gt; phantom Michigan. We don't sit here this morning. Are you hearing in church in Michigan in United States? We are sitting here this morning in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And how do we get in there? By one spirit. We are all baptized into one body. By the Holy Ghost, we get into the heavenly places. And that's where we are sitting this morning. And there's nothing that can pull us down &gt;&gt; for is our predestinated place. &gt;&gt; Is our place &gt;&gt; predestinated place. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing can affect you there. Nothing can bother you there. Nothing can bring you down there. &gt;&gt; You are in your places in Christ. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is our place and it belongs to us and we living there. Amen. And we are hearing from whom every day. So how can you live in such a place and be bothered by the news going on around here? &gt;&gt; You don't hear them. &gt;&gt; You are beyond them. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are beyond them. You are in the presence of the angels of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. innerble companies of angels and you are feeling the pull. You are hearing from whom like our precious brother Paul used to sing. You know I feel the pull. Brother Paul a Fontaine. He said I feel the pull. I hear the call. I believe you feel the pull this morning. &gt;&gt; You hear the call this morning. Hallelujah. And then let me tell this brothers and sister. Brother Abraham said there was a boy. A little boy was flying the kite and he could not see the kite. And then you say, "Little boy, what are you doing?" I'm flying the kite. He said, "But where is the kite?" "You couldn't see it." He said, "No, I couldn't see it." He said, "Bet, I can feel it tugging. &gt;&gt; I can feel it pulling." And brother, you may not be able to see heaven with your naked eye. You may not be able to see with your 2020. But brother, down deep within your heart, there is a pull there. You can feel it pulling. You can feel it tugging. Hallelujah. And in as much as you can feel it, brother, that is our name. &gt;&gt; I feel it pulling. &gt;&gt; There's a voice calling in &gt;&gt; from the whole rug tree. Hallelujah. Somebody, &gt;&gt; are you with me this morning? &gt;&gt; There is somebody. There is a voice. There's a pool in my heart. &gt;&gt; There's a pool. Oh, praise God. &gt;&gt; Oh, blessed be the name of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm hearing from home. &gt;&gt; I'm hearing from home. And I want to tell you this morning, how long have you heard from home last? Did you hear from home? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you heard from home? &gt;&gt; Did you read the word of God?

That's where you live, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't live in America. Remember that. &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 12 says you are living in heaven. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; You are living in heaven. Oh, praise the Lord. And that is the way should be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But brothers, bad news started in Genesis. &gt;&gt; That's where bad news started from. It started in Genesis. It was good news all along. It was good news. The songwriter says, songs of praise, I woke the moon. Amen. When God spake and it was done, that was songs of praise. Like Job, when God was speaking to Job, he said, "Where were you?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Where were you when I laid the foundation stone, the cornerstone of this earth and the sons of God and shouting for joy? Hallelujah. He said, "Where were you?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not bad news, &gt;&gt; not sad news, no sorrow, no regret, &gt;&gt; good news, &gt;&gt; all the way from foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm happy tonight, church, or this morning, church, to know that my name is written in the lamb's book of life before the foundation of the world. Therefore, I was there &gt;&gt; shouting for joy. &gt;&gt; We were there in the mind of God. We were there when this earth was made. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we are older than the earth. Because for you to witness it, you have to behold her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why brothers, you know, we are from eternity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we came down into time. &gt;&gt; And the brother, we are going back. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Are you hearing me in church? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So therefore, you know, it was good news. Good news. Then you go to Genesis chapters 1 and two. The Bible made us to understand you know that when God started to create this world remember that the Bible says in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Period. &gt;&gt; Then God now took six days to transform the chaotic word &gt;&gt; the word of deluge onto a respplent one. &gt;&gt; It took six days. The prophet said it doesn't take God six days. He said, "But God took six days." &gt;&gt; God could do it immediately. &gt;&gt; Within a moment, he can do it, but he took six days. Each day a thousand year &gt;&gt; and he took it. And the Bible says the first day was good news. &gt;&gt; On the first day and it was good. Second day and it was good. Third day and it was good. Good news. &gt;&gt; Amen. Good news. Come on somebody. This &gt;&gt; good news. &gt;&gt; Fourth day it was good. Fifth day it was good. On the sixth day the Bible say it was very good. Can I hear you say very good? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Can I hear you say very good? &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Very good. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Why was it very good? Because you know God had something in his mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. And what God had in his mind before the foundation of the world was to bring a man here on earth that we live and exercise authority over this earth. When God will be his father, he will be the son of God, an offspring of God. &gt;&gt; Reflecting God on earth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. An amature God on her. And that was the man Adam. So he was made in the image of God. And when we have that man on earth in the image of God with power and faith to use it, it was the masterpiece of God on earth. And the God was so happy. Hallelujah. Until the report says it was very good, &gt;&gt; good news. &gt;&gt; Unheard. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when that man was here on earth, supernatural manifestation was the order of the day. &gt;&gt; That was his nature. It was supernatural manifestation. A regular routine. &gt;&gt; A regular routine. A way of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was supernatural. It Oh, praise the Lord. Adam, it doesn't need to construct bridge or bridges in order for him to walk over the lake Michigan &gt;&gt; or any other body of water on here. He doesn't need to do that. It doesn't need to go to America embassy or any other embassy to obtain visa and go to the airlines and pay ticket you know and fly plane to come down to United States from Nigeria like brother Gideon &gt;&gt; it doesn't need to do that &gt;&gt; hallelujah he thought it is there &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; it was just traveling like a thought &gt;&gt; amen That was Adam. He can walk on water. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He can travel like a T. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing bothers him. Nothing hurt him. &gt;&gt; He was a bonafide son of God. &gt;&gt; With authority and power. &gt;&gt; He was God's scientist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Are you hearing me now? There was a time that faith was in action. &gt;&gt; Amen. It was first civilization. Nothing to halt, nothing to destroy, nothing to bother. God on the seed in the form of Adam. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He was leading lion and cheetah like a pet. &gt;&gt; Brother Mike told me, bro, don't be afraid. This dog is royer. When I heard the name Rottweiler, oh man, I said, "This dog must be very wild." He scared me and he was telling me not to be afraid. Rottweiler, he said, "Bro, no." He said, "This dog will not haunt you. It won't hurt you." He said, "Because I will I I will bring the dog. It won't hurt you. You the dog will know." And the door came and it was just leaking. Oh my. I was just standing by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Brogide, it won't hurt." Is if I tell this dog to you, it will hurt you. But I I train the dogs. It won't hurt you. Just don't worry, bro. It I said, "Okay." So I I I took it by faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. Adam needs to need not to be scared of anything. &gt;&gt; Not even lion. Not even He doesn't have to be afraid. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He has power over them. He rules over them. He governs them. But one day, one day another scientist came, another scientist came. And this scientist that came came and preached another gospel. &gt;&gt; He came to preach another gospel. the gospel according to another scientist. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the prophet said it was wisdom versus faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was why he preached. He came to preach wisdom. That old serpent, the devil, &gt;&gt; he was a robber, a thief. And the Bible said a thief came to ruin and to destroy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he came in through the woman. He couldn't come through the man because that man was in the image of God. &gt;&gt; He was infallible. &gt;&gt; He cannot be deceived. &gt;&gt; But the woman can be deceived. And he came through the woman and preached another gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like Apostle Paul call it, another gospel to this woman. And the woman said amen to it and believed it and fell for it. &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right. &gt;&gt; And the man came and met the woman falling. Adam saw the woman, she was already a fallen woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before Adam ever knew the woman, she was already a fallen woman, &gt;&gt; a fallen church by traditions of man, &gt;&gt; by another gospel, deceivers. &gt;&gt; And brother Brown told us, you know, that there's going to be deceivers of the third bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. He said, "For this is the third bride. The first bride was deceived." That was Adam's bride. &gt;&gt; And the second bride was Jehovah's bride, which was the nation of Israel. &gt;&gt; And the third bride, we are the bride. &gt;&gt; The bride of the second Adam. But brother, the deceiver of the third bride are here today to preach another gospel. But brothers and sister, you and I, we have been predestinated not to fall &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world. &gt;&gt; We were ordained, &gt;&gt; predestinated not to fall. We are infallible this morning. &gt;&gt; Come on. How many of you believe that? &gt;&gt; Oh my God. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. another gospel. This scientist came and he started to preach another gospel like we have a lot of them today on earth preaching you know their wisdom preaching their understanding leaning to their own understanding. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Going you know to Facebook and Google and WhatsApp and internet trying you know to bring confusions. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord. Trying to send, you know, that bride back to delusion &gt;&gt; and a state of deluge. That was what, you know, their mind was all about and not that gospel. Amen. They are scientists anyway. &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brothers? &gt;&gt; But brothers, we are scientists also. We are scientists. Amen. The prophet said, spiritual scientist. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what we are. We are God's astronauts. Amen. We are spiritual scientists. Amen. And we are in God's laboratory to tap the inexhaustible resources. &gt;&gt; Amen. Whereas the natural scientists today, the prophet said they broke into God's laboratory &gt;&gt; and they are fooling themselves to kill themselves. &gt;&gt; The same thing to the devil. in the garden of Eden, you know, that came through the serpent unto the woman. Hallelujah. To preach another gospel in order, you know, to pervert the true gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And any man who broke into another people's home or property is a robber and a thief. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And it should be mercilessly dealt with. Are you here, church? &gt;&gt; And that's what the devil was. Satan their father is a thief and a robber. He's a liar. He only came to kill and to destroy. Amen. Let me tell brothers and sisters, there's no need for you, you know, to be worried. There's no need for you to be disturbed. There's no need for you, Hallelujah, to be weary and to be weak and to be tired. You take possession of that which belongs to you. God's laboratory is your possession. &gt;&gt; Amen. Every blessing in the book belongs to you. Every book in the every blessing in the storehouse belongs to you. Hallelujah. There's healing there. There is blessing there. There is victory there. Hallelujah. Inexhaustible resources that are there are ours. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not fooling around with nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. We are claiming that which belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Is our possession. Amen. Oh, praise the Lord. You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; It belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Healing belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost belongs to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says children's bread. It belongs to us. The spoken word belongs to us. The thoughtful manifestations belong to us. It is ours, brothers. Amen. And don't you never be confused. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Be not dismayed at the signs of heaven." &gt;&gt; For the hidden are dismayed at these things. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Don't be confused when you see things happening everywhere. Don't be confused. The devil has invented things. &gt;&gt; That's right. And those things that the devil has infected, remember we have them at our tip today. We use the good part, we drop the bad part is knowledge of good and evil. &gt;&gt; That's the truth. That's what science is. And the brother, I don't care what the science says. Hallelujah. I come back to what the world says. I come back to the gospel. I come back to the original. Hallelujah. I come back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. Oh my. Now we find out that he corrupted the world by his wisdom. And Eve fell for it. And Adam was not deceived, but Adam, you know, went in there with his 2020. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Playing the role of a savior to bring back the woman. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was Adam. She was not deceived. No, she was not deceived. Hallelujah. You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love him this morning. &gt;&gt; Adam went in there, you know, to bring her back. But Adam in the process of playing the role of a savior for the woman &gt;&gt; because she loved her. &gt;&gt; Amen. thereby sed his possession &gt;&gt; for fated &gt;&gt; everything. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That was what Adam did. And then that was how good news &gt;&gt; ended. That was the end of good news. And then the prophet of the almighty God says when everything fell, he said then hers went back home weeping. &gt;&gt; Your son is lost. &gt;&gt; But Abraham said angels went back home weeping. Your son is lost. Bad news. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God for our heavenly father. For God so loved the world. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God so loved the world that when God had it, God came down. In Genesis in chapter three, God himself, he came down. He never sent another man. He came down. Heaven came down. God came down. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And God came down &gt;&gt; and he had a conference right there in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And at the conference, there was a conclusion reached. &gt;&gt; And the conclusion was Genesis 3:15. The seed of the woman shall bruise the head of the serpent, and the seed of the serpent shall bruise the heel of the seed of the woman. Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my, what a wonderful news. Again, is brutal, but it's news. &gt;&gt; And I will see from the scripture this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; For God said there will be a seed of the woman. And that was why Genesis 3:15, which was the seed of God, the spoken word, you know, has to find a place &gt;&gt; for is the spoken word and it must be quickened. &gt;&gt; And Isaiah in chapter 7:14, he caught that. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then when Isaiah caught that, then what did he do? He said, "Behold, a virgin shall conceive." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceived. Oh, what a glorious thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 3:15 produces Isaiah 7:14. &gt;&gt; And Isaiah 7:14 produces Matthew 1 and two. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the angel &gt;&gt; said unto the woman over there in the book of Luke in chapter two at the birth of Jesus Christ he said hey Mary you are highly faithful. &gt;&gt; Are you here with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said you shall give birth to a child. He said, "How shall these things be seen that I know not?" He said, "The power of the highest." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Shall I overshadow thee &gt;&gt; is an overshadowing power. &gt;&gt; There's going to be a creation, &gt;&gt; a creation that Mary knew nothing about, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; That Mary did not contribute nothing. No egg, no nothing, no h. But God created the eggs and the the the seed &gt;&gt; and deposited inside the woman that should pass through the woman and the passing through the woman it will become our brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when it passes through the woman, are you hearing me? You know, then it becomes our brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For is now a king's man to ros. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Without him passing through the woman, he will not be able, you know, to die. In Genesis chapter 3, God cannot die. &gt;&gt; In Genesis chapter 14, when he was here on earth in the form of Theophanic Mechisedc, he cannot die. &gt;&gt; But brother, in the book of Matthew, when God became flesh, &gt;&gt; and dwell among us, &gt;&gt; he was our brother. That's why you know the same God in Genesis chapter 3 that came down is the same God again in Matthew is God. God God is our redeemer. There's no any other person that can redeem. It has to be God himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he came down in the form of the flesh. Pay the price. He came down and died. God. Oh brothers, when he was born, the Bible says Luke chapter 2 from verse 8, what did it says there? I mean Luke chapter 2. Yes, the angel in the book of Luke chapter 2, I think. Praise the Lord. Oh my. Yes. In verse eight, he said, "And there were shepherd." Amen. Look at it. There were shepherd. Somebody, are you with me? &gt;&gt; He said, "And there were in the same country, shepherds abiding in the field, keeping watch over their flock by night. And Lord, the angel of the Lord came upon them. And the glory of the Lord shone round about them, and they were sure afraid. And the angel said unto them, Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, &gt;&gt; Amen, &gt;&gt; which shall be to all people. For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Savior, which is Christ the Lord. Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Somebody say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The good news is back on earth again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ, when he was born right there in Bethlehem in the city of David, the angel came down and the angel told the shepherd, he said, "Fear not. There's nothing to be worried about. There's nothing to be afraid about. Can't you see, brothers and sisters, he has to first of all tell them, "Fear not." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time, "Fear not." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Each time that the angel is bringing good news, brothers and sisters, is fear not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's going to be good news here, fear not. Amen. Fear not. I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people. All people. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Good news &gt;&gt; is back on earth again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see how he works. So therefore you know when the good news came back to the earth then brother but Abraham said that was good news when Jesus Christ was born the message it is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet said. It is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; It was good news. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 60. It said no wonder the gospel is good news. He said the very word gospel means the good news. &gt;&gt; The good news what if a man died for our sake that's good news. If Christ was born that's good news. Yes. &gt;&gt; But never a news, never was there news like this news that he who made the promise has confirmed the promise that is alive forever more and have the keys of both death and hell in his hand. All the gloom was shook away. There was no more gloom to be seen for the sun was up from the grave. There was no well he will come or he may come. He are already come. &gt;&gt; The good news the gospel good news. Norice the very message of the gospel itself is to prove to the people that he is risen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is risen. &gt;&gt; Oh my God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He is risen. God tell my disciple that I'm risen from the dead and I will meet with them to confirm this to them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God, how in this last days there shall be light again across the earth and I will prove to my disciples. Go tell them that I am not dead and I'm not a tradition but I am a living Christ. I will meet them. Take this message to my disciples that I am risen from the dead. The gospel good news. You say, "Is that right?" &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8 said is the same yesterday, today, and forever. We is beneficiaries are to prove his life in us now. The beneficiaries of this life. The life there never was a life lived like it. He was the son of God and he died and that shut it out. But when he raise again from the dead on Easter morning, then we as his servant are commissioned by him to go into all the world and to bring this good news to every person &gt;&gt; that is are living. How can we and how can we do it by word only? For it is written, the gospel came not by word only, but through the power and the manifestation of the Holy Spirit to prove that he is alive. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; Good news, brother. Good news, sister. To you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That when he was born that the angel said, "Good news." &gt;&gt; That's right. good tidings of great joy. &gt;&gt; And when he died, he said, I have power to lay down my life and to take it up again. And brother Abraham said, Christ zeroed in at Calvary and wounded that animal called Satan forever. &gt;&gt; And he brought light to human race that because I live, you shall live also. &gt;&gt; Good news. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No wonder the prophet said when Jesus Christ died and rose again, he said that was the greatest news flash in history. &gt;&gt; The greatest news flash in the history. Hallelujah. What is it, brother? In John in Revelation chapter 5, we saw the the the the the picture of the event. You know how it happened? Oh man. When the when when the redeemer walk forth and took the book and he said I am the worthy one to take that book and to lose the services thereof. Hallelujah. And the book cannot be uh uh opened and cannot be the seven seals cannot be loosed. The book cannot be opened without the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of the redeemer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his blood Amen. You know opened the book. He opened the book. And then when the redeemer took the book, what happened? Something happened in heaven. Because before that time when there was no one worthy to take the book or to lose the services thereof, John said, "I wept." &gt;&gt; It was bad news. &gt;&gt; I wept. &gt;&gt; I wept bad news because we will all be lost. But brothers and sisters, one of the elders told John, he said, "We have non &gt;&gt; pastor John, are you here with me?" &gt;&gt; And I'm not just only talking to you because John represent the entire bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They predestinated. &gt;&gt; We acknowledge John. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the land of the tribe of Judah had prevailed to take the book and to lose the seven sees thereof. And the John said, I turned around to see the lamb, I mean the lion of the tribe of Judah. But he saw the lamb because that was the time hallelujah of redemption. Oh my. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And at that time there was jubilee in heaven because bad news turned to good news. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our bad news turned into good news. And but Abraham said in the message, &gt;&gt; yes. &gt;&gt; A man running away from the presence of the Lord, he said, I believe, I am prophesying. &gt;&gt; He's a great mystery will be made clear and the saddening heart will be turned to joy. &gt;&gt; Oh brother, this is the day, hallelujah, of good news to the bride. This is the day that our sadness is turning to joy. This is the day that our sorrow is becoming happiness. Brother, this is not the time to frown our faces. &gt;&gt; This is not the time to be sorry. &gt;&gt; This is the day of jubilee. &gt;&gt; And there was jubilee in heaven. &gt;&gt; Shouting in heaven at the taking of the book by the lamb. And brother, it was good news. And I'm telling you this morning, church, the book was not just only taken, but the book has been revealed unto the bride of Jesus Christ in this last days. And brother, this is not just a story. This is not just a meat. This is not just a makeup. This is the living reality of the living God that we can see in our day today.

Joyful day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. God's prophet said sad heart will be turned into joy. And I'm telling you, brothers, there's no need for you to weep. Weep no more, brothers, sister. Weep not, brothers. Weep not, sister. No matter how rough, no matter how bad, no matter how Oh, brother. No matter what the doctor said. &gt;&gt; The doctor's report is not your death sentence.

And brothers, I have the science book here with me this morning. The book of the great physician is here with me this morning. And this book says, "By my stripes you were healed." &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen.

That is what the doctor's book says. &gt;&gt; I believe the scientist &gt;&gt; the great physician. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm doubting what the headlessly scientist says &gt;&gt; because you cannot believe the true report.

That is the only gospel. The only gospel is Christ himself. &gt;&gt; Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. They are just writers of the gospel. That's why those gospels are called the gospel according to Matthew, &gt;&gt; the gospel according to Mark, the gospel according to Luke, the gospel according to John. They were called the four synoptic gospel. That's the synopsis of bereie gospel, the abstract, the writing of the gospel. And that's why Matthew looked at him and he saw him as the king. Mark said he's the sacrifice. Luke said he's the prophet, the son of man. And the John said is the deity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word made flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because they were looking from different angles. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; At the same gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And they can see him.

Is that the message of the hour? Yes, sir. The mystery mystery of God should be finished as he had declared unto his servant the prophet. Revelation 10:7. Is that right? And I want to tell you Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; For God was in Christ &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself. So God was revealed in Christ and the Christ is revealed in you and I. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the embodiment of deity. &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is our gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. with all his power, with all his defininity.

You have to get Joshua in you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In order to preach it, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why you know 10 spies. But Abraham said 10 was a bad number. Those 10 spies, they went there, they saw it, they came back and they said, "The land is real, but we cannot take it." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because we were like grasshopper. They were gi those 10 spies, they weakened the people for the promise. But Abraham said they are 10 theologians and we have a lot of them on the pit today that are preaching nothing but theology and not that gospel. Remember that's what they were preaching. They are scientist preaching another gospel preaching wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; against faith &gt;&gt; and multitude of people fell for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. But there were only two that still the people and said, "Be still. We are more than able to take the land. Let's go in all at once and possess the land. &gt;&gt; For the inhabitant of the land, they were afraid of us." &gt;&gt; And I tell you this morning, church, the land of promise is ours. &gt;&gt; Every promise in the book belongs to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And all the demons, they occupants, they are scared, they afraid of us because God has promised that I will send my fear before you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I will send my fear before you. The fear of God is going before us. The hornets are going before us. Hallelujah. God is our battle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jeremiah said, "The Lord thou art at my battle axe." Amen. Is going before us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have the power. We have the victory. &gt;&gt; We are more than able. That was the report of the two great men. And the who are those two? Caleb and Joshua. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Mother Abram said, "The Holy Ghost put upon my pen to write and to tell you that Caleb is the bride, the believers, and Joshua is the type of the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I tell you this morning, church, it is only the believer and the Holy Ghost that will be able to preach the gospel of the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. that will be able to believe the report of the bride &gt;&gt; that will be able to say this gospel, &gt;&gt; preach this gospel, live this gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nobody will be able to do that. But it will be you and the Holy Ghost and Joshua. And the when you have the Holy Ghost in you, that is the Joshua. And you can take the land. It belongs to you. There's nothing that the devil can do. You don't need to sign any memorandum of understanding with the devil. Hallelujah. Because he's scared already. &gt;&gt; He's afraid when you know your position. &gt;&gt; He's afraid of you. &gt;&gt; It's scared of you. &gt;&gt; The fear of God is going before you, church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? &gt;&gt; Amen. And brothers, when you are in that condition, amen, you are entering now into perfect faith, into a perfect rapture faith. You are getting into the bride material, &gt;&gt; into the rapturing condition. And the brother, you are already in an atmosphere &gt;&gt; for supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then in the atmosphere of supernatural, all things are possible in there. And your testimony will always be ringing and it will always be true. Hallelujah. Because that is the gospel. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That you carry. Not just pastor John, not just, you know, Reverend uh Bruce, not just Reverend Heron Gary, not just, you know, Pastor Gideon, not just any other ministers of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we all carry that. &gt;&gt; Ye are my witnesses. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said so every brothers, every sister, &gt;&gt; the bride. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says you will prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's talking about the bride because the bride in the omega church or in the alpha church prophesy signs and wonder miracle. Hallelujah. Oh brother, the alpha church had it and the omega church will have it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. you will prophesy again. &gt;&gt; So you got to take that book and he that book and become that word so that you can prophesy again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get that Joshua in you. &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Ghost in you.

Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are more than victor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Atmosphere for supernatural. Brothers, I stop you this morning by telling you this. In 2 Kings chapter 5, 2 Kings chapter 5, we saw that uh the Syrians went down, you know, to Israel and took them away captive. And brothers, we are here in the land of our captivity. is the land of our captivity. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Thank God, you know, for America. Thank God for every other country. Thank God for the liberty that you have to serve God. But brothers and sister, don't you never forget is a land of our captivity. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not our homeland. &gt;&gt; Heaven is our homeland. &gt;&gt; We were under captivity. &gt;&gt; And then you know it took them away into Syria. And they when they got to Syria, no more life, no more hope, no more expectations. Only God knows when the time to go back. But this lady, this lady, this bride, Hallelujah. Oh, praise the Lord. All is well. All is well. For we have had a message. Shalom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All is well. Amen. There is a place behind the veil, that Raven veil. Amen. A hiding place. Little bride. Rest. Live under that atmosphere. That lady was living under an atmosphere of supernatural. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She was not scared. She was not afraid. And then you know when she was living, look at it. She was living with a leper. In Israel, you don't live with leper. A leper must be excommunicated. &gt;&gt; A leper must be carried out of the town, out of the city and go and live in a secluded place, confined place. That's a leper, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Take them to leprosy and let them live in there. But she was living &gt;&gt; right there &gt;&gt; with a leper. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And let me tell you this. The Bible says Mayan was the captain of Syrian. He was a great man of valor, but he was a leper. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; An honorable man, but he was a leper. And we have a lot of them on here today. Leper. Lepers on the pulpit. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. Lepers they don't know what to do. They can they can't do nothing. &gt;&gt; They are dummies. They don't believe in Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today. Leopard &gt;&gt; great men, pastors, preachers, leper that with that supernatural and yet they are preaching the gospel. Oh no, another gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. great men, lepers and brothers. But this lady was living under the atmosphere, under the supernatural atmosphere. And she said, &gt;&gt; "Oh, oh, I wish my Lord Nean was with a prophet in Israel. He would just recover of his leprosy." &gt;&gt; Amen. The prophet of the Almighty God said that lady probably, you know, she hasn't seen Elijah heal a leper, but because she was brought up under the atmosphere &gt;&gt; of a home &gt;&gt; that believe in supernatural &gt;&gt; and I want to challenge you, you young boys and girls, our youth this morning, &gt;&gt; only believe all things are possible. Those who never doubt, supernatural God is still living and is alive and well. &gt;&gt; And he's here this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can do all things. Is in our home, is in our school, is in our working places. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we have a lot of people that are challenged and we should tell them the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell them about our God. Tell them about is omin. Tell them about how is the same yesterday, today and forever. &gt;&gt; Let's tell them this lady was speaking about the true God and the prophet messenger of the hour. &gt;&gt; And then when Mrs. Neman heard it, Mrs. Neman told the husband, the husband went to the king of Syria. The king of Syria gathered the gift together and wrote a letter to the king of Israel and sent Captain Nean, you know, to the king. You can just see how it's going. Ups ups ups ups. But brothers, the ups ups know nothing. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They knew nothing &gt;&gt; about the supernatural. &gt;&gt; They knew nothing about his omnipotent. That lady did not talk about ups. He wasn't talking about the politicians, about president, about governors, about senators, about house of rap member. He was not talking about that. He was talking about the omnipotent God. He was talking about Jesus Christ. He was talking about the prophet messenger that God has sent to that age. And I'm here this morning, brother. I am not talking about politics. I am not here talking about governor or president. I'm here brothers and sister talking &gt;&gt; Amen &gt;&gt; about the promises of God &gt;&gt; for this age &gt;&gt; God sent us a prophet &gt;&gt; Malachi for promised day &gt;&gt; and God brought it to pass in our day Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man is revealed we are living such a day we have seen supernatural in our day &gt;&gt; we have seen cancer being healed, TB being taken off. &gt;&gt; And if he did it one time, he can do it again. &gt;&gt; He will do it again. &gt;&gt; He will do it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe this morning, brothers, and that's what we are talking about. And brother, that is what we should talk. Amen. That is my gospel. That is the gospel of that little lady. That's the gospel of the little bride. Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me church? &gt;&gt; Our gospel is Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8, the prophet said that is the theme of our campaign. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brothers, when Neon got to Israel and the king got all the gift and he got the letter. &gt;&gt; He read the letter. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; See how this guy is seeking quarry. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. To kill and to make live. And he took his garment. &gt;&gt; And he tore his garment. &gt;&gt; And the prophet had it. Elisha. And Elisha the prophet said, "What? Send him here." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And we know that there is a God in Israel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brothers, don't be scared of nothing. Only believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All things are possible. We are built to believe. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Not to disbelieve. To believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why so many times, you know, we are faced with a lot of challenges. Those things are meant to build us. &gt;&gt; Yes. to build us, to grant us. The prophet of the Almighty God made us to understand that these are the process of character development, &gt;&gt; trials, &gt;&gt; difficult times, &gt;&gt; mountain things are meant to be stepping stone onto victory, &gt;&gt; we should not be deterred. We should not be confused. Right. Right. &gt;&gt; We should hold to God. And Neon got to the prophet's house. And then when he got in there, the prophet was told that Captain Nean, such a great man, is here looking for you, sir. Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord. And neon said what? Huh? I mean the the prophet said what? Okay. Uh one of you five-fold ministers. You have the gift also to pray for the sick. You can preach like the way I do. That is why you are ordained. Somebody are you here? &gt;&gt; The prophet of the Almighty God said that God raised up wonderful helpers for the messengers of the age. It's not just only the messenger alone but brother said God rest up what wonderful helpers &gt;&gt; wonderful helpers &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; to carry the message to preach that message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They may not just only play tape. They can read the Bible and preach church. And that is why I am here this morning brothers because I am ordained to pray church. I am called to pray church like any other fivefold. Amen. They are wonderful helpers. &gt;&gt; To preach the same message that Elisha was preaching. And the spirit of Elijah was upon Elisha. And God said, "I will use that spirit five times." And then we are right here at the fourth time when God is using the same spirit. And then you know God raised up men you know to carry that message. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the same way but Abraham said God will raise up young men that will preach this message in a more powerful way &gt;&gt; than it is. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe we are still doing poor job about it. But I believe you know that God can never fail. &gt;&gt; Amen. So therefore, our brothers and sisters, don't you never stop me from preaching it because the prophet said, "I shall preach it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm here preaching. I'm here preaching. Hebrews 13:8 is my gospel. &gt;&gt; Is the gospel of the bride? &gt;&gt; Somebody you believe this morning? &gt;&gt; And the when that man came out, one of the preachers, do you know what he said? He said the prophecy the prophecy the prophecy the prophecy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It praise the Lord. Oh my. And Nema was kind of looking. He said what? He said the prophecy. The prophet said, "Amen." And I'm here to tell you this morning the prophet said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." But Abraham said, "You are either a messenger of good news or bad news." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Is that a messenger? You are a messenger this morning. You are a messenger of good news or a messenger of bad news. Oh, isn't it beautiful to know that we are ambassadors, that we are angels, the messenger of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we are God's messenger to the sinful world. That Christ lives in our heart. He lives in our spirit.

He said, "How much less?" He told you to go and wash in Jordan's river. But Abraham said he can go away if he want to keep his leprosy. And brother, I don't want to keep my &gt;&gt; I don't want to keep my sickness. I don't want to do anything. I just want to obey &gt;&gt; what the gospel say, what the world says.
