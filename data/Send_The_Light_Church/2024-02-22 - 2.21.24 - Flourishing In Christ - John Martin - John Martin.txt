paying that price Lord that we could be saved today that we could be here today to worship you and to give you Thanksgiving from the with our hearts Lord we thank you for it today Praise Your Name Lord Jesus amen amen I believe he's he's pleased with that amen amen we can't we can't thank him enough for all that he's done for us amen God bless you it's really good to see brother Bob Crawford here with us what a what a great blessing and it's good to see each and every every one of you amen and it's good to have Ann to make sure that I got my buttons on and everything's going good yes turn with me if you would to the Book of Psalms for our opening scriptures how many remember the book of Psalms chapter 1 that's usually a a familiar set of scriptures for most of us amen let's let's read the first six verses we'll have a a word of prayer and then then be seated the scripture says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners nor sth in the seat of the scornful but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the go ungodly they're not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the Judgment nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous for the Lord knoweth the way of the righteous but the way of the ungodly Shall Perish amen and let's look to the author Heavenly Father we thank you Lord that you have preserved your word for us in this age we could have confidence when we're reading it it is your word it hasn't been mixed with man's but it is exactly your word to us Lord and we're looking to you this evening Lord to give us the revelation of this word and how this word might be a benefit for each and every one of our Lives by father we pray that you'd help us now just to set aside Lord all the things of the day all the thoughts that we could just focus this next little bit on you I pray Lord that you come and reveal uh yourself to us through these scriptures Lord we'll be careful to honor you and to praise you and to give you thanks for all these things for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and God bless you you may be seated if we were to go to the the Beatitudes there's about nine or ten things in the Beatitudes it starts out that we're blessed if we're poor in spirit if we mourn if we Meek if we if we thirst hunger for righteousness if we're merciful we are blessed if we're these things amen but in Psalms 1 we're blessed if we don't do these things and it's it's uh there's a little nugget I think hidden in here and I want to really focus on verse one today because um we're blessed if we don't do these three things that it's talking about we're we're just blessed and uh I I think you know we look at blessings coming in different ways different forms different shapes and I want to take a look at this one because this is a real wonderful Psalms and want want to entitle this flourishing with Christ because we are told that we'll be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and and that our fruit will come forth and It season and we won't wither we'll stay we'll stay in the presence of God and and and stay uh in love with God and and and bearing that fruit and and then this promise of whatsoever we're do we're going to prosper all because we don't do these three things amen I I just I I it just really grabbed me and I wanted to go through it the first one here that's mentioned is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly or we might say ungodly counil now counsel is simply given advice especially as a result of of a consultation and you know we all like to give advice amen we probably would rather give advice then take advice right that's just kind of our nature council could be a lawyer engaged in a trial appointed to advise or represent legal matters and there's been times that we we've heard from a number of people that a lawyer uh gave wrong counsel he gave the wrong advice it didn't work out for our favor can you say Amen to that are you with me but there's also spiritual counsel Good Counsel and brother brandom said that we come to church to find out where we're standing with God so we might say it like this that we could get good counsel in the house of the Lord amen Godly counsel 2 Timothy 3:16 Says all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and it is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction and right that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen we have everything that we could possibly need right in the Bible for our counsel amen one time David took his eyes off the Lord and he was F focusing on the prosperity of the wicked which didn't make sense to him at all and he said his foot almost slipped until he said I went into the sanctuary of God then I understood their end amen he maybe didn't get comfort from the aspect that the wicked were still getting Prosperity but he understood their end all because he came to church amen and so to me I don't care what it is in life there's an answer in the Bible there is absolutely an answer in the Bible for us and we should gain confidence and spend more time reading the Bible Psalms 3311 says the counsel of the Lord standeth forever and the thoughts of his heart are to all generations so God isn't going to change his mind in this generation just because we got cars his word Remains the Same amen Psalm 73:24 says Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterwards receive me to Glory amen counsel is important amen did you know God uses the office of a pastor to get us to the other side in other words he plays a vital role in guiding his counsel to us is really more important than what the devil wants us to know his role is different than the other fourfold uh Ministries that God has put for our Perfection and we must understand that um when we're we're get we're trying to get counsel we must have confidence in the office that God provided and not the man amen God honors the office because man fails but if your confidence is in the word if your confidence is in what God spoke then God will honor your faith and lead you to the other side that's just the truth now believers who are not established we've seen this young believers not established can end up running we heard from Pillar To Post just going looking for advice and unfortunately the nature of the flesh is to take counsel from someone who they already that already agrees with them are you you understand what I'm saying if you're not getting the answer you want you go to somebody else until they agree with you if they don't agree you go to somebody else and finally they agree with you and you say okay yeah this is I took counsel from this person every man is right in his own eyes and it's hard to get away from that that that attitude so we can end up taking advice from a wrong Source or a wrong spirit wrong Spirits have the largest wardrobe the largest wardrobe they have clothes for every occasion every situation that you could possibly be in the devil is right there trying to give you wrong advice trying to stir you in the wrong direction yes I say if the advice isn't coming from the word of God you're not going to be blessed amen amen so watch out who your friends are right who you're listening to amen ungodly Spirits unawares get on us through people and before you know it we'll start acting like the person who were hanging around with who we taking advice from now I don't you understand now here's what's really really dangerous we all have friends that are in the world Associates people that we know people that we like people that we get along with people who we wish we're in the truth right amen the thing is if we're not careful we'll start listening to them because we got it in and that's what the devil uses it's still ungodly counil and I'm going to show you how if you just give me a little bit of time in General whatever you spend time doing that's what you're going to be influenced by the prophet simply said if you if you read your Bible and you pray well then you'll just become more spiritual right if you want to become more spiritual read your Bible play You're influenced by by God Through the Bible and through prayer well what happens when you're hanging around somebody else who's not the Bible who's not this the the spirit of Christ you're going to get influenced by them unawares unawares and before you'll know it you're going to start acting like and I have seen it so many times so the more time you spend with God the more you'll become like God Amen and if you spend your time with carnal things or carnal people you'll become more carnal and not even realize it so taking advice from a person who isn't presently surrendering their life to God is unwise you don't want to take advice from somebody who won't surrender their life to God even though it sounds good even though you agree with it you don't have to agree with it for it to be right it just has to be in the word are you with me amen Paul said to the galatian church he said as we said before so I now say again in other words I'm not changing it if any man preach any other gospel unto you than what ye have received let him be a cursed right amen a person who isn't humbly walking under the influence of the word of God is being led by another Spirit he's being influenced by another Spirit I'll say say it like this it's a false light we've heard many times the greatest robbery that ever took place happened with a false light and Satan wants to mix counsel little good little bad that's how he catches amen but you don't want to walk in that Council amen everything you could possibly need is already in the Bible we just need to learn to Humble ourselves go to the word and say God show too often we just we go to somebody else and try to get their opinion you know you're always going to be tossed around and and changing if you do that you don't want to do that just get real serious with God get real get real sincere with God and God will show you what to do amen amen so if you want God to bless your life separate yourself from ungodly counsel you can't just expect to be blessed in the world and be taking advice from people or from wrong Spirits I don't care if it's Google I don't care if it's people in the world I don't care if it's someone coming to church or a family member choose the counsel of someone who's walking a surrendered life to the word someone who's under subjection to the word someone who's surrendered because they're not going to lead you astray too often we we think it's not that oh it's not so bad if I'm listening to so and so really are they they they taking you right back to a Crucified Life are they taking you right back to the word or they saying to you well yeah that just doesn't matter how many times have we heard Satan say to us through somebody it doesn't matter you don't have to do that see that's you don't want to walk in that kind of counsel you will never be blessed you'll only be blessed if you separate from that why would we want to take counsel or advice from a person who isn't willing to pay the price thems so let's give it the word test turn with me if you would to First John chapter 4 I was thinking about this in our men's meeting today but I didn't want to bring it up because I was going to bring it up today how do we know God's speaking to us that's kind of what we were one of the topics we were talking about anyways and here in 1 John chapter 4 the Bible says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world there's many of them the very fact that you have fallen that you have you that we've all come short of the glory of God that means false Spirits have gotten on us and we've said things and done things that were wrong so we don't want to take counsil from just one another I'm sorry I don't care if we're better than the church down the street or uh somebody else in the world we got to go back to the source we got to go right to the word we got to make sure it's the word amen hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God now that's not just confessing Jesus has come in the flesh the Devils believe that in fact when Jesus was here G they said to Jesus why have you come to torment us before a time so obviously that type of believing that Jesus has come in the flesh is not what he's referring to every spirit this is the John Martin interpretation here every spirit that manifest Jesus Christ in the flesh is of God now that's the interpretation of that scripture so if the person in front of you is manifesting Jesus Christ in their flesh well then I think you could listen to that Spirit but how many people we know talk the talk but don't walk the walk so they're not manifesting Christ why would you take counsel of that you're you're just it's like play rule out it's it's gambling Paul said it's just a form if it's just a form he said turn away we can't have a form of godliness we need the manifestation of it brother Brandon was constantly showing the people that Jesus was in the flesh he would constantly say that he'd take the take us back to the woman that was at the well and he you know he would be speaking that that this is Christ manifested today the same yesterday today and forever he took us back to Jesus Christ being manifested showing that the word the spirit that was behind what he was preaching was of Christ so we wouldn't have to question we wouldn't have to doubt verse three and every spirit that is not manifesting the word in flesh is not of God I like that every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh is not of God and this is the spirit of what Antichrist where of ye have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world ye are of God little children have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world oh what does that mean if the manifestation of Christ is in you you will overcome whatever Spirit you're dealing with amen that's what it means to be greater in you if it's manifested it can't be any greater than manifested on your out of your flesh that's what makes you an overcomer not because you think you got more than somebody else because it's the the that word that Spirit of Christ that word is so powerful it's manifested that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so walking with the wrong counsel will always lead us to a spiritual downturn with our walk with the with the Lord you know brother Brandon makes this statement he says I'd rather have the wrong Doctrine and have the right spirit and to be absolutely right with my Doctrine and my spirit be off he chose the manifestation of the word over the doctrine of the word that's what he did he chose the manifestation of the spirit of the word in flesh over any word or any Doctrine on its own showing is how important it is to be living the life amen I you know it's like we should not be scared that we're wrong about certain doctrines we should be wrong that we're not living the word that we know to be living so if you want God to bless you more we just need to choose to separate from counsel that's outside of God's word amen just just make that decision I'm going to do it right now I'm going to like like be careful about who I'm listening to too often we become the judge of the council we shouldn't be doing that as if our our discernment is is the the right thing the word it just needs to be the word God don't want the pressure on us to be the word he's the word blessed is the man that walth not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of Sinners so this next one is blessed is the man that standeth not in the way of sinners now the way of a sinner is self-willed it's the self willed way self-willed way that is the way of a sinner there is a way which seeth right unto man but the end thereof are the ways of death this this self-will is so deceptive because of every man feeling right in his own eyes turn with me if you would to Second Peter chapter 2 verse 10 we're just going to be talking about the way of Sinners which you know you're kind to look too far in the world and you see a whole world full of Sinners don't you but sometimes we could walk in that same way we're not as bad as them as it were but God's not grading on this scale we could still walk in their way and not be part of the World by Simply Having a self-will among us all right verse 10 says but chiefly them that walk after the Flesh in the lust of uncleanness look at they despise government presumptuous are they self-willed they are not even afraid to speak evil Vil of dignities see the way of Sinners is self-willed they're full of presumptions they have no problem speaking evil they just presume all that they say all that they do it's okay this is a way of a sinner and it's so easy for a Christian to walk in that way not even realize it how they walk how they talk self-willed I'll say like this without the fear of God without I could be wrong without I need to be careful without what we heard last service walking after the flesh despised governments presumptuous self-willed not afraid to speak evil look at verse 11 whereas Angels which are greater in power and might bring not a railing acquisation against them before the Lord and Angels haven't done anything wrong in heaven right but they are so full of the fear of God that they just don't use their mouth to speak whatever they want to speak amen I am telling you the way of Sinners is much closer to us than what we realize how are we going to be blessed when we're walking in the way of Sinners we can't so I'm just focusing on this first verse by simply separating from these things we automatically get blessed we don't have to go looking for blessings we don't have to go looking for Prosperity it just happens when you step away from the things of this world let's drop down to verse 15 which have forsaken the right way and gone astray following a different way the way of bam that's son a um buzar who loved the wages of unrighteousness wow there's a little example of of a wage of unrighteousness you shut the door on my toll you know you did it you wanted to make sure that you gave me the rough shoulder you walk out and the way of unrighteousness is for me not to forgive you that's the way of unrighteousness me for the person that did that that's up between them and God but you see we can go after other I'm going to show them who whoa whoa whoa what are you going to show them right we've got to show them the way of righteousness it's easy to forsake the right way and to go in the way of Sinners and not really realize it because we're still Christian we still go to church we still say we believe God but we're not re recognizing what's happening inside of us but was rebuked for his iniquity the dumbass speaking with man's voice forbade The Madness of the Prophet wow it can get pretty bad things ever get so bad that something bad something really weird had to happen to get your attention oh yeah oh yeah for sure God knows how to get our attention amen so there's two ways there's God's way which is the right way under subjection to the word and then there is the the the self-willed way it's the UN Godly way that people walk in it they're just not subject to the word you give them the word and they say don't you don't you tell me they may not say it with their words they may just like be resistant to it that's the wrong way it's the wrong way one way is hard one way is easy one way is narrow one way is Broad One Way leads to Life One Way leads to destruction right blessed is the man that standeth not in the way of Sinners and what that really means is blessed is the man that does not abide or dwell in the way that Sinners are in I mean Sinners are just Sinners they just go live any way they want to they don't answer to anybody and we can literally if we're not careful slip into that attitude right amen I'm not saying we go back out in the world I'm not saying we forsake God I'm not saying we forsake church but the devil knows how to get in there and get us to just like stop caring I'm just going to chill out here I'm going to abide here I'm going to dwell here I'm just going to take a a backseat here that's the way of a sinner it's easy the way of a sinner is very easy you can do what you want to do you can say what you want to say and there's no accountability amen so the way of a sinner is without the fear of God brother BR said God's way the the Christian way is a hard rugged life it's choosing to suffer for the will of God it's rejoicing in our trials that we might be partakers of the sufferings of Christ the Bible says Moses chose God's way Hebrews 11:25 says Moses choosing rather to suffer the Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ's greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had re he had respect unto the recompense of reward so God's way is the harder harder way God's way sometimes you just want to speak up but God's way says don't say nothing what you know our we just want to just give our two cents put the person in their place God says just a soft answer right now just get things under control turn away wrath amen see there's a difference between the way of a sinner the way he handles things and the way that God handles things do you know brother brandom chose to suffer Affliction with the people of God and he he had respect for the right reward he didn't go after temporary satisfaction he didn't go after money or vain Glory or Desiring popularity in the message the Easter seal brother brandom reads the prophecy that was given to him in in tongues now listen to this he said because thou has chosen the Narrow Path the harder way thou has walked of your own choosing thou has picked the correct and precise decision and it is my way and because of this momentous decision a huge part of Heaven awaits thee what a glorious decision you made this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass a tremendous victory in love divine now he chose to walk in God's way which was harder he chose to separate from popularity and look at me and I'm right and money and all the other things he could have gained in the position that he was in that's right but he chose to not walk in the way of Sinners I'm not mistaken I could be wrong and if if I need to be corrected I I'll I'll I'll correct but I believe that there was a time that there was a someone that got healed some person and they were attached to a lot of money and that person it seems they sent two FBI agents over with like a a a million point8 or something like that to give to brother brandom as as an offering and and and he could use it for the ministry or and he chose not to receive it he could have been a been denomination probably much if you would have just chose the other way brother brandham like Moses had respect for the right reward and the reward that we're looking for is the reward that God gives us for walking in the way of a Christian the way of the word amen choosing the right way is more difficult than we realize it's not a you you choose it one time and then the rest of your life it you you just follow it we are constantly choosing every day many times a day the harder way and it's very easy that we could slip and get off of it we see examples in the Bible so we need to be on guard amen all hell is against anyone who's consciously choosing to walk the harder way every day amen that's why Satan is always presenting to us an easier way to walk in oh you don't got to do that you don't got to turn and you don't got to and you don't got to God knows this is all you have to do it'll be just fine you can you can have what you you can have what you want you can do what you want to do he's always presenting that to us in different kind of outfits no matter what our situation is all hell is against us from choosing the harder way Satan Works day and night trying to convince us of anything except stay with the word amen he's trying to get us to compromise Satan's way Satan's way is the way that's outside of God's will Satan's way is self-willed every more every man is born in Satan's way he's born with I'm going to do what I want to do even if my mom or my dad tell me not to do it I will find a way to trick to deceive to lie because I want to do what I want to do and that is the reason every man must be born again with another spirit that he can do the will of God he's born by the will of God to obey the will of God and I'll tell you that's hard to do that every day if you're honest if you're really truly sincerely honest that is not easy because you're fighting against a flesh that Satan knows how to use in Satan's way every person experiences being right in their own eyes why else would Jesus say If any man come after me let him deny himself pick up his cross and follow me so the only way a man will ever question anything about his own views his own opinions is to literally humble himself and say I could be wrong I could be walking in the way of Sinners I need to be sure about this Proverbs 3:7 says be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from Evil Satan's way is without proper headship Satan offered a third of the Angels Freedom Liberty to do what you want to do and you don't have to listen to God's strict rules he offers a freefor all go where you want do what you want to do it's is a manipulative tactic to mislead and he can get us sucked into that to where we can vaunt our own self get angry think ill gossip hate one another and still think we're okay but we're under the wrong headship and any have you know how it is when somebody's trying to make things right with you but you're too mad and angry to to to to help bridge the gap come on it's just it's it's it's the way of a sinner the way of a sinner is unforgiveness the way of a sinner is is is not to stand in the Gap it's so easy to get caught in those things and we don't even realize it so when we surrender Our Lives to the headship of God's word we come under subjection to God's headship and we're not under God's headship unless we're under the word amen it's when we realize that our fleshly mind is enmity against Christ so we learn to Humble ourselves we learn to be subject to one another in the fear of the Lord we learn to walk in the spirit we learn to live for others whatever the words says the bride begins to bring herself under subjection to that one step at a time whatever the prophet taught she comes under subjection to it this is what it means not to walk in the way of Sinners right I know it's it's a lot for that one verse but I just want to break it down it's not until we surrender to the world word that we're under the proper headship righten I want to make this statement and I want us to be careful to listen to it if our spirit is not under subjection to the spirit of God in another person person we're not being subject to God we're not being subject to God's headship right and this is a hard one because what it does it forces us to know that God could be speaking to us through another human being I'm going to give you some scriptures for that 1 Corinthians 14:32 the spirit of the prophets are subject to the prophets amen verse 33 for God is not the author of confusion 1 Peter 55 they all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility amen Ephesians 5:21 submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God I could be wrong so just because you don't agree God's could be speaking to you through another person and if we're not under subjection to that you're not being under subjection to God it isn't that person that you're rejecting it's God and you don't even realize it sometimes God uses other people to speak to us the truth he's Sovereign he can do what he wants to do amen so we need to be sensitive to the spirit of God in others at all times so often when I'm talking to somebody I'm staring at a spirit that's speaking to me much more than I'm listening to the whatever the conversation is I just you just can't help it and it's an automatic thing right amen so when we separate ourselves from the self-willed way God he's going to automatically bless you just by stepping out of that stepping out of that I'm going to do it my way the Frank Sinatra way blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of the Sinners and this last one nor sth in the seat of the scornful now why is this one a seat why is the scornful one a seat and this is me my brother I don't believe they're they're willing to get off their seat to actually do something to help the situation people who scorn are not only critical but they're typically lazy they only use their mouth they have no problem being negative about things but they won't get up and help somebody with the situation they have no problem being brass and arrogant or cruel but they don't want to get up from the position that they're in how how they're viewing and actually go help the situation that's why I call is it's why I think it's a seat they just want to stay right there in the position that they're in stay with what they concluded it's an awful sight to see someone murmuring complaining scorning someone else look we're we've all got we've all become guilty of sitting in this seat at one time or another so there's there's no point in the fingers here but I I just want us to get more blessed and I I think if we get off this seat don't ever get on that seat we'll be blessed ways that we've never perhaps seen before so when you try to correct someone who's sitting on this seat what happens they often get offended they'll start scorning you for correcting something you did to somebody else Proverbs 98 says reprove not a scorner lest he hate thee rebuke a wise man and he will love thee amen it all depends Amen on who you're talking to does the person in love with God or are they not because you know people you don't even have to be spiritual to be critical so if you're hating someone giving them the cold shoulder shoulder scorning them a little bit just because they're trying to hold your actions accountable I say humble yourself and be wise and get off that seat there were 1.8 million so-called Believers that were murmuring against the headship of God first uh Corinthians 105 says but with many of them God was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness it wasn't because they were saying oh I just want to do the right thing I I I didn't mean to murder I didn't mean to complain oh they were just they were so right this was just unfair what they had to go through they didn't have no problem saying you know Moses isn't the the the true Prophet we need to raise somebody else up and take us back to Egypt and I'll tell you there were only just a few people who didn't walk in that way what did Moses do what did Joshua do what did Caleb do what did Aaron do they separated themselves from that Spirit they the Bible says they were of another Spirit blessed is the man that doesn't sit in the seat of the scornful you are a minority if you're not sitting down scorning somebody you are part of the little flock that God promised to give you the kingdom because the majority of the people have no problem saying well I don't think she should do this and she should do that and he should do that and he shouldn't do that get off that seat and go wash their feet that's the example that Jesus gave us get off that seat go wash his feet and help them help her well I should have to says who well God didn't tell me you know what if you got to hear an audible voice to do what the word has already told you to do something's wrong with your experience amen something is wrong you don't need a personal invitation to do what the word already says to do right amen if we have a problem go help them we need need to stop the gossiping about things stop the backbiting the devouring tattling go take care of things with meekness and the love of God in your heart God never made you an administrator of negative conversations sometimes you know we're you know we just become some administrator Satan is the only one that's the accuser of the brother and when we start doing it you know what side we're on we're in the wrong way around the wrong seat I mean Satan when he accuses us you know how it is when Satan accuses you he put you in a spot where there's no way out there's no hope for you you're you're not even a Christian God don't love you Christian wouldn't do what you did sometimes we say the same thing oh if they were a Christian they wouldn't have did that if they really love God they wouldn't have treated me like that we end up doing the same thing I'm telling you all we have to do is separate from that seat just separate from it you'll automatically be blessed amen you'll be an oddball there'll be something different about you amen God will start blessing you when you stop being negative all right separating from these things when we get up and separate from the scornful seat God is Promised Blessings Now I believe he'll take the fear that we're dealing with and he'll turn it into faith I believe he'll fill our heart with love I believe he'll load us with blessings that we haven't been experiencing there's a reason that God doesn't bless us we probably could do a series on that because we all want the blessings of God right and look God is able to make all grace abound to us he's also able to withhold it he's the one that makes the say so and I I just love that he let me know that I'm going to be blessed if I don't do those things just separate from those things there's a lot in there in that one verse so if we want to flourish more we must learn to separate ourselves from these things from certain things we don't want to be just a a hearer of the word today and say we we we like that word but we got to separate from the carnal nature and just purpose in our heart when we leave here I'm going to separate from these things I'm going to make a conscious decision to separate from these things you want to do that amen the Bible says whatsoever they whatever they do they're going to prosper just by separating can you imagine everything you do like Joseph just prospering the ungodly are like the chaff which the wind driveth away I don't want to be driven away from God's blessings I want to be real close to them so I just want to give some scriptures here to help encourage us that God is calling us to separate from these things the Bible says come out of her my people that you be not part partakers of her sins that you receive not her plagues amen 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse4 I'll just try to get through this as quick as I can here 2 Corinthians 6:14 be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship have righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion have light with darkness and what Concord have Christ with belile or what part have he that believeth with someone that doesn't believe Like You Believe come on and what agreement have the temple of God with Idols for ye are the Temple of the Living God as God have said I will dwell in them I will walk in them I will be their God they shall be my people wherefore conclusion wherefore come out from among the mix and be ye separate sayeth the Lord and touch not the unclean thing and I will bless you I will bless you I will receive you amen and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty now we're all Sons and Daughters here this is not a a message to Sinners trying to get you to come to Christ this is not the group but I do believe God is calling us to the top of the pyramid we've got to separate if we want to be blessed with the bride of Jesus Christ I want to prosper I want to flourish with Christ and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season and his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper you know I'm heading there I'm not there yet but I'm heading there I'm going in that direction Brother Bruce I'm heading there because I believe God has a blessing for us amen amen you got time for one more because I I I I still got five minutes this this I believe if we put this into practice this is a little bit easier to do this one it'll get us to where we want to get to look at verse two of Psalms 1:2 says but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night that's right so you draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you amen the more we meditate on God the more we'll flourish right all right turn with me to Psalms 19 verse2 Psalms 19:12 who can understand his errors you know what's confusing we do things we don't want to do we don't do things we should do we're perplexed at times because we're Christians we want to do the right thing but we find ourselves in states of just uncontrollable Behavior so who can understand his errors it takes God to help us right cleanse thou me from Secret faults amen this is something that nobody knows about this is just kind of between you and God secret faults keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins got that word again let them not have dominion over me then shall I be upright and I shall be innocent from the great transgression how often do we do things assuming it's okay with God how often do we take wrong counsel even from a believer that isn't according to the scriptures how often do we assume our self-willed behavior isn't really going to harm anybody or harm anything or how often do we say little negative things about others assuming that it's not that big a deal everybody does it this type of attitude can quickly the Bible says take dominion over a Believer and not even know it in other words they're walking around all the time just presumptuous about everything so we must make a conscious decision to separate from an attitude that just just presumes being right all the time and the fear of of the Lord as we heard last service is the beginning of wisdom we got to start instituting that that I could be wrong all right let's look at this last verse here number 14 let the words of my mouth the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength and my redeemer amen if we don't pursue this Heart Of God I want to I want to get off the seat I don't want to stand in the in the wrong the the way that of self-will and and and and I just I don't want to take counsel from just oh anybody because they're my friend Lord I really want my meditation to be on the word amen I want to think the word I want to speak the word and when I'm doing that I know it's acceptable in your sight amen let's Stand Together God bless you you know I honestly had the other half of that was the rest of the Psalms but I just knew I couldn't even get to it I was I wasn't even G to started just that one verse if we could do that one verse walk away separate from those things we got blessings coming and we weren't even like God bless me just God just does it for following his word amen let's sing um can we sing two songs can we sing We Walk in the light as he is in the light walk where the do drops all ye Saints of light Proclaim Jesus the light light of the world life and mercy in his name Jesus
