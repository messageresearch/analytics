[37:44] the glory in Jesus Christ's precious
[37:46] name amen amen amen turn with me if you
[37:50] would to the book of Jude for three
[37:53] scriptures of
[37:54] reading or uh I should say two verses
[37:57] and then have you be
[37:59] seated good to see sister uh
[38:03] Amanda I saw her uh good to see them
[38:07] back
[38:10] amen amen
[38:13] Jude um I always say chapter
[38:16] one is just not used to just saying
[38:20] Jude but verse number three and verse
[38:24] number
[38:25] 20
[38:28] Jude speaking here beloved when I gave
[38:30] all diligence to write unto you of the
[38:32] common salvation it was needful for me
[38:34] to write unto you and exhort you that
[38:36] you should earnestly contend for the
[38:39] face that was once delivered unto the
[38:42] Saints amen amen then verse number
[38:46] 20 but ye beloved building up yourselves
[38:52] on the Most Holy Faith praying in the
[38:56] Holy Holy Ghost amen amen and God bless
[38:58] you you may be seated
[39:02] um uh this is a very uh of course we've
[39:08] faith is something that we need to
[39:11] constantly be activated in our lives and
[39:14] to grow in because it is the key to get
[39:17] us to where we want to get to we in fact
[39:19] the prophet taught us that we'll need a
[39:22] perfect Faith to make it into the
[39:23] Rapture amen I want to entitle this
[39:26] message said struggling for Faith
[39:30] struggling uh for
[39:32] Faith and um as a first subject that
[39:36] faithfulness actually builds Faith amen
[39:39] I think one of the greatest reasons that
[39:41] people struggle to have faith in their
[39:44] life is that they're they're spiritually
[39:47] lazy I think it's one of the biggest
[39:49] reasons we we'll get into that but you
[39:51] know people just don't want to work for
[39:53] it right it's true and um
[39:58] uh there's this is a very not only a
[40:00] simplistic message but um as brother
[40:03] Marty would say he likes to see um
[40:06] practical things brought about things
[40:08] that you can put into practice to
[40:11] actually get to the the what we're
[40:13] looking for and um Jude said when I gave
[40:17] all diligence to write unto you in the
[40:19] common salvation it was needful there
[40:20] was a need there to write unto you and
[40:23] exhort you or to call you that you
[40:25] should ear earnestly contend that word
[40:28] contend means struggle for the faith
[40:30] that was once delivered unto the Saints
[40:33] and if we look at verse 5 there it says
[40:35] I will therefore put you in remembrance
[40:37] though ye once knew this how that the
[40:40] Lord having saved the people out of the
[40:42] land of Egypt afterwards he destroyed
[40:44] them that believed not amen so there was
[40:47] something that was forgotten along the
[40:49] way he saved them they forgot something
[40:52] and then they got destroyed in 1
[40:55] Corinthians 15:1 I'm just just going to
[40:56] read it you can write it down more over
[40:58] brother I declare unto you that uh the
[41:00] gospel which I preached unto you which
[41:02] also you have received wherein you stand
[41:05] by which you're also saved if if you
[41:09] keep in memory what I preached unto you
[41:12] unless you have believed in vain and
[41:13] this is what happened to the children of
[41:16] Israel they believed for a period but
[41:19] then they did not keep the
[41:23] faith the original faith is we're
[41:25] leading here and we're going into a
[41:28] Promised Land amen amen well most
[41:32] everybody wants to be saved
[41:35] true but the the the dividing line is of
[41:41] the requirements that God has to go into
[41:43] the promised
[41:44] land there's a relationship that's
[41:47] needed a a giving of your heart to God a
[41:50] keeping of his Commandments
[41:54] amen and
[41:57] God is looking more than just to save us
[42:00] right amen he wants a relationship amen
[42:04] that's right it's the now these the
[42:06] children of Israel that came out of
[42:08] Egypt they didn't make it right 1.8
[42:11] million Jesus said your fathers did eat
[42:14] men in the wilderness and are dead of
[42:17] course we look up that word we know that
[42:19] means eternally
[42:21] separated so God wants us to earn ly
[42:26] contend for the original faith that we
[42:28] had when we first gave our heart to
[42:31] God we were just set free we were happy
[42:34] he took our sins away we made vows
[42:36] declarations I'm going to serve God all
[42:38] the days of my life amen and then to a
[42:42] period of time the devil got in
[42:45] there and uh things began to happen that
[42:50] that all of a sudden we find oursel in a
[42:52] place we're struggling to have
[42:55] faith
[42:56] amen verse
[42:58] 17 of Jude Jude verse
[43:02] 17 but beloved remember ye The Words
[43:05] which were spoken before of the Apostle
[43:08] of our Lord Jesus Christ before the
[43:10] Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how
[43:12] that they told you that there should be
[43:15] mockers talking about the age Rel living
[43:17] and how hard it is to have faith that
[43:20] there should be mockers in the last
[43:21] times who should walk after their
[43:24] themselves after their own lust
[43:27] and they even call it ungodly lust but
[43:29] all lust is
[43:32] wrong but they're they're mockers and
[43:34] and and Peter uses the same word when he
[43:37] said that in the last days scoffers
[43:39] shall come walking after their own lust
[43:42] so that word mockers and scoffers if you
[43:44] look it up is the exact same word
[43:47] amen questioning the promise of his
[43:50] coming CU things just seem the same you
[43:53] know nothing seems to change every every
[43:56] time the word is being
[44:00] preached Believers are not recognizing
[44:03] the coming of the Lord because in their
[44:07] mind they're just thinking about the the
[44:09] the coming that the Rapture morning it's
[44:12] like the only coming that they're
[44:13] thinking of and God is here God is in
[44:16] his word and he's unveiling himself in
[44:18] his word and we don't want to scof that
[44:21] we don't want to mock that we want to
[44:23] recognize God in his word amen amen oh
[44:26] he talks about these Believers in verse
[44:29] 19 these be they who separate
[44:35] themselves that word separate means
[44:37] disjoin they disjoin them themselves
[44:39] these scoffers these
[44:41] mockers Central that means and just a a
[44:45] lower nature a natural
[44:47] believer having not the spirit operating
[44:51] in their lives but you
[44:54] beloved build building up
[44:58] yourself building up yourself now here
[45:02] is the key right here to build
[45:06] yourself
[45:08] on your Most Holy Faith amen yours you
[45:14] already got it it's already inside of
[45:16] you amen praying in the Holy Ghost amen
[45:20] keep yourself in the love of God looking
[45:24] for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ
[45:26] onto eternal life now don't try to have
[45:30] faith without the love of God Amen it
[45:33] won't do you any good in the long run
[45:36] you can have faith to remove mountains
[45:39] and not have the love of God and it's
[45:41] going to end up with nothing we want the
[45:43] love that the faith that worketh by love
[45:46] amen the the motive is I want to please
[45:50] you Lord Jesus amen let's be honest for
[45:53] just a minute before we start how many
[45:55] strugg struggles with happy Faith let me
[45:57] see your
[45:59] hands all right now let's see your hands
[46:01] who who's not being honest today we're
[46:04] in church we got to be
[46:06] honest we're living in the darkest hour
[46:08] where people don't even care enough to
[46:12] even want more
[46:14] faith we're living in the most deceptive
[46:17] age where people think they're in need
[46:19] of
[46:20] nothing they're so deceived they don't
[46:22] need we're living in Leo DEA where
[46:25] people are fighting fting more for their
[46:27] rights than they are fighting for
[46:30] Faith I'm going to fight for what's mine
[46:33] for what's yeah this is what I deserve
[46:36] and they're not even putting any
[46:37] attention to fighting for their faith
[46:40] right Jesus asked the question
[46:42] nevertheless when the son of man cometh
[46:43] shall he find faith on the earth real
[46:46] genuine faith is becoming less and less
[46:48] the truth we're seeing it less and
[46:53] less it's a struggle living by faith in
[46:56] these perilous
[46:58] times there's so many spirits attacking
[47:00] our faith on a daily basis pressures
[47:03] from every side Believers bringing
[47:05] worldly Spirits right into the church
[47:08] come on right
[47:12] true how are you going to create the
[47:14] right
[47:15] atmosphere for men shall be lovers of
[47:18] them own self coveted bolsters proud
[47:21] unthankful Unholy without affection
[47:23] truth
[47:24] Breakers
[47:30] had some sort of commitment but just
[47:32] break it false accusers incontinent
[47:36] that's no
[47:37] self-control Fierce angry
[47:41] despisers of those that are good just
[47:44] negative traitors heavy high-minded
[47:47] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[47:49] God now these are spirits that creep
[47:51] into the church because they creep into
[47:54] our life right amen
[47:56] amen what a a description of the spirits
[48:00] and what are they doing they're
[48:01] attacking our faith that's the truth
[48:03] amen they're attacking our
[48:06] faith Believers have gotten satisfied
[48:09] with a form of
[48:11] godliness they're okay not having the
[48:15] power I mean we should look at our life
[48:17] and say if we don't got power in our
[48:18] life we should be doing something about
[48:19] it amen but but Believers have gotten
[48:22] satisfied with just a form of godliness
[48:26] but Paul told Timothy turn away from
[48:28] such a spirit like that it'll take you
[48:31] [Applause]
[48:32] down I don't want to be resorted to just
[48:35] dressing in a
[48:37] form of of of
[48:40] godliness I don't want to just be acting
[48:44] like I living by faith right I don't
[48:48] want to just present myself as Godly I
[48:51] want to have the
[48:52] goods I don't want to just act like I'm
[48:54] spiritual I want to to be spiritual
[48:56] right amen amen we see that people are
[48:59] struggling to overcome there's there's
[49:01] no power in their lives to
[49:03] overcome and this is the victory that
[49:06] overcometh the world even our faith we
[49:08] need faith in our life am there is no
[49:11] other option God is not going to look at
[49:13] us and say you know what you're okay
[49:15] you're going to make it even without
[49:21] faith no power to lay down their lives
[49:25] for
[49:26] Christ no power to be
[49:29] faithful no power to press towards their
[49:31] Mark no power to love their
[49:34] enemies people are giving a new meaning
[49:38] to the word
[49:41] faithful we need a revelation you know
[49:43] what we need a revelation of this
[49:44] message we need a revelation of the word
[49:46] faithful amen
[49:48] amen we can honestly say that it's a
[49:51] real struggle trying to live by the
[49:54] faith of the son of man in this
[49:56] age so instead of struggling because our
[49:59] our faith is weak we need to be
[50:01] struggling to exercise the faith that we
[50:03] already have
[50:09] amen we need to struggle contend Jude
[50:13] said that we should earnestly contend or
[50:15] earnestly struggle for the faith that
[50:18] was once delivered now how many has
[50:21] received Faith
[50:22] amen all right we're going to go in and
[50:25] out of this
[50:25] this question because we want to provoke
[50:28] and stir up what's inside amen faith is
[50:31] a necessary substance for the believer
[50:34] amen yes sir Bible says for without it
[50:36] we can't we can't even please God Amen I
[50:40] mean think about it he that cometh to
[50:42] God must believe that he is and is a
[50:44] rewarder to them that diligently seek
[50:46] and when we approach God we need to have
[50:48] confidence when we're approaching him
[50:51] right amen because if we don't have
[50:53] confidence we're not going to get what
[50:55] we need need that's the truth amen now
[50:57] let me ask you a question how are you
[50:59] going to have confidence in approaching
[51:00] God when you haven't done what he's
[51:02] asked you to do right see then we find
[51:05] ourselves struggling why don't we have
[51:07] faith what's going on it's because we're
[51:09] not exercising what we should be
[51:12] exercising right amen now how do I
[51:15] exercise the faith I have when you know
[51:18] that you know that you know that you
[51:19] know that you know God told you
[51:22] something then be faithful to it amen
[51:25] amen yes sir amen because God is not
[51:27] obligated to give us anything else if we
[51:29] haven't done what he's already asked us
[51:30] to do and we're talking about building
[51:33] our
[51:38] faith God's goal for us is to have faith
[51:44] for all of our life amen amen not just
[51:50] for
[51:51] part his desire is that every believer
[51:56] has faith in him because without it we
[51:59] can't make him happy so I want you to
[52:01] think of your personal life God expects
[52:03] you to have faith in your personal life
[52:06] amen whatever is going on whatever the
[52:08] need is God does never put a a human
[52:11] being in a place that he stuck and
[52:14] didn't make a way of Escape our God is
[52:18] faithful amen
[52:21] amen often we remember the words that
[52:23] Jesus spoke to the people that had needs
[52:25] he says do you
[52:27] believe do you believe now these are
[52:30] people that are in desperation for God's
[52:32] help and and they come to Jesus in this
[52:35] desperation and Jesus is pausing this
[52:38] whole situation for a moment and he's
[52:41] asking for what he requires the same
[52:44] thing he requires of us amen do you
[52:47] believe many times we hear God speak
[52:49] through his Prophet when we listen to
[52:51] the tapes on the platform they come
[52:53] through and he would say Do you believe
[52:55] believe do you believe it's the
[52:58] requirement to getting anywhere with God
[53:01] is to
[53:02] believe did you know you could sit here
[53:05] in church hear the word of God being
[53:07] preached and never show your faith in
[53:09] God right that is the truth you could
[53:12] sit here hear the word of God and never
[53:14] have to show your faith but try
[53:16] approaching God in
[53:19] prayer and asking for him to meet a need
[53:23] and that if you don't have fa
[53:26] Faith so we don't want to sit here in
[53:29] church hear the word of God without
[53:31] faith to believe the word of God Amen we
[53:34] want to be activated I believe I believe
[53:37] I believe amen amen amen
[53:42] am without it we'll never get what we
[53:45] want that's true faith is the vehicle
[53:47] that gets us from point A to point B
[53:50] faith is what moves God it activates if
[53:53] I could say it like this it activates
[53:56] his end of the relationship amen you
[53:59] have a relationship with God you want
[54:02] God to do ABC and all these different
[54:05] things in your life Faith is what
[54:08] activates his end of the relationship to
[54:10] do it amen so if you don't do your part
[54:14] he won't do his part even though he
[54:17] loves
[54:18] you even though he cares if we don't
[54:21] have faith on our end we're not pleasing
[54:23] him to move on his
[54:27] end so there are many things that war
[54:29] against our faith that eat away our
[54:31] faith right we've heard of money being a
[54:35] necessary
[54:36] evil the love of money is the root of
[54:39] all
[54:41] evil yet we need money to live in this
[54:43] world
[54:45] right and I'll tell you if you're not
[54:48] living by your money you're living by
[54:50] somebody
[54:52] else's cuz you need money to Sur survive
[54:56] that's
[54:56] true without money you can't
[54:59] function yet to love it it's evil so
[55:03] we're showing that there's a a line that
[55:05] you and I are constantly have to come up
[55:08] to because you got to work to get money
[55:12] but you can't want it so much that you
[55:13] cross over amen that's right amen so to
[55:17] be motivated by a strong desire for
[55:19] money is the root of all evil all evil
[55:21] because money gets you what you
[55:24] want yet I see believers who don't seem
[55:26] to be motivated by a strong desire of
[55:30] Faith a strong desire to get Faith a
[55:33] strong desire to build Faith we'll put
[55:36] so much time into getting
[55:41] something that is
[55:42] natural true and will neglect or just
[55:46] expect to sit in
[55:48] church listen to a tape once in a while
[55:51] pray once in a while and and expect to
[55:55] get Faith to me that's laziness amen
[55:59] true it's not going to happen
[56:03] amen faith is the foundation of your
[56:06] relationship with God and we need to be
[56:09] building it because there's things that
[56:11] eat away our faith faith is necessary
[56:14] amen 1 Timothy 6:9 1 Timothy 6:9 but
[56:18] they that will be rich in other words
[56:21] who are determined to get something
[56:29] more will fall into temptation and a
[56:34] snare you know you come up to that
[56:37] line instead of just trusting God you
[56:40] you push yes and into many foolish and
[56:45] hurtful lust which drown men into
[56:49] destruction and predition amen for the
[56:52] love of money is the root of all evil
[56:53] which while some coveted after they go
[56:57] after it what happens they have aired
[57:00] from the
[57:03] faith they've aired from it they've
[57:05] gotten away from it and they've even
[57:07] pierced themselves with many
[57:11] Sorrows who in the world would want to
[57:14] take something
[57:20] and but they don't think about it see we
[57:23] don't think about that when the devil
[57:24] says oh you could have that you could
[57:26] have
[57:28] that money and faith can actually work
[57:31] against one
[57:34] another if you desire money too much the
[57:37] scripture tells you that you will Air
[57:39] from the faith amen the truth you'll end
[57:42] up piercing yourself with many Sorrows
[57:45] now another things that war against the
[57:47] flesh worldliness will eat away at your
[57:52] faith TV
[57:55] amen phones amen gossip amen focusing on
[58:01] constantly pleasing yourself getting
[58:04] what you
[58:05] want that's worldliness it will war
[58:08] against your
[58:10] faith carnality will eat away at your
[58:14] faith what do you mean
[58:16] carnality I mean just yielding to issues
[58:20] that you have in your life that you
[58:22] don't deal with anger issues thinking
[58:25] you're better than someone else isms and
[58:28] schisms having respect to persons wrong
[58:31] attitudes entitlement issues I deserve
[58:35] this will eat away at your
[58:39] faith a lack of feeding your faith is
[58:43] just a default that will eat away at
[58:45] your faith not reading the word with an
[58:47] open an honest heart like God show me
[58:51] what you want me to
[58:53] do
[58:55] not just having having someone to just
[58:58] beat it over your head because you're
[59:00] not Desiring it
[59:02] yourself not preparing our hearts with
[59:05] sincerity right you know I'm me to
[59:08] church that's better than I've been
[59:12] doing not preparing our hearts with
[59:16] sincerity not praying through until we
[59:19] get in touch or contact with the Holy
[59:22] Ghost amen God is a Spirit they that
[59:25] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[59:27] and truth so these things just by
[59:29] default start to eat away your faith and
[59:32] it just becomes a form of
[59:35] godliness how can we live by faith if we
[59:37] don't build our faith the scripture says
[59:40] that Paul was living by the faith of the
[59:43] son of
[59:44] man he lived by
[59:47] it now we we've all
[59:51] testified that I struggle having faith
[59:55] okay I'm okay with that I really am I'm
[59:58] not okay with not building am I'm not
[1:00:01] okay with not doing something to help
[1:00:04] ourselves build because we got to get to
[1:00:06] the place that we could live by the
[1:00:08] faith of the son of man live our lives
[1:00:10] our problems in our home on our jobs in
[1:00:13] our church and live by faith because
[1:00:15] that's what it's for
[1:00:19] amen the just shall live by faith we
[1:00:23] don't want Faith just when we need
[1:00:27] it right you know what I'm what I'm
[1:00:29] saying from disaster to disaster from
[1:00:32] turmoil to turmoil right we just got to
[1:00:35] live by faith
[1:00:38] amen be desperate for God all the time
[1:00:41] amen desire to please him all the time
[1:00:46] amen every day learning to live by faith
[1:00:48] may seem unattainable I want to say this
[1:00:52] it's easier than we think amen amen it
[1:00:55] is easier than we think and we're going
[1:00:58] to go through some practical
[1:01:01] things
[1:01:02] it's it's really just one thing that can
[1:01:05] be applied to so many areas of your
[1:01:08] life but there is Faith already in our
[1:01:13] heart we know
[1:01:15] that faith comes from God he's given all
[1:01:18] of us a
[1:01:19] measure now we can't manufacture faith
[1:01:22] is that right amen
[1:01:26] so when God ask do you believe he's not
[1:01:29] asking you to manufacture something you
[1:01:30] don't
[1:01:33] have he's asking you to believe what you
[1:01:37] already have inside of you to activate
[1:01:41] the faith that's already inside of you
[1:01:43] see Faith we're taught by Jesus that
[1:01:45] it's a real small it's very small and he
[1:01:48] typed it with the smallest of hers but
[1:01:50] yet it grows so big that the birds come
[1:01:52] in and they land there and they Lodge
[1:01:54] there so our faith no matter how small
[1:01:57] it may seem in our lives it can grow if
[1:02:00] we activate it if we start to put into
[1:02:03] practice what we need amen you can't sit
[1:02:07] here in church and just expect to see
[1:02:09] something see something that's going to
[1:02:12] activate you and feel like you want to
[1:02:14] believe more it don't work like
[1:02:17] that it didn't work like that for the
[1:02:19] children of Israel right they saw tons
[1:02:22] of Miracles more than I ever seen
[1:02:25] right it didn't get him through right
[1:02:32] amen if thou can't believe not if thou
[1:02:36] can't see get away from seeing seeing is
[1:02:39] in your heart Thomas is the one that you
[1:02:43] know I we can relate to Thomas I got to
[1:02:46] see it if I see it I'll have more faith
[1:02:48] with God's doing in the church come on
[1:02:50] what is wrong with
[1:02:52] you we should be further along than that
[1:02:56] no wonder we don't have faith in our own
[1:02:58] homes and our own
[1:03:03] lives too often we're looking for God to
[1:03:06] do something that's already inside of us
[1:03:11] wow it's already inside of
[1:03:13] us we've listened to the devil too much
[1:03:15] telling us that you don't have faith you
[1:03:17] don't have
[1:03:20] faith we've let too many things eat away
[1:03:23] at the strength of our
[1:03:26] faith how many here can say that God has
[1:03:31] spoken to me at one time or
[1:03:34] another amen come on okay who now how
[1:03:37] come the rest of you don't want to
[1:03:39] participate in this
[1:03:43] class how many can say now that God has
[1:03:47] spoken to you on multiple occasions let
[1:03:51] me see your hands okay now how many can
[1:03:55] say God speaks to your heart quite
[1:03:58] often think about this
[1:04:02] now when we hear God speak to
[1:04:06] us it produces a faith
[1:04:11] amen the Bible says so Faith cometh by
[1:04:14] hearing and hearing by the word of God
[1:04:17] not you reading the Bible or somebody
[1:04:20] reading the Bible to you but when God
[1:04:23] speaks it person to you that gives
[1:04:29] faith our own testimony is that we have
[1:04:33] faith but what happens is we're not
[1:04:37] activating it we're not exercising it
[1:04:40] we're not contending for it we're not
[1:04:42] using it to build the full potential in
[1:04:45] our lives we're really
[1:04:49] not taking Faith that's already inside
[1:04:52] of us and applying it
[1:04:54] every day in every
[1:04:56] issue we're not building off of it we're
[1:04:59] not building ourselves in the Most Holy
[1:05:02] Faith the building part the exercising
[1:05:04] the contending the using
[1:05:07] it we're lazy true we want to sit here
[1:05:12] and we want God to do some miracle in
[1:05:15] front of us that's going to make us
[1:05:16] shout and scream and and make us say oh
[1:05:19] yeah I believe God's here in the
[1:05:21] church or we want God to do something
[1:05:24] reckless in our home for us to say oh
[1:05:25] yeah God's in my
[1:05:28] home we're lazy
[1:05:33] amen faith is meant to be used in our
[1:05:36] lives on a regular
[1:05:39] basis not just when we get horrible
[1:05:42] situations hey we got to really pray for
[1:05:47] this I think we forget how important
[1:05:49] Faith really is amen God wants to see
[1:05:52] Faith used in their lives he wants want
[1:05:54] to see an operation to put to good use
[1:05:57] not left doormat right not left in the
[1:06:04] past God doesn't want to be identified
[1:06:06] as a god of the past he wants to be
[1:06:09] identified as a as the I am I am a
[1:06:12] present help in a time of trouble I am
[1:06:15] the way I am the truth I am the door I
[1:06:19] am I am the same yesterday today and
[1:06:22] forever so in order for that happen
[1:06:24] we've got to activate faith on a regular
[1:06:27] basis in our life well how do I do that
[1:06:28] doesn't seem I can I can ever attain
[1:06:30] anything well there are things in your
[1:06:33] life that you can be doing if you were
[1:06:35] just faithful to
[1:06:41] them why are we being faithful to those
[1:06:49] things now know there's not a person in
[1:06:51] this
[1:06:53] room but what is able to start living
[1:06:56] more by
[1:07:00] faith amen how many been born
[1:07:03] [Music]
[1:07:05] again every hand should go up then you
[1:07:08] have the ability to believe yes you have
[1:07:12] the ability to have faith you have the
[1:07:14] ability to exercise Faith muscles amen
[1:07:17] one time Jesus asked the question he
[1:07:19] says do you now
[1:07:22] believe do you now now believe there was
[1:07:25] a time in our life that we didn't
[1:07:27] believe why we were born with an
[1:07:30] unbelieving nature we were born in the
[1:07:33] Sin of
[1:07:36] unbelief Jesus said for if you believe
[1:07:39] not that I am he you shall die in your
[1:07:43] unbelief in your
[1:07:45] sin doubt is sin amen amen and we need
[1:07:49] to be born again to believe all the word
[1:07:55] amen now God had to do something to get
[1:07:58] our attention
[1:08:00] right he sent a prophet we got a hold of
[1:08:03] a book
[1:08:05] amen and we seen that we were attracted
[1:08:08] to this
[1:08:10] Prophet God sent
[1:08:13] them with
[1:08:15] gifts got our attention seen something
[1:08:18] that we never seen before and what did
[1:08:20] that Prophet
[1:08:22] do that prophet led us to the
[1:08:25] supernatural word amen he led us to the
[1:08:29] supernatural word and you know what most
[1:08:32] people did they got
[1:08:37] off the majority of them got
[1:08:42] off because people are
[1:08:46] attracted to gifts and not the
[1:08:51] word Jesus told of a certain rich man
[1:08:53] man who had died went to hell and was
[1:08:55] tormented there in the
[1:08:57] flames and he wanted Lazarus to give him
[1:08:59] a few drops of of water on his tongue
[1:09:01] you know the
[1:09:02] story but he couldn't because there was
[1:09:04] a great golf fixed between the two and
[1:09:08] so after he realized that he couldn't
[1:09:10] get any relief all a sudden he got a
[1:09:12] burden for his his brothers that were
[1:09:15] still uh a
[1:09:18] living and who still had a a chance to
[1:09:21] bypass hell and let's pick it up here
[1:09:23] Luke 16: 27 and then he said I pray thee
[1:09:28] therefore father that thou wouldest send
[1:09:30] him to my father's house for I have five
[1:09:34] brothers that they may testify that he
[1:09:37] that Lazarus would testify unto them
[1:09:40] lest they also come into this place of
[1:09:44] torment and Abraham saith unto him they
[1:09:48] have Moses and the prophets let them
[1:09:51] hear them in other words it should get
[1:09:54] the job done for salvation when you hear
[1:09:56] the word amen
[1:09:59] amen and look at this and he said no
[1:10:03] Abraham you're
[1:10:06] wrong but if one went unto them from the
[1:10:10] dead they will repent in other words
[1:10:14] they said if if they can see with their
[1:10:17] eyes the observation it will change them
[1:10:21] no I'm telling you that is is just the
[1:10:24] bait on the hook right amen it's not
[1:10:29] enough to change your nature you
[1:10:33] actually have to beli amen God requires
[1:10:37] belief and he said unto them if they
[1:10:39] hear not Moses and the prophets neither
[1:10:42] will they be persuaded the one rose from
[1:10:47] the dead I've talked to people who have
[1:10:49] seen Miracles like
[1:10:52] this and believed for a portion but then
[1:10:55] fell away it does attract your attention
[1:10:59] there's no doubt about it people make
[1:11:01] some great things oh yeah I seen this
[1:11:04] but they fall away because faith is
[1:11:07] something meant to be built amen God
[1:11:11] didn't give you Faith to leave it a
[1:11:12] small mustard grain seed right he he
[1:11:16] expects it to
[1:11:18] grow our genuine faith has nothing to do
[1:11:22] with what we observe from our eyes
[1:11:25] we would think the a Believer we would
[1:11:28] think we would believe more if we saw
[1:11:30] more but it's not the
[1:11:33] case it's all about
[1:11:36] faith we're not going to be more
[1:11:38] spiritual if we see more miracles in our
[1:11:40] church
[1:11:43] right we're going to be more spiritual
[1:11:46] if we start believing what God has told
[1:11:48] us to
[1:11:49] do if we believe what would Jesus say I
[1:11:53] come here to do do my father's work what
[1:11:54] are the works of God that you believe on
[1:11:56] him who
[1:11:58] sent me we've got to believe the word
[1:12:02] that he has spoken to us I don't care if
[1:12:04] he's told you you need you need to do
[1:12:07] this one thing then you need to do that
[1:12:11] if he told you you need to pray faithful
[1:12:13] you need to start praying faithful if he
[1:12:15] told you to come to church faithful you
[1:12:17] need to start activating and coming to
[1:12:19] church Faithfully you think it don't
[1:12:20] have anything to do with the faith that
[1:12:22] you want for God to move this mountain
[1:12:24] out of your life but it does God is
[1:12:26] looking to see if you're going to be
[1:12:27] faithful with what he told you to do
[1:12:30] you've got to build that Faith you don't
[1:12:32] build that Faith by looking at some
[1:12:34] Mountain you look at the mountain you
[1:12:36] say oh my how am I going to get through
[1:12:38] that
[1:12:40] thing but when he says I want you just
[1:12:43] to start spending more time with me in
[1:12:46] in prayer well you can do that amen You'
[1:12:50] got faith to do that and it's being
[1:12:54] faithful to the things that you can do
[1:12:56] literally build your faith for the
[1:12:58] things you can't do that's how you build
[1:13:01] your faith that is practical that is
[1:13:03] something that's put in your hands that
[1:13:05] you can do
[1:13:10] amen we want something Supernatural to
[1:13:13] happen out here that that that we
[1:13:15] observe that we see that we think that
[1:13:17] we that we
[1:13:18] feel and God's given us his word amen
[1:13:23] when he speaks to you he gives you his
[1:13:25] word and he expects you to walk in it
[1:13:27] and if you're too lazy to walk in that
[1:13:29] don't expect God to meet every need in
[1:13:31] your life now I know you don't want to
[1:13:34] hear that but it's the
[1:13:36] truth we want to see God move in our
[1:13:39] lives we want to see God move in our
[1:13:40] church well we got to start being
[1:13:42] spiritual Believers and working with the
[1:13:45] work that he has told us to do
[1:13:52] amen m Miracles are only the bait that
[1:13:54] grab our
[1:13:56] attention did you know you all went
[1:13:58] fishing you know there's some fish out
[1:14:00] there they know how to get the bait off
[1:14:03] the hook and not get
[1:14:06] caught right you're reeled in and you
[1:14:09] say that little guy got my
[1:14:13] bait and there are believers who know
[1:14:16] how to just hang around right amen enjoy
[1:14:21] all the outside
[1:14:24] and not get
[1:14:27] hooked do you know the majority of the
[1:14:29] Believers followed Jesus for the Loaves
[1:14:32] and the fishes that's the truth right
[1:14:34] the majority of
[1:14:35] them selfish reasons in other
[1:14:41] words brother Braham said eventually
[1:14:44] they will fall away amen the word is
[1:14:48] what holds a person that's right the
[1:14:51] word not your word not the word of John
[1:14:54] Martin or some preacher it's the word of
[1:14:56] God that's what holds the believer
[1:14:59] Faith's final resting place is in the
[1:15:01] word now when he speaks to you that's
[1:15:03] the word
[1:15:08] amen it ain't no
[1:15:10] different he's
[1:15:11] alive you know the prophet taught us we
[1:15:14] just got to make sure that what he
[1:15:15] speaks to us lines up with what he's
[1:15:17] already spoken amen amen too often
[1:15:20] people just say well God spoke to me
[1:15:24] you know God told me this God told me
[1:15:26] that I'm this is going to happen and
[1:15:27] that's going to
[1:15:28] happen well my Bible tells me that I'm
[1:15:31] evil if I'm going to say this is what
[1:15:34] I'm going to do and that's where I'm
[1:15:35] going to go and this is what's going to
[1:15:37] happen Bible calls me evil amen he said
[1:15:40] I should the Lord willing this is going
[1:15:42] to happen this is going to that's going
[1:15:44] to
[1:15:46] happen so we've got to have our
[1:15:50] exercising line up with the word amen
[1:15:56] let's get hooked on the word
[1:15:59] amen I know it's boring doing the little
[1:16:01] things he asked you to
[1:16:04] do but the brand said the Christian
[1:16:06] reads his Bible and prays every day amen
[1:16:09] I know it's hard to get in the prayer
[1:16:10] closet and really pray
[1:16:12] through just seems like well there's so
[1:16:14] many distractions things are in my mind
[1:16:16] and problems of the day you know what
[1:16:18] start dealing with what you can do in
[1:16:21] your life amen
[1:16:24] because we're not going to bypass we're
[1:16:26] not going to bypass
[1:16:30] God God is brings us right down to the
[1:16:33] basics amen Jesus said everyone that is
[1:16:37] of Truth heareth my voice my sheep hear
[1:16:40] my voice and what do they do they follow
[1:16:42] the
[1:16:43] word they don't just say well yeah I
[1:16:45] believe it don't follow it right come on
[1:16:49] they just don't say Amen don't follow it
[1:16:52] that's a form of
[1:16:54] godliness you got to follow the word
[1:16:57] genuine belief must be on the word we
[1:17:00] must follow that
[1:17:02] word one reason we struggle with faith
[1:17:06] is that we're looking for big things to
[1:17:09] happen right if that big thing happens
[1:17:13] that'll energize my
[1:17:19] faith and I do believe that there's
[1:17:21] nothing too hard for God but but we need
[1:17:23] to believe for not just the big things
[1:17:25] but the little
[1:17:28] things it's easy to see discouragement
[1:17:31] take
[1:17:32] place on people's hearts when things
[1:17:36] aren't going right in their
[1:17:39] lives but Jesus makes this statement he
[1:17:41] that is faithful in little is going to
[1:17:43] be faithful in much amen so faithfulness
[1:17:46] here is being described as a
[1:17:49] character I want you to think about this
[1:17:52] faithfulness is the
[1:17:54] character is is a character that's
[1:17:57] molded by your
[1:18:01] choice faithfulness is not a gift you're
[1:18:04] not born with it well look at that
[1:18:06] person he's faithful oh God must have
[1:18:07] made him special I'm sorry that didn't
[1:18:09] happen well look at that person he's so
[1:18:12] lazy he couldn't do anything well God
[1:18:13] didn't make him that
[1:18:16] way you have a choice Amen to follow
[1:18:19] God's God's
[1:18:21] will or your
[1:18:27] own faithfulness is is a character
[1:18:31] molded by The Power of Choice it's you
[1:18:35] learning to make the tough decisions
[1:18:38] right that you know I I need to I you
[1:18:41] know prayer is more important than
[1:18:43] necessary sleep amen that's a it's a
[1:18:46] choice
[1:18:51] amen how much time have you been
[1:18:54] spending in the word saying God the
[1:18:56] reason I'm reading this word is because
[1:18:59] I need you to show me how to live better
[1:19:01] for
[1:19:03] you wow I want to know the last time you
[1:19:06] picked up the Bible with
[1:19:08] that you know we pick up the Bible
[1:19:10] looking for answers that God would
[1:19:12] direct me with this one situation well
[1:19:14] that's fine but God wants a
[1:19:17] relationship we need to be
[1:19:20] interested in following him amen am yes
[1:19:24] sir amen because that's all that's going
[1:19:25] to matter trth you got to choose to be
[1:19:29] faithful with the little things in your
[1:19:32] life we can do that there's not a person
[1:19:34] in here I don't care your age I don't
[1:19:36] care how young or How old if you get
[1:19:39] back because see the Bible says because
[1:19:41] iniquity abound the love of many would
[1:19:43] wax cold in the last days well the
[1:19:46] prophet taught us what iniquity was it's
[1:19:48] not doing the right things that you know
[1:19:50] you should be doing amen
[1:19:53] oh I don't need to do
[1:19:54] that it's not a big deal you know as
[1:19:58] long as I just make it to church that's
[1:20:00] all that
[1:20:02] matters that's iniquity that's coming to
[1:20:06] church with iniquity in the Bible
[1:20:08] identified Lucifer as one that filled
[1:20:12] the sanctuaries with
[1:20:14] iniquity convinced the people in the
[1:20:17] churches that they didn't have to follow
[1:20:19] the word and still go to church right
[1:20:23] well brother John this seems to be some
[1:20:25] pretty pretty strong preaching
[1:20:30] okay well look the devil preaches to us
[1:20:32] all day true all the
[1:20:37] time every time you choose to remain
[1:20:39] faithful to one of God's words you are
[1:20:43] manifesting a faith wow you may not
[1:20:46] think it is you may you know think it's
[1:20:49] a do a don't uh uh a have to a rule a
[1:20:53] regulation that it doesn't mean anything
[1:20:55] and it's not helping you with the
[1:20:56] overall picture that you're looking
[1:20:59] at but you're when you manifest Faith
[1:21:03] you're building
[1:21:05] faith and it's those little building
[1:21:08] blocks if you notice in that statue of a
[1:21:10] perfect man which we don't have in here
[1:21:13] but you've seen it out there faith is at
[1:21:16] the
[1:21:17] bottom and everything is built off of
[1:21:20] that so if Satan can deter at our faith
[1:21:23] we don't have much of a Christian
[1:21:25] walk amen so stop looking for the big
[1:21:29] things to happen in your life to say you
[1:21:31] believe right amen call the devil out
[1:21:33] and say I'm a believer I'm faithful to
[1:21:35] what he's given me to
[1:21:37] do you know Jesus said Can anyone
[1:21:40] condemn me of
[1:21:42] unbelief he did right who can condemn me
[1:21:45] of sin he believed the word
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:56] H if you want to see God big time in
[1:21:59] your life learn to be faithful with the
[1:22:01] little things he's asked you to do
[1:22:04] activate faith in the things that you
[1:22:05] can do yes sir you may not better to
[1:22:07] raise the dead but you can raise your
[1:22:09] hands and praise the Lord amen you may
[1:22:12] not be able to speak to thousands of
[1:22:14] people but you can go speak to one
[1:22:16] person about
[1:22:18] Christen you may not be able to read the
[1:22:20] Bible to thousands of Believers but you
[1:22:22] can read it more to your family amen

[1:22:27] doing that activate
[1:22:30] faith and you know what happens when you
[1:22:32] begin to be more faithful with the
[1:22:33] things that you can do your faith

[1:22:47] sorry the children of Israel I know some
[1:22:50] of you are wrestling with this thing and
[1:22:52] I don't know why the children of Israel
[1:22:56] when they came up to the promised
[1:23:00] land Joshua didn't perform a bunch of
[1:23:03] miracles in front of
[1:23:05] them it's true to try to get them to
[1:23:09] believe or I should say Moses at that
[1:23:13] time he
[1:23:15] didn't they seen enough Miracles they
[1:23:17] seen what every time you're reading
[1:23:19] about this incident Old Testament or new
[1:23:21] testament God is saying I they proved my
[1:23:25] works these many years and these 10
[1:23:27] times and they proved me they proved me
[1:23:30] I was faithful to them I showed them I
[1:23:32] had power to to give them food to give
[1:23:35] them water to to heal their sick bodies
[1:23:37] I prove to them that I am God am now
[1:23:41] believe me to take the land and they
[1:23:44] wouldn't do
[1:23:46] it they perished in their
[1:23:49] unbelief look God we've got to believe
[1:23:53] for the rest of our journey amen we've
[1:23:56] already been attracted we've he's
[1:23:58] already got our attention we already
[1:24:00] believe the message we already know
[1:24:02] where we stand now start walking forward
[1:24:05] tell the children of Israel to go
[1:24:07] forward amen believe be faithful with
[1:24:12] what you can do you don't think it's
[1:24:13] important to be faithful to church but
[1:24:15] it is am yes
[1:24:19] sir you don't think it's Faith it's
[1:24:21] important to to pray continuously
[1:24:24] without ceasing to make sure you're
[1:24:26] praying in the spirit but it is
[1:24:28] important to God how do you expect God
[1:24:31] to give you what you want when you won't
[1:24:32] give him what you can
[1:24:36] wow God don't want to be used come on
[1:24:39] I'm going to have a relationship with
[1:24:41] you with Brother

[1:25:01] problems going on in my
[1:25:03] life oh I'm going to tell you just
[1:25:05] naturally you or Mark isn't going to
[1:25:07] want to have a relationship with me how
[1:25:09] do we expect God who we know loves his
[1:25:13] enemies right perfect in nature but say
[1:25:17] yeah I want to be married to somebody
[1:25:18] like
[1:25:19] that he doesn't right right he did he he
[1:25:24] did he didn't he didn't
[1:25:26] marry 1.8 million people that came out
[1:25:29] of Egypt right even though he loved them
[1:25:33] even though he said they're my people
[1:25:35] even though he he blessed them for 40
[1:25:38] years your shoes didn't wear out and so
[1:25:39] many great things happen right look God
[1:25:42] has the final say so he requires you to
[1:25:44] believe all the word we got to start
[1:25:46] activating the faith that we know start
[1:25:48] being faithful to the things that we can
[1:25:51] do amen so we can believe for the things
[1:25:54] that seem to be mountains in our
[1:25:56] life God is looking for character
[1:26:00] amen so only that we're taking with
[1:26:04] us God is looking for us to have faith
[1:26:07] in the little things that we often
[1:26:10] Overlook things like that that seem that
[1:26:13] are not necessary as I've spoken before
[1:26:15] Small Things unseen things by others the
[1:26:19] things that seems that sometimes we just
[1:26:22] we don't even want to do things like
[1:26:26] prayer when the scripture says that men
[1:26:28] always ought to pray and Fain you ever
[1:26:30] wonder why you're weak try thinking big
[1:26:35] probably a big reason is you haven't
[1:26:36] been
[1:26:37] praying right that's true build yourself
[1:26:40] up in the Most Holy Faith praying in the
[1:26:42] Holy Ghost prayer is usually the very
[1:26:46] cause of
[1:26:47] it things like esteeming others better
[1:26:50] than yourself amen
[1:26:52] things like loving others and living for
[1:26:55] others
[1:26:56] amen things like self-denial yes these
[1:27:00] are things that you can do things like
[1:27:03] having our hearts more prepared before
[1:27:04] we come into the sanctuary it's a little
[1:27:07] sacrifice don't you think Amen brother
[1:27:09] Mark are you agreeing with me on that
[1:27:11] amen yes sir amen things like being
[1:27:14] faithful to church order amen you've
[1:27:16] been taught things like paying your
[1:27:17] tithes amen things like searching the
[1:27:21] scriptures to know
[1:27:22] how to please God better
[1:27:26] amen things like a good attitude amen
[1:27:30] that's a it's a you know that is such a
[1:27:31] small
[1:27:33] thing a good attitude a right attitude
[1:27:36] it's a small thing that makes a big
[1:27:37] difference it makes such a big
[1:27:38] difference that brother B makes a
[1:27:40] statement that the right mental attitude
[1:27:42] towards any Divine promise of God will
[1:27:44] bring it to pass that yet we put such
[1:27:46] little emphasis on it it doesn't matter
[1:27:48] what attitude I have toward
[1:27:50] you well you know the attit atude you
[1:27:52] have towards me don't you rem don't ever
[1:27:54] forget this it's the same attitude you
[1:27:56] have towards God Amen that's right
[1:27:59] that's the
[1:28:00] truth your thoughts speak louder in
[1:28:03] heaven than your words do down
[1:28:06] here look these are small things that
[1:28:09] make a big difference to your faith amen
[1:28:12] Satan has got the so many
[1:28:15] people to deteriorate their own faith
[1:28:18] inside of
[1:28:20] them but they can't get away from the
[1:28:23] message they know the message is
[1:28:25] right but I I I think this message needs
[1:28:27] to be vibrant in our
[1:28:30] life I I think we should just be happy
[1:28:33] living for one another amen amen happy
[1:28:36] loving one another encouraging one
[1:28:41] another looking for the coming of our
[1:28:44] Lord Jesus
[1:28:47] Christ beloved when I gave all diligence
[1:28:50] to write unto you of the Comm salvation
[1:28:52] it was needful for me to write unto you
[1:28:55] and to exhort you that you should
[1:28:57] earnestly
[1:28:58] contend for the faith that was once
[1:29:00] delivered and says I want to ask this
[1:29:02] question do you
[1:29:05] think do you think that 1.8 million that
[1:29:08] came out of Egypt do you think they
[1:29:11] thought they were going to hell
[1:29:14] no no so we can't go
[1:29:18] by well I know I'm going to have that's
[1:29:23] right and I'm not trying to challenge
[1:29:26] your salvation what I am trying to
[1:29:29] do is get you to act like Joshua and
[1:29:34] Caleb believe for the rest of the
[1:29:36] promise
[1:29:37] [Music]
[1:29:39] amen the rest of the promise you
[1:29:44] know this thing about the promised land
[1:29:47] being the Holy
[1:29:50] Ghost the promised land is the Holy
[1:29:54] Ghost but I want to I want to go a step
[1:29:57] further it's entering into the holiest
[1:30:00] of
[1:30:02] holies it's where God is in you because
[1:30:07] that the holy ghost coming in you and
[1:30:09] you're into the holiest of holies where
[1:30:13] God has total possession of your life
[1:30:17] you're living by the faith of the son of
[1:30:18] man now you're not living by your faith
[1:30:20] anymore
[1:30:23] that's what we should be striving to get
[1:30:26] to faith gets us into the promised land
[1:30:33] amen the children of Israel were
[1:30:36] scared they were filled with
[1:30:39] fear do you know what that fear did it
[1:30:41] led them to murmur complain be bothered
[1:30:46] be slothful be lazy uh I should have
[1:30:49] just you know we should have just stayed
[1:30:51] back in the world
[1:30:53] that was all because they feared now
[1:30:57] what Joshua and Caleb they didn't
[1:31:01] fear they believed in God for a person
[1:31:05] to
[1:31:08] say we're more than able to take this
[1:31:11] land when naturally it couldn't be done
[1:31:14] naturally it couldn't be done just
[1:31:16] grasshoppers they had to look to the God
[1:31:20] who was able to make it happen right
[1:31:22] amen yes sir
[1:31:23] amen just like job had to look to to the
[1:31:29] God who he was in love with though he
[1:31:31] slay me yet why trust him no fear no
[1:31:34] fear right perfect love casteth out all
[1:31:37] fear now the perfect love is your
[1:31:39] relationship with
[1:31:47] God I don't care how small the an
[1:31:50] insignificant this may seem this message
[1:31:54] this is a building block to grow your
[1:31:56] faith
[1:31:58] amen I want you to look at your life I
[1:32:00] want you to think about the things God
[1:32:03] has asked you to do that you thought was
[1:32:04] not that big a deal it may be just as
[1:32:07] simple
[1:32:10] as where your heart is at when you're at
[1:32:12] in the
[1:32:17] sanctuary be faithful and God will do
[1:32:20] the rest am
[1:32:22] amen exercise your
[1:32:26] faith exercise your
[1:32:30] faith be faithful to small
[1:32:33] things if we're not faithful to those
[1:32:36] small things we're showing God that
[1:32:39] we're not exercising we're
[1:32:41] lazy you know we're you know how how's
[1:32:44] the Bible say there in Galatians H have
[1:32:46] you started out in the you started out
[1:32:50] by believing
[1:32:52] how you now made perfect without
[1:32:55] Believing by
[1:32:57] works we got to keep exercising Faith
[1:33:00] you know it you know you you may just
[1:33:02] feel bad and down and had a bad day and
[1:33:04] after church you need to go up to some
[1:33:06] and say praise the Lord God bless you my
[1:33:09] brother I love you exercise your faith
[1:33:17] amen there's so many things you can do
[1:33:20] to exercise your faith
[1:33:22] that are in your power don't be
[1:33:26] lazy start doing them
[1:33:31] amen you know you've heard the story how
[1:33:34] many times have you done something for
[1:33:36] somebody and it made you feel that you
[1:33:38] feel good that you did it for them just
[1:33:40] the fact that you did something for
[1:33:42] somebody and it made you feel
[1:33:46] good well when you do something for
[1:33:50] somebody it's actually the will of
[1:33:55] God you're living for others well God's
[1:33:59] going to build your faith with
[1:34:01] that it might be only be you can't live
[1:34:03] off of that
[1:34:04] no but it is something it's just an
[1:34:07] example to show you did anybody pray for
[1:34:12] uh 45 minutes and just worship God in
[1:34:17] your prayer and got done after 45
[1:34:20] minutes and said you know that was a
[1:34:21] waste a time
[1:34:24] never no you don't but if you pray about
[1:34:28] 8
[1:34:30] minutes and you don't
[1:34:32] worship you don't get into his
[1:34:36] presence you may get up and say well I'm
[1:34:39] glad that's over with I'm going on with
[1:34:40] the
[1:34:44] day
[1:34:47] see but if you do if you lay neighbor
[1:34:51] for 45 minutes and you still don't get
[1:34:54] your
[1:34:55] answer you feel better because you know
[1:34:57] you did the will of
[1:35:02] God and these little things that we
[1:35:04] think are not important they're
[1:35:06] important to
[1:35:07] God they're really important to God I'd
[1:35:10] like to see us
[1:35:14] Prosper oh this is so far off my notes
[1:35:18] but let's go to Psalms 1 yes Psalms
[1:35:27] 1 I mean faith will get us to Prosperity
[1:35:32] now I don't mean natural Prosperity
[1:35:34] right blessed is the man that walketh
[1:35:37] not in the
[1:35:39] councel of the wrong
[1:35:44] way nor standeth in the same place that
[1:35:50] Sinners stand
[1:35:52] in nor sth in the seat of just being
[1:35:59] negative
[1:36:00] right man I don't want to sit in that
[1:36:04] seat but his Delight is in the law of
[1:36:08] the
[1:36:09] Lord this word is where his Delight is
[1:36:13] at and in this word doth he meditate day
[1:36:19] and
[1:36:20] night and he shall be like a tree
[1:36:24] Hallelujah planted by the rivers of
[1:36:27] water that bringeth forth his fruit in
[1:36:30] his season and his Leaf also shall not
[1:36:33] wither and whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:36:38] prosper now I didn't know this
[1:36:42] but uh George Washington this was his
[1:36:45] favorite
[1:36:48] Psalms and he had it at his eration and
[1:36:52] just in a many different of his
[1:36:54] ceremonies he had this Psalms read and
[1:36:57] they asked him and says well why do you
[1:36:58] like this Psalm so much and he said
[1:37:00] because of the
[1:37:02] promise the
[1:37:05] promise the promise if you're faithful
[1:37:09] in little you'll be faithful in much
[1:37:14] amen if you have faith to believe in the
[1:37:18] things that you can do I will give you
[1:37:21] faith faith for the things that you
[1:37:23] can't do right
[1:37:24] now and you know it's going to be that
[1:37:27] same Faith just built
[1:37:29] bigger see the faith is already inside
[1:37:33] of you amen amen but if we don't tap
[1:37:36] into that building of the faith build up
[1:37:40] yourself in the Most Holy Faith let's
[1:37:43] Stand Together God bless
[1:37:48] you so instead of struggling to have
[1:37:50] faith let's struggle to build our faith

[1:37:56] faithful press in to be more faithful
[1:38:00] take heed to the things that God has
[1:38:01] spoken to you don't let them
[1:38:04] slip don't just pray more practice to
[1:38:07] pray in the Holy Ghost yes sir amen

[1:40:20] that real quietly if I could get
[1:40:22] everyone to just bow your your heads and
[1:40:25] close your eyes just for a
[1:40:32] moment I'm sure we all have unanswered
[1:40:36] prayers and
[1:40:39] needs that we would like to see God
[1:40:45] meet but my question to each of us today
[1:40:49] this question goes to to me as
[1:40:53] well are there things in your life that
[1:40:58] God has asked you to do but you have let
[1:41:01] them slip to the
[1:41:04] side and haven't been putting much
[1:41:07] emphasis on
[1:41:10] things and God
[1:41:13] has reminded you of that today the
[1:41:16] importance of taking care of those
[1:41:19] things
[1:41:22] you want strength to do the small things
[1:41:26] in your life lift up your hands and I'm
[1:41:28] I'm going to unite in prayer with you
[1:41:31] God bless all these hands amen just
[1:41:34] almost anonimous in this room amen
[1:41:37] hallelujah let's believe now as we
[1:41:39] approach him in prayer with faith
[1:41:44] Heavenly
[1:41:45] Father we thank you for calling us to be
[1:41:50] like you are
[1:41:53] faithful when you
[1:41:55] addressed all those that you had given
[1:41:58] gifts to in that
[1:42:00] Parable the ones that exercised what
[1:42:03] they had to make more you said Well Done
[1:42:07] thou good and faithful servant Lord we
[1:42:10] know your bride will be
[1:42:13] faithful and Lord you're calling us as
[1:42:16] your bride to be more faithful with the
[1:42:20] things that you've given us to do and
[1:42:23] Lord as we stand here as a group Lord as
[1:42:27] a body of Believers we ask that you
[1:42:29] would forgive us for not being faithful
[1:42:34] more faithful to the things that we
[1:42:36] could have been taking care of all along
[1:42:38] forgive us for getting discouraged
[1:42:41] because of our our situations
[1:42:44] Lord forgive us for letting the wrong
[1:42:47] things into our life and and eating away
[1:42:50] at our
[1:42:52] Faith forgive us Lord for expecting
[1:42:56] other people and other things to
[1:42:59] increase our
[1:43:01] faith when Lord you've already given us
[1:43:05] that Faith you've already given us that
[1:43:07] seat of Faith inside of us and now Lord
[1:43:10] I pray for your people that when they
