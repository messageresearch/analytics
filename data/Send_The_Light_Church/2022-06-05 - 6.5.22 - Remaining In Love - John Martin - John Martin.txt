a place that god could come not just visit but to dwell i'll be a living sanctuary we come here a couple times a week and gather together and this is called church in a sanctuary but god wants to have church all the time in our lives in our hearts and i'll say it that's a beautiful song to be singing amen god bless each of you today i had an announcement to make before we uh enter in uh to the word i want to say i appreciate the the song this morning i wish we had more specials amen i believe god is worthy of our best amen amen and i'd rather give them what little i do have then wait i had trying to wait till i have something better to give them right and i'd waste time and just give them give them your best but um our communion service has been um long waited for and we are gonna have communion june 19th that's two weeks from today it will be the first time of having full communion with us in in this service in this building here so it's a special in a couple of different ways um i want you to write that down june 19th i want you to come i want you to be prepared and uh it's uh a very real thing with god amen we we show the lord's death until he comes he wants us to remember calvary and and um so please be in prayer for one another concerning that amen amen um turn with me if you would to the book of saint john chapter 15 we're going to we've been doing a little series on remaining with god and uh this morning we want to entitle this message remaining in love remaining in love you know a lot of times god is doing things in her life and we have no idea what he's doing and after a while we see it and i think that's how it is with the ministry too he's the one ministering the worst thing that we could do is think that's brother john that's the worst thing that we could do because that will never usher in faith never it will bring doubt but if we can believe that it's god then god can deal more with our hearts amen and before we begin reading here let's just ask god come and bless his word to us heavenly father we are all standing with one thing in common that as we're needy of you we need you lord that we could prosper in your word that we could remain faithful remain fruitful and remain in love with you where our dependency is upon you and we pray today lord that everything in our thoughts of the world in our life and what's happened in the past could all be set aside at this time and that our focus could just be on you lord bring us in to a place where lord your word is speaking to our heart we know it's you speaking lord for we want to love you more than than ever before and we need to in this hour and we need your help for that lord your word declares that the love of god is shut about in our heart by the holy ghost we prayed this morning that you would fill us with more of the holy ghost and we know that your word your word the living word is the holy ghost and we pray for the the word that is spoken to become living inside of us real to us a personal way today pray that you would meet all the needs that would be here amongst us lord for we're very needy and multiple needs in our lives and our our loved ones but you're a god that's able to to meet every one of them to exceed our expectation with them because of the mighty power that you have lord and that you are and we pray that you'd be with those that are not present today lord we ask that you would go forth and go before them and meet their need today lord protect them and bring them back safe and sound father we commit the service in your hand and ask you now that you bless the reading of the word to our hearts we humbly pray for this revelation in jesus christ's name amen amen just two verses in saint john 15 verses 9 and verses 10. as the father have loved me so have i loved you continue ye in my love if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i've kept my father's commandments and abide in his love god bless you you may be seated amen well it's good to see everyone today amen and we want to welcome a very special guest with us um but jim powers of course i think you're called jimmy a lot of times and i do remember you i do remember you it's so good to have you it's an honor to have you may the lord jesus bless and strengthen you this morning amen we certainly appreciate brother batman sister batman just grand people love the lord and uh we're just grateful what god can do for a human being and and change our very our our nature but we want to continue in this series not knowing uh how long it will go or where it will go i had a thought maybe this would be the final one and then just something just i just felt not to not to say that but there's a lot to remaining with god first john 4 8 and 16 describe god is love just the foundation here love is not just part of god but he is love he is the very essence of the love and the instinctive nature of the divine agape love he is the source he is the author of agape love now this love of god is the most powerful force that there is in existence god literally changed the the formality of a perfect setting in heaven to be able to express all the love all the power that there is in the love of god and he allowed a completely different nature to be birthed just to exhibit and display this love because with without it he wouldn't be able to display it now this other nature that he let be birthed it was a a lesser love it was a a self-love a love for self and self-will and it took us self-centered love for god to fully express his love for his creation now think about that he had to have a contrast to how things are perfect in order for a full manifestation of what was perfect to be expressed like that song that we heard this morning a verse a line in that verse said show me things i've never seen before and that's what we're longing for we're longing to see more of god amen and the way that we do that is is to say i need i believe there's more forming where our flesh wants to feel like we've attained we've made it i've heard that i have read that and yet god wants to express something that we haven't seen on it and and revelation is um progressive we can get a revelation on the word a revelation of his love and and yet it just opens up more and more to us amen now a god who is holy and righteous and true he's never lied and yet he's the author of divine love and this love is described in the bible as is is a love that bears all things believes all things hopes all things endures all things and it never never never not once has failed amen right amen it is the love of our redemption of our salvation a love that is not self-centered it's not puffed up it doesn't vaunteth itself it doesn't seek it its own if i can say these two loves in one sense are a contrast to one another yes it's a love that seeketh after the well-being of others that's why the prophet could say that eternal life was truly living for others it wasn't a cliche it wasn't a saying it was a manifestation it's a love that's manifested in living for others and this love will bear all things and it's it's been uh it will give all things it is willing to suffer all things in order to see a soul prosper in fact there's no greater love than a man lay down his life for his friends for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son the love was so great that he gave and imagine if there was no lesser love no selfish love no uh no sin as we've been taught then god would never be able to express so great a love by giving because there'd be nothing to give to god is love and he so loved that he gave his perfect son so what does god expect back from us does this great love divine request expect or demand something back how can it be freely given and yet there'd be some sort of expectation right like a string attached now we can accept what his love has did for us or we can accept his love into our hearts it's two different things because everybody will accept salvation except except escape from hell he would that none would perish god's intention was not to just save us from hell he really wants to have a relationship with us now he would that none would perish but we will perish without a relationship amen because it isn't just grace for the whole world the whole world's saved no matter what no we've got to come to that place of a real relationship with god amen and as the prophet taught us there's no shirttail experiences we've got to have it personal for ourselves first john chapter 4 verse 11 says beloved first john chapter 4 verse 11 beloved if god so loved us we ought also to love one another now what does that word ought mean just think about that if i said brother ryan you you ought to be sitting in some other chair he's not going to feel like he has to sit in another chair because it's just ought don't have to it's just ought it's not quite what it means no man have seen god at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us now notice if we love one another that's the key hereby know we that we dwell in him and he and us because he's given us his spirit right and and the love of god is shared brought in their heart by the holy spirit first john 3 16 hereby perceive we the love of god because he laid down his life for us and we ought there it is again and we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren now john expressed that we ought to lay down our lives but jesus said it was a commandment john 15 12 says this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you the same way every parent wants their children to follow them if a parent teaches a child to their manners to say please to say thank you to say excuse me to say i'm sorry that parent wants that child to follow that it's just a natural thing and god wants us to follow what he's teaching us and that's truly to love one another exactly the same way amen now how false is it for a parent to teach his child i just thought it was so ironic in my life growing up not quite knowing god but seeing that my dad would tell me not to smoke while he had a cigarette he was smoking on any decent parent thinking knows that he's got to do what he's asking his children to do not to make light of my father but if you don't understand you really don't have god you can only do your best so you've got to do what you're asking your children to do and it's never too much it's never too much so is it too much that we love others the way that god has loved us now we can't do that with filial love we can't do that with our own abilities our own mind our own efforts it takes god living inside of us to be able to do that this is my commandment that ye love one another as i have loved you we're no longer just god's love is no longer just to benefit us it might have at the beginning right because we needed salvation but after a while there's an expectation we've been commanded by the son of god to manifest the same love now to others and he said in verse 13 that greater love have no man than this than a man lay down his life for his friends he came from eternity to show that and now he's saying you're here on earth and you just you just you start doing that to one another and then he says you are my friends if you do whatever i command you to love others with a self-centered love and yet proclaim christianity is false and he says that you're my friends if condition he's the only one that can make conditions how many times have you made conditions with your children yes you can play outside if you clean your room we've all made them and it's normal it's right how many times our kids say this isn't fair joe or tim's or sally's mom and dad don't make him do that comparing with and the devil just wants us to compare we can do what we want we don't have to go serve god jesus told his disciples that the very identity of a man's relationship with god would be expressed through the manifestation of the same love john 13 34 a new commandment i give it unto you that you love one another as i have loved you that ye also love one another and by this shall all men know that you're my disciple if you have love one for another amen it's the very identity of a man's relationship with god it's not what we know it's not what we say it's not what we quote it's not where we go it's what we manifest now to remain in a place that god will call you as disciples friend you've got to remain in love there's no other way the word is the only way the only truth and the only life there's there is no other way of course the world is full of different churches and dominations that try to point us in a way different other than the full word now all of them have a portion of the word but none of them have all the word and he's in his word he will always back up the word john 15 9 as the father have loved me so have i loved you so it is a trinkle dino down effect as the father's love me so i have loved you and i'm going to continue to love you right to the end i'm going to die for you and he says continue ye in my love just continue in it don't let it stop i'm just lock it up and if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i've kept my father's commandments and i abide in his love now if we don't abide in the commandment and what he's teaching us and telling us and whispering to our hearts there comes a separation between us and god and the and the thing of it is that that many believers don't even recognize it's happening because they're they they feel it's okay because nobody's perfect you know brother branham said that after the rapture happens people will be coming to the altar thinking gentiles will be coming to the altar thinking that they're getting saved and it'll be too late but they're still going through the formality of it but in themselves they think they're right they're doing the right thing so you see that we can still the devil has got the ability to convince humans church people church goers that they love god and they don't have to keep the commandments but i'll say this the elect will not be deceived [Music] that's the only group that that doesn't buy that the only group we were to ask most people who we know personally in our life think about them ask them this question do you love god or do you hate god now most people may not answer i love god but they certainly would never say i hate god so by default they feel they love god some people feel they love god all the time no matter what they do in life most people would not express with their own mouth a separation between them and god they don't want to cut them off they look at jesus as someone they're fond of even though they really don't know him even though they don't spend much time together maybe the same way they would look at their favorite singer or their movie star an athlete or some superhero they would say they just love them but they don't even spend time with them we've all been guilty of saying oh i love him i love the way he yeah he's a good one don't even know him a lot of times how people look at jesus many people love god with their natural female love and it feels like god's love but it's simply not right we want to remember what jesus taught us and if i could just paraphrase this if you love me it's not just a feeling it's a discipline of keeping my commandments it's a discipline it's not a feeling so forget the feelings forget the excuses focus on the direction that we need to be walking in jesus is always showing us how to live more for others we all believe in it we all say we're doing it but i'm telling you we need to do it more we need to do it more and jesus is constantly showing us more he's bringing all things to our remembrance as the devil is trying to always get us to compromise just like he did eve we've got to recognize the hiss of the serpent like that compromiser brother branham makes this statement he says we could love god every day of our lives and still miss it still miss it that means we've got to love god with his love that our love for him is not good enough we've got to love him back with the divine agape love and that only comes it only comes by the holy ghost and i don't understand why we're not seeking more holy ghost how else can we get filled with the love of god amen it's not something that we intellectually get and one of the hardest things that we could i feel it's more detrimental to us than good when we say i've got the holy ghost how about saying i need more holy ghost i'm not going to take away for what we have but if what you have has caused you to lay down your life for everybody until you die i'll say stay with it but if you see that you could be giving yourself more to the cause of christ then then seek the holy ghost and ask for more of the holy ghost because it's only christ in you that can do it ezekiel chapter 11 verse 19 god's love will keep his commandments my love won't ezekiel 11 verse 19 and i will give them one heart and i will put a new spirit with in you and i will take oh take the stony heart out of you out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh you ever look at somebody the way they're acting just say they just seem to be cold cold hard right well god promised us to take that out of us and to give us a heart of flesh in other words when you when you've ever seen a heart beat on tv we've all seen them it's pumping it's not it's moving our love needs to be moving amen that they may walk in my statutes that's the kind of walk the moving that needs to be happened so he puts us in us and he he says and keep my ordinance and do them they will walk in my sister keep my ordinance and do them and they shall be my people and i shall be their god all because he put a new spirit in us and that spirit will generate the love of god amen in our hearts it was just like mary was conceived and brought forth a son a supernatural experience that no man can explain that's exactly the same way that happens inside of you and me we can't explain it we try to figure it out we try to define it we try to say i got it we we try but you know what we can't we're just human beings it's god that does the supernatural in our lives if we can love one another without respect to persons brother sister that is not you anymore that's god in you the hope of glory but it's for them whose heart walketh after the uh whose heart walketh after the heart of their detestable things detestable things and their abominations basically after their own desires and i will i will recompense their way upon their own heads saith the lord god we've got to surrender our will ezekiel 36 26 a new heart also i give you and a new spirit well i put within you and i will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and i will give you a heart of flesh and i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk in my stats did you ever wonder i just can't see i don't feel like doing that i don't want to do that that's understandable that's the nature of our flesh that's why we just simply seek more of god we will automatically want to do it we want to walk in his word and keep his commandments and love one another and lay down our life because it's no longer us it's christ in us and we'll give him the glory for it too i will put my spirit within you and cause you to walk my statutes and to keep my judgments and to do them and ye shall dwell in the land that i give to your fathers and ye shall be my people and i will be your god it looks like god wants to do more than just save us from hell it looks like there's a relationship he's interested in it's no longer the the the preacher telling you the do's and don'ts of how to be a christian amen it's about god speaking to our hearts and calling us to a place with him that he wants us to abide in and to to dwell in and to to stay there to remain there we've all had experience with with god no doubt and how many of us wish they would continue amen well they they're not a gift if they were a gift then god would not count it as a relationship because all the angels in heaven are doing what god created them to do he wants to see someone with a choice to deny their own will for the will of god amen that's a love affair it's a real love affair if we're wanting more of the love of god in ours we ought to be seeking more of the holy ghost you can't separate the two in fact there's a lot of people that say they got the holy ghost but they don't love the bible tells me that they're a liar they're false now that's what the word says so i i don't mean to disappoint my disagreement with you but i'd rather stay with the word the word created us the word created the the world that we live in every morning i get up and i give god thanks for another day of life that i don't deserve i don't deserve to live today it makes me want to give more back to him the holy ghost will bring the divine nature of god's love into our heart it just will and when the love is projected brother branham says sovereign grace will take over so we need to project god's love i think too often when we're rejecting our own love our own thoughts our own desires our own wishes but we need to project his love amen and grace grace he supplieth all of our needs his grace will supply all of our needs according to his riches in glory let me say this too many people rely on past experiences that they've had with god as being good enough as if it's some sort of um identity about their relationship with god but jesus never said that right amen jesus never said because this great experiences and i used you it proves that you're my disciple he never said that we're saying that but he never said that he said when you manifest the laying down of your will your time your life your money to get some soul to a relationship with jesus because that's what he's doing he's knocking on the door wanting a relationship wanting to come in i mean he could take any one of us at any given time and use us to to lay hands on somebody to see them healed to speak with tongues to cast out a devil he could use any one of us at any time but none of it would show a relationship with god i mean if the devil used me what's what's greater than he uses the devil i'm comparing myself with the devil it's not god using it's you abiding in his love that's what's important that's what the focus needs to to remain amen has warned us that even though we are connected at one time in bearing fruit that we need to stay connected we need to stay in the vine or we get separated he said abide in me abide in my love without me you can do nothing if you don't bear fruit you're going to be cut off so these are just their warnings so jesus wants us to keep bearing fruit and the only way we can keep bearing spiritual fruit is to keep abiding spiritually in his love now i'll say it like this don't don't try to love god anymore with your natural love amen that's one minute you love them one minute you don't it's getting the old daisy out he loves me he loves me not he loves me she loves me not it's north pole south pole love live for others live for self you've got to abide in the love of god just remain there burning on fire for god continue in my love jesus said abide in my love even as i've kept my father's commandments and abide in his love he didn't leave he didn't lead the father's love right and that word abide that was just the foundation that we're starting the service the word abide is a verb not a noun meaning to stay in a given place a state a relationship or expense expectancy it means to continue to dwell to endure to be present to remain that's what it means to abide but in the midst of all that we have a choice we have a choice whether we're going to abide or not abide god does his part god said i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you but the bible doesn't say you'll never leave me and you'll never forsake me he said no man can pluck you from my from the father's hand no man can pluck you from my hand that doesn't mean we can't jump out and do our own thing he said nothing can separate you from the love of god but you can you can fall in love with other things and do your will you can change your mind you can go from one place to another place so i'll tell you this this thing that we emphasize here about a relationship it is the hottest thing i'll tell you brother johnson if there's anything i learned in your church there's anything i learned in this message it was about a relationship i don't know where anybody else was at i don't know where their thoughts or what they were wanting or what they wanted to get out of coming to church i don't know i don't know but to me it was about a relationship and i'm so thankful i i as brother branham says i'm so glad that he got a hold of me before the church did amen amen you know for even a man at his very best trying to help us not to belittle that but it ain't good enough a man that his very best is all vanity and a man stand behind the pulpit trying to do his best to help you is not good enough we need god in that man because it's got to be god speaking to us god's got to help us if god don't build the church they that labor labor in vain amen it's got to be him now we have a choice where we go to church the food we eat the friends we have what we're going to do with our lives we certainly have a choice in whether we're going to remain in god's love or not just don't let the devil tell you that it's automatic right all you got to do is look at your spouse and for a moment you give me an answer is it okay if your spouse does whatever she wants or whatever he wants all the time that they do it and expect that to be love abiding in that love no you would never have that in fact after a while they're not doing what you want them to do you say excuse me there's two to this marriage there's two to this relationship we can't go do what we want and say we're abiding in god's love it just doesn't work satan wants us to think it works but it doesn't don't automatically happen bible says we've got to fight the good fight of faith satan is always trying to steal our faith right so we got to fight for it well as we gotta fight for faith we gotta we gotta fight to stay in love amen every time you watch something on tv tell me you get off from watching what you watched on tv and you feel you're so more in love with god you got everything in this brother trying to pull you away from a relationship of a burning love with jesus christ the brandon said in the message a man running from the presence of the lord he's speaking about responsibility as a true christian he says it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the heart that sets you of fire and puts you out yonder with people making converts uh to cry so the next time that you want to answer if you're in love with god i want you to define if you are are experiencing this in your life because i think what a lot of message people want to do they want to redefine christianity than what the prophet said do you got the constant burning is it fire and love in your heart can't be in your head got to be in your heart and what does it do when it's so strong in your heart it sets you of fire and puts you out yonder it makes you go places that you wouldn't normally go makes you do things you wouldn't normally do and it isn't about you anymore it's the same thing that the father did through jesus when he gave his only begotten son and what jesus told his disciples to do to abide in my love to continue in my love and and to lay down your lies for one another keep it going don't just agree with it but keep it going keep it going you're not doing it for the church you're doing it for your relationship with jesus christ because that's all that matters the church doesn't matter but your relationship with christ that matters that matters to god we've got a whole world full of churches that people are married to the church we want to be married to christ married to the word bring forth sons and daughters of god with real with a real burning in their heart we all know it's harder to remain in love with god today than ever before we're living in the most hateful hour in the history of mankind the most hateful hour even church goers are more in love with themselves than at any other time they're more in love with themselves than in love with god but there's a little group that has received a revelation of how to overcome in their life and revelations tells us they lay they love not their lives unto death it is not a gift god is not going to hand you a gift of just hating yourself because every day you wake up and you get in front of the mirror and you're hoping that you look better than you did the day before it's in our instinctive nature to want to be good look good to love ourselves and to have others look at us and and say wow you're the greatest thing since sliced bread after a while you just get all toasted up and but if there's one revelation we need we need the revelation of not loving our lives to death now jesus said if any man come after me he's got to deny himself amen to to let go of his will because if we seek to save it we're going to lose it and you've got to maintain that in your relationship right to the end of your death all the way through and the more that you can maintain it the more of the fruit of god can come in your life today believers are in love with pleasures more than they're in love with god sarah thought while you could do this it's not a big thing come on before you know it you're doing more of it and doing more of it and before long you're looking forward to it and then before you know it you're making sacrifices that you could be spending time with god just to do it it just keeps growing now this is church people second timothy chapter 3 verse 2 says for men shall be lovers of their own self covetous bolsters proud unthankful this is the condition that the devil has gotten the church into now we know the bible says that satan he's weakening the nations the whole world is being weakened right now not just our nation we're the strongest nation becoming the weakest but he's also weakening the churches and how is he doing it by giving them what their flesh wants you want entertainment you want to be you want to enjoy a good happy time in church want your flesh to say yeah that was a good one or i he's funny or or are they they they got the great voices in their singing and the lights and you know i just love the way that nothing about the word nothing about the attraction of the word the bride is attracted to the word that's all she's looking at is all she wants because one day she's going to manifest it now the thing is don't let satan tell you you'll manifest at all at the end what you've got to believe is god has given us the word today to manifest it tomorrow amen amen and if you don't believe it it can't happen but you've got to receive that by faith when jesus was describing the end of the world in matthew chapter 24 verses 10 through 13 he says and then shall many be offended many shall be offended i don't think it's just going down the road and somebody kind of cuts in front of you and you get all worked up i'm i'm i'm saying it's in church i see it people just get offended about everything you go one minute after 60 minutes not true i'm not saying that but the bible says jesus said and shall betray betray one another people would become so bothered they're actually going to betray someone you know when you kill somebody they got different degrees right a man's right first degree and one of them's premeditated that's real bad you premeditate it you you know then you're really in trouble imagine betraying somebody you're consciously thinking i am not going to try to keep in unity with this brother it's not what we think and shall hate one another jester i love him i love him just a little bit less because i i don't want to say just outright because then i know i'd be wrong i feel convicted i don't want anybody know that i just do it a little bit how about love with god's love it's without respect to persons it lays down its life for its enemies now offended means entrapped tripped up enticed to sin or fall away into apostasy many shall betray one another and hate one another we're not exempt from the end times it isn't like you're so special that the devil is not going to come to you and bother your mind he's going to try to get in you to get in between somebody and call some division but when you learn to be so connected to god so in love with god that the devil can't use you for hate for a lesser love invite this more of the spirit of god in you don't be satisfied with how much you got always want more and he says here in verse 11 many false prophets shall rise and shall deceive many many people are going to arise and deceive many in other words uh so you got these people that are offended betraying one another and hating one another and they think it's okay there must be a spirit that's letting them think it's justifiable they still love god they still go they still believe the message they still sing and shout and praise god and talk about but they're deceived and it says and because iniquity shall abound the love of many shall wax cold love is an act of an act it's an active thing if it's not you might also say i loved at one time but to love is active it's not on hold you don't put love on hold if it wasn't for god loving us unconditionally we'd be in trouble and we got to love the way he loves amen believers are not abiding in god's love today they have a whole lot of expectation for others or what they should be doing and how they should be giving and how they should be laying down and loving but they themselves are cold so it's like they have a knowledge of it but they don't possess the spirit of it they're not really generating the warmth of god's love we've all heard the the saying you can't get warmed by a painted fire some beautiful picture of a nice fire oftentimes uh ann will send me a a picture of her fire that she's got at the camp and it's it's like a video even moves and you see the sparks and you can hear it because i feel no warm a lot of times people say they're christian they got the holy ghost but you feel no warm no warmth i don't know what message that is but it is not the message that we heard from the beginning we got to stay with the message to love one another amen our enemies should be feeling the warmth they should be think about it you're in such a control tower that you will hold back your love from somebody what does that tell you tells you god's not in control but you are because if god had his way in your body you would be loving unconditionally no matter what they did i don't care if they slapped your face taught behind your back stabbed you it don't matter it's god in you still loving them amen and if ain't happening seek more of the holy ghost by this uh but he said in verse 13 but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved and the way to endure through all the garbage that we're living in today is to remain in love with god it's a simple thing but you got to remain in love it's got to be your first and most motive jesus said the way that we remain there is to remain to keep his commandments right if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love even as i kept my father's commandments therefore i'm abiding in his love the commandments are important but too often spirits will convince believers that they can still do what they want and abide in god's love it starts with that thought in their head i'll say these these spirits fascinate believers by falsely representing that they are the holy ghost inside of them they are the inspiration of the holy ghost and they won't back up their actions with the word lord help us galatians chapter three verse one oh foolish galatians who have bewitched you that you should not obey the truth i say this persuasion hasn't come from above it's from below if you keep my commandments you shall abide in my love now jesus isn't just referring to the ten commandments or just certain things but all the commandments what has jesus been commanding you brother sister let me just ask you can you identify what jesus has been commanding you what's he been command you lately see we've got tumors that generality i'm just trying to do everything i can just do be the best christian i can be let's identify has he spoken to us what has he commanded god is not the author of confusion he works with us as individuals on things in our lives amen that's right amen and we should be able to identify what those are because of our relationship you know we all want to say god told me this and god told me that and god showed me this thing god showed me that well can you tell me what god's telling you to do in your life and not right now i can't but i tell everything else it's just it's we don't even recognize a lot of times there's spirits that speak to us but can we personally identify what he's been commanding us to do i don't want some i'm just generality that if you give me a generality you're telling me that your relationship is just general just a general christian just generally trying to do my best and generally just you know trying to help whoever i can help and you know general god don't want a general relationship he wants an intimate relationship something specific amen something like job have you considered my servant job there's none like him does everything i tell him to do he'll stay he'll abide with me oh satan no he won't just you know do this do that you know he'll just he'll be he'll cut himself off from the relationship with you he'll curse you don't think there's not a spiritual battle going on we got to be so in love with god that nothing can separate us amen now these are important questions to abiding in his love when he commands us to do something we don't want to be thoughtful lazy about it we don't want to be it's not that big a thing it's not the most important we can't have that attitude when he tells us to do something we've got to have that that respect we've got to we've got to have that godly fear about what he's spoken we've got to put forth some effort he expects us to follow through god is never going to let your relationship just sit around god doesn't have any sit around relationships it's it's always active it's always keep moving forward even in the middle of a trial tell the children of israel to move forward i'm with you go through go forward don't make excuses why you're not being strong for the lord today why you're not having that burning that love to reach out for your soul don't make any excuses god is not wasteful he doesn't let his relationships just deteriorate he does his part we've got to do our part he wants us to keep growing day deeper deeper in the love of jesus as the song goes jude chapter 1 verse 17 now my i i am halfway there i can just stop i suppose i could just stop but i don't want to stop you know taking a vote never works it never works no one is it works for one person it works for the person who really wants the word and they want to keep preaching other than that it don't work for anybody else yeah i don't want to keep you you've you've been here an hour and i don't want to over overdo it it wasn't my my plan but no i i just want you to all come back i want you to all come back and there are i could say the rest of this message it talks about the ways that we can abide in his love the things that we can do that we can do no what no we'll do it we'll do it on wednesday i i just feel bad taking too much time if i had just like you know five minutes or ten minutes but i got
