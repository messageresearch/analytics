[2:10] amen well we have a a late announcement
[2:14] always like late announcements
[2:17] right so uh brother Gabriel tari have a
[2:23] a church in an arbor it's called Little
[2:26] Flock and they're having a Memorial Day
[2:28] picnic at Hudson Mills Metro Park they
[2:31] had one last year brother Beckman and I
[2:34] were both there we had a great time lots
[2:37] of
[2:38] food so you'd be blessed to come so
[2:42] we're going to put this out in the back
[2:45] we want you to know about that
[2:52] amen so I don't have to ask you if you

[2:58] came then you get a gold
[3:02] star
[3:05] amen if you don't love God and you came
[3:08] that's that's
[3:10] important i' like you to turn with me
[3:12] this evening to uh Romans chapter
[3:16] n praise the Lord
[3:19] amen
[3:22] amen Romans chapter 9 and starting with
[3:26] verse 14
[3:31] it says what shall we say then is there
[3:34] unrighteousness with
[3:36] God God
[3:38] forbid for he saith to Moses I will have
[3:41] mercy on whom I will have mercy and I
[3:44] will have compassion on whom I will have
[3:48] compassion so then it is not of him that
[3:50] willth nor him that runneth but of God
[3:54] that showeth
[3:55] Mercy for the scripture saith unto
[3:58] Pharaoh even for this same purpose have
[4:01] I raised thee up that I might show my
[4:03] power in thee and that my name might be
[4:06] declared throughout all the
[4:08] Earth therefore hath he Mercy on whom he
[4:12] will have mercy and whom he will he
[4:15] hardeneth
[4:16] and thou Willl then say unto me why do
[4:19] he then find fault for who hath resisted
[4:23] his
[4:24] will nay but oh man who art thou that
[4:27] repliest against God shall the thing
[4:30] formed say to him that formed it why
[4:32] hast Thou made me
[4:34] thus hath not the Potter power over the
[4:37] clay and of the same lump to make one
[4:40] vessel unto honor and another unto
[4:43] dishonor what if God willing to show his
[4:47] wrath and to make his power known
[4:50] endured with much longsuffering the
[4:52] vessels of Wrath fitted to
[4:55] destruction and that he might make known
[4:58] The Riches of his glory on the the
[4:59] vessels of
[5:01] Mercy which Heath for prepared unto
[5:04] Glory even
[5:06] us whom he hath called not of the Jews
[5:10] only but also of the
[5:13] Gentiles let's bow our heads for word of
[5:16] prayer dear Lord Jesus we're so grateful
[5:20] Lord that you called us Lord we're so
[5:23] thankful father tonight that we could
[5:25] have ears to
[5:27] hear Lord I pray that you just come and
[5:30] be merciful to us and may you walk
[5:34] amongst us may you open your word to us
[5:38] may you speak to us plainly Lord that we
[5:41] can just walk uprightly before you and
[5:44] serve you with a pure heart in Jesus
[5:47] Christ's name we ask it amen amen you
[5:51] may be
[5:52] seated praise the
[5:54] Lord so I'd like to speak for a little
[5:59] while on a a
[6:00] successful
[6:03] walk
[6:05] amen when I when I read these scriptures
[6:09] these scriptures are always real
[6:12] sobering to
[6:15] me because I always wonder if in my
[6:20] failures is God going to cast me
[6:24] away and when I hear you know that that
[6:28] there'll come a time when
[6:30] when we'll come before the Lord and the
[6:32] Lord will start to talk to us and we go
[6:34] but Lord I didn't I I I did this for you
[6:38] and I did that for you and I did that
[6:40] for you and and God says depart from me
[6:43] I didn't even know
[6:44] you that is a very
[6:47] sobering and scary
[6:50] thought what is a successful
[6:54] walk what is a righteous walk before the
[6:57] Lord
[7:02] amen because the Bible here in verse 15
[7:06] he says he says God said to Moses I will
[7:09] have mercy on whom I will have mercy and
[7:12] I will compassion on him who I will have
[7:15] compassion well I want to be on that
[7:17] good
[7:20] side but it's God that does the
[7:24] choosing and
[7:26] then Paul recognizing that and he's
[7:28] talking to the young believers in Rome
[7:31] the Roman Church there he says he said
[7:34] you know he says then you will say to me
[7:37] then why does God condemn me for sin in
[7:40] my
[7:42] life why does he do that why does why
[7:45] didn't he give me a better
[7:48] chance and I can see that from these
[7:50] scriptures that there's not much hope
[7:53] for
[7:54] me
[7:57] amen cuz he says you can't can't even
[7:59] say to the Potter why did you make me
[8:02] like
[8:05] this why what what choice did I have in
[8:08] the
[8:11] matter and he says what is God willing
[8:15] to show his wrath and to make his power
[8:17] known endured with much such much
[8:21] longsuffering the vessels of Wrath
[8:23] fitted to
[8:24] destruction and that he might make known
[8:27] The Riches of his glory on the vessels
[8:29] of Mercy which he had before prepared
[8:32] unto glory amen even
[8:35] us
[8:39] Amen brother Brenham made this
[8:42] interesting statement
[8:44] which I just you just have to bear with
[8:48] me you know because we always got to lay
[8:51] a little bit of foundation before we can
[8:55] go and a lot of us might be W you know a
[8:58] lot of times I wonder I say Lord am I
[9:00] Pharaoh are you raising me up that I
[9:02] that I you're just going to destroy me
[9:04] in the
[9:05] end brother Brenham said you know when
[9:07] you think about God when you keep your
[9:10] mind oh you think he says think about it
[9:13] you said in church and you think about
[9:15] everything else but
[9:16] God how are you going to do your washing
[9:19] and what you're going to do at the
[9:20] office tomorrow and and how you're going
[9:22] to do this that or the other keep your
[9:24] mind off of that and think on God
[9:27] Amen I mean when you come when when your
[9:31] wife or you know you go somewhere and
[9:34] you've been working all day and you you
[9:37] go to the well you don't go to the
[9:39] drive-through window but you you go to
[9:40] the restaurant and everything and and
[9:42] you're going to get down and you're
[9:43] going to sit down and have a meal the
[9:45] very first thing you do is you go and
[9:46] you wash your hands because like brother
[9:49] Dennis had really dirty hands
[9:52] tonight and when we come into church
[9:54] this is a spiritual meal that we've come
[9:56] to right we need to wash our hands
[10:01] so it's good to greet one another and
[10:03] everything and talk of you know take say
[10:06] your peace and everything else but then
[10:08] you go in the prayer room and you wash
[10:10] your
[10:11] hands and that's wonderful that you're
[10:14] washing your spiritual hands your
[10:16] spiritual heart but then when you come
[10:18] back out and you start talking about the
[10:19] things of the world you've just got your
[10:22] hands all dirty again and how can you
[10:25] come in and and then try to worship God
[10:30] it's what if God is is watching
[10:35] us
[10:37] amen keep your mind off of those things
[10:40] and think on
[10:42] God and the Bible says if there be any
[10:44] praise if there be any virtue think on
[10:46] these things wonder wonder if I'll be
[10:49] called in the prayer line wonder if God
[10:51] will even speak to me I wonder how many
[10:53] tonight came and said oh I wonder if God
[10:55] will even have anything does he even
[10:57] know that I showed up
[11:01] because he's got to speak to my heart
[11:04] because if he doesn't speak to my heart
[11:06] then I'm going out just as hard as I
[11:08] came when I came in amen praise the
[11:11] Lord he says now brother brandham says I
[11:14] wonder if I'll be called in the prayer
[11:16] line I wonder if God will speak he says
[11:20] don't think that kind of negative
[11:24] thought how are you going to do that if
[11:27] your focus is on not going in the prayer
[11:31] room and we're not we're not talking
[11:34] it's you know God doesn't have a a this
[11:37] isn't like when I go to work
[11:40] course when I when I got into management
[11:44] I've been on salary for so long people
[11:46] used to talk to me about overtime they
[11:47] said don't they pay you time and a half
[11:49] I said oh I know it's in my base pay I
[11:52] guess I said so I work all the
[11:56] time I just I just show up I don't have
[12:00] to punch a clock but when I come here
[12:03] and I go in the prayer room and I spend
[12:06] God isn't looking did you spend two
[12:07] minutes in there well you got to spend
[12:09] three or I'm not going to hear you you
[12:11] got to spend 12 or no but brother I got
[12:14] to wash my hands and I got to find a way
[12:17] to do that and I want to be a
[12:20] success
[12:23] amen so brother brandom
[12:26] said he said in here he says so he says
[12:30] Abraham it was becoming to Abraham to
[12:34] separate himself from
[12:36] unbelief and it's becoming to any
[12:38] believer to separate yourself from
[12:42] unbelief Abraham it was becoming to him
[12:46] to walk in a Land of his own him and God
[12:49] and when brother brandham says becoming
[12:51] in here he's talking about that it was a
[12:53] reflection it was something that was
[12:56] when God called Abraham to come out
[12:58] Earth the ches then it was becoming it
[13:02] was it was a result of that call Abraham
[13:06] walked in that word that Revelation and
[13:08] when he walked in that it manifested
[13:11] what God had spoke to him
[13:15] amen so he said it it was becoming to
[13:18] him to walk in a Land of his own him and
[13:21] God alone because he was a prophet and
[13:24] the world didn't understand why Abraham
[13:26] made such a choice why'd he leave his
[13:28] home why'd he leave his church why'd he
[13:31] leave his people why did he do such a
[13:34] rational thing to sourn in a Strange
[13:36] Land when there's no food there's no
[13:38] water why did he go into these Bleak
[13:40] deserts where men had not went yet but
[13:43] it was becoming to him for he was a
[13:45] prophet to separate himself from all
[13:48] unbelief and to walk alone with God and
[13:51] God said separate yourself and I'll
[13:53] bless you
[13:55] amen amen and I always struggle every
[13:59] time even when I hear it today I heard
[14:01] it today on the tape and I was working
[14:03] out and and brother Brandon was quoting
[14:05] that scripture you know if you if you
[14:07] love the world or the things of the
[14:12] world you're
[14:16] toast you are
[14:20] Pharaoh how many things do we do how
[14:24] many
[14:25] things do we do involves the world
[14:33] amen but
[14:35] remember we want to talk about a
[14:37] successful
[14:39] walk God when he calls
[14:42] people he calls for a total separation
[14:45] from all the things of the world
[14:48] Annihilation from the worldly
[14:51] things that is
[14:54] big that is annihilation of all worldly
[15:00] things
[15:03] amen separate
[15:05] yourself and God will bless
[15:08] you come out from among them be not
[15:11] partakers of their sins yoke yourself
[15:13] not among unbelievers but yoke yourself
[15:16] with Believers fellow citizens of the
[15:19] Kingdom
[15:21] amen how am I even going to be the
[15:25] Abraham the elect the bride of Christ in
[15:30] this
[15:32] age what is it that I'm going to somehow
[15:36] sacrifice that I can be in that called
[15:38] out
[15:41] number and if there is a Bible question
[15:44] there has to be a Bible
[15:47] answer
[15:49] amen and if you've never thought on
[15:51] these things I'm making you thinking
[15:54] about them
[15:56] tonight because every time I read Romans
[15:59] 9 I go God said I raised up pharaoh and
[16:04] put him in a position of
[16:07] authority
[16:10] blessings
[16:12] servants
[16:13] money a great place to live food on the
[16:16] table he raised him up to that place
[16:19] that he might Harden him at the
[16:22] appropriate
[16:26] time what if you're that pharaoh
[16:33] amen so I want to go tonight to go to
[16:36] Isaiah 43 we're going to start we're
[16:38] going to look at some scriptures in
[16:41] Isaiah
[16:47] amen praise the
[16:50] Lord Isaiah 43 verse1 it says but now
[16:54] thus saith the Lord that created thee oh
[16:58] Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel
[17:01] fear not for I have redeemed Thee I have
[17:06] called thee by thy name Thou Art mine I
[17:10] love
[17:12] that God is thus sayith the Lord you
[17:15] know what that is that's forever
[17:17] settled and God speaking here he says he
[17:22] says thus sayith the Lord that created
[17:26] thee oh
[17:27] Jacob and he that formed thee oh Israel
[17:31] fear not for I have redeemed thee you
[17:35] didn't do anything about it he
[17:38] did he created
[17:41] you he brought you into this
[17:44] world as some mothers used to say I
[17:48] brought you into this world I can take
[17:50] you
[17:52] out now I wouldn't say there's any
[17:54] mothers like that here
[17:56] but but you know that's what but God
[17:59] created
[18:02] Jacob and he brought him into the world
[18:04] and he said you know what Jacob he says
[18:06] I have redeemed thee praise the Lord
[18:10] amen he says when thou passest through
[18:13] the waters I will be with thee praise
[18:16] the
[18:17] Lord
[18:19] amen he says and through the rivers they
[18:24] shall not overflow thee I'm not even
[18:26] going to drown in this mess amen
[18:30] amen they shall not overflow thee and
[18:33] when thou wst through the fire thou
[18:36] shall not be burned
[18:38] hallelujah amen neither shall the flame
[18:42] Kindle upon thee for I am the Lord thy
[18:46] God the Holy One of Israel thy savior
[18:51] praise
[18:52] God
[18:54] amen
[18:57] amen now when I look at this I'm excited
[19:01] amen and when I look at verse one put
[19:04] verse one back up there I want you to
[19:06] look at verse one he says but now thus
[19:10] sayith the Lord that created thee oh
[19:13] Jacob and he that formed thee o
[19:17] Israel wait a
[19:19] minute Jacob and Israel's the selfsame
[19:26] person we're not talking about two
[19:28] people
[19:30] here we're just talking about
[19:32] one turn over a couple of scriptures or
[19:36] to chapter
[19:38] 5 and we want to look at verse
[19:43] four he says here he says for Jacob my
[19:47] servant's sake and Israel mine
[19:53] elect I have even called thee by thy
[19:56] name and I have surnamed thee though
[20:00] thou Hast not known
[20:03] me
[20:06] amen God created
[20:09] Jacob and he created Jacob for a
[20:13] purpose and he call
[20:17] Israel
[20:19] amen
[20:23] amen God even called him by his
[20:26] name so if we're going to understand
[20:28] this we've got to go back here a little
[20:30] bit to the Book of
[20:32] Genesis praise God
[20:38] Amen in Genesis
[20:41] 32 and verse 24 it says and Jacob was
[20:46] left alone now Jacob had spent his whole
[20:48] life you know he he stole the birthright
[20:51] we know that and he tricked his father
[20:54] into doing that and his father actually
[20:58] knew that he had tricked
[21:00] him because his father if you go back
[21:03] and you look at the scriptures but we're
[21:04] not preaching about that but we'll find
[21:06] out that when Jacob went into his father
[21:09] he had put uh some wool on his arms to
[21:12] make himself look hairy and he he put
[21:15] some perfume on to make him smell like
[21:17] the field and he went in with the
[21:20] Venison and daddy said to his son his
[21:24] very deceitful son he said
[21:29] uh you got the venison awfully fast he
[21:32] said oh yeah the Lord blessed me really
[21:34] well and I I I shot the bow and I killed
[21:37] the venison right away and it was a
[21:39] sheep that he that was it was disguised
[21:42] you know you can do a lot with
[21:45] spices and he came in with a sheep right
[21:49] and he gave it to his dad and his dad
[21:51] come here he says come
[21:54] here he says because my eyes are blind
[21:59] he said ' let me feel
[22:01] you H and he kind of feeling him he said
[22:06] let me smell your
[22:08] neck he said you know this is a funny
[22:11] thing he said you feel like uh Esau and
[22:15] you smell like Esau but you got the
[22:18] voice of
[22:22] Jacob I don't get it Daddy knew
[22:29] Jacob went off to the land of you
[22:33] Mesopotamia and he went over and he he
[22:35] met up with laan and and he had a very
[22:38] successful life he he had he got a lot
[22:40] of things he got sheep and and he had a
[22:43] what if fact had two wives and then he
[22:45] got some concubines and he had a pel of
[22:48] kids and and he had money and he had a
[22:50] whole bunch of things and everything
[22:52] else but there came a time when God
[22:55] called for a
[22:56] reckoning God called calls man to a
[22:59] reckoning man thinks he's got everything
[23:02] and that he can get it he can do
[23:03] whatever he wants and else but God's
[23:05] going to call us to a reckoning and we
[23:07] saw that in Romans n he said I will show
[23:11] Mercy on whom I will show mercy and I
[23:13] will show compassion on whom I will show
[23:15] compassion and he says in fact he says I
[23:18] can raise people up and I can put people
[23:21] down because I am God and I don't need
[23:25] counsel I don't need your opinion I
[23:27] don't need your ideas because I already
[23:30] know
[23:31] you I already know what's in your heart
[23:34] I already know what you're thinking
[23:37] tonight and when you came in service
[23:40] tonight you probably weren't thinking
[23:44] this but you need to know what the
[23:47] scripture says so
[23:50] Jacob he he was going back and he
[23:54] realized that now he had he he's his
[23:58] Mommy and Daddy they had passed away and
[24:01] he says now I gotta I got to meet up
[24:03] with my brother Esau and Esau's a pretty
[24:08] big guy he's kind of like brother Marty
[24:11] and compared to me I'm little with
[24:13] brother
[24:14] Marty you know and and I'm a little bit
[24:17] afraid of that so Jacob thought I'll
[24:21] I'll connive a plan and that's the
[24:24] problem with us we're always conniving a
[24:26] plan we're going to come up with a plan
[24:28] I'm going to come up with a plan and
[24:30] what I'm going to do is I'm going to
[24:31] send all of the blessings that God has
[24:34] given me I'm going to I'm going to pass
[24:37] them by Esau and and and when he sees
[24:41] all the blessings and how I'm prosperous
[24:44] and maybe his greed will get the better
[24:46] of him and he'll think I can bless him
[24:48] too maybe he'll think that'll be you
[24:51] know and then he'll see my wives and my
[24:53] kids and he'll take pity on me because
[24:55] you know these babies are really cute
[24:59] they
[25:00] are mothers grandmas they melt for
[25:04] babies they they love that
[25:07] stuff amen so he he took them all over
[25:11] there and in verse 24 it says and Jacob
[25:15] was left
[25:16] alone and there Wrestled a man with him
[25:19] until the breaking of the
[25:21] day
[25:23] now you think they just sat down and
[25:26] maybe talked
[25:29] but I'm telling you right now Jacob was
[25:32] fighting for his
[25:34] life this guy was punching him and he
[25:38] was punching him back and they were down
[25:41] on the ground and wrestling and kicking
[25:43] each other in the grin and in the in the
[25:45] side and in the they were they were
[25:48] going at it and they were fighting Jacob
[25:52] knew this was a time he had to make the
[25:55] right kind of decision amen
[26:00] and it says here it says and when he saw
[26:02] that he prevailed not against him so
[26:05] when this this man this unnamed man saw
[26:09] that he prevailed not against
[26:12] Jacob Jacob was so serious about what he
[26:16] was doing that the angel realized he
[26:21] wasn't he needed an extra little thing
[26:24] to do to Jacob
[26:29] and he reached over and he touched him
[26:31] in the thigh and popped his hip joint
[26:35] out and that
[26:39] hurt and Jacob didn't like
[26:44] that but Jacob didn't let
[26:48] go Jacob didn't let go even in all that
[26:52] pain all that trial he didn't let
[26:55] go and and they angel said to him he
[26:59] says let me go for the day cometh the
[27:04] day
[27:04] breakthe said to him and says I'm not
[27:07] going to let you go except you bless me
[27:10] you have got to do something because my
[27:13] brother's about to kill
[27:16] me
[27:19] amen and he said unto him what is thy
[27:22] name and he said Jacob and he said thy
[27:26] name Shall be Called no more Jacob but
[27:32] Israel for as a prince hast thou power
[27:36] with God and with men and has prevailed
[27:41] it's the only place in the scriptures
[27:44] where a man has won he has prevailed
[27:49] over
[27:52] God Jacob prevailed over God and God
[27:58] looked at Jacob and said he's got
[28:01] something that I'm looking
[28:03] for and he popped his knee out or his
[28:07] his thigh
[28:08] out and the Bible says God didn't heal
[28:12] him
[28:14] either because he had a point that's
[28:17] something he wanted him to
[28:18] know and Jacob
[28:21] limped the rest of his days till he
[28:25] died he probably asked God a lot of
[28:27] times said God what why don't you heal
[28:28] me of this
[28:29] thing God M
[28:33] NOP
[28:35] nope so it's a funny
[28:38] thing now we see let's let's go back to
[28:41] Isaiah 43 and and let's look at this
[28:46] again I'm going
[28:48] to spend just a moment
[28:51] here I can find Isaiah again
[29:01] Isaiah 43:1 says but now thus saith the
[29:04] Lord that created thee oh
[29:08] Jacob God was the one that created
[29:12] Jacob's fleshly
[29:15] body God created
[29:17] him God brought him into the
[29:20] world God gave him a
[29:22] family God gave him a mother and a
[29:25] father and a brother God did that
[29:30] but God also
[29:33] formed thee o
[29:38] Israel and the Israel the prince with
[29:41] God wasn't the guy with the
[29:45] limp it was the elected predestinated
[29:48] seed that was in his
[29:53] heart Jacob was the outward man
[29:58] and Israel was that seed on the inside
[30:02] that said I'm not leaving till you bless
[30:05] me I'm not leaving till I get the Holy
[30:07] Ghost with all I want it I'm not leaving
[30:11] till you answer my prayer I'm not
[30:13] leaving till you change my life he's not
[30:15] looking at the outward man he's looking
[30:17] at the inward man
[30:19] amen praise the Lord
[30:22] amen so I'm going to go to Exodus
[30:25] 3 so a lot of people when you know when
[30:28] they come to the Lord they it's always
[30:32] it's a battle they when they come to the
[30:36] Lord they they they got all kinds of
[30:38] carnal ideas they got all kinds of
[30:41] things but we're going to take a look in
[30:43] the scriptures tonight and we're going
[30:45] to watch how that we're hidden in here
[30:51] amen amen in Exodus 3 starting with
[30:54] verse 6 it says moreover he said
[30:58] now this
[30:59] is Moses he's at the burning bush Okay
[31:03] so so we've got our foundation stones in
[31:06] place he says moreover the burning bush
[31:09] the fire it says I am the god of thy
[31:13] father the god of Abraham the god of
[31:16] Isaac and the god of
[31:20] Jacob not the god of
[31:23] Israel the god of
[31:26] Jacob the god of the flesh ly
[31:29] man the guy that had the DNA that
[31:31] Abraham had the guy that had the
[31:36] bloodline the guy that had the promise
[31:38] was
[31:43] to and the god of Jacob and Moses hid
[31:46] his face for he was afraid to look upon
[31:49] God you know see that's a that's the
[31:51] mystery that's always the
[31:54] mystery how you can come in church and
[31:57] not watch your hands or wash your hands
[31:59] and then just get all mess and then
[32:01] spend half the service looking at your
[32:04] phone and and you know turn it off
[32:09] you're meeting
[32:10] God don't you know God is
[32:13] here if you're looking at your phone you
[32:15] don't believe what I just
[32:20] said and you're all looking at me like
[32:22] I'm crazy I was a senior executive where
[32:24] they wanted to know everywhere I was at
[32:27] just ask my
[32:30] wife hey don't you ever turn your phone
[32:33] off
[32:39] Bruce but God we are coming when Moses
[32:44] stood before the burning bush I imagine
[32:48] he was
[32:50] terrified this wasn't just a little
[32:52] friendly
[32:54] talk I am the god of Abraham I am the
[32:57] god of Isaac I am the god of Jacob amen
[33:00] and Moses hid his face and the Lord had
[33:02] said I have surely seen the Affliction
[33:04] of my people which are in Egypt and I
[33:07] have heard their Cry by reason of their
[33:10] taskmasters for I know their sorrows and
[33:12] I have come down to deliver them out of
[33:14] the hand of Egypt out of the Egyptians
[33:17] and to bring them up out of the land
[33:18] unto a good land and a large unto a land
[33:21] flowing with milk and honey under the
[33:23] place of the Canaanites and the Hittites
[33:25] and the amorites and the perizzites and
[33:27] the hivites and the jebusites and you
[33:29] notice if you go back and just take a
[33:31] good look and underline Isaiah
[33:34] 43 God gives a gives a promise in there
[33:37] he says I am the one that redeemed you I
[33:40] am the one I can protect you in the
[33:43] storm I can protect you in the fire I
[33:46] can protect you in the flood I am God I
[33:50] change not my promises are yay and
[33:53] amen it has to become part of our Lives
[33:57] amen
[34:00] amen and he says he talks about here he
[34:03] says a land flowing with milk and honey
[34:04] in a place he says now therefore Behold
[34:07] The Cry of the children of
[34:13] Israel not the Cry of
[34:17] Jacob not the
[34:19] Cry of the flesh you know because Jacob
[34:24] had a
[34:26] lineage but but everybody that's called
[34:29] Jacob is in
[34:32] Israel God didn't hear Jacob's
[34:35] cry God heard the elect
[34:39] cry he said Jacob my servant Israel my
[34:46] elect isn't that what we read you do
[34:49] believe the scriptures
[34:54] right he says is come unto me and I have
[34:57] also seen the oppression wherewith the
[34:59] Egyptians oppressed them come now
[35:01] therefore and I will send thee under
[35:03] Pharaoh that thou mayest bring forth my
[35:07] people the children
[35:13] of
[35:17] Jacob you know you wonder about that you
[35:19] I tell Don I don some I we go home and
[35:23] we talk because we had a long drive to
[35:24] go home and I say you know it's really a
[35:27] funny thing I mean you know 3 million
[35:29] people coming up out of is you know
[35:31] coming up out of Egypt they all came up
[35:33] there but
[35:35] but they weren't all the children of
[35:38] Israel they were the children of
[35:41] Jacob it was the children of Jacob that
[35:44] came out of
[35:47] there I want you to skip down
[35:51] here to Exodus
[35:55] 4 amen
[35:58] Exodus
[35:59] 4 and verse
[36:02] 22 I thought brother darl
[36:05] Ward I thought he was going to preach
[36:08] some of the things that I saw last week
[36:09] I said otana I said I'm seeing things
[36:13] and brother Daryl he was he was kind of
[36:15] dancing around
[36:16] it well let me show you this verse 22
[36:21] and thou shalt say unto Pharaoh thus
[36:23] sayith the Lord
[36:26] Israel is my my
[36:28] son but I am the god of Abraham Isaac
[36:33] and
[36:37] Jacob why didn't he called Jacob his
[36:43] son because Jacob was his servant but
[36:48] Israel was
[36:50] his
[36:53] amen Israel is my son even my first
[36:58] born that was Esau's mistake Esau
[37:02] thought that when that when Jacob asked
[37:06] for the
[37:08] birthright that there was no way
[37:11] absolutely no way that
[37:14] Esau would you know how many I
[37:18] [Music]
[37:20] know gi's got kids he's got lots of kids
[37:23] now Ryan and Lori have children and you
[37:25] have children and we we there's children
[37:28] here my firstborn is Rebecca and and
[37:31] Ruth which is my second born she can
[37:33] never become the firstborn I don't care
[37:36] what you do she's the
[37:38] firstborn jonath Jonathan's the no
[37:41] jonath Abigail's the firstborn so
[37:44] Jonathan can't become the
[37:47] firstborn so Esau's mistake was he said
[37:50] yeah so what if you want the birthright
[37:52] he said I've got the birthright cuz I'm
[37:54] the first born I it don't matter what I
[37:57] do with it it does
[38:01] matter it does matter it mattered to God
[38:04] and God right here testifying says
[38:08] Israel is my
[38:12] firstborn what happened to
[38:14] Jacob God's not saving
[38:17] Jacob
[38:19] amen I say unto thee let my son go that
[38:24] he may serve me and if thou refuse to
[38:26] let him go beh behold I will slay thy
[38:29] son even thy
[38:32] firstborn
[38:34] amen I'll take him
[38:36] out
[38:43] amen so brother bham said he says so now
[38:45] we're going to take a talk about a
[38:48] journey how that God brought his people
[38:51] out of Egypt into the promised land and
[38:54] it's a perfect type of leaving sin and
[38:58] coming into the
[38:59] spirit amen now there's three stages of
[39:03] this journey first Israel is in
[39:07] Egypt Israel and Jacob is the same
[39:09] person I don't know why they call it
[39:11] Israel why didn't they call it Jacob was
[39:12] in
[39:13] Egypt because God wasn't looking at the
[39:16] natural man God was looking at the
[39:17] spiritual man he was looking at the guy
[39:20] on the
[39:21] inside
[39:23] amen Israel was in Egypt Israel in the
[39:27] journey Israel in Palestine which is a
[39:29] perfect type of justification by faith
[39:32] coming out
[39:34] sanctification as it passed through the
[39:36] blood and the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[39:38] it's perfect the stages of the church
[39:41] that is where the church is staged now
[39:44] amen amen praise the Lord so there in
[39:48] five Junctions of time brother bam say
[39:50] so there down there in Egypt and how he
[39:52] performed those signs and wonders and
[39:54] the things that he had done he is God
[39:56] none can take his place so now we're
[39:58] going to talk about what happened in
[40:00] Romans 9 because Romans 9 talks about
[40:05] Pharaoh talks about how God hardened
[40:07] Pharaoh's heart
[40:09] amen but you know in in Romans n it
[40:13] doesn't talk much about
[40:15] Israel and he don't talk about Jacob but
[40:17] he talks about
[40:21] Pharaoh praise the Lord
[40:25] amen none can take his place
[40:27] notice God performed his Miracle he gave
[40:30] Pharaoh a
[40:32] chance and Pharaoh failed and refused to
[40:35] take his chance and then there was
[40:37] nothing left and when a man spurns the
[40:39] mercy of God there's only one thing left
[40:42] and that's judgment and my dear friend
[40:44] today God helping us when you see the
[40:47] end of this text come and if you spurn
[40:50] the mercy that's offered to you today by
[40:52] Jesus Christ the Holy Ghost there will
[40:54] be nothing left but Divine judgment and
[40:57] and there can't be nothing left Pharaoh
[40:59] finally send away his day of Grace and
[41:02] there wasn't nothing left because the
[41:05] junction was at
[41:08] hand God
[41:11] blessed Jacob in
[41:16] Egypt 400 years Jacob was in Egypt they
[41:21] went down there and they they built
[41:23] houses they had families they had
[41:26] successful businesses they forgot about
[41:29] God they read the promise every once in
[41:31] a while they got up and read Abraham's
[41:33] prophecy you know they went to church
[41:35] they were good people you know but God
[41:38] had a time he had a time when he was
[41:41] going to call for that elected seed he
[41:45] was going to call for
[41:47] Israel he was going to call for him but
[41:50] Israel was hid inside of
[41:53] Jacob he was hid inside of him and what
[41:56] I thought when I started seeing that I
[41:58] started looking and said oh look at that
[42:00] he's taking them to the promised land
[42:02] and you know who's in the promised land
[42:04] Baptist Pentecostals Presbyterian
[42:08] Catholic couple different kinds of
[42:10] Catholics hundreds of them 900
[42:12] denominations there's all kinds of
[42:13] people living in the promised land all
[42:16] trying to discourage Israel from
[42:19] possessing the land
[42:21] amen amen those those denominations
[42:25] weren't in Egypt
[42:28] they weren't in
[42:29] Egypt Jacob was in Egypt you were in
[42:33] Egypt we were all in
[42:36] Egypt but there was something
[42:38] inside amen amen I love this Isaiah F or
[42:45] Exodus 5 verse one it says and after
[42:49] Moses and Aaron went in and they told
[42:51] Pharaoh they said thus saith the Lord
[42:53] God of
[42:57] he identified himself as the god of
[42:59] Jacob at The Burning
[43:03] Bush Moses knew him as the god of
[43:06] Abraham Isaac and Jacob yet when he went
[43:09] before Pharaoh he made no mention of
[43:15] that because he was calling the elect
[43:18] out of
[43:20] Egypt praise the
[43:22] Lord he said let my people go that they
[43:26] may hold a feast on unto me in the
[43:28] wilderness praise God
[43:30] amen amen and Pharaoh said who is the
[43:36] Lord who is this
[43:39] God that I should obey his voice to let
[43:42] Israel go I know not the Lord neither
[43:45] will I let Israel
[43:48] go Pharaoh didn't know anything about
[43:52] and you know Pharaoh is the type of the
[43:54] devil just thought i' let you know
[43:57] couple of nice real good types
[44:00] here so when God started to call you out
[44:03] of Egypt he had to go to
[44:05] Pharaoh he had to go to the devil and
[44:08] say hey that's my son time to give him
[44:11] up that's my daughter time to give him
[44:14] up and he
[44:17] said you know you know when God calls a
[44:21] Believer Out Of The World God is
[44:24] obligated to start doing Supernatural in
[44:26] his life life and he does Supernatural
[44:29] in his life so that you know it's God
[44:33] it's not some man's made idea it's
[44:36] God you'll see things other people go
[44:40] that ain't God don't talk to me about it
[44:42] because I see it's
[44:45] God and everything that happened Israel
[44:48] got well Jacob got excited but he didn't
[44:51] know Israel was in
[44:53] there Moses did 10 miracles
[44:57] and and Pharaoh every time Moses you
[45:02] know cuz when when God went to the devil
[45:06] to to fight over your
[45:10] soul the devil didn't believe him said
[45:13] well let me tell you about all the bad
[45:14] things that person
[45:16] did let me tell you about what a mess
[45:19] they are that's not your son said okay
[45:23] and he started little things started to
[45:25] crack little things that all of a sudden
[45:28] you wondered about you're just going to
[45:29] wait a minute I never seen God before
[45:32] but
[45:33] now weird things are
[45:36] happening things are starting to happen
[45:39] that's because you're Israel You're not
[45:42] Pharaoh pharoh's the
[45:45] devil God didn't raise you up to destroy
[45:49] you amen Jacob I created Israel I formed
[45:57] the scriptures are perfect amen praise
[46:00] the Lord so Pharaoh he he had a problem
[46:03] with it he he said well he didn't know
[46:06] the Lord and then so God started to show
[46:11] you who God
[46:13] was amen because all of us were born in
[46:16] sin shap and in iniquity come to the
[46:18] world speaking lies lies was our second
[46:21] language probably our
[46:22] [Laughter]
[46:24] first and we were a bunch of Rascals to
[46:26] be begin with we were no good not I mean
[46:29] brother brandom he gave all kinds of
[46:31] examples about ratten people and we're
[46:34] all rten everyone us to stand up and say
[46:36] I was the chief of Sinners wouldn't you
[46:39] say that and and if you don't believe
[46:41] you were the chief of the sinner what
[46:42] church you
[46:44] in right God is trying to do something
[46:48] for you tonight amen praise the Lord
[46:52] amen so he goes through here and he
[46:54] starts to reveal to Israel that there's
[46:57] Deliverance the time of our deliverance
[47:00] is at hand amen he's not looking at
[47:02] Jacob he's looking at
[47:04] Israel and Pharaoh he's just bringing
[47:08] judgment on pharaoh and Pharaoh is a
[47:10] tough guy because he will not let you go
[47:14] easy he won't let you go easy he'll come
[47:18] up with all kinds of ideas look at this
[47:20] I'm I'm going to take you to Exodus 8
[47:23] verse 25 praise the Lord amen am
[47:28] amen and Pharaoh called to Moses and for
[47:31] Aaron and he said okay I've had I okay I
[47:36] yeah
[47:37] okay Dennis yeah I might let him go C
[47:42] but Dennis you can
[47:45] go
[47:47] but look I know you're already going to
[47:50] church so just worship God in the church
[47:53] after the dictates of your heart you
[47:55] don't you don't really have to go to a
[47:57] Promised Land you don't really have to
[48:00] have a holy ghost you don't you don't
[48:02] really have to get baptized right you
[48:05] don't you don't really have just just
[48:07] stay right here you can that look at
[48:09] what he says that's what he told him he
[48:12] goes sacrifice to your God in this
[48:16] land right here you don't have to leave
[48:19] Egypt serve him
[48:22] here but you know
[48:25] Moses and God
[48:27] they don't make no deals with the
[48:29] devil praise
[48:31] God he doesn't make no deals with it so
[48:35] then he goes he goes down here to verse
[48:38] 28 because look at well let's read some
[48:42] of this verse 26 so Moses said uh no
[48:46] we're not doing that it is not meat to
[48:49] do so for we shall sacrifice an
[48:51] abomination of the Egyptians to the Lord
[48:53] Our God first of all we might speak in
[48:56] tongues and you call that of the devil
[48:58] so the things that we're about to do
[49:01] we're going to change our lives we're
[49:03] going to do a lot of things that you
[49:04] aren't going to
[49:06] like amen Lo shall we sacrifice an
[49:11] abomination of the Egyptians before
[49:13] they're even their own eyes and then
[49:15] won't you kill us we will go three days
[49:19] journey into the Wilderness and
[49:20] sacrifice to the Lord Our God as he
[49:23] shall command
[49:24] us and pharah says Pharaoh
[49:27] goes okay that's a good argument I I'll
[49:30] admit he says well look I'll let you go
[49:34] and you can sacrifice to the Lord your
[49:35] God in the
[49:37] wilderness so you know we use brother
[49:39] Dennis because we're using brother
[49:41] Dennis and so you can you can leave the
[49:44] church I know you're going to go down to
[49:46] some crazy bunch of people they don't
[49:48] even have 200 people in their Church no
[49:50] pip organ you know how much you like the
[49:52] pipe organ and if you if you want to go
[49:55] down there in the wilderness go right
[49:57] ahead be my
[49:59] guest amen you may sacrifice in the
[50:03] wilderness Only You shall not go do
[50:07] don't like don't get you know if you're
[50:11] thinking about giving up smoking and
[50:12] drinking don't don't don't get that
[50:15] fanatical because God don't
[50:18] care God doesn't care about any of that
[50:21] he he's that's a little bit too
[50:23] fanatical for
[50:25] you so
[50:29] yeah well look at what look at what
[50:31] Moses said
[50:33] behold I'm
[50:35] leaving and I'm taking brother Dennis
[50:38] with
[50:39] me and I will entreat the Lord that the
[50:42] Swarms of flies May depart from Pharaoh
[50:44] from his servants and from his people so
[50:46] he he he gives a blessing you know the
[50:49] devil God even blesses the devil because
[50:53] because you know the rain falls on the
[50:55] just and the unjust and and God will do
[50:58] that he even he he entreated
[51:02] Pharaoh but
[51:04] Pharaoh dealt
[51:08] deceitfully because Pharaoh is not
[51:10] willing to let you go amen he's not
[51:14] willing praise God so first he said you
[51:18] could just stay here then he says well
[51:20] you can go but don't go very far let's
[51:23] go over here to Exodus 10 because
[51:28] I'm on I'm on a
[51:31] mission and and verse
[51:34] eight it says and Moses and Aaron were
[51:37] brought again unto pharaoh and he said
[51:39] unto
[51:40] them uh
[51:42] okay go and serve the Lord your
[51:45] God
[51:48] but who's
[51:50] going I mean I'll let you know I'll make
[51:53] a deal with you I'll give your brother
[51:54] Dennis not your wife
[51:57] not your kids but I'll give your brother
[52:00] Dennis I'll make a deal with you I'll
[52:03] let you go but not your husband not your
[52:08] kids I just take you you yeah just go
[52:11] ahead go ahead but God don't play that
[52:15] game God doesn't work that
[52:18] way because I like what he says in verse
[52:20] n Moses said we will go with our young
[52:26] with our old with our sons with our
[52:30] daughters with our flocks with our herds
[52:34] we will go we're taking everything with
[52:36] us now here's a mistake that people make
[52:39] they think they can't go and follow God
[52:42] until they unpack everything that they
[52:44] have but that isn't what the scripture
[52:46] said the scripture said Come As You Are
[52:50] come buy of
[52:52] me amen by isav I know you're blun I
[52:56] know you're naked but that's okay come
[52:59] naked because I've got clothes I can
[53:03] clothe you come come all the come
[53:08] everybody come
[53:11] amen but not everybody that's in the
[53:13] church is
[53:15] Israel this is Jacob too because Jacob's
[53:19] counter to the
[53:20] promise
[53:23] amen amen
[53:27] so let's go down here to verse
[53:32] 24 it says and then
[53:35] Pharaoh called unto Moses and he
[53:39] said all right fine go serve the
[53:43] Lord take your wives take your families
[53:47] go ahead but I want you to leave your
[53:50] flocks and I want you to leave your
[53:53] herds I want you to leave all of them
[53:55] here now there's a signific ific there's
[53:57] a reason he wants you to leave them
[53:59] there because he wants you to believe in
[54:01] a trinitarian
[54:03] God he don't want you to go and take the
[54:08] flock he don't want you to take the Lamb
[54:10] of God with you no no no no no no no no
[54:13] no no no no no we don't believe in the
[54:15] blood anymore you leave you leave the
[54:18] sacrifice here don't bring the sacrifice
[54:21] of praise we got a rock band that'll
[54:23] knock you out and we can do rck really
[54:26] good Jesus Loves Me Jesus Loves Me Jesus
[54:29] Loves Me Jesus I'm Bor of blood and look
[54:31] I got crosses to prove
[54:33] it
[54:36] right God says not not where I'm taking
[54:40] my
[54:41] son praise
[54:44] God
[54:47] Amen and Moses
[54:51] said he says you know what devil you
[54:54] must give us also a sacrifice and a
[54:57] burnt offering and there's only one
[55:00] sacrifice and burnt offering that God
[55:02] will
[55:03] accept
[55:06] amen that we may sacrifice unto the Lord
[55:09] Our God our cattle also shall go with us
[55:12] there shall not leave a hoof be left
[55:14] behind and there we will take to serve
[55:17] the Lord Our God and we know not what we
[55:20] must we don't even know because you know
[55:23] all of us you know
[55:25] I I apologize
[55:27] but you know God doesn't tell us
[55:31] everything that's going to happen to us
[55:32] out in the wilderness he don't tell us
[55:34] all that stuff and just don't don't come
[55:37] to me and say well if you had known it
[55:39] was going to be like this would you have
[55:41] come I don't even hear that that
[55:43] argument isn't even in my head because
[55:45] it's not my seed the seed inside of me
[55:48] when I heard his voice I went and where
[55:51] he leads I go when he tells me to stop I
[55:54] stop I know I'm not looking for a way
[55:57] out I'm not looking for an easy way I'm
[56:00] not looking for that I don't want to go
[56:02] back to Egypt it was a rotten place even
[56:05] though I loved
[56:06] it it was not a good it didn't have a
[56:09] good ending everything that happened
[56:11] there just didn't work
[56:14] out amen praise the
[56:17] Lord so when we get there we don't even
[56:20] know look what he tells him he says he
[56:23] says we must take to serve the Lord Our
[56:25] God and we we know not with what we must
[56:30] serve the Lord until we get
[56:34] there and that's the problem you you you
[56:38] said oh well I'm going to go serve the
[56:40] Lord okay what are you doing I'm getting
[56:42] rid of all this stuff what are you
[56:44] getting rid of all that stuff for who
[56:45] told you to get rid of
[56:47] it well I gotta I got to get rid of that
[56:50] before I can serve God you don't even
[56:53] know how to serve God you don't even
[56:55] have the fantasy idea you can't even
[56:57] wash your hands
[56:59] right think about it this is serious
[57:03] stuff
[57:06] amen so he
[57:08] says and then and and this is before the
[57:12] even you know all of this conversation
[57:15] and all the examples and everything that
[57:17] I've showed you is before they were
[57:19] baptized in the water and before they
[57:22] got the Holy
[57:24] Ghost this all happened before
[57:27] people think that somehow you know
[57:29] brother Bruce I'd really like to serve
[57:31] God but you know I love my cigarettes so
[57:33] much that I don't care come on our
[57:35] church
[57:37] anyways that's what brother rham said he
[57:39] says come on this isn't this isn't the
[57:42] place of the Holy this is the place of
[57:44] the Unholy we're coming in here and get
[57:46] them cleaned up we can't clean it up if
[57:49] we leave them all on the outside oh no
[57:50] no you got to clean up
[57:52] everything because you don't know what
[57:54] God's going to require of you till we
[57:56] get there amen amen praise God and then
[58:01] in Exodus 11 I like Exodus 11 and the
[58:05] Lord said unto Moses verse one he says
[58:08] yet will I bring one more plague more
[58:10] upon pharaoh and upon Egypt and
[58:11] afterwards he will let you go from there
[58:14] when he shall let you go and he shall
[58:17] surely thrust you you know you know
[58:20] that's what well that's how the devil
[58:22] works the devil hangs on to you and
[58:25] hangs onto you till he finally sees he's
[58:28] lost and then he turns on you and pushes
[58:33] you
[58:35] out maybe they only do that to me I
[58:37] don't know but I tell you brother Mikey
[58:40] just it's
[58:41] the he will push you out but you know
[58:44] what's good about it before he pushes
[58:46] you out he gives you all his gold and
[58:47] silver and he and he he get they gave
[58:50] everything to him they gave everything
[58:56] you know
[58:58] before and there was a reason why he did
[59:00] that there was a reason that God didn't
[59:04] make you get rid of all your rock and
[59:06] roll and stuff and and he didn't make
[59:09] you give up all these things because
[59:12] God has a plan for
[59:17] you you know because when they got out
[59:19] into the into the desert and after they
[59:23] they crossed the Red Sea and they were
[59:25] all rejoicing and were having a great
[59:26] time now remember who was rejoicing on
[59:29] the seashore was it Jacob or was it
[59:33] Israel who was dancing who was beating
[59:37] the tambourine who was singing who was
[59:38] shouting because they went three days
[59:41] into the
[59:43] desert and God said
[59:46] now now you know God always has a plan
[59:50] God has a plan for all of us brother
[59:53] Marty he thinks you know God is horrible
[59:56] because he took his wife that's horrible
[59:59] kind of a God would do that what kind of
[1:00:01] a God would not answer your guys'
[1:00:03] prayers what kind of a God would have
[1:00:06] you go on and fast and then still not
[1:00:07] answer your prayers that's what the
[1:00:09] devil would tell
[1:00:11] you but you know you see when they got
[1:00:14] out there and the water was remember
[1:00:17] brother darl talking about the water
[1:00:18] being you couldn't drink it because it
[1:00:20] was better and Jacob jumped up and said
[1:00:24] you brought us out here to die and
[1:00:26] Israel said mm God's bigger than that
[1:00:30] let's go see what God's got let's go to
[1:00:32] the mouthpiece and see what God's got
[1:00:35] let's see what God's got hid here in
[1:00:37] This Bitter rotten place I
[1:00:39] mean the water is no good but let's go
[1:00:42] see what God says you see all of us we
[1:00:46] we fail on arm of Flesh we fall down we
[1:00:50] we things start to go bad and we

[1:01:50] next thing you know the Trials come and
[1:01:52] then they're jumping from Pillar To Post
[1:01:54] because the Lord never did did that for
[1:01:56] them in the first place
[1:02:00] but because God does all things
[1:02:04] well my God
[1:02:06] does oh I got
[1:02:09] testimonies I got testimonies but this
[1:02:12] ain't about me it's about the word of
[1:02:14] God it's about seeing that God took care
[1:02:19] I we
[1:02:21] need brother brandham in God in his word
[1:02:23] he says this is way back in 195 57 he
[1:02:26] says God doesn't tempt
[1:02:28] man God tries Men He tests them God
[1:02:33] cannot tempt you but God can test you
[1:02:37] and every son that cometh to God must be
[1:02:39] tested or child trained before he can be
[1:02:41] a son and if we can't stand chastisement
[1:02:44] the Bible said then we're going to
[1:02:45] become illegitimate children and not the
[1:02:47] children of God Amen cuz a child of God
[1:02:51] is born of God and he will stand the
[1:02:53] test anywhere anytime in any condition
[1:02:56] that's right a child that's born of God
[1:02:59] Amen praise the Lord he does not commit
[1:03:02] sin does not commit
[1:03:06] sin that's what the Bible
[1:03:09] says
[1:03:11] amen praise the
[1:03:14] Lord
[1:03:17] amen we got to read this then I can read
[1:03:19] the rest of the quotes here go to
[1:03:21] Deuteronomy
[1:03:24] 8 people sometimes they don't
[1:03:27] understand oh wait a minute you
[1:03:30] forgot what's the subject
[1:03:33] tonight a successful
[1:03:37] walk how will you have a successful walk
[1:03:41] if you're always looking to Jacob and
[1:03:43] not
[1:03:45] Israel
[1:03:47] amen
[1:03:50] amen this is this is I got this
[1:03:53] highlighted and I got all kinds of notes
[1:03:55] written in the flag Lea and everything
[1:03:56] else says 8 verse1 he says all the
[1:03:59] Commandments which I command thee this
[1:04:02] day shall You observe to do that you may
[1:04:06] live brother that is way too much for
[1:04:09] this frail Jacob flesh to
[1:04:14] handle because Jacob is gonna
[1:04:17] fail but Israel
[1:04:20] isn't you see Jacob and Israel was one
[1:04:24] guy that's what I like about this when I
[1:04:26] saw I said wait a minute Jacob and
[1:04:27] Israel's one
[1:04:29] guy and so are
[1:04:31] you this flesh out here God isn't even
[1:04:34] looking at it he's looking at the seed
[1:04:36] on the
[1:04:37] inside amen and the word on the inside
[1:04:40] he can do all the Commandments of
[1:04:42] God and he will live and multiply and go
[1:04:46] in and possess the land which the Lord
[1:04:49] swear unto your fathers and thou shalt
[1:04:52] remember all the way which the Lord thy
[1:04:55] God LED thee these 40 years in the
[1:04:58] wilderness
[1:05:00] first first you're way too
[1:05:03] proud Jacob Had a
[1:05:06] Brain Jacob was pretty
[1:05:09] smart he stole all the Laban sheep he he
[1:05:13] got all the cattle he he yeah but God
[1:05:16] didn't want him that like that when he
[1:05:19] wrestled with the Lord when he wrestled
[1:05:21] with the Lord he was a pretty strong guy
[1:05:22] because he had he had God and God said
[1:05:26] you know what if I'm going to Prevail
[1:05:28] I'm going to have to do something very
[1:05:30] serious and he popped his his hip out
[1:05:34] amen you see it
[1:05:38] amen and God did that he said he said I
[1:05:42] took you out look at what he did he took
[1:05:45] them to the bitter
[1:05:46] water you know I remember as a young
[1:05:49] believer as a young Christian I didn't
[1:05:51] know God I'd never been that way before
[1:05:54] I was raised as a presbyterian
[1:05:56] what they don't we you know we read the
[1:05:59] Bible but nobody believed
[1:06:02] it they read
[1:06:05] it I remember the first time I met God I
[1:06:08] told the Presbyterian preacher he came
[1:06:11] to see me and I said you know what
[1:06:12] Reverend Cole I said I got to tell you I
[1:06:13] says I learned one thing in underneath
[1:06:16] that car because I had a car fall on
[1:06:18] me I said I learned one thing when I
[1:06:21] when that car fell on me I said the
[1:06:24] Bible says I didn't even know the Bible
[1:06:26] said
[1:06:27] this the Bible says behold I stand at
[1:06:30] the door and knock If any man open the
[1:06:32] door I'll come in and sit down and Su
[1:06:34] with him and he will Su with me and I
[1:06:36] said now we can admit there's a God in
[1:06:40] this universe or we can keep the door
[1:06:41] shut and say there is no God but I'll
[1:06:44] tell you for sure God is not in the
[1:06:47] Presbyterian Church that's a direct
[1:06:50] quote from a sinner who was in
[1:06:53] Egypt you see Israel was on the inside
[1:06:56] already that elected seed you know
[1:06:59] brother brandom said he said you didn't
[1:07:01] get eternal life the night you got born
[1:07:03] he said if you ever had eternal life you
[1:07:06] had it from the beginning you had it at
[1:07:08] the end there is no end there's only an
[1:07:11] end for the devil and those that are
[1:07:13] going in the Lake of Fire but but Israel
[1:07:16] is my son and has eternal life praise
[1:07:20] the Lord
[1:07:21] amen he took him down there you know he
[1:07:24] he took them through the bitter water
[1:07:26] and then you know the CH children of
[1:07:30] Jacob while they were in Egypt they had
[1:07:32] 7-Eleven and Walmarts and Kroger and
[1:07:35] family fair and they they could go
[1:07:37] anytime they wanted but when they got
[1:07:39] out in the desert they had to
[1:07:41] learn they had to learn to trust the
[1:07:45] heavenly
[1:07:46] father they had to learn that all these
[1:07:50] blessings that you have God gave
[1:07:53] you they had learn that and what God was
[1:07:58] doing when he gave him the Mana and that
[1:08:00] he was separating Jacob from
[1:08:06] Israel amen they had to remember the
[1:08:10] Sabbath they had to remember to keep it
[1:08:13] holy you know God gave them all that
[1:08:16] gold and silver and everything else the
[1:08:18] Egyptians if they had not got the gold
[1:08:22] and the silver from the Egyptians they
[1:08:24] would have not have made the golden calf
[1:08:28] what would they have made it out of
[1:08:32] sand you see God let them leave with all
[1:08:36] of that to prove what was in their
[1:08:39] hearts we don't have to have somebody
[1:08:41] come and tell you what you know you got
[1:08:44] to do this gota do that everything else
[1:08:46] God will prove to
[1:08:47] you God will show you what you're look
[1:08:51] at what he says here in
[1:08:52] Deuteronomy he says I led thee these 40
[1:08:55] years ears in the wilderness to Humble
[1:08:57] thee to prove thee to know what was in
[1:09:01] thine
[1:09:03] heart whether thou would keep his
[1:09:06] Commandments or not God is omniscient
[1:09:10] omnipresent all knowing all powerful he
[1:09:13] knows what's in your heart do you know
[1:09:16] what's in your
[1:09:19] heart today you're serving the lord but
[1:09:21] next week you may
[1:09:23] not God will put put the pressure on you
[1:09:26] to find out what's in your heart and
[1:09:27] then you'll know what's in your
[1:09:29] heart and then you'll know and then
[1:09:32] you'll say I'm
[1:09:34] undone and you'll mean it you'll really
[1:09:38] mean it when you see that you can't even
[1:09:41] walk without God you can't breathe
[1:09:44] without God you can't you can't
[1:09:46] everything that I have God
[1:09:48] gave amen and that only comes from God
[1:09:52] proving that to Israel
[1:09:56] Jacob he don't well Jacob's
[1:09:58] happy brother brandham said Jacob has
[1:10:01] always got his hand on the money
[1:10:03] bag
[1:10:06] right the water from the rock they they
[1:10:09] made they made you see everywhere you go
[1:10:11] and if you read the whole book of Exodus
[1:10:13] and you read everything that I'm talking
[1:10:15] to you about and we had to make it
[1:10:18] short but you can see every time
[1:10:21] something went wrong Jacob raised up his
[1:10:24] head and said hey that ain't right
[1:10:26] hey but Israel said wonder what he's
[1:10:29] going to do now wonder how he's going to
[1:10:31] get us out of
[1:10:33] this wonder what he's got wonder what
[1:10:35] he's got next he's got such a big bag of
[1:10:38] tricks God's got all kinds of stuff in
[1:10:41] his bag he's got all kinds of
[1:10:43] Deliverance he's got all kinds of
[1:10:45] Miracles he's got all his his Bounty is
[1:10:48] wow Hallelujah God is God has got
[1:10:52] everything if we can just yield to him
[1:10:56] if we can just recognize what God is
[1:10:59] trying to do with us amen amen amen amen
[1:11:04] you think about it I was when I was
[1:11:06] telling Don about this earlier this week
[1:11:08] I said Don I said oh my I said look
[1:11:11] about it I said you know children of
[1:11:13] well not the children of Israel Jacob
[1:11:16] they all got to complaining about Moses
[1:11:19] then they got the back biting you know
[1:11:21] like we do right sometimes we don't like
[1:11:24] each other but you know
[1:11:25] oh that brother didn't shake my hand
[1:11:27] took my parking spot I told that not to
[1:11:29] do that guy was in the bathroom too long
[1:11:32] this was other things so you know what
[1:11:35] God did he sent fiery serpents in caused
[1:11:38] more division in the church well that
[1:11:40] seems awfully extreme but you know God
[1:11:43] did
[1:11:44] that and then Jacob got mad because now
[1:11:48] he's getting bit Israel said hey I got
[1:11:51] bit what do I do and he went to Moses
[1:11:55] and Moses said God Moses went to God
[1:11:57] said what do we do God says you know
[1:12:00] what let him
[1:12:01] alone let him let him back bite some
[1:12:04] more it's it'd be fine really that's
[1:12:07] what he told him John he said let him
[1:12:09] back bite some more he says but this is
[1:12:11] what I want you to do I want you to take
[1:12:13] a Brazen serpent I want you to put it on
[1:12:15] a pole and everyone that believes the
[1:12:18] word of God that is coming out of a
[1:12:21] Vindicated prophet's mouth will look and
[1:12:24] live
[1:12:26] he didn't take the snakes
[1:12:28] away he
[1:12:30] didn't there was Israel people there
[1:12:32] were the elect that got
[1:12:34] bit and you sometimes say oh how's this
[1:12:37] is this bad thing coming why why is this
[1:12:39] happen why is that happen because God's
[1:12:41] trying to form you into the image that's
[1:12:44] he's trying to form you into the
[1:12:47] image that's
[1:12:49] right let God form you
[1:12:52] amen amen if for everything in
[1:12:56] everything in the 40 years I asked Donna
[1:12:59] I said Donna you know I said I've been
[1:13:01] thinking about this I said I don't know
[1:13:02] where I got three million people come up
[1:13:04] out of Egypt
[1:13:05] right okay so they said the Bible says
[1:13:08] that e that Caleb and Joshua had a
[1:13:12] different Spirit right they were the
[1:13:14] only two that were going to go into the
[1:13:15] promised land right but they weren't the
[1:13:18] only two that went in the promised
[1:13:23] Lane there wasn't there was Joshua and
[1:13:27] Caleb and 12 tribes of
[1:13:31] Israel there was
[1:13:34] many all of those that generation that
[1:13:37] disbelieved God died off and believe it
[1:13:40] or not their
[1:13:44] offspring you mean Jacob's Offspring
[1:13:47] went into the promised land
[1:13:50] uh-huh
[1:13:53] uh-huh so Joshua and Caleb went into the
[1:13:56] promised land and God still had elect
[1:14:00] inside of Jacob that went into the
[1:14:02] promised
[1:14:04] land but there were people that went
[1:14:07] into the promised land that were
[1:14:10] unbelievers they just happened to grow
[1:14:11] up in the
[1:14:13] message they just happened to they could
[1:14:16] quote it they listen to the tapes just
[1:14:18] like everybody else but they weren't
[1:14:20] elect but how can you tell how can you
[1:14:23] tell who's elect and who's not well
[1:14:24] let's give a
[1:14:25] us let God put the thumb screws on them
[1:14:28] we'll find out whether they're Believers
[1:14:29] or not brother I'm telling you there
[1:14:33] ain't no I'm I ain't going nowhere this
[1:14:35] is where I'm
[1:14:37] at oh I wish I had the ability to grind
[1:14:39] that into the people's hearts God is
[1:14:42] looking for Tim tested
[1:14:45] Christians every son that cometh to God
[1:14:48] must be tried child train tested and you
[1:14:52] who jump from Pillar To Post and this to
[1:14:54] that and in and out how can God ever
[1:14:56] adopt you into his family or
[1:14:58] positionally place
[1:15:00] you so now think of that for a moment
[1:15:03] how can you be positionally placed when
[1:15:05] you will not stand still long enough for
[1:15:08] God to do
[1:15:09] it
[1:15:12] amen amen praise the
[1:15:17] Lord so he says when a son is Born Into
[1:15:20] the family he's a son at Birth is that
[1:15:23] right and brother said you see that's
[1:15:26] where the Pentecostal people jump the
[1:15:27] fence so I'm going to take that and
[1:15:29] we're going to apply it to what we heard
[1:15:32] tonight so Jacob God created him he was
[1:15:36] a son at
[1:15:38] Birth and you thought that when you were
[1:15:41] born again that settled it that was only
[1:15:44] the beginning that's right you are a son
[1:15:48] surely when you're born but when the son
[1:15:51] is born he is not an heir of all things
[1:15:56] yet because he has to go through testing
[1:16:00] trials to find out what's in his heart
[1:16:04] really to find out whether he'll stay
[1:16:06] with God come thick or thin high water
[1:16:10] low it's it's wonderful because God's
[1:16:12] already told us in the word that the
[1:16:14] flood comes I will walk with you when
[1:16:17] the fire comes it won't burn you I'll
[1:16:20] take care of you I'll take care of you
[1:16:23] amen praise the Lord
[1:16:26] when this son was born he wasn't heir of
[1:16:28] all things he had to go through testing
[1:16:29] trials to find out if he has the right
[1:16:32] type of son to fall air of all things
[1:16:34] and listen God's word said that every
[1:16:37] son that cometh to God must be first
[1:16:39] tried chastened child trained before it
[1:16:43] can be adopted into the
[1:16:46] family
[1:16:49] amen sometimes Believers are getting put
[1:16:51] to the test not sometimes every time for
[1:16:55] every son that cometh to God must be
[1:16:57] chasen tried child trained remember the
[1:17:00] trials the dusty roads the hot sun of
[1:17:03] persecution but the Loyalty of your
[1:17:05] heart beats that material till she is
[1:17:08] ready to go into the mold God's children
[1:17:11] is made up of they are made up correctly
[1:17:14] on his word for they are living examples
[1:17:17] and the word of God is living through
[1:17:20] them see the trial comes to shake you to
[1:17:23] put you to the very bottom
[1:17:25] to see whether you'll
[1:17:28] stand amen you want a successful life
[1:17:34] recognize who you are
[1:17:37] amen
[1:17:39] amen
[1:17:41] amen are you Jacob or are you
[1:17:46] Israel amen
[1:17:49] amen let's bow our heads for word of
[1:17:52] Prayer
[1:17:55] dear Lord
[1:17:57] Jesus Lord we see in the
[1:17:59] scriptures that even
[1:18:02] today there are still nuggets there's
[1:18:05] still things Lord that you want to get
[1:18:08] to
[1:18:09] us Lord that through the revelation of
[1:18:12] these things not just teaching but when
[1:18:15] it becomes part of
[1:18:17] us then Lord we'll stand strong and
[1:18:20] we'll stay with your
[1:18:21] word and I pray Lord that You' take the
[1:18:24] simple message
[1:18:27] father Lord even though when we look at
[1:18:29] the scriptures there in Roman we realize
[1:18:33] that we're not pharaoh and you didn't
[1:18:36] raise us up to destroy us you didn't
[1:18:39] bring us out of the world to kill us
[1:18:42] here you didn't do
[1:18:44] that you brought us here to be a
[1:18:48] reflection of the invisible
[1:18:51] God Moses had never seen God till he saw
[1:18:54] the burning
[1:18:55] Bush and then you stepped right into
[1:18:58] Moses
[1:19:00] because there's no way Moses could turn
[1:19:03] the water into blood no way he could
[1:19:06] pick up sand and turn it into flies no
[1:19:09] way he could call for frogs could not do
[1:19:11] it but God
[1:19:14] can God can do all those
[1:19:17] things and I can do all things in
[1:19:21] Christ amen who strengtheneth
[1:19:25] Lord when I'm weak then I'm going to say
[1:19:28] I'm
[1:19:29] strong Lord Jesus I just pray Lord that
[1:19:35] you will speak
[1:19:36] plainly to all of us forgive us of our
[1:19:40] sins and our slothful ways sometimes
[1:19:43] we're just weak we just we fall down we
[1:19:47] we don't know how to walk we we don't
[1:19:49] know how to live but Lord you know how
[1:19:52] to live you know how to walk you know
[1:19:53] how to you can teach us how to speak you
[1:19:56] can teach us when to keep our mouth shut
[1:19:58] you can you can show us how to love our
[1:20:00] neighbors you can show us how to love
[1:20:02] our enemies because we don't have the
[1:20:04] ability to do that Lord I just pray I
[1:20:09] just pray father you just take the
[1:20:10] simple message Father you'll make it one
[1:20:13] with us Lord let us meditate on these
[1:20:16] things we love
