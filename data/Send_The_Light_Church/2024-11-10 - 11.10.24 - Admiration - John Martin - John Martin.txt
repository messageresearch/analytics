his presence today amen how many believe God's hereen how many's come with let me just ask you this how many feels you've come with a good attitude amen I just I just feel it this morning I I feel I feel that uh good is overcoming evil amen amen amen God bless you let's turn in our Bibles to 2 Samuel chapter 23 2 Samuel chapter 23 what was that song Brother Bruce that we were singing right before the last song I Will Bless your name I will bless your name yes it's it's I look at this as as adoration I want to talk about adoration today and I I just don't think we can respect one another respect God too much amen but we can always come short of that amen let's look to God In Prayer it's good to see each one that has their Bibles and getting ready to read the word of God Amen Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity we call it an opportunity it's a great privilege to be in your house Lord to be in your presence to be the place that you said this is my house this is my house should be called a house of prayer and Lord we know that you've transferred that house inside of us and we know that you still want a a prayerful a prayerful house lord it's also good to be gathered together with brothers and sisters of light precious faith and God we thank you for the promise that you're here regardless of how we feel whether we feel whether our emotions are dictating one way or the other way Lord we know know by Your Word which cannot lie has never lied you're here am and you declared Lord to do exceedingly above all that we would ask or we think Lord we don't know what you have in store for us today we don't know what word that you exactly speak to our heart in a personal way in that in that way of intimate love but we ask today that you'd have preem as we open our heart to you we invite you to come in and and draw us to that inner chamber Lord amen we want to we want to see you there we want new life to come forth from us Lord break the bread of life to us now give us give us ears to hear what your spirit is saying we love you we praise you for these things now in Jesus Christ's name amen and I had a chance to be in Sunday school just a little bit and I i' asked the the the young ones the young adults the young our young our young adults um what what is it that we're supposed to did you bring what you're supposed to bring to church today and I asked him and one said he said uh when I asked what should we bring today he said our ears ears to hear and I really appreciated that one amen second Timothy chapter 23 we're going to start with verse number eight these be the names of the Mighty Men whom David had the taconite that sat in the seat Chief among the captains the same was a Dino the eite he lift up the spear against 800 and he slew at one time whom he slew imagine that man sing here today slew 800 people we would look at him and say wow right so adoration all right and after that was elazar the son of Dodo the Haight one of the three mighty men with David when they defied the Philistines that were there gathered together to battle and the men of Israel gone away he arose and smot the Philistines until his hand was weary and his hand it caved onto the sword in other words he just couldn't open his fingers to get it off and the Lord wrought a great victory that day and the people returned after him only to spoil after him was shemma the son of age the harar right and the Philistines were gathered together into a troop where was a piece of ground full of lentils and the people fled from the Philistines and he stood in the midst of the ground and defended it and slew the Philistines and the Lord wrought a great Victory and three of the 30 Chief went down and came to David in Harvest Time in the in the Harvest Time onto the cave of adulam and the troop of the Philistines pitched in the valley of uh reim and David was then in a hold and the Garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem and David longed and said oh that one would give me a drink of water The Well of Bethlehem which is by the gate and the three Mighty Men break through the host of the Philistines and Drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David nevertheless he would not drink thereof but poured it out unto the Lord and he said be it far from me oh Lord that I should do this is not this the blood of the men that went in Jeopardy of their lives therefore he would not drink it these things did these three Mighty Men amen God bless you you may be seated I'll say like this I want to be one of those Mighty Men I want to be just like them I want to be able to live to my potential I don't think there's anything sadder in life than God given a a a human being an opportunity to be what God had created him to be and that and he he does not believe to that potential and he lives below the standard that God has given him and allows the enemy to take over his life and to to bring it down to such a place that it's without the character of God Amen and I'll say it's like this we have to be willing to be Mighty Men and mighty women that are willing to tell the devil he has no place in our life not at all not in our mind our thoughts not in our goals because I have my focus is that I could come to the full potential that God had created me to be amen we've all planted bushes and trees and uh you know we've thrown grass seed down before we we wanted to see things grow there's nothing sadder when you put labor you buy things you plant things you fertilize you do all and it just it it it only grows a little bit and then stops it's a very disappointing thing amen I remember we I I bought this tree one time from um borines and it it was a like a um one of those yellow norways um that leaves are yellow all the time and I was putting it in a spot um and so I I took out you know some good ground or there was bad ground took out a good size of ground and I put top soil in there and I fertilized it I did all this work and I planted that tree and for about uh two years it blossomed it was like a a horse no I'm sorry this was it was two trees there uh and this one was a horse chestnut tree that I had planted there and I like the horse chestnut trees they were pink flowers and for two years it did it did well and I thought it was just going to be a beautiful tree on the hill there and then all of a sudden it just died and I thought it never really came to its a potential and it was so disappointing because God wanted that tree to bring him glory because he created that tree all the flowers the birds everything we see was created for him for his glory and I think when we don't come to our potential that we really are not bringing him the glory that he's really worthy of amen amen well here David's life was was it it felt to him like it was spiring downhill his life went from bad to worse King Saul Who David loved and David actually tried to heal his spirit and his soul with with playing music and just serving him he was nothing but good to King Saul yet King Saul wanted to kill him he just had had this jealousy about him and and and we understand that you know when you are truly truly walking with the Lord you have every gun out of hell pointed at you because the devil is trying to stop you and David had fled to this Cave of aulum to escape King Saul and his men and this cave became a refuge for David and the few men that stood with him this cave provided shelter and and protection from All the Troubles and the enemy that was uh coming at him have you ever been to a place that you just wanted to escape from your enemy you just wanted to go find a cave or just find a place that you just wanted to get away well I tell you David didn't have a full Army he didn't have the government at his hands that to protect him right so he just fled and he found this cave and this cave became a very special place and I'm G to tell you God met David in that cave God met David and the cave Psalms 275 says for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me and he shall lift me upon a He Shall Set me upon a rock right Psalm 17 keep me as the apple of thy eye hide me under the shadow of thy Wings amen David said in Psalm 61 from the end of the Earth will I cry when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I and I believe when David went in there he was looking for Refuge he was looking to find God he was looking for help with his situation Exodus 331 time you know this and the Lord said beh behold there is a place by me that thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my Glory passees by that I will put thee in the CFT of the Rock Amen and will cover thee with my hand while I pass by you talk about Refuge we're in the palm of the hands of Jesus Christ today and no man is able to pluck us out and we just got to have our confidence in God no matter what we're going through this cave became a great Clift in the rock for David and for his men David abandoned himself to do the will of God there I'll tell you when you're facing you ain't got nowhere to go you're willing to just give up things for God and this is where a place where David was God had put him in such a situation not just like Jesus Christ we know that he became squeezed right at Calvary but nothing but the the the Beauty and the the perfume of God came out I think what David when he he went through so many things so many more things than what we go through we think we got it bad we think we got it hard we think you know things are unfair you don't even realize what others have gone through I say that it's the truth and I'll tell you but I believe that God was bringing out the very best out of David amen am he turned loose of all his o his own ideas he let go of his strength he let go of his reasoning and he began to put more of his Trust into God and he found refuge and security and and and actually Deliverance in this place I believe he found the mercy of God in this place in this cave David wrote some of his most famous Psalms while he was hiding in this cave this was a place where God met him and in Psalms this was one of the Psalms I just want to read it it's in Psalms 142 if you want to write that down he says I will look on my right hand and behold but there was no man that was would know me Refuge failed me no man cared for my soul what a state to be in when nobody cares for your soul he says I Cried unto thee oh Lord I said Thou Art my refuge and my portion in the land of the living he found God there Psalms 52 or 57 he says I will cry unto God the most high unto God that performthe he was in the midst of nobody's with him everybody turns against him he still believed that God was going to take care of him be thou exalted oh God above the heavens let the glory be above let thy glory be above all the Earth my heart is fixed oh God my heart is fixed I will sing and give praise I will praise thee Oh Lord among the people I will sing unto the uh among I will sing unto thee among the Nations you know he just would would not allow the terrible things that had happened him I mean think about think about this if you knew there were people that were out to shoot you and kill you or you'd be thinking about the police right you'd be thinking about getting help some protection but I tell you David didn't have anywhere else to go to but the Lord and God sometimes puts us in positions like that to get our attention we got to rely on God for our lives amen he said for thy mercy is great unto the heaven and thy truth unto the clouds be thou exalted above oh God above the heavens and let thy glory be above all the earth I want I just want to ask you a question today when was the last time you were just down in the dumps but you looked to God and you started praising him like David I'll tell you there's something inside of the believer he cannot let go of God he knows where his salvation comes from he knows where his strength comes from he is not hanging on to the things of this world Hallelujah David had the ability to take a mess and straighten it out he had faith and he had confidence he was a born leader as you know true leaders are born leaders he he actually had to get his house out of order what do I mean by that he took about 400 men who were in debt who were distressed who were disoriented and he made them elite soldiers he got his house in order and David taught these men we know this that David taught these men the ways of the Lord and I'll just say it like this to the parents we need to get serious more serious the hour is late and I'm so thankful for the freedom that we have in our country today what a what a load's been lifted off of America but I'll say it like this we're in an hour Jesus is coming soon our kids need the Lord and we need to start teaching them we need to start bringing them up in the in more than ever the admonition of the Lord you can't give you can't give your children too much Christ and there were three of these elite soldiers that heard that David had a desire in the midst of this battle all that one would give me a drink of the water of The Well of Bethlehem which is by the gate that's all he did was Express a yearning for the well water amen I me I say today God sees your heart if you're hungering and thirsting for him he sees your desire these men had so much add admiration for David that they put their own lives into Jeopardy David didn't ask them to go David didn't say well you know you should be doing this I'm your king no there was respect amongst these mix fits indebted didn't know have anything they left King Saul but David taught them how to respect David taught them how to be respectful to one another to the place that just the knowing the very desire of those around you he they wanted to please sometimes we have to just shove something down their throat force it we have to bring fear upon a person just to get something we want and I'm telling you this is not the way of God they had so much respect for David that they put their lives in danger they fought through a Garrison Army and went 13 to 15 miles to get David a cup of cold water now if I said to you would you drive down you know to Grand Blank or flint and grab me something get me a couple W what they didn't have a car they didn't take a chariot they didn't have a the the the the train or the subway what they had was an enemy they had a fight through they had they had to Be watchful they had to be careful they had to be looking and it it takes about 3 to four hours to walk you know that many miles but imagine now you you just can't just walk but you had an enemy that wanted to kill you I don't know how long it took to get this but just walking there and back could have been an easy seven eight hours but to go ahead and have fights along the way to be watching that nobody's going to get you because you're the enemy and the enem is out there this was no TV show brother Dennis this was a real situation David said these men put their own lives into Jeopardy for if I could say it like this for a lousy cup of water can you imagine brother Marty somebody asking you can you get me a cup of water just helping somebody with a couple water I mean like what's the big deal just go to the drinking fountain you know where the water's at pour it out of the faucet to go ahead and sacrifice eight hours for somebody to give somebody a cup of water what is that telling you there was so much admiration and so much respect I know what I would have been saying I'm not going to go eight hours to help my kids get him a glass of water I believe we're living in an hour where respect is going down the tubes people are finding a reason not to be not to bring admiration to somebody this scripture of esteeming others better than themselves is something of old our if you you know we're all disgusted with this world are we not all disgusted about the things that are happening in this world but what is brought about this this Dre Queen this gay this this black only black lives matter and nothing else matters in the world and I'm not going to give any allegiance to this flag or anything about what is all that all that is is a disrespect it's a spirit of disrespect and it creeps into our churches it well creeps first into our home and then it creeps into the church because you're not taught here to disrespect you're taught to fight that Spirit but see this Spirit gets on us and then we forget to honor one another and these men literally it wasn't just taking you know 30 seconds out to say brother Ron I really appreciate you they took eight hours and jeopardized their life that's a very high degree of admiration don't you think a very high degree it wasn't it wasn't even be asked you know Jesus said if they asked you to go M go to right but it wasn't even asked h I can't imagine just having to fight through a battle there and back and make sure the water's kept safe it they didn't have plastic bottles I'm just I'm at all at these men I'm going to meet them one day we're going to meet them one day am we're going to meet them one day we're going to shake their hand and say I look up to you because you are a person that had respect sometimes we fight through 13 miles of devils just to get to The Well of God sometimes we got to pray we got to wait on the Lord we got to fight through demons but I'll tell you you just stay there and you wait God will come he will meet you it's his promise he that is a thirst I will give him of the wells of life right we got to remember there is a well for us that we can drink of and have the refreshing the strength the peace the power that God has for his children amen sometimes we let too many too many Devils come in we got to stay focused stay in prayer that's where we fight that's where we show God our respect come on now that's where you show God your respect is when you get on your knees fight the good fight of Faith lay hold of eternal life amen they that wait upon the Lord what do they get renewed strength well I'm going to try to get it some other way the devil has got a a lot of lures out there the only thing that's going to give us strength is Christ and I mean I appreciate fellowship and it's encouraging it is renewing but you know it don't last too much more than the time of Fellowship but when you have something that you can take with you when the fellowship is done and the trial start and there's still something inside of you that loves God that you just want to worship and praise him and respect him at all times now you got something that God has and that's God Jesus or speaking here Luke 18 Jesus spoke a parable unto this and that men ought to always pray and not to faint David spent a lot of time praying in that cave he said in Psalms 27 I had fainted unless I believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait I say on the Lord how many people just go home and do nothing just waiting for things to get better and things just don't get better because they're just waiting we need to wait on the Lord amen respect respect the Lord don't respect the couch The Lazy Boy respect the Lord wait on him John 737 in the last days that great day of the feast Jesus stood and cried If any man thirst let him come and drink and he that believeth on me as the scripture said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water that's a promise this spake he of the spirit which they that believe in him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because that Jesus was not yet glorified I'll just say it like this if you are missing the joy of the Lord today just get a drink say God fill me just touch me inside because Joy don't come from the outside that's happiness real Joy comes from the inside and it only comes from God it is a it is a fruit of the Holy Spirit love joy peace it's a fruit of God and look the Holy Ghost was given out on the day of Pentecost and it's here today it is free for anyone who says God I'm thirsty today I want more of you today because that's what it takes blessed is he that hungers and thirsts after righteousness he shall be filled there is a great Garrison in this age I'll say it is the spirit of leoda it's a Garrison it's an attitude of needing nothing you're lucky if you get this out of me it's Garrison Spirit of lukewarmness we have to fight through the enemy to get a cup of just fresh water from the spiritual well of Bethlehem amen Jesus said the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violent and the violent taketh it by force I'm just gonna me and God that's all I need he's he's all I need Amen Brother Bruce said he's the friend that sticketh closer than a brother amen you don't want to know because God said I'll never leave you and I'll never forsake you amen how many times have somebody said I'm going to be there for you and when you needed them they weren't there right right we can't depend on one another but you know we can respect we can respect you want to know what real respect is real respect is respecting a person that is not respecting you when you respect someone because they respect you that is not respect that's the same thing the publicans and the Pharisees do but when you respect somebody that is not respecting you that's called respect that's real admiration and that's where Christ is pointing us to that type of admiration one for another respect for one another you can't have too much but you can always and most certainly often have not enough I think we ought be jumping up and down saying not that I like it but that's the truth it's the truth that sets us free and we need the truth we need to have this God I want to be like you I I just want to be like you Lord I want to have this this respect that you have I think about this God condescended to Men of low state to this I am in debt to Jesus Christ today that I understand He Paid a Debt I couldn't pay but I am still in debt to him and that brings an a respect to God to God's house and and and my attitude towards his word and and the word that he brings to us and after this great sacrifice that the men of David did for David it looked like he was just being disrespectful to them because he took the cup and he poured it up you made me go eight hours 10 hours I don't know flight through I give up my I I could not even come back alive my life was in Jeopardy and you're taking this water and you're dumping it they didn't have that attitude no they didn't David did not feel worthy that someone would have so much respect and admiration for him that they would do this great sacrifice put their life in danger he says he uses these words that it was literally the the their own blood the sacrifice their own blood he says I'm not worthy of that and he took that water and he just dumped it out to the Lord amen this to me is such a remarkable story because did David ever get his water did the men ever fulfill what their desire was was to to just honor David respect him and and and give him this water but you know who got the glory out of both parties respecting it was God it was God he's the one that deserves us to respect one another to admire one another to esteem one another is for him we sit here as little Min judges thinking this person don't deserve to be respected it is not for you to decide who deserves to be respected or not it's up to you just to honor every human being sometimes we can't even find enough gumption I'll say it like this we don't have enough Gods sometimes to even respect one another another well you don't know what they did to me well I'll tell you if you spend a bunch of time brother Mike where's he at or some of you workers here you spent a lot of time make something for me and I just you know go bury it I I know what you're going to think you sisters you make me a good meal make sure it's a good one I mean you spend all this time I just take that meal and I just dump dump it outside I know what you're thinking never gonna do that for him again I can't believe how he treated me but if I did it because I wasn't worthy of it then you could understand he's respecting and honoring me I tell you I just say it like this Saints there's some growing up I think we could do I think there's some growing up we have to do David had much admiration for his men that he didn't feel worthy of their sacrifice and David's men had so much admiration uh for I'm sorry let me just say this again David's men has so much admiration for him that he they were willing to sacrifice their lives and when they David received that sacrifice he felt So Unworthy of their sacrifice that he says Lord I'm just giving it to you it wasn't wasted in other words I believe there's a great reward coming for David for doing that and I do believe this and when we get on the other side there's a great reward coming for those men you know that Jesus said not a cup of cold water given in his name would lose its reward I just say it like this we're missing out when God is not the center of the reason we respect one another we're missing out we're sitting here in this big this I call it little Earth sheeto thinking we got it all figured out and we're going to give respect to who we want to and when we want and and why we want and I'm the king I'm the queen I'm whatever we're without Christ that is not not the not Christ that is not the spirit of Christ that's the anointing of Christ we're reading what the spirit of God would do and God is calling all of us to be like him so it doesn't matter if you're a king or if you're a servant all of us should be having admiration and respect one for another does doesn't matter if for the head of the home or for the Caboose admiration one for another amen respect for one another God is no respector persons why should we be are we greater than God God became man to serve amen why shouldn't we serve man are we greater than God God washed the feet of his own disciples shouldn't we be washing the feet of those that are what we think are less than us amen are we greater than God see these things we see what God is but what are we come on I think there should be somebody that loves this word this morning Romans 15 verse1 we then that are strong how many you strong today let me see your hands keep them up there keep them up there I love it those of you that don't got your hand all right you are you put down your hands now I'm going to talk I'm going to talk talk let me those of you that are weak let me see your hands one two okay three all right so I'll say it like this you that raised your hands you that are not participating I'll see you in the office after the service so those of you that raised your hand first you have to you got a job to do we're going to read about it right is right here Romans 151 we then that are strong ought to Bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves have you ever just done something for somebody and after you did it they were they were like felt real good about what you did they didn't do nothing for you but you just felt so much better to me you can't outgive God because when you do it for somebody God just comes in and fills you with such strength so the one one way to really become strong is start esteeming others better than yourself take time to look at somebody and find something good to say remember that that old will woman uh that that she always always said something good never had anything negative to saying about anybody and some one of these boys were trying to uh trick her came to her and says well what do you think about the devil and she said I think he's a good adversary amen and I think that's the kind of the way we need to be we need to be such a positive mindset that we just don't have anything negative to think about why are we why we've lost respect why have we lost admiration why is it left us our homes our families why why because our minds became negative and that's the reason we ought to be meditating day and night in the word of God Amen reading listening getting in prayer and saying God I need to hear from you what this is really saying get serious with God just a lot of there's so many so-called Christians out in the world they don't even know God that's they know the Bible they can quote it they can go to church but they do not have a relationship come on we all we ought to be the most thankful people on the planet that God has come down and revealed to us what it really means to be a Christian it's something that happens in the inside of your heart your mind everything is God it's not a put on it's not some peacock feathers not just some sh at times the Bible says let every one of us please his neighbor for his good to edification for every for even Christ pleased not himself but as it is written the reproaches of them that reproach thee fell on me I'll say it like this if you're around somebody that all they do is they think about you that's toxic for your life come on you're around somebody that's doing nothing but serving you I am telling you that helps your life it's awful quiet I don't I I shouldn't be quiet I'm just speaking the truth God has not talk called us to be toxins we need to get our Waters purified am our thinking purified we ought to humble oursel and say this human being that God has created is much more worthy of respect that I want to give pride is nothing more than selfishness living for one own self that's the spirit of Pride not necessarily somebody say oh yeah I'm the greatest thing that's what most people think pride is but Pride could be somebody that doesn't hardly say a thing but is so selfish it's all about their will that's what pride is and you know the Bible says that God resists that and he gives grace to the humble humility is simply living selflessly humility is simply living selflessly we heard it's living for others that's the spirit of God Isaiah 57 for thus saith the high and lofty one that inhab eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place and I should say with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit so he dwells with the humble notice there's nothing in there about Pride but to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones let me just say it like this if we're not going to be humble why don't we just lift our hand say I'm on the other side I live on the other side oh some of us live on the Hallelujah side the glory landway but if we're going to walk with pride God's not really walking with us well brother John God said he'll never leave me there you know that's the truth he never will but the Bible never says you won't leave him in fact Jesus said you got to abide in the vine got to stay connected right got to Die daily crucify the flesh you know you got too many people out here with this idea about I'm saved once saved always saved nobody can taught me out of it no matter what I'm GNA do I'm saved it doesn't matter it's like can you give me just one scripture for that just one but you see that's the doctrine of the devil and when we're not in church you know what the devil does preaches to us every chance he can he's preaching you may not look be looking at a Bolton board or the TV or your phone but you know what you ever have driving down the road everything's fine all of a sudden there's this fly in your car the windows are up you can't get them out just bugs the tower out of you sometimes the devil just comes buzzing you just you want to roll down the window and get the get them out eternal life is not doing things for others I I wish I had about a thousand amens on that one eternal life is living your life for others big difference big it's your whole life your whole life is about others Jesus left his glory for you amen and in fact he's preparing a mansion for you today he's still living for you today he is still a friend that Stith closer than a brother he is still here to give us water when we want it if we can just have a love for him that desires him as much as he desires us we heard this that God wants to give us the Holy Ghost more than we can imagine sometimes we could just take it or leave it we've lost respect for God do you know when you come into church and you worship and you hunger for him you know what you're saying I wor I respect you God it it isn't just sitting quietly in the sanctuary that that is a respect it really is and I I I I say I tip my hat off to those that stay in the sanctuary through the service I I I respect that I respect you for that and may it just continue to grow because I believe God is calling us higher amen God is calling us Mark chapter 10 we need to we need to hurry because you know there's a song I used to listen to when I was in the world it says we've only just begun Mark chap 10:42 but Jesus called them called them to him and saith unto him you know that they which are accounted to rule over the Gentiles exercise lordship over for them and their great ones exercise Authority upon them so I'm I'm just going to be honest with you has I'm going to talk to the men here the fathers for a second have you ever in your home you know pushed your Authority on your family thank you I we got one honest person two that is in the wrong spirit and we're going to find out what the right Spirit and the wrong Spirit here the wrong spirit is not you to remind your family who the boss is they don't need to be reminded they need to see it lived and we're going to find out how you live it right here Jesus teaching us but so shall it not be among you you're different but whosoever will be great among you shall be your minister you know and I I see when I see sisters and uh an and Cheryl and and just whever I see people bringing food to the table I think of them as a server right we go out to eat and waiters and waitresses come they they serve so when I I I think of somebody that's ministering is actually helping the other person so if you're going to be a minister it does doesn't mean you know you stand at home on your couch and you say I am the boss no you serve and you know what you know what the problem is Sister Jee with a lot of men nowadays they don't know how to serve they don't ought to serve it's like they need to get that serving for dummies book out because it's something that they don't feel is necessary only thing that only the Revelation that needs to be in the home is on the head and you listen and they've missed the very gospel that Jesus preached verse 44 and whosoever of you shall be the chiefest shall be the servant of all for even the son of man came not to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many if the son of man came not to be ministered unto then what are we here for why do we expect everybody to do stuff for us I don't understand that Spirit are we greater than God like we deserve to be ministered on too aren't we called to minister to others all right say Amen so we can move on Amen I mean if you want to be here all day I'll just take my time Philippians chapter 2:7 Jesus said but made himself of no reputation took upon him the form of a servant and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the Cross so if Jesus had to do this are we greater than God no we're still called to serve one another amen everyone has a spirit inside of them we ought to have the spirit that wants to serve we ought to have the spirit that wants to respect and give admiration and to love one another that's the spirit that should be living in our Tabernacle can you imagine brother Dennis if I said well God lives in Me God lives in me but I'm gonna go ahead and and act like a devil now now what are you going to believe are you going to believe that I'm just quoting the Bible and God said he lives in me or are you going to believe the life that the spirit is manifesting am so I'm telling you Saints we need a spirit to serve to love I know I I'd like to put every one of us in a room and just you have a bunch of rooms and we go from room to room and we talk to one another and in that room you have to find five things that you admire about the person you're staring at you know it would be hard for some of us it really would it's like uh uh uh yeah I like the outfits you're wearing um I've never seen shoes like those we would struggle in finding something to say good about one another and you want to know why that is because we don't practice it we don't practice it we don't practice the serving it's like not necessary in our Christianity it's really Antichrist did you know that it's literally Antichrist to be all about you get off yourself we sing that song just forget about yourself esteem others better than yourself that's the spirit that should be living in US why is there fighting arguing debating we got to just ask the question where is the spirit of the Living God Among Us where's the god of Elijah where's the god that wants to be glorified in our homes and be glorified in how we talk to one another you know I cannot stop Bob from yelling at me I can't stop him from treating me like a piece of garbage but you know what I can treat him with utmost respect because his Spirit that's in him is not in me that's right but I know that devil that's in him wants to jump on me but greater is he that's in me amen than he that's in there just make a choice I'm not going to do that it's a choice when you feel you have to prove to Bob where he's wrong then the that's when that devil can reason you into that same spirit and then you'll just go back and forth right it's truth I mean hey look we've all experienced it I I'll just say like this I am speaking from experience we've all fallen into the Trap right but the thing is time to grow up we're not ignorant of the devil's devices it's time that we just look at Bob bow our head pray say something good try to break that Spirit you know you want to do something good soft answer gives turns away WRA that's right right amen you're trying to help a bad atmosphere in the home put the apron on go help go help your wife amen sisters bad situation going on with your husband go go ahead G up yourself get over down I'm here to help what do you want me to do maybe only thing you can't do is pray you go pray that time you pray with all your heart and you believe but I believe in changing our homes I believe it happens when we get serious about changing our spirit our attitudes our own lives you can't change a home without changing yourself you can sit there all day long and wish that everybody else was better and then when they get better then maybe you'll try but you know what you ain't fit for the kingdom of God it's when you humble yourself and you be you you begin to do what God wants you to do in the midst of your problems that you bring a respect to the home and that respect seems to just filter out to one another and before you know it the atmosphere just calms down you know they may not be jumping up and saying glory to God but I'll tell you what you'll just snap that devil because the devil can't do nothing unless he's got a vessel to work through he really can't Romans 12:10 we're going to have to skip a lot but you're going to get the message in your heart anyways right Romans 1210 be kindly affectionate one to another with a brotherly love in fact that Spirit has to be honoring in honor in honor prefer one another here we go now we got to put all this this hard work and when we're going to see somebody shake their hand talk talk to them I actually have to I have to honor I have to find something to honor you know the thing is it doesn't matter what evil you all would ever do to me not that you would hopefully that part is not being recorded but let me just say this you have done so much for me you have prayed so much for me you have loved me you have respected me so much if you never did another thing I would always honor you I would always prefer you it shouldn't be hard to be kindly affectionate one towards another with What Love in honor preferring one another not slothful in business fervent in spirit serving the lord I'll say it's time that we give up or belittling one another disrespecting one another defra ing one another 1 Corinthians 12:21 I just want to go through a few of these scriptures because we're kind of like a body and and I look at David and his men were so tight they just they respected one another they had different roles right it wasn't David that went and got it but they played different roles but they were just United they they loved one another there was respect they admiration this is how our home should be this is how our church should be this is how our marriages should be this is how things should be amen the eye cannot say unto the hand I have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet I have no need of you notice in other words there's no respect but for some reason we have this idea that our actions have often said I don't need you you know I'm just going to I'm just going to tally out of the church I already don't need them come on it's awful quiet you know what I've got the whole day in my hand I've Got The Look we may not say those words but we need to show one another that we need them especially if they're weaker especially if they're weaker it's our job amen as we treat one another as we don't need them or we're better off without them but we we need them we don't want a a selfish attitude nay much more verse 22 those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary much more the feeble members you know what they the Bible just put me or those of us that are strong underneath them in that scripture God put us at our place brother Ron and that's where we need to be yes amen and those members of the body which we think we think to be less honorable upon these we bestow more abundant honor and our comly parts have more abundant comeliness the people we think that are unpleasant to look at or unpleasant to be around it's those people who have we think they haven't accepted our standards living up to our are those people are the people that we need to honor not because they're not caring as much as you but because they need you there's difference they need you okay has anybody ever gotten a cut before how about you brother s you ever been cut you ever been cut at the Martin's house Martin shop with this church okay so what happens when you you get hurt you cut yourself does not the rest of the body say hey we got to do something about this situation here we don't say you know I don't know what's wrong with you you put your hand in the wrong spot you got cut and that's you you deal with it no we don't we take our other hand we wash it out we get the Band-Aids sometimes we have to put that Icy Hot Stuff on our back we help the part that is not doing as much as we like it to be doing amen sometimes we just we don't look at one another with a spirit of helping a spirit of AD admiration I mean I can show you right here I'm cut there but that doesn't mean I I I need to bestow more honor I need to bestow more attention it it needs me right now the problem is we see one another's got problems I deal it oh God's got to deal with him yeah it does God in you God and you's got to deal with it see the the problem is we're missing God we're trying to be Christian oh well brother John you're going to say I don't got God I'm gonna say don't try to make it with how much God you do got that's what I'm saying deeper deeper higher higher more more press here's the thing if we all had the attitude when we when we come to church every day and in our life we live this in our home that we have attained but we're pressing towards it I say God I'll meet you there I'll meet you there let me ask you I are we past time or do I still got like 20 minutes what time is it I mean Annie help me I but what time am I supposed to be out of here what 11:30 we're ped we're ped that's how much I am so much into my message I cannot even figure out how long I'm supposed to preach that that is I I you can see I need prayer all uh what is that called when that comes in you start forgetting you guys were talking about that earlier let's stand together oh my oh my I can't believe I didn't get through through this well maybe if it would be the will of the lord we may continue we may continue amen I don't know I for just a moment I lost I lost sight there but praise the Lord how many feels that God is really dealing with you amen right you know and here's the big I say the biggest thing do you do you want to deal with God yes that that's what's so important that that you want to go in the direction that you want to be like Jesus that because that's all all we preached on was was who God is that's right we didn't we didn't preach anybody else or anything else or my ideas it was just taking from the scripture if we read the scripture with a desire God show me something in here that you want me to see we we we'll see admiration and respect because that's what we're looking for amen let's just bow our heads and a word of prayer and hold our desire before the Lord Heavenly Father Lord my my hands are lifted and joined together with my brothers and sisters this morning my heart is united with their hearts my desires United with their desires and my prayer is uniting with their prayers right now Lord Lord we want to we want to be in your image and we know your image is is one of respect you never you never demanded Judas to get out of the discipleship you never you're a gentleman and you've you've always found good things in US Lord you're you're you are recognized by the Christian world that you are a good God and it's your goodness that leads us to repentance and Lord I'm asking you today that you would help turn our lives around For Your Glory that Lord that church would not be over when we leave the building today but that you would still Rule and reign in your church in our hearts may we hear your voice may we sing praises to you may we offer the sacrifice of praise continually Lord I believe that if we could just try to practice worshiping you and praising you more that we'd find less time to listen to the thoughts that would be discouraging about others I ask God In The Name of Jesus Christ that you bless our homes you take control of every spirit in our home that's trying to take it over God we want you to rule and reign in our home we give you our lives we made a decision years ago to serve you Lord we're standing right there today let come what may we're going to fight the good fight of Faith Lord I pray for every believer in this building today you know their heart you know their situation you know exactly what's on there right now and there's that desire I want to turn around I really mean business with you God I pray that you would give them the strength to do that you'd meet them God that you would bless them with the power of the Holy Ghost as they put into practice Lord even today searching working very hard working diligently as if they had to travel eight hours to find something good to keep saying to one another may they do it Lord may they do it and may you reward them as they offer the sacrifice to you Lord I pray that you would bless them abundantly father we commit Our Lives to you as individuals as our homes and as a church as your as your wife Lord we commit oursel to you make us more like you that we're ready for that day when the Rapture takes place we'll give you all the honor and all the praise for these things we pray now in Jesus Christ's name amen amen oh I love him because he first love
