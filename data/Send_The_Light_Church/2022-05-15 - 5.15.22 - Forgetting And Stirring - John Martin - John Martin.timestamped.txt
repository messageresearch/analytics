[34:36] the sun in the spring we've been looking
[34:39] forward

[35:05] amen just one verse here uh saint john
[35:07] chapter 14 verse number 26
[35:12] but the comforter
[35:13] which is the holy ghost whom the father
[35:17] will send in my name
[35:19] he shall teach you all things
[35:22] and bring all things to your remembrance
[35:25] whatsoever i have said unto you
[35:28] god bless you maybe seated may the lord
[35:33] add the blessings to this just one
[35:35] scripture
[35:39] we want to entitle this message
[35:43] forgetting and stirring
[35:49] we may read a lot of things
[35:51] that god has spoken
[35:53] and not really quite understand what
[35:56] we're reading it we ever do that read
[35:57] the bible read something what does that
[35:58] mean or what is god saying to us
[36:02] but it is the purpose of the holy ghost
[36:04] to lead each and every one of us and
[36:06] guide each and every one of us into all
[36:08] truth
[36:10] he shall teach us all things and bring
[36:13] all things
[36:14] to our remembrance
[36:16] whatsoever he has said
[36:21] now just because we have heard the truth
[36:23] and we've said amen
[36:26] and we said i believe
[36:29] it doesn't mean that we're really
[36:31] established in the word
[36:34] this is an important important thing
[36:38] there are many who know the truth but
[36:40] they don't obey it
[36:43] and if you don't obey it
[36:45] you're not established
[36:47] and if you're not established you won't
[36:49] obey it
[36:53] if you're established you'll not only be
[36:55] faithful to come to church
[36:57] but you'll be faithful to the word of
[36:59] god in your homes
[37:02] in your lives on your jobs
[37:05] oftentimes the holy ghost has to bring
[37:07] things to our remembrance
[37:10] and the reason why is because he's
[37:11] trying to establish us
[37:14] not just hear it not just amen not just
[37:17] that we agree but to establish this in
[37:19] what he's trying to say
[37:21] now we know the bible says believe in
[37:23] the lord you shall be established
[37:27] but the problem is
[37:30] our
[37:31] definition of belief in god's is
[37:33] different
[37:38] the devils believe but they're not
[37:40] established
[37:41] a lot of people say they believe but
[37:42] they're not established and the proof of
[37:45] being established is a faithfulness to
[37:47] the word of god
[37:49] and i believe he's calling us
[37:51] all higher and higher because each time
[37:53] we come to church
[37:55] each time we listen to a tape each time
[37:57] we're
[37:58] we're we're
[38:00] getting down on our knees god is
[38:01] speaking things to us there's a there's
[38:04] a relationship there and god is wanting
[38:06] to establish this in them and to become
[38:08] faithful with them
[38:10] good to see brother stay in here
[38:12] amen
[38:15] sometimes
[38:16] we have a a tendency
[38:19] to just
[38:21] forget things god help us
[38:25] and there are things that that god wants
[38:27] us to forget and there's things that god
[38:29] wants us to remember
[38:32] and at the same time that the devil is
[38:34] trying to accomplish the direct opposite
[38:37] that serpent he's he he he wants to keep
[38:41] reminding us of things that god wants us
[38:43] to forget
[38:46] and he wants to distract us
[38:48] from the things that god wants us to
[38:50] remember
[38:51] so there's a a battle that's
[38:53] continuously transpiring in our minds
[38:57] in certain things that the devil wants
[38:59] to keep reminding us we just need to
[39:01] forget right
[39:03] and and the certain things that the
[39:05] devil wants us to forget god wants to
[39:07] stir our minds up
[39:08] and to bring it to our remember so we
[39:10] don't forget so
[39:12] we're humans
[39:14] and we need to be reminded amen
[39:17] i'm grateful for the way that god has
[39:19] provided us
[39:21] to know where we're really at with god
[39:25] the prophet taught us that we come here
[39:27] to the house of the lord to find out
[39:30] where we're really at because see if we
[39:32] believe in the word jesus christ is the
[39:34] word the realness of the word it is a
[39:37] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[39:39] the heart how many times we've been to
[39:41] church we heard something said and we
[39:43] have this thought come into our head who
[39:45] told him
[39:47] how did he know how did he catch a
[39:50] we got to give confidence to the word
[39:55] if we don't focus on the word and if we
[39:57] put
[39:59] we allow man to inject there then every
[40:01] time we come to church we're going to be
[40:02] questioning
[40:07] now we all have personal lives and walks
[40:10] where we believe god is leading us
[40:14] i'll just say perfectly
[40:18] but the only true way for us to know is
[40:21] to come to church
[40:24] and if we really want to know
[40:27] god will confirm
[40:30] he'll he'll lead us
[40:32] this is the vehicle that god has chosen
[40:34] for the local body
[40:37] the prophet never said your leadership
[40:40] will be confirmed by listening to the
[40:42] tapes
[40:44] don't stay home and listen to the tapes
[40:47] or our favorite songs or our ministers
[40:50] our friends or our dreams
[40:53] now it's not that god won't use those
[40:55] things because he can and he will
[40:58] but god sent his mouthpiece to confirm
[41:00] the channel in which god would choose
[41:05] to tell us where we're standing with him
[41:10] and if we really get a revelation of
[41:12] this
[41:15] that we can come
[41:17] to find out where we're standing with
[41:19] god we would have
[41:21] a greater hunger to get to church
[41:24] it would no longer be i'm coming to
[41:26] church just to get what i want
[41:31] you know how it feels when your children
[41:33] come to you and the majority time they
[41:36] come to you is always about what they
[41:38] want
[41:42] i know the difference i have some
[41:43] children that would never ask me for a
[41:44] thing i don't care how old they get
[41:47] and i've got some
[41:49] as soon as you're talking to them you
[41:51] know it's about to come
[41:54] and there's a difference in the feeling
[41:58] and when we come to church and all we
[42:00] want to do is please the lord that
[42:01] touches the heart of god i just want to
[42:03] find out if i'm pleasing you if i'm in
[42:05] the right channel here lord
[42:11] i remember many times sitting in church
[42:15] and feeling like am i the only one
[42:17] that's getting this message
[42:22] just things were quiet
[42:24] not saying amen
[42:27] trying to send a message right now
[42:31] and i would be sitting in the back and i
[42:33] would just be weeping
[42:35] tears would be coming
[42:39] and i would just be wondering what is
[42:41] going on
[42:47] it wasn't that god
[42:49] was there
[42:50] just for me
[42:53] i was there just for god
[42:57] it wasn't like i was just special to god
[43:00] it was i was that god was special to me
[43:03] it was my attitude it was where i was at
[43:07] it is what would it was my attitude
[43:11] it wasn't that the original manner
[43:13] didn't get uh
[43:15] common i just didn't let it get common
[43:18] to me
[43:21] see it's your attitude that really makes
[43:23] a difference
[43:25] no wonder david could say one thing i've
[43:26] desired of the lord and that why i seek
[43:29] after all the days of my life because
[43:32] there's something more there to it
[43:34] a lot of people are going to church and
[43:36] somebody coming to our are are
[43:39] building the other day and they were
[43:40] just telling me to go into a certain
[43:42] church and it's a church with a lot of
[43:44] lights and a lot of entertainment
[43:47] and sure i introduced them to the to our
[43:49] church but i said if if the word is not
[43:53] what's important to you in your
[43:54] relationship above entertainment the
[43:57] church is not really a good fit for you
[44:00] but the people are looking for for so
[44:03] much
[44:04] for themselves
[44:06] and are not interested in their souls
[44:09] prospering how many like that message
[44:11] last service
[44:12] psalms 27 verse 3 let's read that though
[44:15] a host should a camp against me ever
[44:17] feel that way
[44:19] you're all alone
[44:21] my heart shall not fear though war
[44:23] should rise up against me in this will i
[44:26] be confident
[44:28] one thing i've had desired of the lord
[44:30] that why seek after that i may dwell in
[44:33] the house of the lord all the days of my
[44:35] life to behold the beauty of the lord
[44:37] and to inquire
[44:38] in his temple
[44:41] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[44:43] me in his pavilion in the secret place
[44:45] of his tabernacle shall he hide me he
[44:47] shall set me up upon a rock
[44:52] and now shall my head be lifted above my
[44:55] enemies round about me therefore will i
[44:58] offer in his tabernacle
[45:01] sacrifices of joy i was saying yeah i
[45:04] will sing praises unto the lord
[45:07] we are in the will of the lord praising
[45:11] him in this place
[45:15] so we need to be faithful to not only
[45:17] being at church
[45:21] but
[45:22] when we're here to be listening
[45:25] to the word
[45:26] personally
[45:28] imagine for a moment of course we like
[45:29] as many people as we could be in church
[45:31] it kind of helps the atmosphere
[45:34] but for a moment imagine you are the
[45:36] only person sitting in the church
[45:39] and you're hearing the word do you have
[45:41] enough faith to believe god is speaking
[45:43] to you
[45:46] because that's what god's looking at
[45:48] that's how personal it needs to be
[45:51] and if we all we can all have that
[45:54] we can all have that did you know we
[45:56] could all be praying at the same time
[45:59] and yet being one mind and one accord
[46:01] with the holy ghost
[46:03] it's us focusing in the lord amen
[46:08] i believe that we miss him more times
[46:10] than we realize
[46:12] these stirring up and reminders are
[46:14] really the working of the holy ghost
[46:17] there's a lot of important things in
[46:19] god's word that we we need to be
[46:21] reminded of jesus said man shall not
[46:24] live by bread alone but by every word
[46:25] that proceedeth out of the mouth of god
[46:28] turn with me if you would to juke
[46:30] juke
[46:31] it's really not in the bible it's jude
[46:35] jude
[46:39] and even if i didn't say anything you
[46:41] would just probably think i was
[46:42] listening
[46:43] as a foreign minister or something like
[46:45] that you would know what it meant
[46:48] jude 1 verse 3 beloved
[46:51] when i gave all diligence
[46:53] to write unto you of the common
[46:55] salvation
[46:57] it was needful for me to write unto you
[46:59] and to exhort you that you should
[47:00] earnestly contend for the faith which
[47:03] was once delivered unto the saints
[47:06] i just imagine
[47:09] i was a visiting minister today and i
[47:11] came to church here and i was
[47:12] ministering on this verse of scriptures
[47:17] and i said it is needful for me to write
[47:19] about you just about the common
[47:21] salvation
[47:24] well
[47:25] you would think
[47:26] that you're much beyond this
[47:30] right
[47:31] that you've already got common salvation
[47:36] that you're interested in hearing some
[47:37] new things that's why you come to church
[47:40] that you have some other interest
[47:44] but it wasn't just jude sharing his
[47:46] thoughts now for the sunday's message it
[47:49] was really the holy ghost in jude that
[47:52] saw a need
[47:54] it was an important message
[47:56] it wasn't a mystery or new revelation or
[47:58] some exciting message
[48:00] but yet it was the holy ghost bringing
[48:02] to the remembrance
[48:04] of something that was very important
[48:13] jude saw a need to contend for the
[48:17] original
[48:18] faith and why that was is because
[48:22] satan was concocting new faiths
[48:25] new beliefs
[48:27] and he could see that there was a spirit
[48:30] that was starting a new faith to arise
[48:33] and this simply wasn't we're going to
[48:35] prove it in the scripture to come
[48:37] where believers could do their own will
[48:39] now
[48:42] they could do what they want to do and
[48:43] still claim their salvation
[48:46] and it grieved you to the point
[48:48] that he found it needful that he
[48:51] would write and exhort and i'll tell you
[48:54] this this this is to us
[48:57] this word is for me
[48:59] to bring the original faith back to our
[49:02] remembrance
[49:05] verse 4 for there are certain men
[49:09] crept in unawares
[49:12] we could just say they were spirits
[49:14] but the crept are not aware who
[49:17] uh but but men
[49:18] gravitate to spirits who were before
[49:20] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[49:23] men turning the grace of god into
[49:25] lascivious and denying the only lord god
[49:28] and our lord jesus christ now we think
[49:31] whoa i've never seen nothing like that
[49:33] all my life brother john
[49:35] right
[49:37] wrong
[49:38] wrong wrong wrong
[49:42] turning grace
[49:44] of our lord god into lascivious now that
[49:47] word lascivious means wantonness
[49:50] turning
[49:52] grace
[49:53] into wantonness
[49:57] when you turn grace into wanton
[50:00] you're denying he is the only lord of
[50:03] your life
[50:06] because if he isn't lord of everything
[50:08] that he's not lord at all
[50:10] so it's not denying that there wasn't
[50:12] jesus christ
[50:14] that he was the lord of glory but is he
[50:17] your lord
[50:20] and that grace of god needs to stay the
[50:22] grace of god
[50:24] not turning into
[50:26] i want
[50:29] see that the attitude that the devil
[50:31] wants to to bring about the the bride of
[50:34] christ is i'm saved
[50:37] i've been set free i can do what i want
[50:38] to do now because i'm saved
[50:43] and that's not the right attitude
[50:45] see that's not the original faith
[50:48] the original faith causes the saved to
[50:52] sell out lock stock and barrel
[50:55] that's what it'll do
[51:00] to make jesus the lord of all your life
[51:02] that's what the original faith will do
[51:07] remember
[51:09] that most subtle beast brought a
[51:11] different faith
[51:13] to eve
[51:15] the original
[51:16] was stay with the word
[51:19] but
[51:21] satan came along crept in unawares
[51:26] and offered you can still do what you
[51:28] want to do and be accepted
[51:34] believers love talking about god's
[51:36] saving grace
[51:38] and we should
[51:39] can you say amen
[51:41] but what should follow the grace of god
[51:43] from common salvation
[51:46] or what should the grace of god turn us
[51:49] into
[51:52] a scripture here in first corinthians 6
[51:54] 19 it should turn us into servants i
[51:56] believe
[51:58] first corinthians 6 19 what know ye not
[52:01] that your body
[52:03] is the temple of the holy ghost which is
[52:05] in you
[52:07] which ye have of god and look you are
[52:10] not your own anymore
[52:16] for your bought with the price
[52:22] therefore glorify god in your body and
[52:23] your spirit which are god's how many has
[52:26] ever bought a new car or used car
[52:29] how many has ever taken your old car
[52:31] into the dealer at the same time
[52:35] okay so
[52:36] you that have done that
[52:41] when you drive your car away whether
[52:43] it's new or used that's your car now
[52:47] you don't call the dealer up a week
[52:49] later and say that's my car
[52:52] i want it back
[52:56] and a lot of times that's what the devil
[52:58] wants believers to think
[53:02] that you're saved now the most important
[53:04] thing is all done now you just go on and
[53:06] do what you want to do in life
[53:10] but that's only going to bring about a
[53:12] great disappointment
[53:17] grace should turn every believer into a
[53:20] servant of god an ambassador for his
[53:22] kingdom
[53:24] second corinthians 5 17 therefore if any
[53:26] man be in christ he's a new creature old
[53:28] things are passed away behold all things
[53:30] have become new and all things are of
[53:32] god
[53:34] now i'll tell you when i look at my life
[53:35] i can honestly say that all things are
[53:38] not of god
[53:40] if i'm being honest of course i could be
[53:42] here be deceptive and tell you all
[53:44] things in my life are
[53:45] of god
[53:47] and i'd be lying to my teeth
[53:50] and that and if i ever said that i
[53:52] expect you to stand up and walk out of
[53:53] here
[53:56] but i'm a sinner saved by grace
[53:59] growing in the grace the knowledge of
[54:01] our lord jesus christ
[54:05] all things are of god who's reconciled
[54:08] us to what himself
[54:12] himself you go buy a car it's for you
[54:17] the dealer
[54:19] can't come and if you paid for your car
[54:22] the dealer can't come and get the car
[54:23] back from you
[54:25] it's paid for you've got the deed
[54:28] well god paid for our salvation he's got
[54:30] the deed
[54:31] we can't go back in there and steal it
[54:33] and say well i'm going to kind of do
[54:34] what i want to do
[54:37] we belong to god
[54:40] so he's reconciled to himself and he's
[54:42] also given us a responsibility a
[54:45] ministry let's get back to jude here
[54:47] verse four and there are uh for there
[54:50] are certain crep certain men crept in
[54:52] unawares who before ordained to this
[54:54] condemnation ungodly men turning the
[54:55] grace of god into lasciviousness and
[54:57] denying the only lord god and our lord
[54:59] jesus christ i will
[55:02] therefore put you in
[55:04] remembrance though you once knew this
[55:08] how that the lord having saved the
[55:10] people of the land of egypt afterwards
[55:12] he destroyed them that believe not
[55:15] now their own testimony would be that
[55:17] they believe
[55:21] that god delivered them they rejoiced
[55:23] they they saw the water come out of the
[55:25] rock the manifold they they looked to
[55:27] the
[55:28] the uh
[55:29] the pole and they were healed they were
[55:31] had many testimonies like my shoes never
[55:34] wore out they believed
[55:36] but god said they didn't believe because
[55:39] the moment we stop believing in all the
[55:41] word then we don't believe
[55:45] amen that's why we need to continue to
[55:47] believe all the word
[55:52] you cannot start doing what you want to
[55:54] do after you've been saved
[55:58] and i'm exhorting you that you should
[56:00] earnestly contend for the faith that was
[56:02] once delivered to the saints
[56:05] now the original faith was we're more
[56:06] than able to take the lamb
[56:11] the original faith for us is to go on
[56:14] and receive the power of god in our life
[56:17] to go on to perfection amen
[56:21] to lay everything else aside until we
[56:23] get perfect love amen
[56:27] lay
[56:28] everything aside
[56:31] and get perfect love
[56:33] now brother brandon wasn't just giving
[56:35] us an option here
[56:38] nor was this just brother branham's
[56:39] opinion
[56:41] it was the word of god being spoken to
[56:43] us
[56:45] and sometimes
[56:47] we can have an attitude of what i call
[56:49] selective hearing
[56:53] only wanting to hear about selective
[56:56] things
[56:57] so we can develop an automatic turn off
[57:00] valve inside of our conscious when we
[57:02] don't quite hear what we want to hear
[57:08] because we don't want to follow through
[57:09] with what god says
[57:12] hebrews 13 17. we must remember this
[57:15] hebrews 13 17 obey them
[57:18] that have the rule
[57:20] over you nobody likes to be rude
[57:23] right
[57:24] how many times have we said you ain't
[57:26] gonna tell me what to do
[57:29] huh
[57:30] how many times have we given this silent
[57:31] treatment not just to our husbands but
[57:34] to our wives or to our friends
[57:37] to our neighbors
[57:38] to our brother and sister because of
[57:41] something
[57:43] obey them that have the rule for you and
[57:45] submit yourselves
[57:48] for they watch over your souls
[57:50] as they must give an account that they
[57:53] may do it with joy not with grief for it
[57:55] is unprofitable for you
[58:00] i read this quote
[58:02] not because i'm your pastor but
[58:04] i want you to remember
[58:07] our prophet
[58:11] in the message respects
[58:14] brother branson says you say well
[58:16] maybe they were the unconverted type
[58:18] well maybe they were
[58:20] they were a mixed multitude
[58:23] went with them that's true so speaking
[58:25] of that
[58:26] the egyptians when they or the children
[58:28] of israel when they came out of egypt he
[58:30] says but i want to bring another thing
[58:32] into your remembrance
[58:34] if god sent the messenger and vindicated
[58:38] by
[58:38] the signs that he was the messenger sent
[58:41] from god
[58:42] then it was up to them to obey the
[58:45] messenger
[58:47] exactly
[58:48] they must obey the messenger and have
[58:51] respect to that messenger
[58:54] he said look at joshua and caleb
[58:56] they stayed
[58:58] right by his side
[59:01] yes sir
[59:03] whatever moses was in
[59:05] they ran it to
[59:08] whether moses was right
[59:10] or wrong
[59:12] they stayed right with him
[59:17] didn't matter see because they know that
[59:20] was god's messenger just because some we
[59:23] know somebody's god's messenger doesn't
[59:25] make them perfect
[59:27] doesn't make them sinless it doesn't no
[59:31] no we're
[59:32] any time we put somebody above
[59:35] being a human say by grace
[59:40] all you're doing is setting up
[59:42] to not
[59:43] follow or obey the word when it's spoken
[59:46] through that person
[59:48] that's all you're doing
[59:50] see satan wants you to kind of lift
[59:52] somebody up
[59:54] and then god's gonna let you know that
[59:55] that man's gonna fall
[1:00:02] so it isn't important
[1:00:05] that we know everything's perfect
[1:00:09] that that happened in the ministry of
[1:00:11] fourth malachi 4 5 and 6. but you've got
[1:00:14] to have a revelation of the messenger of
[1:00:17] this hour
[1:00:18] and you as joshua like joshua and caleb
[1:00:21] you got to stay with that word amen stay
[1:00:24] right with that word right or wrong you
[1:00:26] stay with it amen
[1:00:32] we understand that there was a mixed
[1:00:34] multitude that came out of egypt and the
[1:00:36] majority of god's people in the church
[1:00:39] were only interested now catch this in
[1:00:42] salvation
[1:00:44] they wanted freedom from slavery freedom
[1:00:47] from pharaoh freedom from their
[1:00:50] taskmasters and being in bondage
[1:00:52] they were not interested in their
[1:00:55] god-given responsibility to move forward
[1:01:00] can you say amen
[1:01:02] god god's promise wasn't just to come
[1:01:05] out of egypt
[1:01:06] god's promise was to take a land that's
[1:01:09] flowing with milk and honey
[1:01:12] they were not as interested in a
[1:01:14] relationship with god they just wanted
[1:01:16] to to to make sure that they were saved
[1:01:19] if this is what they had to do to get
[1:01:21] saved they repent and get baptized they
[1:01:23] were saved and that's the main thing
[1:01:27] now that's i'm going to say the majority
[1:01:29] that came out of egypt was like that
[1:01:34] i want to say that if we as believers
[1:01:37] remain only interested in salvation
[1:01:39] we're going to come short of a rapture
[1:01:45] you go on claiming all you want to claim
[1:01:48] that you're the elect
[1:01:50] but if you don't move forward how can
[1:01:53] that be the elect
[1:01:56] why did god end up destroying the people
[1:01:58] of egypt after he saved them
[1:02:02] their main concern was being saved from
[1:02:05] their current situation how many times
[1:02:07] we want to be saved from our current
[1:02:09] situation and we get more desperate and
[1:02:11] we we try harder and then after uh we we
[1:02:14] get relief it seems like we let our foot
[1:02:17] off the gas
[1:02:18] are you with me
[1:02:21] they weren't concerned about building a
[1:02:23] relationship where they could trust god
[1:02:26] for the entire promise now the entire
[1:02:29] promise for us is that we will be in his
[1:02:31] image
[1:02:37] and until we let go
[1:02:40] god can't have his way
[1:02:44] we can't come in this no matter just
[1:02:46] sitting around waiting for god to do it
[1:02:48] the answer the answer is us believing
[1:02:50] that god will do it and we got a part to
[1:02:52] play between now and then
[1:02:56] they neglected to remember their
[1:02:58] responsibility to keep moving forward
[1:03:02] they didn't like coming to church and
[1:03:04] being stirred up over and over
[1:03:07] they didn't like hearing about the
[1:03:09] original promise
[1:03:12] that there's still a land that floweth
[1:03:14] with milk and honey that they're still a
[1:03:17] love to where you can love your enemies
[1:03:20] truly love them that there is a a peace
[1:03:22] that passeth all understanding when
[1:03:24] you're in the middle of test and child
[1:03:26] there is a joy when you lay down your
[1:03:28] life for others
[1:03:30] they they weren't interested in hearing
[1:03:32] that all the time they were just
[1:03:35] interested
[1:03:36] in what they were interested in
[1:03:40] second peter chapter one second peter
[1:03:42] chapter one verse one
[1:03:46] there's a reason that god
[1:03:48] is reminding us
[1:03:50] of his word
[1:03:53] he wants us to stay right with the word
[1:03:55] don't deviate from it
[1:03:58] simon
[1:03:59] peter a servant and an apostle of jesus
[1:04:02] christ
[1:04:03] to them that have obtained light
[1:04:05] precious faith so this is to you and i
[1:04:08] in this room
[1:04:11] and those that are live streaming
[1:04:12] and those that are into
[1:04:14] they're christians
[1:04:16] but i'm just saying don't count yourself
[1:04:18] out of this
[1:04:19] then you will miss the whole thing while
[1:04:20] we're talking
[1:04:22] with us through the righteousness of god
[1:04:24] and our savior jesus christ grace and
[1:04:28] peace be multiplied unto you now how
[1:04:30] does it happen
[1:04:31] to the knowledge of god
[1:04:34] grace and peace be multiplied how many
[1:04:35] wants more grace
[1:04:37] how many wants more peace just multiply
[1:04:40] it well it's through the knowledge of
[1:04:42] god so when we're coming to church we're
[1:04:44] we're hearing the truth this is to help
[1:04:46] multiply grace and peace in our life
[1:04:49] and of jesus christ our lord according
[1:04:51] to his divine power
[1:04:53] have given unto us all things that
[1:04:56] pertaineth on to life and godliness and
[1:04:58] here it goes again
[1:05:00] through the knowledge of him
[1:05:02] that have called us to glory and virtue
[1:05:05] whereby are given un to us exceeding
[1:05:08] great precious promises that by these we
[1:05:11] that he might be partakers of the divine
[1:05:13] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:05:14] that is in the world through lust
[1:05:18] now we came out of egypt with precious
[1:05:20] promises
[1:05:22] we came out of the world with precious
[1:05:24] promises and he has called us unto
[1:05:27] virtue and glory
[1:05:30] so even though we're saved
[1:05:33] to light precious faith we've been
[1:05:35] called to something higher
[1:05:38] are you with me there's something more
[1:05:41] god never saved us in order just to get
[1:05:44] us to escape from hell and continue to
[1:05:47] just do our own will in life
[1:05:52] are you with me salvation is just the
[1:05:54] first step now we need to go on to
[1:05:56] perfection
[1:05:57] and god has called us to this perfect
[1:05:59] love
[1:06:00] but if we come short of it like i said
[1:06:02] we're going to miss the rapture
[1:06:06] i presently i kind of i'm a jealous type
[1:06:08] of a guy
[1:06:10] i am
[1:06:12] and
[1:06:13] the very thought
[1:06:15] that i'm sleeping for a thousand years
[1:06:21] while the bride is up with him
[1:06:24] having a honeymoon
[1:06:25] i just get so jealous of that thought
[1:06:28] are you with me
[1:06:30] i don't want to be caught down i don't
[1:06:32] want to be a foolish virgin
[1:06:35] i want to be so filled with god
[1:06:39] these uh virtues
[1:06:41] all that god has for me i want every bit
[1:06:43] of it
[1:06:47] so here's the the steps
[1:06:50] that we must take as
[1:06:52] what we're being called to what we're
[1:06:53] elected to and besides this giving all
[1:06:56] diligence add to your
[1:06:59] faith virtue
[1:07:01] and to virtue knowledge into knowledge
[1:07:03] temperance and to temperance patience
[1:07:05] and to patience godliness and to
[1:07:07] godliness brother kindness and to
[1:07:08] brotherly kindness charity and that's a
[1:07:11] lot of adding
[1:07:14] you remember how it was in school and
[1:07:16] two plus two was four
[1:07:19] and when you got that right you felt
[1:07:20] good then when you get
[1:07:22] a little bit
[1:07:25] they start giving you six numbers to add
[1:07:27] together so these six numbers plus and
[1:07:28] it became harder
[1:07:31] well when we look in god's word there's
[1:07:33] a lot of things that need to be added to
[1:07:34] our life but it's up to us to get
[1:07:36] interested in them to know that's what
[1:07:38] we've been called to
[1:07:42] for if these things be in you and abound
[1:07:44] they make you that you shouldn't either
[1:07:45] be barren or unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:07:49] of our lord jesus now notice
[1:07:51] here it is again speaking of that
[1:07:53] knowledge so this knowledge is not head
[1:07:56] knowledge
[1:07:57] because head knowledge doesn't give me
[1:07:59] patience
[1:08:01] it doesn't give me uh a joy or godliness
[1:08:04] or virtue
[1:08:06] not that knowledge up here
[1:08:10] it's here
[1:08:13] it's when i want
[1:08:14] to die out so much let go of my life so
[1:08:18] much that i'm interested in pursuing and
[1:08:21] adding something to my life that's not
[1:08:23] there
[1:08:27] we got a part to play
[1:08:30] but he that lack these
[1:08:33] things is blind cannot see it far off
[1:08:35] and has forgotten
[1:08:37] that he was purged from his old sins
[1:08:42] hmm that's a terrible state to be in
[1:08:45] don't you think
[1:08:47] the very fact that a believer
[1:08:49] remains
[1:08:50] concerned uh that a believer's main
[1:08:53] concern is just salvation
[1:08:55] without growing in these things
[1:08:59] will not only make them barren and
[1:09:00] unfruitful
[1:09:02] but the bible says here that he's blind
[1:09:04] he cannot see afar off and he's
[1:09:05] forgotten that he was even purged
[1:09:08] from his
[1:09:09] sins he's forgotten about calvary
[1:09:12] i want you to think about this when you
[1:09:14] forget about calvary you forget about
[1:09:17] who owned you
[1:09:19] who bought you
[1:09:21] that you're a servant
[1:09:23] that's why you just can't just stay
[1:09:25] focused i'm saved and say that's the
[1:09:26] main thing no the main thing is you're
[1:09:28] adding you're adding you're adding
[1:09:30] you're growing
[1:09:31] that it's on your heart it's on your
[1:09:33] mind there's an increase in your life
[1:09:37] don't let the the devil hoodwink
[1:09:40] us into thinking that everything's okay
[1:09:42] just because we're saved
[1:09:45] we as the bride have been called to a
[1:09:47] higher calling
[1:09:50] it's to spend that thousand years with
[1:09:52] him
[1:09:53] it's to ruin reign with him
[1:09:56] it's to be sitting next to him
[1:09:58] it's it's it's to a place where he'll
[1:10:01] say this is my beloved wife
[1:10:06] this is my wife
[1:10:10] remember there was the other church that
[1:10:12] was claiming to be his wife
[1:10:16] they were dancing to the wrong music
[1:10:20] they were interested in things that were
[1:10:22] appealing to their flesh
[1:10:25] and not the prosperity of their souls
[1:10:28] verse 10 wherefore the rather brethren
[1:10:32] give diligence to make your calling an
[1:10:34] election sure for if you do these things
[1:10:36] you shall never fall for soul and
[1:10:38] entrance shall be ministered unto you
[1:10:40] abundantly into everlasting kingdom of
[1:10:42] our lord and savior
[1:10:44] oh here we go
[1:10:46] wherefore
[1:10:47] i will not be
[1:10:50] negligent
[1:10:51] to put you
[1:10:53] always in remembrance of these things
[1:10:57] though ye once
[1:11:00] though ye know them and be established
[1:11:03] in the present truth so we might think
[1:11:06] this is like
[1:11:07] you know why are we hearing this
[1:11:11] why are we hearing this we we already
[1:11:13] know
[1:11:14] that we need to
[1:11:16] go on to the statue of a perfect man
[1:11:20] but we need it so much in the forefront
[1:11:23] of our memory that we're actually
[1:11:24] working about we're concerned about we
[1:11:26] spend time praying about it we're
[1:11:28] pressing in we want what was lacking in
[1:11:31] our life
[1:11:33] i don't even i don't this is the truth i
[1:11:36] don't want to be a hundred percent on
[1:11:39] all of them except one thing and say god
[1:11:41] look look at these hundred look i'm so
[1:11:43] 100 over here
[1:11:45] because i need to be complete
[1:11:47] it'd be it'd be better if you were 80 on
[1:11:50] all of them
[1:11:51] you catch what i'm saying and you're
[1:11:53] pressing towards it
[1:11:55] it's it's a spirit and it's an attitude
[1:11:57] you don't see it in this world because
[1:11:59] the world is lukewarm
[1:12:01] the the church members in the church
[1:12:04] they're they're fine where they're at
[1:12:06] they have no vision they they they
[1:12:08] they're blind they cannot see afar off
[1:12:10] they can't see that god has called them
[1:12:12] to be just like him
[1:12:14] [Music]
[1:12:16] god help us
[1:12:18] amen
[1:12:21] i will put you always in remembrance of
[1:12:24] these things he was i'll tell you
[1:12:26] he was a good pastor
[1:12:29] under the direct leadership of the holy
[1:12:31] ghost verse 13 yay i think it meet as
[1:12:35] long as i'm alive
[1:12:36] as long as my soul is in this body
[1:12:40] to stir you up by putting you in
[1:12:44] remembrance
[1:12:46] knowing that any time i could die
[1:12:50] put off this my tabernacle of course we
[1:12:52] don't die the soul don't die but these
[1:12:55] bodies even as our lord jesus christ
[1:12:57] have showed me
[1:12:59] moreover i will endeavor that ye may be
[1:13:02] able
[1:13:03] after my deceased
[1:13:05] to have these things always in
[1:13:08] remembrance
[1:13:10] this must have been important
[1:13:12] this this this mindset of adding and
[1:13:15] adding and adding and growing and
[1:13:17] growing
[1:13:18] until you come to the statue of a
[1:13:20] perfect man
[1:13:23] and not just be swallowed up
[1:13:25] in unsaved
[1:13:27] or that i'm bride
[1:13:31] but to be adding
[1:13:33] don't be satisfied with just being saved
[1:13:37] god is stirring our minds to keep adding
[1:13:41] what are we adding god's nature to our
[1:13:42] lives
[1:13:44] now that was the original
[1:13:46] calling in the original election for us
[1:13:51] to be the bride
[1:13:52] that have made herself ready not just
[1:13:54] say bride
[1:13:56] eventually
[1:13:57] she has to get to the place where she
[1:13:59] has made herself ready
[1:14:01] so to claim to be bride is good for old
[1:14:03] kid for the start
[1:14:05] but after a while there needs to be
[1:14:07] fruit
[1:14:08] that we're ready
[1:14:10] i was like what brother marty said that
[1:14:12] you know jesus said be ready
[1:14:15] be ready
[1:14:17] but to remain ready
[1:14:19] to remain ready that means you got to
[1:14:21] war off the the the distractions and the
[1:14:24] temptations and everything that the
[1:14:25] devil is throwing at us to get us off
[1:14:28] track
[1:14:30] salvation doesn't make you ready for a
[1:14:32] rapture
[1:14:34] but what will god's divine nature
[1:14:36] that's why we need to keep adding
[1:14:39] we've got to stay in the word
[1:14:41] stay in the message of the hour stay in
[1:14:43] church keep reading keep listening keep
[1:14:46] yourself stirred up keep yourself in the
[1:14:48] love of god keep in the spirit walk in
[1:14:51] the spirit live in the spirit
[1:14:56] we've got to keep the word of god in our
[1:14:59] hearts and our minds david said in
[1:15:01] psalms 119 verse 11 thy word have i hid
[1:15:04] in my heart that i may not sin against
[1:15:06] thee
[1:15:10] and you can see
[1:15:12] what happened to david you could see
[1:15:13] what happened to abraham you can see
[1:15:16] what happened
[1:15:17] to you
[1:15:20] and why and how does it happen
[1:15:23] how did it happen to me
[1:15:25] is when i didn't hide god's word in my
[1:15:27] heart
[1:15:28] it's how important
[1:15:30] to keep that word there in your mind in
[1:15:32] your thoughts
[1:15:33] just keep it up here we know we
[1:15:35] understand we can always say it is there
[1:15:38] but we need to keep it up here
[1:15:41] right as a man thinketh in his heart so
[1:15:45] busy
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:47] not just the knowledge of the truth but
[1:15:49] the the the activeness of the brain
[1:15:52] functioning
[1:15:55] we don't want to be satisfied with just
[1:15:56] hearing it but we want to move forward
[1:15:59] into the manifestation of it
[1:16:01] i believe there's a lot of baptized
[1:16:04] believers that have deceived himself
[1:16:07] by just hearing the word by just
[1:16:09] commenting and hearing
[1:16:11] just hearing will deceive you
[1:16:15] and you no nobody likes a deceiver
[1:16:19] nobody wants to be talking to somebody
[1:16:21] that's trying to trick him
[1:16:23] do you ever have somebody try to trick
[1:16:24] you into something
[1:16:26] buy something
[1:16:30] i mean we just want to cut them off
[1:16:34] but the devil pulled fast one by the
[1:16:36] believer
[1:16:38] to the one that
[1:16:40] is okay with hearing the word
[1:16:43] but not doing it
[1:16:45] the bible says he deceives himself not
[1:16:47] the devil deceives you but he deceives
[1:16:49] himself in other words the devil's got
[1:16:51] us to think that we're going to be okay
[1:16:53] as long as we know
[1:16:58] first corinthians 15 verse 1.
[1:17:02] it wasn't too long ago i was coming out
[1:17:04] of church and
[1:17:07] i don't know what it was but brother
[1:17:09] johnson said something so i just quoted
[1:17:11] this this verse to him
[1:17:15] moreover brethren i declare unto you the
[1:17:17] gospel which i preached unto you
[1:17:20] which also you've received and wherein
[1:17:22] you stand
[1:17:23] by which also you are saved
[1:17:27] if
[1:17:29] you keep in memory what i preached unto
[1:17:32] you unless you believed in vain
[1:17:38] moreover brethren there's more
[1:17:41] to
[1:17:43] the gospel then what meets the eye if we
[1:17:45] can say it like this
[1:17:48] these brethren they heard the gospel
[1:17:50] preached they had received it they were
[1:17:52] standing in it
[1:17:54] and this gospel
[1:17:57] is salvation
[1:18:01] but we've got to keep in memory
[1:18:05] all the word
[1:18:09] because that's what the children of
[1:18:11] israel who came out of egypt did not do
[1:18:16] they didn't keep in their memory
[1:18:17] everything that was preached
[1:18:19] so even though they could say we're
[1:18:21] standing out look at my shoes
[1:18:23] they could like here's the wealth
[1:18:25] revival
[1:18:26] type thing the holy spirit was amongst
[1:18:28] them
[1:18:30] but they did not continue to move
[1:18:32] forward
[1:18:33] and i'll say it like this where you know
[1:18:35] we're talking about
[1:18:36] churches we're talking about history
[1:18:38] we're talking about things that have
[1:18:39] happened in the bible but really what
[1:18:40] we're talking about is our relationship
[1:18:42] with god that's what we're really
[1:18:44] talking about here
[1:18:47] you can see why the holy ghost wants to
[1:18:50] stir our minds and bring all things to
[1:18:52] our remembrance
[1:18:54] if the devil sees an open door to get us
[1:18:57] lifted up in pride
[1:19:00] you know what he'll do
[1:19:01] he'll remind us of all of our victories
[1:19:06] as if we're kind of special
[1:19:08] you know
[1:19:09] the devil loves reminding us of how
[1:19:12] perfect we are
[1:19:15] how great we seem to act
[1:19:18] what we've achieved or what we've
[1:19:19] attained
[1:19:21] or how much god has used us
[1:19:24] or how much truth we have or or that
[1:19:26] we're in the message of the hour we know
[1:19:28] the mysteries
[1:19:31] but remember those things
[1:19:35] remembering those things all the time
[1:19:37] only opens a door
[1:19:41] for the devil
[1:19:42] to distract the believer
[1:19:47] you know what do i need to pay attention
[1:19:49] to
[1:19:51] what he's trying to show me when
[1:19:53] i've got this
[1:19:55] sold up in my bag i've got all this
[1:19:56] history of of of all these great things
[1:20:00] i'm just gonna focus on this
[1:20:04] hmm
[1:20:05] it can keep the believer from doing what
[1:20:08] he presently should be doing what he's
[1:20:10] called to do
[1:20:14] i mean let's face it god
[1:20:17] uses some people everybody wasn't a
[1:20:19] moses everybody wasn't a brother branham
[1:20:23] everybody wasn't a timothy everybody
[1:20:25] wasn't a jude you know we're not all
[1:20:27] supposed to be somebody else we're
[1:20:29] supposed to be who we are but what we
[1:20:31] need to be doing is growing in the
[1:20:33] calling where he's called us to
[1:20:38] now here's the apostle paul with i'll
[1:20:41] say like this a a perfect attitude in in
[1:20:45] philippians chapter 3 verse 12.
[1:20:48] and this is something we all can have
[1:20:50] it's not a gift
[1:20:52] it's a victory
[1:20:55] god is not going to give how many times
[1:20:57] you ever had a bad attitude just can't
[1:20:58] seem to snap out of it
[1:21:02] and you try to put a song on try to
[1:21:04] somebody give you some encouragement
[1:21:09] david had to encourage himself in the
[1:21:10] lord sometimes
[1:21:12] it's not a gift
[1:21:15] philippians chapter 3 verse 12 not as
[1:21:16] though i've already attained
[1:21:18] either already perfect
[1:21:22] but i follow after
[1:21:24] if that i might apprehend that which
[1:21:26] also i am apprehended of jesus christ
[1:21:29] brethren i count not myself to have
[1:21:31] apprehended but this one thing i do i'm
[1:21:33] forgetting those things which are
[1:21:37] behind
[1:21:40] we we just let him go it doesn't matter
[1:21:44] it really doesn't matter what i've done
[1:21:47] in my life it just doesn't
[1:21:50] the past is past
[1:21:53] god never said i was that i was
[1:21:56] he said i am that i am
[1:21:59] i'm a present help in a time of need god
[1:22:01] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:22:03] so paul having this revelation he says
[1:22:06] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:22:08] and reaching forth
[1:22:09] unto those things which are before
[1:22:11] i press toward the mark
[1:22:15] i'm not there yet you know when you're
[1:22:16] pressing that's telling me you're not
[1:22:18] there yet for the prize of the high
[1:22:20] calling of of god in christ jesus that
[1:22:24] nature of god living inside of him
[1:22:27] he could still see that there was things
[1:22:29] missing
[1:22:31] oh i just love that
[1:22:33] a humble servant of god wroting wrote 14
[1:22:36] books of the bible
[1:22:38] could say he had revelations more than
[1:22:40] others but he he didn't
[1:22:42] talk about his greatness
[1:22:46] he forgot about him he says i'm going to
[1:22:48] glory i'm going to glory and how many
[1:22:50] times i was whipped and killed and
[1:22:52] stoned and shipwrecked and been used and
[1:22:55] abused by believers
[1:22:58] if i'm going to glory i'm going to glory
[1:23:00] in that
[1:23:02] but i'm going to forget all this because
[1:23:04] if there's anything good in us it's of
[1:23:06] god and who are we to break about
[1:23:08] something god did through us
[1:23:10] god could have used anybody
[1:23:12] but he chose to use you
[1:23:15] so give him the glory
[1:23:17] amen
[1:23:19] there
[1:23:20] let us therefore as many as be
[1:23:23] perfect
[1:23:25] be thus what
[1:23:27] minded
[1:23:28] it's a way that you think
[1:23:31] and if any of you don't think like this
[1:23:34] god shall reveal even this unto you
[1:23:39] i'm so glad
[1:23:41] god
[1:23:42] has power to speak to our hearts today
[1:23:47] there are certain things that god wants
[1:23:49] us to forget
[1:23:53] don't hold on to things that will entice
[1:23:55] you to be lifted up
[1:23:59] i want you to forget them
[1:24:01] husband just between you and god
[1:24:05] i know they're they're really neat to
[1:24:07] think about
[1:24:10] when you think about that special thing
[1:24:11] you did
[1:24:13] it's like
[1:24:14] that's so
[1:24:15] that's so neat
[1:24:17] i just want to tell everybody
[1:24:20] why not
[1:24:21] share jesus with somebody
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:25] why not just get down on your knees get
[1:24:28] your hands dirty
[1:24:30] and help somebody
[1:24:36] we need to maintain a perfect attitude
[1:24:39] of humility
[1:24:41] and that attitude will keep you pressing
[1:24:43] for more of the nature of jesus christ
[1:24:49] you know when we're not pressing you
[1:24:51] know what we're
[1:24:52] we could be doing
[1:24:54] just going to try to say this graceful
[1:24:56] i've attained
[1:24:58] i wouldn't say it with our mouth
[1:25:00] but just our actions
[1:25:04] now if the devil can't get us lifted up
[1:25:05] in pride
[1:25:07] he'll try to bring us down with
[1:25:08] condemnation
[1:25:12] the devil also loves reminding us of all
[1:25:15] of our failures of all of our mistakes
[1:25:18] of all of our shortcomings our
[1:25:20] unfaithfulness
[1:25:25] we want to kick him out don't we
[1:25:29] so whether or not we're lifted up with
[1:25:31] pride or we've been beat down with
[1:25:33] condemnation either way the devil knows
[1:25:36] that when we're in that condition either
[1:25:39] one we won't press forward
[1:25:42] if you're so beat down you don't feel
[1:25:44] like trying you won't press
[1:25:46] if you're lifted up in pride and look at
[1:25:48] me look at me you won't press
[1:25:50] either way
[1:25:52] that's why we got to know what's
[1:25:54] happening in their mind
[1:25:55] your mind just can't sit there and think
[1:25:57] whatever it wants to think of and it's
[1:25:58] going to be okay there's healthy things
[1:26:00] and unhealthy things
[1:26:03] something's been on my heart for oh
[1:26:05] probably two months now
[1:26:07] about uh and they started studying a
[1:26:09] little bit about it but a message on how
[1:26:12] to think
[1:26:14] just the simplicity of how we should
[1:26:16] think
[1:26:17] because we don't know how to think
[1:26:23] feeling proud doesn't mean you have
[1:26:24] faith
[1:26:27] and feeling condemned doesn't mean you
[1:26:28] have humility
[1:26:32] and even if you
[1:26:34] if we try
[1:26:36] when we're lifted up with pride
[1:26:38] let's say we're just lifted up with
[1:26:40] pride and oh yeah we got a following
[1:26:42] with us and we're going to try
[1:26:44] you know to attain tomorrow god even if
[1:26:47] that does happen
[1:26:48] see satan knows that god resists the
[1:26:51] proud
[1:26:54] he won't give you grace
[1:26:57] and and even if if
[1:27:00] somehow you get down so beat and you're
[1:27:02] so negative about your situation and you
[1:27:06] try
[1:27:07] satan knows that god won't honor it
[1:27:10] because there is no faith
[1:27:13] it's just a murmuring and a complaining
[1:27:16] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:27:17] them so i'm just telling you either way
[1:27:20] you've got to get rid of negative
[1:27:21] attitudes in your life you cannot grow
[1:27:23] to the statue of a perfect man if you're
[1:27:25] carrying with you an attitude that
[1:27:28] that's selfish or that's that's negative
[1:27:30] or this that's proud you've got to have
[1:27:33] the spirit of christ with you
[1:27:40] a humble contrite spirit are not
[1:27:42] despised
[1:27:45] let's forget about anything in our past
[1:27:48] that will lift us up or condemn us
[1:27:51] and be stirred in our minds to press
[1:27:53] towards what god has for each and every
[1:27:55] one of us
[1:28:01] jesus said be ready
[1:28:04] that he's come in an hour we think not
[1:28:08] let's focus on getting ready
[1:28:10] how about that
[1:28:12] or brother john you don't know i feel
[1:28:14] like i'm ready
[1:28:15] by faith i feel like i'm ready
[1:28:18] well praise the lord
[1:28:20] i can't say that you're not
[1:28:22] but have the attitude that god wants to
[1:28:25] see more of himself in you amen how's
[1:28:28] that
[1:28:29] how's that
[1:28:31] it's not about whether we're we're
[1:28:33] officially ready or not
[1:28:35] it's about if we officially have the
[1:28:37] right attitudes
[1:28:42] can i just take a a few minutes
[1:28:44] about mind control
[1:28:47] we've heard a lot of bad things about
[1:28:48] mind control right
[1:28:50] how bad it is
[1:28:53] well god
[1:28:55] wants to control our minds
[1:28:58] that's not a bad thing
[1:29:02] he wants to control our minds and the
[1:29:04] way that we think amen
[1:29:06] he wants certain things forgotten and he
[1:29:08] wants certain things stirred up he just
[1:29:09] wants control of that situation
[1:29:12] one time jesus said remember lot's wife
[1:29:15] what was he doing
[1:29:18] stirring up the mind of something in the
[1:29:22] past and
[1:29:25] he wanted to control the way the person
[1:29:28] was thinking
[1:29:29] so remember lot's wife
[1:29:32] and i'll tell you when we read that
[1:29:33] scripture it made us to think about
[1:29:35] sodom
[1:29:40] it may not be something
[1:29:43] that we want to think about
[1:29:45] it may not be something we want to
[1:29:47] remember but it is something that god
[1:29:49] wants us to remember
[1:29:50] and there's a purpose in it
[1:29:52] he wants to control our minds he will
[1:29:54] bring all things the bible says not just
[1:29:57] some things but he'll bring all things
[1:29:58] to our remembrance
[1:30:00] whatsoever he has spoken
[1:30:03] remember the time that the the two
[1:30:05] disciples were on the road to emmaus
[1:30:11] and they had gone through a tremendous
[1:30:13] trial
[1:30:14] you ever go through a tremendous trial
[1:30:17] so you should better relate to this one
[1:30:20] and what does trials usually do for us
[1:30:26] that they take us down
[1:30:29] they really do when we look at job we
[1:30:31] think oh wow
[1:30:32] how did he do it right
[1:30:34] how did he do how did how did jonah in
[1:30:37] the middle of all that seaweed and vomit
[1:30:39] look towards jerusalem and pray
[1:30:42] so trials have a way of bringing us down
[1:30:46] and these disciples of god they were
[1:30:48] they were they were negative
[1:30:51] their attitude was down about the the
[1:30:53] current situation they were in and i'll
[1:30:56] tell you what happens a lot of times
[1:30:58] when we get negative and we we stay in
[1:31:00] that negative state that we don't
[1:31:02] recognize the very presence of god can
[1:31:04] be amongst us
[1:31:08] and here jesus came amongst them and
[1:31:10] they didn't even recognize it
[1:31:14] how many times you've been so negative
[1:31:16] and somebody said hey but what about
[1:31:17] this
[1:31:18] and they reminded you about something
[1:31:21] you think oh yeah why didn't i think
[1:31:22] about that
[1:31:24] because a negative mindset will bring
[1:31:26] you down
[1:31:30] and jesus
[1:31:32] he doesn't flirt with that thing
[1:31:36] he doesn't baby that thing
[1:31:39] he doesn't say
[1:31:40] oh
[1:31:44] no he said oh fools
[1:31:47] fools his own disciples he's calling
[1:31:50] fools
[1:31:51] and slow of heart to believe all that
[1:31:54] the prophets have spoken
[1:31:57] ought not christ to have suffered these
[1:31:59] things
[1:32:01] so he's bringing to the remembrance
[1:32:05] something they already knew
[1:32:09] i wonder how many times the lord's
[1:32:11] called me a fool
[1:32:14] come on
[1:32:16] if we're disciples go and put it past
[1:32:19] him
[1:32:25] it's okay
[1:32:26] that we hear things over and over and
[1:32:29] over
[1:32:30] it's okay
[1:32:32] we need it
[1:32:34] because the enemy is coming in and he's
[1:32:37] trying to get us off track and trying to
[1:32:38] to
[1:32:40] to get us distracted from the path that
[1:32:43] we need to be on
[1:32:46] so whatever you do
[1:32:49] lay aside everything
[1:32:51] you got going on in your life and get
[1:32:53] perfect love
[1:32:57] now the best way for god to control
[1:33:00] is to allow his mind inside of us
[1:33:03] let this mind that was in christ be in
[1:33:06] you the way he thinks the bible says
[1:33:10] that his thoughts are higher than our
[1:33:12] thoughts
[1:33:16] how can i attain to them
[1:33:18] you know we're so used to getting
[1:33:20] watching something on tv
[1:33:23] sometimes it's for entertainment
[1:33:26] and sometimes there are documentaries
[1:33:30] but i'm just going to say in the middle
[1:33:31] of everything
[1:33:33] his thoughts are so much higher
[1:33:36] and even though we come to church and
[1:33:37] we're hearing the word preached and we
[1:33:39] say well yeah that's the word of god
[1:33:40] that's kind of prophet we believe that
[1:33:43] but are we touching his thoughts
[1:33:46] are we catching this thought are we
[1:33:48] trying to interpret his thought
[1:33:52] are we trying to say i unders i i by
[1:33:55] knowledge understand his thought no
[1:33:58] we've got to catch his thought
[1:34:01] we have to have that thought come into
[1:34:03] our minds
[1:34:05] and pray nate that word that thought
[1:34:07] that because a a word is a thought
[1:34:09] spoken right
[1:34:11] or a thought is a word spoken and we
[1:34:14] need that that thought to come inside
[1:34:17] plant that seed
[1:34:19] and hide it hold it
[1:34:22] in this great battle that goes on in our
[1:34:24] mind too often
[1:34:26] we don't want the devil out
[1:34:33] when the devil is trying to get you
[1:34:35] to tell you that you can do what you
[1:34:37] want to do
[1:34:39] we don't want him out
[1:34:41] but now there's certain times we want
[1:34:42] him out
[1:34:43] because he's plaguing us and tormenting
[1:34:45] us the word devil means a tormentor and
[1:34:47] he keeps us up at night and we just we
[1:34:50] we just are so battled with these
[1:34:52] thoughts that we don't know where
[1:34:53] they're coming from so there's this this
[1:34:55] time that we want the devil out and then
[1:34:57] there's this time that we really want
[1:34:58] the devil there we don't want to hear be
[1:35:00] stirred up at church about something we
[1:35:02] need to be doing when we don't want to
[1:35:04] be doing it
[1:35:07] it's a reality
[1:35:14] wants to hear about laying down our
[1:35:15] lives to serve others anyways
[1:35:18] just giving up your time
[1:35:21] like why do we want to hear about
[1:35:23] praying in this spirit all the time when
[1:35:25] why did i kind of just pray when i get
[1:35:27] when i want to
[1:35:32] how about giving up our time to win a
[1:35:34] soul
[1:35:35] amen do we hunger for those thoughts
[1:35:38] we hunger for that in our
[1:35:40] minds god wants control of our minds
[1:35:46] so we'll follow his word
[1:35:50] god wants to be able to manifest his
[1:35:52] life of unconditional love
[1:35:56] he wants to show
[1:35:57] compassion long-suffering and all those
[1:36:00] great attributes that brother branham
[1:36:01] told us about at the very very beginning
[1:36:04] of what he wanted to do now he just
[1:36:06] didn't show it through jesus christ but
[1:36:09] he's showing it through his bride
[1:36:12] and just because i claim to be bride
[1:36:14] doesn't mean i'm showing it
[1:36:17] i still gotta die out i still gotta
[1:36:19] hunger for it but i know that is god's
[1:36:22] very heart to manifest himself through
[1:36:25] me
[1:36:26] the bible says the whole earth is
[1:36:28] groaning and waiting and travailing
[1:36:30] waiting for the sons of god to be
[1:36:32] manifested
[1:36:37] our minds
[1:36:40] are carnal
[1:36:42] the bible says they're not even subject
[1:36:43] to god
[1:36:46] so we need the mind of christ we need
[1:36:48] him to control our minds
[1:36:53] i mean there are times we looked at
[1:36:54] others and we've said you're not gonna
[1:36:56] control me you're just trying to control
[1:36:58] me you're just trying to manipulate me
[1:37:00] right
[1:37:02] come on
[1:37:04] this has happened to us a lot
[1:37:08] you're just being nice because of
[1:37:10] you're just saying that because of
[1:37:14] what we heard about
[1:37:16] belial messages right
[1:37:21] backwards music
[1:37:23] all that stuff
[1:37:26] previews about french fries and popcorn
[1:37:31] all of a sudden you're hungry
[1:37:37] god wants to place his mind inside of us
[1:37:40] that's where real peace comes from the
[1:37:42] mind of christ
[1:37:45] he wants to control our mind so we'll
[1:37:47] esteem others better than herself
[1:37:51] he gives
[1:37:52] more grace to the humble
[1:37:55] and with a humble mind we'll give more
[1:37:57] grace to others we won't be so
[1:37:58] judgmental we won't be so critical
[1:38:02] we won't put them on the chopping block
[1:38:05] and then make excuses for us while we do
[1:38:07] what we do
[1:38:10] i don't want one more scripture if i
[1:38:12] could before we dismiss it's the second
[1:38:13] peter chapter three
[1:38:18] it is the job of the holy ghost to stir
[1:38:20] us up
[1:38:21] to remind us
[1:38:24] of his word
[1:38:27] second peter chapter 3 verse 1 this
[1:38:29] second epistle beloved i now write unto
[1:38:32] you in both which i stir up your pure
[1:38:35] minds
[1:38:36] by a way of remembrance
[1:38:39] pure minds
[1:38:40] by way of remembrance so we can have a
[1:38:43] pure mind and still need to be reminded
[1:38:48] that you
[1:38:49] may be
[1:38:50] mindful of the words which were spoken
[1:38:54] before by the holy prophets
[1:38:57] and of the commandment of us the
[1:39:00] apostles
[1:39:01] of our lord and savior
[1:39:04] amen let's say it together may god
[1:39:08] continue to remind us of his will for
[1:39:11] our life
[1:39:13] stir us up
[1:39:15] enter into the word
[1:39:18] just because we hear the word doesn't
[1:39:19] mean it comes in
[1:39:21] but when your attitude says i want it i
[1:39:24] want it i hunger i thirst it comes in he
[1:39:27] comes where he's welcomed that's right
[1:39:30] i want to encourage you to be to welcome
[1:39:33] that word into your heart amen
[1:39:38] amen let's sing jesus be the lord of all
[1:39:45] or we can
[1:39:47] maybe uh

[1:41:51] [Music]
[1:41:54] we don't know how much time we're gonna
[1:41:55] have
[1:41:57] we don't know when the lord is coming
[1:42:02] we don't know when it's going to be our
[1:42:03] last day
[1:42:07] even when god had warned
[1:42:12] paul
[1:42:14] that soon he was going to
[1:42:18] have to put off this old tabernacle
[1:42:22] there was something inside
[1:42:24] of paul
[1:42:27] to want to be his very best from that
[1:42:29] that moment forward didn't didn't want
[1:42:31] to didn't want to be half-hearted with
[1:42:33] god
[1:42:35] and and peter
[1:42:37] when he met jesus when he was walking
[1:42:39] out of
[1:42:40] jerusalem
[1:42:43] and
[1:42:44] he knew that it was his time to give his
[1:42:47] life
[1:42:48] there was something in peter
[1:42:50] that wanted to give his best
[1:42:53] and he felt it wasn't even worthy to be
[1:42:54] crucified but
[1:42:56] crucify me upside down
[1:42:59] and i'll just say to you
[1:43:02] we don't know how much time we have

[1:43:22] can't do that's inside of you
