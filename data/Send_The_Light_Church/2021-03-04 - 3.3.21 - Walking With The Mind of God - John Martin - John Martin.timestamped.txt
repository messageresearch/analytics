[35:12] of the word
[35:14] we give you the praise in jesus precious
[35:16] name
[35:17] amen and amen god bless you turn with me
[35:20] if you would to the book of philippians
[35:23] chapter 2 and we're going to read just
[35:26] one verse of scripture there
[35:28] that we had read last service uh last
[35:31] service we
[35:33] uh entitled that walking with god and
[35:35] today we want to entitle this message
[35:39] walking with the mind of god amen
[35:42] and we're just i think it's it's a great
[35:45] need in this hour that we're we're
[35:47] living in amen but just
[35:48] one verse there let this mind be in you
[35:52] which was also in christ jesus
[35:55] amen god bless you may be seated just
[35:58] before our men's meeting today brother
[36:00] boaz
[36:01] had called from india wanted to
[36:04] give each of you uh greetings from him
[36:07] and wish that he could be here this was
[36:09] a month
[36:10] that he did try to come and with the
[36:13] culvert and
[36:14] basically the culvert restrictions now
[36:16] uh that they require
[36:18] um it's really put a damper on him
[36:22] coming but let's pray for him his one
[36:25] hand
[36:25] he cannot use he can't grab
[36:29] and if he does he he can't get it back
[36:33] and so surgery is too expensive and
[36:36] the other hospitals are full of covet
[36:39] situations so
[36:40] he he needs divine intervention from the
[36:44] lord if we could just
[36:46] remember to pray for him we we did pray
[36:48] with him on the phone but
[36:49] i just believe that collectively if we
[36:53] could pray together
[36:54] it would it would get the job done amen
[36:58] amen well um
[37:01] this thought
[37:05] on the mind of of god
[37:09] is is important um brother branham
[37:13] told us that we are in the greatest
[37:15] battle
[37:16] that was ever fought amen
[37:19] and every day we're just in great
[37:22] battles
[37:23] they only got to be doing anything and
[37:25] we're in a great battle
[37:28] but i i want to testify today that god
[37:31] is walking around
[37:35] with peace
[37:39] and when we walk with the mind of god we
[37:41] too can have peace
[37:44] in the message god provided place of
[37:47] worship
[37:47] brother branham said the world would go
[37:50] insane just quoting him he says
[37:52] it's not but just about one degree
[37:55] right now yes and that was in 1964.
[37:59] it's got to be it's got to be there
[38:02] amen i believe that things are are
[38:05] are so perverted the world is getting
[38:07] crazier by the day it's on such a
[38:10] rampant
[38:11] speed you can't believe any of the news
[38:16] it's lies upon lies opinions over facts
[38:20] we can't keep up with the immorality and
[38:22] the perversion
[38:25] what the world calls right is wrong
[38:29] confusion compounding confusion the lgbt
[38:33] is increasing faster than it ever was
[38:35] before
[38:37] children are getting to make their own
[38:40] decision
[38:41] on what gender they're going to be this
[38:46] is the world that we're living in
[38:48] it's going insane according to
[38:50] revelations chapter 12 verse 11
[38:52] satan deceiveth the whole world well we
[38:54] see it it's happening
[38:56] second corinthians chapter four verse
[38:59] says in whom the god of this world
[39:03] has blinded the minds
[39:06] of them which believe not
[39:10] how important it is to believe the word
[39:12] when you hear it
[39:13] because as soon as you don't believe it
[39:15] your mind gets blind
[39:18] lest the light of the glorious gospel of
[39:20] christ who's in the image of god
[39:22] should shine upon them now this is
[39:23] really important sometimes we don't know
[39:25] what to believe
[39:27] because you know i remember coming to
[39:30] christ as a young christian
[39:32] i didn't know nothing really about the
[39:34] bible
[39:39] and and you don't know what to believe
[39:44] but you got to believe something you got
[39:47] to take a stand somewhere
[39:50] and um i know
[39:53] that if i needed my car fixed i would
[39:56] rather
[39:58] i would rather follow brother bruce
[40:03] then follow anne
[40:10] and when god brings you to the truth
[40:16] he's going to lead and guide you into
[40:17] all truth amen
[40:19] that's just his promise
[40:23] second timothy chapter 3 verse 13
[40:25] speaking of the time that we're living
[40:27] in the bible says but evil men
[40:28] and seducers shall wax worse and worse
[40:32] deceiving and being deceived this is the
[40:36] hour that we're living in
[40:38] what do we need to do what do we do in
[40:39] this this condition
[40:41] he tells timothy in verse 14
[40:44] but continue thou in the things which
[40:46] thou has learned
[40:48] and has been assured of anoint who uh
[40:50] whom thou has
[40:52] learned them knowing of whom thou has
[40:54] learned then the prophet came
[40:55] and gave us a message brother bruce came
[40:58] up here and he said this
[40:59] this is not my surprise what's happening
[41:02] the prophet warned us he told us
[41:04] just continuing the message continue in
[41:06] the word
[41:08] amen the bible says there'll be scoffers
[41:11] all around us
[41:13] many are leaving what they once believed
[41:18] there's a great falling away the bible
[41:20] says
[41:21] church-going people who have become
[41:24] more in love with themselves
[41:28] than ever before to the point that
[41:29] they're loving pleasures more than their
[41:31] loving god
[41:32] right just just my bible
[41:36] they become bolsters proud unthankful
[41:39] unholy
[41:40] making the sanctuary mourn holy
[41:45] fierce false accusers traitors heady
[41:48] high-minded
[41:49] despisers of those we're not speaking
[41:52] of those who go to bars
[41:56] we're speaking of the church
[41:59] despisers of those who are trying to do
[42:02] their best
[42:05] jude mentioned spots in your feast of
[42:07] charity
[42:08] when they feast with you feeding
[42:10] themselves without fear
[42:13] making the sanctuary just a place of
[42:15] them
[42:17] instead of god's house
[42:20] iniquity is abounding the love of many
[42:23] is waxing cold
[42:25] this is the hour that we're living in we
[42:28] need to be walking with the mind of
[42:29] christ
[42:31] jesus speaking of the very hour that
[42:33] we're living in in matthew 24 verse 36
[42:36] he says
[42:36] but of that day speaking of his
[42:39] returning and the
[42:40] hour no man knoweth not even the angels
[42:42] in heaven
[42:43] but my father only.
[42:47] and so he goes on to continue he says
[42:49] but as the days of noah where so shall
[42:52] it be also in the coming of the son of
[42:54] man
[42:55] first for as in the days that were
[42:58] before the flood
[42:59] they were eating and drinking marrying
[43:00] given in marriage until the day noah
[43:02] entered into the ark
[43:04] in other words it is no different
[43:08] you couldn't tell you couldn't tell by
[43:10] those signs
[43:12] it's the same thing as happening they're
[43:14] they're eating they're drinking they're
[43:16] marrying they're giving it to marriages
[43:17] it's just the way it was then so you
[43:20] couldn't tell
[43:22] and knew not until the flood
[43:26] came and took them all away so
[43:29] shall also the coming of the son of man
[43:31] be you won't be able to tell by those
[43:34] signs
[43:34] i'm glad that god sent a prophet
[43:38] because we can see a lot a lot clearer
[43:41] than just
[43:42] the eating and drinking and giving in
[43:44] the marriage
[43:46] but there's another thing that happened
[43:48] in the days of noah
[43:49] that's happening today in genesis
[43:51] chapter 6 verse 5
[43:53] and god saw that the wickedness of man
[43:55] was great in the earth
[43:56] and that every imagination
[44:00] of the thoughts of his heart were only
[44:02] evil
[44:03] continually we need to be walking with
[44:06] the mind of god this is the
[44:08] hour where man is thinking evil
[44:10] continually
[44:11] amen
[44:15] amen i think there's something that we
[44:17] all could testify of
[44:18] and that is the last that we have
[44:20] listened to the news
[44:22] the better our mind has been true
[44:27] it affects the way that we think
[44:30] i think we need to stop listening to the
[44:32] bad news
[44:33] and start listening to the good news it
[44:36] will help
[44:38] a lot of times we don't realize how
[44:41] bad our thinking actually becomes
[44:46] until somebody says what are you talking
[44:48] about what do you saying what are you
[44:49] doing
[44:53] this was the mind of god that god had
[44:56] about blind leaders and that's i think a
[44:58] lot what we listen to in the news
[45:01] matthew chapter 15 verse 14.
[45:05] and i think we should walk with it i
[45:06] think we should walk
[45:08] with what god's teaching is here he says
[45:10] let them alone
[45:13] they be blind leaders of the blind and
[45:16] if the blind lead the blind
[45:18] both shall fall into the ditch
[45:21] then answered peter and said unto him
[45:24] declare unto us this parable and jesus
[45:26] said
[45:26] are ye also yet without understanding do
[45:29] you
[45:30] not understand that whatsoever entereth
[45:32] into the mouth
[45:33] goes into the valley and is cast out and
[45:35] to draw
[45:38] okay we eat every day we understand what
[45:40] that means but
[45:42] think of this though things you eat not
[45:44] everything comes out
[45:46] in other words it gives you body energy
[45:50] it helps you right that goes to your
[45:54] cells gives you
[45:55] a nutrients all your organs can work
[45:58] for out of the heart proceedeth evil
[46:01] thoughts
[46:03] murders adulterers fornication theft
[46:06] false witness blasphemies
[46:08] these are the things which defile man
[46:10] and not to eat with unwashed
[46:12] hands defileth not a man
[46:16] out it's not here's the thing we're
[46:19] going to listen to a bunch of bad news
[46:21] or bad reports or stuff like that
[46:24] and i understand that you know we just
[46:27] kind of like yeah
[46:28] get it out right but there's some of
[46:31] that stuff that's going to affect you
[46:36] and out of the heart perceive evil
[46:39] thoughts
[46:40] judgmental thoughts things
[46:44] we're living in an insane world
[46:48] where people are thinking insanely
[46:57] i used to think it's true like but
[47:00] brother random said we're oddballs but
[47:03] i'm telling you
[47:04] the world is the real oddballs yes
[47:08] they're they're just crazy
[47:12] it's hard to act normal in front of them
[47:18] you want to ask them a thousand
[47:19] questions why they asking why you're
[47:21] dressing while you're doing what you're
[47:22] doing this is not normal
[47:25] but the world is just going in that
[47:27] direction
[47:32] proverbs 25 25 says as cold waters
[47:35] to a thirsty soul imagine you're being
[47:39] thirsty
[47:40] and getting some cold water so is good
[47:43] news
[47:44] from the far country amen why would we
[47:46] want to listen to cnn and what's
[47:48] happening in syria
[47:53] imagine what bad news does for the soul
[47:56] what i got here is hot water on a soul
[47:59] that's been saturated by the world
[48:03] doesn't do you any good you already are
[48:05] saturated
[48:06] you don't need it and on top of it it's
[48:08] hot
[48:11] bad news fills people's minds with fear
[48:14] hopelessness and hatred
[48:18] that's what bad news does because you
[48:20] can't take it after a while you just
[48:22] want to
[48:23] hate that is the truth
[48:27] a sound mind or the mind of god is not a
[48:31] gift to us whether we want it or not
[48:34] that's right in fact first john chapter
[48:37] 4 verse 1 says believe
[48:39] not every spirit amen
[48:42] you have to try the spirit to see
[48:43] whether it's of god or not
[48:46] it's not a gift jesus
[48:50] told peter satan would desire
[48:53] to sift you as wheat that's where his
[48:57] mind is at that's what he wants to do he
[48:58] wants to confuse you
[49:01] torment you day and night with fear
[49:04] confuse you and leave you feeling
[49:07] hopeless
[49:08] what do i do in my situation that's the
[49:10] devil
[49:11] that's the mind of the devil
[49:15] and we feel the effects of the devil
[49:17] every day
[49:19] if the mind of god was a gift we'd all
[49:21] take it
[49:23] because we need it we don't like dealing
[49:26] with his stuff
[49:27] but paul told timothy that this sound
[49:30] mind
[49:31] comes with the holy ghost second timothy
[49:34] chapter 1 verse 7
[49:36] for god have not given us the spirit of
[49:38] fear but a power
[49:40] and of love and of a sound mine
[49:46] now how many's got the holy ghost
[49:48] humming's battling
[49:50] having to sound mine
[49:56] so how do we activate it how do we
[49:59] activate it
[50:02] verse 6 is the answer
[50:05] wherefore i put thee in remembrance that
[50:07] thou stir
[50:08] up the gift of god which is in thee by
[50:12] the putting on of hands
[50:14] well we know the holy ghost is a gift to
[50:15] god
[50:17] but it has to be stirred up you have to
[50:21] to kindle it i mean we we make fires
[50:23] every day
[50:27] and if you do not keep putting the wood
[50:30] on that fire
[50:31] it will begin to smolter
[50:35] and when it smolders and you try to put
[50:37] a big log on it ain't gonna go
[50:40] because you let it get too low right
[50:44] so what you have to do is rekindle it
[50:46] with just a little bit
[50:51] what you're doing is you're rekindling
[50:54] your attitude
[50:56] with god
[51:03] i say let's spend more time stirring up
[51:05] the gift of god
[51:07] inside of each one of us because we need
[51:10] a sound mind in this
[51:11] hour that we're living in now you can
[51:15] praise them
[51:15] and that will help but i want to ask the
[51:18] question
[51:19] why did the fire go out to begin with
[51:24] was it because you stopped praising him
[51:31] i think one way to stir up the gift of
[51:32] god which is in thee
[51:34] is to simply humble yourself before the
[51:36] lord
[51:37] amen first peter chapter 5 verse 5
[51:41] likewise ye younger submit yourselves to
[51:44] the elder ya i'll be subject one to
[51:45] another be clothed with humility for god
[51:48] resisteth the proud
[51:52] and gives grace to the humble
[51:56] you want to rekindle get humble
[52:00] put the clothes of humility on
[52:04] verse six humble yourselves therefore
[52:06] under
[52:07] the mighty hand of god and he will exalt
[52:10] you in due time
[52:12] in other words you will feel that power
[52:14] that love and the sound mind that's
[52:16] already in you you just got to stir it
[52:19] up
[52:23] casting all your care upon him
[52:27] for he careth for you but don't try to
[52:31] do it with pride
[52:37] you got to do it with humility
[52:40] the world's got problems
[52:44] and a lot of them complain to god
[52:47] if you really do this you wouldn't do
[52:49] you would allow this and this wouldn't
[52:50] be happening you'd help me with this
[52:53] pride they don't want to humble
[52:56] themselves before the lord you humble
[52:59] yourself before
[53:00] then you cast all your cares upon the
[53:02] lord he cares for us but he doesn't
[53:05] he's not going to go beyond your pride
[53:11] just because he cares for you in other
[53:13] words if you don't care
[53:15] in the relationship to respect god
[53:19] to give him the respect that he deserves
[53:24] we can't go to god in that
[53:28] holiest of holies with that kind of
[53:30] attitude i need you right now
[53:36] humble yourselves under the mighty hand
[53:38] those chair fins
[53:40] the wings are stretched out humble
[53:43] yourself
[53:44] under the mighty hand of god that he may
[53:46] exalt you
[53:48] in due time
[53:52] don't cast your cares upon other humans
[53:57] god wants that relationship with you
[54:02] look at this great battle here verse 8
[54:04] be sober be
[54:08] vigilant
[54:10] be sober be vigilant because your
[54:13] adversary the devil
[54:15] as a roaring lion walketh about seeking
[54:18] whom he may devour he's looking for a
[54:21] mind
[54:22] that is weak that is unbelieving
[54:26] that is proud that is arrogant
[54:31] because he can devour them
[54:34] whom resists steadfast
[54:37] in the faith knowing that the same
[54:39] afflictions the same things that you're
[54:41] going through
[54:42] are accomplished in your brethren around
[54:45] the world and i heard that
[54:46] testimony from brother boaz today the
[54:49] things that are going on that the cove
[54:51] and the problems and the people who are
[54:53] dying over there
[54:55] we're not alone
[55:02] but we need the mind of christ we need
[55:06] it to be in
[55:06] us and we do that by humbling ourselves
[55:09] before the lord
[55:11] no matter what the state is humble
[55:13] yourself let this
[55:15] mind be in you which was also in christ
[55:17] jesus
[55:19] this mind we talked a little bit about
[55:22] it
[55:22] no reputation took the form of a servant
[55:24] in verse 8 and being found
[55:27] in the fashion as a man he humbled
[55:29] himself
[55:30] and became obedient even unto death
[55:32] wherefore god
[55:34] also have highly exalted him the same
[55:37] thing
[55:38] that peter is telling us to do
[55:41] is the same thing that the father did
[55:43] for jesus
[55:45] he humbled himself under the mighty hand
[55:47] of the father
[55:48] and he exalted him in due time and as he
[55:51] makes the same promise to us if we
[55:54] follow
[55:55] the example that jesus did we follow his
[55:58] steps
[55:58] for this for this us oh let's
[56:02] let's oh for this for this
[56:06] what for this what for this what why
[56:10] isn't it coming first peter chapter 2
[56:13] verse 21
[56:14] first peter chapter 2 verse 21
[56:19] for here unto were you called because
[56:22] christ also suffered for us
[56:24] leaving us an example that we should
[56:26] follow his steps right there
[56:32] i want god i need god
[56:36] to give me a sound mind as i'm going
[56:40] through what i'm going through
[56:42] amen that's right
[56:46] i want god i want to walk with the mind
[56:50] of god
[56:52] i can't stop what's coming at me i don't
[56:54] even know what's coming at me
[56:58] but just knowing what i go through on a
[57:00] on a daily basis
[57:02] you can almost think that anything's
[57:03] going to happen
[57:07] we need to stir up the gift of god
[57:09] that's inside of us we need to stir up
[57:10] that holy ghost and say god
[57:12] i need it well you you you have to
[57:15] humble yourself to do that because you
[57:16] can't force god
[57:22] god is humble he said learn to me from
[57:26] meek and lowly
[57:28] the mind of god in christ humbled
[57:30] himself and became
[57:32] obedient unto death the death of the
[57:33] cross i think the mind
[57:35] of of god inside of us will do the same
[57:38] thing
[57:40] isaiah 57 15 says i dwell with him also
[57:44] that is of a contrite and humble spirit
[57:47] god
[57:47] testifies who he's walking with amen
[57:53] he's walking with the humble amen
[57:57] walking with the mind of god
[58:02] sometimes we can get our boldness mixed
[58:05] up with our arrogance
[58:09] oftentimes we may think we're walking
[58:11] with the mind of god and being bold
[58:13] but in reality it's pride and prejudice
[58:18] or arrogance
[58:24] there is a difference between boldness
[58:25] and arrogance
[58:27] remember the story of the old lion that
[58:29] roared the loudest
[58:32] a lion's roar as loud as 114 decibels
[58:37] that's about 25 times louder than a
[58:40] gas-powered lawnmower
[58:42] and can be heard from as far as five
[58:45] miles away
[58:49] that could be holly from here
[58:52] lyndon some researchers believe that a
[58:56] lion's roar
[58:57] can paralyze humans
[59:04] lions live in packs they can be
[59:07] sometimes 30. but usually it's not that
[59:10] many
[59:12] and the head of every pack or pride
[59:17] he's there's a master there's a master
[59:19] lion and he just
[59:20] stays master but eventually he gets old
[59:27] and the young lions they get stronger
[59:31] you know what i mean like
[59:35] they get like you know for the mark
[59:41] and uh they want to take over
[59:49] and the master lion he knows
[59:53] that he'd get whipped if he took mark on
[59:59] so what does he do he roars louder
[1:00:04] it's true and he tries to
[1:00:08] manipulate and scare the other lions
[1:00:11] from taking over the master position
[1:00:19] it's a lot what i say happens
[1:00:25] with arrogance
[1:00:29] boldness can handle the situation
[1:00:32] without acting like it
[1:00:35] in fact at the same time boldness
[1:00:38] carries a spirit of meekness
[1:00:41] galatians chapter six verse one brethren
[1:00:43] if if a man be overtaken in a fault
[1:00:46] ye which are spiritual restore such a
[1:00:48] one in a spirit of
[1:00:50] meekness considering thyself lest thou
[1:00:53] also be tempted so here's someone
[1:00:56] that has boldness they can handle the
[1:00:59] situation
[1:01:00] and they they they are restoring
[1:01:04] with a spirit of meekness
[1:01:08] to me that's the bible says the bold uh
[1:01:11] the righteous or as bold as a lion
[1:01:16] but arrogance is usually walking around
[1:01:18] with a loud mouth
[1:01:20] struggling handling situations
[1:01:24] with a spirit of uniqueness
[1:01:27] so they got to use a different spirit to
[1:01:29] kind of you know
[1:01:31] manipulate it scare it
[1:01:37] learning me from meek and lowly
[1:01:40] we need to learn more about jesus when
[1:01:43] john turned his head and he saw the lion
[1:01:45] to see the lion what did he see
[1:01:47] a lamb he overcame by becoming a lamb
[1:01:52] we want to overcome our situations we
[1:01:54] want to have the boldness of the holy
[1:01:56] ghost we need to humble ourselves with
[1:01:58] the mind of god
[1:02:02] we can never go by what we think as an
[1:02:04] absolute
[1:02:06] because every man is right in his own
[1:02:08] eyes
[1:02:09] that's why the prophet taught us i could
[1:02:11] be wrong about anything that's why james
[1:02:14] said
[1:02:14] we should never say we're going to do
[1:02:15] this we should say the lord willing
[1:02:17] amen amen not just knowing it but
[1:02:20] believing it and acting like you really
[1:02:22] believe it i
[1:02:24] could be wrong now that's the right
[1:02:26] spirit
[1:02:27] that's walking with the mind of christ
[1:02:29] amen
[1:02:31] it means walking with a humble mind
[1:02:34] i'd like to talk about three minds for a
[1:02:36] second the mind of god
[1:02:37] the mind of satan and the mind of man
[1:02:41] the mind of god is the highest rank or
[1:02:43] order in correct and absolute thinking
[1:02:48] isaiah chapter 55 verse 7
[1:02:52] god testifying he says for let the
[1:02:54] wicked forsake his way
[1:02:56] and the unrighteous man his thoughts
[1:03:00] now i'm not sure i don't believe in
[1:03:02] labeling anybody
[1:03:04] but i believe if i'm not thinking right
[1:03:08] i'm being unrighteous with my thoughts
[1:03:12] and let him return to the lord and knows
[1:03:16] we can grieve the lord
[1:03:17] at any time the way we think did not
[1:03:20] why did why was god so um
[1:03:24] was it important to get brother branham
[1:03:26] the message
[1:03:27] make sure you tell the people that their
[1:03:30] thoughts are speaking louder in heaven
[1:03:31] than their words do on earth
[1:03:35] god is interested in them
[1:03:39] so if we return to the lord he will have
[1:03:40] mercy upon him and to our god for he
[1:03:42] will abundantly pardon for
[1:03:44] my thoughts are not your thoughts i just
[1:03:47] want to
[1:03:47] make that real clear let's separate the
[1:03:51] mind of god from us
[1:03:53] for my thoughts are not your thoughts
[1:03:55] neither are your ways my way
[1:03:57] saith the lord for as the heavens are
[1:03:58] higher than the earth so are my ways
[1:04:01] then your ways and my thoughts then your
[1:04:04] thoughts
[1:04:07] if you're gonna walk with the mind of
[1:04:09] god you're going to walk
[1:04:11] with the highest order of thinking
[1:04:16] amen according to the scriptures they're
[1:04:18] higher than the where we're at
[1:04:21] now the mind of satan is the lowest rank
[1:04:24] or order in correct and absolute
[1:04:27] thinking
[1:04:30] he believes that his thoughts are
[1:04:32] actually higher than god's
[1:04:34] i will be like the most high i will sit
[1:04:36] on the mountain of god
[1:04:37] i will set my throne above the throne of
[1:04:39] god
[1:04:41] so he's his thinking is that it's higher
[1:04:45] but is actually the lowest because you
[1:04:47] can't get higher than god
[1:04:51] the brightness of satan's own ability
[1:04:54] actually blinded him
[1:04:55] from correct and absolute thinking
[1:04:59] so we can conclude that his way of
[1:05:00] thinking is simply
[1:05:02] perverted simply perverted
[1:05:07] now the mind of man was born
[1:05:11] with the same mindset that satan has
[1:05:16] he doesn't want to have to do the will
[1:05:19] of his creator he wants to do his own
[1:05:23] thing
[1:05:25] he wants to be like the most high he
[1:05:26] wants to call the shots for his life
[1:05:30] this is the mind of satan man
[1:05:34] is born with the same satanic perverted
[1:05:37] thought process he thinks arrogantly
[1:05:40] he's right all the time you can't tell
[1:05:42] him he's wrong he's selfish he's
[1:05:44] judgmental
[1:05:47] he wants his own will above gods
[1:05:52] and the mindset of the church believer
[1:05:54] has become where
[1:05:56] his desires for his will has become
[1:05:59] above his desires for god's will
[1:06:04] romans chapter 8 verse 7 says but the
[1:06:06] carnal mind
[1:06:08] is enmity against god
[1:06:11] for it is not subject to the law of god
[1:06:13] and i want you to read this with me
[1:06:15] neither indeed can be
[1:06:26] for they that are after the flesh they
[1:06:28] do mind the things of the flesh
[1:06:30] they are the spirit the things of the
[1:06:31] spirit for to be carnally minded
[1:06:34] is death but to be spiritually minded is
[1:06:36] notice
[1:06:37] life and peace that's right that's the
[1:06:39] mind of god right there
[1:06:41] life and peace
[1:06:45] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:06:48] cannot
[1:06:49] please god
[1:06:52] so the mind of man
[1:06:55] is the same as the mind the mind of
[1:06:59] satan
[1:07:03] anybody know the song my way
[1:07:07] frank sinatra it took a few minutes
[1:07:11] looked it up first and last verse
[1:07:14] the writer says and now the end is near
[1:07:17] and so i
[1:07:18] face the final curtain my friend
[1:07:21] i'll say it clear i'll state my case
[1:07:25] of which i'm certain i've lived a life
[1:07:28] that's
[1:07:28] full i've traveled each and every
[1:07:30] highway
[1:07:32] and more much more than this i did it
[1:07:35] my way
[1:07:39] did not jesus say in matthew chapter 16
[1:07:41] verse 26
[1:07:42] for what is a man profited
[1:07:46] if he shall gain the whole world and
[1:07:48] lose his own soul
[1:07:50] or what shall he give in exchange for
[1:07:53] his soul
[1:07:56] luke chapter 9 verse 25 says
[1:07:59] for what is a man's advantage
[1:08:02] if he gained the whole world and lose
[1:08:04] himself
[1:08:06] or be a castaway right most people walk
[1:08:09] around
[1:08:10] they don't even know they got a soul
[1:08:13] they
[1:08:13] don't know they got a soul they think
[1:08:17] this how they think what they are this
[1:08:19] is who they are
[1:08:21] there's nothing beyond this so get what
[1:08:22] you can get out of life
[1:08:29] so what are we going to profit by
[1:08:32] gaining everything that we want to to do
[1:08:34] it our own way
[1:08:37] look at this last verse for what
[1:08:40] is a man what has he got
[1:08:44] if not himself then he has not
[1:08:49] is it there's nothing else besides
[1:08:54] me to say the things
[1:08:58] he truly feels and not the words
[1:09:01] of one who kneels my
[1:09:04] the record shows i took the blows
[1:09:08] and i did it my way
[1:09:17] that's the mind of a man
[1:09:22] and just because we sit in church
[1:09:24] doesn't mean we're free
[1:09:27] from satan trying to get you to do it
[1:09:30] your way
[1:09:34] man is not born
[1:09:37] with a neutral mind
[1:09:42] he is born with ssms
[1:09:46] yeah i made that up it's
[1:09:49] satan it's selfish satanic mindset
[1:09:54] that's what he's born with selfish
[1:09:56] satanic
[1:09:58] mindset he's born
[1:10:01] heading straight to hell if he listens
[1:10:05] to himself his way of thinking his
[1:10:08] attitude
[1:10:10] that god is trying to stop him but he
[1:10:14] can't stop
[1:10:15] him without that person accepting what
[1:10:18] he's telling him
[1:10:20] it's just like judgmental thinking
[1:10:24] did you know babies are born with it
[1:10:29] babies are born with it they will
[1:10:30] actually manipulate and try to make you
[1:10:32] feel bad
[1:10:33] just to get their selfish way
[1:10:37] and you on top top of it they will
[1:10:39] literally
[1:10:40] judge you wrong for not giving them what
[1:10:42] they want
[1:10:45] they never say thank you for taking care
[1:10:47] of me the whole last week
[1:10:51] they're interested in what they want
[1:10:52] right now
[1:10:58] look at the mind of god god does not
[1:11:00] walk around with a judgmental attitude
[1:11:03] he doesn't walk around with judgmental
[1:11:04] thoughts now i know i'm saying a lot of
[1:11:06] explosive things here but
[1:11:08] you'll see it uh god helping us to get
[1:11:11] through this
[1:11:13] but the mind of satan he's the accuser
[1:11:16] of the brethren
[1:11:20] but the mind of man he's always judging
[1:11:26] always judging hitler judge the jews
[1:11:30] the minorities are judging the
[1:11:32] majorities of racism
[1:11:35] is that true it's all right for the
[1:11:38] sexual perverted to judge us wrong for
[1:11:40] our stand
[1:11:41] but we're wrong if we take a stand
[1:11:43] against perversion
[1:11:47] everyone sees a reason to be judging
[1:11:50] somebody else man's thoughts are very
[1:11:54] judgmental but not gods
[1:11:58] god's thoughts are not judgmental god
[1:12:00] has reserved
[1:12:01] final judgment for the white throne
[1:12:05] i just want to by the grace of god
[1:12:08] rightly divide this
[1:12:10] luke chapter 13 verse 1
[1:12:13] there were present at that season some
[1:12:16] that told him of the galileans
[1:12:18] whose blood pilate had mingled with the
[1:12:20] sacrifice
[1:12:22] with their sacrifices and jesus
[1:12:24] answering
[1:12:25] and said unto them suppose you that
[1:12:28] these galileans were sinners
[1:12:31] above all the galileans because
[1:12:36] they suffered worse things
[1:12:39] supposedly in other words are you going
[1:12:41] to judge this
[1:12:43] he says i tell you nay but except you
[1:12:45] repent ye shall likewise perish
[1:12:50] of those 18 upon whom the tower of
[1:12:52] shalom fell
[1:12:54] and slew them think ye that they were
[1:12:57] sinners above all men who draw jerusalem
[1:13:01] i tell you nay but except you repent you
[1:13:03] shall likewise perish
[1:13:04] so you see the the very mindset
[1:13:07] of people that that judge
[1:13:11] took a look at the woman that was caught
[1:13:14] in adultery
[1:13:17] man wanted to judge her to death yes
[1:13:21] we found her an act let's do it let's
[1:13:23] don't this is what moses said let's do
[1:13:24] it
[1:13:26] at the same time they were wanting to
[1:13:28] prove that the present
[1:13:30] ministry was off the word.
[1:13:35] they wanted to catch jesus they wanted
[1:13:37] to catch jesus
[1:13:40] because the word says stone them
[1:13:44] but they didn't know that there was a
[1:13:46] god of grace standing there
[1:13:48] it wasn't a god of judgment he didn't
[1:13:51] say i come to judge
[1:13:52] the world but i came to save the world
[1:13:56] but he that refuses me in the words that
[1:13:58] i have spoken the same shall judge him
[1:14:00] in that day he said
[1:14:02] so the hour had not come
[1:14:08] so jesus said to the accusers
[1:14:12] he that's without sin let him cast the
[1:14:14] first stone
[1:14:16] in other words bring the white throne
[1:14:18] judgment on
[1:14:20] but jesus thoughts towards her were
[1:14:23] thoughts of peace
[1:14:25] to give her an expected him
[1:14:29] see men's judgments are without mercy
[1:14:32] amen that's why god said vengeance is
[1:14:34] mine saith the lord i will repay
[1:14:36] judge not that ye be not judged blessed
[1:14:39] are the merciful for they shall obtain
[1:14:41] mercy judge nothing before its time
[1:14:47] god's judgments today are full of mercy
[1:14:52] he's sitting on the throne of mercy
[1:14:56] but don't let the devil tell you that
[1:14:57] god is off the throne of mercy when he's
[1:14:59] trying to trick you
[1:15:00] to get you to judge somebody amen
[1:15:04] god's way of thinking is merciful today
[1:15:09] his judgments towards you are with mercy
[1:15:11] to give you an expected end that's what
[1:15:13] the bible tells us
[1:15:14] i'll ask you this question you believe
[1:15:16] that with all your heart don't you
[1:15:18] don't you believe that that that god's
[1:15:21] thoughts towards you or
[1:15:22] have mercy and he wants to give you an
[1:15:23] expected end
[1:15:26] why would god's judgments towards the
[1:15:28] people that you're having problems with
[1:15:29] be without mercy then
[1:15:33] it goes to show you that you're not
[1:15:35] thinking with the mind of god
[1:15:38] you're thinking with satan's mind and
[1:15:40] you don't even realize it because satan
[1:15:41] comes and he appears
[1:15:42] he sits on the throne judging
[1:15:46] right as if he's god and because we're
[1:15:49] not trying the spirit to see whether
[1:15:52] it's of god or not
[1:15:53] we just oh every man is right in his own
[1:15:55] eyes
[1:15:58] god's thoughts are higher
[1:16:02] than the white throne judgment thoughts
[1:16:04] today
[1:16:08] they're higher everyone's walking around
[1:16:11] judging but god's
[1:16:12] not doing that god's thoughts are
[1:16:15] restoration
[1:16:17] peace repentance the renovation of the
[1:16:20] way that we think
[1:16:22] he's doing everything he can to help
[1:16:25] man come to the truth to keep walking in
[1:16:29] the truth
[1:16:31] jeremiah chapter 29 verse 11 for i know
[1:16:34] the thoughts that i think towards you
[1:16:36] saith the lord
[1:16:38] these are these higher thoughts now high
[1:16:40] thoughts
[1:16:41] thoughts of peace a thought of peace is
[1:16:44] high
[1:16:46] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:16:50] end amen doesn't that make you want to
[1:16:53] praise him
[1:16:54] amen
[1:16:57] so praise is a high response
[1:17:01] and a high thought with god then you
[1:17:04] shall call upon me and you shall go and
[1:17:05] you shall pray unto me and i will
[1:17:07] hearken unto you
[1:17:09] and you shall seek me and find me when
[1:17:11] you search
[1:17:12] for me with arrogance
[1:17:17] uh part time
[1:17:21] with pride humbleness
[1:17:26] humble enough to seek him with
[1:17:27] everything that you got
[1:17:29] that's when you find god for your
[1:17:31] situations
[1:17:33] we must be transformed by
[1:17:36] the way that we think a new way of
[1:17:38] thinking we can't be thinking
[1:17:40] like what we were born with
[1:17:44] like i'm intelligent
[1:17:49] satan's intelligence is different than
[1:17:50] god's intelligence
[1:17:54] no man is born with ssms selfish satanic
[1:17:59] mindset
[1:18:00] god has given him the capability to
[1:18:03] choose
[1:18:04] a different way of thinking that's where
[1:18:06] we type in that's where we can get in
[1:18:08] that's where we can change
[1:18:10] things around because god has given us
[1:18:12] the ability
[1:18:13] to make a choice in the way that we're
[1:18:15] going to think
[1:18:19] if you want to choose a different
[1:18:21] lifestyle
[1:18:22] then you'll first have to choose a
[1:18:24] different way of thinking
[1:18:28] i mean you know this you you want to
[1:18:30] lose weight or you want to
[1:18:34] get some muscles or whatever you can't
[1:18:38] choose the lazy boy
[1:18:42] cheese puffs the rest of your life
[1:18:46] you have to change the way that you
[1:18:48] think i can't do this
[1:18:49] and get where i want to go you can't
[1:18:52] just choose to be lazy
[1:18:54] in your mind and your thoughts and think
[1:18:55] well god's still going to help me no
[1:18:57] that ain't it
[1:18:59] amen if you want to choose the highest
[1:19:04] form of intelligence correct
[1:19:07] and absolute thinking you must humble
[1:19:10] yourself
[1:19:11] before your creator
[1:19:14] i am wrong i
[1:19:17] repent lord help me
[1:19:20] now you have put your thoughts right
[1:19:23] where they need to be
[1:19:27] like paul when god made him
[1:19:30] when god made himself known to paul paul
[1:19:33] immediately in his condition said lord
[1:19:36] what would thou have me to do
[1:19:39] and he realized it took time but he
[1:19:42] realized that he had to forsake
[1:19:44] everything all the other intelligence
[1:19:47] that he learned
[1:19:48] with his uh carnal human mind
[1:19:51] amen amen that's right
[1:19:54] i'm better than you know he was racist
[1:19:56] too he was going up to the christians
[1:20:00] everybody that was in this way
[1:20:06] god's word and god's will is an absolute
[1:20:10] above all of man's thinking
[1:20:15] you know i know
[1:20:19] think about this before we were
[1:20:21] christians
[1:20:24] before we were christians we used to
[1:20:28] listen to the news listen to teachers
[1:20:32] get all of our information and we
[1:20:35] formulated our absolute this is
[1:20:38] absolute right this is absolute truth
[1:20:40] this is where we stand
[1:20:42] now we become christians and we learn
[1:20:45] that god
[1:20:46] reveals himself to us
[1:20:50] he speaks a still small voice
[1:20:53] and he makes it clear what absolute is
[1:20:56] right well we're not going to find that
[1:21:02] being stuck in a carnal mindset
[1:21:06] that's like keeping yourself proud
[1:21:09] haughty
[1:21:10] arrogant and saying god
[1:21:14] uh come to my level
[1:21:19] it's not gonna happen that's why it's so
[1:21:21] important to have a a
[1:21:23] right heart a prepared heart jesus
[1:21:24] himself told us that there were
[1:21:26] four different types of ground four
[1:21:29] different types of attitude four
[1:21:30] different
[1:21:31] types of heart conditions
[1:21:34] and he only responds to the one
[1:21:38] that's good ground no matter if the
[1:21:42] other ones were christians
[1:21:45] right because they heard the word they
[1:21:46] rejoiced they said amen with the word
[1:21:48] but after a while they got offended
[1:21:56] paul gave the same counsel in romans
[1:21:58] chapter 12
[1:21:59] verse 1 that that that he experienced on
[1:22:03] the road to damascus
[1:22:05] he says i beseech you therefore brother
[1:22:07] and by the mercies of god
[1:22:09] that you present your body
[1:22:12] a living sacrifice wow
[1:22:15] now if i was to say i want you to
[1:22:18] present your car
[1:22:19] a sacrifice
[1:22:23] to me
[1:22:27] well we've all seen those
[1:22:31] uh derby shows what are they called
[1:22:33] brother bruce where they go and they
[1:22:34] smash one another
[1:22:37] demolition derby you take your car out
[1:22:39] there and you got a number on it and you
[1:22:41] know after this race that thing is done
[1:22:43] you're not going to revive it and they
[1:22:45] smash one another's car and
[1:22:47] who's ever left going around they're the
[1:22:50] king
[1:22:54] well if you're going to present your
[1:22:56] body a living sacrifice
[1:22:59] don't let satan tell you it's just for
[1:23:01] 60 minutes
[1:23:04] after this i'm going to go do my own
[1:23:06] thing you're missing what church is
[1:23:08] about
[1:23:10] you're missing about what it takes to
[1:23:12] come into the image of god
[1:23:13] amen we need
[1:23:17] to feed with the fear of the lord amen i
[1:23:19] beseech you therefore brother by the
[1:23:21] mercies of god that you present your
[1:23:22] body a
[1:23:23] living sacrifice holy
[1:23:26] and acceptable unto god which is your
[1:23:29] reasonable
[1:23:30] service so pretty much if we're not
[1:23:34] doing that we're giving god unreasonable
[1:23:37] service we're serving him
[1:23:40] but unreasonably
[1:23:44] and be not conformed to this world we
[1:23:46] were on this sunday but be
[1:23:48] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:23:49] that ye may prove what is that good
[1:23:52] and acceptable and perfect will of god
[1:23:55] amen but i wanted to get the verse
[1:23:57] before
[1:23:58] and the verse after for i say through
[1:24:01] the grace given unto me
[1:24:04] to every man that is among you not
[1:24:07] to think of himself more
[1:24:10] highly than he ought to think because
[1:24:13] that's where satan is at right
[1:24:16] but to think soberly according
[1:24:20] as god is doubt to every man the measure
[1:24:22] of faith now what is that
[1:24:24] the voice of god spoken to you
[1:24:25] personally yes amen
[1:24:27] don't if in other words if you haven't
[1:24:29] heard that voice speak to you
[1:24:30] then you don't think highly of it don't
[1:24:33] think
[1:24:34] just stay there until you hear from god
[1:24:37] i know this is clear as anything god
[1:24:40] speaks often and it's not revelation to
[1:24:43] you
[1:24:47] he's trying to get your attention he's
[1:24:50] trying to get you to get in a place
[1:24:52] where you will humble yourself
[1:24:53] and you will listen brother branham says
[1:24:56] if it lines up with the word
[1:24:58] it's him if it dovetails from genesis to
[1:25:02] revelations
[1:25:03] it's him but if it deviates in any way
[1:25:09] so a lot of times god speaks to us it's
[1:25:11] him it's his word
[1:25:12] he's trying to get the message across to
[1:25:14] us amen
[1:25:16] and if it don't come like a boat of
[1:25:18] lightning and shake us and throw us on
[1:25:20] the ground and make us feel
[1:25:21] well probably wasn't god
[1:25:29] but if we're humble lord i need to hear
[1:25:32] from you
[1:25:35] don't think above god's way of thinking
[1:25:41] don't think about it because that's what
[1:25:43] satan did
[1:25:44] yeah even though his was the law was
[1:25:46] thinking
[1:25:47] he says my thoughts are gonna be above
[1:25:49] god's thoughts my throne's gonna be
[1:25:50] about i'm gonna do my will
[1:25:56] and that's how he tries to get us to
[1:25:58] work every day
[1:26:00] second corinthians chapter 10 verse 5
[1:26:03] casting
[1:26:04] down imaginations
[1:26:08] every high thing that exalteth itself
[1:26:11] notice exalted itself
[1:26:14] we're either exalting christ or exalting
[1:26:17] ourself
[1:26:21] and every high thing that exalteth
[1:26:22] itself against look
[1:26:24] the knowledge of god
[1:26:27] and bringing into captivity every
[1:26:30] thought to the obedience of christ
[1:26:34] when god speaks god expects
[1:26:37] obedience
[1:26:42] if we don't believe in that part of the
[1:26:44] gospel
[1:26:45] then we have lost we don't even need
[1:26:48] church
[1:26:51] honestly because this is where we come
[1:26:54] and hear the living word
[1:26:56] speaking to us personally in other words
[1:26:58] we should every one of us should be able
[1:26:59] to walk out of church every time we come
[1:27:01] to church
[1:27:01] and say god spoke to me this i heard
[1:27:03] from god
[1:27:04] it may be one thing it may be a dozen
[1:27:06] things but you've got to hear from god
[1:27:08] when you come to church
[1:27:09] if that's not happening something's
[1:27:11] wrong with you amen
[1:27:13] not god god don't waste your time god
[1:27:18] would never call you here
[1:27:20] and purposely not speak to you when you
[1:27:22] made a sacrifice to come
[1:27:26] brother branham says god wants to give
[1:27:28] us the holy ghost more than we can
[1:27:30] imagine
[1:27:32] talking about all that pressure on the
[1:27:33] bottom of a pipe don't you think he
[1:27:35] wants to reveal himself to you
[1:27:37] and tell you what you need we need the
[1:27:39] mind of christ
[1:27:40] it's not a gift we got to spend time
[1:27:42] seeking and humbling ourselves
[1:27:46] cast down the imaginations that exalt
[1:27:48] itself
[1:27:49] against the knowledge of god and we'll
[1:27:52] know that by trying the spirit we know
[1:27:54] the obvious ones
[1:27:55] the obvious ones when they pop up on
[1:27:58] your phone
[1:28:00] you know the obvious ones commercials on
[1:28:03] tv the obvious ones
[1:28:07] i'm talking about the ones that
[1:28:10] i wonder
[1:28:14] try it try the spirit
[1:28:17] god's way of thinking is extremely
[1:28:20] humble
[1:28:22] in fact he's hiding in humility
[1:28:26] and simplicity they're
[1:28:30] they're right there they're like hand
[1:28:32] and glove
[1:28:36] here's the way that god wants us to
[1:28:38] think let this mind be in you
[1:28:41] that was also in christ jesus
[1:28:43] philippians chapter four verse eight
[1:28:44] finally brethren
[1:28:46] whatsoever things
[1:28:49] are true well that is why
[1:28:53] i listened to fox news in the cities nbc
[1:29:03] the only you know the thing is
[1:29:08] i you must pass
[1:29:12] the test of all these words

[1:29:32] report right what sort of things are
[1:29:34] peer whatsoever things are lovely
[1:29:36] whatsoever things are of a good report
[1:29:41] i want to tell you these are god's high
[1:29:45] thoughts
[1:29:50] these are god's high thoughts these are
[1:29:53] not
[1:29:54] thoughts that god wants you to think and
[1:29:55] he's thinking something different
[1:29:57] this is the mind of god
[1:30:02] if there's any strength or virtue if
[1:30:04] there's any praise
[1:30:06] spend time thinking about it amen amen
[1:30:11] i want to say are you passing have you
[1:30:13] been passing the gospel test
[1:30:15] with your thoughts are you thinking
[1:30:18] on things that are pure and lovely and
[1:30:20] of a good report
[1:30:22] are you thinking of things that are just
[1:30:25] righteous
[1:30:26] pure and holy
[1:30:29] these are the higher thoughts of god
[1:30:33] well brother john you don't know what
[1:30:34] i'm going through and it's just it's
[1:30:35] just a monster of a situation
[1:30:37] and this and i just i think on these
[1:30:40] things

[1:30:45] no exception because it's satan
[1:30:48] trying to give you some more bad news
[1:30:52] if he can get you thinking about how bad
[1:30:54] things are
[1:30:55] he'll keep you down here
[1:31:00] hopeless we need to walk
[1:31:03] with the mind of christ
[1:31:06] the bride knows
[1:31:10] where she stands
[1:31:14] she's got a word for the devil
[1:31:17] it's the word of god it's get behind me

[1:31:26] on these things
[1:31:28] amen i'll tell you it may not change the
[1:31:32] outcome of my situation
[1:31:36] but i want to have a testimony before
[1:31:37] god
[1:31:40] i want about a stand before him one day
[1:31:42] and say
[1:31:43] i did what your word told me to do
[1:31:49] not try to be einstein try to figure out
[1:31:51] well if i do this is it going to make a
[1:31:53] difference
[1:31:55] got to cast that down every one of us
[1:31:58] is guilty every one of us

[1:32:26] give you an expected end
[1:32:27] go and sin no more he's given us an
[1:32:30] opportunity
[1:32:32] amen the correct way of thinking
[1:32:35] the absolute intelligence
[1:32:38] the word of god amen amen
[1:32:42] if the things that you're thinking don't
[1:32:44] move you to give
[1:32:45] god praise and worship stop thinking
[1:32:48] about it

[1:32:51] praise god stop thinking
[1:32:53] well john is real the world's coming to
[1:32:55] i know it

[1:33:00] he inhabits the praises of his people
[1:33:04] well i can't praise him until that's
[1:33:06] like saying i can't pay my tithes until
[1:33:09] i can't follow the word until i can't i
[1:33:11] can't love that person until they make
[1:33:13] it right
[1:33:13] no you can because christ and you can do
[1:33:16] all things
[1:33:16] amen verse nine these things which you
[1:33:21] have both
[1:33:22] learned and received
[1:33:25] and heard and seen in me

[1:33:36] peace shall be with you walking with god
[1:33:39] amen this is how god thinks
[1:33:50] paul writing this he knew he had to give
[1:33:53] up everything

[1:33:58] lord stayed on the word
[1:34:01] he promised to keep you in perfect peace
[1:34:06] i'll say it like this the mind of god is
[1:34:09] not going to be a gift to you
[1:34:12] this message is so much more important
[1:34:13] than you realize
[1:34:17] you have to activate your free more
[1:34:20] agency
[1:34:20] to make a decision on what you're going
[1:34:22] to think about
[1:34:24] and if you choose to keep your mind on
[1:34:26] the right things
[1:34:27] you will be walking with the mind of
[1:34:29] christ it's that simple
[1:34:32] doesn't matter how long you've been in
[1:34:33] the message
[1:34:36] doesn't matter if you're a christian
[1:34:39] it matters that you do what you need to
[1:34:42] do to get the results that you need
[1:34:44] because if you always done what you
[1:34:45] always did you're always going to get
[1:34:46] what you always got
[1:34:49] it's powerful to change the way that you
[1:34:53] think
[1:34:53] yeah for the better for the better if
[1:34:55] you're if you're if you're
[1:34:56] on cloud nine and you're winning souls
[1:34:59] and you're
[1:35:00] happy you you can't wait till the doors
[1:35:02] are open and all those positive things
[1:35:04] are going to
[1:35:04] i say stay the course but it
[1:35:08] ain't happening change the way you're
[1:35:09] thinking you're listening too much bad
[1:35:10] news listen to the devil too much
[1:35:13] we need to walk in this hour with the
[1:35:15] mind of christ

[1:35:24] god wants us walking with the mind of
[1:35:26] christ
[1:35:38] amen praise the lord
[1:35:41] amen let's go before the lord in prayer
[1:35:45] amen let's just close our eyes for a
[1:35:48] moment bow our head and
[1:35:49] maybe there's something on your your
[1:35:52] heart that you're desiring
[1:35:56] lift that before the lord god sees your
[1:35:59] heart and desire
[1:36:01] for him to come and just meet that need
[1:36:16] brother brandon
[1:36:20] talked about the effectual fervent
[1:36:22] prayer
[1:36:23] or i'm sorry he said that the right
[1:36:26] mental attitude
[1:36:28] will bring any divine promise of god to
[1:36:31] pass
[1:36:32] god honors the right way of thinking
[1:36:41] i want us just to turn off
[1:36:44] all the negative thoughts all the
[1:36:47] judgmental thoughts
[1:36:50] all the selfish thoughts all the
[1:36:53] thoughts i'm going to do things my way
[1:36:58] just humble yourself before the lord
[1:37:00] today
[1:37:02] and my my reason
[1:37:08] is because i really want god to exalt
[1:37:11] you in due time
[1:37:13] to lift you up into heavenly places
[1:37:17] i know if we do our part god promised to
[1:37:20] do his

[1:38:08] your mind and your spirit that
[1:38:10] other people could see that you're alive
[1:38:12] today

[1:38:16] out of the tomb and

[1:38:54] that can help us for the rest of our
[1:38:56] lives

[1:39:00] to practices we've accepted the things
[1:39:02] that you spoke to us lord
[1:39:03] to put those in practice even just in
[1:39:06] our thoughts lord
[1:39:07] that only you know about that our
[1:39:10] thoughts could become more positive

[1:39:34] to see whether it's of you or the devil
[1:39:36] trying to trick us and bring us down
[1:39:41] lord i pray that you give each one of us
[1:39:43] a greater portion of your holy spirit
[1:39:46] that we may stand against the wiles of
[1:39:48] the devil
