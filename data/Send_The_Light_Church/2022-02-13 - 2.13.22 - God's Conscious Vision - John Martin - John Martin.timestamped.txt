[5:18] our lord and savior we ask you amen
[5:21] amen philippians chapter 2 starting with
[5:24] verse number one
[5:26] if there be therefore any consolation in
[5:29] christ if any comfort of love if any
[5:31] fellowship of the spirit if any bowels
[5:34] and mercies fulfill ye my joy that ye be
[5:38] like
[5:40] minded
[5:41] having the same love and being of one
[5:43] accord and of one mind
[5:46] let nothing be done through strife or
[5:47] vain glory but in lowliness of mind let
[5:50] each esteem other
[5:53] better than themselves
[5:55] look not every man on his own things but
[5:58] every man also on the things of others
[6:01] let this mind be in you which was also
[6:04] in christ jesus
[6:06] who being in the form of god he thought
[6:09] it not robbery to be equal with god but
[6:12] he made himself of no reputation
[6:15] and took upon him the form of a servant
[6:19] and was made in the likeness of men and
[6:21] being found in fashionism and he humbled
[6:24] himself and became obedient unto death
[6:26] even the death of the cross god bless
[6:29] you may be seated
[6:33] notice here this the description of
[6:36] jesus
[6:38] he that he made himself with no
[6:39] reputation he became a servant he was
[6:42] made in the likeness of man he humbled
[6:44] himself he came these are
[6:47] the characteristics of god
[6:50] they're not just god is different than
[6:53] christ
[6:54] they're they're one and the same
[6:57] and uh
[7:02] want to
[7:03] get back into a series
[7:06] that we started actually back in
[7:09] december 19
[7:11] of 2021 was almost two months ago we did
[7:14] part one of
[7:16] god's conscious
[7:18] series
[7:19] and so
[7:23] to be god conscious is not only to have
[7:26] the thoughts of god or the same opinion
[7:28] or the same idea that god has but it
[7:31] means to be like god the process of
[7:34] those thoughts and making them manifest
[7:39] it's easy to say yes the mind of christ
[7:41] is to be a servant
[7:43] and it's another thing to live your life
[7:45] as a servant
[7:49] the mind of christ
[7:52] in one way could be oh i know that what
[7:54] christ would do would would esteem the
[7:57] other better than the self and that
[7:59] would be the mind of christ because i
[8:01] read that in the word but if i have the
[8:04] mind of christ i will be doing that if i
[8:07] don't have the mind of christ i'll just
[8:09] be stating what the mind of christ does
[8:14] so
[8:15] on december 19th i made a statement
[8:18] that statement was through these the
[8:21] series god will provide us all an
[8:24] opportunity to become more god conscious
[8:29] not just the knowledge of the truth now
[8:32] but in our behavior how we handle things
[8:35] and that's what this purpose is this
[8:37] this is about so we can we don't have to
[8:41] guess
[8:42] what the will of the lord is
[8:45] when we have the mind of the lord we
[8:47] have we know what to do with the
[8:49] situation
[8:54] we established that we can
[8:56] number one
[8:58] let this mind be in you that was in
[8:59] christ we established that it can happen
[9:02] you just got to believe it it's got to
[9:04] start with the faith
[9:06] but how do we let it brother john
[9:10] you see
[9:11] and we will see all the opportunities of
[9:14] how
[9:15] we let the mind of christ be in us
[9:18] through humility
[9:21] you'll you'll never see it outside of
[9:24] that it will only be through humility
[9:26] that will ever become more god-conscious
[9:29] brother random told us
[9:31] made this statement
[9:33] he said that we should always have a
[9:36] spirit that says i could be wrong now a
[9:38] lot of times we'll use those words
[9:41] i could be wrong
[9:42] but never have the spirit i could be
[9:44] wrong
[9:45] so we we need to have a spirit of i
[9:48] could be wrong and that's the only way
[9:51] that you'll you'll serve one another and
[9:53] esteem one another and not uh vaunteth
[9:56] yourself and and talk about yourself
[10:00] when
[10:01] when you see a man with confidence
[10:06] you you tend to
[10:09] look at them as somebody that has
[10:12] something
[10:13] right you see somebody who doesn't have
[10:16] confidence in their self they they're
[10:18] wishy-washy they're up and down it's
[10:21] kind of hard to have confidence in that
[10:28] but there is a a difference
[10:30] between god and the man
[10:34] when you
[10:35] brother brown talks about uh or the
[10:37] bible talks about david being small and
[10:40] ruddy and and a lot of people picture
[10:44] samson is some big strong guy he was he
[10:47] was small
[10:49] and jesus brother brandon said jesus was
[10:51] small but brother brother branham was
[10:54] small
[10:55] so there was nothing outwardly that we
[10:57] should behold some greatness
[11:01] but yet they possessed a power that was
[11:04] so strong inside of them it was the
[11:06] power of god
[11:08] so it's one thing when god
[11:11] is speaking through us and it's another
[11:14] thing when we're trying to mimic god
[11:17] and it's really not god
[11:20] so i say it like this always have a
[11:23] spirit that i could be wrong
[11:26] we also stated that the mind of christ
[11:28] will always be pressing
[11:30] us to manifest all of god it won't get
[11:33] to a place to say where been there done
[11:36] that that's behind me
[11:38] or i've attained
[11:39] it'll always be as paul express of
[11:42] pressing towards a mark
[11:44] no matter how long you've been serving
[11:46] no matter what he achieved
[11:48] no matter what the credentials
[11:50] it was doing the same thing at the end
[11:52] that he was doing at the beginning
[11:55] being found faithful being born again
[11:58] doesn't just have a beginning then it's
[12:01] all over and we're born again
[12:03] like we we state to one another have you
[12:05] been born again yes i'm born again as as
[12:07] if we got the credentials now
[12:10] we may mention that being born again has
[12:12] a beginning and it has a process and we
[12:14] should never think that it has an end
[12:16] for us
[12:18] it'll be over when god says it's over
[12:21] but we can't see in the scriptures where
[12:23] it ever describes that uh we're there
[12:28] and we had a prophet that came that
[12:36] resolved all the issues all the
[12:38] mysteries all the questions and made it
[12:40] real clear
[12:41] the truth of the word
[12:44] and yet he taught us in the message
[12:46] press towards that image press towards
[12:48] that
[12:51] and i believe that's if we just focus on
[12:53] that we'll be
[12:55] better off
[12:59] so we're going to just take our time
[13:00] we're not going to get through uh even
[13:01] part two today isn't that funny we're
[13:03] not going to get through part two
[13:05] but we just want to take our time
[13:07] and
[13:09] it's been two months since we got
[13:12] we started this
[13:14] philippians 2 5 says let this mind be in
[13:17] you which was also in christ jesus
[13:21] the mind of christ could be defined
[13:23] therefore through the scriptures as a
[13:26] humble obedient mind that serves the
[13:30] master's plan
[13:32] the master plan of god
[13:35] humble obedient and serves the master
[13:38] plan of god because that's what jesus
[13:40] was described as having the mind uh that
[13:43] was uh
[13:45] uh that was in christ jesus
[13:48] so there's no he didn't have thoughts of
[13:50] vain glory or that he was better than
[13:55] others
[13:56] and in fact
[13:57] when he was washing the feet of his
[13:59] disciples
[14:01] he says you call me master and lord so i
[14:05] am it's the truth
[14:07] just like when he was there
[14:09] are you the king of the jews well who
[14:11] says that
[14:12] he was
[14:14] but he didn't brag about it he says but
[14:16] if i
[14:18] am your lord and i am your
[14:22] uh
[14:23] your master
[14:25] if i'm gonna serve you and wash your
[14:27] feet who are you to think anything
[14:30] different anything higher than that
[14:33] you should you should do the same thing
[14:36] you should have the same mind
[14:41] so there's no consciousness of esteeming
[14:43] ourselves
[14:44] or building our own reputation
[14:47] it's not
[14:48] about us
[14:50] jesus always glorified the father and
[14:52] our thought should be about glorifying
[14:53] the father
[14:58] he did those things which only pleased
[15:00] the father
[15:02] the mind of god was in christ
[15:06] and paul is saying to us
[15:08] let it be in us
[15:10] just transfer it to us
[15:13] wouldn't it be nice if we could just go
[15:14] to as it were the library and check out
[15:16] a book
[15:18] just you know get the mind of christ
[15:20] like that
[15:22] you know every man's right in his own
[15:24] eyes so so many people think they've got
[15:25] the mind of christ just by default
[15:28] by the thought by pride basically
[15:32] in the beginning
[15:34] we were in the mind of god brother brahm
[15:37] taught us
[15:39] we were a part of god's eternal thoughts
[15:42] and god said in jeremiah 29 11 for i
[15:44] know the thoughts i think towards you
[15:46] saith the lord their thoughts of peace
[15:48] they're not of evil and to give you an
[15:50] unexpected end
[15:53] so god had a vision for our end how we
[15:56] would end up
[15:58] we could say also that god thinks
[16:00] thoughts of peace
[16:03] the way he thinks the mind of god is is
[16:06] thinking peace
[16:08] it's not always he never went around
[16:10] trying to oh i'm going to prove all the
[16:12] pharisees and the sadducees and how they
[16:14] were wrong and they should he listened
[16:17] to me you know he didn't do that
[16:21] he's a peaceful thinker
[16:24] and i'll say it like this the bible says
[16:25] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[16:28] shall be called the children of god they
[16:29] got the mind of god
[16:31] amen
[16:34] we on the other hand
[16:36] are
[16:38] usually in a temporal state of mind our
[16:41] thinking
[16:43] therefore we look at what's going on in
[16:46] our present life
[16:48] or who we're talking to at the moment
[16:51] when we look at others we usually look
[16:53] at them in a 2d fashion like a picture
[16:57] you see only part of their lives
[17:00] we usually don't think about the things
[17:02] that are going on in their lives what
[17:03] they're going through
[17:05] brother brahm talked about putting
[17:07] ourselves in somebody else's shoes so we
[17:09] can kind of feel what's going on
[17:15] but we
[17:16] but when we look at situations in a 3d
[17:19] perspective we can see
[17:21] more clearly what's going on
[17:24] 3d is you you you see like when you look
[17:27] at this picture here you see
[17:29] basically a front view of jesus
[17:33] just say right now of a person but
[17:36] but when you look at me
[17:38] you know you see 3d
[17:40] you're seeing all of me
[17:43] well our mind
[17:44] functions in a 2d
[17:47] thought pattern
[17:49] i
[17:50] we look at how we're dressed and we look
[17:52] at the things that are being said
[17:55] and maybe what we heard about somebody
[18:00] but when god looks at us
[18:02] well that word is a discern of the
[18:04] thoughts intents of the heart that that
[18:06] he sees everything he knows every
[18:08] thought in fact he told brother branham
[18:11] that our thoughts speak louder in heaven
[18:14] than our words do on earth and
[18:17] and he he could know that even though uh
[18:19] the the the
[18:21] the pharisees with their lips they
[18:23] worshipped him their heart was far from
[18:25] them amen because god sees and his mind
[18:30] is in a 3d
[18:32] uh perspective the bible says that god's
[18:35] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[18:39] they're a higher perspective
[18:42] he sees things before they happen
[18:47] so we could say that his thoughts or his
[18:50] vision encompasses eternity
[18:54] that's why he could predestinate us
[18:56] according to foreknowledge because he
[18:58] sees such 3d he knows what's going to
[19:00] happen next week
[19:02] before it ever happens
[19:05] he sees all things before it happens
[19:08] therefore the mind of christ is
[19:10] constantly in continuity of god's
[19:13] eternal vision
[19:14] amen
[19:18] remember
[19:19] jesus saying in matthew chapter 5 verse
[19:21] 19
[19:23] he says verily verily i say unto you the
[19:26] son can do nothing of himself but what
[19:29] he seeth the father do
[19:32] for whatsoever
[19:33] what what things so ever he doeth these
[19:36] also do it the sun likewise amen
[19:41] remember when jesus said i must needs go
[19:44] by samaria
[19:46] he was walking
[19:48] in god's eternal vision
[19:52] he was walking in the mind of god and
[19:55] even when brother bryan would have a
[19:56] vision and he knew it was absolutely the
[19:59] truth
[20:00] but there was a time
[20:03] that had to wait before it came to pass
[20:08] and
[20:09] a lot of times we're thinking
[20:12] well i did this i did this it should be
[20:14] happening right now
[20:16] and we don't
[20:17] encompass
[20:19] god's timing
[20:23] i do nothing except the father show me
[20:25] first
[20:26] the bible talks about waiting on the
[20:28] lord
[20:30] brother branham taught us when you you
[20:32] think you received the holy ghost he
[20:34] says you stay there
[20:36] and you wait longer
[20:38] and you you you wait to receive more and
[20:42] then when you think you got it you
[20:44] wait longer and you seek him more and
[20:47] then when you think you got he said stay
[20:49] there longer
[20:51] because
[20:52] as soon as you come up here to start
[20:54] seeking more of god i guarantee the
[20:57] devil is going to be working on your
[20:59] shoulder and telling you you ain't going
[21:01] to get it
[21:03] and then after you say i am staying here
[21:05] i am going to get you know he's going to
[21:07] tell you you got it now
[21:09] you got it now
[21:11] because he don't want you serious with
[21:13] god
[21:14] he don't want you humbling yourself
[21:16] before god he don't want you calling on
[21:19] god
[21:20] seeking knocking asking because he's in
[21:23] trouble when your will unites with god's
[21:26] will
[21:27] amen
[21:32] god had a desire for fellowship
[21:35] with his own kind amen there wasn't any
[21:38] no matter the angels and how great and
[21:41] the holy holy and the recognition of of
[21:44] god's greatness
[21:45] was constantly coming before him in
[21:47] praise and adoration which it should
[21:50] i believe it's still happening in heaven
[21:53] there was still something in the heart
[21:55] of god that he longed for fellowship of
[21:59] his own kind
[22:02] in genesis chapter 1 verse 26 the bible
[22:04] says let us
[22:06] make man
[22:07] in our image after our
[22:10] likeness amen verse 27 so god created
[22:14] man in his own image and in the image of
[22:17] god created he him both male and female
[22:20] created he
[22:21] them
[22:23] so here he was
[22:24] he decides that he's going to make a
[22:27] creation that's going to be after his
[22:30] image and after his likeness
[22:34] it wasn't just
[22:36] he's a man
[22:42] but it was the same image
[22:44] the same lightness the same character
[22:47] the same mind
[22:49] handling things the same way
[22:51] in a 3d perspective
[22:54] not
[22:56] well i want to bet on the races and i
[22:58] want to do this and i want to do that
[22:59] and i got this going on and
[23:02] no
[23:03] after his likeness
[23:06] his image his will
[23:10] we know man obviously fell
[23:12] from that image and likeness in the
[23:14] garden
[23:15] amen
[23:16] but god's desire for man to be in his
[23:19] image never did fall
[23:24] he still wants it it's in the forefront
[23:26] of his mind if i could say it like that
[23:30] in fact romans 8 29 declares that that
[23:33] certain believers have been
[23:35] predestinated to be conformed back to
[23:38] that very same image
[23:39] that he had in the garden
[23:43] god is going to have a bride
[23:45] not only washed in his blood
[23:47] but washed by the word amen
[23:52] one thing that's our trust in calvary
[23:53] and it's another thing to prove it by
[23:55] when the word is being preached just to
[23:57] say be it unto me according to thy word
[24:01] she's going to be without spot without
[24:02] wrinkle or any such thing
[24:05] this bride will be in the same image
[24:08] that adam
[24:09] originally was created in
[24:13] she will have the same character of god
[24:15] we're taught by the prophet
[24:17] bride will willingly take on the
[24:19] responsibility of making herself ready
[24:23] she's not going to throw it off on god
[24:27] and every man that has this hope the
[24:28] bible says in him purifyeth himself
[24:32] even as he's already pure
[24:36] brother branham said character will
[24:38] never be gifted to us
[24:42] it's not a gift
[24:44] we all got gifts
[24:50] we didn't work for them we didn't earn
[24:52] them
[24:54] we didn't do something to get them
[24:58] but character is different
[25:00] it's not given to any man
[25:04] it's it's something
[25:06] that you choose in the middle of a
[25:08] battle
[25:10] to be a humble
[25:11] servant
[25:13] obedient to what the master has told us
[25:16] to do
[25:19] and it's easy to say
[25:23] yes god wants me to do this and god
[25:25] wants me to do that but you get in a
[25:27] trial and somebody's fussing and
[25:29] fighting with you well then it really
[25:31] comes
[25:32] real
[25:34] it's where the rubber meets the road to
[25:36] where if you've got character or not
[25:40] if you're gonna handle that situation
[25:43] exactly with the mind of christ
[25:46] or are you going to prove your right or
[25:49] prove they're wrong are we going to
[25:52] strife and vain glory and reputation and
[25:55] you can't do that to me and
[25:57] are we just going to simply have the
[25:59] character of christ
[26:01] so we see that the character is never
[26:04] gifted to us
[26:06] we'll have to fight our flesh and
[26:09] overcome it to get the character or the
[26:12] image of christ
[26:14] now i'm not worried about the devil
[26:18] he's no match for my god
[26:21] in fact he was already defeated at
[26:23] calvary
[26:25] so i'm not worried about the devil i am
[26:27] worried about myself
[26:29] my greatest enemy the one who doesn't
[26:32] want to be humble who doesn't want to
[26:34] submit to the word who doesn't want to
[26:37] lower himself and esteem others better
[26:40] that's who i'm worried about because
[26:42] that's the guy that can keep me out of
[26:44] the rapture
[26:45] amen
[26:47] and that's why we need the mind of
[26:49] christ
[26:52] i don't know if i'll get to it today but
[26:56] there's just something about that spirit
[26:59] of pushing predestination
[27:04] it does more harm than good
[27:08] no matter how much i'm predestinated
[27:10] seed of god i must at some fashion
[27:14] sometime i must get the character of
[27:16] christ or i'm not going
[27:20] so we can talk about predestination and
[27:22] how much we're seed but if we never get
[27:25] the character it really doesn't matter
[27:28] it's like who are we trying to convince
[27:34] first john chapter 3 verse 2 says but
[27:36] beloved now are we the sons of god and
[27:38] does not yet appear what we shall be but
[27:40] we know
[27:42] when he shall appear
[27:44] we shall be like him
[27:47] for we shall see him as he is so so when
[27:49] he appears do we just say i'm seen i'm
[27:51] in the message
[27:53] i believe the prophet
[27:55] oh
[27:56] i'm like him
[27:59] that's the
[28:00] criteria
[28:02] now when we look at this part of the
[28:04] scripture when he shall appear
[28:06] it really could have a compound meaning
[28:09] one referring to when jesus returns to
[28:12] catch his bride away
[28:13] we're going to be like him
[28:15] or the other is when jesus returns to
[28:18] open the word to us every time we come
[28:19] to church
[28:21] and we accept that word into our heart
[28:25] that we're going to become more like him
[28:30] second corinthians chapter 3 verse 17
[28:32] now the lord is that spirit and where
[28:35] the spirit of the lord is there is
[28:37] liberty so when we come to church yes
[28:39] we're here but a lot of times we come
[28:41] with a thousand different motives
[28:45] but god is looking for liberty because
[28:47] he's interested in one thing not the 2d
[28:49] stuff going on in her life
[28:51] if that's all he was interested in he
[28:53] would never say seek ye first the
[28:54] kingdom
[28:56] he wants us to come seeking the kingdom
[28:58] first
[29:00] and it's just not the knowledge of how
[29:02] great and vast everything's happening in
[29:05] the mission world
[29:07] but what's going on in our life
[29:10] the kingdom that's going on in their
[29:12] life what is he have in his way
[29:16] so verse 18 now says but we all
[29:19] with open face
[29:21] beholding when we come to church as in
[29:24] a glass the glory of the lord that's in
[29:27] the opening of the word now
[29:30] we are changed
[29:32] into the same image
[29:35] of god
[29:36] from glory
[29:38] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[29:42] lord
[29:45] we're changed from
[29:47] this situation
[29:49] where the glory of god
[29:52] came upon us revealed to us what we need
[29:55] to do we accepted it we go out with
[29:58] strength to lay down our life
[30:01] to manifest the character
[30:04] that god just told us about last service
[30:08] and we're changed
[30:10] the bible says
[30:12] into the same image
[30:14] not a one-shot deal
[30:16] character is not a gift
[30:18] we're not born again one day and the
[30:21] next day we don't have to think about
[30:22] the rest of our life we're changed from
[30:25] glory unto glory here a little there a
[30:27] little we're growing into the statue of
[30:29] a perfect man we're adding
[30:32] to our faith uh a
[30:34] temperance and patience and all these
[30:37] things till we come to that statue of
[30:39] the perfect image the masterpiece of
[30:41] jesus christ
[30:46] now god has a vision for our lives we
[30:48] might say it's god's conscious vision
[30:53] we've been predestined to be changed
[30:55] into his image
[30:57] now without god's vision
[31:00] we will perish
[31:02] in other words if god just says
[31:05] i'm going to have a human race i'm going
[31:07] to die for them we'll see who
[31:09] you know just whoever gets into my image
[31:12] they're going to you know make it
[31:14] and who don't
[31:17] if god didn't have a vision for you and
[31:19] i we would never make it
[31:22] a lot of times we go through the course
[31:24] of a time and we don't even think about
[31:26] god we don't think about his will we
[31:28] don't think about am i doing things
[31:30] displeasing to you should i be doing
[31:33] better lord
[31:35] and god reminds us and shows us and
[31:38] knocks on our heart and says what's
[31:40] going on here
[31:41] when uh
[31:43] i think david said when you spoke to my
[31:47] heart and you said when god said seek ye
[31:50] my face my my heart said unto me thy
[31:52] face well i seek there's an obedience to
[31:56] the call of god
[32:00] so god has a vision for us and without
[32:02] that vision we would perish
[32:04] now what's important
[32:06] is that we must have
[32:08] that vision for us as well
[32:11] we must unite with that vision
[32:13] we must
[32:15] consciously possess god's mind or vision
[32:18] for our lives
[32:20] can't lose track of that
[32:23] now before i get more into that vision i
[32:26] want to also make this statement
[32:29] that satan has a vision for your life as
[32:31] well
[32:35] he wants to take his image
[32:37] just like god does
[32:39] and put it in you
[32:45] there's a very reason that god started
[32:48] out and said
[32:50] you must be born again or you can't even
[32:52] understand what's going on in heaven
[32:57] because we were born with such a
[33:00] basically the opposite of our opening
[33:02] scripture it wasn't humble
[33:05] didn't want to serve it only cared about
[33:07] itself it's i ca i want a a number one
[33:10] record i i want to be the best boxer i
[33:12] want to be the best football player
[33:14] super bowl on tonight so i can say that
[33:16] or whatever it's not i don't even know
[33:18] what to sign
[33:20] but the point is our our our natural
[33:22] life wants
[33:24] to be first
[33:29] and we got
[33:30] to die out to that and be born again
[33:33] with
[33:34] the the spirit of god
[33:37] the nature of god the character of god
[33:40] and and it don't happen through just
[33:41] church attendance and it don't happen by
[33:43] just uh uh repenting and getting
[33:46] baptized and then it's all done and then
[33:48] we just come and we we hear we listen to
[33:50] tapes and and and somehow we put forth
[33:52] little efforts and somehow we get there
[33:54] i'm sorry it won't be there jesus told
[33:56] us we need to strive we need to strive
[34:00] because this nature is constantly warned
[34:04] against us every day we need to deny
[34:06] ourself every day pick up our cross
[34:08] simple it's the only way that will
[34:10] develop the image and the character of
[34:12] jesus christ
[34:16] amen
[34:17] now the image of lucifer was described
[34:19] in ezekiel 28 15 as
[34:22] as perfect in the beginning
[34:25] but he chose not to obey
[34:28] the bible says that thou was perfect
[34:32] in thy ways from the day
[34:35] thou was created
[34:37] till iniquity was found in thee
[34:43] so the image of satan
[34:45] is
[34:46] described as
[34:49] a knowledge of good and evil right it's
[34:52] a tree of knowledge of good and evil
[34:54] and james 4 17 says therefore to him
[34:58] that know what to do good and to do with
[35:00] it not
[35:03] to him
[35:04] it is sin
[35:07] so it is the same image
[35:09] of lucifer
[35:11] when a human being knows the right thing
[35:13] to do and chooses not to do it
[35:17] we become
[35:18] more in the image of lucifer
[35:21] i believe it was david he said in in
[35:24] psalms 51 somewhere i was aborned in sin
[35:27] i was shapen in iniquity
[35:31] it was part of my makeup i was born in
[35:33] this condition
[35:35] to do what i wanted to do instead of
[35:38] what the will of god was for my life
[35:44] genesis chapter 2 verse 17 says the tree
[35:47] of knowledge of good and evil
[35:52] john martin's definition
[35:55] of the tree of knowledge of good and
[35:56] evil is possessing the knowledge of
[35:58] god's will and choosing not to do it
[36:03] and they couldn't partake of that tree
[36:06] they only did it once caused everything
[36:08] that every suffering that ever has
[36:10] transpired in the world and yet somehow
[36:13] that same spirit comes around us and
[36:16] says it's not a big deal if i
[36:19] it's not a big deal if
[36:24] because god knows you're a seed you god
[36:26] knows you're predestinated
[36:31] god's trying to develop his image his
[36:33] character
[36:36] which is to do the same thing that god
[36:38] would do
[36:39] are you with me
[36:42] that's why the prophet said when we
[36:44] when we come to church he says we will
[36:46] never ever leave church the same way we
[36:49] came in
[36:51] i don't know about you
[36:53] i don't know how many times
[36:55] i sat in church
[36:57] and thought what did i get out of that
[37:03] or
[37:04] what's
[37:05] why should i have even came
[37:10] or thoughts of
[37:11] boy that was a good service i enjoyed
[37:13] this i enjoyed that
[37:16] but in reality
[37:18] we when we make a conscious decision to
[37:22] to come before the judgment seat of
[37:24] christ
[37:27] where his word is being spoken
[37:31] we will never leave the doors the same
[37:33] way we came in
[37:35] never
[37:39] it don't matter what we're thinking
[37:40] about the service
[37:42] whether we felt it didn't feel it end
[37:44] out that don't matter
[37:47] the truth of the matter is
[37:49] you will hear god's word
[37:52] you will heal you will hear the will of
[37:54] god for your life
[37:56] and
[37:57] if you choose to say be it unto me
[38:01] according that word
[38:02] i'm going to live that word i'm going to
[38:04] apply it to my life when i leave the
[38:06] service
[38:09] the brother man says you will be closer
[38:12] drawn to the lord
[38:14] but if you know the will of god as it's
[38:17] presented
[38:19] and you choose not to adhere to it you
[38:22] don't put your heart to it
[38:25] no matter how you feel
[38:28] you will be further away from god than
[38:30] when you came in those doors
[38:33] the thing is we don't think it we don't
[38:35] feel those things but the truth of the
[38:37] matter is you can't get any favor with
[38:40] god by rejecting his word
[38:51] we see the image of lucifer
[38:53] we see the image of satan he
[38:56] he wants us to come
[38:58] into church hear the word and choose not
[39:01] to do it
[39:03] revelations 12 9 says that old serpent
[39:05] called the devil and satan
[39:08] all the same image
[39:12] the same devil that was in the garden
[39:14] is in the world today
[39:16] and what is he doing he's deceiving the
[39:18] world
[39:21] he's deceiving everyone
[39:23] to take his image
[39:26] we look and say oh the world's going
[39:28] crazy
[39:30] you can't hardly hear any news and say
[39:32] i can't believe it's getting worse
[39:35] every week every month every year
[39:38] things are getting worse
[39:41] why is it
[39:43] why isn't satan
[39:44] satisfied
[39:46] with just
[39:48] keeping
[39:49] a man from becoming born again why can't
[39:52] he just be satisfied that they're born
[39:54] in sin shape and iniquity uh
[39:58] and just just go on and live a halfway
[40:00] decent life without without hurting one
[40:02] another and killing one another and and
[40:05] and and and changing all the
[40:07] their agendas not their agendas their
[40:10] their their genders
[40:11] [Laughter]
[40:13] why does he keep wanting to blow nations
[40:16] up and and kill and murder and do why
[40:22] because there's something in
[40:24] satan that wants to see
[40:27] him the full image of his evil and
[40:31] hatefulness so manifested in humanity
[40:36] he wants to see his image
[40:39] inside every human being
[40:43] just like god is not satisfied with us
[40:46] being saved
[40:49] i'm predestined
[40:51] i'm going i'm elected i'm going in the
[40:53] no he wants to see his image manifested
[40:56] in his bride and he will not stop and
[40:59] she will not stop until it's manifested
[41:04] you see why when we come to church how
[41:06] our flesh hates to hear the word that
[41:09] challenges it
[41:12] hates it abhors it
[41:14] makes excuses he can't live it
[41:17] no you can't live it but god can in you
[41:20] if he did it for someone he'll do it for
[41:22] you
[41:24] he overcame in somebody's else's life he
[41:27] can overcome in your life
[41:29] but it's about getting serious with god
[41:33] not being satisfied with just coming to
[41:34] church doing our
[41:36] our our duty
[41:39] but becoming more serious with god
[41:48] satan is anti-god
[41:51] and his whole vision is to see the whole
[41:54] world in the very same image of himself
[41:59] we've all talked about it and heard
[42:01] about it how the antichrist is is going
[42:04] to just be so evil
[42:07] but
[42:08] remember
[42:09] he has the ability to look
[42:13] like the hero
[42:18] revelations 13 17
[42:21] says that no man
[42:23] might buy or sell save he that are the
[42:25] mark
[42:26] the name of the beast
[42:30] the number of his name
[42:32] we're talking about a mark
[42:34] a name
[42:35] or a number all the same
[42:37] can't buy herself
[42:39] here is wisdom let him that have
[42:40] understanding count the number of the
[42:43] beast
[42:45] where's the number of a man
[42:47] and now the beast and the man are the
[42:50] same
[42:51] and his number is
[42:53] 603 score and six
[42:59] we've been
[43:00] schooled we understand
[43:02] if we take the roman numerals
[43:06] of the vicarious philly idea
[43:09] dili
[43:10] dei
[43:12] should have it up there on the board so
[43:13] you can know how it's really
[43:17] how it really is instead of the way i'm
[43:19] saying it
[43:21] writtens there in the vatican
[43:23] somewhere
[43:27] it doesn't matter it's something that
[43:31] they believe and what it means is
[43:33] instead of christ vicarious means
[43:35] substituting for or in place of philia
[43:38] means sun and
[43:40] delay de la
[43:42] means god
[43:44] so it means
[43:46] instead of the son of god
[43:51] and that the pope believes that he's uh
[43:52] i had a catholic place tell me one time
[43:56] that that the the pope has the power to
[43:59] change the word of god and at that
[44:00] moment something inside of me said whoa
[44:03] whoa son just didn't it didn't click
[44:05] with me
[44:08] before i came into the message that was
[44:10] that happened
[44:12] but if you take the roman numerals of
[44:14] this instead of christ
[44:17] instead of the son of god
[44:19] it adds up to hundred
[44:22] three scoring six six six six
[44:26] now the bible tells us it's the same
[44:28] number
[44:28] uh as man man was was created on the
[44:32] sixth day
[44:36] so it's not just
[44:38] the pope instead of christ
[44:41] it's man
[44:42] man's will
[44:44] instead of christ
[44:45] exalting
[44:47] himself
[44:48] above what the will of god is for his
[44:50] life
[44:53] see how
[44:54] deceptive satan
[44:56] has to be in a church
[45:02] to get
[45:03] a man a religious man not to do the will
[45:07] of god
[45:09] and one great way is
[45:12] to believe so much that you're
[45:13] predestinated that that's all that
[45:16] matters
[45:19] i mean can we just shelf that thing
[45:22] have we heard enough about it
[45:25] no one the prophet said we need to stay
[45:27] away from that preachers need to stay it
[45:28] confuses the people well one of
[45:30] preachers preaching about predestination
[45:33] he don't think he's confused in the
[45:34] people and he may not be
[45:36] but satan is
[45:41] it it confuses
[45:44] the people in thinking if i'm
[45:45] predestined and then what do i got to
[45:47] worry about because that's what the
[45:48] preacher says
[45:50] god's going to take you through what do
[45:51] you got to worry about well in one sense
[45:53] i am in the palm of god's hand but in
[45:55] another sense he puts me out there and
[45:57] he gives me a choice to lay down my life
[45:59] and do his will or just to be so
[46:02] pious about i'm a son of god i'm i'm a
[46:05] i'm predestinated it doesn't have to do
[46:07] anything
[46:09] that's what's confusing about it
[46:14] so revelation 12 9 says the great day
[46:17] dragon he deceiveth the whole world he
[46:20] was cast out to the earth and his angels
[46:22] were cast out with him so he he deceives
[46:26] a third of the angels he jesus just sees
[46:29] adam and eve and you know he he
[46:32] he's still going
[46:36] still deceiving
[46:39] turn with me if you would to james
[46:40] chapter 1 verse 21
[46:42] satan is deceiving the church
[46:46] into not having to take the full word of
[46:49] god
[46:53] how many people
[46:55] mandy will come to me in that day and
[46:56] say lord lord didn't i do this do this
[46:59] didn't do that whatever
[47:01] and he says i didn't know you
[47:04] because there was a work of iniquity
[47:06] which simply means
[47:08] knowing to do the right thing
[47:11] and choosing that it's not that big a
[47:13] deal
[47:15] not against it won't preach against it
[47:17] but just for me you know it's not that
[47:19] big a deal god still loves me god's
[47:21] still going to take me through i'm still
[47:22] predestined just because i don't do that
[47:24] it's that attitude
[47:28] that's
[47:29] without the fear of the lord they're not
[47:31] working out their salvation with fear
[47:33] and trembling they're working it out
[47:36] with i know
[47:39] the i know will send more people to hell
[47:42] than anything
[47:46] because see satan takes the knowledge of
[47:49] your good that you know
[47:51] and he says things like
[47:53] god death no
[47:55] you're going to be just like him
[47:58] god knows don't just
[48:00] look don't you rather
[48:03] you know go to heaven and then be able
[48:05] to do what you want in your flesh on
[48:06] earth
[48:09] that's what he offered eve
[48:15] james chapter 1 verse 21 wherefore
[48:18] lay apart all filthiness
[48:20] and superfluity
[48:22] of naughtiness just get rid of that type
[48:25] of thinking
[48:28] and receive
[48:30] with meekness notice not arrogancy
[48:33] but meekness
[48:35] the engrafted word which is able to save
[48:39] your souls
[48:42] now the thing is
[48:44] you might say well brother john i was
[48:46] saved ten years ago
[48:49] well if jesus was here
[48:51] in
[48:52] corporate body what he say to you but my
[48:56] brother my sister my son my daughter
[49:00] don't you realize it's to him that
[49:02] endureth to the end the same is said
[49:05] would he say to you
[49:07] today is the day of salvation i'm
[49:08] bringing you a new word
[49:14] i believe in inserts eternal security
[49:17] i do believe in predestination
[49:20] but i believe in all growing and obeying
[49:23] in the word that's being presented to me
[49:26] you can't just take one and leave the
[49:29] other if you're going to do that take
[49:31] the one where you obey
[49:34] there will be more people who thought
[49:36] they were predestinated and miss it
[49:39] so just believing in predestination and
[49:42] believe in your elected seed does not
[49:44] put you in
[49:50] john said bring forth fruit meat for
[49:52] repentance
[49:55] you don't just repent you just don't get
[49:57] baptized you bring forth fruit
[50:00] god wants to see fruit
[50:02] that we're predestinated
[50:05] that means i'm different today than i
[50:07] was a year ago
[50:09] that means i have grown
[50:11] that means i'm more in his likeness in
[50:13] his image because remember in church
[50:16] satan still has the same desire to see
[50:18] his image in you and it's real simple
[50:21] to get you to think that you don't have
[50:23] to be serious about the word
[50:26] that you've got the most important
[50:28] things handled
[50:30] and everything else is just you know
[50:32] filler
[50:34] some sort of thinking that you can walk
[50:37] out without fear and trembling no god i
[50:40] gotta please you more i heard from
[50:42] heaven i know what you want me to do
[50:44] lord
[50:46] that's why we need to come into church
[50:49] soft meek humble broken he's not god
[50:53] will heal you god will give you his
[50:55] strength
[50:58] but you come in thinking you know enough
[51:01] and you're here for other motives
[51:06] he's deceiving us
[51:09] we're becoming more in the image of
[51:11] lucifer and don't even realize it
[51:16] verse 22 he says but be
[51:19] doers of the word
[51:21] and not
[51:22] hearers
[51:23] only
[51:25] what happens you're deceiving your own
[51:28] self
[51:30] that's exactly the same image of lucifer
[51:34] for if any be a hearer of the word and
[51:36] not a doer
[51:37] he is like
[51:39] like unto a man be holding his natural
[51:42] face in a glass
[51:44] but he beholdeth himself
[51:47] and go straightway out of the doors of
[51:49] the church
[51:51] and he forgets
[51:53] exactly what kind of man he was when he
[51:55] was looking amen
[51:57] just kind of forgot about the word that
[51:59] was preached
[52:01] like you know
[52:02] i must have got what i needed and
[52:05] didn't need i must be okay because i
[52:07] didn't really get anything
[52:08] [Laughter]
[52:13] it's it's
[52:14] it's terrible the attitude
[52:17] but it's not the mind of christ
[52:20] not the conscious mind that god has
[52:26] but whosoever looketh into the perfect
[52:27] law of liberty
[52:30] and continues power from god this is
[52:33] what god wants me to do
[52:37] he being not a forgetful hero but to do
[52:39] of the work this man shall be blessed in
[52:42] his deed in other words this is the man
[52:45] that's going to come into the image of
[52:47] christ
[52:50] he's the one that's going to be changed
[52:52] from glory unto glory he will be blessed
[52:57] if we're interested
[52:59] only or mainly
[53:02] in making it to heaven and not
[53:05] to hell
[53:08] we haven't reached the love affair that
[53:10] needs to make it to get in
[53:17] come to church
[53:19] we ought to be developing our love
[53:21] affair amen
[53:24] we're not just
[53:26] trying to stamp our eternal security
[53:28] deeper and you know drive the stakes in
[53:30] more
[53:33] but developing our love affair
[53:36] he said if you love me keep my
[53:38] commandments
[53:42] a lot of times our flesh don't even want
[53:43] to hear him
[53:45] i got enough to do
[53:47] now i got to do that
[53:48] come on what's this thing all about this
[53:50] thing is about you coming into the image
[53:53] of christ that's what this thing's about
[53:57] it ain't for everybody
[54:00] how many people
[54:03] are literally in church if they really
[54:05] knew what was required of them they
[54:07] would stop going to church
[54:11] but you won't find one person not a
[54:14] single person on the day of judgment
[54:16] that goes to hell that wish
[54:19] he wouldn't have tried harder
[54:22] when he had a chance
[54:26] so what are we up against we're up
[54:28] against our fleshly nature
[54:30] that doesn't want to hear the truth
[54:35] it wants uh to be entertained it
[54:38] wants to be comforted only
[54:41] strengthen
[54:42] tell me how i can get the promises
[54:45] and there's no mindset about the image
[54:48] of christ which really that is what god
[54:50] has for us
[54:53] i personally
[54:54] could never come up with the thought you
[54:57] know
[54:58] healing i mean what healing is just the
[55:00] bait on the hook
[55:03] i'm sorry
[55:05] that to me seems harsh
[55:11] it's not the main thing that god wants
[55:13] from us is to heal us and to see us
[55:15] prosper in our health
[55:17] but he wants to see our soul prospered
[55:20] that's what he's after
[55:22] it's the relationship the healing just
[55:24] got your attention hey now that you're
[55:26] you're feeling real good and praising
[55:28] god god brought you through this now i
[55:30] want something to talk to you i want to
[55:31] talk to you about a relationship i want
[55:33] my image to be seen in you
[55:39] this is where the majority of the people
[55:43] are satisfied with the loaves
[55:45] the fishes
[55:47] the healings
[55:49] the natural needs taken care of
[55:53] and aren't interested in that love
[55:54] affair
[55:56] because truly to love god you know this
[55:58] you you that are married
[55:59] when you think about i need to love my
[56:01] spouse more you're you automatically
[56:04] think
[56:05] humbling myself
[56:06] giving myself over
[56:08] pleasing the other
[56:11] right
[56:11] when you think about the responsibility
[56:14] of loving your spouse more it's that
[56:16] relationship part
[56:19] no different with god
[56:22] it's no different with god god is
[56:24] interested in the relationship
[56:31] all right
[56:33] i just want to finish that last verse if
[56:35] any man among you seem to be religious
[56:36] and bright on out his tongue
[56:40] but he deceiveth his own heart
[56:42] this man's religion is vain now he don't
[56:45] believe that
[56:48] he thinks he's as religious as all get
[56:50] out
[56:51] but if you can't write all your tongue
[56:56] that is exactly
[57:00] uh
[57:01] what lucifer
[57:03] had at the beginning he didn't bridle
[57:04] his tongue
[57:08] in the beginning satan said i will be
[57:11] like the most high i will exalt my
[57:13] throne above the throne of god or i will
[57:17] exalt my will above god's will
[57:21] so his vision was to have everyone
[57:25] exalt their own will
[57:27] above the will of god
[57:32] his vision to see his image
[57:35] manifested in humanity to where everyone
[57:38] was exalting their will so much above
[57:41] god they didn't even think about god
[57:44] they didn't like to retain god i think
[57:46] it's romans 1 28 says and even as they
[57:49] did not like to retain god in their
[57:51] knowledge god gave them over to a
[57:53] reprobate mine
[57:57] you talk to some people who are sold out
[57:59] to sin they don't want to talk about god
[58:04] they've crossed the line how many people
[58:05] have crossed the line
[58:14] i know i want to cross the line for god
[58:17] that's what i want to do i'm going to
[58:18] cross that line for god
[58:20] i want to press towards that
[58:23] i want to be able to to apprehend
[58:26] the same thing that god has apprehended
[58:31] one time jesus turned and he said to to
[58:33] peter in matthew chapter 16 verse 23
[58:37] he said get thee behind me satan
[58:41] thou art an offense
[58:44] unto me
[58:46] for thou savers not the things that be
[58:48] of god
[58:50] but those that be of men see the same
[58:52] number
[58:54] satan and man become the same
[58:58] thou art in offense in other words the
[59:01] ministry that satan speaks to our mind
[59:04] is a ministry that opposes what christ
[59:08] is really trying to teach us true amen
[59:10] that's right
[59:11] and what was jesus trying to teach peter
[59:14] and his disciples at that point
[59:16] that you have to suffer
[59:18] amen
[59:20] and they did they weren't wanting to do
[59:21] that
[59:23] when jesus said
[59:24] if you're going to come after me if
[59:25] you're going to follow me you need to
[59:27] deny yourself and no that's suffering
[59:29] any time that you decide i'm not going
[59:31] to eat that
[59:32] those double stuffed oreo cookies i i
[59:35] i'm not going to watch that program i
[59:38] i'm not going to
[59:41] it's a suffering
[59:43] it's a pain
[59:44] it hurts because your flesh wants to go
[59:47] after it
[59:50] and
[59:51] the
[59:52] the things that savorous men is they
[59:55] want the way of least resistance to make
[59:57] it to heaven to make it to rapture to me
[1:00:00] to be god's elect
[1:00:07] that word savorist it means if you look
[1:00:10] it up it means to exercise the mind
[1:00:15] satan
[1:00:16] loves to exercise the mind with things
[1:00:20] that entertain
[1:00:22] the nature that they were born with
[1:00:25] so see
[1:00:26] satan is not trying to convince man
[1:00:32] that he is wrong
[1:00:34] and that he needs to be more evil
[1:00:39] he wants to give man what their flesh
[1:00:42] wants
[1:00:43] and that makes him more evil
[1:00:45] see the difference
[1:00:50] the way to become more
[1:00:52] in satan's image is to do more what your
[1:00:55] flesh wants
[1:00:57] that's how he's deceiving the whole
[1:00:59] world
[1:01:01] saint loves to exercise man's mind with
[1:01:04] things that exalt their own will
[1:01:08] above what god wants him to do
[1:01:13] you want to do this go do it nobody's
[1:01:15] stopping you
[1:01:20] that's more in satan's image
[1:01:24] god has a vision to see man back in his
[1:01:27] image and satan has a vision to see man
[1:01:30] in his image
[1:01:32] and this is the great battle brother
[1:01:34] adam said it's the greatest battle ever
[1:01:35] being fought
[1:01:38] satan has set out to share his vision
[1:01:42] to others adapt to the same vision of
[1:01:45] his own
[1:01:46] now let's just try to
[1:01:48] i'm going to try to stop
[1:01:50] after i get through this because time's
[1:01:51] up and honestly i didn't even get
[1:01:53] through half of what i have didn't get
[1:01:56] to half
[1:01:57] but that's okay i want to take my time i
[1:01:59] want to make sure you understand this
[1:02:01] genesis chapter 3 verse 4 the serpent
[1:02:04] said unto eve ye shall not surely die
[1:02:11] first thing
[1:02:13] consequences
[1:02:14] are not what you think they're going to
[1:02:16] be
[1:02:17] this is the first thing satan tells us
[1:02:19] and
[1:02:20] don't worry about the circumstances
[1:02:25] hey
[1:02:27] just go steal this thing
[1:02:30] you're not going to get caught
[1:02:31] don't think about the circumstances
[1:02:35] so satan says you shall not surely die
[1:02:37] you're still predestinated you don't
[1:02:40] have to be faithful
[1:02:45] you don't have to go to church every
[1:02:46] service you don't have to
[1:02:49] to listen to the tapes brother john
[1:02:51] he'll just tell you brother bruce he'll
[1:02:53] just tell you
[1:02:58] i mean somehow i'm just perfected by the
[1:03:00] five five-fold ministry that's all i
[1:03:02] gotta do is listen to the fightful
[1:03:03] ministry i'll be afraid i don't need to
[1:03:07] i don't need to be a doer the word just
[1:03:08] be a hearer of the word see he
[1:03:11] he doesn't
[1:03:12] get you to think about the consequences
[1:03:16] second thing
[1:03:18] look at all you're able to gain by doing
[1:03:21] your will over god's
[1:03:26] that's what he tried to do with eve look
[1:03:29] what you're going to gain
[1:03:33] for god does know that in the day you
[1:03:35] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[1:03:38] and you shall be as gods knowing good
[1:03:41] and evil in other words you're not in
[1:03:43] that place yet you're not there
[1:03:46] but if you do this you're gonna get
[1:03:48] something out of it now isn't that how
[1:03:50] satan gets us to sin
[1:03:54] come on
[1:03:58] be honest
[1:04:00] satan exercised eve's mind with a lust
[1:04:03] for knowledge
[1:04:06] to be like god to know everything
[1:04:12] an easier path to get to
[1:04:15] just partake of this beautiful idea
[1:04:19] you will be in control of bringing forth
[1:04:22] without god
[1:04:24] anymore
[1:04:27] in other words you won't have to speak
[1:04:29] the word you can just go do it
[1:04:36] that's what satan presents to us
[1:04:40] and through that fall
[1:04:42] she literally became more into the image
[1:04:45] of of satan
[1:04:48] because she partook of the tree
[1:04:50] the tree is here
[1:04:52] we can't get away from it you can't say
[1:04:54] well i'm getting out of that church i'm
[1:04:56] getting away from that tree i'm sorry as
[1:04:57] soon as you get in the car that tree's
[1:04:58] there
[1:05:00] as soon as you go down the the road you
[1:05:02] see the billboard that's their thoughts
[1:05:04] you can't get away from it
[1:05:08] the thing you have to learn is don't
[1:05:09] partake of it
[1:05:13] verse six and when the woman saw look at
[1:05:16] this and when the woman saw that the
[1:05:18] tree was good
[1:05:20] this looks like a good idea
[1:05:24] and that it was pleasant
[1:05:26] to the eyes not to the soul
[1:05:29] it was to the flesh
[1:05:32] a tree to be desired to make who don't
[1:05:35] want to be wise
[1:05:38] she took of the fruit thereof and she
[1:05:41] ate
[1:05:42] she gave also the idea to her spouse
[1:05:46] and he did eat
[1:05:52] boy that caused
[1:05:54] a real problem
[1:05:58] but you know this stuff happens all the
[1:05:59] time in our homes
[1:06:02] happens in our families
[1:06:04] we just don't recognize it
[1:06:07] because we're so sold out on how
[1:06:09] predestinated we are
[1:06:14] well she was predestinated
[1:06:20] oh we don't got time but god willing
[1:06:23] we're going to fight she didn't even
[1:06:24] repent adam never repented
[1:06:29] well we can see the most subtle beast he
[1:06:32] didn't repent
[1:06:34] certainly the serpent didn't repent
[1:06:38] and that's what you need to get back to
[1:06:40] the image of god that's where this is
[1:06:42] going to
[1:06:43] there's one way we talked about this is
[1:06:45] the image of of satan and and what he's
[1:06:48] trying to get us to that we don't need
[1:06:50] to repent but when the word comes forth
[1:06:54] and we see we haven't been doing what
[1:06:56] he's asked us to do the only way to get
[1:06:58] to his image is to repent
[1:07:02] and this church
[1:07:04] needs to be zealous about it amen to
[1:07:07] give back to the image of christ because
[1:07:10] we're just not going to be predestinated
[1:07:12] into it

[1:07:16] long enough to know that nothing just
[1:07:18] seems to be happening all by itself

[1:07:25] become nothing right amen
[1:07:29] the more i crucify my flesh as the
[1:07:31] prophet said if he can just get one man
[1:07:33] in his hand he can't get you in his hand

[1:07:40] that you got to become nothing oh i can
[1:07:44] use that there's a mute thing let me use

[1:08:19] and tries to get us to relax in this
[1:08:22] laodicean age that we're living in
[1:08:26] amen let's it's just thing creating me a
[1:08:29] clean heart

[1:08:42] yield him for just a few moments before
