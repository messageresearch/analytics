[35:33] as the father have loved me so i have
[35:35] loved you
[35:36] continue ye in my love
[35:39] if you keep my commandments ye shall
[35:41] abide in my love
[35:43] even as i kept my father's commandments
[35:46] and abide in his love amen god bless you
[35:48] may be seated
[35:51] so
[35:53] it's easier said than done to remain in
[35:56] god's love
[35:59] because the requirement that jesus gave
[36:02] is we have to keep the word
[36:04] and the more we read the word the more
[36:06] we find out we got to keep
[36:08] so it's like a continual process
[36:12] of abiding in his love
[36:15] what the holy spirit is really doing
[36:18] he's leading us to a perfect love
[36:21] relationship with god amen
[36:24] and
[36:26] without it we can't really enter in
[36:31] so to get to that place of perfect love
[36:35] we have to abide in the leading of the
[36:38] spirit or abide in his love
[36:41] when we first came to the lord
[36:45] we
[36:46] only knew a very little bit about
[36:50] god
[36:51] we were really focused on how much he
[36:55] forgave us
[36:56] and washed all of our sins away and we
[36:59] were the happiest person on the planet
[37:03] and then we began to
[37:05] find out
[37:07] certain things
[37:09] that we needed to do one of the first
[37:10] things i learned about was that i had to
[37:13] cut my hair
[37:15] because it was
[37:17] one of his many commandments and
[37:20] and i i had to stop listening to worldly
[37:23] music
[37:24] and uh
[37:27] these
[37:29] um
[37:31] things
[37:32] if i did them now
[37:34] um if i didn't do them it didn't mean
[37:36] god loved me any less
[37:40] but i was i would stop
[37:42] my love relationship with him
[37:45] so all along god is
[37:48] developing a love relationship with us
[37:51] it's really based on love it's based on
[37:54] his word love for his word might be a
[37:56] proper way of saying it
[37:58] and
[37:59] at any time i decide that i don't want
[38:02] uh to do what he's asked me to do
[38:05] then i am putting a
[38:08] a wedge between me and god
[38:11] and we think it's not a big deal because
[38:14] we we still appreciate the salvation we
[38:16] still appreciate that he's met our needs
[38:19] we we still claim that um you know if we
[38:22] we pay our tithes and our barns overflow
[38:25] and so on so forth but the thing is god
[38:28] is more interested in the relationship
[38:32] and that's what this i believe this
[38:34] whole series has been about god's
[38:36] wanting us to remain in love
[38:39] it's easy to fall out of love
[38:44] still go through the motions kind of
[38:46] forget certain feelings
[38:49] we started off this series
[38:51] with remaining faithful and i think this
[38:53] is a important part
[38:56] um
[38:59] to to remaining in love is you got to
[39:01] remain faithful to the things that god
[39:02] said so one way is keep my commandments
[39:05] is be faithful to keep the commandments
[39:08] i'll say to any young christian it's
[39:10] impossible to grow if you do not remain
[39:14] faithful
[39:16] you just can't pick and choose when
[39:18] you're going to come to church pick and
[39:19] choose what what part of the word is
[39:22] favorable in your sight and
[39:24] and kind of let things go
[39:28] we must remain faithful to read our
[39:30] bible and to pray
[39:31] brother branham says if you want to be
[39:33] more spiritual that means grow
[39:36] then read your bible and pray every day
[39:39] he said in the message communion
[39:42] in 62 he says you see each day we've got
[39:45] to commune with christ
[39:47] we've got to talk to him each day
[39:50] we've got to settle with him each day
[39:53] what are we supposed to settle paul said
[39:56] i die each day
[39:58] that is what has to be settled
[40:01] each day i have to die yet i live not me
[40:03] but christ lives in me
[40:06] so if your physical body needs food each
[40:08] day and drink each day to survive and
[40:10] spiritual body needs spiritual food and
[40:13] communion with the lord each day to
[40:14] survive
[40:16] yes jesus said man shall not live by
[40:19] bread alone but by every word that
[40:20] proceeds out of the mouth of god so each
[40:22] day we've got to study the bible
[40:25] some people doesn't study it at all
[40:29] some picks it up every two or three
[40:31] times a year
[40:33] but a real
[40:35] real believer
[40:37] that's really spiritual built up he
[40:40] reads his bible every day
[40:42] and he talks to the lord that's right he
[40:45] has to because man shall not live by by
[40:48] bread alone but by every word that
[40:49] proceeds out of the mouth of god
[40:53] that's remaining
[40:54] faithful
[40:55] another thing that we need to remain
[40:57] faithful is uh coming to church hebrews
[41:00] chapter 10 verse 25 says not forsaking
[41:04] the assembling of ourselves together
[41:08] as the matter some is some some say it's
[41:11] okay some just
[41:13] you know
[41:14] they want to come when they want to come
[41:18] but exhort one another and so much the
[41:21] more
[41:22] as you see the day approaching so now
[41:24] it's put on us the responsibility
[41:26] of telling others you've got to be in
[41:29] church
[41:30] not hey i would consider you know you
[41:32] know you should maybe think about it no
[41:35] exhort them
[41:39] it's a responsibility if it's to me
[41:44] you're cutting off your lifeline
[41:47] we come here to feed and to find out
[41:50] where we're at with god and we can't
[41:52] take it as just one extra curriculum
[41:54] type of thing
[41:56] he says let's consider wanting to
[41:58] provoke unto love
[42:01] and to good work so i would say to
[42:02] somebody if the only reason you're
[42:04] telling them to get in the church is
[42:06] because you're being judgment or
[42:07] critical don't tell them
[42:09] but if it's the love of god in your
[42:11] heart you need to tell them
[42:16] faithfulness is so important we said
[42:19] that god is not obligated but the
[42:21] brandon said god is not obligated to
[42:23] show us anything more until we walk in
[42:26] the light that he's already given us
[42:28] this is so important
[42:30] because
[42:32] we kind of let certain things come and
[42:34] go
[42:36] and we something bothers us we just kind
[42:38] of like let it go and focus on something
[42:40] that's easier to do
[42:42] but this is really important to god
[42:45] it's his commandment
[42:47] and we all want to come to church and be
[42:49] blessed in his presence and to have a
[42:52] certain victory certain joys and
[42:55] and certain things in our life but we
[42:57] fail to follow through with the things
[43:00] that god has asked us to do so we need
[43:01] to look at this quote this statement
[43:04] that the prophet made to us in this
[43:07] last generation as really important to
[43:09] god
[43:13] when we remain faithfully connected to
[43:15] the vine then we can bear the fruit
[43:17] because jesus said unless you stay
[43:19] connected you can't bear fruit
[43:21] not not the fruit of god anyways
[43:23] he said in john 15 16 you have not
[43:26] chosen me
[43:27] but i chose you
[43:30] god started the relationship
[43:33] and he ordained you that you should go
[43:35] and bring forth fruit
[43:39] and that you have no breaks
[43:42] you have no breaks amen
[43:45] you got to keep bearing the fruit
[43:48] so god has not chose us to be some
[43:50] plaque on the wall or some trophy or
[43:53] some dried-up church-goer
[43:56] right he's called us to be lively stones
[44:00] to bring forth fruit
[44:02] i believe the fruit comes forth from an
[44:05] intimate love relationship
[44:07] he gives the holy ghost to them that
[44:09] obey him
[44:11] and it's not easy to obey the lord
[44:13] i remember when i first came to to to
[44:17] christ and how precious it was
[44:22] being in brother johnson's church
[44:25] i'll tell you
[44:27] my main motive was i didn't want to go
[44:29] to hell
[44:30] and i'm just being honest that was my
[44:31] motive
[44:32] i wasn't looking for god
[44:36] he came looking for me
[44:39] and i knew i was going straight to hell
[44:40] if i didn't yield and i'm so grateful
[44:44] that there was something inside that
[44:46] believed
[44:47] the book of revelations when i read it
[44:49] even though i didn't understand it i
[44:51] believed it
[44:52] amen
[44:53] but our motives cannot remain that way
[44:56] it cannot remain i i'm doing this
[44:59] because i'm scared
[45:02] if it does listen to this we'll stop
[45:05] putting forth the effort to please him
[45:10] so i'm just go
[45:12] you know what
[45:14] i don't know what
[45:15] i don't it's we're we're we're three
[45:18] degrees under what it says
[45:20] but
[45:21] it must be real hot outside is that and
[45:24] it's having a hard time keeping up never
[45:25] had that happen before it's the first
[45:27] time it's a hot day today but i saw you
[45:30] i saw you and i just didn't want you to
[45:34] suffer
[45:37] so
[45:38] our motive needs to become pure if it's
[45:40] mixed god sees it he knows it but it
[45:43] needs to become pure
[45:45] that we just
[45:46] unconditionally were devoted to want to
[45:49] please him
[45:51] he said if you love me
[45:53] then keep the things that have spoken to
[45:56] you
[45:57] it doesn't happen automatically we don't
[45:58] come to church hear the word we
[46:00] automatically do it right no we've got
[46:02] to lay like like like paul said we got
[46:05] to
[46:06] die daily
[46:08] and and get the flesh uh crucified so
[46:11] that that seed of life can just come
[46:13] forth in it
[46:16] now
[46:18] it is the only way that we can remain in
[46:21] love with god
[46:25] because jesus said
[46:27] that you've got to keep the commandments
[46:29] to abide in my love
[46:32] so when you think about the commandments
[46:34] god has been speaking to you i don't
[46:36] know what they are they've been
[46:38] different for all of us
[46:41] but we've got to about identify them
[46:44] and make sure that we're keeping them
[46:46] because that's part of really feeling
[46:49] not just feeling but
[46:51] you know when his love is around you
[46:55] you're you you just know it you don't
[46:57] have to go searching for it it's there
[47:01] because you've been obedient to what
[47:02] he's told you to do so this is a real
[47:05] important
[47:06] now songs and music can move us to tears
[47:10] but the only way to remain in love with
[47:13] jesus is to follow through with what he
[47:16] said how many times we've listened to
[47:18] songs and just
[47:20] you know we've been all teary-eyed and
[47:22] and just crying out to god and then you
[47:25] know two hours later kind of forget all
[47:28] about god
[47:31] so yeah songs and music can move us
[47:34] but what we need to be focusing on is
[47:36] keeping the commandments
[47:40] remaining in god's love it's hard to do
[47:42] in the age that we're living we've got
[47:44] so many distractions there's you talk to
[47:47] people
[47:48] they just seem to be
[47:51] worse
[47:54] worse
[47:55] just
[47:56] cold
[47:57] they they don't want to give you
[47:58] anything more than just a what do you
[48:00] want
[48:02] and then kind of get out
[48:08] but if we're faithful to just crucify
[48:10] our flesh
[48:12] then i believe the love of god can can
[48:15] flow through us we can we can keep
[48:17] living for others because that's what
[48:18] the greatest thing i believe about the
[48:20] love of god
[48:22] is it has no problem laying down its
[48:25] life for another person
[48:27] none it is so powerful
[48:30] greater love has no man this any than a
[48:32] man lay down his life for his friends
[48:33] and if god's love is inside of us it
[48:36] will produce the same thing now you
[48:37] won't go to calvary but you will crucify
[48:40] yourself that christ can help that
[48:42] person through you
[48:44] that's what we're all called for
[48:46] if we miss that we've missed our calling
[48:52] romans 12 verse 1 says i beseech you
[48:55] therefore brethren by the mercies of god
[48:58] that you present your bodies a living
[49:01] sacrifice
[49:03] holy acceptable unto god which is your
[49:05] reasonable it's a reasonable thing that
[49:07] you could do for god
[49:10] and be not conformed to this world
[49:14] and it's always trying to conform us
[49:15] right every day we go to work
[49:19] but be ye transformed by how you think
[49:23] by the renewing of your mind that you
[49:25] may prove what is that good and
[49:27] acceptable and perfect will of god
[49:30] now i believe the perfect will of god
[49:33] is to lay down our life
[49:35] for one another
[49:39] i believe as the prophet said that
[49:41] whatever we do we should go get perfect
[49:43] love
[49:44] now i believe
[49:45] that that's what we should be proving
[49:47] that's what we should be focused it's
[49:48] the most important things every day we
[49:51] go to work and i've taught
[49:53] i've taught
[49:57] a number at work
[49:58] that when you've got uh a list of 20
[50:02] things to do you can't get them done in
[50:04] one day
[50:06] so you have to make a priority of what's
[50:08] important
[50:09] the most important thing and the mo when
[50:12] brother branham got back from being on
[50:14] another side he said the most important
[50:16] thing is get perfect love
[50:18] now we agree with it we say amen
[50:21] but are we going after it or are we
[50:23] assuming it's just going to come to the
[50:25] turn of the page the calendar the next
[50:28] year it don't happen like that if it did
[50:31] he would have never said whatever you do
[50:33] get to the place he said he would have
[50:35] said don't worry it's coming no matter
[50:36] what
[50:38] it's not coming no matter what
[50:41] because it has to do with love
[50:44] it has to do with keeping the
[50:46] commandments it has to do with you
[50:48] giving up your will for god's will
[50:51] you have got to accept
[50:54] the same love in your heart
[50:57] that the father had to jesus and that
[50:59] jesus had to us
[51:02] are you with me
[51:04] all right
[51:07] john said the same thing in first john 3
[51:09] 16
[51:11] he said hereby perceive we
[51:14] the love of god perceive we the love of
[51:17] god because
[51:19] he lay down his life for us we ought to
[51:21] lay down
[51:22] our lives
[51:23] for the brethren
[51:27] so
[51:28] we're talking about perceiving to
[51:30] understand
[51:32] by this shall all men know you're my
[51:34] disciples
[51:35] when you have that love one for another
[51:37] can i can we just skip and and not skip
[51:40] but i want to inject this in ephesians
[51:43] chapter 3 if i could ephesians chapter 3
[51:48] verse
[51:49] number i just want to start with verse
[51:52] number 14. for this cause i bow
[51:54] my knees unto the father of our lord
[51:56] jesus christ of whom the whole family in
[51:58] heaven and earth his name
[52:00] that he would grant you according to the
[52:02] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[52:04] with might by the spirit of the inner
[52:07] man now who is that that's the holy
[52:09] ghost inside of you that's where we get
[52:10] our strength from
[52:12] when the world wears you out your
[52:14] strength comes from god
[52:19] that christ may dwell in your heart by
[52:23] revelation
[52:29] you've got to believe it
[52:31] if you don't believe it then christ
[52:33] can't come in
[52:36] that ye being rooted and grounded in
[52:41] love
[52:42] it's got to be the foundation it can't
[52:44] be because i'm scared to go to hell
[52:47] and it can't be because
[52:49] i i i want to uh be rich
[52:53] or i want to be delivered right
[52:56] i mean all those things are wonderful
[52:59] but your motive has to be love it's got
[53:02] to get there
[53:03] it's okay that that god gets our
[53:05] attention brother branham said that
[53:07] healing that was the bait
[53:09] right that was just
[53:10] god shows the bait he doesn't show the
[53:12] hook but he wants to hook us he wants a
[53:15] relationship with us something that
[53:18] would well that he it's a keeper
[53:21] right the worm can come off the hook
[53:24] but if that hook gets you
[53:27] amen he's going to reel us in
[53:31] all right that christ may dwell in your
[53:32] hearts by faith that you being rooted
[53:34] grounded in love may
[53:36] be able
[53:37] to comprehend
[53:39] with all
[53:40] saints
[53:42] everybody all to know
[53:46] comprehend with all saints what is the
[53:48] breath the length the depth the height
[53:51] and to know
[53:53] the love of christ
[53:55] it passes knowledge
[53:58] that you
[53:59] might be
[54:01] filled with all the fullness of god
[54:05] why does it take the love of god to be
[54:07] filled with the fullness of god
[54:11] why can't i just go to a college or you
[54:14] know
[54:15] learn all the bible and and just read it
[54:18] and and quote the scriptures quote the
[54:21] message
[54:23] it's not knowledge
[54:25] of god that gets us to god
[54:29] i'm talking about intellectual knowledge
[54:31] of god does not get us to know god it's
[54:34] when the love of god comes in your heart
[54:36] shut abroad by the holy ghost you know
[54:39] you know the fullness of god when you
[54:41] have the fullness of his love inside of
[54:44] you amen
[54:46] because god is love
[54:49] we've got to to remain in that love
[54:52] jesus said the same thing in john 15
[54:54] verse 12 this is my commandment that you
[54:56] love one another as i have loved you so
[55:00] often when we think about god's love we
[55:03] do not think about loving others
[55:06] i'm telling you the majority time that
[55:08] we think about the love of god is what
[55:10] god has done for us
[55:15] and somewhere down the line we've got to
[55:18] start thinking about others
[55:20] it's got to translate into god using
[55:24] your body to love somebody amen
[55:27] greater love have no man than this than
[55:30] a man laid down in his life for his
[55:31] friends i want you to think about this
[55:33] jesus was not bragging about himself
[55:37] when he's when he spoke this he it
[55:39] wasn't just all about him
[55:43] but he was teaching us
[55:46] that this is his commandment this is how
[55:48] you love this is what we need to do
[55:52] and then he ended year my friends if
[55:55] you do whatsoever command you amen it
[55:57] almost sounds like god's being respected
[55:59] persons here but he's not
[56:03] he's he's really showing us that there
[56:06] is a special relationship if you do what
[56:09] i ask you to do
[56:11] there's a special love relationship
[56:13] there when you re-reciprocate the same
[56:16] love back to god that he
[56:18] has reciprocated to us that he has
[56:21] initiated with us and i'm telling you
[56:23] and when you reciprocate it back this
[56:26] is where security begins
[56:31] unfortunately there's too many people
[56:33] that feel security
[56:35] starts with just jesus loving them
[56:38] and it don't matter what they do they're
[56:41] still secure
[56:43] in other words they leave out the part
[56:45] of keeping his commandments
[56:47] they leave out the part that that god is
[56:50] looking for
[56:54] we must
[56:55] press into god's love
[56:57] must abide in it remain in it
[57:00] keep ourselves in the love of god it's a
[57:03] choice that we make
[57:05] last sunday we
[57:07] dove into remaining in god's love
[57:10] through humility
[57:13] i think some of these things that we're
[57:15] saying
[57:16] they do bear repeating
[57:19] i i could i could
[57:22] i could use more humility amen
[57:27] we can be doing many things for the lord
[57:30] but if we don't remain in humility we'll
[57:32] never remain in his love
[57:35] it you must be humble if you're going to
[57:38] remain in the love of god
[57:40] you just you just cannot remain in god's
[57:44] love and be proud
[57:48] to me humility true humility that is is
[57:51] a sign that god is first in your life
[57:55] and no matter how religious we may feel
[57:59] pride is a sure sign that god is against
[58:01] you
[58:03] god is against you if pride is there
[58:08] to say even in the in the bible that god
[58:12] that god wanted us to know that a proud
[58:14] look
[58:16] god even hates a proud look
[58:18] didn't do nothing wrong
[58:20] just a look
[58:22] but yet the expression that god is so
[58:25] much against pride because really that's
[58:28] where it all started was with lucifer
[58:31] he was perfect when he was created but
[58:33] he got to a place of pride amen
[58:38] we don't want that
[58:40] we want to be able to get underneath
[58:42] every single person that we meet
[58:45] get underneath them
[58:48] and
[58:49] love them more
[58:51] than you think they deserve
[58:56] keep yourselves humble
[58:58] and it will help keep you in love with
[59:00] god
[59:02] keep looking for forgiveness
[59:04] it opens the door to the love of god
[59:08] just being more grateful
[59:10] repentance should never be
[59:12] something that we just end at the end of
[59:14] the day
[59:16] don't just start it and end it but
[59:18] through the course of the day be
[59:20] conscious of your thoughts what's
[59:21] pleasing to the lord maybe little little
[59:24] gestures and little things or you know
[59:27] even could be just wasting your time
[59:30] remember the woman that was so grateful
[59:32] brother braham says that her sins were
[59:34] forgiven until she spent all she had on
[59:38] jesus
[59:39] and what was so beautiful about this
[59:40] quote is that when we are so grateful we
[59:43] don't mind spending all we have
[59:46] time
[59:47] money
[59:50] i'm not pulling for money
[59:52] i'm not
[59:54] but i'll tell you you you don't have to
[59:56] go buy some alabaster oil but you should
[59:59] you should be sacrificing something
[1:00:03] for the cause of christ
[1:00:05] if you're not
[1:00:06] if you're sacrificing little
[1:00:09] you're going to receive little and i'll
[1:00:12] say it like this you love us little
[1:00:16] and i'm just i'm just using scriptures
[1:00:18] now we went through that we don't have
[1:00:21] time
[1:00:22] to go through it again
[1:00:24] but another practical thing that we can
[1:00:26] do is we need to learn to exercise
[1:00:29] thankfulness
[1:00:31] it will help
[1:00:33] us to remain in love in god's love
[1:00:37] if murmuring complaining grieves the
[1:00:39] holy spirit away then i believe just
[1:00:42] being grateful and thankful for what
[1:00:44] he's given us we we try to exercise that
[1:00:47] every day i believe that will help us to
[1:00:49] remain in god's love now our
[1:00:51] circumstances do not dictate dictate to
[1:00:55] us whether we're going to be grateful or
[1:00:57] not
[1:01:00] it is it doesn't matter if we receive
[1:01:03] the smallest blessing or we receive the
[1:01:05] greatest trial we need to give thanks we
[1:01:08] need to be grateful we need to
[1:01:09] understand that god is in our life he
[1:01:12] knows what he's doing he hasn't made any
[1:01:14] mistakes and he's in control
[1:01:18] now i think we should all just spend
[1:01:20] five minutes and saying amen amen amen
[1:01:22] amen because we we we go through so many
[1:01:25] things and we forget
[1:01:27] to give thanks
[1:01:30] if you forget to give thanks if you
[1:01:32] don't have that heartfelt feeling
[1:01:36] you're out of god's love
[1:01:39] you're out
[1:01:41] first thessalonians 5 18 says in
[1:01:43] everything
[1:01:44] give thanks
[1:01:46] in everything good bad ugly in
[1:01:50] everything give thanks when you wake up
[1:01:52] in the morning look in the mirror just
[1:01:54] give thanks
[1:01:56] you're looking at a body whose spirit of
[1:01:59] god dwells in
[1:02:01] you can find a reason to give thanks in
[1:02:04] the morning when you look in the mirror
[1:02:06] for this is the will of god in christ
[1:02:09] jesus and it's personal
[1:02:12] it's concerning you
[1:02:15] exercise it
[1:02:17] it will keep you from quenching the
[1:02:19] spirit
[1:02:22] i don't want to put out the fire of god
[1:02:26] in fact i want the blaze to go
[1:02:29] amen
[1:02:31] be careful about your words
[1:02:34] our speech and our words can become
[1:02:36] polar opposite
[1:02:39] well one minute we're saying praise the
[1:02:42] lord
[1:02:43] and the next minute we're complaining
[1:02:49] what scripture do we have for that
[1:02:53] you know so just
[1:02:54] sometimes
[1:02:56] our conversations become so polar
[1:02:58] opposite that it's hard for people to
[1:03:01] see the true gratefulness that we have
[1:03:04] so just keep it on track keep it you
[1:03:06] know keep it one direction
[1:03:08] keep keep praising them all day long
[1:03:11] keep thanking them all day no matter
[1:03:13] what happens in your life
[1:03:15] when you thank god for your tests and
[1:03:17] trials what you're doing saying god i
[1:03:19] got confidence that you're in my life
[1:03:22] you wouldn't let this happen to me
[1:03:25] for a bad reason
[1:03:31] and just to be honest
[1:03:35] do things work together for the good for
[1:03:37] you or don't they
[1:03:40] we got to come to grips with that we
[1:03:42] know the scripture is true but is it
[1:03:44] true for us and if it's truly us for us
[1:03:46] then who are we to complain to murmur to
[1:03:49] wish things were different
[1:03:55] being truly grateful it's a part of true
[1:03:58] worship
[1:04:00] all right turn with me to luke chapter
[1:04:01] 17
[1:04:02] verse 11. remember the 10 lepers
[1:04:06] just want to
[1:04:07] touch on this before we get into our
[1:04:08] message tonight
[1:04:13] luke 17 verse 11 and it came to pass
[1:04:16] as jesus went to jerusalem that he
[1:04:19] passed through the midst of sumerian
[1:04:21] angeli
[1:04:22] and as he entered into a certain village
[1:04:24] there met him ten men that were lepers
[1:04:27] which stood afar off they lifted up
[1:04:30] their voices
[1:04:31] and said jesus
[1:04:33] master have mercy on us
[1:04:37] made it real clear
[1:04:39] they wanted to receive
[1:04:41] something
[1:04:43] from god
[1:04:48] and when he saw them
[1:04:51] god be in no respect or persons here he
[1:04:54] said unto them
[1:04:56] go show yourselves
[1:04:57] unto the priest i don't know if he said
[1:04:59] anything else but this is what we do
[1:05:02] know
[1:05:03] and it came to pass that as they went to
[1:05:06] the priest they went on their way
[1:05:09] some
[1:05:10] miracle happened
[1:05:13] and they were cleansed
[1:05:16] so now at this point
[1:05:18] maybe jesus wasn't there
[1:05:21] by them maybe it was two miles down the
[1:05:22] road i don't know
[1:05:26] but now
[1:05:28] something has to take place after we
[1:05:30] receive a blessing
[1:05:35] and one of them when he saw that he was
[1:05:37] healed he turned back and with a loud
[1:05:40] voice he glorified god
[1:05:44] and he fell down on his face at his feet
[1:05:48] giving him what
[1:05:50] thanks
[1:05:53] he was a samaritan
[1:06:00] i'm probably worse than a samaritan
[1:06:08] one turn back
[1:06:13] and notice where jesus attention went to
[1:06:18] it went
[1:06:19] towards the ones that were not there
[1:06:22] and jesus answering said
[1:06:24] were there not ten cleansed
[1:06:27] but where are the nine i expected thanks
[1:06:31] from all of them
[1:06:32] i want to say to you i want you to give
[1:06:35] thanks more than the other nine people
[1:06:37] around you
[1:06:39] because that's what god's looking for
[1:06:41] he ain't looking for you to kind of join
[1:06:44] in after somebody else gets the
[1:06:46] atmosphere going
[1:06:49] if the other night don't want to that's
[1:06:51] okay i'm moving forward i'm going to
[1:06:53] give thanks i'm going to praise him
[1:06:58] and then if god wants to from heaven say
[1:07:00] where the other then that's his business
[1:07:05] there are not found that return to give
[1:07:08] glory to god save this stranger and i'll
[1:07:10] think about this
[1:07:12] can you imagine having a deadly disease
[1:07:16] leprosy
[1:07:19] being healed
[1:07:21] and not wanting
[1:07:23] to give god the praise
[1:07:26] that he's worthy to be praised of
[1:07:30] now i know god blesses us every day
[1:07:33] in so many ways he blesses us
[1:07:36] and we come to church and we find it
[1:07:39] hard to even think of what things we
[1:07:41] could give thanks for
[1:07:44] you know what that's telling me that's
[1:07:45] telling me we're exercising a one-way
[1:07:47] relationship
[1:07:49] bring it on lord bring it on bring it on
[1:07:51] give it to me give me give me give me
[1:07:55] and we forget
[1:07:56] to give back
[1:07:58] to really give him praise and from my
[1:08:01] heart i love you no matter what
[1:08:05] that's what he's looking for and i know
[1:08:07] that may not be how you feel it may not
[1:08:10] be what you're wanting to hear but it is
[1:08:12] what god's wanting you to hear
[1:08:15] because that's what god is looking for
[1:08:19] god is always looking for us to return
[1:08:21] to church and give him glory
[1:08:26] don't even wait till you get to church
[1:08:28] get in your little room shut the door
[1:08:31] get down on your knees and praise them
[1:08:34] but i'll tell you what if you're not
[1:08:35] doing it in church you're not doing it
[1:08:36] at home
[1:08:40] you can't wait to get to church that's
[1:08:42] what the prophet said
[1:08:46] and he said unto him arise and go thy
[1:08:48] way thy faith have made thee whole
[1:08:54] how beautiful
[1:09:01] don't
[1:09:02] stop being grateful
[1:09:05] find ways to show it
[1:09:09] grow in gratitude that's a good one good
[1:09:11] message grow in gratitude
[1:09:15] all these things will help us remain in
[1:09:18] god's love
[1:09:19] we just need to exercise them
[1:09:22] fight to keep the flame alive
[1:09:27] so
[1:09:28] when you stay thankful you stay grateful
[1:09:31] you're keeping the flame going
[1:09:33] keep your relationship intimate
[1:09:36] not surfacing not storefront not just
[1:09:39] going through the motions keep it
[1:09:41] intimate stay there until his presence
[1:09:44] comes
[1:09:46] keep it genuine keep living for others
[1:09:58] now our natural love for god will not
[1:10:00] keep us in the love of god
[1:10:04] i mean write that down put it in don't
[1:10:07] ever forget that statement our natural
[1:10:10] love for god will never keep us in the
[1:10:14] love of god it'll never keep us in love
[1:10:17] with god
[1:10:21] we'll start to
[1:10:22] get lazy
[1:10:24] lay back
[1:10:26] we'll start living for ourselves
[1:10:29] we'll give up on things you know the
[1:10:31] prophet said we could love god every day
[1:10:34] and still miss it
[1:10:35] think about we can still love we can
[1:10:37] love god every day and still miss it
[1:10:40] it must be a different type of love
[1:10:43] there doesn't sound like any security in
[1:10:45] that love
[1:10:46] i'm looking for a love with security
[1:10:50] i believe god has that for us
[1:10:52] i believe that's god's love
[1:10:54] my love ain't secure
[1:10:56] you want to know about my love
[1:10:58] it has failed so many times i need a
[1:11:01] calculator
[1:11:05] amen
[1:11:07] it's all the times you yelled at
[1:11:09] somebody got mad at somebody didn't want
[1:11:11] to talk to somebody turn your back on
[1:11:13] somebody that's your love
[1:11:16] and if you're loving god with that love
[1:11:19] well i would never do that
[1:11:21] listen
[1:11:22] how do you know what love you're loving
[1:11:24] god with
[1:11:26] there's no security in our love we've
[1:11:28] got to we've got to reciprocate god's
[1:11:30] love back to him amen
[1:11:32] and i like what our brother said in our
[1:11:34] men's meeting today you can't give out
[1:11:36] what you don't got you can only give out
[1:11:38] what you got
[1:11:40] right isn't that right brother ferguson
[1:11:42] exactly right so we need
[1:11:45] we need the love of god
[1:11:48] how do i know i got it you're laying
[1:11:50] down your life
[1:11:51] that's how you know you got it not a
[1:11:54] feeling not an emotion
[1:11:56] not you claiming it
[1:11:58] not because he died for you
[1:12:01] but because you're laying down your life
[1:12:04] for the cause of christ
[1:12:11] but when you remain in god's agape love
[1:12:13] there's nothing that can tear you apart
[1:12:16] from god
[1:12:21] there are benefits to remaining in god's
[1:12:23] love and one of them is you can't ever
[1:12:24] get separated
[1:12:26] we can get separated by our love for god
[1:12:29] but nothing can separate us from the
[1:12:31] love of god which is in christ jesus
[1:12:34] romans 38 verse 5 uh
[1:12:37] romans 8 verse 35 let's just go through
[1:12:40] these
[1:12:41] real
[1:12:42] encouraging scriptures because i know
[1:12:44] i've been giving you some strong word
[1:12:47] but i'll tell you there's some benefits
[1:12:49] to remaining in god's love
[1:12:53] so now we've bypassed the
[1:12:56] section of
[1:12:58] keeping the commandments
[1:13:00] we're remaining grateful and thankful
[1:13:02] and humble
[1:13:05] and we're bearing the fruit now
[1:13:08] there are
[1:13:10] uh there are benefits now
[1:13:13] so number one is i don't
[1:13:16] i don't ever want to be separated
[1:13:18] from the love of god
[1:13:21] i'm okay
[1:13:22] honestly i'm okay
[1:13:24] with sinning
[1:13:25] and getting beat over the head
[1:13:27] by god for it
[1:13:30] but i am not okay with being separated
[1:13:33] from god
[1:13:37] that to me
[1:13:39] a separation from god is hell
[1:13:43] and you know to me if you you just think
[1:13:45] about it the whole world don't want the
[1:13:47] love of god they don't want to come
[1:13:48] under subjection they don't want to go
[1:13:50] to church they don't want to what
[1:13:51] they're doing is they're showing god i
[1:13:53] don't want you
[1:13:54] then when it comes to judgment and god
[1:13:57] says okay you chose not to want me then
[1:14:00] that's what you get
[1:14:02] separation eternal separation
[1:14:05] or
[1:14:08] forever separated
[1:14:10] right you know what i'm trying to say
[1:14:12] romans 8 35 who shall separate us from
[1:14:15] the love of christ
[1:14:18] so the things that we're going through
[1:14:20] or distress or persecution or famine
[1:14:23] nakedness or peril or sword
[1:14:27] amen amen brother bruce
[1:14:30] no
[1:14:31] as it is written
[1:14:33] for thy sake
[1:14:35] we
[1:14:37] are killed all the day long
[1:14:40] amen
[1:14:41] all day we don't get to do what we want
[1:14:43] to do
[1:14:45] we are counted as sheep for the
[1:14:47] slaughter we laid on our lives
[1:14:50] for one another
[1:14:53] for the lost
[1:14:54] souls we're
[1:14:57] for our sake we're killed all the day
[1:14:59] long
[1:15:01] it's showing why we can't be separated
[1:15:04] this verse which we wish we didn't read
[1:15:06] and talk about
[1:15:08] is the verse that brings security
[1:15:11] because if you don't want to crucify
[1:15:13] your flesh you don't want to be
[1:15:15] accounted as sheep for the slaughter
[1:15:18] then there is no security
[1:15:21] you are not reciprocating god's love
[1:15:23] back
[1:15:26] nay and all these things we are more
[1:15:29] than conquerors to him that loved us
[1:15:39] i love him because he first loved me
[1:15:44] we're more than conquerors to him that
[1:15:47] loved us for i persuade that neither
[1:15:48] death nor life nor angels principalities
[1:15:50] powers or or things present or things
[1:15:54] even to come
[1:15:56] who cares about the news
[1:15:58] nor height or death nor any other
[1:16:01] creature
[1:16:02] shall be able to separate us
[1:16:06] from what
[1:16:07] our love to god
[1:16:09] no
[1:16:10] from the love
[1:16:12] of god
[1:16:14] which is in christ jesus our lord amen
[1:16:18] now god would be a respecter persons
[1:16:21] if he chose to love only some people
[1:16:25] more than others
[1:16:28] and then there would never be
[1:16:30] a fair judgment
[1:16:31] on the day of judgment amen
[1:16:34] but there's many people going to be
[1:16:35] separated
[1:16:38] but when you reciprocate this same love
[1:16:40] back to god
[1:16:42] you cannot be separated
[1:16:45] that's where your security is at and the
[1:16:47] only way you can do it is be filled with
[1:16:49] god's love that's the only way you can
[1:16:50] give it back
[1:16:52] we got we've got the responsibility of
[1:16:54] going after perfect love of seeking it
[1:16:57] of of getting more of the holy ghost so
[1:16:59] more of the love of god can come out
[1:17:01] amen
[1:17:02] it don't just happen by church
[1:17:04] attendance for so many years
[1:17:07] it don't even happen by saying amen
[1:17:13] we've got to mean so be it right we've
[1:17:16] got to we've got to take this word home
[1:17:22] put it into use
[1:17:25] when you remain
[1:17:26] in
[1:17:27] love with god
[1:17:30] with his love
[1:17:32] you remain secure
[1:17:34] remaining in love it secures us
[1:17:39] now brother branham said that god is
[1:17:41] i don't know if he used the word always
[1:17:43] but he said god is hidden in simplicity
[1:17:47] it's so simple
[1:17:49] that smart educated intellectual men
[1:17:51] they cannot
[1:17:53] comprehend or see
[1:17:56] where god is at
[1:18:00] branham also said that he's revealed in
[1:18:03] the same simplistic way
[1:18:06] most people
[1:18:08] are trying to get
[1:18:11] to god to heaven
[1:18:13] some other way than a love relationship
[1:18:17] burning candles i mean there's just a
[1:18:19] lot of
[1:18:20] ideas out there
[1:18:22] but i i want us to catch this
[1:18:24] what we need is a genuine intimate
[1:18:26] relationship with the love of god
[1:18:33] not not just i know the word
[1:18:37] but the love of the word
[1:18:40] the love that wrote the word the
[1:18:43] love that was the motive behind that
[1:18:46] word being written
[1:18:48] we need an intimate relationship with
[1:18:51] that
[1:18:52] love which
[1:18:55] to me puts a whole another meaning of
[1:18:58] why we come to church
[1:19:00] now i can see why the prophet said we
[1:19:02] come to find out where we're at with god
[1:19:04] because there's something in me that
[1:19:06] wants to make sure that i'm doing what
[1:19:08] he wants me to do
[1:19:14] so brother branson says whatever you do
[1:19:15] lay everything aside until you get it
[1:19:21] now this relationship
[1:19:23] it's our protection
[1:19:25] it's our security
[1:19:27] when we love god back with the same love
[1:19:30] that he loved us with and i'm going to
[1:19:32] be honest with you god deserves so much
[1:19:34] more than my love
[1:19:36] my love is the pits
[1:19:39] and if cheryl was right here she'd say
[1:19:40] amen
[1:19:43] but human love just doesn't get the job
[1:19:45] done
[1:19:46] i'm going to love god back with the
[1:19:47] human love
[1:19:49] that quits when it wants to quit
[1:19:52] doesn't want to bear anything
[1:19:54] doesn't want to go the second mile
[1:19:56] doesn't want to
[1:19:58] turn the cheek
[1:20:00] and i'm going to love god with that and
[1:20:01] expect him that that is going to be good
[1:20:05] enough for our relationship
[1:20:06] it's not
[1:20:08] we've got to humble ourselves and get
[1:20:10] serious about getting filled with
[1:20:11] perfect love
[1:20:13] if the prophet said it i'm just a
[1:20:15] believer that we can get it amen
[1:20:20] i don't believe it's going to come on
[1:20:21] the last day before the rapture
[1:20:23] i believe it'll be on display
[1:20:26] it'll be on display and the bride will
[1:20:28] have it
[1:20:34] when we look
[1:20:36] when we love god back with his love
[1:20:39] we're protected
[1:20:41] from even fear
[1:20:43] how many times have we been afraid
[1:20:47] so just
[1:20:49] it was just within the last few days
[1:20:52] um
[1:20:54] my wife came out of the bathroom and i
[1:20:56] just happened to be you know going by i
[1:20:58] wasn't going like this
[1:21:00] but i just happened to be going by and
[1:21:02] she came out of the bathroom and she
[1:21:04] just said
[1:21:06] don't scare me
[1:21:09] now look i was accused
[1:21:11] of a motive of scaring her
[1:21:16] was not my motive my motive was to get
[1:21:18] to the other side of the room
[1:21:21] i had nothing to do with that situation
[1:21:25] nothing
[1:21:26] but fear was a real thing
[1:21:29] fear is real
[1:21:34] but when you
[1:21:36] are so
[1:21:38] in love
[1:21:40] with god's love
[1:21:43] you are so free from fear
[1:21:46] amen do you believe that
[1:21:48] yes
[1:21:49] amen first john chapter 4
[1:21:52] verse 17 first john chapter 4 verse 17
[1:21:55] herein
[1:21:57] is our love made perfect
[1:22:01] okay talking about perfect love
[1:22:03] that we may have boldness in the day of
[1:22:05] judgment because as he is so are we in
[1:22:08] this world now
[1:22:09] how is that
[1:22:10] somehow we got to be like god
[1:22:12] god is love
[1:22:14] i i now when i'm talking about
[1:22:17] love i am not separating that from the
[1:22:20] word at all
[1:22:22] at all it's one and the same
[1:22:26] there is no fear
[1:22:29] in
[1:22:30] love
[1:22:31] now we're speaking of god's agape love
[1:22:33] here
[1:22:34] because my wife loves me
[1:22:38] and there's fear in our love
[1:22:42] think about it
[1:22:43] every human relationship there's fear
[1:22:47] in their love
[1:22:48] there is
[1:22:50] but in god's there isn't
[1:22:53] there isn't
[1:22:56] there is no fear in love but perfect
[1:22:59] love or complete love for god casteth
[1:23:03] out fear
[1:23:06] because fear it has torment
[1:23:09] and he that feareth is not made
[1:23:12] complete
[1:23:14] he's not made perfect in love there's
[1:23:16] still something missing so when we're
[1:23:20] battling fear
[1:23:21] you've got two choices
[1:23:23] you stand up and tell the devil to get
[1:23:25] behind you
[1:23:27] and if you don't feel you can do that
[1:23:29] you need to get on your knees and cry
[1:23:30] out to god for his love
[1:23:33] don't stand in the middle
[1:23:35] make a decision of what you're going to
[1:23:37] do
[1:23:43] god is love
[1:23:46] and he doesn't fear a thing
[1:23:49] and when that love is there
[1:23:54] it doesn't want you to fear
[1:23:58] when we fear his love is not complete in
[1:24:01] us
[1:24:04] so here was the angel coming down to to
[1:24:07] mary
[1:24:09] how many times the angel come down come
[1:24:10] down
[1:24:12] and and they were there was fear right
[1:24:14] the bible says that there was fear but
[1:24:16] you know brother bran goes on the other
[1:24:18] side
[1:24:19] and they say when brother bran says
[1:24:20] what's this going on and and they said
[1:24:23] this is what you preach
[1:24:25] was the holy ghost this is perfect love
[1:24:28] they weren't afraid of anything
[1:24:30] they weren't afraid anymore
[1:24:33] because they were in perfect love
[1:24:36] are you with me
[1:24:37] i don't think we have to wait to get
[1:24:39] there to feel it
[1:24:42] i think it's to every individual how
[1:24:44] much he wants to pay a price
[1:24:48] he deals with us as individuals amen
[1:24:51] we love him
[1:24:53] because he first loved us
[1:25:00] woe unto the man who loves god first
[1:25:06] you know what i'm saying
[1:25:08] because that love is not strong enough
[1:25:10] you've got to love god back with the
[1:25:12] love that he loved you because remember
[1:25:14] before god came to us we still had love
[1:25:17] maybe we still went to church
[1:25:22] we expressed love to one another
[1:25:29] we need to be careful
[1:25:31] that we're not satisfied with the love
[1:25:33] that we have in our heart
[1:25:38] and i'm okay if you're living a perfect
[1:25:39] life don't stop
[1:25:43] if you're laying down your life forever
[1:25:44] i'm okay with that
[1:25:46] but if that's not transpiring
[1:25:49] i want to stand behind what the prophet
[1:25:51] said
[1:25:51] and say whatever you do lay everything
[1:25:54] aside until you get it
[1:25:57] and that's a job we have to do uh
[1:26:00] because it'll be so much easier to keep
[1:26:02] his commandments amen
[1:26:04] because amen
[1:26:06] all right saint john chapter 10 verse 15
[1:26:09] we are protected when we're in
[1:26:12] god's
[1:26:13] love
[1:26:16] security that's what we're talking about
[1:26:18] as the father knoweth me even so no i
[1:26:21] the father
[1:26:22] and i lay down my life
[1:26:25] for the sheep so
[1:26:27] here it is
[1:26:29] the the the intimate relationship the
[1:26:32] father knows the son
[1:26:34] and the son knows the father
[1:26:37] and what's the theme here
[1:26:40] i lay down my life for the sheep
[1:26:42] so there's a union or oneness between
[1:26:45] the father and the son and the subject
[1:26:47] of god's greatest expression of love
[1:26:49] here is laying down his life are you
[1:26:52] with me
[1:26:54] and he says that there's other sheep
[1:26:57] i have
[1:26:59] those are the ones he's got to lay down
[1:27:00] in his life for right
[1:27:02] which are not of this fold
[1:27:04] them also
[1:27:05] i got to bring in
[1:27:07] and they shall hear my voice
[1:27:10] they and there shall be one fold and one
[1:27:13] shepherd
[1:27:18] jesus is going after the sheep
[1:27:21] who are not in yet
[1:27:25] and
[1:27:27] the only way that
[1:27:29] they will know
[1:27:34] that they belong to jesus
[1:27:36] is
[1:27:38] something inside of them
[1:27:40] knows the voice of the shepherd
[1:27:44] and the shepherd's voice is always the
[1:27:46] word right
[1:27:47] always the word
[1:27:49] so even though they haven't been
[1:27:52] taught the word something inside of them
[1:27:54] it just registers when they hear it
[1:27:57] it's something supernatural
[1:28:00] now look at verse 17 therefore does my
[1:28:03] father love me
[1:28:05] because i lay down my life
[1:28:07] here's the reason that the father loves
[1:28:10] jesus for this thing of laying down the
[1:28:12] life that should be interest that should
[1:28:15] be important to us
[1:28:18] the father loves jesus for giving up his
[1:28:21] life so that the other sheep can come in
[1:28:24] wow that's the love i want i want that
[1:28:27] love inside of me
[1:28:30] no man
[1:28:31] taketh it from me there's no
[1:28:33] manipulation here
[1:28:35] the there's no force of the father
[1:28:42] yes he was in the garden and he said
[1:28:45] father if it's possible let this cup
[1:28:47] pass from me but he waited there
[1:28:51] the father waited until jesus said but
[1:28:54] not my will thine be done
[1:28:57] there was no force there was no
[1:28:59] manipulation and jesus said i lay down
[1:29:02] my life and this is why the father loves
[1:29:04] me
[1:29:06] because i lay down my life willingly
[1:29:09] now he knew he'd take it up
[1:29:11] he's got power to lay it down power to
[1:29:13] take it up again and i'll say it like
[1:29:15] this
[1:29:16] if you lay down your life
[1:29:18] by revelation
[1:29:20] you know
[1:29:21] the power inside of you is going to
[1:29:23] raise you up in the end
[1:29:26] there's no fear
[1:29:27] there's no fear
[1:29:30] all right let's drop down to 27 john 10
[1:29:33] 27 my sheep hear my voice now i know
[1:29:37] them and they follow me
[1:29:43] his personal sheep hear the voice of the
[1:29:45] lord speaking
[1:29:47] now what is he saying to these sheep
[1:29:51] what is he saying to them
[1:29:53] that they'll follow
[1:29:55] any ideas
[1:29:58] i love you okay
[1:30:03] it's a it's a good question
[1:30:05] i mean think about how he came to you
[1:30:07] what did he say to you
[1:30:10] how did he get you
[1:30:14] all right i think it's the same thing
[1:30:16] that he said in luke chapter 9 we're
[1:30:17] going to just leave there for a second
[1:30:18] luke chapter 9 verse 23 and he said to
[1:30:21] them all if any man will come after me
[1:30:24] in other words well follow me
[1:30:26] let him deny himself take up his cross
[1:30:28] and follow me
[1:30:32] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:30:34] lose it
[1:30:35] but whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:30:37] sake the same shall save it
[1:30:41] well i know when i was being introduced
[1:30:44] i went to church i went to a a catholic
[1:30:47] church
[1:30:48] but i didn't know god didn't know
[1:30:51] didn't know god at all
[1:30:53] in fact i was
[1:30:55] when something triggered in here i
[1:30:57] wanted to know god
[1:31:02] when i was being introduced to god by
[1:31:05] god
[1:31:09] i know he told me i had to give up my
[1:31:10] life
[1:31:13] not just say i'm sorry for my past sins
[1:31:16] and continue to do what you want to do
[1:31:19] that is not the message i got
[1:31:22] the message i got was i had to give up
[1:31:24] my life
[1:31:25] so the choice was there i remember this
[1:31:27] as clear as day
[1:31:29] i remember it if if i'm gonna
[1:31:33] serve god then i'm gonna have to give up
[1:31:34] cheryl
[1:31:36] i'm gonna have to give up my music
[1:31:38] and i remember that that choice had to
[1:31:41] be made
[1:31:43] and i'm so glad i made the right choice
[1:31:49] because when you make the right choice
[1:31:51] you put god first
[1:31:54] the promise is
[1:31:56] you'll save your life
[1:32:00] it'll raise up in the last day
[1:32:04] oh i just love this this scripture my
[1:32:06] sheep hear my voice i know them and they
[1:32:09] follow me
[1:32:11] so jesus says how how to really follow
[1:32:13] how the sheep are going to follow
[1:32:15] they're going to deny their will how
[1:32:17] many people have come been baptized in
[1:32:19] this church
[1:32:21] i'll tell you if everybody remained in
[1:32:23] this church that we have baptized from
[1:32:25] the beginning this room wouldn't be big
[1:32:27] enough for standing room only
[1:32:34] but
[1:32:35] they
[1:32:37] wanted salvation
[1:32:39] they started out
[1:32:42] but they didn't deny
[1:32:44] their will
[1:32:47] and when you don't deny your will
[1:32:49] you're still doing your own
[1:32:52] i don't care how you slice it
[1:32:55] my sheep hear my voice i know them and
[1:32:57] they deny themselves and they take up
[1:33:00] their cross and follow me
[1:33:03] that's that's the way it goes
[1:33:05] that word follow
[1:33:07] means part of a union if you look that
[1:33:10] word up follow it means part of a union
[1:33:13] it means to be in the same way with
[1:33:16] that is to accompany
[1:33:19] so here
[1:33:21] jesus follows the father
[1:33:24] and he follows them to do exactly what
[1:33:26] the father said which is to lay down
[1:33:28] your life
[1:33:29] and the sheep follow jesus and what do
[1:33:32] they accompany with
[1:33:34] what are they the same with in laying
[1:33:36] down their life
[1:33:38] it's no different
[1:33:40] that's what the voice is leading us to
[1:33:43] so jesus lay down his life in the flesh
[1:33:47] at calvary and that same spirit lives
[1:33:49] now in us and we're leading others to
[1:33:52] that same calvary
[1:33:55] we're pointing them to jesus we're
[1:33:57] showing them what they have to do just
[1:34:00] like we did
[1:34:02] right
[1:34:02] there's no grandchildren we all are sons
[1:34:05] and daughters
[1:34:08] they follow our company
[1:34:10] just like jesus did
[1:34:13] and they're laying down their life just
[1:34:14] like jesus did
[1:34:16] he says i give unto them eternal life
[1:34:19] and they shall never perish neither
[1:34:21] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[1:34:26] now there's the security
[1:34:29] the people that have come and gone
[1:34:32] where is the security
[1:34:35] and i don't care what the devil's taught
[1:34:36] them
[1:34:37] or told them
[1:34:39] in the word there's no security
[1:34:42] you have to remain with christ
[1:34:45] my father which gave them me is greater
[1:34:48] than all and no man is able to pluck
[1:34:50] them out of my father's hand
[1:34:54] he said i and my father are one so the
[1:34:57] father's hand jesus said it doesn't
[1:34:59] matter you're one and we become one with
[1:35:01] him because he's gripping us
[1:35:05] word upon word line upon line
[1:35:08] hallelujah
[1:35:15] i don't want to follow jesus part way i
[1:35:18] think there's been a lot of people have
[1:35:19] been plucked out
[1:35:22] the only way that you'll get plucked out
[1:35:25] is if you don't remain in love with
[1:35:26] jesus
[1:35:33] we can get out of the ark of safety
[1:35:35] our children out of the ark of safety
[1:35:40] listening to the wrong thoughts the
[1:35:42] wrong spirits
[1:35:47] if the prophet had to get desperate
[1:35:51] it was desperate for his children we
[1:35:52] have to get desperate for our children
[1:35:55] i just say keep praying for him
[1:35:57] keep believing for him
[1:35:59] but this is a it's a serious thing
[1:36:03] very very serious
[1:36:05] hereby perceive we the love of god
[1:36:08] because he laid down his life for us we
[1:36:10] ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:36:13] brethren if we're really following jesus
[1:36:15] the way he wants us to we will be laying
[1:36:17] down our lives for others
[1:36:20] now this is to me
[1:36:22] one of the biggest
[1:36:24] revelations of the whole bible
[1:36:29] because our flesh
[1:36:32] resists
[1:36:34] dying out
[1:36:37] it it it will it'll go as far as paying
[1:36:40] ties
[1:36:42] it will do certain things
[1:36:45] and it wants to settle right there
[1:36:51] but how many people paid ties and didn't
[1:36:54] love god did not lay down their life
[1:37:00] the call
[1:37:01] the voice that i heard
[1:37:03] is to lay down my life for the sheep
[1:37:06] and i don't believe that is just for
[1:37:08] certain individuals
[1:37:12] i believe that's for all of us amen
[1:37:16] time is i just want to read
[1:37:18] just a little bit more okay psalms 91
[1:37:21] verse 1
[1:37:22] he's our refuge our fortress our rock
[1:37:26] all right there's security now
[1:37:29] when we reciprocate god's love
[1:37:32] back
[1:37:35] he
[1:37:36] that dwelleth in the secret place of the
[1:37:39] most high shall abide under the shadow
[1:37:41] of the almighty
[1:37:44] there's a secret place for us i will say
[1:37:46] of the lord he is my refuge my fortress
[1:37:50] my god and him will i trust
[1:37:52] surely he shall deliver thee from the
[1:37:53] stare of the follower and from the noise
[1:37:56] and pestilence he shall cover thee with
[1:37:58] his feathers and under his wings
[1:38:00] thou shalt trust he his truth shall be
[1:38:03] thy shield and buckler
[1:38:05] thou shall not be afraid
[1:38:07] by the terror by night
[1:38:09] nor by the arrow that flyeth by day
[1:38:12] nor for the pestilence that walketh in
[1:38:13] darkness or the destruction that wasted
[1:38:15] that noon day a thousand shall fall thy
[1:38:18] side and ten thousand at their right
[1:38:20] side but it shall not come nigh thee
[1:38:24] only with thine eyes shall thou behold
[1:38:26] the reward of the wicked now look at
[1:38:28] verse 9 because
[1:38:30] thou
[1:38:31] has set up because thou has made the
[1:38:34] lord
[1:38:36] which is my refuge
[1:38:39] even the most high
[1:38:42] thy
[1:38:42] habitation
[1:38:44] now to me this is where you're dwelling
[1:38:47] yes in the word yes in christ and yes in
[1:38:51] love
[1:38:53] you can't separate the word in in love
[1:38:56] the love of god you can't separate the
[1:38:57] two
[1:38:58] people try but you can't
[1:39:01] there shall no evil befall thee neither
[1:39:04] shall any place come thy dwelling for he
[1:39:06] shall give his angels charge whoever
[1:39:07] they to keep thee in all thy ways
[1:39:09] they shall bear thee up in thy in it in
[1:39:12] their hands
[1:39:13] lest thou dash thy foot against the
[1:39:15] stone
[1:39:16] thou shall tread upon the line they
[1:39:18] added the young lion and the dragon
[1:39:20] shall thou trample under feet now look
[1:39:23] at verse 14
[1:39:24] because he has set his love upon me
[1:39:30] therefore
[1:39:31] will i deliver him
[1:39:34] not because god
[1:39:36] loves us he delivers us
[1:39:39] but the security comes when we set our
[1:39:42] love upon we reciprocate it back for i
[1:39:45] will set him up on i because he have
[1:39:47] known my name he shall call upon me and
[1:39:49] i will answer i will be with him and
[1:39:50] trouble i will deliver him and i will
[1:39:52] honor him with long life will i satisfy
[1:39:54] him and show him my salvation
[1:39:58] the security
[1:40:00] is when we set
[1:40:02] our the love of god
[1:40:04] that we have in our heart back upon him
[1:40:08] colossians 3 verse 1 says if you be
[1:40:11] risen with christ seek those things
[1:40:12] which are above which christ saith on
[1:40:14] the right hand of god we're ending with
[1:40:16] this set your affection
[1:40:19] on things above
[1:40:21] set your affection on things above
[1:40:25] not on this earth
[1:40:29] for your dead and your life is hid with
[1:40:32] christ and god
[1:40:34] when christ who is our life shall appear
[1:40:36] then shall he also appear with him
[1:40:39] in glory and we don't got to but when
[1:40:41] you've got time i want you to read this
[1:40:42] chapter that's your homework
[1:40:45] not that we're
[1:40:47] going to be going into this sunday
[1:40:48] because god willing you know we're not
[1:40:50] we're just going to be speaking on
[1:40:52] communion
[1:40:53] but if you read this chapter in verse 5
[1:40:56] so we're supposed to set our affections
[1:40:57] on christ and the first thing here in
[1:40:59] verse 5 he says mortify the deeds of
[1:41:03] your flesh
[1:41:04] count yourself as sheep for the
[1:41:06] slaughter you're just you're you're dead
[1:41:07] to your will
[1:41:10] don't don't don't have the wrong uh look
[1:41:12] at verse eight but now ye put off the
[1:41:14] old man anger wrath malice blasphemy
[1:41:16] filthy communication ever lying out one
[1:41:18] to the other senior put off the old man
[1:41:20] with his deeds and put on the new man
[1:41:22] now what is going to be described here
[1:41:24] is the love of god
[1:41:28] verse
[1:41:29] 12 put on therefore as the elect of god
[1:41:32] holy and beloved bows of mercy
[1:41:36] kindness humbleness of mind meekness
[1:41:38] long-suffering forbearing one another
[1:41:40] what do i need that for because you've
[1:41:42] been a to lay down your life for
[1:41:44] people
[1:41:45] forbearing one another and forgiving one
[1:41:47] another if any man have a crawl against
[1:41:49] even as christ forgave you so also do ye
[1:41:52] and above all these put on charity
[1:41:55] which is the bond of perfectness
[1:42:00] this
[1:42:02] is what we love god back with
[1:42:05] when we're willing to put this on for
[1:42:08] our brothers and our sisters there is so
[1:42:12] much
[1:42:12] security
[1:42:14] when you reciprocate that same love back
[1:42:17] to god
[1:42:19] and that's what i want that's security i
[1:42:21] don't want a false sense of security
[1:42:24] i don't want to think i got i want to
[1:42:25] assume i got something when i don't
[1:42:29] that's why the prophet said whatever you
[1:42:31] do get it get perfect love
[1:42:35] because there'll be no
[1:42:37] false sense of security in that you'll
[1:42:39] have the goods then amen let's stand
[1:42:41] together keep setting your affections on
[1:42:44] things above
[1:42:46] did you get something out of this
[1:42:48] amen praise the lord
[1:42:53] sorry for the extra
[1:42:55] minutes here
[1:42:57] it's not my desire to to go extra
[1:43:01] especially on a on a wednesday
[1:43:06] but i want us to rejoice because
[1:43:09] there's security
[1:43:11] there is a place of security in christ
[1:43:15] that doesn't matter if the bottom falls
[1:43:16] out doesn't matter if nobody shakes your
[1:43:18] hand loves us no matter what anybody
[1:43:20] does there's a security in christ
[1:43:23] and
[1:43:24] we can go after that
[1:43:27] and i just i want to
[1:43:31] i guess if i can say it like this blend
[1:43:33] our hearts in prayer right now
[1:43:36] and and
[1:43:39] be be the one
[1:43:41] that goes after it if nine don't be the
[1:43:43] one that comes back and praises god for
[1:43:46] what he's done the love he's he should
[1:43:48] have brought in your heart
[1:43:50] be that one
[1:43:52] if there's if jesus died
[1:43:55] if there was one that would receive him
[1:43:56] he would have died for that one
[1:43:59] if there's one that will praise him for
[1:44:02] what he's worthy of and live from for
[1:44:04] what is worthy you be that one
[1:44:07] even if nobody else does
[1:44:09] amen let's

[1:44:13] in prayer for just a moment heavenly
