TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is here all things are possible [Music] jesus is here jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here [Music] amen all we have to do is believe with all of our heart amen god will do the rest amen i greet you in the precious name of jesus it's good to weather the storm this week and get out for a midweek service to draw strength from the lord i could see wisdom in all the more as we see the day approaching because it's getting more and more evil and harder out there and we just need to come together draw strength from the word and and be encouraged with being with one another it's encouraging just to be together to see one another's face amen good to see that the lord watched over brother bruce and sister donna brought them back safely on the roads amen turn with me if you would to the book of jeremiah jeremiah chapter 9. and then we'll also be reading from psalms 46 starting with jeremiah chapter 9 verse 23 thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither let the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me amen that i am the lord which exercise loving kindness judgment and righteousness in the earth for in these things i delight saith the lord and then psalms chapter 46 and verse number 10 be still and know that i am god i will be exalted among the heathen i will be exalted in the earth amen let's look to the lord in prayer our precious heavenly father we thank you for the breath of life today thank you for health for strength amen for the ability to get in a car and drive and make it here tonight lord you are so good you have been so good and you are beyond a good god you are a great god and greatly to be praised father we thank you for your precious word tonight we ask lord that you would take possession of our hearts and of our minds and our thoughts and help us lord we want to receive from you tonight all that you have for us lord we're all have different needs but you are the common denominator to all of our needs lord we pray tonight in the breaking of the bread of life that that you would reveal to us all that you would have for us lord please cleanse us of any sin any unbelief anything that would stand in the way of you working and exercising in our behalf lord we want to know you in a greater measure we commit ourselves ask your blessings now and this precious word in jesus name we pray amen god bless you may be seated we want to entitle this message knowing god more amen we all know god to some degree amen but i like how psalms 46 verse 10 put it be still and know that i am god amen i believe uh moses could say that he knew god then he met the burning bush and then he really knew god and he could say he knew god and then he went down there and threw his sticks down and then he saw god more and he knew god more and god was with him through the the ten plagues and then he got to the red sea and he god said why cry to me speak he knew god more and i'll say today he's sitting here in church we can know god more amen it's not so much getting more knowledge hearing something new hearing something different it's about a heart condition of i want to know you i i want you and in order to do that we need to be still in our spirit and still in our mind and and focus on the reality that god is speaking to us through his word amen that's right man was born with a nature to want glory to be admired to be exalted and we see it even in children right it's very cute when we see it in a child he does something and he wants to be recognized and we just smile we say oh isn't that cute but when we see it in adults it's not cute at all in fact we turn up a nose towards it but it's the very same nature it wants glory some kids will try to do their best to win to feel the greatness and i remember being in a gong show i really wanted to win i wanted to feel that crowd clapping their hands for me crazy because to this moment i never want to stand behind a pulpit so i don't know what was going on there but i wanted to feel like i performed some kids don't even try at all yet they want to be exalted because they think something of themselves some kids get jealous and will actually try to hurt somebody else just so they can get exalted it might be we could say cain would be a good example of that right it's the carnal nature of pride that seeks glory and glory if you look it up means seeks honor fame admiration and to be exalted with triumph even if someone is lazy and doesn't hardly do anything they still have that nature of self-will wanting to be recognized look at me i want some attention one would think that if a person has become born again that they wouldn't make themselves of a reputation we should hear a lot of amens on that one what's so so what's really what what's going on since we become a believer in god it doesn't mean that we stop seeking glory for ourselves when we want admiration and honor and to be exalted even in our conversations simply means we need to know god more amen we simply need to know god more the more someone is seeking glory to glorify themselves or to glory in themselves the more deceived they are and in reality the further away from god no matter how much they know we don't know god as much as we need to when we're seeking glory that's how bad it is to be seeking it we need to know god more amen amen because god the bible says is not going to share his glory with any flesh he certainly wasn't going to share it with lucifer he's not going to share with the devil's nature or our carnal flesh jesus said learn to me for i am meek and i'm lowly amen he made himself of no reputation he took upon himself the form of a servant he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross even though i'm the high and the lofty one that inhabits eternity i dwell with him also that is of a contrite and humble spirit so amen god is so far from any of us wanting to be recognized that's right that is so far from that we got to understand we want that god don't want that god hates a proud look on a man's face he hates a proud thought in a man's mind and he hates a proud desire in a man's heart god resists the proud it's the humble who he looks to amen god does not want us to glory in anything but him we should hear a lot of amens on that one he doesn't want us to glory in anything but him but why we want to get praise i don't know psalms 28 verse 8 who is the king of glory the lord strong and mighty the lord mighty in battle lift up your heads or your gates even lift them up ye everlasting doors the king of glory shall come in who is the king of glory the lord of hosts he is the king of glory amen when stephen was preaching his heart out he referred to our father abraham as the god of glory in acts chapter 7 verse 2 and he said men and brethren and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in sharan when paul was speaking about the wisdom of god in a mystery he referred to jesus as the lord of glory in first corinthians chapter 2 verse 8 which none of the princes of this world knew for if they had known they would not have crucified the lord of glory amen so we you see in these three scriptures we have the king of glory the god of glory the lord of glory amen how can man be so deceived to think it's okay to try to take glory away from god amen that's right just to steal a little bit of look at me god doesn't want that he doesn't want us to glory in anything but him we need to give him glory not just at church when we're praising god but when we're outside the church talking to somebody when we're outside the church thinking about somebody when we're outside the church imagining something in our heart he is the king of glory who am i to get glory lucifer stole glory away from god he got to a place with his walk that he wanted to be exalted just like god in fact he wanted to be above god he enjoyed the praise of all the angels and god made them any time we do our will above god's will did you know we're glorifying ourself we're saying our will is greater and more important than god's oh if we could recognize that spirit before it gets on us and stop it in its tracks then you know god like you should know him amen amen the devil wants you to not be to to view this as a a very not that big of a thing it's like not really important but it has everything to do with your relationship with god thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches we could say let not the gifted man glory in his gifts god does not want us to glory in anything but him now we can we we all can agree with this but can we live this word amen can we live this word or are we going to just wait for the a moment that that we got a chance to to express hope he doesn't want us to look to anything but him not our wisdom our might our riches our talents our abilities our knowledge our understanding he doesn't want us to look at how smart we are i don't have to look very far he doesn't want us to look to our great knowledge no certain what does knowledge do just puffs you up makes you feel like you you know something got something because you got this knowledge about something turn with me if you would to philippians chapter 3 verse chapter 3 verse 4. paul gloried in his flesh like nobody else i know i mean he was this man was about as arrogant as i've ever met philippians chapter 3 verse number 4. though i might also have confidence in the flesh if any other man think that he have where he might trust in the flesh i more so here he is comparing himself with others which is number one unwise circumcised the eighth day of the stock of israel the tribe of benjamin uh a hebrew of all the hebrews think about it as touching the law he was a pharisee constrained zeal he persecuted the church touching the righteousness which is of the law he viewed himself as blameless now this is the way that paul was before he was converted amen so this is understandable to see this attitude or behavior in somebody who's not converted right but is greatly out of character to see it if somebody has been converted he says but what things were gained to me those i kind of lost for christ yay countless and i count every single thing but lost for the excellency of the knowledge of christ jesus my lord for whom i have suffered the loss of everything and to count it but done that i might win christ he was willing to suffer and give up everything notice he could have got up from the on the road to damascus and he simply could have said well that was a weird experience and went on his way he had a choice but he humbled himself he submitted himself and he just didn't do it for a week no he went to arabia for three and a half years he got serious with god that's what's really missing in this age there's too much of a spirit of lukewarmness laodicea and people don't want to get more serious with god they feel they're serious enough that's the need of nothing i feel there's more of god to know look at this verse 9 and be found in him not having my own glory my own righteousness which is the law but that which is through the faith of christ the righteousness which is of god by faith amen all the glory goes to god if you've got faith glory to god your righteous glory to god everything is god glory to god amen amen not partial glory and partial to me amen all how many wish that you had a greater leadership of god for your personal lives amen that's something that we're all seeking for paul got to a place that he said i don't know nothing except jesus christ and then crucified i just give him all the glory for everything amen amen if you want god to lead you in the affairs of your life stop glorifying your own understanding amen stop trying to figure it out stop glorifying your own wisdom your own abilities stop using yourself if you want god to help you god wants all the glory for our lives he doesn't want us to be self-reliant amen when you lean on yourself for answers you're glorifying yourself oh i figure this out this is what i got to do what about trust you know when you trust god it gives him glory amen amen when you have faith in god it gives him glory amen but when you sit there and you try to get all the answers and figure it out yourself you're giving yourself glory you're glorifying yourself when we yield to that we're actually glorifying our own ability to figure something out like there's no need to trust god i've got this figured out what an attitude even if you can't figure it out because he gave his mind to figure things out but he never gave us a mind to lead us we're sheep led by the holy ghost amen it's when we get involved that's when we get in trouble so we need to stop glorifying our own understanding it just gets in the way verse 6 in all thy ways did i read verse 5 proverbs 3 5 no i didn't let's turn there this is these are uh everybody's in the top six verses in the bible it's got to be these verses here right these are just some wonderful scriptures proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to the unknown understanding so now notice the scripture doesn't say stand on your own instead it's just lean he doesn't want us leaning towards it he wants us to stand up i have no idea but i trust i can't figure it out but i trust that's where he wants us that's why he gets more glory but if we're leaning towards that oh i got this figured out i got to tell you this and this is what's good you know what i don't see any glory and god in that but you know what's happening you're glorifying yourself in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths now i just want to say this is just not a favorite scripture so we know what god wants us to do that's not what this scripture is put in the bible for this scripture teaches us who god really is he's a god that wants us to depend on him that's what kind of god he is that's what that scripture's there for not so well i get figured out so now i'm gonna lean on him it's not the old you know safety net god is teaching us what kind of god he is he wants us to know him as a god that supplies all of our needs he just wants to see our attitude of leaning on him he wants to see that more because it gives him glory when we say god i need you show me but when i say i got this i got this on the tail brother mark i got it what am i doing there i'm steering him away from god i'm getting them to look to me we're stealing glory from god and we don't even know it we don't even know what's happening because we don't realize the spirit that's on us i want to know god more let him glory glory in this that he knows god he understands god he knows god that's where we should be glory in in other words god's taking care of this whole thing right the whole thing we don't have to figure out the world affairs we don't need to figure out one another's affairs you know what i can't even figure out my own affair i need god i need god and i know him that he promised to take care of me to meet my needs if i seek him first in the kingdom everything else is going to be that's all i know jesus christ and him crucified i don't need to explain anything else and i certainly don't want to get caught in trying to let people know what i know right it's true because i'm taking a right away from god when we want people to see god in us so bad that we're willing to steal glory from god it shows something's wrong with our spirit we don't need to prove anything we don't we need to make ourself of no reputation not a little bit of reputation i like god teaching us his nature his character verse 7 be not wise in your own eyes how many has ever felt like you were wise before especially when somebody says that was a really good one you know the bible says it's evil it's actually evil to be wise in your own eyes yes it's a wrong spirit and if we follow instructions it shall be health to thy navel and marrow to thy bones unto the lord with the with thy substance and notice with the first fruits of thine increase now i just want you to understand god is sending a sip of the same message but he's he's pulling out another another way god don't want to be second he don't want you to take your glory and then give him second glory give him all the honor give him all the praise honor the lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thy increase amen now when dinner comes to the table and you got this big bowl of nice dinner whatever you want that first spoon that goes in there that's the first fruit when brother mark comes over we don't eat and say mark you don't touch until we're done ties is first it's first it may not be first in your thoughts it may not be first in your ideas it may not be first in your understanding but it's first with god because look you're not doing it unto a church and you're not doing it on to a man it's god's to start with you're doing it unto god it's your faith in god amen not man god wants the first part of everything that you have that's been given to you on a daily basis given the first fruits praise them in the morning for the breath you got yes straight to make it to the bathroom to get a glass of water as you get older it means more to you give them the first fruits well brother john i've labored for it's mine i'm the one that no if he got you an increase through your labors it belongs to him he's the one that gave you strength that day to get up and go labor you're going to have that attitude he's just an ill right okay now try to go meet your needs honor the lord with thy substance give him glory with the first fruits of all thine increase it gives him glory when you don't honor the lord you really don't know the lord well enough i mean i know when i first came to the truth i've been in churches before and i gave offerings but i really didn't know about ties i didn't know you had to give 10 percent and when i first learned about it i thought i really don't know the lord but i thought i did there's so much the more the more i go on the more i realize i don't know god like i need to know him are you with me when you don't pay your church expenses your missionary offerings you know what you're doing you're glorifying yourself this money belongs to me i want it you're not taking your responsibility but when you do honor him the bible says in verse 10 so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine amen how many wants to be bursting up with the holy ghost my son despise not the chasing of the lord neither be weary of his correction for whom the lord loveth he correct even as a father the son in whom he delighteth when the god is trying to tell us his word amen don't despise it don't turn your nose up to it if god wants all the glory give it to him he's trying to correct us from trying to steal attention let the lord correct this in our lives he loves us he wants us but he doesn't want us to rely on our our self for anything to look to ourselves for anything i know it's hard because look before paul was converted he didn't have anything but himself teach me gamalia teach me that can only go so far but you you you learn to handle life on your own that's why it's so hard to witness the people about jesus christ because they got light they don't need god they get they got life figured out so even though we're serving god now god gave us these minds we still have that tendency to figure things out to lead your own understanding and yet we want god to guide us to direct our path and we struggle knowing it because down deep inside we're trying to figure it out we haven't humbled ourselves to stick with our testimony that i don't know i will not know until god chose me that's a testimony we need to stay with not mix it amen be not wise in thine own eyes in other words stop looking to yourself to figure things out it's evil you're glorifying yourself and you're stealing glory away from god you're stealing it and he don't want to share his glory with you so think about what you're doing you're putting yourself up with god i mean you want to put yourself up with god he made himself of no reputation you want to put yourself up with god he steved others better than yourself put him up with his character not your knowledge let not the the mighty man glory in his might or the the knowledgeable man in his knowledge or the man with wisdom in his wisdom but let him glory in the lord when they built the tower of babel they were wise in their own eyes and god looked at that as evil and what did god do the bible says he confounded their language yes he confounded the language so he hides things from the wise and prudent he confounds the wise when israel was faced with an unbeatable giant called goliath instead of looking to the lord they kept looking for the ability ability in their own camp who will go face him who will go face him instead of looking to god so what did god do he confounded their understanding with a small ruddy boy who didn't put any trust in what they thought their armor the way they viewed come up from this way watch this no understanding amen we're going to walk around the walls of jericho seven times this is no understanding this is the compute with me but it computes with god we're always trying to figure if i got it figured out then i then i got it no if you got it figured out you probably don't got it because god don't want you to get it he wants you to trust him to lean on him to hold him and say god i glorify you because i know you're going to take me through he hasn't changed just because it's the 22nd century he's going to handle things differently he's still looking for a people that's going to believe in him that's going to trust him for their situations god had to beat moses own wisdom out of him for 40 years before god could use him in his calling he was still called but he wasn't ready in fact he was called from a baby we knew about it but how many years did it go before god could use him right it's true so i'm telling you the more you think you are something the quicker you get away from it the quicker god's going to use you moses was wise in his own eyes but god viewed that as evil what did god do he confounded moses his own understanding in a burning bush what is this thing burning he went and met god in a bush i wonder where we're going to meet god sometimes we try to figure things out what's being preached here at church instead of by faith receiving it god's speaking to me amen i i believe god will bless every one of us more if we spent more time believing the word that's being preached rather than i don't know how this is fitting with me you got to get in that that realm you can't be in you know when you're trying to get a radio station you're between two of them that's what happens sometimes when we get the church we're in the flesh in the spirit in the flesh in the spirit and we're not really hearing clearly that's for me god wants me to practice not leaving my own understanding that was for me and you got to claim it like that if you're the only one sitting in church you've got to be the one claiming that if there's one in a city you got to believe you're going to be that one right don't wait for you don't never wait for me to make you feel good or to make you feel like believing i should say it like that because i just don't i don't believe jesus had that type of ministry either i mean god makes that type of ministry he makes a five-fold ministry he's got all kinds of trees and ministers but the word remains the same in all of them amen the word remains the same and we just got to believe the word i'm sure moses thought he was going to get his brothers together and they were just going to take over egypt we're going to rise up together as a team it's an army god just confounded that thought process said no i'm just sending you a one-man army sometimes we're waiting for somebody else to do something in the church to invite somebody when god's already speaking to you but you want a a big army right instead of you and god you and god are a majority remember that you and god are always a majority every time pharaoh exercised his wisdom god confounded him with just another plague what happened when the children of israel were at the red sea nowhere to go they're understanding everywhere they look they were caught god wanted him one of them to trust god to lean on god god is not going to leave us hanging that's right our understanding only takes us so far and then after that we're set there okay okay now what do i do that's what our understanding does god just wants us to get away from that because god is a god leads us by his spirit we were not born with this supernatural spirituality we think we were but we weren't right he wants us to stay humble jesus confounded nicodemus when he told him you must be born again to even understand god it takes god to reveal god we can't do it every time they tried to catch jesus disobeying the law he confounded them he confounded his own disciples telling them that the only way he could enter to the kingdom is through suffering and affliction amen and peter's saying no far be it from that leaning on his own understanding i got this figured out there's a better way an easier way we do not have to go that direction wise in their own eyes it was evil jesus looked at him and said get behind me satan because you savor the things that belong to men our understanding leans towards us and it's wanting to give us glory and that's why we need to not who cares if we know let's just glory that we know god amen that he's that he's the one that's taken us through if we begin to exercise this i mean on a daily basis our relationship with god will grow but it's got to be that real we can't say well i know god's with me if he does this this this and that does it like this and the squirrel goes up the tree and goes over here and comes down and sits right there and then he i'm sorry how many times it happened to brother branham but we expect everything to be like that laid out for us god wants us to take one step by faith be faithful to him today amen he'll give you something tomorrow if you exercise your own understanding your own wisdom he will simply confound you he'll he'll leave you in a state of wow it didn't happen the way i thought it did now how many times does that happen to us many many many countless of times all of us he confounds the wisdom of the proud the wise to prudent he'll leave us hanging what do i do he'll get us to a place where we will confess i don't know i need you if we would just start on that track to begin with like abhor our own understanding abhor our own wisdom abhor on our riches our might our reputation just abhor that lord i need you as much today as i did at the beginning amen not last but more stop learning or leaning on your abilities it's just glorifying yourself and it's evil it's just bad i think that's how brother george smith would say that part trust god learn to hear from him this is what this is about this what we're what we're saying right here is not easy peasy but the the part that we're not exercising is we're we're trying to figure it out without them and if god tells you you don't even need to say it you just watch it happen how many times has god said something to you you just kept it quiet you watched it come to pass i believe god wants to be more powerful in our life on a daily basis but if we don't learn to practice this like this word needs to be real these scriptures need to be real not i want god to lead me without me trusting in him i need i want god to leave me without um um having not to rely on my own understanding my own wisdom right it's not gonna happen we've got to be strong enough to say i'm not gonna lean i just i don't know god could do this you do that he could do that he could do everything but i'm not going to leave someone understanding i'm going to wait on him i'm going to trust him and i'm going to see his glory because that's what he wants to do he wants to be glorified in every one of our lives or situations whatever it is that's going on he wants to be first acknowledge him amen don't be wise in your own eyes first corinthians chapter 1 first corinthians chapter 1 verse 25 because the foolishness of god is wiser than men and the weakness of god is stronger than men for you see your calling brother brethren how that not many wise men after the flesh not many mighty not many noble are even called but god has chosen the foolish things of the world to confound the wise and god has chosen the weak things of the world to confound the things which are mighty and the base things of the world and the things that are despised have god chosen yay in the things which are not to bring to not the things that are that no flesh should glory in his presence do you see why god doesn't want you involved in trying to get glory of how you figure things out god i need you in my home god i need you in my prayer life god i need you in my job god i need you in my church god i need you in your in in showing me where you want me to go who you want me to reach out to i need you not i'm this and this and i believe in putting the show on the gun i believe in occupy until he comes but i believe in the leadership of god amen god won't allow your flesh to glory in his presence what he'll do when you start you know look at me look at me look at me as soon as that happens he just because no flesh is going to glory in his presence he's going to stay there he is not going to stay there but how many times have we done it and we think god was with us oh yeah i already show them but we're not even recognizing that wasn't god the service is about knowing god more it's not belittling how much of god we do know it's about knowing god more isaiah you're a really great prophet woe unto me i am a man of unclean i don't know what you're saying i live certainly i'm on i'm unrighteous and i'm holy i should not be in the presence of god not yeah you know i've said a lot of prophecies you know they were really good the people that came to pass it what is happening where is our spirit and we think it's okay god doesn't want us glory in that right because people can't see jesus when you were doing that no flesh is gonna glory in his presence none so let's just get it stay in the spirit keep him first keep him first verse 30 but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god has made unto us wisdom god is made unto us wisdom and righteousness and sanctification and redemption that according as it is written he that glorieth let him glory in the lord amen you know when we're having a conversation you should take like a checkup did i just glorify god amen take the check up you shouldn't have to recognize it from how another person is acting in other words you should be so in tune with him lord i know you i know you don't want me to get people to look to me i want to know you i want to suffer the loss of all things oh i don't want a reputation i know i can't have a reputation to have god i know i can't have glory and have god i can't paul couldn't and i can't why even try don't let satan take you off on this personal little thing and think it's god we want to know god more second corinthians chapter 11 verse 30. are you getting a little something out of this all right if i now here's paul he's looking at this subject about comparing ministers and glory and if i must needs you ever compare yourself with somebody in church yes or something another church or somebody else oh terrible if i must needs glory i will glory of the things which concern my infirmities hey if you're going to glory let's do it about how much you suffered for the cause of christ second corinthians chapter 12 verse 5 of such a one will i glory if i'm going to glory i'm going to glory of yet of myself i will not glory but in my infirmities he's making it clear what he's going to glory and what he's not going to glory in for though i would desire to glory i shall not be a fool so what happens when you see somebody gloring in themselves acting like a fool after jesus told paul that his grace was sufficient for his life he said most gladly in verse 9 therefore i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me in other words when when you're glorying in obedience to god's word and you're suffering for it willfully he said this is acceptable with god god said my presence will be there that the presence of god may rest upon me but if you're not there and you're just gloring in yourself of what you know or whatever your might or your riches or your whatever your popularity your your your your gifts god's presence isn't going to rest on you not saying he won't use you but i'm talking about staying with you i'd rather have god with me than god used me god uses the devil i think about that so much i said god i don't want that type of relationship help me amen as remember paul chose the heart away just like brother branham and because he chose the heart away a huge portion of heaven was awaiting him so the harder way is not to have all the other ministers look up to you that's true right because the promise was don't be killing more deer forever all those other brothers right brothers ministers whatever they were and and and brother brother brad says okay i won't and he didn't he kept his promise and god kept his promise and it it like it was a natural thing and he could even justify these people needed meat he was out there and he enjoyed it and enjoyed the gift of of shooting but it was the idea of the relationship this is what i'm saying brother sister god is more with you than you realize your situations that are going on he is just wanting you to look to him to depend on him to put in to faith what it means to not lean on yourself but to trust in god to put it to the test because god has never failed us he's never lied he's never failed amen we just don't want to be wise in our nice we don't want to lean to understand we want to stop trying to figure it out look to the lord all the time trust him all the time thus saith the lord let not the wise man glory in his wisdom neither the mighty man glory in his might let not the rich man glory in his riches but let him that glorieth in this one thing that he understandeth and knoweth me what else is important what else is important peter was ignorant and unlearned but he had the keys he didn't know how to use him he had the keys that's what we need is to know him to know him is to know life to be able to handle situations that you're in to know him is to love like him amen to lay down your life like him god is the one that takes great delight in exercising his own will in the things of your life so you need to dare to trust him we know it's evil to be wise in our own eyes and to lean to our own understanding it's also evil to figure things out and to have your plans for your future now we all need to plant potatoes i want to separate the two but we don't do it with for sure because we just don't know it's evil james chapter 4 verse 10. we're just trying to learn more about god james chapter 4 verse 10 humble yourselves in the sight of the lord and he shall lift you up that's the first step speak not evil one of another brethren he that speaketh evil of his brother and judgeth his brother speaking the evil of the law judgeth the law but if thou judge the law thou art not a doer of the law but a judge and then he says there is one lawgiver who's able to save and destroy who in the world are you that puts yourself in the spot to judge somebody anytime we do that we're giving ourselves glory and taking glory away from god it just it happens simultaneously god has just instructed us to be merciful i mean he's merciful every day his mercies are new for all of us we all benefit from his mercy and we don't want to give a little mercy to somebody that has done us wrong it's not him we don't know him we got to know him more oh i want to know him sometimes we feel this urge to speak in something negative mainly because we're self-proclaimed judges i got this thing i know i can see this was wrong this is what should happen number one if you're going to speak something that can be viewed negatively speak it to the person who's done the wrong that's number one that's scripture you don't talk behind somebody's back if you do you really don't know him number two speak when you do speak it speak it in love when you do speak it speak in love you speak the truth in love it's the only correct way to do it speaking the truth in love is completely different than just speaking the truth it's completely different we think it's the same because it's true no the motives are different one you're trying to prove somebody's wrong or prove you're right either one and the other when you speak in love your whole goal is to restore and help somebody you don't care about any you don't even care if you have to suffer to get it done if you have to look like you're nothing amen because that's what christ did when he went to calvary for you he gave up his glory to help us he came down from glory to help sinful people like us so just knowing god just put the stuff in practice don't sit there and let your thoughts you know go like this and we think it's okay it's not that's not god that's not god and you want to know god more then start practicing what you what you hear from the pulpit start putting the practice so you don't want to we can get in such a uh a rut we just come to church and we don't even hear from god i was sitting over on the other side talking to mr kapali and he's really been a great landlord to us we i was telling them uh when our last day would be and boy he's just tearing up and we're family i love you love your family love the church you're welcome here anytime please come back and and just stay in connection has nothing to do with renting just wants to stay connected that would be different if we had a you know a six-month rent but being here for what 20 years i mean that's what you want to leave with you want to you want to live with somebody like that so much that they don't want you to leave that's how you and i'm sure you know he's had to correct me the doors have been left open we've had to ask him to take care of water problems you gotta work through problems but you do it in love your patience and long-suffering and you want to restore it and make the relationship grow we just don't want to be a judge trying to figure things out and calling what we think is happening that is so anti-god when we practice this word we're practicing i want to know you more lord not no but no amen are you with me let's get back to james verse 13. go to now ye that say today and tomorrow we're going to go to such a city and continue there a year and buy and sell and get gained this is what we're going to do this is our plan whereas you don't know what shall be tomorrow for what is your life right it's a vapor that appears for a little time and then vanish away for that he ought to say if the lord will we shall live we shall do this or we should do that god i don't know i do not know practice saying the lord willing from a heart that really wants the will of the lord not from the heart that thinks they already know the will lord amen there's a big difference the but now he says you're rejoicing in your boastings for all such rejoicing is evil you're glorifying yourself when you say you're going to do something without saying if it be the will of the lord right because that's not there you're getting the attention to you and you think you know it's just not only become a judge of the law judge of your brother your judge of your own life this is what's going to happen and god sees that spirit and he'll confound us he'll confound us because he's not going to share his glory with anybody amen nobody therefore to him that know it to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin let not the wise man glory in his wisdom nor the mighty man glory in his might and let not the rich man glory in his riches but him that glorieth glory in this that he understandeth and knoweth me wow that sounds like a quiet secret life and you know others will see it when it's lived out yes amen that's what i want people to look at me and see christ amen not hear me see me if you want to glory in anything glory in the fact that god has revealed to you personally who he is that god has used his word to reveal himself to you and through that you find your place in christ you find your place in the church you find a heart for ministry yeah you know we ought to be growing multiplying reaching out i mean what healthy church does but we got to get beyond ourself like take care of me first i always like to john f kennedy don't don't ask what this country can do for you ask what yourself what you can do for this country we ought to be doing something for the church of the living god amen i don't want you to do anything for me but do something for god stand with me either lead me if i'm doing wrong lead me or get out of my way if you're not going to follow me we ought to be going in the direction that christ wants us to go pressing towards the mark amen god says if a man doesn't work he shouldn't eat we all have a job at church we all have a burden that we carry to help somebody amen to bring some soul to christ that if i go to work and i don't do anything but i still want to get paid i'm kind of lifting myself up like i am above having to work but i still want the glory of getting paid as if i worked we're not going to work for the lord we're stealing glory i mean if we don't work we don't eat well what do we want to eat the revelation we want the revelation of the word we don't want a dead letter we don't want the dudes we want it to be real to us that's why we we should get the church early labor and prayer [Music] it's you can definitely pray for the ministry yes but i'll tell you this i'd rather have you pray that your heart's more prepared you go into catholic church and get a piece of bread brother ryan said and see how much he believes the message you still can receive if your heart is right that's right but you got to labor it can't be just well at church just go to church it's like god i need to hear from you today what do you want me to start doing what do you want me to start putting into practice what do you want me to stop doing whatever it might be god has something for all of us it's got to be that role let's stand together the more you exercise your trust in god the more he delights in exercising in your life the more he he desires to exercise your plans to to tell you what you're really wanting if you trust him we just need to be still and know that he's god be still and trust him be still and trust him yeah he's not going to come right away most often he's going to wait to see if we're going to keep trusting him but i believe god if there's ever an hour that we need to know god more this is the hour deception is just perversion and deception is just on a rampage more than ever before may god help us to just start giving him the glory it gives him glory by saying i don't know but i know he does that gives a god glory it's okay to say i don't know it's okay amen you're you're all better than peter right right you can write your name more knowledgeable you got schooling if god could give peter the keys what about you what will he give you amen amen let's sing everybody all to know
