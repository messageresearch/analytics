John chapter 15. verses 15 through 21 and then we'll have you seated after that [Music] say Amen when you get there please I'll hear one I hear too three so we'll start with verse 15. henceforth I call you not servants for the servant knoweth not what his Lord doeth but have called you friends I love that for all things that I have heard of my father I have made known unto you ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you so the title of this little service sermon is God chose you so you have not chosen me but I have chosen you so you didn't choose God but God has chosen you notice that then from him choosing you then you can choose to serve him and ordained you that you should go and bring forth fruit so notice why he chose you to bring forth fruit that you should go and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain amen that who whatsoever he shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you these things I command you that you love one another notice that's a commandment if the world hate you you know that it hated me before it hated you if you were of the world the world would love his own but because you are not of the world but I have chosen you out of the world therefore the world hateth you remember the word that I've said unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord if you have they have persecuted me they will also persecute you if you have kept my sayings they will keep yours also but all these things will they do unto you for my name's sake because they have not known him that sent me he may be seated so we notice that God has chosen us to live in this world of sin he's chosen you not just to say you believe in him but to Bear fruits in your life and we'll read a quote before so in uh Christ The Mystery of God revealed a brother Branham says these three things why Jesus was revealed and we'll get into these things right now the first thing was that God wanted to reveal himself to the people so God had a longing to be revealed to his people and he couldn't do that as a great Jehovah God who covered all space-time and Eternity he could not he's too great to ever be revealed to the people because it would be too mysterious how could that great being that never did begin then after you went beyond the circle of hundreds of billions and trillions of years of light space and on out into the infinite into the eternity and a great creature that was all that and still is but what he wanted to do he loved fatherhood think about that for he was a father and the only way that he could express it was to become a son of man that's the reason Jesus kept saying the son of man see they didn't know what he was talking about many of them but now you get it congregation says amen see he wanted to express himself think about that that was his one of his great threefold purposes was to express himself identify himself with the human beings to reveal himself in Christ so he wanted to reveal himself to you guys that's why he chose you to reveal himself to you he knew that there was something inside of you that no one else could see but himself and that's why he chose you to to to redeem you and when he chose you he had expect and expected sorry expectation out of you and we're to be word bearers if God is living inside you we're to the bear that word we're to prophesy that word if we could say it that way so secondly so the first is preeminence was to express himself to identify himself to us so secondly to have preeminence in his bodies of Believers his bride that he might live in the people so a second purpose was to have preeminence in his sons and daughters and now he could he could do that in Adam and Eve but sin separated them so now there had to be some way to get it back so that's why he chose Jesus Christ because that was the only perfect way that he could get us redeemed that he could show us the right way was through Jesus Christ oh my oh we're not this Rich to me even to think of it see think God created this whole plan just for you and I think about that that's how much he loved you he was willing to sacrifice humiliation pain torture he was willing to live as a man for 33 and a half years just because he loved you that much and he knew that was the only way that we could be here right now and be in Heavenly places with him so think about that that's what love is when I think of love that's the definition of love right there love that Drew salvation's plan see what God's purpose was now why didn't he just keep Adam and Eve like that then he would never be able to express his fullness see God had these attributes that he wanted to express to mankind but if mankind never fell he could never express being a savior he can never express being a deliverer he can only stay in that fatherhood because if Adam and Eve never fell then he could never express all the attributes that were inside of him he would never be able to express his fullness his full attributes because he would have been a father there that's true but also he's a savior you say how do you know he's a saver he is because I've had that experience yes and we all have to experience Jesus as a savior you got to experience him as your Lord you got to experience him as your healer as your deliverer I love how uh David in the Book of Psalms said my deliverer my Fortress my strong tower he said he's my rock but we can't ride off the coattails of David you have to experience Jesus Christ in the same way as all those attributes as well because he still is all those attributes to all of us amen and how could he do it only through Jesus Christ how could he be a son only through Jesus Christ how can he be a Healer only through Jesus Christ see all things are wound up in that one person Jesus Christ oh my when I and so just to go back to that in John notice why he chose you and ordained you that you should bring forth fruit and that your fruit should remain and if you notice a tree when a tree is grown and produces fruit the fruit is for others so as we mature as Believers we we begin to produce fruit and that fruit is for others long suffering is for others because I you have to be long suffering yourself but when others come against you you get to be long suffering you have to be patient all these things are fruits that people need to see in our lives and it's okay if we don't have it this very moment but as we mature God expects to see those things in our life and that's why God has chosen Us in this day and age think about all the people in the world who don't know about the message of the hour or don't even care about the message of the hour who've heard it but God knew that at a certain point in your life you would come to receive this message of the hour and the message of the hour what the message hour is is the revealed word the four reveal word revealed to you yes it's not some some cult it's not something this but it's the revealed word God chose a prophet for a reason to reveal this word that's God's order God has an order how he does things and it's for a reason amen and uh number three and thirdly to restore the kingdom to his rightly position that fell by sin the first Adam knows the kingdom of God's inside of you notice that he walked in the cool of the evening so Adam and Eve before the fall they used to what they could walk with God in the cool of the evening they had Fellowship and when when Jesus Christ died on that cross He restored the fellowship that they once had now we have it back so now when we go into prayer you can have precious communion and fellowship with God you don't have to wait till communion service to do that but every day can be communion with God in your homes in your cars whatever you're at so so God loved us so much she wanted to restore back that communication line that was tainted by sin and when Christ died upon that tree every sin that you would commit that you had committed he he felt that and he bore it so we could be clean and so when God sees us he doesn't see sin but he sees Jesus Christ as amen he walked in the cool of the evening with his people talked with them fellowship with them and now sin and death had separate them from his presence and his entire expression did you read that before the foundation of the world to express all of his attributes that what he was let's go to Colossians 2 9 I'm sorry sister Amanda I didn't put that on there so we see God chose us for a specific purpose he just didn't give us he does this doesn't give the Holy Ghost just to give it but he gives a specific purpose so you can continue the works that he could not do at that time because you and I weren't born yet there are certain people that you can reach that I can't and God chose you to bear that word in your community your work Community your home community and that's why he chose us for that purpose he revealed himself to you so you can so he can reveal himself to others through you that's right amen to go to Colossians chapter 2 for in him dwelth all the fullness of the godhead bodily and ye are complete in him amen which is the head of all principality and Power in whom also you are circumcised with the circumcision made without hands so we notice that circumcision in the Old Testament was a type of the Holy Ghost that circumcision now the circumcision of the heart in whom also you're circumcised with the circumcision made without hands in putting off the body of the sins of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ buried with him in baptism notice that when also your Arisen with him through the faith of the operation of God who hath raised him up from the dead and you being dead in your sins in the uncircumcision of your flesh he hath quickened together with him having forgiven you all trespasses so so that that's why he did that for so he could use us in a special way that he that only the only way he can use us so go to John 15 and we'll read verses 1 through 14. so is Christ in you the hope of glory think about that so reverse one in John 15. I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that bearth fruit he perseth it so notice why he does that purging so more fruit can be brought forth in your life so trials and tribulations they either can uh can stop the fruit from growing if you let it or it's an opportunity for more fruits are growing your life because those trials and tribulations come so more growth can be in your life so more of Christ can be preeminent in your life now it says that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which I have spoken on to you so when the words being preached it's a it should cleanse us yes if we have the right attitude if our heart is right that word is going to cleanse you see the flesh is going to hate it but the soul the spirit man is going to love it because it's transforming him is transforming his nature into more of a christ-like nature and that's why Christ died so he could be preeminent in his bride not in the nominal church but in his bride see he knows the nominal church is not going to receive him all the way they may take bits and pieces but he knows his bride The Chosen elect is going to receive all that he has for them he knows that the bride is going to be obedient that when the master says something she's going to follow no matter what no matter if it if it goes against what our plans are because the bride says I want what the Lord wants for my life I want to be on this Earth what you want me to be amen this uh verse verse 4 abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself so we can't we can produce fruits but the kind of fruit God wants us to produce we can only produce it in him because the tree of knowledge the good and evil it had fruit but it's rotten fruit so we got to be feeding off the tree of life in order to feed off the tree of life we have to abide in him that's the kind of fruit he's talking about he doesn't want any old kind of fruit because the devil has fruit that's rotten fruit that's what he gave to Eve and that's why all of mankind uh we had to die because of that the wrong tree that was partook of says abide in me and I in you as a branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me notice that I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit notice that so we abide in Christ we're praying daily we're reading the word daily listen to the message of the hour daily for constantly if our life's engulfed in Christ then we're going to be able we're going to be producing much fruit because he told us if we're abiding in him then we're going to be producing much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch in his withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned notice if you abide in me in my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen hearing is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit I believe that's a commandment he's commanding us that we should be bearing much fruit and he's given us the formula how to do it you have to abide in Christ to produce much fruit no matter what you're going through what situation hardship you have to abide in him because you want to produce fruit in the deepest and darkest trials because others are going to recognize you in the trial this this individual all these bad things are happening to him but he's still able to worship God he's still able to keep keep a smile on his face he's still able to conduct itself in a way that's because you're letting go and submitting yourself unto God saying Lord this trial I know is here for a purpose for a specific reason and I want to make sure I'm producing the right kind of fruit that you want me to produce in this trial amen because you don't want to produce fruit of complaining because it's so easy to produce that kind of fruit that kind of fruit only leads to death because the more you complain we see the children of Israel they complain complain complaining but yet God will still bless him he was getting them through things but they still found something to complain about and I believe we should always be thankful no matter what we're going through because we're going to be a lot worse situation than what we think amen I forgot where we're at uh let's go to verse eight hearing is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit he's speaking to us personally so shall you be my disciples and the father have loved me so I have loved you he's given us uh kind of like a a hand he says continue ye in my love and look at verse 10 brother Jonathan says if you keep my Commandments ye shall abide in my love notice that so we have to be obedient see like brother Jonathan said it's not just the Ten Commandments that we keep but Christ when he's speaking to us those are Commandments you can't just take or leave those things he said if you keep my Commandments you shall abide in my love we want that that christ-like love we have to keep his Commandments even as I've kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love see God has given us a formula to live a life above sin but if you're not obedient to God then you can't live a life above sin it's impossible go to verse 11. these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you see we're looking for joy in all the wrong places he told us how to have joy you got to keep his Commandments that you can abide in his love and that Joy will remain that Joy will remain when your family turns your back against you when you lose your job when you filling the blank whatever it is that Joy will remain because you're because happiness is based upon circumstances in your life but joy doesn't look at circumstances Joy looks in God's word Joy looks to Jesus Christ because Jesus Christ in order one so Joy looks to the word and says my God's going to provide all my needs it's going to say but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you amen these things have I spoken unto you that my joy might remain in you and that your joy might be full look at verse 13 says Greater Love verse 12. this is my commandment he's speaking to us again that you love one another as I have loved you he doesn't say uh take up this person uh deserves a I don't have to love this person he's done so many so many rotten things to me I I don't have to be nice to this person I have to love this person no he says this is my commandment that you love one another as I have loved you so you've given us commitment to love it says 13 greater love hath no man than this that a man laid down his life for his friends and Jesus showed us what love is Father forgive them they know not what they do verse 14 Year my friend notice you are my friends if you do whatsoever I command you so if you want to be a friend of God you have to be obedient to God as we heard a wonderful men's meaning obedience ties the whole thing together because you can worship you can pray and all these things but if you're not be obedient to the voice of God all those other things aren't going to matter because obedience is better than sacrifice always God is looking for a Believer who will take him at his word amen so like we said before we cannot bring forth fruit unless we are abiding in Jesus Christ what is fruit so we are liking the trees so whatever whatsoever things we're feeding on is going to be what we're going to produce in our life whatever time whatever you're spending your free time on is going to be what you're going to produce in your life so if I'm just watching movies all day and all night uh soap operas and TV shows and reading romance novels that's what's going to happen I'm going to start producing those things but if I'm reading the word every day if I'm saying Lord reveal yourself to me your word I want to see you in every line every phrase every scripture point me to the scripture you want me to read let the word that I'm reading become life in me so I can live it out and not just know it here but live it out in my life and if I'm listening to the message of the hour say Lord speak to me through your Prophet I don't want to just hear something I don't want to hear but I want to hear something that's directly from you speaking to me and I want to live that out guess what you're going to start producing Jesus Christ in your life because because that's the formula literally whatever you that's a black dog and a white dog inside of you the white dog's the spirit man the black dog is your flesh if you're feeding the white dog the white dog is going to be the one who's going to be on top every time but you got to be feeding that white dog amen so wherever fruit we're bearing is gonna it so whatever's on the inside of us is what's going the fruit's gonna bear on the outside that's a manifestation of what's on the inside of you amen notice what Jesus said though he said much fruit not a tiny bit of fruit but much fruit if we're truly abiding him our life will produce much fruit amen so I looked the word what commandment is it's a command a mandate or an order or injunction given by Authority charge or precepts so so like paying your taxes that could be considered a commandment because if you don't pay your taxes eventually you're going to be thrown in jail and owe a lot of money to IRS or with anything uh speeding the speed limit says 75 and you're going 105 down the highway eventually you will be caught and thrown in jail and maybe even lose your license so those things are Commandments but we're the commands we're talking about is the Commandments of what Jesus is telling us to do what the word of God is telling us to do because look through all throughout the Bible God is speaking to us and those are Commandments so let's go to First John 5 2-3 first John 5 2-3 like I said before God chose you think about that out everybody in this world he chose us to be here he's placed it in your heart to to be sitting in these seats to hear from him now the word that he speaks to us tonight we either choose to leave it here or we choose to bring it with us out in the mission field so wherever we go outside these doors I believe is considered the mission field we're all missionaries in a sense we're all word bearers so so that when we go back to our communities to our jobs we have a uh obligation we have a opportunity to be ambassadors as he's called us to be he's given us the ministry of reconciliation so if you've been reconciled go help reconcile somebody else I believe that's what the Holy Ghost was sent for it wasn't just sent for to supply all our our physical needs but the Holy Ghost was sent to win souls to him because we don't know who's bride who's not bride out in our communities we don't that's why you got to cast your bread upon the Water give everybody brother bran said this statement uh it's not I'm paraphrasing it if somebody started the gospel twice somebody should be able to hear the gospel at least once I'm paraphrasing but you know what I mean so if somebody hasn't heard the gospel they should at least have an opportunity here at one time that other person's heard it five times already because every person is gonna have a choice either they they either receive the Gospel or they reject it you can't get them by Revelation I can't give him by Revelation but what I can do is I can give my this lay my life down because Jesus that's how he taught us to live that example to lay our life down to edify somebody Paul said I became all things to all men that I might win some so Paul knew he wouldn't win everybody but he still gave his heart into trying to win that soul to Christ so I said first John 2 and verses two through three first time first John chapter 5 verses two through three so it says whosoever by this we know that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments notice that if we truly love God we're going to be obedient to his words for this is the love of God look at that he's giving us for this is the love of God that's the giving us the definition right here that we keep his Commandments notice that that's how important it is to God and his Commandments are not Grievous see they're Grievous if we start complaining why we have to do this but what does a lamb do a lamb submits it it submits itself to share so like that song says share all my rights away in this world of sin I am so needy so a lamb knows it has rights but it's willing to lay itself down to the Master's shears willing to let go of his plans and hopes and dreams and follow the Commandments even the Commandments don't agree with uh his plans he he he's willing to slide those planes away and throw him away to be obedient to Christ for whosoever is born of God overcometh the world that's why it's so important to receive the new birth because if we receive that new birth that the Sea of the Holy Ghost that's the overcoming power we need this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith and we're gonna go let's go to um second John 1 6. so it says and this is love so notice that again this chapter is talking about this is love what love is it's really defining What Love Is that we walk after his Commandments this is the Commandment that you've heard from the beginning you shall walk in it so we're not preaching new gospel this gospel is Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever and from the beginning it started with obedience and at the end it's obedience Adam and Eve have a chance had a chance to be obedient and they chose not to be obedient so we should learn from that example to When God Says something just do it just do it because you'll save yourself a lot of heart heartache and trouble just doing that and we see through the prophet's testimony of his uh of his life that he he told us the ways of a transgressor or a heart so he told he said when God says something just do it no matter if your mom doesn't agree with it or your wife doesn't agree with it or whoever if it's from God it will always line up with the word it always dovetail so let's go to um I'm gonna read this so John 14 21 he that hath my Commandments in keepeth them he it is that loveth me so notice that if if we say we love God and we're not obedient to God then we don't really don't love God you know it's as simple as like for instance example if uh if somebody's married a man's married and he keeps cheating on his wife and says he loves them say he loves her he's a liar because he's not being faithful that's the same scenario in that you may not be doing that uh you know in the natural but not being true to Jesus Christ by not being obedient to him it's like you're cheating on him it really is because it's telling us what love is right here he that has my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him so the more obedient we can be to him the more God is going to be willing to just pour himself out and reveal himself to you so Jesus told us how to become friends with him let's go to jail I'm just going to read this James 2 23 if you want to turn there and the scripture was fulfilled with saith Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of God so Abraham just took God at his word that's why the scripture says he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief so we he's the father of our faith for a reason so we're to follow after his footsteps to take God at his word and think about Abraham's life he never had a bible to read he never had brothers and sisters like we have but he was still willing to take God at his word and God blessed them for that and God will bless you if you're obedient to him if you're willing to follow what he's speaking to you brother Bram said this statement God is not obligated to give you any more light if you're not following the light that he's giving you right now so think about that maybe some things in our lives that God has told us to do but we kind of brushed underneath the carpet that's why it's so important to unturn every stone to make sure say Lord there's anything that you told me to do that I forgot please make it known to me I want to do I want to be pleasing unto you I want to be I want you to call me friend let's go to Matthew 7. foreign so God just didn't choose us just to sit and and church and just hear the word and not do anything with it but God chose us to go out and win souls to his kingdom God chose us to have our nature changed every day because if you want to win somebody to Christ Our nature is going to have to change because they can't see us they must see Jesus Christ in us that's how you win somebody over to Christ they got to see that love like brother Mike said organically radiating out of you see a sheep doesn't manufacture a wool but what does a sheep do it Bears wool and we have to bear the fruits of God so the tree does it Bears apples it doesn't have to force itself but it comes natural so go to Matthew 7 16. I think Matthew 7 16. or is it Matt I'm sorry maybe Matthew 6. no no I'm sorry it's Matthew 7 17. so it says even so every good tree bringeth forth good fruits but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruits a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can it corrupt tree bring forth good fruit so a tree So it's talking to us so we can't be bad and good at the same time you just can't it's like you can't be drunk and sober at the same time either so if I'm if I drink alcohol even a little bit tiny a bit and I'm driving I get pulled over and they breathalyzed me and there's that in my system I'm gonna go to jail and have to pay ten thousand dollars whether I like it or not even though it's a little bit but the thing is you're still uh drunk is drunk black is black white is white simple as that no matter if it's a little bit of sin or a lot of bit of sin sin sin you can't say well I'm sinning a little bit I'm okay God doesn't see it that way either you're sinning or you're not sinning it's cut and dry either you're serving God or you're not serving God cut and dry a good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit neither can a crop tree bring forth good fruit every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire no it says wherefore by their fruits you shall know them and then we'll hop over to James three eleven man time just flies huh so James 3 and we'll start with verse 11. so it says death a fountain send forth at the same place Sweet Water and bitter water I read on the board verse 12. can the Fig Tree my brother and bear Olive berries either a Vine fig so can no Fountain both yield salt water and fresh water verse 13. who was a wise man and endued with knowledge among you let him shoot out of a good conversation his works with meekness and wisdom think about those are fruits right there let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom verse 14 please but if you have bitter and envying and strife in your hearts Glory not and lie not against the truth verse 15 please the wisdom that descendeth not from above but is Earthly sensual devilish verse 16. for where envying and strife is there is confusion and error evil work those are the fruits of the devil that's the kind of that's the kind of fruits that he produces the kind of fruits that we're produced in the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil verse 17 please but the wisdom that is from above is first what you're here then Peaceable gentle and easy to be entreated look I love this full of mercy and look at that and good fruits without partiality and without hypocrisy so those are the kind of fruits that we need to producing in our life and if we're not producing right now God has given us opportunity to be able to produce those fruits if and only if we abide in him daily and we'll go to verse 18. notice and the fruits of righteousness is sown in peace of them that make peace so you know you know God has called us to be peacemakers right so think about that we can make peace in a situation we can make joy in a situation God has placed himself inside of us so he's given us the authority and power to be able to produce those things in a situation but you have to be inviting in him to use it properly you don't want to misuse The Authority that God has given you so for a bearing the fruit of God in our life we'll be laying our life down for others we'll be reaching out for lost souls second Corinthians 5 11 says knowing therefore the terror of the lord we persuade men but we are made manifest unto God and I trust also May manifest in your consciousness so I got this quote right here from the hidden Life of Christ I'm going to read says the world is so dead and empty to you anymore till you simply can't have any pleasure here nothing but just winning souls to Christ is all you can get pleasure out of I love that Lord help me to get there did you know the marking of the angel that was sent forth to seal with the Holy Ghost only seal those who sighed and cried for the Abominations done in the city Ezekiel 9. did you ever read it not those who shouted and danced those who sighed and cried for the Abominations did in the city only ones that were sealed so God has has called each one as for a special mission you can choose to accept it or not so then God shows you for a special Mission he placed you in this age because this is the only age he knew that he wanted you in think about that that he chose you to go out and bear his word he chose to use you to go win his soul that's how much he loved you that he he wanted to place you in the most hardest age to overcome but we can overcome this age through him through his blood as we'll read a little bit later so just to think about that that God chose you for this special assignment and we got to accept our responsibility because he promised to be with you and in you I know this was the scripture wasn't here but this came into my heart let me go to Joshua Joshua 1. if you put that in a boar sister Amanda please Joshua 1. and so what do you like the 47 verses Joshua one sorry so Joshua I just love Joshua chapter one because it's just it's just so beautiful I will read it here I just I just love it so in Joshua chapter one it says now after the death of Moses the servant of the Lord it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua with the son of none Moses Minister saying verse two please Moses my servant is dead brother Branham has gone off the scene but his voice is still here the message that he brought to us Jesus Christ is still here he says now therefore arise go over this Jordan thou and all this people into the land in which I have given to them even to the children of Israel verse 3 please every place that the soil of your foot shall tread upon that have I given unto you as I said unto Moses verse 4 please so we just love that from from the Wilderness and this Lebanon even to the Great River and the river Euphrates all the land the High Tides unto the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your Coast so we shouldn't let any Giant stay in our land God has given us the possession we got to go and possess that land don't let the dead Don't Let The Devil stay in your land we we have the power through God to like David did hit that giant right in the eye knocked him down and cut his head off don't let any devil let you live below the privilege God is calling you to verse 5 please so we I just there shall not be any man and be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so I'll be with thee amen so he's speaking to you too right now as I was with Moses Saul be with you greater is in you than he that is in the world he said I'll be with you until the end of the world I will not fail thee nor forsake thee God cannot fail that's the only thing he cannot do is fail he can't fail you let's go to verse six please be strong and of good courage For unto this people shall I divide for inheritance the land which I swear unto them by their fathers to give them verse 7 please amen so it's telling us to be strong and of good courage I love that so no matter what you're going through be strong and of good courage because the gods you serve is overall only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe oh look at that to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded me notice it's talking about obedience again turn not from it to the right hand to the left that thou mayest Prosper that thou mayest Prosper whatsoever thou goest so obedience is so important is even talking about the Old Testament right now if you want to prosper be obedient to God follow his Commandments whatsoever thou goest let's go to verse 8. this book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth but thou shall meditate therein day and night that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein now you yourself cannot do all this law in the natural God has to write the laws upon your heart and upon your mind so it becomes organic and that's why it's so important to spend time with God because his Commandments are not Grievous if you're connected in him just like if I if I'm vacuuming and I unplug it it's not going to have any power source but if I'm connected to the power source I can vacuum all day and all night so if we're connected to the power source which is Jesus Christ we can live a life above sin that that's the ticket that's the key let's go to verse nine this is thou shall have good success verse 9 and we'll think we'll stop after verse 9. heaven and I commanded thee be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed don't don't be afraid if you can't pay the bill this month don't be afraid if everything uh is going wrong it says of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed let God be God in your life stop trying to be God let God be God in your life submit to him draw an eye to God and he'll draw an eye to you see neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God look at that is with thee with you brother Bruce with you sister Gabriel with you brother Roger he's with thee whatsoever thou goest amen amen so why did God choose us I'm gonna read verse John 16 33 again these things have outspoken unto you that in me you might have peace notice that in the world you should have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world so God chose us to be Overcomers in this dark sinful world we can be Overcomers I don't care how dark the government's getting I don't care X Y and Z is if God is for us who can be against us Revelations 3 to him that overcometh well I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame so if Jesus said this statement I believe in I forgot where he said I think in Matthew all power is given to me in heaven and in Earth so there is no devil that can stop you as long as you're in the Christ in the Fortress because he's your Fortress but if you go outside the Fortress you have no more protection but if I stay inside the Fortress no matter what Dark Storm what Devil comes before me I know I can March through him I could go right through it because God is with me amen first John 5 4 for whatsoever for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith you overcome by the blood of the lamb and your testimony that's how you overcome that's from the resurrection of last let's go to Revelations chapter 12 verse 11. so we're going to find out how we overcome this evil sinful age brother Brahm says the hardest age to live in but it's not impossible to live in I'll tell you that because With God all things are possible so Revelations 12 11 and we'll read that let me get there to myself so it says and they overcame him by what by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony so for meeting with Jesus we should have a testimony God should be moving in our life every day we should have a testimony we should be able to testify if we're truly a body in Christ then we should have a testimony of our nature being changed a little bit each and every day because that's what happens fruit begins to Bear more and more and more as a tree matures fruit begins to be more prevalent and somebody begins they could take that tree take a bite of it and say um this is good where are you getting this fruit from anybody would Point them right to Jesus Christ right there and right there so it says and they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony look at right here this is the key and they love not their lives unto death see it's okay to have nice things in life it's okay to have a nice car a nice house but don't let those things take the place of Jesus Christ because anything you put before God is an idol I don't care what it is if it's your kids your spouse it's an idol so we got to make sure that we're putting things in the right priority Christ needs to be the number one priority every single day and if he's the number one priority all things will begin to fall in place those bills that need to be played are going to fall into place the health you need is going to fall into place the house you need the car you need is going to fall into the place but God has to be first say God I need more of your Holy Ghost than me I I can't be the person you want me to be unless more of you is living inside of me and I'm willing to do whatever it takes I'm willing to give up whatever I have to give up I'm desperate to have you in the center of my life at all times Jesus gave us the example how to do it now we want to know how to overcome Jesus told us how to do it see humility that's the key he gird himself he took a towel and washed the disciples feet and wiped him I think we're afraid to get dirty and watch somebody's feet spiritually if you want to overcome if you want to help somebody you got to be willing to wash somebody's feet and be willing to help somebody well no matter what it takes and Jesus was willing to help no matter what it took he was willing to be a to humiliate himself he didn't care what he had he's a blood Brown said a foot wash uh flunky as they would say he girded himself took a towel and watched his disciples feet the very God Of Heaven humiliated himself think about that we don't want to be humiliated that's the reason women don't want their hair to go out that's the reason they don't want to dress like ladies should dress like men don't want to see it's the same thing they don't get humiliated but Jesus constantly looked who he was greatness I'm gonna say something greatness humiliates itself great humbles itself greatness that's why John the Baptist could say I must decrease so Christ can increase the more we can humble ourselves the more Christ can be exalted in each one of our personal lives and that's why he chose us so he can be exalted in our life so he can be manifested in our life that's the that's what fruit is now back there before the foundation of the world check this out God chose you in Christ Jesus to appear holy at the end time I don't care if all that we got women have dressing men half naked I don't care but he chose you in Christ to appear holy at the end time not disadressing but inwardly because if inwardly it works going on then you're going to address right you're gonna talk right You're Gonna Act Right but it's so important to focus on the inside the soul because anybody can can throw a skirt on and say they're Christian but you want to see the life behind the skirt you want to see that light that's inside that the the person who's wearing a suit and tie you want to see behind what's in there that's the fruit that's so important I'm read that again now back before the foundation of the world God chose you in Christ to appear holy at the end time all the way from the foundation of the world do you see it God chose you to live a life above sin to live an overcoming life every day don't let the devil beat you down for what you did in the past or what you didn't do you got to look forward press towards the mark don't look at all those things that you didn't do or or I was a bad man that's not you anymore God is calling you to a nature change God is calling you to win souls God is calling you to be like him he became you that you could become like we could become him that's why he did that for second Corinthians chapter six we then as workers together with him beseech you also that you receive not the grace of God in vain verse 2 for he saith I have heard thee in a Time accepted and in the day of salvation I have secured thee behold now is the accepted time behold now is the day of salvation verse 3 giving no offense in anything that the ministry be not blamed so when we go outside we're representing Christ don't bring a bad reproach to it so it's so important the way we live our life if we go fly off the handle somebody's gonna see that yes we can apologize for it but if we were aware of the situation at the time we wouldn't have flew off the handle and I'm guilty of it too put myself right in the chopping block says but all things are proving ourselves as the Ministers of God in much patience as fruits afflictions in Necessities in distresses in Stripes notice all these things are sufferings and you can't you can't Reign unless you suffer so if you want more to Christ you have to suffer to get it and when I say that suffering is your flesh your flesh is going to be one that's suffering so in stripes imprisonments and tumults and labors in watchings and fastings fasting I believe is very important uh because you're crucifying your flesh fasting and praying is a very good calm I'm not saying that fast seven days a week but even even one day a week I believe would do some some mighty good because fasting is is such an important you just you know brother Ferguson did a study on fasting and I believe something like a sister Beckman said we should be doing this is something that really gets you closer helps you get closer to God so let's keep going verse verse uh six by pureness by knowledge by long-suffering by kindness by the Holy Ghost by unfeigned Love by the word of Truth by the power of God by the armor of righteousness on the right hand and on the left by Honor and dishonor by evil report in goodport as deceivers and yet true as unknown and yet well known as dying and behold we live as chasten and not killed as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many Rich notice that as sorrowful yet always rejoicing as poor yet making many Rich so you have you have a you have a rich you have something rich inside of you which is Jesus Christ and we gotta be given that to people that that's the you can give somebody a million dollars but that will do them no good that's the greatest riches you can ever have is Jesus Christ as having nothing yet we have all things because we have Jesus Christ inside of us amen we may not have as much money as we want in a bank account we may not have have much young age as we want or or less aching and pains but what you have is greater than all that because he didn't come to redeem these bodies he came to redeem what's inside of here and we got to reach somebody what's inside of here don't look at the outward appearance of somebody but the inward appearance is so much more important because that's what God he came to redeem and brother Braham said this statement one soul is worth more than ten thousand World think about that you were worth more than ten thousand worlds to God think about that as uh as many things have nothing yet possessing all things amen now I want you to notice this is the beginning of Christianity of the church and I want you to notice this is from Israel in the church the first one I want you to notice it wasn't because Abraham was a good man he didn't choose you because you were good and all these things because God elected and chose Abraham it wasn't Abraham's choosing God it was God choosing Abraham you can see it in our watch so he knew that Abraham would make that decision to follow him obediently but but once again it's still your choice that Brother Bruce said it's not just some some path that is created like some Greek mythology it's a path that you have to choose you have to walk of your own choosing now it was it was then so is today it isn't you choosing God is God choosing you think about that will be Revelations 21 6-8 and then we'll read a quote no close so Revelations 21 6-8 and he said unto me it is done I am the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end I will give unto him that is the thirst of the Fountain of Water of Life freely so whoever is thirsty drink on it we sing that song There's a we're saying that song there's a fountain if you're thirsty come and drink we need to be drinking at that Fountain more than we have been we have to verse 7 says he that overcometh shall inherit all things so God is calling us to be Overcomers and if we overcome all things will inherit will inherit all things it says and I will be his God and he shall be my son God has given you the overcoming power you need and it's in the Holy Ghost and you can't get any overcoming power outside of that help classes won't help motivational books won't help but the Holy Ghost is going to give you all the overcoming power that you need to overcome any and everything but you have to be willing to submit yourself to the Holy Ghost you have to but the fearful and unbelieving and the Abominable and the murderers and the whoremongers and the sorcerers and adulterers and the Liars shall all have their part in the lake which burns with fire in Brimstone which is the second death so I believe I believe we're none of those things I believe that we're Overcomers and you got to believe whatever situation that you're in that the god inside you can give you the strength you need to overcome it no matter if you've been there doing it for years months weeks God can give you the overcoming strength but you have to believe that you can do that you got to let go of the thing that's taking you away from God and brother Brahm said the same we're living a million miles below our privilege God has called us not to be Paupers not to be Sinners but he called us to be Sons and Daughters of God he calls us to be Kings and Priests he's calling us to be all these things but if we're not feeding on him and abiding in him and working on our personal relationship with God then we're not going to be able to recognize who we are because what are our idea what's our identity really is we'll go to Galatians 2 20. because our identity isn't described by some personality type but our identity is in Christ so Galatians 2 20. I am crucified with Christ nevertheless I live yet not I but Christ liveth in me that's your identity right there and the life which I now live in the flesh I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself fullness by Paul could say I know nothing but Christ and him crucified that's your identity as Jesus Christ your Miss Jesus Christ you're not X Y and Z about this personality over here but you're the word is going to identify who you are every single day every single night what makes what makes the people cry and shout and go on what's the matter it's the holy ghost moving in them if they could only realize and embrace him embrace the Holy Ghost believe him hug him to your bosom live right do nothing that would hinder him say oh Lord Jesus I want you I want you to stand by me I'm going to stand by you father and as you do he is just pressing to get into you he wants sitting there he is wooing you to him all the time now friends I know that to be the truth I know people realize who you are every person in here can live life above sin notice that every person in here can live life above sin I believe we all can do that can't live without sin Living God you'll make mistakes but the blood of Christ will forgive you that's why the scripture says be zealous therefore and repent you're going to make mistakes you're human but don't let those mistakes Define your future is going to be learn from those mistakes take take take take some time to recognize what led up to those mistakes because you want to make the same mistake again and ask for the same thing again repentance over the same exact thing be zealous therefore repent return away from that and just keep moving forward don't make the same mistake again mistakes but the blood of Christ will forgive you father forgive them for they know not what they do is that right that same power of Christ that was hung on calvary's cross the same God that raised him up on the day of the Resurrection is in you now you that's got the Holy Ghost oh don't you love him so that same power that was that was a hung on calvary's Cross is waiting for you to tap into it you have to be willing to tap into it it's like for instance I have all these I have all these nice to have a bank account I have all this money and if I can't tap into it's going to do me no good so that's like the riches of Christ he's given us a check sign his name and and like that but if we're not if we can't tap into it what good is it going to do us we got to tap into the things that God has given us and that's through worship through prayer through Revelation through obedience that's how it gets tapped into all those things get tapped into just like that man we get to stand so God chose us for a special assignment how many is willing to do that assignment how many is willing to accept that their mission this is bow our heads dear heavenly father we thank you Lord just for being here this evening Lord as we come here today Lord we want to just be obedient to the things that you've spoken to us Lord you chose us before the foundation of the world you chose us to live a life above sin and Lord From This Day Forward

obedient to you we want to be we want you to call us your friend as you called Abraham your friend and Lord every commandment you've given us in this Bible we want to follow everything you tell us not to do we want to follow everything you tell us to do we want to follow Lord Jesus has helped us Lord I pray we're needy Jesus Christ and we pray amen can we sing I know it was the blood how many know that I know it was the blood I know it was the blood I know it was the blood for me one day when I was lost he died upon the cross I know it
