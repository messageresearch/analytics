[28:04] well if you turn with me tonight to
[28:08] first thessalonians chapter 5
[28:11] praise the lord
[28:20] first thessalonians chapter 5 verse 1 he
[28:23] says
[28:25] but of the times and of the seasons
[28:27] brethren
[28:28] ye have no need that i write unto you
[28:31] for you yourselves know perfectly that
[28:34] the day of the lord so cometh as a thief
[28:36] in the night for when they say peace and
[28:40] safety
[28:40] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[28:43] as travail
[28:44] upon a woman with child and they shall
[28:46] not escape
[28:47] but ye brethren are not in darkness that
[28:50] that day
[28:51] should overtake you as a thief
[28:54] you are all of the children of light and
[28:57] the children
[28:58] of the day and we are not of the night
[29:01] nor
[29:01] of darkness therefore let us not sleep
[29:04] as
[29:04] other as do others but let us watch and
[29:07] be sober
[29:08] for they that sleep sleep in the night
[29:11] and they that be drunken
[29:13] are drunken in the night but let us who
[29:16] are of the day
[29:17] be sober putting on the breastplate of
[29:20] faith and love
[29:21] and for a helmet the hope of salvation
[29:25] for god hath not appointed us to wrath
[29:28] but to obtain salvation by our lord
[29:31] jesus christ
[29:32] who died for us that whether we wake or
[29:35] sleep
[29:36] we should live together with him
[29:39] wherefore comfort yourselves together
[29:42] and edify one another even as also
[29:45] ye do amen it's bar hits for word of
[29:48] prayer
[29:49] dear lord jesus we're needy father
[29:52] tonight
[29:54] lord but we come to him that is the most
[29:58] sufficient god
[30:00] and lord jesus you've been tried on
[30:01] every point
[30:03] you've been tested every place where we
[30:05] would be tested
[30:06] and you have overcome and we pray lord
[30:09] tonight that you'll come and
[30:11] cleanse our hearts our hands lord jesus
[30:14] may you come and break the bread of life
[30:16] to us lord
[30:17] may you just come and be our guest lord
[30:19] we love you
[30:20] we invite your presence in jesus
[30:23] christ's name we ask it
[30:24] amen amen you may be seated amen
[30:28] praise the lord amen
[30:31] so sometimes well
[30:35] it's good for us to read
[30:38] scriptures that are should be familiar
[30:43] they should be familiar sometimes it's
[30:46] been years since we've read things but
[30:48] i'd like to speak
[30:49] tonight on discerning the signs of the
[30:52] times
[30:54] so
[30:57] paul when he wrote to the thessalonian
[30:59] church he says but of the times and of
[31:01] the seasons brethren
[31:02] you have no need that i write unto you
[31:04] for you yourselves know perfectly that
[31:07] the day of the lord so cometh
[31:09] as a thief in the night so we know that
[31:11] over the ages you know people have
[31:13] predicted when jesus is coming and when
[31:15] he's not coming and
[31:16] and and then they make all kinds of
[31:18] predictions and then they don't come to
[31:19] pass and
[31:20] but they they just keep going on and on
[31:22] and on
[31:24] but paul writing to the church he said i
[31:27] shouldn't have to write this to you
[31:28] because you know perfectly that the day
[31:30] of the lord so cometh as a thief in the
[31:32] night
[31:33] for when they shall say peace and safety
[31:35] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[31:37] as travail upon a woman with child and
[31:40] they shall not escape
[31:41] amen he says but ye brethren are not in
[31:44] darkness now if you look at the way he
[31:47] wrote this
[31:48] he says he's coming as a thief in the
[31:50] night so he's
[31:51] he's telling them it's going to be a
[31:53] dark time when he comes
[31:56] but he said you're not in darkness
[32:00] you're not there amen
[32:03] you are the children of the light he
[32:07] says
[32:07] you are not in darkness that that day
[32:09] should overtake you as a thief
[32:12] you are all the children of light and
[32:14] the children of the day
[32:16] and we are none of the night nor of
[32:18] darkness
[32:19] so no matter how uncertain it is no
[32:22] matter how crazy things are
[32:24] we're not moved by these things
[32:32] paul said he said i i shouldn't even
[32:34] have to write this to you he says
[32:36] because you should know these things
[32:37] amen you are the children of the day
[32:40] praise the lord amen he says therefore
[32:44] let us not
[32:45] sleep amen let us not sleep
[32:49] metaphorically that means to yield to
[32:52] become slothful
[32:54] and to be comfortable with sin
[32:58] to being different about your salvation
[33:02] becomes no longer valuable to you
[33:06] well i'm saved i guess i'm all right i'm
[33:08] gonna make it anyways
[33:10] that's what happens when you fall asleep
[33:13] you fall asleep at the wheel or you fall
[33:16] asleep on the couch
[33:17] you are oblivious to everything that's
[33:19] going on
[33:20] so if your wife is making dinner you
[33:22] don't even smell dinner anymore
[33:25] because you become oblivious to it if
[33:28] you're driving that's a bad place to
[33:29] become oblivious
[33:31] and in this day in this hour we're the
[33:33] children of the light
[33:35] it's not a time for us to fall asleep at
[33:37] the wheel
[33:39] it's not a time for us to be comfortable
[33:41] with sin
[33:43] he says but let us watch and be sober
[33:46] amen and that means to be vigilant
[33:50] amen a vigilant man is somebody who's
[33:53] who's detail-oriented he's careful
[33:58] like when you're going on a trip it's a
[34:00] good thing not to forget
[34:02] certain things like your toothbrush or
[34:05] your shaver
[34:06] or half your clothes and you have to be
[34:09] vigilant
[34:10] to make sure that everything is ready do
[34:12] i have my passport
[34:13] do i have all everything that i need in
[34:15] this day and age do i have my mask
[34:18] how many times you get out of your car
[34:19] and you're halfway to the store and
[34:20] you're going
[34:21] oh gotta get the mask go get the mask
[34:25] be vigilant brethren for they that sleep
[34:31] sleep in the night
[34:34] those that have they that have become
[34:37] partakers of sin
[34:39] and that they're not doing it in the
[34:42] daytime
[34:43] they're doing it in the night and that's
[34:48] when the lord is coming the lord isn't
[34:50] coming in a bright day
[34:52] he's coming in the night
[34:56] amen and they that are drunken
[35:00] are drunken in the night
[35:03] i mean you you're pretty bound up with
[35:05] alcohol if you're drunk during the day
[35:08] but at night people don't mind letting
[35:10] their hair down at night just a couple
[35:12] glasses of wine i think i'll just have a
[35:13] little more you know and it because
[35:16] it's their labors are over with they
[35:18] think everything's done it's finished
[35:20] it's time for me to relax
[35:22] this is not a time for us to relax
[35:26] amen but let us who are of the day
[35:31] be sober putting on the breastplate
[35:34] of faith and love and for a helmet the
[35:38] hope of salvation
[35:39] amen and i like that the hope of
[35:42] salvation
[35:43] it means to have a joyful and confident
[35:46] expectation of eternal salvation
[35:50] amen
[35:53] yeah in the darkness
[35:57] i have an expectation for salvation
[36:00] i'm not going to fail amen and why do i
[36:04] know that i'm not going to fail he says
[36:06] for god hath not appointed us
[36:10] to wrath the world is appointed to wrath
[36:15] but he has not appointed you to wrath
[36:18] when you got baptized it you you felt
[36:22] that you needed to repent
[36:23] and you got repented and you got
[36:25] baptized
[36:26] and the expectation is that god is going
[36:29] to keep his word
[36:30] and he's going to fill you with the holy
[36:32] ghost because that's what the scripture
[36:34] says
[36:35] the scriptures here says he has not
[36:37] appointed us to wrath
[36:40] so get that out of your mind it's a
[36:43] scareful time yes because
[36:45] some of us have been around for a long
[36:47] time
[36:48] for me coming up on 45 years i've been
[36:51] serving the lord
[36:53] i mean it's a long time but i've gotten
[36:56] slothful
[36:57] and i've gotten comfortable and and i've
[37:00] forgotten
[37:02] that this is an hour when jesus is
[37:05] coming
[37:05] amen amen i want you to take a look
[37:09] at zechariah 14
[37:13] because this is a scripture that
[37:19] that we should all be familiar with
[37:22] he says in verse 6 he says but it shall
[37:25] come to pass
[37:26] in that day that the light shall not be
[37:29] clear
[37:29] nor dark well paul
[37:32] said the lord is coming as a thief in
[37:35] the night
[37:37] now here's a day that zechariah said
[37:40] there's coming a day
[37:42] that the light will be not clear nor
[37:44] dark it'll be just
[37:45] kind of
[37:48] gloomy you know you get up in the
[37:50] morning and it's just kind of misty and
[37:52] there's fog and you can't
[37:54] you know you're not really excited about
[37:55] getting out of bed
[37:57] you know when you get up and you go out
[37:59] and and then if it's right around the
[38:01] freezing time where all that
[38:02] fog instantly turns to ice when you
[38:04] start to drive down the road
[38:06] then that kind of really aggravates you
[38:07] right
[38:09] that's not a day that you're very
[38:10] excited about but if you get up in the
[38:12] morning and the sun is shining and the
[38:14] birds are singing and
[38:15] else you get up there's just something
[38:16] about that but the
[38:18] hour that we live in right now is not
[38:21] that
[38:21] day
[38:25] it shall not be clear nor dark but it
[38:28] should be one day which will be
[38:30] known to the lord because he's coming as
[38:34] a thief
[38:36] the lord only knows what day that will
[38:38] be
[38:40] and it would not day nor night
[38:43] but it shall come to pass that at the
[38:46] evening time
[38:47] when it's all gloomy and it's all
[38:50] confusion and everything's going on
[38:52] there will be light because
[38:55] you are the children of the day
[39:00] you are the children of the light
[39:04] and you are not dark you're not in
[39:06] darkness so you're not
[39:08] dead you're not drunken you're not
[39:10] falling asleep
[39:12] amen amen this is an
[39:15] hour when when you can feel it there's
[39:19] so much
[39:20] animosity against people you can't even
[39:23] oh don't have an opinion no more
[39:24] no opinions opinions are gone everything
[39:28] is
[39:28] such there's such a tension
[39:32] that people are so they're so nervous
[39:35] about everything
[39:38] but you know what the lord has thoughts
[39:41] of peace
[39:42] towards me we just read that
[39:48] you are not appointed to wrath
[39:51] amen so you have to believe what the
[39:54] word of god has said
[39:56] in the uniting time in sign brother
[39:58] branham said so we're talking
[40:00] of this uniting time the sign of the
[40:02] uniting time see
[40:04] jesus was here in this last scripture
[40:06] reading
[40:07] he was rebuking the clergy for not being
[40:09] able to discern the time
[40:11] or the sign of the time and that's
[40:14] always been a great
[40:16] thing to the people see to be able to
[40:19] discern the sign of the time
[40:21] that we are living in because god writes
[40:24] it plainly
[40:25] so nobody could escape it
[40:28] there's so much uncertainty everybody i
[40:30] mean
[40:31] sister patricia your whole world is
[40:34] uncertain
[40:35] who's next be not afraid
[40:38] it is high
[40:43] all the all the blood it was it was the
[40:46] foundation of the new jerusalem
[40:49] the 12 apostles is the foundation of the
[40:52] city
[40:53] in the book of revelation and they were
[40:56] all upset
[40:57] because of the waves and jesus was
[40:59] asleep
[41:01] and they were all upset and they went to
[41:04] him and said don't you care that we're
[41:05] gonna die
[41:08] he says i have not appointed you to
[41:09] wrath
[41:11] amen so that's the scripture for today
[41:14] i have not appointed you to wrath
[41:18] praise the lord amen amen
[41:21] in the flashing red light of his coming
[41:24] brother branham said so we think of my
[41:25] text
[41:26] as a flashing red light of his coming it
[41:29] reminds me
[41:30] of waiting at a railroad station that
[41:32] when a man or people stand around
[41:34] as many of us has when we was waiting to
[41:37] catch the train
[41:38] and we can't hear the train and you
[41:40] don't even see it but you know it's time
[41:43] maybe the dispatcher says it's a little
[41:45] late he's not exactly on time but we
[41:47] don't know just when but he will arrive
[41:49] soon and we'll walk around the station
[41:51] with our hands in our pockets
[41:53] sitting on our suitcases go out and buy
[41:55] a bag of peanuts talk to somebody across
[41:57] the street
[41:58] right i'm going to build my house going
[42:00] to work on my retirement program i'm
[42:02] getting married i'm gonna have kids
[42:04] we're gonna go off to
[42:05] college we're gonna make our vacation
[42:07] everything else he says then all of a
[42:09] sudden something happens
[42:11] there's a noise that takes place out on
[42:13] the track and when we did
[42:16] the arm goes down and the red lights
[42:18] begin to flash
[42:19] and what is that the train is in the
[42:21] blocks and though you can't hear him
[42:23] and though you can't see him but yet the
[42:25] flashing red light and that arm down
[42:27] shows that he's coming in
[42:29] and then if you're expecting to leave on
[42:31] that train
[42:34] you better throw the bag of peanuts down
[42:37] you better stop your talking
[42:38] get up in your suitcase and get ready or
[42:41] you'll be left behind
[42:42] because he's just stopping locally just
[42:44] for a few moments
[42:45] and then he'll be gone and if you stand
[42:47] to chat the neighbor across the street
[42:49] you'll be left behind
[42:51] i have not ordained you or appointed you
[42:54] to wrath
[42:55] but brother bruce do you see what
[42:57] everything that's going on
[42:59] i'm not looking at that amen
[43:03] let's look at second peter 3.
[43:06] so first thessalonians paul wrote that
[43:10] now peter now peter wrote about the day
[43:13] of the lord also yes
[43:15] and peter and and paul they were kind on
[43:17] opposite ends of the spectrum
[43:20] you know peter it was all faith and big
[43:23] and i can do it
[43:25] and paul after god knocked him down
[43:28] he said i said i can't do anything but
[43:30] his strength is sufficient for me
[43:34] amen so at second peter three
[43:38] starting with verse one because i i was
[43:40] gonna i had cut it down but i
[43:42] i like how this is written he says this
[43:44] second epistle beloved i now
[43:46] write unto you
[43:50] it's written to you
[43:54] in both which i stir up your pure minds
[43:56] by way of rememberings
[43:58] see he's taken the same avenue
[44:02] that paul said i shouldn't have to write
[44:04] to you about the seasons and the times
[44:06] because you should be aware of these
[44:08] things but then again you need to be
[44:11] remembered
[44:12] or reminded that you may be mindful of
[44:15] the words which were spoken before
[44:18] by the holy prophets and of the
[44:20] commandment of us
[44:22] the apostles of the lord and savior so
[44:25] he tells
[44:26] the believer what you should be focused
[44:30] on the wall street journal
[44:33] is not the word of god
[44:37] i don't care what's on youtube i don't
[44:39] care
[44:40] i don't care fox business don't care
[44:42] don't care
[44:44] because i'm looking at the word of god
[44:49] look at what he says so he's talking
[44:51] about
[44:52] the day of the lord knowing this first
[44:55] that there will come in the last days
[44:58] scoffers walking after their own lusts
[45:01] and saying where is the promise of his
[45:03] coming
[45:04] for since the fathers fell asleep all
[45:07] things continue
[45:08] as they were from the beginning of the
[45:09] creation everything is still the same
[45:13] you're still telling me that i need to
[45:15] get saved you're still telling me i need
[45:17] to do this i need to do that
[45:18] he says but where's the promise and yet
[45:21] all around us is signs
[45:23] all around us the red lights are
[45:24] flashing and we're still eating peanuts
[45:29] sitting on our suitcases wondering what
[45:31] is going on who's
[45:33] i got some quotes amen
[45:37] amen he says
[45:41] where is the promise of his coming for
[45:43] since the fathers fell asleep
[45:45] all things continue as they were from
[45:47] the beginning of the creation
[45:49] for this they willingly are ignorant of
[45:52] that by the word of god the heavens were
[45:54] of old
[45:54] and the earth standing out of the water
[45:56] and in the water
[45:58] whereby the world that then was was
[46:00] overflowed with water
[46:02] perished i want you to notice
[46:05] that peter as he's talking starts to
[46:08] tell
[46:08] the believer as it was in the days of
[46:12] noah
[46:16] he says there they were and he says and
[46:19] they
[46:20] they were they were infidels
[46:25] because they were willingly ignorant
[46:28] yes sir that's it they willingly did not
[46:31] hold god in high esteem
[46:36] they did not believe that god created
[46:38] the earth
[46:40] they did not believe he created the
[46:42] heavens
[46:43] and even though the water was in you
[46:45] know because
[46:46] the dry land appeared that's what book
[46:48] of genesis says
[46:50] but it never rained so they were in the
[46:52] water out of the water
[46:54] but they didn't believe that there was a
[46:56] god they didn't believe there was a
[46:57] purpose of god
[46:58] they didn't they they refused to
[47:01] acknowledge him in their
[47:02] in their mind
[47:06] and he says whereby the world that then
[47:09] was
[47:10] was overflowed with water perished
[47:14] that's the flood
[47:18] amen but the heavens and the earth which
[47:21] are now
[47:22] by the same word are kept in store so he
[47:26] warns the believers he said all right
[47:28] now pay attention
[47:31] don't just fall asleep
[47:36] that the same word arc the same word
[47:40] are kept in store reserved unto fire
[47:43] against the day of judgment
[47:44] and their perdition of ungodly men
[47:50] peter telling the church god is going to
[47:54] keep his word
[47:56] if he destroyed the world by a flood
[47:59] he's going to dis he's already reserved
[48:02] it
[48:03] for fire
[48:06] but he can't send the fire if there's
[48:09] everybody is godly
[48:13] another red flashing light
[48:19] but beloved be not ignorant of this one
[48:22] thing
[48:22] that one day as with the lord is a
[48:24] thousand years and a thousand years
[48:26] is one day and the lord is not slack
[48:28] concerning his promise
[48:30] as some men count slackness but is long
[48:32] long-suffering to
[48:34] us word not willing that any should
[48:36] perish
[48:37] but that all should come to repentance
[48:40] because i have
[48:41] already said i have appointed you
[48:44] not to wrath
[48:48] whether you're a young believer whether
[48:50] you only been a christian for a couple
[48:52] of days
[48:52] maybe you haven't even gotten the holy
[48:54] ghost yet don't be afraid of everything
[48:57] that's going on
[48:58] but know that god is suffering
[49:02] and he'll hold everything back until you
[49:04] get to the place
[49:06] where he wants you to be at
[49:09] the wrath is not going to fall until
[49:11] everybody is in their right place
[49:14] believe me he will not let his word fall
[49:18] to the ground
[49:22] but the day of the lord will come as a
[49:25] thief in the night
[49:27] in which the heavens shall pass away
[49:28] with a great noise and the elements
[49:30] shall melt with fervent heat
[49:32] and the earth also and the works that
[49:33] are therein shall be burned up
[49:36] and seeing that all these things shall
[49:38] be dissolved
[49:39] what manner of persons ought we to be
[49:43] in all holy conversation and godliness
[49:48] and conversation means the manner of
[49:51] life
[49:51] that you live
[49:55] not what you talk but what is your
[49:57] conduct
[49:59] knowing that we are in a dark world
[50:03] we are in a time when god is getting
[50:06] ready to come back what manner of people
[50:10] ought we to be amen
[50:13] amen amen
[50:20] looking for and hastening unto the
[50:22] coming of the day of god wherein the
[50:24] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[50:27] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[50:29] heat
[50:30] nevertheless we according to his promise
[50:34] we look for a new heaven and a new earth
[50:37] wherein dwelleth righteousness wherefore
[50:40] beloved
[50:41] seeing that you look for such things be
[50:44] diligent that you may be found of him
[50:47] in peace without spot and blameless
[50:52] and diligent means labor to study
[50:56] to hasten to exert oneself
[50:59] to endeavor amen
[51:03] that's what we oh it's a scary time
[51:07] it's okay it's all right
[51:11] it's all right it's i know it's scary i
[51:13] know
[51:14] it was scary when brother john came
[51:16] sister cheryl came
[51:18] it was scary it was scary for me and
[51:20] donna it was scary when we came
[51:23] in do i have enough time to have
[51:25] children
[51:26] you know how many people in this message
[51:28] young men growed up
[51:30] graduated out of high school no thought
[51:33] of going to college because the day of
[51:35] the lord is coming as a thief in the
[51:36] night i got to get married
[51:39] some young girl she's forgotten about
[51:41] everything she's got to get married
[51:42] and they get married and then a year
[51:44] later they're shipwrecked
[51:52] yes keep your eye
[51:56] on the goal friends let's look at luke
[51:59] 11.
[52:02] now i found a couple of different
[52:03] scriptures where
[52:06] where jesus spoke about discerning the
[52:09] signs
[52:10] of the time
[52:17] but luke 11 verse 29
[52:20] it says so when the people were gathered
[52:22] thick together he began to say
[52:24] this is an evil generation they seek a
[52:27] sign
[52:28] and there should be no sign given to it
[52:30] but the sign of jonas the
[52:32] prophet now he's not exactly
[52:35] addressing the pharisees and the
[52:36] sadducees where he does in other places
[52:39] but he tells them there are an evil
[52:41] generation and they seek
[52:43] a sign and he says for as jonas was a
[52:46] sign
[52:47] unto the ninevites so shall also the son
[52:50] of man
[52:51] be to this generation and the sign
[52:55] in this generation is you
[53:02] because you are the children of the
[53:04] light
[53:07] and jesus has already come in the flesh
[53:11] first john says if they deny that he's
[53:14] come in the flesh then they are not of
[53:16] him
[53:19] the only way jesus is coming right now
[53:23] is you
[53:28] jonas was a sign unto the ninevites
[53:31] and so shall also the son of man be to
[53:34] this
[53:34] generation the queen of the south shall
[53:37] rise up in the judgment
[53:39] with the men of this generation and
[53:41] condemn them
[53:42] for she came from the utmost parts of
[53:44] the earth to hear the wisdom of solomon
[53:46] and behold a greater than solomon is
[53:49] here
[53:50] and the men of nineveh shall rise up in
[53:52] the judgment with this generation and
[53:54] shall condemn it
[53:55] for they repented at the preaching for
[53:58] they repented at the preaching of jonas
[54:00] and behold a greater than jonas is here
[54:03] amen brother branham and queen of sheba
[54:07] says so now this little queen
[54:09] had some smart ideas and i'd like you to
[54:11] notice
[54:12] she said now i have never seen this
[54:15] i don't know anything about it
[54:20] we're living in that hour
[54:24] i have no idea what they're going to do
[54:26] tomorrow
[54:27] some of the things they've done today i
[54:28] went what are you kidding me
[54:33] so this is what brother branham said the
[54:34] queen of sheba did
[54:36] and if brother branham said it was good
[54:37] enough for the queen of sheba it's good
[54:38] enough for me
[54:40] then you have to make up your own mind
[54:42] the little queen had some smart ideas
[54:44] and i'd like you to notice she said no i
[54:47] never seen this
[54:48] i don't know nothing about it so i
[54:50] imagine the first thing the little queen
[54:51] did
[54:52] was purchase her a bible
[54:55] so she could read and find out
[55:00] she said now if it's some kind of a put
[55:02] up it won't be according to the bible
[55:05] their bible but if their bible has
[55:07] predicted such a
[55:09] thing then it will be right
[55:16] now that's what christians ought to do
[55:20] when you come to a meeting don't condemn
[55:23] just search out the scriptures what if
[55:26] they'd have been what if they'd have
[55:27] been that sincere with jesus
[55:30] he said searching out the scriptures for
[55:32] they are they that testify in me
[55:34] and in them you think you have eternal
[55:35] life and you think you have eternal life
[55:38] and that's what testifies of me
[55:41] amen so that's the first thing
[55:46] i don't understand where people have
[55:48] gone wrong really
[55:51] when i got saved and i started serving
[55:54] the lord
[55:55] that was the first thing where do i live
[55:59] i better go look we see what the bible
[56:00] says where i should live
[56:02] maybe i'll ask god what kind of car
[56:04] should i buy maybe i'll ask god and see
[56:06] what's in the bible about it
[56:08] maybe when i go over here i'll see what
[56:10] kind of a wi-fi well god already picked
[56:12] out my wife
[56:13] so he did he picked out my wife so
[56:16] i'm okay with that i i like what he
[56:19] picked out
[56:20] but see
[56:23] that's what we should do but we don't
[56:29] we don't what church to go to where
[56:32] place
[56:32] who to support who not to support who to
[56:35] hear on the tv
[56:36] who not to hear on the tv who to listen
[56:38] to on youtube
[56:39] who not to listen to on youtube who to
[56:41] do all these things
[56:42] what does the bible say are those people
[56:45] telling the word of god
[56:46] or are they taking something and only
[56:48] telling you part of the word of the god
[56:50] when's the last time you heard about the
[56:52] day of the lord shall come as a thief in
[56:54] the night
[56:55] [Applause]
[56:56] right
[56:58] it's in the book in the identified
[57:01] christ of ages
[57:03] brother branham said so now we know when
[57:05] you see a sign
[57:07] a true bible sign
[57:10] and there is a true bible voice
[57:13] behind it if there's no voice that
[57:16] follows the sign
[57:20] if there's no voice that follows the
[57:23] biblical
[57:24] sign just some old theological voice
[57:28] forget it it never came from god
[57:35] oh it sounds like a good idea let's do
[57:36] this well what did god say about it
[57:40] well you know we are the bride we are
[57:41] the elect what did the bible say about
[57:43] it
[57:44] you know what we're doing no i don't
[57:46] know what you're doing
[57:49] i don't know what you're doing well i'm
[57:52] following so-and-so
[57:53] i'm following this guy
[57:56] i mean you know i had brother mark he
[58:00] come out to my house and we sit we were
[58:01] standing in the kitchen we were talking
[58:03] and he said do you know brother
[58:04] so-and-so and i said
[58:05] oh yeah i know him i said i actually met
[58:07] him and he was telling me he said oh
[58:09] yeah
[58:10] they got a a letter that brother brandon
[58:12] wrote and this guy's supposed to be a
[58:13] big guy and everything else he said what
[58:15] do you think about that i said well
[58:16] i can tell you what the bible says i can
[58:19] tell you what the prophet said
[58:21] say what's on the tapes so if whatever
[58:24] you found
[58:25] don't line up with the tapes praise the
[58:27] lord
[58:28] god bless you but i'm sticking with the
[58:31] tapes
[58:32] i'm sticking with the bible amen
[58:37] he says if it's the same old theological
[58:39] voice forget it it never came from god
[58:41] there is always god told moses
[58:45] if they won't believe the first sign
[58:46] they'll believe the voice of the second
[58:48] sign
[58:50] now let's go here in case you're new and
[58:52] you don't know about this
[58:53] exodus 4 amen
[58:58] moses is at the burning bush he's
[59:01] telling god
[59:02] all the reasons why he can't be the
[59:04] messenger of the hour
[59:07] i can't be the guy i can't talk i can do
[59:10] all this other stuff
[59:11] and god does just see moses is a great
[59:15] example because that's what you always
[59:16] are telling god you get up in the
[59:17] morning say lord i can't take this test
[59:19] i can't take this test i can't do this
[59:21] anymore i can't i can't
[59:23] god's not even listening to you he's
[59:25] going i've already appointed you not to
[59:27] wrath so i'm not going to destroy you
[59:29] i pro appointed you to do this and this
[59:31] and this and
[59:33] [Music]
[59:34] because of foreign knowledge and a bunch
[59:36] of other things i can make
[59:38] everything work out for my glory amen
[59:43] so exodus four we'll just skip
[59:47] um verse one we're gonna
[59:52] let's go and start with verse six and
[59:54] the lord said furthermore unto him put
[59:56] now thy hand under thy bosom and he put
[59:58] his hand in his bosom and when he took
[59:59] it out behold his hand was leprous of
[1:00:01] snow
[1:00:02] and he said put thy hand now in thy
[1:00:04] bosom again and he put his hand in his
[1:00:06] bosom again
[1:00:06] plucked it out of his bosom and behold
[1:00:08] it was turned again as other flesh
[1:00:12] and this is god speaking he says and it
[1:00:14] shall come to pass
[1:00:15] if they will not believe believe thee
[1:00:19] nor hearken to the voice of the first
[1:00:22] sign that they will believe the voice
[1:00:26] of the latter sign and if it and if
[1:00:30] and it shall come to pass if they will
[1:00:32] not believe also
[1:00:34] these two signs neither hearken
[1:00:37] unto the voice
[1:00:40] then thou shalt take of the water of the
[1:00:42] river and pour it upon the dry land and
[1:00:44] the water shall be taken
[1:00:46] out of the river shall become blood upon
[1:00:48] the dry land
[1:00:50] that's it it's dawn
[1:00:54] if you can't figure out to stay with the
[1:00:57] scriptures
[1:00:58] in a scriptural voice
[1:01:03] god will give you so many opportunities
[1:01:05] but then one day
[1:01:07] he that is righteous remain righteous he
[1:01:09] that's ungodly will remain ungodly
[1:01:11] god is going to shut the door
[1:01:14] he is going to shut the door
[1:01:17] there has to be a voice with the sign
[1:01:20] absolutely
[1:01:21] and if it's the same old theological
[1:01:23] voice forget it
[1:01:25] you already had that it's something god
[1:01:27] is trying to attract the attention of
[1:01:29] the people
[1:01:30] by a sign and then give them the voice
[1:01:33] that's behind the sign
[1:01:34] and it must be a scriptural voice moses
[1:01:37] wouldn't have believed it
[1:01:39] and neither would paul but it has to be
[1:01:42] a scriptural voice
[1:01:45] so let's go to matthew 16 amen
[1:01:49] praise god praise the lord
[1:01:56] brother sister i know i know people are
[1:01:58] unsettled i
[1:02:00] know they got questions but the god
[1:02:03] we have the answer to the question
[1:02:08] we have it matthew 16
[1:02:12] verse 1 so the pharisees also with the
[1:02:15] sadducees came and tempting
[1:02:17] desired him that he would show them a
[1:02:19] sign from heaven
[1:02:20] and he answered and said when it is
[1:02:23] evening you say it will be fair weather
[1:02:24] for the sky is red
[1:02:26] and in the morning it will be foul
[1:02:28] whether today for the sky is red and lol
[1:02:30] ring
[1:02:31] oh you hypocrites you can discern the
[1:02:33] face of the sky
[1:02:34] but can you not discern the signs of the
[1:02:37] times
[1:02:38] a wicked and adulterous generation
[1:02:41] seeketh after a sign
[1:02:43] and there shall no sign be given unto it
[1:02:46] but the sign of the prophet jonas
[1:02:48] and he left them and departed
[1:02:52] we need to be able to discern
[1:02:55] the signs of the times of the hour that
[1:02:59] we're living in
[1:03:02] brother branham said it like this he
[1:03:03] said you know he says here was
[1:03:05] here was the children of israel and he
[1:03:07] says they were down in egypt and they'd
[1:03:09] been down in egypt for 400 years and god
[1:03:11] sent them moses
[1:03:12] and moses came and said i have come from
[1:03:15] god and i'm here to deliver you
[1:03:17] and the first thing they said was and
[1:03:19] what sign do you bring to us
[1:03:21] and what god is it and what is his name
[1:03:25] and he showed them the sign and they got
[1:03:27] all excited
[1:03:29] right and they said oh this is good
[1:03:32] we're getting out of here
[1:03:33] i may not even have to show up for work
[1:03:35] tomorrow
[1:03:37] but if we had time which we don't we'll
[1:03:40] find out that the very next day
[1:03:42] when moses went before pharaoh and said
[1:03:44] let my people go
[1:03:45] pharaoh said if you've got time to have
[1:03:47] six churches nights
[1:03:48] there's seven days in the week and i got
[1:03:50] you for five
[1:03:52] well in fact i got you for all seven but
[1:03:54] i got you for five and you want two days
[1:03:56] off to worship the lord
[1:03:57] you got time to worship the lord you do
[1:04:00] you got time to pray
[1:04:02] you do we go get your own stubble
[1:04:06] and when moses went back and told him he
[1:04:08] said let my people go
[1:04:10] he said you again
[1:04:13] well obviously i didn't make it hard
[1:04:15] enough because you're still hanging
[1:04:16] around
[1:04:18] right but the children of
[1:04:21] israel they started to murmur and
[1:04:24] complain
[1:04:25] because they could not discern the sign
[1:04:30] of the time
[1:04:34] it didn't make sense to them
[1:04:37] if god's going to take us out of here
[1:04:40] why would he make it harder
[1:04:45] well if you read your bible you'll never
[1:04:48] find a place where it doesn't work like
[1:04:52] that when they came up
[1:04:54] out of egypt and egypt was driving them
[1:04:57] out like brother john said on sunday
[1:04:59] and he said and here they come up they
[1:05:01] got right to the red sea
[1:05:03] and the bible says always like this when
[1:05:05] the lord first showed me this
[1:05:07] he knew exactly where to put them
[1:05:10] there was a city to the north there was
[1:05:12] a city to the south there was no place
[1:05:14] to go
[1:05:15] and they could see the dust of the
[1:05:16] egyptians coming
[1:05:20] put them in a really hard place
[1:05:23] now because they didn't understand the
[1:05:25] sign they said you know what
[1:05:27] i read my bible i'm looking in here god
[1:05:30] delivered noah with an
[1:05:32] ark let's build an ark
[1:05:36] have you ever read that have you ever
[1:05:38] heard brother branham say it on a tape
[1:05:41] this oh let's build an ark and god will
[1:05:43] float us
[1:05:44] no because you don't understand you
[1:05:48] can't discern the hour that you're
[1:05:50] living in
[1:05:52] you're misapplying the word of god to a
[1:05:54] different place
[1:05:56] he already built the ark he's not
[1:05:58] building it again
[1:06:03] and if i could be so bold that's thus
[1:06:05] saith the lord
[1:06:14] my in the queen of sheba brother branham
[1:06:17] said so he told the pharisees those
[1:06:19] great clergymen of that day he says now
[1:06:21] you can look at the sun
[1:06:22] and it's lowering and you say tomorrow
[1:06:23] it's going to be foul weather
[1:06:25] and if it's clear whether it will be
[1:06:27] fair weather you hypocrites you're
[1:06:29] supposed to be clergymen
[1:06:30] and you can discern the things of the
[1:06:32] world better than you can discern the
[1:06:34] signs
[1:06:34] of the times he said you know he said
[1:06:38] that andaluvian world was so
[1:06:40] far advanced from us amen
[1:06:43] and when they were so far advanced he
[1:06:46] says
[1:06:47] when noah noah heard
[1:06:50] god's voice
[1:06:54] and when it was when it became
[1:06:57] part of his life he was not
[1:07:01] slothful remember what we read in the
[1:07:04] opening scriptures
[1:07:05] when it became part of his life he was
[1:07:09] driven to fulfill the word of god and he
[1:07:12] became
[1:07:13] christ in that dark hour
[1:07:16] he built an ark the ark just started to
[1:07:19] appear
[1:07:21] and god was long suffering for 120 years
[1:07:25] waiting for somebody to say yes lord
[1:07:28] amen
[1:07:32] it's not russell crowe give me a break
[1:07:39] you know they made a russell crowman
[1:07:40] made a noah movie and a
[1:07:42] assembly of god brother come to me at
[1:07:45] work he said hey bruce he says have you
[1:07:46] seen this russell
[1:07:47] i said you know i'm not really big on
[1:07:50] hollywood trying to interpret the bible
[1:07:51] because they don't know how to interpret
[1:07:53] the bible

[1:08:04] be
[1:08:04] interested all right listen everybody's
[1:08:07] interested who be the president well i

[1:08:20] to know about my nation

[1:08:41] some tweet or whatever is on your
[1:08:43] twitter feed or whatsoever on
[1:08:45] youtube or whatsoever on the facebook or
[1:08:47] whatever why is that the first thing you
[1:08:49] look at
[1:08:50] and you don't open up your bible and say
[1:08:51] oh let's see what's going on here
[1:08:57] everything that you do should be
[1:08:59] measured
[1:09:00] by the word of god
[1:09:04] everything
[1:09:08] amen but the thing it is they take the
[1:09:11] nation they take the things of the world

[1:09:29] crockett or gunsmoke or some of them
[1:09:31] they can tell then they can tell you
[1:09:32] about jesus christ because that's what

[1:10:00] how to discern the sign of the times
[1:10:06] like i say
[1:10:08] [Applause]
[1:10:11] people don't want to hear that scares
[1:10:13] them
[1:10:14] i scared something i don't want to know
[1:10:16] this is the end of the world
[1:10:18] how will i ever get married well if god
[1:10:21] wants you to get married
[1:10:22] he'll hold off the wrath until the wife
[1:10:24] comes
[1:10:26] well i mean i i can tell you
[1:10:29] donna and i we were young jesus won't we
[1:10:32] ever have any children i said i don't
[1:10:34] know
[1:10:34] but let's get ready for him he's coming
[1:10:39] now the children are 40 and 41.
[1:10:43] brother johnny i know you had those
[1:10:45] conversations
[1:10:46] we all thought we all thought
[1:10:50] long before patricia came along
[1:10:53] i remember when patricia got dedicated
[1:10:59] brother and sister what are you doing
[1:11:04] what are you doing
[1:11:07] matthew 24 so
[1:11:11] what a what is our main number one
[1:11:13] concern what should be our
[1:11:15] focus in this hour the day of the lord
[1:11:19] and it's coming as a thief in the night
[1:11:22] amen and how can we get ready
[1:11:27] okay so that's a bible question there's
[1:11:29] a bible question
[1:11:31] then there's a bible answer it's not an
[1:11:34] unsaid
[1:11:35] evening post the national enquirer don't
[1:11:37] have it
[1:11:38] brother so-and-so don't have it your
[1:11:40] girlfriend don't have it your knitting
[1:11:42] circle don't have it they don't have it
[1:11:47] i'm gonna get yelled at for that comment
[1:11:51] matthew 24 verse one and jesus went out
[1:11:54] and departed from the temples and his
[1:11:56] disciples came to him
[1:11:57] for to show him the buildings of the
[1:11:59] temple and jesus said unto them
[1:12:01] see you not all these things
[1:12:04] verily i say unto you there shall not be
[1:12:06] left here one stone upon another
[1:12:09] that shall not be thrown down and as he
[1:12:12] sat down
[1:12:13] upon the mount of olives so brother adam
[1:12:15] said he says the mount of olives is
[1:12:16] right across from temple mount
[1:12:19] and they they cross over across the
[1:12:21] valley maybe they had some
[1:12:22] you know they got some water and some
[1:12:24] bread and they sat down and they all sat
[1:12:26] down and they were sitting there
[1:12:28] and as he said on the mount of olives
[1:12:30] the disciples came unto him privately
[1:12:31] saying
[1:12:32] tell us when shall these things be
[1:12:36] and what shall be the sign of thy coming
[1:12:39] and of the end of the world very plain
[1:12:44] very direct to the point
[1:12:47] why is it written in the scriptures
[1:12:49] because he knows it's a question you
[1:12:51] have
[1:12:57] he knows it's a question you have
[1:13:01] so he's going to put the answer in the
[1:13:02] book so that you don't have to be
[1:13:04] nervous
[1:13:05] and you don't have to be worried and you
[1:13:07] can trust in the god of heaven
[1:13:12] now in his unfailing words of promise
[1:13:14] that's what brother adam called us
[1:13:16] they ask him three questions and he
[1:13:18] answers them as they ask him
[1:13:21] three questions see first when will
[1:13:24] there be one not one stone left upon
[1:13:26] another that's question number one what
[1:13:29] will be the sign of your coming
[1:13:30] and that's the one we're worried about
[1:13:32] and what is the end of the world
[1:13:33] because we know that'll be fire right
[1:13:35] three questions
[1:13:36] any answers three questions and great
[1:13:40] bible students today
[1:13:42] they placed the first question when he
[1:13:44] said pray that your flight be
[1:13:46] not in the winter time nor on the
[1:13:47] sabbath day they placed that in a future
[1:13:49] date
[1:13:50] of the coming of the lord at the end of
[1:13:52] the world
[1:13:54] so they took the scriptures and put them
[1:13:57] in the wrong place just like the
[1:14:00] children of israel
[1:14:02] saying let's build an ark
[1:14:10] that took place in a.d 70 when the great
[1:14:13] roman
[1:14:14] soldier a great army titus and his group
[1:14:16] come up there the great journal of rome
[1:14:17] beseeched the walls as jesus had
[1:14:19] foretold them
[1:14:21] he says and when you see jerusalem
[1:14:22] compassed about with armies then let him
[1:14:24] which is in the field don't come back
[1:14:26] into the city again
[1:14:27] now what good will it do some people try
[1:14:30] to support their doctrine
[1:14:32] that well people will still be living in
[1:14:34] the sabbath hours keeping the sabbath
[1:14:36] day when he comes
[1:14:37] well if his coming is universal you
[1:14:40] can't be keeping the sabbath for one
[1:14:42] side it's the sabbath day and on the
[1:14:44] other side of the world
[1:14:45] it's a day past the sabbath day see so
[1:14:47] that isn't it
[1:14:48] the sabbath keeping was for a people in
[1:14:51] the wilderness
[1:14:52] not for the universal church see and all
[1:14:55] these different things and they take the
[1:14:57] scriptures without
[1:14:58] having the holy spirit to divide them
[1:15:00] rightly and
[1:15:01] show what they are so if your first
[1:15:04] question is
[1:15:04] i'm not sure i'm born again you need to
[1:15:06] answer that question
[1:15:08] because without the holy ghost you
[1:15:10] cannot rightly divide the word of truth
[1:15:16] but here is what jesus was speaking to
[1:15:18] my most humble opinion
[1:15:21] was that he said that this generation
[1:15:24] in other words the generation that saw
[1:15:26] the fig tree
[1:15:27] putting forth his buds now i want you to
[1:15:30] notice
[1:15:30] as brother branham's talking about these
[1:15:32] he goes
[1:15:34] just look at your bible verse 4
[1:15:39] he skips all of
[1:15:42] from 4 all the way down to verse 32.
[1:15:48] he skips it all
[1:15:52] and i know all the messages that came
[1:15:54] out of those first 31 verses is just
[1:15:56] great stuff in there
[1:16:00] he said the generation that saw the fig
[1:16:02] tree putting forth his bud see he said
[1:16:04] here
[1:16:04] and when the fig tree is beginning is
[1:16:07] tender and putteth forth its buds its
[1:16:09] branches
[1:16:10] you say summer is nigh likewise see when
[1:16:12] you see
[1:16:13] all of these things know the time
[1:16:17] and when you see all these three
[1:16:20] questions fulfilled
[1:16:22] amen the time is at the door
[1:16:27] and that generation that sees the fig
[1:16:29] tree and the fig tree is
[1:16:31] always israel and when israel goes back
[1:16:35] to her homeland and becomes a nation
[1:16:37] that generation will not pass away until
[1:16:40] these things are
[1:16:41] all fulfilled that's what he
[1:16:44] said and he will keep his word
[1:16:49] that's what he said
[1:16:52] so we'll start at verse 32 because
[1:16:55] i thought it was he says so now learn a
[1:16:57] parable of the fig tree
[1:16:59] when his branch is yet tender and
[1:17:00] putteth forth leaves you know that
[1:17:02] summer is nigh
[1:17:04] right nigh but there's no fruit on it
[1:17:09] the one time i preached about the fig
[1:17:11] tree
[1:17:13] jesus was just going up to jerusalem to
[1:17:16] to present himself
[1:17:19] as the king of kings before palm sunday
[1:17:23] he was on his way up there and he passed
[1:17:27] a fig tree and when he looked up in it
[1:17:33] there was no fruit
[1:17:40] he said they're cursed you're cursed
[1:17:44] and then he went in and they rejected
[1:17:46] him
[1:17:47] and when he came back out the disciples
[1:17:49] said hey
[1:17:51] that tree that you cursed withered up
[1:17:53] and died and it had
[1:17:59] when you see the fig tree coming back
[1:18:01] when you see
[1:18:02] israel in the homeland it's that's just
[1:18:05] the summer
[1:18:06] but where's the fruit
[1:18:12] heaven and earth look at what he says in
[1:18:14] verse 35 see he says when you see that
[1:18:16] fig tree
[1:18:18] that generation will not pass away till
[1:18:20] all these things be fulfilled heaven and
[1:18:22] earth shall pass away but my word
[1:18:24] shall not pass away
[1:18:30] so everything that i do
[1:18:34] make the pledge make the consecration
[1:18:37] from here forward every decision
[1:18:42] everything that i do will be based
[1:18:45] on the word of god and god will bless it
[1:18:50] and it won't fail it won't dry up and
[1:18:54] wither away
[1:18:55] you won't be unsuccessful you put
[1:18:58] god first god will take care of his
[1:19:02] own amen
[1:19:06] and look look at how it this follows
[1:19:08] just exactly what peter and paul wrote
[1:19:11] to the church
[1:19:12] but of that day and that hour knoweth no
[1:19:16] man
[1:19:17] no not the angels of heaven but my
[1:19:20] father only
[1:19:23] why because he's coming as a thief
[1:19:28] in the night we read that
[1:19:31] so right away he goes but as the days of
[1:19:34] noah were
[1:19:35] so shall also the coming of the son of
[1:19:37] man be for in the days that were before
[1:19:39] the flood they were eating and drinking
[1:19:41] marrying and giving in marriage until
[1:19:42] the day that noah entered into the ark
[1:19:46] and they knew not until the flood came
[1:19:48] and took them all away
[1:19:49] so shall also the coming of the son of
[1:19:52] man
[1:19:52] be so let's go to genesis 6
[1:20:02] amen
[1:20:08] genesis 6 verse 1 so jesus
[1:20:11] telling his disciples he says
[1:20:14] you want to know when the end of the
[1:20:16] world is going to be you want to know
[1:20:18] when i'm coming back so the first thing
[1:20:21] to look for
[1:20:22] is the fig tree when you see the fig
[1:20:26] tree
[1:20:27] you will know summer is nigh
[1:20:31] make sure that you
[1:20:34] are connected with me make sure that
[1:20:38] you're sober
[1:20:39] make sure you're not asleep at the wheel
[1:20:42] make sure that you're diligent
[1:20:44] make sure make very
[1:20:47] sure because
[1:20:52] here's another sign as it was in the
[1:20:55] days of noah
[1:20:58] and it came to pass when men began to
[1:21:00] multiply in the face of the earth and
[1:21:02] daughters were born unto them
[1:21:04] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[1:21:06] of men that they were
[1:21:07] fair and they took them wives of all
[1:21:10] that they chose
[1:21:15] a time of beauty
[1:21:18] and when when the world was multiplying
[1:21:26] now
[1:21:28] what happened to my note
[1:21:38] where is it
[1:21:44] oh okay gotta stay in the right place
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:49] so how long ago was the days of noah
[1:21:53] right we know it's almost four thousand
[1:21:55] years because two thousand years from
[1:21:57] the flood to jesus christ now it's two
[1:22:00] thousand years after
[1:22:01] right so we know it was about four
[1:22:03] thousand years ago
[1:22:04] well we're not going to go back that
[1:22:05] long ago because the pew charitable
[1:22:07] trust
[1:22:08] and and a whole bunch of other these
[1:22:10] statisticians didn't exist
[1:22:12] but we can go back to the eighteen
[1:22:13] hundreds
[1:22:15] after eighteen hundred this changed
[1:22:18] fundamentally
[1:22:19] the world population was around a
[1:22:21] billion people in the year eighteen
[1:22:22] hundred
[1:22:23] and increased seven fold since then
[1:22:29] since the 1800s
[1:22:34] and when it came to pass when men began
[1:22:36] to multiply in the face of the earth
[1:22:40] well it's multiplying there is around
[1:22:43] 108 billion people have ever lived on
[1:22:45] our planet this means that today's
[1:22:47] population
[1:22:49] the rise makes it about six and a half
[1:22:50] percent of the total
[1:22:52] number of people ever alive
[1:22:56] are on the earth now
[1:22:59] so they're multiplying
[1:23:03] it's a sign it's a sign
[1:23:10] amen
[1:23:13] and in verse 3 it says and the lord said
[1:23:15] we're still in genesis 6 he says and the
[1:23:17] lord said my spirit shall not always
[1:23:19] strive
[1:23:20] with man for that he is also his flesh
[1:23:23] yet his day shall be a hundred and
[1:23:24] twenty years
[1:23:26] and there were giants in the earth in
[1:23:28] those days and also after that when the
[1:23:30] sons of god
[1:23:31] came in unto the daughters of men and
[1:23:33] they bear children to them
[1:23:34] the same became mighty men which were of
[1:23:37] old
[1:23:38] men of renown and god saw that the
[1:23:41] wickedness of man was
[1:23:43] great on the earth
[1:23:46] when when man began to multiply
[1:23:50] like the grasshoppers when he started to
[1:23:54] multiply
[1:23:55] everywhere brother branham said it like
[1:23:57] this he says you can go out
[1:23:59] in the country and it's really beautiful
[1:24:01] and it's peaceful and you can live out
[1:24:02] there
[1:24:03] like a brother john's you can i don't
[1:24:04] know how many acres you got but i know
[1:24:05] it's a lot but
[1:24:06] brother john can walk out in the back
[1:24:09] field and it's quiet
[1:24:10] but if brother john walks too far out in
[1:24:12] his back field he runs right into an
[1:24:14] expressway
[1:24:15] isn't there an expressway behind you and
[1:24:17] there's noise
[1:24:19] and there's houses and whenever there's
[1:24:21] a lot of houses
[1:24:22] and a lot of noise there's a lot of
[1:24:24] stress and there's a lot of things that
[1:24:27] shouldn't be happening
[1:24:28] are happening when man begins to
[1:24:30] multiply on the face of the earth
[1:24:32] sin multiplies on the face of the earth
[1:24:35] it's a
[1:24:35] sign and that every imagination of the
[1:24:38] thoughts of his heart
[1:24:40] was only evil continually we
[1:24:43] know that it is illegal to commit murder
[1:24:47] but i can spend a little bit of money
[1:24:50] and get a playstation 5
[1:24:52] and then i can get the set of goggles
[1:24:54] and i can go in 3d mode and then i can
[1:24:57] get me a glove
[1:24:58] in every imagination that i got if i
[1:25:01] want to rip the guy's heart out
[1:25:03] that's so cool i can shoot them
[1:25:07] i can get on i can get i can get people
[1:25:10] from all over the world that i don't
[1:25:11] even know who they are we can all go in
[1:25:13] and take a city
[1:25:17] they weren't doing that when i was in
[1:25:19] school in the 60s
[1:25:21] they weren't doing that in the 70s
[1:25:24] it's a sign of noah's day
[1:25:30] the scriptures are being fulfilled right
[1:25:33] before your eyes
[1:25:35] i don't see him yet i know but there's a
[1:25:37] flashing red light you when you see the
[1:25:40] light
[1:25:41] don't go i'm scared
[1:25:44] go read the book right
[1:25:49] go get the book and find out what the
[1:25:50] light what does that light mean
[1:25:52] are we out of fuel what is going on are
[1:25:55] we going to crash
[1:25:56] what is happening hey we're in the days
[1:25:58] of noah
[1:25:59] praise the lord i know where i'm at
[1:26:04] and his thoughts towards me are thoughts
[1:26:06] of peace
[1:26:08] his thoughts towards me is not thoughts
[1:26:09] of wrath
[1:26:11] praise god amen
[1:26:14] and he saw that every imagination of the
[1:26:16] thoughts of his heart was only evil
[1:26:17] continually
[1:26:19] and it repented the lord that he had
[1:26:21] made man on earth and it grieved him
[1:26:23] at his heart how wicked does it have to
[1:26:26] be
[1:26:28] before god is grieved in his
[1:26:32] heart that he created us
[1:26:37] we're not there yet
[1:26:44] now the light's coming on but we're not
[1:26:46] there yet
[1:26:50] and god because there was no one greater
[1:26:53] that's what hebrews said
[1:26:56] he said there is nobody greater than me
[1:26:58] he says i will destroy man
[1:27:00] which i have created from the face of
[1:27:02] the earth
[1:27:03] both man and beast and the creeping
[1:27:06] thing and the falls of the air
[1:27:08] for it repenteth me that i have made
[1:27:10] them
[1:27:11] but god is not slack concerning his
[1:27:14] problem
[1:27:15] promises because as one day is as a
[1:27:18] thousand years of the lord
[1:27:20] so is a thousand years as one day
[1:27:23] he does not want anyone to be lost
[1:27:27] even though this world is going insane
[1:27:30] but we don't care because it's a
[1:27:31] flashing light it's scriptures being
[1:27:34] fulfilled
[1:27:36] and we should be rejoicing in that
[1:27:39] amen amen
[1:27:44] so look at what he says in verse i love
[1:27:47] verse 8 i've always loved verse 8
[1:27:48] it says but noah found grace in the eyes
[1:27:52] of the lord
[1:27:55] god looked down at poor old noah
[1:27:58] and he said because noah will ch will
[1:28:01] raise his children right
[1:28:03] because noah will try to do the right
[1:28:04] thing every time given the opportunity
[1:28:06] because noah has a pure heart because
[1:28:09] noah
[1:28:10] no i love you that's what grace is
[1:28:14] i love you and i'll pick you up
[1:28:17] and i'll make you into a sign i'll make
[1:28:20] you into an everlasting sign
[1:28:22] i'll make you i want you to build an ark
[1:28:24] what's an ark
[1:28:25] i'll show you what an ark is i will
[1:28:29] and everybody that believes what you say
[1:28:31] everybody that believes how you live
[1:28:33] everybody that believes and watches you
[1:28:36] and comes in that ark
[1:28:37] they will be saved praise the lord
[1:28:40] god fulfilling his word amen and
[1:28:45] who's going to be the president who's
[1:28:47] going to what are they going to do next
[1:28:48] what do they do
[1:28:54] praise the lord amen now
[1:28:58] i love the book of daniel let's go over
[1:29:01] here and
[1:29:03] um you know let's go back to matthew 24
[1:29:06] because i gotta read matthew 24
[1:29:08] first
[1:29:11] amen in matthew 24 so now watch
[1:29:16] so he says well let's just start at
[1:29:19] verse 38.
[1:29:21] so he says for as in the days that were
[1:29:23] before the flood they were eating and
[1:29:25] drinking marrying and giving in marriage
[1:29:27] until the day that noah entered in the
[1:29:29] ark and knew not until the flood came
[1:29:31] and took them all away
[1:29:33] and so shall also be the coming of the
[1:29:34] son of man be
[1:29:39] so we know
[1:29:43] that brother branham in the five
[1:29:45] junctions of time he preaches
[1:29:47] he says so in the in that day what day
[1:29:49] in in
[1:29:50] noah's day before noah's day he says we
[1:29:53] find out that they begin to work with
[1:29:55] copper
[1:29:55] then they begin to work with metal and
[1:29:57] look today they're even making chips and
[1:29:59] planes and everything else metal workers
[1:30:01] great intelligence a great time in
[1:30:03] school
[1:30:03] a great educational program just before
[1:30:06] the
[1:30:07] end of the world
[1:30:10] and jesus christ when he was here on the
[1:30:13] earth he said as it was in the days of
[1:30:14] noah so shall it be in the coming of the
[1:30:16] son of man
[1:30:18] we're here look at the world
[1:30:21] i was talking with mrs wood and mr wood
[1:30:24] today
[1:30:24] we were eating dinner upon we were
[1:30:26] talking about divorce cases and things
[1:30:28] in the united states and we have the
[1:30:29] highest rate of divorces
[1:30:31] than all the world put together we have
[1:30:33] more divorces
[1:30:34] i imagine now we don't have many
[1:30:36] divorces
[1:30:37] like they had back in 1956 because
[1:30:39] nobody gets married anymore
[1:30:41] [Laughter]
[1:30:44] you can just sign a prenuptial or
[1:30:47] whatever and
[1:30:48] cohabitate or whatever you know
[1:30:53] men the bible said they would be
[1:30:56] marrying and giving in marriage eating
[1:30:58] and drinking
[1:30:59] the morals and so forth that they'd have
[1:31:01] and how that they are
[1:31:03] marrying and giving and marrying
[1:31:04] marriage in reno nevada
[1:31:07] men go out live with a girl they marry
[1:31:09] that girl they take her for his wife
[1:31:10] live with her for a few days
[1:31:12] he don't like her he kicks her off
[1:31:13] without the courts
[1:31:15] ungodly people give him a divorce and a
[1:31:16] license to marry again
[1:31:18] another but god says that is wrong
[1:31:21] that's right
[1:31:22] but they will do it our civilization is
[1:31:24] crumbling
[1:31:25] we are that it's a sign a post
[1:31:29] that we're at the end time
[1:31:34] amen now when i worked in livonia
[1:31:37] at our second facility i met a whole
[1:31:40] bunch of muslim guys
[1:31:42] great bunch and i learned a lot from
[1:31:45] these muslim men
[1:31:46] but one of the most interesting one was
[1:31:48] a young man that i met back in the
[1:31:49] shipping department
[1:31:51] and he was telling me how that his
[1:31:53] father had been married 14 times
[1:31:56] i said what how's that work he said
[1:31:59] he said well he says you go down before
[1:32:01] the amman that's the muslim
[1:32:03] priest and you get married and he says
[1:32:06] if your wife
[1:32:07] disobeys you and she don't do what you
[1:32:09] say do you can take her right back down
[1:32:11] there you can put her away and get
[1:32:12] another one
[1:32:14] i said wow
[1:32:21] and he had some thing i think he was
[1:32:23] looking on his third one
[1:32:25] i go i said i don't i said how many kids
[1:32:27] you got
[1:32:31] see it's a sign it's a sign
[1:32:34] friends it's a sign
[1:32:39] so he said that would that's and jesus
[1:32:41] put it right in the scriptures
[1:32:43] he says marrying and then giving
[1:32:46] or giving somebody to get married again
[1:32:49] and they're already married
[1:32:51] that's what married and giving and
[1:32:53] marriage means
[1:32:56] until the day that noah entered into the
[1:32:59] ark
[1:33:00] and they knew not until the flood came
[1:33:02] and took them all away because that's
[1:33:03] what
[1:33:04] peter said he said right they saw the
[1:33:06] world
[1:33:07] but they had no respect for god they had
[1:33:10] no respect for his
[1:33:11] laws they had no respect for his word
[1:33:13] they
[1:33:14] they didn't believe it when he said
[1:33:16] god's going to judge you for this he's
[1:33:18] coming he's going to
[1:33:19] bury the place in water you either get
[1:33:21] in the ark
[1:33:22] ah boat look we got titanium
[1:33:26] we got metal that can handle the stress
[1:33:29] and you're building a boat out of
[1:33:31] bolts of wood
[1:33:34] how's that going to work doesn't matter
[1:33:38] that was their prescription that was
[1:33:41] what god
[1:33:42] said and if he'd had never pitched it on
[1:33:44] the inside and the out
[1:33:45] it still would have float because it was
[1:33:47] god's word
[1:33:50] you've got to start believing what god
[1:33:52] has written about
[1:33:54] you you are
[1:33:57] the light in the age in this hour
[1:34:02] amen there should be two in the field
[1:34:06] and one should be taken and the other
[1:34:07] one left
[1:34:08] two women should be grinding at the mill
[1:34:10] the one should be taken the other one
[1:34:11] left
[1:34:12] watch therefore for you know not what
[1:34:15] hour your lord is
[1:34:16] coming but there will be signs
[1:34:22] but know this that if the good man of
[1:34:25] the house had known and what watched the
[1:34:27] thief was coming
[1:34:28] he would have watched and would have not
[1:34:31] have suffered his house to be
[1:34:32] broken up and they hadn't even recorded
[1:34:35] they didn't even create ring doorbells
[1:34:39] but you know what friend you have no
[1:34:42] idea
[1:34:44] when jesus is coming and there's nothing
[1:34:47] you can do about it
[1:34:50] because if you would have known
[1:34:53] when that guy was going to break into
[1:34:55] your house
[1:34:56] you would have been awake you'd have
[1:34:59] been there
[1:35:00] you might even had the police hiding in
[1:35:02] the bushes
[1:35:04] but jesus isn't coming that way
[1:35:09] but if you know the biblical signs then
[1:35:11] you go
[1:35:12] ah okay i'm with this i got it
[1:35:19] therefore be ye also ready
[1:35:23] for in such an hour as you think not the
[1:35:26] son of man is coming
[1:35:29] who then is a faithful and a wise
[1:35:31] servant whom his lord hath made ruler
[1:35:33] over his household
[1:35:34] to give them meat in due season blessed
[1:35:37] is that servant
[1:35:38] whom his lord when he cometh shall find
[1:35:40] so doing
[1:35:42] verily i say unto you that he shall make
[1:35:44] him ruler over all of his goods
[1:35:46] but enough that evil servant so say in
[1:35:48] his heart
[1:35:49] my lord delayeth his coming
[1:35:54] and he doesn't tell you about the signs
[1:35:57] and he don't tell you what hour you're
[1:35:59] living in
[1:36:03] and then he begins to smite his fellow
[1:36:05] servants
[1:36:07] and to eat and drink with the drunken
[1:36:08] becomes slothful
[1:36:10] and sin don't matter no more and
[1:36:12] everything he starts to fall asleep
[1:36:15] in the night because they drink in the
[1:36:18] night
[1:36:19] they're drunken in the night they sin in
[1:36:21] the night
[1:36:22] and he says if they do that the lord of
[1:36:25] that servant shall come in a day when he
[1:36:27] looketh not for him
[1:36:28] and in an hour that he is not aware of
[1:36:31] and shall cut him asunder and appoint
[1:36:33] him his portion
[1:36:34] with the hypocrites and there shall be
[1:36:37] weeping
[1:36:38] and gnashing of teeth and if you go
[1:36:41] and look everywhere where there's
[1:36:42] weeping and gnashing of teeth
[1:36:44] that is the great tribulation
[1:36:48] and that's right before the raptures
[1:36:52] right before the great tribulation
[1:36:56] so it's right in these scriptures right
[1:36:58] here
[1:37:00] now and don't really
[1:37:06] this is this should not make you afraid
[1:37:11] if you if you are saved that's what you
[1:37:14] that's the question
[1:37:16] if you are saved and you know that god
[1:37:20] is walking with you and you know
[1:37:23] that he saved you and he changed your
[1:37:25] life
[1:37:26] then brother this should just be
[1:37:27] encouraging you
[1:37:29] this should really be encouraging i love
[1:37:31] the book of daniel so we're going to
[1:37:33] read daniel 12
[1:37:34] number 4 or verse 4.
[1:37:38] so so god and and as we said
[1:37:43] two weeks ago the book of daniel the
[1:37:45] thing about the book of daniel the book
[1:37:47] of daniel
[1:37:48] is specifically a a jewish
[1:37:51] prophet that was in babylon which is the
[1:37:55] gentiles
[1:37:56] and he interpreted dreams and visions in
[1:37:59] every dream every vision everything
[1:38:02] in the book of daniel has to do with the
[1:38:06] gentile
[1:38:07] world kingdom
[1:38:10] and at the end of the gentile world
[1:38:12] kingdom verse 4
[1:38:16] let's start with verse 2 because that's
[1:38:17] kind of nice he says and many of them
[1:38:19] that are asleep
[1:38:20] when the dust of the earth shall awake
[1:38:22] some to everlasting life and some to
[1:38:24] shame and everlasting contempt
[1:38:25] so that's the white throne that's you
[1:38:27] know the second resurrection
[1:38:28] and they that are wise shall shine as
[1:38:30] the brightness of the firmament because
[1:38:32] they're the children of the day
[1:38:33] that's you and me and they that turn
[1:38:36] many to righteousness
[1:38:38] as the stars forever and ever that's you
[1:38:40] and me
[1:38:42] that's us but thou
[1:38:45] daniel shut up the words and seal the
[1:38:48] book
[1:38:49] even to the time of the end wait a
[1:38:51] minute the time of the end
[1:38:53] yes when jesus is coming back
[1:38:57] shut up the words seal the book
[1:39:00] i close the door no man opens it i can
[1:39:03] seal a book and there ain't nobody gonna
[1:39:05] break the lock
[1:39:08] brother branham said just before he
[1:39:09] preached the seals he said you know he
[1:39:10] says i preached the seals many many many
[1:39:12] many times
[1:39:15] but he says revelations 10 says that
[1:39:17] mighty angel came down and
[1:39:19] he was the lamb that could open the seal
[1:39:25] nobody else can open them seals
[1:39:28] this angel told daniel he says you shut
[1:39:30] up the book you seal it
[1:39:32] even to the time of the end and i'm
[1:39:34] going to give you a sign
[1:39:36] when you're at the end many shall run
[1:39:40] to and fro and knowledge shall be
[1:39:43] increased
[1:39:46] and daniel said okay and i looked and
[1:39:50] behold there stood
[1:39:52] two angels one on this side of the river
[1:39:55] and one on the other side of the river
[1:39:57] and the one on the one side he was
[1:39:59] clothed with linen which was upon the
[1:40:01] waters of the river he said
[1:40:02] and i said he said how long shall it be
[1:40:06] to the end of these wonders when is the
[1:40:08] end time
[1:40:10] and i heard the man clothed in linen
[1:40:13] which was upon the waters of the river
[1:40:15] when he held up his right hand and his
[1:40:17] left hand unto the heavens and swear by
[1:40:19] him that liveth forever that it should
[1:40:21] be for a time
[1:40:22] times and a half and when he shall have
[1:40:24] accomplished to scatter the power of the
[1:40:26] holy people
[1:40:27] all these things shall be finished
[1:40:29] that's we know
[1:40:31] that's tribulation and and then
[1:40:34] i heard but it was sealed see i didn't
[1:40:38] understand
[1:40:39] it was sealed i couldn't understand it i
[1:40:41] no no no no don't
[1:40:42] don't stop tell me what's in the book
[1:40:45] tell me oh my lord what shall be the end
[1:40:48] of these things
[1:40:49] when are you coming back what's going on
[1:40:51] when is jewish when is everything going
[1:40:53] to be finished and he said
[1:40:54] go thy way daniel for the words are
[1:40:58] closed up
[1:40:59] and sealed till the time of the end
[1:41:10] so let's see what did he tell him there
[1:41:13] what'd he tell him time of the end
[1:41:16] many shall run to and fro and knowledge
[1:41:19] shall be increased
[1:41:21] so i looked here are some things for you
[1:41:24] to think about
[1:41:26] really the industrial revolution started
[1:41:30] around 1760.
[1:41:32] prior to 1760 think about that
[1:41:37] 1700 years
[1:41:41] the world never moved forward
[1:41:46] created the wheel and they created fire
[1:41:50] and they had metal and they had chariots
[1:41:54] and they had horses
[1:41:55] but they never moved any farther
[1:41:59] around 1700 they discovered steam
[1:42:06] and the industrial revolution started
[1:42:09] everything just started to take off
[1:42:13] like really crazy
[1:42:19] in the 1890s so we started the
[1:42:22] industrial revolution started in the
[1:42:23] 1760s and
[1:42:25] united states was born in 1776 right
[1:42:28] so they but see when they had the the
[1:42:31] war they were still
[1:42:32] shooting with cannons they were shooting
[1:42:34] with guns that were handmade
[1:42:37] every gun was handmade so the flint's on
[1:42:40] this gun wouldn't go on this gun
[1:42:42] and this barrel you couldn't take it off
[1:42:43] here and put it on you know i know it's
[1:42:45] all about this
[1:42:46] and all this stuff nothing it would it
[1:42:48] just it just was stagnant
[1:42:52] but in the 1890s towards the after the
[1:42:56] civil war
[1:42:58] man started to experiment
[1:43:01] with gas-powered engines horses were the
[1:43:04] primary means of transportation
[1:43:07] as they had been since the time of the
[1:43:09] romans
[1:43:12] wow the problem
[1:43:16] was rapidly worsening worsening an
[1:43:19] estimated 150 000 horses lived in new
[1:43:22] york city alone and produce an average
[1:43:24] of 22 pounds of manure every day
[1:43:28] george warning junior new york street
[1:43:30] cleaning commissioner described
[1:43:32] manhattan as a stinking with the
[1:43:34] emancipations of petrifying
[1:43:36] organic matter okay
[1:43:42] but within a few years
[1:43:45] they went from 150 000 horses
[1:43:50] within a few years a new technology the
[1:43:53] automobile
[1:43:54] made the horse obsolete humans had been
[1:43:57] getting around with horses for
[1:43:59] thousands of years but when better
[1:44:01] technology arrived
[1:44:02] it changed and it happened quickly
[1:44:06] knowledge shall increase
[1:44:09] by 1912 automobiles
[1:44:12] outnumbered horses in new york city and
[1:44:15] the manure problem
[1:44:16] went away
[1:44:21] in 1903 the wright brothers
[1:44:24] had their first successful flight with a
[1:44:27] powered airplane
[1:44:31] in 1909 i just got a
[1:44:34] car magazine at home and i found this
[1:44:38] donna and i had to drive to holland on
[1:44:40] monday
[1:44:41] and we were driving along and we saw an
[1:44:42] amish guy with a trip with a
[1:44:44] horse and buggy and horse and buggy
[1:44:47] they're only doing like 20 miles an hour
[1:44:51] and my dad they moved from
[1:44:55] from chelsea to manchester which is only
[1:44:57] 17 miles
[1:44:58] and he said that when they moved the
[1:45:00] farm from chelsea to manchester it took
[1:45:02] one whole day with two horses
[1:45:06] in a in a hay
[1:45:10] cart with all their housing stuff on it
[1:45:14] one whole day to drive 17 miles
[1:45:19] now that don't seem like much
[1:45:22] in 1909 alice ramsey she's
[1:45:25] documented as the first woman to drive
[1:45:27] from new york to san francisco
[1:45:30] 3000 miles it took her 59 days
[1:45:36] you can fly there in six and a half
[1:45:37] hours today
[1:45:40] what did he say seal up the book
[1:45:44] even to the time of the end many shall
[1:45:47] run
[1:45:48] to and fro you can get on a plane and
[1:45:52] fly to europe
[1:45:54] you can go anywhere around this world in
[1:45:56] no time at all
[1:45:57] see you can't make that statement
[1:46:01] in the eighteen hundreds you can't make
[1:46:04] that statement
[1:46:05] in 1905 but you can make it
[1:46:10] now
[1:46:15] in 1928
[1:46:18] the first home tv sets were put
[1:46:22] in america
[1:46:26] i like how they wrote this they said
[1:46:28] couch potatoes can trace their roots to
[1:46:30] this date
[1:46:31] in 1928 when three experimental
[1:46:34] television sets were installed in
[1:46:36] private homes
[1:46:37] in schenectady new york not that there
[1:46:39] was much to see the test
[1:46:41] broadcast by general electric and rca
[1:46:43] being of a person
[1:46:45] smoking followed by a man playing a
[1:46:48] ukulele
[1:46:51] and now you got them in your pocket
[1:46:56] knowledge shall increase just
[1:47:02] cell phones weren't even around barely
[1:47:05] before 2000. so we're only 21 years in
[1:47:08] their cell phones
[1:47:10] and look at how fast they are everybody
[1:47:12] got a cell phone watch
[1:47:14] i won't have one because i don't like
[1:47:15] dick tracy i remember dick tracy
[1:47:18] but i don't i don't want some watch
[1:47:21] that's hooked up to a satellite that
[1:47:23] then is hooked up to my phone and then
[1:47:24] hooked up to something else and then
[1:47:25] hooked up to something else
[1:47:26] and i have no idea where that date is
[1:47:28] going i'll keep this one here i can wind
[1:47:30] it i can if i don't like it i can just
[1:47:32] take it off and say
[1:47:33] get away from me
[1:47:37] in 1981 the personal computer
[1:47:41] was invented i was there
[1:47:46] because in 1984 we got our first cad
[1:47:49] systems and we
[1:47:50] went from drawing pencil drawings 50
[1:47:53] hours a week
[1:47:54] to drawing on a computer system
[1:47:58] that is not that long ago
[1:48:02] that is not that long ago everything is
[1:48:05] moving
[1:48:06] so fast daniel's prophecy
[1:48:10] is right before your eyes and you
[1:48:14] wouldn't know it
[1:48:15] if you didn't read the book
[1:48:21] can you discern the signs of the time
[1:48:26] everybody has a weather app on their
[1:48:29] phone on their watch they get alerts if
[1:48:31] there's a tornado coming or whatever
[1:48:33] else
[1:48:33] but when you see all these things
[1:48:38] lift up your head your redemption
[1:48:41] draweth nine
[1:48:42] amen amen praise the lord
[1:48:46] amen amen
[1:48:52] and i'm going to stop right there
