[27:26] you praise the Lord
[27:28] lord it's so good to be in the house of
[27:30] the Lord I woke up this morning with a
[27:33] like a different
[27:34] feeling it was a feeling that I didn't
[27:37] have to get up and
[27:39] study and I'll tell you you haven't had
[27:42] that feeling it's it's a good
[27:44] feeling um but you know
[27:47] what I I I tripled my prayer
[27:51] time tripled my prayer time because I I
[27:54] felt my heart that I have a better
[27:56] chance of receiving from the
[27:58] Lord and uh what a what a blessing it is
[28:01] to be able to come to church and
[28:05] receive it really really is and uh I'm
[28:08] thankful that God has given us a
[28:09] fivefold Ministry to receive and we
[28:13] could come here we don't have to second
[28:15] guess whether what we're hearing is the
[28:18] truth we can we
[28:21] can uh anchor our soul to that and the
[28:25] Very the very word that we're hearing is
[28:28] the very word that is going to
[28:30] materialize in our life and get us out
[28:33] of here so it's really important it's
[28:36] really really really important we have
[28:39] received
[28:41] salvation many of us have received
[28:44] sanctification receive the baptism of
[28:46] the Holy Ghost but that word has to
[28:49] become
[28:50] materialized and uh that's why we're
[28:52] pressing in amen I think brother Johnson
[28:55] has testimony
[28:57] so we're going to let him
[29:02] brother
[29:04] we we're so happy this morning to get to
[29:08] hear Brother TK I met brother TK in Gana
[29:14] the first trip I ever took and he's been
[29:18] a faithful brother he loves the Lord in
[29:24] fact when he was he was not the pastor
[29:28] but he entertained me while I was there

[29:44] church for praying when I was in the
[29:49] hospital I appreciate that the Lord has
[29:52] touched me but I still need a little
[29:56] more amen so God bless all of you and
[30:01] I'm glad to have a pastor like brother

[30:34] think that was such a perfect
[30:35] introduction for our brother he has been
[30:38] uh such a blessing to us each time that
[30:40] he's been here and uh we heard a good
[30:44] report from Brother SEL Browning's
[30:46] church he would just come from there and
[30:49] brother Bill Sanchez told it was just a
[30:51] wonderful wonderful service and I
[30:54] remember the last time he was here we
[30:56] were blessed
[30:57] and uh let our prayer be today that
[31:02] whatever is spoken we will not leave it
[31:05] here that will take it because if we

[38:25] 8 Romans chapter
[38:35] 8 Romans
[38:41] [Music]
[38:44] 8 verse 14 and
[38:48] 15 for as many as are led by the spirit
[38:53] of God they are the sons of
[38:58] God for we have not received the spirit
[39:02] of bandage again to
[39:05] fear but we have received the spirit of
[39:10] adoption whereby we cry ABA father
[39:15] amen
[39:18] amen May the name of the Lord be praised
[39:22] amen so once again we are happy to be
[39:26] back in the house of the Lord and I'm
[39:28] very happy to stand here this morning
[39:31] and uh behind the sacred dust to
[39:36] encourage the people of
[39:38] God and I want us
[39:41] to speak this morning on the scripture
[39:44] or the verse from the book of Samuel
[39:46] which said let no man's heart
[39:51] fail let no man's heart
[39:54] fail and this were was a time
[39:59] of difficult for
[40:02] Israel you know Israel even as
[40:07] today it has been battle upon
[40:11] battle they've been fighting physical
[40:14] battles why we have been fighting
[40:17] spiritual
[40:19] battles and then the prophet of God said
[40:21] Israel is a type of the
[40:24] church and so
[40:27] when we see something
[40:28] happening in the flesh around Israel we
[40:33] should watch
[40:35] out and then when I think
[40:39] about the crisis they are in today then
[40:43] I begin to think about what cost
[40:47] it and then I we realize just before
[40:52] this problem setting in Israel the
[40:56] country was
[40:58] divided they were so much
[41:02] divided they were almost about to fight
[41:06] themselves because of
[41:11] misunderstanding
[41:12] because somebody was thinking ah what is
[41:16] this what is that and then they became
[41:20] divided and in their unguided
[41:25] moment the enemy Snak in
[41:28] am the whole world knows about Israel
[41:32] the security of
[41:33] Israel the whole world
[41:36] knows how Israel does not play with
[41:39] their
[41:41] security how their agent they whatever
[41:44] sping agents and what they are always on
[41:47] the alert so what
[41:54] happened India on guided
[41:59] moment brother Bram
[42:01] said if the devil the enemy can get us
[42:06] shooting at one
[42:12] another it takes advantage of
[42:17] us let me see if I can get a little
[42:21] something and
[42:22] read if the enemy can get
[42:26] to fight against one another
[42:29] divided when we get
[42:32] divided he
[42:34] gets the
[42:36] advantage and when we begin to shoot one
[42:39] another the prophet said then we are
[42:42] doing the work for the
[42:45] enemy if he can get us shooting at one
[42:48] another then he will
[42:51] relax he will sit back and he will see
[42:54] us fighting
[42:57] and this is when you look at Israel
[43:00] today there's never been a time in
[43:04] Israel for then to lose so much people
[43:07] in a day on that 7th of
[43:10] October when they have to
[43:13] killed over 1,00 1,400 Israeli on their
[43:18] own
[43:20] soil even in their Wars you can't kill
[43:23] many like
[43:25] that
[43:27] but the enemy when they got
[43:30] divided and they were demonstrating
[43:34] against in for and
[43:38] against and
[43:40] so what they should do they were not and
[43:45] also I think of uh you know when we
[43:48] become
[43:50] complient compeny amen many of times we
[43:55] come to to that
[43:57] spot and we think oh we have it
[44:01] all and we think nobody can touch us and
[44:05] we become self
[44:09] secure and when you get to that
[44:12] point then you are in
[44:16] trouble then the four we come
[44:20] in I pray that the Lord will help us yes
[44:24] to re examine our
[44:29] lives like he spoke to the first church
[44:33] and he told
[44:34] them remember from where thou has
[44:40] fallen
[44:42] remember thy First Love from where thou
[44:47] Hast
[44:49] fallen so my brothers and my sisters
[44:52] beloved in
[44:54] Christ we should not take anything for
[44:57] granted amen we should be up and be
[45:02] doing
[45:04] Hallelujah let me just read this quote
[45:06] the prophet said
[45:09] here he said have never talked like this
[45:14] to a group of
[45:17] people but in this locality
[45:21] here and throughout the Nations it is
[45:25] become
[45:27] now if the devil can keep us
[45:30] separated he's got us shooting at one
[45:33] another amen is God open
[45:39] Target and anywhere he wants to
[45:43] shoot and what is the use of
[45:45] shooting we are shooting one another
[45:49] see see so he can just sit back and
[45:54] relax
[45:58] if he can get us shooting at one another
[46:01] then he will sit back and
[46:08] relax let me just give
[46:12] you if I have found Grace in your sight
[46:17] through
[46:18] God you take my
[46:22] word for this
[46:24] Breen if you want to be a
[46:28] blessing and get a
[46:31] blessing when a man has done you
[46:35] wrong and it's absolutely
[46:39] justly I mean he has done you wrong and
[46:43] you know that he's done you
[46:46] wrong he's done you
[46:49] evil don't mention that
[46:53] amen you take him
[46:57] to prayer before God Amen when somebody
[47:01] has done you wrong he said I mean he has
[47:05] done you
[47:07] evil don't mention that praise
[47:11] God you take him to
[47:15] God in
[47:17] prayer and don't take it in a way of
[47:21] just a selfish way or say well I'm
[47:24] supposed to do this but stand with your
[47:28] shoulder to his shoulder amen and stand
[47:32] in the presence of God our
[47:36] Father the way a prayer should be made
[47:39] in the presence of God and say father
[47:43] here is my brother and is justly he
[47:48] deserves punishment because he's done me
[47:54] evil and I I don't see why he did
[47:58] it take note of this the prophet said
[48:03] then excuse me let God go to talking to
[48:08] you take note let God go to talking to
[48:12] you when you've taken your brother or
[48:17] your sister or your husband or your
[48:20] mother or whoever has done you wrong and
[48:23] you have gone to God In Prayer
[48:26] then let God go to talking to you not to
[48:31] the one that has offended you good
[48:34] because sometime say we pray God let him
[48:36] see what he has
[48:38] done God let him
[48:41] repent the prophet said let God go
[48:44] talking to
[48:48] you we believe the
[48:51] prophet and we remember that God sent a
[48:55] prophet
[48:56] to bring us back to God's
[48:59] order like brother brah told us in every
[49:02] age when the teachers and the
[49:05] theologians and the people have astray
[49:08] they've gone astray from God's part then
[49:11] God sends a prophet so that the prophet
[49:15] will bring us back to God's order and
[49:18] God's principles
[49:23] amen not what you think or what you feel
[49:27] or what you want or how you want
[49:31] it God always gives us
[49:35] instructions and God tells us what he
[49:38] wants from us not how we want to
[49:42] approach
[49:43] God how we want to come to him or what
[49:48] we want to do but how he wants us to
[49:53] approach him amen like like in the olden
[49:57] days and he told them how to come to the
[50:00] temple he said he choose a place God
[50:03] choosen place of worship God's provided
[50:07] place of worship and he said when you
[50:09] are bringing in your
[50:12] sacrifice pass through this
[50:14] gate don't enter any other gate bring it
[50:19] through this
[50:21] way it's not the way you want or how you
[50:26] want or where you want to apply the
[50:30] blood but where he said the blood should
[50:33] be applied on your door
[50:38] poost and he told them how they should
[50:41] dress what they should do remember the
[50:45] word of the lord always comes to the
[50:48] prophet
[50:50] am he Tau them in this hour even how
[50:53] they should dress
[50:56] how they should eat he said eat in
[51:00] haste so no matter how you have been
[51:03] eating in the previous years or the
[51:05] previous days or whatever he said this
[51:07] time eat in
[51:11] haste with your shoes on and your staff
[51:15] in your hands and your B on be on your
[51:19] toes that is divine order that is divine
[51:24] instructions
[51:26] so it is not what anybody wants to do it
[51:30] is the order of
[51:31] God so remember today it is not how you
[51:35] want to live or how you want to behave
[51:38] or what I want to preach or where I want
[51:40] to go but where does he want me to
[51:45] go what does he want us to do how does
[51:49] he want me to be
[51:52] baptized what does he want us to preach
[51:54] and believe in this
[51:59] hour he would not have sent a prophet to
[52:02] them or to as if he had wanted us to
[52:05] continue in our own
[52:14] ways praise the Lord the prophet taught
[52:17] us I'm sorry that you might be say every
[52:20] day the prophet but that's all that I
[52:22] can say because I am saying what he said
[52:24] amen and the Bible tells that he that
[52:27] have hear Let Him hear what the spirit
[52:29] is saying to the churches and the spirit
[52:32] spoke through the
[52:34] prophet in every age God's mind God's
[52:37] thought what he wants comes to one man
[52:40] and from that one man others that have
[52:44] been Faithfully taught they take the
[52:47] same word and they give it out and
[52:50] that's what we are
[52:52] doing thank you Lord praise the Lord
[52:57] God told Cain and Abel when he asked him
[52:58] to bring offering and sacrifice to him
[53:01] he told them what to
[53:02] do when came brought the wrong one God
[53:04] said can't you see what your brother has
[53:08] done see AB see what he has done and
[53:11] brother BR said Cain was too proud to
[53:15] Humble his
[53:17] pride so if you have any way as we are
[53:21] here we are asked to examine Our Lives
[53:25] by the blueprint of the
[53:29] age because he told
[53:32] us as the Lord works in the midst of the
[53:35] golden
[53:37] candlesticks he examines your life my
[53:41] life by the blueprint which he has
[53:45] given so we are
[53:49] asked to know what has been given to us
[53:53] our strength lay is or lies in our
[53:58] knowledge of the truth and our adherence
[54:02] to the
[54:03] truth it's not enough to know Mysteries
[54:06] and Revelations and the angels and the
[54:09] Seven Seals and the Seven Thunders and
[54:11] the trumpet and the Mysteries it's
[54:13] wonderful but what are we doing with
[54:17] those things
[54:19] amen that's right because it see we pack
[54:22] our head with knowledge and knowledge
[54:25] pffs
[54:27] up if we have the true revelation of God
[54:30] in our heart it will keep us
[54:35] humble praise the Lord
[54:38] amen don't be afraid to say Amen to the
[54:40] word of
[54:42] God
[54:44] hallelujah because you go to your ball
[54:48] games you see the ball games and they
[54:51] watch the ball games and the prophet
[54:52] said they get into their
[54:56] spirit and they play with them they run
[55:00] with them they Shout with them so when
[55:02] we come to church let us enter into the
[55:05] spirit of
[55:09] worship
[55:11] Hallelujah may God help us so it behoves
[55:15] us when God speaks to forsake our
[55:20] ways no matter what we think no matter
[55:23] what we feel no matter who we are and
[55:26] what we think we are and what we think
[55:28] we know when God speaks we have to
[55:31] forsake our
[55:35] ways
[55:37] amen
[55:39] hallelujah so the prophet said let God
[55:42] go to talking to
[55:44] you and you will see take note of
[55:48] this and you will see
[55:52] maybe what the man what that man has
[55:56] been through whose man the one that has
[55:59] offended you the one that has wrong you
[56:03] maybe you will see what he might have
[56:05] gone
[56:07] through the devil has Twisted him up
[56:13] somewhere and cause him to do
[56:18] that the devil had Twisted him
[56:22] somewhere and caused him to buyb and
[56:25] slander and fight or whatever he might
[56:29] have done to
[56:30] you listening to what the prophet
[56:35] said the prophet
[56:38] said though he is absolutely
[56:43] wrong though he is absolutely
[56:50] wrong before you leave the Throne of God
[56:54] you you'll be feeling sorry for that man
[56:57] that's
[56:59] right though he is absolutely
[57:03] wrong but before you leave the Throne of
[57:06] God you will be feeling sorry for that
[57:21] one you will be simple baptizing with
[57:25] that
[57:27] brother who which brother the one that
[57:30] has offended
[57:32] you the one that has wrong
[57:34] you the one that have gossip about
[57:38] you the one that have told Li about
[57:41] you the one that has looked down upon
[57:44] you the one that have ridicul you amen
[57:49] and scuff at you you will be feeling
[57:52] sorry for him
[57:57] you'll be sympathizing with
[58:01] him and you will and when you get back
[58:05] down on Earth again that's after prayer
[58:09] you will go over to that brother and
[58:11] shake his
[58:13] hands that's the prophet of God speaking
[58:17] us advising us am admonishing us telling
[58:23] and showing us the way of victory
[58:25] amen showing us what will make God
[58:30] happy showing us how we can please the
[58:33] Lord
[58:35] am humanly speaking it's not easy to do
[58:40] this it takes God to do
[58:47] that
[58:49] amen well even if you don't say Amen
[58:51] still amen
[58:53] am amen amen
[58:57] when you get back down on Earth again
[58:59] you will go over to that brother and
[59:01] shake his hand cuz you know what he's
[59:04] been
[59:05] through you can't stand with a MTAR in
[59:09] the presence of God to condemn any
[59:12] anybody I don't believe no sir even if
[59:17] he is a rank sinner that's
[59:20] right good work and what about a brother
[59:23] that has made a mistake
[59:27] amen though I say he is
[59:30] wrong sometimes he is accus wrong when
[59:34] he's not
[59:38] wrong sometimes he is Accused wrong when
[59:42] he is not
[59:44] wrong there are many at times we condemn
[59:47] ourselves we condemn Brothers we condemn
[59:51] we think this fellow is wrong he might
[59:53] not be wrong
[59:55] the prophet of God said you just assumed
[59:58] that somebody hates you somebody doesn't
[1:00:01] like
[1:00:02] you your mind will go that way your
[1:00:06] action will be that way you will see
[1:00:09] everything that way because what you
[1:00:11] have conceived it and when you conceive
[1:00:14] you will
[1:00:15] birth you will give birth to what you
[1:00:21] conceive so if you consider a wrong
[1:00:25] thought a wrong idea or something about
[1:00:29] somebody you will see everything that
[1:00:32] way yeah that's
[1:00:34] true everybody will be speaking if that
[1:00:37] one speaks something
[1:00:39] hey oh he didn't even greet me he didn't
[1:00:42] even look at me if he look at you you
[1:00:44] say why is he looking at me he would say
[1:00:48] it if he doesn't why is he not
[1:00:53] looking human beings are terrible they
[1:00:56] are he sees me and he's laughing I don't
[1:00:59] know why and he's not laughing you say
[1:01:01] see he doesn't
[1:01:03] laugh what what what are
[1:01:07] we we find fault with everything and
[1:01:10] more so when you have an idea about
[1:01:13] somebody
[1:01:17] right it say sometimes he is Accused
[1:01:22] wrongly and it might not be
[1:01:25] wrong but once you conceive that thought
[1:01:28] you will see everything that
[1:01:31] way Lord Jesus Keep Us near The Cross
[1:01:34] and help
[1:01:38] us when you form an opinion about
[1:01:42] somebody that fellow might be as
[1:01:45] innocent as innocent can
[1:01:49] be and I oh God help us sometimes you
[1:01:52] think something about somebody
[1:01:54] and you have an idea you see the fellow
[1:01:57] and you annoyed the fellow might be
[1:01:59] innocent and you are Bing and beding
[1:02:03] yourself why should you be annoyed and
[1:02:06] as long as you keep in that condition
[1:02:09] you have been affected spiritually and
[1:02:13] physically the prophet of God said it
[1:02:15] takes more effort to frown your face
[1:02:18] than to
[1:02:21] laugh so every time you see somebody you
[1:02:23] frown your face and you are Bing within
[1:02:26] so who is killing who you are killing
[1:02:33] yourself I don't know why they don't
[1:02:35] understand me and this don't
[1:02:38] I you know what you have to pray for
[1:02:41] pray that God will help you to
[1:02:43] understand than to be
[1:02:47] understood I pray to God help me if I
[1:02:50] can understand why you don't understand
[1:02:52] me I'll will make it
[1:02:55] if you can you pray to God Lord help me
[1:02:57] to understand than to be
[1:03:01] understood if I can understand why he
[1:03:04] don't even go why he doesn't call me why
[1:03:07] he doesn't do this oh God help us
[1:03:13] right we need his grace so
[1:03:17] much so that we not just be hearers of
[1:03:21] God's word and not doers of it
[1:03:27] amen oh we need the love of God to be
[1:03:30] shared abroad in our
[1:03:33] hearts because brother Bram told us love
[1:03:37] is the strongest
[1:03:39] force it said when it is put to test he
[1:03:42] will defeat the strongest
[1:03:44] enemy
[1:03:46] amen amen and I said Jesus said we
[1:03:51] should love one another above everything
[1:03:55] and the Lord Jesus told us even love
[1:03:58] your neighbor as
[1:04:00] yourself and the Lord Jesus told us love
[1:04:04] your enemies
[1:04:08] amen and I said to
[1:04:10] people if you cannot love your wife as
[1:04:13] your wife you love her as your
[1:04:15] neighbor if you can't love her as your
[1:04:17] neighbor love as your
[1:04:21] enemy because love
[1:04:24] love your enemy love your neighbor love
[1:04:27] yourself so oh this man is too difficult
[1:04:30] oh you can't love him as your neighbor
[1:04:32] not being as your
[1:04:34] enemy so whichever way we pass love is
[1:04:39] there love yourself love your neighbor
[1:04:42] love your wife love your husband love
[1:04:44] even your enemy because Jesus the Lord
[1:04:47] told us if we do good to only those who
[1:04:50] do good to us what else do we get he a
[1:04:53] sinners do the same and the Christian
[1:04:56] the believer is asked to go the extra
[1:05:02] mile may the Lord help us saints of
[1:05:06] God and let us Stand United
[1:05:10] hallu let us stand praying for one
[1:05:12] another we will not we are we are made
[1:05:15] differently for different
[1:05:17] purposes I cannot be like you you cannot
[1:05:19] be like me if you want to be like
[1:05:22] somebody else you create confusion you
[1:05:25] will confuse yourself right
[1:05:27] amen be what God want us to
[1:05:32] be and then we can achieve God's purpose
[1:05:37] or purposes for Our
[1:05:42] Lives May God help us and as I speak
[1:05:45] again I want us to continue to pray for
[1:05:49] Israel that the Lord will help them in
[1:05:51] this time of Crisis is it the whole
[1:05:54] nation the whole the world is going
[1:05:56] against them and it will be that way but
[1:05:59] Jehovah will fight for
[1:06:01] them amen the god of Israel the only
[1:06:06] nation that is called by his name amen
[1:06:09] and he I'm the god of
[1:06:11] Israel so let us remember and pray for
[1:06:14] them and as we pray for them let us pray
[1:06:17] for one another that God will help us as
[1:06:20] is El let in this hour
[1:06:23] amen
[1:06:24] all the story of Israel has been one
[1:06:27] battle after the other and Christianity
[1:06:30] as brother told us it's not a
[1:06:33] picnic we are not in picnic we are in a
[1:06:37] battle
[1:06:39] amen and When Trials and challenges come
[1:06:42] on our way we should not be
[1:06:45] surprised as if some strange or strange
[1:06:49] thing is happening to us Peter said
[1:06:52] it can't told
[1:06:54] Jo because if you have a trial the
[1:06:58] prophet of God said you find favor with
[1:07:01] God and the prophet said God has
[1:07:04] confidence in you and God knows you will
[1:07:08] pass the test yes as he had confidence
[1:07:10] in job he has confidence in you
[1:07:17] amen may God help us so that you will
[1:07:20] not be looking down on yourself and then
[1:07:23] you keep on questioning why me why
[1:07:26] should this happen to me why shouldn't
[1:07:29] it happen to
[1:07:33] you he loves us he pakes us we belong to
[1:07:38] him we don't belong to
[1:07:40] ourselves
[1:07:42] hallelujah oh brother Bram

[1:07:51] little you have to suffer a little
[1:07:55] and sometime when you are going through
[1:07:57] things or challenges or difficulties is
[1:08:01] because God want to use your testimony
[1:08:05] to bless
[1:08:06] somebody we read about Job Jesus refer
[1:08:10] the trial of job but we read it and we
[1:08:12] encouraged amen we read about Daniels we
[1:08:15] read about our fathers of old yes am if
[1:08:19] these brothers or fathers of old did not
[1:08:22] go through these things what will you

[1:08:44] purpose he has a
[1:08:48] reason the try of your faith is more
[1:08:52] precious than and gold that is tried in
[1:08:56] fire
[1:08:58] am so that you can have a
[1:09:01] testimony as I stand here this morning I
[1:09:05] stand to testify to the glory of the
[1:09:07] Lord last year by this time I was very
[1:09:12] sick after I've been here to preach and
[1:09:15] I was shadowed for an operation a
[1:09:17] surgery prostrate surgery and um ah it
[1:09:21] was just difficult thing and and they
[1:09:24] have to take off the prostrate and they
[1:09:26] have to after many examinations and do
[1:09:29] this and do this and do that oh man and
[1:09:34] after that has been done surgery has
[1:09:35] been done it was 14th of November this
[1:09:38] about 19 so last week last year by this
[1:09:41] time I was I was I I could not even do
[1:09:45] move I could not do nothing I have to be
[1:09:48] cleansed I have to be washed because
[1:09:50] after the surgery there was
[1:09:52] complications
[1:09:57] I went to the hospital they asked me to
[1:09:59] do
[1:09:59] cystogram to examine if the stitches
[1:10:03] were Stitch where they Stitch whether it
[1:10:05] was completely healed I went there I lay
[1:10:08] on the table like this and all of a
[1:10:10] sudden I begin to I was trembling
[1:10:12] shaking not just the whole table was
[1:10:15] vibrating with shaking what is happening
[1:10:18] I don't
[1:10:20] know and I have to walk I went to the
[1:10:22] hospital myself and my wife went I was
[1:10:26] fine but God is good that he made this
[1:10:31] issue to happen right in the hospital
[1:10:33] before the doctors amen because where we
[1:10:36] were living oh myself and my wife were
[1:10:40] only in the house because the family
[1:10:42] that we were living with my sister and
[1:10:44] the son that we came to stay with
[1:10:46] they've left to Africa they travel and
[1:10:48] left us there in the house to Africa so
[1:10:52] the closest the closest brother that was
[1:10:55] with first has to drive 45 minutes
[1:10:58] before he can come to where we are and
[1:11:01] at this hour if this challenge I had was
[1:11:04] in the house it would have been very bad
[1:11:07] because we are strangers my wife would
[1:11:10] not know what to do what to call 911
[1:11:13] whatever to do she might not know what
[1:11:15] to do and she will be
[1:11:18] panicking but the Lord work it out that
[1:11:22] it happened right in the hospital before
[1:11:24] the doctors and I said Satan you miss it
[1:11:27] again he miss
[1:11:29] it and right there they have to rush me
[1:11:31] to the emergency I was there for 6
[1:11:35] days after I was discharged I came back
[1:11:39] this time I've wear ctia for 9 months I
[1:11:42] could not pee for 9 months I was wearing
[1:11:45] C even when I came here last year to
[1:11:47] preach I was wearing
[1:11:51] Ceta for 9 months
[1:11:57] I've been to the in and out of the
[1:11:58] hospital I go and come I said take it
[1:12:00] out they will take it out I will come
[1:12:02] back ah I have to run back to the
[1:12:05] hospital what is
[1:12:08] this praise the name of the Lord and I
[1:12:11] came back and at the end of the
[1:12:13] day when they even took the C C or
[1:12:17] whatever to us they took it away I have
[1:12:19] to wear
[1:12:20] Pampers because the doctor told me
[1:12:22] you've wear this thing for night months
[1:12:24] so when they take it out the urine will
[1:12:26] be
[1:12:27] coming and they have to
[1:12:30] wait at the point I could not even walk
[1:12:33] because they took the leaf noes or
[1:12:35] whatever they call it and they said the
[1:12:37] NES have been
[1:12:38] affected and I could not walk I have to
[1:12:42] use the worker to be
[1:12:45] walking I could not raise my leg to put
[1:12:49] here or bring it here when I sit in the
[1:12:52] car my wife or my my nephew they will
[1:12:54] just hold it just in
[1:12:58] pain but what am I saying to the glory
[1:13:00] of God I am standing the way I'm
[1:13:02] standing today to the glory of God I am
[1:13:05] what I am today to the glory of God I am
[1:13:08] back behind the poet again when the
[1:13:11] enemy thought he would send me to
[1:13:12] retirement compos retirement God brought
[1:13:15] me back because he has a work for me to
[1:13:17] do and he knows that I have to be here
[1:13:19] this morning and testify to you that
[1:13:22] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:13:25] and forever to testify to you that God
[1:13:28] is still in the healing business and is
[1:13:30] the same forever and ever he has a
[1:13:32] purpose for my life and when I was going
[1:13:35] through the trials and difficulties I
[1:13:37] only remember brother Brenham said until
[1:13:39] God has finished with you nothing can
[1:13:41] take you out of this life amen and I
[1:13:44] still believe it that until God has
[1:13:46] finished with you or any of us there is
[1:13:49] nothing no sickness no disease nothing
[1:13:52] no power no accident or gunshot can take
[1:13:56] us out of here until God has finished
[1:13:59] his purpose so let no man's heart
[1:14:03] fail don't be
[1:14:06] afraid he has not given that the spirit
[1:14:08] of
[1:14:09] fear he has given it the spirit of sons
[1:14:12] and
[1:14:14] daughters we are his sons we are his
[1:14:16] daughters he has given the spirit to cry
[1:14:19] out by
[1:14:20] father that we can go to him in
[1:14:22] confidence
[1:14:24] knowing that we are his children knowing
[1:14:26] that he brought you here for a purpose
[1:14:28] and he brought me here for a purpose let
[1:14:31] not your heart Fai amen don't let the
[1:14:34] enemy torment you with the fear of death
[1:14:36] and the fear of death no for me to live
[1:14:39] is Christ and to die is
[1:14:44] gain let no man's heart
[1:14:48] fail we are in a
[1:14:50] battle Israel fight physical battles
[1:14:54] and you and I will wrestle not against
[1:14:57] flesh and blood but against

[1:15:17] abounding in the work of the Lord for
[1:15:21] faithful he see that has called us and
[1:15:25] he will do it so let no man's heart

[1:20:28] about
[1:20:29] Israel and Israel must
[1:20:32] win and we should forget about all the
[1:20:36] stupid foolish things around us we want
[1:20:40] to see Jesus we want Christ to be
[1:20:44] glorified this purpose the purpose for
[1:20:46] this message s to us that it will be
[1:20:48] glorified that Christ will be seen again
[1:20:52] yes that the very God of William Branham
[1:20:54] the god that used William Branham will
[1:20:57] come again and work his will in
[1:21:00] us that that very Jesus that was seen in
[1:21:03] brother BR said this is the Jesus man
[1:21:07] they look and said that's the Jesus man
[1:21:09] they say as Jesus Christ walk on the
[1:21:12] streets of Nazareth he said we saw Jesus
[1:21:14] walking in a man called William Bram on
[1:21:17] the streets of je that in your

[1:21:43] Moses speaking to them when thou goest
[1:21:45] out to battle against thy enemies and
[1:21:49] see us
[1:21:51] OES and charot

[1:21:57] of them for the
[1:21:59] Lord thy God is with thee which brought
[1:22:05] thee up out of the land of
[1:22:08] Egypt the Lord thy God is with thee when
[1:22:12] you talk about God bringing them out of
[1:22:15] Egypt
[1:22:18] Paradox there's never be anything like
[1:22:21] that amen a nation to be pulled out of a
[1:22:24] Nation 2 million people
[1:22:27] plus where are they
[1:22:29] going what would they
[1:22:32] eat what would they eat what would they
[1:22:36] drink oh don't forget but the children
[1:22:40] of Israel they forgot all these
[1:22:42] things if they look into their lives
[1:22:45] alone they will see the miracle of God
[1:22:46] because how can you wear one dress for
[1:22:47] 40
[1:22:48] years how can you wear shoe for 40 years
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:53] so the miracle was right there with them

[1:22:59] them and they forgot all these things
[1:23:02] and they were
[1:23:04] complaining and sometimes we had the
[1:23:06] same
[1:23:07] way we easily forget what God has done

[1:23:37] complaining you know how God will be
[1:23:39] looking at
[1:23:41] you you know how God will be looking at
[1:23:43] you in a country like
[1:23:46] this the food that is wasted in this
[1:23:49] country can feed another Nation yes amen
[1:23:53] and you will see that and you'll be
[1:23:55] complaining you know how God will be
[1:23:56] looking at you amen because God

[1:24:00] else and see people this they don't have
[1:24:05] food to

[1:34:09] God he has given us
[1:34:12] faith faith in his word to hold on to
[1:34:16] his word to trust him amen and to cast
[1:34:20] our cares on him
[1:34:22] because he cares for
[1:34:25] us Israel in the days of
[1:34:29] David there was a
[1:34:32] crisis there was a golat they fought
[1:34:35] different different
[1:34:37] battles yeah even in the days of samel
[1:34:41] they were fighting Samuel was leading
[1:34:44] them until they choose a
[1:34:47] king and the purpose of choosing a king
[1:34:50] is that so that he will leave lead them
[1:34:51] to
[1:34:54] war to lead them to war now there is War
[1:34:58] the King was afraid so sometime what you
[1:35:01] think is good for you will not be good
[1:35:02] for you that's right that's
[1:35:07] true may God help us don't compromise
[1:35:10] for

[1:35:17] it out for peace have they have peace
[1:35:20] they've never had peace there
[1:35:23] so when you are compromising on God's
[1:35:25] word for peace you will never get peace
[1:35:28] you'll get more
[1:35:30] troubles oh we think this is good Jesus
[1:35:32] said oh Jerusalem Jerusalem if thou has
[1:35:36] not in this thy day the things that
[1:35:38] belong to thy
[1:35:41] peace we miss

[1:35:50] Amen
[1:35:54] amen Lord help
[1:35:57] us complete obedience to the word of God

[1:37:54] fail they choose a king and here was a
[1:37:59] king here was golad and the King could

[1:38:12] everybody was
[1:38:16] afraid but God is
[1:38:18] merciful for his name's sake amen for
[1:38:22] his name's sake he will do it yes he
[1:38:26] raised David amen for his name sake
[1:38:30] because golad was embarrassing the army
[1:38:33] of
[1:38:34] God David said because you have spoken
[1:38:36] against the army of God you spoken
[1:38:39] against
[1:38:42] Jehovah and I thank God God always has
[1:38:45] the
[1:38:47] answer he has the answer and he is the
[1:38:49] answer he's the the all in all David was
[1:38:53] sent by his father go and see how your
[1:38:56] brothers are
[1:38:58] doing the steps of the righteous are
[1:39:01] orded of the
[1:39:03] Lorden when Jesse was sending David to
[1:39:06] go if he had known that devid was go to
[1:39:09] fight he would not have allowed
[1:39:13] it when he was sending David to go and
[1:39:15] give food to his brothers if he knew
[1:39:17] that David would go and fight he would
[1:39:19] never have sent him because no father
[1:39:21] who made that
[1:39:23] mistake no father I can you send this
[1:39:25] little boy and then he's going to no no
[1:39:28] no no no he will not allow it if you
[1:39:30] know no no no no no so God kept it with
[1:39:35] himself because God already knew what
[1:39:37] was going to happen God knew that David
[1:39:39] is the answer God knew what David will
[1:39:42] be there and David would do oh
[1:39:44] Hallelujah he knows all about us and he
[1:39:47] says David and David goes there and he
[1:39:49] just as he got there comes the golat man
[1:39:53] with his big
[1:39:55] boast and David said what is
[1:39:57] that who is that that's and everybody
[1:40:00] ran away the men of Israel were so much
[1:40:04] afraid of golad just his voice and they
[1:40:07] begin to describe golad he has 12 14
[1:40:10] fingers or whatever six years is there
[1:40:13] and he has this elment and they were
[1:40:14] just they all the quote was about golad
[1:40:18] they quot his fingers the quot is this
[1:40:20] the qu his herment they quot and nobody
[1:40:22] quoted scripture
[1:40:25] amen nobody mentioned any verse in the
[1:40:30] Bible nobody remembered any quote of the
[1:40:34] Prophet they forgot all the prophet that
[1:40:37] has been and they were only quoting
[1:40:40] golad until even the king said this man
[1:40:44] is a man of war from his
[1:40:47] youth they forgot all that Jehovah have
[1:40:49] done they did not remember remember the

[1:41:00] forgot the Wonders and the Miracles in
[1:41:02] the wilderness they forgot the water
[1:41:05] coming out of the rock yes they forgot
[1:41:09] the manner that their fathers were
[1:41:11] eating that was the hand of Jehovah
[1:41:17] amen when we have crisis and challenges
[1:41:21] that is the time to remember God's
[1:41:24] promises they forgot and because they
[1:41:27] forgot that's why they were in that
[1:41:30] condition because they did not remember
[1:41:33] the rock that begotten them they lightly
[1:41:36] esteemed that
[1:41:39] rock but when David came there and he
[1:41:43] heard goolia speaking and he said who is
[1:41:45] that man he said hey brother we are in
[1:41:49] trouble he said for what
[1:41:51] no no no no his own Brothers came to him

[1:42:16] them to intimidate
[1:42:18] him he did not allow them to quench him
[1:42:21] down to water down what was boiling in
[1:42:24] him the Bible say he left them don't
[1:42:27] keep company with
[1:42:28] unbelievers anybody that will destroy
[1:42:31] your confidence in the word of God move

[1:42:37] hear people that will encourage me
[1:42:39] people that will tell me it will be well
[1:42:41] people that will tell me that God is

[1:43:08] man there was something in
[1:43:10] David he has met God yes at the backside
[1:43:14] of the desert he has had an experience
[1:43:18] and when a man has me God no no matter
[1:43:21] what you do no matter the opposition he
[1:43:23] will never be afraid because regardless
[1:43:26] of the opposition he know that God is
[1:43:29] there Moses made of position but he met
[1:43:33] God at the back side of the desert
[1:43:35] before he went

[1:43:46] rod in his hands what God did when the
[1:43:48] leprosy was on his hands he remember God

[1:51:27] God and they said we are well able to
[1:51:30] take the
[1:51:32] land and brothers and sisters we are
[1:51:34] well able to take the
[1:51:36] land David said this man God will
