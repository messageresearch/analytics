the Lord for that amen God bless our our visitor praise the Lord and um brother Eric it's so good to see you in God's house amen the place that we need to be amen God bless each and every one of you this morning good to see um brother Blair and his parents God bless you God bless you very much um brother Brandon said in the message the Samaritan Church age he said the heart purpose and the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing the very heart purpose the Eternal purpose of God was to take a bride of his own choosing so it's like we can't be the one who initiates the choice it's him that chooses so he sends a call out many are called but few are chosen so my question before we open in our scripture where do you think God is looking for in his choosing what's he going after what do you what what would you go after if you were choosing a mate for eternity I mean it's hard for us think about it it's hard for us that are married to go 80 years with our mate you know the difficulties that we have with one another just being trying to be honest so God is choosing someone for eternity so what is what's that main quality do you think he wants to have with her what's it's got to be a love relationship a love relationship and um I'm gonna ask sister Amanda to put this up on the board but uh it's going to take love to make a rapture and this this is really so fitting here because in the Statue of a perfect man uh it starts out with faith and it ends up with love and not just our love but the love of God and that's what we really need to exit out of here so when you see this sign I want you to be remember what we need to get really get out of here amen turn with me if you would to Philippians chapter 3. last Sunday we we spoke on pure love only and this Sunday we want to entitle this message to pursuit of perfect love the pursuit of perfect love it's not a gift we have to pursue after it here in the book of Philippians chapter 3 um Paul is expressing that he he was really something in the world and everything that he was so great in the in the religious world he had to give up to find Christ and even after he found Christ there was still something that he didn't have and so he he expresses it here in verse number 12. I want to begin reading with verse 12-14 not as though I have already attained either we're already perfect but I follow after if that I may apprehend for that which also I'm apprehended of Christ Jesus brother and I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do I'm forgetting those things which are behind and reaching forth unto those things which are before me I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for this precious word we thank you for the riches that are contained in it and we thank you for being in our lives for being in our heart for saving us and and reviewing yourself to us that you are the only way to get to heaven and Lord out of all the people of the world you've you've chosen just a few Lord we're part of that number we want to say thank you today with all of our hearts thank you for choosing us thank you for placing your word down deep in our hearts father we pray at this time Lord that your anointing would come not just on my lips and my heart but on the ears and the hearts of the people Lord that as they feed on the word as they receive the word may it become a living Oracle inside their lives father for we want to be ready in that day when you say come up hither we commit this service to you with every need that we have here in our midst representing for we ask these things in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen God bless you may be seated I just looked up in the uh the Greek what some of these words mean um and the word attained verse 12 not as though I've already attained that word attain means taken or gotten a hold of so it's not just you know handed to you you got to get a hold of it either we're already perfect now that means complete consummate in character consummate in character so that's the part that's missing we know that we've got the spirit of God we know we got him on the inside but there's still something in our lives when we're walking and going through trials that we we're not totally representing him and that's his character he says but I follow after now that word follow after it means to pursue to pursue it if that I may apprehend or take eagerly seize or possess that for which also I'm apprehended of Jesus Christ or Christ Jesus so we could read it just like this not as though I've already taken either or already made complete in character but I am in Pursuit if that I may take it eagerly or seize that for which I am possessed of Christ Jesus aren't you glad that Jesus bought you that uh that that you're in the palm of his hands that that that he has you he he owns you amen and and Paul wanted to have that same thing of God he wanted to pursue that same part and have him the way that Christ has him now he says brother I can't not myself to have apprehended I want you to know my attitude I'm not walking around as if I got what it takes to make it but there's one thing I do I'm forgetting those things which were behind but now he's not really talking about our past sins no he's talking about the things that he has apprehended right the part of Christ that he does have if you st if you keep dwelling on what you do have you're never going to be reaching for more because you're always going to feel it's enough but we need to forget what we do have and realize that there's more for the bride to reach forth for those things which are before and he says I press or pursue it's the same word used in two different verses toward the goal for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus so I believe the bride today is in Pursuit of the part of Christ that they need to make a rapture first John chapter 4 verse 16. now I want to encourage you to really get into the word because there's a lot here and won't be able to spend a lot of time on each one but uh I believe very much God is in this message today amen first John chapter 4 verse 16 and we have known and believe the love of that God have to us God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelt in God and God in him and here in is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment you know my people are scared about the day of judgment that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world in other words we don't have to wait to get to heaven to have his character it's something you know when you know that you have done what you've been asked to do you can have boldness I did exactly what you asked me to do and when we do exactly what God wants us to do we can have boldness on the day of judgment we don't have to fear there's no fear in love but perfect love casts out fear because fear of torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love there's no greater power than perfect love it will cast out all fear think about Jesus when he feared going to the cross I'll say it like this when when fear was trying to attack him and he kept praying on his knees Lord if his father if it's possible let this cup pass from me I my I don't want to go through with this so he was dealing with fear and we all deal with it but you know for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross it was perfect love that cast that aside and he was able to walk up there for you and I verse 19 we love him because he first loved us If any man say I love God it doesn't feel the same way about his brother he is a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he have seen how can he love God whom we have not seen so and this is what's really hard with the scripture you know we feel that we love God no matter who we hate no matter what problems we have with anybody we feel we love God and that's our feelings that's our feelings because the word says it can't be and if you get so full of hatred because of somebody I can guarantee this the holy spirit's just going to take his flight and he's going to go wait do you repent get that before he comes back on you Brandon said in the message that God had explained he says and I pray father that from my heart that thou will let me expressed to my brethren this morning the motive and the objective of my life to you that they might understand granted that we might have perfect love fellowship and cooperation in all the working of the gospel for we ask it in Jesus name who pray that we might be one as he and his father was one believing this that this will all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for another amen what a beautiful prayer I believe that the bride of Christ will have perfect love they won't only be in perfect love one for another of the Bride but they will just have perfect love that's what really separates them because anybody can love them that think their bride right but can you love like Jesus loves everyone when we are in pursuit of perfect love we're really in pursuit of being one with God one with his word and so when we're in pursuit of being one with God we're really should be in pursuit of perfect love for God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him brother Brandon said the Tolkien was the highlight of his message he said about the seals when he went through the seals that the Bible became a new book and when he went beyond the curtain of time he said he became a new man he wasn't the same brother ran him over and this is what he said in the rejected King he says if I could make up yonder 100 billion miles high a square block and that's perfect love each step this way it Narrows and narrows until it gets down to where we are now it would be just merely a shadow of corruption that little something that we can sense and feel that there is something somewhere we don't know what it is one billion miles now he's talking about as you get closer to God there becomes less of us and more of him lesser carnality less of hatred lesser and it now he talks about this pyramid not being a short one but a tall one a hundred million you know that's further than it is from the Earth to the Sun think about a pyramid that far and you have to walk up each step I'll tell you that that's all that's a that's a long pressing he says oh my precious friends my beloved he even says my darlings of the Gospel my begotten children of God he said listen to me your pastor you I wish there was somewhere I could explain it to you there's no words I couldn't find it it's not found anywhere but just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing uh that you've ever there's no way to explain it there's just no way I just can't do it but whatever you do friends lay aside everything else to you get perfect love get to the spot that you could just love everybody every enemy and everything else you know he says that one visit there to me has made me a different man I can never never never be the same brother Branham that I was whatever you do friends lay everything aside to get perfect love in other words pursue it pursue perfect love but the brown never said whatever you do make sure you get all the correct Doctrine or make sure you do all these Works he never even said make sure you get perfect faith no we do need I was going going for the set you a perfect man but it's not up there it starts with faith on the bottom and you need Faith to get where you're going right amen but he said get perfect love because perfect love is what produces perfect Faith now I'm going to read this in the message perfect Faith he says now notice perfect faith is the master of all circumstances and you think about the needs uh we all we all have need of something in our lives I've been praying that God would move in for healing in our church amen that perfect Faith Masters all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it now just watch when you believe for anything do anything you you got to have faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances is that don't make one thing to do with it see it Masters the circumstance if it's in a room of sickness and the Lord reveal that certain things going to happen you just speak it and go on see he says if you're in a room of sickness and the Lord has revealed to you that he's going to do something but you that you need God to reveal it and and where we come into play there is hungering God reveals speak to me I need this for my my body that's the part we play so God moves with compassion upon us he says don't just ask any question it's already over he said just keep going it Masters all circumstances Faith believes that God uh will work it out I don't know how he's going to do it but he's going to do it see it Masters the circumstances and faith and love is relation he said faith and love is relation because you can't have faith unless you've got love because your faith is in a God Who is the very essence of love faith and love works together he went under saying when we Sinners alienated without God and in the world and the muck of the mud as I talked about this morning come to us God sought you you never saw God no man can come to me except the father draws them first and God came down in that mock that where you were and sought you out and he brought you out and he said this is what I want to get to he says that ought to create a perfect love you should feel in debt to what he's done for you look what you was and look what you are what did what did that somebody that loved you can't you have faith in what he promised you then real genuine love will create confidence in his word he caught me when I was nothing I'm still nothing but I'm in his hands see he caught me and he loved me when I was unlovable he loved you when you were unlovable but he changed you just like the colored sister said that time in her testimony he said I'm not what I ought to be I'm not what I want to be but I'm not what I used to be she knew she had come somewhere something happened and that's what it is if God when I was alienated from he so loved me too he stooped down to get me and pick me up that gives me confidence that he wants to use me he's got a purpose in doing so he has something in uh he's seen something in me and he's seen something in you and he had a reason to save you look at the people that's unsaved today look at the millions he could have took you he could have put beside you but he took you one out of a million no man can take your place amen you're in God's economy no one can do it he he that's his love to you now that won't that won't Your Love he says then won't Your Love reach back to him and there is a love affair no matter what the situation is circumstances it's governed by this love that creates faith that God loves you and you love God you love one another and that brings the faith all right then it can't keep you from uh bringing out just exactly what God promised it would do Caesar watch Pure faith I'm sorry perfect faith is pure just as uh pure as love is so I say brother Brandon knew what he was saying when he said the most important thing to God's heart was perfect love and he told us to go after it so don't go after the other things go after perfect love we just can't bypass it it's what we need to be raptured don't try to get raptured without perfect love it won't happen don't just go after the faith or go after the quotes or or this that or the other pursue a relationship with God that is perfectly in love with him now perfect love is attainable we have Jesus telling us in Matthew 5 to be perfect towards all them uh that that oppose you just like uh his heavenly father does we have John telling us in our opening scripture that as Jesus is so are we in this world and and that's what will give us boldness on the day of judgment we also have the prophet in this last age telling us to get to the spot to where we can love everyone and he wouldn't be telling us to do something if we couldn't do it so we must believe that perfect love is attainable in our personal lives brother Branham told us even the importance that we need to lay everything else aside until we get it now we've read these quotes before we've gone through these and you know these but I think it's something that we don't take real serious we haven't taken real serious brother Brown said in the message the adoption he says thus saith the Lord it'll take perfect love to put you in that place it will take perfect love to put you in that place now here's the thing the devil has got so many people thinking somehow when I die I just have perfect love I mean that's the way I used to think when I was in the denominations that is the way I used to think before I came to the truth but get rid of that thought because if you hold on to that thought you won't press towards anything why do I need to press towards it if it's already going to happen when I die it just don't line up with the scriptures that don't dovetail for that's all there was there he says no matter what money how religious demonstrations how many Good Deeds you've done or whatever you've done that won't count for nothing on that day he says it'll take perfect love so now he's mentioning all the things that we do on this planet before we go and he says that won't mean nothing on that day to get there but you need perfect love all these things are pointing towards us to getting perfect love on this side so whatever you do lay aside everything else until you are just so filled with the love of God to you can love those who hate you you know our Pursuit you know we spend time trying to get away from certain people that make us feel uncomfortable parents when the prophet's telling us get to a place where we can love them it's just like are we going to listen to our spirit are we going to listen to God's spirit man you will come to me in that day this is me this ain't the quote Jesus said many will come to me in that day and say Lord Lord didn't we do this that and the other but what was really missing it was a love relationship because iniquity was there iniquity was not doing the things I asked you to do that's what was really missing they didn't think they needed to do everything that Jesus had asked so he's really looking in that love affair for someone that just will love him completely God is not having relationships with those that use that want to use them he's having relationships with those who love him enough to follow the word I've had a quite a few people in my life use me and I can tell you right now that I can't say that they were I had close relationships with them the very fact that you're being used really shows what kind of relationship that is right you would never ever use somebody you loved right right but see many people want something from God look at the Rich Young Ruler before he went over acroston he wanted eternal life after he he died and was there and he couldn't cross over he still had a desire to see his own family saved nobody wants to go to hell right nobody but that doesn't mean everybody wants to love God see the difference it's not about I don't want to go to hell and it's not about I want to go to heaven what it's about is I loving God completely to pursue a perfect love because that's what it takes to get there I want to finish this quote now he says just as I in adoption for just as I was said this morning my whole makeup is Grace a lot of people say no you scratch my back and I'll scratch yours yeah you do something for me and I'll do something for you brother Brandon said that's not Grace Grace as if if your back is itching I'll scratch it anyhow whether you scratch mine or not uh you can slap me on the face and say my back is itching it needs scratching and I'll scratch it right he said that's it do something I don't believe in works I believe that works is love works is the manifestation that Grace has taken place when brother Brian said do something he's meaning do something for somebody unconditionally don't worry about what you're going to get out of it if you're always worried about what you're getting out of it you're so far from perfect love it's you got that selfish love you're dealing with love those who use you love those who don't want to help you I won't say can't help you but don't want to help you true love is not using someone to get what you want it's not even sharing the responsibilities to get what you want in other words you scratch my back I'll scratch mine you scratch mine it's not a win-win situation true love is living for others that's it living for others you don't get nothing out of it now how many people really exercise this how many people are actually in pursuit of it how many people even spend time this is important to me I mean when we're all alone I don't mean when we're being reminded about it from buying the pulpit but but when we're at home and we're we're doing the things we're doing we're we're living the life we're going to work we're doing the thing how many people are actually trying to exercise this but the Brandon said in the message beyond the curtain of time he says whatever you do lay aside everything else until you get perfect love get to where you can love everybody even your enemy he says no he says the statement here says now no matter if the plane is rocking the lightning is flashing The Guns of the enemy are upon you these things do not matter does it really matter the bombs are going to fall the economy is going to fall people are going to be after you even The Guns of the enemy are upon you he said this doesn't matter in other words you have no excuse this is not an excuse God won't accept our excuses go get perfect love pursue perfect love put it in your heart that this is important because we naturally through the process of the devil's Ministry to us constantly it's not a very important topic to pursue right and of course the first thing he wants to do is try to get every think that they just they they just have it if they don't they're going to get it and both of those you don't have to pursue so I could just start pursuing other things and and that's that's how we get caught up in laodicea I say too many too many believers who know the truth have too many excuses for why they're not pursuing it now brother Brahm is showing us what Paul really meant about pressing towards the mark and the rest of this quote he says if you're not saved except Jesus Christ as your savior now he says if you've not been baptized in water be baptized now if you have not received the baptism of the Holy Spirit receive it now and then he says Press On to that perfect love which will take you to that beautiful and joyful place beyond the curtain of time so what's going to take it take you there perfect love how do I know I got it brother John would you just love everybody unconditionally well I just I don't know inside you know pursue it pursue it then don't just accept that this is just the way it is and just the way it's always been pursue it pursue more than what you got you you you you've been you repented that's great you yeah you've been baptized that's great you you got Sanctified that's great you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's that's great now pursue it get to the place of completion let it be important to you why why does it need to be important to you just remember this God is choosing his bride if I could say it like this you're not in on the vote who he's choosing only thing you can do is present yourself to him in a way that he would choose you that's all you can do so I'll say if it's important to God to have perfect love and let it be important to you because you know you can just preach predestination and believe pray destination to your just blue in the face and never have perfect love what good will that do to believe in the right Doctrine but not teach if you're predestined you will have perfect love right what takes us to that joyful Place perfect love the spirit of laodicea has caused too many too many Believers to take their foot off the gas just kind of coal steam I'm in the message I'm the bride I'm predestinated just coasting no pursuing no pressing towards the mark I've already attained you don't need to see very many believers to to realize that there's hardly any talk about getting perfect love it's not in conversations there's no there's no provoking there's no I need to get more serious about it God's been dealing with me about perfect love it isn't part of the conversation is something that's is distant and here uh the wave Chief in our age went beyond the curtain of time and all his great experience his conclusion was whatever you do go get it and why it ain't a part of our lives our conversations our homes our families we we rather spend time acting like we got it then making excuses of why it didn't work it's very low interest it's sad we don't got time but you could write it down Philippians 3 15 through 20. it's our own interest and our own desires that's taken us away from that the religious group of this age they feel very strongly that they don't need anything else than what they got that's why it's so hard to to keep staring at well this is what I've achieved this is where I am I'm a real good person I do this I've done this and it's always about what we've attained Revelation 3 14 unto the angel of the church allowed to see is right these things saith the amen the faithful the true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold or hot I would you were one or the other that's right just two sides be like me I'm choosing a bride I know what I'm going after he says you two sides didn't brother Brandon say if you're if you're if you're if you don't want God you must just go live the life for yourself as good as you can because this is the only life you got right so then because Thou Art lukewarm you're neither not all in or all out I will spew thee out of my mouth because your heart is speaking I'm rich now that don't necessarily have to be money I'm just I'm rich and knowledge and God and and this message and I'm rich and everything that I got and increased with Goods well we have more Goods in this this time of our life for the most part than in any other age and any other time and have need of you not telling me what to do I don't need that I got yeah you got it that's why you're not pressing right here it's a spirit of this age and not even here's there's people that are in the message they think they're where they need to be and don't even realize it that they're caught up in laodicea oh no I believe with that Minister says you know we're Beyond laodice here we're in the eagle age well the bride might be The Pride might be but that doesn't mean everybody who's claiming to be in the message is there I just believe that there's something that the bride has in connection that Paul had and it's that attitude of I don't have what everything that I need I am going to press and press and press towards it I think it's important to understand what the goal is the goal is not to be saved the goal is to be chosen to be his bride and and to sit here and just have the thoughts that well I am Chosen and I believe it well that's good but now hold yourself accountable are you at that place that the prophet told you to get to are you at that place the prophet told you to get to or do you kind of stay away from people that bother you because you don't want to have to deal with it come on now this this this is Eagle food this is this is not for for people who are not serious about being chosen to go on a rapture he says and know us not you're wretched you're miserable you're poor you're blind you're naked in other words the way that you're viewing your own self you can't see it you can't see straight so he says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Remnant that that may as be clothed with in the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and an anoint thine eyes with with I said that thou mayest see Jesus is telling them to buy of himself to buy deity to buy to buy without money to buy without price to buy it with a love affair to give yourself that God gives himself to you to seek the Holy Spirit to seek his life to seek perfect love that's what he is counseling and he and he's saying you got to repent because uh an attitude of I I'm I'm of attained to where I need to be and I don't need really to press anything more that's the thing you got to repent of because that's that's the devil that's the same Spirit the devil had when he left heaven I don't need God anymore I can be my own and he got a whole bunch of people on the bandwagon in fact every one of us were born with that nature at one time remember the wise virgins said to the foolish virgins he said don't ask me to give you God oil the Holy Ghost because if I give any to you I won't have enough to make it but what was his advice the same as God go go to him that selleth and he'll give it to you pursue it from them but remember their attitude was I had enough because they all had oil to start with but their lamps went out and they didn't they didn't pursue more they didn't go on to get filled up There's an actual place of perfect love it's not a geographic place it's a holographic place and I'm allowed to make up my own words this is America this place is in Christ the word the Bible says who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected so this place we want to get to is to keep the word that word right is to love where we're not loving it's not to focus on the word we are keeping it's not to focus on the love that we are loving as long as we do that we won't press the place in Christ is a love relationship with God's word it's not our feelings and our emotions about God it's what God's word says fall in love with the word because our feelings all of our feelings say I love you God right we can agree with that I love you God my feelings my emotions say God you've done so much for me but if you love me keep my word keep my Commandments that's the focus so we need to abide in the word stay connected to the vine be fruitful in What In Your Love relationship be fruitful in the love relationship with God Psalms 91 verse 1 just talked about that place before we pursue it laying along Foundation you know how I am Psalms 91 verse 1 says he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty so there's telling us that there is a place I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress and my God in him will I trust surely he will deliver me drop down to 14. because he have set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him what part do we play setting our affections on things that are above setting our affection on God we want Deliverance set your affections on God Amen amen verse 9 because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation this place the word there shall no evil befall thee no wonder he gives great peace to those whose mind is stayed on the Lord right God ain't gonna let him God is peace God don't get shook up right he's not All Shook Up he's he's a God of Peace he is peace he is our peace so when we're dwelling in that place of perfect love there's nothing to fear no matter what happens to us pursuing perfect love the first step to pursuing perfect love brother Branham told us is laying aside all the other things that's important to us that's the number one thing we have to do if you want to pursue perfect love this step may seem the hardest But as God spoke to brother random it is the correct and precise choice it requires us to forsake our time time that we think is more important on other things and that's why we're there so your time is what you need to free up in order to pursue perfect love that's why you got to lay it aside lay everything aside start analyzing it requires us to forsake all that's hindering us from getting to that actual place what's hindering you it requires us to forsake whatever we love whoever we love including ourselves right that includes ourselves we must Jesus said we must forsake all whosoever loveth father mother more than me is not worthy of me we must deny ourselves we must deny our will for the things that we're pursuing it's our will that's making us pursue the things that we're pursuing now don't you know it's the devil's job to get your life so confused so wound up so busy that the only thing you got time to do is rescue yourself imagine there was no cell phones how many times you walk into a room and you see someone your loved one on the cell phone and you say what would you do if there was no cell phones we go out to eat four of us at the table we all got our cell phone down Satan has done a good job getting our mind distracted on other things I'll say what we need to do is Lay start laying stuff aside I am telling you if you do not lay aside everything you will never ever ever get perfect love to get all of him he's choosing someone who wants him more than anything else oh brother John I want God so do you and six other billion people but do you want him more than anything else in your life Hebrews 12 verse 1 says wherefore seeing we also are compassionate about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight now that word weight means hindrance lay aside every hindrance you know the greatest thing is the devil he doesn't want to he doesn't want you to see what's hindering you in other words the things that are hindering you that you have chosen to do in your life the devil's told you you need to do those but I tell you I don't think the god of Heaven would ever want me to do something that I would put before him now he may have given it to you but that doesn't mean you've got the character to put it in his place you know what I'm saying there just because he gave it to you just because he blessed you with it it doesn't mean it goes before God put it in its place put God first and put the other thing behind so lay us out every weight every hinder is in the Sin which does so easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that set before us amen we're in a race we need to be pursuing right the first step of perfect love is laying aside everything that's important to you brother random said don't make excuses no matter if the planes are rocking the lightning is flashing The Guns of the enemy are upon you don't let any excuse stop you from laying everything aside you know the thing I hear when I try to help people get closer to God I hear excuses and and sometimes if you press oh what comes out is not perfect love come on you know when you're trying to help your children you try to get your children in line and you start just look this is really important and they lash out at you come on are you with me now don't get too quiet we're having Church it's a reality yes and the Holy Spirit is here and he wants us to pursue perfect love not occasionally not when you can fill it in I know what it means to juggle things this is not juggled in this means put down all the balls and start seeking perfect love just the one get to the place where you've been tried and you know you can love everybody come on not after uh 16 days or 16 hours of thinking about it and staying away from them that you think you can do it now no but when you're in the heat of the battle you know you can't be moved no matter what they do to you you can't be moved you love them because you're dwelling in that place I may not be able to preacher right but I know the preacher's here now after you've committed to laying everything else aside simply exercise your love for God just exercise it if you're serious about getting perfect love you get there by simply loving God more and more and more we want to keep it simple God is hid in simplicity you you know when you've had a a problem with your mate or a a family member sister brother a child um you know what keeps people separated stubbornness Pride and you got to lay that thing aside and you got to be the bigger person to reach out and love them so I'll just say it like this just love love God love God find ways to love God it isn't just church attendance if we're pursuing the complete love of God it's going to require now listen to this it's going to require us learning how to love God more doing something that we're not doing now you just can't you can't lay everything else aside and sit there and go like this like a monk the laying the stuff aside is opening your time up but after your time has been opened up now you can start to pursue getting more of God we may think he's first in our lives because the devil is always telling us a lie right but ours are deceptive and we really need to ask God God are you first in my heart search me I remember when I got baptized I thought God was first in my life no I got baptized and I did the first step but there were many things the Holy Spirit wanted to say to me but you know what I couldn't bear it now and then I learned there was more things then I had to give up my records and I had to give up worldly and I I mean I when I got baptized my hair was long then I had to cut my hair and I I thought you were first God no there's more things in our lives and the more we could just get real with God that love affair God surely there must be more because if if there was no more I would be able to just love anybody my my feathers wouldn't get all ruffled when something happened to me just it's just being an honest relationship Jeremiah 29 13 says and ye shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart and I will be found if you saith the Lord God wants to show himself to us putting God first may seem to be hard and difficult but just keep it simple remember love perfect love requires perfect obedience so the more you want to love God the more you have to obey them so perfect love requires us to pick up our cross and follow him you're pursuing perfect love now you're pursuant of God I want I want perfect love I want to get to that place where I can love it pick up your cross it requires it it's not a separate topic we can make it a separate topic we can preach on it separate but it's part of getting it we've got to pick up God's complete will and his complete will is picking up our cross doing all the things that we thought at one time were just optional I didn't know it was that important optional no perfect love it's not optional man shall live by every word of God Romans 12 verse 1 I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present yourself that's right amen a Living Sacrifice now if you presented yourself a dead sacrifice after you died you couldn't do anything right but a Living Sacrifice you're dead to yourself and now you're alive doing everything God wants you to do holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable it's the least thing you could do for God brother Brandon said the power of transformation he says you know what conform is be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your night mind renewing of your mind the things that you once thought upon to be precious lay that aside and be transformed to something else what you was one time to what you are now yes so we're in that process of transformation we haven't attained now we've transformed in certain things but not all things and the goal is to to pursue it to run after it to hunger to thirst to to make it a point to make it part of your conversation part of your prayer part of what you what you're working on through the course of the day and not just something where we we learn about at a church from time to time we hear Brother Brian talk about it in a message from time to time but because of my selective hearing when I listen to the tapes I'm only hearing what I want to hear Lord help us so now that we have extra time because we've laid everything else aside spend time actually pursuing complete love not just seeking God for this that and the other we're good at that we don't even have to be taught that I want God to do this and this and I need God for this and this how about spend some time seeking God for what he wants you to have seek ye first the kingdom of God well I'll tell you when we get there but brother Brandon when he went and saw the kingdom of God he said there was nothing there but perfect love that's what he witnessed with his eyes the kingdom of God so if we seek perfect love well the only way I can get is perfectly obey that word to love the word I'm not I'm not making loving God different than obeying the word they're one in the same but the thing is you know we say we love God and don't obey the word which is we don't love one don't love our enemy how's that we kind of pick and choose who our favorites are look we all need it we all need there ain't one person in here that don't need more of the perfect love of God not one but you know I believe that God is going to choose those who lay everything else aside and go get perfect love I don't believe brother Brandon went beyond the current time came back with the fruit of the promised land told us something and then it not be important for us to make it right do you understand Joshua Caleb they came back with the report those that believed the report which the majority did not remember that the majority don't even talk about getting perfect love they just feel that somehow it's going to happen I'm just being honest with you how many preachers do you hear preaching that you need to get perfect love you just don't hear it it's it's not a main subject but it seemed to be important enough to brother random that he preached it throughout the his his message after went down the curtain of time I say it like this to the point I think you and I should be pursuing it I don't think it should be a topic that we just talk about once in a while I think it should be on the Forefront these other things that we're talking about let them be here and there but let's let our goal be let's go for perfect love let's let's get to the place let's hear some testimonies I got hit in the face and you know what I turned the cheek and loved him and there was no ill feeling inside of me no ill thoughts about him when I left their presence no God I wish you were just a heart Lord forgive them they know not what they're doing go after it Sue it I believe the bride will have it I'm not worried about any of us having the correct Doctrine you could know all the Mysteries you could have all Faith you could give your body to be burned but I'll tell you what give your life for Jesus Christ that's another story so it's not just given of yourself for what you think is right give yourself to God for God because we're created for his glory we're created for his honor are you with me all right press to pursue the goal of perfect love that's his character inside of you reach out for more sincerity reach out to become more serious about the things of God for the doing the complete will of God I'll say pray pray brother Ben says you can't pray too much we're talking about how to pursue perfect love read the word and fall more in love with the word don't use the word just for guidance of your life read the word for the heart of God this is God's heart this is God's love letter this is the this is how to get to that place on the other side so read it with Lord help me to fall in love with what I read when you read and pray and listen to the message of the hour be purposeful for this purpose pursuing perfect love let that be your motive not why I want to listen to a tape I need to listen to a tape no be purposeful I'm going after perfect love when I put this tape on I'm going to open the book because I want to have perfect love I want to manifest it get down on my knees God when I get up I want to be more like you be purposeful to be able to love like God loves amen it's the High Calling it's what he's calling us to seek perfect love now when you do this with your heart what you're doing is actually training you're going through training this is can can I have some time kind of a little bit longer service today when you're doing this you're now in training but everybody that goes through training has to take a final exam right you go to school you you read the books you study and then you take an exam and you know we take exams and sometimes they're pop quizzes somebody just comes up to you and just really nice you just says something that gets under your skin that they just kind of on the side make you feel like what's under their feet you know what I'm talking about and that's your test now is your test to see if all your been pursuing you're you know what that test is for is to see how much you did lay aside that's what the test is for is to see how much you laid aside to get what you need for that moment did you get deity did you get the goal that was tried in the fire because Jesus stood in that fire and he said father forgive him when he was on the cross so when it happens to you it's at that time that you got to know that you could turn the cheek but you can say good things to others you know and here's the thing you know in your your heart and mine whether you're thinking you had a negative thought towards that person you know it and brother Brian I'm saying just get to the place where you can love now a thought can come and if it bounces off your head that's that's okay because the devil's allowed to do that but if that thing comes and said well let's think about this you know you're a five second thinker you're in trouble you better learn to try the spirit a much quicker than that remember character is not a gift hello gifts and coins are without repentance God just threw them out there but you know what character is not that way he don't throw character out and he don't throw perfect love out you get that just how you get character it's in the middle of the trial so when you're in the middle of the trial this is the time that you can really manifest perfect love to be an expression of God In the Flesh again now you can't just go up to anybody you want to and go heal them it may not be God's will but did you know you can always have the love of God in your heart to display the character of Jesus Christ when you need it see most people think the love of God is just when you cannot face any trial and get along with somebody like I'm just friends with everybody I just love everybody but you know what just take that thing off the plate that don't have nothing to do with it the prophet taught us and Jesus himself taught us to be like his father which is in heaven get to that place get there get there that means I'm not there if I'm going to get there pursue it get to that place where I love the person that's using me in other words if it's not them using me it's just going to be somebody else and if they're not use me it's just going to be somebody somebody is going to use you you're going to get persecuted if you live Godly in Christ Jesus you will be tested you do have an exam coming amen but you got to pass it and if you're hungry you're thirsty if it means life to you and during your time that you're not taking the exam is when you'll really get serious with God because you can't stop the exam from coming it's coming and you know some of us take a lot of exams but you know God God's showing us we really need to get ready he's not choosing someone that's half ready he's coming for a bride without spot or without wrinkle now look I don't care what mistakes you've made I don't care how much you've Fallen because there's none righteous no not one but get to the place where you're not perfect and you don't make a mistake get to the place where you can love everyone now I'm telling I am just preaching the message that's all I'm doing I don't it's not a new message I'm just preaching the message get to that place pursue it perfect love not a gift it's a victory it's it's you paid the price you know the right way to act you know the right right way to respond you know the right way to think the love of God thinketh no ill to his neighbor get to the place where it don't exist well brother John you're asking for a lot I'm just quoting what the prophet said I'm just preaching the word what the word says it's it's no different it just happens to be important and not too many want to preach it right it's easier to preach other things it really is what did Jesus mean when he said when you when somebody Smite you on the face turn the cheek only perfect love does that only perfect love does that because if somebody hits me on the face the first thing I'm going to think is who Do You Think You Are right who are you to hit me yeah what right and then the next thought I'm going to have brother Larry is what what in the world did I do wrong to deserve that and that has nothing at all to do with anything it's not the action It's the reaction are you gonna are you gonna turn that cheek I know you're just gonna I mean you turn it you only turn it for one reason you don't oh God I hate getting hit no you you turn that cheek because you know it wasn't them who hurt you because if they knew you were the bride of Jesus Christ they would never ever hurt you never the only one that would do it would be the devil in his angels and his anointings and his spirits that get on people they are the ones that have no respect for God or his people that's why you can't you can't have the love of God and be disrespectful to somebody you just can't those of you that have a hard time with respect you need to pursue respect that might be a way to help you understand pursuing love perfect love you I had a Methodist brother I'll tell you 25 30 years ago tell me he said respect will take you a long way in life and I'll tell you perfect love will take you a long way in life you know you can be a good people person and not have the love of God instead of trying to be a friend to everybody go to the people that you got a problem with take more exams and help yourself realize that we should be in pursuit of the same thing Paul was the same thing the same thing that brother Brandon says that I'm not going to be able to get to all this so just so you know I love you anyways now brother Brian said this in Churchill now he said it in church order but listen what he said here he says if you can't disagree with a man and things and then shake his hands and still have what the same feeling now a lot of people fake it they hide the feelings and they fake it he says and still have the same feelings towards him then there's something wrong with you if you can't disagree with a man bitterly from one side to the other and still think as much of him as Christ would then there's something wrong with your spirit think about that so when we're right in the middle of a serious opposition we always have a choice to make usually when you got a problem with somebody you're you're choosing to fight or argue or defend ourselves or prove somebody else is wrong or ignore the person for a while because you're done with them or or or or hold your love for somebody else that you think's more worthy of now that's usually what happens when we're in the middle of our problems but don't pursue that carnal thinking anymore don't pursue that pursue perfect love this is your chance to have Christ manifested inside of you you're right there with your enemy but Christ is right there with you if he prepares a table before you in the presence of his enemies don't you think Christ in you can create such a faith and confidence that you don't have to fear the opposition this person you know this person has spoken ill of you and it might have been 10 years ago five years ago three years ago two years ago one week ago but you know something about this when the devil and that could have been made right but you know the thing is the devil don't let you forget it and that's what he uses as evidence when he comes to your mind but so when even there's no conflict with somebody but a thought comes to your head about somebody don't choose to be carnal choose to love them God I know you love them I pray you love them through me love them through Me Lord in fact until I see them I'm going to get down on my knees right now and pray for him maybe I'm going to text him maybe I'm going to call them because I just want to love them you know this thing of I got such a private relationship with God that doesn't have anything to do with the help in the body is really not what you think it is I think we need to we need to do some evaluation I I want to have boldness on the day of judgment as he is so are we now in this world I want to get to that place I want to lay everything aside so when you're in the middle of the trials choose the harder way choose the hard way right then afterwards it's hindsight's 2020. and it's one thing to say beforehand oh yeah yeah I'll have perfect love before the rapture but when you're in the middle of the trial choose the harder way God told brother Brandon he said this this decision this in itself is that which will bring to pass that tremendous victory in love divine that's how important your decision is so what we're just think about you know perfect love oh man it needs to be tested we want perfect love but we don't want the trials right it's like we want patience but we don't want the trial now we don't have time but I want you if you read James four this is a homework James 4 1-12 you will see how to manifest perfect love because the problem is starting inside right it's me that's keeping me from loving somebody perfect it isn't it isn't the person who's doing me harm but he goes on to talk about that he gives grace to the humble and just submit yourself to God and that's how you love perfect we need to be more concerned about getting perfect love because nothing else but perfect love will enter in there brother Brandon said in the message convinced and then concerned he says if we believe of the coming Messiahs at hand We Believe The Rapture is at hand he says I think we ought to lay everything else aside and be concerned about getting the message in the lands Yonder as fast as you can do it that's right I believe the Messiah is coming I would support a missionary program that would sweep around the country right quick and get a church ready for him I would do it therefore I am convinced that the Messiah is coming soon and I'm concerned about getting the gospel everywhere that I can that it can be gotten he said I am interested in a missionary program no if I was going to preach this message in an hour but you know I didn't because we're past an hour but if I was going to preach this message in an hour about 7 500 people would have died during the time of the message of course now it's more that's about 125 people a minute over 65 million people die every year in the world that's around one thousand no that's around 178 000 every day I wonder how many of those people are dying without Christ I just wonder who's got the vision who's laying even time the side to go help somebody you can't get away from the facts of the people that are dying the way the tree falls that's the way it lies God will use anybody that places them into his hand even though it took 100 lots to make an Abraham he would use lot who if all you're going to give him is a penny he'll use it I'm just going to try to finish it up here with some quotes if I can do that he said in the message testimony he says and you Christians don't stay in that lukewarm condition anymore lay aside everything just get as close to God as you can walk with him talk with him let everything else be secondary but your prayer life stay right with him at all times in the Healer Jerry's daughter brother Brandon says and every man that really feels the tug of the holy spirit will lay aside everything else and run to him if you really get to needing it bad enough it becomes between life and death you'll move no matter what anybody says that's right he must get to Jesus it's between life and death he must find him right quick brother Brandon was speaking of this when he's talking about the Believers up in Canada in the church in its condition he says and so they're very loyal to go to church no matter how cold it is outside they're wrapped up in a blanket and sit on the bobsled and drive the horse for 30 miles to get to go to church they'll walk through the snow drifts and everything else young and old they're all grouped together and one family gets the other family and they start walking and there they go it's the sacrifice that they make is what causes them to get so much out of the service I want to get more out of the service you just heard what you need to do he said where when there's no sacrifice there's not much to the service you have to really get down and do something that hurts you real bad you have to lay aside some things and and stop the work and do this and do that and get to the church and show God that you love them and you make a sacrifice to go it's then when you get something brother Brandon said how can I overcome he said there's a reward for the Overcomers press on Lily he says it's in you if it's he said if it's in you lay aside the mud and everything else and press towards the top to sit and he's quoting Jesus to sit with me on the throne press towards the top to sit with me brother Brandon said in the message beyond the curtain of time he said then a voice spoke to me now listen with the voice said this is what you preached that the Holy Ghost is this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it and a quote that's what brother Ram said the voice spoke to him how many times have you heard a preacher say that perfect love is the Holy Ghost or the Holy Ghost his perfect love now this is what the voice spoke there's got to be a connection there's got to be a connection nothing can enter here without it well three two more quotes and one more scripture thank you for bearing with me Jesus spoke in Luke 13 verse 23 he said uh one said to him ask him a question Lord are there few that be saved and he said unto them strive to enter into that straight gate for many I'll say unto you will seek to enter in and shall not be able millions and millions of people are going to seek to enter into heaven without getting perfect love so it's like they're spending this effort wanting God but not willing to pay the price in in the message in The Invisible Union of the bride of Christ now this message he spoke to let's say about two and a half weeks after he spoke this message he's he preached his last message so this is right at the end before he leaves the invisible Union of the bride of Christ he says the bride knows where she stands she is very few he said there won't be many saved just a very very very few you say well there's they said there'd be thousands yes but they've come up to 2 000 years two on every age when it comes out see so in this age in this age there's going to be very few not very few but very very very few because it's the hardest age to attain before all the other ages they only needed so much this age we've got to get perfect love in the last quote from that time brother Brandon says I've been more determined to do everything I can to persuade men and women please be sure of this if God's love doesn't anchor in your heart supremely don't you take any sensation or motion you be sure that you can turn the other cheek that Christ is all and all to you don't miss it my brother now just remember I say this with the faith that I have in that Vision whatever it was I'll speak it in the name of the Lord except you have perfect love you'll never be there because nothing could ever be there without it now this is what he said he said your spirit would be out of place there it couldn't come there there'd be no way for it to come no matter that it would be he says no more than it would be if a grain of corn to raise up out of the ground without the germ of life in it no matter how natural it looks it could not raise my friend you old people you young people you don't know what time you're going to have to leave we don't know that but let me persuade you as a Christian brother that loves you except you're born again and that the spirit of God of love comes into your heart you'll certainly miss that place amen let's Stand Together God bless you thank you for your your patience thank you for your patience God bless your bodies got to give you strength foreign course I am so needy Lord try to focus on the Lord for just a second if he wants you to do anything amen I am so needy Lord so needy of you foreign I am so needy Lord to be more like

forward unless you feel to come but just as a as a family here if the Lord has spoken to you that you need to start pursuing the rest of him and your your spirit has more witness with that and you want to make a a connection with God right now concerning the word that he has spoken to us foreign start laying some things aside in your life you're going to start opening time to pursuing this very important thing because you want him to choose you you are the bride and you want to be ready you want me to pray with you that you're about to hold to that commitment just raise your hands amen God

you've come into our hearts Lord thank you Jesus praise you who praise you praise you for your wonderful love Lord Jesus Praise You Lord amen amen brother Marty had something he wanted to share amen all right we called the prayer many of you know October is a pastor appreciation month and in the past we have always had like a meal or we've given them Gifts of him and and sister Cheryl and um uh but uh brother John has has asked for something different this year he doesn't want a a a banquet he doesn't want any gifts he doesn't want any trips anything like that he had just asked that uh that each and every one of you would just uh in one way show him uh appreciation not for his efforts but it's for what he has been preaching and it's all for the Lord but what he has asked is that you just show it through uh maybe contacting him and giving a testimony of what he has meant uh to you what the Lord has meant to you via his uh his preaching and uh another way would be uh just write him a letter how you feel and appreciation or a card anything like that and just yeah you got the whole month the whole month of October to do that and I think that just shows the heart of our our dear Pastor uh you know he's he never puts himself first never raises himself above anybody he's always putting himself below so uh but that's what he wants and so that's what I think we should all do so amen thank you let's just power ahead in the word of prayer dear heavenly father we're so thankful for this wonderful message that you have given us Lord we can see over the course of time here the pre how the preaching has gone Lord Jesus and it's it's just getting a higher level on a higher level and Lord Jesus if our dear Prophet had said back in 1965 that the Lord is coming soon how much sooner is he going to come now I know in many many hearts here feel that his coming as imminent Lord and as evidenced by what he said about those figures of all people dying and even in our own experience we've lost a loved one just so instantly when that same person would probably think that she had many many more years so may none of us feel that we have a lot of time and may we feel that an urgency Lord to follow your direction and what you have preached to us today Lord Jesus and may we be practical in looking at the things in our lives that are getting in the way and choking out everything Lord may we have perfect love Lord Jesus may we even look at our phones and look at the screen time how much time are we spending on on that phone and we think it's okay because it's it's news or whatever Lord Jesus forgive us for how much time we do spend on that Lord it just slips the devil puts a smoke screen out and just blocks our vision and so Lord may we have that heart for you Lord Jesus put everything aside let us work on everything that we can Lord and may we exhibit perfect love for you and may we all but just a desire to meet you in the air as soon as you come Lord we love you and thank you for your grace and your mercy in our lives and we pray these things in your precious holy name our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ because I just wanted to say one thing I never talked to brother Marty but I did talk to Anne and it I I didn't say that everybody had to say something uh that that we've done for you that's not it and I just I I said if if if you if we did help you number one if if the if somehow the ministry the pastor has somehow helped in any any way if you want to you can share that would be that would definitely be encouraging but you know if it hasn't happened or you don't feel too you know don't do nothing you know well no I I just make my I God bless you you coming here just is you loving I see your love coming here for the word so God bless God bless you true Lord Jesus Keep Me true keep me true Lord Jesus Keep Me true there's a race to be run there are victories to be won give me power every hour keep me true keep me true Lord Jesus Keep Me I appreciate you
