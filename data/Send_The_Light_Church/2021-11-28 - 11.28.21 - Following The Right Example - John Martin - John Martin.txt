had a good thanksgiving amen it's good to be back together in god's house and that god gave us safe passage here uh this morning we're going to talk about examples and we've heard that we are our lives can be the only bible that some people will ever read our our biblical life is the the only bible that some people will ever read the bible says that we are written epistles and uh so we want to be the right example do we not amen let's bow our head and just in a word of prayer before we read the scriptures heavenly father we thank you for your grace and our lives today it's only by your grace that we're standing here with the desire to serve you lord we don't got to look back too far in our life to see that there was a time that we didn't even retain you in our thoughts didn't have a desire we just wanted to do our own thing go our own way but lord you got our attention you put us on the right track and here we are by your grace today standing with a desire to serve you we want to thank you from the bottom of our heart we want to be that one leper that came back to give you thanks for making our lives whole lord pray lord that you just take control of all the spirits lord lord any thing that would him try to hinder the service lord any doubts any fears questions just remove it from our midst may your sweet peace love be preeminent lord as you lead and guide us into your word today lord we want to leave here so focused on you lord that nothing could distract us away from it pray lord you forgive us of our sins and trespasses oh mighty god we need you in this hour pray that you come and meet all the needs that would be amongst us as we present him to you lord take this word lord that be ministered and through that word i pray lord not one need would would be un met because lord you're able to do exceedingly above all that we would ask or even thank you we're trusting in you today lord we give you praise and honor in jesus precious name amen just want to read one verse there and that's verse number 11 beloved follow not that which is evil but follow that which is good he that doeth good is of god but he that doeth evil have not seen god you may be seated god bless you but we just want to really take the first part of that beloved follow not that which is evil but follow that which is good now when we think about what is evil we could be thinking you know drastic something drastic like the occult or the illuminati or people who just just worship evil but we all know that our own desires can be evil so we must be careful who we are following because we don't know their desires they could be evil so for a subject we want to take we become the example we follow we become the example that we follow so we want to entitle this message following the right example another scripture we just want to read before we get started here is saint john chapter 13 starting with verse number 12. we want to take a look at the right example that that's jesus christ god i want to say god bless her friends here that are anne's friend joelle and her husband mike god bless you sorry that i didn't say something sooner so good to have you here with us today may the lord bless you today as our prayer here uh starting in verse number 12 of saint john chapter 13 so after he had washed their feet after jesus had washed their feet and taken his garment and was set down again he said unto them know ye what i have done to you you call me master and lord and you say well for so i am if i then your lord and your master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done unto you when it comes to following the right example there are a couple very important things to remember right off the bat number one is awareness here jesus says do you know what i've done right amen if we're not even aware of what's happening in front of us we're not going to catch it and two is that we got to have enough of a desire to follow the right example because our flesh is lazy our flesh it doesn't always want to do the right thing and the bible tells us that they overcame the devil in their lives the very accuser of the brother by the blood of the lamb by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto the death and if we're going to follow the right example we've got to hate our flesh the wrong desire the laziness feeling that it's adequate in the area that it's living today amen now we are presently living in the most deceptive time in history of all mankind today you would think that with things being so bad it would be quite easy to discern the difference between right wrong but jesus said the two spirits in our age would be so close that only the elected would come to see the actual truth now imagine that the whole world was just a real holy place and there was only a little bit of evil it would be much easier to me to see it but because there's so much evil everywhere all i have to do is say i'm a little bit better than that person i'm a little bit better than that person and feel that i'm okay and this is what's deceptive about this age now this means the examples being set before us would be so close it would deceive the very elect if it were possible if the two spirits are there that means the two examples both examples would have some form of godliness to him but only one would have the power of the holy ghost now scripture tells us to get away from any religious spirit that that professes a form of godliness amen but does not have the power to actually manifest the gospel so words are dangerous if you know what i'm saying now why is why is this jesus said if the blind lead the blind they both fall in the ditch he said let them alone amen a form of godliness stay away from it get away from it you don't want to entangle yourself with the thinking that it's okay because what it's going to do is suck you into it amen did you ever notice when you see somebody hang out with somebody for a certain period of time that they begin to act like them don't last forever it only lasts for a certain amount of time why is that it's because people catch one another's spirit that's right they end up following the spirit they're around and this is why we need to be careful about what spirit we're following we become the example that we follow so follow the right example we don't want to be satisfied with just a form of religion but a power a power to live the gospel everyone wants to be followed look at twitter facebook pinterest look at my website everyone wants to have a following but if you follow the wrong example you're going to end up falling in the same place that they're going to fall it's more important to know what you're following and who you're following than we actually think i know we want to thank the best of everybody but we just need to understand i am a sinful man there's only one example for us all to follow and that's jesus christ everyone is following somebody some example whether they know it or not whether they want to admit it or not so it's crucial to be following the right example jesus said follow me and satan said do your own thing go where you want to go be what you want to be and then don't worry you're still following jesus see one is the right spirit and the other is deceptive one is the right example and the other is a deceptive example now we don't want to be little examples because they are crucial they are needful they are one of the most powerful teachers that we can learn from is an example we don't retain much from what we hear we retain more by what we see and because we all know that everybody has the ability to talk but very few few people have the ability to live what they're saying examples are the most powerful tools that can teach others with so never underestimate the power of an example i'll talk about one in the bible jesus had picked his chosen apostles he personally taught them how to disciple and before jesus left the earth he told them that all power was given unto him in heaven and in earth and he said in matthew 28 verse 19 he said go ye therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the father and of the son and the holy ghost teaching them to observe all things whatsoever i've commanded you and lo i am with you always even to the end of the world amen now these were the words of jesus that he taught to his his own apostles and he taught them how to disciple others and he gives them this last message before he leaves and it seems pretty cut and dry that they're supposed to go out and they're supposed to tell others about jesus and and and baptize them uh in the name of the father and of the son and of the holy ghost i'll tell you we'd be in bad shape if we didn't have a biblical example on this one would think we don't need an example it's pretty cut and dry what jesus wants us to do and that's why there's so many churches out there that are baptizing the titles father son and holy ghost because they believe in what they see jesus saying here without a biblical example but the apostles never baptized believers that way not once in the bible is recorded that anyone ever baptized in the titles i know the majority of the church world baptizes that way but we can't find one biblical example the only example that we could find is turn with me to acts chapter 2. the example of what jesus spoke spoke louder than the actual words to many believers today i've heard some ministers say well i'll take what jesus said over what the apostle said all sudden we're going to begin to interpret that some of the word is correct and some of the word is not before you know it you have no foundation of what is true amen jesus meant exactly what he said amen but we need the right interpretation and i'll say today we need the right example set before one another therefore let us verse 36 therefore let all the house of israel know or surely that god has made the same jesus whom you have crucified both lord and christ this same jesus is both jehovah lord jehovah and the anointed messiah the the holy ghost he's all three remember jesus said all power is given unto me in heaven and earth that's what exactly what what peter is saying right here and when they heard this they were pricked in their heart and they said unto peter to the rest of the apostles men and brethren what shall we do to be saved what do we need to really do and then peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ what i got to do that it's for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost it's a promise he said for their promises unto you to your children and to all that are afar off even as many as the lord our god shall call and with many other words did he testify and exert saying save yourself you're the only one that can do that you've got to make a decision which direction you're going to go save yourselves from this entre generation now look at this verse i love this then they that gladly received the word they were baptized and the same day they were there were added unto them about 3 000 souls notice what was added the souls not the bodies not church members not faithful students of the word no they were souls examples are very needful they're powerful paul the right one keeps us out of trouble and i'll just i'm going to say from the bottom of my heart i'm so glad that you have not followed all of my example because you'd come short of the glory of god you would be short of what god is calling you to be that's why we should never put man above what he is man is a man that's it man is a man you're a man you're a woman that's all you are now the god in you he's greater than that praise the lord that's right and we don't gotta go ahead and and try to dissect everyone's life all we got to know is the right example and then we'll know who's following it and who's not right it's real simple examples are powerful when god places a good example in our lives he expects us to follow that example as we go through these scriptures today we'll discover that examples are without the use of words examples are the manifestation of words they show the character or the illustration of words we all follow examples we do we follow somebody and we're all an example to somebody parents want to be a good role model for their children god has placed good examples for our lives to follow but he's also placed bad examples i shouldn't say his place he is allowed better word he has allowed bad examples in her life to teach us so we can learn what not to follow i used to say when i was a i learned more from people's mistakes than i ever do from the good that they're doing it's about being aware of what's right and wrong i i mean when i was a boy we were all kids right so at one time we all stole and lied and did lots of stuff right it was just not been our parents might have been our brother and sister might have been everybody i remember going into a store and wanting to steal something wasn't mine but hey this is the thing that you did this is how i watched others right yeah i mean i i used to you know my little history with drugs but you know i was following the wrong group i was following the wrong example and it took me i became what i followed we just we don't want to follow a good church member we don't want to follow somebody to church we want to follow christ we want to become him we don't want to be a good church member one thing i've noticed in our lives about examples that they want to be followed whether they're good or bad it doesn't matter if parents yell at their kids all the time they still want them to listen to them so good example or bad example it wants to be followed generally speaking people care more about their reputation and getting what they want than the example that they're studying many you just don't care very much about their example they're under the delusion that their example doesn't mean very much like their words outweigh their example words are easy to say they take much less effort than living out the example of those words i'll never forget my dad tell me he says don't you ever smoke because he held a cigarette in his hand he said it's bad for you how can i forget that it would have been so much better if he never smoked and said the words to me words are easy to say words like we should love one another but it's much harder to live out the example of it it's harder to turn the cheek go the second mile pray for those who despitefully use you jesus never said by these words that you speak shall all men know you're my disciples he said by their fruit you'll know them by the example when they wash dirty feet when they lay down their lives one for another by this shall all men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another. so it's the example that we are setting and not the words that we're speaking examples are visuals for us they express more clearly what detail the words are saying they give meaning to words we've often heard the expression visuals help me to see they simply give a broader understanding to words brother branham said in a message investments he said your life will shine a lot louder than your testimony could ever give now he didn't say the same amount here there he said a lot because it's harder to live what you're speaking he said your life is so loud till the people don't even understand your testimony in other words it becomes confusing when you say that that you're a born-again christian and you do the things that born and christians don't do come on there should be lots of lots of amen now i'm not talking about mistakes now we all make them and we got enough evidence against us to hang us and put us in hell but thank god for the blood but i'm talking about the life that we're living the example that we're studying every day examples should be of the utmost importance to us those who are ignorant or don't care about their example will end up following the wrong example then they will become a wrong example so the blind lead the blind they both fall in the ditch that's why when you you're trying to help somebody if there's just mine so made up that they're right let them alone jesus said my sheep hear my voice and they follow the right example they follow him amen that's right we've got to be more concerned about the example we're following and the example that we are leading i think i've learned as i said more from other people's mistakes than people's right example because we can learn from one another you ever swat somebody do something you say why did they do that you want to know bad enough for the right motive god will show you that's good yes awareness is crucial for learning amen jesus taught many things from other people's wrong examples jesus said remember lot's wife remember the example of lot his wife she just wanted to look back take one more last look we don't want to do that amen jesus taught us by that example as it was in the days of noah so shall be in the coming of the son of man here jesus is wanting us to look back at the example the time that noah lived there's only a few that made it had 120 years to preach it but only a few made it they didn't believe in fact they they mocked noah the bible says there was only evil continually on the minds of the people that during that age kind of what's happening now they didn't like to retain god in their minds jesus said in luke chapter 17 verse 28 likewise also as it was in the days of lot they did eat and they drank and they bought and they sold they planned and they built it we think well that's pretty normal life yes it seems normal but the same day that lot went out of sodom it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all so we can't look to the news to the bind to the new building that's going on two we got another year to plant things right we can just get together and have fellowship and eat and drink we can't look at that as as he's not coming right even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed sodom was so filled with the gay movement if any of what we see today it's growing like a rampage and what happened god destroyed it with fire the son of man has been revealed we're living in the hour it's later than we think jude chapter 1 verse 7 says even as sodom and gomor and the cities about them and like men are giving themselves over to fornication and giving and going after strange flesh oh my people don't even know who they are anymore are set forth at for an example suffering the vengeance of eternal fire an example fire's coming again it's going to burn this earth when jude had a burden for the common salvation of the saints he said it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered to the saints no we just can't sit around and say we're saved common salvation oh i'm saved no we've got to earnestly be contending just watch tv for four hours and tell me your faith isn't zapped you may still think you're religious you may still think you're as powerful but i'm telling you the spirits that come off of that thing they just take away the real true genuine joy inside of us jude chapter 1 verse 5 says i will therefore put you in remembrance here goes teaching by the wrong example now though he once knew this how that the lord having saved the people of the land of egypt afterwards destroyed them that believe not in earnestly contending for the faith i'm saved i'm out of egypt everything's okay i don't need to press in and go all the way to the promised land i'll serve god over here if we're not earnestly contending you have one that's not happy with you the one that you claim that loves you yes he loves you but he wants you to be pressing for more than what you got today jude was reminding the believer that just because you've received salvation doesn't mean it's time to take it easy we got to earnestly contend or we're going to miss something god has has promised us the writer of hebrews now he used the same example in hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 he said let us therefore fear last a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it quran just was the gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them because it wasn't mixed with faith when they heard it he concludes here in verse 11 let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any of you fall after the same example of unbelief don't say i i would i would never do that i would be next to joshua and caleb yeah you can't say that you've got to live that come on you've got to live that you've got to be the one that says we're more than able to take the promises of god for our time god is the same yesterday today and forever he hasn't lost his power i can't sit back and say well i'm still part of the group we're living in an hour of lukewarmness laodicea in need of nothing as they fell from their own steadfastness we can fall from our own steadfastness you know what that means partial rest partial rest don't be confused with a partial rest to the rest that god has for us there remains a complete resting god to your life is so sold out to god that you don't worry about anything that you live all things work together for the good in your life no matter what happens when the children of israel were in bondage they cried out for deliverance and jehovah god saved them and after their deliverance you know what happened they literally lost their thankfulness we just had thanksgiving to me brother ron should have been up here seeing such a wave of thanksgiving coming amen they murmured they complained how can you be thankful remember to complain about what they had to go through as if god made a mistake in their life they stopped wanting to go to church you know their hearts became hardened when they heard god's word they didn't want to be under god's leadership they wanted somebody else who would take them with their desires which was the easier path paul referred to their example when he wrote in corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 first corinthians chapter 10 verse 5 he says but with many of them god was not well pleased for they were overthrown in the wilderness now these things were our examples to the intent that we should not lust after evil things as they also lusted examples teaching by someone who did the wrong thing now what evil things are they talking about i'll just say it like this to bring it home any desire that keeps you away from pressing into the full nature of jesus christ is an evil desire we're calling for one thing to become like jesus i know satan is he's been there from the beginning i remember at the very beginning tell me i could still keep my worldly records and serve god so i i'm going to church now i'm in the message much farther along than i was so many things he dealt with me but this flesh didn't want to give it up perhaps we got things in our lives that we don't want to give up you need to look at those things they can keep you from where god is calling you too now it doesn't matter if you're following the same group as in the message of the hour if we're eating the same spiritual meat which is the word of the hour and drinking of the same holy ghost presence among us we know what happens if we do not continue to follow the leadership of the lord do you see how we can learn from a lot of people's wrong mistakes yes amen they're written for our our admonition amen for our for us first corinthians chapter 10 verse 11 says now all these things happen unto them for examples and they're written for our admonition that means to call to our attention or to warn us to rebuke us upon whom the ends of the world are come wherefore let him that thinketh he stand he needs to take heed amen take heed lest he fall the worst thing that we could do is compare ourselves with somebody else that it's not doing as good as we the wisest thing to do is compare yourself with somebody who's doing better than you that is the wisest thing you could do so often i remember growing up in church thinking you know because in a church you got a lot of different beliefs same group but you get along with them and you're talking with them and you find out that there's different beliefs then what the message taught and i remember thinking to myself well it would be easier if i believe like this one because they don't it's okay to do this and do that and and they they're still coming you know we're all faced with that right we're all faced with an opportunity to choose the easier path the problem is you're getting your eyes off the real example the real example and getting your eyes on a human being who does not have a true revelation of the word of the message of the hour but because he seems religious or she seems religious or she's got this or that or she can prove this or indeed right it just doesn't matter we should be concerned is it lining up with the word or not samples are important we need to watch who we're following because we will become who we're following and remember you're following somebody and somebody is following you so the quicker you get them off you get them on jesus less pressure i'm not saying right examples are easy to follow they're hard to live and they're hard to follow jesus considered his way to be the hardest of all right the hardest way it's the hardest example it's full of trials afflictions tribulations separations disappointments you go through a lot when you follow the lord you can't live for yourself anymore you have to live for others right isn't it sad the way i put that yeah to live for others like there's no joy in it you have to love others more than you love yourself the right example is to be concerned more about others tend to be concerned about your own self the right examples in the bible teach us the correct way regardless of how hard the way may seem so following the right example and being the right example requires a strong faith not a strong will a strong personality uh a strong gifts no a strong faith to be able to stand the test the trials the things that you come up against that you could still stand there and know that you're doing the right thing james chapter 5 verse 10 says take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience behold we count them happy which endure why do we count them happy because they were strong in faith they were able to job didn't say hey this ain't fair i didn't solve this what is this happening to me i'm just gonna quit if god was really in the remember david when he looked at all the evil who were prospering in the world the bible says his foot almost stumbled then he went to church and he was listening to the word of god amen and it was there that god showed him their end prosperity doesn't mean we're prospering in the lord neither does having nothing say that god's favor isn't with us but we need to be strong or we're going to stumble and if you fall the bible just says real clear get back up quick get back up quick quick quick quick quick don't think about it don't lay there don't sit there just get back up and if you fall again get back up again be strong in faith that's what is needed behold we count them happy that which endure you have heard of the patience of job and have seen the end of the lord that he's very pitiful and and of tender mercy so if you're going through something you don't think is fair just remember so did your brother job maybe god's bragging on you too maybe he wants to show you off think about it here is lucifer who was maiden who knows how many eons be before we were right actually came to manifestation i mean we were in god's thoughts but god wants to show us off to him because it's really the battle between god and him amen amen so we got to follow the right example amen first peter chapter 2 verse 20 for what glory is it when you be buffeted for your faults and you say yes you're right my bad take it patiently yeah you caught me on that one sorry but if you do well and you're suffer for it and you take it patiently you don't try to defend right how right you were the bible says this is acceptable with god so if you want to bring god a gift today god is has certain gifts that are acceptable to him he'll accept certain ones and other ones he won't accept so it's not about proving how right we are it's about taking what his word tells us to do is our example and living that out your life becomes an offering to him take it patiently you know it's real easy to take things more patiently when you realize how unworthy you are but as soon as you think you're something and you didn't deserve that and that person isn't right for doing that well then you want to show you know some self-righteous indignation but it ain't righteous indignation it's your own right the bible says god will take care of the battle amen and you know what you might be interested in proving what's right and wrong but god's more interested in building your character that other person may never know who was right and wrong but if he can get his character in you that's what he really wants he's standing on the door letting you go through this little trial are you gonna slam the door and jesus say no i'm gonna i'm gonna are you gonna open the door and let them in and say lord do you want me to be patient i'll be patient you want me to zip my lip i'll zip my lip we have a chance to open the door all the time to jesus not just once in our life every day he comes knocking okay it's time for school time to get up we got a test to take verse 21 for even here and two were you call it because christ also suffered for us he suffered for us leaving us an example that you should follow his steps who did no sin neither was guile found in his mouth who when reviled even vowed not again when he suffered he threatened not i'll show you but he committed himself to hand that judgeth righteously who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sin should live unto righteousness by whose stripes ye are healed ye were healed for ye were as sheep gone astray but now return unto the ship shepherd and bishop of your souls we've returned to the shepherd and bishop of our soul so what do we do what now we do now that we return to jesus just say oh i'm here i'm a christian i'm safe now ain't good enough now you follow his example it just it's gonna get hard now it's nice when the sins are forgiven it's nice that we're set free it's nice when we're bubbling with joy but now it's time to lay down our lives for one another this is the example this is our calling everybody wants to show their gift of whatever it may feel to be but the true calling is to be like jesus that's why you go to some churches you some you know you they just it's all about popularity contest who wants to be the best singer who wants to be the the best the best the best the best the best well we've got more members we've got glass windows we've got the funniest preachers right what about we have lives that are sold out and lay down their lives for one another what about that because that's what jesus pointed us to that's our example why has humanity stepped inside the church and want to have church mix god right with their own flesh that when somebody comes and says this is the way church should be they begin to kick them out they keep jesus out and they're literally having church without any suffering it's all about making people feel good it's about when you leave you feel better than when you came and that's all that matters and i'll tell you if that's really all that matters to us we're missing our calling we're not called to that amen i can't find that in the scriptures leaving us an example that we should follow his steps following the example he left for us so when we're attacked by someone we're suffering we don't fight back we just love them we don't let guile be found in our mouth now that word gown means decoy a decoy crafty tricky deceitful or subtility in other words you don't let your conversation be with i got something on going on back here but i'm not going to tell you you understand come on now don't sit there and say ah it's the word hidden agendas i want to do this but i'm going to start with this don't let that be found in your mouth it wasn't in jesus's why should it be in ours well because i feel that i need to do this to get what i want no trust in him commit yourself to god trust in him trust that that god is so strong in your life that he will perform it amen let your yay be a and your navy name don't argue don't lash back don't swear don't threaten let your conversation be always with grace coupled with fear this is the example for us learn to commit your situation to god he bore your sins you're given an opportunity to help bear somebody else's yeah they're hurting you they're being mean to you you got a chance to put your arm around we're gonna make it i know you don't understand just like jesus did for you i got to do that brother john i didn't see i i don't see that in the scriptures we need a greater experience at the cross amen we need to remember what the cross was about we returned back to the shepherd and bishop of our souls to follow his example amen not just to say i'm safe right right i'm glad that you're safe now get out there and save somebody get out there and and bring christ to somebody bring a higher walk to somebody a higher life challenge somebody don't talk about others talk help somebody to wash get down on your knees and wash somebody's feet in front of somebody let them see that your calling is not just to look good it's to be good and be good is when you're on your knees washing cleaning serving bearing helping one another it's an example for us we can recognize when other people are washing somebody's feet but again people recognize you washing one of their feet jesus that intimate time in that upper room he brought them to an awareness do you know what i've done do you know what i've done is it mean anything to you yeah it means that no way you're not going to wash my feet jesus now that's a stinky dirty you shouldn't you're too you shouldn't do that hey if i don't do this to you you don't even have a place in the kingdom well wait a minute don't stop there wash my whole body why everything is it even in our schedule to go wash somebody's feet is it part of our thinking is it part of our thoughts is our life so consumed with ourself that others outside of our little thing that we're looking at god has called us more to this more than yes a hundred by two hundred foot house or whatever we live in right sometimes we're too busy trying to get others to follow us instead of following the example that christ gave us this church ought to be following the example that christ gave us to follow amen this church ought to be leading others by example not by words to me something's wrong when you got to keep pulling people off to the side and telling them over and over and over come on we need to be looking at the example because then we'll know what we need to do the right example make sure check it out with the word because we don't want to follow a man we're all going to fail paul believed in following people following him only if he was following christ i'm going to take it from where we were now i'm going to get you to where we ought to be leading people with our example now our words we need to be leading one another where are we supposed to be leading them higher than where they're at so whoever you're talking to know where they're at have the motive to bring them up higher well brother john i don't feel i'm called to do that well what are you called to do what is your calling where is it in the scriptures find yourself in the scriptures amen that's why we went through them today that wasn't just for certain people it was for believers paul's said in galatians chapter 1 verse 8 but though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than what we have preached unto you let him be accursed though we you know you ever talk to somebody they say one thing one time a month later they're saying something different a week later sometimes they're saying something different and you don't know which one is which paul wanted to make it real clear what was what that the gospel that he preached he said i certify that the gospel that i preached i didn't receive it of man i wasn't taught it by man but by the holy ghost so you and i today in this 21st 2021 the end of it we can have confidence in the word of god that it is god's word it wasn't paul's word amen that's why paul could say in first corinthians chapter 4 verse 16 wherefore i beseech you be ye followers of me because he followed christ he got a he had a revelation of suffering for the lord he presented his body a living sacrifice when he was comparing himself with the others ministers he didn't talk about how many baptized or how good the sermons were no he talked about his sufferings he compared what he had to go through for the gospel that's what he that was his uh certificate unlike most of us who look at other things for our credentials but if you're really following jesus you're willing to suffer for others and i'm not talking behind a pulpit or in front of people i'm talking about every single day there's a yearning to put you out yonder with with people wanting to bring jesus to them and you know what it takes suffering sometimes they're to make fun of you sometimes going to tell you get out of my face but it's christ in you a burden that believes that there's a soul there and if you just go through the trial come out loving them more than they've ever seen before then they're going to know there's something special about you you're a little different you're not one that just talks and walks different right in fact you hardly talk you just walk got my attention praise the lord paul said in first corinthians chapter 11 verse 1 he said be ye followers of me even as i also am of christ it's okay to follow somebody as long as they're following christ now understand this statement we're all following christ to some degree that does not give me liberty to go follow every one of you because what about the part of your life that isn't following christ that's the part that's going to get me in trouble so i follow you as you're following christ and where you're not following him step away step away of course you wanna hey this is what the gospel says this is what the prophet said this is what the message said and the bible says that if you win them it's to the benefit you're saving them from the sin but if they won't receive you you've got to get away from that spirit because that same spirit will get on you and you'll be compromising with something else yes you got to remember god is not calling us to be a good church here at sunderland god is calling sun the light to become like him it's a much higher calling and that's why we've got to get our our eyes fixed on jesus amen we're following paul as he follows christ he said i count not myself to have apprehended think of this i'm following paul now and he's following christ so he must have the same attitude that christ has he says i can't not myself to have apprehended jesus said i only do those things that please the father i'm not there come on he came to do the work of the father in other words paul didn't set a bad example and so i've already attained who are you to tell me i'm older than you i know more than you i've been in the message more than you that's a bad example he labored to enter into the rest of god's divine nature catch that he labored to enter in to the rest of god's divine nature there still remaineth a rest for the people of god there is more of god's divine nature for us it just needs to become our desire just needs to become our desire he continued to reach forth unto those things which were in front of him he pressed towards the mark of the prize of the high calling christ jesus now what he was doing he was following christ amen and as long as you're doing that you are following christ amen and the moment you say well i don't got time for all that you know i can i can come to i'll make i'll come to church you know i got other things going you understand what i'm saying yes i know it's a high calling but we're either following we're following his example or we're following somebody else is thinking we're following the right example turn with me if you would to philippians chapter 3 verse 17 he's letting the church know what the right example is to fall he says brethren be followers together of me and mark them which walk so be followers of me and take and and mark those put up put a mark on somebody that walks just like me mark them you know the jews they got a mark right they had a star that was put on them it was all part of the plan to to capture all the jews and annihilate them so they started with a mark do you know the angel went by and he put a mark on those that signed and cried for the abominations and here paul was saying mark then that walk just like me that's your example amen as you have us for an example paul is inviting the elected god to follow together now to join together in what picking up their cross and so of suffering that's what he's inviting him to because that's what you have to do if you're going to keep pressing towards the lord more lord more lord more of the lord you're you're picking you up your cross that's right for many walk with the wrong example now of whom i've told you often and now i tell you even weeping look at the burden that he has for the believers here he said they that they are the enemies of the cross of christ in other words they're not willing to pick up their cross and be a christian they want to be a christian without picking up the cross they're literally enemies of the cross see how we can become an enemy of the cross because we don't want to suffer want to live a soft life brother man says we've got to accept our responsibility he said whose end is just whose end is destruction whose god is their belly you know what you put in your belly we all put in our belly every day something we want we don't go home and say it's time to eat i want to eat i want we're going to eat everything i hate whose god is their belly whose god is their desire whose glory is their shame who mind earthly things now we're following paul to christ amen second timothy chapter three he tells him in verse number 10 but that was fully known my doctrine my manner of life my purpose my faith my long suffering my charity my patience you also know my persecutions my afflictions which came unto me at any like iconium lystra what persecutions i endured but out of them all the lord delivered me look at the example he sat it's important if we would just come up to one another and say what is your purpose i'll never forget very young before we started doing uh missions in central america i had invited um um brother melchizedek to our house and i just had such a burden to help in the mission field down there you know i was moving my pulpit earlier used to be up there and i was looking at it and i never moved it back tripping over this cord and i said brother milk cause we went downstairs and i just having some alone time with him and i said that i just i wanna i wanna help i wanna help i don't know what to do i just i just wanna help he looked at me and the first words that came out of his mouth he said what is your purpose right i like that we can get to the end result quicker we don't have to go through the phony baloney because that's all it is it's funny baloney it's a smoke screen we can look at paul's life and see his purpose his manner what he was aiming for what he was trying to get us to do to follow him amen first thessalonians chapter one verse four and then we need to go quickly we're we're getting real close here please bear with me knowing brethren beloved your election of god for our gospel came not unto you in word only but also in the power and of the holy ghost and much assurance you know what matter of men we were among you for your sake and you became followers of us and of the lord having received the word in much affliction with joy and of the holy ghost and so that ye were in samples to all that believed in macedonia and acai so here he's talking to the thessalonians paul preached to them they followed paul as he followed christ and he led them to christ they received the realness of god not just their own idea and then they became examples to others and this is what the gospel is supposed to be like amen leading people not with their own private interpretation but something that lines up with the bible amen now you can't be too young to be an example first timothy chapter 4 verse 11 these things command and teach that's what i'm doing today i'm teaching commanding let no man despise thy youth but be thou an example of the believers in word in conversation this is your behavior by the way in charity in your love in spirit that's right there's one spirit right in faith and in purity be an example hebrews chapter 6 verse 11 and we desire that every one of you to show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope right to the end that should be not slothful but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises now i don't know what promise you're looking for i'll be honest with you promises can be very very very very very open there's one promise that we should be concerned about more than any other promise this is just john martin the bible says it does not yet appear but what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him i know that if i'm there i'm going if i'm not there but i still say i'm going i could find myself missing it so our priority should be becoming more like him in the life that we live not the words we say not the church we go to not the money we give the life that we're living the life of of of laying down our lives to help somebody who's not doing as good as we are when's the last time you called somebody that you hated to help them right right true well brother john i don't know if i've ever done that well do you know what you hated christ right he laid down his life for you and then he got your attention and he said to you one day i died for you yep amen now if he's living in you right won't you lay down your life for the brethren for others amen last quote i want to read to you about the um message influence brother i'm talking about following the right example he says you just put one or two good members in a church just one or two now this is kind of bad but if there's only one or two who are they let's for a moment just so we don't have any problems here let's for a moment just think you are the one good member you are the good member will you do that with me that's really on fire for god well that's the first thing you good member need to be on fire for god now notice it's not a fire to make yourself something or to preach come on it's a fire for god he said it will do more for that church notice what your fire and you being a good member is going to do for this church you know we may not like john f kennedy but he did say one thing he says don't ask what this country can do for you but what you can do for the country it's not about what this church can do for you about what you can do to make the church better if you're on fire for god you're a good member your focus will perform what the prophet said it'll do something for that church more than 40 revivalists could ever do he said right now look he he says a good cleansed member set an example with a face shining with the glory of god amen with sweetness with humility to stand there in the power of god now notice how he's talking what the power of god is it's humility and sweetness in other words it don't matter how you hit him what you say knock him over he's still gonna love you anyways yes sweet and humble standing there in the power of god oh never ever forget and i was down the stairs at our old church brother johnson was our pastor and there was a man there in that church he was um he had great needs when i looked at him i said that was the closest that he could see of someone being possessed with a devil he would be in and out of the church and he would act so crazy now remember every time he came around there was just a little concern i remember one time he came downstairs and we were just there and all sudden brother johnson started talking to him and immediately took control of that situation and i saw the wisdom of god so much manifested in front of me don't know i don't think i ever told him that i remember just walking away just marveling and thought god if i could just have ten percent of the wisdom that man has we can't be an example one for another and it's not from the pulpit it's when you hear something you're dealing with something that isn't just right you know what happens christ just steps in takes care of it you know love covers a multitude of sin that's all we need is him let's stand together god bless you for your patience today he's our example as we're standing i want us to think about what example have you been following it's okay whoever it is as long as they're really following christ in that area that you're following in one sense i could say it's extremely dangerous for us to follow one another because we're going to find out somewhere where we shouldn't be sorry but it doesn't mean we should become all scared right about one another what it means is that we should learn our bible better yes that we should learn christ more in the realness and not what one another think about it that's right because once you find a true revelation of the life that you're supposed to be living you won't but you can't help but to share it with somebody because that's what happens it's christ in you wanting to share the proper life yes amen let's just go before him in a word of prayer with every head bowel i wonder if there's someone today that would say brother john would you remember me in prayer that i could be the example that christ wants me to be i bless these hands every hand just raised practically god bless you god sees your desire to represent him in this evil age what an honor what an honor let's believe with all of our hearts father i don't believe that you brought us to this point of the service without leading us closer to you your word declares that you sent your word to heal the people and certainly lord there's a body that needs to be healed but there's also a character a spirit part of us that needs to be more like you you sent your word today to bring a healing amending to any opened areas to any thing that would be broken oh god you said a humble and contrite spirit a broken i will not despise lord you see the hands that have been raised that that humble desire inside of each one of them to be more like you to not fashion themselves after the things of the world but to be a real representation of god in this age bless each one with their desire lord lord as they believe now in their hearts lord that what their hand was raised for their their very hearts desire to be christ to one another in the church to their family members to their neighbors to those they work with to those they come in contact with that they could see the real love of god may they astonish many as they bend their spirit wash one another's feet may many see you inside of them lords my prayer may they have to step back and say that was not a man that was god in a man lord they have received your word and i pray that you manifest in their lives let this word never depart for them but all that they say think and do and remember lord there being that example for someone to come and follow someday lord we commit ourselves to you in our church lord we know that we're not everything that we should be we know we've failed just so many times we don't even feel worthy to even stand here lord to think lord that you would want a little lighthouse to be in this community god when we're full of problems and faults and failures we've come short of your glory so many times but oh god we know that you've given us the privilege today to be the very best that we can be for those that don't know you may we shine bright for you lord may we give our very best may we love at all times lord and we give you the praise for these things lord give you the honor for them we humbly ask now in jesus precious name we thank you for it lord we give you

more time it is what god can do he's all-powerful done for others [Music] it is [Music] amen okay thank you my precious brother our brother wanted us to read something that the prophet said he said may god begin by his spirit to give us continuous life-giving and prevailing revelation amen praise the lord grant it lord we want that amen continuous and prevailing amen in other words we don't want a revelation that doesn't prevail yes we don't want knowledge we want something that will prevail over this nature this sinful nature into the god's glorious nature and may it be continuously life-giving amen oh if the church could only get a fresh revelation and become by the living word manifested he would do greater works and glorify god our father in heaven praise the lord grant it lord jesus amen amen amen let's sing that little uh that song where he leads i'll follow before we're dismissed amen i know this is not one of the favorites but we need it this morning [Music] here was the mind of christ sinless i see he the great example is in pattern for me oh [Music] follow jesus every day sweet is the tender love of jesus have shown sweeter farther he the great example is

he didn't leave us without example he didn't leave his disciples without example that means the whole world can go crazy and we're going to be okay because we have an example to follow amen may the lord bless you and prosper you as you take this message and become all that you want to become because it all stems with desire amen may the lord richly bless you amen be dismissed in a word of prayer amen young men you dismiss this in a word of prayer amen and um yes
