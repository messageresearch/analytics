[31:29] &gt;&gt; How many feel needy?
[31:32] Amen.
[31:33] That's where we all were when we gave
[31:36] our heart to the Lord.
[31:40] &gt;&gt; That's where Isaiah was when he was in
[31:42] the presence of the Lord.
[31:45] &gt;&gt; Well, woe is me. And uh
[31:50] that's where Paul was. That's where Paul
[31:53] was
[31:55] when he said, "I got to press towards
[31:56] the mark."
[31:59] And uh
[32:01] I believe that's the place that we can
[32:06] draw closer to God when we feel so
[32:08] needy. I want to say it's a real great
[32:12] blessing to see Ann here. I was not
[32:14] expecting her to be here today. I know
[32:16] she's not feeling greatly comfortable. U
[32:21] may the Lord bless her today. Amen. I
[32:23] know she's missed being here.
[32:26] Um, let's look to the Lord in prayer and
[32:28] then we're going to get into the word of
[32:30] God today.
[32:32] Our heavenly father, Lord, we have come
[32:35] to your house
[32:38] to to receive from you the things that
[32:42] we have need of, Lord.
[32:45] And there are many needs just in each of
[32:50] our lives, Lord. We need you in so many
[32:53] different ways. And we're asking,
[32:57] Lord, that we might be filled with just
[33:01] more of you. The more of you that we
[33:04] have, the the more that those needs can
[33:09] be met. And we just pray for a a portion
[33:12] of you, Lord, that we have need of. We
[33:15] ask that you would come and break the
[33:17] bread of life to us today. Lord, may
[33:20] this word be a strength to each of our
[33:24] lives. May the word that be spoken today
[33:28] be not spoken from the human heart, but
[33:32] may it be spoken from the divine heart
[33:34] of God and reach into the heart of the
[33:38] bride of Christ here, those that would
[33:40] be watching. Lord, may you um may you
[33:45] intervene
[33:47] and um help all of us, Lord, that we
[33:50] might walk away from here with more of
[33:54] you than when we came. We commit this
[33:57] service now into your hands. Ask your
[34:00] anointing to be upon the word of God as
[34:03] it enters our hearts. We give you the
[34:05] glory for it all. In Jesus Christ's name
[34:08] we pray. Amen.
[34:11] Amen. And turn with me if you would to
[34:13] the book of St. John chapter 14.
[34:18] St. John chapter 14.
[34:29] Now we know this chapter it started out
[34:32] with the disciples being very very
[34:34] bothered that Jesus was leaving
[34:37] and their heart became troubled because
[34:40] the very one that they put all their
[34:43] their hope and trust was leaving. But
[34:46] the disciples did not understand
[34:49] that
[34:50] uh God was coming back in the form of
[34:52] the Holy Spirit to be a comforter to
[34:56] their to their lives.
[34:58] We want to pick up here in verse 22 of
[35:03] chapter 14. Judas saith unto him, not a
[35:06] scariot, not the one that would betray
[35:09] him. Lord, how is it that thou will
[35:13] manifest thyself unto us and not unto
[35:18] the world? showing a a a difference here
[35:22] that the that um the the
[35:27] uh world is not going to be comforted
[35:31] like it the disciples are.
[35:34] And Jesus answered and said unto him,
[35:37] "If a man love me," this is the most
[35:41] important part to getting comforted. If
[35:43] a man love me, he will keep my words and
[35:47] my father will love him and will come
[35:49] unto him and make our abode with him. So
[35:54] the Holy Ghost, brother, I the word of
[35:56] God says that God gives the the Holy
[35:59] Ghost to them that obey him. So the the
[36:02] the crucial part is fall in love with
[36:04] God. Follow the word the best of your
[36:07] ability and then God comes inside,
[36:10] brings the comfort. He that loveth me uh
[36:14] he that loveth not me keepeth not my
[36:17] sayings and the word which ye hear is
[36:19] not mine but the fathers that sent me.
[36:21] These things have I spoken unto you
[36:24] being yet present with you. But the
[36:26] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[36:29] my father will send in my name. He shall
[36:32] teach you all things and bring all
[36:33] things in uh bring all things to your
[36:36] remembrance whatsoever I've said unto
[36:38] you.
[36:39] And we want to take our text from this
[36:41] verse here. Peace I leave with you. My
[36:45] peace I give unto you. Not as the world
[36:49] giveth give I unto you. Let not your
[36:51] heart be troubled neither let it be
[36:54] afraid. Amen. God bless you. May be
[36:57] seated. We want to entitle this message
[36:59] creating peace for your life. A pretty
[37:02] simple subject. But how many has ever
[37:05] wanted more peace?
[37:09] and wishing that it would be there
[37:13] but having a hard time finding it
[37:15] because of the confusion, the turmoil,
[37:18] the different things that are happening.
[37:22] There's something there that's wanting
[37:23] peace. You could just even be all alone
[37:25] and the the enemy may be tormenting you
[37:27] in your mind with just thoughts at
[37:29] night.
[37:32] And there is a need uh for
[37:37] really the whole world um um could use
[37:41] the peace of God.
[37:44] And there is a a total difference
[37:47] between
[37:49] uh the peace that God gives us and the
[37:51] peace that the world gives us. And in in
[37:54] short, when the world says um peace and
[37:58] safety, then sudden destruction.
[38:01] &gt;&gt; And so there there's just a def the the
[38:04] a a a definition difference between the
[38:08] everything has to be perfectly in line
[38:10] with the world. You know, all
[38:11] circumstances good, everybody doing
[38:13] good, everything's fine. Okay. And then
[38:16] there's peace, right? But with God,
[38:19] things can be completely out of order.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; And you can have the peace of God in
[38:24] your heart.
[38:26] &gt;&gt; And I believe this is the peace that God
[38:28] wants us to create. No, peace is already
[38:33] here. Jesus left us peace. He said that
[38:36] our hearts wouldn't be troubled and
[38:39] would not be afraid. The peace of God is
[38:43] different, like I said, than the peace
[38:45] of the world. But peace, the peace of
[38:48] God is already here because the word
[38:49] says, "Peace I leave with you."
[38:54] So we live in a world full of evil, a a
[38:58] a society of selfishness, a time of
[39:01] gross darkness. We see people lacking
[39:05] peace, and some without any peace at
[39:08] all. And we see them trying to create
[39:11] peace the way the world creates peace.
[39:16] We see them taking situations into their
[39:19] own hands.
[39:21] They leave the word of God and lean to
[39:23] their own understanding. Searching for
[39:25] ways to control a situation.
[39:29] Manipulating others with their words and
[39:32] their behavior. Bullying others with
[39:34] emotional abusiveness.
[39:38] Belitting and downgrading or or talking
[39:40] negative about others. using fear
[39:43] tactics and threats to gain control so
[39:45] that they can feel what? Peace inside.
[39:50] People will go to extremes
[39:52] just so they can feel okay, everything's
[39:54] okay. No,
[39:56] but Jesus said, "My peace I give unto
[39:59] you, not as the world giveth."
[40:04] The reason people manipulate is because
[40:07] it's easier to trust in themselves to
[40:10] get the job done than it is in God
[40:12] Almighty to to to work in the behalf of
[40:16] the situation.
[40:18] Now the way the world achieves its peace
[40:20] is by taking control in their flesh.
[40:23] Brother Brandham said u using power
[40:26] without character was a satanic power.
[40:30] Right? So you you got the power to
[40:32] manipulate, but it doesn't mean it's the
[40:34] power of God. It's a it's it's a satanic
[40:37] power. And it's no different than than
[40:41] children fighting over a toy.
[40:44] They they can't be happy until they get
[40:46] what they want. So they forcefully grab
[40:49] it. They hit. They say mean things. They
[40:51] threaten. I'm not going to play. You're
[40:53] not going to be my best friend.
[40:56] And they do whatever they got to do so
[40:58] they can get the toy they want. And then
[41:00] they get the toy and they feel at peace,
[41:02] but they're exercising the power without
[41:05] character.
[41:08] And mom and dad, a a teacher or a
[41:12] babysitter says, "Now, we don't do it
[41:16] like that, Junior. We don't we don't
[41:19] grab. We don't hit. We don't say it. We
[41:22] don't act like that. Uh we got to learn
[41:25] to share."
[41:27] But
[41:29] they're doing their best to try to calm
[41:32] the situation down because even as a
[41:34] child, they learn how to manipulate
[41:37] parents. They learn how to manipulate
[41:39] other children.
[41:41] And what they're doing is they want
[41:43] their will and if they don't get their
[41:45] will, they do not have peace.
[41:49] Ephesians chapter 2 verse 2 tells us,
[41:52] "Wherein time passed ye walked according
[41:55] to the course of this world, according
[41:58] to the prince of the power of the air,
[42:01] and the spirit that now workketh in the
[42:04] children of disobedience,
[42:07] among whom also we all had our
[42:09] conversation in times past in the lust
[42:13] of our flesh, fulfilling the desires of
[42:15] the flesh and of the mind, and were by
[42:17] nature
[42:18] the very children of wrath even as
[42:22] others. So you see, if I don't get what
[42:25] I want, I'm going to make somebody
[42:26] unhappy until I get what I want.
[42:30] Right? You it's uh and it's always going
[42:34] to be that way. And anytime you stop
[42:36] praying, raft becomes much more
[42:40] preeminent, right? You you go a day
[42:43] without prayer, your wife knows it. You
[42:46] go 2 days, the children know about it.
[42:49] You go 3 days, even the dogs know about
[42:52] it. So you have to continue in prayer so
[42:57] that old nature doesn't just give way to
[43:00] the things of the flesh.
[43:03] It's obvious to see when adults don't
[43:05] get fully converted, they have the same
[43:08] nature of wrath, fulfilling the desires
[43:10] of the flesh and of the mind. People
[43:15] without the spirit of peace inside them
[43:17] can be tormented by the devil. They're
[43:20] an easy an easy target. You need the
[43:23] spirit of peace in you. Can you say amen
[43:25] to that?
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2 tells us that Jesus Christ
[43:30] is our peace.
[43:34] Jesus Christ is our peace. I I Isaiah
[43:38] 9:6 tells us that Jesus Christ is not
[43:41] only the mighty God, but he is the
[43:43] prince of peace.
[43:45] And and and and Jesus said, "My peace I
[43:50] give unto you, not as the world giveth."
[43:52] The way the world gives peace is you got
[43:55] to just manipulate everything. All the
[43:56] circumstances got to be just the way you
[43:58] like them in order for you to feel
[44:00] comfortable and say, "Yeah, I'm having a
[44:02] good day.
[44:04] I'm I'm on a peaceful day. But we don't
[44:08] want that type of peace because very
[44:10] seldom we ever be happy.
[44:13] Very seldom will you ever be at peace.
[44:16] God's peace is so much stronger than the
[44:19] peace that the world gives us. Job said,
[44:22] "Though he slay me, yet will I trust
[44:24] him." The Shudomite woman whose son had
[44:28] just died said to her husband, "All
[44:31] shall be well." and said to Al uh the
[44:35] Elisha's servant, the servant of the
[44:37] prophet, "All is well in the midst of
[44:40] death."
[44:42] And that's the real peace of God.
[44:46] And when Elisha's servant saw the se uh
[44:49] Syrian army had surrounded them, he
[44:52] said, "Alas, master, how shall we do?
[44:55] What's going to happen to us?" and and
[44:57] he answered in 2 Kings chapter 6. He
[45:00] said, "Fear not, for they that be with
[45:02] us are more than they that be with
[45:05] them." He just couldn't see them. The
[45:07] angels are here. We can't see them. In
[45:10] fact, in your homes, the angels of God
[45:12] encamped around them that fear the Lord.
[45:17] And Elisha prayed and said, "Lord, I
[45:20] pray thee, open his eyes that he may
[45:23] see." And the Lord opened the eyes of
[45:25] the young man, and he saw, and behold,
[45:28] the mountains was full of horses and
[45:30] chariots of fire round about Elijah.
[45:34] You know, if God be for you, who can be
[45:36] against you?
[45:38] &gt;&gt; You don't need to have everybody on your
[45:40] bandwagon and agreeing with you. The
[45:43] whole world can be against you and you
[45:45] can still have the peace of God in your
[45:47] heart.
[45:51] &gt;&gt; Peace comes from God.
[45:54] And if we're going to create peace for
[45:56] others, we first have to learn to have
[45:59] peace in ourselves.
[46:03] Jesus said in Matthew 5:9, "Blessed are
[46:06] the peacemakers,
[46:08] for they shall be called the children of
[46:11] God."
[46:13] God's children are peacemakers. And this
[46:17] think about this is the prince of prince
[46:19] of peace standing right there in the
[46:21] biatitudes. He is the prince of peace
[46:24] and he's making this declaration that
[46:26] his own children are going that he calls
[46:30] the children of God. They're going to
[46:32] also be peacemakers
[46:34] because they have the same spirit. It's
[46:37] not a special anointing that's just for
[46:40] certain people.
[46:42] If you're a child of God, you have the
[46:44] spirit of God. If you have the Holy
[46:47] Ghost, one of the fruit of the Holy
[46:48] Spirit is peace, love, joy, peace. So we
[46:54] can also be a peacemaker,
[46:58] a peacemaker.
[47:03] Um Ephesians 2:14 says, "For he is our
[47:07] peace,
[47:09] who have made both one and have broken
[47:13] down the middle wall a partition between
[47:15] us." So Jesus came and he died making
[47:19] peace between us and the father. Amen.
[47:23] having abolished in the his flesh the
[47:25] emnity even the law of the commandments
[47:28] contained in the ordinance for to make
[47:31] in himself of twain one new man so
[47:35] making peace.
[47:38] Now God's children know how to make
[47:41] peace
[47:43] because they have the God of peace
[47:45] inside of them.
[47:47] Psalms 29:1 said, "The Lord will give
[47:51] strength unto his people. The Lord will
[47:54] bless his people with peace."
[47:59] &gt;&gt; It's something that we have because it's
[48:02] a part of God.
[48:04] You can't get You can't have God.
[48:07] Imagine if God cut him. Okay, let me
[48:10] just say this. You have a jar of
[48:13] whatever. Let's just say you have a jar
[48:16] of hot peppers. How about that? Hot
[48:20] peppers.
[48:23] And you take part of that what's in that
[48:26] jar and you put it on the plate over
[48:28] there.
[48:30] You ask, you tell me, are you going to
[48:33] get just
[48:35] part of that flavor?
[48:41] Whatever was in that jar is going to be
[48:43] in that pepper. Are you with me?
[48:47] &gt;&gt; If you've got God in the inside, you've
[48:50] got the peace of God.
[48:54] &gt;&gt; You've got what it takes to take care of
[48:56] situations.
[48:58] You hold that power inside of you. Now,
[49:00] Satan don't want you to know that
[49:04] because it'll expose him.
[49:07] But you have the power because God will
[49:11] bless his people with peace.
[49:15] God's people know how to disassemble
[49:18] walls.
[49:20] They know how to dissolve differences.
[49:23] They know how to focus on the positives.
[49:26] They know how to give a soft answer to
[49:29] turn away wrath. They know how to turn a
[49:32] cheek or go a second mile. They know how
[49:34] to lay down their lives for others. They
[49:37] know how to humbly
[49:39] bow down and wash the dirt off other
[49:42] people's feet.
[49:45] &gt;&gt; They know how to make peace.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 16:7, "When a man's ways please
[49:52] the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to
[49:57] be at peace with him."
[50:01] When a believer submits to the will of
[50:03] God for their life, God is able to make
[50:06] all grace abound unto us.
[50:09] I I I mean, I want that. I want all my
[50:13] ways to please the Lord.
[50:16] I want to be a cash in and not have
[50:19] problems with people.
[50:22] And the word of God is true. The word of
[50:25] God has never lied. It has never failed.
[50:29] If I cannot produce love, joy, peace,
[50:33] longsuffering, gentleness, meekness,
[50:36] temperance, faith, if I can't produce
[50:39] that, then I need more of the Holy Ghost
[50:43] because the word of God has never failed
[50:47] and it cannot fail.
[50:50] Psalms 37:37
[50:54] reads, "Mark
[50:56] the perfect man,
[50:59] and behold the upright, for the end of
[51:03] that man is peace."
[51:07] Peace is important
[51:09] to God. Mark the perfect man. The end of
[51:14] that man is peace.
[51:17] A person who's in love with God wants
[51:20] peace with others. It's just there.
[51:23] A peace in who a person who's not love
[51:25] with God just don't care.
[51:28] For the end of that man is peace. Let's
[51:32] take a look at just the nature of God
[51:34] for a second in Jeremiah 29:11. For I
[51:37] know the thoughts that I think toward
[51:39] you, saith the Lord. Thoughts of peace
[51:44] and not of evil. to give you an expected
[51:49] end. Now, how many has felt the wrath of
[51:54] God upon you before?
[51:59] How many of you been corrected by the
[52:01] Lord before?
[52:04] But in the midst of that, God's thoughts
[52:07] is still to give you an expected end,
[52:11] &gt;&gt; an end of peace.
[52:14] So, we must understand when we're in
[52:17] situations where things
[52:20] are perhaps arguing and fighting and and
[52:23] and somebody's upset with us, God has
[52:28] given you the ability
[52:31] to create a peaceful end.
[52:34] &gt;&gt; And as sure as anything, that is God's
[52:37] truth.
[52:42] God dwells in our heart by faith. And if
[52:45] we can believe, then we can manifest the
[52:49] peace of God.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[52:53] &gt;&gt; God told Joshua, "Nothing shall be able
[52:55] to stand before thee all the days of the
[52:57] life." God wants us to pursue the
[52:59] promised land. And that promised land is
[53:02] peace is mine. Love is mine. Joy is
[53:05] mine. I claim it.
[53:08] Now, the world says, "I want peace, but
[53:11] you got to give it to me."
[53:14] God's children say, "You know what? I
[53:17] got what you're looking for.
[53:20] I got what you're looking for. I can
[53:23] create peace."
[53:25] Brother Brandon says, "We're creators."
[53:28] You know, if you're blessed are the
[53:30] peacemakers. We can make peace where
[53:32] there's no peace.
[53:35] We don't have to wait till there's a
[53:36] peaceful situation.
[53:38] to just kind of put our our little two
[53:40] cents in and, you know, we're going to
[53:42] make this, you know, peaceful.
[53:45] No, give me the greatest turmoil there
[53:47] is and let's get the job done, right?
[53:51] The righteous are as bold as a lion.
[53:53] We're not afraid. God, be not afraid. Be
[53:57] not dismayed. Uh
[54:00] God has left us the peace. We're not
[54:03] left alone.
[54:05] We don't have to figure stuff out on our
[54:07] own. We got God.
[54:10] Psalms 34:14
[54:13] says, "Depart from evil and do good."
[54:19] Semicolon, "Seek peace and pursue it."
[54:26] Seek it.
[54:28] That means you got to go after it.
[54:31] You got to have it in your heart that
[54:33] that's what you want.
[54:36] &gt;&gt; That you want to have peace and you want
[54:38] to you want to have peace for your
[54:40] children and you want peace for your
[54:43] family and you want peace for the church
[54:46] and you want peace for mankind.
[54:49] You know that when Jesus was born that
[54:51] the message came peace on earth,
[54:55] goodwill to all men and and and it is
[54:58] the will of God that we dwell in peace,
[55:03] that we we live in peace. And this
[55:06] scripture is telling us to pursue peace,
[55:11] to seek it, and to pursue it.
[55:16] Go after it. If you want it, you got to
[55:19] go after it. You can't I'm gonna tell
[55:21] you this. You can't sit around and
[55:24] expect it to be some Christmas present
[55:27] given to you, some birthday present,
[55:30] just because your name is John Martin.
[55:32] It ain't going to happen.
[55:34] You you you got to humble yourself and
[55:37] say, "This is mine. This is for me. I
[55:41] claim it in the name of the Lord."
[55:45] Creating peace for your life requires
[55:48] simply the path to peace.
[55:52] You need the path to peace. Every
[55:55] delicious meal has a particular path to
[55:59] get there. It's it's called a recipe.
[56:03] And if you follow the recipe
[56:06] just the way that they made it,
[56:10] it usually turns out pretty good.
[56:13] But how many times have you altered a
[56:16] recipe
[56:17] and it didn't taste quite the same?
[56:22] Maybe you didn't have a certain
[56:23] ingredient and you or you just wanted to
[56:26] kind of well I think this will make it
[56:28] better and it don't turn out just the
[56:30] same. Sister Anne, has that ever
[56:33] happened to you before?
[56:36] So often we want to
[56:40] just change how we're going to do things
[56:44] and still expect there to be peace in
[56:46] the home,
[56:48] still expect to have peace in our heart.
[56:51] You need to follow the path of peace to
[56:55] get peace. This is in here in here in
[57:00] this book is the recipe for peace.
[57:05] There's no other book that tells you the
[57:10] peace of God.
[57:13] So if you deviate from the path of the
[57:16] word
[57:18] or the recipe that's in this book to get
[57:21] peace,
[57:22] then it's not going to turn out right.
[57:24] It's going to be half peace and half
[57:26] wrath.
[57:30] Don't ever say you did what you were
[57:32] supposed to do and somehow you don't got
[57:34] peace.
[57:36] God does not lie.
[57:39] God cannot lie. He will not lie.
[57:44] I think about this
[57:47] here. God is in heaven
[57:51] and Lucifer
[57:53] who just brings total turmoil
[57:57] goes behind the back
[58:00] persuades a third of the angels to
[58:02] leave.
[58:04] It causes confusion in the mind. It's
[58:07] what he did with Eve.
[58:10] And God's at peace.
[58:13] God's at peace. Harry's getting ready to
[58:17] be betrayed. He looks at Judas, calls
[58:21] him his friend,
[58:23] and said, "Whatever thou doest, doest
[58:25] quickly."
[58:27] God is a God of peace. He is not moved.
[58:33] He is not moved. I shall not be moved.
[58:38] Because God is a God of peace. He is the
[58:41] prince of peace. And when the prince of
[58:42] peace lives in you, he brings peace with
[58:45] him.
[58:47] &gt;&gt; He brings it into your life. He brings
[58:50] it into your mind. He brings it into
[58:52] your heart.
[58:58] Though he slay me, I'm still going to
[59:00] trust him.
[59:03] Though I get spit on the face, though
[59:05] whatever God does to me, but the prophet
[59:08] said, "If he chose to send me to hell, I
[59:11] would gladly serve him there."
[59:16] &gt;&gt; He had peace. People are leaving this
[59:19] message. I got peace, brother. I got
[59:22] peace, sister. I know that I know what
[59:25] I'm attached to. I know what I belong
[59:27] to.
[59:29] I know that he's able to keep that which
[59:31] I have committed unto him against that
[59:34] day.
[59:37] &gt;&gt; God is greater than all our situations.
[59:44] So if you want more peace in your life,
[59:47] we need to create an atmosphere of love,
[59:51] a love for God. We got to create that
[59:53] atmosphere. Just this is the bottom
[59:55] line. We read it in our opening
[59:56] scripture.
[59:59] If we want more peace in our life, we
[1:00:01] have to create an atmosphere of the love
[1:00:04] of God around us.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; In our mind, in our heart, in our
[1:00:09] spirit, in our behavior, in the way we
[1:00:12] think, the way we talk, the way we act.
[1:00:16] If you focus on the love of God, peace.
[1:00:20] I you just how in the world can we
[1:00:22] expect to have peace when we don't even
[1:00:25] love?
[1:00:28] First is love, then joy, then peace.
[1:00:34] We need to pursue love, a love for the
[1:00:36] truth, a love for doing right, and peace
[1:00:39] will surely meet us there.
[1:00:43] It's hard to create peace when you're
[1:00:45] not in love with the prince of peace.
[1:00:52] Psalms 85:10
[1:00:55] says, "Mercy and truth are met together.
[1:01:01] Righteousness and peace have kissed each
[1:01:04] other.
[1:01:07] A love to do the right thing and peace.
[1:01:11] They just kiss. They come together.
[1:01:14] And if you continue to love God's law,
[1:01:17] you will create the greatest peace for
[1:01:20] your personal life.
[1:01:23] You do not have to wait till everybody
[1:01:26] likes you. To everybody's giving you
[1:01:29] what you want.
[1:01:32] All you have to do is fall in love with
[1:01:35] the word of God and peace is going to
[1:01:38] kiss you. Yeah. Yeah.
[1:01:42] &gt;&gt; James 3:8. We read this. This came up in
[1:01:46] our our men's meeting. I stuck it in
[1:01:49] here. It wasn't part of the original,
[1:01:50] but it goes with it. And the fruit of
[1:01:54] righteousness is sown in peace of them
[1:01:58] that make peace.
[1:02:01] The fruit of righteousness is is sown.
[1:02:05] It's it a person who's pursuing the
[1:02:09] right thing to that, you know, treating
[1:02:12] one another right and and and and and
[1:02:15] being merciful and and and and turning
[1:02:18] the cheek and and and and learning to
[1:02:20] give a soft answer that that
[1:02:23] righteousness is sewn in them that make
[1:02:27] peace.
[1:02:29] We're creators.
[1:02:31] I'd rather have peace in my heart than
[1:02:34] all what the world could give me.
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; All the money
[1:02:42] to be able to
[1:02:45] to be at peace,
[1:02:48] to not have ill towards my neighbor,
[1:02:52] to not have a a rooe of bitterness
[1:02:55] spring up and spoil many.
[1:02:59] Give me the peace of God. Take this
[1:03:02] whole world, but give me Jesus.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:03:07] &gt;&gt; Proverbs chapter 3 verse one says, "My
[1:03:09] son,
[1:03:11] forget not my law,
[1:03:14] but let them keep but let thine heart
[1:03:21] keep my commandments
[1:03:25] for length of days and long life." and
[1:03:30] peace
[1:03:32] shall they add to thee.
[1:03:37] Too often when there's turmoil, we're
[1:03:39] just trying to straighten out the
[1:03:40] turmoil
[1:03:43] and we're neglecting
[1:03:46] what God is wanting us to do.
[1:03:50] We got to keep
[1:03:52] God first
[1:03:55] in our life. Amen.
[1:03:58] Are you getting something out of this?
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:03] &gt;&gt; Psalms 119
[1:04:06] verse 165 says, "Great peace have they
[1:04:12] which love thy law and nothing shall
[1:04:17] offend them."
[1:04:21] to be so in love with the word of God
[1:04:26] that no matter what anybody ever does to
[1:04:28] you, it will not move you.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; You will not get hurt. You will not get
[1:04:35] offended.
[1:04:37] You will not feel stung and wish you
[1:04:40] could just, you know, get this thing
[1:04:42] straight.
[1:04:45] That's how priceless it is to be in love
[1:04:49] with the word of God.
[1:04:52] Great peace. Not a little peace. Great
[1:04:55] peace. Have they
[1:04:58] want more peace? Love the word.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Pursue the word. Pursue a relationship
[1:05:05] with Jesus that you don't have.
[1:05:10] When you have the peace of God, you're
[1:05:12] not going to be offended with things.
[1:05:17] Notice people who murmur and complain
[1:05:19] about things are people who are lacking
[1:05:22] peace.
[1:05:25] You just think about the people who just
[1:05:27] murmur. They're complaining. They got a
[1:05:28] problem with this person in the church.
[1:05:30] They got a problem with that person in
[1:05:32] the church. They got a problem with the
[1:05:34] way the preach the the the pastor is.
[1:05:36] They got a a problem the way the the the
[1:05:38] the
[1:05:40] I could say that about me because I can
[1:05:43] do that. But it's usually those people
[1:05:47] who do not have peace
[1:05:50] that they that they they don't seem to
[1:05:51] offer anything to help. They just tell
[1:05:54] you how things ought to be and what you
[1:05:56] need to do.
[1:05:58] It's like they don't understand where
[1:06:00] they fit into the body. They don't
[1:06:03] understand that the body washes the
[1:06:05] body. They don't understand about
[1:06:07] supplying to every joint what is needed.
[1:06:10] They just, you know, you you it's your
[1:06:14] problem and you deal with it.
[1:06:20] Great peace have they that love the law
[1:06:21] and nothing shall offend them. All
[1:06:25] right. You know, we're going to get out
[1:06:27] of here early tonight. By the grace of
[1:06:28] God, I want to do that. It's such a good
[1:06:32] feeling for a pastor to to let out early
[1:06:34] on a Wednesday.
[1:06:36] &gt;&gt; I want to do that. So pray for me that I
[1:06:39] get it done because that's my heart's
[1:06:41] desire. But turn with me to Proverbs
[1:06:44] chapter 3 verse number 13
[1:06:49] because we're talking about getting
[1:06:50] peace right
[1:06:54] and knowing me after saying that I'll
[1:06:56] probably be five minutes late just
[1:07:00] knowing me.
[1:07:03] Proverbs chapter 3:13 says, "Happy is
[1:07:06] the man that findeth wisdom
[1:07:10] and the man that getth understanding."
[1:07:14] Proverbs 2 tells us that
[1:07:17] you have to if you want the real wisdom
[1:07:20] of God, you got to search for her like
[1:07:23] silver and gold. You got to really hunt
[1:07:26] for it like a hid treasure. All right.
[1:07:29] Proverbs 3:14. For the merchandise
[1:07:33] of this wisdom is better than the
[1:07:36] merchandise of silver, and the gain
[1:07:39] thereof than fine gold.
[1:07:43] She is more precious than rubies, and
[1:07:46] all the things that could be desired are
[1:07:50] not
[1:07:51] to be compared
[1:07:54] with wisdom.
[1:07:58] length of days is in her right hand
[1:08:03] and in her left hand is riches and
[1:08:05] honor.
[1:08:07] Her ways
[1:08:11] are the ways of plentess
[1:08:14] and all her paths are peace.
[1:08:22] wisdom.
[1:08:25] All the paths of wisdom
[1:08:29] lead to peace.
[1:08:31] That's just all there is to it. You want
[1:08:34] to know about the wisdom of the world,
[1:08:39] there's envy, there's strife, there's
[1:08:41] there's fighting, there's arguing. But
[1:08:43] you go to James and James tells us that
[1:08:47] the wisdom that's from ab above is first
[1:08:50] pure, peaceable,
[1:08:52] gentle, easy to be entreated.
[1:08:55] You're not going to find
[1:08:58] God, the wisdom of God without a path of
[1:09:02] peace.
[1:09:07] She is a tree of life
[1:09:10] to them that lay hold on upon her. And
[1:09:13] happy is everyone that can retain it.
[1:09:16] We've all had experiences where we had
[1:09:19] the wisdom of God kind of protrude forth
[1:09:22] from us when we were handling a
[1:09:24] situation. But that doesn't mean we've
[1:09:27] retained it. We got to we got to retain
[1:09:30] wisdom.
[1:09:32] Amen.
[1:09:34] So when we think of creating peace in
[1:09:36] our lives, we want to think about the
[1:09:39] things that bring peace, the things that
[1:09:44] cultivate peace. And
[1:09:48] to love to to love God is is truly
[1:09:54] number one. Jesus said it. It's said
[1:09:56] here in the scriptures. And the wisdom
[1:09:59] of God is really the the the fear of the
[1:10:02] Lord, right? It's the beginning of
[1:10:04] wisdom.
[1:10:06] And that that fear of the Lord is I
[1:10:08] could be wrong how I'm pursuing what I'm
[1:10:10] looking at, how I'm viewing this. Maybe
[1:10:12] I'm leaning to my own understanding. And
[1:10:15] I I need the wisdom of God. I I could be
[1:10:18] wrong. And in that the wisdom of God
[1:10:22] will always lead to a path of peace.
[1:10:28] So the recipe
[1:10:32] of of
[1:10:34] uh peace, the path of peace,
[1:10:38] we need to
[1:10:40] have peace in our life so we can create
[1:10:42] peace in situations. God wants to use
[1:10:46] you to help situations in the church.
[1:10:49] God does not want to use you to tell
[1:10:51] about all the bad situations in the
[1:10:53] church. You don't even needed to do
[1:10:55] that.
[1:10:57] not needed to do that. The devil can do
[1:11:00] that. He's the accuser of the brethren.
[1:11:04] But what we're needed is we're needing
[1:11:06] peacemakers. We're needing people that
[1:11:09] know how to take situations and get them
[1:11:11] worked out.
[1:11:16] Isaiah 26:3 says, "Thou will keep him in
[1:11:21] perfect peace whose mind is stayed on
[1:11:24] thee.
[1:11:26] because he trustth in thee.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; That's why Job who had everything taken
[1:11:31] away from him could say, "Though he slay
[1:11:34] me, I'm still going to trust him."
[1:11:37] He was kept in perfect peace. He didn't
[1:11:40] have everything laid out for him nice.
[1:11:43] He didn't have everybody fixed their
[1:11:44] problems.
[1:11:47] No, even his own wife turned against
[1:11:49] him.
[1:11:52] False accusers were accusing him. But he
[1:11:55] still held the peace of God inside of
[1:11:58] him. Because peace is on the inside.
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; And if God dwells in your heart by
[1:12:05] faith, then you claim the peace of God
[1:12:07] in your life. You have every right to
[1:12:10] tell the devil to get behind you. You
[1:12:13] have every right to rebuke the devil
[1:12:15] when he comes to you with tormenting
[1:12:16] thoughts.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; Get behind me, Satan.
[1:12:22] God has allowed the enemy
[1:12:25] to battle because he's he wants us, his
[1:12:29] children, his bride, to have the
[1:12:31] character to take the sword of the word
[1:12:34] and to kick the devil out of our lives.
[1:12:38] You don't need a perfect child to have
[1:12:40] peace in your home. You don't need a
[1:12:42] perfect parent in your home to have
[1:12:45] peace. What you need is a perfect God
[1:12:48] living inside your heart. That's what
[1:12:50] you need.
[1:12:53] Proverbs 11:12 says,
[1:12:56] "He that is void of wisdom
[1:13:00] despiseth his neighbor,
[1:13:05] but a man of understanding
[1:13:07] holdeth his peace.
[1:13:13] A tailbearer revealth secrets,
[1:13:17] but he that is of a faithful spirit, he
[1:13:20] concealth a matter.
[1:13:23] You know, the nature of God is not
[1:13:27] God's going to tell me everybody else is
[1:13:31] bad.
[1:13:33] That is not the nature of God.
[1:13:38] The nature of God is going to deal with
[1:13:41] individually.
[1:13:43] We humble ourselves before God. We deal
[1:13:46] with situations and then he conceals it.
[1:13:50] Right? It's under the blood. We move
[1:13:53] forward.
[1:13:56] That's the proper way.
[1:14:02] We don't want to be on the devil's side
[1:14:04] and be a tail bear bearer talk about
[1:14:08] people's problems.
[1:14:10] We don't need talkers. We need helpers.
[1:14:13] We need peace. Blessed are the
[1:14:15] peacemakers. It doesn't say blessed are
[1:14:18] the tailbears.
[1:14:21] The peacemakers.
[1:14:24] All right. Turn with me to Philippians
[1:14:25] chapter 4. Because if we don't hurry,
[1:14:28] you know what's going to happen?
[1:14:32] Philippians chapter 4. We can't talk
[1:14:34] about peace without trying to get this
[1:14:37] scripture in here because it's not we're
[1:14:40] already talking about peace, but we're
[1:14:41] already talking about creating being a
[1:14:44] creator of peace. Because sometimes
[1:14:47] things are just in turmoil and we want
[1:14:49] the peace of God, but the only way we
[1:14:51] know to get it is by manipulating
[1:14:55] certain sit situations or just standing
[1:14:57] there and wish somebody would do it for
[1:14:58] you. But I'm telling you, we all have
[1:15:00] the power of God in our life. We all can
[1:15:03] create peace. Philippians 4:6, be
[1:15:06] careful for nothing. Just follow this
[1:15:09] recipe.
[1:15:11] But in everything by prayer and
[1:15:12] supplication,
[1:15:14] and don't forget to be thankful with
[1:15:16] thanksgiving, let all your requests be
[1:15:19] made known unto God. Just bring it to
[1:15:22] God in prayer.
[1:15:25] But don't don't come to them with a
[1:15:27] complaint list, a bucket.
[1:15:30] You literally got to say, "God, thank
[1:15:32] you for taking care of this situation. I
[1:15:34] believe in you. I believe that you you
[1:15:38] care about me.
[1:15:41] And if you do this, the Bible declares,
[1:15:45] "The peace of God which passes all
[1:15:49] understanding shall keep your hearts and
[1:15:53] minds through Christ Jesus."
[1:15:56] That's why I would not trade the peace
[1:15:58] of God for anything
[1:16:02] because it even passes understanding
[1:16:06] when something happens in our life and
[1:16:08] we don't understand why it happened.
[1:16:11] We can have peace. We don't need to
[1:16:13] understand why it happened.
[1:16:16] You know, God doesn't tell us what he he
[1:16:19] doesn't tell us everything. I think the
[1:16:21] prophet said that God didn't tell him
[1:16:23] everything.
[1:16:27] That's what makes him so beautiful. He's
[1:16:30] God. He don't owe us anything. We owe
[1:16:33] him everything. Amen.
[1:16:37] &gt;&gt; But he gave us something that is so much
[1:16:39] richer
[1:16:42] than why
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; which is a peace that you don't need to
[1:16:47] know the why.
[1:16:49] A peace that passes all understanding.
[1:16:54] Praise his holy name today.
[1:16:57] Finally, brethren, finally,
[1:17:01] whatsoever things are true,
[1:17:04] whatsoever things are honest,
[1:17:07] whatsoever things are just, whatsoever
[1:17:11] things are pure,
[1:17:13] whatsoever things are lovely,
[1:17:16] whatsoever things are of a good report,
[1:17:19] if there be any strength,
[1:17:23] if there be any praise,
[1:17:26] then you can think on these things.
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; But if it doesn't pass the recipe test,
[1:17:35] don't think on it because it's going to
[1:17:39] bring turmoil
[1:17:41] into your life.
[1:17:43] And once the devil starts stirring up
[1:17:45] your mind, watch out.
[1:17:50] How many has has has said this?
[1:17:55] I don't like watching those horror
[1:17:57] movies because they give me
[1:18:02] uh make me have nightmares at night. Has
[1:18:05] anybody ever said that? Okay.
[1:18:09] I don't know if it was maybe Cheryl said
[1:18:12] I I will not watch Jaws
[1:18:16] or or
[1:18:17] the the point that I'm trying to say is
[1:18:20] what you put in your mind.
[1:18:22] It's an open door for the devil to use
[1:18:25] against you. You know how it goes. What
[1:18:29] watch what you say, what you do say
[1:18:34] can and will be used against you in a
[1:18:36] court of law.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; So you got to be careful what you think
[1:18:41] on.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; If it don't pass the test, get it out of
[1:18:45] your mind. No fish in here.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; Get behind me, Satan. My mind belongs to
[1:18:53] God.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And we've got to be strong to keep our
[1:18:59] thoughts stayed on him.
[1:19:02] &gt;&gt; We can't just be lazy in our mind and
[1:19:05] expect, you know, God to just give us
[1:19:07] peace. Verse
[1:19:10] nine, these things, those things which
[1:19:14] you have both learned and received and
[1:19:16] heard basically the recipe and seen in
[1:19:18] me. Do do the recipe and the God of
[1:19:22] peace shall be with you.
[1:19:26] How beautiful is that?
[1:19:33] Peace I leave with you. My peace I give
[1:19:37] unto you.
[1:19:38] wouldn't trade it for anything. Just
[1:19:40] want to quote this last verse here. It's
[1:19:43] in Psalms 122:6.
[1:19:45] Just speaking again about the
[1:19:49] the God of peace. It says, "Pray for the
[1:19:53] peace of Jerusalem.
[1:19:56] Pray for the peace of Jerusalem.
[1:20:01] They shall prosper that love thee.
[1:20:06] Peace be within thy walls and prosperity
[1:20:10] within thy palaces.
[1:20:14] God,
[1:20:16] if we simply use this recipe and care
[1:20:20] about God's people,
[1:20:22] the Jews,
[1:20:25] that God promised that there would be
[1:20:27] peace in your own home.
[1:20:31] I believe in the peace of the Gentiles,
[1:20:33] too.
[1:20:37] I think one of the kind of a personal
[1:20:42] testimony.
[1:20:44] I think one of the things that have
[1:20:46] blessed me
[1:20:49] a lot
[1:20:51] is when people would come in our home,
[1:20:55] in our house, and they would say, "It's
[1:20:58] feels so peaceful in here.
[1:21:05] There's something about the atmosphere
[1:21:08] that you create and I'll say it. It
[1:21:11] starts like this.
[1:21:15] It starts in your heart by believing.
[1:21:20] If you believe in your heart, your mind
[1:21:23] will think it.
[1:21:25] Your thoughts will be thoughts of peace.
[1:21:28] Your actions, your behavior will be
[1:21:32] actions of peace. Your behavior will be
[1:21:35] behavior of peace. And your home will
[1:21:38] become a home of peace.
[1:21:42] And then you bring that home to the
[1:21:45] church because all we are is a
[1:21:49] combination of all of our homes.
[1:21:53] We're a combination of all of our homes.
[1:21:57] and and and and God has told us to come
[1:22:00] together, pray one for another.
[1:22:04] Don't have the isms and schisms and all
[1:22:07] the things of the negativity about
[1:22:09] somebody in the church. We ought to be
[1:22:12] far enough along in Christ
[1:22:16] to know how to help somebody.
[1:22:19] If we don't, I think we got to get back
[1:22:21] on our knees and get back to the first
[1:22:24] principles of believing in Jesus Christ.
[1:22:28] Amen. Let's stand together. We can
[1:22:30] create peace for our lives. It doesn't
[1:22:34] matter what anybody else does to us, we
[1:22:37] can create a peaceful life for oursel.
[1:22:41] Just follow the recipe for the peace of
[1:22:44] God and be a peacemaker.
[1:22:47] It is that simple. We just have to
[1:22:51] believe it. Amen. Let's sing that
[1:22:53] course. There's a peace in knowing.
[1:22:58] There's a peace in knowing.
[1:23:05] There's
[1:23:07] a peace
[1:23:10] in
[1:23:12] knowing
[1:23:14] that the wind
[1:23:16] is blowing
[1:23:20] a mighty
[1:23:22] rushing wind from up above.
[1:23:31] Oh holy spirit
[1:23:36] descend
[1:23:38] like a dove
[1:23:41] and abide
[1:23:44] today
[1:23:46] in my soul.
[1:23:50] [Music]
[1:23:51] There's a peace in knowing
[1:23:58] that the wind is blowing.
[1:24:03] A mighty rushing wind from up above.
[1:24:14] Oh, Holy Spirit
[1:24:19] descend
[1:24:21] like a dove
[1:24:23] and abide
[1:24:27] today
[1:24:29] in my soul.
[1:24:34] Amen. Is that your desire?
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every day to have the peace of
[1:24:39] God. You You're very rich. You're very
[1:24:42] rich. Amen. And let's sing. He is our

[1:31:37] when you left,
