[18:07] like to change your order of service
[18:08] amen let's just remember all those that

[18:24] know we all have a desire to be here but
[18:28] uh I think God give wisdom to you know
[18:30] like Brother Bruce said you know we're
[18:32] here so whether you leave 5 minutes from
[18:35] now or you leave later on you still got
[18:38] to ride home so you know get get all you
[18:41] can get while you can get it that's all
[18:43] I can say and uh but we do pray for
[18:47] those that are on the roads those that
[18:48] are when we leave here let's uh ever be
[18:51] so mindful to
[18:53] uh uh put the Lord in a driver's seat
[18:57] amen not only in our lives but in these

[37:23] blessings now on your people upon your
[37:26] word as we commit the service to you in
[37:28] Jesus Christ's name we pray
[37:31] amen amen 2 Timothy chapter 3 starting
[37:34] with verse number 10 but thou has fully
[37:36] known my Doctrine manner of life purpose
[37:40] Faith longsuffering
[37:42] charity
[37:44] patience persecutions afflictions which
[37:48] came unto me at Antioch ionium listra
[37:52] what persecutions I endured but out of
[37:55] them all the Lord delivered me that's
[37:58] right yay and all that will live Godly
[38:00] in Christ Jesus are going to suffer the
[38:04] same
[38:05] persecutions but evil men and seducers
[38:08] shall wax worse and worse deceiving and
[38:11] being deceived but continue thou in the
[38:14] things which thou has learned and has
[38:16] been assured of knowing of whom thou has
[38:19] learned them and that from a child thou
[38:21] has known the holy scriptures which are
[38:23] able to make thee wise unto salvation
[38:26] through faith which in Christ Jesus all
[38:29] scripture is given by inspiration of God
[38:33] and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro
[38:36] for correction for instruction in
[38:39] righteousness that the man of God may be
[38:41] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[38:43] good works amen God bless you you may be
[38:46] seated may the Lord just open this word
[38:48] to us
[38:51] today we want to entitle this message
[38:54] profitability profitability
[38:58] Proverbs 14:23 says in all labor there
[39:01] is profit in all labor there is profit
[39:04] but the talk of the lips tendeth only to
[39:08] peny or poverty we might interpret
[39:13] that so there's one thing to hear the
[39:16] word and another thing to do the word am
[39:20] just hearing it it's going to be like
[39:22] poverty to us spiritually but to
[39:24] actually labor to enter into the rest I
[39:27] like how the scripture says let us labor
[39:29] to enter into God's rest I like I like
[39:31] to view it like this where is God
[39:34] resting where is God
[39:37] resting because you the devil's out as a
[39:39] Roy lion and he's attacking the bride
[39:41] and he's attacking the church and all
[39:43] these things are happening but where is
[39:46] God resting where's his safe place it's
[39:50] in his word amen and and and Paul says
[39:54] let us labor to enter into God's rest
[39:56] the same place where God's resting we
[39:58] can
[39:59] rest Amen brother bam says we come to
[40:03] church to learn or to discover where
[40:06] we're really standing with
[40:09] God Jesus said the scriptures tell us
[40:13] who God is and if we're truly in the
[40:17] place of eternal life and he gives the
[40:19] scriptures in John 5:39 search the
[40:21] scriptures for in them you think you
[40:23] have eternal life but they are they that
[40:26] testify of me and ye will not come to me
[40:29] that you might have life so there's so
[40:32] many people who who do not search the
[40:35] scriptures they just go to church right
[40:38] they're depending on what's being said
[40:42] and of course uh a preacher that just
[40:44] wants to build the church or get money
[40:47] or their focus is on people they're not
[40:50] going to share all the word they're just
[40:52] going to share what the people are
[40:54] really liking are you with me but but
[40:58] there's we need to live by every word of
[41:01] God so we need to search the scriptures
[41:03] it's in the scriptures and and the and
[41:06] the and the Bible says that the
[41:08] scripture is given by the inspiration of
[41:14] God the scriptures are our only absolute
[41:18] amen it is the pure unadulterated
[41:21] perfect complete word of almighty God in
[41:25] the beginning was the word the word was
[41:27] with God the Word was God
[41:29] and and it it will never
[41:33] change it can't be approved
[41:37] upon it can't get better over time
[41:41] amen and you you you can't reason with
[41:45] it you can't kind of make things better
[41:50] you just
[41:52] can't Psalms 119 says forever oh Lord
[41:56] Thy word is settled in heaven amen Jesus
[42:00] said Heaven and Earth will pass away but
[42:03] my word shall never pass
[42:08] away Proverbs 1:19 says Thy word is a
[42:11] lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[42:13] path the word of God is what we need
[42:16] it's profitable for our
[42:20] lives it's profitable for our lives it
[42:23] is a lamp to show us you know I
[42:25] understand that your particular
[42:27] situation isn't in one of the scriptures
[42:30] in the
[42:31] Bible like there you'll never find a
[42:33] scripture that says um trusted tool is
[42:37] is going to be on U over there and the
[42:40] house is going to be over there and
[42:41] you're going to be make making cookies
[42:42] this day and you're going to get them to
[42:43] your customers that day and you're going
[42:45] to have a problem over here and you're
[42:46] going to get sick no it doesn't say
[42:50] that but it it gives what you need how
[42:53] to handle whatever is going on Amen it
[42:56] is profitable handle it and I don't care
[42:59] if you don't got no money I don't care
[43:01] if you don't got no friends I don't care
[43:03] what you don't got the word tells us
[43:06] what we need to do that we may profit in
[43:08] our situation we're not left in a place
[43:11] that we don't have help we don't have to
[43:13] say well God's word don't work I need to
[43:15] profit
[43:17] myself that's the worst thing that's
[43:19] what we came out of Amen I mean you look
[43:22] at Saul we talked about Saul Saul was a
[43:25] man who profited himself
[43:27] is that what he said he profited that's
[43:29] the word he
[43:30] used but he had to counted all loss he
[43:33] had to give up all his profit that he
[43:35] might gain Christ and that's putting
[43:36] your trust in the scriptures
[43:39] amen Jesus said in John 12:46 I am come
[43:43] a light into the world now remember the
[43:45] word is a is a lamp to our feet a light
[43:48] to our path I have come a light into the
[43:50] world that whosoever believeth on me
[43:52] should not abide in darkness so the the
[43:55] fact that we come to church hear the
[43:57] word God does not want us to remain in
[43:59] that
[44:00] condition he wants he wants us to take
[44:03] the word and walk in the light amen and
[44:05] if any man hear my words and believe not
[44:08] I judge him not for I came not to judge
[44:10] the world it's not the right time but to
[44:12] save the
[44:14] world but he says he that rejecteth me
[44:18] and receiveth not my words has one that
[44:21] judgeth him the word that I have spoken
[44:24] the same shall judge him in the last day
[44:27] am so it's better to walk in the light
[44:29] now than to walk in darkness and in the
[44:32] day of judgment light come and judge
[44:35] you amen condemn Me to Hell turn with me
[44:39] if you would or if any could put up
[44:41] there re uh Revelations chapter 20 verse
[44:43] 20 verse 11 Revelations
[44:46] 20:1 we're just trying to lay a
[44:48] foundation that the word is our absolute
[44:51] we need the word of God it we need to be
[44:54] dressed in it we we need to be that need
[44:57] needs to be the core of our home of Our
[44:59] Lives the decisions we make whether or
[45:01] not we're going to pay our ties come to
[45:04] church we need the word of God to be our
[45:06] absolute we can't just take part of the
[45:08] word and figure you know our idea and
[45:10] our reasoning is better than the word of
[45:13] God Revelation 20:1 says and I saw a
[45:17] great white throne and him that sat on
[45:21] it from whose face the earth and the
[45:23] heavens fled away and they there was
[45:27] found no place for them and I saw the
[45:30] dead small and great stand before God
[45:34] and the books were opened and another
[45:37] book was opened which is The Book of
[45:39] Life and the
[45:41] Dead uh were judged out of those things
[45:46] which were written in the books
[45:47] according to their
[45:49] works and the Sea gave up the dead which
[45:52] were in it and the de and death and Hell
[45:54] delivered up the dead were were in them
[45:57] and they were judged every man according
[46:01] to their works and death and hell were
[46:04] cast in Lake of Fire this is the second
[46:06] death and whosoever was not found
[46:08] written in the Book of Life was cast
[46:10] into the Lake of Fire now notice I just
[46:12] want to say this this was one of the
[46:14] books that was
[46:16] there on the day of judgment it was this
[46:19] book this is the book that's there yeah
[46:23] we have a book with our names written on
[46:25] themen
[46:27] but we also have this book because this
[46:29] book is what everybody's being judged by
[46:32] the same book that we read by today amen
[46:36] the the the word of God the word that
[46:39] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[46:40] word will never pass away the word that
[46:42] I spoke unto you the same shall judge
[46:44] you in the last day what an honor it is
[46:47] just to come into church and hear the
[46:49] word of God being preached the same one
[46:51] that'll be spoken to everybody in the
[46:52] day of
[46:55] judgment Mal CH
[46:59] 4:1 for behold the day cometh that shall
[47:03] burn as an
[47:05] oven and all the proud yay and all that
[47:08] do wickedly shall be stubble and the day
[47:12] that cometh shall burn them up sayeth
[47:15] the Lord of hosts that it shall leave
[47:17] them neither root nor Branch but unto
[47:20] you that fear my name that that that
[47:23] that take the word of God seriously
[47:26] shall the son of righteousness arise
[47:28] with healing in his wings he shall go
[47:30] forth and grow grow up as calves of the
[47:35] stall I we're talking about growing in
[47:38] the things of God
[47:40] Amen and you shall tread down the wicked
[47:43] for they shall be ashes Under The Souls
[47:45] of your feet in the day that I do this
[47:47] sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the
[47:49] law of Moses my servant remember which I
[47:53] commanded unto him in Horeb for all
[47:56] Israel
[47:57] uh with the statutes and the judgments
[48:00] remember now so so Matthew this is the
[48:02] last chapter now in the Old Testament
[48:05] and Malachi is is is reminding of
[48:08] reminding us here almost here at the end
[48:11] of the book at the end of the book I
[48:13] want you do you remember the law of
[48:15] Moses the the law I gave him on the on
[48:18] on the mountain well what did he give on
[48:20] that mountain he gave the Ten
[48:21] Commandments and these Ten Commandments
[48:24] were for the people to follow
[48:27] why is he saying that why is he saying
[48:29] do you remember my servant Moses I I I
[48:33] gave him the law for the people why
[48:35] because the next
[48:37] verse behold I will send to you Elijah
[48:40] the prophet before the coming of the
[48:43] great and Dreadful day of the Lord he's
[48:45] coming with the same
[48:48] message here's the here's the things
[48:50] that you need to do to make it out of
[48:52] here to make it into your Promised Land
[48:59] and he shall turn the hearts of the
[49:00] fathers to the children the heart of the
[49:03] children to their fathers lest I come
[49:05] and smite the Earth with a curse people
[49:09] wonder what so why was it so important
[49:11] to bring to have brother brandham why
[49:14] did God send brother brandham to the the
[49:17] to the Earth because if he didn't he
[49:19] would Smite the Earth with a curse
[49:21] that's
[49:24] right so the people that that don't
[49:27] understand the importance of of of the
[49:30] of the Prophet that God uh prophesied
[49:33] right here in the word of God that was
[49:35] to come before the great and Dreadful of
[49:37] the day of the Lord it is important to
[49:39] get into that message to hear the tapes
[49:41] and and not just to say you've listened
[49:43] to them or you got you know a little bit
[49:45] something out of it but but there's
[49:48] something in that word that's going to
[49:49] keep you from the curse
[49:58] I I I just want to let you know I'm kind
[49:59] of enjoying the word tonight I don't
[50:01] know if you are but I'm enjoying the
[50:02] word
[50:06] tonight second Timothy let's go back to
[50:09] our opening scriptures here we need the
[50:13] word of God we need the word that was
[50:15] sent in this hour because it opened up
[50:18] what this book that we're going to be
[50:20] judged
[50:21] by in other words when brother Brandon
[50:24] went beyond the um curtain of time and
[50:26] he's standing there and they told him
[50:29] you're going to be judged with your
[50:30] people right and he said will Paul be
[50:34] judged said yeah Paul's going to be
[50:37] judged that's right that's right it will
[50:40] Paul make it yes Paul will make it well
[50:44] he said you know I preach the same thing
[50:46] that Paul preached right here out of
[50:47] second
[50:48] Timothy he he said everybody all those
[50:51] that came in through this age said we're
[50:54] resting on that yes that's what we're
[50:57] resting on is that the prophet in this
[50:59] age really told us what the bible really
[51:02] meant opened it up to us we need
[51:08] it I wouldn't be here where I'm at
[51:11] without this
[51:13] message second Timothy chap 3:1 says
[51:17] this know also that in the last days
[51:19] perilous time shall come speaking of the
[51:22] Church of leoda for men shall be lovers
[51:25] of their own self
[51:28] bolsters proud
[51:31] disobedient to parents unthankful
[51:36] Unholy without natural affection truth
[51:39] Breakers false accusers incontinent
[51:42] Fierce despisers of those that are good
[51:45] doesn't sound like a church full of good
[51:46] people does it
[51:49] traitors hady high-minded lovers of
[51:52] pleasure more than lovers of God having
[51:54] a just a form of godliness
[51:57] acting like it but denying the power of
[52:00] the Holy Ghost from such you need to
[52:04] turn
[52:05] away don't be friends with that don't be
[52:09] friends with that don't hang oh yeah you
[52:11] know we just have a good time you know
[52:13] turn away from that don't let that
[52:16] Spirit get on
[52:18] you verse seven ever learning these
[52:21] people are ever learning but they're
[52:23] never able to come to the real knowledge
[52:27] of what the word of God means amen and
[52:30] he says here in in verse eight talking
[52:33] going back to Moses here now as Janice
[52:37] and jambus with stod Moses so do these
[52:43] these people that we're talking about
[52:45] the spirit that gets on people so do
[52:47] these also resist the
[52:50] truth they
[52:52] resisted men of corrupt Minds reprobate
[52:56] con earning the faith you try telling
[52:58] somebody this is what you need to do and
[53:00] they resist you it's the same thing as
[53:03] these two people that with stood
[53:07] Moses it's not outside
[53:10] there it could be right Among Us it's a
[53:13] spirit that will receive the word of
[53:16] God and it's not about identifying Bob
[53:19] or Ted it's a spirit that gets on Bob or
[53:23] Ted and when it's there you just you you
[53:26] you have to get away from that thing am
[53:29] you give them the word if they don't
[53:30] take the word you get away from it you
[53:32] keep your standard with the word of God
[53:34] you keep the
[53:38] scriptures because look we you know some
[53:40] of us dwell with and and have family
[53:43] members and and relatives and things
[53:45] like that that that that don't want to
[53:47] walk in on the word you need to you need
[53:49] to make it sure that the scriptures is
[53:52] is totally inspired to you you live by
[53:54] them they mean everything they are
[53:56] profit Prof itable for Doctor they're
[53:57] profitable for your life if they don't
[54:00] want to believe it they don't want to
[54:02] believe it that's up to them but it's
[54:04] important because God's looking at you
[54:06] and every man will be judged according
[54:09] to his
[54:10] works not your wives not your husbands
[54:14] not your mom and dads your
[54:18] works it needs to be that
[54:22] serious verse 13 but evil men
[54:26] oh these evil men and seducers shall wax
[54:31] worse and
[54:33] worse deceiving and being
[54:37] deceived there evil people are just
[54:40] going to get worse and worse isn't at
[54:41] the time I mean I mean they used to be
[54:43] in a closet what how many years ago now
[54:46] you're bad for being in a
[54:49] closet right you mean we talked about in
[54:52] in our our men's meeting that
[54:58] you're persecuted for being a Christian
[55:00] we read it right here in the scriptures
[55:01] you're literally persecuted for speaking
[55:04] about
[55:05] Jesus but they just are openly they
[55:07] don't care what they look like and they
[55:09] don't care if it they're women women men
[55:11] with men they they they don't care right
[55:13] out in the open I'm a boy I'm a girl I'm
[55:16] different every day I I sleep on a cat
[55:20] I I'm married to this that's okay to be
[55:24] in public and don't say anything about
[55:25] it but I'll p Ute you if you're a
[55:27] Christian you can tell it's the devil
[55:29] that's persecuting the
[55:33] Christian and it's up to us every day we
[55:36] take a stand Jesus said if you stand for
[55:38] me I'll stand for you you got to take a
[55:41] stand amen and sometimes that stand
[55:44] needs to be taken in our home in our
[55:46] workplace wherever it is take a stand
[55:49] let them know because one day Jesus is
[55:51] going to say where did you stand and
[55:54] you're GNA say well you you you
[55:56] you I went to that church you you he's
[55:59] going to play it right back where you
[56:01] stood make it clear where you
[56:05] stand now speaking of the Bride in our
[56:08] day here verse
[56:10] 14 don't get sucked into any kind of
[56:13] person that says to you you know it's it
[56:17] you don't have to do
[56:19] that that's
[56:22] deceived and deceiving
[56:27] you I don't
[56:29] care I'll just say like this if your
[56:32] pastor is off the word you either get
[56:35] him back on the word or get under a
[56:37] pastor who is on the
[56:39] word if I can say that about a pastor
[56:42] you need to be to say that about your
[56:44] friends and your
[56:46] family the word needs to be first in
[56:49] your life because God is looking at you
[56:52] if they fall off the bridge are you
[56:53] going to go
[56:56] if they're going to dilly dally around
[56:58] and just well that doesn't matter this
[57:00] doesn't matter get away from that spirit
[57:04] is not of
[57:07] Christ you know we we we entertain that
[57:10] thing and it'll bring you
[57:13] down it'll bring you
[57:16] down it'll put you in bondage verse 14
[57:20] speaking of the Bride in our day now but
[57:23] continue thou in the things which thou
[57:26] has learned and has been assured of
[57:29] knowing of whom thou has learned them
[57:33] and that from a child thou has known the
[57:36] holy
[57:39] Scriptures it wasn't by accident that
[57:41] you came across
[57:44] these which are able these scriptures
[57:46] are able to make thee wise unto
[57:49] salvation through faith which is in
[57:52] Christ Jesus I want us to recognize that
[57:54] Paul is speaking to Timothy the who is
[57:57] already saved at this moment so why is
[57:59] he making this statement that is able to
[58:02] make thee wise unto salvation because
[58:05] our Salvation hasn't happened yet until
[58:09] our last
[58:13] day how the tree falls that's the way it
[58:17] lies might be up straight for a long
[58:20] time but how it
[58:22] falls so I want to say yes we're saved
[58:26] but tomorrow we're going to get saved
[58:28] again because today is the day of Sal
[58:31] each day we are living for God we show
[58:35] God we're we're we're we're born again
[58:37] we're we got a different nature we're we
[58:40] want to get more like
[58:42] Jesus people who say that they're saved
[58:45] and they don't care how they're acting
[58:47] they're they're deceived they're
[58:50] deceived they're absolutely 100%
[58:54] deceived
[58:57] you don't want to you don't want to get
[58:59] in the scriptures and and search the
[59:01] scriptures for you in them you think you
[59:03] have eternal life there they testify of
[59:05] me what does the scriptures testify any
[59:06] man that be in Christ he's a new
[59:08] creature all things are passed away
[59:10] behold all things have become new amen
[59:13] the scriptures are the final absolute
[59:16] not our opinions
[59:21] amen so these scriptures are going to
[59:25] make us wise to that day of
[59:29] judgment did you know that this book was
[59:32] the most read book by Abraham
[59:38] Lincoln and he he read that from a child
[59:41] I'll say this to all the mothers and
[59:43] fathers mothers and fathers read the
[59:46] Bible to your
[59:49] children don't just say read the Bible
[59:53] read the Bible to them take the time
[59:56] say son daughter do you understand well
[1:00:00] they're only 8 years
[1:00:02] old so what
[1:00:05] Timothy read the Bible to them because
[1:00:09] now it's when they need it because when
[1:00:11] they go to school they don't get it when
[1:00:13] they're with their friends they don't
[1:00:14] get it they get on the computer they
[1:00:16] don't get it the TV they don't get
[1:00:19] it something's got you know the evil is
[1:00:22] grossing worse and worse and the bride
[1:00:25] has got to get their their their their
[1:00:28] children and their family into the
[1:00:30] word praise
[1:00:34] Goden all scripture verse 16 is given by
[1:00:40] the inspiration of God no matter how
[1:00:41] foolish it may
[1:00:44] sound it is given by the inspiration of
[1:00:48] God if God if if somebody slaps you on
[1:00:51] the face and the the inspiration of God
[1:00:54] through the scripture says turn burn
[1:00:56] your cheek it is inspired word of God it
[1:01:00] he'll take you
[1:01:03] through you don't sit there and say I'm
[1:01:05] not you're kidding I'm not gonna let
[1:01:07] that happen
[1:01:08] again you're going off a different
[1:01:11] word not God's
[1:01:15] word the word of God is inspired and we
[1:01:18] got to believe it's real it's
[1:01:21] alive it can take it can make an effect
[1:01:24] in our lives
[1:01:26] the Bible says it is
[1:01:29] profitable for Doctrine for reproof for
[1:01:34] correction for instruction in
[1:01:37] righteousness this this not why we come
[1:01:40] to the house of the Lord to be profited
[1:01:44] by the scriptures amen somehow in our
[1:01:47] life that we can become profited by them
[1:01:50] to and today I just say it like this is
[1:01:52] more of an awareness of how real the
[1:01:54] scriptures are to us they can really
[1:01:56] help our
[1:01:58] lives if we just get alone and get
[1:02:01] serious with
[1:02:03] God and what is the reason for all this
[1:02:06] that the man of God may be
[1:02:10] perfect thoroughly fished unto all good
[1:02:13] works so what is God going to do to
[1:02:16] every man on the day of
[1:02:18] judgment judge him according to his
[1:02:22] works and this word this word word can
[1:02:26] make your Works become rewarded rather
[1:02:30] than judged are you with me amen so just
[1:02:34] think about this we have the one book
[1:02:38] right here that will be there on the day
[1:02:40] of judgment right and it's able to make
[1:02:44] us wise unto salvation to bypass the
[1:02:47] Judgment I'll just say it like this if
[1:02:49] you just take the scriptures he that
[1:02:51] believeth in is baptized shall be saved
[1:02:53] if you just want to take that scripture
[1:02:54] say you repent you got baptized and
[1:02:57] you're saved and that's all you want to
[1:02:58] do you missed the real revelation of
[1:03:00] that scripture you might as well throw
[1:03:03] out the rest of the Bible take that pin
[1:03:04] it up on your wall and say I'm saved you
[1:03:08] might as well forget the rest of the
[1:03:09] word but Jesus said man shall live by
[1:03:13] every word of
[1:03:14] God so the other scriptures are just as
[1:03:17] important as that scripture we need all
[1:03:20] the word for salvation amen I'll say it
[1:03:23] like this I may not I may not live all
[1:03:25] the word
[1:03:27] of course we're human we make mistakes
[1:03:30] we fall we come
[1:03:31] short but the thing is to have a an
[1:03:35] attitude of I don't care is the same one
[1:03:37] Satan had when he decided to step out of
[1:03:39] his position when he left his own
[1:03:45] habitation we can bypass
[1:03:48] judgment we can be acquitted of our
[1:03:52] crimes while this book is going to judge
[1:03:55] and condemn the
[1:03:58] world this book is going to make the
[1:04:01] bride wise unto salvation this book
[1:04:04] right here is going to make her wise
[1:04:06] unto
[1:04:08] salvation the bride was not born
[1:04:16] ready we were
[1:04:19] predestinated to be conformed to the
[1:04:21] image of Jesus Christ amen so we're in
[1:04:24] the process of becoming just like him we
[1:04:28] don't sit there and say I'm
[1:04:29] predestinated I'm a Son of God and I'm a
[1:04:31] daughter of God and I'm there and then
[1:04:34] it doesn't matter what you're
[1:04:35] doing your character will never be
[1:04:38] developed you'll never be
[1:04:42] challenged the foolish virgin while
[1:04:45] they're with the assuming attitude that
[1:04:48] they're already ready they're ready
[1:04:51] enough the bride is literally taking the
[1:04:54] word of God the scriptures the inspired
[1:04:56] word of God and she's making herself
[1:04:59] ready for the
[1:05:01] Rapture the hearers only they're content
[1:05:04] with just coming to church and hearing
[1:05:07] the word this sounds good but the bride
[1:05:11] the bride is eating the book amen taking
[1:05:14] the book and eating the whole book amen
[1:05:17] just like John
[1:05:18] told am while churchgoers wrestle with
[1:05:22] the preaching I don't know if I like
[1:05:24] that preaching
[1:05:25] the bride knows that all scripture is
[1:05:27] given by the inspiration of God and is
[1:05:30] profitable for their
[1:05:33] lives while the leod deia church members
[1:05:36] feel it this need of nothing this
[1:05:39] attitude of I'm just good enough The Way
[1:05:42] I Am The Bride is being made perfect
[1:05:45] through Repro correction instruction in
[1:05:49] righteousness the bride is being
[1:05:51] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[1:05:54] I understand when we come to Church
[1:05:56] there may be people who are just not
[1:05:57] getting into the word I'm okay with that
[1:06:00] but I'm telling you the bride is not
[1:06:01] going to miss the word she's not going
[1:06:04] to and I really don't care about the
[1:06:06] foolish virgin I don't care about the
[1:06:09] other two types of Believers sister ly I
[1:06:11] care about the bride God set the word
[1:06:14] for the bride he set the prophet for the
[1:06:17] bride you got to count yourself as the
[1:06:20] bride though none go with me still I'll
[1:06:22] follow this word means everything to me
[1:06:26] Jesus said in Revelations 22:12 and
[1:06:29] behold I come quickly and my reward is
[1:06:32] with me to give every man
[1:06:35] according to as his work shall
[1:06:40] be he also said in verse 18 the
[1:06:44] scripture says for I testify unto every
[1:06:48] man that heareth the words of the
[1:06:50] prophecy of this book for If any man
[1:06:53] shall add unto these things amen God's
[1:06:57] going to add him the plagues that are
[1:06:59] written in the book and if any man shall
[1:07:02] take away from the words of the book of
[1:07:04] this prophecy God shall take away his
[1:07:08] part out of the book of life out of the
[1:07:11] holy city and from the things that are
[1:07:13] written in this book I think it's I
[1:07:15] think I I I think with those scriptures
[1:07:17] right there I remember brother Ron
[1:07:19] Brother Bruce before I came to know the
[1:07:22] Lord I read those scriptures and they
[1:07:24] put the fear of God in Me and I didn't
[1:07:26] even know
[1:07:29] God I think what the problem is there's
[1:07:31] too many people that they feel that
[1:07:33] they're
[1:07:35] saved you want to know why they think
[1:07:37] they're saved because they're looking
[1:07:39] back at some time they repented and got
[1:07:41] baptized and they're ignoring the life
[1:07:43] that they're living that day and they
[1:07:45] need to read the scripture because
[1:07:47] they've they've taken away from the word
[1:07:49] they're adding to the word to bring this
[1:07:51] feeling of I'm in need of nothing I'm
[1:07:53] saved amen
[1:07:59] why does the bride hunger and thirst
[1:08:01] after
[1:08:03] righteousness why can't the bride wait
[1:08:06] till the doors are
[1:08:08] open because all scripture is given by
[1:08:11] the inspiration of God righten does they
[1:08:15] want to see their life profited for
[1:08:17] Doctrine for reprove for correction and
[1:08:20] for instruction and righteousness that
[1:08:22] they may be perfect thoroughly for
[1:08:25] fished unto all good
[1:08:29] works you know I want to just talk to
[1:08:32] the to I want to talk to the attitude
[1:08:35] I'm not talking to people right now I
[1:08:37] want to talk to the attitude that says
[1:08:40] well you know I just have you know
[1:08:42] problems with that and it just you know
[1:08:44] that's just the way it is it's just just
[1:08:45] who I live with and it's just you know
[1:08:47] it's my boss and it's you know um I I
[1:08:50] just I just I got a problem with that I
[1:08:52] just I want to talk to that attitude for
[1:08:54] a moment
[1:09:00] is that not the attitude of I don't need
[1:09:03] to help that
[1:09:08] situation like I got enough going for me
[1:09:11] that I don't really have to worry about
[1:09:13] that I'm in need of
[1:09:17] nothing because
[1:09:19] I'm good
[1:09:21] here it's a
[1:09:23] spirit it's an attit ude and if you
[1:09:27] don't have the attitude that I need to
[1:09:28] get ready you need to get the Holy
[1:09:32] Ghost bottom line I think there's what
[1:09:36] the problem is there's too many people
[1:09:37] that don't get the Holy Ghost and
[1:09:39] they're trying to be a Christian and how
[1:09:42] there's never been a Christian without
[1:09:44] the Holy Ghost amen and there never will
[1:09:47] be I don't care how much you try
[1:09:51] amen the bride has a revelation that she
[1:09:54] must be sanc ified and cleansed with the
[1:09:58] washing of the Water by the word
[1:10:01] amen that's why she hungers for
[1:10:04] it she's got to get
[1:10:08] there she's been she has been revealed
[1:10:12] or it has been revealed to her that
[1:10:14] she's going to be
[1:10:16] presented by her husband to herself to
[1:10:19] him a glorious church not having spot or
[1:10:23] wrinkle or any such thing but that it
[1:10:27] should be holy and without blemish
[1:10:30] that's right that is why people actually
[1:10:33] desired to get to
[1:10:34] church right
[1:10:37] there where understand Leo deia in need
[1:10:41] of nothing I'm
[1:10:42] there I'm
[1:10:46] there I'm
[1:10:48] there deceived and being
[1:10:53] deceived the scriptures are prop
[1:10:55] profitable for a
[1:10:57] life amen they are it doesn't matter the
[1:11:01] condition that your life is
[1:11:03] in doesn't matter how difficult things
[1:11:06] are it doesn't matter if you
[1:11:09] need financial help physical help
[1:11:12] marital help spiritual help emotional
[1:11:14] help it just doesn't matter the
[1:11:17] scriptures contain the answer to profit
[1:11:21] your life that's right amen your life
[1:11:25] can get profited if you take seriously
[1:11:27] the word of God Amen but if you're one
[1:11:30] of those people said well I tried it it
[1:11:31] didn't
[1:11:32] work well I'm sorry it don't work
[1:11:35] without faith I did have faith for how
[1:11:39] long the faith that you're needing is
[1:11:41] the faith that you will stay with it
[1:11:42] until it happens that's the faith that
[1:11:45] God's looking for the kind of attitude
[1:11:47] that we need to
[1:11:52] have the scriptures are profitable we
[1:11:55] got to apply them we just have to apply
[1:11:57] the scriptures if they're really going
[1:11:58] to profit our
[1:12:00] life and when we apply them to our life
[1:12:02] it proves that we really believe the
[1:12:05] scriptures because everybody says they
[1:12:08] believe right but until you start
[1:12:10] applying the word to your old life you
[1:12:12] don't believe
[1:12:17] it the life shows whether you believe or
[1:12:21] not the demons tremble amen
[1:12:26] amen take a brother like uh brother
[1:12:29] Marty Brother Bruce these
[1:12:32] brothers paying their tithes for I don't
[1:12:35] know 30 years 40 years
[1:12:38] Brothers faithful to the
[1:12:42] core
[1:12:45] core you think the devil can come to
[1:12:49] them and tell them you don't believe and
[1:12:52] pain ties
[1:12:56] but take someone who is part-time in
[1:12:59] playing
[1:13:02] ties oh yeah see it's the life behind
[1:13:06] the name that makes the demons
[1:13:09] tremble when you when you read that word
[1:13:12] and you obey the word it be you become
[1:13:15] the
[1:13:16] word and the devil don't know what to do
[1:13:19] with you
[1:13:20] amen but if you're like I I can't afford
[1:13:23] it this time and you know I got things
[1:13:25] going and well before you know it he can
[1:13:27] just talk you into anything in no
[1:13:31] time second Corinthians chapter 3:6 says
[1:13:35] God have made us able Ministers of the
[1:13:39] New Testament not of the letter only but
[1:13:42] of the spirit for the letter kth but the
[1:13:45] spirit giveth life so I wanted to read
[1:13:47] the scripture because you know we look
[1:13:49] at this Bible is well just you know
[1:13:51] words you know on a paper and yeah there
[1:13:53] are dos and don'ts and you know love thy
[1:13:55] neighbor and you
[1:13:57] know go Second Mile and and they're
[1:14:02] like if we're not careful the letter
[1:14:05] will actually kill us and and condemn
[1:14:08] us because we're missing a love for the
[1:14:11] word but when you love that word and it
[1:14:14] means that God I want about to live this
[1:14:17] help me to live it Lord I really mean
[1:14:19] I'm going to spend time with you I'm
[1:14:20] going to pray I'm going to seek you God
[1:14:22] I'm not living it I want to live it you
[1:14:24] want to what's going to happen the
[1:14:26] spirit of God is going to come into you
[1:14:28] and give you Grace to live that word but
[1:14:31] it is not going to happen with an it
[1:14:33] doesn't matter attitude he only
[1:14:35] functions by faith and when you pray and
[1:14:39] you're asking God with confidence that
[1:14:42] he's going to do it he will give you the
[1:14:44] manifestation of the
[1:14:48] word the spirit is what gives you life
[1:14:51] amen we don't come into church and say
[1:14:53] well what you know what's the word
[1:14:54] what's this thing think I'm going to
[1:14:55] hear no I'm looking for the spirit of
[1:14:57] the word that's coming across the pulpit
[1:14:59] the spirit that's what's going to make
[1:15:01] you leave here differently in the right
[1:15:04] way in the right
[1:15:06] way Jesus said in John
[1:15:09] 663 it is the spirit that quickeneth for
[1:15:14] the flesh profiteth
[1:15:19] nothing but the words that I speak unto
[1:15:22] you they are spirit and their life amen
[1:15:24] so our our message says
[1:15:28] profitability if all you're going to do
[1:15:31] is try to use your flesh to have a
[1:15:33] relationship with God it's not going to
[1:15:35] profit
[1:15:36] you it's going to profit you
[1:15:39] nothing the world is full of people who
[1:15:42] got peacock feathers in
[1:15:47] them but what we need is a word spoken
[1:15:50] by God to our heart
[1:15:53] personally because that
[1:15:55] that has quickening power that will
[1:15:58] Quicken your
[1:16:00] life he said my words they are spirit
[1:16:05] and they are life so I
[1:16:08] understand you know here's here's the
[1:16:10] big thing I don't care how long we've
[1:16:11] been serving the lord and we had this
[1:16:13] conversation here in our men's meeting
[1:16:17] tonight that we need to stay in a spot
[1:16:21] where the
[1:16:22] Lord such a tender spot to where the
[1:16:25] word can be quickened to
[1:16:29] us it's awful
[1:16:31] quiet if we're going to just be in our
[1:16:34] flesh when we hear the word then even
[1:16:37] though we like the word we understand
[1:16:39] the word we can say Amen to the
[1:16:41] word it can't bring about a life out of
[1:16:45] us and so what we're really hungering
[1:16:48] for is God give me the spirit of this
[1:16:51] word inside of my life amen then I have
[1:16:55] everything that this
[1:16:56] has I have it in
[1:17:01] me well brother John I thought you had I
[1:17:03] thought you had the Holy Ghost well I'm
[1:17:05] going to tell you what I got a portion
[1:17:07] of
[1:17:09] it I have a portion of
[1:17:11] it and I know the prophet says you got
[1:17:14] you have enough in there that you could
[1:17:16] go and create a world and live on it
[1:17:18] that's right but I want I will not be
[1:17:21] satisfied until I see that word manifest
[1:17:25] in my
[1:17:26] life so either I got to die out cry out
[1:17:30] for more and there's you know Jesus gave
[1:17:33] us the instructions of the importance of
[1:17:35] dying out and I don't know if anybody's
[1:17:38] anybody if anybody's ever watched
[1:17:40] anybody die a slow
[1:17:45] death it is is something that you would
[1:17:48] never want to
[1:17:50] see it's one thing just a Boop done
[1:17:53] over but a slow death is painful to a
[1:17:59] Christian he dies daily amen it's a slow
[1:18:04] death you got to get in that prayer
[1:18:06] closet and you got to say Lord not my
[1:18:09] will but thy will be done because you're
[1:18:12] you get up in the morning and you just
[1:18:13] want to do your own
[1:18:15] thing so I'm telling you this the way of
[1:18:18] a Christian is
[1:18:20] hard but it's the only way that the the
[1:18:22] the God can be
[1:18:25] alive inside of
[1:18:27] us amen we read those scriptures didn't
[1:18:30] we in the men's meeting there in 2
[1:18:33] Corinthians chapter 4 if you want to
[1:18:35] write that down around the verses 12 and
[1:18:37] 13 Isaiah 5511 says so shall my word be
[1:18:41] that goeth forth out of my mouth it
[1:18:43] shall not return unto me void but it
[1:18:45] shall accomplish that which I please and
[1:18:47] it shall
[1:18:49] prosper in the thing where un to I sent
[1:18:54] it that's
[1:18:55] now if Jesus said blessed are they that
[1:18:59] hunger and thirst in other
[1:19:02] words those that don't thirst are not
[1:19:07] blessed even though they hear the word
[1:19:09] they're not
[1:19:14] blessed because if you're hungering and
[1:19:16] thirsting look at if your children are
[1:19:18] are hungry James when you're hungry does
[1:19:21] your M did your mom and dad ever say you
[1:19:23] can't eat for a whole week
[1:19:27] never time for dinner we're all going
[1:19:29] out to
[1:19:34] eat when you're hungry you eat you want
[1:19:38] to eat when you're hungry now you ever
[1:19:41] been full it's time to eat but you just
[1:19:42] yeah it's
[1:19:44] not yeah look if if if if we if we can
[1:19:50] develop an attitude where it doesn't
[1:19:51] really matter if I hear from God
[1:19:53] personally
[1:19:55] you're not hungering to hear his voice
[1:19:58] speak to you directly God I'm
[1:20:02] serious
[1:20:04] okay you're not going to be fed but if
[1:20:06] you're hungry then he'll send you the
[1:20:08] word and it will prosper in the place he
[1:20:11] sends
[1:20:13] it it'll be profitable for your life I
[1:20:17] the worst case scenario is walking out
[1:20:19] of church with more
[1:20:21] joy because the joy of the Lord is your
[1:20:24] strength
[1:20:26] amen
[1:20:28] amen Paul said I can do all things
[1:20:31] through Christ which strengtheneth
[1:20:34] me don't try to do them yourself his
[1:20:38] words are life they'll Prosper your life
[1:20:41] they'll give you strength to do all
[1:20:44] things and the biggest thing is I think
[1:20:46] God wants us to see is the strength to
[1:20:49] do his
[1:20:51] will remember when Jesus was there in
[1:20:53] the garden and he he was suff he was
[1:20:57] just really contemplated not going to
[1:21:00] the cross it was just a battle that he
[1:21:02] was having that you go ahead and suffer
[1:21:05] and
[1:21:07] die and he said father if it's possible
[1:21:09] let this cup pass for
[1:21:13] me the Bible tells us
[1:21:16] that that that they that wait upon the
[1:21:20] Lord shall re renew their
[1:21:22] strength and he was in the right place
[1:21:24] to receive strength and when he made
[1:21:27] that decision not my will but thy will
[1:21:30] be done the Bible says Angels
[1:21:33] Came strengthen
[1:21:35] him God is here to strengthen if you
[1:21:38] want his
[1:21:39] strength I believe that with all my
[1:21:41] heart 1 Thessalonians
[1:21:44] 2:13 1 Thessalonians 2:13 for this cause
[1:21:48] also thank we god without ceasing don't
[1:21:53] stop
[1:21:55] because when you reive the word of God
[1:21:59] which he heard of us you received it not
[1:22:03] as the word of
[1:22:06] men but as it is truth the word of God
[1:22:10] which effectually worketh also in you
[1:22:13] that
[1:22:15] believe now that word effectually
[1:22:18] worketh means
[1:22:20] actively this word will live in you if
[1:22:22] you really believe it
[1:22:25] but if it's a a a carnal intellectual
[1:22:28] natural uh belief well then hey the
[1:22:31] devil's believe also it's not going to
[1:22:34] work it's not going to be active in your
[1:22:36] life so I'm all for you know learning
[1:22:38] the scriptures and quoting the
[1:22:40] scriptures but there should be a longing
[1:22:42] God oh I want to see this lived in my
[1:22:45] life I want to be faithful to the little
[1:22:48] things that you asked me to do Lord I
[1:22:50] want to get up in the morning and I want
[1:22:52] to mean business with you I want to I
[1:22:55] want to conduct myself I want to have a
[1:22:57] behavior that's pleasing to you Lord I
[1:23:00] want my family to be pleased with my
[1:23:02] behavior I want my church to be pleased
[1:23:05] with my
[1:23:07] behavior it it'll work in you if you
[1:23:11] believe it to be the truth Hebrews 4:2
[1:23:14] says For unto us was the Gospel preached
[1:23:17] as well as unto them but the word
[1:23:19] preached unto them did not profit them
[1:23:21] not being mixed with faith my time is
[1:23:25] slipping
[1:23:29] away if we're struggling to make
[1:23:31] decisions or we feel double-minded
[1:23:33] sometimes we don't know what to do the
[1:23:35] scripture is
[1:23:37] profitable the scriptures can help us
[1:23:40] with that James 4:8 says purify your
[1:23:43] hearts you double-minded right there
[1:23:47] right there something's
[1:23:48] wrong so you're struggling get along
[1:23:52] with God get in prayer
[1:23:55] get your heart your heart forget the
[1:23:59] situation forget what you're trying to
[1:24:01] make a decision with but get your heart
[1:24:04] real pure with God and I'm telling you
[1:24:08] got to come in there and you'll have the
[1:24:10] mind of
[1:24:12] Christ our heart is directly linked to
[1:24:14] our
[1:24:15] minds when our heart is filled with the
[1:24:17] wrong things that can cause people to be
[1:24:23] double-minded and times we could be
[1:24:25] viewed as two separate people or acting
[1:24:27] two different
[1:24:29] ways the scripture has a
[1:24:32] solution purify the heart that's what I
[1:24:35] love the scripture is profitable for our
[1:24:41] lives God is able to get our thoughts in
[1:24:45] our mind straight when our heart is
[1:24:49] straight sometimes our heart receives a
[1:24:51] wrong
[1:24:53] Spirit we may begin to think evil about
[1:24:56] somebody or start to judge
[1:24:59] someone or allow the devil to bring up
[1:25:02] something from the
[1:25:04] past or begin to use our minds for a
[1:25:08] playground all these
[1:25:11] things can come and just start to stir
[1:25:14] things inside of us and before you know
[1:25:16] it we don't know what to do about
[1:25:18] anything don't know what to do don't
[1:25:20] know where to go don't
[1:25:23] know because because the heart isn't
[1:25:26] single we've allowed wrong things in and
[1:25:29] we don't even realize it that's why the
[1:25:32] Bible says we don't even know our own
[1:25:33] heart right we need the word of God to
[1:25:36] be spoken to us to say oh boy that's a
[1:25:38] light that's probably what's going
[1:25:42] on the scriptures tell us plainly our
[1:25:46] hearts if we purify our hearts it will
[1:25:49] help our minds
[1:25:55] if we fall in love with God that's a
[1:25:58] pure heart yes am the Bible already says
[1:26:01] the love of God thinketh no evil you all
[1:26:04] a sudden will get rid of that to to lay
[1:26:06] down your life love one another live for
[1:26:08] others so you get the heart right all of
[1:26:11] a sudden your thinking goes
[1:26:13] right it just the love of God's not
[1:26:16] going to allow bitter
[1:26:18] thoughts it puts a halt to strife and
[1:26:22] division it puts a halt to perit the
[1:26:24] devil to play around and have its
[1:26:27] way the scriptures are profitable to
[1:26:30] make the Christian complete perfect and
[1:26:34] ready for a Rapture if you feel worn out
[1:26:36] spiritually drained Jesus spoke a
[1:26:39] parable unto them to this end that men
[1:26:41] ought always to pray and not faint you
[1:26:45] know the hardest thing to do when you
[1:26:46] just feel spiritually weak is to pray
[1:26:49] you're you you're just not in the mood
[1:26:52] you're not in the mood but I'll just say
[1:26:54] this put some music
[1:26:56] on put some music
[1:27:03] on put your app on let let play some
[1:27:06] scriptures let the scriptures read
[1:27:08] listen to have Psalms just come into
[1:27:10] your ears just get alone and let the
[1:27:14] inspiration of God profit your
[1:27:17] life and then before you know it you'll
[1:27:20] have it just Lord I need you at this
[1:27:22] time get on your knees and let your
[1:27:26] strength begin to build Isaiah 40:29
[1:27:29] says he giveth power to the faint to
[1:27:31] them that have no might increaseth
[1:27:34] strength even the you shall faint and be
[1:27:37] weary and the young men shall utterly
[1:27:38] fall but they that wait upon the Lord
[1:27:40] shall renew their strength they shall
[1:27:42] Mount up with wings as eagles they shall
[1:27:44] run and not be wored they shall walk and
[1:27:46] not faint
[1:27:48] amen you're bombarded with confusion the
[1:27:51] scriptures are profitable
[1:27:54] if we're batt on anxiety and strife and
[1:27:56] we need peace the scriptures are
[1:27:58] profitable for us because the scriptures
[1:28:00] contain what we need to get out of the
[1:28:03] situation we don't stay in this turmoil
[1:28:07] situation and say well if God wanted to
[1:28:09] help me he would just do it no go to the
[1:28:12] scriptures what do the scriptures say to
[1:28:13] get out of
[1:28:15] it thou will keep him in perfect peace
[1:28:18] whose mind is stayed upon thee because
[1:28:23] he trusteth in thee
[1:28:25] well brother John that's pretty
[1:28:26] oldfashioned I'm living in this 21st
[1:28:29] century is that what we're at right
[1:28:32] now you know time just flies by you
[1:28:37] know and you know I just I got a job and
[1:28:40] I got a family and I got this and you
[1:28:42] know I just I just can't keep my mind on
[1:28:44] the Lord that
[1:28:45] long okay so I got another scripture for
[1:28:48] you with that behavior Philippians 4:8
[1:28:55] so if you're not keeping your mind
[1:28:56] stayed on him this is how the mind of
[1:28:58] Christ is let this mind be in you that
[1:29:00] was in Christ finally Brethren
[1:29:02] whatsoever things are true and honest
[1:29:06] and just whatsoever things are pure and
[1:29:09] lovely things that are of a good report
[1:29:12] if there be any virtue if there be any
[1:29:14] praise then you just concentrate and
[1:29:17] allow your mind to only think on these
[1:29:21] things
[1:29:26] if you you don't want to do that you
[1:29:27] don't want to believe that word then
[1:29:29] you're on your
[1:29:30] own there is no other I'm sorry you go
[1:29:34] to the doctor you take the pills you do
[1:29:35] what you want to do there is no antidote
[1:29:38] to get rid of the devil and anxiety than
[1:29:40] keeping your mind on the word of God and
[1:29:42] following the word of God God there's
[1:29:45] only one thing that can defeat the Devil
[1:29:46] and that is God and it has to be God in
[1:29:48] you the Living Word manifested in your
[1:29:51] mind and your heart amen

[1:29:59] and heard and seen in me do and the God
[1:30:01] of Peace shall be with you here again

[1:30:06] saying look I'm telling you the truth

[1:30:13] you I want the god at peace to be with
