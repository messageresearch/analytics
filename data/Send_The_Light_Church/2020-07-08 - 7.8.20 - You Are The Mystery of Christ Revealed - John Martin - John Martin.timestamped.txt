[39:25] things now in Jesus Christ's name Amen
[39:27] amen praise the Lord Colossians chapter
[39:31] 1 we're gonna be step begin reading here
[39:33] at verse number 24 now who who now
[39:40] rejoice in my sufferings for you and
[39:43] fill up that which is behind of the
[39:46] afflictions of Christ in my flesh for
[39:49] his body sake notice which is the church
[39:53] wherever I am made a minister according
[39:55] to the dispensation of God which is
[39:57] given to me for you to fulfill the Word
[40:01] of God even the mystery which had been
[40:04] hid from the ages and from generations
[40:06] but now has made manifest to a Saints to
[40:10] whom god would make known what is the
[40:11] riches of the glory of this mystery
[40:14] among the gentiles which is christ in
[40:19] you the hope of glory whom we preach and
[40:22] warning every man teaching every man in
[40:25] a wisdom that we may present every man
[40:27] perfect in Christ Jesus we're into
[40:31] I also labor striving according to his
[40:35] working which worketh in me mightily
[40:38] amen god bless you me you may be seated
[40:43] brother Branham preached a sermon Christ
[40:48] is the mystery of God revealed that's
[40:50] quite a lengthy sermon and today we
[40:54] wanted Minister on the bride as the
[40:56] mystery of Christ revealed and title
[41:00] this you are the mystery of Christ
[41:03] revealed and for a subject I want you to
[41:06] think on as we Minister today what about
[41:09] Christ in you because we want to take
[41:11] our our text from this set of scriptures
[41:14] here Paul was rejoicing in his
[41:20] sufferings but it wasn't just oh I'm
[41:25] suffering I'm getting nothing out of it
[41:27] he was getting something out of it and
[41:29] what it was getting out of it was the
[41:32] church the body other people seeing
[41:36] other people come to the light and the
[41:39] glorious salvation of Jesus Christ he
[41:43] says where have I made a minister
[41:44] according to the dispensation of God
[41:47] which is given to me for you to fulfill
[41:49] the Word of God you have been saved for
[41:53] a purpose that's beyond you take a look
[41:59] at everything that God created it's
[42:01] always benefiting something people don't
[42:04] even know God can look at the Grand
[42:07] Canyon and look at the the oceans and
[42:09] the mountains and the snow and the birds
[42:12] and and and and glorify the how this
[42:17] came about so these things even to the
[42:24] person that doesn't believe in God can
[42:26] behold the beauty of it and when God
[42:34] saved us he didn't just have you in mind
[42:38] because he would have stopped with Jesus
[42:41] Christ
[42:42] but God so loved the world
[42:45] that he gave there was others that he
[42:47] loved and and Paul had the Spirit of God
[42:52] in him to where he could see that his
[42:54] calling was for others amen even the
[42:58] mystery which had been hid from
[42:59] generations but now is made manifest to
[43:02] his saints to whom god would make known
[43:06] what is the riches of this glory of this
[43:08] mystery among the gentiles which is
[43:10] christ in you the hope of glory now he
[43:16] says whom we preach Christ in you the
[43:20] hope of glory we preach in this way
[43:23] warning every man and teaching every man
[43:28] in all wisdom that to the end we may
[43:33] present every man perfect in Christ
[43:36] Jesus now that kind of sounds like the
[43:40] army to me you don't just enlist and
[43:45] that's it okay I'm in the army
[43:49] you keep growing and learning and they
[43:53] you've served 20 years they don't say
[43:56] okay we're going to start all over no
[43:58] they want to make you a higher rank they
[43:59] want to put you further they want they
[44:01] want you to help other men in the army
[44:03] and and and teach others to do what
[44:06] you've done in this it's a continual
[44:08] grooming process and and Paul's desire
[44:10] was not just that people would get saved
[44:13] but that they would become perfect in
[44:15] Christ Jesus
[44:16] he wasn't just interested in some
[44:18] baptism he said he warning every man
[44:20] teaching every man in all wisdom in
[44:23] God's wisdom that he may present them
[44:25] perfect to God it's a chaste virgin he
[44:30] said I labor striving according to his
[44:33] work which worketh in me mightily so
[44:36] this man strived and is working it
[44:41] wasn't just about barely making it to
[44:43] church
[44:44] barely making it through the week no he
[44:48] had a purpose his relationship with God
[44:52] didn't fall by the wayside in between
[44:54] services he had a job to do in between
[45:00] the services amen
[45:03] think about how amazing God is and
[45:06] everything that he does is amazing
[45:08] when I sit back and I I began to think
[45:11] about God and I spent a lot of time
[45:14] sitting at the edge water the the edge
[45:17] of the water this week and just looking
[45:20] at the the birds in the mainly the birds
[45:25] but the water and the rocks and the
[45:29] trees and the water rushing and every
[45:32] time I think deeply about the things
[45:37] that God has created
[45:38] I really do stand in all how could this
[45:44] be created God is he's the God that
[45:48] created the heavens and the earth he
[45:52] created everything he said when he said
[45:55] let there be light and there was light
[45:58] he made thousands of galaxies with
[46:01] millions of custom stars they're not all
[46:05] cookie cutters right they're customs he
[46:08] made all the atoms and the molecules in
[46:10] the the elements think about the the
[46:15] bitty insects that fly and call to the
[46:18] giant elephants and rhinos and dinosaurs
[46:22] from the nature of a lamb to that of a
[46:25] lion or grizzly look at all the
[46:29] beautiful and colorful birds that God
[46:31] created not just to enjoy not just so we
[46:37] could enjoy them but that we could be it
[46:42] can be a witness from God to us that
[46:45] he's amazing to get us to look at God
[46:50] and say God you're great look at that
[46:52] bird look at that mountain look at that
[46:54] out that that animal
[46:58] even the bugs that crawl around all the
[47:04] creatures that live in the water
[47:07] zooplankton is the smallest of animals
[47:12] which the smallest of zooplankton you
[47:15] can't even see with the naked eye it's
[47:18] called an animal he made that but when
[47:22] you consider from the smallest
[47:25] microscopic marine virus to the huge
[47:29] whales weighing up to 200 tons that's
[47:35] four hundred and forty thousand pounds
[47:38] the blue whale right that's nearly
[47:42] twenty times heavier than a t-rex or
[47:46] forty African elephants or 3333 humans
[47:55] and their tongue weighs the same as
[48:00] three average cars that way the tongue
[48:05] of a blue whale can you imagine just
[48:06] coming down like three cars slamming you
[48:11] 9,000 nearly 9,000 pounds their heart is
[48:16] the biggest weighing in about the weight
[48:21] of a Volkswagen Beetle their heart God
[48:26] is amazing we were the only creature he
[48:34] created in His image he created us with
[48:37] the soul look at all the intelligence
[48:41] that man has he can create an atmosphere
[48:46] he can create things he he he can make
[48:49] things he can figure out things he can
[48:53] overcome problems God is absolutely
[48:58] amazingly awesome
[49:01] you talk about the triple-a that's Jesus
[49:03] Christ first Corinthians chapter 2 verse
[49:10] 14 and all this amazingness man has a
[49:15] hard time figuring out who God is but
[49:19] the natural man receiveth not the things
[49:21] of the Spirit of God for they are
[49:23] foolishness unto Him neither can he know
[49:26] them because they are spiritually
[49:28] discerned so there's like a disconnect
[49:31] between God and man even though man is
[49:34] made in His image and we know that
[49:35] because man fell and he was born with
[49:38] the wrong nature 1st Corinthians chapter
[49:41] 2 verse 11 for what man knoweth the
[49:44] things of a man save the spirit of a man
[49:46] which is in him even so the things of
[49:48] God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God
[49:50] now we have received not the spirit of
[49:54] the world but the Spirit which is of God
[49:56] that we might know the things that are
[49:59] freely given to us see we cannot know
[50:01] God without the Spirit of God so if you
[50:04] want it you want to know God seek His
[50:06] Spirit I don't mean to to say you know
[50:11] set down the Bible but get serious about
[50:13] the Spirit of the Bible because youyou
[50:17] could just stay in this world net this
[50:20] word naturally the rest of your life
[50:22] brother bands that you'd be further away
[50:24] from God than when you started but just
[50:27] get down on your knees and just 5
[50:28] minutes in his presence you will know
[50:30] more than the theologians Romans chapter
[50:36] 1 verse 19 because they which may be
[50:41] known of God is manifest in them for God
[50:44] have showed it unto them this is a very
[50:46] powerful scripture because that which
[50:50] that which may be known of God is
[50:54] manifest in them so if you want to know
[50:57] God it when it is known it's manifest in
[51:01] you so when you're asking God God would
[51:03] you just show me this what you're really
[51:06] asking for has got to manifest it in you
[51:09] and your your your your whole desire is
[51:13] it to be here not here for the invisible
[51:20] things of him from the creation of the
[51:22] world are clearly seen being understood
[51:24] by the things that are made even his
[51:27] eternal power and Godhead so that they
[51:29] are without excuse so we don't we don't
[51:32] know God we don't see God but God makes
[51:34] all these things and then we see how
[51:36] great God is I mean just think about
[51:41] this little Bertha flapping his ring so
[51:42] fast you can't even see it and God
[51:47] created him like that how could we not
[51:50] think that God isn't awesome that there
[51:53] that how could the Big Bang do that
[51:56] the Big Bang must've did a lot of things
[51:59] because I could show a lot of things are
[52:02] awesome and yes so vastly different
[52:08] because that when they knew God they
[52:10] glorified him not as God neither were
[52:13] thankful
[52:15] what a terrible spirit but became vain
[52:18] in their imaginations from the foolish
[52:20] heart was darkened professing themselves
[52:22] to be wise they became fools and changed
[52:24] the glory of the incorruptible God into
[52:28] an image that has made like to
[52:31] corruptible man and to birds and
[52:34] four-footed beasts and creeping things
[52:37] see what the devil wants to do in the
[52:40] mind of people belittle God instead of
[52:46] looking at him from who he is God has
[52:52] always hid himself in simplicity from
[52:56] the wise and the prudent his birth was
[53:00] hid in a manger and revealed to some
[53:03] humble shepherds they were just think
[53:06] here of the Sheep
[53:07] they were just doing their job and God
[53:10] it is his majesty he hid it from the
[53:14] wise and prudent that day by just
[53:17] placing it in a manger where nobody knew
[53:19] about it
[53:21] for God so loved the world that He gave
[53:24] he wanted he would that no one would be
[53:27] lost
[53:29] yadi hides himself from those who think
[53:32] they have salvation all figured out
[53:36] without reverence without fear without
[53:39] humility anytime we're beginning to feel
[53:44] those things God hides himself from you
[53:50] we serve an awesome amazing God who's
[53:54] able to hide himself to someone in
[53:57] church because there's three types of
[54:00] believers not going to change this
[54:03] message for us not going to start a new
[54:05] message and say you know what we're all
[54:07] believers here whoa brother John well
[54:12] we're all believers there's three types
[54:14] of believers but you wouldn't want me to
[54:17] tell you that no matter what we're all
[54:20] going in the rapture and be like someone
[54:23] at a funeral saying this person's going
[54:25] to heaven no matter what it's up to you
[54:29] to decide what you want to believe now I
[54:37] want to believe with you on a trust but
[54:39] God is has the ability in a church where
[54:43] there's three types of believers let's
[54:44] just say we're not one of those churches
[54:46] don't let anybody be offended but in a
[54:49] church where there's three types of ly
[54:51] God has the ability to hide himself from
[54:54] the unbeliever the make believer and
[54:58] unveil himself to the real believer
[55:02] because it has to do with love
[55:05] relationship with Jesus Christ as that
[55:07] that's simple not how smart we are how
[55:13] long we've been going but how much do we
[55:15] love God today brother Branham speaking
[55:20] of God he says if you want to know God
[55:25] look at Jesus Christ and you'll know
[55:27] exactly who God is the truth of Jesus
[55:32] Christ had
[55:33] been a mystery to the world but in this
[55:37] age we are that mystery revealed to the
[55:41] world we are the manifestation of the
[55:44] gospel unveiled to the world there's
[55:50] only one group of people that are going
[55:52] to unveil who Christ is the
[55:54] denominations can't do it they're
[55:56] man-made the independent churches they
[55:58] can't do it
[56:00] some of those churches yeah they can
[56:02] show they can show the the moving of the
[56:05] Spirit they can speak with tongues no
[56:10] doubt there's miracles that take place
[56:13] but I'm not talking about that do they
[56:20] really know Christ the bride of Jesus
[56:23] Christ is the only group of people who
[56:26] will be just like Jesus Christ and she
[56:32] unveiled that to a group of people the
[56:38] world is blinded deceived lost second
[56:44] Corinthians chapter four verse three
[56:45] says but if our gospel be hid is hid to
[56:48] them that are lost in whom Satan the god
[56:53] of this world have blinded the minds of
[56:56] them which believe not lest the light of
[56:58] the glorious gospel of Christ who is in
[57:01] the image of God should shine unto them
[57:04] the gospel of Christ that is the light
[57:09] of God in this age we're all have that
[57:13] light now it's hid to them that are lost
[57:20] that's why you could talk to some people
[57:21] and they're just not interested but that
[57:25] doesn't mean we should stop
[57:26] we should never wait for somebody to
[57:28] come up to us and say okay I want to
[57:30] know about Jesus he would have never
[57:34] said go ye out you never went looking
[57:38] for God God came looking for you
[57:41] and God wants to go looking for someone
[57:44] else that belongs to him and he needs a
[57:46] vessel that's willing to go out
[57:49] Jesus testified that the church in this
[57:51] age was wretched he's his own testimony
[57:54] was miserable poor blind and naked and
[57:59] wasn't even aware of their spiritual
[58:02] condition so instead of going to the
[58:05] church with the right attitude I could
[58:07] be wrong I need to work out my salvation
[58:08] with fear and trouble I need to find out
[58:10] where I'm at with God today they came to
[58:12] church wanting to be pleased wanting to
[58:17] be entertained wanted to feel good
[58:18] wanted to be reassured of something that
[58:22] took place years ago that God still
[58:25] loved them that they're saved in other
[58:31] words they're they're taking their time
[58:33] through the course of the week and
[58:35] instead of building the relationship
[58:37] with God they want the preacher to do it
[58:39] all for him it's not what the ministry
[58:44] is for now we all we all go through
[58:51] times that we need reassurance and help
[58:55] from one another from the ministry no
[58:57] doubt about it but we should never live
[58:59] under those conditions that's just a
[59:02] lazy believer why is the church in this
[59:07] condition because they simply lack the
[59:10] Holy Ghost the very nature of Jesus
[59:13] they're having church without the Holy
[59:16] Ghost they're singing the songs they
[59:19] read in the Bible reading things that
[59:22] appeal and the peace the people make him
[59:24] feel good but they're not growing Peter
[59:30] said he that lacketh faith virtue
[59:34] temperance patience godliness brotherly
[59:36] kindness and charity is blind and cannot
[59:40] see afar off
[59:43] so Peter suggests that we should give
[59:45] all diligence to get get it back give
[59:49] give all diligence Jesus suggested
[59:53] getting some counseling from him
[59:55] he said I counsel thee to buy of me gold
[59:58] but the band said whatever you do lay
[1:00:01] aside everything else although the
[1:00:03] things you got going in your life lay it
[1:00:05] aside until you get perfect love now
[1:00:09] these are some some good advice here
[1:00:11] from men from the Holy Ghost it is our
[1:00:18] responsibility to take the things that
[1:00:21] God has shown to us Jesus's ministry of
[1:00:26] reconciliation he gave it to us but it's
[1:00:29] his he just using us truth that God has
[1:00:33] given us the light of our the manifested
[1:00:37] word for our day and unveil the mystery
[1:00:40] of Christ to others
[1:00:42] it isn't just telling people about God
[1:00:46] sent a prophet and it's not just about
[1:00:49] God sent a message what is the message
[1:00:52] brother Brennan repeatedly said it's
[1:00:55] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[1:00:57] and forever
[1:00:59] what our goal should be here is Christ
[1:01:02] the same in me as he was in that first
[1:01:05] wave sheaf that went in this age and not
[1:01:10] being content just to sit under the
[1:01:12] umbrella saying it's the message you
[1:01:14] don't make people sit in a message
[1:01:16] church they don't care what Word is as
[1:01:18] long as it says Presbyterian Lutheran
[1:01:21] Catholic Pentecostal doesn't matter as
[1:01:26] long as it has that name there are
[1:01:27] people sitting in the message as long as
[1:01:29] it says mrs. Church they're not even
[1:01:33] interested in in manifesting Christ as
[1:01:36] long as they say they belong to it lord
[1:01:41] help us
[1:01:42] we need to unveil Christ to the people
[1:01:45] that's our responsibility unveil more of
[1:01:49] him to the people that we live with the
[1:01:51] people that we work with the neighbors
[1:01:54] that we live by to the people we don't
[1:01:58] know to the people we meet it's our
[1:02:04] responsibility second Corinthians
[1:02:07] chapter three verse one
[1:02:08] do we begin again to commend ourselves
[1:02:12] or introduce ourselves that's what that
[1:02:17] means or need we as some others epistles
[1:02:20] of commendation to you or letters of
[1:02:23] combination from you I don't think we
[1:02:27] need to proclaim ourselves when we're
[1:02:29] trying to bring Christ to somebody our
[1:02:32] life and we don't need to introduce
[1:02:34] ourselves my name is John Martin and I
[1:02:39] really I am a believer of this endtime
[1:02:43] message and start with some sort of
[1:02:45] introductory no just let Christ be on
[1:02:52] display in your life let people see
[1:02:56] things that only Christ would be able to
[1:02:58] do it's your reaction and your love
[1:03:03] unconditional to them by this show men
[1:03:08] know you're my disciples when you have
[1:03:09] love one for another if the only way
[1:03:11] that people are going to see that is
[1:03:13] when you get hurt turn down stabbed in
[1:03:19] the back said something negative people
[1:03:23] just ah I ain't got time for you and
[1:03:27] when you can love them like your best
[1:03:30] friend
[1:03:30] now you've manifest is something that
[1:03:33] nobody else can do except Christ if
[1:03:38] people only see you love your friends
[1:03:41] then where is the reward but if you can
[1:03:45] love your enemies then you will have the
[1:03:47] reward of Christ being manifested in
[1:03:50] what honestly what greater reward is
[1:03:52] there
[1:03:54] it isn't about a show-off contest it's
[1:03:59] about being free from your flesh from
[1:04:02] your nature that just wants to stick
[1:04:04] your nose up at him and say I'll show
[1:04:06] you but to be free from that the better
[1:04:12] I love them unconditionally you can't
[1:04:15] even control it because it's Christ in
[1:04:17] you
[1:04:18] oh boy second Corinthians chapter 3
[1:04:23] verse 3 for as much as ye are manifestly
[1:04:27] declared to be the epistles of Christ
[1:04:31] ministered by us
[1:04:34] ilove that you have a big part to play
[1:04:38] in somebody there their character and
[1:04:41] their their coming to Christ and and and
[1:04:44] manifesting Christ you have a part to
[1:04:46] play and that's what what what Paul say
[1:04:48] in here the Epistle of Christ ministered
[1:04:51] by US written not with ink but the
[1:04:55] Spirit of the Living God not in tables
[1:04:57] of small stone but in fleshy tables of
[1:05:00] the heart now I can't put the Spirit of
[1:05:02] Christ in you but I can live such a life
[1:05:06] in front of you I could display Christ
[1:05:08] in such a way that you would hunger and
[1:05:11] desire to have that and say God fill me
[1:05:15] with that I want what he has
[1:05:20] you play a part and such trust have we
[1:05:25] through Christ to God word not that we
[1:05:27] are sufficient of herself to think of
[1:05:29] ourselves to think as ourselves but our
[1:05:32] sufficiency is of God who also have made
[1:05:39] us can you say made us amen made us able
[1:05:44] ministers capable ministers of the New
[1:05:49] Testament not of the letter but of the
[1:05:52] Spirit for when you preach it it can
[1:05:56] kill people but when you live it it can
[1:06:00] give life to somebody I'm not saying we
[1:06:05] don't share the word with our lips I'm
[1:06:07] not saying that but I tell you what
[1:06:13] catch catches my eyes when somebody's
[1:06:15] doing something that I know that they
[1:06:16] got to deny their flesh they got to lay
[1:06:20] down their reputation they got to lay
[1:06:22] down their time they got to lay down
[1:06:24] their pride hallelujah and they that's
[1:06:27] Jesus Christ now that's all I see left
[1:06:30] Jesus whining trying to help me praise
[1:06:37] the Lord brother Ben speaking of the
[1:06:41] bride in this hour and the choosing of a
[1:06:42] variety says she must have his character
[1:06:45] she must have his character in her the
[1:06:49] real true born-again crit Church must
[1:06:52] have the character that was in Christ
[1:06:55] because the husband the wife are one and
[1:06:56] if Jesus did only that which pleased God
[1:07:00] kept his word and manifested his word
[1:07:03] his bride will have to be the same kind
[1:07:05] of character now that character that the
[1:07:07] bride has not only keeps the word but
[1:07:11] she manifests it now I'll tell you that
[1:07:14] that that last word manifest that puts
[1:07:17] pressure on me because it's no longer
[1:07:20] what I know it's what I'm living the
[1:07:27] bride is the manifestation word for the
[1:07:30] hour she is the mystery of Christ
[1:07:34] revealed to people who don't even know
[1:07:36] Christ so my question to you is what
[1:07:39] about Christ in you where do you stand
[1:07:42] with this the hope of glory it's not
[1:07:46] just about you making it to glory
[1:07:49] it's about the others that you're on
[1:07:51] display with because God will not take
[1:07:56] you until it's time for you to go we
[1:07:59] have a work to do second Corinthians
[1:08:03] chapter 4 verse 5 for we preach not
[1:08:06] ourselves that's a good one right there
[1:08:11] amen but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[1:08:14] ourselves your servants for Jesus sake
[1:08:20] oftentimes when missionaries are
[1:08:26] communicating with us through emails in
[1:08:28] different ways they refer often to
[1:08:32] themselves as servants and I believe
[1:08:36] when it comes to helping others to other
[1:08:41] people we need to be their servant
[1:08:44] we're a servant for Jesus Christ you
[1:08:48] know you the only way you're gonna
[1:08:49] really serve God is by serving his
[1:08:51] people brother BAM said if you wanted to
[1:08:55] do something nice good for God do it for
[1:08:59] his people he says if you want to do
[1:09:02] something nice for me do it for my my
[1:09:04] children my family right didn't he say
[1:09:07] that we serve for God who commanded the
[1:09:14] light to shine out of darkness now do
[1:09:19] you remember last Wednesday service
[1:09:22] Ephesians 5:8 for ye were sometimes
[1:09:25] darkness but now are ye light in the
[1:09:30] Lord walk as children of light and hear
[1:09:33] Paul speaking to the Corinthians for God
[1:09:36] who commanded the light to shine out of
[1:09:39] darkness have shined in our hearts to
[1:09:42] give the light of the knowledge of the
[1:09:43] glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ
[1:09:45] when Christ came into us it was darkness
[1:09:50] and that light came in and it just
[1:09:53] shined out of our life a life begin to
[1:09:57] change we begin to do things different
[1:09:59] act different seat different things that
[1:10:05] light is not just for you we are the
[1:10:09] mystery of Jesus Christ revealed in this
[1:10:12] age shining out our lives are giving
[1:10:15] light to those who are in darkness
[1:10:18] you're no longer in darkness you were
[1:10:20] sometimes in darkness but now ye are
[1:10:23] light washes childrenht you are in the
[1:10:26] light you walk in the light you're
[1:10:28] bringing light to those around you why
[1:10:30] try brother John I just I told them over
[1:10:33] and I just tell them and and they don't
[1:10:35] listen
[1:10:35] well maybe ask God for it to let them
[1:10:38] see Christ in you well you know what
[1:10:42] that's gonna mean
[1:10:49] the bride is the only group of people
[1:10:52] that's going to manifest everything that
[1:10:54] Christ did Christ in us the hope that
[1:11:02] others may see glory the hope that
[1:11:06] others may see glory 2nd Corinthians 4
[1:11:10] verse 7 but we have this treasure in
[1:11:13] earthen vessels we have a treasure in
[1:11:17] here because the light is shined on here
[1:11:19] and there's a treasure it's called a
[1:11:21] treasure chest that the excellency of
[1:11:25] the power may be of God and not of us
[1:11:29] there it is right there the power is of
[1:11:34] God we just need to use that key that
[1:11:37] key of faith we know it's the power of
[1:11:42] God and lies by how we react to problems
[1:11:47] because look at verse 8 because when we
[1:11:50] are troubled on every side
[1:11:53] we're not distressed one more perplexed
[1:11:57] we're not despair
[1:11:59] when we're persecuted we know we're not
[1:12:03] forsaken you'll never leave us nor
[1:12:04] forsake us when we're cast down that's
[1:12:08] ok we get back up we're not destroyed
[1:12:11] we're always varying about in our bodies
[1:12:16] the dying of the Lord Jesus that the
[1:12:19] life also of Jesus might be made
[1:12:21] manifest in our bodies Jesus can't be
[1:12:24] manifested in you without you being dead
[1:12:28] to yourself
[1:12:30] Jesus is not gonna die in there just
[1:12:32] wipe out what you got going so he can
[1:12:35] shine his light he's looking for vessels
[1:12:38] that are willing to surrender him so he
[1:12:40] can come into their hearts and live
[1:12:43] their life in front of somebody he's
[1:12:46] interested in other people for we which
[1:12:50] live are always delivered unto the death
[1:12:52] for Jesus sake always I thought it was
[1:12:56] just once so it's just at the beginning
[1:12:59] I thought I was I to do is get baptized
[1:13:01] you know a nervous
[1:13:02] you were when you got baptized I don't
[1:13:05] want to do this I'm gonna do this in
[1:13:07] front of people it's scary feel uneasy
[1:13:11] why can't they just bypass this part I
[1:13:14] promise to believe and boy we get that
[1:13:19] done it was like God all over with it
[1:13:23] was great we felt free but we stuff to
[1:13:27] continue to die because Satan gets in
[1:13:30] our minds and gets us to think certain
[1:13:32] things and we then we do certain things
[1:13:34] we say certain things and before you
[1:13:36] know it we're being used by him instead
[1:13:38] of God the way we want to be and I'll
[1:13:40] tell you we need to die out to that how
[1:13:42] are other people going to see Jesus
[1:13:44] Christ when told you got to tell them is
[1:13:46] what you think is right hey just turn on
[1:13:52] the news you don't like CNN watch NBC
[1:13:54] you don't like NBC watch a fo X F and I
[1:14:02] say that Fox you can hear what you want
[1:14:06] to hear but when you see a life
[1:14:09] demonstrated you can't deny Jesus Christ
[1:14:14] for we are always delivered unto the
[1:14:17] death delivered for Jesus's sake that
[1:14:21] the life also of Jesus might be made
[1:14:22] manifest in our mortal flesh so then
[1:14:25] death worketh in US but life in you so
[1:14:30] who is God interested in your life
[1:14:32] others amen how many love the word Amen
[1:14:38] just say Amen to the word your flesh
[1:14:40] don't like this I'm not asking for your
[1:14:42] flesh to say Amen
[1:14:43] I'm asking for the Spirit of God that
[1:14:46] soul that belongs to God to say amen to
[1:14:48] that word amen first John chapter 3
[1:14:52] verse 16 howbeit perceive we the love of
[1:14:55] God because he laid down his life for us
[1:14:58] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[1:15:00] brother yes Amen isn't that good
[1:15:03] brothers you would not believe how many
[1:15:04] things that were said today in those
[1:15:06] men's meetings just same thing happened
[1:15:10] as last Wednesday now some some
[1:15:13] believers don't like to think
[1:15:16] about laying down their lives for others
[1:15:18] as if the treasure that's inside of them
[1:15:21] is only for them no Christ wants us
[1:15:27] manifested to the world to those that we
[1:15:32] live with in this world those that we
[1:15:35] rub shoulders with he is so desperately
[1:15:38] thinking I need brother John to lay down
[1:15:43] his life just a little bit so that
[1:15:46] person there that he's talking to you
[1:15:48] will see me but if my mind is so
[1:15:54] interested in something else do what I
[1:15:59] got to do to get to it but got on the
[1:16:02] back burner come on I really appreciated
[1:16:12] something but other sudden in our men's
[1:16:15] meeting today we get so caught up
[1:16:19] thinking that Christ is only interested
[1:16:22] in the things that we want God has his
[1:16:27] own desires too you know and his
[1:16:30] thoughts are much higher than her
[1:16:31] thoughts his ways are much higher than
[1:16:34] our ways and we need to think about
[1:16:39] those things eternal things so much more
[1:16:42] a soul is eternal thing second
[1:16:48] Corinthians chapter 5 verse 15 and if
[1:16:50] Christ died for all then they which live
[1:16:53] should not henceforth live unto
[1:16:54] themselves but unto which died for them
[1:16:58] and rose again so Christ wants us
[1:17:02] manifested to those and around us he
[1:17:04] wants us to unveil Christ to them the
[1:17:08] bride is the mystery of Christ revealed
[1:17:13] brother Branham said all that was in God
[1:17:16] he poured into Christ all that was in
[1:17:20] Christ he poured into the church the
[1:17:22] bride and I believe all that's in the
[1:17:26] bride he is manifesting to the world
[1:17:30] today she is the mystery of Christ
[1:17:32] revealed to the world I'll think about
[1:17:34] it
[1:17:35] what about Christ in you the hope of
[1:17:39] them making it to glory
[1:17:43] she is not announcing herself for an
[1:17:46] adducing herself as Miss Jesus nope
[1:17:50] she's announcing Christ with her life
[1:17:54] she's manifesting the Living Word
[1:17:57] she's unveiling the mystery of Christ to
[1:18:00] others she's on display for the world to
[1:18:04] see
[1:18:04] see brother band said I'd much rather
[1:18:07] have someone live me a sermon than
[1:18:09] preached me one you know we all have
[1:18:13] that great opportunity but what it takes
[1:18:17] is just getting a little bit more
[1:18:19] serious about our ministry about our
[1:18:23] sermons don't wait to the next church
[1:18:27] service to live out your sermon the
[1:18:32] church world is so confused in this hour
[1:18:36] they don't know what's right they don't
[1:18:38] know what's wrong it's like listening to
[1:18:42] the news the more you listen to the news
[1:18:44] the more confused you yet I thought I
[1:18:48] was confused in January February March
[1:18:52] it's getting worse and worse
[1:18:56] Satan's the author confusion just like
[1:19:00] the church world they're further away
[1:19:02] today than they were ten years ago
[1:19:05] twenty years ago
[1:19:08] the church has gotten so cold cooled off
[1:19:14] they really don't know what it means to
[1:19:16] be born again they're perfectly content
[1:19:21] with just a form of godliness their
[1:19:24] attitude shows that the power of the
[1:19:27] Holy Ghost in their everyday lives isn't
[1:19:29] that necessary they can still be a
[1:19:32] believer without it
[1:19:33] in the message the key to the door
[1:19:36] brother Bannon said that's the reason
[1:19:38] the great miracles and signs are not
[1:19:42] done amongst the people today
[1:19:43] that there used to be they've lost the
[1:19:47] key to the door and Jesus said I believe
[1:19:52] it's in Luke chapter 18 when he returned
[1:19:55] shall he find faith on the earth we need
[1:19:58] faith in this hour there's such a
[1:20:01] confusion that the devil has created in
[1:20:04] the church and people need to see Christ
[1:20:06] in you the hope of glory it's the only
[1:20:09] hope that people have they your words
[1:20:13] may be absolutely 100 percent correct
[1:20:15] when you speak to them but that's not
[1:20:19] enough to catch their attention
[1:20:21] why did brother remember when God sent
[1:20:26] Moses to the children of Israel first
[1:20:29] and gave them signs they don't believe
[1:20:32] the first time they lead the second what
[1:20:35] did brother Branham say that this
[1:20:37] healing and this discernment was their
[1:20:42] bait to get the attention of the people
[1:20:51] well you know we're in our if we don't
[1:20:54] got the gift
[1:20:56] that brother Brandon had we still got
[1:21:00] the life that should get their attention
[1:21:12] always be ready to give a hope for what
[1:21:19] lies within you to somebody who's got an
[1:21:22] ear to listen the hope of others seen
[1:21:26] glory is when they see the mystery of
[1:21:30] Christ unveiled through you when they
[1:21:35] see you loving without respect to
[1:21:37] persons when they see you living humbly
[1:21:42] reacting humbly and meek walking in the
[1:21:46] spirit not fulfilling the lust of the
[1:21:49] flesh not all puffed up or boasting
[1:21:52] about yourself not seeking your own
[1:21:55] things and talking about your own things
[1:21:57] rather seeking the things of others
[1:21:59] caring about others not so easily
[1:22:02] provoked you know some people get so
[1:22:05] easily provoked to think evil to react
[1:22:09] negatively it's not about the letter
[1:22:12] it's about the spirit of the word living
[1:22:16] through you to others it's our
[1:22:21] responsibility Saints to unveil Christ
[1:22:23] to others it isn't God's what I mean you
[1:22:30] don't just go live off to yourself
[1:22:31] anymore but we're in debt in debt to
[1:22:36] what in debt to let Christ live through
[1:22:40] you that they may come to know him
[1:22:43] because somebody gave up their life for
[1:22:45] you somebody gave up their time for you
[1:22:50] think about the people in your life the
[1:22:54] people that were in your life that are
[1:22:57] in your life that gave their time for
[1:23:00] you now you're in debt to God I'll just
[1:23:11] say it like this pass it forward pass it
[1:23:16] forward you ever go over the the
[1:23:20] Mackinac Bridge and somebody paid for
[1:23:22] you oh yeah I think so I'll just keep
[1:23:26] buying money then or you can give it and
[1:23:30] say hey pay for the guy behind me pay
[1:23:33] forward let God use you to help somebody
[1:23:39] it isn't what you know it's who you know
[1:23:46] it ain't the knowledge of the word if
[1:23:49] the love of the word it's the spirit of
[1:23:52] that word living in you manifested to
[1:23:55] others where the RAM said in the message
[1:23:59] running from the presence of Lord I've
[1:24:01] read this a number of times but he says
[1:24:02] we must accept our responsibility we
[1:24:06] have a responsibility to unveil Christ
[1:24:09] before people and the responsibility
[1:24:14] that God has given us in this day is to
[1:24:17] bring this message and as I get older I
[1:24:21] know my days are shortening up I feel
[1:24:24] the responsibility greater than I've
[1:24:26] ever felt press on we must do it we must
[1:24:31] get down to it in every where we go and
[1:24:35] telling the message and telling the
[1:24:38] people that Jesus Christ is coming that
[1:24:41] he's God and he's coming soon and
[1:24:43] there's not a hope left for the world
[1:24:46] but the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:24:48] in you the hope of glory
[1:24:50] he says there's not a hope in the world
[1:24:52] and it's our responsibility to give them
[1:24:55] that hope and we do that by manifesting
[1:25:01] Christ we do that by receiving more of
[1:25:05] the Holy Ghost in our lives by loving
[1:25:08] him and obeying him more so that others
[1:25:10] can see Jesus in us turn with me if you
[1:25:13] would to John chapter 14 verse 8
[1:25:26] Philip saith unto Jesus Lord show us the
[1:25:31] father and it suffice us us so here
[1:25:35] Peter was saying I I want to see the
[1:25:40] father and we know brother Branham says
[1:25:42] if you want to know God just look at
[1:25:46] Jesus Christ this is kind of the message
[1:25:48] that Jesus is now his tone-tone feeder
[1:25:51] Philip I mean jesus saith unto Philip
[1:25:54] have I been so long time with you
[1:25:58] and yet that was not know me Philip
[1:26:02] he that have seen me have seen the
[1:26:05] father and how they'll say is now then
[1:26:08] show us the father believe us though not
[1:26:12] that I am in the father and the father
[1:26:14] and me the words that I speak are not of
[1:26:17] myself but the father that dwelleth in
[1:26:18] me he doeth the works now believe me
[1:26:21] that I am in the father and the father
[1:26:23] and me or else believe me for the very
[1:26:24] works sake
[1:26:27] now he's getting Philip to take his eyes
[1:26:32] off of the flesh off of his words even
[1:26:39] though his words were of the father and
[1:26:41] he says just look at my works who else
[1:26:43] does this as I'm saying if you really
[1:26:48] really want to give hope to somebody let
[1:26:51] them see Jesus in you let them see the
[1:26:53] works of Christ in you verily verily I
[1:26:58] say to you he that believeth on me the
[1:26:59] works I do shall he do also and greater
[1:27:04] a men and greater praise the Lord John
[1:27:11] 14 verse 19 yet a little while and the
[1:27:16] world seeth me no more but ye shall see
[1:27:18] me because I live you shall live also
[1:27:19] and at that day you shall know that I'm
[1:27:22] in the father and ye and me and I in you
[1:27:34] I in the father all that was in God he
[1:27:43] poured all that was in the Father he
[1:27:45] poured it in Christ and Christ was in
[1:27:52] the father and you in me and I in you
[1:27:56] and he that that we are the mystery of
[1:28:01] Christ revealed to the world because we
[1:28:04] have Christ in us he's in us living in
[1:28:06] us he that had my Commandments and
[1:28:09] keepeth them he it is that loveth me and
[1:28:11] he that loveth me shall be loved of my
[1:28:13] father and I will love him and will
[1:28:15] manifest myself to him now remember when
[1:28:19] God unveiled something to you it now
[1:28:23] becomes manifested in your life that
[1:28:29] hasn't happened with the second it'll
[1:28:30] Shh
[1:28:31] it will soon happen Judas saith unto Him
[1:28:35] not Iscariot Lord how was it that that
[1:28:37] was manifest or show myself unto us and
[1:28:40] not unto the world and jesus answered
[1:28:44] now notice it's not an outward
[1:28:45] appearance remember that the kingdom of
[1:28:47] God doesn't come with observation it
[1:28:50] comes within so he's gonna answer this
[1:28:55] he says if a man love me he will keep my
[1:28:59] words so now we're talking about a love
[1:29:02] affair he's he's answering the question
[1:29:04] how he's going to manifest himself - to
[1:29:07] - to his disciples but not aunt I was up
[1:29:10] to why he's imprudent if a man love me
[1:29:13] he will keep my words and my father will
[1:29:17] love him and we will come unto him and
[1:29:23] make our abode with him isn't that
[1:29:26] beautiful
[1:29:30] the father is in you Jesus is in you the
[1:29:35] Holy Ghost is in you you know what's
[1:29:38] happening if you let him have his way he
[1:29:43] wants you to lay down your life for
[1:29:45] somebody else
[1:29:47] that's where he's at he's not about you
[1:29:51] doing something and then you've taken
[1:29:54] all the credit for or tootin your horn
[1:29:58] like you got something to do with it lay
[1:30:03] down your life for others John 17 look
[1:30:05] where we're going with this John 17
[1:30:07] verse 20 neither pray I for these alone
[1:30:09] but for them also which shall believe on
[1:30:12] me through their word now it ain't just
[1:30:16] natural word spiritual word living word
[1:30:20] manifested word amen
[1:30:24] that and I'll show you where right here
[1:30:28] that they all may be one as thou father
[1:30:31] art me and I in thee never all that was
[1:30:34] in God he poured into Christ all that
[1:30:37] was in grace important to the church
[1:30:38] that they also may be one in us that the
[1:30:42] world may believe that thou hast sent me
[1:30:48] how else are they going to see how else
[1:30:51] are they going to believe and the glory
[1:30:54] which thou gave us me I've given them
[1:30:56] that they may be one even as we are one
[1:30:58] I in them and thou in me that they may
[1:31:00] be perfect and one that the world may
[1:31:02] know that thou has sent me and has loved
[1:31:08] them as thou has loved me by this shall
[1:31:10] all men know you're my disciples when
[1:31:14] you have a different type of love the
[1:31:19] type of love that only Christ could have
[1:31:23] for us because I didn't care about him I
[1:31:26] remember having such negative thoughts
[1:31:29] about God selfish thoughts how could you
[1:31:35] love me and make me have to do that then
[1:31:40] he loved oh yeah
[1:31:43] evil thoughts but you know he still
[1:31:46] loved me
[1:31:49] let God use your body like that
[1:31:52] let him use your mind like that god is
[1:31:56] awesome he is the creator of all things
[1:31:59] he created her Souls he's the author of
[1:32:01] our eternal life that he's given us God
[1:32:05] is awesome
[1:32:06] Christ is awesome look at neat Nicodemus
[1:32:10] his own testimony says we know that our
[1:32:12] a man come from God no man can do these
[1:32:14] things except God be with him the
[1:32:20] beautiful thing is you're awesome too
[1:32:25] because now Christ is in you and when
[1:32:30] people look at you they say you are a
[1:32:33] you are a human that's part of that
[1:32:36] bride of Jesus Christ because no wife
[1:32:40] can do the things that you're doing
[1:32:43] except God be with her Jesus Christ is
[1:32:50] still doing great things he's just doing
[1:32:54] him and his bride he is the same
[1:32:57] yesterday today and forever won't you
[1:33:02] consider Christ in you what about Christ
[1:33:07] in you
[1:33:16] Colossians chapter 1 verse 16 we're
[1:33:18] coming down to an to a close here but
[1:33:21] this I'm telling you this the service is
[1:33:23] way shorter than brother Adam sermon
[1:33:26] that he preached way shorter way sure
[1:33:31] plush ins chapter 1 verse 16 Jesus
[1:33:34] Christ is the image of the invisible God
[1:33:38] the firstborn among many creature for by
[1:33:40] him we're all things created that are in
[1:33:43] heaven and on earth visible and
[1:33:45] invisible whether they be Thrones or
[1:33:47] dominions principalities powers all
[1:33:48] things were created by him and for him
[1:33:51] for him and he is before all things and
[1:33:55] by him all things consist
[1:33:58] he is the common denominator everything
[1:34:01] that we see and he is the head of the
[1:34:08] body he is the head of this church amen
[1:34:13] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:34:16] the dead that in all things he might
[1:34:20] have the preeminence and that's why
[1:34:22] we're against any spirit that tries to
[1:34:25] take the preeminence away from God any
[1:34:32] spirit that tries to take the
[1:34:34] preeminence away from God we're against
[1:34:37] it it's not the right spirit because God
[1:34:42] wants the preeminence how many can say
[1:34:45] he meant to the word for it please the
[1:34:47] father that in him should all fullness
[1:34:50] dwell so whatever God was Jesus was
[1:34:57] whatever God is Jesus is whatever God
[1:35:01] will be Jesus will be for Jesus is the
[1:35:05] same yesterday today and forever
[1:35:08] God is a creator Jesus Christ is a
[1:35:13] creator we all things were created by
[1:35:16] him we just read it God is a redeemer
[1:35:19] Jesus is a redeemer God is our Savior
[1:35:23] Jesus is our Savior God is our healer
[1:35:30] Jesus is our healer the Bible says that
[1:35:33] he heal with our diseases but the Bible
[1:35:36] also says by His stripes that Jesus bore
[1:35:40] we are healed God is love Jesus is love
[1:35:51] the Bible says when he looked over the
[1:35:54] multitude he had compassion as he saw
[1:35:58] them a sheep scattered that didn't have
[1:36:00] a shepherd so how is Jesus looking at
[1:36:04] the people you look at every day does he
[1:36:08] is he have compassion on those people he
[1:36:11] does are you what about Christ in you is
[1:36:15] he having compassion
[1:36:18] now it's Jesus Christ in you the hope of
[1:36:22] glory
[1:36:23] people see you creating an atmosphere
[1:36:28] because you can do that your Creator
[1:36:31] that is pointing them higher closer to
[1:36:36] Christ provoking them to good works
[1:36:38] remember our opening scripture warning
[1:36:40] every man teaching every man in all
[1:36:43] wisdom that's Christ that's Christ in
[1:36:45] Paul what about Christ in you you got
[1:36:47] that same ministry they're seeing Christ
[1:36:52] the Redeemer inside of you
[1:36:56] that's right trying to get them closer
[1:37:00] to Christ trying to show them that
[1:37:04] there's hope for them that there's a
[1:37:06] redeemer for them as you're standing in
[1:37:09] the gap for them Christ in you they that
[1:37:14] win souls is wise you become part of the
[1:37:17] plan of salvation you play an important
[1:37:20] role someone that's praying the prayer
[1:37:25] of faith over them for their healing
[1:37:28] this is this gives them hope when they
[1:37:35] see Galatians 5:22
[1:37:37] when they see the love of God Galatians
[1:37:41] 5:22
[1:37:42] for the fruit of the Spirit is love when
[1:37:45] they see the spirit of love on you the
[1:37:49] spirit of love if it's a living thing
[1:37:52] when they see joy in you not that you
[1:37:57] won the lottery but that there's some
[1:38:02] soul getting help right now
[1:38:04] when they see you happy about that they
[1:38:07] see joy when they see you having peace
[1:38:10] when nothing's going your way you're
[1:38:15] becoming Christ you're giving somebody
[1:38:17] hope when they when you're getting
[1:38:21] provoked to all get-out and you're not
[1:38:24] bothered
[1:38:24] you're just long suffering you're givin
[1:38:27] somebody hope when when the lion nature
[1:38:32] comes out at you and just but you're
[1:38:35] nothing on display except gentleness
[1:38:38] that's Christ in you you're giving
[1:38:40] somebody hope I'm telling you goodness
[1:38:43] faith temperance maintenance against
[1:38:47] such there is no law the fruit of the
[1:38:51] Spirit remember it's not the fruit of
[1:38:53] John Martin if you want to see the fruit
[1:38:57] of John Martin come on over for dinner
[1:39:00] and round but the fruit of Jesus Christ
[1:39:06] the more we die the more the people are
[1:39:08] going to see the love of God amen like
[1:39:14] the clothes and saying this that today
[1:39:15] the bride is the mystery of Jesus Christ
[1:39:18] revealed and you you are the one that
[1:39:23] gives people hope it's Christ in you
[1:39:28] look for the opportunity to display
[1:39:31] Christ in a way that people would say
[1:39:34] that had to be Christ and not because
[1:39:39] somebody was thinking the same thing
[1:39:43] that you talked to them about but
[1:39:48] because
[1:39:48] you were in such a pickle and they saw
[1:39:52] Christ manifested in the flesh it'll
[1:39:56] give them hope this is the hour that our
[1:39:59] light should be shining the most
[1:40:01] now what about Christ in you is the
[1:40:08] world stopping to talk about what they'd
[1:40:11] seen happening in your life are they
[1:40:16] seeing Christ being revealed before them
[1:40:20] manifested before them loving them when
[1:40:23] everybody else gave up on them are they
[1:40:26] stopping to talk about it are they
[1:40:30] stopping to consider look at that Grand
[1:40:34] Canyon look at that mountain look at the
[1:40:36] ocean
[1:40:37] look at those birds look at that bride
[1:40:43] are they taking time to stand in awe
[1:40:47] that you lay down your life for them
[1:40:51] you're the only hope that this world has
[1:40:54] a willing vessel that will go out and
[1:40:58] share Christ with others yes it's all
[1:41:07] about our love affair let's stand
[1:41:08] together you are the mystery of Christ
[1:41:15] revealed Christ is in you not only the
[1:41:21] hope of you making it to glory but it is
[1:41:25] the hope of others making it to glory as
[1:41:27] you manifest Christ to them amen
[1:41:34] maybe we could just before we sing a
[1:41:37] song maybe we could just bow our hearts
[1:41:42] just thinking on these things
[1:41:49] people need the Lord but are they seeing
[1:41:55] the Lord in us I know we're giving them
[1:42:01] the words but are they seeing the
[1:42:08] manifestation of the words it's
[1:42:13] something that we have to be so
[1:42:15] conscious of and so thinking of all the
[1:42:19] time no matter what we're doing what's
[1:42:21] happening that all they must see Jesus
[1:42:24] in me this is the hour this is the time
[1:42:27] this is the situation that they need to
[1:42:29] see Jesus in me and maybe this evening
[1:42:38] you're considering what about Christ in
[1:42:40] you maybe you're here today and you
[1:42:49] really want people to see more of Christ
[1:42:52] in you you want to lay down your life
[1:42:57] that others may be able to find life

[1:45:20] feelings that's not by scientists it's
