[29:00] Just over in the glory land will live
[29:04] eternally.
[29:06] The saints on every hand are shouting
[29:10] victory.
[29:11] Their singing swings they pray. Drift
[29:15] back from heaven's shore. And I can't
[29:18] feel at home in this world anymore.
[29:23] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[29:27] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[29:32] what will I do? The angels beckoning me
[29:37] from heaven's open door. And I can't
[29:41] feel at home in this world anymore.
[29:46] Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like
[29:50] you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord,
[29:55] what will I do? The angels beckon me
[30:00] from heaven's open door and I can't feel
[30:04] at home in this world anymore.

[36:03] Amen.
[36:06] &gt;&gt; Greetings everyone in the name of Jesus
[36:08] Christ. It's good to be in the house of
[36:11] the Lord this morning.
[36:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible said where two or three
[36:16] are gathered uh he will be in the midst
[36:19] of us and we are more than two and
[36:21] three. Amen. Thank the Lord for the
[36:23] goodness he has bestowed on every one of
[36:26] us and so grateful to God that God has
[36:30] uh once again you know made a way for me
[36:33] to come by uh this place and share with
[36:37] you what the Lord is doing and he's
[36:40] going to do and he's done in our lives.
[36:42] Uh thank you brother John for giving me
[36:45] this place and appreciate it and the
[36:47] lord bless you. You know let us read
[36:50] from the word of god
[36:52] 2 Timothy chapter 4 verse 7 and 8.
[36:58] It's a very familiar scripture and uh we
[37:01] might have heard many sermons on this uh
[37:05] the scriptures but you know one thing I
[37:08] have found out that every time I read a
[37:12] scripture or I go through a scripture
[37:14] it's new to us you know so so let us uh
[37:18] listen let us wait upon the lord and see
[37:20] what the lord has in store for us this
[37:23] morning you know uh let us be attentive
[37:26] let us give the lord his place so that
[37:29] he can do great wonders and miracles in
[37:33] our life. 2 Timothy chapter 4 7 and 8. I
[37:38] have fought a good fight.
[37:40] I have finished my course. I have kept
[37:43] the faith. Henceforth there is laid up
[37:47] for me a crown of righteousness which
[37:50] the Lord the righteous judge shall give
[37:53] me at that day. and not to me only but
[37:57] unto all them also that love is
[38:01] appearing.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; You may be seated. May the Lord bless
[38:04] you this morning. Once again, I would
[38:07] like to thank the bride of Jesus Christ.
[38:09] I would like to thank the man of God,
[38:11] brother John, for giving me this place.
[38:14] And you know, um I pray that my presence
[38:17] here uh the time I stand would be a
[38:21] great blessing to every one of you.
[38:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. have not come with any different
[38:25] doctrine or different things but I only
[38:28] have come with the pure unadulterated
[38:31] one of word of god you know so I would
[38:34] like to just give a brief uh uh a short
[38:38] uh report on what the lord has been
[38:40] doing uh the lord is good after I left
[38:43] in uh during my last trip went back to
[38:47] India I baptized about 67 new souls
[38:51] &gt;&gt; and I thank the lord for his grace and
[38:53] mercy.
[38:58] &gt;&gt; Just before I came within a span of 13
[39:00] days, I baptized about 32 people and
[39:03] that was a great blessing for me and the
[39:07] ministry also that you know there's one
[39:10] thing about uh saving souls you know and
[39:13] uh you get so much of peace and joy. uh
[39:18] you go through stress in life, you go
[39:20] through ups and downs in life, but you
[39:22] know when it comes to soul-winning you
[39:25] know
[39:26] &gt;&gt; it's something different you know
[39:28] &gt;&gt; there's so much of peace and there is so
[39:30] much of joy in it that you know you are
[39:32] doing something for the Lord Jesus
[39:34] Christ and I'm so thankful to God that
[39:37] God has made me able to be a part of his
[39:41] vineyard you know and we are all the
[39:44] workers of his vineyard we are all you
[39:47] know partakers of you know everything we
[39:51] do to serve the lord and bring glory to
[39:53] god. So I'm just a little part of that
[39:56] you know a little tool which god is
[39:58] using me in the nation of India. Uh the
[40:01] situation back home uh the persecution
[40:04] is is very much on the rise since I left
[40:08] in May. You know it has been very bad.
[40:11] you know the government is trying to
[40:13] bring so many rules and so many
[40:16] regulations you know and uh on the 29th
[40:20] October you know um the 13th state of
[40:24] our c of of our country has come with
[40:27] the anti-conversion law so day by day
[40:31] each state are embracing this
[40:33] anti-conversion law and it is putting us
[40:36] preachers in trouble you know so uh it's
[40:39] not yet come into our state but I truly
[40:42] believe that you know the the prime
[40:44] minister of our country is trying to uh
[40:47] force you know this bill to be passed in
[40:50] all the 29 states and and the few union
[40:54] territories in India so it's a squeeze
[40:58] squeezing time you know you know it's a
[41:01] time to wrap up you know the prophet
[41:04] said it's a time to unpack ourself you
[41:07] know you know and wait for the coming of
[41:09] the lord you Because very soon, one day
[41:12] we have to take a solo flight. You know,
[41:15] &gt;&gt; we have to meet the rapture. You know,
[41:18] is there anybody who doesn't think of
[41:19] the rapture here?
[41:22] &gt;&gt; No one. Amen. Everybody is thinking
[41:24] about the rapture, you know. What a
[41:26] glorious day that will be that we will
[41:28] all see him face to face, you know. So,
[41:32] uh the Lord is good. I bring greetings
[41:34] from my family, you know, and uh God has
[41:37] blessed me with, you know, four
[41:39] children, you know, three daughters and
[41:42] one son, one son-in-law and one
[41:44] daughter-in-law and two grandchildren,
[41:47] Jason and Josie. You know, uh please
[41:50] remember Josie in your prayers. She's
[41:52] having a little bit of breathing
[41:53] problem, breathing issues. And uh the
[41:56] doctor says so many things but you know
[41:59] I believe the great physician Jesus
[42:01] Christ who is in the midst of us. So uh
[42:04] please remember Josie in your prayers.
[42:06] She's just 5 years old you know the
[42:09] other day u she was crying and she was
[42:12] battling for you know to breathe and uh
[42:15] but the Lord is good you know she's I
[42:17] just spoke to them this morning and they
[42:20] are doing better you know. So when it's
[42:22] morning here it's night over there you
[42:25] know. So it's almost a big uh I'm still
[42:28] fighting the jet lag. So pray for me
[42:30] too. You know that uh the remaining trip
[42:33] would be a blessing not only to me but
[42:36] also to the ministry back home. You know
[42:39] we sure appreciate uh what the send of
[42:41] send the light is doing. Amen. Uh this
[42:44] church has been a great blessing as well
[42:46] as uh a part and parcel of our ministry
[42:51] in India. you know,
[42:52] &gt;&gt; I I truly want to thank the almighty God
[42:55] first and then I would like to thank uh
[42:57] the man of God, brother John, you know,
[43:00] so he's such a wonderful man of God, you
[43:03] know, I don't want to praise a man, but
[43:06] I want to praise the God who is in that
[43:08] man, you know, such a caring and uh
[43:11] personality and loving personality, you
[43:14] know, and I I surely appreciate God and
[43:17] I thank God for bringing him and his
[43:20] family and the church, send the light
[43:23] church into our lives and to our
[43:25] ministry in India.
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Just pray for us that we will be more
[43:30] faithful, you know, to take care of
[43:32] those orphans and leprosy people and
[43:35] also uh take care of the elderly and the
[43:38] widows and and the ministers you know
[43:41] who are working in association with us,
[43:43] you know, and we are trying to do what
[43:45] best we can do. Um the road is rough you
[43:49] know but as the sermon title says we
[43:53] need to finish strong you know finishing
[43:56] strong when the battle gets rough you
[43:59] know when the battle get fierce you know
[44:01] so that is the only time that we need to
[44:03] stand up guard our loins and we need to
[44:06] face the heat of the battle you know
[44:08] &gt;&gt; the prophet of god said that it's
[44:11] Christian life is not a flowery bed of
[44:14] ease you know you know it's not the bed
[44:16] of roses but it is always you know we
[44:19] have to go through trials and troubles
[44:22] in our life you know and I always share
[44:24] it with myself my family and the and the
[44:28] family of God I say I would rather walk
[44:34] with Christ in the dark valley you know
[44:36] in the lowest valleys than to walk in
[44:39] the light alone you know
[44:41] &gt;&gt; I don't want to be alone anywhere
[44:43] whether it is darkness or whether it is
[44:45] light but I want my Christ to be with
[44:47] me. So please pray for the souls which
[44:50] are being won and you know that they
[44:53] would be faithful you know because our
[44:55] government is trying to uh threaten them
[44:59] and make them you know bring them back
[45:02] to recon conversion into Hinduism you
[45:05] know so but the seed is the seed you
[45:10] know
[45:10] &gt;&gt; amen
[45:11] &gt;&gt; the shak is the shock it has to go away
[45:13] you know and I truly believe that you
[45:15] know uh as the persecution is on the
[45:17] rise Guys, I have seen that God is
[45:21] working in many of the lives of the
[45:23] people in India.
[45:25] &gt;&gt; Many are thirsting for the word of God.
[45:28] Many are coming into the light of this
[45:30] this great message of the hour. You
[45:32] know,
[45:34] &gt;&gt; many people are giving their hearts to
[45:36] Christ. So, that's the good sign. You
[45:38] know,
[45:39] &gt;&gt; I don't care, you know, how much squeeze
[45:41] is going to come or how much pressure is
[45:44] going to come. You know the prophet of
[45:46] God said you know it's a contest between
[45:48] two strengths the great strength of God
[45:52] and the great strength of the enemy you
[45:54] know
[45:54] &gt;&gt; but who will win
[45:56] &gt;&gt; the Bible has already said you know that
[45:58] we will win that's why Paul boldly could
[46:02] say nay in all things we are more than
[46:05] conquerors so I truly believe that you
[46:07] know uh let us live with that attitude
[46:10] and let us go forward marching you know
[46:14] We need to finish strong.
[46:17] &gt;&gt; We need to endure it till the end. It
[46:20] doesn't matter how much the battle is
[46:22] going to be rough and fierce. You know,
[46:26] it's good to serve the Lord when you are
[46:29] sick.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[46:31] &gt;&gt; I would rather be a sick man and serve
[46:34] the Lord than to be a a good man or a
[46:36] you know strong man and then not to
[46:38] serve the Lord, you know. So, so it's
[46:41] all about what we are doing in our
[46:44] situations, in our circumstances, you
[46:46] know. As I woke up this morning, I could
[46:49] see everything white, you know, and snow
[46:51] everywhere. So, it gives me joy when I
[46:54] see the snow, you know, but uh a little
[46:57] snow is good, you know, but more I I
[47:00] think I would be in big trouble, you
[47:01] know. So because I come from a country
[47:03] you know which has got so much of heat
[47:06] you know and uh I'm not used to the
[47:09] sweaters and all those things you know
[47:11] so but you know when I see people
[47:13] everywhere you know wearing sweaters and
[47:17] caps you know and shoes and everything
[47:20] so it makes me wonder how they are able
[47:22] to survive you know so but but thank god
[47:26] you know that uh the the the place here
[47:29] is warmer you know it's it's Good to
[47:32] serve the Lord this morning. Nice to see
[47:34] every one of you. You know I would like
[47:36] to just talk for few not much time but
[47:39] you know just encourage you and you know
[47:41] comfort you with the word of God. You
[47:43] know here we see the life of Apostle
[47:45] Paul.
[47:48] &gt;&gt; That man is such a great example for
[47:50] every one of us. You know here we see
[47:53] that you know Apostle Paul when he
[47:55] writes this you know he's near the
[47:57] nearing the end of his life you know
[48:00] &gt;&gt; but he's reflecting his journey of faith
[48:04] here you know you know he's boldly he's
[48:07] not talking about his merits he's not
[48:09] talking about his achievements you know
[48:12] he's in the end of his life he's in the
[48:14] prison you know but he's declaring that
[48:18] he has faithfully endured every battles
[48:23] of life which he has come through and
[48:25] gone through. You know see today we need
[48:28] to be in such a position that as we walk
[48:31] in this journey as we go forward we need
[48:34] to reflect also
[48:37] on our walk before the walk which we
[48:40] started many years ago. You know
[48:42] &gt;&gt; how our walk has been with the Lord. You
[48:46] know, you know how we have been in the
[48:49] valleys, how we have been in the
[48:51] mountains, you know, because we believe
[48:53] the Bible says our God is not only the
[48:56] God of the mountain, but he is also the
[48:58] God of the valley. Amen.
[49:00] &gt;&gt; So we need to reflect sometimes you know
[49:03] we have become so busy you know and I
[49:06] always say you know we are busy for
[49:08] nothing you know
[49:10] &gt;&gt; many a times you you just talk to
[49:12] anybody they say I am busy I am busy but
[49:15] I think you know we are busy for nothing
[49:18] you know
[49:19] &gt;&gt; people have learned the art of doing
[49:22] nothing
[49:24] that's true you know people have learned
[49:27] the art of doing nothing you You know
[49:30] &gt;&gt; that's why they are busy you know
[49:33] &gt;&gt; sometimes I wonder you know come to the
[49:36] field in India come to the you know the
[49:39] ministry see the ministry in India there
[49:42] is so much to do you know but there are
[49:45] very few to do you know
[49:47] &gt;&gt; harvest is plenty but the laborers are
[49:49] few
[49:53] we need to realize we need to reflect we
[49:55] need to take time in our life to See how
[49:59] our walk has been all these years, you
[50:02] know.
[50:04] &gt;&gt; Look at this man. You know, he's he's is
[50:06] shackled. He's in chains. He's bound in
[50:09] chains.
[50:10] You know, he's in such a critical
[50:13] situation. But look, he's not looking at
[50:16] his pain. He's not looking at the battle
[50:19] he's going through. He's not looking at
[50:21] the thorns he has in his life, but he's
[50:23] looking more forward. Here we see you
[50:28] know he has faithfully declaring that he
[50:30] has faithfully endured the battles of
[50:33] life.
[50:35] He has completed the mission God gave
[50:38] him. Amen.
[50:40] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that we are here for a
[50:41] purpose?
[50:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are all here for a purpose.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; You know we are not here for a picnic.
[50:49] The prophet said you know
[50:51] &gt;&gt; it's a battleground. That's right. You
[50:53] know we are not on a picnic. You know,
[50:56] we are here for a purpose. Brothers and
[50:59] sisters, here he's declaring that he has
[51:02] faithfully endured the battles of life,
[51:05] completed the mission God gave him, and
[51:08] he says, "I have remained true to the
[51:10] word, true to the gospel."
[51:13] Look at this. In confidence and hope, he
[51:16] looks forward to receiving the eternal
[51:18] reward. You know
[51:20] &gt;&gt; what is that reward? He talks about the
[51:22] crown of righteousness. Amen.
[51:26] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[51:28] &gt;&gt; Who will give that crown? The righteous
[51:30] judge Jesus Christ. You know
[51:33] &gt;&gt; not say look look he's not only talking
[51:36] about him you know he passes. He says
[51:39] not only me but everyone who will
[51:44] see his appearing. You know
[51:46] &gt;&gt; look at his appearing. You know he
[51:48] assures believers that this reward is
[51:51] not just for him but all those who long
[51:53] for the return of Christ.
[51:57] &gt;&gt; Why we have gathered here? Why we are
[52:00] even though it is snowing outside there
[52:02] are many people who are sitting at home
[52:03] but why you have come here? Why you have
[52:06] gathered here?
[52:08] &gt;&gt; Because we want to be in the presence of
[52:11] God.
[52:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I pray my brothers, my sister,
[52:14] it won't be a wonder or it won't be a
[52:16] you know nothing to think or be amazed
[52:19] about. Maybe the coming of the Lord
[52:21] might come as we are here today.
[52:25] &gt;&gt; I pray
[52:27] you know as the word of God says the
[52:30] creation is groaning for his coming.
[52:35] &gt;&gt; We are all looking forward for his
[52:37] coming. Yes.
[52:38] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you my brothers, as
[52:40] far as possible, as long as we are upon
[52:43] this earth, we need to fight this
[52:46] battle.
[52:46] &gt;&gt; We need to finish strong.
[52:50] &gt;&gt; I know
[52:52] maybe the battle is not yet rough. It
[52:55] will get rough.
[52:59] &gt;&gt; More worse time is coming in our lives.
[53:02] &gt;&gt; True.
[53:03] &gt;&gt; And we have to be prepared for that
[53:05] battle.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:08] I'm so sad to, you know, hear about the
[53:11] passing of of brother, you know, Bruce.
[53:13] You know,
[53:14] &gt;&gt; it was really a shock to me. Amen.
[53:19] &gt;&gt; Every time I would come, I would see him
[53:21] leading the songs, you know.
[53:25] &gt;&gt; And sometimes my brothers, my sisters, I
[53:27] feel, you know, my daddy always said
[53:30] when he was, you know, lying down with
[53:33] liver cancer, you know,
[53:36] he gave up. He said, "I want to go."
[53:40] And you know what he said? Is it maybe
[53:42] the Lord this is the avenues this is the
[53:46] channel you know sickness called cancer
[53:49] which is a way for me to go home you
[53:52] know that's true sometimes our
[53:55] sicknesses become aware for us
[54:00] to go onto the other side you know
[54:04] &gt;&gt; but the one who we are yet here we have
[54:08] a great responsibility today
[54:11] &gt;&gt; then we need to stand guard our loins
[54:14] and fight this battle.
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:17] &gt;&gt; In the message the beginning and the
[54:19] ending of the gentile dispensation he
[54:21] says if there is no battles there is no
[54:24] victories.
[54:26] &gt;&gt; Before you can have a victory there has
[54:29] to be a battle.
[54:31] &gt;&gt; If there is no battles there is no
[54:33] victories. So we ought to be thankful
[54:36] for the battles
[54:39] and the trying.
[54:42] It's God giving us the opportunity to
[54:45] have victories in our life.
[54:48] &gt;&gt; If there's no battle,
[54:50] there's no victories in our life.
[54:54] The prophet said God is getting his
[54:56] soldiers ready for the battle.
[54:59] He says the army that's getting ready
[55:01] for a battle first it's got to select
[55:03] some soldiers.
[55:05] They've got to be dressed for fighting.
[55:08] They have got to be trained for
[55:10] fighting. Says I believe that the
[55:12] greatest battle that was ever fought now
[55:15] is now ready to go in action.
[55:18] He says I believe that God has been
[55:20] selecting his soldiers.
[55:23] I believe he's been dressing them,
[55:25] training them, and the battlefront is
[55:27] now set, getting ready to start.
[55:33] Look at the words of Paul here. You
[55:35] know, he's in such a situation, a
[55:39] miserable condition in his life. He's in
[55:42] the dungeon. The prophet said he is in
[55:44] the dungeon.
[55:48] He's not in a position even to see
[55:50] anything.
[55:52] The whole body it's bleeding
[55:57] is in such a circumstances
[56:01] all he can talk about is pain pain how
[56:05] we do
[56:08] but look at his boldness look at his
[56:11] courage he says I have fought a good
[56:13] fight
[56:16] &gt;&gt; God
[56:17] &gt;&gt; I've not only fought a good fight but I
[56:20] have finished my course.
[56:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:22] &gt;&gt; Not only I have finished my course, but
[56:24] I have kept my faith.
[56:30] &gt;&gt; We can't leave one and hold to other. We
[56:33] can't hold one and leave the other.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:38] &gt;&gt; We need to fight.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; We need to press on.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; We need to keep.
[56:46] &gt;&gt; These three things are very important
[56:48] today.
[56:50] He says, "I have fought a good fight."
[56:53] And here Paul is trying to use this
[56:56] image of a soldier or an athlete. You
[56:58] know,
[57:01] the prophet said the Christian life is a
[57:03] spiritual battle.
[57:06] Battle against sin, temptation, false
[57:09] doctrines, persecution,
[57:12] discouragements in our life.
[57:14] But Paul says he didn't give up.
[57:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:18] He remained courageous and obedient
[57:21] fighting for truth and righteousness.
[57:28] &gt;&gt; You know what the prophet said? The
[57:30] greatest battle that was ever fought was
[57:32] in the mind.
[57:35] &gt;&gt; The greatest battle ever fought is in
[57:37] the human mind.
[57:39] You got to stand with the word just like
[57:41] Jesus did.
[57:45] &gt;&gt; What is mind? It's the mutual ground for
[57:48] the battle.
[57:50] And says in this there's a mutual
[57:52] ground. No man's land.
[57:59] For example,
[58:03] if I want to fight
[58:07] with with brother John, you know, I
[58:09] would tell him, you know, come to India,
[58:12] come to Hyderabbad, you know, and fight.
[58:14] let us fight and he will say no come to
[58:17] heartland and we will fight there
[58:21] but there's a mediator here brother Ron
[58:22] says you don't go to India or no you
[58:25] don't go to heartland but you know you
[58:27] you come to
[58:29] this church place and you fight there
[58:32] you know what is that this is the place
[58:34] it's a mutual ground you know
[58:36] &gt;&gt; for the battle and that's the way our
[58:39] mind the prophet said it's a mutual
[58:42] ground Amen.
[58:44] &gt;&gt; It's a no man's land and they fight here
[58:46] at this place, a mutual meeting place.
[58:50] &gt;&gt; He says when this great battle started
[58:53] on the earth, there had to be a mutual
[58:55] meeting place.
[58:57] &gt;&gt; There had to be a place selected for the
[58:59] battle to begin and for the battle to
[59:01] rage and the battlegrounds begins in the
[59:04] human mind.
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; There's where the battle starts.
[59:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The human mind was chosen for the
[59:12] place of the battle where it was to
[59:14] begin. And that is because that
[59:17] decisions are made from the mind.
[59:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:21] &gt;&gt; That's why the devil chose the head of a
[59:23] man and God chose the heart of a person.
[59:28] &gt;&gt; Now you got to meet your enemy where
[59:31] it's in the mind. You got to make your
[59:33] choices where in your mind. You know
[59:38] I was just going through the the
[59:40] messages you know
[59:43] I never knew before you know but when I
[59:46] went through that message from that time
[59:48] there the prophet is talking he was a
[59:50] professional boxer
[59:53] he says when I was a young boy I was
[59:54] fighting in the golden gloves
[59:57] and then from there went into
[59:59] professional fighting and won 15
[1:00:01] straight professional fights
[1:00:04] but he says I came to the Lord.
[1:00:07] &gt;&gt; He says, "When I came to the Lord, I
[1:00:09] finished my carrier of fighting. The
[1:00:12] first night I met the Lord Jesus, that
[1:00:14] settled it, you know." And he says, "I
[1:00:17] have a new opponent."
[1:00:20] He says, "I I'm not fighting with my
[1:00:22] brothers. I have a new opponent, the
[1:00:25] devil. And I know you have to watch him
[1:00:28] because he hits low and fall
[1:00:31] &gt;&gt; and all of his licks are like that. But
[1:00:33] I'm so glad that we have a real referee.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; A real one. That's our Lord Jesus
[1:00:40] Christ.
[1:00:41] &gt;&gt; He's the captain of our salvation.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Brothers, sisters, church of the living
[1:00:48] God. Sometimes in our life, we'll be all
[1:00:51] alone.
[1:00:53] Remember, when others leave you
[1:00:57] alone and run away,
[1:00:59] you can't run away with them. You have
[1:01:01] to stand courageously.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; You have to stand there and fight your
[1:01:06] battle. Be bold, courageous, because
[1:01:09] it's not your battle. It's the battle of
[1:01:13] the Lord.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; The Bible says it's the Lord's battle
[1:01:17] and he will fight for us.
[1:01:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; But we need to stand there.
[1:01:24] We need to be ready. We need to be
[1:01:25] trained. We need to be dressed for the
[1:01:27] battle.
[1:01:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:29] The Bible talks about he has not left us
[1:01:32] without warning. 1 Peter 5:8 said, "Be
[1:01:35] sober, vigilant, because your adversary,
[1:01:38] the devil, as a roaring lion, walketh
[1:01:40] about seeking whom he may devour."
[1:01:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; He has not left us without a warning.
[1:01:49] Neither he has left us without an
[1:01:50] example. You know I was going through
[1:01:53] what example you know the prophet talks
[1:01:56] about the Bible talks about you know he
[1:01:58] talks about Nehemiah you know 4:16 and
[1:02:01] 17 he says and it came to pass from that
[1:02:03] time forth that the half of my servants
[1:02:07] wrought in the world and the other half
[1:02:09] of them held both spears the shields and
[1:02:12] the boughs and the habedians and the
[1:02:14] rulers were beyond all the house of
[1:02:16] Judah. You know they which build it. Now
[1:02:19] look at this. They which build it on the
[1:02:21] wall and they that bear burdens with
[1:02:25] those that laid it. Everyone with one of
[1:02:28] his hands wrought in his world in the
[1:02:30] world and with the other and held a
[1:02:33] weapon.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; What were they doing? They were busy
[1:02:37] building
[1:02:38] &gt;&gt; and busy fighting.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:41] &gt;&gt; That is what we need to do.
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:02:44] &gt;&gt; We need to build.
[1:02:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:02:46] &gt;&gt; We need to fight. We need to work. We
[1:02:48] need to fight. We need to eat. We need
[1:02:50] to fight. We need to sit. We need to
[1:02:52] fight. We need to sleep. We need to
[1:02:54] fight.
[1:02:58] &gt;&gt; We can't escape this battle.
[1:03:02] &gt;&gt; We can't.
[1:03:06] Sometimes, you know, when the when I go
[1:03:07] through stress and trials in my life, I
[1:03:10] say, Lord, why me only?
[1:03:14] &gt;&gt; Sometimes we do that.
[1:03:16] &gt;&gt; Why me?
[1:03:22] But there is a purpose
[1:03:25] that in this battle
[1:03:28] we need to win victory. Amen.
[1:03:31] &gt;&gt; Victory is ours. My brothers, my
[1:03:33] sisters, you know the Bible says the
[1:03:37] enemy comes from all the sides. But
[1:03:40] thank God he lifts our standards. Amen.
[1:03:43] &gt;&gt; When enemy comes like a flood,
[1:03:47] &gt;&gt; the Lord himself will raise lift our
[1:03:50] standards. And we have experienced it
[1:03:52] many times in our life.
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; When the enemy comes,
[1:03:58] I was going through this message. He
[1:03:59] says it will come. The enemy will come
[1:04:02] only during the harvest.
[1:04:07] Talks about the Philistines. He says,
[1:04:08] "When the Philistines came, the people
[1:04:10] in the fields fled away." He talks about
[1:04:13] the only man Shamgar
[1:04:18] who killed 600 Philistine, 600 men with
[1:04:22] just an ox goat.
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; He says when the Philistine came, the
[1:04:27] people in the field fled away. This lets
[1:04:30] us know that the enemy most likely come
[1:04:33] in the time of harvest.
[1:04:35] It was a time when most of the people
[1:04:37] were occupied in business of getting
[1:04:39] their crops in.
[1:04:41] Why the enemy came?
[1:04:44] The enemy came for two reasons. To
[1:04:46] inflict casualties to destroy the crops.
[1:04:52] What did the enemy found? The verse
[1:04:54] tells us that when the enemy came all
[1:04:56] the people fled from before them.
[1:05:01] And the prophet said, "Sounds just like
[1:05:03] some of the church doesn't, doesn't it?"
[1:05:06] He says, "Things will be going along
[1:05:07] just fine. And the devil will stir up
[1:05:09] trouble. He will use someone in the
[1:05:12] church to start a ruckus. When this
[1:05:14] happens, 99% of the people the church
[1:05:17] flee from the scene of the battle. No
[1:05:19] one wants to take a stand.
[1:05:21] &gt;&gt; After all, we don't want to hurt
[1:05:24] anyone's feeling."
[1:05:26] He says, "Now we need to realize that
[1:05:28] this is the reason many churches are
[1:05:30] falling apart. No one has the courage to
[1:05:33] stand up against the enemy."
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; What is that in your hand? He says,
[1:05:40] "Shamar, son of Anath, judge of Israel
[1:05:44] and a farmer." He says, "Shamar."
[1:05:47] He looked around. He thought, "Well, I'm
[1:05:49] not a soldier.
[1:05:51] I can't fight. I don't know nothing
[1:05:54] about fighting." He says, "I ain't got
[1:05:56] time to get out there and learn how to
[1:05:58] dwell so I can fight these fellas."
[1:06:02] But he just got all stirred up
[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; and he looked up laying on the shelf and
[1:06:09] there laid an ax gold.
[1:06:12] They punched the cattle into their
[1:06:14] stalls and maybe when they are plowing
[1:06:17] they ra the dirt of the end of the plow
[1:06:20] and old ox go. You know what did Shamgar
[1:06:23] do? He didn't have time to train to
[1:06:25] fight. When everybody fled, when
[1:06:28] everybody run away, he was all by
[1:06:30] himself. He says he was a farmer. He
[1:06:32] didn't know nothing about fighting, but
[1:06:34] it was time to fight.
[1:06:37] &gt;&gt; If there was ever a time to fight, my
[1:06:40] brothers, my sister, this is the time to
[1:06:43] fight the enemy.
[1:06:45] &gt;&gt; This is the time to finish strong
[1:06:49] &gt;&gt; when the battle against us is raging.
[1:06:55] He took a decision when everybody left
[1:06:58] him. He stood alone.
[1:07:01] He didn't know nothing about fighting.
[1:07:04] But it was time to fight. And he said,
[1:07:06] "One thing I know, I am an Israelite."
[1:07:10] Hallelujah. I'm circumcised.
[1:07:12] I am in the covenant. God Jehovah is
[1:07:15] with me,
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; brother. The prophet said, brother, he
[1:07:18] grabbed that ox go. The only thing he
[1:07:21] could get in his hand was an ox code.
[1:07:23] And out that door he went and he slew
[1:07:26] 600 Philistines.
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; The Philistines were armed.
[1:07:37] Was the power in that ox? No.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Was power in in Shamgar? No. It was the
[1:07:44] power of God. Amen.
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; That's why the psalmist said, "If
[1:07:49] thousand on this side and 10,000 on this
[1:07:51] side, yet will I."
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; We need to stand today.
[1:07:58] &gt;&gt; We need to be bold and be courageous.
[1:08:02] &gt;&gt; God wants us to be victorious, brothers
[1:08:05] and sisters. The prophet said in Elijah
[1:08:07] and Alicia message, he says, "It's high
[1:08:10] time to be on our toes.
[1:08:13] You have to be certainly be on your toes
[1:08:16] when you are fighting this great enemy.
[1:08:19] I'm certainly happy having nothing
[1:08:21] against the arenas and sports when it's
[1:08:23] clean. It's very fine thing. I just
[1:08:26] don't listen to them or nothing because
[1:08:28] it was in my blood. So I just keep away
[1:08:30] from it. He says but I got such a great
[1:08:32] fight now and such an awful enemy and
[1:08:37] this fellow is not my body.
[1:08:41] Is our enemy our buddy?
[1:08:43] &gt;&gt; No. He says, "This fellow is not my
[1:08:46] body. He's my enemy." That's right.
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; The devil. He says, "But I'm so thankful
[1:08:50] that I got so much sitting around."
[1:08:54] Faith. What it takes to defeat this
[1:08:57] enemy? And God will grant you that
[1:09:00] faith.
[1:09:03] And Paul is boldly talking that I fight
[1:09:08] the if I fight the good fight of faith.
[1:09:11] I fought a good fight.
[1:09:15] Why he could do that? Why he could be
[1:09:18] victorious? Why he could, you know, win?
[1:09:22] You know what the prophet said? Paul got
[1:09:24] rid of his ecclesiastical armor.
[1:09:29] Because he got rid of his armor, his
[1:09:33] education,
[1:09:35] he could challenge death and grave.
[1:09:38] Perfect strength by perfect weakness. He
[1:09:41] says when he got the rid when he got rid
[1:09:43] of the armor, you know, he took off the
[1:09:45] ecclesiastical armor. He says he did
[1:09:48] like David did. He said when Saul come
[1:09:50] to the end of the road, he said I have
[1:09:52] fought a good fight. That was the last
[1:09:55] enemy to conquer.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:59] Death is the last enemy to conquer.
[1:10:02] &gt;&gt; He says that was the last enemy to
[1:10:04] conquer. He said I have fought a good
[1:10:06] fight. I have finished my course. I have
[1:10:09] kept the faith. He says henceforth there
[1:10:12] is laid up for me a crown that the Lord
[1:10:14] the righteous judge will give me at that
[1:10:16] day. Not only me but all them who love
[1:10:20] his appearing.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:22] &gt;&gt; He says, "Oh death, oh death said I will
[1:10:25] get you in few minutes."
[1:10:28] The grave said I will mold you out
[1:10:30] yonder. The grave said I will rot you in
[1:10:33] few minutes.
[1:10:36] But look at his boldness. He says oh
[1:10:38] death where is your sting
[1:10:41] &gt;&gt; grave where is your victory?
[1:10:45] &gt;&gt; You know the prophet explains this so
[1:10:46] clearly. He says I know. He says Paul I
[1:10:49] know I'm laying here in this Roman
[1:10:51] dungeon bound in chains. My wrist and my
[1:10:54] hands. I got 39 stripes across my back.
[1:10:58] I'm here with tears scalding my eyes
[1:11:00] until I can see no more. I can see with
[1:11:03] my natural eyes, but I can see a crown
[1:11:06] of righteousness.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; He's not able to see with his natural
[1:11:12] eyes.
[1:11:14] But he says, I can see the crown of
[1:11:16] righteousness laid up yonder. My ankles
[1:11:19] are wore out. I have fell off so much
[1:11:23] from the old molded bread they threw in
[1:11:26] here. The rats run over me, the spiders
[1:11:30] all over my body.
[1:11:33] It's creeping over me till I am weak.
[1:11:35] But he says he just stand in the face of
[1:11:38] the death and say where is your sting
[1:11:41] grave? Where is your victory?
[1:11:44] With chain shaking on his hands.
[1:11:46] Hallelujah. He says that's what we need.
[1:11:50] Grave, where is your victory? Grave
[1:11:52] said, I will rot you, Paul. He said, but
[1:11:55] thanks be to God, I have already got the
[1:11:57] victory through Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; That's why he could boldly say, I have
[1:12:04] fought a good fight, I have finished my
[1:12:07] course.
[1:12:09] Hebrews 12:12 says, you know,
[1:12:12] "Wherefore, seeing also our compassion
[1:12:15] about with so great a cloud of
[1:12:17] witnesses, let us lay aside every weight
[1:12:19] and sin which does so easily beset us,
[1:12:22] and let us run with patience and the
[1:12:25] race that is set before us, looking unto
[1:12:28] Jesus, the author and the finisher of
[1:12:30] our faith, who for the joy that was set
[1:12:33] before him, endured the cross, despising
[1:12:36] the shame, and is sat down at the right
[1:12:38] hand of the throne. throne of God.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:41] &gt;&gt; You know, Paul compares his life to a
[1:12:45] race with a set path marked out by God.
[1:12:49] He didn't stop halfway. He endured it
[1:12:52] till the end. Completing the work God
[1:12:55] assigned to him. And every one of us,
[1:12:58] each believer has their own course to
[1:13:00] run today.
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; This reflects purposeful living. Not
[1:13:06] wandering aimlessly but striving toward
[1:13:09] a goal with endurance and faithfulness.
[1:13:13] &gt;&gt; Yes, this Christian life is a race.
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; It's a personal calling. Every believer
[1:13:19] is called to run a personal Godord race.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; It's not about competing with others but
[1:13:27] fulfilling God's purpose in our life.
[1:13:31] Amen.
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; Do you believe, brothers and sisters,
[1:13:34] God has a purpose for every man and
[1:13:36] woman
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; born into the kingdom of God?
[1:13:39] &gt;&gt; There is a purpose. There's a race we
[1:13:42] are running. We must never forget it's
[1:13:44] an individual affair.
[1:13:48] God is not interested in a church
[1:13:49] relationship. God is not interested in a
[1:13:52] group in an association. No, he's not
[1:13:55] interested in a group affair.
[1:13:58] He's looking for a personal individual
[1:14:00] affair relationship with God.
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; Today we need to as we march as we fight
[1:14:07] this battle as Paul said we need to lay
[1:14:10] aside every weight and sin.
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; Many Christians they failed to run the
[1:14:16] race because they are burdened by
[1:14:18] unnecessary weights, worries,
[1:14:20] distractions or unrepented sins.
[1:14:24] Brothers and sisters, if you're ever
[1:14:26] going to do anything for God, what we
[1:14:28] need to do, we need to get rid of the
[1:14:30] weights.
[1:14:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:32] &gt;&gt; Everything that hinders us,
[1:14:35] lay it aside. You can't run a race
[1:14:38] loaded down.
[1:14:41] You know what will happen when you have
[1:14:43] everything on? It will slow you down.
[1:14:48] &gt;&gt; That's why Paul said, "Lay it aside."
[1:14:51] unbelief, grudges, pride, worldly
[1:14:53] attachments. You know,
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; it's time to unpack, you know.
[1:14:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:58] &gt;&gt; It's time to endure with patience. We
[1:15:00] must run it with patience
[1:15:03] through trials, persecution, and
[1:15:05] suffering, looking forward to the crown
[1:15:08] of life.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; The Christian race is a lifelong
[1:15:13] commitment.
[1:15:15] That's why the Bible said, "Patience is
[1:15:17] virtue."
[1:15:19] You got to stand the test. Endure it to
[1:15:21] the end. For the crown is waiting for
[1:15:23] us.
[1:15:25] &gt;&gt; I want to encourage my brothers and my
[1:15:28] sisters. Don't quit in trials.
[1:15:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:31] &gt;&gt; Why? Because during this trial, God is
[1:15:34] building our character.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Our victory lies in keeping our eyes on
[1:15:39] Jesus.
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; The author and the finisher of our
[1:15:43] faith. You know, the only way to run
[1:15:46] this race successfully is keeping your
[1:15:50] my eyes on Jesus.
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; Not on the world, not on the failures of
[1:15:54] others, but on him who never fails.
[1:15:59] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus Christ himself. He ran his
[1:16:01] race, endured the cross, and sat down at
[1:16:05] the right hand of God. So will we if we
[1:16:08] stay faithful to God.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Pressing toward the mark. He says we are
[1:16:13] pressing toward the mark of the high
[1:16:15] calling. There's a crown waiting for us
[1:16:18] those who finish. He said don't stop.
[1:16:21] Don't be discouraged. Just finish your
[1:16:24] race.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, you're not running
[1:16:27] in vain.
[1:16:30] As you run this race, the heaven is
[1:16:32] watching over you.
[1:16:35] &gt;&gt; The saints are cheering over you. We
[1:16:38] need to run our race faithfully and keep
[1:16:40] our eyes on Jesus
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; because our reward is sure.
[1:16:45] Christ finished his course.
[1:16:47] Then despite the same but boring and was
[1:16:50] nailed at Calvary as substitute for us
[1:16:52] dying in capital punishment born in a
[1:16:55] stable went out in the capital
[1:16:57] punishment
[1:17:00] when their eyes were open. And he says,
[1:17:01] "If I'm telling you the work is already
[1:17:03] finished, which the Bible declares that
[1:17:05] is finished, then what could I do for
[1:17:08] it? It is already finished.
[1:17:11] It rest within your personal faith in
[1:17:14] the finished work of Jesus Christ at
[1:17:16] Calvary. And by faith, we draw dividends
[1:17:20] of our exter eternal salvation. This is
[1:17:23] the earnest of our salvation."
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:28] Today we need to stand like Paul and say
[1:17:31] I have fought a good fight. I have
[1:17:34] finished my course and I have kept my
[1:17:36] faith
[1:17:38] despite trials, prison beatings,
[1:17:41] betrayal and rejection. Paul never
[1:17:43] abandoned the gospel.
[1:17:46] He never abandoned this truth. He
[1:17:50] guarded it. He preached it and he lived
[1:17:53] it. Amen.
[1:17:54] &gt;&gt; We as ministers, we need to guard it.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; We need to preach it and we need to live
[1:17:59] it.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; That's what you have to do. You need to
[1:18:02] guard this word, this truth.
[1:18:07] You have to preach it. How? By the life
[1:18:09] you live.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; We are the written epistles of God read
[1:18:13] by all men.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; Paul remained loyal to Christ even it
[1:18:20] costed him everything.
[1:18:22] at the end of his life is not boasting
[1:18:24] about his achievements. He's not
[1:18:26] boasting about his miracles of fame. But
[1:18:28] he says, "I have kept the faith."
[1:18:32] In the time of apostasy, compromise and
[1:18:35] persecution, keeping the faith is not
[1:18:38] easy, but it is essential.
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; We are living in such a time that
[1:18:43] keeping the faith is not easy, but it is
[1:18:47] essential.
[1:18:49] &gt;&gt; We need to keep the faith.
[1:18:51] We need to run the race. We need to
[1:18:54] press on. We need to fight the battle.
[1:18:59] &gt;&gt; It isn't how you start.
[1:19:02] It's how you finish.
[1:19:04] &gt;&gt; Just keep the faith. Stay with the word.
[1:19:08] What does it mean? You may say, "Brother
[1:19:10] Bo, what does it mean to keep the
[1:19:11] faith?"
[1:19:14] It's nothing but remain
[1:19:17] true to the gospel.
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. True to the word, true to the
[1:19:22] message which God has given to us in
[1:19:24] this age, not mixing it with man's
[1:19:26] tradition. We need to hold to the
[1:19:28] original word with no compromise.
[1:19:33] What is keeping the faith is holding to
[1:19:35] the pure unadulterated word of God no
[1:19:38] matter how unpopular it is.
[1:19:42] As I said before, a Christian journey is
[1:19:45] not a pikney. We are in a battle.
[1:19:48] Deceived church by the deceived world.
[1:19:50] He says we are not on a picnic. We are
[1:19:52] in a battlefield. Don't ever get that in
[1:19:54] your head. For I become a Christian to
[1:19:57] fight. Amen. Fight the good fight of
[1:19:59] faith. I become a Christian to get in
[1:20:01] the battle lines. We are Christian
[1:20:04] soldiers against the flesh, against the
[1:20:06] devil, against the false doctrines.
[1:20:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:10] To keep that faith,
[1:20:12] we must fight to hold on to truth. In
[1:20:15] the world of deception,
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; we'll have to fight every inch of the
[1:20:19] way. You know, brothers and sisters, the
[1:20:21] road to glory is full of battles,
[1:20:25] but in every step there is his grace.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; The road to battle is full of battles.
[1:20:33] Full road to glory is full of battles.
[1:20:36] But in every step there is the grace of
[1:20:38] God.
[1:20:42] That's why he said, "I have fought a
[1:20:44] good fight of faith.
[1:20:47] I have finished my course. I have kept
[1:20:50] my faith."
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Not only that, he says, "Henceforth,
[1:20:54] there is laid up for me a crown of
[1:20:56] righteousness."
[1:20:58] Revelation 3:101 said, "Because thou has
[1:21:01] kept the word of my patience, I also
[1:21:03] will keep thee from the hour of
[1:21:05] temptation,
[1:21:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. which shall come upon all the
[1:21:08] world to try them that dwell upon the
[1:21:10] earth.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; He says, "Behold, I come quickly. Hold
[1:21:14] that fast which thou has that no man
[1:21:18] take thy crown."
[1:21:23] What crown? The crown of righteousness.
[1:21:27] That's what Paul is talking about. I
[1:21:29] have fought a good fight. I have
[1:21:32] finished my course. I have kept my
[1:21:34] faith. I'm waiting for that crown of
[1:21:37] righteousness which the righteous judge
[1:21:39] is going to give me. Paul is looking at
[1:21:42] that reward, a crown given not by man
[1:21:45] but by Jesus Christ himself.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; He says apostle Paul was not speaking
[1:21:50] from a place of regret but of victory.
[1:21:54] He was not looking at the gallows of
[1:21:56] death but at the gate of glory. Paul's
[1:21:59] eyes were fixed beyond this life where
[1:22:01] the crown of righteousness awaited him.
[1:22:05] What a day that would be brother John.
[1:22:07] Then we meet him over yonder
[1:22:10] and he would open arms open wide and he
[1:22:13] would say well done my faithful son my
[1:22:16] daughter.
[1:22:19] The prophet of God said very soon we
[1:22:22] will meet him at a destination
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; and that will be through the valley of
[1:22:27] the shadow of death. He said either we
[1:22:30] will meet him as a masterpiece which he
[1:22:32] has worked upon us or we will meet him
[1:22:35] as a driftwood drifting floating on the
[1:22:37] water doesn't know its destination.
[1:22:42] The same way true every true believer is
[1:22:45] in the race not for a fading earthly
[1:22:48] crown but for an eternal reward that the
[1:22:52] righteous judge Jesus Christ will place
[1:22:54] upon our head.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. But you know one thing before he
[1:22:58] gives you the crown of righteousness he
[1:23:01] will give you the crown of thorns.
[1:23:04] We have to be ready for that. We happy
[1:23:08] you know when we receive something good
[1:23:09] from God you know we are so happy today
[1:23:12] we talk about oh I'm going to get the
[1:23:14] crown of righteousness you know but
[1:23:16] remember
[1:23:19] the road to glory is full of battles
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; right
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; before he gives us that crown of
[1:23:25] righteousness he will give us a crown of
[1:23:27] thorn
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; it's a battle every day for a Christian
[1:23:34] but remember you are not fighting for
[1:23:36] victory victory. You are fighting in
[1:23:39] victory.
[1:23:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:42] &gt;&gt; Isn't it wonderful?
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:44] &gt;&gt; You are not fighting for victory. You
[1:23:46] are already one.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; You are fighting in victory. That's what
[1:23:52] Paul is talking about. I can't see
[1:23:54] anything. I'm bound in chains. But he's
[1:23:58] looking beyond as a victorious, as an
[1:24:01] overcomer.
[1:24:03] He swore by himself. It's time to walk
[1:24:06] unconsciously.
[1:24:08] He says you're here to fulfill it. Just
[1:24:10] walk unconscious of fear. Walk
[1:24:12] unconscious of criticism. Walk
[1:24:14] unconscious into the world. Walk as you
[1:24:16] walk in Christ. Walk with him. Not
[1:24:18] paying attention to left or to li right.
[1:24:22] Just keep moving on.
[1:24:24] He says if something comes up in the
[1:24:26] church, walk with God.
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; If sickness strikes you, walk with God.
[1:24:33] If the neighbor don't like you, walk
[1:24:35] with God. Just keep on walking with God.
[1:24:39] &gt;&gt; What we need to do, brothers and
[1:24:41] sisters, we need to endure
[1:24:44] this battle, this race with patience in
[1:24:48] our life.
[1:24:50] There are people who are running this
[1:24:52] race for the crown that is perishable,
[1:24:55] but we do it for the crown that is
[1:24:57] imperishable.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:00] First Corinthians 9:25 says, "Every man
[1:25:02] that striveth for the mastery is
[1:25:04] temperate in all things." Now they do it
[1:25:07] to obtain a corruptible crown, but we
[1:25:10] and incorruptible.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; Why? Sufferings will come.
[1:25:17] Sufferings will come to make us perfect.
[1:25:20] Revelation 2:10 says, "Fear none of
[1:25:23] those things which thou shalt suffer.
[1:25:25] Behold, the devil shall cast some of you
[1:25:27] into prison, that he may be tried, and
[1:25:29] he shall have tribulation 10 days, be
[1:25:32] thou faithful unto death, and I will
[1:25:34] give thee a crown of life.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; During these sufferings, brothers and
[1:25:40] sisters, during the trials we go
[1:25:42] through, during the sickness we go
[1:25:43] through,
[1:25:45] the prophet said, "Great characters
[1:25:49] are made in this time."
[1:25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; They are not made of luxuries.
[1:25:54] They are made by suffering because the
[1:25:57] prophet said character is victory and
[1:25:59] fit to rule.
[1:26:02] What we need is we need to be overcomers
[1:26:05] today.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:07] &gt;&gt; We need to be victorious.
[1:26:09] We need to finish strong.
[1:26:12] And the battle is raging over us.
[1:26:16] It's not going to be easy.
[1:26:19] I've come here to just encourage you and
[1:26:21] comfort you that what we need to do is
[1:26:24] be strong.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; We need to be strong so that we will
[1:26:28] finish it strong.
[1:26:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:32] &gt;&gt; Because the battle is going to be rough.
[1:26:35] It's going to be fierce.
[1:26:38] The storms will come. It will rage over
[1:26:40] us.
[1:26:42] But thank God, we need to hold on to his
[1:26:45] unchanging hands.
[1:26:47] We need to stand on that rock. The rock
[1:26:50] called Christ.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; Look at the sufferings of Paul.
[1:26:55] Five times 39 stripes. Three times
[1:26:58] beaten with rod. One time stone. Three
[1:27:01] times suffered shipwreck.
[1:27:03] So many pains, troubles he had to go. A
[1:27:07] night and a day been in the deep.
[1:27:08] journeys often. Perils of water, perils
[1:27:11] of robbers, perils by my own countrymen,
[1:27:14] perils by the heathen, in the perils of
[1:27:16] the city, in the perils and wilderness,
[1:27:18] in the sea, among false brethren. He
[1:27:21] says, in weariness and painfulness, in
[1:27:23] watching often, in hunger and thirst, in
[1:27:26] fastings, in cold and nakedness, beside
[1:27:29] those things that are without, that
[1:27:31] which come upon me daily, cometh upon me
[1:27:34] daily, the care of all the churches.
[1:27:37] But look at him. He says, "Who is weak?
[1:27:39] I am not weak." Who is offended and I
[1:27:43] burn not.
[1:27:45] &gt;&gt; Today we have to be like Paul.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Have we ever suffered like Paul
[1:27:51] suffered?
[1:27:53] &gt;&gt; But how many complaints we have made?
[1:27:54] You know,
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; I always tell my young children at the
[1:27:58] orphanage, he says, "The more you
[1:28:00] complain,
[1:28:02] &gt;&gt; the devil gets the glory."
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. He will pat on you. He'll pat at
[1:28:07] the back of you say complain my son.
[1:28:09] Complain my daughter.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; True.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Because God is not getting glory.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; He is getting glory.
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; So he wants us to complain. He wants us
[1:28:18] to murmur. He wants us to stop. He wants
[1:28:21] us to paralyze.
[1:28:26] But no,
[1:28:28] we can't stop. We have to fight.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; We have to fight this battle. We need to
[1:28:35] endure it with patience.
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; Revelation 22:12-4, he says, "Behold, I
[1:28:41] come quickly. My reward is with me to
[1:28:44] give every man according as his work
[1:28:46] shall be." He says, "I am the alpha and
[1:28:48] the omega, the beginning and the end and
[1:28:50] the first and the last." He said,
[1:28:51] "Blessed are they that do his
[1:28:53] commandments that they may have right to
[1:28:56] the tree of life and may enter in the in
[1:28:59] through the gates into the city."
[1:29:03] Smint and church age. He says the crown
[1:29:05] of righteousness is for those who stayed
[1:29:08] with the word
[1:29:11] no matter what the world said about
[1:29:12] them. Truth will always bring
[1:29:14] persecution but it also brings a crown.
[1:29:18] Amen.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; Truth will bring persecution but
[1:29:22] remember on the other hand it will bring
[1:29:24] crown to us.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:26] Which crown the righteous judge Jesus
[1:29:30] Christ is going to give us.
[1:29:33] Brothers and sisters, Paul at his end of
[1:29:36] his earthly journey. He was not speaking
[1:29:39] in fear or regret or uncertainty. He was
[1:29:43] speaking with confidence.
[1:29:46] He was looking beyond the sword of Nero,
[1:29:49] beyond the dungeon, beyond the trials
[1:29:51] and persecution. and he saw a crown laid
[1:29:54] up for him by the righteous judge.
[1:29:57] Beloved, this is not just Paul's
[1:29:59] testimony. It's a promise for all those
[1:30:02] who love his appearing.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:05] &gt;&gt; Paul had this assurance. His faith had
[1:30:08] secured him a crown.
[1:30:11] Paul's confidence was not in his works
[1:30:13] but in the finished work of Christ.
[1:30:17] He remained faithful and the
[1:30:19] faithfulness is always rewarded.
[1:30:23] The crown is not just for Paul as he
[1:30:25] mentions. It is for every faithful
[1:30:28] believer today.
[1:30:30] &gt;&gt; Paul's testimony can be our testimony.
[1:30:33] If you fight the good fight, finish the
[1:30:36] race and keep the faith, there is a
[1:30:38] crown waiting for us.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Not a crown of corruption, but a crown
[1:30:42] of eternal righteousness.
[1:30:46] As I close, I want to end up with these
[1:30:49] words. Let us live in such a way that we
[1:30:53] love his appearing.
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; Let us keep our eyes on the crown and
[1:30:57] not be weary in welloing.
[1:31:00] Amen.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Church of the living God, the world may
[1:31:03] offer pleasures for a season, but Christ
[1:31:07] offers a crown for eternity. Amen.
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; What we need to do, we need to surrender
[1:31:13] fully to Christ today
[1:31:15] and one day
[1:31:18] &gt;&gt; we will finish it strong.
[1:31:22] &gt;&gt; We'll endure it till the end.
[1:31:25] You know where our eyes should be on the
[1:31:27] finishing line.
[1:31:29] &gt;&gt; Not to the right, not to the left,
[1:31:32] not to the past which we have left
[1:31:35] behind.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:36] &gt;&gt; But let us move forward.
[1:31:39] move on.
[1:31:41] The devil wants us to stop. But
[1:31:43] remember, we as the bride of Jesus
[1:31:46] Christ, we as believers, we need to move
[1:31:48] forward.
[1:31:50] What we need to do, let us surrender
[1:31:52] fully to Christ today.
[1:31:55] And one day soon, we too shall receive
[1:31:57] that unfading crown.
[1:32:00] It's an invitation to all Christians to
[1:32:02] live with a purpose, purity, and
[1:32:05] perseverance.
[1:32:07] What we need today is a purpose in our
[1:32:09] life, purity in our life and a
[1:32:12] perseverance.
[1:32:15] We need to be determined today that no
[1:32:17] matter how many battles will come in our
[1:32:19] life, we will finish it stronger.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. we will move forward
[1:32:28] because at the end of the day we are
[1:32:30] waiting for that crown
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; the crown of righteousness
[1:32:35] which our Lord Jesus Christ is going to
[1:32:37] give to us.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; My prayer today is let us run with
[1:32:42] patience.
[1:32:44] &gt;&gt; Let us be like Paul who can boldly say I
[1:32:48] have fought a good fight.
[1:32:50] &gt;&gt; I have finished my course and I have
[1:32:52] kept my faith.
[1:32:54] These three things are very important.
[1:32:57] Then only we can meet him there.
[1:33:00] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's not enough. It's not
[1:33:03] easy for us to meet our Lord Jesus
[1:33:06] Christ. How many of you want to meet him
[1:33:08] there? Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; We want to meet him.
[1:33:13] I want to see you all in heaven.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; That's my desire.
[1:33:19] If you don't want to see me, that's
[1:33:21] okay.
[1:33:23] But I want to see you all in heaven.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:28] &gt;&gt; Why all these things? Why service after
[1:33:31] service, church after service? Why we
[1:33:33] are getting together? Just because we
[1:33:36] can be ready for that rapture.
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; As Revelation speaks about, the bride
[1:33:42] has made herself ready.
[1:33:45] And I pray that this bride, this little
[1:33:48] flock will be ready for the coming of
[1:33:51] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Let us run with patience. Let us fight
[1:33:57] this battle.
[1:33:59] Let us finish strong. No matter how much
[1:34:03] the battle rages over us or how much
[1:34:06] rough it becomes, by the help of the
[1:34:08] Lord, let us move forward and let us run
[1:34:12] this race.
[1:34:14] I thank you for this time and thank you
[1:34:16] for your patience.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Just a small encouragement this morning.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; that we all have to endure it with
[1:34:25] patience and finish it. Why? Because
[1:34:28] only assurance which Christ has given to
[1:34:30] us on Calvary. He said it is finished.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; With that word we will move forward. Go
[1:34:36] forward. Remember us in your prayers and
[1:34:40] I promise you I pray for you all every
[1:34:43] day
[1:34:44] &gt;&gt; and I will be praying for you continuing
[1:34:46] to pray.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; If we don't meet here we'll meet over
[1:34:50] there.
[1:34:51] &gt;&gt; Let us pray for one another and let us
[1:34:53] love one another. Thank you very much
[1:34:55] for your love, your prayers and for your
[1:34:58] kindness and for your support from time
[1:35:01] to time. Thank you brother John for all
[1:35:03] your love. God bless you all.
[1:35:17] And I believe we heard that God wants us
[1:35:19] to be fighting
[1:35:22] &gt;&gt; as clear as anything. There's a great
[1:35:24] falling away and God is saying to us
[1:35:27] fight.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; That means he knows that we're facing
[1:35:36] decisions in our mind to keep
[1:35:41] the foot off the gas a little bit or to
[1:35:45] just coast
[1:35:47] and
[1:35:50] you haven't felt that it it's probably
[1:35:52] coming.
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; But we we know God has spoken to us
[1:35:57] today. Keep pressing. Keep pressing.
[1:35:59] It's a good word for for us today. Let's
[1:36:03] let's sing together and sing that little
[1:36:05] What a day that'll be.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; What a day that'll be.
[1:36:15] That's what we're looking forward to.

[1:39:49] but by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[1:39:54] It's not by might.
[1:39:57] It's not my power,

[1:40:21] by my spirit, saith the Lord.
[1:40:29] Amen. He promised never to leave us,
[1:40:32] never to forsake us.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; I I believe that God orchestrated this
[1:40:38] service today.
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:41] Amen.
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Not by chance.
[1:40:45] &gt;&gt; He knew what we needed. Let's say when
[1:40:47] the battle is over,
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; we shall wear a crown.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; How many is a soldier?
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Am I a soldier of the cross?
[1:41:04] Am I a soldier of the cross, a follower
[1:41:12] of the lamb?
[1:41:16] And shall I fear to own his cross or
[1:41:21] blush to speak his name?
[1:41:26] And when the battle's over, we shall
[1:41:30] wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a
[1:41:34] crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And

[1:42:10] must fly be carried to the skies on
[1:42:16] flowery beds of these
[1:42:21] while others fought to win a prize and
[1:42:26] sailed through bloody seas.
[1:42:31] And when the battle's over, we shall
[1:42:35] wear a crown. Yes, we shall wear a
[1:42:38] crown. Yes, we shall wear a crown. And
