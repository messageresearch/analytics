[35:32] Bibles today while you're standing with
[35:34] us we want to look in the Book of John
[35:36] Saint John the first chapter
[35:45] in the book of Saint John the first
[35:47] chapter
[35:48] we want to look there in the 10th verse
[35:51] of John 1. I know it's a very very
[35:54] familiar reading this morning and just
[35:56] before we read the word can we just
[35:57] borrow hearts together and let's just
[36:00] ask him to come how many say Lord speak
[36:01] to me this morning
[36:03] amen Heavenly Father
[36:04] Lord as your Believers gather here on
[36:06] this Resurrection Sunday
[36:08] or as we're entering in a season of
[36:10] Easter Time Lord where people will
[36:13] become religious for a few days out of
[36:15] the year
[36:16] or they'll begin to try Lord some way to
[36:19] honor your Resurrection but Lord as
[36:21] Believers gathered here today we've not
[36:23] come Lord to honor a Creed or a
[36:26] tradition or Lord to be religious but
[36:29] father we have come here because there
[36:30] is a deep calling to the Deep
[36:33] and Lord your Prophet has told us that
[36:34] Lord if there's a deep calling to the
[36:36] Deep then there has to be a deep to
[36:38] respond
[36:39] Lord before there was a fan on the
[36:41] fish's back there was a water for that
[36:43] fish to swim in Father before there was
[36:46] a tree upon the Earth there was an Earth
[36:48] for that tree to grow out of Lord
[36:50] because before there is a creation there
[36:53] is a Creator and Lord before we your

[37:57] the Believers says
[37:58] a man and amen The Book of John the
[38:01] first chapter in the 10th verse John
[38:04] here writing says he was in the world
[38:07] and the world was made by him and the
[38:10] world knew him not
[38:12] he came unto his own and his own
[38:15] received him not
[38:17] isn't that a sad verse he came into his
[38:20] own in his own received him not but as
[38:23] many as received him to them gave he
[38:27] power to become the sons of God even to
[38:30] them that believe on his name amen which
[38:34] were born not now notice this were not
[38:36] born of the blood nor of the will of the
[38:38] flesh nor of the will of man but of God
[38:42] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[38:45] among us and we beheld his glory the
[38:48] glory as of the only begotten of the
[38:51] father full of grace and truth amen we
[38:55] asked Lord this morning to add the
[38:57] blessing to the reading of his word as
[38:58] you can have your seats here this
[39:00] morning I want to by the help of the
[39:02] Lord I want to speak to you for a few
[39:04] moments on a thought I want to title it
[39:06] a heart to receive the Living God a
[39:10] heart to receive the Living God I was
[39:13] just reading the other day and the
[39:15] prophet of God says here and where is he
[39:17] King of the Jews he says now and I
[39:19] declare to you that the same Jesus who
[39:22] was born 1900 years ago lives today
[39:25] through the resurrection and is the same
[39:28] yesterday today and forever amen we then
[39:32] have just identified amen that God is
[39:36] the Lord Jesus Christ and he lives today
[39:38] through the resurrection amen so we can
[39:41] say it like this the Living God still
[39:44] lives right the Living God still lives I
[39:47] love how the prophet of God says it here
[39:49] again uh kadish bernia 56 he said how
[39:52] beautiful it is to find that the true
[39:55] and living God still lives today in the
[39:58] midst of all the chaos still God lives
[40:01] and Reigns amen God called man 58 he's
[40:04] in a prayer he says God May many of them
[40:07] be standing present now that will give
[40:09] all they got to the Lord Jesus and sell
[40:12] out to the world and go on to pass Guild
[40:15] the place of confession and Christian
[40:16] Beginnings go on to pass the school of
[40:19] the prophets that sit back there with
[40:20] their theology may they go on to Jordan
[40:23] to an open Vision where they can cross
[40:25] and find that the Living God still lives
[40:29] amen how many will agree with me that
[40:31] the Living God still lives in the midst
[40:34] of all the chaos in the midst of all the
[40:36] confusion in the midst of all the
[40:37] division and all the problems and
[40:39] situations in the world Amen the Living
[40:42] God still lives now I believe with all
[40:44] of my heart that there is no a living
[40:47] God except the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[40:50] and I believe that he is the same
[40:51] yesterday today and forever amen I
[40:54] believe he is the same lamb I believe
[40:56] he's the same healer I believe he's the
[40:59] same a savior delivered I love what the
[41:01] prophet said he said he's just as much
[41:03] the lamb today as he was then amen he's
[41:07] just as much here as he was there amen
[41:10] for he is the word and his word is the
[41:13] same amen then we're ever two or three
[41:15] are gathered in my name there am I in
[41:18] the midst of them that's exactly what he
[41:20] said amen he never changes he's God the
[41:24] word amen he's God the word then as
[41:26] Believers amen we are being born of the
[41:29] word now John said we're not being born
[41:31] of the blood or of the will or of the
[41:34] Flesh of man amen but we are born of the
[41:36] will of God now I love what first John 5
[41:39] 4 says just land a foundation it says
[41:41] whatsoever is born of God Amen overcome
[41:45] coming for world and this is the victory
[41:47] that overcometh the world even our faith
[41:51] amen who is he that overcometh the world
[41:53] but he that believeth Jesus is the son
[41:56] of God who is he that overcomes the
[41:58] world it's him who believes that Jesus
[42:01] is the son of God Amen and who is Jesus
[42:04] he is the word amen and what is the word
[42:07] it's the Living Word so whoever believes
[42:09] that Jesus is the son of God will
[42:12] overcome the world now amen we realize
[42:15] them that the word has become flesh
[42:17] right in the beginning was the word and
[42:19] the Word was with God and the Word was
[42:21] God Amen and the Word was made flesh and
[42:24] dwelt Among Us so the word amen takes
[42:26] flesh see there you are remember said
[42:29] God is going to have a church amen and
[42:31] that church is going to be born of the
[42:34] word of God Amen because it's the Living
[42:37] Word of God Amen then the church is not
[42:40] going to be a dead church amen it's not
[42:43] going to be a cold church it's not going
[42:44] to be a lifeless church amen but it's
[42:47] going to be a living church because it's
[42:49] been born amen of the Living God to
[42:51] thank today amen that we are living in a
[42:54] Dying World how many can agree with me
[42:56] we're living Amen in a Dying World
[42:58] Reverend said we're living in a Dying
[43:00] World amongst dying people but with a
[43:03] message of life amen we're living in a
[43:06] Dying World amongst dying people with a
[43:09] message of life and with an Evidence of
[43:11] the Resurrection amen now now when you
[43:13] start taking start taking about or
[43:15] talking rather about the resurrection
[43:17] you realize that before there could be a
[43:19] resurrection amen there had to be a
[43:21] death right Amen in order to have a
[43:24] death amen or a resurrection there had
[43:26] to be a death and we know that that the
[43:28] Lord Jesus amen was born of the Virgin
[43:31] Mary amen he lived a short 33 and a half
[43:34] year life he he suffered Beyond any
[43:37] human had ever suffered amen he went to
[43:39] a cross and died at death amen that no
[43:42] human has ever died before no no body
[43:45] has ever has ever withstood or had come
[43:48] under the things that he went through
[43:49] amen and then he made a promise before
[43:52] he went to the Cross amen that I will
[43:54] raise again right amen destroy this body
[43:57] but in three days I'll raise it up again
[43:59] amen now listen they had God on record
[44:02] testifying amen that you can destroy
[44:05] this body but I'll raise it again amen
[44:07] but when it comes time in the season of
[44:10] Resurrection amen the disciples become
[44:12] bewildered right remember the Bible says
[44:14] in Matthew 25 it said and the angel said
[44:17] unto women fear not ye
[44:19] for I know that you seek Jesus which was
[44:22] crucified he is not here right he is
[44:26] risen see come see the place where the
[44:28] Lord laid and go tell quickly and tell
[44:31] his disciples he is risen from the dead
[44:34] and behold he goeth before you into
[44:36] Galilee and there shall you see him amen
[44:39] lo I have told you and they departed
[44:41] quickly from the Sepulcher with fear and
[44:44] great joy and did run to bring his
[44:46] disciples word now brother remember said
[44:48] go tell who his bewildered disciples
[44:50] they had absolutely trusted amen that he
[44:53] was the Messiah and here he was dead and
[44:56] they didn't know what to do now amen but
[44:59] go tell the bewildered disciples but
[45:01] remember said in today amen the church
[45:03] is just just bewildered today as the
[45:05] disciples were then he said see they
[45:07] they they don't understand the
[45:09] scriptures they cannot understand Mark
[45:11] 16. they cannot understand these things
[45:13] he said see talk about bewildered amen
[45:16] they are more bewildered now amen than
[45:19] they were then because or something like
[45:21] they was they've been the only thing
[45:22] that those disciples had to comfort them
[45:24] was a past experience he said but see we
[45:28] have the message of the Living God that
[45:31] still lives today then we're not being
[45:34] comforted by a past experience of God
[45:36] Amen but we have the Living God in the
[45:39] midst of the Living Church amen by a
[45:42] living message confirming the signs amen
[45:44] and the wonders of his word let me say
[45:46] this we were not brought upon the Earth
[45:48] just to be church members we were not
[45:50] brought up on the earth just to be amen
[45:52] amen people that take up space on the
[45:54] Pew amen but we were brought upon this
[45:57] Earth to overcome the world Amen to
[46:00] overcome the devil come on it's in the
[46:01] Book of Revelation amen they overcome
[46:04] the devil they overcome the mark of the
[46:06] beast they overcome the number amen
[46:08] there's a bride upon the Earth who is
[46:10] not the overcome amen but she is the
[46:13] Overcomer amen by the word of God by the
[46:16] blood of the lamb and by the word of Our
[46:18] Testimony that if we're going to
[46:20] overcome we've got to have something to
[46:22] overcome by I propose to you this
[46:25] morning we overcome amen by the message
[46:28] of the hour we overcome by the message
[46:31] now when you start looking at overcoming
[46:33] it's very powerful to realize that
[46:36] there's a connection between overcoming
[46:38] and life
[46:40] there is a connection between overcoming
[46:43] in life in Revelation 2 7 he said he
[46:46] that hath an ear let him hear what the
[46:48] spirit saith unto the churches to him
[46:50] that overcometh will I give to eat of
[46:52] the tree of life which is in the midst
[46:54] of the paradise of God right there amen
[46:57] overcoming and eating of the Tree of
[46:59] Life in Revelation 2 11 he that hath an
[47:01] ear let him hear what the spirit is
[47:04] saith and to the churches amen he that
[47:06] overcometh shall not be heard of the
[47:09] second death so right there you've got
[47:11] overcoming shall not be heard of the
[47:13] second death now I love this and how can
[47:15] overcome but remember said I was
[47:16] crossing a log the other day and he said
[47:18] as I jumped on this log he said it
[47:20] looked like a real good log he said but
[47:22] on the outside he said it was a big old
[47:24] beach long and when I jumped on it a
[47:26] great chunk fell off he said it was
[47:27] rotten and Dodie he said and that's the
[47:30] way Christians are becoming see amen
[47:32] they've been dead in sin and trespasses
[47:34] so long till they become Doty they can't
[47:36] hold no weight they don't know what
[47:38] overcoming means he said here's what
[47:40] overcoming means overcome means keep
[47:43] life in you amen if you're going to
[47:46] overcome you've got to keep life in you
[47:49] he said when life went out that's what
[47:51] brought that log to that condition and
[47:53] it made it worse than it ever was when
[47:55] it laid in the branch where the water
[47:57] was and he said you take a Christian
[47:59] that's supposed to be a Christian and
[48:01] let the life of God go from him and the
[48:03] experience and the joy of serving Christ
[48:05] and the living in a church amen where
[48:08] such is going on he will rotten twice as
[48:10] quick right living right under so if we
[48:13] are trying to follow the message of the
[48:15] hour or at least this part of the
[48:17] message we should live constantly in the
[48:19] Life of Christ amen if we're going to
[48:22] overcome we've got to live constantly in
[48:25] the Life of Christ because if you don't
[48:27] you lay around and you know these things
[48:29] and you're supposed to do them and you
[48:31] don't do it amen the Bible said he that
[48:33] knoweth to do good and do if it not to
[48:35] him it's sin then you become Dodie and
[48:37] rotten when you're separated from the
[48:40] life of God God when a man is separated
[48:42] from the life of God he becomes rotten
[48:45] he becomes Dodie amen he says so strive
[48:48] with all that's in you Amen to stay in
[48:50] life amen The Life of Christ and then
[48:53] you'll be fruit Barren listen friends
[48:55] amen it's not easy to keep life in you
[48:57] it's not easy to keep life in the church
[49:00] it's not easy but if you're going to
[49:02] overcome amen you've got to strive amen
[49:05] and as you strive amen life is coming in
[49:07] and the only way you overcome death is
[49:10] my life the only way you overcome the
[49:12] world Amen is by the word of almighty
[49:15] god listen friends we're not here Amen
[49:17] to back up to the devil and lay down and
[49:20] let the devil take the life out of the
[49:21] church and take the joy out of the
[49:23] church and take the victory out of the
[49:25] church amen but I think it's a Cause
[49:27] worth fighting for I think it's a cause
[49:29] withdrawing your sword amen and doing
[49:31] whatever you got to do to keep life in
[49:34] the church
[49:35] now there's many gods but I say it like
[49:38] this again there's only one true and
[49:39] living God now amen I love what Jeremiah
[49:42] 10 10 says it says the Lord is the true
[49:44] God Amen he is the Living God an
[49:47] everlasting King and his wrath the Earth
[49:49] shall tremble and the nation shall not
[49:52] be able to abide his indignation in
[49:54] first Thessalonians 1 9 Paul says they
[49:56] themselves show us what manner of
[49:58] entering in we had unto you and how you
[50:01] turn to God from Idols to serve Amen to
[50:04] living and true God Amen remember should
[50:06] we are in His image we are living images
[50:08] of a living God that if we are living
[50:11] images of a living God Amen then we are
[50:14] dead to ourself and we are raised with
[50:16] him if we are living images of the
[50:19] Living God we are dead to ourself
[50:22] and we are raised to him his word is
[50:26] made flesh again in us he said what is
[50:29] the word or what is it not the mythical
[50:32] imaginary God sitting there amen but the
[50:35] Living God now what is the Living God
[50:36] Amen the Living God is the word in you
[50:40] making itself real now that's about
[50:43] that's a powerful quote right there the
[50:45] Living God is the word in you making
[50:48] itself real see oh my a living God made
[50:52] manifest in a living Temple amen and the
[50:55] word of God which is God is made flesh
[50:58] in you amen then the word is the Living
[51:01] God Amen the word is the Living Truth
[51:04] amen but that word has got to come into
[51:06] a living Temple and by coming into a
[51:09] living Temple that word will take
[51:10] preeminence in that Temple amen listen
[51:12] friends amen and when that word comes in
[51:15] it will equip you it will anoint you
[51:17] Amen to be more than a church member but
[51:20] to be a conqueror amen over all things
[51:22] you you will become triumph over all
[51:25] things amen by the things that are in
[51:27] Christ Jesus now amen we now have
[51:29] identified the Living God is the Lord
[51:31] Jesus Christ he is the Living Word he is
[51:34] the he is the Living Image now amen now
[51:37] we're going to turn a corner and say you
[51:39] are the living Temple that the Living
[51:40] God is coming into Paul says what know
[51:43] ye not that your body is the Temple of
[51:46] the Holy Ghost amen which is in you see
[51:49] which we have of God ye are not your own
[51:52] remember said so happy to know that
[51:54] we're living at the end days when we see
[51:56] these signs coming again like it was at
[51:58] that day of his approach and we humble
[52:01] our hearts in thy presence I I was
[52:04] hearing our brother's song service here
[52:05] amen it was almost preaching my sermon
[52:07] we humble our hearts and his presence
[52:09] amen old great Noble one let thy Spirit
[52:13] reign supremely in our heart in our
[52:16] lives and strengthen us amen From the
[52:19] Inside Out amen let the let the presence
[52:21] of the noble one the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:24] the Living God the Living Word come into
[52:26] a living Temple amen and release a
[52:29] strength that will strengthen us amen
[52:31] From the Inside Out amen every Divine
[52:33] promise of God in the Bible will produce
[52:35] it amen if it's met in the right kind of
[52:38] heart it will produce the promise now
[52:40] when you start looking at Hearts
[52:42] everybody hears got a heart right I know
[52:44] that probably be a crazy question to ask
[52:46] if you've got a heart amen but everybody
[52:48] here this morning has got a heart right
[52:50] amen now you realize that our heart amen
[52:53] can actually be found in the Book of
[52:55] Luke the second chapter and the seventh
[52:57] verse the Bible said that she wrote
[52:59] further Mary speaking of Mary she
[53:01] brought first forth her firstborn son
[53:03] and she wrapped him in swaddling clothes
[53:05] and she laid him in a Manger now if you
[53:09] begin to study that you will find amen
[53:11] that the manger is actually a type of
[53:14] the human heart amen that that Mary
[53:17] would bring forth her firstborn son and
[53:19] she would lay him in a Manger which a
[53:21] Manger was a stall amen or it was a crib
[53:24] remember said he is God and God is a
[53:27] spirit and he changed his cast so it
[53:29] ought to be striking to people to think
[53:30] amen that little Jehovah amen could have
[53:33] come a full grown man
[53:36] little Jehovah he could have come a
[53:38] full-grown man amen but he come into a
[53:41] Manger over a manure power little
[53:44] Jehovah crying like a baby playing like
[53:46] a boy Jehovah like a carpenter like a
[53:49] Workman Amen in the teenage hanging
[53:51] between the heavens and the Earth amen
[53:53] with gobs of drunken slobbers and split
[53:55] and spits of soldiers upon his face
[53:57] Jehovah dying for his children
[54:01] see it was not another person amen but
[54:04] it was God himself amen it was not
[54:07] another person it was God himself amen
[54:10] see because God was in his office he
[54:14] said why he was trying to get back to
[54:16] the heart of man amen then when Jehovah
[54:20] left that the the Splendor of Heaven he
[54:22] left the corridors of glory amen and
[54:25] laid aside his robe laid aside his
[54:27] Splendor and took on a robe of human
[54:29] flesh amen he was not doing that to make
[54:32] a name for himself he was not doing that
[54:34] to be something amen he was doing that
[54:37] because he had been kicked out amen of
[54:39] his residency which was the heart of
[54:41] humanity Amen in the beginning it was
[54:44] God in humans in the beginning it was
[54:46] God and Adam it was God in Eve but
[54:48] through the fall and the garden amen God
[54:51] lost his spot in the heart of humanity
[54:54] so he said what I'll do is I will come
[54:56] down amen and by my blood and by my
[54:59] sacrifice and by my death I will will
[55:01] take my position back in the heart of
[55:04] humanity what we need today is a fresh
[55:07] outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon the
[55:09] hearts that are humble amen he said if
[55:11] you could only realize amen that you're
[55:14] nothing but a stable if you can only
[55:16] realize that you are nothing but a
[55:18] stable now I got to thinking about this
[55:20] other day brother John and it kind of
[55:22] got overwhelming to me he meant to think
[55:25] that there was a stable amen that had
[55:27] now y'all ever been out in the barn it
[55:29] stinks right amen you got a bunch of
[55:31] cows and a bunch of horses and a bunch
[55:33] of animals amen it's a bunch of stance
[55:35] and all this amen but when when God came
[55:38] into that stable
[55:40] when God came into that stable amen it
[55:44] changed everything about that stable
[55:45] amen amen come on Amen when they went
[55:48] there they don't record the smell of the
[55:50] manure they don't record how dirty it
[55:53] was they don't report we the only way we
[55:55] know the condition of it is by our
[55:57] knowledge of what a what an environment
[55:59] like that would be right amen but when
[56:01] Jehovah came into that stable amen he
[56:04] changed that stable listen amen
[56:08] I turned this off amen Kings don't go to
[56:10] Stables amen Kings don't go amen and
[56:13] stinking places amen but there was
[56:15] something about the one that was in

[56:38] yourself that you're nothing but a
[56:39] stinking stable amen come up we might as
[56:42] well preach amen every person sitting
[56:44] here I don't care if you got a 401k or
[56:47] you got a negative bank account amen I
[56:49] don't care if you got a retirement home
[56:51] or you don't have anything amen I don't
[56:53] care who you are amen if you're the
[56:55] president if you're the mayor if you're
[56:57] the janitor amen or if you're the bomb
[56:59] underneath the bridge at the downtown
[57:01] Center amen you're nothing but a
[57:03] stinking stable I don't care if you're
[57:05] come on let's preach this morning amen I
[57:07] don't care for a patriot for a singer
[57:09] and for a deacon if for a Sunday school
[57:11] teacher whatever we are amen let's go
[57:14] ahead and say it we're nothing but a
[57:16] stinking stable amen the only thing that
[57:18] sets us apart amen from six billion
[57:21] people on the face of the Earth amen is
[57:24] God through his Sovereign Grace amen
[57:26] place the heart on the inside of us Amen
[57:29] to receive him in the age when he would
[57:31] be coming listen you're nothing but a
[57:33] stable we're nothing come on Amen we
[57:35] were nothing but polluted Stables amen
[57:37] we were polluted truckers we were
[57:39] polluted amen Street Walkers we were
[57:41] well brother Andrew I wasn't a polluted
[57:43] person I went to church you was a
[57:45] polluted church member amen but God who
[57:48] is rich in Mercy amen sin is Grace by
[57:51] his blood into your hearts Amen to
[57:54] change your heart you're nothing but a
[57:56] stable amen but oh if you can open the
[57:58] doors amen of the manger of your heart
[58:01] and let Jehovah come into that amen and
[58:04] watch what takes place amen for he is
[58:07] the word Lord
[58:09] then the manger of the Life of Christ
[58:12] today is the heart of the believer amen
[58:15] if you can let him come in amen he is
[58:17] the word and watch what will take place
[58:19] now when you start looking at this the
[58:21] heart must be prepared right
[58:24] I love how the prophet says this she
[58:26] said I'll tell you a little secret he
[58:28] said first thing friends is the
[58:30] preparation of the human heart amen see
[58:32] right in the human heart we were
[58:34] speaking of it last night right in the
[58:36] human heart is a little compartment in
[58:38] the middle of the human heart that
[58:40] doesn't even have a blood shell in it
[58:42] it's the occupation of the Soul amen
[58:46] it's the occupation of the Soul so man
[58:48] really thinks with his heart and not
[58:51] with his head amen a man really thinks
[58:54] with his heart and not his head amen
[58:56] then I love what Solomon says in
[58:58] proverbs 4 23 he says keep thy heart
[59:01] with all diligence amen keep thy heart
[59:03] amen for out of it are the issues of
[59:06] life that word keep means to guard it
[59:09] means to watch over it means to keep it
[59:11] means to preserve it means to guard from
[59:14] dangers it means to guard with Fidelity
[59:16] it means a Watchman amen amen so Solomon
[59:20] is admonishing the believer that
[59:22] whatever you do amen you keep my heart
[59:25] whatever you do you guard that heart now
[59:27] I'm going to preach to you here for a
[59:29] second amen because there's a war for
[59:31] your heart amen there's a war brother
[59:33] I'm sitting like this he said
[59:34] Christianity versus idolatry amen
[59:37] Christianity is after your heart and
[59:40] idolatry is after the heart amen because
[59:43] idolatry in Christianity Amen in order
[59:46] to have an influence must have a heart
[59:48] amen and Solomon said whatever you do
[59:51] you guard your heart you watch over your
[59:53] heart that's why you better watch what
[59:55] you're watching that's why you better
[59:56] guard your ears from what you're
[59:58] listening to that's why you better keep
[1:00:00] your eyes on your children amen away
[1:00:02] from the things of the world Amen
[1:00:04] because the eye is the gate to the soul
[1:00:06] amen whatever comes in the eye is going
[1:00:08] to the soul amen if you can see Jesus
[1:00:11] he's going to your soul if you can see
[1:00:13] his word amen his word is coming into
[1:00:15] your soul amen I say oh God turn our
[1:00:18] eyes from the things of this world turn
[1:00:20] our eyes from the things of laodicea and
[1:00:23] turn our eyes to the north star and let
[1:00:25] us pursue the things of God with a heart
[1:00:27] that has been guarded by the blood
[1:00:30] oh God Amen we ought to guard our hearts
[1:00:34] I said we ought to guard our hearts amen
[1:00:37] bitterness wants to get in our hearts we
[1:00:39] shouldn't let it get in there
[1:00:40] unforgiveness wants to get in our hearts
[1:00:42] we shouldn't let it get in there bad
[1:00:44] feelings wants to get in our hearts we
[1:00:46] shouldn't let him get in there listen
[1:00:48] that heart don't belong to bitterness
[1:00:50] that heart don't belong to unforgiveness
[1:00:52] that heart don't belong to the devil
[1:00:54] that heart belongs to Jesus Christ he
[1:00:57] does not need a stable a man full of
[1:00:59] bitterness he does not need a stable
[1:01:01] amen full of unforgiveness he needs a
[1:01:03] stable amen with a willing and ready
[1:01:05] heart to receive him in the age that
[1:01:08] you're living in listen you say well
[1:01:09] brother Andrew amen my heart's in a
[1:01:12] terrible condition I say thank God for
[1:01:14] the words of David when he said create
[1:01:16] in me a clean heart oh God and renew a
[1:01:19] right Spirit Within Me creating me a
[1:01:22] clean heart somebody say a clean heart
[1:01:24] creating me a clean heart oh God and
[1:01:27] renew a right Spirit within me the
[1:01:29] Waters of Separation amen that separate
[1:01:32] you from your iniquity amen and so for
[1:01:34] is the preaching of the word in the
[1:01:37] courts amen the Waters of Separation
[1:01:39] that will that will clean your heart is
[1:01:42] the preaching of the word
[1:01:45] the Waters of Separation amen that
[1:01:49] separates you from your iniquity and so
[1:01:51] forth is the preaching of the word in
[1:01:54] the courts he said do you see it the
[1:01:56] Waters of Separation was to be kept in a
[1:01:59] clean place he said then the church must
[1:02:01] be a clean place come on send the light
[1:02:04] church amen The Church Must Be a clean
[1:02:06] Place amen it must not be the habitation
[1:02:09] of every foulbird and all kinds of
[1:02:11] things going on in festants amen that's
[1:02:13] right a clean Place amen the word is to
[1:02:16] be kept in a clean place a clean heart a
[1:02:20] pure conscience that's to be given out
[1:02:22] to the here amen then I say this you
[1:02:25] need a clean heart you need a clean
[1:02:27] conscience and you need a clean Place
[1:02:29] amen for the word which is the cleaning
[1:02:31] power ain't meant to be kept into as the
[1:02:34] eagle stir Thrones in 1960 you may have
[1:02:37] the biggest churches there is in the
[1:02:39] country you may have more money than
[1:02:40] you've ever got that ain't got one thing
[1:02:42] to do with it you might associate with
[1:02:44] what you call a better intellectual
[1:02:46] crowd and you might wear a better suit
[1:02:48] of clothes but brother amen God wants a
[1:02:51] clean heart amen and Clean Hands he
[1:02:54] wants a cleaned up church he said then
[1:02:56] he can show himself listen you can have
[1:02:58] the best preacher the best intellectual
[1:03:00] speaker you can have the biggest bank
[1:03:02] accounts you can have the biggest church
[1:03:04] amen but if you don't have a clean heart
[1:03:06] with Clean Hands amen then God cannot
[1:03:09] find a channel they meant to show
[1:03:11] himself through but if there's a clean
[1:03:13] heart amen with Clean Hands you could be
[1:03:15] as broke as job's turkey I don't know if
[1:03:18] that's a saying up here but it is down
[1:03:19] south and then you can be as broke as I
[1:03:21] don't know what amen but if there's a
[1:03:23] clean heart with Clean Hands Amen in a
[1:03:26] heart to receive the Living God then he
[1:03:28] can come into that church and he can
[1:03:30] show himself alive he can show himself
[1:03:32] in the power of his resurrection listen
[1:03:34] I believe Church the word of God should
[1:03:36] be kept in a clean Place remember I said
[1:03:38] a dirty heart has no place for the word
[1:03:41] of God
[1:03:42] it should be kept in a true
[1:03:45] unadulterated heart that has been
[1:03:47] separated from the fangs of the world if
[1:03:50] you love the world or the thanks of the
[1:03:53] world Amen the love of God isn't even in
[1:03:55] you see the churches don't move the way
[1:03:57] they should because there's too much
[1:04:00] World in there they're trying to mix the
[1:04:03] Waters of Separation with it it must be
[1:04:05] a clean place to see the manifestations
[1:04:08] of the spirit in a clean heart amen The
[1:04:11] Church Must Be a clean place to see the
[1:04:14] manifestations of the spirit in a clean
[1:04:16] heart now people said to me before
[1:04:18] they've said well God said he gives the
[1:04:20] Holy Ghost but he never give it to me
[1:04:22] well God says he gives the promise to
[1:04:24] the father but he but I can't get it but
[1:04:26] do you realize the prophet said you've
[1:04:28] got to prove the promise of the Holy
[1:04:30] Ghost he said if you don't believe God
[1:04:32] will give you the Holy Ghost amen hear
[1:04:34] it recognize it and come up and see if
[1:04:36] he will or not he said now notice how he
[1:04:38] starts this you come with a clean heart
[1:04:41] you come with a sense their wheel and a
[1:04:44] surrender to him and you believe it with
[1:04:46] all your heart and find out what takes
[1:04:48] place yes sir he said there's not an
[1:04:51] intellectual conception of some mental
[1:04:53] something that you've had amen if God
[1:04:56] down in your hearts are calling you he
[1:04:58] will fill you with the Holy Ghost as
[1:05:00] certain as my name's built Branham he
[1:05:03] will sure do it if you will act upon
[1:05:05] what you hear and recognize it to be God
[1:05:07] if you will act up what you're hearing
[1:05:10] and recognize it to be God Amen then he
[1:05:13] said prove me come on it's in Malachi
[1:05:15] the third chapter when he said if you
[1:05:16] don't believe me prove me he said if
[1:05:18] you'll bring your store if you'll bring
[1:05:20] your offerings and tithes into my house
[1:05:22] amen he said then see if I won't open
[1:05:24] the windows of heaven and will pour you
[1:05:26] out a blessing now come on church I'm
[1:05:28] not here preaching for your money amen
[1:05:30] but offering and tires are still in the
[1:05:32] word
[1:05:33] somebody told me one time I said well I
[1:05:36] can't afford to pay my tiers I said you
[1:05:37] can't afford not to pay your tithes well

[1:05:49] much going to tell you how to fix it

[1:05:58] amen I can't do these things listen amen
[1:06:00] it's not amen it's not our suggestions
[1:06:03] it's God's requirement come on Friends
[1:06:05] amen and God is Not Looking for your
[1:06:07] money he's looking for your heart he's
[1:06:10] looking for somebody who will obey him
[1:06:12] by fulfilling the Commandments of this
[1:06:14] word listen you say brother I don't know
[1:06:16] if this will work well let me say this
[1:06:17] amen God just don't want the tithe of
[1:06:19] your income he wants the tithe of your
[1:06:21] time he wants more than just two
[1:06:23] Services a week he wants more than just
[1:06:25] a special meeting every now and again
[1:06:27] amen I think we ought to tie their time
[1:06:29] to God Amen he gives us 24 hours a day
[1:06:32] amen he gives us seven days a week I
[1:06:34] think we ought to give amen some time
[1:06:36] back to him we ought to give him some
[1:06:38] time in prayer we ought to give him some
[1:06:40] time and worship we ought to give him
[1:06:42] some time and meditation amen we ought
[1:06:44] to give ourselves unto God Amen and let
[1:06:47] the Living God come into a living Temple
[1:06:49] and manifest the living Reality by the
[1:06:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost my amen open
[1:06:54] up your heart and will welcome him
[1:06:56] remember said see amen recognize it to
[1:06:59] be God now in Luke the second chapter
[1:07:01] the seventh verse she brought first her
[1:07:03] fourth bro that's a tongue twister she
[1:07:05] brought forth her firstborn son
[1:07:09] amen and wrapped him in swatting clothes
[1:07:11] and laid him in a Manger see because
[1:07:14] there was no room for them in the End
[1:07:17] Amen now the reason he was in a polluted
[1:07:20] stable in a Manger was because there was
[1:07:23] no room for him in the end now look at
[1:07:24] this word in amen it means the lodging
[1:07:27] place it means an eating room or a
[1:07:29] dining room
[1:07:30] so there was no room for him in the End
[1:07:33] Amen so they brought him to a Manger in
[1:07:35] a stable
[1:07:37] deity of Jesus Christ 1949 no room for
[1:07:40] Jesus all for beer no room for Christ
[1:07:43] the cards instead of little book or
[1:07:45] something a Bible amen it's a little
[1:07:46] G-Man book or something like that no
[1:07:48] room for Jesus instead of going to
[1:07:51] church they go to shows and dances and
[1:07:52] everything and call themselves
[1:07:54] Christians but brother when the deity of
[1:07:57] God by the Holy Ghost comes into the
[1:08:00] human heart it calls out everything that
[1:08:04] Christ hasn't created when the deity of
[1:08:07] God by the Holy Ghost comes in the heart
[1:08:09] it calls out everything that Christ
[1:08:12] hasn't created you know that's the truth
[1:08:15] he said see let's invite him in and then
[1:08:18] worship him when he comes see we got to
[1:08:20] forget all the things of the world and
[1:08:22] remember whose presence we're in there
[1:08:25] was no room for him Amen to be born in
[1:08:28] the lodge in the End Amen so instead of
[1:08:31] there he had to go into a Manger into a
[1:08:34] stable into a polluted stall amen and be
[1:08:36] born in a Manger now you know amen today
[1:08:39] we're living in a time where there's no
[1:08:41] room for him Amen to come into
[1:08:43] denominations and produce a word birth
[1:08:45] in Revelation 17 verse 1 the Bible said
[1:08:49] There came one of the Seven Angels which
[1:08:50] had the seven vows and talked with me
[1:08:52] saying come hither and I will show Thee
[1:08:55] the Judgment of the great that
[1:08:57] setteth upon many Waters with whom the
[1:09:00] kings of the Earth have committed
[1:09:01] fornication and the inhabitants of the
[1:09:03] Earth have been made drunk with the wine
[1:09:05] of her fornication so he carried me away
[1:09:08] in the spirit Into the Wilderness and I
[1:09:11] saw a woman amen set up on a Scarlet
[1:09:14] colored Beast amen now watch these words
[1:09:16] full of names of blasphemy having seven
[1:09:19] heads and ten horns amen now the Bible
[1:09:21] says in the King James full of names of
[1:09:24] blasphemy that's the way the English
[1:09:26] give it but the original Greek from the
[1:09:28] die God reads it like this and he
[1:09:30] conducted me in the spirit into a desert
[1:09:32] and I saw a woman sitting up on a
[1:09:35] Scarlet colored Beast amen full of
[1:09:37] Blasphemous names now right there is
[1:09:40] where brother Brown gets the sermon
[1:09:41] titled blasphemius names amen that's a
[1:09:44] lot different from names of blasphemy
[1:09:46] Amen to Blasphemous names what is it now
[1:09:49] she was the mother of harlots now we all
[1:09:52] know that but what is it remember said
[1:09:54] see the Roman Catholic church amen but
[1:09:56] she is full of Blasphemous names now
[1:09:59] watch this the mother of harlots amen is
[1:10:01] the Roman Catholic church amen but the
[1:10:04] names of blasphemy they are full of
[1:10:06] Blasphemous names he said his Methodist
[1:10:09] and Baptist and Presbyterian and Luther
[1:10:11] he said all calling themselves Churches
[1:10:13] of God Amen Blasphemous names he said
[1:10:17] see they call themselves The Church of
[1:10:19] God and they're representing themselves
[1:10:21] before the world in card parties and
[1:10:24] drinking and carrying on and soup
[1:10:26] suppers and everything else and all
[1:10:28] kinds of stuff I come on Church you know
[1:10:31] I'm telling you the truth amen there's
[1:10:32] no room for Jesus but there's room for a
[1:10:35] Friday night bingo game there's no room
[1:10:37] for an old-fashioned prayer meeting but
[1:10:39] there's room for some movie Nights come
[1:10:41] on I'm preaching now amen there's no
[1:10:43] room for the manifestation of the
[1:10:45] resurrection of Jesus Christ but there's
[1:10:47] room for societies and room for women's
[1:10:49] knitting club and room for men's here
[1:10:51] come on church amen when did the house
[1:10:54] of God Amen become a social hall amen
[1:10:56] the house of God is a clean Place amen
[1:10:59] there shouldn't be filthy movies in the
[1:11:01] house of God there shouldn't be filthy
[1:11:03] jokes being told in the house of God I
[1:11:05] say oh God bring back the Waters of
[1:11:07] Separation into the church again and
[1:11:09] clean up the church from the pulpit to
[1:11:11] the back door
[1:11:14] well brother Andrew I don't think these
[1:11:16] things need to be said well there's only
[1:11:17] one church and you're not joined into it
[1:11:19] you're born into it
[1:11:21] and you don't come in there until you're
[1:11:23] washed in the blood of the lamb and
[1:11:25] sealed Away by the Holy Ghost the way
[1:11:28] into the church is not a card the way
[1:11:31] into the church is not a membership amen
[1:11:33] the way into the church is the blood of
[1:11:35] the Lamb amen and the watching of the
[1:11:38] Water by the word he said now they're
[1:11:39] holler at me about kicking against
[1:11:41] organizations it's those Blasphemous
[1:11:43] names amen that call themselves The
[1:11:46] Churches of God Amen Churches of Christ
[1:11:48] churches of methodists and churches its
[1:11:51] lodges not churches now we might as well
[1:11:54] preach since we're on this point amen
[1:11:55] and in the days when Jesus came the
[1:11:57] first time amen who received him amen
[1:12:01] the end didn't receive him because they
[1:12:03] didn't have no room for him and what is
[1:12:05] the end it's a launching Place amen
[1:12:07] there was no room for him in the lodge
[1:12:09] in place and in 1962 a prophet stood
[1:12:13] upon the Earth and said he's here amen
[1:12:16] is here again and he's wanting to birth
[1:12:18] amen people by the word amen and there's
[1:12:20] no room for him in the largest there's
[1:12:22] no room for him in denomination amen but
[1:12:25] thank God when there was no room for him
[1:12:27] in the lodge when there was no room for
[1:12:29] him in the Blasphemous names amen there
[1:12:31] was a bride who was upon the Earth who
[1:12:34] had a heart to receive the Living God I
[1:12:36] say oh open your doors Church unless the
[1:12:39] Living God come in and let the Living
[1:12:41] God birth himself out of you
[1:12:43] oh one church and that's the Church of
[1:12:46] the Lord Jesus Christ and what is it
[1:12:48] it's the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:12:51] in operation on Earth it's made up of a
[1:12:55] many member of any of those
[1:12:56] congregations that would be a member of
[1:12:58] Christ's body you have to be born into

[1:13:04] now you get mad at me if you want to but
[1:13:06] it's the truth anyhow amen make Proclaim
[1:13:08] unity and it's the biggest bunch of
[1:13:10] division you've ever seen in your life
[1:13:12] well it's the truth
[1:13:14] come on well is it the truth or what
[1:13:16] well well we're the we're the Church of
[1:13:19] God Amen well we got 17 different
[1:13:21] branches of one denomination
[1:13:25] well I'm here so I might as well preach
[1:13:27] that
[1:13:28] I remember one time I was in a barber
[1:13:30] shop and I sitting there brother kind of
[1:13:31] interested in me sitting there and a guy
[1:13:32] comes in and he was he was a preacher

[1:13:41] Zion preacher I said oh really he said
[1:13:43] yeah I said I've got some I know some
[1:13:45] people who's in the ambience and he said
[1:13:46] yeah I said so let me ask you something
[1:13:48] I said what do you all believe he said
[1:13:50] well he gave me uh kind of a list of
[1:13:52] things they believed and I said oh
[1:13:53] you're interested and I said my great
[1:13:54] grandfather and great uncle and
[1:13:55] different people in my family were
[1:13:57] United Methodist preachers I said yeah I
[1:14:00] said so let me ask you this I said you
[1:14:02] all believe the same thing I said so why
[1:14:04] is there the United Methodist and then
[1:14:06] the AME Zion he said well the AME Zion
[1:14:09] is predominantly black he said the
[1:14:10] United Methodist predominantly white and
[1:14:12] I said oh I said okay I said well if you
[1:14:15] were going to convert me what would you
[1:14:16] tell me so he starts telling me all
[1:14:18] these things and I said well where would
[1:14:20] you tell me to go he said well I would
[1:14:21] tell you go the AME sign I said okay he
[1:14:24] said now I pray this is okay I said why
[1:14:27] would you tell me there he said well
[1:14:29] because of this and this and this I said
[1:14:31] well funny thing is the AME Zion United
[1:14:33] Memphis believe the same thing I said
[1:14:35] then why is there two separate churches
[1:14:36] he said well there you go sir he said
[1:14:38] once predominantly black and one's
[1:14:40] predominantly why I said so what you're
[1:14:42] telling me is what you believe ain't
[1:14:43] strong enough to bring two races
[1:14:45] together
[1:14:48] come on Church what you're telling me
[1:14:50] don't have enough power to bring come
[1:14:52] Amen to bring two races together to
[1:14:54] enjoy the blessings of God don't tell me
[1:14:57] that's the Church of God that's a spirit
[1:14:59] of division when I say thank God for a
[1:15:01] message where a black man can Shout with
[1:15:03] a white man where a white man can pray
[1:15:05] with a black man I'm on this message
[1:15:07] ain't a bunch of racial divisions it's
[1:15:09] the message of Jesus Christ and in him
[1:15:12] is no denomination in him is in no
[1:15:14] division in him is no separation he is
[1:15:17] God and he's the god of unity he's the
[1:15:19] god of power he's the god of reality
[1:15:22] he's the god of forgiveness he's the god
[1:15:24] of love I say oh that's the power of the
[1:15:27] Living God come in the church again and
[1:15:29] manifest itself in a living Temple we
[1:15:32] believe in stuff based on division we're
[1:15:34] one body we're one motive we're one
[1:15:36] objective
[1:15:38] I'm on Church
[1:15:40] well I pray I didn't stir up too much
[1:15:43] trouble
[1:15:44] but it's the truth
[1:15:46] what we believe has got the power to
[1:15:48] tear down racial barriers got the power
[1:15:51] to tear down listen amen I tell you this
[1:15:53] amen thank God for a message we're not
[1:15:55] judged based on our economic status
[1:15:59] you can be as poor as poor can be and
[1:16:01] still be a part of this church you can
[1:16:03] be as rich as Rich can be and still be a
[1:16:05] part because it's not a division it's a
[1:16:08] Unity by the Living God and the only way
[1:16:11] it can happen is by a changing of the
[1:16:13] heart now see God chose a humble manger
[1:16:16] then he's choosing a humble heart today
[1:16:19] the Bible says the Lord is nine of them
[1:16:21] that are of a broken heart and save as
[1:16:23] such amen that be of a contrite spirit
[1:16:26] see with the humble heart we embrace the
[1:16:29] word now I find it very powerful the
[1:16:31] prophet said we'd probably blow the
[1:16:32] whistles and Hoist the flags and lay out
[1:16:34] the red carpets and everything to
[1:16:36] receive the president of the nation to
[1:16:38] come to this city but just think that
[1:16:40] would be all right and it would be an
[1:16:41] honor to the city but think in our
[1:16:43] little humble Tabernacle tonight we are
[1:16:46] inviting the King of Kings God and he
[1:16:48] don't desire carpets to be thrown out
[1:16:50] and so forth he desires Humble Hearts to
[1:16:53] be laid out so that he might take these
[1:16:56] Humble Hearts and reveal to them the
[1:16:58] thing that God has in store for all
[1:17:01] those who love him
[1:17:03] come on church amen if a president comes
[1:17:06] we would say oh he's come defend man
[1:17:08] amen the president has come and it would
[1:17:10] be an honor to the city but what about
[1:17:12] right here this morning amen the Living
[1:17:14] God the god of gods the King of Kings
[1:17:17] amen has descended from his throne and
[1:17:19] Glory into the Church of the Living God
[1:17:21] I say he's not come here Amen to walk on
[1:17:24] red carpet he's not come here to be
[1:17:26] paraded around town Amen on the float
[1:17:29] amen he has come here amen looking for a
[1:17:31] humble heart it could be a five-year-old
[1:17:33] heart it could be a 50 year old heart it
[1:17:36] could be an 80 year old heart he just is
[1:17:38] looking for a heart that'll open up his
[1:17:40] doors and will receive him to come in in
[1:17:43] the power of who he is
[1:17:47] I'll tell you what Humble Hearts are
[1:17:49] they're Honest Hearts
[1:17:51] Humble Hearts are honest hearts and you
[1:17:54] know what the prophet said he said the
[1:17:56] Holy Spirit today is hunting out honest
[1:17:59] hearts that will believe the message
[1:18:03] what kind of people we should be amen
[1:18:05] humble-hearted people now on the day of
[1:18:07] Pentecost I found it very amazing that
[1:18:09] when Peter preached the inaugural sermon
[1:18:11] on the day of Pentecost amen the Bible
[1:18:14] said when they heard this amen they were
[1:18:16] pricked in their heart and said unto
[1:18:19] Peter and the rest of the Apostles men
[1:18:20] and Brethren what shall we do look at
[1:18:22] this word pricked it means to prick it
[1:18:25] means to pierce it means to pain the
[1:18:27] Mind sharply it means to agitate it
[1:18:29] vehemently it means to use the emotion
[1:18:32] of Sorrow amen then Peter said unto them
[1:18:35] repent and be baptized every one of you
[1:18:39] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[1:18:41] remission of your sins and you shall
[1:18:44] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:18:47] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:18:49] children and to all that are far off
[1:18:51] even as many as the Lord Our God shall
[1:18:54] call and with many words did he testify
[1:18:57] and exhort saying save yourselves from
[1:18:59] this untoward generation then they that
[1:19:02] gladly received his word were baptized
[1:19:05] then they that gladly received his word
[1:19:07] were baptized and the same day they were
[1:19:10] added unto them about three thousand
[1:19:13] Souls they've been watched before a
[1:19:15] receiving there was a repenting and
[1:19:17] where did it start it started in the
[1:19:20] heart of humanity I'm on church I love
[1:19:23] how the prophet tells us illustration or
[1:19:25] this testimony he said and he's in
[1:19:27] Jehovah Jireh 1962 Grass Valley
[1:19:29] California he says of all my travels
[1:19:32] through the U.S the United States and
[1:19:34] Canada I seen something last night that
[1:19:36] thrilled me than all the wheelchairs
[1:19:38] I've seen emptied up
[1:19:40] now when I hear that I'm going to keep
[1:19:42] reading amen I seen something last night
[1:19:45] that thrilled me then all the ill the
[1:19:47] wheelchairs I've seen emptied up then
[1:19:49] all the crutches I've seen laid down
[1:19:51] then all the blind to see the death to
[1:19:53] hear the dumbness speak the dead that's
[1:19:55] been raised up amen the doctor signed a
[1:19:57] statement that the person was dead and
[1:19:59] raised up and that's all been thrilling
[1:20:02] but when I seen people last night who
[1:20:04] were members of the church received
[1:20:07] truth and stand right up in the midst of
[1:20:09] the people Amen to confess the wrong and
[1:20:12] they're willing to do right that was the
[1:20:14] best I know of
[1:20:16] foreign
[1:20:19] more than all the deaf ears and stops
[1:20:22] more than all the blinded eyes opened
[1:20:24] more than all the crutches laid down was
[1:20:26] people when they heard the word they
[1:20:28] were willing to Humble themselves to the
[1:20:30] word they was hearing and repent of
[1:20:32] their wrongs and say Lord I Want to Be
[1:20:34] Right he said the church perhaps the
[1:20:36] bride is done chosen it's get her ready
[1:20:39] now amen the Revival is over we know
[1:20:42] that there's no more Revival spirit amen
[1:20:44] two hours of service and everybody is
[1:20:46] complaining Amen in a Revival it's day
[1:20:48] and night all the time never breaks he
[1:20:51] said the Revival is done so we are just
[1:20:53] gleaning amen remember Abraham send his
[1:20:56] servant Eliezer Amen to sweat it out
[1:20:58] until he found character and then when
[1:21:00] he found character the next thing was to
[1:21:02] prepare her then to meet the bridegroom
[1:21:04] that's the next thing you remember when
[1:21:06] he found her he found her in the evening
[1:21:08] time amen the evening light amen
[1:21:11] striking that women and men both last
[1:21:13] night seeing them in respect to the word
[1:21:16] amen stand up and admit they're wrong
[1:21:18] and coach God's forgiveness and to go on
[1:21:21] he said this is the place to have a
[1:21:23] Revival come on church this is the place
[1:21:26] to have a Revival if there'd be any
[1:21:28] Revival I know of it would happen right
[1:21:31] along here where Honest Hearts amen why
[1:21:34] because you got something to work on
[1:21:36] Amen if you listen if you only got two
[1:21:38] people in your church but you got two
[1:21:40] Honest Hearts you can turn two into
[1:21:42] twenty and twenty into 200 and 200 into
[1:21:46] 2 000. amen because it's not based upon
[1:21:49] quantity it's based upon the quality of
[1:21:51] the heart that is receiving the word
[1:21:53] that's being released in the age that
[1:21:55] it's coming listen I say oh God Amen Let
[1:21:57] Us skin our eyes off of numbers let's
[1:22:00] get our eyes off of Who's Who and who's
[1:22:01] not and who's weird who's doing what and
[1:22:04] let us get our eyes back on the promise
[1:22:06] that if two or three are gathered in my
[1:22:08] name I will come into their midst and I
[1:22:10] will baptize them with the Holy Ghost I
[1:22:13] will change them I will energize them I
[1:22:15] will stimulate faith in them to receive
[1:22:18] me and to man manifest me in the world
[1:22:20] and age we're living in
[1:22:23] when you got an honest heart you could
[1:22:25] have a Revival
[1:22:26] he said most of them will get arrogant
[1:22:28] they don't want nothing about it but see
[1:22:30] that type is a denominational seed
[1:22:34] it's not a seat of Abraham he said a
[1:22:37] Seed of Abraham sees the word
[1:22:39] and it believes the word quickly
[1:22:43] oh my a Seed of Abraham sees the word
[1:22:49] believes the word quickly now you all
[1:22:51] look here with me in the Book of Luke 5
[1:22:53] chapter I want to just just take a few
[1:22:55] more thoughts here with you if that's
[1:22:56] okay and Luke said chapter the fourth
[1:22:58] verse the Bible here says and when much
[1:23:00] people were gathered together they were
[1:23:02] come to the out into every city and he
[1:23:04] spake him spake by a parable he says A
[1:23:07] sower went out to sow a seed and as he
[1:23:09] sowed some fell by the wayside and it
[1:23:12] was TRON down and the thousands of the
[1:23:13] air devoured it verse six some fell upon
[1:23:16] a rock and it soon was sprung up and
[1:23:18] then it withered away because it lacked
[1:23:19] moisture verse 7 and some fell among
[1:23:22] thorns and the Thorns sprang up with it
[1:23:24] and choked it but then other fell on
[1:23:27] good ground and sprang up and bear fruit
[1:23:29] a hundredfold and when he had said these
[1:23:31] things he cried he that hath ears to
[1:23:34] hear and let him hear
[1:23:36] isn't this astounding these are the same
[1:23:38] words he uses in the end of every
[1:23:41] dispensational Gentile age when he will
[1:23:44] say unto Ephesus under fatira understood
[1:23:46] he will always end it by saying he that
[1:23:49] hath an ear let him hear what the spirit
[1:23:51] is saying in other words the spirit is
[1:23:54] sowing the word seed of the age that the
[1:23:57] ears are hearing that word in and the
[1:23:59] disciples ask him saying what might this
[1:24:01] Parable be now what he done there was he
[1:24:03] shows you four different types of ground
[1:24:06] he said there's the Wayside there's the
[1:24:09] rock there's the Thorns then there's
[1:24:10] good ground and he's sending them verse
[1:24:12] 10 unto you it is given to know the
[1:24:14] mysteries of the kingdom of God but to
[1:24:16] others in Parables that see and they may
[1:24:19] not see and in hearing they may not
[1:24:21] understand verse 11 now the parable is
[1:24:24] this amen the seed is the word of God
[1:24:27] the parable is this the seed is the word
[1:24:30] of God now he goes in now he goes back
[1:24:32] to the different four types of ground
[1:24:34] and now he says in verse 12 by the way
[1:24:36] Saturday that here then cometh the devil
[1:24:39] and taketh away the word of their out of
[1:24:40] their hearts unless they should believe
[1:24:42] and be saved on The Rock are they which
[1:24:44] when they hear receive the word with joy
[1:24:46] but these have no roots which for a
[1:24:49] while believe but in the time of
[1:24:50] Temptation Fall Away amen verse 14 that
[1:24:53] which fell among the Thorns or they
[1:24:55] which when they have heard now notice
[1:24:56] this they're all hearing the word amen
[1:24:59] go forth in her choke with cares and
[1:25:01] with riches and pleasures of this life
[1:25:03] and bring no fruit to Perfection but
[1:25:05] verse 15 is the one I love amen but that
[1:25:07] on the good ground are they which in an
[1:25:10] honest and good
[1:25:12] heart amen having heard the word amen
[1:25:16] they keep it and bring forth fruit with
[1:25:18] patience now listen the prophet of God
[1:25:19] said predestinated plan is in plain view
[1:25:22] amen the word of God is a seed and must
[1:25:26] have the ground prepared beforehand so
[1:25:29] God in his Sovereign Grace amen prepares
[1:25:32] the heart first he prepared you before
[1:25:34] the foundation of the world to receive
[1:25:37] him in this age
[1:25:40] come on Church the devil didn't have a
[1:25:43] chance at you because before you come in
[1:25:45] the world you were coming as prepared
[1:25:47] ground to receive the Living God Amen he
[1:25:51] foreknew You by foreknowledge and
[1:25:53] ordained you to eternal life he knew you
[1:25:55] therefore he prepared you that's the
[1:25:57] reason you staggered out of these things
[1:25:59] and staggered into what you have now
[1:26:01] amen it was God leading you to the place
[1:26:04] where he had ordained for you to be if
[1:26:06] the ground isn't prepared beforehand it
[1:26:09] cannot grow now listen some of y'all
[1:26:11] heard the word five years ago you heard
[1:26:13] it 15 years ago you heard it 25 years
[1:26:16] ago 50 years ago amen and here you are
[1:26:18] today amen still believing the same word
[1:26:21] still holding on to the same word you
[1:26:24] know why because your heart was a humble
[1:26:26] but an honest heart that was prepared by
[1:26:29] a predestinated seed to receive the word
[1:26:32] of God and to manifest the word and to
[1:26:35] bring forth the word of fruit with
[1:26:37] patience unto God listen this gospel
[1:26:39] isn't worth only but it's through the
[1:26:41] power and the manifestation of the holy
[1:26:44] spirit it's the production of Mark 16.
[1:26:47] amen the signs and wonders shall follow
[1:26:49] them that believe he said see the word
[1:26:51] itself is dead until it becomes into an
[1:26:55] action and produces life and except
[1:26:57] according to wheat falling the ground
[1:26:59] and die it abides alone but when the
[1:27:01] word is brought I'm coming to a closure
[1:27:03] quickly when the word is brought into a
[1:27:06] heart of Faith amen that makes every
[1:27:09] promise in the Bible live again see it's
[1:27:11] got to live it's a germanized word and
[1:27:15] it must live if it's received in the
[1:27:17] right place come on church if you bring
[1:27:19] if you bring an orange citrus tree amen
[1:27:22] from the from the orange groves of
[1:27:23] Florida amen up here to the cold war
[1:27:25] north of Michigan amen that Florida amen
[1:27:28] trees not going to grow because it's not
[1:27:30] in the right ground it's not in the
[1:27:32] right conditions and if you put this
[1:27:34] message Amen in a Baptist Church it's
[1:27:36] not going to grow it's not going to grow
[1:27:38] in a Methodist Church it's not even
[1:27:40] growing a Pentecostal church amen you
[1:27:42] come on we might also going preach it
[1:27:44] won't even grow in a non-denominational
[1:27:46] church amen because there is
[1:27:48] denominational as the denominations are
[1:27:50] amen but if you put this word amen not
[1:27:52] in a building not in a church room but
[1:27:55] in the heart of a human with a heart of
[1:27:58] faith and the quickening Dynamics of
[1:28:00] Holy Spirit begins to fall upon that
[1:28:02] word it will begin to produce every
[1:28:04] Divine promise that's in God's word
[1:28:08] well it's the truth it must live if it's
[1:28:10] in the right place now when it's under
[1:28:12] the right conditions every seed will
[1:28:14] live again right but it's got to be put
[1:28:16] under the right condition now what
[1:28:18] you'll do then is you'll either receive
[1:28:20] or you will reject
[1:28:22] you will either receive the Living God
[1:28:24] or you will reject the Living God John 1
[1:28:27] 10 he was in the world the world was
[1:28:28] made by him and the world knew him not
[1:28:30] he came into his own in his own receipt
[1:28:32] him not I wish I was a preacher right
[1:28:34] now there are some powerful words laying
[1:28:36] right there he came into the world and
[1:28:38] the world knew him not and he was the
[1:28:41] maker of the world he was in and they
[1:28:43] didn't even know him but he came into
[1:28:45] his own and his own received him now
[1:28:48] look at this word received it means para
[1:28:50] lambeno it's a Greek word for for
[1:28:52] received it means to accept or to
[1:28:55] acknowledge one to be in such a secret
[1:28:57] professes to be not to reject a man not
[1:29:01] to withhold obedience remember so when
[1:29:03] Christ came on Earth it came to his own
[1:29:05] and his own received him not and those
[1:29:08] Jews were instructed by the scriptures
[1:29:11] of what kind of a character that the
[1:29:13] Messiah would be and the Messiah was to
[1:29:15] be a prophet according to their laws
[1:29:18] amen Moses said the Lord your God shall
[1:29:20] raise up a prophet like me and to him
[1:29:21] the people push our cling and if he
[1:29:23] won't hear him they'll be cut off from
[1:29:25] the people see the scripture never
[1:29:27] leaves any age without a clear-cut
[1:29:30] identification that we might know the
[1:29:33] hour we're living in listen friends he
[1:29:35] came to his own and his own had the
[1:29:38] scriptures they had the teachings they
[1:29:40] had the rabbis they had the Pharisees
[1:29:42] but what had happened was they had not
[1:29:44] recognized him into the word said he
[1:29:47] would be he was not coming according to
[1:29:49] their Customs therefore they could not
[1:29:51] receive him because he was not coming
[1:29:54] according to where they thought he would
[1:29:55] come but I find myself in verse 12 but
[1:29:58] as many as receive him Amen to them gave
[1:30:01] he power to become the sons of God even
[1:30:05] to them that believe on his name I think
[1:30:07] the last time I preached for you I spoke
[1:30:09] on the name of Jesus Christ that Sunday
[1:30:10] morning in them that believe on his name
[1:30:13] amen listen we have come back under the
[1:30:16] pure Revelation brother of the name of
[1:30:18] God we're not believing on some magic
[1:30:21] name we're not believe even on some
[1:30:22] wishing name we are believing only
[1:30:25] authoritative name of the Living God
[1:30:27] Jehovah amen come on church and that
[1:30:29] word received amen same word as John 1
[1:30:32] 10 it's the same word in John 1 12
[1:30:35] spelled the same way but it's got a
[1:30:37] totally different meaning in John 1 10
[1:30:40] received is paralambino Amen in John 1
[1:30:44] 12 received means lambeno which means to
[1:30:47] take with the hand it means to lay hold
[1:30:50] of any person or thing in order to use
[1:30:52] it in John 1 10 they profess you or him
[1:30:56] they profess this is the one that is to
[1:30:58] come but they never reached out and
[1:31:01] received him by claiming him as their
[1:31:03] own personal property amen but unto them
[1:31:06] who will break out of the denominational
[1:31:08] Traditions unto them that'll break out
[1:31:11] of the Blasphemous names and will take
[1:31:13] their hand and will lay it on the
[1:31:15] revelation of the word in the age
[1:31:17] they're living in they will pull him
[1:31:19] into their souls and as many as received
[1:31:21] him come to them gave me power to become
[1:31:24] the sons of God listen I think you may
[1:31:26] think I'm crazy amen but I feel the
[1:31:29] power of the resurrected Lord and is
[1:31:31] flowing through my body this morning I
[1:31:33] have received him I have seen him I have
[1:31:36] believed on him
[1:31:40] Hallelujah if you can receive him you'll
[1:31:43] lay hold on him you will claim him
[1:31:46] I love this one it means to take what is
[1:31:49] one's own
[1:31:52] they took him as their own
[1:31:54] he's not just the Messiah he's not just
[1:31:57] the god of the Jew he's my God
[1:32:02] oh I wish I was out in the field right
[1:32:04] now I'd cut up
[1:32:06] dissociate with oneself as a companion
[1:32:09] it means to receive what is offered not
[1:32:12] to refuse or to reject it means to
[1:32:15] receive a person and to give him access
[1:32:18] to oneself
[1:32:22] when you receive him you're given access
[1:32:25] to him you all got the tapes door to the
[1:32:28] heart
[1:32:29] door in a door
[1:32:31] over and over and over what's he saying
[1:32:33] he's saying you're a human you've got a
[1:32:35] heart but there's many doors in that
[1:32:37] heart
[1:32:38] but if you'll let him come in he said
[1:32:41] someone let him come in but they'll say
[1:32:43] don't go in that door don't go in that
[1:32:45] room stay out of my pride come on now
[1:32:48] stay out of the Door of Faith stay out
[1:32:51] of the door of my side amen he said but
[1:32:52] if you'll let him come in he said and
[1:32:55] give him access to every door he wants
[1:32:57] to go he said and he goes in there come
[1:33:00] on church he said if he goes in the door
[1:33:02] of Faith he said you'll say well you
[1:33:03] can't come in here Lord amen because
[1:33:05] that's against my faith he said but if
[1:33:07] you let him come in he said as soon as
[1:33:10] he steps in the door of Faith he will
[1:33:12] scream out I'm Jesus Christ the same
[1:33:14] yesterday today and forever and he said
[1:33:17] you will move from Human faith into the
[1:33:19] faith of Jesus Christ to perform the
[1:33:22] will of Jesus Christ
[1:33:26] now I'll just tell you this in case you
[1:33:27] ever need it amen sometimes people say
[1:33:30] well there's some trouble in the church
[1:33:31] I was reading one day I was actually I
[1:33:33] was on the phone with a brother and he
[1:33:34] was telling me about some situations and
[1:33:36] things he said Andrew he said help me
[1:33:37] pray with it he said I got some problems
[1:33:39] in the church he said I don't know what
[1:33:40] to do he said I don't know how to fix it
[1:33:41] that's what brother I'll be praying with
[1:33:42] you as a pastor and that's just praying
[1:33:44] along there and I was listening to a
[1:33:45] tape and Reverend said here's the
[1:33:47] problem he said when trouble comes in
[1:33:49] the church he said the reason there's
[1:33:50] trouble is because you won't let God
[1:33:52] Access the doors he wants to go into
[1:33:54] oh
[1:33:56] you all know that's the truth
[1:33:59] people will say Lord don't go in there
[1:34:01] Lord stay out of there Lord you're
[1:34:04] welcome here but stay out here but he
[1:34:06] wants to gain access to every door in
[1:34:09] the heart of the believer
[1:34:12] I say Lord I don't just want to
[1:34:14] acknowledge you and profess you
[1:34:16] I want to take my hand and lay hold of
[1:34:18] you
[1:34:19] I may say this morning Lord I want to
[1:34:22] lay hold of you
[1:34:24] I don't want to just pair a lambane on
[1:34:26] you I don't want to just receive you as
[1:34:28] a profession
[1:34:29] but I wanna I wanna take that other one
[1:34:31] I want to lay hold of you
[1:34:33] I want you to become my companion
[1:34:38] when he received them he said he
[1:34:40] breathed on him said receive the Holy
[1:34:41] Ghost that's the same word in John 1 12.
[1:34:43] he shall receive power same word in John
[1:34:45] 1 12. he said see receive him the holy
[1:34:48] spirit is making it live manifesting it
[1:34:51] if he promised these Blessings by the
[1:34:52] word
[1:34:54] somebody say with me he's sending the
[1:34:56] word
[1:34:57] he's sending the word
[1:35:01] not me he
[1:35:02] he's sending the word
[1:35:06] and producing what he said is the gospel
[1:35:11] set you like this in closing there is
[1:35:14] ascending station
[1:35:15] and there is a receiving station
[1:35:18] the father God said ascending station
[1:35:20] that's heaven
[1:35:22] we got a receiving station that's your
[1:35:24] heart
[1:35:26] keep by heart
[1:35:28] created me a clean heart
[1:35:30] your heart is the receiving station
[1:35:33] to the to the sending station and when
[1:35:35] really in your heart you accept the word
[1:35:37] of God he said it becomes positive no
[1:35:40] matter what the rest of them is seeing
[1:35:42] you're seeing it anyhow Abraham believed
[1:35:44] God and it was imputed into him for
[1:35:45] righteousness see we got ascending
[1:35:47] station and a receiving station just
[1:35:50] tune all the static unbelief out and
[1:35:54] watch what takes place
[1:35:56] he said watch the picture clear up then
[1:35:58] you say oh yes Lord I see now see it
[1:36:02] makes the difference it depends on how
[1:36:04] much static you let get in
[1:36:06] don't let any static in just stay right
[1:36:09] with God right with the word and God
[1:36:11] will bring it right straight through to
[1:36:13] the positive every time
[1:36:16] somebody say sending station
[1:36:18] receiving station
[1:36:21] the sending station is heaven the
[1:36:23] receiving station is your heart now
[1:36:24] listen that's two different dimensions
[1:36:27] right that's two different dimensions
[1:36:30] remember the father God says like listen
[1:36:31] said I was out in Canada the other day
[1:36:33] holding a meeting he said I was walking
[1:36:34] downtown and he said I passed by a guy
[1:36:36] he was selling television sets he said I
[1:36:38] walked by him guy said how you doing he
[1:36:40] said we're doing pretty good he said
[1:36:41] what are you in town for he said I can
[1:36:42] tell you you're not from here he said
[1:36:44] well I'm here he said I'm here for some
[1:36:46] gospel meetings he said oh he said you
[1:36:47] must be with that random outfit there
[1:36:49] remember said yeah he said yeah I am he
[1:36:52] said okay he said yeah he said I heard
[1:36:54] last night or the other night there was
[1:36:56] a man got up out of wheelchair and
[1:36:57] walked he said then I heard there was
[1:36:59] somebody threw their crutches down he
[1:37:00] said then I heard he said I don't go for
[1:37:02] all that stuff but he said oh you don't
[1:37:03] he said no he said I don't go for all
[1:37:05] that stuff he said why don't you go for
[1:37:07] all that he said well because you can't
[1:37:08] see what's being done he said you can't
[1:37:10] see where it's coming from remember I
[1:37:12] said oh really he said now I knew that
[1:37:13] old saying you give enough cow enough
[1:37:15] rope you'll it'll hang itself right he
[1:37:17] said so I stood there and kept talking
[1:37:18] to him and he said after a few minutes I
[1:37:20] looked at him I said sir God nice
[1:37:22] television set here don't you he said
[1:37:24] yeah he said well you want to buy one
[1:37:25] remember said no we don't have one in
[1:37:27] our homes
[1:37:28] whole different sermon
[1:37:31] he said no we don't have one at home he
[1:37:33] said but I would like to ask you
[1:37:34] something he said that picture on that
[1:37:36] television he said where's that coming
[1:37:38] from he said well that's coming from a
[1:37:40] guy over in the states right now playing
[1:37:41] a guitar he said well here we are in
[1:37:44] Canada he said and that guy's not in
[1:37:46] Canada but it's on the television he
[1:37:48] said yeah he said there's a sending
[1:37:50] station and there's a receiving station
[1:37:52] remember I said oh yeah he said see see
[1:37:55] anything scientifically that's proven he
[1:37:57] said I don't want to be a part of it's
[1:37:58] what the salesman said he said there's
[1:38:00] nothing to it it's only the things
[1:38:02] that's not scientifically proven as real
[1:38:04] is what remember I'm saying and the guy
[1:38:05] said oh that's ridiculous he said well
[1:38:07] for instance right now he said coming
[1:38:09] through the room is television pictures
[1:38:11] and I said you have to show me the
[1:38:13] picture
[1:38:15] he said of course he said here it is it
[1:38:18] hits the crystal the tubes and so forth
[1:38:20] and it shows the picture here I said but
[1:38:22] that man's in the United States and
[1:38:25] you're picking him up over here and he's
[1:38:26] coming to the air and you can't see him
[1:38:28] he said but we can prove it because
[1:38:30] there's a picture showing that it's over
[1:38:32] there he said then there's ascending
[1:38:34] station to prove that it's here the
[1:38:36] sending station is proven through the
[1:38:38] receiving station what's at the sending
[1:38:41] station
[1:38:41] come on church at the sending station
[1:38:44] there was a man playing a guitar at the
[1:38:47] receiving station brother there was a
[1:38:49] man on a picture amen playing a guitar
[1:38:51] that was witnessing what you're seeing
[1:38:53] in the receiving station is real at the
[1:38:56] sending station in other words what's
[1:38:58] real in heaven is being manifested in
[1:39:01] your heart and what's being manifested
[1:39:03] in your heart is a testimony that it's
[1:39:05] real in heaven amen when he's sending
[1:39:07] from the ascendants they sin is
[1:39:09] manifested in the receiving station I
[1:39:11] said oh yes we can prove it too he said
[1:39:13] well there's ascending station in glory
[1:39:15] and he said we've got the Risen Savior
[1:39:17] who sends it forth amen and the Holy
[1:39:20] Ghost reveals it and makes it positive
[1:39:22] therefore we got a sending station and a
[1:39:25] receiving station and God in heaven
[1:39:27] somebody say God in heaven God in heaven
[1:39:30] who knows all things can so put a gift
[1:39:32] in his church that he can magnify it and
[1:39:35] reflect himself through it and say
[1:39:37] things which is absolutely impossible by
[1:39:40] scientists to prove seat we do not walk
[1:39:42] by things we do not see we walk by
[1:39:44] things we do not see we walk by the
[1:39:47] steps of faith
[1:39:50] what are you saying about Andrew I'm
[1:39:52] saying if God sends a message it's
[1:39:55] coming from ascending station
[1:39:57] there's a receiving station on the earth
[1:39:59] going to receive do you realize right
[1:40:01] now brother Mark that right now in this
[1:40:03] room there's there right now in this
[1:40:05] room there's waves going through this
[1:40:07] room do you realize right now 10 or 15
[1:40:10] miles we'll sit this way on 23 right now
[1:40:13] there's people listening to their radios
[1:40:15] driving up and down the interstate
[1:40:16] they're listening to the radio do you
[1:40:18] realize right now what they're hearing
[1:40:20] is passing through here on the way to
[1:40:22] the radio
[1:40:23] what they're hearing right now is
[1:40:26] passing through this room on their way
[1:40:28] to the radio but it's not affecting you
[1:40:30] you was under you you was unaware of it
[1:40:32] until I pointed it out to you now some
[1:40:34] of y'all cry now some of y'all gonna
[1:40:35] think I'm crazy but I'm not okay amen
[1:40:37] amen radio wage signals they've been
[1:40:40] going through the room right now you
[1:40:42] were not thinking about that until I
[1:40:43] brought it to your attention do you know
[1:40:45] why amen because there's nothing in you
[1:40:48] to pick up what's coming through here
[1:40:49] but there is something in that radio or
[1:40:52] it's wired in a way to receive the
[1:40:54] signal and when the signal hits the the
[1:40:56] crystal it will begin to display and
[1:40:58] manifest whether it's just picked up
[1:41:00] come on church amen right now somewhere
[1:41:02] there's somebody sitting in their homes
[1:41:03] when they should be in the house of God
[1:41:05] and they're watching television amen and
[1:41:07] you know what the signal that's going to
[1:41:09] the television is coming to this room
[1:41:11] right now but you don't feel it amen it
[1:41:13] ain't prickling on your skin it ain't
[1:41:15] tickling your eyes amen you know why
[1:41:17] amen because you're not ordained to pick
[1:41:20] it up amen but there's something else
[1:41:22] coming through here it's G Jesus Christ
[1:41:24] the son of God it's the power of the
[1:41:26] Holy Ghost it's the resurrection it's
[1:41:29] the life and the witness and the
[1:41:30] testimony of the one true Living God and
[1:41:33] when that begins to come to the room
[1:41:34] amen something in your heart begins to
[1:41:36] Paul say yes do you know what that is
[1:41:38] it's because you were ordained to pick
[1:41:40] up the signal that was being sent from
[1:41:43] the ascending station in glory
[1:41:47] Hallelujah
[1:41:49] there is descending station and there's
[1:41:52] a receiving station
[1:41:54] let our musicians come this morning
[1:41:56] there is ascending station and there is
[1:41:59] a receiving station remember said if God
[1:42:00] sends a message someone's going to
[1:42:02] receive it
[1:42:04] he said like this he said see when Jesus
[1:42:06] Christ spoke these words they never die
[1:42:08] science claims in 20 years from now they
[1:42:11] can pick up the literal voice
[1:42:13] they'll be able to pick up the literal
[1:42:15] voice of Jesus you know why because it's
[1:42:19] still in the Earth
[1:42:22] see it's ascending post then there has
[1:42:26] to be a receiving post
[1:42:28] I love brother John the worst he says
[1:42:31] and if you can be the receptacle
[1:42:35] foreign
[1:42:37] are you hearing me if you can be the
[1:42:40] receptacle the receiving post to receive
[1:42:44] the word of God then it's real to you
[1:42:46] and it'll live just like it was then
[1:42:53] how many can say Lord make me a
[1:42:55] receptacle to the Living God
[1:42:59] make me a receptacle to the message of
[1:43:03] the hour
[1:43:04] you know what a receptacle is if you
[1:43:06] look up the definition it's a brother a
[1:43:08] Seth's cousin a good buddy of mine
[1:43:09] brother Josh they're they're
[1:43:10] electricians if you get to looking at
[1:43:12] that if you get to looking at a
[1:43:13] receptacle you know what it's also
[1:43:15] called it's called an outlet
[1:43:17] so you say hey plug this in the
[1:43:19] receptacle somebody else say hey plug it
[1:43:21] in the outlet same thing
[1:43:22] so you see I I don't have one in front
[1:43:25] if there's one you probably sit up here
[1:43:26] right here there's a receptacle and
[1:43:29] there's an outlet
[1:43:31] right I'm not giving you electrical
[1:43:33] lesson right now okay hey
[1:43:36] not going there
[1:43:37] there's don't ask me to test it either
[1:43:41] that receptacle is built to house
[1:43:44] something that receptacle is is housing
[1:43:46] power do you realize you can have
[1:43:48] something amen but you got to plug it in
[1:43:51] so you you can have a vacuum you can
[1:43:53] have a you can have a phone charger you
[1:43:55] can have whatever amen but you need a
[1:43:57] receptacle so what happens is you plug
[1:43:59] that into the receptacle and then the
[1:44:02] receptacle is an outlet because when the
[1:44:04] receptacle has something plugged into it
[1:44:06] they're sipping in there that converts
[1:44:08] it and it goes from receiving to
[1:44:10] outputting
[1:44:12] it goes from receiving amen the cord to
[1:44:15] the vacuum cleaner and when the cord is
[1:44:18] plugged in there's a connection made and
[1:44:20] it sends a power out of the receptacle
[1:44:22] into the outlet and the vacuum begins to
[1:44:24] run come on Church don't you see what
[1:44:26] you are you are a receptacle and you are
[1:44:29] an outlet at Jesus Christ you have
[1:44:31] received the Holy Ghost you have
[1:44:33] received the new birth you have received
[1:44:35] the Living God you have received the
[1:44:37] message it has been plugged into your
[1:44:39] life and now by receiving it you become
[1:44:41] an outlet and you're letting your light
[1:44:43] shine wherever you go wherever you be
[1:44:46] whatever you do whatever you say
[1:44:47] whatever you speak you are manifesting
[1:44:49] you are an outlet you are a display of
[1:44:52] the power of the Living God once you
[1:44:53] stand to your feet with us this morning
[1:44:54] oh I say God make me a receptacle
[1:44:58] oh God make me a receptacle
[1:45:01] hallelujah hallelujah make me a
[1:45:03] receptacle you want a scriptural proof

[1:54:14] my heart
[1:54:16] as I was just singing that first verse
[1:54:18] it's just struck me I had this quote
[1:54:21] here in my nose the prophet said
[1:54:22] speaking of why it had to be Shepherd
[1:54:24] she said yet all the he said he said all
[1:54:27] the learning they had spent all the
[1:54:29] missionaries and all the prosely all the
[1:54:31] membership everything they had though
[1:54:32] they hadn't done to honor God he said
[1:54:35] yet the key message of all of it was
[1:54:37] bypassed from them
[1:54:38] he said all the Nobles that were
[1:54:40] decorated with great doctors at the
[1:54:42] vanity psychology highly education great
[1:54:45] Cathedrals and things it was all
[1:54:47] bypassed and revealed to nobodies
[1:54:51] foreign
[1:54:51] the wisdom the infinite wisdom of
[1:54:54] almighty God did it to make known to
[1:54:56] them the greatest message ever was the
[1:54:57] Messiah is now on Earth could only come
[1:55:00] from God who knows wisdom all the wisdom
[1:55:02] all the schooling everything was now
[1:55:05] listen this was now laid to waste
[1:55:08] and bypassed by the great wisdom of God
[1:55:11] he said I keep repeating that because I
[1:55:13] wanted to go down deep all laid the
[1:55:15] waste it was of no good bypassed it all
[1:55:17] to let God's wisdom have the right of
[1:55:19] way the god that takes nothing to make
[1:55:22] somethings
[1:55:24] bet you this morning amen amen I was in
[1:55:27] nothing but God took nothing and made
[1:55:30] something
[1:55:31] you say what did he make he made a son
[1:55:33] of God
[1:55:34] he made a believer
[1:55:35] he made an overcomer
[1:55:38] he made a conqueror
[1:55:40] what about you this morning
[1:55:41] he took a nobody
[1:55:43] and made something out of you I believe
[1:55:46] this morning there's a possibility that
[1:55:47] God
[1:55:48] can take nobody's right here this
[1:55:50] morning
