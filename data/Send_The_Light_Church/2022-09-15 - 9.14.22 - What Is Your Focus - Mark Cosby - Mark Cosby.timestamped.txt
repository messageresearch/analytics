[35:30] reveal your word lord
[35:32] any man can turn back these pages but
[35:35] only you
[35:36] can bring the words to life lord
[35:38] i pray lord you move me so plum out the
[35:40] way lord
[35:41] that you they would just hear you and
[35:43] only you lord i just want to be uh just
[35:46] a mouthpiece for you to use lord
[35:48] and i pray you just bless each person
[35:51] that's here tonight lord bless each
[35:52] person in the live stream i pray to
[35:54] soften our hearts lord let us just
[35:56] hearken unto what you would say lord and
[35:58] let us be obedient to all your word lord
[36:00] not just some but all lord
[36:02] and lord we pray that you just have the
[36:04] preeminence lord
[36:06] from the start of this service to the
[36:07] end lord we ask all these things
[36:10] in jesus christ then we pray amen
[36:12] may we turn to philippians chapter three
[36:16] and read verses 10 through 16.
[36:26] say amen when you get there
[36:29] so start with verse 10 that i may know
[36:32] him
[36:33] and the power of his resurrection and
[36:35] the fellowship of his sufferings
[36:38] being made conformable unto his death
[36:42] if by any means i might attain unto the
[36:44] resurrection of the dead
[36:47] not as though i had already attained
[36:49] either already perfect but i follow
[36:52] after if they may apprehend that which
[36:54] also i am apprehended of christ jesus
[36:57] brethren i count that myself to have
[36:59] apprehended but there's one thing i do
[37:02] forgetting those things which are behind
[37:04] and reaching forth unto those things
[37:05] which are before
[37:07] verse 14
[37:08] i press toward the mark of the prize of
[37:10] the high calling of god in christ jesus
[37:13] let us therefore as many as be perfect
[37:15] be thus minded
[37:17] and if anything you be otherwise minded
[37:19] god shall reveal even this unto you
[37:22] nevertheless
[37:23] we're to we have already attained let us
[37:25] walk by the same rule let us mind the
[37:27] same thing god bless you guys may be
[37:29] seated
[37:30] so the title of our little sermon today
[37:32] is what is your
[37:34] focus so a lot of things that we could
[37:37] uh get distracted on could be when
[37:39] you're trying to focus on something and
[37:40] you're narrowing like if i'm looking at
[37:41] this clock i'm trying to focus on what
[37:43] time it is so if i'm trying to look at
[37:45] small print i'm trying to really focus
[37:47] on it so a lot of times our focus can
[37:49] get away from god but we can still be
[37:52] serving god reading the word praying but
[37:54] we lost our focus we lost our vision
[37:56] that god has given us
[37:58] so
[37:59] uh we'll go to philippians 2. uh
[38:01] actually before we go there there's
[38:02] something uh you notice what paul said
[38:04] apprehended so when you apprehend
[38:05] something you're pretty much like
[38:07] grasping something you're taking a hold
[38:08] of something see your walk with christ
[38:11] you got to take it by force because the
[38:13] devil is going to give you every excuse
[38:15] to just give him the bare minimum god
[38:17] just doesn't want your bare minimum but
[38:19] he wants all of you if you get if you're
[38:21] if you're marrying somebody you want
[38:23] that person to have all of you not just
[38:24] some of you so christ is coming to marry
[38:27] the bride
[38:29] and he wants all the bride because the
[38:31] bride's gonna make herself ready the
[38:33] bride's gonna be without spot or wrinkle
[38:35] and that just doesn't happen when he
[38:36] comes but that process is happening
[38:38] right now
[38:39] the shaping the molding process is
[38:41] happening right now this very moment so
[38:43] each decision that you make is either
[38:45] going to take you away from that or draw
[38:47] you towards that so your decisions are
[38:49] important each decision that you make
[38:52] so let's go to philippians 2 like i said
[38:53] before me verses one through eight
[38:55] probably very familiar scriptures we
[38:57] kind of want to really take our time and
[38:59] break it down
[39:00] if there be therefore any constellation
[39:03] in christ so look that word of
[39:05] constellation so it's comfort
[39:09] aviation of misery or distress of mind
[39:11] refreshment of mind or spirits
[39:14] a comparative degree of happiness in
[39:16] distress or misfortune springing up from
[39:19] any circumstances that abates the evil
[39:22] or supports and strengthens the mind as
[39:24] hope joy and courage and like so if any
[39:27] comfort of love if any fellowship of
[39:29] spirit if any bowels of mercies
[39:32] verse two fulfill ye my joy that you be
[39:35] like-minded having the same love being
[39:38] of one accord of one mind
[39:40] let nothing be done through strife or
[39:44] vainglory but in lowliness of mind let
[39:46] each esteem others better than
[39:48] themselves so look the word up lowliness
[39:51] is freedom
[39:52] from pride
[39:54] humility humbleness of mind
[39:57] so i look the word up strife as well
[39:59] excursion or contention for superiority
[40:02] contest of emulation either by
[40:05] intellectual or physical effort strife
[40:07] may be carried between students or
[40:09] between mechanics so we're not trying to
[40:11] fight each other we're not trying to get
[40:13] each other's strife we're here to walk
[40:14] together
[40:16] see this walk you're not i'm not walking
[40:17] against you i'm not running against you
[40:18] i'm not fighting against you but i'm
[40:20] fighting alongside you this is a battle
[40:22] we need one another and we got to lift
[40:24] one another up and build one another and
[40:26] that takes effort yes that takes
[40:30] crucifying the flesh because your
[40:32] natural human nature doesn't want to
[40:34] necessarily work together that's right
[40:36] teamwork is something has to be built
[40:38] you look at the sports team
[40:39] basketball football whatever hockey you
[40:41] take it all the same thing
[40:43] you need to build chemistry
[40:45] and that team they can have all the best
[40:47] superstars in the world but if they
[40:49] don't have chemistry they're going to do
[40:51] horrible
[40:53] just on paper doesn't do good they have
[40:54] to build it it takes time takes
[40:56] discipline it takes effort so with the
[40:58] body of christ if we want to be a
[41:00] well-working oil machine we got to work
[41:02] together we got to pray together we got
[41:04] to cry together we got to rejoice
[41:06] together
[41:07] that's what god just didn't die for us
[41:09] to be all over hearing you over there
[41:11] and over there but he died that we could
[41:13] be a functioning body if i don't have my
[41:14] left arm
[41:16] i'm lacking something if i'm missing
[41:18] fingers i'm going to be handicapped
[41:20] right
[41:21] right
[41:22] so we need all we need one another let's
[41:24] go to verse verse 3 again let nothing be
[41:27] done through strife or vain glory but in
[41:29] lowliness of mind let each esteem utter
[41:32] other better than themselves
[41:34] so it's not all about me it's about me
[41:36] lifting somebody else up that's the
[41:38] reward see christ didn't come on this
[41:41] earth to just say i'm the son of god
[41:44] listen to me but he became a servant as
[41:46] we read further down in here see he
[41:48] didn't have to say everywhere he went
[41:50] that he was the son of god his life
[41:51] proved what he was and our life needs to
[41:54] prove what we are so if we claim to be
[41:56] christians you don't have to say it to
[41:58] every person you walk by but your life
[42:00] the way you act the way you think the
[42:02] way you talk the way you live is going
[42:04] to prove what you really are amen praise
[42:07] god let's keep going so looking at every
[42:10] man on his own things but every man also
[42:12] in the things of others so there's five
[42:14] love verse five let this mind be in you
[42:17] which was also in christ jesus so every
[42:19] day i do not wake up with the mind of
[42:21] christ can i get an amen amen i have to
[42:24] strive to have the mind of christ it's a
[42:27] gift but you have to fight for that gift
[42:30] it's something that he doesn't say here
[42:32] you can have it today because your name
[42:33] is mark cosby
[42:34] no it's something i have to strive for
[42:36] because my carnal flesh does not want to
[42:39] serve god and if it does it wants to
[42:41] give god the bare minimum mediocre
[42:43] mediocracy
[42:45] and so this mind is something that we
[42:47] need
[42:48] every day
[42:49] we can't take it or leave it but if
[42:51] something says let this mind be in you
[42:52] which is also in christ jesus so if you
[42:54] want to do these things the bible says
[42:57] doing everything without strife and vain
[42:58] glory and loneliness of mine you need
[43:00] the mind of christ
[43:01] otherwise it can't be done so go to
[43:03] verse six who being in the form of god
[43:05] thought it not robberly to be equal with
[43:07] god verse seven but made himself of no
[43:09] reputation house human beings we like to
[43:13] we may not save we like to look good
[43:15] sometimes
[43:16] fancy cars fancy houses and we try to we
[43:19] want to get the approval for others
[43:21] right it says human nature
[43:23] but christ came he knew where he came
[43:25] from he knew he was on the throne of he
[43:28] knew he knew he was deity he knew all
[43:30] these things he knew he was holy but he
[43:32] didn't
[43:33] boast about it it says right here but he
[43:35] made himself of no reputation what took
[43:38] upon him the form of a servant and was
[43:41] made in the likeness of men
[43:43] so if he's our perfect example then we
[43:46] need to serve others we need to be
[43:48] servants that's what he's calling us to
[43:50] that's the whole plan of god
[43:53] we need to serve one another that's how
[43:56] you show somebody christ by living for
[43:58] them
[44:00] verse eight and being found in the
[44:02] fashion as a man he humbled himself if
[44:05] you don't know what if you want to know
[44:06] what true humility is look at the life
[44:08] of jesus christ in the word of god it's
[44:11] going to show you what humility really
[44:13] is i don't want just some definition i
[44:15] think what it is what the dictionary
[44:17] gives me but i want to look at the life
[44:18] of christ because that's what humility
[44:20] was he was he's the very definition of
[44:23] humility in my eyes
[44:25] and so he humbled himself and became
[44:27] obedient unto the death even the death
[44:29] of the cross
[44:31] our focus needs to be on what god is
[44:33] trying to do in our life right now it's
[44:36] wonderful to thank the lord for all the
[44:37] things he has done for your life in the
[44:39] past praise god
[44:41] but let's not just live in the past he
[44:43] wants to he wants to give you
[44:45] testimonies today right now of what he's
[44:47] doing in your life right now because
[44:49] says jesus christ the same yesterday
[44:52] today and forever so what is christ
[44:54] trying to do your life right now today
[44:56] that's that's what you have to wait to
[44:57] seek that personally that's something
[44:59] the pastor can't do for you i can't do
[45:01] for you sister ann can't do for you but
[45:03] you have to seek it personally for your
[45:05] life he wants to give you a vision
[45:08] but a vision has to get to seek after a
[45:10] vision a vision just doesn't fall into
[45:12] your lap
[45:14] praise god so
[45:16] working him seeing things not just so we
[45:18] can have testimonies that i woke up this
[45:19] morning let's praise god but how is your
[45:21] nature changing
[45:23] what is god trying to fix in your life
[45:26] because there's things we have bad
[45:27] habits
[45:28] things we need to add in our life but if
[45:30] we're not seeking after those things it
[45:32] is good the things that you're doing
[45:34] good right now but god is looking for
[45:36] the things that we're not doing right
[45:37] now that's what's going to change us and
[45:38] mold us because it's good i can say i'm
[45:41] good at doing this but if i'm failing at
[45:43] all these other areas that one good
[45:45] thing isn't going to outweigh all the
[45:46] bad things right
[45:49] so let's keep going so i like the word
[45:51] up focus it's a central point of
[45:53] concentration
[45:55] so if i'm focusing on something if i'm
[45:56] looking at this door i'm looking just at
[45:58] the door and nothing else i'm focusing
[46:00] so that's how our walk with god is it's
[46:02] a straight and narrow we can't be
[46:04] looking to the left and to the right at
[46:05] all these this pleasurable things we got
[46:07] to keep focused
[46:09] focused when the doctor the eye doctor
[46:11] asks you to focus on these letters
[46:12] you're really trying to focus on those
[46:14] letters and if you can't see them then
[46:17] it's going to be corrected with glasses
[46:19] so sometimes god has to correct our
[46:21] focus
[46:22] by chastising us
[46:24] us making a mistake some sometimes a lot
[46:27] of times god will let you make a mistake
[46:29] because he's trying to talk to you but
[46:32] you're not listening so he'll let you
[46:33] make that mistake and he's a gracious
[46:35] father and he's going to help you learn
[46:37] from that mistake but the thing is he
[46:39] can't force you to learn from that
[46:40] mistake you have to make the what the
[46:42] decision
[46:43] see this whole life is about decision
[46:46] this whole life is about change either
[46:48] you're going to change for the good or
[46:49] change for the bad it's no middle water
[46:52] so think about each decision you make
[46:53] you're going to change either for the
[46:54] good or the bad and even a good decision
[46:58] can have uh
[47:00] certain consequences others might leave
[47:02] you your family might disown you
[47:04] whatever it is but if you're if you're
[47:06] living for the gospel of jesus christ
[47:09] and suffering for him that he's gonna
[47:10] bless you
[47:11] he's gonna bless you with more parents
[47:13] amen he is i have many moms and many
[47:16] dads you know brother john sister one of
[47:18] my
[47:19] dads and moms so he'll bless you
[47:23] so a focal point i like the word a focal
[47:25] point the point at which elements are
[47:27] aspects coverage the center of activity
[47:29] or intention so christ wants to be the
[47:31] center of your life
[47:33] he wants to be the main principal point
[47:36] of focusing your life and if he becomes
[47:39] that then all things are going to line
[47:41] in place will you have hardships and
[47:43] trials yes those that live godly will
[47:45] suffer persecution but those trials are
[47:48] meant to build you
[47:49] to give you more of the character of god
[47:52] to make you more in his image
[47:54] and there's a lot of things we we may
[47:56] not understand but just take him at his
[47:58] word he doesn't he said if thou cannot
[48:00] believe not if thou cannot understand
[48:03] a lot of times human beings we want to
[48:05] understand everything we want everything
[48:07] laid out like gps like i gotta make this
[48:10] left turn here make this right turn here
[48:11] sometimes god is only gonna light a
[48:13] couple steps ahead and you gotta trust
[48:15] him abraham he didn't know where he was
[48:17] going but he took god at his word
[48:20] and look where he led him
[48:23] he's the father of our faith now because
[48:25] what he took god at his word
[48:27] so
[48:28] he he could have had all the excuses in
[48:30] the world he never heard
[48:31] god speak to him before the first time
[48:32] ever but we have examples
[48:35] all around us of god working in others
[48:37] lives abraham didn't have that so we
[48:39] need to have the faith of abraham just
[48:41] because you don't understand something
[48:42] doesn't mean god isn't leading you
[48:45] so paul i look paul he was always
[48:48] focused on his high calling he even told
[48:50] us to press towards the mark of the high
[48:52] calling of god in christ jesus
[48:54] he was focused on he was focused on
[48:56] getting to know the lord in a personal
[48:58] and intimate way even after 30 plus
[49:01] years of serving them he said oh that i
[49:03] may know him
[49:04] we we need that kind of desperation paul
[49:06] didn't say well lord i've known you for
[49:08] 30 years i've known enough but he was as
[49:10] is a new babe in christ he wanted to
[49:12] know him just as much as he wanted to
[49:14] know him when he first got to know him
[49:15] if that made any sense
[49:17] so the thing is if you want to know him
[49:19] he said i love i'll read one more time
[49:20] philippians 3 10 that may know him and
[49:23] the power of his resurrection and the
[49:25] fellowship of his sufferings being made
[49:28] conformed to his death so it's going to
[49:30] take suffering to know him amen
[49:33] christ had to suffer to fulfill god's
[49:35] will so if he had to suffer to do that
[49:37] we have to suffer to know him as well
[49:40] so it's no excuses we can say
[49:44] so he
[49:45] he recognized see paul had recognized
[49:47] who he was in lord jesus christ he
[49:49] recognized he must be submitted to the
[49:52] lord daily
[49:53] and he was focused on working for the
[49:55] lord he was a servant
[49:57] he didn't care what he had to do to
[49:59] serve god he got stoned shipwrecked he
[50:01] didn't care jailed he didn't care what
[50:03] he had to do
[50:06] when i think of focus in order to focus
[50:08] on the lord you must constantly have a
[50:10] spiritual vision for your life because
[50:13] how many times people have a a vision to
[50:15] grow their business
[50:17] to to have an uh to work out to build
[50:20] muscle see those visions they can be
[50:22] good things but they can be distracting
[50:24] because they're carnal see carnal
[50:26] visions they're going to pass away
[50:29] but a vision from the lord isn't going
[50:30] to pass away because that vision is
[50:32] going to constantly keep him before you
[50:34] if that vision doesn't then there's
[50:36] something wrong with that vision because
[50:38] a vision a true spiritual vision
[50:40] shouldn't distract you from the lord in
[50:42] fact it should keep you on that straight
[50:43] and narrow
[50:44] and that vision will go to proverbs 29
[50:46] 18.
[50:57] so proverbs 29 18 probably very familiar
[51:00] scripture where there is no vision that
[51:02] people perish so if we don't have a
[51:05] vision then we're walking around
[51:07] aimlessly and you could be reading the
[51:09] word and praying every day but god is
[51:11] wanting to give us a vision
[51:13] he wants to give us an expected end he
[51:16] promised that but if you can't catch and
[51:18] be connected with him how can he give
[51:20] you that vision anything a vision you
[51:22] have to seek after a vision
[51:24] it's not something a pastor can
[51:25] necessarily give you that's something
[51:27] that i could give you
[51:29] don't just do things because i say it
[51:31] but do it because you love the lord
[51:34] so the thing is we don't want to walk
[51:36] around aimless like i said before and
[51:37] i've been there it's not fun because you
[51:40] could be doing all these things
[51:42] all these other people churches
[51:44] catholics you know bath that is baptist
[51:47] methodists
[51:48] they they are technically serving the
[51:50] lord
[51:51] but they get caught up in
[51:53] dogmas they get caught up in creeds
[51:56] and yeah they're even in pro matthew 7
[51:58] it says many will come to me today they
[52:00] say lord lord lord they're not cast out
[52:02] devils and he'll sick in your name and
[52:04] these people weren't atheists they
[52:07] weren't devil worshipers but they were
[52:09] going to church every wednesday and
[52:10] sunday they were giving offerings and
[52:13] ties but the thing is what jesus said is
[52:16] i did not know you workers of iniquity
[52:18] so god had called them to a personal
[52:21] walk a fully surrendered life where they
[52:23] thought they could just do what they
[52:25] wanted to do they could take the word
[52:27] they wanted to take so the thing is we
[52:28] can't take
[52:30] what we want in the word we need all the
[52:31] word if i'm at a buffet i can pick and
[52:33] choose but we need to rake all the word
[52:36] in we need to gather it because god is a
[52:39] god of all his word not just
[52:40] partialities
[52:42] because if not then he would he would
[52:44] have to forgive eve he would he would
[52:46] have to say eve you were right but no he
[52:48] couldn't but he
[52:50] god is his word lying upon line priest
[52:52] upon priesthood
[52:54] he is forever settled in heaven so he
[52:56] can't go back on it it's forever god is
[52:59] his word just like as i give my word to
[53:00] somebody
[53:01] and i don't do something i say i'm going
[53:03] to do
[53:04] then there's going to be consequences
[53:05] for that but god
[53:07] he can't he's
[53:09] his word
[53:10] so i got a quote to read and i think
[53:13] it's just about where the churches are
[53:14] getting we're the children of god but
[53:16] we're losing our inheritance by our
[53:18] conduct
[53:19] the things that we do and the things
[53:21] that we permit to be done
[53:23] and the way that we live and act and so
[53:24] forth we're living millions of miles
[53:26] below our privilege and i believe we're
[53:28] doing that because we lose sight of the
[53:30] vision we lose sight of our focus of who
[53:32] we are we forget who we are in this word
[53:35] what god is calling us to be
[53:38] am i right yes
[53:39] praise god it says we're living millions
[53:41] of miles below our privilege we should
[53:43] be living a victorious life every day
[53:46] there's no excuse why we can't if jesus
[53:48] has overcome
[53:50] hell death and the grave then what
[53:52] excuse did we have he even said all
[53:54] power is given unto me in heaven and in
[53:56] earth so there's no demon no sickness no
[53:59] devil that can stop you if you're fully
[54:01] submitted to jesus christ now it can
[54:04] stop you if you're not but if you're
[54:06] fully submitted there's no devil in hell
[54:08] that could stop you there's no addiction
[54:10] there's no habit that can stop you if
[54:12] you're fully surrendered to him on a
[54:14] daily basis
[54:16] and he's called us to be overcomers and
[54:17] i said this statement many times i'll
[54:19] say it again it's not necessarily you
[54:21] overcoming yourself but it's you letting
[54:23] the overcomer overcome inside of you
[54:26] because the children of israel when they
[54:28] saw those giants they said we're
[54:29] grasshoppers but joshua and caleb saw
[54:32] the giants and knew that their god could
[54:34] conquer those giants
[54:36] they didn't know how but they saw
[54:38] god move they saw the the the
[54:41] testimonies they had of getting fed
[54:43] bread
[54:44] of the egyptians being drowned the
[54:46] plagues they saw those things they said
[54:48] there's different spirit in them
[54:50] i believe there's different spirit than
[54:52] us let's take let's be joshua and
[54:54] caleb's i believe there's still joshua
[54:56] and caleb's today that take god at his
[54:58] word no matter the circumstance
[55:01] that's where i'm at
[55:03] uh and then someone see the work of god
[55:05] being done and dr so-and-so and dr jones
[55:07] say is this and the other doctor says
[55:09] it's this and we believe it instead of
[55:10] looking into the word the word verifies
[55:14] it that what's sheep food it comes out
[55:16] of the word so that's all we need is the
[55:19] word i don't care what dr so-and-so said
[55:21] if he's doubting the word
[55:23] god says this
[55:25] i don't know what you say but god says
[55:26] this my god doesn't say that what you're
[55:29] saying but my god says this you gotta
[55:31] take god at his word if you don't have
[55:33] faith you can't have a walk with god
[55:35] faith is one of the triangle but faith
[55:37] is the foundation of your walk if you
[55:39] have no faith then you can have no walk
[55:42] it's impossible amen
[55:44] even says without it even says in the
[55:45] word it's impossible to please god
[55:47] without faith
[55:49] that's a requirement see we got to get
[55:51] ourselves focused
[55:53] to whether we live or die sink or drown
[55:56] it's calvary christ that's the thing god
[55:59] wants us to come back to
[56:01] we got to remember where you came from
[56:03] you got to remember what he did for you
[56:05] it's not something he wants you to
[56:06] forget if you forget calvary
[56:09] then you you lose your strength because
[56:11] that's where your strength came from if
[56:13] he didn't die upon calvary and resurrect
[56:15] we couldn't have we couldn't be here
[56:16] today
[56:20] a lot of times see we you have to
[56:22] conform to the word the word the word
[56:24] doesn't conform to your life but you
[56:26] have to conform to the word
[56:28] that's how god works he wants he's the
[56:30] one who's going to shape and mold you
[56:32] you're not shaping him over to him he's
[56:34] perfect
[56:35] so we must submit to the word
[56:38] daily do not think that the word is
[56:40] going to submit to your selfish needs
[56:42] and desires it's not god doesn't work
[56:44] that way
[56:45] he'll knock at the door of your heart as
[56:47] in that picture right there
[56:48] but you have to let him in
[56:51] that's a requirement see that
[56:53] don't think the word is going to submit
[56:54] to you it's not going to conform to your
[56:56] busy schedule sometimes we get so busy
[56:59] that we lose sight
[57:00] of who we are we lose sight of why we're
[57:03] on this earth we're not on this earth
[57:05] this to work
[57:06] pay bills and die
[57:08] we're not a lot of people have that
[57:10] philosophy that i'm working my pay bills
[57:12] and my kids are going to do that and no
[57:14] no
[57:15] we can live a joyous life you can have
[57:17] nice things i'm not saying you can't
[57:19] have nice things you got to live like a
[57:21] poor man i'm not saying that at all what
[57:22] i'm saying is don't let those things get
[57:25] in the way of your walk don't let them
[57:26] become an idol in your life because
[57:28] anything you put before god is an idol
[57:30] your car can mean idol your your family
[57:33] your wife your girlfriend they can be an
[57:35] idol in your life but the thing is you
[57:37] have to put things in a proper place
[57:40] let's go to romans 8 29.
[57:44] so what a statement i just said you have
[57:46] to conform to the word and look look
[57:49] what uh he's calling us in romans 8 29 i
[57:51] think we read that scripture actually
[57:55] oh wrong way
[57:58] praise god
[58:00] i love the word
[58:02] so 8 29
[58:05] so it says for whom he did for know he
[58:08] also did predestinate to what to be
[58:10] conformed to the image of his son so
[58:13] right there the word is telling me that
[58:14] i'm supposed to be conformed to him not
[58:17] the work not the the word conformed to
[58:19] my my life but i got to be conformed to
[58:21] his image
[58:23] to the image of his son that he might be
[58:25] the first
[58:27] among many brethren
[58:28] i i just love that
[58:31] because i'm supposed to be like him not
[58:32] he like me
[58:34] he became like me in the likeness of
[58:36] sinful flesh that he could come like him
[58:38] that's the whole motive why he did that
[58:40] so i'm gonna be just like him but the
[58:42] just like him part doesn't start at that
[58:45] moment but it starts right now when you
[58:47] give your heart to god that's when it's
[58:48] starting that process is just starting
[58:51] and until until you're called on this
[58:52] earth before he comes that's when it's
[58:54] over but until then we got so much work
[58:56] to do
[58:57] i know there's so many flaws and so many
[58:59] things in my life that i need to work on
[59:02] praise god that he's gracious and
[59:03] merciful
[59:04] to help me with those
[59:07] so that needs to be our focal point that
[59:09] image being conformed to this image in
[59:11] order for that to happen you have to
[59:12] worry about the thing is the most
[59:14] important thing is you can take care of
[59:15] this fleshly body all you want to you
[59:18] can eat healthy i'm not advocating not
[59:20] to eat healthy please don't give me that
[59:21] one thing is don't focus so much
[59:24] on the outward shell
[59:26] the inward shell was so much more
[59:28] important
[59:30] because if we're not focused on the
[59:31] inward man
[59:33] then the outward man is gonna perish as
[59:36] well
[59:36] see because our soul
[59:38] when god died for you he didn't die
[59:40] for these pest houses but he died for
[59:43] what's inside of there
[59:45] that soul and he in fact he's promised
[59:47] to give you a new body a glory like in
[59:50] his image
[59:52] but but the thing is still take care of
[59:54] your body because the thing is
[59:56] god is loaning this to you
[59:58] and you have to take care of your body
[1:00:00] the things you eat the things you put
[1:00:01] into your body take care of your body
[1:00:05] advocate that
[1:00:07] praise god
[1:00:09] this needs to be our focal point because
[1:00:10] if that's not our true focal point then
[1:00:12] we're gonna we're not gonna fall on his
[1:00:14] example
[1:00:15] and guess what guess what he was guess
[1:00:17] what jesus was a servant
[1:00:20] the very god of heaven was a servant
[1:00:22] he served others
[1:00:24] he got he was willing to get dirty he
[1:00:26] washed other's feet he was willing to be
[1:00:29] about the father's business
[1:00:32] amen no matter what no matter how how he
[1:00:36] felt no matter how sick he felt no
[1:00:37] matter how many people uh he healed he
[1:00:40] didn't care he was still always about
[1:00:42] the father's business
[1:00:45] and was willing to help he's also
[1:00:46] willing to help build others
[1:00:48] even hurting them necessarily they could
[1:00:50] hurt their car like when peter he
[1:00:51] rebuked peter
[1:00:53] but he did it because he wanted to show
[1:00:55] peter to build peter
[1:00:57] see god doesn't do things just to do
[1:00:58] things he does it with a perfect purpose
[1:01:01] and his intent is to build you up to to
[1:01:04] call you higher
[1:01:07] in first john 1 14. and the word was
[1:01:10] made flesh
[1:01:12] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[1:01:14] glory in the glory as the only begotten
[1:01:16] of the father
[1:01:18] full of grace and truth
[1:01:20] so we can't separate god in his word
[1:01:22] they're one and the same
[1:01:24] so you can't have god without his word
[1:01:26] you can't have the word without god
[1:01:28] and a question i'm gonna pose to you
[1:01:30] guys please don't answer this but answer
[1:01:31] within yourselves who and what is your
[1:01:33] focus on
[1:01:35] there's only two things you can focus on
[1:01:37] either god's will or your will self-will
[1:01:40] and we all know self-will is satan's
[1:01:43] will
[1:01:44] i'm not gonna i'm not gonna sugarcoat
[1:01:46] i'm gonna just put it right blank are we
[1:01:48] trying to build a kingdom down here a
[1:01:51] earthly fleshly kingdom
[1:01:52] or we laying up treasure in heaven
[1:01:55] because like i said it is good to focus
[1:01:57] on retirement
[1:01:58] but that the only thing i'm not here to
[1:02:00] retire to live here the rest of my life
[1:02:02] i'm here to go in the glory i don't know
[1:02:04] about you guys but that's where i'm
[1:02:05] going
[1:02:06] so don't get so caught up in trying to
[1:02:08] build a life down here that you forget
[1:02:10] where you're here because when you do
[1:02:12] that you forget who you are in the word
[1:02:15] the word is calling like i said the word
[1:02:16] is calling to be in his image to be
[1:02:18] overcomers don't let these things in
[1:02:21] your life hinder you giants and
[1:02:23] financial issues he promised to take
[1:02:25] care of your knees just seek his kingdom
[1:02:27] let's go to matthew 6 with me
[1:02:31] so matthew 6 19-24
[1:02:36] very familiar scriptures
[1:02:39] so it says
[1:02:40] lay that up for yourselves treasures
[1:02:42] upon earth he's telling us right now
[1:02:44] where moth and rusted corrupt and where
[1:02:47] thieves break through and steal
[1:02:49] but lay up for yourselves treasures in
[1:02:52] heaven or neither moth nor rust of
[1:02:54] corrupt where thieves do not break
[1:02:57] through nor steal
[1:02:58] for where your treasure is there will
[1:03:00] your heart be also
[1:03:02] for where your treasure is there will
[1:03:04] your heart be also
[1:03:06] so whatever your bulk of majority of
[1:03:08] your time is wherever you're putting
[1:03:09] your energy and effort into that's where
[1:03:12] your heart's going to be if it's not in
[1:03:14] the things of god and there's going to
[1:03:15] be the things of the world
[1:03:17] and that's how you get distracted that's
[1:03:18] how satan gets you to get you so busy
[1:03:21] that you forget
[1:03:23] about christ and you may not necessarily
[1:03:25] forget about them intellectually but
[1:03:27] here you forget about them because if
[1:03:29] you're not growing here you become
[1:03:30] spiritually malnourished if i don't eat
[1:03:33] in the physical
[1:03:34] realm then i become malnourished if i'm
[1:03:37] not feeding on the spiritual realm i
[1:03:38] become malnourished
[1:03:40] and i don't want to be spiritually
[1:03:41] malnourished because i become
[1:03:42] spiritually malnourished then i can't be
[1:03:44] a soldier i can't be a proper soldier
[1:03:47] in god's army
[1:03:49] and then the satan's gonna say he's
[1:03:50] gonna have a field day with you if
[1:03:51] you're not prayed up if you're not in
[1:03:53] the word if you're not seeking god and
[1:03:55] submitted he's gonna have a field day
[1:03:57] with you
[1:03:58] and you can do nothing about it because
[1:04:00] you are powerless against satan yourself
[1:04:03] but when you get connected see if i
[1:04:05] unplug
[1:04:06] that tv
[1:04:08] it can't turn on but when i plug it up
[1:04:10] it has power so when i'm plugged in the
[1:04:12] word of god and in prayer then i have
[1:04:14] power
[1:04:15] it's not my power but it's his power
[1:04:17] he's given me and i'm responsible in how
[1:04:19] i use that power
[1:04:22] because he's given us authority but we
[1:04:24] don't want to misuse that authority see
[1:04:26] a policeman he's given authority but he
[1:04:29] has a decision either to use the
[1:04:31] authority properly or misuse the
[1:04:33] authority properly and i don't want to
[1:04:34] be guilty of misusing what god has given
[1:04:37] me because i'm going to be judged on how
[1:04:39] i use the gifts he's given me uh and
[1:04:42] many other things just gifts isn't just
[1:04:43] a gift of singing and gifts are so many
[1:04:45] things you can
[1:04:47] you have a gift of helps you can have a
[1:04:49] gift of being a people person just be
[1:04:51] able to talk to anybody anytime anywhere
[1:04:53] see there's so many gifts we don't look
[1:04:55] at
[1:04:56] and god the thing is you once you
[1:04:57] recognize the gift that you have you
[1:04:59] give it back to god and let him use it
[1:05:01] through you okay that's that's what the
[1:05:03] whole point of a gift is there's talents
[1:05:05] if jesus told us about and this one man
[1:05:08] he hid his talent and didn't even use it
[1:05:10] and he was he was held responsible for
[1:05:12] that so i don't want to be held
[1:05:14] responsible for not using my gift the
[1:05:16] way he wanted me to use it
[1:05:18] praise god
[1:05:19] i forgot where i was
[1:05:21] um verse 23
[1:05:23] verse 22 the light of the body is the
[1:05:25] eye if therefore thy eye be single that
[1:05:28] whole body should be full of light
[1:05:30] but if the eye be evil that whole body
[1:05:32] shall be full of darkness if therefore
[1:05:34] the light that is in me be darkness how
[1:05:36] great is that darkness so verse 24
[1:05:38] no man can serve two masters so you
[1:05:41] cannot try to serve god and have one
[1:05:44] foot out in the world you cannot do that
[1:05:47] it will make you sick it will not profit
[1:05:49] you and you be considered a hypocrite
[1:05:53] free that you will hate the you eat for
[1:05:54] either you hate the one and love the
[1:05:56] other or else you will hold to the one
[1:05:57] who despise the other even jesus told us
[1:06:00] you cannot serve god and mammon you can
[1:06:03] so make your choice today serve god with
[1:06:05] all your heart not partialities not 99
[1:06:08] but give them 100 of your life every
[1:06:10] single day
[1:06:14] praise god
[1:06:15] there are many distractions in this
[1:06:17] layout to see in age this is the age of
[1:06:19] distractions you have
[1:06:21] technology you have internet you have
[1:06:23] smartphones you have the iphone 14 15
[1:06:26] coming out next year you have all these
[1:06:27] things samsung galaxies all these things
[1:06:30] that
[1:06:30] can be blessings but also be cursings
[1:06:33] because the devil can use him to take
[1:06:35] your time away
[1:06:36] get all these tv shows on tv i'm not
[1:06:38] saying you can't watch shows or anything
[1:06:40] but don't let them
[1:06:42] distract you
[1:06:43] from what you're here for
[1:06:45] see jesus called us to be overcomers and
[1:06:48] your biggest distraction is your flesh
[1:06:51] it's the only thing that will keep you
[1:06:53] from a closer walk with god and keep you
[1:06:55] from finding your purpose here on earth
[1:06:58] so your biggest enemy is yourself my
[1:07:00] biggest enemy is mark cosby he's the
[1:07:02] only person that's going to stop
[1:07:04] him from walking with god not not not
[1:07:07] communism not the government not
[1:07:09] politics they're not going to stop you
[1:07:11] from walking with god but you yourself
[1:07:13] are going to stop you walking from god
[1:07:15] that's why jesus told us to crucify your
[1:07:17] flesh daily
[1:07:19] and then you pick up your cross
[1:07:22] you have to crucify daily otherwise
[1:07:24] you'll get distracted
[1:07:27] now notice you have to make the choice
[1:07:29] you have to make the choice to fight and
[1:07:31] to keep fighting the choice to overcome
[1:07:32] that distraction this is not just
[1:07:34] something that
[1:07:35] you serve the lord for 20 years and you
[1:07:37] have to crucify anymore no
[1:07:39] in fact your flesh is going to want to
[1:07:41] distract you more and more and more
[1:07:43] because because as you grow in the lord
[1:07:46] much is given much is required so a lot
[1:07:48] of times
[1:07:50] like people at work or whatever you know
[1:07:51] you do this job for 20 years and kind of
[1:07:53] like you know they lack they don't do as
[1:07:55] much as they used to do when you're
[1:07:57] walking with god you can't do that in
[1:07:59] fact when you're working for 20 years
[1:08:01] you should still be giving your best how
[1:08:03] you do anything is how you do everything
[1:08:04] i love that quote do everything as you
[1:08:06] do unto the lord that's how i live my
[1:08:09] life everything i'm doing whether it's
[1:08:10] cleaning the toilet at my house i'm
[1:08:12] gonna do with the best of my ability as
[1:08:13] i'm doing it to the lord and i believe
[1:08:15] if we have that type of attitude we
[1:08:16] wouldn't cut corners on things it
[1:08:18] wouldn't be lazy and thoughtful in
[1:08:20] things
[1:08:21] be disciplined in your prayer life
[1:08:23] reading the word of god your work
[1:08:25] whatever you're doing at home be
[1:08:27] disciplined the more areas you can be
[1:08:29] disciplined in the less chance of
[1:08:30] likelihood you'll be lazy in other areas
[1:08:33] discipline is key the word disciple has
[1:08:36] discipline in it so the disciples were
[1:08:38] what discipline
[1:08:40] they had to crucify daily they had
[1:08:42] desires like you did dreams like we do
[1:08:45] goals like we do they had all these
[1:08:46] things but they had to cut certain
[1:08:49] things out that weren't pleasing unto
[1:08:50] the lord they were human beings just
[1:08:53] like you and i the bible may not have
[1:08:55] said you know say everything that they
[1:08:57] they thought in their heads but we could
[1:08:59] we could definitely come to the
[1:09:00] conclusion that they had thoughts of of
[1:09:03] the devil bringing to their mind of uh
[1:09:05] you don't have to do this today you
[1:09:06] don't have to go speak to this person
[1:09:07] you don't have to pray today because
[1:09:09] you're human beings like us
[1:09:10] god didn't call superhumans
[1:09:13] he called
[1:09:14] he called us
[1:09:15] this he called them the words i'm slowed
[1:09:18] down so we're sinners saved by grace
[1:09:21] so he knew that we're sinners saved by
[1:09:23] grace that's why he had to die for us so
[1:09:25] we could become like him
[1:09:27] if we don't die to ourselves we can
[1:09:29] never truly become into his image
[1:09:31] never
[1:09:33] now moses now notice moses he went down
[1:09:36] after he got his glasses focused and
[1:09:38] seen that it was god's program
[1:09:40] what he wants to do he went down he
[1:09:42] fought hard he had many great battles
[1:09:45] one of his great trying battles i like
[1:09:47] to bring it we had just achieved it by
[1:09:49] showing signs and wonders by different
[1:09:51] things that god has showed him to speak
[1:09:53] the word it will become a material and
[1:09:54] happen
[1:09:55] same thing today we have today we speak
[1:09:58] the word over the sick
[1:10:00] and watch it heal and do these other
[1:10:02] things that god's word spoke through
[1:10:04] human lips you say to this mountain be
[1:10:06] moved and don't doubt it but believe
[1:10:08] what you said will come to pass you can
[1:10:10] have what you said jesus said so
[1:10:12] now we have to believe that and hold to
[1:10:15] it and take it and believe it and all
[1:10:17] these things
[1:10:18] this word is full of many wonderful
[1:10:20] promises you can say to this mountain be
[1:10:22] moved i think a lot of times we don't
[1:10:24] have enough faith to move that mountain
[1:10:26] we don't have enough faith to to hit
[1:10:29] to heal to heal is sick it says
[1:10:32] laying hands in the sickness shall
[1:10:34] recover like a lot of times we can doubt
[1:10:36] and just a little bit of doubt is not
[1:10:38] going to bring it to pass
[1:10:39] so
[1:10:41] god is the same god as he was in paul's
[1:10:43] day as he was in moses's day as he was
[1:10:46] in peter's day and brother branham's day
[1:10:48] see it's not about who the person is but
[1:10:51] it's about you taking a hold of god's
[1:10:53] word
[1:10:55] because
[1:10:56] the needs that you have god wants to
[1:10:57] fulfill those needs but you have to
[1:10:59] believe that he can fulfill those needs
[1:11:00] in your life see if you can't take god
[1:11:03] at his word then he can never
[1:11:06] be permanent in your life
[1:11:08] because god works on the basis of you
[1:11:10] believing him otherwise like this door
[1:11:13] right here he's not gonna bust he's not
[1:11:14] gonna bust the door in like like a swat
[1:11:16] team member he's gonna knock at the door
[1:11:19] and you gotta open it
[1:11:20] he's not gonna blow it up with dynamite
[1:11:22] he's not gonna get a rocket launcher and
[1:11:23] blow it up but no he's a gentleman he's
[1:11:26] going to let you
[1:11:28] let him in just like if i invite you to
[1:11:30] my house if i never let you in unlock
[1:11:33] the door then you could never have entry
[1:11:35] same thing
[1:11:36] and you just be knocking all night and i
[1:11:37] won't do anything
[1:11:39] so the same thing you walk with god you
[1:11:40] gotta let him in
[1:11:42] if you want victory let him in if you
[1:11:44] want to overcome your habits let him in
[1:11:46] amen if you want to you want to praise
[1:11:49] pray and heal somebody let him in
[1:11:51] if you want to move that mountain let
[1:11:53] him in
[1:11:55] oh you had a faith as a grain and a
[1:11:56] mustard seed that's all he said and you
[1:11:58] could have what you asked
[1:12:00] but the thing is don't just ask this
[1:12:02] anything
[1:12:03] i want three cadillacs and a bentley
[1:12:06] that's not something that's going to
[1:12:07] benefit you anything it's not even going
[1:12:08] to help you in fact
[1:12:11] won't you pray lord give me a greater
[1:12:13] burden to help somebody
[1:12:15] lord how can i speak to this individual
[1:12:17] to help him point him closer to you amen
[1:12:19] or lord
[1:12:20] help me help to change my nature lord
[1:12:22] it's things i'm struggling with give me
[1:12:24] the strength to overcome those things
[1:12:26] are going to build you
[1:12:28] it's good yes the lord wants to give you
[1:12:29] the house he wants to give you the car
[1:12:31] but he said but seek ye first the
[1:12:33] kingdom of god and his righteousness
[1:12:35] remember say it one more time but seek
[1:12:37] ye first the kingdom of righteousness
[1:12:39] and all these things will be added unto
[1:12:41] you he knows you need to pay the rent he
[1:12:43] knows you need a car he knows you need
[1:12:45] gas in your car he knows all these
[1:12:46] things you have need of but just seek
[1:12:48] him with all your heart
[1:12:50] seek the kingdom and he's going to bless
[1:12:52] you with the things that you need i love
[1:12:54] saying this statement he's not going to
[1:12:55] fulfill your greeds but your needs
[1:12:58] a lot of times we we greed for things
[1:13:01] and we don't really need it
[1:13:03] i'm not saying like i said you can have
[1:13:04] nice things but don't lust after those
[1:13:06] nice things
[1:13:08] praise god let's keep going let's go to
[1:13:10] romans chapter eight how we doing on
[1:13:11] time
[1:13:14] romans chapter eight verse one
[1:13:17] through 1-9
[1:13:22] praise god
[1:13:24] so it says there there is therefore no
[1:13:26] now no condemnation to them
[1:13:29] which are in christ jesus who walk not
[1:13:31] after the flesh but after the spirit
[1:13:33] notice that this a decision a choice
[1:13:36] so it was either
[1:13:37] walking after the flesh but after the
[1:13:38] spirit
[1:13:39] just because you've given your heart to
[1:13:41] god doesn't give you the green past that
[1:13:43] you're always going to be in the spirit
[1:13:45] you still have to strive to be in the
[1:13:47] spirit you still got to make a decision
[1:13:49] to serve god every day because his
[1:13:52] mercies are new each day today is a new
[1:13:54] day i believe brother john said this
[1:13:56] statement
[1:13:57] the hardest thing is to get up the next
[1:13:58] day and do all over again that's the
[1:14:00] hardest thing because you can have a
[1:14:02] victorious day
[1:14:04] yesterday
[1:14:06] but
[1:14:06] tuesday has many trials and hardships
[1:14:10] but the thing is you got to be so
[1:14:11] anchored in that that doesn't distract
[1:14:13] you it doesn't even move you
[1:14:16] for the law of the spirit of life in
[1:14:18] christ jesus has made me free from the
[1:14:20] law of sin and death for what the law
[1:14:22] could not do and that it was weak
[1:14:24] through the flesh god sending his own
[1:14:27] son in the likeness of sinful flesh
[1:14:30] for our sin condemned sin in the flesh
[1:14:33] so he came and condemned these things in
[1:14:35] the flesh
[1:14:36] he he won your sickness your healing
[1:14:40] your your habits you could be delivered
[1:14:42] from so you got deliverance you got
[1:14:44] healing and all these things is given to
[1:14:45] you at your hand at your disposal but
[1:14:48] how how serious you are obtaining these
[1:14:50] things
[1:14:51] because god is looking at your
[1:14:53] your desperation he's looking at how
[1:14:55] serious you are if you want to overcome
[1:14:56] something in your life show god how
[1:14:58] desperate how much you mean business
[1:14:59] don't just live with the thing that
[1:15:01] you've been addicted for for many years
[1:15:04] because god didn't intend for us to live
[1:15:06] with these giants and as i preached a
[1:15:07] long time ago he didn't intend for us to
[1:15:09] live in the with these giants in our
[1:15:11] land a lot of times we like to coexist
[1:15:13] with our giants like i said before but
[1:15:15] god didn't call us to coexist he called
[1:15:17] us to to kill these giants
[1:15:19] david wasn't willing to coexist with
[1:15:21] goliath in fact he cut his head off
[1:15:25] and he even he even said to the to
[1:15:27] israel the armies you're going to let
[1:15:28] this uncircumcised philistine defile the
[1:15:31] armies of the living god so are you
[1:15:33] going to let this giant defile your walk
[1:15:35] with god
[1:15:36] are you no i don't think so
[1:15:38] so you take that giant and you take
[1:15:40] god's word and cut away
[1:15:42] cut to you you see pieces
[1:15:45] where are we at now we'll go to romans 4
[1:15:47] or romans sorry 8 4
[1:15:49] that righteousness of the law might be
[1:15:51] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[1:15:53] flesh but after the spirit so number
[1:15:55] time that the righteousness of the law
[1:15:57] might be fulfilled in us who walk not
[1:16:00] after the flesh but after the spirit so
[1:16:02] you have to be walking in the spirit
[1:16:05] verse 5
[1:16:06] for they that are after the flesh do
[1:16:08] mine the things of the flesh
[1:16:11] but they they're after the spirit the
[1:16:12] things of the spirit notice it's no
[1:16:14] middle ground it's either one or the
[1:16:16] other either you're walking in the
[1:16:17] spirit or you're not you're walking in
[1:16:18] the flesh or you're not it's it's either
[1:16:20] it's no it's black and white a lot of
[1:16:22] times the human beings we like to say
[1:16:23] well i'm still serving god
[1:16:26] but you're cold so are you really
[1:16:28] serving god really
[1:16:29] he'd rather have you hot or cold not
[1:16:31] lukewarm
[1:16:34] for that for for to be currently minded
[1:16:36] is death so for me not to have the mind
[1:16:38] of christ is death
[1:16:40] i was going to say like it is
[1:16:43] but to be spiritually minded as life and
[1:16:45] priest life and peace so to have the
[1:16:47] mind of christ
[1:16:49] is life and peace
[1:16:51] because life and peace that that mind of
[1:16:53] christ is like i said can keep you
[1:16:54] focused on what you're what your goal is
[1:16:57] your end goal he wants to give you an
[1:16:59] expected end he promised to do that but
[1:17:01] the thing is you have to seek him with
[1:17:02] all your heart that's what jeremiah
[1:17:04] tells us
[1:17:06] so then they there in the flesh cannot
[1:17:08] please god
[1:17:09] actually let me jump at the verse seven
[1:17:11] i skipped it because the carnal mind is
[1:17:13] enmity against god so your carnal nature
[1:17:16] your carnal mind is totally against god
[1:17:19] it can't even be subject to the law of
[1:17:21] god we go back into the old testament
[1:17:23] when they would sacrifice sin
[1:17:25] they would be forgiven but they still
[1:17:27] have that same desire to sin
[1:17:29] but when the perfect sacrifice the lamb
[1:17:31] of god was sacrificed
[1:17:33] when you truly repent
[1:17:36] and turn from your ways that desire
[1:17:38] leaves you when you're truly delivered
[1:17:40] that desire leaves you
[1:17:42] so you don't have to be a victim and be
[1:17:45] in bondage anymore because christ died
[1:17:48] for your freedom and rose again that you
[1:17:50] could be free
[1:17:53] praise guys keep going verse uh verse
[1:17:56] six so then they that are in the verse
[1:17:58] eight so then they that are in the flesh
[1:17:59] cannot please god let's jump down to
[1:18:01] verse 12 with me
[1:18:03] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[1:18:05] the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:18:08] for if you live after the flesh ye shall
[1:18:10] die
[1:18:11] but if ye through the spirit do mortify
[1:18:14] the deeds of the body ye shall live once
[1:18:16] again it goes back to crucifying
[1:18:19] you've got to crucify so we need a
[1:18:21] balance in our life we need a perfect
[1:18:23] balance
[1:18:24] see it's a good see a good thing can be
[1:18:26] too much so if i could work and pay my
[1:18:29] bills but if my work is or is this
[1:18:31] engulfing my whole life and god becomes
[1:18:33] put in second place then that's a false
[1:18:35] balance and we're going to read what a
[1:18:36] false balance is in a second let's go to
[1:18:39] proverbs 16.
[1:18:47] well proverbs 16. we're going to stay in
[1:18:48] a book of proverbs
[1:18:50] for a little bit not too long but a
[1:18:52] little bit
[1:18:53] so verse 16 and we'll go with verse
[1:18:55] verse 11.
[1:18:57] so it says a just weight and balances
[1:19:00] are the lords all the weights of the
[1:19:02] bags are his work a just weight and
[1:19:05] balance are the lowers so if we want a
[1:19:07] perfect balance it has to be in the lord
[1:19:10] we can't ourselves cannot have a perfect
[1:19:12] balance because as human beings we're
[1:19:14] not we're we're unbalanced as it is and
[1:19:17] it takes god to give us that perfect
[1:19:19] balance
[1:19:20] that's why i said that vision has to be
[1:19:21] ever before you
[1:19:23] and then
[1:19:24] the thing is you have to have a vision
[1:19:26] of your own you can't just piggyback off
[1:19:28] of somebody else's vision yes you can
[1:19:29] help that vision but you still need a
[1:19:31] vision for your personal life as well
[1:19:33] because i can't walk for you you can't
[1:19:35] walk for me all right
[1:19:37] let's go to proverbs 11 a couple over a
[1:19:39] couple verses or chapters over
[1:19:41] so a false balance is an abomination to
[1:19:44] the lord so if we have a false balance
[1:19:46] the scriptures tell me it's an
[1:19:47] abomination to the lord if we if we're
[1:19:49] putting work over god then that's an
[1:19:51] abomination
[1:19:52] even for putting the family over god
[1:19:54] that's an abomination the family has its
[1:19:56] place
[1:19:57] it needs to be second place and god
[1:19:59] first place
[1:20:00] so i need to be last
[1:20:02] god my family then then i'm gonna be
[1:20:05] then me
[1:20:06] because god promised to take care of me
[1:20:08] he promised to supply not only my
[1:20:10] physical needs but most important my
[1:20:12] spiritual needs because god can bless
[1:20:14] you with all these material things he
[1:20:16] says he blesses the just and the unjust
[1:20:18] i don't want just physical blessings but
[1:20:20] i want spiritual blessings going to help
[1:20:22] me grow into his image
[1:20:23] that's the only thing that's going to
[1:20:24] matter at the end of the day what's done
[1:20:26] for christ is going to matter
[1:20:28] not how many uh hot meal plates i gave
[1:20:30] to the homeless people not how many cars
[1:20:33] i owned in my life now how many uh
[1:20:36] designer shoes i have or how many nice
[1:20:39] sunglasses i have that's not gonna
[1:20:40] matter all these things are gonna pass
[1:20:42] away but what's done for him the
[1:20:44] decisions you make for him that's what's
[1:20:46] going to matter
[1:20:47] that's what's going to build you
[1:20:49] let's go to proverbs 20 23.
[1:20:56] diver's weights are an abomination to
[1:20:57] the lord and a false balance is not good
[1:21:00] so the scripture is constantly telling
[1:21:02] me in proverbs a false balance is not
[1:21:04] good i like the word of divers it's
[1:21:07] different various weight of importance
[1:21:10] power or influence so we don't want to
[1:21:12] be influenced by the wrong things
[1:21:15] like i said before a good thing can
[1:21:16] become a bad thing if you do too much of
[1:21:18] it like you you can eat too much of a
[1:21:21] one food even a carrot can turn you
[1:21:23] orange but is this is it still good at
[1:21:25] the end of the day yes it's good but you
[1:21:26] ate too much of it so i'm engulfing on
[1:21:28] too much of
[1:21:30] my my of the world and its pleasures
[1:21:33] you need it needs to be a balance
[1:21:35] work yes god expects you to work but
[1:21:37] doesn't expect you to engulf your whole
[1:21:39] life where you have nothing
[1:21:40] no time to do anything because you have
[1:21:42] a family you don't want to just work
[1:21:43] your whole life away and not build
[1:21:45] something with your family and your wife
[1:21:48] see god expects you to make time for him
[1:21:51] don't just pencil him in your schedule
[1:21:52] but you make time for him sometimes
[1:21:54] you're going to have to sacrifice you
[1:21:55] don't have to sacrifice things it could
[1:21:57] be things doing around the house
[1:21:59] or
[1:22:00] you want to go out and watch a tv show
[1:22:02] whatever it is
[1:22:04] a lot of times this christian life is
[1:22:05] suffering you're going to have to put
[1:22:07] things aside
[1:22:09] to follow that vision
[1:22:12] let's go to john chapter 3 verse 1 let's
[1:22:15] go to john 3
[1:22:17] 3 john 1 2.
[1:22:22] time just flies huh
[1:22:27] so john three
[1:22:30] verse
[1:22:32] one second
[1:22:33] oh third john
[1:22:38] so it says
[1:22:39] we'll start verse verse two
[1:22:42] beloved i wish above all things that
[1:22:43] thou mayest prosper and be in health
[1:22:46] even
[1:22:47] as thy soul prosper
[1:22:49] so the lord wants you to prosper in good
[1:22:50] health he does but that shouldn't be
[1:22:52] your main focal point your main focal
[1:22:54] point should be your soul prospering
[1:22:57] that's what god's desire is
[1:22:59] if your soul isn't prospering
[1:23:01] then you're missing why he called you
[1:23:03] because he's constantly trying to
[1:23:04] restore you back into his image adam and
[1:23:07] eve they were made perfect
[1:23:10] but before the fall everything was
[1:23:12] perfect and god is trying to get us back
[1:23:14] to that
[1:23:16] that image
[1:23:17] and it takes it's gonna take time it's
[1:23:20] gonna take a lot of trials a lot of
[1:23:21] hardships a lot of heartaches
[1:23:24] but don't don't worry about those things
[1:23:26] that are happening they're there to
[1:23:27] build your character they're more
[1:23:30] precious than gold the bible says
[1:23:32] right
[1:23:34] praise god
[1:23:37] so when we're really focusing
[1:23:40] on something
[1:23:41] we're really directing our effort so we
[1:23:43] need to be like i said before
[1:23:45] focus your intention on god god is
[1:23:47] trying to speak to us every day
[1:23:49] it's like how many are familiar with the
[1:23:51] radios you gotta get a tune
[1:23:53] well that's how your walk is you gotta
[1:23:55] tune it to the right frequency when
[1:23:56] you're turning that radio
[1:23:57] if you're not exactly the right
[1:23:58] frequency it's kind of fuzzy but when
[1:24:00] you hit that right frequency it's clear
[1:24:03] that's how you walk with god is you
[1:24:05] gotta tune it because the devil wants to
[1:24:07] act like he is god he wants to even use
[1:24:09] the word he even try to use the word
[1:24:10] against the very word
[1:24:12] imagine that
[1:24:14] so the thing is god has
[1:24:16] when god speaks something we're talking
[1:24:18] about men's meeting
[1:24:20] don't don't question it
[1:24:21] just follow after it
[1:24:23] god isn't going to confuse you he's not
[1:24:25] the author if god has told you to do
[1:24:26] something and it lines up with the word
[1:24:28] perfectly he's not gonna then right
[1:24:30] after just say oh whoa don't do that
[1:24:32] anymore do this no god is not the author
[1:24:34] of confusion in fact he wants to give
[1:24:36] you peace
[1:24:38] he promised to give you peace that
[1:24:40] passes all understanding
[1:24:43] so if i
[1:24:44] said
[1:24:45] if i want a closer walk with god i have
[1:24:48] to put all everything in my focus my
[1:24:50] heart my soul my mind my body
[1:24:53] everything
[1:24:54] all my attention to him he wants my
[1:24:56] heart
[1:24:57] he wants my time he wants every part of
[1:24:59] me
[1:25:00] god is looking for believers that will
[1:25:02] give
[1:25:03] him
[1:25:04] every part of their life
[1:25:05] open every door of your heart to him
[1:25:08] don't just open some doors but open
[1:25:09] every door to him he's knocking because
[1:25:11] there's doors that we haven't opened to
[1:25:13] him yet
[1:25:14] but we have to be the one that opens the
[1:25:16] door not the pastor not not brother
[1:25:19] roger not brother johnson but we have to
[1:25:21] do it personally it's a personal walk
[1:25:24] it's an intimate walk i can't have
[1:25:25] brother roger walking on my road with me
[1:25:27] it's a straight and narrow it's only
[1:25:28] room for you and him
[1:25:30] that's the only two people it doesn't
[1:25:31] matter what age you are you can have a
[1:25:33] personal walk with god
[1:25:35] in fact i would even recommend you start
[1:25:37] young i wish i would have started
[1:25:39] younger amen
[1:25:40] so let's go to revelations 3 14.
[1:25:44] so the greatest distraction of this age
[1:25:47] is self
[1:25:49] right
[1:25:50] the greatest action is yourself the
[1:25:52] satan wants you to put so much focus on
[1:25:54] yourself that you forget about others
[1:25:56] and walking with god
[1:25:58] and the thing is it's not just about
[1:25:59] being a good person because there's
[1:26:01] gonna be good people that go to hell
[1:26:02] i'm sorry there's gonna be people that
[1:26:05] don't drink don't smoke
[1:26:06] they're going to hell see god isn't
[1:26:09] looking for this people with good morals
[1:26:11] but he's looking for people that serve
[1:26:13] him and want to have good morals see
[1:26:15] good morals i'm not i'm not disputing
[1:26:17] them you should have good morals you
[1:26:18] should be a good person you should help
[1:26:20] others but even paul said i could give i
[1:26:23] can get my body to be burned i can feed
[1:26:24] the poor but if i have not charity it
[1:26:27] profits me nothing
[1:26:29] so if you don't have the love of god
[1:26:30] inside your even brother branham said
[1:26:32] lay everything aside until you get
[1:26:34] perfect love so perfect love is going to
[1:26:36] be
[1:26:37] needs to be the focus and the theme of
[1:26:39] your life because that's what god is the
[1:26:41] scripture of god is love
[1:26:43] for god so loved the world that he gave
[1:26:44] his only begotten son
[1:26:47] he gave it for us take it personal
[1:26:49] he died for you personally brother
[1:26:51] johnson he died for you personally
[1:26:52] brother bruce
[1:26:53] he died for me personally and you see
[1:26:56] you got to put yourself you got to read
[1:26:58] as if he's speaking directly towards you
[1:27:00] because he is speaking to you
[1:27:01] he's speaking right this is a love
[1:27:03] letter written back to you
[1:27:05] that's how personal has to be don't
[1:27:07] think god is just somewhere out there
[1:27:09] but he's in his word he's inside of you
[1:27:11] the the very god that you serve living
[1:27:14] inside of you you can conquer any
[1:27:16] problem in your life because it's god
[1:27:18] conquering the problem and you're just
[1:27:20] moving out the way
[1:27:21] so he can solve that problem for you
[1:27:25] so let's go to 14. so this is the age
[1:27:27] we're living in and unto the angel of
[1:27:29] the church of laodiceans
[1:27:31] write these things saith the amen the
[1:27:33] faithful and true witness in the
[1:27:34] beginning of the creation of god
[1:27:37] i know thy works that thou art neither
[1:27:38] cold nor hot i would that thou were cold
[1:27:41] or hot
[1:27:42] so then because they are lukewarm and
[1:27:44] either cold nor hot i will spew thee out
[1:27:46] of my mouth
[1:27:47] because i'll say as i am rich and
[1:27:49] increase with goods and have need of
[1:27:51] nothing and know it's not that they are
[1:27:53] wretched miserable poor and blind and
[1:27:55] naked as i said before if i was walking
[1:27:58] across the street naked you would say
[1:28:00] something to me
[1:28:01] but these people are not naked but
[1:28:03] they're spiritually naked and they don't
[1:28:05] even know it they think that they have
[1:28:07] all they need well i know enough of god
[1:28:09] he's my savior but he doesn't want to
[1:28:12] just be saved he wants to be the lord of
[1:28:13] all your life
[1:28:15] that's his desire savior and lord see
[1:28:17] these people
[1:28:18] they accepted they accepted the
[1:28:20] sacrifice oh he died for me i believe it
[1:28:22] all hallelujah but they never made him
[1:28:24] the lord of their life
[1:28:26] because
[1:28:28] not that the wretched miserable poor and
[1:28:30] blind and naked i count he even i
[1:28:32] counsel you to buy of me gold and try
[1:28:33] and fire he's giving him an open
[1:28:35] invitation
[1:28:36] take my invitation i want to come into
[1:28:39] you my son my daughter
[1:28:41] but if he can never get past that door
[1:28:44] then we're going to miss it and go to
[1:28:45] hell
[1:28:47] and that's how serious it is this is a
[1:28:49] serious game
[1:28:51] it's a serious time it's no game
[1:28:53] and god is waiting for us to get serious
[1:28:56] to get down to business to get focused
[1:28:58] on him that's what he's waiting for
[1:29:00] he's been waiting since the the fall of
[1:29:02] adam and eve in the garden
[1:29:04] for us to get to this point we're living
[1:29:06] in the greatest time ever right now
[1:29:09] we're so close to the coming of the lord
[1:29:11] let's work while there's light
[1:29:13] let's build others while there's light
[1:29:15] yeah let's let's preach the gospel to
[1:29:18] others that haven't heard it amen it's
[1:29:19] not right for somebody to hear it five
[1:29:21] times somebody here once
[1:29:23] right
[1:29:24] there's so many there's still souls out
[1:29:26] there otherwise we'll be going home
[1:29:27] right now
[1:29:28] so what is god trying to do in your life
[1:29:30] right now
[1:29:32] and no matter how old you are how young
[1:29:33] you are god can use you yeah we got so
[1:29:36] many scriptural examples in here
[1:29:40] i counsel you to buy me gold tried in
[1:29:42] the fire that thou mays be rich and
[1:29:44] white remnant that thou mayest be
[1:29:46] clothed and the shame of thy nakedness
[1:29:47] do not appear and knowing that i what i
[1:29:50] said thou may see notice in each age
[1:29:53] look the author of the bible
[1:29:54] god has given an open invitation
[1:29:58] and the same word
[1:29:59] that
[1:30:00] saved the individual who hearkened to it
[1:30:03] the same word that condemned
[1:30:05] the unbeliever
[1:30:07] so we have a choice
[1:30:08] you you take that gold that he's given
[1:30:11] you and you counsel to buy of me gold
[1:30:13] tried in the fire he wants you to be
[1:30:15] rich
[1:30:16] not necessarily
[1:30:17] with material goods but spiritually rich
[1:30:21] because i can have all this money but
[1:30:22] not know god just because i have all
[1:30:25] these things and nice things doesn't
[1:30:26] mean i have a walk with god
[1:30:28] it doesn't how many people you see ceos
[1:30:31] tikes all these people
[1:30:33] nba players
[1:30:35] billionaires all these things billions
[1:30:37] of dollars isn't going to help me at the
[1:30:38] end of the day
[1:30:39] i can't take it with me
[1:30:42] verse 19 as many as i love i rebuke and
[1:30:44] chasten right brother ferguson
[1:30:46] be zealous therefore and repent so he's
[1:30:49] gonna chasten us
[1:30:51] as we learn in the ministry not just to
[1:30:53] do it to do it for a reason
[1:30:55] he's trying to build something in you
[1:30:58] he's called us to a certain purpose and
[1:31:00] if he doesn't do these things we can't
[1:31:03] we can't be ready for it
[1:31:05] because god is calling each one of us to
[1:31:06] a purpose
[1:31:07] i don't know necessarily what it is in
[1:31:09] your life you have to figure it out
[1:31:10] personally for yourself you have to have
[1:31:12] a personal walk and let him reveal that
[1:31:14] to you because i can't reveal it to you
[1:31:16] i can't do anything i i can't i'm sorry
[1:31:19] one thing i can do is
[1:31:20] give you failures that's all i got
[1:31:23] so i got
[1:31:24] behold i stand at the door and knock if
[1:31:27] any man notice he says any man
[1:31:29] invitation any man you don't have to be
[1:31:30] black white hispanic orange white purple
[1:31:33] but if any man hear my voice
[1:31:36] he's not a respecter of persons and open
[1:31:39] the door i will come into him and what's
[1:31:41] up with him and he with me
[1:31:44] to him that overcometh like grant to sit
[1:31:46] with me in my throne even as i also
[1:31:48] overcame and sat down with my father in
[1:31:50] his throne i want to be there i don't
[1:31:53] know about you guys but i want to be
[1:31:54] there he that happened here is speaking
[1:31:56] to us let them hear what the spirit
[1:31:59] saying to the churches
[1:32:01] what are you crucifying
[1:32:03] your desires
[1:32:05] and wants that go against the will of
[1:32:07] god our lazy and thoughtful nature that
[1:32:10] once they give god barely to live no
[1:32:12] effort why are we crucifying the flesh
[1:32:14] because if you don't then you will put
[1:32:16] your will before god's will and to top
[1:32:18] it all off you'll be caught up in
[1:32:19] laodicea and not even know it
[1:32:23] and like i said before you're overcoming
[1:32:25] yourself
[1:32:26] we have to overcome our desires and our
[1:32:29] dreams and our plans not every dream and
[1:32:31] every plan you have is gonna be
[1:32:34] in god's will i'm sorry to say it's not
[1:32:36] that's why it says if the lord will not
[1:32:40] to say it just to say because it sounds
[1:32:42] good but i actually asked the lord is
[1:32:43] this your will for me to get this car
[1:32:45] for me to get this job because it's
[1:32:48] because you're making a lot of money in
[1:32:49] this job
[1:32:50] doesn't mean that's what god wants you
[1:32:52] to have
[1:32:53] because that job can have so many
[1:32:54] distractions so many spirits in there
[1:32:57] and all that money isn't going to matter
[1:32:59] if it's affecting your spiritual walk
[1:33:00] with god i'll rather i'd rather take a
[1:33:03] 20 000 pay cut and be in god's will then
[1:33:06] then make that extra twenty thousand
[1:33:08] dollars because god's gonna supply my
[1:33:09] needs he is he promised to
[1:33:12] if you if we can live a fully submitted
[1:33:15] surrender life to god on a daily basis
[1:33:17] like i said before there's no devil or
[1:33:19] demon that can stop or distract us from
[1:33:21] god's perfect will
[1:33:24] these the three things i got
[1:33:26] what does it mean to live a fully
[1:33:28] surrendered life one waking up every day
[1:33:31] and realizing there's a battle between
[1:33:33] your human nature and your spiritual man
[1:33:35] number two
[1:33:37] realizing that you cannot serve god
[1:33:39] until we crucify our old man and our
[1:33:41] human nature and then we can pick up our
[1:33:44] cross number three
[1:33:46] realizing that no one can make the
[1:33:48] choice but you not your pastor not your
[1:33:51] spouse not your brother or your sister
[1:33:53] get in such a habit of truly crucifying
[1:33:56] your flesh that it gets scared to come
[1:33:58] out
[1:33:59] i'm gonna get some i'm gonna get some
[1:34:00] scripture with that too actually so i
[1:34:02] don't think i'm just making it up so go
[1:34:04] go to second corinthians 12 with me
[1:34:07] because you can get to a place like that
[1:34:09] it's possible look what uh the lord said
[1:34:11] to paul in second or second corinthians
[1:34:13] 12 9. and he said unto me my grace is
[1:34:16] sufficient for thee
[1:34:19] for my strength is made perfect in
[1:34:21] weakness check this out here most gladly
[1:34:23] therefore will i rather glory in my
[1:34:26] infirmities that the power of christ may
[1:34:28] rest upon me
[1:34:30] therefore i take pleasure he said i take
[1:34:33] pleasure in infirmities in reproaches
[1:34:36] and necessities
[1:34:38] what in persecutions in distress for
[1:34:41] what for christ's sake
[1:34:43] for when i am weak then i am strong so
[1:34:45] you can glory in your trials
[1:34:47] your sickness your reproaches all these
[1:34:49] things you can glory in get glory being
[1:34:52] persecuted for walking the gospel's sake
[1:34:55] you don't have to be a victim and
[1:34:57] complain don't murmur complain the bible
[1:34:58] tells us in fact do all things without
[1:35:01] murmurings and disputings god doesn't
[1:35:03] want to hear your murmurings and i don't
[1:35:04] want to hear your murmurings and i want
[1:35:05] to hear my own murmurings because all
[1:35:07] they're going to do is they're going to
[1:35:08] break you down instead of build you up
[1:35:11] so and we can attain these i i'm by
[1:35:13] god's grace i'm gonna start glory to my
[1:35:14] infirmities by his grace
[1:35:16] and my sicknesses all these things
[1:35:19] because they're there for a reason
[1:35:20] they're to help you they're not to
[1:35:22] not to
[1:35:23] hurt you not to hinder you but they're
[1:35:25] here to
[1:35:26] build you up
[1:35:28] praise god that's uh

[1:35:49] victory right that's quiet there let's

[1:36:08] much more precious than gold that
[1:36:10] perisheth though it be tried with fire
[1:36:14] might be found at the praise and honor
[1:36:16] and glory at the paring of jesus christ
[1:36:18] whom having not seen you love and whom
[1:36:21] though now you see him not yet believing

[1:36:46] jesus christ to them that have obtained
[1:36:48] like precious faith with us through the
[1:36:50] righteousness of god and our savior
[1:36:52] jesus christ grace and peace be
[1:36:54] multiplied unto you the knowledge of god
[1:36:57] in jesus our lord according as his
[1:36:59] divine power hath given to us all things
[1:37:02] that pertain unto life and godliness
[1:37:04] through the knowledge of him that have
[1:37:06] called us to glory and virtue
[1:37:09] whereby we are given unto us exceedingly
[1:37:12] great and precious promises
[1:37:14] that by these
[1:37:15] you might be partakers of the divine
[1:37:17] nature
[1:37:18] that's what we need the divine nature of
[1:37:21] god

[1:37:22] help you in this world

[1:37:49] things be in you and abound
[1:37:52] they make you that you shall neither be
[1:37:54] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:37:56] of our lord jesus christ but he that
[1:37:58] lacketh these things is blind and cannot
[1:38:00] see you fart off we need our glasses
[1:38:02] adjusted we need a better prescription
[1:38:04] and cannot see it far enough he had
[1:38:05] forgotten that he was purged from his
[1:38:08] old sins

[1:38:35] you'll be able to after my decease to
[1:38:38] have these things always in my
[1:38:39] remembrance this may be the last sermon
[1:38:41] i might preach
[1:38:42] but i want to go out pointing to you
[1:38:44] guys to stay focused on christ don't
[1:38:46] take your eyes off of jesus christ
[1:38:49] couple quotes and i'll i'll close
[1:38:52] i know it's hard it cuts me and i hate
[1:38:54] to say anything to people but friends i
[1:38:56] have to stand at the judgment someday to
[1:38:58] answer before you people that's right
[1:39:00] and your blood will be upon my hands you
[1:39:03] will serve god with reverence and your
[1:39:05] pure heart holy for love for him
[1:39:08] walk every day in that mood of love all
[1:39:10] the time do good things to others and do
[1:39:12] good charitable deeds and love god
[1:39:14] notice that part love god and worship
[1:39:16] him that's the way you're supposed to
[1:39:18] live and treat your neighbor as yourself
[1:39:20] that's right
[1:39:23] we must focus our lives this is from
[1:39:27] uh look
[1:39:29] 1963 we must focus our lives i love this
[1:39:31] this quote
[1:39:32] i found i was like wow thank you lord
[1:39:34] not what somebody else says but our
[1:39:37] focus
[1:39:38] focus our lives to him and he is the
[1:39:40] word see if we get our lives lined up
[1:39:43] with the word then the word in our life
[1:39:45] becomes the same who praise god
[1:39:48] he said if you abide in me and my words
[1:39:50] abide in you then ask what you will it
[1:39:54] will be granted to you verily i say unto
[1:39:56] you if you say to this mountain be moved
[1:39:59] and don't doubt in your heart notice
[1:40:00] that don't doubt not one speck of doubt
[1:40:03] can be in there your heart but believe
[1:40:05] that what you have said will come to
[1:40:06] pass you can have what you said
[1:40:09] if you want deliverance you can have it
[1:40:11] if you want if you want healing in your
[1:40:12] body you can have it
[1:40:14] if you want if you want a greater hunger
[1:40:16] and thirsting for god you can have it
[1:40:20] oh my now what i said what not what i
[1:40:22] said what you said you can have because
[1:40:25] you and he become the same praise god
[1:40:28] because the mind that was in christ is
[1:40:30] in you
[1:40:31] and the mind that was in christ was to
[1:40:33] fulfill the father's word which he was
[1:40:36] the word there you are then you and the
[1:40:38] word are focused in together only one
[1:40:41] more time then you and the word are
[1:40:43] focused in together you become a living
[1:40:47] unit of god how great
[1:40:50] musicians you can come up
[1:40:52] i just
[1:40:54] we need to be focused this age is so
[1:40:56] full of distractions
[1:40:58] and satan will get anything and any any
[1:41:00] place to distract you
[1:41:02] from your high calling this is a high
[1:41:04] calling we're living
[1:41:06] and we have to be up for the test you
[1:41:09] got to be up to discipline yourself you
[1:41:11] got to be up to lose sleep for prayer
[1:41:13] i'll say it again you gotta be able to
[1:41:15] lose sleep for prayer
[1:41:16] lose sleep to read the word of god
[1:41:18] and have a balance don't just read all
[1:41:20] word and no prayer you need to have a
[1:41:21] balance pray more than you read
[1:41:24] because you can read too much
[1:41:27] all right you can read the letter
[1:41:28] killeth but what the spirit brings to
[1:41:31] life and through a prayer life that's
[1:41:32] what's going to happen i'm going to
[1:41:34] bring that to life for you i don't want
[1:41:36] to just read the word
[1:41:37] i want to
[1:41:38] be the word i want to be a living
[1:41:40] epistle that's what the word calling me
[1:41:42] to be a living epistle your life is
[1:41:44] going to do a lot more than you just
[1:41:45] cramming scripture down in somebody's
[1:41:46] throat
[1:41:47] because how many times have people done
[1:41:49] that
[1:41:49] how many times have people just cram
[1:41:52] scripture down people's throat you know
[1:41:54] a lot of people turn their back on god i
[1:41:56] hear a lot of catholics because they
[1:41:57] were cramming this stuff down in their
[1:41:58] throat and now they turn their back on
[1:42:00] god i want to live a life
[1:42:03] that will draw somebody to christ
[1:42:05] because it's not me living it but it's
[1:42:07] christ in me as paul said in galatians
[1:42:09] no more me lives life but christ didn't
[1:42:11] be crucified
[1:42:14] can we sing what a day
[1:42:23] there is coming
[1:42:26] a day when no
[1:42:29] heartache shall come
[1:42:32] no more clouds in the sky
