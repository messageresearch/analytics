[35:14] again in the name of the lord jesus
[35:15] christ and let's continue to lift up
[35:17] those who are sick and afflicted who
[35:19] want to be here and can't and
[35:21] let's just feed on the word today
[35:24] we gotta turn our bibles into genesis
[35:27] chapter three
[35:29] verse one probably
[35:30] very familiar scripture
[35:34] and when you get there say amen
[35:39] and get there myself
[35:42] so start off in verse 1 take our reading
[35:46] now the serpent was more susceptible
[35:48] than any beast of the field which the
[35:51] lord god had made
[35:53] and he said unto the woman
[35:55] yea hath god said he shall not eat of
[35:57] every tree
[35:59] of the garden
[36:00] verse 2 and the woman said unto the
[36:02] serpent
[36:03] we may eat of the fruit of the trees of
[36:05] the garden for the fruit of the tree
[36:07] which is in the midst of the garden god
[36:09] has said ye shall not eat of it neither
[36:12] shall you touch it lest ye die
[36:14] and the serpent said unto the woman
[36:16] you shall not surely die
[36:19] for god doth know that in the day you
[36:21] eat thereof then your eyes shall be open
[36:24] you shall be as gods knowing good and
[36:26] evil
[36:27] verse 6 and the woman saw that the tree
[36:30] was good for food and it was pleasant to
[36:32] the eyes in a tree to be desired to make
[36:35] one wise
[36:36] she took of the fruit thereof and did
[36:38] eat and gave also unto her husband with
[36:41] her and he did eat and the eyes of them
[36:44] both were open and they knew that they
[36:46] were naked
[36:47] and they threw fig leaves together and
[36:49] made themselves aprons and they heard
[36:51] the voice of the lord god walking in the
[36:53] garden in the cool of the day
[36:55] and adam and his wife hid themselves
[36:57] from the presence of the lord god
[36:59] amongst the trees of the garden
[37:01] and the lord god called unto adam and
[37:02] said unto him where art thou
[37:05] and he said i heard that voice in the
[37:07] garden and i was afraid because i was
[37:09] naked and i hid myself
[37:11] and he said who told thee that thou was
[37:13] naked
[37:14] has thou eaten of the tree wherefore i
[37:16] commanded it commanded thee that thou
[37:18] shouldest not eat
[37:19] and the man said the woman whom thou
[37:21] gave us to be with
[37:22] she gave me the tree and i did eat and
[37:25] the lord god said unto the woman what is
[37:27] this that thou hast done and the woman
[37:28] said the serpent begot me and i did eat
[37:31] let's bow our heads before receded o
[37:34] lord jesus

[37:37] thank you lord just for letting us be

[37:48] you i pray you send your spirit lord and
[37:51] let us have such sweet communion with
[37:53] you lord let us come away closer to you
[37:56] lord let us come hungry your lord let us

[38:12] pray you just direct the service how you

[38:16] to have control of every spirit and we
[38:17] give you control of ourselves lord and
[38:20] just have your preeminence lord from the
[38:21] beginning of servant to the end of the
[38:23] service and we love you and thank you
[38:25] and have your wonderful most precious
[38:27] way in jesus christ's name we pray amen
[38:30] may be seated
[38:32] so wednesday night we uh talked about
[38:34] god's program
[38:35] and how it's important if you have not
[38:37] received the seal of the holy spirit you
[38:40] need to receive it
[38:41] that's the only way you can
[38:43] get in god's program to be born again
[38:46] and filled with the holy spirit the
[38:47] baptism of the holy ghost
[38:49] and today we want to talk about satan's
[38:51] program
[38:53] satan's program is a counterfeit of
[38:54] god's program
[38:56] and he wants he wants you to take this
[38:58] program instead of god's program because
[39:00] if you get into god's program
[39:02] then you're in that holy ghost channel
[39:04] but the thing is when you get into god's
[39:05] program
[39:06] satan's still going to try to distract
[39:08] you
[39:09] with whatever whatever you can family
[39:12] uh your work uh things are on the house
[39:15] you name it he wants to distract you
[39:18] so uh as i was reading i think it was
[39:20] yesterday i was just noticing in verse
[39:22] six of uh genesis chapter three
[39:24] when he said uh and the woman saw the
[39:26] tree was good for food and it was
[39:27] pleasant to the eyes
[39:29] see what drew with the thing with drew
[39:31] her in that tree was it was all carnal
[39:33] things it was things that stimulated her
[39:35] flesh
[39:36] it tasted good it looked it good
[39:39] but in reality she didn't realize the
[39:41] consequences that it was going to have
[39:44] in the short term and long-term futures
[39:46] a lot of times we make decisions hastily
[39:49] and we don't take time to pray about it
[39:51] and we start reaping the consequences
[39:53] the scripture says you reap what you sow
[39:56] so it's so important to every decision
[39:58] that you make
[39:59] go about it prayerfully use wisdom pray
[40:01] for wisdom even says in james to pray
[40:04] for a wisdom if you lack wisdom if you
[40:06] have wisdom pray for more wisdom
[40:08] so in this day and age this is the
[40:10] hardest age to live in because we have
[40:12] all these things at our fingertips we
[40:14] have uh phones computers techno all
[40:17] these things we have to try to make our
[40:19] lives easier what it's doing is making
[40:21] our lives lazier that's what it's doing
[40:24] so we'll keep going that scripture and
[40:27] and make one wise so it made her wise
[40:29] but not not the wisdom that comes from
[40:31] above it didn't make her that kind of
[40:33] that kind of wise it made a worldly
[40:34] wisdom
[40:35] and that's what satan is trying to get
[40:37] us to have is worldly wisdom because
[40:39] worldly wisdom likes to put
[40:42] says i know how to do everything if we
[40:44] have that kind of spirit god cannot
[40:45] teach you anything as we said on
[40:47] wednesday
[40:48] so we think about this satan's test
[40:50] program started in heaven he used it to
[40:53] deceive a third of the angels
[40:56] and the enemy he's cunning and crafty
[40:59] and today we want to expose the enemy
[41:02] because he needs to be exposed if we
[41:03] never expose him to how we're going to
[41:05] recognize them you need to study your
[41:06] enemy you need to recognize paul said
[41:09] we're not ignorant of satan's devices
[41:12] so in order for you to be aware of his
[41:14] devices you have to be in the spirit
[41:16] constantly if you're not in the spirit
[41:19] then satan has you in his trap already
[41:22] so he painted such a pretty picture to
[41:24] the angels and to eve it looks so good
[41:27] it's like a pain in fire it looks so
[41:29] good
[41:30] but in reality it's not going to do
[41:32] anything for you but cause death
[41:34] so if he can get you if satan can get
[41:36] you to reason
[41:38] and to make you think that he has
[41:39] something better for you to offer then
[41:41] he has you in his trap every time
[41:44] so satan is kind of constantly trying to
[41:47] sell you a a better life
[41:50] but in reality is this death
[41:53] and the more we can come to that
[41:54] realization that all he has for you is
[41:56] death
[41:57] the quicker we can get back to god's
[41:59] program and stay there
[42:01] so satan makes this program look so good
[42:04] it's like one of those contracts that
[42:05] looks like it will benefit you but in a
[42:07] real fine print there's many things that
[42:09] will harm you in the long run
[42:11] see satan never mentioned eve the
[42:13] consequences of making the decision and
[42:16] when he tries to tempt us he will use
[42:18] those same tactics to appeal the flesh
[42:21] he's using those same tactics to appeal
[42:23] to your flesh and my flesh it's no
[42:25] different just a different age he's
[42:26] going to use different tools but the
[42:28] same result is going to have in your
[42:30] life
[42:32] now satan's program caused that the
[42:33] begin at the beginning then guess what
[42:35] is going to keep causing death to
[42:37] mankind
[42:38] and
[42:39] the the thing what i don't understand
[42:41] why we keep doing is we keep trying to
[42:43] feed off of the tree of the knowledge of
[42:45] good and evil
[42:46] when god says it brings death we need to
[42:48] be feeding off the tree of life god is
[42:51] calling us to be back how we used to
[42:53] before the fall
[42:54] so why don't why are we not feeding more
[42:56] on the tree of of life
[42:58] it's going to bring life see god wants
[43:00] to restore you but he's not going to
[43:02] force himself upon you you have to make
[43:04] that decision to feed off the tree of
[43:07] life see eve she had a
[43:09] a decision she had an option she had a
[43:12] choice satan never forced her to make
[43:14] that choice
[43:15] she made that choice so each day that we
[43:18] wake up we have a choice whether we feed
[43:19] on the tree of life or the tree of the
[43:22] knowledge of good and evil and if you
[43:24] feed on that tree of knowledge good and
[43:25] evil you will lose the battle for today
[43:28] you can have a victorious life every day
[43:30] but what are you willing to put in to
[43:32] achieve that victorious life
[43:36] so the thing the devil has been so with
[43:38] the way to study them the devil has many
[43:40] years working on this program since the
[43:43] since the garden of eden he's been
[43:44] working on his program constantly trying
[43:46] to fine tune it
[43:47] and the thing is
[43:48] if we can realize that he satan knows
[43:50] your weaknesses
[43:52] so if you if you get from underneath the
[43:54] power of god then guess what he has you
[43:58] so we constantly have to stay connected
[44:01] in that vein of the holy ghost channel
[44:03] we constantly have to stay connected
[44:05] with each other to build one another to
[44:07] lift one another up
[44:09] that that's how the if we can do that
[44:11] then this chord will be gone then
[44:13] division will be gone a lot of times we
[44:16] have discord and division because we're
[44:17] not connected to one another and we
[44:19] assume things
[44:21] so here's some tools of the devil
[44:23] death destruction confusion discord and
[44:26] idleness things that he will not tell
[44:28] you about
[44:29] but you'll be doing them and not
[44:30] realizing it
[44:33] and we all realize the devil's kingdom
[44:34] is not divided
[44:36] if any kingdom is divided then it's
[44:38] going to fall and we'll read that in
[44:40] matthew 12.
[44:42] so it may look like satan is all over
[44:44] here and there but that's that's his his
[44:45] motive that's his goal is to get people
[44:47] divided and he's working together with
[44:49] his demons to get people divided
[44:53] matthew 12.
[44:56] i'll go with 25-26
[45:00] so it says we'll pick up
[45:02] and jesus knew their thoughts and said
[45:04] unto him every kingdom divided against
[45:07] itself is brought to desolation
[45:10] and every city or house divided against
[45:12] itself shall not stand so we as the body
[45:15] of christ need to stand together we need
[45:17] to come together in the unity of our
[45:20] lord and savior jesus christ if we want
[45:22] to stand
[45:24] and if satan cast out satan he is
[45:26] divided against himself how should that
[45:28] his kingdom stand
[45:30] and if i buy beelzebub cast out devils
[45:33] by whom do your children cast them out
[45:36] therefore shall they be your judges
[45:38] but if i cast out devils by the spirit
[45:40] of god then the kingdom of god is come
[45:43] unto you
[45:44] amen so the devil wants to pervert what
[45:48] god has created for good
[45:50] that's his motive
[45:52] he hates the very fact of what god does
[45:54] and he wanted to be like god and he
[45:56] realized that he couldn't
[45:58] so now he's trying to take everybody
[46:00] with him that he can so don't let him
[46:02] take you don't let him distract you like
[46:04] he distract eve
[46:06] because even adam was the son of god
[46:08] made perfect and he had that choice
[46:10] god didn't force to make their choice
[46:12] but he made that choice to listen to his
[46:14] wife
[46:15] and you have the choice whether you want
[46:16] to listen to satan or not
[46:18] you kick kick the enemy out of your mind
[46:21] don't don't let your mind be a devil's
[46:22] playground
[46:25] so that's his motive he wants to give
[46:27] you counterfeit and now as we said if
[46:29] you go to the bank and give them
[46:31] counterfeit money they will not receive
[46:33] it no matter how bad you beg and plead
[46:35] well i got this from somewhere they
[46:37] can't accept it because it's counterfeit
[46:39] and god is not going to accept a
[46:41] counterfeit relationship
[46:43] he's not
[46:44] god is looking for he in fact he refuses
[46:47] to accept it he's not going to accept
[46:49] your lukewarm relationship and neither
[46:51] is he going to accept my
[46:54] do not take the easy street take the
[46:56] straight and narrow any other way than
[46:58] through him is a false way
[47:01] we have we have come too far to give god
[47:04] not our best he deserves our best every
[47:06] day
[47:07] he deserves your best and my best no
[47:09] matter how you're feeling
[47:11] or what you're going through he deserves
[47:12] your best
[47:14] in fact i believe the the growth really
[47:16] happens when we don't feel like serving
[47:18] them that's when you press in because we
[47:20] said last week it's easy to press in
[47:23] when you have all the extra time in the
[47:25] world when you have you're on vacation
[47:28] that's the easiest time to do it but
[47:29] when everything's
[47:30] falling apart the walls the building the
[47:33] the tire blew up if you can still praise
[47:35] him and worship him see praise and
[47:37] worship isn't just lifting your hands as
[47:38] we said it's a life that you live that's
[47:41] praise and worship
[47:43] let's go to matthew 7 a couple pages
[47:45] over
[47:46] very familiar scripture we uh read verse
[47:49] 21 to 23 but we're going to read 13-14
[47:52] in matthew 7.
[47:54] so it says enter ye in at the straight
[47:56] gate
[47:57] straight gate for wide is the gate and
[48:00] broad is the way that lead to
[48:01] destruction see the broad way it feels
[48:04] good to your flesh it looks good every
[48:06] man's right in his own eyes right
[48:09] but the broad way is going to lead to
[48:12] death and destruction and may there be
[48:14] what's going there at because straight
[48:15] is the gate and narrow is the way and
[48:18] check this out which leadeth unto life
[48:20] and few there be that find it
[48:24] so it shows me i need to be constantly
[48:28] looking the way that i'm going i can't
[48:30] assume that i'm going to straighten
[48:31] there away
[48:33] i need to be constantly checking my
[48:35] motives daily i need to be looking and
[48:37] what direction am i going what is my
[48:39] purpose in this life am i just living
[48:41] life or am i actually
[48:43] doing the purpose that the lord has
[48:44] called me to go
[48:47] so let's keep going praise god let's go
[48:48] to proverbs 14 12. we just read that
[48:50] we'll read it again
[49:03] 14 12. there is a way which seemeth
[49:05] right unto a man but the end thereof are
[49:08] the ways of death so there's many people
[49:10] that are going to go the the broad way
[49:12] the wide way and they thought that it
[49:13] was a good way they thought of it they
[49:15] they probably were even reading the word
[49:16] every day and praying
[49:18] but in reality it led to death so
[49:21] there's going to be many good people in
[49:22] hell there's going to be many so-called
[49:24] christians in hell there's going to be
[49:26] many people that had good intentions to
[49:27] be a christian
[49:29] but just good good intentions alone will
[49:31] not get the job done
[49:33] because you can have a good idea but
[49:34] never manifest that idea
[49:37] so the thing is don't wait until
[49:38] tomorrow your life's a vapor
[49:42] praise god
[49:45] so revelations chapter three so we're
[49:47] living in a laodicean age one of the
[49:49] hardest ages to overcome but not
[49:52] impossible there's if we're going
[49:54] through god nothing's impossible
[49:58] it all depends your attitude your
[49:59] attitude is so important if you want to
[50:01] have an overcoming an overcoming life
[50:03] your attitude is either going to cause
[50:06] you to succeed or to fail
[50:09] so let's go to chapter 3 verse 14.
[50:12] unto the angel of the church of the lay
[50:14] of the saints write these things
[50:16] saith the amen
[50:18] the faithful and true witness the
[50:20] beginning of the creation of god i know
[50:23] thy works that thou art neither cold nor
[50:25] hot
[50:27] i would that were cold or hot
[50:29] so then because thou art lukewarm and
[50:32] neither cold nor hot i will spew thee
[50:34] out of my mouth
[50:36] because thou says i am rich
[50:38] and increased with goods and have need
[50:40] of nothing and know us not that thou are
[50:42] wretched and miserable and poor and
[50:44] blind and naked
[50:45] so if you wake up and do not crucify
[50:47] your flesh you said you you are saying
[50:49] you are in need of nothing you're good
[50:50] to go i'm good i'm good to go lord for
[50:52] the day i don't need you today that's
[50:53] what you're saying
[50:54] i'm not trying to me but that's what
[50:56] you're saying
[50:58] thou wretched and miserable poor blind
[51:00] and naked if you saw me on the street
[51:02] and i was naked you would want to say
[51:03] something to me
[51:05] right
[51:06] so why are we walking around naked
[51:09] without the lord each day we choose not
[51:11] to crucify our flesh that's what you're
[51:13] doing you're walking around naked and
[51:14] you're blind you don't even know it
[51:16] i counseled you to buy of me gold tried
[51:19] in the fire he's called he's counseling
[51:22] us
[51:22] that thou mayest be rich and white and
[51:25] remnant that thou mayest be clothed and
[51:27] at the shame of thy nakedness do not
[51:29] appear
[51:30] and anoint thy eyes with eyes said thou
[51:32] may see verse 19 as many as i love i
[51:36] rebuke and chase and he says be zealous
[51:38] therefore and repent so repentance every
[51:40] day is a key don't just wait to the end
[51:43] of the day
[51:44] but repent throughout the day because
[51:46] we're constantly making mistakes we're
[51:48] constantly doing things we shouldn't be
[51:49] doing
[51:50] and we need to be repenting on a daily
[51:52] basis don't just say i'm gonna repent on
[51:53] sunday and then i'm gonna wait until
[51:55] next sunday it doesn't work that way
[51:58] verse 20. so right now he's standing at
[52:00] the door behold i stay at the door and
[52:02] knock
[52:04] if any man hear my voice
[52:06] any man he doesn't he doesn't say just a
[52:08] jews a gentile he doesn't say it's the
[52:10] jews just brother ron or the sister
[52:12] laurie but anyone
[52:15] open the door and i will come into him
[52:17] and will sup with him and he with me
[52:20] to him that overcometh allah grant to
[52:22] sit with me in my throne
[52:24] even as i also overcame and set down
[52:27] with my father in his throne verse 22 is
[52:30] so key he that hath an ear
[52:32] let him hear what the spirit is saying
[52:34] to the churches let's go to matthew 11.
[52:37] i noticed jesus mentioned that a lot of
[52:39] times you know in this in the gospel
[52:41] about heath that hath an ear
[52:43] so
[52:44] we have to have ears we have to pray
[52:46] lord give me ears to hear
[52:48] because our carnal ears is not going to
[52:50] get the job done we need spiritual ears
[52:53] to be able to hear god's word
[52:56] so verse 11 uh sorry matthew 11 verse
[52:59] and from the days of the john the
[53:01] baptist until now the kingdom of heaven
[53:04] suffereth violence and the violent take
[53:06] it by force for all the prophets and all
[53:08] the law prophesied until john
[53:11] and if you will receive it this is lies
[53:13] i'm so glad that he sent elias in this
[53:15] day and age was for to come
[53:18] and check this out and he that hath ears
[53:20] to hear let them hear
[53:21] so god is speaking to us right now
[53:24] but if we're not in the right spiritual
[53:26] state then we can't receive it
[53:29] so as i said on wednesday it's so
[53:30] important every time the door is open
[53:32] you need to constantly be preparing your
[53:34] heart so that ground can be that good
[53:36] ground as jesus spoke of in matthew
[53:39] chapter 13
[53:40] because the good ground is the only
[53:41] ground that fruit's going to produce
[53:44] every other ground
[53:45] the cares of life choke the word out the
[53:47] thorns choked it choked it out
[53:49] so we can't let
[53:51] our busy lives choke the word of god out
[53:53] in our life
[53:55] so we'll go to matthew 13 a couple uh
[53:57] scriptures over
[53:58] and we're going to see jesus say this
[54:00] again talking about ears
[54:02] so in verse 9 it says
[54:04] who hath ears to hear
[54:06] let him hear
[54:08] and the disciples came and said unto him
[54:10] why speakest thou unto them in parables
[54:13] and he answered and said to them because
[54:15] it is given unto you it's given to you
[54:18] to know the mysteries of the kingdom of
[54:20] heaven but to them it is not given
[54:23] for whosoever hath to him shall be given
[54:26] and he shall have more abundance
[54:29] but whosoever hath not from him shall be
[54:31] taken away
[54:33] even that he hath verse 13
[54:36] therefore speak out of them in parables
[54:38] because they seeing see not
[54:40] in hearing they hear not neither do they
[54:43] understand and in them is fulfilled the
[54:45] prophecy of isaias which saith by
[54:47] hearing ye shall hear
[54:49] and shall not understand and seeing you
[54:51] shall see and shall not perceive
[54:53] for the people's heart is wax gross and
[54:55] their ears are dull of hearing
[54:57] in their eyes
[54:58] they have clothes at any time they
[55:00] should see with their eyes and hear with
[55:01] their ears and should understand with
[55:03] their heart and should be converted look
[55:05] at that converted again
[55:06] and i should heal them but blessed are
[55:08] your eyes
[55:10] for they see in your ears for they hear
[55:13] verse 17 for verily i say unto you that
[55:15] many prophets and righteous men have
[55:17] desire to see those things which you see
[55:20] check that out
[55:22] many prophets and righteous men so why
[55:24] are we just coming to church and
[55:25] plopping in the sea
[55:27] why are we doing that
[55:29] many many people in the bible want to
[55:31] see these things that we see we're
[55:33] coming to the closing of the age
[55:35] we're coming to the close to the rapture
[55:37] so why are we lazy why are we just
[55:39] limping to the finish line we should be
[55:41] finishing strong jesus said he that
[55:43] endureth unto the end not he that
[55:45] endured to the beginning you got to hold
[55:47] steadfast your confidence from the
[55:48] beginning to the end you got to be
[55:51] pressing into the kingdom of god daily
[55:53] fighting every inch every mile putting
[55:56] the full armor of god on that's the only
[55:58] way you're going to win this battle
[56:00] if you going to war we said wednesday
[56:02] and you're not properly uh fitted with
[56:04] the right attire you're going to lose
[56:07] you've got to follow the chief captain's
[56:09] orders on a daily basis
[56:11] he's given us orders he's given us
[56:13] commandments
[56:15] and we have to follow them
[56:16] don't don't just pick a day to take off
[56:18] i'm gonna take wednesday i'm gonna take
[56:19] thursday off but no work hard seven days
[56:21] a week
[56:22] that's what's gonna get your results
[56:27] but rarely i say unto you that many
[56:29] prophets and righteous men have desired
[56:31] to see those things which you see and
[56:33] have not seen them and to hear those
[56:35] things which you hear and have not heard
[56:37] them
[56:38] praise god
[56:39] so we talked about god has a program and
[56:41] he created before the foundation in the
[56:43] world he knew that mankind was going to
[56:45] fall
[56:46] and the program he's given to us
[56:49] is to restore you so he can use you
[56:52] and satan has a program in this to bring
[56:54] you like we said before undercover death
[56:56] the program that satan has is that
[56:58] stimulates your carnal flesh to give you
[57:01] entertainment
[57:02] to get you to follow most of the work
[57:05] that's the dangerous part but not all of
[57:06] it just like he did to eve eve could say
[57:09] i followed most of god's word
[57:11] but god didn't
[57:12] call us to follow most of the word he's
[57:14] called us to follow all of the word
[57:17] so like it's not a math test it's not a
[57:19] gpa a 3.9.999
[57:22] we need a 4.0 gpa every time
[57:25] all a's
[57:28] so
[57:29] he wants to he wants you to enjoy the
[57:31] pleasure of sin for a season in fact
[57:32] moses
[57:34] in his uh
[57:35] commentary
[57:37] he didn't want to he didn't choose his
[57:39] pleasures of sin for a season he chose
[57:41] the reproaches of god he chose the
[57:43] harder way because he knew that the sin
[57:45] for a season would only last for a
[57:47] season and then his destination would be
[57:49] hell but he knew that if he went god's
[57:51] provided way
[57:53] it was the right way it may have been
[57:55] the harder way but it was the way that's
[57:57] going to be worth it in the end of your
[57:58] life
[57:59] because in any if you take satan's way
[58:01] you may be rich maybe famous
[58:04] but when you come into god's judgment
[58:06] throne you can't say well god i live the
[58:08] best life you know i i gave to the poor
[58:10] sometimes but that's not going to matter
[58:13] we read in first corinthians 13 you can
[58:15] give to the poor your body can be burned
[58:17] but if you have not charity you can't
[58:19] even enter in the king you can't even
[58:20] enter in as our prophet said
[58:23] so notice in the garden what we said
[58:26] before there is some it's consequences
[58:28] eve made a decision and it directly
[58:29] impacted you and me
[58:31] to the future years
[58:33] and each decision that you make today is
[58:35] going to affect your family it's going
[58:37] to affect the body of christ here
[58:40] so it's so important when you're making
[58:42] a decision don't just make it
[58:44] willy-nilly
[58:45] you think about it you write it down
[58:47] write the pros and cons of it you pray
[58:49] about it most importantly
[58:53] so he painted eve a picture and the
[58:55] thing is it was
[58:57] how good it was to partake from the tree
[58:59] he painted such a good picture that tree
[59:01] just he he advertised it to her he blew
[59:04] it up how good it was you could be as
[59:06] guys knowing good and evil and she was
[59:08] eating it up
[59:10] but the thing is he's still doing the
[59:12] same thing today
[59:13] he's still trying to
[59:14] how he's still trying to portray how
[59:16] good this tree is
[59:18] it's going to get you fame it's going to
[59:19] get you fortune you have a high position
[59:22] in the church
[59:23] everybody can look at you
[59:25] and if it sounds all good to the flesh
[59:28] but what it's doing is is feeding your
[59:30] pride and god hates pride he hates a
[59:33] proud look
[59:35] god is a million miles away from pride
[59:37] and pride comes from the devil so i
[59:39] don't want to be anywhere the devil is
[59:41] i don't want to be like him not even one
[59:42] iota
[59:47] amen so the thing is a lot of times we
[59:50] keep making these same decisions and
[59:52] they
[59:53] the same outcome failure
[59:55] we have to stop making the same
[59:57] decisions
[59:58] and we have to rethink what we're
[1:00:00] thinking
[1:00:02] because god is trying to change the way
[1:00:03] we think he says my ways are not your
[1:00:05] ways and my thoughts are not your
[1:00:06] thoughts
[1:00:07] so not every thought you think is you're
[1:00:08] thinking like god that's why you have to
[1:00:10] try that thought it says in john
[1:00:13] 1 john 4 1.
[1:00:15] so each day you have a choice of what
[1:00:17] program you follow are you following
[1:00:20] after the spirit or are you following
[1:00:21] after the flesh it's one of the others
[1:00:23] not in between not mixed
[1:00:26] it's one thing to know that satan has a
[1:00:28] program it's one thing and it's good to
[1:00:29] know that but if you're still going this
[1:00:31] program then what's the point of even
[1:00:33] knowing that information
[1:00:34] so it's like you
[1:00:36] know you have a math test but you didn't
[1:00:38] take any time to study it
[1:00:39] you're gonna fail most of the time you
[1:00:41] might get lucky but i'm not here for
[1:00:43] luck
[1:00:45] i'm here but we're here for we're here
[1:00:46] to receive what god has for us let's go
[1:00:49] to first peter chapter five
[1:00:52] man time flies
[1:00:56] first peter 5.
[1:01:03] and we'll start reverse five
[1:01:05] likewise younger submit yourselves unto
[1:01:08] the elder
[1:01:10] so not just it's talking about me but
[1:01:12] yeah all of you be subject one children
[1:01:14] so it's calling all of us to be subject
[1:01:15] in one to another
[1:01:18] so younger older in between
[1:01:22] and be clothed with humility for god
[1:01:24] resisted the proud so it's so important
[1:01:26] humility if you want to get somewhere
[1:01:28] with god a humble and contrite spirit in
[1:01:31] no wise will despise
[1:01:33] god is looking for a vessel that will
[1:01:35] lay down before his feet and say lord
[1:01:37] use me lord i'm here
[1:01:39] for you and only you
[1:01:41] whatever your will be for my life let it
[1:01:44] be
[1:01:44] and verse six says humble yourselves so
[1:01:47] you have to humble yourself
[1:01:49] not not brother john not sister and they
[1:01:51] can't humble yourself you have to humble
[1:01:52] yourself
[1:01:54] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[1:01:55] and he may exalt you into time he's
[1:01:57] going to exalt you in due time don't
[1:01:58] exalt yourself
[1:02:00] exalt him
[1:02:01] says casting all your care upon him for
[1:02:03] he careth for you
[1:02:05] so it says be so be sober and be
[1:02:07] vigilant i look the word up sober
[1:02:10] is regular
[1:02:11] calm not under the influence of passion
[1:02:14] as sober judge judgment so when you're
[1:02:17] sober
[1:02:18] you know when somebody is drunk
[1:02:20] they're not they're not sober under the
[1:02:22] influence they they see things in a
[1:02:24] different way they're distracted so when
[1:02:26] you're
[1:02:27] drunk on the things of satan you're not
[1:02:29] going to be able to see things in your
[1:02:30] life things are going to slip the marker
[1:02:32] is going to get moved
[1:02:34] and you may not recognize it right away
[1:02:37] but in the end what it's going to do to
[1:02:38] you is going to cause big destruction
[1:02:40] and you're going to be going down a
[1:02:42] broad way
[1:02:44] and that's why the scripture is telling
[1:02:45] us to be sober and he says vigilant i
[1:02:47] watched i looked that word up as well it
[1:02:49] says watchful
[1:02:50] circumspect a tentative to discover and
[1:02:53] avoid danger so when you're sober and
[1:02:56] vigilant you're constantly going to be
[1:02:58] looking
[1:03:00] for the things
[1:03:02] of satan because satan has devices
[1:03:05] hey ben
[1:03:06] can you wake luke up for me
[1:03:09] shouldn't be sleeping in church
[1:03:11] gotta be awake
[1:03:14] so you're sober and vigilant
[1:03:16] so like i said before you're constantly
[1:03:18] looking you're constantly watching
[1:03:20] looking around corners because you know
[1:03:22] your enemy is cunning and crafting and
[1:03:23] he's smarter than you
[1:03:25] but when you're sober and vigilant
[1:03:26] you're in the spirit
[1:03:28] and god's gonna let think you can you
[1:03:30] could see things that normally you
[1:03:31] wouldn't see with your own carnal eyes
[1:03:34] because the current lie we don't serve
[1:03:36] god by
[1:03:37] carnality
[1:03:38] we serve them in the spirit
[1:03:40] cardinality would only get you to be a
[1:03:43] nominal christian
[1:03:45] they go to church wednesdays and sundays
[1:03:47] but that word is not lived out they just
[1:03:49] they just slap their name on the book
[1:03:52] so let's just keep going so notice it
[1:03:54] says casting all your cares upon him and
[1:03:56] the thing is if you don't cast all your
[1:03:58] cares upon him
[1:03:59] then the cares of this life will eat you
[1:04:02] up and your walk with god will be choked
[1:04:04] out and you won't have a walk
[1:04:06] so that's why even jesus said in matthew
[1:04:08] 11.
[1:04:09] come on come on to me all you they're
[1:04:11] heavy late and i will give you rest and
[1:04:13] notice he wants to give you rest of the
[1:04:14] soul if we don't have rest of the soul
[1:04:17] we can't have a walk
[1:04:19] because because god is trying to restore
[1:04:22] what's in here he didn't come to save
[1:04:24] these bodies we have a body waiting for
[1:04:26] us
[1:04:27] that's not that's not corrupted it's
[1:04:30] perfect and we're gonna be just like him
[1:04:32] but until that time that space we have
[1:04:35] work to do
[1:04:36] there's things that we need to be doing
[1:04:38] in this in this life like i said before
[1:04:40] we have a church body we need to be
[1:04:42] connecting there's lost sheep out there
[1:04:45] we need to be witnessing to
[1:04:47] and your life is going to do so much
[1:04:48] more than you cramming scriptures down
[1:04:50] somebody's throat your life should prove
[1:04:53] what you are
[1:04:54] you should be a living epistle as paul
[1:04:56] said
[1:04:57] that's how you're going to win somebody
[1:04:59] over the love of god should be ready got
[1:05:01] radiating out of you on a daily basis as
[1:05:04] brother boaz said you're that revival
[1:05:06] you bring that revival to somebody
[1:05:08] you bring life to somebody
[1:05:10] i remember the disciples they wanted to
[1:05:12] uh cast uh didn't elias cast fire down
[1:05:15] he said i didn't come to destroy men's
[1:05:17] lives i come to save them
[1:05:20] so we had that same authority through
[1:05:22] jesus christ to save lives you can
[1:05:24] create love in a situation create peace
[1:05:26] create happiness a soft answer turneth
[1:05:29] away wrath
[1:05:31] it's not you that's saying it but the
[1:05:33] holy ghost through you that's doing it
[1:05:35] but if you're not connected to the holy
[1:05:36] ghost and it's you and you're going to
[1:05:38] cause death in somebody's life
[1:05:42] so a big part of satan's program is to
[1:05:44] get you distracted
[1:05:46] that's what he wants to do to distract
[1:05:48] you any way he can it could be the cares
[1:05:50] of life to put little to no effort in
[1:05:53] or to make you so busy that you don't
[1:05:54] have time for anything or just to get
[1:05:56] through or go through the motions well
[1:05:58] i'm gonna go on my knees and pray
[1:06:00] tonight
[1:06:01] about about 10 minutes i give god at
[1:06:02] least 10 minutes it's better than zero
[1:06:04] minutes i'm gonna read once i'm gonna
[1:06:06] read one chapter in my bible today and
[1:06:08] i'm gonna read it i'm doing my christian
[1:06:10] duties i'm a good i'm a good christian
[1:06:12] good message believer no
[1:06:14] can't be doing that it'd be better for
[1:06:16] you not to do it at all like i said like
[1:06:18] i said on wednesday you get on your
[1:06:20] knees don't make a time limit just say
[1:06:22] lord i'm here
[1:06:24] when you're reading the word lord where
[1:06:25] would you want me to read that lord
[1:06:27] please bring this word to life i don't
[1:06:29] want to just read this and forget about
[1:06:30] it as i go my day i want this word that
[1:06:32] i read i want to bring it to life
[1:06:37] and then finish uh the scripture we'll
[1:06:39] go to verse 9 or verse 8. be sober and
[1:06:42] be vigilant because your adversary the
[1:06:44] devil as a roaring lion walketh about
[1:06:46] seeking whom he may devour the devil
[1:06:48] wants to devour you he wants to put
[1:06:50] destruction discord in your life
[1:06:53] so we said before if you're not sober
[1:06:54] and vigilant then he's gonna have a
[1:06:56] field day in your life
[1:06:57] he's gonna take spit you up and keep
[1:07:00] doing it
[1:07:03] verse 10
[1:07:04] or verse nine whom resists steadfast in
[1:07:07] the faith knowing the same afflictions
[1:07:09] are accomplishing your brother and the
[1:07:10] world he's doing it not just in your
[1:07:12] life my everybody's life he's trying to
[1:07:14] do it in he's trying to start each one
[1:07:16] of us
[1:07:17] well if we can unite together i say
[1:07:19] prayer is so key
[1:07:20] if you want to defeat satan prayer is so
[1:07:22] key
[1:07:24] you need prayer you have to
[1:07:27] it says draw an eye to god and he'll
[1:07:28] draw an eye to you
[1:07:32] go to romans 7 14.
[1:07:40] actually i think i missed something
[1:07:41] actually
[1:07:42] okay
[1:07:45] i mean one second
[1:07:46] all right let's go back to i'm sorry go
[1:07:48] back to first peter 5 10 is something i
[1:07:50] want to point out
[1:07:52] but the god of all grace who hath called
[1:07:54] us unto us eternal glory by christ jesus
[1:07:57] after you have suffered a while make you
[1:07:59] perfect establish strengthen and settle
[1:08:01] you
[1:08:02] so i was reading that so notice in order
[1:08:04] to be perfect established strengthen
[1:08:06] and settle you
[1:08:08] suffering is required
[1:08:10] you have to suffer
[1:08:12] in order
[1:08:13] for that that christ-like character to
[1:08:15] come out
[1:08:16] so if you want to be established you
[1:08:19] have to get in the presence of god
[1:08:21] it's going to cause pain to your flesh
[1:08:24] every time because your flesh doesn't
[1:08:25] want to take the time to spend time with
[1:08:27] god it wants just to you to open the
[1:08:30] bible and put it away
[1:08:32] so the thing is there must come it's the
[1:08:33] right kind of suffering
[1:08:35] the kind of suffering that's going to
[1:08:36] bring christ-like character brother
[1:08:38] branham said character is a victory god
[1:08:41] is not going to hand you in a silver
[1:08:42] platter here you go here's character but
[1:08:44] you have to fight every inch and every
[1:08:46] ground you notice in world war ii they
[1:08:48] had to fight for every inch and every
[1:08:50] ground and that's in the natural so what
[1:08:52] makes you thinking the spirits you want
[1:08:53] to fight for every inch and every ground
[1:08:55] because the greatest battle ever fought
[1:08:57] is inside your mind right now you have
[1:08:59] the decision either to accept what's
[1:09:01] being preached or to reject it
[1:09:03] and it's going to prove when you leave
[1:09:05] these doors it's going to prove if you
[1:09:07] were accepted or rejected it monday is
[1:09:09] going to prove are you going to just
[1:09:11] go about your daily business and forget
[1:09:13] all about god and then come back
[1:09:14] wednesday because right there you just
[1:09:16] proved to me that you rejected the word
[1:09:18] of god
[1:09:20] you choose who you serve today as for me
[1:09:22] me and my house we're going to serve the
[1:09:23] lord
[1:09:25] so go to romans 7.
[1:09:28] praise god romans 7.
[1:09:32] so constantly every day we have a war
[1:09:34] that's going inside of us daily
[1:09:36] counseling your spirit man and your
[1:09:37] colonel man are constantly clashing one
[1:09:40] another and whatever you feed there's a
[1:09:41] black dog and a white dog that's inside
[1:09:43] of you
[1:09:44] and whatever you're feeding on for that
[1:09:46] day is what's going to be is going to
[1:09:48] manifest that dog
[1:09:50] see that white dog is your spirit man
[1:09:52] jesus said watch and pray he said the
[1:09:55] spirit is willing
[1:09:56] but the flesh is weak so if you're
[1:09:58] feeding on the flesh and your spirit man
[1:10:00] is gonna be malnourished
[1:10:02] so if i don't eat i'm gonna be i'm gonna
[1:10:04] be malnourished if i don't eat in the
[1:10:06] spirit i'm gonna be spiritually
[1:10:07] malnourished so you gotta have a healthy
[1:10:10] spiritual diet you need to be listening
[1:10:12] to the tapes
[1:10:14] studying the tapes don't just put a tape
[1:10:15] on to listen to it but you take the time
[1:10:17] lord what are you trying to say to me
[1:10:19] through your prophet
[1:10:21] lord while i'm reading this word what
[1:10:22] are you trying to speak to me this is a
[1:10:24] love letter that's written back to me
[1:10:26] help me to receive that love letter
[1:10:27] write the laws upon my heart and upon my
[1:10:29] mind
[1:10:31] and that's how it has to be has to be
[1:10:32] that has to be that serious
[1:10:35] we can't just be
[1:10:37] barely skating by god didn't call you
[1:10:40] and fill you with the holy ghost for you
[1:10:41] is to skate by
[1:10:43] he's called you to live a victorious
[1:10:45] life that will win souls
[1:10:48] what's the talents that he's giving you
[1:10:50] how are you using them
[1:10:51] what are you using them for
[1:10:53] there's probably like sister cheryl said
[1:10:55] there's probably talents in this church
[1:10:57] that we're scared to use
[1:10:59] why are we scared you give it back to
[1:11:00] god and say lord let me use this gift
[1:11:03] this talent that you've given to me
[1:11:06] it's going to use it for the kingdom of
[1:11:07] god use it for the glory of god
[1:11:09] there's many people many artists music
[1:11:11] musicians who are using their talent for
[1:11:14] the satan
[1:11:15] and making money with it
[1:11:19] let us use our gifts and our talents and
[1:11:21] we think that gifts and talents are just
[1:11:23] singing you have a gift of help you can
[1:11:26] have you can be be a people person
[1:11:28] that's a wonderful way to win a soul
[1:11:30] get to paul said i became all things to
[1:11:32] all men that i might win some
[1:11:36] praise god
[1:11:38] i forgot where i was at set oh roman
[1:11:40] seven or yeah romans seven and go to 14.
[1:11:43] so it says
[1:11:44] for we know that the law is spiritual
[1:11:46] but i am carnal soul under sin i think
[1:11:49] if we would just come to realization
[1:11:50] that every day we'll realize
[1:11:52] that the law that i'm i'm carnal and i
[1:11:55] need to get into god's presence if i
[1:11:57] want to be effective in his kingdom
[1:11:59] for that which i do i allow not for that
[1:12:01] what i would that do i not but what i
[1:12:04] hate
[1:12:05] that do i so is that constant that's
[1:12:06] that battle he's trying to tell us
[1:12:08] that's going on
[1:12:09] if then i do that which i would not i
[1:12:11] can sit unto the law that is good
[1:12:13] now there is no more i that do it but
[1:12:15] sin that dwelt in me
[1:12:17] for i know that in me that is in my
[1:12:19] flesh dwelt no good thing see paul
[1:12:21] realized
[1:12:22] that in his flesh there's no good thing
[1:12:26] for to will is present with me but how
[1:12:28] to perform that which is good i find not
[1:12:30] for the good that i would i do not but
[1:12:33] the evil i would not that i do now if i
[1:12:36] do that i would not it is no more i that
[1:12:39] do it but sin that dwell within me
[1:12:41] said i find the law that when i would do
[1:12:43] good evil is present with me for right
[1:12:45] here's the key right here frauds light
[1:12:47] in the law of god after the inward man
[1:12:50] if you try to do the if you try to do
[1:12:52] god's laws and commandments with the
[1:12:54] flesh
[1:12:55] you're going to fail every time
[1:12:57] we see in the bible the children of
[1:12:58] israel they failed every time
[1:13:00] god would have to send a judge a prophet
[1:13:02] to bring them back on things they would
[1:13:04] always go back in to their old carnal
[1:13:06] ways
[1:13:08] and the same thing with us if you're
[1:13:09] trying to serve god
[1:13:11] in the flesh the same thing is going to
[1:13:13] happen to you
[1:13:15] that's why do everything in the spirit
[1:13:16] pray in the spirit
[1:13:18] sing in the spirit do everything in the
[1:13:20] spirit
[1:13:22] verse 23 but i see another law in my
[1:13:25] members warning against the law of my
[1:13:27] mind
[1:13:28] bringing me into the captivity of the
[1:13:30] law of sin which is in my members verse
[1:13:32] 24 o wretched man that i am
[1:13:34] who shall deliver me from the body of
[1:13:36] this death
[1:13:37] i thank god through jesus christ our
[1:13:39] lord so with the law so with the
[1:13:42] so with the mind i myself serve the law
[1:13:44] of god both the flesh the law of sin
[1:13:47] and go to romans 8
[1:13:50] verse 5
[1:13:52] so for they that after the flesh do you
[1:13:54] mind the things of the flesh but they
[1:13:56] that are after the spirit the things of
[1:13:58] the spirit so verse 6 right here for to
[1:14:01] be carnally minded is death
[1:14:03] so each time you're in your carnal
[1:14:05] mindset
[1:14:06] death
[1:14:09] for is not subject to the law of god
[1:14:12] neither in indeed can be
[1:14:15] so we
[1:14:16] if you're in the flesh in church right
[1:14:17] now then
[1:14:19] you are harming
[1:14:20] the working of god in your life
[1:14:23] verse 8
[1:14:25] so then they there in the flesh cannot
[1:14:27] please god you can't even please god
[1:14:29] even a man at his best is vanity think
[1:14:31] about that a dirty rag even the
[1:14:33] scripture says
[1:14:35] so you can be a good little message
[1:14:37] believer in the in carnality and do no
[1:14:40] no good in your life in fact you're
[1:14:42] further away from god than when you
[1:14:43] started actually
[1:14:47] verse 8 or verse 9 but you're not in the
[1:14:49] flesh but in the spirit if so be it the
[1:14:52] spirit of god dwell within you now if
[1:14:54] any man have not the spirit of christ he
[1:14:56] is none of his
[1:14:58] amen let's keep going
[1:15:00] so your flesh and my flesh are the same
[1:15:02] they are lazy
[1:15:04] and want to go satan's program the easy
[1:15:06] street as we would say the way of least
[1:15:09] resistance right
[1:15:11] and so it's so important this little
[1:15:12] quota
[1:15:14] i think i made up i think
[1:15:15] but the more areas that you can be
[1:15:17] disciplined in the less chances you're
[1:15:18] being lazy in other areas so how you do
[1:15:20] anything is how you do everything
[1:15:22] so if you're a lazy businessman if you
[1:15:24] have a lazy prayer life lazy and all
[1:15:27] these kind of areas they're going to
[1:15:28] eventually trick over into your
[1:15:29] spiritual life
[1:15:30] so it's so important to make yourself
[1:15:32] disciplined
[1:15:33] and we'll read that in 2nd corinthians
[1:15:34] 10.
[1:15:40] second corinthians 10 verse 1.
[1:15:42] now i paul beseech you by the meekness
[1:15:44] and gentleness
[1:15:46] of christ who in the presence am i
[1:15:49] based among you but being absent and
[1:15:52] bold towards you but i beseech you
[1:15:56] but i beseech you
[1:15:59] that i may not be bold i am present with
[1:16:01] that confidence wherewith i think to be
[1:16:02] bold against some
[1:16:04] with some think of us as we walked
[1:16:06] according to the flesh verse three for
[1:16:08] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:16:09] war after the flesh we may be in his
[1:16:11] fleshly bodies but it gives us no green
[1:16:13] past to live
[1:16:14] in cardinality no green pass
[1:16:18] for the weapons of our warfare are not
[1:16:20] carnal
[1:16:21] but mighty
[1:16:22] through god to the pulling downs of
[1:16:24] strongholds in your strongholds says
[1:16:27] five casting down all imaginations and
[1:16:30] every high thing that exalted itself
[1:16:31] against the knowledge of god and bring
[1:16:34] it to captivity every thought
[1:16:36] every thought not just one here one
[1:16:38] there but every thought to the obedience
[1:16:40] of christ
[1:16:41] and having in readiness to revenge all
[1:16:44] disobedience when your obedience is
[1:16:46] fulfilled
[1:16:48] do you look on things after the outward
[1:16:50] appearance if any man trust to himself
[1:16:52] that he is christ let himself think this
[1:16:54] again
[1:16:55] that as he is a he is christ even so we
[1:16:58] are christ
[1:17:00] so this is from satan's eden uh 1965-829
[1:17:04] then when he went to take a little rest
[1:17:06] his enemies slipped in with the seat and
[1:17:08] took it over by misinterpreting his
[1:17:10] program to his children
[1:17:13] so
[1:17:14] satan's trying to do the same thing in
[1:17:15] your life he's trying to get you to
[1:17:16] misinterpret god's word well god
[1:17:19] meant this
[1:17:20] but no when god says something he means
[1:17:22] it he doesn't need you to interpret it
[1:17:24] he doesn't need you to to
[1:17:27] try to put your own little twist around
[1:17:29] it
[1:17:30] now if we notice satan is always trying
[1:17:32] to improve his tactics you ever notice
[1:17:34] uh say you like this like a candy bar
[1:17:37] says new and improved recipe why do they
[1:17:39] mess it up because they usually mess the
[1:17:41] recipe up when they do that
[1:17:42] or even like a new and improved scent we
[1:17:44] have a new improved computer all these
[1:17:46] things see satan is constantly trying to
[1:17:47] evolve
[1:17:49] god doesn't need to evolve he says i
[1:17:50] change not
[1:17:52] so why are we always trying to go the
[1:17:55] way satan is trying to go see if you
[1:17:56] look at technology in the last 15 years
[1:17:59] satan has become an advertiser he's
[1:18:01] trying to push things down your throat
[1:18:03] he's trying to push his agenda we got
[1:18:04] lgb q t r z x y z
[1:18:07] and everything you see they're trying to
[1:18:09] push the agenda and say satan's behind
[1:18:12] it
[1:18:13] and the enemy has become a marketer
[1:18:15] nowadays for most companies to survive
[1:18:17] they have to use marketing
[1:18:19] and now satan has become an advertiser
[1:18:21] using billboards
[1:18:23] sex sales using women to sell things
[1:18:27] i was a kid i used to watch all kind of
[1:18:29] commercials like cereal commercials and
[1:18:31] that influences you to go to your
[1:18:32] parents like hey mom can i have this new
[1:18:34] cereal and that's what satan's trying to
[1:18:36] get you he's trying to influence you so
[1:18:38] you can influence someone else with his
[1:18:40] program
[1:18:41] that's what he's doing having a bad
[1:18:43] attitude you're causing somebody to be
[1:18:45] influenced by your attitude and that's
[1:18:47] satan behind that so basically satan is
[1:18:49] using your vessel to influence another
[1:18:51] vessel think about that so next time you
[1:18:53] have a bad attitude i want you to think
[1:18:54] about that
[1:18:59] so the carnal flesh will always want to
[1:19:02] gravitate to satan's program because the
[1:19:04] natures are the same so if you're in
[1:19:05] cardinality you're just like satan at
[1:19:07] that time
[1:19:09] think about that
[1:19:11] so we can see why jesus said we must
[1:19:14] crucify the flesh daily luke 9.
[1:19:17] i'm going 23-26
[1:19:23] luke 9.
[1:19:26] so it says
[1:19:27] and he said to them all if any man will
[1:19:29] come after me let him deny himself
[1:19:31] that's the first thing you got to do
[1:19:33] and take up his cross daily so in order
[1:19:36] for you to take up your cross daily you
[1:19:38] have to deny yourself first before you
[1:19:39] even come to jesus christ
[1:19:41] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:19:43] lose it
[1:19:44] but whosoever will lose his life for my
[1:19:46] sake the same shall save it for what is
[1:19:49] a man advantage if he gain the whole
[1:19:51] world and lose himself or be a castaway
[1:19:54] for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and
[1:19:56] of my words of him shall a son of man be
[1:19:58] ashamed don't ever
[1:20:00] be ashamed for standing up for your
[1:20:02] convictions i don't care don't let any
[1:20:04] of your friends at work
[1:20:06] ever get you to let down your
[1:20:07] convictions you stand up for jesus and
[1:20:10] he'll stand up for you
[1:20:12] because people think is god isn't
[1:20:13] looking for mixers
[1:20:15] god's looking for separators from this
[1:20:16] world don't be like of the world because
[1:20:19] he said we're not of the world we're
[1:20:21] from a heavenly kingdom
[1:20:23] act like that live like that dress like
[1:20:25] a saint talk like a saint
[1:20:27] think like a saint walk like a saint
[1:20:30] amen for whosoever shall be ashamed of
[1:20:33] me and my words of him shall son of man
[1:20:35] be ashamed we shall come in his own
[1:20:37] glory and in his fathers and of the holy
[1:20:39] angels and go to mark i think mark 8
[1:20:41] actually i believe
[1:20:44] mark 8.
[1:20:47] i think it's 34-38
[1:20:50] so it's a similar so similar what jesus
[1:20:53] is saying it once again and when he
[1:20:54] called the people unto him with his
[1:20:56] disciples and he said unto them
[1:20:58] whosoever will come after me let him
[1:21:00] deny himself and take up his cross and
[1:21:02] follow me
[1:21:03] for whosoever will save his life shall
[1:21:06] lose it but whosoever will lose his life
[1:21:08] for my sake in the gospels the same
[1:21:11] shall be saved
[1:21:12] for sure the profit of man if he gained
[1:21:14] the whole world and lose his own soul
[1:21:17] so you can have every nice car you want
[1:21:19] you can have a a 10 bedroom house
[1:21:22] you can even have we'll cut that out you
[1:21:24] can even have be popular amongst your
[1:21:26] co-workers and your people because that
[1:21:28] could be exchanging your soul
[1:21:30] this prosperity alone doesn't have to be
[1:21:33] this in financial it could be in friends
[1:21:36] it could be in trying to keep up with
[1:21:38] the joneses
[1:21:39] get that
[1:21:40] charging on the credit card even though
[1:21:42] you don't have the money to get that
[1:21:43] nice fancy car
[1:21:45] it could be anything
[1:21:46] what shall a man give you in exchange
[1:21:47] for his soul whosoever therefore shall
[1:21:49] be ashamed of me and my words in this
[1:21:51] adulterous and sinful generation of him
[1:21:54] shall the son of man be ashamed when he
[1:21:56] cometh in the glory of the father with
[1:21:58] his holy angels
[1:22:00] amen
[1:22:01] let's keep now we see why brother
[1:22:02] branham said the greatest battle ever
[1:22:04] fought
[1:22:05] is in the mind
[1:22:06] satan is constantly trying to sell you
[1:22:08] his program in your mind trying to
[1:22:10] sugarcoat it to make it look appealing
[1:22:12] you have probably heard this quote
[1:22:13] before that mind is a terrible thing to
[1:22:16] waste
[1:22:18] what are you a question i'm gonna ask
[1:22:19] you don't answer it out loud please what
[1:22:21] are you wasting your mind on what kind
[1:22:23] of things are you thinking on that are
[1:22:25] harming your growth with the lord as a
[1:22:28] man think of so easy
[1:22:31] so when this when is this great battle
[1:22:33] started on earth there had to be mutual
[1:22:35] meeting place there had to be a place
[1:22:37] selected for the battle to begin and for
[1:22:40] the battle to rage and the battlegrounds
[1:22:42] begin in the human mind
[1:22:44] there is where the battle starts the
[1:22:46] human mind was chosen for this the place
[1:22:48] of the battle where it was begin
[1:22:50] and this is because the decisions are
[1:22:52] made from the mind the head
[1:22:55] now they never started from some
[1:22:57] organization they never started from
[1:22:59] some mechanical affair the grounds never
[1:23:01] started there therefore the organization
[1:23:04] can never do the work of god because the
[1:23:07] battlegrounds or if you got to meet your
[1:23:09] enemy is in the mind
[1:23:11] you got to make your choice it meets you
[1:23:14] so decisions are made in the head
[1:23:16] that's where satan meets you
[1:23:18] he's constantly trying to get you to
[1:23:20] look away from jesus christ he's
[1:23:22] constantly trying to get you to
[1:23:24] to still follow some of the word but not
[1:23:26] all of it
[1:23:27] and that's his program and what whose
[1:23:29] program are you working towards today
[1:23:32] the enemy wants you to to make you think
[1:23:35] you're always working towards god's
[1:23:36] program the enemy will get you so busy
[1:23:38] in this life that god's programs begin
[1:23:40] to slip from your mind that's his job is
[1:23:43] getting so busy and so distracted that
[1:23:46] god's put on the back burner but
[1:23:48] anything put before god is an idol
[1:23:50] i don't care what it is it could be your
[1:23:52] wife your husband a chair a car anything
[1:23:54] you put before god as an idol
[1:23:57] don't get distracted in this life
[1:23:59] by the pleasures of this life by your
[1:24:02] work by your job
[1:24:03] because at the end of the day it's all
[1:24:05] going to pass away what's done for jesus
[1:24:07] christ is the only thing that's going to
[1:24:09] last
[1:24:10] spend some extra time spend 20 minutes
[1:24:12] extra time in prayer
[1:24:13] spend 20 minutes studying the word of
[1:24:15] god spend 20 extra minutes listen to the
[1:24:16] message of the hour it's going to only
[1:24:18] benefit you it's going to grow that
[1:24:19] spiritual man inside of you
[1:24:22] just because you're busy does not always
[1:24:24] mean you're busy on the right things
[1:24:27] i've been there recently
[1:24:29] who must constantly check our motors on
[1:24:31] a daily basis why am i making myself so
[1:24:34] busy
[1:24:35] and find out is it just to get a
[1:24:36] financial freedom in this world i'm not
[1:24:38] saying it's not bad to have a little
[1:24:39] financial freedom but that's the only
[1:24:41] thing you're thinking about
[1:24:43] then you're as an idol
[1:24:46] see it's your mind that opens the door
[1:24:48] or closes the door
[1:24:49] and listens to your conscience listens
[1:24:52] to your memory listens to your
[1:24:53] affections but when your mind hallelujah
[1:24:56] closes itself to these things and let
[1:24:58] god the spirit of his word come in it
[1:25:01] blows the rest of that stuff out praise
[1:25:03] god
[1:25:04] every feeling is gone there's nothing
[1:25:06] standing there but the word of god
[1:25:09] check this out and satan cannot battle
[1:25:11] against that i'm read that one more time
[1:25:12] one more time there is nothing there but
[1:25:14] the word of god and satan cannot battle
[1:25:17] against that no sir he can't battle
[1:25:19] against it now we know that's true
[1:25:23] my grandfather
[1:25:25] wrote an ox card just a quote
[1:25:26] my grandfather wrote an ox crap that i
[1:25:28] know of i'm driving a ford v8 my son
[1:25:30] will fly a jet plane
[1:25:33] that's they're moving on that's what
[1:25:34] religion ought to be the coming of the
[1:25:36] lord is at hand amen can i get amen
[1:25:39] the church ought to be moving on to
[1:25:41] their power uh onto in their powers
[1:25:43] science can only climb so far and then
[1:25:46] it has to drop off but we we got
[1:25:48] untapped sources that's never been
[1:25:52] touched of the power unlimited of god
[1:25:56] that we ought to be moving into we're
[1:25:58] living a million miles under our
[1:26:01] privilege tonight
[1:26:02] of privileges of christians to be
[1:26:04] enjoying i feel ashamed of myself when i
[1:26:06] look out here and see the institutions
[1:26:08] and the sicknesses and the trouble
[1:26:10] that's going on right now
[1:26:12] our church ought to be walking the
[1:26:13] street healing the sick raising the dead
[1:26:16] casting out devils doing signs and
[1:26:18] wonders making the whole world realize
[1:26:21] that jesus christ lives praise god
[1:26:25] that's what we need to be doing
[1:26:28] it all comes down to our attitude what
[1:26:30] kind of attitude do we have towards
[1:26:31] christ you're at the way you're living
[1:26:34] the conversations you're having at work
[1:26:35] is going to prove to me what your
[1:26:37] attitude is of jesus christ is he just
[1:26:40] your savior or is he your lord
[1:26:42] he wants to be both
[1:26:44] attitude is everything a bad attitude
[1:26:47] will get you deceived by the enemy the
[1:26:51] enemy's goal is to take away your
[1:26:53] strength and the only way he can do that
[1:26:55] is get you to disbelieve one percent of
[1:26:58] the word that's your strength and power
[1:27:00] right there
[1:27:01] and if he gets you to take that word
[1:27:02] from you then you are helpless and weak
[1:27:06] see the thing is to combat the enemy's
[1:27:08] program we must have the mind of christ
[1:27:10] every day
[1:27:12] let's go to philippians 2.
[1:27:15] and the mind of christ isn't something
[1:27:18] you just take out your closet and put on
[1:27:20] it's something that you have to strive
[1:27:21] for on a daily basis something you have
[1:27:23] to press into in prayer
[1:27:28] i'm gonna close here in a couple minutes
[1:27:30] philippians 2
[1:27:33] verse 1
[1:27:35] there be
[1:27:36] therefore any consolation in christ if
[1:27:38] any co any comfort of love
[1:27:40] any fellowship of the spirit of any
[1:27:42] bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy
[1:27:45] they be like-minded having the same love
[1:27:48] being a one accord of one mind let
[1:27:50] nothing be done through strife or
[1:27:51] vainglory but in lowliness of mind
[1:27:54] let each other esteem better than
[1:27:56] themselves lifting once again up looking
[1:27:58] at every man of his own things but every
[1:28:00] man also in the things of others let
[1:28:02] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:28:05] christ jesus amen
[1:28:07] who being in the form of god thought it
[1:28:09] not robbery to be equal with god but
[1:28:11] check this out but made himself of no
[1:28:13] reputation
[1:28:15] no reputation he wasn't trying to vaunt
[1:28:16] that he was i'm the son of god i'm jesus
[1:28:19] christ no but he came in the form as a
[1:28:21] servant and we have to serve one another
[1:28:23] we have to build one another go out and
[1:28:25] serve somebody in the world lift them up
[1:28:27] become all things to them that you might
[1:28:29] win them
[1:28:32] no reputation took the form of a servant
[1:28:34] was made in the likeness of men and
[1:28:35] being found in the fascism of a man he
[1:28:38] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:28:40] the even the death of the cross
[1:28:42] let us stand
[1:28:43] and read this last quote
[1:28:47] musicians can come up
[1:28:49] jesus gave us an example how to do it
[1:28:52] now we want to know how to overcome
[1:28:54] check this out
[1:28:55] amen
[1:28:56] jesus told us how to do it see check
[1:28:58] this out humility one more time
[1:29:01] jesus gave us an example how to do it
[1:29:03] now we want to know how to overcome
[1:29:05] jesus told us how to do it see humility
[1:29:08] gird himself took a towel and washed the
[1:29:11] disciples feet
[1:29:14] the very god of heaven humiliated
[1:29:16] himself
[1:29:17] we don't want to be humiliated that's
[1:29:19] the reason women don't want their hair
[1:29:20] to grow i'll see the reason they don't
[1:29:22] want to dress like ladies should you got
[1:29:24] men wearing tight clothes looking like a
[1:29:26] hot dog it's just it's so it's so
[1:29:28] perverted
[1:29:31] they want to dress like ladies should
[1:29:32] they don't want men to see the same
[1:29:33] thing they don't want to get humiliated
[1:29:35] but jesus constantly look who he was
[1:29:38] greatness i'm going to say something
[1:29:40] greatness humiliates itself
[1:29:43] great great humbles itself greatness
[1:29:46] i've had the privilege of getting
[1:29:47] meeting some great men and it's the guys
[1:29:49] that got a change of clothes and 50
[1:29:50] cents in their pocket in toronto that's
[1:29:52] the guy who thinks he's something when
[1:29:54] he's nothing but i stood by great men i
[1:29:56] mean great men with ragged cuff sleeves
[1:29:58] they don't think you're the great person
[1:30:00] greatness is humility don't forget that
[1:30:02] church he's speaking to us right now
[1:30:04] greatness is expressed in humility not
[1:30:07] how fine you can be

[1:30:31] from your program
[1:30:32] lord may we never
[1:30:34] look away from you lord i remember peter
[1:30:37] he was walking on the water
[1:30:39] and soon as he took his eyes off you he
