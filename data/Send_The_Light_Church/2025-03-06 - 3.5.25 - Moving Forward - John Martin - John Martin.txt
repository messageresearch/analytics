TRANSCRIPT
========================================
check out a church amen because it does take courage to come and I always I always honor that amen how many's glad to be in the house of the Lord today certainly appreciate Brother Bruce and being able just to Worship the Lord and we certainly appreciate our sister Trisha we miss Cheryl today and uh we just continue to to pray for her hold her up that God would give her healing in her lungs amen amen amen well if you turn with me in your Bibles to two scripture readings today the first is going to be in 2 Timothy chapter 1 2 Timothy chapter 1 and then the second is going to be in Exodus chapter 14 which we'll be spending uh the majority of our time there amen amen we're just gonna just ask the Lord to bless the reading of his word before we before we before we read it now Heavenly Father we come to you with the need Lord that you would come and make the word real to us today amen Lord we don't want to just read it and put our own thoughts to it and try to uh surmise what we think this is meaning but we're asking that you take away our thoughts take away our understanding Lord as we don't lean to that but Lord we're leaning to you today may you Quicken this word to us may you make it alive to us may you give us the true meaning for our personal lives Lord we commit the service to you we trust you you bring Revelation to us in this service where we humbly pray in your precious name name amen amen amen second Timothy chapter 1 verse number s very familiar for God have not given us the spirit of fear but of power and of love and of a sound mind isn't that a beautiful scripture let's just read the next verse as well uh be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of the Lord nor of me his prisoner but be thou partaker of the afflictions of The Gospel According to the power of God Amen and then in Exodus chapter 14 Exodus chapter 14 and we're going to read verses 13- 15 this is where uh the children of Israel are standing at the Red Sea kind of in a in a place of great suffering because it didn't look like any way of that they could see that that it could be an escape and Moses said unto the people fear ye not stand still and see the salvation of the Lord which he will show to you today for the Egyptians who you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever the Lord shall fight for you and ye shall hold your peace and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak unto the children of Israel that they go forward amen God bless you you may be seated we want in t of this message moving forward but with a subject with the right mental attitude with Clarity with a sound mind with confidence and a lot of times when we're facing our afflictions our trials and our test there's a very big hesitancy to moving forward in fact usually when we're facing trials we're facing what we would call A A Time of suffering a time of suffering um we don't want to go through it we don't want to face it we don't want to talk to the person we don't want to uh come to grips with the reality that we're going to face some hardship so we want we have that tendency of not moving forward we're kind of like sit back and we don't want to place ourselves in that position but if we could I just want to start back in Chapter 13 and just try to spend some time reading here as we enter into this uh situation starting with chapter 13 and and verse number 17 and it came to pass when Pharaoh had let the people go that God LED them not through the way the land of the Philistines although that was was near for God said lest preventure the people repent when they see war and they return to Egypt so God knows what he's doing God knows that our weaknesses and that we could have a tendency of not being going all the way with God but God led the people about through the way of the Wilderness of the Red Sea and the children of Israel went up harnessed out of the land of Egypt and this word is like so powerful to me you know when you got a dog that just kind of going all over you you put a harness on them and and sometimes you you need to put a choke chain on him sometimes you got to put this whole thing on him so you can grab them better and when I think of the word harness I'm thinking that they're not allowed to just kind of do what they want to do that's right and so God leted him out of Egypt with a mighty Deliverance right killed basically the 10 plages all that they went through they saw the hand of God in a mighty way and the basically Pharaoh kicked him out of Egypt go and so it was almost like God was in control so he it they were under his harness are you with me so far that's right okay and Moses uh took the bones of Joseph with him for he straightly sworn the children of Israel saying God will surely visit you and you shall carry my bones away from hence with you and they took their Journey from sucko and encamped to e them into the edge of the Wilderness and the Lord went before them by a pillar of cloud uh to lead them the way and by Night a pillar fire to give them light to go by day and night so here the statement is made in verse 21 that God was with them day or night God was doing the leading and he took not away the pillar of the cloud by day nor the pillar of Fire by night from before the people in verse Chapter 14 verse one and the Lord spake unto Moses saying Speak unto the children of Israel that they turn and encamp from fil that word between migdal and the Sea and against peris ofum before it shall ye shall encamp by the Sea so let me just say it like this the children of Israel looked like they were going in a a much easier way and God said turn the pillar of fire says no we're going to turn now where God was leading them and this is like the crutch of the whole service today is we must understand that God was pointing them to the middle of their trial amen he was pointing them into an an insal situation that they would never choose to be in and you will see this because they begin to murmur they want to go back to the Egypt and they were you know started this complaining because the trial was so great but yet the Holy Spirit was leading them right to here and we not we need to remember this in our lives when we're going through our trials God has pointing us to go there we're the ones that saying no I don't want to go there but there's a reason for it oh there a reason for it for Pharaoh will say of the children of Israel they are entangled in the land the Wilderness has shut them in and I will harden Pharaoh's heart and he shall follow after them and I will be honored upon pharaoh and upon all his host that the Egyptians may know that I am the Lord and they did so and it was told that the king of Egypt and it was told that the king of Egypt that the people fled in the heart of pharaoh and of his servants was turned against the people and they said why have we done this why we let Israel go from serving us and he and he he made ready his chariots and he took his people with him and he took 600 chosen chariots and all the Chariots of Egypt and the captains over every one of them and the Lord hardened the heart of pharaoh king of Egypt and he pursued after the children of Israel and the children of Israel went out with a high hand and the Egyptians pursued after them and all the horses and the Chariots of pharaoh and his Horsemen and his armies overtook them en camping them by the Sea beside pill hyra before be zifon and when Pharaoh Drew nigh the children of Israel lifted up their eyes and behold the Egyptians marched after them and they were sore afraid and the children of Israel Cried Out unto the Lord what we do when we are in a trial um now um the fear makes us us um not have confidence in what we're doing fear is there because Satan is wanting to put us in a box he's wanting to make us feel like there's it's a hopeless situation and God wanted them to be there this is what's important God LED them to the situation he knows the end from the beginning he knows how we're going to react to certain situations but what what God is really wanting he's in the people to know that God is with them and we we can't face situations and think God's not there God wants us to know he's here and this this is something that's happened in the natural but we'd like to try to show it in the type in the reason for it there's a purpose in it as well and they said unto Moses because there was no graves in Egypt thou has taken us away to die in the wilderness what a cutdown what an absolute slapping of Fate To The General Moses to the prophet of God yes sir mocking him was there not enough graves in Egypt you had to bring us out here to die isn't that terrible they did not have a sound mind they were so moved by fear in other words the all the deliverances that just happened in Egypt did not build their faith didn't build their faith like it should have he says wherefore has thou doubt with us to carry us forth out of Egypt is not this the word we did tell thee in Egypt saying let us alone that we may serve the Egyptians but it had been better for us to to serve the Egyptians than that we should die in the wilderness now that is really a true statement but they just did not have faith that God was was going to deliver them and a lot of times when we we're in our trial we cannot see God delivering us of this because we're staring at human beings who standing in the way of getting the victory amen and because they're doing this because they said that because they're acting like this all they see is you know I would rather be over here than in that situation why not be right exactly where God wants you to be and face the situation because God wants us to overcome that God knew what he was doing by Leading them there and Moses said to the people fear not stand still and see yeah the salvation of the Lord that's the that's the biggest thing that we can do is when we're facing a problem don't be scared of it don't back up don't run don't say I don't want to deal with this don't say I can't handle this I can't take it no more I've done I didn't sign up for this you know all the things that are spoken all the things that come to our head stand still and and and see the salvation of the Lord and we need to see with our hearts because obviously these children of Israel they saw all these Miracles that they've never seen before in their life the the frogs the Flies everything that transpired the firstborn dying the light in in uh uh uh their Camp while in the enemy's Camp there was Darkness they seen all this but they seen it with these eyes and not eyes of faith and if we do not see God in the spirit realm then we don't see God at all then it's like well I'm not going to believe until I see the put my finger in his hand that's why we need to see God in the word that's right that's a it's an invisible word it the holy spirit is a is a Living Word and we need to see God in it fear not stand still and see the salvation the Lord which he will show you today for the Egyptians who you have seen today you shall see them again no more forever and this is what I love about about the victory that we have when we Face our trials I don't care if we need Deliverance over something we need a we need Victory we need joy we need peace we need direction in our life we need something when we can have the confidence that there is going to be an end to the enemy's torment that that I'm going to trust God that's what it means to stand still trust God Amen today he's going to take care of this amen the Lord shall fight for you and you shall hold your peace you don't have to get there and try to straighten the thing out what you need to do is learn to trust God that's the greatest thing is to trust God in your situation we don't need to figure it out we need know God's got it handled amen and the Lord said unto Moses wherefore criest thou unto me speak to the children of Israel that they go forward that they go forward so here they are in the middle of their trial the enemies coming after the Holy Spirit Led them to kind of a a place where they couldn't get out and their whole being is like I'm a they're they're crying against the the leadership right the the the the the Holy Ghost leadership they're they're whining against it they're murmuring against it they're here in this corner they know uh Pharaoh's coming after them they're going to kill them and God's saying go forward go forward in the middle of your trial well what does that mean how do I go forward this is it we got to get out of our understand standing get out of our reasoning get out of our imagination get out of how we're looking at things and so and see that God is right there and he's wanting to do something in your life amen what is he wanting to do I'm just going to make it real clear he wants to build character and he can't do it outside of a trial God is not going to build character outside of a trial because then it would be gifted we could sit there in a seminary and learn about God and have character that don't exist knowledge Puffs you up I don't want to get ahead of myself verse 16 and he says but lift thou up thy rod and stretch out thine hand over the sea and divide it and the children of Israel shall go on dry land through the midst of the sea and I behold I will harden the hearts of the egyp ipans and they shall follow after them and I will get honor upon pharaoh and upon his host and his chariots and upon his Horsemen and the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord and I have gotten my honor upon pharaoh and and his chariots and upon his Horsemen and the angel of God which went before the camp of Israel to lead them now went behind them in the pillar of cloud went behind their faces and stood behind them so what was God doing he was being a protector from the enemy so when we go in the middle of a trial and we're like really dealing with a spirit that's like real evil you got to know that God is wanting you to move forward in his will knowing that you are protected by the Holy Spirit you don't have to be afraid God is there to do exceedingly to fight the battle but you've got to have faith in God that he's there right amen this is not a story this is a reality for us church thank you Jesus a reality that we can start looking at the problems in our life with faith in God that's what this is here for it's for our ammunition and it came between the camp and the Egyptians and the camp of Israel and it was a cloud of Darkness to them but it gave light by night to these so that one came near the other all that one came not near the other all night isn't that something you're in a situation you can see spiritually what's happening yes sir you can see spiritually what's happening but the other person is they're looking through eyes of carnality they really can't see what's going on it's like a Darkness to them but you see clearly spiritually and that's what the Holy Spirit does and Moses stretched out his hand over the sea and the Lord caused the sea to go back by a strong wind and all that night and made the sea dry and uh the sea the the sea dry land and the waters were divided we know the story that the children of Israel walked across on dry land and they got through with no problem and God took those same Waters after they the enemy was pursuing them and then destroyed them but we us human beings we got well I got to see this up here I I want to make sure that you know the enemy is is corrected they shouldn't have follow this they shouldn't be doing that I shouldn't be a slave to them that shouldn't be happening that needs to be corrected that's how we think but God don't want us to think like that he don't want us to lean to our own understanding in all their ways acknowledge the Lord he shall direct thy paths there has to be this faith and confidence that God is with me in the middle of my trial else is if you can see God in the middle of your trial you have a chance of building character but if you can't see God you'll never make the right decisions and character is not wrought without suffering that's right there's a reason God brought you to the trial there's a reason God allowed this in your life because God is wanting to build character in you amen it's the only reason it doesn't take joy in seeing people suffer ER but he does take joy in seeing his character inside of us right A lot of times we try to escape our situations when really God is leading us to go to the situation to go into the situation but we get scared though they talked to me that way they shouldn't have done that and then we have a a a self-embedded resistance to just I don't want to deal with that I don't want to deal with that can you imagine the Lord Jesus saying I don't want to deal with your problem I don't want to deal with that demon I don't want to deal with that sickness no no I'm not my God he's Mighty in battle he's not afraid of any demon and the Holy Spirit lives we're not going to be afraid of dealing with problems in our home problems in our marriage problems at our work problems in our church he God is Not Afraid we should not be afraid God has not given us the spirit of fear but power and love and of a sound mind amen and who I tell you if you can't use it in the middle of a trial what good is it I don't want some plaque on the wall that says I'm a Believer in Christ I want it living inside of me on demonstration can't be on demonstration till I get in hot water right I could line this whole thing up with all the cups in our house you know we had a lot of cups in our house that we had so many we brought them here and they're in the kitchen I can put hot water in every one of them and put tea bags in every one of them and you would not know what is what until you tasted it that's good it could be laying there without being in hot water you'd be guessing yes sir but it isn't until you put it in hot water and then you taste it and you see if it's what it is and we should not be afraid of problems be afraid of not having God on the inside to take care of that problem everybody wants to say I got God but they don't want to face the problem what is that it's not real it's not real look what I'm trying to say is I'm not saying go out there and cause problems what I am saying is that when there is a problem don't be afraid because that is exactly what God told Moses to tell the children of Israel don't be afraid of this Army coming after you I have a purpose in all this and you need to face this situation without fear in fact you need to face it with this right mental attitude and that is is I'm moving forward I'm moving forward I don't know where to go I've never been this I've never had this happen I haven't I nobody's ever taught me before what to do in this situation I don't know that's okay but you have the Holy Ghost and if he says move forward that's all you do you move forward so you move forward in the middle of your trial with faith that God is with you God never said tell the children of Israel look I got a great plan I'm gonna open up this water you're going to go through on dry R in fact I'm going to give you like a little video what's going to happen he didn't do that he didn't even do that to Moses when he threw down the snake threw down the rod and it came a snake he didn't have any idea that's what The Magicians were going to do so he had to step out there by faith and I'm telling you the biggest thing is we get in our trials and We complain and we murmur about them it just comes automatically like the children of Israel but God's spirit is don't do that right walk forward trust me I will meet you there walk forward and I'll take care of it trust me hardest thing to do but character can't be built unless we're trusting God because you're going to be in the middle of a trial middle of a test and you know your character don't come by just going through trials you know many people are going through trials and suffering in the world they ain't got no character right say not going through trials that give you character it's it's making the right decision in the trial to either trust God or to run away to murmur or go forward I love that God leads us into trials I do he's got confidence like if you're trying to teach your child to um ride a tricycle you you you you got confidence even though they've never done it before that they will eventually about to do it because you you you got that I mean every one of children that learn to drive a vehicle as much as you didn't want to be in the car with them at that time you you knew that this two would pass and they would be driving yes sir God is not going to put us in a trial without confidence in us we're the one that need confidence in him God wanted to show forth his glory that's true the Bible tells us I will will get Glory out of pH I'll get Glory out of his Horsemen and his chariots I will get Glory but you know what also he was wanting he was wanting his own people to see that they could trust in him and they didn't get this because they didn't make it into the promised land there the the trial that you're going through is an opportunity to build faith in God for something greater but if we can't handle this the Bible says if you can't keep up with the footmen how are you going to keep up with the horses you've got to be able to handle the trial that's in front of you with this confidence God would not put anything on you that you couldn't handle right God is faithful that he would not put anything on you you can't bear but he will make a way of Escape now this is it here are these people they're all how what's going to happen what's how I I've never seen the water part and I've never seen so what's going to happen God puts us all in these situations every one of us could stand and testify about some trial in their life that nobody else has gone through except them but the an is the same for every trial and that is trust God in that trial amen and he'll make a way God brought the children of Israel into an impossible situation but he made a way of escape and it's really no different than the believer today A lot of times we're trying to avoid dealing with certain things situations and we're wanting God to handle the situation without them catch what I'm saying we're wanting God to handle the situation without using Us in the situation yeah and the thing is how am I going to get character if I'm going to sit here and wait for God to do it God wants to use my mouth God wants to use my prayers God wants to use my faith my confidence in him God is moved right if God is touched by the feelings of our infirmities he's certainly moved by our prayers Hallelujah so I we all play a part in getting our character and I'm telling you we're not born with the character of Christ amen in fact our flesh hates doing what we need to do to get character we need to just trust God that God will always meet us in the middle of the trial but but brother John you don't understand they're just they're yelling at me they're screaming at they they're they're they're they're they're hitting me they they said they won't talk to me no more they they they said that that if I don't pay my rent that that I'm I'm going to lose everything what reason do we have not to trust God see God is proving us just like he proved the children of Israel after they went through the Red Sea and went through the Wilderness many times God proved them to see if they would trust him and instead of instead of saying God help me to make it through this trial help me to trust you right here help me to hold your unchanging hand right here help me to just just stay here because I know that you're real in my life God you didn't you didn't bring me in this truth to just had me be some sit person on a chair but you brought me here to become a manifested Son of God that's what you got to say with every trial you know a lot of times we go through trials and we spend more time talking about how bad the trial is and how bad the person is and this shouldn't have happened they shouldn't have done that and it's not fair and it's not right and we don't even think about God being with us right there amen we give the devil more Glory about our trials than we do God it's like what are we looking at God ain't going to get any Glory out of out of it if you can't trust him in the middle of a trial God said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you amen amen if you can see God in your trials as you're going through them you've got spiritual eyes give me the cold on that I I am quing I am you quot me you know we it's easy to look back brother Ram says that you know people so have a tendency to look back and say I see God over over here what he did over here I can see it now or or look into what God's going to do in a Rapture but they failed to see God where he's at presently and we've got to see God in our trials that's the only way will we'll get the character we need we're so focused that I wish I would have to deal with I wish this wasn't here I wish I these Spirits weren't around me we we think like that we need to be thinking God is here and if God is here I don't have to be afraid because there's a spirit the Holy Spirit the same God that's not afraid outside of me is the same God that's not afraid inside of me amen for God has not given us the spirit of fear I don't know about anybody else but brother John don't you think they got here's here's the thing Saints if you fear I am not saying that you don't have the Holy Ghost at all I would never even think that thought for a second what I am telling you is if there is a spirit of fear on of you what you need to do is yield to the holy ghost that lives inside you because Spirits can get on us and and most of the time when we're going through a trial what moves us to complain and to murmur it's fear it's fear that is happening whereas if we looked at like if we all knew the end result when we went through the trial we would never fear it's a big deal big deal because we knew the end but because we're not having faith that God is with us now we you know we don't live by sight amen we don't live by sight of of of seeing the end we live by faith that God is with us as we move forward we're trusting him that takes character it takes character to trust God in our trial it takes no character at all to sit there and say that's wrong this is that shouldn't be happening this is so bad it don't take any character the devil's an ace at it he's the accuser of the brother he can pull out our faults he pulls out enough faults in every one of our lives that we should we would just be totally depressed 1 Corinthians 10:13 there have no temptation taken you but such as common to man just to think about your your trials are just common that's true the devil wants to make you think that it's not but it's common but God who is faithful in other words he's in control of everything right who will not suffer you to be tempted above that you're able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that you may be able to Bear let me just say this in a natural realm when you've T tried to teach your children something like you would never put a four-year-old in in in the car seat of your car and say okay I want you to drive it to the store go ahead you have given them something that you know they can't handle God do not want to give us a trial that's higher than what we're able to handle amen he knows that we we're we're a little bit older we can handle a little bit more we've been serving him a little bit he G so he gives us a trial no higher than what we can handle and that that just gives me so much confidence right that gives me confidence that I don't have to be afraid amen and I'll tell you what if you don't learn to trust God you know what's going to happen don't you you're going to keep going through the trial you're going to keep going through the same thing or something very similar let me just say it like that until you learn to handle the situation the right way because I'm telling you what God is after he's after his own character inside of you he is not interested in just our well-being for our flesh I mean he's interested in our spiritual wellbeing I would that you would prosper in all things even as they soul prospers he's wanting to see his image inside of us amen so what's going to bring that it only comes to a trial so we have to come to face with you know I just can't wait till this service is over and we get to more of an encouraging service you know because really this is not really helping me I am telling you if you don't get the revelation of the importance of facing your trials with faith God is not given us the spirit of fear but Faith Power Sound Mind face it Paul said to Timothy be up thou a partaker of the afflictions of Christ just come and be a partaker don't say I don't want to do that no I I shouldn't have to do that all we need to say is Lord help me Lord help me help me not to help me to have the right mental attitude in other words come into the trial knowing it's not comfortable it's not enjoyable don't want to be here but I do know God is here because the pillar of fire led me here he allowed this person to get bothered allow this person to get upset allow this thing L allow me to lose my job allow me to to to run out of finances allow me to get sick allow all this to happen to me but you know what I know God wouldn't leave me alone so I can I can I can have faith that God will help me through the situation see as soon as the devil can get us scared he's we're defeated because fear is the opposite of faith and without faith we can't please Goden so we need faith in the middle of our trial amen God did not lead the children of Israel to a place of Temptation that was greater than they could handle and God will not lead us to that place either he understands we're four years old and we can't drive the car yet that's right amen and I'm so thankful he knows my age he knows what I can handle and what I can't handle and you know you may be to handle a lot more than I can handle yes so God's going to give you a lot more that's right and when I grow up then I'll be able to handle what you can handle because eventually I need to handle it because I got to make a Rapture and I can't I I I can't stay being a baby I can't stay a weakling I got I got to grow up into the statue of a perfect man because God God is marrying a mature woman H A lot of times people give into the temptation of not paying their tithes and their offerings because they don't got money give into the temptation of uh needing to work on the Lord's Day or skipping out on going to church or listening to tapes or reading the Bible or praying or or just reaching out to somebody because you care about them yes getting on your on your knees to to pray for somebody instead of getting on your knees because you need help and so there's there's so many Temptations right so many Temptations and people a lot of times give into the temptation but I'll say it like this God will never put anything on you that you can't bear so if you don't got money to pay your tie then you know something is wrong because God doesn't lie God never is not there will there will never be on the day of judgment one person that will stand before God and say God I could not pay my ties because I did not have enough money not a one not a one I couldn't go to church and be faithful be there won't be a one not a one but what we want to do in a caral state is make our own religion our own view of what we think the message is and instead of meeting God in the trial with faith we're meeting God in the in the middle of the trial with reasoning yes sir with excuses with you don't understand God understands God knows look if we can't be honest with ourselves how are we going to be honest with God are you with me if we're not faithful with the things that we can do how are we going to become faithful with greater things Jude chapter 1 verse 20 Jude chapter 1 verse2 I'm allowed to say chapter 1 even though there's only one chapter I'm not saying it because I'm afraid you go to chapter two I'm saying it because it is chapter one all right but beloved building up yourself on your Most Holy Faith praying in the the Holy Ghost so you can't just allow Faith to stay stagnant in your life you've actually got to build up yourself yes sir you've got to do the things that build Faith yeah I wish just coming to church hearing the word would just automatically give Faith but it don't work like that you've actually got to say that what you just said I know is for my life I will believe this I will hold to it I will start doing it now that is building faith verse 21 keeping yourselves in the love of God that's right keeping yourself in the love of God try try to build character without being in love with Jesus you'll run away from your trials you got to keep yourself in love because God did not want the children of Israel to go no please I don't want this I I'm going back to Egypt I'm leaving this trial I don't want to stay here it's too hot the word it hurts too much keep yourself in love with God love the word of God love the word of God love it because that is what delivers us it's the word looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ on etal that when we're in a trial what are we looking for when you're honestly going through a trial and it's it's hurting it's suffering what are you looking for we we're looking for help we're looking for mercy God help me it doesn't even matter if it's not your fault you're still looking for Mercy to have this thing lifted from you yes that's true and of some have compassion making a difference so take it take it to the next to the next you know the difference between love and compassion you know the difference between being loved and loving everybody loves being loved by God but loving God is different he says if you love me keep my commandments so when you being loved by people is the it's very enjoyable when they really love you but now when you have to love them that's harder but it makes a difference some having compassion making a difference that's what makes the difference brother BR says it like this it takes a bigger man to get underneath a little man because you know uh a a guy that's all puffed up or a girl that's all puffed up you know isn't going to bow down and cater to them and um you know act like they they're needy in other words they're going to act like they're not part of the body right but but when you realize that your Fallen brother your Fallen sister is in in a place that they need help then compassion on them in their situation is what's going to make the difference look at and others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire hating in the garments spotted by flesh we've got to hate when we see the devil uh trying to make his imprint on on on other people and just we got to pull them out of the we got to hate what's what's going on Amen 1 John 4:18 1 John 4:18 there is no fear in love Z I like that brother zero I love that when you see yourself battl fear when you see fear attacking you when you say well there's just no hope in this situation what is needed is love inside your heart amen perfect love cast out fear now think about this this just let's go back to the situation the children of Israel come out of Egypt they're there at the uh Red Sea God directs them to a place to get as it were more CAU there's no way of Escape because he wanted them there imagine that they stood there and they just said I'm not afraid I trust God now that's what God wanted right I I love God so much I trust him there was so much love for God in their heart that fear could not penetrate them and you know we look at as is the love of God like like we can't put possess that kind of love and I'm here to tell you you can possess it amen you can possess the love of God not a love for God that we want we want to be part of his family we want him to bless us we want him to prosper us I'm talking about a love that says God you put me in this trial and I will not complain I'm talking about that kind of love I'm talking about a kind of love that though he slay me yet why trust him that kind of love there is no no fear in love but perfect love it cast out fear because fear has torment amen and he that feareth there's just something wrong he's not made perfect in love there's something missing when we're operating by fear we love him because he first love us there's our confidence right there he's right there he's the one that taught us to ride the tricycle he's the one that can teach us to drive the car he's there to help us make a way when our attitude is move forward right move forward in our trial God is Not Afraid with dealing with problems am why should we why should we be afraid I say we we need the right mental attitude as we move forward Ward we can't just say God you got to deal with it we can't say I'm just going to I'm just going to I'm just gonna do that's all I'm GNA do now God wants us to move forward okay for okay just I'm just really trying to bring this home right okay so uh somebody ask you to go a mile go to somebody slaps you in the face turn your other cheek help us Lord somebody does wrong to you go go to them and and and and help them that is right help them in other words move forward without fear do not wait for them to come back and say I'm sorry I hit your cheek be Christ to them and you know what it's hard to find that you know what we need to do we need to practice that in our homes because if we can do it in our homes we can do it with others amen but it's a real thing God is real this word is real and it it it's not that we want the word to conform to our life we need to conform to the word amen so God is Not Afraid of dealing with problems and he is literally this is the hardest pill to swallow I think God is literally leading us into the middle of problems and how many times you said do I ain't doing that ain't going there because remember it's through fre more agency that character is built it's not a gift you got to like Paul told Timothy be a partaker be a partaker come and be a partaker because it's something more than this Affliction right the Bible says our our light afflictions which are are for a moment are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us now what is that Glory that's the character of Jesus Christ and so we we can't be bothered by problems brother Bram said in the message the way of a true prophet he says as I said the other night it seems to be today that the whole church is built upon the main thing amongst the Brethren today of the churches as numbers numbers one's trying to outdo the other one numbers God don't count numbers he counts character amen character is what God is looking to find amen somebody he can get his hands on somebody that will stand still long enough in the infallible word of God brother BR says and a man's character is shown in his works his character is shown by his works we know that just like a a contractor a contractor shows what he is by his works for instance if he was going to have a great building built in the city of Chicago the first thing the officials of the City Board would do they would try to select a contractor not just anyone that could run it well I can do the job all right no they're going to get a contractor that's got a reputation some sort of history of faithfulness right yes and now because if they didn't maybe another contractor would underbid the contractor but he would put in the building bad material and perhaps he would build a $1,000 less build it for thousands of dollars less but then we we come to find out that the B building would collapse the first storm that hit it it went it would go down what do you think the city would think about that contractor it would ruin the reputation forever so this is what I'm trying to say God doesn't want you to just be able to stay in a church until the Rapture happens he is trying to build his character inside of us because our character will not make a Rapture even if we're faithful to sit in church every service the doors are open in the message the choosing of a bride brother man said he's looking for her he's looking for her character the character of Christ he's looking for her character the character of Christ now just a moment now that's it he chooses a bride to reflect his character to which the modern churches of today certainly miss his program here A Million Miles because they deny this to be the truth that's why they're okay with just having churches and parties and everything that goes on in a church entertainment because they're denying the truth that God wants to see character in his bride amen truth now he's looking for the day that the bride to be formed Hebrews 13 he's looking for his bride to manifest that God is the same yesterday today and forever amen just exactly as it was like he is he's got to be the same flesh same bone Same Spirit everything the same just built up and them two become one until the church becomes that they're not one think about that I'm in the message I could be in the message I could be at church and I'm not one with Christ not until I have the character of Christ amen the character of him the word for this age must be molded she must be molded like he is remember Jesus learned obedience by the things he suffered amen so we got two scriptures I just want to read them real quick for whom he did for know he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that we might be the firstborn among many Brethren so I'm glad I'm predestinated but I understand that my predestination is to come into His Image that's right and that doesn't happen on Rapture morning that happens through trials from here until the Rapture so if I'm not thinking about being in His image when I'm going into a trial I'm way off track I'm trying to bring this here how important it is to embrace trials to not be afraid amen 1 John 3:2 beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure so how do we do that how do we purify oursel we come into our trial we come into our trial we stand right there we trust God that he's with us I shall not be moved God is going to make a way amen where before it's like I don't want to deal with this you know that that's that's you know that's for that's for the pastor to deal deal with that's for the church I'm out of there I'm not dealing with that stuff okay so God wants you in the body but not to deal to help the body is that I understanding what you're saying because I I'm I'm still got to find that scripture but you see why it's important is our heart isn't really wanting to please God enough and we're wanting to use people in the church church and the word and God for what we can get out of it for our fleshly lives God is trying to build character in us and if we don't love him enough to say God not my will but thy will be done we're going to miss it yes sir brother Bram said character is never built outside of Trials it's just not it's the only way in the lean Church age brother B said the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fiery furnace of Affliction and Paul told Timothy be thou a partaker of the afflictions of Christ be a partaker don't run away from remember he was scared in the message that Paul was telling Timothy God has not given us the spirit of fear but of power and love and of a sound mind do not be afraid of Trials God directed the children of Israel to their trial God has orchestrated your life to be in the trials that you're in pass them meet meet God in your trial and say God is here God is here I've got faith I will not murmur I will not complain it is God that worketh in me to to both do of his good pleasure and his will that's right he'll he'll finish the work he started Amen Brother Band also said that character is the only thing that we're taking with us he said in the message and then Jesus came he says but man is not judged by how how many muscles he's got man is judged by his character he said I've seen man weigh 200 pounds and didn't have an ounce of man in them man is measured by character now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his whose character was molded by the suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction so are you going to get character that way or will it be the softness of the character list leoan people it's up to each one of us right for in that day every man shall bear his own burden so here's what's so beautiful about this you could be in a house house where you may be the only one that wants God's character so bad that you're willing to pay the price you might be the only one in the church that wants God's character so bad that you're willing to pay the price because it's every man's Choice what kind of character he wants to have amen unfortunately we're living in a world where every man's right in his own eyes right every man thinks they got the character of Christ but it takes a heart to to go in a trial and not murmur not complain not get upset not just want to beat your head against the wall and all this stuff go in your trial and say I know God is with me if we don't get anything out out of this message get that God is with you in your trials and the message seeking after Jesus brother says and the Holy Spirit molds that conduct when he comes into you when you're really born Bor again of the spirit of God so here you are in the in the trial and obviously we're dealing with people we're dealing with attitudes we're dealing with certain situations that have come upon us I understand that but where God is really at is right here he's just using this to deal with this he's wanting to see something changed now if you pass the test you don't even feel like it's a trial it's true if you already got that character when you go into that trial you are already not being bombarded with fear because you've already been there you've done that you know what's happening now you can stand there with boldness I know God's with me just like David David I look I I overcame this bear I overcame this lion this uncircumcised Philistine he's not going to stand before me that is right he had faith and confidence that God was with him in the trial the three Hebrew children where did God meet the three Hebrew children right in the fiery furnace amen same place God's going to meet you thing is the devil want to get you so bothered upset everything going on that you're not even thinking about God's with you stand still see the salvation of God and move forward with confidence that God is with you Ser time time is up time is up and this is I got half the notes I normally have and I only got through half the notes let's stand together if God meets Us in the middle of the trial let's meet God in the middle of the trial amen let's have confidence that God is with us am think about every time a murmur or complaint comes out I want you to be plagued with the thought of the children of Israel to remember them and what happened because you can only do that so long right God allowed that for a while God allowed it for a while in the wilderness but eventually he said no you're you're not bride material you're not going into the will you're not going into the promised land and what we are we are bride amen so we we have no option to complain and murmur we have no option to think that we're going to gain character by just reading the Bible or listening to tapes in fact the more we listen to that and the more we hear without applying it to our life the more ammunition the devil has against us we've got to have it the right mental attitude of I'm going to I'm going to trust God I'm going I got a sound mind I've got power i' I've I've got love God gave it to me it is mine it is mine peace is mine I I'm I'm I'm gonna trust God Amen imagine Saints for the next seven days just take seven days we can go through the next seven days and trust God with our trials for you know honestly forget about trying to do it the rest of our life and if a week's too long just do one day one day with every thought and every situation say I'm going to trust God in this amen how many times have we thought something was so bad this was bad we found out wasn't even true it's true so I I think God is wanting us to put into practice that he's with us amen and when we know he's with us it's so easy to make the right decision in the trial and when you make the right decision in the trial character is formed character is molded in your life for instance I get slapped on the face I'm in the middle of the trial why did you do that and I turn the cheek it is that decision right there that character is built in me that's how powerful that's how character is build it's when you make the right decision but it takes you your will out and you uning to God's will to turn the cheek to go the second mile to to stay there praying longer when you don't want to now it's a reality Saints let's bow our hearts in in a word of prayer our heavenly father thank you thank you for for always being with us we don't always recognize that you're with us but you would never leave us Lord you'd never forsake us you'd never leave us by ourselves but Lord I I pray that this message here would help us to trust you when we're in the trial not to succumb to fear not to not to succumb to murmuring or complaining to to worrying to being uh overtaken by the thoughts of the enemy but I pray that you would bring to all of our remembrance that you want to stand still and trust you that you'll give us wisdom to move forward and that we could see uh the Salvation that we need to see for that situation that we could see character being molded inside of us that we could literally look back and say I used to be afraid of this and that but I'm not afraid anymore I used to run but but now I I I I I'm willing to embrace every direction the Lord puts me in Lord may this word become re material materialized in each one of our Lives May we all have a testimony down the road that we we took your word Lord we applied it to our as the prophet said that you desire to see character inside of us which is Hebrews 138 that you're the same inside of us as you were in the body of Jesus Grant it father bless each brother here bless each sister here you see the desire in their heart to see this word alive in them Lord I believe if we ask uh for a lifting of hands who wanted uh this more of this character that you desired as each one would would would live lift their hands Desiring it Lord you see our hearts and I pray now that you would Grant to each one of us the victory that we desire to see manifested in this church in every believer Grant it Lord we thank you for these things in
