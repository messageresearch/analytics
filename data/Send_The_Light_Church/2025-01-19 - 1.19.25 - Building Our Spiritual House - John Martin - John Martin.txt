that we could ask or even think and he made it so easy he says if you just draw nigh to me I'll draw nigh to you amen amen and our hearts are here because we want to draw closer to the Lord really appreciate all those songs I do believe that those songs really complement the message this morning we want to talk about building our spiritual house if you'd like to turn with me for opening scripture in St John Chapter 7 we actually read these scriptures in our men's uh meeting last Wednesday and it just it pricked a thought when it came to our heart and so we just want to U maybe elaborate a little bit more on building our spiritual house amen before we breathe God's precious word let's just bow our hearts and look uh to him in a word of prayer this morning Heavenly Father we do thank you that you've given us this this building to meet together in that there's there is a place that's dedicated to you and to the uplifting of your word and uh to to the yielding of ourselves into your presence and and this morning Lord we thank you that we have a place that we can come and just be ourselves to worship you in spirit and in truth and not to worry about what others would be thinking because Lord we're we're all your children and all desire ing Lord to be prepared ready for you when you would return now Lord we ask you this this morning as our hearts have been uh prepared through the worship through prayer through meditation Lord uh allow us not to miss one thing that you would have for us this morning Lord open our eyes open our hearts open our ears open our understanding Lord may we leave here uh with more of you than when we came yes Lord we love you we thank you Lord just bless Thy word now to each of us we humbly pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen Matthew 7: 24 says therefore whosoever heareth these Saints of mine and doth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them shall be liken unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rain descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall of it and it came to pass when Jesus had ended these sayings the people were astonished at the doctrine at his Doctrine for he taught them as one having Authority and not as the scribes amen God bless you you may be seated um well every one of us at one time or another has either owned a house lived in a house or visited a house and stayed there a while and there are a lot of uh components that go up to making a house and a lot of things that can go wrong even today we're still working on a a furnace that's been given us problems for a couple months I think and uh every house needs continual maintenance it's it's a lot to to build it up but then after it's built it needs it it needs maintenance every house must be built according to the colds of the state or the the county or or the city or the township this one we built it it had to be built uh according to the colds and you just can't build uh your house any way you want to just because it's your house you still have to work in accordance uh to the cods of that area so regular inspections are needed need to be performed and inspectors come in they want to make sure that it's done exactly to how it's written now the whole purpose of a house is to have a place to live a place of shelter a place to dwell a place that you can feel comfortable and relaxed from not just the elements that are uh in the world the the like the cold the temperature uh uh the wind and the snow and the rain and the storms but also a place that you can come in from A busy life from work from from problems and just kind of come in and have a place of com comfort and there are things that we need to do if we want God to uh continue to live inside of US 1 Corinthians 6:19 says what know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you and ye are of God and you are not your own so our bodies are a house for God and the Bible says you are bought with a price therefore glorify God in your body and in your spirit which are gods and 2 Corinthians 6:19 just trying to lay a foundation that our body is God's house and what agreement have the temple of God with Idols for you are the Temple of the Living God as God has said I will dwell in them I will dwell in them I will walk in them and I will be their God and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate sayith the Lord and touch not the unclean and unclean thing and I will receive you so here it is that God wants to dwell in us but we have to come out of something well amen it it can't be where our body is at it has to be where our mind and our desires our spirit are in the wrong things they're in the things of the world and we have to come out of those things in order for God to live inside of us and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters say sayeth the Lord Almighty now God has chosen us to dwell in yet he just doesn't automatically dwell in us just because we've been baptized this is just the beginning uh of a building process and there are a lot of things that can go wrong when you're building I I I I put a number of buildings up I did a number of Foundations I I had to redo stuff and there are a lot of things that that um if I could say it like this um that God needs to convince us of uh to to to to we we think we've got it we've done this this is all that's been needed but Jesus said in John 16:12 I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear it now how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come will guide you into all truth and will show you how things need to be we need the comfort of the holy spirit in our heart in our mind and all around us through us in our minds our our thinking our emotions our we need the Holy Ghost to help Comfort us so we can change our lives because if we just sit and we hear a bunch of or dos and don'ts of what we have to do it is just we just don't want to do it amen because we can't take it we can't take the pain we don't enjoy it but we literally need to feel the presence of God the anesthetic to what it's okay to give up these things it's okay to come out of this it's okay to to start doing these things amen and that's the building of our spiritual House 2 Corinthians 5:17 therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold All Things become new and all things are of God so I you talk about a change you're talk about a change I mean if you were right now in Hawaii it'd be a different it'd be a if we could just go like that be in Hawaii right now what a change of weather that would be am right or or if we could just be uh a pig just like that a pig that's a bad one maybe a bear maybe a bear I mean what a change that would be and there is such a change between being a regular human being and being a Christian am there's such a major change it's not uh it's not a human going to church and saying he's a Christian no being born again is your Nature has changed so when we make a decision to follow God repent and get baptized the construction begins our spiritual he starts and we Let Jesus begin to build our life the correct way because before Jesus we just did what we want and we didn't have our parents never told us now you make sure you do everything you want to do no a child from its youth wants to do everything it wants to do the parent has to say no no no we don't do that this is what we do amen right and so when God comes into our life we have to learn to yield our life to God his disciples were all tore up here in St John chapter 14 you like to turn or see it watch this up here because Jesus was leaving them soon and he said here in verse one of St John 14 let not your heart be troubled you believe in God believe also in me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you into myself that where I am there you may be also now Christ is preparing a place for us now that word preparing means providing or making ready and that's what Christ is doing he's providing a place for us and it's in his presence it's not a geographic location he's he's preparing a place in his presence for us it's not a geographic location God is already there in this place and he wants us to be there with him he said that where I am there you may be also so he's already there he's preparing it so we can be there with him amen now Christ is not looking to construct a natural building that's made with hands for us to live in God construction is an invisible building you cannot even see it with natural eyes second Corinthians 51 says for we know that if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a building of God a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens so we have a spiritual house that's being built right now Jesus said where that that that where I there where I am there you may be also so in order for us to be where Christ is at we must have the same character that Christ has in order for to be with him and this is probably the biggest thing that we could receive out of this Christ is not going to dwell with devils in fact he told us to come out to be separate so that means we just can't go there because our name is John Mark right you know and he likes gospel songs that doesn't put me in heaven he's there he's there and he's preparing a place that I can get there well he's not preparing his presence he's not preparing Heaven he's preparing us to get there and and and so the mansion that he's building is inside us and we've gone through this just a little bit but we want to bring out a a a point here to um God is the one that inhabits eternity he dwells in the high and holy place and just going to describe a couple things where of God's presence first Peter tells us that but he but as he is which have called you is Holy so be ye holy in all manner of conversation because he but because it is written be ye holy for I am Holy so when we think about where God is at there he wants us to be also he's in a holy place and he wants us to be holy are you with me Matthew 5 be ye therefore perfect even as your father which is in heaven is perfect so this place in heaven is a place of of perfectness and and God wants us to be there with him so he's preparing us to be there with him he's not going to change heaven for us he's not going to carve out a little place of heaven and say well you know what you don't have to be you can just be any way you want to and I'm going to put you over here that won't be like that because if that could be like that for one person I think the Devils could be there to be complete is to be complete in God's character and God's character is not only possessing perfect love but it's manifesting it's manifesting it even to our enemies remember brother Brandon says whatever you do get perfect love he said nothing else but perfect love will be there right so in order to be where Christ is at we must have the same love and the same character and he's calling us to press in to that place that's the that's the building that's the building process and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself that where I am there you may be also God will not receive US unless we're prepared amen and God is preparing us how by his word Ephesians 5:26 says God sanctifies and cleanses the church with the the washing of the Water by the word that he might present to himself a glorious Church which he dwells in not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that we should be holy and without blemish see if we're not prepared we have no spiritual house right we just can't go on the basis that I've repented I got baptized and I accepted Jesus Christ as my savior this is such a false conception because if that's all that was needed that's all that needed to be written in the Bible he would never say search the scriptures he would say search that scripture so when we start we're just starting the building process but our whole character needs to become like his John 1717 Jesus speaking here he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy Word is truth so there's that process of coming out and sanctifying and cleansing we take baths we take showers we do that with the purpose of getting clean am and and and with God we we want God to cleanse our heart we want God to cleanse our life we want God to take out the wrong character we want to become more like Christ and if that desire is strong enough then you want to build your spiritual house you think about this every the Bible says that hell was created for the devil and his angels unfortunately all that believe them go there too but here's the thing there won't be one devil or one person in hell that at one point will not wish they were in heaven but there won't be one person in heaven that will regret being in heaven if we never get prepared we will never have our spiritual house the bride of Christ will take the word of God and will become the manifested word in this hour Revelations 19:7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb has come and his wife have made herself ready well what did she do she went to church she heard the word and she took the word and she said I'm going to start doing that and and if you miss that process in your life if you just come to church if you just listen if you just read but you do not take the word and you do not make it part of your life you will not be prepared you will not be ready amen now we are workers together with Christ 2 Corinthians 6 tells us this so when you read your Bible that is God's desire of us when we hear the five-fold ministry uh Ministry uh gospel preached to us that is God speaking to us when we pray when we listen to types something comes to our remembrance that's the Holy Ghost speaking to us you need to pay attention this you need to do this that is God speaking to us that's God doing his part but how do we work together with him we say Okay Lord I'll move those bricks I'll do that and that's you working together with Christ to build your house it isn't like I'm I'm I I I go to prepare a place for you and don't worry about anything I'll take care of it it ain't like that anymore you can just do what you want I'll take care of it all expenses paid no must Jesus bear the cross alone no there's a cross for me We Must Die daily let the and give God our will amen give God our will this is God working in you in your spiritual house we're workers together by obeying the word of God Philippians chapter 2 vers2 I love this scripture because this really is the essence of the working of God building inside of us Philippians chap 2:12 wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling so it is God in you working God in you speaking and he says work out this salvation work out your own you know too often we're worried about somebody else's and we're not working on our own we need to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling in other words I could be wrong it may not pass cold I may not make it I I I may be just one thing thou lackest there needs to be some fear and trembling about building not just this casual in need of nothing lukewarm I'm G to make it because I feel good no for it is God which worketh in you I love that for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure see I go to prepare a place for you that where I'm at you may be there also God is coming into our hearts not not just our physical heart now I'm talking about our spiritual heart amen I'm talking about where the desire of our character is at he's coming in there and he's working in you to change change to change change now here's the thing if we don't want to change then we don't want to be in God's presence you're not going to get in God's presence and feel like you don't have to change that is not the nature of God I do believe that God's blessings just come and they shower sometimes I do I do believe that the refreshing I do but I also believe that the character of God is not to leave us as children but to grow up and so there's change that's needed God don't need to change God don't need to change to fit the way we think things ought to be we're the ones that need the change I just love this for it is God which worketh in you both to Will to do of his good pleasure I'm so glad that God can speak to my heart do all things do all your working without murmurings and disputings oh whatever okay I will that don't look like a love affair that you want to be with Jesus that you may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation which whom you shine as lights in the world holding forth the word of life that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain I believe this with all my heart there'll be more people who miss it who started the race than those that started the race and finish because most people start the race and think all you got to do is this this and this and everything's okay you got to keep going you got to hold your confidence steadfast to the end you got to be I am determined the bride remember the Bride is a small group there there there there was a a a church in the church and that church in the church heard the voice that was in the voice so it's not for everybody but I'll say it like this for the bride they hunger for that voice they hunger for the Revelation they hunger to see the change they hunger to see Christ manifest in their life they will not be satisfied until they awake in his likeness now all we have to do is come to Christ that's all we have to do and when we come to him we have to do what he wants us to do amen John 14:2 in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and I will receive you unto myself that where I am you may be also so where is Christ if he's given us his word where is Christ Christ is in his word Christ is the word verse four and whether I go you know and the way you know and Thomas sayith Lord we know not whether thou goest and how can we know the way and Jesus saith unto him I I am am the way I am the truth I am the life and no man cometh to the father but by me if he had known me you should have known the my father also and from hence forth you know him and have seen him so the way to the father's house is through Christ and Christ alone and Christ is the word St John 1 verse one says in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was God this is why it's important to read the Bible right there because this is who God is we can't go to church and listen to Somebody speak behind the pulpit and say that's God because which church do we go to which God but this is God that's why it's important to come to church bring your Bible and make sure that brother John is reading out of the black out of the book I'm just trying to provoke you to get more serious with the word and not just have the comfort of coming to church and and hearing A good sermon a bad sermon however you want to say it's we must find Christ for oursel and Christ is in the word verse two the same was in the beginning with God and all things were made by him and without him not anything was not anything made that was made the word Christ made everything and the word verse 14 verse 14 the word was made flesh and it dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as the only begotten of the father full of grace and full of Truth we cannot separate Jesus Christ from the word they are identical that same the Bible says he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my word have one that will judge him the word that I have spoken unto him shall judge him in the last day this very same word that people reject today is the very same word that they will meet on the day of judgment amen and this is the only thing right here is the only thing that can change my nature this word is the only thing that can change my nature when I read it and I say oh I am not doing that then conviction comes says oh Lord help me and that help me is what God is looking for amen that's what he's looking for the Lord help me if you if you come to church hear the word but you don't have Lord help me he can't prepare you we're be we're we're only only hearers of the word and not doers then Colossians 2:9 says for in him dwells all the fullness of the godhead body and ye are complete in him I love that you are complete right Jesus said be ye perfect that means complete you are complete in him which is the head of all principalities and Powers so the more you can get in him the better get in them all the way wherever you're at get in them more don't dabble in the question I'm in there far enough do not do that stay away from that Paul never had that mentality he didn't say I've apprehended I've attained I'm in there far enough no his attitude was I need more to know you more to have more of you oh I want to know in the power of your Resurrection in The Fellowship of your sufferings am there's got to be more I'm pressing towards it that's where we need to be with our desire the more that we desire that I'm not talking about knowing god knowledge I'm talking about knowing god by experience the more you're willing to change the more you touch the heart of God because see God is already there in you he's already working talking speaking but if we're doing things with murmuring and complaining or we're just kind of resisting just kind of putting off or just hoping that our conscience can be satisfied with just going to church and we're not really getting serious with God then we're not building our spiritual house and tell me when it's all over when life is all over where is your spiritual health going to be because if you're not building here it's not going to be there that's right that's how serious it needs to be Colossians 1:15 Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God the firstborn of every creature Romans tells us the firstborn among many Brethren verse 16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven and that Earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions principalities or Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is our head he is the head of the body the church the the word the word of God is our head Hallelujah the word of God is our head not our reasoning not our thinking not our emotions not what we want to do what we don't want to do what we pick and choose the word is the head the Capstone who is the beginning the first born from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence for it pleased the father that in him should dwell should dwell should all fullness dwell I think that's what God wants with with us have you ever been in a um a a a fight with somebody I don't mean physically but to where you're having a battle about what you're going to do what you're going to eat where you're going to go has anybody ever been in that before I mean this is kind of a common thing right now at that time that you're in a battle and kids are like this with parents and parents are like this with kids both both parties is wanting the preeminence I I want my way I want my way you had your way last time I want my way God wants his way in her life and we've got to be real with God that we're the ones that fighting against him that we can we can say Amen to the word but we're not going to submit to the word right it's a in other words we we can agree with the word but that's not what the word amen means amen doesn't say I agree with it amen means so be it in me so be it let it happen in me and and and we've got to give God the preeminence that's why when we come to church we hear the word we need to enter into that word God let it be preeminent in my life I I don't don't mean it wrong but a song leader should not stand up here and say we need to praise the Lord there should be something inside of us praising the Lord give him the preeminence he inhabits the Praises of his people our opening scripture in Matthew 24 7:24 every building needs a proper Foundation therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and doeth them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the Reigns you said descended the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it was and it fell not Why didn't it fall for it was founded upon a rock and everyone that heareth the Saints of mine and doeth them not shall be liken unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand the rain descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great great was the fall of it now here Jesus is identifying his words as being a solid rock Foundation to every man's life Jesus said Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it in other words the rains descended the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house when it's built on the house when it's built upon Christ the word I don't care what trial goes on in your life it will stand because you made Christ your dwelling place now the story in the Bible about the Great Walls of of Jericho they fell we remember the story I mean this these walls were 13 foot tall about and they were about six foot wide now that is a pretty strong wall right this is much thinner that's much thinner that's probably 8 in and that's concrete that you know you're not going to knock that down but these babies were 6 foot wide but they fell and they fell when the when the trials came because it was not built on the word of God I I can't believe I didn't hear one amen with that thing look if Jericho would have been standing on the word of God it'd be standing am so it it don't matter how great our life is how much money we got wherever we're standing if our life isn't built on Christ it's not going to stand so we need our foundation to be Christ the word we must make sure that we build upon we build our spiritual house upon God's word it's the only foundation Ephesians 2:20 we are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Christ Jesus himself being the Chief Cornerstone that's why we can have confidence when we're reading the Bible here and the words are not written and read that they were written by the Apostles of God it's still the word of God I've heard some people say well I believe what Jesus said uh father son Holy Ghost over what Peter said because he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's just somebody that is caral has no spiritual understanding has not got the Revelation the word is not going to contradict itself I'd rather doubt myself than doubt the word because the word is perfect all right verse 21 in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth into a holy Temple in the Lord in whom you also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit notice through the spirit I just I just we just we ought to long for the Holy Spirit to cool over us woo over us and begin to to work in our heart and speak to us and say this is what I want you to do son this is what I want you to do daughter this is the next step in your life this is what I want you to take not sit there and wait I really want God to compliment me on how well I'm doing I think we need to as that song we sung when we first started humble yourself let him have his way God is serious about building you a place we have to be serious about working with him have a little bit more fear and trembling have a little bit I could be wrong maybe I missed something maybe do what the prophet said which is come to the house of the Lord with an attitude to find out where you're at with Christ because it's a working in the spirit realm it's not the natural ears and the natural mind and the understanding it's it's really seeing God that he's here 1 Corinthians chapter 3:9 says for we are laborers together with God ye are God's husbandry and ye are God's Building according to the grace of God given which is uh I'm sorry according to the grace of God which is given to me as a wise master builder in other words Paul made sure he made everything according to cold before he penned it he made sure the the Bible says that the the Bible was not written by men of old but they were holy men of old as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost and he's a wise master Builder we have to be wise Master Builders we have to make sure that what we're doing is really a pleasing to the Lord you know one of the the hardest things I I I I think has has hurt so many uh Christians is they get used to their their their Church attendance as being the only thing that they need to do to please God in other words they're not even thinking about a building process there are people in this message who just feel that all they got to do is just be here and agree with what me with the preacher saying they're going to miss it according to the grace of God which is given unto me as a wise master builder I have laid the foundation and another build it thereon but let every man take heed now let him take heed how he builth there on thereup take heed no I got baptized I repented no every day you're building we're in a building process for other Foundation can no man lay than that which is laid which is Jesus Christ and the word is our foundation that's what he gave us and every decision for the rest of our life should be based upon the word of God that should be what's pumping in every decision not well this is church I'll leave church here and now I'm going to go and live my life and and do what I want to do and you know when uh when it comes Church T I'm G to come back to church and we're g to talk about the word h that means that that thinking is more like I got a natural mansion on the other side I got a natural Mansion we have a chance to be working with Christ on this project and all we have to do is Lord what what would you have me to do what you have me to do and it may seem so simple he may say something like this I want you to start praying 20 minutes every day it may be that simple whatever it is like Mary said whatever he say just do it just do it because it'll lead to the next thing then the next thing and then the next thing the Bible says Psalms 1119 th word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path we need this word this is why we need to read it and and and think about it and say Lord help me to do it we must read our Bible every day as often as you can and just ask God in Simplicity God help me help me to build with you to to work with you you ever work with somebody they were just so stubborn oh I had I had somebody that worked with me they're so stubborn I would say guaranteed most people could not work with them but I was so much into being in unity that I did not care about having the preeminence it's a truth and you know what was happening then brother Marty is God was building my character that's what was happening it it didn't have anything to do with trusted tool it had to do with God wanting to have preeminence in me because when it's all said and done that thing's blowing up that thing's burning and no matter what's left over right it's still going but what's going to remain is our character that the most important thing is give God preeminence give God pre let the word be preeminent in your life second othy 3:5 we read these scriptures in our our men's meeting as well last Wednesday the holy scriptures that the holy scriptures are able to make us wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus in other words when you believe that that scripture is truly for you personally all the scriptures all scripture is given by the inspiration of God man didn't have anything to do with it it was all God and it's profitable for our Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction in righteousness that we the men of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works right how beautiful now usually when we build a home we start from the ground and we work our way up we we don't we don't put the foundation in and say okay let's put the roof on right we we we start with the walls and we start at the bottom we we work our way up and sometimes it's a twostory and you got to go up and you go up as far as you're going to go and then you put a you put the cap on it the roof on it and and then you begin to cover the outside and then you you you put your inside walls in and then you got all your your electrical and you got your plumbing and you got your heating and you got your special hey can you bring me up some coffee you know your your little thing from one room to the Next Room whatever else called it your Cal intercom got your thermostat all that in the walls you got your shoot for the clothes to go down all that stuff has to be worked in and then you you begin to you put your drywall on and you you you you you paint it and you you get it looking like what a nice place to be because you certainly want want to live in a house without drywall looking at all that stuff not enjoyable so you got to understand that when God is working in your life no matter what you want him to work on he may be working on something underneath that and and brother BR said like this God is not obligated to give you anything more if you don't do what he's already said so it's important to pay attention that every word of God is important to God it ought to be important to us so a there's no different with our our our lives we're we have a spiritual house we're building but I'll say it like this what is our spiritual house just just trying to put it in a perspective right here so we can get an idea what is God's spiritual house or what is our spiritual house it is nothing but the character of Jesus Christ you can write that in you can take that you can meet yourself all the way to heaven on that your spiritual house is the character of Jesus Christ amen that is what we should be building in our life is the character of Christ the character of Christ is already there he is there he is character that's what he dwells in but he's trying to build it in US am he's trying to prepare it in us and if we don't let him have prence we'll never have the character you know we may have a bunch of stickers and a bunch of I I uh I I I've got church attendance I've got this I've got that I I've spoken tongues i' I've done many good works I've I've prophesied we can maybe have those things but if we do not have the character of Christ we really do not have a spiritual house to stand in because Jesus said I know you've done all those things but you know what depart from me right depart from me other words I did not prepare that what I prepared is character so we're workers together with Christ to build his character in us which means we got to get rid of our character all right I want to read these kind of quick because we got some stuff to move through that's why I'm moving kind of fast are you getting something out of this all right second Peter chap 1:3 talking about that starting at the bottom and working our way up according as his divine power has given unto us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to glory and virtue whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these you would be partakers of God's divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in in the world through lust so there it is come out of her my people be separate in your life you should be able to to to note that these are the evil things that I need to get away from right these are the evil things that are trying to attack me these are the evil things coming through the screen these are the evil things that are coming through our phones we are about to identify uh you know this this thing of of hatred this thing of uh I'm going to put my will first that's an evil thing right and we got to separate that and and know that we've got to come to Christ all right and besides this let's give all diligence we add to the foundation of our faith virtue right the first is Faith I believe that what the preacher said is right I believe what the word says I believe I believe that what I need to do is repent get baptized that's the beginning that's my foundation and now I'm going to start building my house so we from uh from virtue from faith we add virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness godliness brotherly kindness and I'm telling you that's a lot of stuff that's a lot of stuff I mean don't try to add brotherly kindness if you don't got any strength if you don't got any knowledge if you don't got patience and temperance because you need those things to build brotherly kindness and brotherly kindness charity we've talked about charity is the Capstone I'll say it like this charity is the Capstone to every believer's character it is the character of Christ for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you should nether be un fruitful neither be Barren or UNF nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ now you know want to know what knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ is the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ is not I'm gonna pull out that scripture that's not the knowledge of Jesus Christ the knowledge of Jesus Christ is you got a a situation going on right here and God comes to the Forefront with what is need to meet that need that's where we should not be Barren and unfruitful we should have Christ alive in our life Christ moving in our life that's what Christ is Desiring to be preeminent so he can take care of things but he that lath these things is blind and cannot see a far off and has forgotten that he was purged from his old sins wherefore the rather Brethren give some diligence to make your calling and ction sure for if you do these things you shall never fall you know most people don't even know what the word sure means hey would you would you like a coffee or pop or juice or milk or yeah sure sure sure sure is sure sure is this is a screen this is a picture this is wood that's sure sure is sure and we need to make sure our election is sure and we can't get that Assurance you know all you got to do is just look at where you're being drawn to the change that's happening we ought to be able to come to church and I don't care how long we've been going to church we ought to be coming to church and saying things are changing in my life that's how close things ought to be because God said he's not going to take you until you're most ready obviously we all here on the same bow we're not ready yet so I believe in testimonies we should be testifying for so in entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ now our spiritual house is God's own character God dwells in his own character so if you want God to dwell in you more then you get more of God's character he said he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him right the Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of God and and obviously there's not enough Holy Ghost to just we the holy ghost does not dwell in us to in a fullness measure that's why we sin we backslide we make mistakes I we we understand that but here's the thing God gives you just enough that he he wants you to walk in that light walk in the light as he is in the light and so he gives us more light to walk in and if we're obedient we walk in that light then you know what he does he gives himself more to you he fills you with more joy more peace more love more more more happiness more everything but trying to be a Christian and not not be committed is the most miserable life a person could live he'd rather he' be better off being out in the world having nothing to do with God and I and and that's that was the advice that Jesus gave I'd rather have you hey make a decision cold or hot but this lukewarm hypocrisy Jesus said by this shall all men know what's this by this characteristic by this characteristic shall all men know that you're my disciples when you have love one for another when you have the character to love the way that God loves not I mean look at one time we all loved our parents even if we don't like him now that sounded bad right there was a point in our life that we just didn't really care about our parents or we didn't agree with them or we yelled at them and got mad and whatever you understand what I'm saying but I forgive you it's okay let's go forward I'm not talking about that type of love I'm talking about the type of love that it doesn't matter what anybody does to you that you still love them now I'm not saying you won't go through a 60-second moment of battle I mean that's just human that's realistic but you don't Harbor things inside you don't keep things inside and then still say you got the love of God that that's not it God does not dwell in power alone he dwells in character Satan dwells in power alone but he manipulates and he controls others with his power but he has no character where Jesus comes to us we sit here we listen to a sermon he gives us his word and he gives us the choice the choice would you like to come closer to me or would you are you satisfied with where you're at that's character so he has power but he doesn't manipulate God dwells in character and if I could say this if I could say in this way the Capstone of God's character is divine love first John chapter 4:12 no man have seen God at any time can anybody say they've seen God let me read this again brother no man has seen God at any time no well we got to understand in the way that John wrote it because remember God's an invisible God but we do see him by Revelation amen if we love but but the point that he's trying to say is that no man has seen God right but if we love one another then God dwells in us and his love is perfected in us so we came can't prove it with these eyes but if he's loving through us if he's manifesting that love through us then it proves that we do see him hereby know we that we dwell in him talking about our spiritual house and he in us because he has given us of his Spirit verse 16 and we have known and believed the love that God have to us God is love God is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God and God in him so is the thing that we don't think that much of which is honestly being able to love those that we got a problem with that little thing that we don't put much attention to is really the proof of whether we're dwelling in Christ or not because we it is very we are born with the ability to have respected persons I go to Dad Dad give me this no Mom Mom can I have that thing that Dad wouldn't give me yes you know I love you son oh Mama you're the best we have no problem being respected persons with one another but to have no respect a person that means to love even your enemy the same can I can I do some quotes I'm done with the word but can I do some some quotes thank you if not I'm sorry I'm still going to do them this is the quotes I would say on the importance of God's character in our life brother BR said Thea Church agent says think it not strange concerning the fiery trials which are to try you that it was what Peter said it is strange that God wants us to develop a Christlike character that comes through suffering and we all have trials we are all tried and chastened as Sons not one but goes through that the church that is not suffering and is not being tried hasn't got it isn't of God and he quotes Hebrews while for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scorches every son that and whom he receiveth but if he be without chastisement wherefore all are partakers then you are bastards and not Sons so we're not to think it's strange that we have trials trials is what opens the door for us to get character trials are not bad trials are saying this is God knocking on the door and saying I am here you have a chance to get more like me that's what a trial is and that's why we're to Rejoice count it all joy because we have now an opportunity to become like him because sitting in a chair at church and hearing the word of God does not bring character even if you get a revelation you still got to go out and be tried and th th Ty Church age brother B says in in fact patience is the outcome of faithfulness patience is the outcome of faithfulness I love that because we all want patience right but we don't want the trials I'll say it like this learn to be more faithful for it says in James 1:3 that the tri of your faith worketh patience there's absolutely no other way in which to gain patience it has to come by the trial of your faith amen tribulation Romans 5:3 tribulation worketh patience how highly God regards this outworking of our patience is seen in James 1:4 but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect and entire lacking nothing God's will for us is perfection and that Perfection is patience waiting on God and waiting on God and this is the process of character development how highly God commanded commanded these things the this is the process of God's character can I do a couple more but this is a go this is the gold of God 1 Peter 1:7 that the trial of your faith be much more precious than gold that perisheth the gold of God is a Christlike character produced in the fire furnace of Affliction that is the right kind of gold so we know in in in Revelations when he's talking to the Le oysan church and he says come buy of me gold he's really saying come buy of me the Christlike character that you need to go through your trial but what kind of gold does the church have today it has but the worldly gold that perisheth it's it is Rich it is complacent it is made an affluence the m Maj criteria of of of spirituality the evidence of God's blessing and the correctness of Doctrine is now based upon how rich folks are involved in it have you ever heard about politics in a church have you ever heard about a church um usually being run by the guy or the girl who has the most money come on that's what brother Bram is saying here here that's what he's saying here he says you better come before it's too late thus sayith the Lord and buy of me gold tried in the fire and then you will be truly Rich are we getting it listen to me naked we came into the world I said naked physically we came into the world but naked spiritually we will not leave it oh no we are going to take something with us what that something is all we can take with us nothing less and nothing more so we had better be real careful now to see what we're what what to see that we take something that will make us right before God so then what will we take with us we will take our character brother that is what we'll take with us now what kind of character will you take with you will it be like his who chose whose character was molded by suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction or will be the softness of this character of leoan people he says it's up to each and every one of us for in that day every man will bear his own burden all right one more one more why does he stand by this the reason is Romans 81 1718 and if children then Heirs of God and Joint Heirs of Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present world are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reain you might as would just sit here and say Lord I really want to be more like you I'm really willing to start doing more what you want me to do the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory and not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share his throne on the same basis that he overcame and sat down with his father on his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him and the little suffering that we go through now is not worthy to be compared with the tremendous Glory that shall be revealed in us when he comes oh what a treasure is laid up for those who are willing to enter in his kingdom through much tribulation you know the prophet gave us the greatest advice that could be given to us after he came back from Beyond the curtain of time and he just simply said whatever you do lay aside everything else and get perfect love I want you to think about this the next time you're going through a trial lay aside what you want and get perfect love say not my will Lord thy will be done it's to suffer all you're you're gaining the character of God yeah you may be losing your will you may be losing what you want to have at that moment but you're gaining him lay aside everything and get perfect love because it is the Capstone if I could say it like that the Capstone of God's character and that's what he's dwelling in he dwells in love love amen let's Stand Together God bless you thank you for your patience oh let's just sing that course I I need I need him I need you I no I need him what am I saying I am so needy am so needy I am so
