[40:43] moment he just he just kind of forgot
[40:48] the scripture he just got like a brain
[40:51] fog so he's just he just well all the
[40:55] scripture is good so he just throws out
[40:57] a Psalm Psalms Psalms 387 and so with
[41:01] all 100 people he signs his name and put
[41:03] Psalms 387 under every one of them so
[41:06] after the end when he's done he's Lord I
[41:10] just sure let that be a good one let
[41:12] that be a good
[41:13] one so he read it and this is what it is
[41:17] for my loins are filled with lome
[41:20] disease with a loome disease and there's
[41:24] no soundness in my
[41:25] flesh so you can imagine all 100 people
[41:29] are now looking this up and saying this
[41:31] is his favorite scripture we need to
[41:33] pray for him so I I I just I don't want
[41:36] to take any chances I just want to write
[41:37] down the scriptures make sure I got the
[41:39] right
[41:41] one life is filled with a lot of twists
[41:44] and
[41:45] turns things happen all around us things
[41:48] happen to us from other people but
[41:52] there's nothing that's more important
[41:54] than what happens inside of us amen and
[41:57] so for a subject this morning we want to
[41:59] look at God leading us to the character
[42:03] a a character relationship with him now
[42:05] we we all know God to some measure amen
[42:08] but God has greater sights in mind than
[42:11] just leading us
[42:13] partway so we want to entitle this
[42:15] message our guide a guide is someone who
[42:18] who shows us around we've all been
[42:21] probably on some sort of tour
[42:24] guide and usually that guide is is
[42:27] telling us about the area that we're
[42:29] we're visiting maybe we're
[42:31] sightseeing learning about the history
[42:34] of some Town notice they've been
[42:38] trained they've been trained to to to to
[42:41] tell you about the area and and and you
[42:44] learn about things we could say that
[42:46] they've been there done that and a guide
[42:49] is someone that you can have confidence
[42:52] in now if you're going uh hunting in uh
[42:56] an area that you've never been before
[42:58] and it's it's filled with uh grizzly
[43:01] bears and and uh uh wild animals you you
[43:07] and and and snow can come anytime you
[43:09] you really want to have a guide with you
[43:12] amen there's been people that have died
[43:15] in the wilderness all because they did
[43:17] not have a guide they thought they could
[43:18] make it something happened something
[43:21] difficult happened maybe it got night
[43:23] the snow but there's many stories on
[43:26] people getting killed all because they
[43:28] did not have a guide to lead him
[43:31] through so a guide is someone who keeps
[43:34] you from getting lost he keeps you from
[43:35] getting into danger he's someone that
[43:38] advises and directs you in the right way
[43:40] to go
[43:42] am God even placed a North star in the
[43:45] sky to help us to know what true north
[43:48] is
[43:49] amen and a guide to help direct man in
[43:52] his travels God has placed an unmovable
[43:56] and unshakeable
[43:58] word for us to point us to True
[44:01] heaven and a living word which we want
[44:04] to get into the Holy Ghost is the Living
[44:07] Word to guide us to that relationship
[44:10] Amen brother Bram s in the message a
[44:12] guide he said that's the trouble with
[44:14] Christians today they wait till the
[44:16] darkness settles over them then they
[44:18] find out that they've they've been left
[44:22] without the
[44:24] guide we need a guide amen
[44:27] God has always had a guide for his
[44:29] people remember in the Old Testament
[44:32] when God would lead the children of
[44:34] Israel in the wilderness he he led them
[44:37] by Night by a a cloud uh a pillar of
[44:41] fire in the in in the day by a cloud and
[44:44] that was that was Jesus Christ the Holy
[44:47] Spirit leading them every single
[44:52] day but there's wrong
[44:55] guides there's there's wrong guides out
[44:59] there there are people there are
[45:01] churches if I could say it like this who
[45:05] think they're
[45:07] guiding but they're really
[45:10] blind they don't fully know what they're
[45:13] doing Abraham Lincoln was trying to
[45:16] bring a truth across uh and he was being
[45:20] rebutted and the questionnaire asked him
[45:23] or he asked the he asked the
[45:24] questionnaire because he was trying to
[45:26] bring a point of TR truth across and he
[45:27] said how many legs does a a calf have
[45:30] and he said
[45:31] four and uh Abraham said well what if
[45:35] his his what if we were to make his tail
[45:38] a leg then how many legs would he have
[45:40] and and the man said well well five and
[45:43] and Abraham Lincoln said it doesn't
[45:46] matter what we would
[45:49] call uh a leg a leg is on the truth is
[45:53] he only has four legs no matter what we
[45:55] would think amen and the and the point
[45:57] is there's many people who want to make
[45:59] truth a certain thing but truth is truth
[46:03] and that's all there is to it we we we
[46:06] we can imagine and wish God would do
[46:08] this and allow this and this would be
[46:10] okay but truth is truth it stands on its
[46:15] own Matthew chapter 23 verse 23 Jesus
[46:20] speaking here and he says' woe unto you
[46:22] scribes and Pharisees I'll call you
[46:25] hypocrites for you pay tithes of mint
[46:28] and Anis and uh common and have omitted
[46:32] the weightier matters of the word of God
[46:36] right
[46:38] judgment mercy and faith and look what
[46:42] he says here these ought you have these
[46:45] ought ye to have
[46:48] done and not to leave the other done so
[46:51] he's saying you he he's saying you you
[46:53] don't you shouldn't just not do the
[46:55] little things the little things are
[46:57] important don't leave those undone but
[46:59] don't leave out the most important
[47:00] things the weightier things amen and
[47:03] then he says in verse 24 he says you're
[47:06] blind
[47:07] guides you strand at a knat and swallow
[47:10] a camel you ever strain something with
[47:13] cheesecloth right you're trying to keep
[47:16] certain things to get out and they would
[47:18] they would strain the little gats but
[47:21] then they would open their mouth and put
[47:23] a camel in it the obvious thing the
[47:26] weigher matters amen there's war unto
[47:28] you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for
[47:30] you make clean the outside of the cup or
[47:34] and the and of the platter but
[47:37] within they are full of exorts and
[47:41] excess Thou blind Pharisees cleanse
[47:44] first the that which was within the cup
[47:46] and the platter that the
[47:49] outside uh of them may be clean as well
[47:52] in other words even though you clean up
[47:54] the outside you're not clean outside not
[47:56] the sight of God you have to clean the
[47:59] inside first and then the outside is
[48:01] clean Matthew
[48:03] 15:14 says let them alone let these
[48:09] these blind leaders these Hypocrites
[48:12] alone they be blind leaders of the
[48:17] blind in other words if you truly are
[48:19] searching for truth you're not going to
[48:21] stay in a church that's preaching half
[48:23] of
[48:24] it because the other path is
[48:28] Blindness he says just let them alone be
[48:31] they be blind leaders of the Blind and
[48:33] if the blind are leading the blind then
[48:36] both both shall fall in the ditch
[48:40] amen I don't want somebody leading me
[48:42] into a
[48:44] ditch I want somebody helping me get
[48:48] out so we want to watch who we're
[48:51] following we want to pay attention to
[48:53] who we're listening to we want to be
[48:55] careful to what ADV device that we're
[48:58] taking the spirit of air will always
[49:02] lead you into all the truth if I could
[49:05] say
[49:06] this the spirit of
[49:09] Truth
[49:13] um I'm not sure did I say that right
[49:17] thank you something just like not
[49:19] clicking there the spirit of air will
[49:22] always lead you away from part of the
[49:24] truth that's the statement I want to
[49:26] make
[49:27] see it's okay if you have some of the
[49:31] truth the devil don't mind that but he's
[49:34] always on working at getting you a
[49:37] little bit away from the
[49:40] truth where the spirit of God is always
[49:43] trying to lead you closer to the truth
[49:46] because the motive of God is to get you
[49:48] into all the truth am and and and the
[49:52] motive of the devil is to get you
[49:53] completely away from it but he can't
[49:56] just do that to you so he gives a little
[49:58] bit at a
[50:02] time the spirit of air will lead you to
[50:07] compromise with the word right it will
[50:10] lead you to settle for something less
[50:12] than what you already know to be the
[50:14] whole
[50:15] truth the spirit of Heir helps us to
[50:18] make excuses why we compromise with the
[50:22] word of God how many has how many has
[50:24] heard this this voice speak to you
[50:29] amen well I I'll raise my hand he's
[50:32] alive the the devil is doing his dirty
[50:36] work amen turn with me if you would to
[50:39] St
[50:41] John or first John I'm sorry 1 John
[50:43] chapter 4 I want to read some verses
[50:47] here uh trying we want to
[50:50] discern when when when there's so many
[50:52] voices right so so many thoughts that
[50:54] come into our head and we we got to
[50:57] we've got to be active in Discerning not
[50:59] just thinking that I always think good
[51:02] thoughts that only good thoughts that
[51:04] everything I think is right you can't be
[51:06] thinking that because God has allowed
[51:09] the enemy to speak to
[51:12] us and and it's our job to
[51:15] discern all right 1 John 4 ver1 says
[51:18] beloved believe not every Spirit but try
[51:23] the spirit where they are of God because
[51:25] many false prophets are gone out to the
[51:27] world so there's only two Spirits
[51:30] there's the spirit of God the spirit of
[51:31] the
[51:32] devil which would just call this the
[51:35] spirit of air for a second because we
[51:38] don't have to when we look at the Devil
[51:40] we look at we think of something that's
[51:42] just um solid black right right just
[51:47] nothing good but remember he's the tree
[51:49] of knowledge of
[51:50] Good and Evil so he he has he can appear
[51:54] as angels of light he can he he has
[51:57] enough truth to get your attention and
[51:59] says this is the way to go but really he
[52:01] won't Lead You In the right way verse
[52:03] two hereby know ye the spirit of God
[52:06] every spirit that confesseth that Jesus
[52:09] Christ is come in the flesh is of God
[52:11] and every spirit that confesseth not
[52:13] that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh
[52:15] is not of God and this is the spirit of
[52:17] antichrist which you have heard that it
[52:19] should come and even now
[52:24] already is it in the
[52:29] world every spirit that manifest Jesus
[52:33] Christ in your flesh is of
[52:37] God because he's the same yesterday
[52:39] today forever but every spirit that
[52:42] doesn't manifest it just speaks
[52:45] it it just wants to to to to have a show
[52:50] as it were to talk about it but it
[52:53] doesn't manifest it we're told
[52:57] to get away from that it's a spirit of
[53:01] error in other words a form of godliness
[53:05] but denying the power to manifest the
[53:08] word we're told to get away from that
[53:13] spirit because it will lead you away
[53:16] from Christ God wants to manifest
[53:19] himself in each of us do you believe
[53:21] that
[53:22] amen verse four ye are of God little
[53:26] children and have overcome them those
[53:29] those Spirits those those wrong uh uh uh
[53:34] false prophet those wrong Spirits
[53:36] because greater is he that's in you
[53:39] that's down deep inside you than he
[53:41] that's in the world now remember when
[53:43] you were in the world I'll remember when
[53:44] I was in the world I did not want to do
[53:47] anything
[53:48] that I didn't want to do basically
[53:52] anything that was against my will it
[53:54] became my enemy I wanted to do my will
[53:58] do my own thing and I I I felt uh the
[54:03] world was was was okay because it was a
[54:06] place that I could do what I wanted to
[54:07] do whereas you know when I was in my
[54:10] home I had to do what my dad said and
[54:12] you know I want to be free from that I
[54:14] want to get a car I want to feel the
[54:18] freedom so you you come to Christ and
[54:21] you learn that there's these spirits
[54:25] that are in the world and I just want to
[54:27] drop it down now the worldly nature that
[54:30] we were born
[54:31] with right so that's what we've got to
[54:35] overcome is that worldly nature and
[54:38] verse five says they are of the world
[54:40] therefore they speak therefore speak
[54:42] they of the world and the world heareth
[54:45] them we are of God and he that knoweth
[54:49] God heareth us and he that is not of God
[54:54] heareth not us hereby know we the spirit
[54:58] of truth and the spirit of air how
[55:00] important it is to be of
[55:04] God right because truth is important to
[55:08] you I'll just say if you belong to God
[55:10] truth is important to you the spirit of
[55:13] Truth is important to you I mean there
[55:15] was a time in my life that I didn't know
[55:19] God and Truth wasn't that important to
[55:23] me but once I learned that Jes Jesus is
[55:27] the truth he is the way he is the life
[55:30] then it became important to
[55:33] me so we've heard if a trumpet gives an
[55:36] uncertain sound how are we going to know
[55:39] to prepare for battle so the the word is
[55:43] truth and if we don't preach the word if
[55:46] we don't love the word we don't come
[55:48] become one with the word then you know
[55:51] we're going to end up being bombarded by
[55:54] the devil
[55:56] now did you ever notice when geese
[55:58] they're flying up in the sky they're
[56:00] always flying in a V
[56:04] formation and you notice that the geese
[56:08] they're not fighting over one another
[56:10] who's the
[56:11] leader right and they can all just you
[56:15] know come down in a in a big lake or a
[56:17] pond and I'll tell you when it's time to
[56:20] go uh uh e even if another flock will
[56:24] come uh when that when that uh the
[56:27] leader of of those geese when he starts
[56:30] cracking he starts giving his noise like
[56:33] a you know like geese do if there's
[56:35] anybody that knows how to do a geese
[56:37] sound right now would be real good to
[56:38] say it uh you know he'll start doing
[56:41] that they'll all start getting ready and
[56:43] all of a sudden he'll take off and all
[56:45] of them take off they don't say no we're
[56:47] not going
[56:49] right and I'll tell you we the children
[56:52] of God are led by the spirit of God and
[56:54] when God is leading in we just follow
[56:57] the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[56:59] there's no I got to think about it and I
[57:01] got to you know make sure it works out
[57:02] with me and if it doesn't then no we
[57:04] just work in the formation of the
[57:06] leadership of the Holy Ghost amen
[57:09] because we need that for our lives amen
[57:12] anything short of it will miss
[57:15] it I want to make a statement here and I
[57:17] want to try to try to back it up try to
[57:20] prove it by the
[57:21] scriptures God has set back the holy
[57:24] spirit to guide us into a perfect
[57:26] relationship with
[57:27] him you can't just read that verse but
[57:31] that is the
[57:33] truth and the reason I want to bring
[57:36] that out is because I want us to focus
[57:38] you know because often we'll say well
[57:40] I've got the Holy Ghost and then we'll
[57:43] forget about a
[57:44] relationship right amen but the purpose
[57:47] of the Holy Ghost is to lead us back to
[57:49] a perfect relationship with him and I'm
[57:51] saying perfect I mean
[57:54] complete and so what does God want
[57:57] hopefully we'll have time to get through
[57:58] it but I'll say like this God wants
[58:00] preeminence in our life amen Nicodemus
[58:04] came to Jesus by night and he said uh we
[58:07] know that thou are a teacher come from
[58:09] God no man can do the things that thou
[58:11] doest except God uh he be of God right
[58:14] now even though Nicodemus Jesus said he
[58:17] was a master of Israel he still needed a
[58:21] guide to the new
[58:23] birth and every single person that's
[58:26] born in this world that if they're going
[58:28] to make it the heaven they've got to be
[58:31] borned again because those are the words
[58:32] of Jesus Christ and I'll say it like
[58:34] this we need a guide to be born
[58:38] again we just can't make it on our own
[58:40] and think we got it all figured
[58:43] out that's what the Holy Ghost is for is
[58:45] to guide us to a perfect relationship a
[58:48] complete birth a complete birth there's
[58:51] a lot of people who partially get born
[58:54] again that's and they say they got the
[58:57] new birth but it's not all the way
[59:00] because if it was all the way they would
[59:01] never go back brother Orlando right they
[59:05] would never go back
[59:08] amen and that's why it's important to
[59:11] make sure we get all the holy ghost that
[59:13] God has for
[59:16] us a lot of people think that since
[59:19] Jesus died at Calvary for their sins and
[59:22] they repented and and they got baptized
[59:25] that
[59:26] um they're going to go to
[59:28] heaven so what would be the need of
[59:32] pursuing more Holy Ghost it's like two
[59:35] different subjects to them are you with
[59:37] me amen the Bible tells us 1 Corinthians
[59:40] 12:12 if you want to write it down by
[59:41] one Spirit are we all baptized into the
[59:44] body of Jesus Christ amen we need to be
[59:47] baptized with the Holy Ghost
[59:51] amen right I'll say like this we need to
[59:54] stay baptized with the Holy Ghost
[59:59] we need to keep we need to keep the oil
[1:00:01] flowing amen there's more to Heaven than
[1:00:06] what Jesus has done for you there's more
[1:00:09] to Heaven than just what Jesus done for
[1:00:12] you what is there more it's
[1:00:16] about about what you've done for
[1:00:22] Jesus in other words if it was just what
[1:00:24] Jesus done
[1:00:26] then everybody would be
[1:00:28] saved but see up there there is a love
[1:00:32] relationship because the only way you
[1:00:34] can get there is through love you have
[1:00:37] to love God more than yourself or you're
[1:00:39] not going amen that's just all because
[1:00:42] you got to deny yourself you got to pick
[1:00:45] up your cross you got to follow him so
[1:00:47] up in heaven there's going to be a bunch
[1:00:49] of people who have a love relationship
[1:00:51] with
[1:00:53] God they they care about
[1:00:56] they care about God they care about his
[1:01:00] word they care about his will and and
[1:01:04] that's what's going to be filled in
[1:01:06] heaven is as people who care about God
[1:01:10] more than they care about
[1:01:15] themselves God is
[1:01:19] always wanted to be with someone who
[1:01:22] unconditionally loves them
[1:01:27] see there's a lot of people say you know
[1:01:31] I love God I mean I love John 3:16 I I
[1:01:35] love that he supplies I love that he's a
[1:01:37] comforter I love that he heals me I
[1:01:40] love but what about I love to obey
[1:01:45] him I love to trust him in my trials
[1:01:49] amen I love to hold to God's unchanging
[1:01:52] hand what about that love God is always
[1:01:56] wanted to have a relationship with
[1:01:59] someone who would love him
[1:02:01] unconditionally who loves his word and
[1:02:04] just respects the word and respects his
[1:02:06] will that's what God wants to be back
[1:02:09] and the Holy Spirit God sent back the
[1:02:11] Holy Spirit to lead us to that
[1:02:16] place that place of
[1:02:19] relationship Bible says we've been
[1:02:21] predestinated to be in the image of
[1:02:24] God so I want to say this believers who
[1:02:28] never fall in love with the Bible never
[1:02:32] become established with God I know it's
[1:02:37] a strong statement but I'll just I'll
[1:02:39] back it up in 2 Chronicles 20:20 believe
[1:02:42] on the Lord so shall you be
[1:02:44] established you've got the you've got to
[1:02:46] fall in love with the word because see
[1:02:49] the look The Devil is not trying to get
[1:02:53] you where you're strong at
[1:02:56] he's coming at your
[1:02:58] weaknesses he's he's trying to trip you
[1:03:01] up if you're faithful coming to church
[1:03:05] well then he's going to try to get you
[1:03:06] somewhere else maybe you're flying off
[1:03:08] the handle when you get upset you
[1:03:11] understand he's going to try to zap the
[1:03:13] victory right out of you but he's going
[1:03:15] to he's going to he's going to come
[1:03:16] after your
[1:03:18] weaknesses so we must become one with
[1:03:21] the word the the word needs to become
[1:03:23] the headship of our life we need to love
[1:03:25] the Bible amen love the Bible I'm okay I
[1:03:28] like that there a good ring to that I
[1:03:30] love the
[1:03:32] Bible I love the word of
[1:03:35] God the holy spirit is the Living Word
[1:03:38] of
[1:03:40] God there's no difference there's no
[1:03:42] difference between the Holy Spirit and
[1:03:44] the Bible one is written form the other
[1:03:47] is manifested it's invisible but when it
[1:03:50] comes and lives inside you it manifests
[1:03:52] it isn't that beautiful amen I just love
[1:03:56] that turn with me if you would to St
[1:03:57] John 13 I want to try to get into this
[1:04:00] love relationship here a little bit and
[1:04:02] show you so uh in St John 13 Jesus is
[1:04:06] telling his disciples that he's he's
[1:04:08] leaving it's time for me to leave and
[1:04:11] and they're getting sad and and in verse
[1:04:13] 33 he says little children yet a little
[1:04:15] while I'm with you you shall seek me and
[1:04:18] and as I said unto the Jews whether I go
[1:04:20] you cannot come so now I'm saying it
[1:04:22] personally to you so I'm leaving now
[1:04:25] this thing I want you to do while I'm
[1:04:26] gone a new commandment I give you that
[1:04:28] that you love one another as I have
[1:04:30] loved you that you Lo uh I'm sorry that
[1:04:33] you love one another as I have loved you
[1:04:35] that ye also love one another so you got
[1:04:40] to keep this love going while away and
[1:04:42] and by this shall all men that you know
[1:04:44] will know that you're my disciples that
[1:04:47] if you have love one for another so if
[1:04:50] you want somebody to know you belong to
[1:04:52] Christ you have to learn to love them
[1:04:54] unconditionally amen amen this all there
[1:04:57] is to it
[1:04:59] unconditionally anybody has
[1:05:02] favorites anybody say I love them
[1:05:05] because they love
[1:05:06] me but we're really looking for the
[1:05:09] person who loves
[1:05:11] everybody those that have something
[1:05:13] against them because that's the one that
[1:05:17] God you'll see the manifestation of God
[1:05:20] the most in amen it is because the
[1:05:22] hardest thing is to love your enemy I
[1:05:25] don't just well you know I I love them
[1:05:29] but you know I just I can't I don't I
[1:05:30] don't feel like talking with them you I
[1:05:32] just feel uncomfortable no true love of
[1:05:34] God is you want to help that person you
[1:05:36] want Lord if I could just get with them
[1:05:38] I know I can make a difference in their
[1:05:40] life it's a faith now I'm not saying
[1:05:42] you're prophesying that you will but
[1:05:44] it's a faith that you
[1:05:46] have love Faith That
[1:05:49] worketh by love I think the scripture
[1:05:51] says all right let's continue reading
[1:05:53] here uh verse 36 Simon Peter said unto
[1:05:56] himl where are you
[1:05:58] going where goest thou and Jesus
[1:06:01] answered where I go thou cannot follow
[1:06:04] me now but Thou shalt follow me
[1:06:06] afterwards and Peter said unto him Lord
[1:06:09] why can't I follow you right
[1:06:11] now I am ready to lay down my life for
[1:06:14] your sake and Jesus answered him will
[1:06:16] thou lay down thy life for my sake
[1:06:19] verily I say unto you uh unto thee the
[1:06:23] the shall not crawl till thou has
[1:06:26] denied me three
[1:06:29] times so here's here's someone and we
[1:06:33] have all probably felt that you know we
[1:06:34] won't deny the Lord
[1:06:36] right but I tell
[1:06:39] you the only thing that will not deny
[1:06:42] God is God
[1:06:44] right that's why we need to get filled
[1:06:46] with God because then we won't deny him
[1:06:50] but we're
[1:06:51] flesh eventually we're going to cross
[1:06:54] the word are you with me amen all right
[1:06:57] verse one chapter 14 let not your heart
[1:06:59] be
[1:07:00] troubled you believe in God then believe
[1:07:03] also on me Jesus said in my father's
[1:07:08] Kingdom House my father's kingdom are
[1:07:11] many residents many mansions if it were
[1:07:14] not so I would have told you so I go to
[1:07:19] prepare a place for you and if I go to
[1:07:22] prepare a place for you I will come
[1:07:23] again and receive you unto myself
[1:07:26] that where I am there you may be
[1:07:29] also so this place that Jesus is talking
[1:07:33] about is is is not what we would
[1:07:35] think like just a place like like like
[1:07:40] our church is a place that's in Fenton
[1:07:42] it's not like
[1:07:44] that that's
[1:07:46] right alone it's not like that alone but
[1:07:50] rather it's a place of a relationship
[1:07:53] amen not a GE graphic place but the
[1:07:57] place that he's talking about that he's
[1:07:58] going to prepare it's it's it's it's a
[1:08:02] relationship one of love one of his
[1:08:06] character it's the Bible Jesus said it's
[1:08:09] a place where Christ receives
[1:08:13] you it's a place where you and Christ
[1:08:16] are now together so see it's not a
[1:08:19] geographic place it's a place of
[1:08:21] relationship he's talking about I'll say
[1:08:24] that this place is is what we would call
[1:08:26] the spiritual Promised Land that's right
[1:08:29] now there's no it's no different than
[1:08:31] the natural Promised Land given to the
[1:08:33] children of Israel I'll just say it like
[1:08:36] this God had given the land but it
[1:08:38] wasn't prepared for dwelling yet right
[1:08:42] it was filled with giants you just
[1:08:44] couldn't go there put your lawn chair
[1:08:46] out and live in some peace and in the
[1:08:50] comfort it had to be prepared before you
[1:08:53] got the lawn chairs out amen and it is
[1:08:56] no different for the
[1:08:59] Christian when we come into this world
[1:09:02] we are not fit for God's holy spirit we
[1:09:05] were aliens with God we were separated
[1:09:07] from God our nature didn't even care
[1:09:10] about God to be
[1:09:12] honest we were born in sin shap and in
[1:09:16] iniquity and the land is not prepared
[1:09:20] that the nature of our of our our being
[1:09:23] is not prepared for God so he's he has
[1:09:26] to prepare that place amen now just as
[1:09:30] the the children of Israel had to have
[1:09:32] faith that God gave him the land and
[1:09:34] just trust him keep walking keep moving
[1:09:37] forward God did the work if you
[1:09:40] noticed right because you know they
[1:09:43] couldn't beat the Giants on their own
[1:09:45] sir they were like
[1:09:47] grasshoppers but they believed in the
[1:09:49] God that was greater than their
[1:09:50] obstacles and we've got to believe in a
[1:09:52] God that's greater than our nature that
[1:09:55] we are truly Overcomers that we can be
[1:09:57] like Jesus Christ we can have a
[1:09:59] relationship in this evil hour that
[1:10:01] we're living in so close to God that we
[1:10:03] can make a Rapture amen I believe it
[1:10:06] with all my
[1:10:09] heart this is the place that Christ is
[1:10:11] going to prepare in each one of us he's
[1:10:15] working inside of us with the Holy
[1:10:17] Spirit the Bible tells us that we are
[1:10:20] God's workmanship created in Christ
[1:10:22] Jesus for it is God which worketh in US
[1:10:25] to both will and to do of his good
[1:10:28] pleasure so he's given us Faith to
[1:10:31] overcome we just got to learn to trust
[1:10:33] we got to learn to obey we got to learn
[1:10:34] to like if I could say it like do all
[1:10:36] things without murmuring and complaining
[1:10:38] don't Grumble just do what the Bible
[1:10:39] says love the word don't just well I
[1:10:41] don't feel like do it I ain't got time
[1:10:43] and you know this you know I'll just
[1:10:44] this is on a back burning don't do that
[1:10:46] that's what you're saying about your
[1:10:47] relationship with Jesus Christ but you
[1:10:50] don't realize it see the devil is trying
[1:10:52] to get you to say trying to get you to
[1:10:54] think that your relationship is solid
[1:10:57] with him no matter what you do no matter
[1:11:00] what choices you make out there no
[1:11:03] matter how you you live how much time
[1:11:05] you give him no matter where your heart
[1:11:07] is at everything's okay between you and
[1:11:09] God is that the
[1:11:11] truth so we need to be cautious we need
[1:11:15] to be aware of these Spirits amen let's
[1:11:18] continue reading here and Jesus said
[1:11:21] whether I go you know
[1:11:23] not St John 14
[1:11:26] ver4 and the way uh and where I go you
[1:11:29] know I'm sorry and whether I go you know
[1:11:31] if I just read the word I would not make
[1:11:33] any mistakes you know I just need to
[1:11:34] become a better
[1:11:37] reader and Thomas saith unto him
[1:11:40] Lord just like just like Peter we
[1:11:44] really we don't know where you're
[1:11:47] going and how can we know the way if we
[1:11:50] don't know where you're going and Jesus
[1:11:53] said unto him I I am the
[1:11:56] way I am the truth and I am the life and
[1:12:00] no man cometh to the father but by me
[1:12:03] amen Jesus is the way to heaven he is
[1:12:07] the way to the father and if I could say
[1:12:08] it like this he is the way to the
[1:12:14] spirit we know God is a spirit that's
[1:12:17] what the Bible says God is a spirit they
[1:12:19] that worship me must worship me in
[1:12:21] spirit and in truth amen and Jesus said
[1:12:24] I came from the father and I go back to
[1:12:27] the father I came from the locus the
[1:12:30] spirit and I'm going back there am now
[1:12:33] he says it's expedient if I go away if I
[1:12:35] do not go away the comforter will not
[1:12:37] come why is that because the fullness of
[1:12:41] the godhead bodily dwelt in Jesus Christ
[1:12:44] the fullness of God's spirit amen God
[1:12:48] great is the mystery of Godly is God was
[1:12:50] manifested in the flesh it was God in
[1:12:53] Jesus Christ
[1:12:56] God's desire is to inhabit our bodies
[1:13:00] just like he did Jesus Christ the body
[1:13:03] of Jesus
[1:13:04] Christ amen and I'll tell you Jesus Paid
[1:13:08] the price for our sins and he made an
[1:13:11] opportunity for for each of us to
[1:13:14] receive as much of the Holy Ghost as we
[1:13:20] want I want to say it like that you want
[1:13:24] more there's more for you you if there's
[1:13:26] a deep calling there's a deep to the
[1:13:28] respond if you're satisfied with what
[1:13:30] you have that's it I that's it that's
[1:13:33] all you're going to
[1:13:35] get but God is interested in filling
[1:13:38] your filling you up from the bottom of
[1:13:40] your feet to the top of your head from
[1:13:42] one end to the other front and
[1:13:44] back why because he just wants to
[1:13:47] manifest himself in you he loves you and
[1:13:50] he wants Your Vessel it's a love
[1:13:53] relationship
[1:13:55] Jesus encompasses all life all truth and
[1:13:58] he is the only way to get there he said
[1:14:00] I am the bread of life that come down
[1:14:02] from heaven and unless you eat it you
[1:14:05] have no life in you right he said the
[1:14:08] words that I speak unto you they are
[1:14:10] spirit and they are life Jesus is the
[1:14:13] truth he is the word of God he is the
[1:14:15] Bible and we're going to catch in a
[1:14:17] minute Jesus said the Holy Ghost was the
[1:14:21] spirit of
[1:14:22] Truth well we just read Jesus said he
[1:14:25] said I am the
[1:14:26] truth and then the Bible ALS Jesus also
[1:14:29] said this that that the Holy Ghost was
[1:14:32] the spirit of Truth so which one is it
[1:14:34] it's the
[1:14:35] same it's the same they're
[1:14:38] one that's when you receive the Holy
[1:14:40] Ghost you receive God you got deity in
[1:14:43] you amen that's why you can say to this
[1:14:45] mountain be moved that's why you can
[1:14:47] cast out
[1:14:48] demons why you can have power over your
[1:14:51] nature because God is inside you the
[1:14:53] Creator amen
[1:14:55] verse seven if he had known
[1:14:59] me you should have known my father also
[1:15:03] and henceforth you know him and have
[1:15:05] seen him and Phillip not quite being in
[1:15:08] the spirit I I would be too
[1:15:12] right at that point without the Holy
[1:15:15] Ghost Philip saith unto him show us the
[1:15:17] father and it suffices and Jesus sayith
[1:15:20] on him have I been so long with you and
[1:15:22] you have not known me
[1:15:23] Phillip come on I want to answer we've
[1:15:27] been spending time you've been coming to
[1:15:28] church you've been hearing the word
[1:15:29] you've been in the message you don't
[1:15:31] know yet what this
[1:15:34] means he that have seen me have seen the
[1:15:37] father and how sayest thou then show us
[1:15:39] the father believest thou not that I am
[1:15:43] in the father and the father in me the
[1:15:46] words that I speak unto you I speak not
[1:15:49] of myself but the father that dwelleth
[1:15:51] in me he's the one that's doing the
[1:15:52] works believe me that I am in the father
[1:15:56] and the father in me or else believe me
[1:15:58] for the very work sake verily I say to
[1:16:01] you how is a Believer how many believes
[1:16:02] in Jesus Christ amen all right this
[1:16:04] verse is for you verily I saying to you
[1:16:06] he that believeth on me then the works
[1:16:09] that I do shall you do also right can't
[1:16:13] get away from it and Greater Works than
[1:16:17] these shall you do because I go to my
[1:16:18] father that's the bride's ministry right
[1:16:20] there Greater Works more of them more of
[1:16:23] them are you with me okay verse 13 and
[1:16:26] whatsoever you shall ask now this is
[1:16:28] prayer we're talking about prayer this
[1:16:30] is the power of prayer whatsoever you
[1:16:31] ask in my name that will I do that the
[1:16:36] father may be glorified in the son but
[1:16:38] you got to believe it now right you just
[1:16:40] can't say it oh some sort of wish list
[1:16:43] you've got to believe
[1:16:46] it if you ask anything in my name I will
[1:16:49] do it right and if you love me then keep
[1:16:53] my Commandments is it it's almost like
[1:16:55] it's you know two different
[1:16:58] subjects but you know what he's doing
[1:17:00] he's trying to tell you this is a
[1:17:02] relationship it goes both ways it isn't
[1:17:05] just about what you want from me just
[1:17:06] use my name or whatever you want he says
[1:17:09] but look if you truly love me you want
[1:17:11] me to do that then you need to do the
[1:17:12] things I'm asking you to do too see he's
[1:17:15] teaching us a relationship amen and if
[1:17:19] and I will pray the father see now
[1:17:22] here's Jesus praying he's telling us to
[1:17:25] pray and now Jesus is praying for us and
[1:17:27] I will pray the father and he will give
[1:17:30] you and he shall give you a
[1:17:33] another
[1:17:35] comforter now notice this that he may
[1:17:39] abide with you for
[1:17:42] ever how many people could stand today
[1:17:47] Pro you know pretty much all over the
[1:17:49] world stand and testify not everybody in
[1:17:52] the world but so many people in the
[1:17:53] world the churches could stand and say
[1:17:56] yes God uh God blessed me one time it
[1:18:01] was so great I couldn't even think
[1:18:02] straight I was on cloud n for so many
[1:18:05] days and I just wanted to lay down my
[1:18:07] life and and and do everything I could
[1:18:09] to be a a good Christian and and for
[1:18:13] some reason I don't feel that way
[1:18:17] anymore now that is not the
[1:18:19] promise right the promise that Jesus is
[1:18:23] talking about is shall abide with you
[1:18:31] forever so either the devil is
[1:18:35] lying to you and telling you you don't
[1:18:37] have it and you're saying yeah I guess I
[1:18:39] don't so I'm also not or you need to get
[1:18:44] more because we're talking about the
[1:18:47] promise of having God With Us forever
[1:18:50] right amen now this is a guide
[1:18:55] the Holy Ghost is going to guide us to a
[1:18:57] proper relationship the reason that God
[1:19:00] is sending the
[1:19:02] comforter is to bring us into proper
[1:19:05] relationship with him because you notice
[1:19:07] the disciples Walk With Jesus for three
[1:19:10] what three years three and a half years
[1:19:11] something like that and look they had
[1:19:14] power they cast out demons they he all
[1:19:16] matter of diseases they saw Miracles
[1:19:19] they saw people raised from the dead
[1:19:21] they were in glorious meetings they saw
[1:19:23] fish multiply and BR multiply they seen
[1:19:26] it all they were they walked with a man
[1:19:29] amen chosen they were chosen of the
[1:19:33] man but they were
[1:19:36] missing a relationship
[1:19:40] inside they had a carnal relationship oh
[1:19:43] you know what I'm never leaving the
[1:19:45] church you know what I'm just GNA I'll
[1:19:49] be willing to die for
[1:19:51] you see they were staring at the outside
[1:19:55] they were thinking about knowing Christ
[1:19:57] from the outside that's why they were
[1:20:00] they were they were sad that he was
[1:20:02] leaving and Jesus is saying look it's
[1:20:05] going to be better than ever because I'm
[1:20:07] going to come and live inside you now
[1:20:09] amen
[1:20:11] right all right so even the spirit of
[1:20:16] Truth the comforter now it's called the
[1:20:19] spirit of Truth whom the world it cannot
[1:20:23] receive
[1:20:26] because it seeth him not neither does he
[1:20:28] neither knoweth him so the world don't
[1:20:31] know
[1:20:33] God but you know him praise God you know
[1:20:37] him for he dwelleth with
[1:20:41] you and shall be in
[1:20:43] you so now he's talking to his disciples
[1:20:46] and he's saying you know what I just
[1:20:47] want to make this real clear you do not
[1:20:49] have the Holy
[1:20:51] Ghost he's dwelling with you and and
[1:20:55] shall be his future and shall be in you
[1:20:58] right so when people come to Christ now
[1:21:01] they come and they give their heart at
[1:21:02] the altar and they get baptized it does
[1:21:05] not mean they have received the Holy
[1:21:10] Ghost but I'll tell you though they got
[1:21:12] enough Holy Ghost to lead them to the
[1:21:15] relationship that God is
[1:21:19] requiring he said I will not leave you
[1:21:23] comfortless
[1:21:25] but I will come to you this same Jesus
[1:21:28] that's talking said I'm coming back to
[1:21:30] you but it won't be in the form of a
[1:21:32] physical body it's going to be in the
[1:21:34] form of the spirit what's inside this
[1:21:39] body why now think about it why is he
[1:21:42] saying I won't leave you
[1:21:44] comfortless why because look as the
[1:21:47] children of Israel were facing these
[1:21:49] Giants they knew they needed help but
[1:21:52] there was only two with another spirit
[1:21:55] that said we're more than able right I
[1:21:57] don't want to try to live a Christian
[1:21:59] Life and try to to to have the character
[1:22:01] of God without the Hol without the
[1:22:03] comfort of the Holy Ghost I need someone
[1:22:06] to take
[1:22:07] charge I need someone who's who's who's
[1:22:10] willing to to take care of these giant
[1:22:13] in in my nature that I don't like amen
[1:22:17] and I need the comfort of the Holy Ghost
[1:22:19] and that's what the the the the the
[1:22:21] comforter is for is to bring us into a a
[1:22:25] prepared land to take care of the giant
[1:22:27] so the land can be prepared for a
[1:22:30] dwelling are you with me so faren all
[1:22:33] right verse 19 yet a little while and
[1:22:36] the world sees me no more but you see me
[1:22:39] because I live you shall live also and
[1:22:41] at that day you shall know that I am in
[1:22:44] the
[1:22:46] father is he talking about a literal day
[1:22:49] in the calendar or is he talking about a
[1:22:52] time at a time where Jesus Christ and
[1:22:55] you become one amen at that day you
[1:22:58] shall know that I am in the father and
[1:23:00] you in me and I in you now most people
[1:23:04] wouldn't think that Jesus would talk
[1:23:06] like that because it doesn't make
[1:23:10] sense how can you be in something and
[1:23:12] something be in
[1:23:15] you the way the only way to really
[1:23:18] really be in Christ is to be in the
[1:23:22] word in other words
[1:23:25] you're living the word you believe the
[1:23:26] word you live you eat you sleep you you
[1:23:30] feed on the word of God every day this
[1:23:32] has become you the word you make a
[1:23:36] choice on whether you're going to obey
[1:23:38] the word or not amen but the way to be
[1:23:41] in Christ is to be in the word and the
[1:23:43] way
[1:23:45] for Christ to be in you is to have the
[1:23:49] Living Word inside of you amen do you
[1:23:52] see how it works then it's so it's not a
[1:23:56] a day it's not a a place like in Fenton
[1:23:59] but it's a
[1:24:00] relationship it's a place of a
[1:24:02] relationship I go to prepare a place for
[1:24:05] you so it's Christ in us taking
[1:24:09] over it's a meeting place and he that
[1:24:12] and I'm going to show you in these
[1:24:13] following verses he defines what he says
[1:24:15] in verse 20 here he that have my
[1:24:18] Commandments and keeps them he it is
[1:24:21] that loveth me we're talking about a
[1:24:23] relationship right now
[1:24:25] and he that loveth me shall be loved to
[1:24:27] my
[1:24:28] father and I will love him and will
[1:24:32] manifest myself to
[1:24:39] him I love this
[1:24:41] place I love this place right here this
[1:24:44] is the place I want to be I want to be
[1:24:46] in a place where I love God enough to
[1:24:49] keep his
[1:24:51] word and that God loves me enough to
[1:24:53] manifest the word in me and then it
[1:24:56] don't matter what fire I'm in it don't
[1:24:58] matter who's yelling at me it don't
[1:25:00] matter if the if if explosions happen
[1:25:02] everywhere it just doesn't matter
[1:25:04] because Christ is in me the hope of
[1:25:08] glory if I have him I have everything
[1:25:14] amen Judas saith unto him not as scary
[1:25:18] Lord how is it thou will manifest
[1:25:19] thyself unto us but not unto the world
[1:25:22] and Judas Jesus said Jesus answered and
[1:25:25] said unto him if a man love me he goes
[1:25:27] right back to what he said if a man
[1:25:29] loves me he will keep my words how many
[1:25:33] times has he said that in these verses
[1:25:35] and my father he's going to love him
[1:25:37] something special is going to happen The
[1:25:39] Father loves everybody but something
[1:25:41] special is going to happen if we love
[1:25:43] God Amen and he says we will come unto
[1:25:46] him and make our bold with him do you
[1:25:48] know Jesus will not come into somebody
[1:25:50] who really don't want him
[1:25:52] there I mean his desire is to live in
[1:25:56] everybody but he will not he will not
[1:25:58] cross some free more agency so I'll just
[1:26:00] say it like this there's enough Holy
[1:26:02] Ghost for whatever you
[1:26:04] want you just got to be willing to want
[1:26:07] it more than you don't want ites that
[1:26:10] make sense he that loveth me not keepeth
[1:26:13] not my sayings and the word which he
[1:26:15] which ye hear is not of mine but the
[1:26:18] fathers would sent me these things have
[1:26:20] I spoken unto you but yet uh uh uh being
[1:26:25] yet present with you but the comforter
[1:26:27] I'm going to end with this here but the
[1:26:28] comforter I'm not going to end the
[1:26:30] service with this I'm just going to end
[1:26:31] this reading with this one but the
[1:26:34] comforter which is the Holy Ghost whom
[1:26:35] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:26:38] teach you all things and bring all
[1:26:40] things to your Rance whatsoever I said
[1:26:42] unto you now what is he going to teach
[1:26:47] us what's he going to bring to our
[1:26:51] remembrance the kind of character that
[1:26:53] we need to have have Amen to to turn the
[1:26:56] cheek to go the Second Mile Amen to to
[1:26:59] to love like he loves am to to live for
[1:27:04] others to be like he is now I'm just
[1:27:07] saying you brother Brandon just made it
[1:27:10] so
[1:27:11] clear he said if the spirit of Beethoven
[1:27:15] lived in
[1:27:17] me then I would play the music that
[1:27:20] Beethoven
[1:27:22] played if the spirit of r B lived in me
[1:27:26] then I would paint pictures just like
[1:27:29] rant did and if the spirit of Jesus
[1:27:32] Christ lives in me I won't be able but
[1:27:35] to help do the same works that Jesus
[1:27:39] did amen so let's our Focus now to
[1:27:44] understand this we all got some Holy
[1:27:48] Ghost right amen praise the Lord praise
[1:27:52] God for the Holy Ghost we got amen
[1:27:54] amen but don't you want
[1:27:58] more see if you want more there's
[1:28:02] more but you got to go after it amen
[1:28:05] what what what more do you got to do
[1:28:08] well Lord what would you have me to do
[1:28:12] today what would you have me to obey
[1:28:15] today lay on my heart what you want me
[1:28:18] to do because the key to getting into
[1:28:22] this place that he's going to prepare is
[1:28:24] that we have to love love the word we
[1:28:27] have to obey the
[1:28:28] Commandment so it you you you can't wait
[1:28:31] for the preacher to be said you need to
[1:28:33] do this and you need to do that and you
[1:28:34] need to stop doing it it don't work like
[1:28:36] that it don't work like that it works by
[1:28:40] love Lord I just I want to be like
[1:28:43] you I want when people to see me under
[1:28:46] the fire I want them to see Christ come
[1:28:48] out I I want the Holy Ghost to Bubble
[1:28:51] over right I I don't want them to see me
[1:28:54] being all bothered upset and giving
[1:28:56] reasons why I'm flying off the
[1:29:00] handle now if you want that you'll spend
[1:29:03] time with the
[1:29:05] word and you'll ask God God what do you
[1:29:08] want me to do I believe if you pray that
[1:29:12] with your heart and you keep meaning it
[1:29:16] eventually he's going to show up and
[1:29:17] tell you what to
[1:29:19] do because he wants to give you a chance
[1:29:21] to prove your love the Bible says be not
[1:29:24] conformed to this world but be
[1:29:26] transformed by the renewing of your mind
[1:29:28] that you may prove what is that good and
[1:29:31] acceptable and perfect will of God God
[1:29:33] wants us to prove with our life to
[1:29:35] manifest with our
[1:29:37] lives offer our life to
[1:29:41] him all right St John chapter
[1:29:45] 16 16 now you know no matter how many
[1:29:50] notes I get I never get done so we're
[1:29:52] not going to be to finish
[1:29:54] everything
[1:29:58] but you just have to pray that it God
[1:30:02] just reveals it all to you it's my
[1:30:04] desire that you have it all amen St John
[1:30:07] chapter 16 verse number
[1:30:09] 7 nevertheless I tell you the truth is
[1:30:15] expedient for you that I go away for if
[1:30:18] I go not away the comforter will not
[1:30:20] come unto you but if I depart I will
[1:30:22] send them to you I'm going to send
[1:30:24] directly to you now here is the workings
[1:30:27] of the Holy Ghost right this is what we
[1:30:30] want to get into this is God working
[1:30:33] what's going to happen when you get the
[1:30:35] Holy Ghost and when he has come he's
[1:30:38] going to
[1:30:40] reprove the world the carnal the world
[1:30:44] part of your
[1:30:45] nature he's going to reprove it he's
[1:30:47] going to convict he's going to rebuke it
[1:30:49] he's going to he's going to show its
[1:30:51] faults of sin
[1:30:54] and he's going to show the real
[1:30:56] righteousness and you're going to bring
[1:31:00] judgment you're going to be the one that
[1:31:02] says I don't want this in my life and I
[1:31:05] I I resist you Satan I submit myself
[1:31:08] therefore to God I resist the devil and
[1:31:11] he will flee from me this is the
[1:31:13] workings of the Holy Ghost in Simplicity
[1:31:16] in a man's
[1:31:18] life of sin because they believe not on
[1:31:21] me of righteousness because I go to the
[1:31:23] father and you see me no more of
[1:31:25] judgment because the prince of this
[1:31:27] world is judged now here's the thing you
[1:31:30] know we can get all bent out of shape of
[1:31:32] all the bad stuff that's happening in
[1:31:33] the world and there's a lot of it and it
[1:31:35] just seems to keep escalating like the
[1:31:37] lids off of hell we know that and things
[1:31:39] are just getting worse out there we're
[1:31:42] still looking for some little bit of
[1:31:43] Hope but you know what things are going
[1:31:46] down we cannot change the world I wish I
[1:31:50] could just stand up today don't want
[1:31:52] ever stand here this is where we just
[1:31:54] kneel before the
[1:31:56] Lord I wish I could just stand there and
[1:31:58] say I'm making a declaration there
[1:32:00] should be no more abortions we're
[1:32:03] getting rid of all the clinics we're
[1:32:05] breaking all the laws I wish I could say
[1:32:07] that and it would be
[1:32:08] over but you can't change the
[1:32:12] world but you know what you can
[1:32:15] do you can judge the world that's inside
[1:32:17] of
[1:32:20] you you can take a stand against that
[1:32:23] nature
[1:32:24] that's been there and you're you haven't
[1:32:26] overcome yet
[1:32:28] yet and you know
[1:32:30] what why do you want to murmur and
[1:32:33] complain and get all bent out of shape
[1:32:35] out there when you're letting sin rain
[1:32:38] right here come
[1:32:40] on I mean the Holy Ghost is for you if
[1:32:43] the world don't want it that's fine but
[1:32:45] the Holy Ghost is for you but you got to
[1:32:47] be you got to get real with it
[1:32:50] amen verse 12 says I Jesus said I have
[1:32:53] yet many things to say unto
[1:32:57] you but you can't handle it you can't
[1:33:01] handle it you ever come to church hear
[1:33:03] the word being preached and he said
[1:33:05] can't wait to get out of
[1:33:07] there or maybe you know what he said
[1:33:10] that right at me he was thinking about
[1:33:12] me when he said I I I locked him with
[1:33:14] his eyes he was looking right at me
[1:33:16] brother
[1:33:18] bman you know that's the way the devil
[1:33:21] does it you
[1:33:22] know but you know what
[1:33:24] God has confidence that we can live the
[1:33:27] whole word that we can be
[1:33:30] Overcomers that we can be just like him
[1:33:32] because we've been predestinated to it
[1:33:35] it has to
[1:33:37] happen how be it when he the spirit of
[1:33:39] Truth is come he will guide you into all
[1:33:45] truth all of
[1:33:47] it he's not satisfied job said I'll not
[1:33:50] be satisfied till I awake in his
[1:33:52] likeness I want to awake in his likeness
[1:33:56] I want to be like
[1:33:58] him I've seen myself so much I don't
[1:34:02] like
[1:34:03] myself I
[1:34:06] don't but I like Jesus in me I like that
[1:34:11] part for he shall not speak of himself
[1:34:15] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:34:17] he speak and it shall show you things to
[1:34:20] come so the spirit of air
[1:34:24] is going to speak about
[1:34:28] himself the spirit of Heir wants you to
[1:34:32] get what your flesh
[1:34:35] wants but Jesus had to come to a place
[1:34:39] where he denied
[1:34:41] himself said not my will Lord thine be
[1:34:45] done so the father's will is the most
[1:34:50] important thing how what would you think
[1:34:52] if I told you that we we didn't we we
[1:34:57] just made it
[1:35:01] halfway really that's what you would say
[1:35:04] I'm glad I'm not asking lots of
[1:35:09] questions the holy spirit is never going
[1:35:12] to lead us away from the
[1:35:14] truth the holy spirit is never going to
[1:35:16] lead us away from
[1:35:18] church come on I want to hear I want to
[1:35:20] hear the whole church say Amen to that
[1:35:23] the the Holy Spirit would never lead us
[1:35:26] to compromise with the word to separate
[1:35:28] from the body of Christ or to make our
[1:35:31] personal lives more important than our
[1:35:34] relationship with Jesus Christ amen so
[1:35:37] church is
[1:35:39] important very important brother brand
[1:35:42] said in the me in the message questions
[1:35:43] and answers he said someone said to me
[1:35:45] not long ago said why brother brandom uh
[1:35:48] why why uh we don't need anybody to
[1:35:50] teach
[1:35:51] us when the Holy Ghost comes we don't
[1:35:54] need anybody to teach us you know the
[1:35:56] scripture right okay the Bible says that
[1:35:59] you don't need need any
[1:36:01] teaching brother B said then why did the
[1:36:05] same Holy Spirit set in the church
[1:36:07] teachers see see set the church in order
[1:36:12] we've got to have teachers that's
[1:36:15] right but you ought not just to have
[1:36:18] anyone but now as far as the scripture
[1:36:20] or teaching it takes a Holy Ghost
[1:36:26] anointed that's it's brother brother
[1:36:28] Bruce that is that's exactly the word
[1:36:31] that brother BR said that's right as
[1:36:33] soon as you said that it's like you're
[1:36:34] reading my notes and God has set the
[1:36:37] church in order by Apostles prophets
[1:36:40] Gifts of healing Miracles and so forth
[1:36:42] he set the church in order and put the
[1:36:44] teachers and so forth in there to guide
[1:36:47] and to direct the church amen see
[1:36:52] different than the man-made denomination
[1:36:53] Nations who are just led by man God did
[1:36:56] put men in the church directed by the
[1:36:59] Holy Ghost to lead the church so we see
[1:37:01] the balance
[1:37:03] here we've got to come to
[1:37:06] church Braham said in the message the
[1:37:08] church and its conditions he said see
[1:37:10] the holy spirit is sent from God to take
[1:37:12] the word of God and to give it to us as
[1:37:15] we have need
[1:37:17] of so when you don't come to church you
[1:37:20] know what you're saying I don't need the
[1:37:22] word
[1:37:24] I don't need the word or or let's just
[1:37:28] try to say it real
[1:37:29] nicely I already have the
[1:37:35] word now look I'm only speaking to those
[1:37:39] who
[1:37:40] want a complete relationship with Jesus
[1:37:43] amen I'm not I'm not speaking to those
[1:37:46] who who only want it part way or think
[1:37:48] they can they've been tricked by the
[1:37:50] devil and think this is all we need to
[1:37:51] do and we're we're going to make it
[1:37:54] look I am not here to judge whether
[1:37:55] you're going to make it or not make
[1:37:59] it but I am telling you what it takes to
[1:38:02] be in a
[1:38:06] Rapture he's not rapturing immature
[1:38:12] Christians he's marrying a wife that's
[1:38:17] mature without spot without wrinkle and
[1:38:22] I'll say it like this
[1:38:27] it's going to take more than you just
[1:38:30] saying Jesus died for me and I I Believe
[1:38:33] In The
[1:38:34] Blood brother brandom said that blood
[1:38:37] has to be applied
[1:38:40] yes he said the light that was in that
[1:38:43] blood needs to come back onto the
[1:38:45] believer and he needs to manifest that
[1:38:49] word and when so in the Old Testament
[1:38:52] when I see the blood I'll pass over you
[1:38:54] in the New Testament when I see the
[1:38:57] life of that blood manifest in you I'll
[1:39:02] pass over
[1:39:03] you so look I I know this is strong I
[1:39:07] know this is hard but look I love you
[1:39:09] God loves you and God wants us to make
[1:39:12] it we've got to become more serious and
[1:39:15] don't be looking at churches while I can
[1:39:17] take it or leave it don't do
[1:39:19] that because in here God is trying to
[1:39:22] get you his word CU you need it amen
[1:39:25] let's Stand Together God bless you
[1:39:28] amen praise the
[1:39:32] Lord thank you for your your
[1:39:37] patience and I thank the Lord that
[1:39:43] he thank the Lord for his
[1:39:51] grace I I i' like
[1:39:55] to uh pray and if I could I'd like to
[1:39:59] read a prayer uh that uh brother brandom
[1:40:03] prayed it was in the message the
[1:40:05] impersonation of
[1:40:07] Christianity if you just want to maybe
[1:40:09] close your eyes for a second just think
[1:40:11] about these words as as he's praying
[1:40:13] them he says now in Christ Jesus name
[1:40:16] with heads bowed before God not
[1:40:19] me uh will you raise your hand and say
[1:40:23] God
[1:40:24] put your spirit in me this is my hand

[1:40:50] it now what about the hour when the
[1:40:52] heart is refusing to beat how about that
[1:40:54] hour that they feel the cold Vapors of
[1:40:57] death floating in how much more are they
[1:40:59] going to recognize in them what are
[1:41:02] we whence did we come from and where are
[1:41:05] we going and
[1:41:08] father we are tired of impersonations of
[1:41:11] Christian

[1:41:16] a new spirit and put your spirit
[1:41:19] according to your prophet's word in the
[1:41:22] middle of our new
[1:41:24] spirit and control us now catch this he
