children and your word has has has spoken and made it clear where just two or three are gathered together in your name you will be there in the midst and father we know that you're here for a reason father you have a purpose to fulfill and Lord we've come also to the house of God with un needs and requests and and desires to draw closer and to hear from you and we just pray Lord that You' remove all the the the the the demons all the doubts and anything that would uh stop you from having preeminence in our our heart and our minds and in the ministry of the word and in the hearing hearing of your word today Father we commit the service into your hands pray now that you bless your word Lord as we look into it and we read it give us uh Revelation understanding and draw us closer to you we pray now in Jesus precious name amen amen amen well turn with me if you would to the book of St John I'm not saying that's my favorite book or anything St John chapter 3 three and we're going to start at verse number 14 now we did hear uh what I would consider a real good Christmas message from Brother Daryl and uh and we're thankful for that Christmas message but we want to have another Christmas message if we could we want to en title this opening the father's gift opening the father's gift starting here in St John 3 verse number 14- 21 and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son and whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life for God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved he that believeth on him should not is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already here's the reason because he have not believed in him believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds are evil for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deeds should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest and that they are wrought that they are wrought in God Amen God bless the reading of his word may you you may take your seats um we want to focus on St John 3:16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son now if it had not been for God given his son there would be no nature change there'd be no way for us to even get to heaven and when man fell in the garden his nature changed and every human that's been born since then has been born with a satanic nature and that nature is simply to do his own will and God would never allow a soul or the spirit of a man I'll say like this a soul to enter into heaven with a satanic nature and that's why Jesus said except a man be born again he cannot enter the kingdom of God Amen and the father's gift was his son provided it provided a way for us to get a nature change now this is an important statement we all know it we all understand it but we must be looking for that nature change and not just a little and and the more that we can have an expectation like job I would not be satisfied until I awaken his likess until I see him manifested in my thoughts my mind my life that he's taking control I won't be satisfied and the problem is too many people get satisfied God did it all God only went to Calvary and they missed opening the gift that God has given them now God told the most subtile spiritual Beast that old serpent called the devil now remember there was a most subtle Beast that was between man and and he was the highest form of the animal race he was the closest to man he could talk he could walk and he was called the most subtle beast but there was a more subtile spiritual Beast that lived in him that used his body and he was the one that got this most uh subt Beast to interact and have a relationship that was not of his race can you say amen and God told that most subtle Beast that old serpent called the devil and Satan that the seed of the woman was going to bruise his head one day right amen and that this spirit spiritual Beast was going to prove that God was wrong and and when uh Cain was born he actually bruised the Hat of Abel and gashed it in and killed him he was going to prove that God was wrong but that was not the seed that God was speaking of he was speaking of a spiritual seed that was going to come down a and we read about it uh here in in in in John 3: 16 that that God gave his son um to to take away the the bruise the the the bruised head of sat was there was no way that a man uh could now be under the chains of a selfish satanic nature amen that was the bruise that God provided away that man could now be under the nature of the Holy Ghost now it's not just something you profess it is something that is lived out amen that the spirit of God is so real it lives in humans today amen I want to say this how did God bruise the head of Satan all right by giving himself I taken our place amen that's how he did it like Abraham said in Genesis 2218 God will provide himself a lamb for a burnt offering it was because of his great love wherewith he loved us it was his Divine love that bruised the head of Satan amen now how do we bruise Satan's said by manifesting that same love yes if if we don't deny ourself it's just going to be our love that we try to put out there and the only thing that's going to do is cause trouble right so I you the way to really get the devil out is to let the love of God in manifested Divine love is always the answer to victory in every situation Bible not the Bible but brother brandom said in the we got a lot of scriptures today we're only going to put a few up but we're going to be going through a lot the message the true Easter seal brother Braham said speaking of the prophecy that came to him God said this in itself is that which will give and make come to pass the tremendous victory in love divine now what is it that he was talking about he was talking about making the choice to go God's harder way it was that choice to go God's harder way that was going to bring to pass that tremendous victory in Divine Love Now what is the harder way it's the giving of yourself amen it's living for others that that that's what brother brandham taught us what the Holy Ghost was was living for others it takes the Divine love of God to give ourselves and to live for others we can't do it ourselves so it's a choice that every one of us make individually we don't make it as a family look at the people in your family those that made the choice and those that didn't it's an individual choice but when you make the choice it will make come to pass that tremendous Victory is giving yourself for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son right did you know the Son of God was born to die he was was born to die it it was that one act of divine love that one act of unselfish giving that brought a tremendous Victory to save the whole world Isaiah 9:6 I just you all know this you don't turn therefore unto us a child is born a son is given and the government shall be upon his shoulder and his name Shall be Called wonderful counselor the Mighty God the Everlasting father and the Prince of Peace amen God the word became flesh and dwelt Among Us amen Isaiah also says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son his name Shall be Called Emmanuel which is God With Us right that was God giving his son we all know these scriptures we've read them many times in our Christmas message in Luke Chapter 2 and the Angels said unto them fear not for behold I bring you good tidings of great joy which shall be to all people for unto you is Born This Day in the city of David a savior which is Christ the lord and suddenly there was with the angel a multitude of heavenly losts praising God and saying glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace Good Will toward all men now notice this is the motive that God had for sending his son was to save the world to help the world to to bring Good Tidings to to all men amen but all men didn't want it did they because they loved their own will above God's right they love Darkness rather than walking in the light of God for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son but he was born to die when Jesus stood before Pilate he said in John 18:37 to this end was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness of the truth and everyone that is of Truth hears my voice and the truth is is that God loves God God loves so much that he gave himself provided a way for the spirit of God to come back and live inside of us and the question to every human being after God does this act is do we love him enough to let his nature come and live inside of us because it's a choice it's a choice now you you go to the bank you get money you go in a car wash you get a car wash you go to the restaurant you get food you you come to the church you hear the word of God but it takes a lot more to get the Holy Ghost inside of you than just coming to church because you're dealing with a heart a free moreal agency and the word of God is a discerner of every heart it knows how bad you want him amen we know God wants to give us the Holy Ghost more than we can kind of comprehend it we feel like we're waiting on God when's God going to bless us when God's going to do this God wants to give it more than we want it we're not wanting it enough and God knows and we've got to trust him that if he hasn't given us what we're looking for right now that means we need to seek more of him we need to give more of oursel we need to die out more to ourselves Jesus speaking of his death in John 1223 said the hour has come the son of man should be glorified verily I verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit and he that loveth his life is going to lose it but he that hateth his life in this world it's got to be in this world shall keep it unto life eternal amen the Son of God was born to die that he might become the firstborn of many Brethren amen Jesus said in Matthew 20:28 even as the son of man came not to minister to be ministered unto but to minister and to give his life a ransom for many he says Greater Love have no man this than a man lay down his life for his friends so we see these scriptures are all pointing to God giving his life amen John said for this purpose the Son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil amen you can believe the word of God from cover to cover you can believe brother that God sent a prophet and his name was William brandom and he brought the truth of the hour you can come to church Faithfully every day that we have church but your nature never changes it doesn't matter it doesn't matter the nature that we have has to be changed that is not going to happen with just saying I agree you agree all day you want you've got to get to the place where you're sick of yourself you die out to yourself you say I don't want to act like this anymore I don't want to be like like this anymore I want God's love flowing through my life amen you've got to get real with the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost in you is going to act the same way it did in Jesus and the same way it did in the apostles it don't act different today people are changing the world changing it's going crazy but God's word Remains the Same it will be the same inside of us no matter what happening in the world am some people have left Jesus in a manger yes yes it's true they'll pass presents around but it won't be because Jesus was born they'll put presents under a tree but they won't even think about the tree of Calvary right Jesus was born to die for our sins now hey some have taken him out of a Manger but they've left him on the cross just left him on the cross hanging he died for me yes Jesus died for me I accept I accept the sacrifice praise God and that's it the spirit that was on Jesus never came back upon them they have a mental belief that Jesus died for them but it stops right there they continue living doing what their own will it's that simple they continue living doing their own will they never die out so the spirit of Christ could come back and live in them because that's what it requires God doesn't love you enough remember this God does not love you enough to change your nature if you don't want it changed he's a gentleman he respects free more agency but when you come into agreement I agree with that word that my life there's no good in me and I need all of God inside of me that is when God will meet you he'll meet you right there but he he's not going to cross for you more agency just because you're his you still got to come the same way you got to die out to self have to no robots in heaven first Peter 2:24 who his own self bear our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness see notice he's not supposed to be left on a tree he died he rose again and his spirit is to come live back in US amen too many people have left Jesus on the cross just hanging there they've never opened up the father's gift of Love they just left it under the tree they need to open it up Romans 811 says but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal Body by the spirit that dwelleth in you am that's telling me that God can change me God can Quicken me God can take my bad habits and make good habits God can take my bad thinking and make good thinking God can take my love and make it and make his love instead of my love amen because it's his Spirit that's living in me too often we try to put peacock feathers in us you know I'm going to act like a Christian I'm going to do this the Bible says this and we're missing the spirit of God therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh for if we live after the flesh you shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify kill the Deeds of the body you shall live you have a job to do God is not going to Crucify My Flesh he's not going to do it that's the that's our job if you love your flesh you love your flesh you hate your flesh he'll give you your spirit and the thing is our flesh stinks it stinks it's up to us to let it stink so bad that we just let it rot you know here's the thing either you hate it and take care of it or everybody else has to deal with it God gift to us was himself in spirit form it's important in spirit form not the events that God made happen the birth of Jesus and the death of Jesus only opened the door for the spirit of God to come and live inside of us rejoicing about those two things but never receiving the intentions that God had by doing them is in is going to be in vain are are you with me is this this this word is real this this evening it's real to me oh God is a spirit the Holy Spirit but he's also the word now I want to try to break this a little bit John 1 says in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God Amen later on in chapter four he said God is a spirit Jesus speaking and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen so he's the word and he's the spirit now when it comes to the Bible it's all truth it's a sword and any sword Like a Knife is dangerous but this word is really dangerous it's nothing to play with amen and it's nothing to ignore Jesus said in John 12:47 and if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not for I came not to judge the world but I came to save the world right now when you just look at that word that sentence that verse it don't seem that dangerous but just look at the next verse he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words have one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day this is what I want to say to everybody here when there is something wrong the Bible tells us judge nothing before it's time we're quick on wanting to judge judge things I'll say if you want to be quick to judge judge yourself judge yourself never go wrong I don't care how quick you are but when it comes to others look God gave Grace to mankind amen as long as he's got breath in his lungs he's got a chance to repent that's right who are we to say time's up for somebody and judge them let's go back to our opening scripture John 3:1 15 that what that whosoever believeth in him should not not perish but have eternal life did you ever wonder why the word says should not perish list said I'm going to come out there and sit next to you in the seats if you don't start talking to me when I ask you questions verse 16 for God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him they should not perish but have everlasting life why does the Bible say should not why doesn't the Bible say will [Music] not Christ was not a gift to be left on the tree God's word was meant to be received and obeyed and that gift the gift that the father's given us the son we need to open this gift that he's given us and receive it amen but not the word the spirit of the word there's a difference amen you can believe it and miss it you can believe and miss it that's why Jesus said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they these are these that testify of who I am so my opinion don't matter who God is your opinion don't matter who God is the word testifies of who he is and we've got to believe it according to the scriptures if we try to take part of the father's gift that he's given us but not receive all of his word we're not receiving God and people want to separate oh I've received God but you know no I don't need to do I don't I don't need to do all that that was for some other time you're re what you're doing is you're postponing your judgment because God ain't going to judge you now necessarily he may wait till the have judgment but judgment will come that's why I say this word is nothing to mess with it's God it's God and you've got to respect it as God you got to reverence it like God for God sent not verse 17 his son into the world to condemn it but that the world through him might be saved that was his his goal so if all you had to do is just believe that Jesus died for you then there would be no need for a nature change there'd be no need to be born again there would be no need for all things to be of God so we've got to take all the scriptures if we're going to get the understanding he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because have not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God and this is the condemnation that light has come into the world and Men love Darkness rather than light because their deeds were evil here's the choice that we all have to make God's will or ours our our will is Darkness it's evil and when we say we don't love light we're just saying we don't love to do God's Will and and here here's the thing Saints it's up to us to get serious about whether we're doing God's will every day you know I believe with all my heart I I believe with all my heart that this church does not put anybody in a Rapture but I do believe that God will provide a way for you to make a Rapture in this church big difference you know we sit here and we we expect God to do something when God's waiting on us God's waiting on us we we're loving to do our will too much soad of dying out and saying Lord what would you have me to do today it's not what we know it's what we yield ourselves to for everyone that doeth evil hateth the light neither cometh to the light lest his deed should be reproved but he that doeth truth cometh to the light that his deeds may be made manifest that they are wrought of God the word of God is a light for our lives but his word without the spirit will only bring condemnation and judgment eventually judgment to our lives we need the spirit of the word we need the Living Word we need to enter in to the spirit that's being that's ministering Amen to our hearts we need to enter into that spirit because we don't believe this is a a seminar where we we we learn intellectually about God when we leave here we want the spirit of God with us we don't want the knowledge of God we want the spirit of God With Us amen amen 2 Corinthians 3:6 Paul says to the Corinthian Church God has made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit amen for the letter kth but the spirit it gives life so you want you want life to come forth from the the services from the ministry enter into the spirit of the word that that's where you're at God God could be right here and speak words and it's not going to change us we've got to receive the spirit of the word and it takes heart it's where you give your heart it's God I need you I need you right now I need to I need to I need this on the inside I hear it here understand it but I need it inside that's what it takes when we open the father's gift and receive the spirit of the word we actually what become the word amen you know you can receive the spir you can receive the knowledge of the word here and never become it you could become a a walking cyclopedia talk about the word talk about it but never ever manifest it we're going have to glue these things on all right 2 Corinthians chapter 3:2 ye are our Epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as you have manifested declared to be the Epistles of Christ man ministered by US Written not with ink but with the spirit of the Living God not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of heart see God's spirit is meant to to come inside of us and manifest and I'll say this today we've all received Christ as our savior but I want to ask you the question have you received all what Christ is that means we got to get into the gift that God gave us we got to open that up and say God I need the spirit of your word inside me because that's what Christ is that is what the gift is I don't want just a nice sound church amen I don't want to be just under the umbrella of the message I don't want to be with just what's people that say they believe I want him in sonomy I want them when the when the going gets tough and I'm in a rough situation I want about to call on God I want about to have faith in God and that he comes on the rescue the Bible says when all thy ways please the Lord he'll make even thy enemies to be at peace with you and what excuses do we use why don't we just get back to the word let the word tell you what you need to do maybe there's some more ways in our life that we need to please them Jesus said in John 663 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh proth nothing the words that speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen God's word is the light for our lives Psalms Thy word is a lamp unto my feet it is a light unto my path through thy precepts I get understanding amen through thy Commandments thou has made me Wis ER than my enemies right through thy Commandments the word of the Lord is perfect converting the soul you need the word to get converted amen don't leave them on the tree get them off open that gift let that the spirit of God come inside you well brother John I've asked him but I just don't seem to get anymore you need to get hungering and thirsting more because God's word Remains the Same amen nobody's going to meet him on that day and say God you were a liar you never came into my heart when I asked you he'll say you never wanted me enough because the whole world wants to go to heaven they don't want to go to hell I can tell you that but I don't think they're willing to do what the word tells them to do you've got to want it so bad that you give up your will for his amen salvation is not a Christmas present true salvation comes through Obedience of this word Thy word the word of the Lord is perfect following the word will convert a soul that's why many people are lost because of a lack of the knowledge they get the wrong knowledge people are ever growing ever learning but never coming to the knowledge of the truth the knowledge of the truth is you need to receive the spirit of God that's the knowledge of the truth needs to be living in you now if you want to exchange gifts this year how many wants to exchange gifts with the Lord this year amen well give him your heart your spirit and he will give you his heart and his Spirit that's right amen what a wonderful exchang pour out more love for his word set your affections on things above John said in or uh Jesus said in John 14:23 now listen to these words if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him that's opening the father's gift right there that's what John 3:16 was all about was to get brother Ram said that God all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured into the church and God's desire for the church is that he might be preeminent in the church now how do I know he's preeminent in my life well I'm going to be honest with you I can't wake up every day and say God you're going to be preeminent in this in my my life today and there's not a day I go to bed and I I lay down on my bed and I say praise God you were preeminent my life today it takes a consciousness of God I want you first I want to do your will come and fill me don't let my mind take me away from you being pre imminent you can be as close to God as you want you can have as much of God as you want you can never have too much if you want more give more die more all right if you want God's personal attention open the word of God if you want more of God's attention open this word with one thing more reverence it's just not a book to read it's not just using it as some Ouija board to try to get some direction out of your life reverence the whole word the whole word is God yes this word is a lamp for our path for our it's a light for us but it's not meant just to use God for when we want him I believe if we be to have more respect for the word of God more reverence so when the word is preached or we read the word or we're listening to the word that we we we have a greater fear to walk in it that's when you're going to get a hold of God's attention for your life Isaiah 66 verse1 praise the Lord I want this to be on the board Isaiah 66 verse1 thus saith the Lord the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my foot stew where is the house you're going to build me or where is the place of my rest for all those things have my hands made that's right and all those things have been sayeth the Lord but to this man to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word trembleth not just oh well this is the good book says trembleth you know what that word trembleth means means reverent I had to look it up it means reverent you want God to look at you you want more attention with God you want God to move more in your favor we have the answer right here become more reverent to the word you know sometimes God wants you to do something and you don't want to do it sometimes you come to church with other reasons that why God want you here sometimes God's trying to get you to do something but you don't think that's important in your life and you're trying to get answers over here well if you want God to move in your behalf you need to become more reverent to the word of God it's all there is to it keep opening the father's gift personally for your life because you know you live in a home not everybody is going to make the same sacrifice that you're going to make but this isn't about you in your home it's not about you and your church it's not about you and your work God deals with us as individuals you may make a greater sacrifice than somebody else somebody else may make a greater sacrifice in you look I'm glad that Paul said follow me as I follow Christ because the moment that I don't if he would have just said look I wrote 14 books in the Bible the first prophet Ephesian Church you need to listen to me but he decided not to follow Christ somewhere what would happen to all of us following him so don't follow some man's example follow Christ follow the word and he's trying to lead us up higher than we're even thinking about he's trying to get us to a place that we've lost faith and confidence how to get there but I'm still a believer that I'm going to be just like him when he appears I may not now God anybody that knows me can testify I'm not but one day I'm going to be I'm a believer of the word I'm gonna believe what the word says about me rather than what I think about myself amen so keep opening the word one time Jesus was was talking to some Jews which believed on him already and he said to them if you continue in my word then you're my disciples indeed you just can't say I believe and I'm saved you got to continue walking in the light I always say like we've heard this we all know that God don't take some till they're most ready to go God's not going to take us till he's done with us right that means that if we're alive God has an expectation of us and every time he gives us more word we need to be walking in it amen amen now I want to talk about how we can get more of what God has for us in this word and I want us to go to Hebrews chapter 4 verse1 Paul speaking to the Hebrew church he said let us therefore fear he throws that word in fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of you should seem to come short of it now the three Hebrew children they were in that rest amen they weren't you know what I'm scared I don't know I don't really want to go in that fiery furnace they had the goods and I believe that if you apply this scripture to your life that this word contains the promises that you need for such a nature change that you will be perfectly at peace and at rest no matter what happens because that's what the Holy Ghost is the now we know this word the prophet taught us that this word is our rest but it's not the written word it's the spirit of the word because the natural word no matter how much we believe the natural word if we never get to the spirit of the word the natural word is just going to condemn us we're going to feel convicted because it's like the law right that's what the law was you can't live the law you can't live the word only the Holy Ghost Inside you can live his own word right so that's why we're we we seek more of the Holy Ghost so we can live more of the word it takes the pressure off of us verse Two For unto us was the Gospel preach as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so the children of Israel heard God's voice I have given you a land now go possess it it's yours take it but when the word was preached to them it just kind of fell to the wayside it fell it went in one ear and out the other the word that was preached didn't it was a natural word the national War said yeah we're more than able to to take the land let's go it's yours and when they saw the giant it it neglected that they were able to take the land because that giant made them fearful made them scared even though they heard the word in church but they didn't receive the spirit of the word that's right brother Ron Joshua and cayb the Bible says was of another Spirit what was that spirit that was the spirit of the word and that's why they in the face of 1.8 million people that were against them could still have confidence in going we've got to receive the spirit of the word we've got to get so serious and so dedicated to getting into the spirit of the of the message of the hour and the word that's being preached because if we just hear the natural word it's not going to profit us anything it's not going to help us in our trials it's not going to help us in our test we need to hear what the spirit is saying to the church right that's what Jesus said he that got ears to hear what the spirit is saying not the man who's preaching not the natural word but the spirit of the word now how do I get God Spirit just to speak to me well the antidote or the solution to this I'll say very common problem is fear because that's what Hebrews tells us to do let us therefore fear that's the answer fear now that word fear means to be frightened at the fact that you could miss it to be alarmed to be at awe to be reverent towards God more than you presently are that's what fear means that's all internal right it's not what you say it's not how you dress not showing up for church it's something that's real the inside of you I don't want to miss it and that's what causes you to start obeying the word that's what causes you to pray more it's causes you to come and be more prepared so the word falls on good ground it's the fear of the Lord it's the beginning of wisdom amen Faith cometh by hearing and proper hearing comes from hearing directly from God and not man not the man standing behind the pulpit even when you read this I mean you know brother bam talked about all these these um people who get um degrees they go to a seminary and they get a degree and they spend many years in a seminary and they know the Bible and brother Brenham says they're further away from God than when they went in there and it's because they never received the spe of the word they're sitting there listening to a man talk to them this is what you got to do this is what our denomination believes this is this is what you got to do this is this we believe our church is the right way and they never meet Christ themselves that's true just five minutes in his presence five minutes in his presence can do more than 5 years away from his presence I wouldn't trade a person personal relationship with God with any knowledge or any revelation of anything else this is how we fear I know Lord your word is being preached but unless you come and make it real to me it's going to be in vain I'm going to walk out of here I'm not going to think about the service I'm not going to talk about it it's just going to be another service I'm going to appease my my attendance record Lord I want this word opened up to me personally I don't know why anybody else is here but I know why I'm here I'm coming to you today with faith amen and I reverence your word I respect your word I want to dedicate myself to this word you know the prophet often rededicated his life our Prophet did rededicated this is how you open up the father's gift to you this is how you open it God's got to come and reveal himself we can't know God any other way we can't figure it out he comes and unveils himself to us the word needs to become more real to us we need to believe it to the point that we'll rever it him more when we come into the presence of the word all right do you battle healing how many has ever battled healing before I mean I wanted God to come and heal me now this I'm just going to talk about the Simplicity of the word we got to open the father's gift what does it say by his stripes we are healed amen now you just say Lord thank you for bearing the stripes for me as you did for somebody else because the problem is we know God has healed somebody because we hear testimonies but we want God to heal us so thank the Lord for healing you as he has healed other people he bore those stripes for you just as much as he borne for somebody else so by faith you just start thanking him and I'll say it like this you thank him every day because if you just thank him for a little bit and then just stop thinking about it well where's your faith humies battled negativity negative thoughts open the father's gift what does the word say think on these things amen when we start practicing the controlling of our thoughts is when positiveness can come into our minds Paul told the Corinthian Church cast down your imaginations cast down every High thing that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God and bring it into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ well you know if you truly sincerely do that you ain't got hardly time at all to do anything but if you just open your you know our mind is like a womb right you just open it up to any old thought you'll be thinking anything before you know the devil will take you a place that'll get you so down and discouraged you got to take control of your thought you got to bring it into The Obedience of the word think on these things how many's battled the wrong type of fear the wrong type of fear scared open the word reverence what it says reverence what it says what does the word say about fear perfect love cast all fear out right so instead of just say God take this fear away to help me no get perfect love seek perfect love it'll automatically you'll automatically have faith to cast it out just say Lord Jesus fill me with your Divine love it's got to start see this is a relationship God gives you his word you take the word let it abide in you start practicing it before I know it you become the manifested word yes it's that simple God is hid in Simplicity we're looking for this miraculous thing on the outside God's looking to do a work inside of us the Lord is my helper I will not fear what Man shows do unto me just look into the book open the present if you've been wondering if he's really going to take you through all the way to the Rapture have you ever just battled maybe I'm just not going to go all the way open his gift and see what it says he said I will never leave thee nor forsake thee just believe it that's right you've got to believe it I am with you always even until the end of the world Jesus said just believe it reverence the word he that had begun a good work in you is going to finish it reverence the word don't sit there and just say well it's just the word you're not reverencing it it's not going to change you nothing will happen you've got to reverence the word then that word the spirit of the word comes inside of you and is manif ested God don't want you wondering just believe the word I me it's battled if God's going to if he's going to keep loving you or if he's just going to like now I'm moving on to someone else what does the father's gift say I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor death nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord that settles it I reverence that word and if God God believes this for me if God's saying this to me then God is saying it for my brother God is saying it for my sister how many want more of the Holy Ghost let's open the the father's gift and see what's inside Jesus said in Matthew 7 ask and it shall be given unto you seek and you shall find knock and it shall be open for everyone that askthe that seeketh findeth and to him that knocketh it shall be open now he didn't say most he said everyone yes every one that askthestorybots want more Holy Ghost just start asking them if you're content with what you have don't ask them if you think you got enough don't ask him but if you want more there's more for you we got God in proportion in portion Jesus had the Holy Ghost without portion right he had the fullness of the godhead dwelt in him amen we have a portion we can get more it's a the same way we got it at the beginning it hasn't changed there's not a different word for us amen you know when you're seeking him and you're asking him God fill me with more of the Holy Ghost you know what if you're not doing something God wants you to be doing if you need to make something right if you need to stop doing something whatever it is God will speak to you at that time and he'll make know what he wants you to do because maybe there's something that you need to do cuz he G gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him amen if ye then being in evil know how to give good gifts how many you got gifts for your children at some time a birthday or Christmas if you know how to give good gifts to your children and if you feel like me you're not the best dad in in the planet how much more shall your heavenly father give you the Holy Ghost to them that ask him his desire his whole purpose of sending his gift of his son was so you could get the Holy Ghost that was his whole purpose amen he's not just satisfied with just saving you and he's going to plaster you on the wall in heaven he wants to live in you he wants to make his AB bold with you he wants a realness there how many wants to be a greater Overcomer look don't be looking for power in yourself to do it just agree with the word open up the open up the father's gift to you and see what it says and reverently just say I believe it the Bible says ye are of God and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that's in the world don't be saying I don't know what to do with this situation don't say that I understand I understand you don't know what to do I understand that but just stand there and let God start working through you because he knows how to handle the situation believe me he created everything I'm sure he can handle it the problem is we just try to take the reins and have to figure it all ourself God wants to work through us what else does the Bible say please plead the blood of the Lamb this is the antidote here for overcoming plead the blood of the Lamb testify that the what the word says and keep crucifying your flesh right they love not theirself unto the death and that's how they overcame them so you got to keep crucifying you got to keep testifying what the word says about you you got to keep pleading the blood for the mistakes that you make this is the victory that overcometh the world even your faith you have to believe what the word says am it won't do any good if you don't believe now when we open the father's gift to us we will see the very nature of God in that gift and that's what he's given us his own nature second Peter chapter 1 verse4 whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises in this Bible that by these promises we might be partakers of the divine nature of God having escaped the corruption in this world right here this world through lust wanting its will wanting to do it its way we got to escape that we got to have the the divine nature of God living out of us and and handling things the way that God handles them there's power God has power he said every place at The Souls of your feet shall tread upon that I have given you what do we got to do only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest Prosper whether soever thou goest I don't know where he's leading me I don't know where I'm going tomorrow but I know this that if I keep him first he's going to prosper my steps wherever I go he's going to prosper them now if he's not prospering them it ain't his fault somewhere down the line I'm not observing to do something right right maybe all my ways are not pleasing the Lord maybe some of the ways are just pleasing me we just need to get serious and reverence the word because this word is real it works it lives this word lives in the person who will believe it whatever ever you need whatever your need might be just be conscious of opening the father's gift Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you it's a promise we all want God to do things but we're not real excited about getting the word to abide in US Jesus said and all things whatsoever you ask in prayer believing believing and ye shall receive that's right we need to open the the father's gift that he's given to us in I'll say it like this it was broken down in this generation through a prophet I just got three quotes here and then I'm done okay I'm not going to continue to go and go but this my Christmas message for 2024 or [Laughter] 2023 brother BR send the message expectations this is in 1950 I think we just need to start holding ourselves accountable to our attitude he said we always get what we expect when people expect anything well then they usually get what they look for it's the mental attitude that you have he said remember this and never forget it the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass the right mental attitude towards any promise of god wow that is in my reach he just put that he just put it in my reach right there it doesn't take Gifts of healing to heal sick people any person in here has the right to meet Satan anywhere if you're a Christian and defeat him on the grounds that he could stand on all we got to do is believe the word I'm thankful for gifts we want all of them we want more of them we want him doubled oh we I just want him I just want him on the inside more of him all right 13 years later in the Awakening in the message Awakening Jesus brother B says the mental attitude you take towards take towards it will bring and then he just stops here and goes dot dot dot he says now the mind won't do it this is why I'm I'm the reason I'm reading this the mind doesn't bring the promise to pass but if you get the attitude towards something that's got life in it which is God he's the only thing that's got life in it then that life comes down and does it not your mental attitude that only brings you into the presence of him so I want you to understand understand this you play a part in bringing God's promise to pass which is your right mental attitude bringing you into the presence of God and that attitude you hold it there brother BR says you you hold the to token you hold the token there The Life of Christ you come into His presence this is my need then he brings that promise to pass we can't bring it he does do you see that and if we don't play that part of a right mental attitude we're going to miss out in the message show us the father last quote and I go on record and I say this about the word of God today being a seed if you can take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God he will bring it to pass notice he will bring it to pass if you can get yourself into the position to believe that that promise was for you and it is a mental battle right let's Stand Together God bless you it is a battle just trust the word more trust the word more reverence that word want that word long for that word amen let's just go before in a in a word of prayer our heavenly father Lord we thank you for giving yourself to defeat Satan thank you for sending your son Lord we're not worthy of the gift that you gave we thank you we thank you for that birth and we thank you that you it was your plan from the foundation of the world to this perfect sinless life to be sacrificed in our stead that your spirit could come back and live inside of us God I don't feel worthy of Heaven and though Lord I long to go to heaven I say I desire more and pray more I hunger more I thirst more for heaven to come and live inside of me down here that your nature will manifest itself more inside this this vessel not much to behold but Lord we pray that you would birth your word inside of each one of us we want to be those a living Epistles read of all men Lord we want to be in those rough situations that only Christ is manifested at that time lord we want to go from where we're at to where your calling is we want to be just like you in your image Lord father I pray that you'd take the words that have been uh spoken and that Lord you would speak them in spirit to every heart and every life that Lord we could begin to put in practice these things that you've given us we're so thankful Lord that you have more for us where there there's a deep calling there's a deep to respond and we're thankful Lord that that there's more of you that we can have in our lives God we want to say thank you for all that you are in our lives right now thank you for for saving us Lord thank you for coming in into our lives and that that that seed of God that's been germinated and and growing continuously manifesting itself more and more Lord for your you're looking for a a group of people that will continue to grow in the things of God as the world is getting more evil and evil God we give you ourselves we yield ourselves to you we surrender Our Lives father I just pray that you would help us Lord in the days to come just to open that gift up there's more for us in there God we give you the praise for this we thank you now for all these things we ask them in the almighty name of Jesus Christ amen amen can we sing that let your word be borne in the manger of my heart I want that to happen every time I come to church it was a tiny simple stable all beaten and torn hardly a place for King to be born he didn't choose some place special to reveal his majesty so I know if I'll give him control he'll be born in in [Music] me let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it start live inside this house of clay and mold it every day let your word be bornn in the manger of my heart well outwardly I'm nothing not much to behold unlikely the place for his word to unfold but if I just yield my vessel let him have his way from Glory onto Glory he'll change me day by day let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it St heart live inside this house of clay and molded every day let your word be born in the manger of my amen one more time oh let your word be born in the manger of my heart let it live in me let it stop amen Lord live inside this house of clay and mold it every day let your word be born in the manger of my heart amen praise the Lord that's my desire I trust that it's yours amen let's sing that little chorus into my heart into my heart into my heart into my heart hallah oh
