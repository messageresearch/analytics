[29:26] we've often heard he's the reason for
[29:29] the season
[29:33] he's the reason that we gather together
[29:36] amen amen
[29:39] well if you'd like to turn with us
[29:42] in the book of revelations chapter 3 for
[29:44] opening scripture we've been
[29:46] doing the start a little series on
[29:50] the enemy that works within us and
[29:53] uh last sunday we spoke on detecting
[29:58] the uh the enemy within us
[30:02] and uh i could just uh for a second
[30:06] take a little census and i need you to
[30:07] be just super duper honest with me
[30:11] uh it's okay if if you don't participate
[30:14] and it's okay however you answer
[30:17] but how many has practiced more
[30:21] in this last week detecting the enemy
[30:24] within you
[30:26] than you have in the past
[30:29] okay all right and and
[30:32] how many has uh been at least
[30:36] trying to detect the enemy more within
[30:40] this is so vital in order to disarm
[30:44] because if you don't recognize something
[30:47] you can't disarm it now we've been in
[30:49] situations where we're just
[30:51] in a battle and we just how do i defuse
[30:54] this thing
[30:55] well if the enemy is always outside
[30:59] you never know how to do it you never
[31:00] know how to control but you can control
[31:03] the enemy inside amen
[31:06] amen let's look to the lord in prayer
[31:08] before we
[31:09] read these words heavenly father we
[31:12] thank you
[31:13] lord that you've made it possible that
[31:15] we could gather once more
[31:17] in your house to honor the resurrection
[31:22] lord
[31:26] you've blessed each one of us with
[31:27] salvation we're ever grateful for it
[31:29] today
[31:31] we could not thank you enough we cannot
[31:32] worship you enough
[31:34] but we thank you for this time that we
[31:37] we've had to worship you in song and
[31:40] to lift up our voices and not have to be
[31:44] dictated by somebody else
[31:47] what we're allowed to say what we're not
[31:48] allowed to say
[31:50] but lord express our love and our
[31:52] thanksgiving to you today
[31:54] it's a privilege that we have today we
[31:57] thank you for that these doors are open
[31:58] we thank you for the liberty that we
[32:00] have here
[32:02] and lord we pray that lord that you
[32:04] would
[32:05] you would come in the way of revelation
[32:08] to your word now
[32:10] lord this important part of you building
[32:12] your church in us and
[32:15] teaching us how to overcome all things
[32:20] lord we're depending on you and pray
[32:22] that
[32:23] you would not bypass anyone but that
[32:27] each one would
[32:28] feel your spirit know your presence know
[32:30] you're speaking to them
[32:32] and see the simplicity of just saying
[32:34] amen to whatever you would say
[32:36] granted lord we commit the service to
[32:38] you
[32:40] we love you we thank you for these
[32:41] things for we ask in jesus name
[32:43] amen amen revelations chapter three
[32:47] these are familiar scriptures starting
[32:50] with verse
[32:51] number 21.
[32:56] to him that overcometh
[32:59] will i grant to sit with me in my throne
[33:02] even as i have overcame
[33:04] and sat down with my father and his
[33:06] throne
[33:07] he that have an ear to hear let him hear
[33:09] with the spirit
[33:12] uh he that have an ear to hear let him
[33:14] hear with the spirit is saying
[33:16] unto the church amen and then revelation
[33:20] chapter 21 how many want to hear
[33:24] from the lord today amen we we need
[33:28] an ear we need an ear and
[33:31] god uh you know we were born with
[33:34] natural ears
[33:35] but that doesn't mean we were born with
[33:36] spiritual ears
[33:38] that takes a yearning and a desire
[33:41] right you the more you hunger the more
[33:44] that you'll hear
[33:46] amen revelation chapter 21 and starting
[33:49] with verse
[33:50] number 5
[33:55] 21 verse 5
[34:00] and he that sat upon the throne said
[34:03] behold
[34:04] i make all things new
[34:07] that includes us includes our nature
[34:10] inside
[34:10] i make all things new he's in the new
[34:13] business
[34:15] and he said unto me right for these
[34:17] words are true and faithful and he
[34:19] said unto me it is done i am the alpha
[34:22] and the omega the beginning and the end
[34:24] i will give unto him that is a thirst of
[34:26] the fountain of the water of life freely
[34:29] he that overcometh shall inherit
[34:32] all things and i will be his god
[34:35] and he shall be my son
[34:40] now look what happens if we don't
[34:41] overcome
[34:44] but the fearful and the unbelieving
[34:48] and the abominable and the murders and
[34:49] the whoremongers and the sorcerers and
[34:51] the idolaters and all the liars
[34:53] shall have their part in the lake of
[34:55] fire which burneth uh
[34:57] in the part of the lake which burneth
[34:59] with fire and brimstone which is
[35:02] the second death may god bless you may
[35:05] be seated
[35:09] if we overcome all things
[35:12] we inherit all things and this is the
[35:15] hardest age brother
[35:16] said is the most wicked it's the most
[35:19] horrible
[35:21] it's it's dark it's deceiving you can't
[35:24] believe anybody can't trust anybody
[35:27] can't trust the thoughts that come into
[35:28] your head
[35:30] it is the hardest age to overcome but
[35:34] if we overcome it we inherit all things
[35:40] and being that it is the hardest we
[35:43] need all the word to overcome it
[35:47] we cannot in this fight that we're in
[35:51] get scared and say you know what i i
[35:56] i'm just backing off you can't do that
[35:58] because
[35:59] you'll never be found as an overcomer
[36:02] you can't be scared of anything the
[36:05] bride is fearless the righteousness bold
[36:07] is a lion
[36:08] you have to be fearless
[36:11] good example that is david david goliath
[36:17] now the more we practice identifying the
[36:20] enemy within us and exposing him
[36:22] the more we'll be able to disarm him it
[36:24] is the key
[36:25] to a victorious walk if you question
[36:28] you know why don't i got joy why am i
[36:30] doing this why ain't doing that
[36:32] why where where's the peace where's the
[36:34] where's my lung suffering where's my
[36:36] pace
[36:37] when you when you're con asking those
[36:40] questions
[36:41] about yourself the problem is within
[36:45] it's nothing without it's nothing
[36:48] somebody did to you
[36:49] it's nothing about the preaching just
[36:54] listen to a brother branham tape because
[36:55] that's who god sent that's who god sent
[36:58] with the message if you can listen to
[37:00] that tape
[37:00] and your life is turned upside down and
[37:03] you got the victory that i say keep
[37:05] listening to the tape
[37:07] but it's not the preaching jesus said he
[37:10] that have an ear
[37:13] you've got to hear what the preaching is
[37:15] actually saying amen
[37:17] we don't want to settle for just holding
[37:19] on to being a son
[37:21] or a daughter of god or i'm in the
[37:24] message or i'm bride you don't want to
[37:26] settle for that we got to have enough
[37:27] faith to overcome the flesh
[37:31] the self nature to just get by
[37:38] to walk in the spirit exhibiting the
[37:40] fruits of the spirit
[37:41] joy peace long suffering that's what we
[37:43] must have
[37:44] to take the land that god has promised
[37:46] for our lives
[37:48] psalms 27 verse 12 says deliver me not
[37:52] over unto the will of my enemies
[37:56] for false witnesses are risen up against
[37:58] me deliver me not
[38:00] over to the will of my enemies your
[38:02] flesh has a will
[38:04] and it is your enemy
[38:10] and when you yield to it you've been
[38:13] delivered over to the will
[38:15] you ever been in such a rage such a
[38:17] fight such an anger
[38:20] it's like you can't even hardly control
[38:21] yourself
[38:24] you've been given over to the will of
[38:25] your enemy
[38:27] you think you're fighting the enemy who
[38:29] you're who you're angry against
[38:35] you haven't been given over to their
[38:36] will but you've been given over the will
[38:39] of your flesh
[38:41] and we need deliverance from that amen
[38:44] the enemy unquestionably works within us
[38:49] but our pride will question that
[38:52] you know we don't want to really accept
[38:54] the devil's innocence usually
[38:55] in somebody else we'll go as far as
[38:59] saying
[39:00] they really bring out the worst of me
[39:04] the scripture declares greater is he
[39:06] that's in you
[39:07] than he that's in the world we may look
[39:10] at that scripture and we may say
[39:12] you know that just shows you that god is
[39:14] in me
[39:16] and and the devil's out in the world out
[39:18] there but really what that means
[39:20] is greater is the holy ghost that's
[39:22] inside of us
[39:24] than he that is in your worldly nature
[39:27] that you've been born with
[39:30] and you've got to believe that one is
[39:32] greater than the other
[39:35] now if you do nothing your natural
[39:38] nature
[39:39] will take over and the
[39:42] the the proof of that is before you came
[39:44] to the lord you did what you wanted to
[39:46] do
[39:48] we all the bible says we all had our
[39:49] conversations in times past and lust of
[39:51] the flesh
[39:52] doing the desires that we wanted to do
[39:54] and the only way that ever stops
[39:56] is when you say i'm done with that and
[39:59] you crucify it and you say i'm going to
[40:01] do the will of god
[40:04] of course you can't do it on your own
[40:06] you need to become born again you need
[40:07] the holy ghost
[40:11] but it isn't something that's done away
[40:13] with just because you repented and you
[40:14] got baptized
[40:17] otherwise jesus would have never said
[40:19] you have to die daily paul would have
[40:20] never said he had to die daily
[40:23] brother brandon would have said you
[40:24] never had to die so it's there
[40:26] is there till we leave so we got to keep
[40:28] it under
[40:29] we have to keep it dead paul affirmed
[40:33] that there was a law
[40:34] of sin inside his members that were
[40:36] warned against
[40:38] his mind a law of sin in other words
[40:41] just
[40:41] there with the flesh he said when he
[40:44] would go to do good
[40:45] evil was present with me now he didn't
[40:48] ask for it
[40:49] he didn't want it but it was still
[40:51] present with him
[40:53] it's here today we brought it to church
[40:59] now if you got serious and you crucified
[41:01] the old man
[41:05] then he can't do you any harm
[41:09] brother branham said we're in the
[41:10] greatest battle over fault and it's
[41:12] still going on today in our minds
[41:14] we can't run away from it we can't
[41:15] ignore we must
[41:17] defeat the enemy within us we must
[41:20] overcome
[41:21] amen satan has been working on doing
[41:24] inside jobs from the beginning
[41:27] he didn't wrestle uh eve to the ground
[41:31] in a headlock
[41:36] he didn't come to eve and start fighting
[41:38] physically
[41:40] calling our names it was something that
[41:43] happened within
[41:46] each one of us must become good
[41:49] detectives
[41:52] trying and discerning the spirits that
[41:54] come to us
[41:57] and then we must learn to disarm
[42:00] them because they're not going away on
[42:02] their own
[42:03] you ever ever watch a movie where
[42:05] there's like a bomb and they got to call
[42:07] the bomb squad in
[42:09] it's in the bob squad comes in they've
[42:10] got those suits on
[42:12] they're going like this or walking over
[42:14] and they're you know they gotta
[42:16] look at it and the time's ticking away
[42:18] and they got these wires they don't know
[42:20] if they should cut the red one or the
[42:22] you know what i'm talking about they
[42:24] want to disarm the bomb before it blows
[42:26] up
[42:28] if you don't disarm the enemy it's going
[42:30] to blow up
[42:33] please please
[42:37] go with me
[42:44] paul said they that are in the flesh
[42:47] they mine the things of the flesh
[42:51] i'm holy ghost filled okay great but if
[42:53] you are in the flesh
[42:54] you're going to mind the things of the
[42:56] flesh why it's not
[42:58] because of you but it's because your
[43:00] flesh is just like everybody else's
[43:02] flesh
[43:03] and whether you don't know god or you
[43:05] know god or you have god the flesh still
[43:07] acts the same
[43:08] are you with me that's all there is to
[43:10] it so the key
[43:12] is walk in the spirit get in the spirit
[43:14] stand in the spirit dance in the spirit
[43:16] pray in the spirit get out of the flesh
[43:20] know the difference
[43:24] brother brahm said in the message the
[43:25] greatest battle of her fault
[43:27] he said there's something about it if
[43:30] you're ever alone that way talking about
[43:32] the desert of arizona he says there's
[43:34] something that draws you
[43:36] there i i guess is one reason i like
[43:39] those away places you get away
[43:41] from the power of the enemy
[43:45] so much as we have here
[43:48] he said a devil is almost harmless
[43:51] unless he has something to work in
[43:56] he says you remember those devils that
[43:58] were cast out of legion they wanted to
[44:00] do more mischief
[44:03] so they went into the hogs
[44:07] so devils must have something to work in
[44:10] somebody to work through
[44:14] i'd like to take this beautiful thought
[44:17] and disarm the enemy
[44:18] within us
[44:21] how many believe that god is hid in
[44:23] simplicity his truth is hidden
[44:25] simplicity
[44:26] and that's where we'll find him i
[44:29] believe that god has given us
[44:30] scriptural direction how to disarm the
[44:33] enemy
[44:34] if we don't allow the enemy to work
[44:37] through us he can't do anything
[44:41] to harm us
[44:44] what a thought
[44:50] did not the prophet say my greatest
[44:52] enemy is me
[44:55] well if you disarm
[44:59] your nature he can't work through you
[45:02] we must learn to disarm our human
[45:06] nature i want that to sink deep
[45:10] the better detective you become and
[45:12] seeing what the devil is working
[45:14] in your thoughts and your feelings the
[45:16] more you'll be able to disarm them right
[45:17] there
[45:20] based on a newly discovered secret
[45:23] documents from the german archives
[45:25] diaries and newspapers
[45:27] of that time gun control in the third
[45:30] right
[45:31] presents the definitive yet hidden
[45:34] mystery
[45:35] of how the nazi regime made use of gun
[45:38] control
[45:39] to disarm and repress its enemies
[45:42] and consolidate power and render
[45:45] political opponents
[45:46] and jews defenseless
[45:53] they took the guns away
[45:56] they had a purpose for doing that
[46:00] there's certain political people today
[46:02] that may want you to believe that the
[46:04] reason they want to take the guns this
[46:06] way
[46:06] is to to disarm the bad people and
[46:10] control the violence that's going on
[46:13] sounds like a good reason but reality
[46:15] the spirit behind that
[46:17] is to disarm the people of america to
[46:20] take away our second
[46:21] amendment they may not recognize that
[46:24] they may not know it but the spirit
[46:25] that's behind it
[46:30] look they this country is going to be
[46:33] blown up
[46:36] i was talking to somebody just yesterday
[46:40] didn't know the prophet but he began to
[46:42] he works on
[46:43] uh the the the programming and the
[46:48] communications of cars that don't need
[46:51] anybody
[46:51] in it and i began to
[46:55] share with him the seven things that
[46:57] happened that the prophet talked about
[47:00] and one of them was the driverless
[47:01] vehicle and they said oh
[47:03] he said i told him six of the seven have
[47:05] come to pass he said that's pretty good
[47:07] betting average what was the seven so i
[47:09] told them
[47:11] it's going to happen it's going to
[47:13] happen
[47:16] the the the spirit
[47:20] is against us
[47:23] i'm thankful for the liberty that i have
[47:27] today to worship god
[47:31] and if it wasn't in uh
[47:35] in the constitution we would not be able
[47:37] to gather together
[47:39] somebody stood up and said i don't care
[47:41] if it's covered or not we're gathering
[47:43] together to worship
[47:44] you can't take that right away from me
[47:47] they want to even change the
[47:48] constitution you change the constitution
[47:51] you miles will just change what america
[47:53] is that's what they want to do
[47:56] i say if you want to change something go
[47:58] somewhere and change it don't change
[48:04] this
[48:07] don't change the word of god
[48:10] stay with the word of god amen if a
[48:13] nation
[48:14] can disarm their people they can set up
[48:17] an
[48:17] absolute monarchy or dictatorship
[48:22] if a nation can disarm a nation
[48:26] they will have nothing to fight with
[48:27] look at the united states they've been
[48:29] trying to disarm
[48:30] certain other nations from using their
[48:32] nuclear
[48:33] power is that true because they don't
[48:37] want them to use that power
[48:39] and blow up other things
[48:44] so disarming is a strategy of control
[48:48] and the devil is constantly working at
[48:51] disarming christians
[48:54] taking away their defense so they can't
[48:56] fight
[48:57] and we need to come to grips with the
[48:59] greatest battle that's in progress right
[49:01] now in our minds and each one of us
[49:03] learn to recognize the devil trying to
[49:06] work on the
[49:07] inside of us and disarm him take control
[49:12] because if you do not let the devil use
[49:15] you
[49:16] he can't do you any harm it's that
[49:19] simple
[49:20] you disarm the enemy by disarming
[49:24] your nature you take away his armor his
[49:28] artillery
[49:29] his power against you you take away the
[49:31] ability to hurt you
[49:33] when you don't let him use you
[49:37] think about when we were little kids or
[49:39] we watch little kids
[49:40] and we tell them don't put anything in
[49:43] that
[49:44] electrical socket
[49:47] and the first thing they want to do is
[49:49] find out what happens when you put
[49:50] something in the electrical socket
[49:55] that's why the devil offers another way
[49:58] an easier way
[49:59] a funner way you get that in your head
[50:03] and you want to try it out
[50:06] you've got to disarm that disarm
[50:11] him amen
[50:14] resist and he'll flee
[50:18] we'll get into that maybe in part three
[50:20] a little bit more
[50:22] but if we learn to disarm our human
[50:24] nature
[50:25] we have disarmed the devil from
[50:28] penetrating us because he doesn't have
[50:29] anything
[50:30] to work through remember a devil is
[50:33] almost harmless unless he can have
[50:35] something to work in
[50:36] devils must have something to work in
[50:38] somebody to work
[50:40] through so let's forget about one
[50:42] another
[50:43] i can't stop the devil in you
[50:47] but i can stop them and me
[50:50] because there's three more agency
[50:54] know dev the lord cannot
[50:57] control you against your will
[51:03] he's just he's a gentleman he's a he's
[51:06] that
[51:07] type of god if that's what you want that
[51:10] is what you'll have everybody that's
[51:13] going to hell
[51:14] is people who did not want god they made
[51:16] a choice
[51:18] he didn't send anybody there because he
[51:20] wanted to
[51:22] you know pleasure in the death of the
[51:24] wicked
[51:26] and everybody that goes to heaven they
[51:27] wanted to go they wanted him
[51:31] so god can't do anything against your
[51:34] will
[51:36] and i can't do anything against the
[51:39] devil that would be inside somebody
[51:43] but i can control this ground right here
[51:48] and if you learn to do that you'll be
[51:50] able to learn to dis-fuse and help other
[51:53] people with problems
[51:55] what do you mean brother john well the
[51:56] bible says a soft answer turns away
[51:59] wrath
[52:02] that when you lay down your life and you
[52:04] turn your cheek and you go the second
[52:06] mile
[52:07] and you learn to do what christ did then
[52:10] you can help the other person
[52:14] but going ahead and trying to prove
[52:16] somebody is wrong
[52:19] prove that they got a devil prove that
[52:21] where there's
[52:22] forget it you dis are this message is
[52:26] about you and your relationship with
[52:28] christ that's what this message is for
[52:32] we all battle with devils
[52:35] we all battle with not letting the devil
[52:38] use us we all
[52:43] but do we battle with
[52:47] disarming the devil within us
[52:52] disarm that nature
[52:55] that's if you see this
[52:58] you'll look at the scriptures different
[53:00] than you've ever seen them before
[53:04] now those of you that heard
[53:07] the last service i want you to take time
[53:11] and go back there and and see
[53:15] because there was many examples of how
[53:18] the spirit of the enemy
[53:19] works in us
[53:23] tricks this gets us caught up
[53:27] and we don't even recognize it well if
[53:30] you don't recognize it you can't do
[53:31] nothing with it but i'm going to just
[53:33] take
[53:33] one of them and i'm going to go through
[53:35] because jesus taught us
[53:37] you'll follow those examples
[53:40] he taught us how to disarm the enemy
[53:44] so matthew chapter 16 verse 21 and from
[53:47] that time forth began jesus to show unto
[53:50] his disciples
[53:51] how that he must go to jerusalem and
[53:52] suffer many things of the elders and the
[53:54] chief priests scribes
[53:55] be killed and be raised again the third
[53:57] day
[53:58] peter took him he began to rebuke him
[54:00] say it be it far from thee
[54:02] lord this shall not be unto thee now he
[54:04] thought he was perfectly in line
[54:06] standing for his pastor
[54:10] and he and he turned jesus turned he
[54:13] said unto peter get thee behind me satan
[54:16] thou are an offense unto me for thou
[54:17] savers not the things that be of god
[54:19] but those that be of men
[54:25] after jesus brings an awareness
[54:28] of what's happening in peter's mind
[54:31] he immediately teaches his disciples how
[54:34] to disarm the enemy
[54:37] look at the next verse the very next
[54:39] verse he teaches it
[54:41] then said jesus unto his disciples
[54:44] if any man will come after me let him
[54:47] deny himself
[54:48] take up his cross and follow me
[54:52] this is how you take away the devil's
[54:54] weaponry
[54:57] our human satanic nature
[55:00] of doing our own will because that's
[55:02] where peter was at
[55:06] he was teaching peter this is how you
[55:09] disarm
[55:10] your that devil from letting use you
[55:15] the word of god is the absolute not what
[55:19] you think about the word of god
[55:22] the word of god is our absolute
[55:27] deny deny
[55:30] deny self-will if any man come after me
[55:35] let him deny himself
[55:36] deny self-will pick up pick up
[55:40] what pick up the cross what is the cross
[55:42] it's god's will
[55:44] god's will is always always always
[55:47] always going to feel like a cross
[55:51] if it's not i'd be questioning whether
[55:52] it's god's will because god's will
[55:54] is not all a better roses and cherries
[55:57] and enjoyable and fame and fortune
[56:01] and recognition no it isn't
[56:05] it may know what you think it is
[56:11] but it's a life of living for others
[56:17] and if you do that you'll have the the
[56:19] strength
[56:22] to have a victorious walk
[56:27] whosoever will save his life
[56:32] his own will whosoever will save his own
[56:35] will shall lose it
[56:39] and whosoever will lose his life
[56:42] his will for my sake shall find it
[56:46] he's teaching his disciples how to
[56:49] disarm
[56:50] the enemy ground within them
[56:53] so the enemy can't use them he's still
[56:56] there he's still in the fleshly nature
[56:58] he can still pop out anytime but if you
[57:01] if you're dead to the flesh he's
[57:03] harmless he can't do anything
[57:12] i mean i i haven't thought about
[57:15] a lot of examples but you see these
[57:17] people who
[57:19] take these snakes and they're holding
[57:21] them and they're
[57:22] wrapped around them and they're kissing
[57:24] them and like i hate snakes
[57:30] if that's your snake better keep your
[57:32] eye on him because he comes near me he's
[57:33] out
[57:36] and i'm not waiting to the third round
[57:44] but we ought to better look at that
[57:48] devil and say i'm not afraid of you
[57:53] because i
[57:54] am not letting you use this nature to do
[57:57] what you want
[57:59] we all have that lust and desire and
[58:02] craving to do our own will to be
[58:04] lazy and not do the things of god that
[58:07] thing must be
[58:08] dead
[58:12] and when you have crucified it when
[58:14] you're dead to it
[58:15] you can be fearless and know that you
[58:17] stand in the power and the presence of
[58:20] almighty god
[58:24] for what is a man profited if he shall
[58:26] gain the whole world
[58:29] lose his own soul what shall a man give
[58:32] in exchange of his soul
[58:36] some good questions
[58:39] what would we gain if we were able to
[58:41] conquer
[58:42] every enemy in the whole world outside
[58:45] of us
[58:48] and never ever conquer the enemy
[58:51] within us we'd still go to hell
[58:59] but you could never ever
[59:02] conquer any enemy outside of you
[59:07] but if you conquered the enemy within
[59:09] you
[59:11] you would have salvation and you would
[59:13] have overcomed all things
[59:17] so who cares what's happening out in the
[59:19] world
[59:21] who cares about well i'm going to do
[59:23] this i'm going to do this and this is
[59:24] right and that's wrong who cares
[59:26] look at the enemy inside of you
[59:30] the man that gets in the way that keeps
[59:31] you from doing the will of god
[59:35] so often we want to conquer somebody to
[59:38] gain
[59:39] something
[59:43] conquer their opinion about you
[59:48] for your reputation
[59:51] prove that they're wrong so you can gain
[59:53] something from it
[59:58] it's it's vain
[1:00:01] it's vain but when you can get serious
[1:00:04] i'm real serious about the enemy that
[1:00:06] lives in me
[1:00:08] i'm serious about this nature that just
[1:00:11] wants to get up in the morning
[1:00:12] do a couple prayers and then do what it
[1:00:14] wants all day
[1:00:17] say i'm a christian i'm in the message
[1:00:21] and the enemy's flourishing
[1:00:24] how is god getting glory in that
[1:00:28] come on you can gain it all
[1:00:31] and never overcome your will
[1:00:36] and lose everything
[1:00:40] we must disarm the enemy within us by
[1:00:43] disarming
[1:00:44] our self-will amen
[1:00:48] see you're not going to destroy
[1:00:53] the devil from existence
[1:00:57] because god created him for a purpose
[1:01:03] but you can take away his ability
[1:01:08] to hurt you
[1:01:12] and god willing if it be his will next
[1:01:15] sunday we want to talk about how to
[1:01:17] destroy the devil in your life
[1:01:19] but we first have to disarm him take
[1:01:22] away his weaponry
[1:01:27] doubles must have something to work in
[1:01:30] they need somebody to work through
[1:01:32] the devils enjoy working in our pride
[1:01:36] disarm the enemy within by disarming
[1:01:39] your pride
[1:01:41] put on the armor of humility
[1:01:44] talking about disarming the enemy
[1:01:47] humility will disarm the devil
[1:01:50] he won't have anything to work through
[1:01:53] you've taken away the battleground of
[1:01:55] his repentantry
[1:01:56] and put on the armor of humility first
[1:01:59] peter chapter five verse five
[1:02:01] first peter chapter five verse five
[1:02:02] likewise younger submit yourselves unto
[1:02:05] the elder
[1:02:06] yeah all of you be subject one to
[1:02:08] another and be
[1:02:09] clothed with humility
[1:02:13] for god resists the proud and giveth
[1:02:15] grace to the humble
[1:02:17] if you do not put on humility god
[1:02:21] is not going to fight your battles
[1:02:25] god is not going to sit there and fight
[1:02:27] for you with your pride
[1:02:29] that's why when you're fighting you're
[1:02:31] angry and you think you're better and
[1:02:32] this and that god isn't on that side
[1:02:36] you may say well i know that that
[1:02:37] doesn't matter your pride
[1:02:39] is what's resisting god is keeping god
[1:02:41] away from fighting
[1:02:43] for you amen be clothed with humility
[1:02:48] god gives more grace to a humble person
[1:02:53] how are you going to get help from god
[1:02:55] when your pride repels
[1:02:58] him away forces him back the word resist
[1:03:01] means
[1:03:02] to arrange oneself against that is to
[1:03:06] uphold
[1:03:06] so when god resisted the problem he
[1:03:09] arranges himself
[1:03:10] in such a way that he resists
[1:03:14] that type of spirit now what is he
[1:03:17] against
[1:03:17] when we talk about pride we're talking
[1:03:20] about
[1:03:21] he's against your attitude that you have
[1:03:24] right now
[1:03:26] we're not talking about your you still
[1:03:28] could be a son of god
[1:03:30] still be a a member of the bride of
[1:03:32] christ
[1:03:35] but we're talking about dealings
[1:03:38] we're talking about heaven because i'll
[1:03:40] tell you what you say you're right about
[1:03:42] something
[1:03:43] somebody came and they punched you right
[1:03:45] in the nose
[1:03:48] and you said i know you were wrong you
[1:03:51] deserve this
[1:03:56] you are not after you're done with what
[1:03:59] you think you're
[1:04:00] doing at that point you're not going to
[1:04:03] walk away
[1:04:04] with victory
[1:04:10] because we don't render evil for evil we
[1:04:12] don't give back what is given to us we
[1:04:14] don't
[1:04:15] put in place vengeance is god's
[1:04:19] he puts things in order
[1:04:22] we're set to the defense of the gospel
[1:04:25] to be christ
[1:04:27] if you could love that person that just
[1:04:29] punched you now they've seen something
[1:04:30] that they've never seen before
[1:04:33] come on only christ could lay down his
[1:04:36] life
[1:04:37] when they spit on them and they did all
[1:04:39] those things it's the nature of
[1:04:41] that's the true love of god to say
[1:04:44] father forgive they don't know what
[1:04:45] they're doing
[1:04:48] the very god that loves us will arrange
[1:04:51] himself
[1:04:52] against us
[1:04:55] when we're proud when we have a spirit
[1:04:58] of pride on us
[1:05:01] the very god that we try to serve will
[1:05:02] oppose us if we don't
[1:05:04] clothe ourselves with humility now it
[1:05:07] isn't just saying
[1:05:08] i i agree and being humble
[1:05:11] it's about you you all put on clothes
[1:05:13] today
[1:05:15] you notice the the rest of the clothes
[1:05:17] were
[1:05:18] kept in your closet in your drawers but
[1:05:21] you put these on
[1:05:23] you distinctively went this is it this
[1:05:26] is what i'm putting on
[1:05:27] this is some of you ironed
[1:05:30] today and i tell you you didn't go
[1:05:34] to the dirty clothes and just pick out
[1:05:37] something that been there for a week
[1:05:38] underneath the pile
[1:05:42] you have to choose to put on clothes of
[1:05:44] humility
[1:05:46] you have to look at them you see the
[1:05:47] difference this is it this is the right
[1:05:49] clothes
[1:05:50] to wear to put humility on
[1:05:54] it's the only way you'll ever stop the
[1:05:57] devil in your life
[1:05:59] if humility is not there you'll never
[1:06:02] disarm
[1:06:03] the enemy you disarm the enemy by
[1:06:07] being clothed with humility by
[1:06:10] submitting
[1:06:11] not only to the elder but to one another
[1:06:14] in the fear of god the bible says
[1:06:17] when you are humble the enemy won't
[1:06:20] be able to work through you
[1:06:24] when you're proud he's coming he's got
[1:06:26] an open door
[1:06:29] pride is like this i don't mind i'll
[1:06:32] just come right on in
[1:06:36] that's pride is an open door for the
[1:06:38] enemy to work through us
[1:06:40] humble yourselves therefore under the
[1:06:43] mighty hand of god
[1:06:44] that he may exalt you in due
[1:06:47] time
[1:06:51] now if you're in a fight
[1:06:54] of course most of the fights that we get
[1:06:56] into are not physical fights
[1:06:59] they're mental emotional
[1:07:04] arguments
[1:07:08] not too many physical fights
[1:07:13] so you're not gonna get exalted right
[1:07:16] then and there
[1:07:18] right don't look for it there because
[1:07:21] you're not getting exalted until due
[1:07:23] time
[1:07:25] now you're in the playing field of
[1:07:28] humbling yourself before the lord
[1:07:32] god has grace for his children
[1:07:35] but he reserves grace for the right
[1:07:37] conditions
[1:07:39] in due time we need to pray
[1:07:44] that god would
[1:07:48] give us the grace that we need to walk
[1:07:50] humbly before him pay our dues
[1:07:53] be humble in situations that people rise
[1:07:57] up against us
[1:07:58] or a situation rises up against us or
[1:08:02] our bill went up or our tires flat or
[1:08:06] something happened that you don't agree
[1:08:08] with we still must remain
[1:08:10] under the mighty hand of god we must
[1:08:12] humble ourselves
[1:08:14] under the mighty hand of god now when
[1:08:16] we're doing that
[1:08:17] we're disarming the enemy to work
[1:08:20] through us
[1:08:21] we see david's desperation when he asked
[1:08:23] here in psalms
[1:08:24] 13 verse 2. he said how long shall i
[1:08:27] take counsel
[1:08:29] in my soul having sorrow in my heart
[1:08:31] daily
[1:08:32] how long shall my enemy be exalted
[1:08:35] over me how long shall my carnal
[1:08:39] self-will and pride be exalted over me
[1:08:44] to whom you yield yourself servants to
[1:08:46] obey his servant you are
[1:08:49] if you yield your flesh it's only going
[1:08:52] to want its will
[1:08:54] if you yield your heart and your spirit
[1:08:57] to god
[1:08:58] well then you're going to be exalted
[1:09:02] over your flesh psalms 18
[1:09:06] verse 7 17 he delivered me
[1:09:09] from my strong enemy and from them that
[1:09:13] hated me
[1:09:14] how many wants to be delivered from the
[1:09:16] strong enemy inside you
[1:09:18] for they were too strong for me
[1:09:21] it's true we cannot handle those demons
[1:09:24] on our own
[1:09:27] we need jesus he's a strong tower
[1:09:31] the righteous can run into and are safe
[1:09:36] i can't do all things through christ you
[1:09:38] strengtheneth me amen
[1:09:40] all we need to do is trust in the lord
[1:09:42] enough
[1:09:43] to humble yourself and he
[1:09:47] will exalt you over your enemy in due
[1:09:49] time
[1:09:51] now that's scripture
[1:09:54] god wants to exalt you above your flesh
[1:09:57] above your greatest enemy
[1:10:01] not above your outside enemy
[1:10:06] you're supposed to love them
[1:10:09] he doesn't want to exalt you above your
[1:10:12] problem that you're having with some
[1:10:13] other person
[1:10:15] i'm sorry that's not your you're
[1:10:17] supposed to love that person
[1:10:21] that's friendly fire
[1:10:28] he wants you to be exalted
[1:10:31] above the enemy here that's keeping you
[1:10:34] from laying down your life
[1:10:36] from loving those outside you
[1:10:40] he's teaching us this morning how to
[1:10:42] disarm the enemy within
[1:10:44] us and i'll say if you're not having
[1:10:46] that interest
[1:10:48] in really building your relationship
[1:10:50] with christ
[1:10:51] this may be extremely
[1:10:57] unprofitable for you
[1:11:02] but if you can get this you will
[1:11:06] never ever ever need
[1:11:09] have to have somebody helping you all
[1:11:11] the time
[1:11:15] it's learning to take the devil on
[1:11:16] yourself
[1:11:20] we don't want to humble ourselves just
[1:11:22] to god's level now what i mean by that
[1:11:24] is when you're doing your will you've
[1:11:26] exalted yourself against god
[1:11:30] you're being asked to humble yourself
[1:11:32] not humble yourself just to god's level
[1:11:35] to the place you say well i'll do this
[1:11:38] if you do that
[1:11:41] well if i come to church you got to do
[1:11:43] this
[1:11:46] if i pay my time no
[1:11:49] humble yourself under the mighty hand of
[1:11:52] god
[1:11:52] get as low as you can get
[1:11:56] because he's the one that will prosper
[1:11:58] your life he was the one that gives you
[1:12:00] victory he's the one that gives you
[1:12:01] faith over
[1:12:02] demons he's the one that gives you faith
[1:12:06] in the name of jesus
[1:12:10] in the name of jesus demons have to
[1:12:12] leave they have to leave this
[1:12:14] this mind these thoughts this heart this
[1:12:17] this
[1:12:18] preeminence in my nature
[1:12:22] but we have to subject ourselves he
[1:12:24] gives us grace if we humble ourselves
[1:12:26] under the mighty hand of god let him
[1:12:30] guide and direct your path acknowledge
[1:12:32] the lord in all thy ways
[1:12:33] and he promised to direct our paths amen
[1:12:38] our pride literally pushes god away from
[1:12:41] helping
[1:12:42] you and allows the enemy to use you
[1:12:46] how many likes mosquitoes
[1:12:52] good one good call we're all we're all
[1:12:55] with you on this one
[1:12:57] how many users off or has used off
[1:13:01] or some other thing like off to get rid
[1:13:04] of the mosquitoes
[1:13:06] and you read it's supposed to repel
[1:13:09] repel
[1:13:16] our pride can repel god
[1:13:19] humility repels the devil
[1:13:24] he doesn't have a vessel to work through
[1:13:32] lord help me to get through this this is
[1:13:35] so precious
[1:13:37] when you humble yourself the enemy won't
[1:13:39] have
[1:13:40] you to work in all sudden you're in
[1:13:43] victory
[1:13:44] you got joy you got peace
[1:13:47] because the devil isn't there crowning
[1:13:50] you over with depression
[1:13:51] and negativity first peter chapter 5
[1:13:55] verse 7 casting
[1:13:56] all your care upon him for he careth for
[1:14:00] you
[1:14:02] cast all your care upon free care cast
[1:14:04] means to throw upon the lord
[1:14:06] your anxiety your your cares of anxiety
[1:14:09] the cause of anxiety
[1:14:11] your state that your your your the
[1:14:14] depression and the negativity
[1:14:16] that's going in your mind cast it on him
[1:14:20] that word means attitude of excessive
[1:14:24] attentiveness do you got things in your
[1:14:26] life that you have
[1:14:27] excessive attentiveness to
[1:14:32] cast it on the lord cast your cares
[1:14:36] upon the lord david said in psalms 61
[1:14:39] verse 1
[1:14:40] hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer
[1:14:44] from the end of the earth while i cry
[1:14:46] unto thee when my heart
[1:14:48] is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that
[1:14:50] is higher than i
[1:14:52] for thou has been a shelter for me a
[1:14:56] strong tower from my
[1:14:59] from the enemy amen
[1:15:03] he can help us
[1:15:09] cast your cares upon the lord
[1:15:12] psalms 25 1 unto thee
[1:15:16] o lord do i lift up
[1:15:20] my soul
[1:15:24] unto thee o lord
[1:15:27] do i lift up my soul
[1:15:32] oh my god
[1:15:36] i trust in thee
[1:15:40] let me not be ashamed let not my
[1:15:43] enemies triumph over
[1:15:46] me i don't want my flesh triumph over me
[1:15:52] i don't want to have some negative
[1:15:54] attitude
[1:15:55] some i i just
[1:15:59] that's your enemy triumphing over you
[1:16:03] you got to trust in the lord god deliver
[1:16:06] me
[1:16:07] humble yourself from the mighty hand of
[1:16:09] god don't and just
[1:16:10] destroy the ground the ammunition that
[1:16:13] the devil wants to use inside of you
[1:16:16] when the devil comes and he sees that
[1:16:18] there's nothing to work with
[1:16:21] there's just the love of god the
[1:16:23] humility of jesus christ
[1:16:25] all of a sudden he he just goes and sees
[1:16:27] he looks for somebody else
[1:16:31] it's a god's truth he goes and he looks
[1:16:33] for somebody else
[1:16:35] psalms 41 verse 11 by this i know that
[1:16:38] thou favors me
[1:16:41] how many wants to know if you found
[1:16:42] favor with god
[1:16:44] by this i know that thou favorest me
[1:16:48] because my enemy does not triumph
[1:16:51] over me
[1:16:55] when you know that your flesh is
[1:16:58] underneath
[1:17:00] you found favor with god because he
[1:17:02] gives grace
[1:17:03] to the humble if you want more favor
[1:17:07] with god
[1:17:08] humble yourself under the mighty hand of
[1:17:10] god and your
[1:17:11] carnal selfish nature
[1:17:14] and then he will lift you up in due
[1:17:17] season amen
[1:17:20] first peter chapter five verse eight
[1:17:21] going back
[1:17:23] to first peter chapter five be sober
[1:17:26] be vigilant because your adversary the
[1:17:29] devil is a royal line
[1:17:30] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[1:17:36] now the per the people that are not
[1:17:39] going to church
[1:17:42] that don't care about going to church
[1:17:46] that are just doing their own thing
[1:17:50] is he seeking to devour them
[1:17:54] good answer because he already has them
[1:17:59] he's looking for somebody who's not
[1:18:02] totally into their will
[1:18:07] now obviously the devil can't hurt
[1:18:09] everyone according to this scripture
[1:18:12] he's looking he's walking about seeking
[1:18:15] whom he may devour he may not he can't
[1:18:17] devour everybody
[1:18:20] in the devil's pursuit for destruction
[1:18:22] he's seeking out those
[1:18:24] who are not walking humbly
[1:18:27] who are walking in pride who are not
[1:18:30] under the mighty hand of god
[1:18:32] those vessels in which are available
[1:18:35] for his use
[1:18:39] you come to church and you're prayed up
[1:18:40] and you're in the spirit the definitely
[1:18:42] good chance the devil ain't going to use
[1:18:44] you in church
[1:18:45] to disrupt the service but if you come
[1:18:49] in a carnal mindset and
[1:18:50] you haven't humbled yourself before the
[1:18:53] devil can use you
[1:18:58] he's looking for vessels that are open
[1:19:02] for carnality vessels that he can easily
[1:19:06] work through to fight to judge or
[1:19:09] condemn others
[1:19:12] vessels that are living for themselves
[1:19:14] full pride and self-will
[1:19:16] those are vessels in whom he can devour
[1:19:21] that's why we got to keep this flesh
[1:19:23] crucified amen
[1:19:24] that's who he's looking for those are
[1:19:26] whom he may devour
[1:19:30] those whom he has something to work in
[1:19:34] something to work through that's what
[1:19:36] brother branham said a devil
[1:19:38] is almost harmless if he doesn't have
[1:19:42] anybody to work through
[1:19:45] the devils enjoy working in people's
[1:19:48] self-will
[1:19:48] and pride we need to disarm them by
[1:19:51] disarming our self-will
[1:19:53] and disarming our pride now there's
[1:19:55] people that you talk to
[1:19:57] you hear they're just so full of pride
[1:20:00] you can see it a mile away
[1:20:02] you know what i'm talking about you just
[1:20:04] you don't even feel comfortable being
[1:20:05] around them
[1:20:08] and then there's people that are just so
[1:20:10] full of humility
[1:20:12] you just you know they wouldn't do
[1:20:14] anything to hurt you
[1:20:16] and then you got the people that are in
[1:20:17] between that's where we all sit
[1:20:22] and this is where we must learn to
[1:20:23] disarm
[1:20:25] ourselves amen so the enemy
[1:20:29] can be disarmed
[1:20:33] the devil can't touch any of you when
[1:20:35] you're walking in the spirit
[1:20:38] can't touch any of you outside of it
[1:20:40] you're a target the devil can devour you
[1:20:43] he can steal your joy your peace your
[1:20:45] victory
[1:20:47] the devil can devour you when you let
[1:20:50] him
[1:20:50] use you if you don't recognize the
[1:20:54] spirit of your thoughts that are coming
[1:20:55] into your mind
[1:20:57] you're an open door for the devil to
[1:20:58] come in and use you
[1:21:00] if you think every thought that comes in
[1:21:01] your head is okay to think about
[1:21:03] you're you're an easy target for the
[1:21:05] devil
[1:21:07] galatians chapter 5 verse 13 for
[1:21:09] brethren we have been called
[1:21:12] you have been called unto liberty
[1:21:13] humming's been called to liberty
[1:21:15] we've been set free but what is the
[1:21:18] tendency of our flesh
[1:21:20] only not use liberty for an occasion to
[1:21:23] the flesh
[1:21:25] oh i don't have to do that i'm a
[1:21:26] christian god loves me
[1:21:30] only use not liberty for an occasion to
[1:21:32] the flesh but by love
[1:21:34] serve one another for all the laws
[1:21:37] is fulfilled in one word even this thou
[1:21:40] shalt love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:21:43] but if you bite and devour one another
[1:21:47] take he that ye be not consumed one of
[1:21:49] another
[1:21:50] this i say then walk in the spirit and
[1:21:52] you shall not fulfill the lust
[1:21:54] of the flesh when you are biting and
[1:21:57] devouring somebody
[1:21:58] you are letting the devil use your
[1:22:01] vessel
[1:22:03] to devour them
[1:22:07] so just being negative to somebody
[1:22:09] because they're wrong
[1:22:11] doesn't mean you're in the will of god
[1:22:17] if we don't recognize the spirit that's
[1:22:19] using us
[1:22:21] that's hurting us we may not recognize
[1:22:24] the spirit
[1:22:24] in us hurting somebody else
[1:22:28] we got to take care of the territory
[1:22:31] take care of the territory right here
[1:22:35] disarm the enemy by disarming your
[1:22:38] fleshly
[1:22:39] nature your self-will your pride
[1:22:43] anything that comes between you and
[1:22:45] doing the will of god
[1:22:46] live a humble life get humble think
[1:22:49] humble
[1:22:49] walk humble be humble
[1:22:54] and devil will about to use you first
[1:22:56] peter chapter 5 verse 8 be sober be
[1:22:58] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:23:00] devil is a roaring lion
[1:23:01] walketh about seeking whom he may devour
[1:23:04] walk in the spirit be sober be vigilant
[1:23:06] recognize all the spirits that are
[1:23:08] speaking to you
[1:23:09] disarm the enemy by disarming your
[1:23:12] carnality
[1:23:13] don't give the devil a chance to work
[1:23:16] through you not even for a moment
[1:23:18] whom resists steadfast in the faith
[1:23:22] knowing that the same afflictions are
[1:23:24] accomplished in your brethren
[1:23:26] that are in the world in other words
[1:23:29] everything that you're going through
[1:23:31] same thing everybody else is going
[1:23:33] through they're in the greatest battle
[1:23:34] for fault too
[1:23:36] every believer has to deal with the same
[1:23:37] battle the same afflictions the same
[1:23:39] carnality
[1:23:41] james chapter 1 verse 14 but every man
[1:23:43] is tempted
[1:23:45] when he's drawn away of his own lust and
[1:23:47] enticed
[1:23:49] then when lust have conceived it bring
[1:23:51] forth sin and sin when his finish is
[1:23:52] bringing forth death
[1:23:53] the devil knows how to entice us he
[1:23:56] knows how to give you what you want
[1:24:01] we you know the devil isn't somebody
[1:24:03] that just is just a tormentor and keeps
[1:24:06] you up at night
[1:24:09] it's the same dude that gives you what
[1:24:13] you want during the daytime
[1:24:16] it's the same one he'd just beat you up
[1:24:19] at night over it
[1:24:22] detect and disarm the enemy within
[1:24:26] james chapter 4 verse 6 but he giveth
[1:24:29] more grace
[1:24:31] unto the humble wherefore he saith god
[1:24:33] resisted the proud
[1:24:34] but giveth grace to the home submit
[1:24:36] yourselves therefore to god
[1:24:38] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[1:24:40] draw nigh to god he will draw nigh to
[1:24:42] you cleanse your hands you sinners
[1:24:43] purify
[1:24:44] your hearts ye double-minded god is
[1:24:46] presenting us
[1:24:47] how we can disarm the enemy
[1:24:52] we have something to do with a cleansing
[1:24:54] to do
[1:24:55] a purifying to do
[1:24:58] don't the bible says a double-minded man
[1:25:02] is unstable in all his ways
[1:25:07] can you imagine if afterwards
[1:25:11] i said to you we're gonna go right down
[1:25:14] here to um
[1:25:18] oh sorry
[1:25:22] uh just mcdonald's and we're going to
[1:25:25] eat
[1:25:26] i want you to follow me i'm buying about
[1:25:29] three quarters of the way there i say
[1:25:30] you know what
[1:25:31] i want to go up to flint there's a place
[1:25:33] up if i met some place i want to take
[1:25:35] you to and we go up there in mexico
[1:25:36] let's come on up there
[1:25:38] he said okay john changed his mind let's
[1:25:40] understand them
[1:25:41] and i said i get three quarters away
[1:25:42] there and say no i want to go back over
[1:25:44] here to mcdonald's
[1:25:46] and i do that about two or three times
[1:25:50] and you would conclude i need to pray
[1:25:52] for my pastor
[1:25:55] there's something wrong there's a little
[1:25:57] unstableness
[1:25:58] going on in his mind
[1:26:03] you got to cleanse yourself from that
[1:26:04] way of thinking the way it
[1:26:06] the flesh wants to do this the spirit
[1:26:08] wants to do this well as long as i go to
[1:26:10] church as long as i do this
[1:26:11] long as i'm in the message i can go
[1:26:13] ahead and i can do this
[1:26:16] you got to cleanse yourself from that
[1:26:17] thinking
[1:26:19] god is calling us to him sold out to him
[1:26:22] lock stock and barrel
[1:26:24] now we may not all be there but we
[1:26:26] should be pressing towards that mark
[1:26:28] we got to be he's showing us how to
[1:26:32] disarm the enemy
[1:26:33] if you don't give them your brain to
[1:26:35] feed on
[1:26:37] you'll be able to have the victory amen
[1:26:40] people
[1:26:40] struggle in building relationships
[1:26:43] they expect the other party in the
[1:26:46] relationship to do all the heavy lifting
[1:26:48] all the caring to make the relationship
[1:26:50] better
[1:26:52] you know what i'm talking about god
[1:26:55] doesn't do
[1:26:56] one-sided caring relationships
[1:27:00] jesus said if you love me then keep my
[1:27:03] commandments
[1:27:04] he believes on both sides
[1:27:07] if you love me keep my commandments
[1:27:09] humble yourself
[1:27:11] do some of the heavy lifting self-deny
[1:27:15] your flesh just don't do what you want
[1:27:17] to do and expect me to do it all
[1:27:20] so if you want to build your
[1:27:21] relationship with god start lifting
[1:27:24] the load start drawing nigh to god
[1:27:28] start doing the things that he's telling
[1:27:30] you to do don't wait till you feel good
[1:27:32] this is not a feel-good relationship
[1:27:36] there he called his
[1:27:39] his chosen apostles disciples
[1:27:43] they disciplined themselves he didn't
[1:27:46] call him the
[1:27:47] good feeling group
[1:27:50] now how do we do this how do we cleanse
[1:27:53] how do we
[1:27:54] purify how do we take care of a double
[1:27:56] mind be afflicted
[1:27:58] mourn weep let your laughter be turned
[1:28:00] to mourning your joy to heaviness
[1:28:02] humble yourself in the sight of the lord
[1:28:05] and he shall lift you up
[1:28:09] god wants you to do more than just say i
[1:28:12] want to be better
[1:28:16] he wants you to actually put some heart
[1:28:18] into it
[1:28:20] put some heart put some time into it
[1:28:24] there are so many times that we end up
[1:28:26] walking in our flesh and we do not
[1:28:27] detect
[1:28:28] the enemy within us until it's too late
[1:28:32] a lot of times we don't recognize it
[1:28:33] because we're not caring enough to try
[1:28:35] the spirits we think that everything
[1:28:37] that we're thinking is okay
[1:28:38] we think we got to handle we don't need
[1:28:40] god to discern anything
[1:28:41] what we're thinking we know whether it's
[1:28:43] right or wrong
[1:28:45] it's not an hour to be spiritual lazy
[1:28:49] we need to pinch our conscience we are
[1:28:51] living in
[1:28:52] lukewarm laodiceans
[1:28:56] and you may have gotten a victory over
[1:28:58] it but an hour later
[1:29:00] i'm telling you the devil he wants to
[1:29:01] come by talk to you
[1:29:04] we need to stand up as soldiers of the
[1:29:06] cross
[1:29:07] jesus said the flesh is weak but the
[1:29:10] spirit is willing
[1:29:12] we need to feed the white dog
[1:29:15] amen that's right stop feeding the black
[1:29:18] dog
[1:29:21] romans chapter 8 verse 12
[1:29:27] praise the lord now if you get more into
[1:29:31] the word
[1:29:33] you'll the last part won't be so hard
[1:29:36] hurtful
[1:29:41] hey it's it's you know we want victory
[1:29:44] we want to disarm the enemy but the only
[1:29:46] way you can do it
[1:29:47] is disarm your flesh that's the only way
[1:29:52] that's that's what the instructions were
[1:29:54] in the whole bible but it's
[1:29:55] it's really hid from the wise and
[1:29:57] prudent
[1:29:58] you can only go around so long doing
[1:30:00] your own will and then come to church
[1:30:02] and say
[1:30:02] i need the devil cast out of this
[1:30:04] certain situation
[1:30:07] look we're in a walk every day we have a
[1:30:10] chance to
[1:30:11] destroy the devil every day in our lives
[1:30:13] and we need to do it
[1:30:15] amen romans chapter 8 verse 12 therefore
[1:30:18] brethren
[1:30:18] we are debtors not to the flesh
[1:30:22] to live after the flesh for if we live
[1:30:24] after the flesh he shall die
[1:30:28] but if you do through the spirit do
[1:30:30] mortify the deeds of the body shall live
[1:30:31] through the spirit notice
[1:30:33] through the spirit for as many as are
[1:30:34] led by the spirit of god they are the
[1:30:36] sons of god
[1:30:38] for ye have not received the spirit
[1:30:42] of bondage again to fear but you have
[1:30:45] received the spirit of adoption whereby
[1:30:47] we cry abba father
[1:30:50] if you are in the spirit
[1:30:54] being led by the spirit god is leading
[1:30:56] you
[1:30:57] to mortify the deeds of your flesh
[1:31:02] it has to
[1:31:06] and i know it's scary nobody wants to
[1:31:10] die
[1:31:13] but we shouldn't fear
[1:31:17] we should not fear that's what the
[1:31:18] scripture says you have not received the
[1:31:20] spirit of bondage again to fear
[1:31:22] oh i got i got to give up my will i'm
[1:31:24] scared i don't want to do that
[1:31:28] david said yea though i walk through the
[1:31:29] valley of the shadow of death i will
[1:31:31] fear no evil
[1:31:32] for thou art with me thy rod my staff
[1:31:34] comfort me
[1:31:36] this psalm psalms 23 turn with me if you
[1:31:39] would verse one
[1:31:40] this is the psalms really about dying
[1:31:44] out to your flesh
[1:31:46] i know we use a lot to die naturally
[1:31:51] in the natural and i'm okay with that
[1:31:54] but look when you're dead you don't want
[1:32:00] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:32:04] that's what gets us in trouble it's the
[1:32:07] i want
[1:32:09] now notice he the good shepherd
[1:32:12] he maketh me to lie down
[1:32:15] so when the preaching says you need to
[1:32:17] do this
[1:32:19] don't say i don't have to do that all
[1:32:21] you're doing is
[1:32:22] bucking the shepherd because he makes us
[1:32:26] to lie down in green pastures
[1:32:28] he leadeth us besides still waters you
[1:32:30] know
[1:32:32] we just go 50 miles an hour a day go go
[1:32:35] go go come to church and we can't hardly
[1:32:37] stay awake
[1:32:42] he's putting you by still water so you
[1:32:44] can just settle down and get away from
[1:32:46] the hustle bustle of this world
[1:32:48] and connect with him amen he's trying to
[1:32:52] restore
[1:32:53] us amen he restoreth my soul he leadeth
[1:32:56] me in passive righteousness for his
[1:32:58] name's sake
[1:32:59] yea though i walk through the valley of
[1:33:02] the shadow
[1:33:04] of death so when you die out to your
[1:33:07] will
[1:33:08] you're still alive paul said
[1:33:11] yet not i but christ he lives in me
[1:33:15] i'm crucified with christ i've died to
[1:33:19] my will
[1:33:19] just like he forfeited his will
[1:33:23] did not he say if it's possible that
[1:33:26] this cup passed for me
[1:33:27] nevertheless not my will but thy will be
[1:33:29] done
[1:33:31] he walked the same path
[1:33:35] we have to do the same thing no we're
[1:33:38] not going up to a calvary
[1:33:40] but every one of us had the same choice
[1:33:42] whether we're going to die out to our
[1:33:43] flesh
[1:33:44] and live for others just like jesus did
[1:33:47] yea though i walked through the valley
[1:33:49] of the shadow of death i
[1:33:51] will fear no evil
[1:33:54] you have nothing to worry about when
[1:33:56] you've given your will over to god the
[1:33:58] devil can't touch you
[1:34:00] he can't touch you
[1:34:04] did not the prophet say he can't do
[1:34:06] nothing except he gets god's permission
[1:34:08] right is that what the prophet said but
[1:34:12] did you know
[1:34:13] when you yield to the lord the devil can
[1:34:15] do what he wants to do
[1:34:19] to a point because you've given him
[1:34:23] your free more agency look if i want to
[1:34:26] go down the street rob a bank i can do
[1:34:27] that
[1:34:28] i probably get caught because i don't
[1:34:30] know how to do it but i could go in the
[1:34:32] store and
[1:34:33] steal a candy bar come out
[1:34:36] get in my car i got a free candy bar
[1:34:39] i can do it if i want to because i have
[1:34:41] free more agency
[1:34:42] but i will pay the price of that
[1:34:47] when you yield yourself to the devil
[1:34:50] your servant his servant you become
[1:34:55] the devil can touch you when you say i
[1:34:57] want
[1:34:58] i want i want
[1:35:02] the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
[1:35:04] that's the only way you're protected
[1:35:08] you've got to understand when you are in
[1:35:10] the perfect will
[1:35:11] of god you're walking in the spirit
[1:35:13] you're totally
[1:35:14] in him the devil can't touch you
[1:35:21] but eventually he's going to take us
[1:35:24] right death is going to call is that
[1:35:27] right
[1:35:28] eventually amen
[1:35:32] but if you're not walking in christ that
[1:35:35] means you've given the devil territory
[1:35:39] to do what he wants to do now sure he's
[1:35:42] got restrictions
[1:35:46] but you're not off from the devil
[1:35:50] hurting you that's why we get in so much
[1:35:52] trouble
[1:35:55] i don't want to sticker shock you with
[1:35:56] that but it's the truth
[1:36:01] for thou art with me thy rod
[1:36:05] and thy staff they comfort me
[1:36:08] well this is down here on earth because
[1:36:11] up in heaven
[1:36:12] i don't think god will be using
[1:36:15] the rod of correction on the other side
[1:36:19] it's down here
[1:36:24] thou preparest a table before me in the
[1:36:27] presence of my
[1:36:28] enemies you're here in church
[1:36:32] god has presented a table
[1:36:35] in the presence of your enemies he's
[1:36:37] sitting right there
[1:36:39] your will is locked in your body
[1:36:44] he's given you his word
[1:36:48] but you're not afraid
[1:36:52] because you're not yielding to your will
[1:36:56] right in the presence of your enemies of
[1:36:59] your self-will
[1:37:00] of your pride of your your your selfish
[1:37:03] carnal nature god's given you his word
[1:37:07] amen think about it that you can take
[1:37:10] that word
[1:37:11] and you can try up over the enemy
[1:37:16] hallelujah we ought to be the happiest
[1:37:18] people on the planet
[1:37:21] thou anointest my head with the holy
[1:37:24] ghost
[1:37:25] and my cup runeth over
[1:37:30] i wonder
[1:37:34] i wonder who feels the holy ghost
[1:37:40] our cups should be running over amen
[1:37:44] the devil goes to church in us
[1:37:48] the only one that can kick him out is
[1:37:51] you
[1:37:52] did not you hear the prophet say
[1:37:54] hundreds of time
[1:37:56] that devil's allowed to stay there as
[1:37:58] long as you let him there
[1:38:04] you've got to say i'm wrong lord i want
[1:38:06] your way
[1:38:09] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:38:11] me all the days of my life
[1:38:14] and i will dwell in the house of the
[1:38:17] lord
[1:38:17] forever praise the lord thou
[1:38:20] preparest a table before me in the
[1:38:23] presence of my enemies
[1:38:24] psalms 92 verse 11 my eyes shall see my
[1:38:27] desire on my enemy how many wants to see
[1:38:30] your desire on your enemy today
[1:38:33] i want to see him dead
[1:38:37] i can't control what's happening out
[1:38:39] there in the world but i can certainly
[1:38:41] control this right here
[1:38:43] and my ears shall hear my desire of the
[1:38:47] wicked that rise up against me
[1:38:50] the righteous shall flourish like a palm
[1:38:52] tree
[1:38:54] he shall grow like a cedar in leaven
[1:38:56] those that be planted in the house of
[1:38:58] the lord
[1:38:59] shall flourish in the courts of our god
[1:39:03] praise the lord we have a chance when we
[1:39:05] come to god's house
[1:39:07] to really begin to flourish you know you
[1:39:10] can't just
[1:39:11] put water you need fertilizer
[1:39:15] you need some sun you need it all to
[1:39:18] flourish amen
[1:39:19] we need to detect and disarm the
[1:39:21] greatest
[1:39:22] enemy right here how many is working i'm
[1:39:25] disarming
[1:39:26] the enemy within it ain't gonna happen
[1:39:29] on its own and it can happen with a
[1:39:31] wishful
[1:39:32] we've got to surrender to the living
[1:39:33] word of god
[1:39:36] disarm them i can do all things to
[1:39:38] christ who ser

[1:39:42] strength
[1:39:43] to overcome disarm the enemy
[1:39:46] by following the example of
[1:39:50] surrender jesus surrendered did he not
[1:39:55] became obedient he surrendered
[1:39:59] paul surrendered peter surrendered
[1:40:04] we have to surrender we surrender to the
[1:40:07] word of god
[1:40:09] amen turn with me
[1:40:12] our last scripture in revelations
[1:40:14] chapter 12 verse 9.
[1:40:25] detect disarm the greatest
[1:40:29] enemy through
[1:40:33] submitting to the word of god through
[1:40:37] humility
[1:40:39] by humbling yourselves in the sight of
[1:40:41] the lord
[1:40:42] he promised to give us
[1:40:46] victory now our opening scripture he
[1:40:48] that overcometh shall inherit all things
[1:40:50] and
[1:40:51] i will be his god and he shall be my
[1:40:54] son but we have to overcome
[1:40:58] potentially we're his
[1:41:02] but is he that endures to the end
[1:41:06] you know how many people are going to
[1:41:07] come in the last day and say lord i
[1:41:09] thought lord i thought lord i thought
[1:41:12] because they were resting on they told
[1:41:13] me i was the son i believe the scripture
[1:41:16] i believed the quote thought's all i had
[1:41:18] to do
[1:41:19] well what about the one that talks about
[1:41:21] overcoming
[1:41:26] amen revelation chapter 12 verse 9
[1:41:29] and the great dragon was cast out the
[1:41:31] old serpent called the devil
[1:41:33] you want to cast him out amen and satan
[1:41:37] which
[1:41:37] he deceiveth the whole world he was cast
[1:41:40] out to the earth and the angels were
[1:41:41] cast out with him and i heard a
[1:41:43] loud voice saying in heaven now is
[1:41:46] come salvation strength and the kingdom
[1:41:50] of our god
[1:41:51] and the power of his christ for the
[1:41:53] accuser of
[1:41:54] our brethren is cast down
[1:41:58] which accused them before our god
[1:42:02] day and night
[1:42:05] do not let your tongue be used for a
[1:42:08] second
[1:42:10] about somebody else you're letting the
[1:42:14] enemy
[1:42:14] use you
[1:42:18] day and night i love this verse
[1:42:21] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:42:23] the lamb
[1:42:25] by the word of their testimony and they
[1:42:28] love
[1:42:29] not their lives unto the death
[1:42:32] that is the only way you're going to
[1:42:34] overcome the devil
[1:42:36] is disarm yourself
[1:42:39] disarm your carnal nature love
[1:42:42] not your will to the death
[1:42:46] amen god bless you let's stand together
[1:42:52] i wish that this service could have been
[1:42:55] something
[1:42:56] like well i'm gonna just turn this
[1:42:59] button
[1:43:00] and the devil's gonna be out of my life
[1:43:03] [Laughter]
[1:43:06] but i'm gonna say this there would be no
[1:43:08] character
[1:43:14] because as you're denying satan in your
[1:43:16] life
[1:43:18] you're building the character of christ
[1:43:20] it's the only thing we're taking with us
[1:43:21] when we leave remember
[1:43:24] character is not a gift it is a
[1:43:27] victory when we resist
[1:43:31] satan he'll flee now
[1:43:35] i trust i believe with all my heart the
[1:43:38] next service which is destroying
[1:43:40] the enemy within it'll be more
[1:43:44] of you'll find more reasons to say
[1:43:46] hallelujah
[1:43:50] because we want to use the word of god
[1:43:54] the power of god to get him
[1:43:55] out we don't want him just
[1:43:59] disarmed we want him out
[1:44:02] we want to walk in victory amen
[1:44:06] amen without
[1:44:10] him i could do
[1:44:14] nothing
[1:44:18] without him
[1:44:20] i'd surely fail
[1:44:27] without him i
[1:44:30] would be drifting

[2:03:26] amen the thing i
[2:03:30] i love about this series
[2:03:33] for me personal testimony is expose the
[2:03:37] devil
[2:03:38] in me more than i've seen
[2:03:45] it's easy to see the devil in somebody
[2:03:48] easy to detect the wrong spirit or wrong
[2:03:51] attitude
[2:03:53] but can we see him working inside of our
[2:03:56] wants
[2:03:59] and
[2:04:04] we need it to make it and i thought
[2:04:09] if it's blessed me this much it's got to
[2:04:11] bless you
[2:04:14] because really you don't want me
[2:04:18] you want the lord
[2:04:21] any part of me of me
[2:04:25] is evil
[2:04:29] and any part of you is evil
[2:04:34] that's why jesus could say there's none
[2:04:37] good but one
[2:04:38] that's god but when we see jesus and one
[2:04:42] another
[2:04:44] that's worth praising god for amen
[2:04:47] may the lord bless you with joy and
[2:04:50] happiness and
[2:04:52] be with you triumph over your enemy
[2:04:56] keep praising the lord he inhabits the
[2:04:58] praises of his people
[2:05:01] it's okay to get the magnifying glass
[2:05:04] and take a spot as
[2:05:05] brother braham says we come here to find
[2:05:07] out where we're at
[2:05:10] but then you leave it leave it you march
