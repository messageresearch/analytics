we're going to praise him and forever [Music] hallelujah what a what that's the hour that we're looking forward to never have to come back to these pestilence amen god bless you what a wonderful worship service amen it sounds like you brought praise with you the sacrifice of praise sometimes it's a sacrifice you don't feel like it but it's like the it's like the sun is always shining just sometimes the clouds are in the way and you can't see it god is always worthy of praise just sometimes we don't feel like it but he's still worthy of the same praise amen um turn with me if you would into the book of proverbs chapter 29 we're gonna have two scripture readings uh we're certainly missing um part of our our church and i'm so thankful for the live stream that we have and i'm sure they are as well so we just say god bless you to our precious brothers and sisters in your homes may the lord be with you and bless you this evening we certainly miss you wish you were here praying for you amen proverbs chapter 29 just one verse very familiar we'll read a couple of scriptures and then we're going to look to the lord in prayer verse 18 says where there is no vision the people perish but he that keepeth the law happy is he very familiar um i just feel um to be talking about vision for a good quarter of this year anyways because we need the right vision if we're going to move in the right direction amen and in the book of habakkuk if i'm saying that right habakkuk habakkuk i'm is it anybody can pronounce that a little bit better we probably need um exactly chapter two verse number one i if i could just say it like this let's look to the screen up here and read god's word amen verse number one i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i shall answer when i'm reproved and the lord answered me and said write the vision make it plain upon tables that he may run that readeth it for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though at terry wait for it because it will surely come it will not tarry behold my soul behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him but the just shall live by his faith amen let's look to the lord in prayer father we come to you very needy lord without you lord we can't hear the spiritual understanding the revelation that your word is given us in letter form we can understand uh the english language but we cannot understand the heavenly language without you and we pray that you would come tonight and the breaking of the bread of life you said where the carcass is there will the eagles be gathered together and we pray lord that you would give us fresh manna tonight lord that you would help us in these set of scriptures that we've read to uh hear from you how our lives need to be lord we commit the service with all of our needs you heard the requests the unspoken just the things that are on our heart lord we pray that you come and meet those knees as we trust in you we ask these things and give you the praise for them all in jesus precious name amen god bless you may be seated one entitled this message uh living god's vision living god's vision the bible says i will stand upon my watch and set me upon the tower and will watch to see what he will say unto me and what i shall answer when i am reproved i want us to think about this coming into to church and hearing god's word brother branham said that we come to church to find out where we're at with god and it's a similar to what our brother is saying here in the scriptures i will watch i will sit upon my tower i will watch to see what he shall say unto me and then also what i shall answer when i'm reproved now it's kind of hard to come into church uh as that we're questioning where we're at with god because we feel we know where we're at with god and we're we're just looking for some new information or some encouragement or perhaps a little bit of direction but but to better come in and find out where we're really at with god it's it takes a real humble heart to do that amen now it's not just what he speaks to us tonight or every time we come to church but how we're going to answer what he does speak to us because brother brandon says it's not the action that is uh what we're concerned about but the reaction so how are we going to react to what he says to us we can say amen that's the truth or we can say so be it in my life because a lot of times we when we say amen we could just say amen that's the truth that's the bible that's the word right but it it really means so be it so be it god so be it so you're answering uh what god is saying to you like let's make this real in my life lord what you're speaking it's a much stronger uh thought now the world that we're living in is blind they really don't know what's going on jesus said the people living in this age were spiritually blind paul said the god of this evil age has blinded the minds of those who believe not who who choose not to believe the word satan has just blinded their minds it's important that we have first a belief and then second an understanding if there was ever a day that we we need to have a vision this is the day where there's no vision people perish what is a vision is it what brother branham had when he saw things in people's lives well that's certainly a vision those are visions um but it's not the only kind of vision that we can receive of the lord i remember when brother johnson was here and he shared with me on the phone when he was in another state and he had a vision and he saw this woman in white and and and and and said come up to ann arbor and help us that was a real literal vision and so brother brandon had literal visions but that's not the only types of visions when jesus saw the multitude in matthew chapter 9 verse 36 he was moved with compassion on them because they fainted and they were scattered abroad as sheep having no shepherd amen now this vision was a burden for souls that didn't have the leadership of a shepherd no one to guide them people just doing their own thing going their own way not wanting to do what they were told and jesus saw them as a sheep having no shepherd everybody needs a shepherd and thank god that we have the chief shepherd amen but we if we didn't have the leadership under the chief shepherd we still wouldn't get proper leadership and i'll say it like this not all of us have the ability to get down and and hear from god like we should not willing to pay the price sometimes we we drift off and we just we think we got it all together and so god has given us um he chose the foolishness of preaching to save man and he's given us a five-fold ministry for our perfection so we have this is the plan that god has now god can speak to anybody at any time but we must learn uh to to to to be subject to god's to god's ministry amen i believe we should now jesus knew that more laborers were needed in order to help all these people that he's seen notice that here is god in flesh can do anything and he's saying we need to pray that the father he'll send more laborers into the field because he couldn't do it himself that's why he's chosen us and and he told his disciples to pray and we we need to have the same vision that jesus has now when a company has a vision statement it's an anchor point of any strategy plan it outlines what an organization would like to ultimately achieve and also gives purpose to existence of that organization now that's just a natural company helps you keep a focus and not get off track so let's uh apply this spiritually now so we can better understand uh when god gives us a vision it would be the anchor point of god's strategic plan not going to deviate from that right it's what we always have to go back to when we start drifting away it helps us keep purpose and a goal uh consistent for us and when we receive a vision from god it's it's an inspiration from another dimension it comes from a spiritual realm that's just beyond us sometimes we get bad thoughts or bad dreams we've all had them nightmares or even visions that we wish we didn't have and they come also from a spiritual around beyond us so just because we get things from a spiritual realm beyond us it doesn't mean it's all from the lord that's the point that i wanted to say they're not all true revelations from the holy ghost ephesians chapter 6 verse 10 says finally my brethren be strong in the lord and the power of his might and put on the whole armor of god that you may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil for we don't wrestle against one one another against you but against principalities and powers and against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual wickedness in high places and sometimes we deal with things from the enemy we just we get woken up by bad uh thoughts and dreams and so we got to put on the whole armor of god amen wherefore take unto you the whole armor of god that you may be able to withstand end the evil day and having done all to stand what we're living in the end of times the world may think that they're fighting against flesh and blood but it's a a wicked spiritual warfare out there the devil knows he has but a short time he's making havoc on everyone and if there's ever an hour that we need to put on the whole armor of god it's today we need to cast down all reasoning all imaginations we need to bring every thought under subjection to the word make sure we're following the word line by line peter said living soberly watching uh vigilantly because our adversary the devil as a wrong line walketh about seeking whom he may devour let me just ask you a question how many has felt the devil attacking you it's just as real as real can be so we need to have a right vision for our lives the right inspiration our vision must be coming from the right source because the devil wants to trick us the inspiration that we get under is what is leading and directing our lives which way we're going to go so just imagine we went to the bar and we just got all drunk and we couldn't think straight well that inspiration would be leading us to do some crazy things now you get in the prayer room and locked into god get caught up in heavenly places his presence is so strong you're going to be directed in the right way just depends on where the inspiration is coming from we need the right direction for our life our family those that are around us so i'll say it's important for all of us to step back from time to time and take a look are we going the direction that we set out to do was my my statement my commitment that i made with god a year ago am i going in that same direction did i get off track because you need that anchor point the harder situations get the stronger our vision must be amen your anchor point must be as strong as the situation that you're going through in order to carry out the strategic plan things are going easy it's it's quite you don't need much of a vision it's it's easy to go to church it's easy to do all these things that god requires but when the things start happening in your life it becomes much more difficult to stay focused in the fall of 2007 most of us experienced the housing market collapsed my son when he was looking through some of the records he said i don't know how you survived in 2008 2009. he said i never knew it was so bad most of us know the bottom fell out in the economy we went through what i'll say like a mini depression some of them some people call it that it was worse than the depression now of course we were we're in maybe the the food lines like we were then but the collapse of how much it fell back was greater there were 64 318 businesses that filed bankruptcy gm was one of them chrysler descended towards bankruptcy and michigan was hit the worst out of all the the us i believe it was because it it was the center like the hub of the the auto sector that's where we're involved with a great part of it i had no work i had no money i never took a paycheck for an entire year never took a dime from the church i went personally a quarter million dollars in debt just keeping my employees so that i didn't have to lay them was it a one week or a one month scenario this went on for a quite a long time it took me years to recover from this we had a thousand dollar payment for our house and our barn as as you have seen it we owe a lot but we need to come up with a thousand per month minimum and we were doing that for a long time but it obviously got really really hard during this time because i had no money no money came in and the bank pulled our note and demanded more money or they were going to take her home we barely survived paying a thousand dollars a month and now we had to come up with 4 600 a month each month you know what nobody knew about it nobody knew about it i think there was one couple in the church that we told little bits about i think my wife had talked to the sister the reason they didn't know about it because it wasn't part of my vision it was the situation that i was going through it was real but i didn't make it part of my vision my vision was from god we cannot panic be moved by things that are happening in our lives there's no need for it if god be for us who can be against us my vision was god he is my helper this precious brother said to me he said how brother john reacted to this long crisis was an inspiration to me now i'm sharing this testimony because we need to write the vision on the tables of our heart so people read us and they know how to run they know how to walk and i'll be honest with you i i don't believe i have ever gone through a harder time in my life i if there was a time i felt the lord was just carrying me it was that time but i trusted in god to the point that i didn't allow this long crisis to even affect how i was in church how i preached what i said i wouldn't tell anybody because if i talked negatively about it then those around me would end up suffering when god speaks to our hearts we need to capture the vision of god's inspiration amen when we come to church we can't allow the word to just fall on deaf ears jesus told us about four types of heart conditions that the word falls on amen the first condition is called the wayside heart condition it's a very common condition of the believer who comes to church but they're not in the spirit this believer he accepts the word but he can't quite catch the spiritual understanding of the word and the devil comes and he just reasons the word right out of him just not in the spirit just falls by the side just never quite catches it now the second condition is called the stony heart condition this is also a common spiritual condition of a believer who comes to church with hard spots in his heart the whole heart but they're hard spots and these spots can be caused by a number of situations one way as the believer is is he never got mature enough to get his heart softened because remember we all had stony hearts when we come to christ and he promised to put a new heart a new spirit in us and that would be a heart of flesh and that it could he could deal with it so if if a believer doesn't get to that place where his whole heart changes hard spots remain in there another way a hard spot can come is when uh a believer goes through hard situations and and they cause you to to to get upset or to get bothered or or or or maybe to to to to not forgive somebody just something's transpired to where you you just can't quite move forward because this happened and it causes a little hardness there things like this called harsh cause hard spots in our heart now these believers come to church ignoring their stony heart condition they just ignore it in other words it's soft enough in other areas and they just come to church just thinking on that but they're ignoring that part of their relationship is hardened but they come to church they sit in church they hear the preaching of the word and the bible says they say amen praise the lord i believe it and they receive the word that they're hearing with joy and gladness but because of the existing hard spots in their heart there's not enough room for that word that they said amen to to grow and when they go through trials persecutions having to stand for the message having to stand for perfect love for forgiveness for going the second mile for laying down their lives they become offended they can't do it for some reason they won't go through and they basically they're they stumped their growth all because of hard spots bad condition to have when you come to church now the third condition is called the mixed heart condition mixed heart condition we see this spiritual condition in believers who come to church with other desires in their heart and why they should be there they're excited about the word they want to receive it but because their mixed heart condition has other desires they take precedence over the word that that's heard and the devil tricks them to think the word will be preeminent with these other desires but god will never take second place you can't have mixed desires when you come to church it's got to be i'm all for you god i want to want you take everything out of me that isn't of you jesus said the very cares of this life i say that's the normal things that we go through actually choke out the word that we heard in church in other words it really doesn't do its full potential he said the deceitfulness of wanting things riches is one of them choke the word out and they become spiritually gets this unfruitful they can't bear the fruit of the holy ghost when they're going through a trial anymore they may know the word they they better quote it but they become unfruitful in this condition it's a very serious heart condition it can also lead to carnality to just a form of godliness but deny the power of god in their life terrible condition amen about believers just don't realize that god will never take second place so we've got to get everything else out of there matthew chapter 6 verse 24 no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other you cannot serve god and mammon that's uncontrolled longing for gain just to get something out of life don't necessarily have to be money don't necessarily have to be popularity there's something that you can't put in this spot and you're just uncontrolled longing we're either pressing to gain god spiritually or gain naturally it's depends so we don't want to mix anything else in our heart besides god amen or become spiritually unfruitful let's take a look here deuteronomy chapter six verse five just trying to catch this same theme that we can't have a mixed heart condition deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 5 and thou shalt love the lord with all now notice the word all is so important here with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might see you can't mix other things in the heart it's got to be all god and these words which i command thee this day it shall be in thy heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto their children and shall talk of them when they'll sit in that house and they'll walk us by the way and when the lie is down when they'll rise us up and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and shall be in the frontlets between thy eyes and thou shall write them upon the post of the house and on thy gates now naturally you can go by and you can see people put little things on their their homes and their their their house their their their the gates where you enter in um but but that's we we need to put them in this vessel right here people need to see that you love god in this house and it don't matter you're a portable house wherever you're at amen the way that it's being described there it's the most important thing so we can't come to church with a mixed heart condition now the fourth condition that jesus said it's called the good heart condition good heart condition this is a spiritual condition of a believer who comes to church in the absolute best condition he has exercised his heart to believe every word of god his heart is so prepared when he comes to church he can't wait for those doors to be open amen there's something inside i can't wait to get there that's a good condition to be in jesus said that this believer's heart is sincere honest and good something different about this condition than the other three how do we know if our heart is in the best condition or not but jesus said after we receive the word we will have a good spiritual understanding that's the first thing brother branham said that that's the good evidence of the holy ghost is having the right spiritual understanding of the word and brother branham also says that um the bride will know what to do with the word when the bridegroom gives gives her the word so what do we do with the word that's being preached to us we live it right we live it we manifest it that's what the bride is doing and then she keeps bearing more and more and more fruit it doesn't stop the other ones they bear fruit for a time and then it stops but this ground it just keeps bearing it just doesn't stop a carnal believer he will stop bearing fruit but the believer has a good heart condition will continue to bear fruit more and more he just he won't sit still god is against every branch that doesn't bear fruit we're told that in john 15 he just prunes it up but he wants fruit so bad that he'll start trimming things just to get more like he's not satisfied with as much fruit as we're given his attitude is i want to see more out of you so he prunes us even if it's not dead john chapter 15 verse 8 hearing is my father glorified that ye bear much fruit so shall ye be my disciples so you literally have to have a good heart condition to become his disciple are you with me john 15 16. you have not chosen me but i've chosen you and i've ordained you that you should go go you should leave here and bring forth fruit and that your fruit shouldn't stop it should remain that whatsoever you shall ask of the father in my name he may give it to you so there's like a a little clause here that if we want the the benefits that god is wanting us to have we got to continue bearing fruit amen jesus did say by their throats you shall know them we're all bearing fruit that's true luke chapter 8 verse 15 he that receiveth the word in the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word they keep it and they bring forth fruit from what they heard what with patience we just can't you know forget what we're hearing when god gives us the word we got to keep it i mean a good how you know you got a good heart condition you keep the word that you heard amen you're not keeping it i'm sorry you can say you got a good heart all you want but you got to you got to go back to the word the word tells you what kind of heart you have [Music] a good heart condition is when a believer's heart is humble it's honest and it's prepared for the word so when you come into church and you're hearing the word you catch the vision that god has given you you catch the vision god is hid in simplicity but he's also revealed in the same our opening scripture the lord answered me and said write the vision and make it plain upon tables that that he may run that readeth it there's a purpose you need to write this down amen and i'm not talking about a piece of paper i'm talking about write it on your heart amen write it on your heart when the believer writes the vision he makes it plain amen it's important that word says make it plain don't make it complex out of the abundance of the heart the mouse speaketh right i'll say the abundance of the heart we manifest who we are second corinthians chapter three verse one do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some other epistles commendation to you or letters of combination from you in other words we shouldn't need to say something about how great we are we we don't need any kind of confirmation some letter some epistle from you about someone and we don't need uh them from you about you what do we need the life paul is talking to us about a life that everybody sees he said ye are our epistles written in our hearts known and read of all men for as much as ye our manifesty declared to be the epistles of christ ministered by us written not with ink but the spirit of the living god amen not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of the heart so when a believer with a good heart condition here's the word he catches god's vision he his understanding opens he sees the reality of god's strategic plan for his life and he writes the vision in his good heart amen he accepts that word he puts it there it ain't something that goes in one ear and out the other he writes it in there becomes a part of his life and when he writes it he makes it so plain that whoever looks at his life they know what is written amen there's no wishy-washy no maybe so maybe not no up and down or i believe it today and tomorrow it's a question right there's no it's important today and tomorrow it's not as important like you forget it right there's no i've got a revelation of this and not manifest it in your life there's no god told me and then you're not doing it there's no hearing the word in not doing it there's no there's no beholding ourselves in the perfect law of liberty and straightway forgetting what you are you understand it's plain you write a plane there's no confusion in people when they read your life a good heart condition will make it plain in their lives they're anchored they're solid they're laser focused they're faithful first corinthians 15 58 therefore my beloved brethren be ye steadfast unmovable always abounding in the work of the lord for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the lord it's plain in their lives so when a true believer reads their lives they know what to wrong they know how to run when people see you and they they see you going through a a trial they see how you react they say i see jesus and they run to jesus they they want what you got they run to the shores where you're leading them to oh i hope you can catch this if you want people to get saved you got to make it real clear you got to make it real plain that unless they give their heart to jesus christ they're going to hell it's got to be plain it can't be some wishy-washy purgatory thing cut and dry you got to make things plain whatever it is if you really want to help somebody make it plain just be steadfast unmovable for the vision is yet for an appointed time but at the end it shall speak and not lie though let terry wait for it because it shall surely come it will not tarry behold his soul which is lifted up is not upright in him for the just shall live by his faith some books when you read them they're very difficult to follow or even understand you ever get some instructions you just want to put this thing together some instructions and it's like hey look if they were to gave this to me i could have like did a lot better job yeah well other books they're just so easy to read you just pick it up and boom catch it easy to follow but it's no different with believers some are confusing and some are easy to read and god wants us to be plain god is hid in simplicity and he's revealed in the same for a moment let's just think brother mark he's calling on brother my we're gonna say brother bob brother bob goes a month and he says i gave up drink i don't drink next month he's drinking he comes to church everybody knows about it next month so i'm done with drinking i you know next month is drinking a crime see it's a confusing message and when we come to church god is speaking to every single one of us it may not be the same exact thing for every one of us but guaranteed god is speaking to us he wants us to take that word write it here make it plain so everybody that looks at your life they can run with it they know what to do they know who to follow paul said follow me as i follow christ he made it plain if i start preaching something different that ain't you know don't follow me don't run you go back to the original praise the lord we don't want people looking their lives and getting confused i'm going to make it plain we don't want to be displaying a wishy-washy soap opera to people because they're going to perish we're supposed to be leading them to a solid rock the word is a solid rock but unless it's revealed to us personally we cannot become solid so when it's revealed to us we can write it plain we cannot be satisfied with just being a hero of the word we got to put that thing into action and i'll tell you why because soon as we get by this month this year god's got something more for us he doesn't want us just staying in one spot everything you look at in god's nature it's growing it's going it's moving forward and so god has more for us it's up to us to come in and find out what he will say to us and when he speaks write it write it make it plain say i'm accepting this for my life no matter what it is don't wrestle with it you'll you'll make your vision confusing and then people that are watching your life are going to be like this and if we're really trying to bring them to christ to a higher walk in christ to any part of christ we need to remain steadfast solid on it it's okay to get it bad once i once thought this i believe this but i was wrong and god corrected me and i believe to write this now there's nothing absolutely wrong with that but there is something wrong if you keep hopping back and forth and your whole life is like that we god is looking for stability that's why we come to church to really find out where we're at with god and he'll make us more stable every time we come to church if we're willing to take the word on good ground but if we come with different types of ground we're hearing the same word that's establishing one person and it's making another person up and down begin making excuses i don't want my life to be a mystery novel proverbs chapter 7 verse 1. wouldn't it be a blessing to get done before 60 minutes this is a goal of mine proverbs chapter 7 verse 1 my son keep my words and lay up my commandments with thee keep my commandments and live in my law as the apple thine eye bind them upon thy fingers and write them upon the table of thine heart it's not an option if you're going to write it anywhere write it there proverbs chapter 3 verse 1 my son forget not my law but let thine heart keep my commandments for length of days and law life and peace shall i be let not mercy and truth for safety don't don't let them escape but bind them around thy night don't you leave without it don't you go to work without it don't don't you go the store without it don't you go over and text without it or talk to somebody without it but write them upon the tables of thine heart so shall i find favor and good understanding in the sight of god and man trust the lord with all thy heart lead not to understanding in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy path but notice these are talking about what we need to do first we got to do our part first everybody wants leadership of god we everybody wants it and and it isn't like god doesn't want to give it he does but the thing is is it really fair to want it without doing what god wants us to do right i just think it's fair if my dad says i'm gonna buy you a a a a new guitar but you have to be faithful and and take the garbage out and wash the dishes and do your chores it's not right for me to expect the guitar and not do what he's asked me to do i know that's how the world's getting these days which is everything for nothing we want to be an example if god has revealed love to you then love everyone unconditionally if god has revealed faithfulness the importance of faithfulness to you then learn to be faithful it's not a gift you have to learn it you have to struggle you have to go through things you have to repent and say i'm sorry lord you have to get up and do it again if a righteous man falls seven times he'll get back up he'll keep going [Music] if the vision told you to lay down your life for others then make it plain start laying down your life for others if the vision showed you that you are the bride then do what the bride is doing today she is getting ready for her leaving it isn't she's just hanging up holding up a sign that says i'm pride it's all that matters i'm bride he's taking me through how many in laodicea are doing the same thing make it plain make it plain make it plain so he that run so he may run that read of it and somebody looks at your life you don't want them saying oh yeah i guess that's your opinion at the very least when they look at your life they ought to be seeing the same thing every time where there's no vision the people perish you've got to write the vision in your heart you just can't have it up here in your head you just can't quote it you got to write it on the tables of your heart and where there's not a a plain vision in our lives people are not going to run to jesus she's not going to know what to do we're not trying to get them to church right we're trying to get them to to the lord amen amen god bless you let's stand together can i read a quote brother graham said in the message god talked to moses he said oh we're so wishy-washy boneless and helpless spineless as worms i think of the old buddy robinson he got down in the cornfield he said lord if you don't give me the holy ghost when you come back to earth you're going to find a pile of bones laying here i just smiled when you were talking about this in the in the men's meeting if we ever get that sincere he said something's going to happen amen he said lord give me plenty of knowledge in my gable and of my soul let me fight the devil as long as i got a tooth in my mouth then gum him till i die and that's what he did god help me help you to have courage and stand out there god said it's so others are getting it the holy ghost let's go get it it's ours it's god's promise to us we need to be that determined we need to be that determined to take the word that's god's given us don't get offended don't get hurt don't get moved just write it down in your heart and watch god bless you for it god is not only trying to develop us he's trying to use us to bring others to him and the more that we can get filled with him more we can manifest him the more we'll bow to be used by him amen let's sing hold to god's unchanging hand amen is filled with swift transition not of earth on move can stand [Music] build your hopes some things eternal [Music] hold to god's unchanging hand oh to god's unchanging hand hold to god's unchanging hand [Music] fill your hopes and things eternal hold to god's unchanging hand [Music] trust in him who will not leave you [Music] whatsoever years may bring in

holy lean on jesus name [Music] is darkness seems to hide his face i rest on his unchanging grace in every high and stormy gale my anchor [Music] is [Music] is [Music] may i then in him be found [Music] hey man you know what that other ground is the other ground is all the other thoughts we get that are not exactly what the word is saying it's not necessarily what other people are saying to us it's what the enemy sometimes speaks right to our thoughts like what he did to eve in the garden oh you're not going to die all other ground is sinking sand we've got to have confidence when we come into his house we hear the word we stand upon that word even if we don't understand it stand on the word all other ground is sinking sin amen let's look to the lord in a word of prayer amen every head bow just reverent before the lord just hold in your heart that request that you have for the lord god's seizure your heart and your desire at this moment i believe this word that came forth this
