[39:52] five let this mind be in you which was
[39:56] also in Christ Jesus God bless you you
[39:59] may be seated how many feel last Sunday
[40:04] that God did something special last
[40:07] Sunday amen
[40:10] and if it may it it may not be all that
[40:14] uh
[40:16] God uh that you want God to do for you
[40:20] but you know something happened
[40:23] something
[40:24] started and I I just want us to just pay
[40:27] attention attention to the thing that
[40:28] started it because if we continue to do
[40:31] it I believe God will continue to bless
[40:34] us am and then if we could just humble
[40:37] ourselves and seek the Lord more it is
[40:41] that simple God will move supernaturally
[40:43] in our midst amen now this this verse
[40:47] though howy he remembers this verse in
[40:50] our men's meeting amen amen I I know
[40:54] brother brother Bruce does and I told an
[40:57] after the men's meeting I said and I had
[41:00] these notes were already done before I
[41:04] got to church yesterday for our men's
[41:06] and this was our opening scripture this
[41:08] is like the last one that Brother Bruce
[41:11] was sharing with us about we want to
[41:13] entitle this message the mind of Christ
[41:15] and for a subject today um mind
[41:20] control mind control and and I I really
[41:24] want to get to the the punchline here is
[41:26] we can control what happens in our
[41:29] mind let's uh the mind of Christ is
[41:34] truly The Living Word of God in
[41:36] operation amen that's what the mind of
[41:39] Christ is let this mind be in you which
[41:41] was also in Christ Jesus we if we looked
[41:44] at Matthew chapter 4 when the devil came
[41:46] to Jesus we would see the mind of Christ
[41:49] in action that's usually where you see
[41:51] the mind of Christ in action is when
[41:53] there's problems and the devil came and
[41:55] he tempted him and the the devil tempts
[41:59] us with popularity he tempts us to use
[42:02] our power and he he he he he tempts us
[42:05] just to to uh
[42:08] uh to to to bring forth the
[42:11] manifestation of our flesh instead of
[42:14] the word of God and the God is always
[42:18] leading us back to the word to put God
[42:21] first in our lives and don't tempt the
[42:24] Lord and and and live by every word of
[42:26] God when we see this woman that was
[42:28] caught in adultery we see the mind of
[42:31] Christ come out when the the the mind of
[42:34] Satan was in in all these people they
[42:36] were want to judge uh this woman condemn
[42:40] this woman and and the mind of Christ
[42:42] was manifested in Mercy in Grace in
[42:47] love uh Jesus was praying in the garden
[42:50] and uh the devil uh came to him and said
[42:53] you know you don't have to go through
[42:55] with this you can call 12 Legions of
[42:56] eight Angels right
[42:59] now you know God can make another way
[43:02] the father could make another way but
[43:05] Jesus the mind of Christ said not my
[43:08] will but thy will be
[43:12] done they came to Jesus to take him
[43:16] away and he was in the right his
[43:19] disciples didn't do anything
[43:21] wrong and
[43:23] even uh when an ear was cut off of one
[43:26] of the solders Soldiers the great mind
[43:28] of Christ was filled with compassion and
[43:31] love and it wasn't fighting Flesh and
[43:34] Blood the mind of Christ does not fight
[43:36] Flesh and Blood it just picked up that
[43:39] ear and healed it so we understand the
[43:42] mind of Christ is the word of God in
[43:45] operation and the Bible is telling us
[43:47] let this mind be in you which was also
[43:51] in Christ Jesus so let's go back to the
[43:53] beginning of this chapter it says if
[43:55] there be any counsel ation in Christ any
[43:58] comfort of love any Fellowship of the
[44:01] spirit any bows and mercy fulfill ye my
[44:05] joy that you be
[44:07] likeminded so the mind of Christ is full
[44:10] of mercies full bows and and and and
[44:14] fellowship of the spirit and and and
[44:16] comfort of Love fulfill ye my joy that
[44:20] you be like minded having the same love
[44:24] being of one Accord and of one mind it
[44:29] kind of describes what this mind is let
[44:31] nothing be done through
[44:34] Strife vain
[44:36] Glory but in loneliness of Mind think
[44:40] about others talk about others right let
[44:46] uh each esteem the other better than
[44:53] yourself now the mind of Christ just
[44:56] does that
[44:57] it doesn't have
[44:59] to struggle to do that if we struggle
[45:03] and if we have to struggle to do that
[45:05] that really means we don't have the mind
[45:07] of Christ but we're trying to get it are
[45:10] you with me look not every man on his
[45:13] own things so when it's all about you
[45:16] and not about others something is
[45:18] missing
[45:19] there but every man also on the things
[45:22] of other let this mind be in you which
[45:24] was also in Christ Jesus who being in
[45:26] the form of God thought it not robbery
[45:28] to be equal with God but made himself of
[45:30] no reputation and took upon him the form
[45:33] of a servant and was made in the
[45:36] likeness of men and being found in
[45:39] fashion as a man he what what this great
[45:43] aspect God himself he humbled
[45:48] himself and he became obedient now
[45:52] there's the mind of Christ you humble
[45:53] yourself to the word and you begin to
[45:55] obey the word more right you become
[46:00] obedient unto death even the death of
[46:04] the Cross so we have to you know Jesus
[46:06] the first thing he told us is is you got
[46:07] to die out every day deny yourself pick
[46:10] up your cross follow me that's the if
[46:12] we're going to follow God we've got to
[46:13] learn to die out to the flesh because
[46:15] the flesh is enity and and there's where
[46:17] the the Battle
[46:19] Is Now humans in general do not put much
[46:24] interest in the quality of their
[46:26] thinking
[46:28] too often it's not a big deal what they
[46:30] think about uh or how they're even
[46:33] thinking but reality if people don't
[46:36] learn to get control of their mind their
[46:39] minds will control their
[46:41] lives we've heard this before that we
[46:44] need to watch our thoughts they become
[46:46] our
[46:47] words watch our words because they
[46:50] become our actions watch our actions
[46:53] because they become our habits
[46:57] watch our habits they become our
[46:59] character and watch our character they
[47:03] become our destiny Brother Band says our
[47:04] our character is only thing we're taking
[47:06] with
[47:08] us our thoughts even though we don't
[47:11] think there's much to them they lead us
[47:14] to our destiny amen now I've watched
[47:17] people go up and down in their walk all
[47:21] because their
[47:23] mind was in certain things right a
[47:27] person who reads the Bible prays a lot
[47:29] listens to tape I'm going to tell you
[47:32] their mind is a little bit clearer a
[47:34] little bit stronger a little bit more
[47:37] focused but when you get away from that
[47:40] and you're looking thinking reading on
[47:43] other
[47:46] things
[47:48] well spiritually we can go down the
[47:51] tubes pretty
[47:52] fast we've heard it said before a mind
[47:56] is a is a terrible thing to
[47:59] waste uh it has a tremendous amount of
[48:02] power the Mind does I say the mind is a
[48:05] glorious thing that to invest in
[48:08] today but we've got to invest in it if
[48:12] our thoughts are vain they have no
[48:14] purpose they will lead us to kind of a a
[48:16] a a a a wasteland a a No Man's Land a
[48:21] place where things just don't matter
[48:22] what
[48:24] happens if our thoughts have purpose and
[48:27] I'll say God's purpose God's Vision then
[48:30] they will lead us to build our life
[48:32] stronger a healthier and a solid
[48:34] foundation and and we'll have healthy
[48:36] lives because our minds are healthy
[48:40] amen many of us have heard before that
[48:43] our mind is a
[48:46] battlefield anybody ever feel that going
[48:49] on in your mind
[48:51] before crazy stuff going on uncertainty
[48:54] confusion
[48:57] but the Mind itself is neither good or
[49:01] bad it's just simply a plain
[49:04] field and it's important for us to
[49:07] visualize this if we're going to gain
[49:10] control of our minds I want you to think
[49:12] of just a plain field when you're
[49:14] driving by and you see a plain
[49:17] field that's what our minds
[49:20] are you can take that
[49:23] soil and you can plow it up and you can
[49:26] can plant some seed and grow some
[49:29] crops or you can take and build a house
[49:32] on
[49:33] it you can plant a
[49:35] Vineyard you can put up a tall fence and
[49:38] put in a a junkyard bring in lots of
[49:40] cars so
[49:42] cars our minds are a plain field which
[49:46] two forces good and
[49:48] evil they come together and they
[49:54] fight B said in the greatest batt there
[49:57] has to be a place selected and this and
[50:00] the mutual ground a no man's land and
[50:03] they fight here at this place they they
[50:06] just don't one fight over here and one
[50:08] over there and run over over here
[50:10] there's a Battlefront where they meet
[50:12] and test their powers where each Army
[50:15] test its strength against the other Army
[50:18] a mutual uh meeting place now
[50:22] don't
[50:23] miss this I often think about what's
[50:26] happening in
[50:27] Ukraine when you really you know Ukraine
[50:31] in itself it needs all the help from all
[50:33] these other
[50:34] countries and it's like you've got these
[50:37] two Powers meeting together in
[50:40] Ukraine I and I think our minds are like
[50:43] this that you got good and evil coming
[50:46] in here and trying
[50:48] to uh make us to make a decision in the
[50:51] wrong direction that's what the devil's
[50:53] trying to do and God's trying to make us
[50:55] to to make a right direction but brother
[50:57] R said uh now don't miss this when this
[50:59] great battle started on Earth there had
[51:02] to be a mutual meeting place there had
[51:04] to be a place selected for the battle to
[51:06] begin the battle to rage and the
[51:08] Battlegrounds begin in the human mind
[51:10] this is where the battle starts the
[51:12] human mind was chosen for the place of
[51:15] the battle where it was begun and that
[51:18] it's because that decisions are made in
[51:22] the mind the
[51:24] head where you where you got to meet
[51:26] your men enemy is in your mind you've
[51:30] got to make your choice it meets you I
[51:34] want this little girl here that's very
[51:36] sick to be sure she's listening now real
[51:38] close decisions are made in the mind the
[51:40] head this is where Satan meets you and
[51:42] the decisions are because God has made
[51:45] it that way
[51:48] amen you know too often when we're in a
[51:51] battle with another human being we don't
[51:54] realize that the battle is really in our
[51:59] mind but we often think it's with the
[52:02] other
[52:05] person now there is a physical womb and
[52:12] there is a spiritual
[52:14] womb the physical wom is
[52:17] sacred we know that's a woman that she
[52:21] just doesn't let any old thing in there
[52:24] it's it's it's set aside for her husband
[52:26] hband it's a sacred thing and this womb
[52:30] is where seed is taken in and it brings
[52:33] forth the manifestation of what that
[52:35] seed is amen right and a woman who opens
[52:39] up to any other than her husband
[52:41] actually contaminates
[52:43] herself she is considered a woman of ill
[52:46] Fame a harlot a prostitute an immoral
[52:48] woman a woman of low character we've
[52:50] heard all these before amen now the
[52:55] spiritual womb is no different brother
[52:57] bam said in the spoken word is the
[52:59] Original Seed there is a spiritual womb
[53:01] and there's a physical womb and the mind
[53:04] is the womb to the spirit
[53:07] amen I want to say this that that is
[53:11] also
[53:13] sacred our mind is sacred it's it's been
[53:17] set aside only for our spiritual
[53:20] husband a Believer has been taught to
[53:23] think like her husband in other words
[53:26] let this mind be in you which was also
[53:29] in Christ Jesus the wife of Jesus Christ
[53:33] has been taught to only think on pure
[53:36] things it doesn't think evil of its
[53:38] neighbor it's not judgmental it's not
[53:41] critical right Philippians 4:5 tells us
[53:44] finally Brethren whatsoever things are
[53:47] true whatsoever things are honest
[53:50] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[53:52] things are pure whatsoever things are
[53:54] lovely whatsoever things of are good
[53:55] report if there be any any strength any
[53:59] virtue if there be any praise then think
[54:03] on these
[54:05] things now this is what the the womb of
[54:10] our mind or the the the womb of our mind
[54:14] has been made for it has been made
[54:17] strictly for the word of God it hasn't
[54:20] been it isn't for you to to think about
[54:23] whatever you want to think about and
[54:25] watch whatever you want to watch read
[54:26] whatever you want to read talk about
[54:28] what you text whatever you want to do
[54:30] and then expect there be peace in your
[54:32] heart mind it don't work like that you
[54:35] become ill ill affected
[54:38] right and a Christian today who opens up
[54:42] the the womb of their mind to thoughts
[54:44] that are not from her spiritual husband
[54:46] contaminates
[54:49] themselves amen we've set the word of
[54:52] God aside and we take on other thoughts
[54:56] inside what we're doing is we're
[54:59] committing a spiritual act that is wrong
[55:02] it's immoral and I'll say it like this
[55:04] if brother bam said the only sin is
[55:06] unbelief that where does that
[55:10] transpire I mean ye yes unbelief or
[55:14] faith is in our heart but the
[55:16] Battleground is up here
[55:20] Amen brother brandom said in the message
[55:23] the spoken word is the Original Seed he
[55:25] said that's exactly what Eve done with a
[55:29] spiritual intercourse first that came by
[55:33] believing Satan's lie I want you to
[55:35] catch that this terrible act that Eve
[55:38] done it came by believing Satan's lie so
[55:43] how can we just think about whatever we
[55:44] want to think about and it's
[55:47] okay right amen that came by believing
[55:50] Satan's lie into the womb of her
[55:53] mind that polluted her Soul it set death
[55:58] in her soul then the natural act taken
[56:03] place right you know we talk and we
[56:05] think about the you know what happened
[56:07] in the garden and this natural act but
[56:09] I'm telling you the the the tree of
[56:12] knowledge of Good and Evil it happens up
[56:14] here amen we partake of it up here
[56:19] amen and that's how they committed
[56:22] adultery is let some devil spirit in
[56:26] them something against the word of God
[56:30] then she's committed
[56:34] adultery remember when Jesus said
[56:38] it's um whosoever lookth upon a
[56:42] woman the ACT is already committed see
[56:46] it it all happens in the
[56:48] mind now Eve receive he said now you
[56:51] listen to this eve received the wrong
[56:55] seed word it was a seat because it was a
[56:59] thought amen and she received the wrong
[57:04] seed word Satan's lie against Jehovah's
[57:06] word which resulted in death now look
[57:10] what did she do she receed the wrong
[57:12] seed and how did she do it by believing
[57:15] Satan's lie we don't realize how
[57:18] important it is to think on these
[57:22] things we think it's okay to take a
[57:25] little jolly
[57:26] uh little trolley vacation in our mind
[57:31] and just think about whatever we want to
[57:32] think
[57:33] about that's the place that Satan's
[57:36] looking to get
[57:38] in Bible says as a man thinketh in his
[57:42] heart so is
[57:45] he so if you have a a Hate in Your
[57:49] Heart towards
[57:51] somebody that's who you
[57:53] are and if you have a Love in Your Heart
[57:57] amen that's who you
[57:59] are a man is no different than how they
[58:03] think I love this scripture titus5 says
[58:07] unto the pure all things are
[58:11] pure but unto them that are defiled and
[58:15] unbelieving is nothing pure and even
[58:18] their mind and their conscience is
[58:20] defiled their minds have become
[58:22] contaminated in other words even though
[58:24] they're thinking about something that's
[58:26] of a pure subject or uh they're reading
[58:29] the word of God or they're listening to
[58:31] the tape because their mind has been
[58:33] corrupted they allowed the wrong
[58:35] thoughts into their mind they're staring
[58:37] at the same pth word of God with a
[58:41] contaminated mindset
[58:44] amen they profess that they know God but
[58:47] in their Works they deny
[58:50] him so it doesn't matter what you say it
[58:53] matters what you do amen
[58:56] being abominal and
[59:00] disobedient and unto every good work a
[59:07] reprobate all because we have this
[59:11] neutral Battleground that we've allowed
[59:14] wrong thoughts to come into
[59:16] yes but we want to take control of that
[59:20] battleground don't we the mind is
[59:22] neutral it's a neutral Battleground
[59:25] brother B said the mind has been chosen
[59:27] for the battle the mind is neither
[59:29] controlled by God or by Satan or I'll
[59:34] say like this or by Big
[59:37] Brother the mind is a free moral
[59:40] agency in which you have been given
[59:43] control of the
[59:45] Battleground I can't control your mind
[59:47] and you can't control my mind now I can
[59:51] influence
[59:52] you and you can influence me
[59:57] but we ourselves make the final decision
[1:00:01] in our mind what we're going to think on
[1:00:02] what we're going to
[1:00:04] accept now God gave each of us the gift
[1:00:09] to control our minds I like the way to
[1:00:11] say that's it's a gift he gave us that
[1:00:14] gift brother Timothy was battling a
[1:00:17] spirit of fear in his mind with his walk
[1:00:20] with God he was actually embarrassed to
[1:00:24] see how a genuine
[1:00:26] Christian has to suffer so much like it
[1:00:30] shouldn't be that
[1:00:32] way so Paul told Timothy in 2 Timothy
[1:00:36] 1:8 he said be not thou therefore
[1:00:40] ashamed of the testimony of Our Lord nor
[1:00:44] of me his
[1:00:46] prisoner but be a partaker of the
[1:00:50] afflictions of The Gospel According to
[1:00:53] the power of God Amen and in verse seven
[1:00:57] right above it there's the gift of God
[1:01:00] for for God have not given us the spirit
[1:01:02] of fear Timothy but of power and of love
[1:01:08] and of a sound
[1:01:12] mind why would you take a wonderful gift
[1:01:15] like that and then just let the thoughts
[1:01:17] of the devil Harbor inside your
[1:01:24] mind now we've all doubt what spirits of
[1:01:27] fear every one of
[1:01:30] us the Bible tells us the mind of God
[1:01:33] tells us that perfect love cast out all
[1:01:37] fear that's coming in perfect love with
[1:01:40] the word you want to please your your
[1:01:42] spiritual husband you want to please him
[1:01:45] so much you want to think on the right
[1:01:47] things you want to confidence in him
[1:01:49] nothing can separate you from God and
[1:01:52] that love that perfect love for God you
[1:01:56] can stand with boldness on the day of
[1:01:58] judgment because you're so much in unity
[1:02:01] with God and that love for God it will
[1:02:04] cast out all fear
[1:02:07] amen fear don't have to be part of our
[1:02:13] Lives even though God has gifted
[1:02:17] us with a sound mind the devil knows how
[1:02:21] to influence us he knows how to push our
[1:02:24] buttons
[1:02:27] you know we like to say our our spouses
[1:02:29] know how to push our buttons I'm going
[1:02:32] to tell you that's the
[1:02:34] devil it is the devil that
[1:02:38] uses people to push our buttons
[1:02:41] amen that's what I'm saying I am not
[1:02:46] saying the devil is our spouse got to
[1:02:50] make this real
[1:02:53] clear the devil knows how to push our
[1:02:57] buttons he knows how to get us get us to
[1:03:01] adjust our own sale how to distract us
[1:03:04] how to influence the decision making
[1:03:07] that we're doing amen 2 Corinthians
[1:03:10] chapter 11 if we could
[1:03:13] just uh put this up there I don't know
[1:03:15] if I wrote it down 2 Corinthians 11:2
[1:03:17] for I am jealous over you with a Godly
[1:03:22] jealousy for I have espoused you exposed
[1:03:26] you to one
[1:03:28] husband in other words do not give your
[1:03:31] thoughts allow the thoughts of the devil
[1:03:34] into the womb of your mind one husband
[1:03:37] if I've exposed you to one husband that
[1:03:39] I may present you as a Chase virgin to
[1:03:43] Christ God does not want us to entertain
[1:03:46] thoughts from a wrong Spirit just the
[1:03:48] word of
[1:03:50] God but I fear less by any means as the
[1:03:56] serpent beguiled Eve through his
[1:03:59] subtility so your mind should be
[1:04:01] corrupted from the Simplicity that is in
[1:04:07] Christ stay with the
[1:04:11] word just stay with the
[1:04:13] word if the word says be faithful be
[1:04:16] faithful amen if the word says love your
[1:04:20] enemy just love your enemy don't say I
[1:04:22] can't do
[1:04:24] it you're going to call God's word a lie
[1:04:27] the word the word says yet you
[1:04:30] can but the thing is in your flesh you
[1:04:35] can't you you just you just
[1:04:39] surrender surrender I'm sorry Lord I'm
[1:04:44] sorry I give you my heart I give you my
[1:04:47] life I now can do all things through
[1:04:50] Christ who strengtheneth me amen
[1:04:56] Satan wants to corrupt our minds
[1:04:58] contaminate them with just a little
[1:05:01] leaven to leaven the whole
[1:05:03] lump Satan will use any means to corrupt
[1:05:07] our minds to get us to get away from the
[1:05:11] word of God which is the mind of
[1:05:16] Christ all right verse four this is this
[1:05:20] is really it shows us how the devil
[1:05:22] corrupts the the minds of professing Bel
[1:05:25] Believers for if if he that cometh if
[1:05:30] their Spirit cometh preaching another
[1:05:34] Jesus whom we've not preached or if you
[1:05:39] receive another Spirit which you have
[1:05:42] not already received or another gospel
[1:05:47] which you have not already
[1:05:50] accepted ye might well bear with him and
[1:05:55] in other words we have to learn how to
[1:05:58] hold up the standard of the pure word of
[1:06:01] God to a devil who comes in and only
[1:06:04] gives us 90% of the
[1:06:07] word it's that 10% that will lead us
[1:06:10] away from Christ and he won't do it
[1:06:13] overnight a little bit little bit little
[1:06:15] bit before you know it you're not even
[1:06:17] attached to the body of
[1:06:21] Christ amen and then you wonder why is
[1:06:25] it some somebody helping
[1:06:29] me I think it's time for us to fall in
[1:06:32] love with
[1:06:34] Jesus you can't mix the gospel with our
[1:06:37] own
[1:06:38] ideas with church ideas with
[1:06:42] philosophy if we just spend a moment
[1:06:45] considering what the devil has to offer
[1:06:47] us we got a good chance we're going to
[1:06:49] get tricked we're going to let a wrong
[1:06:52] Spirit into our minds look at all the
[1:06:55] different denominations and church
[1:06:57] groups out there all the independent
[1:06:59] groups out
[1:07:01] there I mean there's people who love
[1:07:04] entertaining the idea of another gospel
[1:07:08] a church with more liberal
[1:07:11] views Satan corrupting the minds of them
[1:07:15] that don't believe they'd rather have
[1:07:16] entertainment than be told by God what
[1:07:19] to do to straight their lives
[1:07:23] up you can see how Jesus J is on the
[1:07:26] outside of the church knocking to get
[1:07:29] back in but they don't want the pure
[1:07:33] word 2 Corinthians 4:3 says but if our
[1:07:38] gospel be hid it is hid to them who are
[1:07:46] lost
[1:07:48] ohow you know
[1:07:50] brother brother Bruce said that we need
[1:07:54] Revelation praise God for the revelation
[1:07:56] we have
[1:07:59] amen but we need more Revelation
[1:08:04] right I don't want the truth hid from me
[1:08:08] Amen in whom the God of this world have
[1:08:13] blinded the
[1:08:15] minds of them which don't believe in
[1:08:19] their heart that the word is real for
[1:08:22] them lest the light of the Glorious
[1:08:24] Gospel of Christ who's in the image of
[1:08:27] God should shine upon them for we preach
[1:08:29] not ourselves We Don't Preach our
[1:08:32] opinions but Christ Jesus the Lord and
[1:08:35] ourselves your servants for jesus' sake
[1:08:39] amen for whom for God who commanded the
[1:08:43] light to shine out of Darkness has
[1:08:45] shined into our hearts to give the light
[1:08:47] of the knowledge of the glory of God in
[1:08:49] the face of Jesus Christ this is why we
[1:08:53] need the pure gospel and only the word
[1:08:56] of God it is the mind of Christ we don't
[1:08:59] come here to try to become better
[1:09:10] people I can't go I can't get up in the
[1:09:14] morning without thinking how rotten I
[1:09:17] am I
[1:09:20] can't I'm so glad his mercies are new
[1:09:23] each morning
[1:09:27] the mind is neither controlled by God or
[1:09:30] by Satan hate to say it it's controlled
[1:09:34] by
[1:09:36] you we choose who we're going to listen
[1:09:39] to good to see sister Linda Helms God
[1:09:41] bless you you know worst things could
[1:09:43] have
[1:09:45] happened May God heal your body
[1:09:49] amen now here's the secret to mind
[1:09:52] control it's the same secret to actually
[1:09:55] losing your mind or possessing the mind
[1:09:58] of Christ and it's in Romans chap 6:16 I
[1:10:02] want us to really mark this verse down
[1:10:05] and think about it in the days to come
[1:10:07] Romans 6:16 says know ye not that to
[1:10:10] whom you yield yourselves servants to
[1:10:13] obey his servant ye are to whom you obey
[1:10:18] whether of sin unto death or of
[1:10:21] obedience unto
[1:10:24] righteousness know ye
[1:10:28] not so you take this gift of free more
[1:10:32] agency and if you yield your mind to the
[1:10:35] thoughts of
[1:10:38] God then you will receive the fruit from
[1:10:43] what the thoughts of God gives you you
[1:10:46] will receive the love of God the peace
[1:10:49] of God the joy of God the victory Of God
[1:10:54] because You' yielded your thoughts unto
[1:10:59] God let this mind be in you which was
[1:11:02] also in Christ
[1:11:03] Jesus let in other words it's free more
[1:11:08] agency you got to choose to to to whom
[1:11:11] you yield yourself servant to obey and
[1:11:14] if you take your Freemore agency and
[1:11:16] yield your mind to the thoughts of the
[1:11:19] things of this world the things that are
[1:11:21] contrary to the word of God things that
[1:11:23] are 90% truth and 10% false if you yield
[1:11:27] yourself to those thoughts then you will
[1:11:29] suffer anxiety you will suffer sorrow
[1:11:32] you will suffer depression you will
[1:11:34] suffer self uh self-centeredness and and
[1:11:38] loneliness all because you viewed
[1:11:40] yourself to only a partial truth
[1:11:44] amen know ye not to whom you yield
[1:11:47] yourself servants to obey his servant ye
[1:11:51] are to whom you obey remember it's the
[1:11:54] battle Ground God set that so we don't
[1:11:57] have nothing to do with that that's
[1:11:58] between God and
[1:12:02] Satan so we get all kinds of thoughts
[1:12:04] into our minds and at least one of them
[1:12:08] gets Ed
[1:12:09] to but often we get a pack of thoughts
[1:12:12] and we yield to them it becomes
[1:12:15] confusion we know God is not the author
[1:12:17] of
[1:12:18] confusion but all the thoughts that come
[1:12:20] into our our head they lead us to a
[1:12:22] particular path
[1:12:25] to whom you yield yourselves servants to
[1:12:29] to whom you yield yourself or to whom
[1:12:32] you accept into your mind that is what
[1:12:35] will take you down a particular
[1:12:37] path the thoughts are generated from one
[1:12:41] of two sources we know and we are here
[1:12:44] today in our lives when we take a look
[1:12:47] at a snapshot of our lives today we are
[1:12:50] here because of the choices the
[1:12:52] decisions that we made day has gone
[1:12:59] past if you made the right decisions in
[1:13:01] the past you had you accepted the right
[1:13:03] thoughts into your mind they LED you to
[1:13:06] where you're at today
[1:13:12] amen we have no one to blame for our
[1:13:15] situation than
[1:13:21] ourselves want talk about strongholds
[1:13:23] for a moment they can
[1:13:26] they're
[1:13:28] real now a natural stronghold in the Old
[1:13:32] Testament was a place of fortification a
[1:13:35] fortress a castle a fortified
[1:13:39] City often people become prisoners in
[1:13:43] their own
[1:13:45] mind because they yielded their mind to
[1:13:48] the enemy not because of what happened
[1:13:50] to them I'm
[1:13:53] sorry we all might want to use an excuse
[1:13:57] but there is no excuse God would never
[1:14:00] put anything on you that you could not
[1:14:04] bear but will make a way of Escape but
[1:14:08] look every one of us I'll tell you I I
[1:14:10] was thinking about this other day I
[1:14:11] don't know who I was talking to about it
[1:14:14] but it is the truth uh how many's like
[1:14:17] like smoked or dranked or you know okay
[1:14:21] been been on habits like that when you
[1:14:23] were in the world okay I remember when I
[1:14:25] was smoking and drinking and doing the
[1:14:27] things and listening to all kinds of
[1:14:29] music and had long hair playing my
[1:14:32] guitar and acting like I'm going to be a
[1:14:34] rock star that was one of the things I
[1:14:36] wanted to be when I grew up you
[1:14:38] know I remember every one of those
[1:14:40] things I remember you know taking my my
[1:14:42] first cigarette and how you know I
[1:14:44] wanted to be like my older brother and
[1:14:47] you know it it seems that every habit
[1:14:51] that we've ever gotten into is because
[1:14:54] we made the choice we wanted to do it
[1:14:56] when it
[1:14:58] started the thing is the devil never
[1:15:00] told us it was going to become a habit
[1:15:02] and put a chain on our neck and we won't
[1:15:03] be able to get rid of it when we wanted
[1:15:06] to they become
[1:15:08] strongholds that we've
[1:15:13] started sometimes people get lazy and
[1:15:16] they just think whatever they want to
[1:15:19] think in their mind whatever that comes
[1:15:20] to them they just think about they get
[1:15:23] lazy oh man imagine right now that you
[1:15:26] got this field remember it's your field
[1:15:28] you we talked about at the
[1:15:31] beginning and you just want to go out
[1:15:33] there and you want to sit in this field
[1:15:35] because it's it's got It's got trees
[1:15:37] along the
[1:15:38] perimeter and it's got a nice Sunset and
[1:15:42] the the the grass is beautiful and green
[1:15:45] you just want to go out there and you
[1:15:46] want to spend some time with the Lord
[1:15:49] just look at the beauty of his creation
[1:15:52] Now imagine someone comes with a D
[1:15:56] truck and this dump truck is full of
[1:16:00] poisonous
[1:16:02] snakes and they just want to get them
[1:16:04] off their property and they want to dump
[1:16:06] them on your
[1:16:08] property the devil is looking for
[1:16:11] individuals who allow him to put
[1:16:13] anything he wants to in their
[1:16:16] mind that's what he's looking for that's
[1:16:19] why the Bible says be sober be sober
[1:16:22] minded be vigilant with your thoughts
[1:16:26] because your
[1:16:28] enemy is looking whom he may
[1:16:34] devour people make wrong decisions by
[1:16:37] allowing the wrong thoughts into their
[1:16:38] mind that will always lead them to
[1:16:41] unwanted outcomes in their
[1:16:44] lives sometimes they'll even feel
[1:16:47] trapped
[1:16:49] strongholds I wish I could just get this
[1:16:51] out of my
[1:16:53] head I can't seem to get these thoughts
[1:16:55] out of my head people can get to a place
[1:16:59] in their minds that they feel that
[1:17:01] there's no way out of their
[1:17:04] situation but I'm here to tell you that
[1:17:06] it's just a lie of the
[1:17:09] devil the thing is we've got to believe
[1:17:11] it to start
[1:17:13] with you can't wait for God to just you
[1:17:17] know uh do something with your mind and
[1:17:20] then you're going to believe
[1:17:23] it God created did everything by faith
[1:17:26] we were saved by faith we serve God God
[1:17:28] lives in our heart by faith we will
[1:17:30] overcome by faith we will get a clear
[1:17:33] mind by faith we will get out of our
[1:17:36] situations by
[1:17:38] faith so let's take control of our mind
[1:17:40] second Corinthians chapter 3 verse three
[1:17:43] 2 Corinthians chapter 10 verse3 I mean
[1:17:46] for though we walk in the
[1:17:50] flesh we don't war after the
[1:17:53] flesh as I said before the mind of
[1:17:55] Christ doesn't fight with flesh and
[1:18:00] blood when you see somebody Waring you
[1:18:04] know that's just the
[1:18:07] devil that is just the devil and look
[1:18:11] people don't recognize the devil in
[1:18:13] their life they're very good at
[1:18:14] recognizing the devil in one another's
[1:18:18] life and that's okay that we can
[1:18:20] recognize the devil in one another's
[1:18:22] life that's okay but the thing is if we
[1:18:24] don't get to recognize in the devil
[1:18:26] speaking to
[1:18:28] us for the weapons of our Warfare are
[1:18:32] not
[1:18:33] carnal but they're Mighty through god
[1:18:36] notice through
[1:18:38] God don't try to pull down the
[1:18:41] strongholds all by yourself the Bible
[1:18:44] says submit yourself therefore to God
[1:18:48] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:18:50] you it is through Christ that we get rid
[1:18:52] of the strongholds
[1:18:55] the message wisdom versus faith brother
[1:18:56] Braham said that the strongholds were of
[1:19:00] Satan he knows what he's doing when he
[1:19:03] gives you a thought I'm telling you he's
[1:19:05] got something else more in mind than
[1:19:06] that little
[1:19:08] thought he's got something he's wanting
[1:19:10] to
[1:19:14] build when we yield ourselves to
[1:19:18] God God can pull down every Fortress
[1:19:22] every stronghold everything that seems
[1:19:24] like in possible he can take away every
[1:19:28] problem in our mind every every any
[1:19:31] anxiety any pressure any depression any
[1:19:34] loneliness he can take that fortitude
[1:19:38] city that you just can't seem to get
[1:19:40] over out of your
[1:19:42] mind the bible promises us that God
[1:19:46] would turn our sorrow into
[1:19:51] Joy now I I believe that last Sunday
[1:19:55] I believe that is the path to complete
[1:19:59] freedom is keep seeking the Lord keep
[1:20:03] humbling yourself keep calling upon God
[1:20:06] and God will move if we're too proud uh
[1:20:09] we think we've done enough we don't feel
[1:20:11] like doing it anymore I'm telling you he
[1:20:15] God will just let
[1:20:18] Satan because you made the choice you
[1:20:21] understand
[1:20:23] amen for the weapons of our Warfare
[1:20:26] they're not carnal But Mighty through
[1:20:28] God to the point down a strong casting
[1:20:30] down
[1:20:34] imaginations

[1:21:48] of God I don't alls I need to do is

[1:21:56] against this is the mind of God right

[1:22:03] we exalt ourself above
[1:22:06] this we're actually exalting oursel

[1:25:34] fight or or or or Peter Peter said we
[1:25:37] don't fight against uh flesh and bl that
[1:25:39] is wrong that's Paul uh we we we fight
[1:25:43] against spiritual wickedness that's in
[1:25:46] high places amen that's where the battle
[1:25:49] is it's up here but we're talking
[1:25:53] here and James
[1:25:55] says look don't you
[1:25:58] know that those Wars are within
[1:26:02] you those fightings are within
[1:26:05] you what's happening in here is what
[1:26:08] we're doing out
[1:26:10] here and what has to happen is you have
[1:26:13] to take on the whole armor of God the
[1:26:16] armor goes on the the spiritual man it
[1:26:18] does not go on the flesh it goes on the
[1:26:21] spiritual man it's invisible it's an
[1:26:23] invisible
[1:26:25] armor the mind of
[1:26:28] Christ and we fight we overcome evil
[1:26:31] with good right be not overcomed of evil
[1:26:33] but overcome evil with good why the
[1:26:37] Bible says it's the goodness of God that
[1:26:39] leads man to repentance
[1:26:42] amen it's God's grace and his his Mercy
[1:26:46] towards
[1:26:51] us we got to give more reverence
[1:26:55] to the mind of
[1:26:59] Christ it takes a a huge desire on our
[1:27:03] part to get more of the mind of Christ
[1:27:06] inside of us because we've been so
[1:27:10] programmed by the devil to think about
[1:27:12] what we want to think
[1:27:14] about any old time we want to think
[1:27:16] about it but we need to be more reverent
[1:27:19] to the word we need to be sober we need
[1:27:21] to be vigilant we need to understand
[1:27:23] we're in this spiritual battle it's not
[1:27:26] us the battle the ground is neutral but
[1:27:29] you got these two Spirits white dog
[1:27:31] black dog sit inside they're they're
[1:27:33] Waring against one another which one's
[1:27:35] winning the one you feed the most right
[1:27:37] the one you're yielding to the
[1:27:40] most how many want God to come inside
[1:27:44] and and help at the
[1:27:45] Battle all right let's look at Isaiah
[1:27:48] 66:1 for a second thus sayith the Lord
[1:27:51] the heaven is my Throne the Earth is my
[1:27:54] foot to where is the house that you will
[1:27:57] build on to me how are we going to
[1:28:01] actually do something to get God to come
[1:28:05] by us and say here God I did this for
[1:28:12] you where if he built uh Earth he built
[1:28:19] Heaven he sits in heaven his foot is on
[1:28:23] the Earth
[1:28:25] where is the house that you build me and
[1:28:27] where is the place of my rest where am I
[1:28:29] going to come and sit down and
[1:28:32] say
[1:28:34] okay that's the
[1:28:39] question verse
[1:28:41] two helps us to see for all those things
[1:28:46] have my hands
[1:28:48] made and all those things have been
[1:28:51] sayeth the Lord but to this man
[1:28:54] will I
[1:28:55] look I I I I'm going to find some rest
[1:29:00] in this man I'm going to come into this
[1:29:04] man and take my Abode even to him that
[1:29:09] is
[1:29:10] poor and of a contrite spirit and
[1:29:16] trembleth at the mind of
[1:29:21] God that trembleth at my word reverence
[1:29:26] the word if the thought that's coming
[1:29:29] into you is not of the word then get
[1:29:33] away from it right in other words
[1:29:36] respect the word tremble at God's word
[1:29:40] it's the only way we're going to become
[1:29:42] the word
[1:29:43] amen we've got to yield to God's
[1:29:48] thoughts when we yield to them we'll
[1:29:50] prosper in our minds we'll have
[1:29:52] healthier Minds
[1:29:54] we have a more of a sound
[1:29:56] mind God's thoughts always lead us to
[1:30:01] freedom from our current situations from
[1:30:05] our from our our our our our our I'll
[1:30:09] say sometimes that they horrible
[1:30:10] situations that we're going through that
[1:30:13] we're dealing with amen and we're
[1:30:15] looking for answers but God's thoughts
[1:30:19] they will lead us to Freedom do you
[1:30:21] believe that how many times have we
[1:30:24] heard I've got to stop watching the news
[1:30:26] it's so
[1:30:29] depressing because those thoughts lead
[1:30:32] us in a certain
[1:30:34] direction I got to get this out of my
[1:30:36] mind is bringing me
[1:30:38] down I got to stop listening to that
[1:30:41] stuff it it's just making me so
[1:30:44] anxious so if certain thoughts can bring
[1:30:46] us down I want to say today there are
[1:30:48] certain thoughts that can bring us
[1:30:50] up to whom you yield yourself vant is
[1:30:54] that his servant you are to whom you
[1:30:58] obey God's thoughts as much as this may
[1:31:01] seem boring to you and you don't feel
[1:31:04] like reading it today read
[1:31:07] it read it well I have a hard time
[1:31:11] reading ask somebody to read it to you
[1:31:12] get it on tape listen to it do what you
[1:31:16] got to do because God is not going to
[1:31:18] come and force his thoughts into you
[1:31:21] amen
[1:31:27] when the thoughts of God come to us
[1:31:31] there
[1:31:33] they're they're the
[1:31:36] seed that will start to bring the
[1:31:39] strongholds to break the strongholds in
[1:31:42] our mind now I know we all like the the
[1:31:45] the things of
[1:31:47] uh mighty deliverances and I can stand
[1:31:50] here today God has delivered me I know
[1:31:52] God as a deliverer and so many things in
[1:31:55] my life he has delivered me of in other
[1:31:57] words I could not have done it by myself
[1:32:00] I could not have done it of myself it
[1:32:03] was him that did it and I'm okay with
[1:32:05] that I give him all the glory for it but
[1:32:08] I want you to understand we don't always
[1:32:10] get delivered the way we would like to
[1:32:12] see things delivered sometimes it's one
[1:32:15] day at a
[1:32:18] time God wants us to see us take a step
[1:32:21] towards
[1:32:22] him but God's thoughts will always lead
[1:32:26] us to Freedom his thoughts are good his
[1:32:29] thoughts are are comforting his thoughts
[1:32:31] are healthy his thoughts are victorious
[1:32:34] in Jeremiah 19 you know or 29 verse 11
[1:32:37] for I know the thoughts I think toward
[1:32:39] you sayeth the Lord they are thoughts of
[1:32:41] peace they are not of evil and they're
[1:32:44] to give you an expected think about this
[1:32:47] I am
[1:32:50] evil that's what Jesus said
[1:32:54] and Paul said there's there's there's
[1:32:56] none good there's none that are
[1:32:59] righteous and Jesus said in another
[1:33:01] place you be evil in order to give good
[1:33:03] gifts how much more the heavenly father
[1:33:04] give you the Holy Ghost now God
[1:33:07] knows our
[1:33:09] condition and how bad and rotten we
[1:33:13] are yet his thoughts towards us are
[1:33:16] healthy thoughts there are good thoughts
[1:33:19] amen there are thoughts about I haven't
[1:33:21] expected in for
[1:33:24] brother
[1:33:25] Ben I an expected end for brother Dennis
[1:33:29] I an expected end for brother Roger an
[1:33:32] expected end and and this leads us to
[1:33:37] that End
[1:33:39] Amen but I want you to understand this
[1:33:42] not everyone that saith Lord Lord is
[1:33:44] going
[1:33:49] there the the what's scary about coming
[1:33:53] to
[1:33:54] Church brother R says you never leave
[1:33:56] the
[1:33:58] same you either are drawn closer to God
[1:34:01] or you're further way than you leave and
[1:34:02] it's all determined on one thing that
[1:34:04] Freemore
[1:34:06] agency whether you accept the word and
[1:34:09] you say God I see right now clearly you
[1:34:12] spoke this morning to my heart I know
[1:34:15] what you want me to do and I will start
[1:34:17] walking in that
[1:34:19] direction but if you take it lightly and
[1:34:22] it's just like any other thought that
[1:34:23] comes into your head you don't reverence
[1:34:25] it you don't it's not sacred to you you
[1:34:28] just let any old thought into your head
[1:34:30] I am telling you you may not realize it
[1:34:33] but you're going to be further away from
[1:34:34] God down the road when you need him it
[1:34:35] be harder to get a hold of
[1:34:37] him because God expects reverence amen
[1:34:40] he wants you to tremble at the word
[1:34:46] tremble Jesus said if you continue in my
[1:34:48] word then are you my disciples
[1:34:51] indeed Lord help me is
[1:34:55] is lots of scriptures here yet to go and
[1:34:58] I didn't have many scriptures not as
[1:35:01] many as I usually have there still a
[1:35:05] lot if you continue in my word then are
[1:35:08] you my disciples and you shall know the
[1:35:11] truth and the truth shall make you free
[1:35:15] right so God gives us his word if we
[1:35:19] walk out of here and continue in the
[1:35:20] word that he gave us then we will become
[1:35:23] more free now I'll tell you there's a
[1:35:25] lot of people there's a lot of
[1:35:27] Christians there's a lot of professing
[1:35:29] believers who go to church who are
[1:35:32] entertained and they come out and
[1:35:34] they're just as happy and content as
[1:35:35] could be they think they're so free that
[1:35:39] ain't the freedom I'm talking about the
[1:35:41] freedom I'm talking about is you've been
[1:35:42] set free from
[1:35:44] yourself you no longer have to live for
[1:35:47] yourself you no longer have to your time
[1:35:50] is so precious to you because you've
[1:35:53] given it all to God only thing you want
[1:35:55] to do is make God happy amen that's the
[1:35:58] freedom I'm talking about and if the son
[1:36:01] therefore shall make you free you shall
[1:36:03] be free
[1:36:06] indeed the Bible is filled with the
[1:36:09] thoughts of God expressed to us we need
[1:36:12] to read
[1:36:13] it we need to ponder the
[1:36:17] thoughts if we accept God's word which
[1:36:19] is a
[1:36:20] seed you know when you read the word
[1:36:23] just you understand you get a thought
[1:36:25] from that word when you read it is that
[1:36:26] true you read a book you kind of get a
[1:36:28] story in your mind what's going
[1:36:30] on even up here you're hearing the word
[1:36:34] of God being preached by a man but it's
[1:36:36] coming to you as a thought and that
[1:36:39] thought is a word seed thought and when
[1:36:42] you accept that word seed into the womb
[1:36:45] of your
[1:36:46] mind that is what brings the seed in you
[1:36:51] say yes I believe it it and you believe
[1:36:53] it to the point now not intellectually
[1:36:57] but you believe it to the point that it
[1:36:58] comes into your heart and you say God I
[1:37:00] love your word I want to do this word I
[1:37:03] want to do what you're telling me to do
[1:37:05] it will bring forth the life of the
[1:37:10] word it'll lead you to joy and
[1:37:13] happiness it'll be no problem living for
[1:37:19] others not everybody that hears the word
[1:37:23] receives the
[1:37:24] word Hebrews 4:2 you want to write it
[1:37:28] down Hebrews 21: 1 through3 if you want
[1:37:32] to write it
[1:37:33] down you've got to mix the word with a
[1:37:37] faith okay for a moment let's say that
[1:37:40] our minds are all tore up in
[1:37:43] life we're plagued with a mixture of
[1:37:46] fear and
[1:37:48] anxiety we're feeling frustrated we're
[1:37:51] in a state of confusion we're we're
[1:37:53] we're left alone feeling like nobody
[1:37:57] cares and nobody
[1:38:00] understands maybe we feel like we're in
[1:38:03] a prison in our minds and there's
[1:38:05] padlocks on the door I feel like I could
[1:38:09] I could write a
[1:38:11] [Laughter]
[1:38:14] song have you ever been
[1:38:20] there but the Bible tells us is Exodus
[1:38:24] 15:26 for I am the Lord that Health
[1:38:27] Thee the thoughts of God are expressed
[1:38:30] in his word Isaiah 26:3 says he will
[1:38:34] keep us in perfect peace whose mind is
[1:38:37] stayed on the Lord because he trusteth
[1:38:39] in thee so it doesn't matter how mixed
[1:38:43] up the mind is no matter what you're
[1:38:45] feeling what you're going through you do
[1:38:47] not need the circumstance
[1:38:50] fixed come on now you do not need the
[1:38:53] circumstance fixed what you need is the
[1:38:56] peace of God in your
[1:38:58] heart circumstance can be twice as worse
[1:39:01] the next day but if you've got
[1:39:04] peace he will keep you in that time of
[1:39:08] trial all you got to do is learn to
[1:39:11] trust the Lord more amen God's word is a
[1:39:14] seed its purpose is to be planted in our
[1:39:19] heart through the womb of our mind and
[1:39:22] to prosper
[1:39:25] travels to our minds in the form of a
[1:39:29] thought if we accept it to the point
[1:39:31] that we yield to it to whom you yield
[1:39:33] yourself servants to be his servant you
[1:39:35] are so if you start obeying that word
[1:39:38] how do you obey that word oh
[1:39:40] um Lord I just got distracted I just
[1:39:43] Lord thank you I'm just going to spend
[1:39:45] some time reading it just doesn't seem
[1:39:47] to be enough the thoughts are still
[1:39:48] coming I can't I'm going to put a tape
[1:39:51] on tape but you know thoughts you know
[1:39:53] I'm going to spend some time
[1:39:55] praying and you're actually obeying what
[1:39:58] the word says you're forcing yourself to
[1:40:00] keep your mind State on the Lord I am
[1:40:02] telling you God will reward you with
[1:40:05] peace as sure as anything because God is
[1:40:08] a deliver but if you don't want to pay
[1:40:11] the price and you want to allow any
[1:40:12] thought to come into your head tell me
[1:40:14] how can you be a soldier as a witness
[1:40:17] for Jesus Christ and stand there and say
[1:40:19] look at me follow me Paul said follow me
[1:40:22] as I follow Christ
[1:40:26] amen it's time that we get serious with
[1:40:29] this
[1:40:31] word
[1:40:35] serious when we follow God's word we
[1:40:37] Prosper am when we follow any other
[1:40:44] thought it'll show up down the
[1:40:48] road I love 2 Chronicles 2020
[1:40:55] because a lot of people you know they
[1:41:00] think they
[1:41:03] believe right they think they believe
[1:41:05] that but the devil
[1:41:06] believes they think they're
[1:41:09] established hey I think the devil's
[1:41:13] established
[1:41:15] right Satan doesn't cast out Satan his
[1:41:18] kingdom would be divided and they Rose
[1:41:20] early in the morning went forth to the
[1:41:23] church chur in Fenton Michigan and as
[1:41:25] they went jehos stood and said hear me
[1:41:28] oh
[1:41:29] Judea Judah I'm sorry and ye habitants
[1:41:32] of Jerusalem believe in the Lord your
[1:41:35] God so shall you be
[1:41:40] established I don't know what that means
[1:41:42] to
[1:41:46] you but I can guarantee next Wednesday
[1:41:51] or Sunday whenever you come to church
[1:41:52] next time this foundation and this
[1:41:56] building isn't going to be over
[1:41:59] there it it is established
[1:42:04] here a Christian when you think of a
[1:42:08] Christian established
[1:42:11] Christian is the same
[1:42:16] yes and if if you're going to have a
[1:42:19] weak mind and always you're going to say
[1:42:22] well at least I come to church once in a
[1:42:24] while that's better than my so and so my
[1:42:27] friend does that's not an established
[1:42:30] Christian if you're going to compare
[1:42:32] yourself with anybody else that is not
[1:42:37] wise you got to establish yourself with
[1:42:40] with the word we we got Paul as an
[1:42:43] example we we we got Christ as an
[1:42:46] example we got the dis the the disciples
[1:42:50] we we've got the God sent a a wave sheep
[1:42:53] in this in this hour to let us know what
[1:42:55] kind of life we need to be living you
[1:42:58] can fool some of the people some of the
[1:42:59] time but you can't fool all the people
[1:43:01] all the time we need to get more serious
[1:43:03] with the word of God and believe in the
[1:43:07] Lord your God so shall you be
[1:43:10] established Believe In His
[1:43:13] prophets so shall ye
[1:43:16] Prosper well I'll tell you I want the
[1:43:18] word of God just bubbling up inside of
[1:43:21] me I I want to be prospering spiritually
[1:43:25] that's what I want
[1:43:27] amen all right Isaiah 55:6 seek ye the
[1:43:30] Lord while he may be found call upon him
[1:43:33] while he is near let the wicked forsake
[1:43:37] his way and the unrighteous man his
[1:43:42] thoughts that came from the devil that
[1:43:45] started from the devil and let him
[1:43:48] return unto the
[1:43:49] Lord and He will have mercy upon him and
[1:43:53] our and to our God for he will
[1:43:55] abundantly pardon for my thoughts are
[1:43:58] not your thoughts neither are your ways
[1:44:01] my ways sayeth the Lord for as the
[1:44:03] heavens are higher than the earth so are
[1:44:05] my ways higher than your ways amen wow I
[1:44:12] know if I don't get this down my sweet
[1:44:14] wife will
[1:44:18] um we share the information with me
[1:44:20] after the service
[1:44:23] but I never realize it's hot or cold
[1:44:25] till it gets to an extreme and it's it's
[1:44:27] a little bit warm right
[1:44:28] now for as the heavens are higher than
[1:44:31] the earth so are my ways higher than
[1:44:33] your ways and my thoughts than your
[1:44:37] thoughts but this is what I love about
[1:44:40] God's thoughts verse 11
[1:44:45] so so shall my word which basically is a
[1:44:49] thought expressed right be that gold
[1:44:53] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:44:55] return unto me void but it shall
[1:44:57] accomplish that which I please and it
[1:45:00] shall prosper in the thing wherein to I
[1:45:03] sent it so I say today if we're here
[1:45:06] today and we hear God speak to us it is
[1:45:10] a beautiful thing because the reason
[1:45:12] that he has spoken is because he wants
[1:45:15] his word to prosper in our
[1:45:20] lives let's Stand Together
[1:45:23] let's take better control of our mind
[1:45:26] amen by letting the mind that was in
[1:45:30] Christ be in US
[1:45:33] amen you have the final say so you have
[1:45:36] control what goes in your
[1:45:38] mind make a commitment to God that
[1:45:41] you're going to be more
[1:45:43] Vigilant you're not just going to allow
[1:45:46] thoughts even though even though they're
[1:45:48] true they may not be pure may not be a
[1:45:52] good report right so the devil's kind of
[1:45:55] tricky make sure it passes the test amen
[1:46:00] yes let's sing without him I could do
[1:46:06] [Music]
[1:46:10] nothing
[1:46:12] without him I could do
[1:46:19] nothing
[1:46:21] without him might surely
[1:46:27] fail
[1:46:29] without him I would be
[1:46:36] drifting like a
[1:46:38] ship
[1:46:40] without a
[1:46:44] s
[1:46:46] [Music]
[1:46:48] Jus oh

[1:51:12] there's someone
[1:51:15] that's says brother
[1:51:18] John I'm serious about this message that
[1:51:21] I heard today
[1:51:24] I know it's true but
[1:51:28] today I want to start activating the
[1:51:30] word of God in my
[1:51:32] life I believe God sent this message I
[1:51:36] know part of the reason that God sent
[1:51:39] this message I know it was for everybody
[1:51:41] but I I really believe this message was
[1:51:43] for me to
[1:51:47] follow and I'll just say if if that's
[1:51:50] how you
[1:51:51] feel and this this is not for everybody
[1:51:53] if that but that's how you feel I want
[1:51:55] you to come forward and I want to pray
[1:51:58] with you here I want to pray right with
[1:52:00] you here because if you feel that you
[1:52:03] really mean business with
[1:52:05] God I believe God wants to God wants to
[1:52:10] bless us I believe
[1:52:14] that God said that he would do excedy
[1:52:17] above all that we could ask or even
[1:52:19] think
[1:52:25] God don't want to waste our
[1:52:29] time God loves
[1:52:32] us now look I'm I'm telling you today

[1:52:38] that comes into your
[1:52:41] head you have control of your mind and
[1:52:45] we're going to pray today that we're
[1:52:48] going to harness that

[1:52:56] Christ right we're looking to him in
