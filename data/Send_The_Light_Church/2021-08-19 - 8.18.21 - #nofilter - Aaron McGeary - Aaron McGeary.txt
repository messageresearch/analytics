just more of you yes more of things i've had my fear and yet i understand [Music] praise the lord thank you brother mark amen let's stand together how many is excited about being in church not understand there's not a whole lot here but i was looking forward to coming to church and then when i heard that brother aaron was going to be preaching i got more excited and i'm sorry that it wasn't announced but to be honest with you we just had had contact and i i heard that he didn't get a lot of breaks and i wasn't sure whether he'd be rather not minister and i didn't want to put any pressure didn't want to make announcement didn't want to say i already told the people i just kind of kept praying lord let it be lord let it be and i just want to say that the way that he expressed it that he wanted to just give me a break that just was like saying i love you in a you know in a real personal gospel way if i could say it like that and it just meant so much the way that he said it he said it's a given and i told him we need his ministry we we've we've missed it and i'm just thankful that he has a heart to want it to give and um to be a blessing to us so i i'm sure some of you been praying that it would happen and um let's just all get behind the word i know there's only a few of us here but i believe that there's so many they're going to be watching it and um let's just receive the living word amen uh tonight because i believe it's for us it's for our little group here amen let's sing only believes brother aaron comes to minister the word of life to us [Music] all things are possible only believe oh [Music] things are possible only believe jesus is here jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here jesus is here jesus is here all things are possible jesus is here praise the lord amen i believe that with all my heart jesus is here i'm going to be reading from romans chapter 12 in first corinthians chapter 12. so while you just kind of get you ready to turn to those places romans 12 and 1st corinthians 12. it's a blessing to be here this evening be together with you and see you out to the house the lord and it's nice to see um different ones stepping into positions and helping out and relieving others and assisting whether it be on the sound in the video or in song leading brother mark leading songs i think that's wonderful that god opens up those opportunities you know i thought about it if we all went to the same church just think of how many gifts would uh not be exercised and have opportunities to be used just because there's only so many different you know spots so many different places and so it's wonderful that god provides uh bodies of christ all around the world to use gifts and to cultivate them and we really meant it in our hearts we actually didn't even we didn't even bring a suit or anything like that because you know we were kind of thinking that maybe we would come and not be and not have to preach um but it really was in our hearts to give brother john the break we know he works um full-time over time just as a in his shop there and then also as a pastor he takes probably just about every single service so we wanted to it's been what we've been doing for over 20 years now as a matter of fact this past monday was it was the 20th anniversary of 21st and our 20th anniversary of meeting elizabeth that's the way i look at it and uh so we ended up preaching that night too but um we uh been coming for a long time a couple decades and we've always felt in the heart that we were happy to help people say oh great you're going on vacation i was like well i'm preaching every service while i'm gone but uh we were happy to do it even though now where we are we preach every service so we're like 100 services in a row or something like that but just the opportunity to preach here i consider it a a nice uh a break in itself and a great privilege to be here so we're really really happy to be here and to minister the lord really dealt uniquely with our hearts so we'll just share with what's in our in our hearts with you we'll read from romans chapter 12. i'd like to read verses 4 5 and 6. it says for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and every one members one of another having then gifts differing according to the grace that is given to us it's all the same grace that's given to us but the gifts differ according to the grace that's been given whether prophecy let us prophesy according to the proportion of faith and then he continues on the different gifts but the idea is that we're all part of one body we've all received grace and different proportions of that depending on the gift and then first corinthians chapter 12 verses 20 to 24 this is paul then looking at the body in a little bit different perspective romans chapter excuse me first corinthians chapter 12 verses 20 to 24 but now are they many members yet but one body and the eye cannot say unto the hand i have no need of thee nor again the head to the feet i have no need of you name much more of those members of the body which seem to be more feeble are necessary so he's talking about perception or judgment or value well it seems to be less more feeble or doesn't seem to be as strong as something else he says which seem to be more feeble are necessary and those members of the body which we think to be less honorable upon those we bestow mo bestow more abundant honor and our uncomely parts have more abundant comeliness for our comely parts have no need but god hath tempered the body together having given more abundant honor to the part that part which lacked amen let's just power heads in a word of prayer heavenly father we ask that you'd take these things that you've shared the burden that's been placed upon my heart and would you deliver it lord to the people that are gathered here those that stream having to take certain precautions or whatever the need may be that's kept them from being here lord we're grateful that they have an opportunity to stream or to archive we just pray that it would meet the target and that could only be done lord if we open up our hearts to receive from you and myself lord just open up my heart to be used by you and may each person now just take it upon themselves to pull to be attentive and to even strain lord and strive to hear your voice and to hear what you might be speaking to them we commit this to you in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen you may be seated i have a a unique um title for tonight but as we were looking at paul in romans chapter 12 talking about the body and eat the body haven't been given um having different members and those members now having been given grace so every member is a recipient of grace but then they're being different ministries as that's been given out and he talks about different ministries that are within the body so you can all be a member within one body but have different roles and different different requirements and expectations of you and then in first corinthians chapter 12 he begins to talk about how there's some that seem to be more feeble within the body or some that we think to be less honorable or the uncomely parts and he's talking about our perception and how we perceive things and in doing he's talking about you know he's really addressing that um our perception and well you look at some to say well this is a weaker thing or this one and he's actually dealing with our value judgment like well this one's not as necessary as another part and in doing that he's talking about what we see and then the thought process we have behind it and so you know this might uh there might only be one person here who can even get my title and that's hashtag no filter and it might be brother marks i'm glad he's on the front row because i've i've noticed uh maybe i'll just share a little bit of my heart i've been ministering on a series over a number of weeks at the church in arizona and it was on in the beginning god created a family and it was took in the beginning god created and then a family we're looking at god's image of a family brother bam talked about a true family and he talks about how true family is everyone's in harmony and everything's in order and the husband and wife are on the same page and you read this picture he talks about this picture of god and how true family is a portrait of god and you you could read that immediately begin to think well i guess we'll never be a true family and you kind of start thinking well i guess it'll never work for us and a lot of times it's only because this pressure this expectation we begin to put on ourselves and i really sensed um just even people getting tense and getting nervous when you get begin to talk about certain issues you preach about holiness you know certain people start getting complexes or you you start talking about certain standards you preach about tithes and offerings and everybody starts getting really nervous and a lot of times it's just our perception of things it's how we view things it's kind of our what we think everybody else is thinking and the value system and god dealt with my heart to uh look at the subject of no filter from the standpoint of removing any filters or any any preconceived ideas that we might have that hinder us from seeing the true word of god and ultimately from being the true word of god from really just expressing the word as it ought to be expressed and so is our title is no filter we have this hashtag it's hashtag no filter and what i'm doing basically is utilizing a social media tool to address um our conception of church how we perceive church our concept of church and also our concept of family and even our personal testimony as we we test we believe in our hearts to be a christian we want to have this profession of being a christian and how sometimes we feel that we've got to present ourself in a certain way to maintain that testimony so the kind of pressure is to have a particular image or to line up with something that we've seen within an example before us or somebody else that we admire as a christian and a hashtag and we might say pound it might look like pound no filter but it's a hashtag um it's a label for content if you're posting something in a form or posting something uh on twitter or even instagram in different places and i'll probably deal with instagram more than others other platforms tonight but if you hashtag something it allows you to search for it more easily it can connect you to certain topics and so if you wanted to you wanted to tweet about how good your pizza was last night you might tweet and say you know hippos has got great pizza hashtag fenton hippos hashtag pizza or something like that and it gives people who want to follow those tags and follow those subjects it kind of brings it calls attention to it it's a way of organizing thoughts or promoting certain ideals so you begin to understand what a hashtag no filter might be and so in using uh what a hashtag might be and using this one no filter i i'm just i the way it was dealt with my heart was to address certain expectations and pressures that we have an expectation that we might have with respect to certain standards of pressure that we might feel and perceptions when it comes to what if what a family true family should look like and then also by extension just by the pressures and expectations our perception of what a church should look like how church should be operated what it should look like and what kind of building it should have or uh what kind of people it should have in it or how when it should have service and how long service service should be there's a lot of different ways that we have filter what we're seeing and even filter our perception of things and we kind of put this pressure on ourselves in doing it we say well a christian ought to be a certain way and so we feel like well if we don't line up to that we get complexes or we think well a christian ought to be a certain way and so we pretend to be that way so it's kind of addressing complexes and addressing pretense because we shouldn't just get in our mind what church should look like what a believer should look like and just pretend to be that and say well i want to look like a believer so i'm going to do this and i want to look like a christian so i'm going to do that and so this hashtag no filter that we're using here is uh it really became extremely popular it's very a very common hashtag but it came very very popular on instagram and it was used to kind of signal to the people who are viewing your post that the picture here hasn't been altered in any way like this is pure this is raw it's unedited there's no filter on it there's no visual enhancement we haven't put these different layers on it to make the sunset look more radiant we haven't made the sky look more blue uh we haven't done anything to this to uh you know i wish i had a filter on my body so that i looked slimmer in pictures especially when they choose to stand right by you at a table and they do the table shot you know don't be bold enough to say no go around go the other side because that's what i do now they're going to stand if i'm sitting here and they want me to be looking like this and the camera's going right here i know what i'm going to look like by forced perspective i'm looking exponentially larger than how big i already am so i'll say no no you go over there take it from over there i don't care who's sitting over there because i realize by this perception i could be perceived to be even bigger than i really am and so this is how people will take a picture and then it's not good enough just the way that it looks you have to add filters to it and change it and crop it and and photoshop it might be a word that we might be more familiar with in order for it to look more engaging and all of us on our phones now you take a picture what do you do you immediately go to edit and you choose enhance right you want a dynamic or cool or a hipster filter or something like that because you want it to you want it to look more engaging and so i want to talk about this concept and do so maybe just get us to think about certain things in our minds but my point really my burden behind it is just so that we could be honest with ourselves about how we all have struggles right true as as individuals we have struggles as families things aren't always in harmony as churches we go through difficult things and we have challenges and we have struggles and really just to be honest about the realities of life and in doing so we don't put pressure on ourselves we already have a very high standard that we're the holy ghost is leading us to and we put pressure on ourselves because we want to look the part we want to fit in we don't want to be ostracized and we're really putting a lot of pressure on ourselves or we can put pressure on other people and so really my goal in looking at this subject is to encourage you uh not discourage you but just to encourage you and to get us to consider how many times we're putting pressure on ourselves to conform to a carnal image that we hear something and we get this idea in our mind this is what it should look like and and really try to alleviate that pressure that we're putting ourselves so that we can just trust god more and just follow his inspiration follow his leading so kind of by using this hashtag no filter really inspiring you to be genuine inspiring you to be honest i did what this is me this is who i am i i feel like i can be myself and in being myself you know who i am you know where i'm at and it gives an opportunity for iron to sharpen iron it gives an opportunity to pray for one another and it gives us an opportunity to grow in christ and have testimonies uh people see a change in you and they see your attitude if you're always just playing the part and doing really good one day you want to testify so god did a great thing in my life i i used to be i used to be this way but you know god's changed me and i'm a real christian say well you really faked it good for 30 years right because you're just putting on putting on an act but we want to inspire you to be genuine and honest but it also really inspire you to strive to be better as christians be better christians to be better as a family to be better as a church and i thought this might be a good place to start just to get us thinking about perception and this idea of no filter here you have i don't know if this yeah i don't think that would work but i'm so i'm close enough just to point but here's a family picture how many love family pictures really all the sisters saying amen brother oh brother marty likes family pictures you're blessed sister kathleen your husband loves family pictures that's a rarity you're a unicorn is what they'd call you it just doesn't come around often um elliot looks like he's got something on his chin i don't remember that in the original but um this looks it looks nice right i didn't plan the green gingham to match uh match the photos here but everything looks really nice and pretty but we've all done family pictures before it's chaos it's ear twisting it's bribing with candy it's weeks of shopping it's trying on this and trying on that and you hike up a mountain to find the perfect spot and everyone's all dusty and dirty and you're asking the photographer the whole time you can photoshop that out right you can photoshop that out and i thought they're going to do more with my head than make it a beacon of light there but i wanted a little bit more hair on top but this is what we get as far as the final picture but really this is what it looks like right jack has tried missed his nose and it's picking between his eyes preston's got something in his mouth eliza is about to bite her tongue off elliot is missing i'm looking at something with the weird look on my face face elizabeth does not look happy look how close the prickly pear is this is a dangerous situation and this is you know jack's picture perfect right all the time but you know all sorts of stuff going on here this one i really really like because i elliot must have said something that really really bothered me uh and elizabeth look at the look on her face preston's thinking about fishing um oh eliza is literally clutching pearls like oh how could you say that and uh and here we're eating and you know picking off cactus needles off of preston and this is what getting pictures looks like i mean this is the back what we see right is this this is what everybody gets in the christmas card but there's so much more going on there there's months of planning that goes into it by the wife there's hundreds of dollars that is spent on the outfits and and there's a lot of work put into it hundreds of dollars spent on the photographer and this is we go through all this dusty and dirty to come up with this so this is what everybody sees but if you've been through the process you know this is what's happening one picture is mailed out at the end of the in christmas time but there's a hundred that are taken and of the 100 sometimes the one that sent out i was like well i guess this will have to do because we're not doing this all over again it's not even the one you really want and that's just that's kind of what's in my mind when we think about no filter is that we think of a family we think of a church and we've got this picture-perfect idea in our minds of what something's supposed to look like and what it's supposed to be and we ought to consider that not we don't know the process behind what we're looking at right we don't know what it what goes into bringing forth that image even a true image we can look at and think oh well it should be this way it should be that way or oh my look at that i want to be that but we don't know the process that went into it to get there and if you want to take over the slideshow from there i think from there you might just be able to follow along or i might try to help a little bit if that conflicts it's not going to not not going to bother me at all but let me just continue just to dive into this i feel very comfortable just to go whichever direction the lord would lead but as we're talking about uh using this social media hashtag you know church and even teaching doctrine things that are taught here at the church and things that your pastor feels led in his heart to address and even difficult subjects and things that raise the standard and things that kind of allow that looking that uh microscope to come over our lives spiritually this holy spirit begins to examine certain things in our lives at church and chur relationships at church should never create the same negative dynamics that social media does and that social circles do and you may be able to recall when you were in high school or in school and you had certain clicks and you were part of a certain group and you know the peer pressure that came along with that and you know the social dynamics that work to kind of cause us to be a certain way and act a certain way if you're on the football team you need to fit in with the jocks if you're if if you find friends in this group you need to fit in with that and we know the pressures that come socially in social circles and there's a lot of negative nasty dynamics when it comes to social media and this whole idea of a hashtag no filter i began to spread on instagram because every single post on instagram is carefully curated even when they say oops didn't mean to take that picture they spent hours taking that picture everything is meticulously planned and every post is heavily edited um all on social media with the intent to really let's just be honest deceive right to make you think something is a certain way and it's perceived a certain way in and because people engage on this platform they begin to post pictures they want everyone to think that every meal is picture perfect and every vacation is just uh stunning and every day is beautiful and everything is instagramable instagram living in instagram life and what happens is it put puts pressure on the person uh who is posting to produce content like you always got to have a new post it's got to look good and it puts pressures on the followers to participate and say oh that's great and and respond and everyone begins to engage and really it creates a lot of pressure for the people who are following it creates a lot of pressure for the poster and the um am i am i lost here am i no longer in control i realize now that there could be some confusion instagram here we go i want to read to you some things that they say about instagram i read a book about instagram a couple years ago it was really really staggering they said that there was early design choices that led to a culture of perfection like this is if you're on the platform it creates this culture of perfection by signaling to users that to post on instagram is to enhance and in turn to deceive these are some ideas that they say that are in this whole uh within this platform instagram it gave users permission to present the reality as more beautiful than it actually was this is what's happening on uh uh when you people engage on this platform when they're posting pictures and they're posting content it says instagram isn't designed as a neutral technology it is a carefully crafted experience and interesting is it is designed to shape behavior and create emotional attachment this is this is kind of the genesis of instagram and this is kind of what the uh the pressure that came with it the idea behind the app and i know for some of you thinking oh my goodness don't even know what instagram is but i'm just introducing this concept in social media because i think there's things that uh bleed out into our everyday lives and these are they're capitalizing on human emotions and human desires and human biases and so this is the this is what this app was preying on this is what it was promoting a culture of perfection and and to enhance things and enhancing things you're deceiving and you're given permission to present a different reality to make it look more beautiful than it actually is and so it's not meant to be neutral it's meant for you to carefully create an image and then yourself become a part of it to where you almost feel like you're living a different kind of life and kevin systrom who was the co-founder of instagram he he made a pretty funny remark he said instagram is not for half-eaten sandwiches in other words it's it's it's instagram is built for that picture of the lobster roll that makes it look like i don't even like lobster but i want to bite into that yeah i don't even like those things and i want to eat that i don't even like spicy food but that looks beautiful and if anything you've noticed things nowadays are so out of control whether it be ice cream or milkshakes or whatever all to please the eye and you're looking like man that steak looks good you know but probably doesn't taste good at all right but it looks good right the char is there all the colors are there everything looks perfect and it's meant to be that way it's because it's meant to present something even when you think about it instagram is not for half eaten sandwiches the reality is it's only to present the idea of a really good sandwich but not to actually be really good enough to eat right and it's the bible talks about it it says in ecclesiastes chapter one verse eight all things are full of labor man cannot utter it notice this phrase the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor the ear filled with hearing this is why instagram can be so successful by creating this uh this culture of perfection and everything becoming in shaping our behavior and creating an emotional attachment is because by nature we constantly desire greater fulfillment right right it's true we constantly desire to be sensitized and to be thrilled and to be satisfied and and to feel i feel a sense of pleasure and this is exactly what the bible is saying by nature the eye once it sees isn't satisfied and seen it wants to see more the ear once it here is not satisfied with hearing it wants to hear more and so certain things become addictive certain things become insatiable or i need more i need more i need more i need more and that's just the nature of man right just his nature you can't just do something one time oh well that was fun there's certain things that become a culture and it kind of gets into an ear worm or whatever it might be and you want more and you want more and with just respect to instagram it says that instagram was in the uk public health united king of public health in 2017 named instagram the worst app for mental health of young people wow and the reason why is because mental health experts were identifying this concern of the harmful impact of unrealistic images that are being presented in the media because somebody does something like i wish i had that life i wish i could eat where they eat i wish i could vacation where they're at vacationing but what was happening is people are posting these filtered images they're they're actually posting edited versions of themselves right it's true i found that somebody is takes a picture of themselves and filters it and changes it so much that when they look at instagram like oh wow that looks beautiful but when they see themselves in the mirror like i don't look like i look on instagram and it actually creates low self-esteem creates anxiety it creates creates pressure and really maybe for a church like this that um is really strong in the word and has a tremendous foundation and good teaching we might find that these things don't exist among young people or within our church where you have a strong instagram presence and everybody's trying to taunt one another with their vacation plans this year and where they went and what they're eating that may not exist at all in in this church but the same dynamics work elsewhere where you see something you perceive something you want to be something and you want to meet a certain standard or fulfill a certain role and it creates anxiety and it creates pressure so we're just kind of looking at this example within social media that we might be able to identify with and realize it's taking over the world right i don't think you could hardly go anywhere in public anymore without seeing somebody doing something really weird like what are they doing they're tick-tocking right they got a camera sitting somewhere and they're doing some dance and doing something people say is cool and what you should be doing and everyone's playing to the camera everyone's playing to social media everyone's wanting to live a life and curate a life and experience that seems really really beautiful really really engaging but then in the reality of and what the person knows is this isn't life this isn't really how i'm living and it creates such a pressure and such a uh and it doesn't promote real happiness real joy and real liberty in proverbs chapter 31 verse 30 it says favor is deceitful and beauty is vain and then i love the the contrast to it a woman that feareth the lord she shall be praised so favor it means charm or acceptance charm or acceptance is deceitful means fraudulent fake favor is deceitful favor or charm or this acceptance is fake it leads in other words it leads to disappointment when it says beauty as is vain it beauty's talking about the elegance of shape the symmetry of one's features it's actually talking about someone who's they have they're very proportional in their face and they got a really nice jawline and even their body or their shape it says this beauty this proportion of parts is uh is is vain the bible's making this uh making this declaration beauty and favor give a false representation of the person favor is deceitful and beauty is vain it can it's this is a really tremendous statement in our proverbs that the symmetry and proportion of parts the natural or even artificial beauty uh it can is vain all right the beauty of something you may look wow that is beautiful but it's actually uh not it's deceitful or wow that they look strong or they look pretty or they they have a particular appearance they must be really happy they must be really successful they must be really healthy but that's not the case all the time right it's true even finding nature some of the things that seem to be the most beautiful or the things that are most harmful so the most poisonous plants can be the most beautiful some of the most venomous animals uh can be the most appealing to the eye wow that's a beautiful that's a beautiful snake i want to handle you or wow that's a beautiful plant i want to eat you and one could be very very detrimental to our health why because even in nature beauty is used to deceive that's right and in this sense as the writer is teaching us he's saying that external beauty as favors deceitful and beauty as vain is saying that external beauty can hide uh poor character external beauty and and a shapely body and nice features can hide an ill nature so in that way appearances are deceiving and so as we've spent a lot more time on this than we thought you might say well how does this relate to church how in the world how are we going to make this applicable brother aaron and how are you going to how are you going to make this applicable to family and i thought about that beforehand so we're all right we're not just going to sing ask for sister cheryl to get back in here real quick and sing take the name of jesus with us but uh we've this is this is just foundation for that thinking about this what does this have to do with church what does this have to do with your gathering as sin the light what does this have to do with your family and the way your family's arranged and the circumstances you've been through let me say this way as a church we don't strive for visual perfection amen it's true we're not striving for everything to look pretty for instagram and for everything to look just right on video and for everything to look just right in pictures if we were doing that church could be a lot shorter right yeah right because we just get everything lined up just right just to look just right and feel just right and snap just the perfect picture put a nice filter over it post it to send the light on instagram it's a hashtag great service this morning our pastor rocks and everybody looks like ah i wish we went to that church right we're not striving for visual perfection amen within our families we're not striving for everyone to look at us when we show up at church and everyone gets out wearing gingham shirts they'll be like isn't that family cute all everyone's nice and dressed well and everything looks good that's not what we're striving for teaching and even the doctrines that we hold precious to our hearts and if i say this way when we present a scriptural image when we teach things from the bible teach things from the word of god it's not an exercise of posting a filtered picture it's not an exercise of just trying to achieve a certain look or have a certain image and we can this is the way that i begin to ponder it and realize that it works on us is in our minds when something is preached we can create an expectation based upon what we perceive to be the desired result amen right brother bruce or brother john or any minister here can preach something and in preaching it uh we hear we hear the quote read or we hear the scripture and we hear the teaching and then as we're hearing it we're filtering it right it's true so we're putting a filter on it and we think oh well this is what it must look like or this is what it should be and and this is what i'm being told i need to become and we can just filter things as they come right true and so we create these unrealistic expectations based upon the filter that we're putting between the image and what's being preached we're actually the one putting up the filter and it creates an unreasonable expectation on our part or we could be creating unrealistic expectations based upon what we perceive to be the ideal christian right what we what we so we're filtering what we hear but then we also it's what we look at and what we're perceiving and we create these expectations based upon what we think to be the perfect family what we think to be the perfect church and there's a lot of things that people and i realize that saying this here i wouldn't say that it misses the mark but maybe i should at least get some real hearty amens there's a lot of people that choose their church based merely upon appearances right that's right oh i i want to go to church where there's a really dynamic youth group or i want to go to church where they've got a nice choir i want to go to church that looks like a church and they say these things because they think about what other people are going to see what is it going to look like and how people are going to perceive it and in some ways they're just using the pinterest idea of church they're using an instagram idea of church it's got to look good it's got to have a certain feel to it it's got to have a filter on it it needs to be hipster it needs to be vintage it needs to be shabby chic or whatever you want it to look good and so that's what you go that's what you put into church and these are things that we put pressures on ourselves and so we must be very careful about you know church ideation or family ideation where we have this certain uh image and we that things ought to be and we really need to be careful about uh idolizing certain churches that's true that's right you hear of a certain church you hear of a work a brother is doing or you see a ministry that has been successful for many many years and what it achieves and you look at it and say oh that's the way i want our church to be or you you look at one particular church like oh that's the church that's the model or you look at a particular family's oh if our family could just be like that we need to be really really careful about having these ideations or these idolizations of different churches different believers different ministries and different families amen that's right because the truth is we could i we could envy someone say oh man if i could just be like brother john we could really envy a situation man if i could just work there if i could just do this if i could just be able to go on vacation like they do or go do what they're doing but then have no idea of the reality of it right that's right i remember one time we were driving by a house uh we were on one road a road trip i know that's no surprise to you all that we'd be on the road and uh well i forgot to mention one thing i i would come here and i would get vacation from there was only one thing i'd get a vacation from how many remembers what it was elliot remembers shaving and i don't shave anymore so i don't even get that as a vacation once i came out from under certain ideas of pretense and pressures and certain things that you you get around and you fellowship around and you come in contact with or you feel these pressures i realized that probably the reason why i wasn't shaving is not because of what i wanted to do but what i thought everybody else would think and when i got here i felt comfortable well no one's going to judge me here i don't have to shave and i realize you know what i don't care what other people think when it comes to a beard or no beard and so hashtag beard hashtag no shaving i don't know how long it's been but it's been months now so i don't get any vacation anymore when i come to michigan because i don't shave anyways so we were driving on one of these road trips i got lost there for a moment and we drove by this beautiful beautiful scenery very bucolic and green and it was a white farmhouse and everything was just absolutely gorgeous and we drove by and i think it had the black shutters it was white and black and elizabeth says ah i would i would love to have that house or i'd love to something like that and uh and i just and i instinctively said do you want do you want the divorce that comes with it do you want the you know the you do you want the two income family do you want the the two more the double mortgages do you what do you what do you want like you want the house but you know what came what went into it do you know what it's mortgaged by do you know what's behind it do you know what it takes to have that house and we could be showing a picture and say do you want this and god can show it to say yes yes i want that go give it to me yes right when we see a picture of a hamburger on instagram it's like yes i'll take it whatever it takes i'll have it well you don't know what's behind it right it's true and we might we might actually desire i said okay fine you can have it but then we don't ask the question wait a minute what's going to cost me right what does it take to have that and sometimes we could desire a certain lifestyle or desire to have a certain uh possession that we see that somebody else has and we don't know the sacrifice that it took for that person to have it we don't know the suffering that people go through to achieve the things that they've achieved and it's easy i could say this as young christians or young ministers or different callings in life we begin to see something say well that's what i want to be or that's how i want i want uh to look or i want to have that and you don't realize the decades of faithfulness and the decades of perseverance and discipline that's gone into someone's life to achieve that right and as young men there's we can look at families oh that brother has this this brother has that and we want to have it but you have to look at the whole life what kind of faithfulness did they have what kind of suffering did they go through and so we're really challenging this notion that when you see something you say i want to be that but do you even know what goes into it even know what's behind it because the christian life this is something i know that i'm sure has been ministered here the christian life is not one of competition and comparison that's true mother john came and preached at a church that we were attending and he preached a sermon we were there when you went ministering preached on competition you're talking about just razor sharp discernment he came and preached on the subject competition that you know it's not you don't really hear it preached on but it was just very very perfect for the situation very very beautiful and very on point and so i know that even your pastor is very sensitive to these these issues that the christian life is not one of competition when it comes to being christians we're not competing with anybody this is a war this is a fight this is a battle we understand the engage and in conflict so there's conflict but it's no competition we're not engaged in comparison and this goes for every aspect of life it goes to with respect to your holiness with respect to family with respect to church and church order it says in first corinthians chapter 14 verse 26 how is it off then brethren when you come together every one of you half the psalm half a doctor and half a half a tongue half the revelation half an interpretation so everyone has it's show-and-tell you know churches i can out-psalm you i can out-hem you i can out-tongue you i cannot interpret you he says let all things be done into edifying church isn't for making a show of talent amen uh uh the christian life isn't a competitive thing we're not competing with one another when it comes to holiness we're not competing with one another in terms of how much we prayed and how well we know our bible and what we know about the message and we wouldn't want to create a culture where people feel like they should be listening to the message just in case they're going to get called on the carpet and not know what the third pool is or create a culture in church where people feel like they gotta meet a certain standard well did you did you read your bible at two o'clock did you do that you want to create the kind of life with christ where people are doing those things because they want to we don't come to church on a wednesday night because we know that if if we don't on sunday we're going to hear about it like where were you wednesday night that's not what the kind of culture right that you want to create with respect to church and paul is dealing with this idea of making a show of talent within the church and so it shows us when he talks about this everyone comes with different things he says let everything be done under edifying let it be done to help someone else to promote somebody else's virtue to encourage them to edify the body because we are not in competition with each other right we're not in competition with anybody for that matter that's right our goal is christ we have a singular goal at its foundation and really maybe the the real core of what i'm trying to share with you uh tonight is just this real simple component that a a church is one that puts the word first it's true amen a true church a true church is one that puts the word first a true family is one where god is first where christ has the preeminence and that's what we strive for i want christ to have premise in my life whatever that expression would be for me whatever gifts and callings that would amplify whatever place that would lead me whatever it would do in my life that's what i want to promote and that's what a church ought to promote amen i've been studying this week on the five definite identifications of the true church of the living god and i thought maybe i was going to minister it tonight i thought maybe i'd minister it on sunday i'm just not sure which way the lord would lead and you find that when brother braham identifies the true church it has nothing to do with this church send the light i say it has nothing to do with it he's not identifying send the light or word of life or or this church or that church it's not identifying any particular local church he's saying you have the true church that has definite identifications and when you recognize what the true church is who she is what she stands for when you recognize these definite identifications of the true church you realize that as if you're going to be a real local church then your function is to support the true church like you can't do anything as a as a local church that would be harmful detrimental to the true church how could you be a real genuine god-established god-led local church if you do something to the detriment of the true church that's right right and brother-in-law's kind of going through that that way of laying that thing those things out and this is what's important to realize even as a within a family is you're not trying to strive to just have order and raise your children to look a certain way and do a certain thing but you're wanting to promote virtue in their heart you want to develop character in their heart to where they can make decisions on their own for with integrity and honesty you want them to come to know the lord and be led of god and to stand for truth and there's certain things you're trying to cultivate and do within the family you're doing the same thing within a church that you want people to be led of god you want them to follow the leadership of the lord you want to have confidence that when they say brother john i feel led to do this that he sees that god is leading in your life and i believe that brother john is of the character that if you said well brother john i feel led to go do this he'd say okay if you're feeling led to go do it you ought to do it but if you had any caution in his heart he'd tell you but i want you to consider this you should think about that but he's never going to put his foot down and say well if you're part of the body of christ and you if you're going to serve god you can only serve them here because that runs against the very definition of a son of god they that are sons of god are led by the spirit of god so as a church you don't try to create a culture in an environment that restricts or restrains movement and leadership you promote it and you cultivate that because it's one of the most important things that a believer should have amen as we read here in romans chapter 12 and i feel like i'm running out of time i didn't note the time that i started but as we read from here let me just read this as you have it have this uh you have the the king james version before you what paul is saying is be yourself say just be yourself every one of you have received grace so if we've all received grace we just all breathe the sigh of relief and look around say nobody's better than me that's right you ain't better than me that's why you got to say it or say you know you realize hey i we've all received grace and so and then we maybe we need to remind ourselves instead of saying you ain't better than me maybe we say i ain't better than anybody else i'm not better than anybody else here we're all the same and so we don't have this pressure where i think i'm better than you or you feel i feel like i'm less than you we've all received grace and paul said we've all received it just be yourself amen if somebody preaches that doesn't mean they've had more grace than you they've just got a different proportion of it if somebody if somebody does this that doesn't there's no competition there's no one better than anybody else is he as the companion to this he says we're all members and there's some members that we think are less honorable and if you think they're less than give them double amen if they're uncommonly they're more necessary if they seem feeble they're they're even more necessary because he's changing our attitude towards having these levels and these hierarchies and we perceive that if you do this whoa you're that's that that's awesome and i if you've traveled a lot you've been in any different kind of churches there's a dynamic where it's like well there's this attitude that comes sometimes i'm not picking on anybody here i don't think i think it's pretty safe to say here but there's sometimes this cockiness and this arrogance that comes with being a deacon you've probably seen it before but he won't admit to it he's too nice and and they carry themselves like they're better than everybody because they're a deacon and it becomes a point of personal pride and ownership of it and if the pastor was to go to him and say brother you've served well i want you to step down and let somebody else step in they'd probably leave the church because they they love the social they love the status they love the symbol they love the position they're not they're really to serve and be servants they're not really seeing the need and meeting the need they get so caught up in the image of it and they create this hierarchy in these levels and you've got the church board and you have the pastor up here and really a lot of churches have just succumbed to man worship yeah right where the pastor has the prime parking spot and everything's built around the man the man the man to where we get the point to where we don't say that we go to send the light we say we go to brother john's right where do you go to church oh brother john martins well it's brother john martin's it's brother mark cosby's it's brother ron clayton i mean it's right it's brother marty's you know brother john if he ever says my church he uses he says it in the same way that you could say it right yeah right because it's your church and it has a name it's not just identified with the man it's not just identified with the pastor it's and so when paul is saying here in this this is read i think this is from the amplified he says so since we find ourselves fashioned and all these excellently formed in marvelously functioning parts in christ's body let's just go ahead and be what we're made to be amen without enviously or pridefully comparing ourselves with each other and trying to be something we aren't this is this is what paul is saying even in first corinthians chapter 14 since god has made us this way we find ourselves fashioned all these excellently formed and marvelously functioning parts in christ's body let us just be what we're made to be amen as it says in second corinthians chapter 10 verse 12 he says for we dare not compare ourselves of the number or compare ourselves with something that commended themselves but they measuring themselves by themselves and comparing themselves among themselves are not wise he's addressing how we see ourselves and this is where it's not wise because how do we most often do it probably at least i'm not as bad off as they are right that's right that's true and so god's really challenging us to take a step higher to do something more be more constantly created to do something more for the kingdom of god and in the way that we kind of defuse the conviction says well at least i'm not like that guy when's the last time he paid his ties when's the last time he went to church or at least we're not like that at least we're not like like them and what we're doing is we're comparing ourselves and we're comparing measuring ourselves by ourselves comparing ourselves with ourselves and he's saying that that is not wise what's the same comparison is the thief of joy or the death of joy when you compare yourself you're robbing yourself for the joy you can have in the lord amen but it's human nature it's human nature to want to compare ourselves so when paul says this it's not like he's he's really getting to the root of human psyche and human behavior and behavioral economics it's human nature it's our instinct to compare ourselves it's instinct to compare our possessions when we when we get out our phone and we're answering the you know when the weather alert goes off and everybody's phone in the church goes off and you pull out your iphone 4 and then the brother next you pulls out his iphone pro 12 max right and you're like and immediately you got phone envy you're like oh my goodness let me look at my iphone 4 here it's slow it doesn't work and they're opening things with their eyes you know just blink three times to send a text message to your wife and they're doing all sorts of gestures and a hologram comes up and you're just over there like i'm gonna make a phone call over here with my flip phone and we get we can feel this we compare our possessions we compare our situation well i'm having to work a nine to five you only make so much and i don't have this and i don't have that and you're comparing yourselves and just to go back to what we were talking about a moment ago you could be looking at somebody and you're comparing your beginning to somebody else's middle right true you're all discouraged where you're at but you're comparing yourself to somebody else's end and well this is just where i'm at right now in life and oh i wish i could be there you're just starting don't be too hard on yourself that's right you're in a different time of life you're doing different things god called you to do something else and sometimes we get way down the road in life and we're doing certain things and we have a certain uh things have changed and we're in a particular role and we look back and we see the young whippersnapper coming up and he's doing all sorts of things like ah well you know bless god i i remember those days you start to get bitter and critical of the young guy it's like no let him be him he's in his beginning he's learning he's doing certain things god can use them differently be happy where you are you begin to compare it's the thief of joy right it's true i was at a minister's meeting do you archive these do these are these going live to the whole world oh great but i was at a minister's meeting they don't they don't record the minister's meeting but i'll i'll preserve it here for posterity the uh uh the uh the minister there was a they had a young minister speaking an older minister speak and they had the older minister speak first and he said i'm 80 years old and he said who would you rather hear speak some 80 year old man who's been through something and got something to say or some 50 year old ain't lived nothing yet and the next guy coming up was 50 years old you know it was kind of like wow that was really on point and but that's kind of the attitude he took and what was he he was being defensive because he realizes there's young men who uh who have it's 30 more years yet to be where he is and maybe he sees his he's coming to the twilight of his ministry and his time in his ministry and his influence is fading and he knows his days aren't very long and he looks back and he's like i've already blazed this trail i've already done these things he builds up a complex against young ministers builds up a complex because what comparing right comparing yourself what does it say in first samuel 16 verses 6 to 7 when it came time to choose a king that's right when samuel saw eliot he said surely the lord's anointed is before him i tall the elder the strong shoulders back and he's like this is it this is it go no further this is somebody if you tweeted this this is the next king everybody would love it everybody would retweet it it would be great there wouldn't be a false news uh warning on that this would be like this is what everybody wants but the lord said to samuel look not on his countenance or on the height of a stature because i refused him for the lord seeth not as mansive for man looketh on the outward appearance but the lord looketh on the heart saul looked like a good king tall taller than everyone else he had the appearance he had that regal look he carried himself this man is a king and certainly samuel might have seen the same thing in eliot he's like there's a tall guy here's a strong man he's a he would be older he would be wired this is it don't wait no further this is the one we want this is the one we can go to we could anoint his king but god cautiously said no don't look on the outside because remember saul looked like a king on the outside but lacked the heart of a king on the inside even to the point where the bible says they had he had to give saul another heart and what happened when the anointing left him saul was left to his own devices but here's david who had a heart after god had a heart like unto god a heart a man after god's own heart that god could anoint him and then david with his heart even though he sinned worse it would seem than saul he humbled himself and he repented because he had the character on the inside to be the right kind of king and he was the kind of king that god constantly said that if you walk after my servant david if you live like david if you serve like david i'll preserve the throne forever and actually because of david's character god made a promise that he would never take the throne away from his family not because of what he looked like because when he finally came up before sam he's like this guy yeah ready small the youngest out in the field you know walk looking after the sheep they didn't think he was important enough to be there but god looked on the inside it says in galatians chapter six verses three to four for if a man think himself to be something when he's nothing he deceiveth himself but let every man prove his own work and then shall he have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another joy will come from god's work in you that's where real happiness doesn't come from is from god's work in you not by comparing yourself to someone else then when you see god doing something in you and you see him bringing something out of you and he's performing this work in you let every man prove his own work then he'll have rejoicing in himself alone and not in another man's work not on what god's done for somebody else says this is actually one of the translations let everyone be sure that he's doing his very best for then he'll have the personal satisfaction of work well done and won't need to compare himself with someone else if you did your best then you're satisfied i did what i could i did what i could with the resources i was given and then whatever the outcome is you've trusted it to the lord and said this is what i've done but if you begin to compare to someone else or if you didn't do your best and you see someone else then you'll start to justify make excuses or you'll condemn yourself and bring yourself down so just let everyone do their best do your best and you won't have need to compare yourself to someone else when i use this no filter i don't know if it's really i it makes sense to me but i kind of feel like in some of it may be getting lost in the delivery but we're conveying this idea that we should not create the carnal image of a christian right should not create this polished look of what a christian is or what a church should be and it has this image it has these things in place and it is supposed to have certain things and someone might say well you know how many deacons do you have and how many trustees do you have and how many board meetings do you have and how many special meetings do you have and when's your annual convention and how many people did you have and all sorts of metrics like god doesn't measure anything like that matter of fact when when they wanted to count how many were in the kingdom it was something that was it was not wise it wasn't wise to count it's not wise to try to put on the show and do all the pretense and so we can create i'm just kind of addressing this don't have a carnal image in our minds of what a church should be and what a church should look like don't have this carnal image in our minds of what family should be like and what a relationship could be like and and what my life should be like in the relationship to everyone else's brother branham and that quote we mentioned in the very beginning he said a true family is one that's in harmony and in love so we can paint a picture real quick oh this is what a true family is he said the beauty of a church is the character of the people oh this is what a church should look like and we get these images in our minds but what i'm saying is don't fabricate a representation of that image in your mind and try to meet it right that's true don't filter the word as it's preached and the word is being preached to you and then you're going to take the word and you're going to rearrange it to create a picture that's not the one that's being presented and say i want to be like that that's filtered or when you see somebody else's life and you see some other image you see something to be done you look at that and you look at this filter you filter towards like oh that's what it should be like that's what it must be like that's what i want to be like because when we fabricate this image of what a church should be what a christian should be what a family should be it creates pressure to achieve only visual perfection that's all we're trying to achieve is so that it looks good in the optics and so sometimes the what it should look like we pursue the wrong image or maybe worse we think that's what it looks like and we feel like we can never do it so it paralyzes us well i guess i can never be that i can never be a christian like brother john i could never pray like brother mark i could never do this like this person and it just stymies us and it makes us become stagnant should we take a vote on who wants to go home whether we should continue my kid my children aren't allowed to vote i have we'll have the pastor vote here's some examples with you to encourage you and first kings chapter 17 verse nine in this elijah is there's a famine in the land he's been fed by these ravens and after the ravens are done feeding him in the brook the brook dries up god says arise get to zerephath which belongeth to zidane and dwell there behold i've commanded a widow woman there to sustain thee so much that we could share in it but just think of it think of it this way just be honest with what the scripture is presenting a widow woman this is a single mother right and a single mother is not the image we would have of a true family a single mother is certainly not the image that we would have of a true church here's a single mother trying to raise a child on her own that's not the image that we would have that that who god would send the prophet to to be sustained by wouldn't god send the prophet to a family that's kind of put together you know where the wife is under the headship of the husband and everything's being ruled well and everything's perfect in an order and everything is really like this the kind of has like this is something we could post to instagram and elijah's in the front front of the house saying made it to my made it to my airbnb and xerapath right and he's posting a really neat selfie and he's doing the walkthrough wow look at this and how dramatic no no here here's the rawness of it hey get up from the brook the ravens are done feeding you the brook's dried up i've called you to zaraphath oh really really tell me about the place well it's a widow woman that's about to die there's a sign they're starving to death she's going out gonna get some oil and and a little flower together and make her last meal and die and i want you to stay there i think it's not the image that we would have of the place that elijah would come and be sustained but it's what god had appointed god had appointed that family if you want to use the woman as a type of a church god had appointed that church to preserve the prophet and his ministry and let me say this to you if there's been any stigma or reproach or in your mind any weakness to uh what this uh this church that's been here for 20 years if there's been any at all let all of it get washed away all the stigma all the reproach all the carnal things that you've tried to attach to it the devil's trying to attach to it god has called you even to the world maybe seen oh a single mother church and it doesn't have this and it doesn't have this it looks like that and it looks like that god has commanded this church to send the light around the world amen and it's probably done more in missions than 98 of any other church only probably more that might i don't know any other church that's done more in terms of the consistent giving and the labor for missions overseas and to see that people have bibles and even clothes and look after the needs of the people that's been a ministry you've been a part of god had appointed that church in zarephath to sustain to preserve the prophet to sustain his ministry and brother branham said she put god before her children she put god before anything else she took the kingdom of god first really that's all we can do i can't try to be like brother marty i can't try to be like brother john i can't try to be like this person or that person i could try to i'd like to fish like brother ron and we but we can't we can't be somebody else we can just do you it's all you can do and really all we can do is put god first it's all that we would ask of one another you put god first you put god first you put god first just if each one of us can put god first that's all we can do we can't be somebody else we can't take their part oh sister so-and-so gets to play the piano sister so-and-so gets to lead songs and this one gets to sing this or gets to uh dude sunday school and this and we look at all these i'm not advocating for women to lead songs i meant to say sunday school and you have all these different positions people is like well you can't do that and this person does that and this person just do your part do all that you can do offer right if you want to do something offer that's right that's right and it's so beautiful for this widow she couldn't change her past all she could do is just put the word before as her future god had appointed her this is maybe a little lengthy but i want to read it again because it just seems such a non tr i want to read through it because it's really it kind of confronts this image of what we have of a real message believer right this pedigree this legacy and i'm i'm a fourth generation message believer and you know my father and his father and his father you know they were all you know real died in the wool message believers you know born in the tabernacle and then we think oh wow if i could just go to the gravestone and you know it's like we have these ideas of what really makes a real message believer but notice this in acts chapter 16 verses 1 to 5 then came he to derby into lystra and behold a certain disciple was there named timotheus the son of a certain woman which was a jews and believed and then but his father was a greek kind of signaling to us right here's a man who was a disciple his mom was a jew but his dad's an unbeliever they're letting us know that which was well reported about by the brethren that were at leicester and i come said a good testimony good report him would paul have to go forth with him paul chose this one who was the son of a certain woman who was a jew and believed was now converted to christianity but his father is an unbeliever this is the one that paul chooses to go with him and took and circumcised him because of the jews which were in those quarters for they knew all that his father was a greek not a believer not a christian not a jew not even a christian and as they went through the cities they delivered them the decrees for to keep that were ordained of the apostles and elders which are at jerusalem and so were the churches established in the faith and increased in number daily think about timothy is called the labor side by side with paul and is part of this great uh ministry to the church establishing churches in the faith and increasing in number daily and fam timothy's family has a very unique mixture very unique structure the scripture is telling us that he's of a mixed marriage between a jew and a gentile and timothy himself by the scripture is not raised a jew so he comes from this un you know kind of a mixed marriage you have a jew you have a greek you have a gentile married to a jew you have a son that's born to the a jewish mother into a greek father he's not raised in the jewish faith he's a he's raised as a gentile now you're going to bring the word to jews and you want to establish the faith and paul is saying well let's circumcise you since we're going to be going to the jews he's got a really unique family situation from his background but notice what he says to timothy in second timothy chapter one verse five he says well when i call to remembrance the unfeigned faith that is in thee remember he had a good report timothy did he says which first dwelt and thy grandmother lois and thy mother eunice and i'm persuaded that is in thee also amen paul passes over the father because he was suggesting that he remained an unbeliever but he said it's your grandma that became a christian and when your grandmother became a christian it's through her example and her witness that your the daughter your mother became converted to christianity and now timothy you because of your grandma's faithfulness because of your mother's faithfulness now you are faithful and the husbands in this are never even mentioned could you imagine this is the story you have a woman that believes the message name lois husband doesn't ever believe but her daughter comes to know the truth of her example husband never believes the son's not even raised in the faith not even raised to believe even what the mother believed the one true god but then she converts to christianity and then one day god gets a hold of her son two generations mixed believing nobody's it's not this perfect uh lineage and man the man was in his place and fully functioning family everyone under subjection everything the token applied and that's what produced a timothy no very unique structure in timothy's family but god took the son of this mixed marriage and made him a leader in the new testament church was it poe buddies nerfed right you get it po buddy's nerfed nobody's perfect not even timothy that was gonna be the title of my sermon i think i it fell more flat than my hashtag no filter god can use dysfunction for his glory if we just yield it to him whatever the mess god can use it praise god if our if our bait casting reel has got a huge bird's nest and the lion's all tangled we can't seem to give it just hand it over to god he can use it amen god in the bible think about it the bible the bible gives us an unfiltered picture of redemption the bible gives us the unfiltered story man that's a better way to put it god gives us the unfiltered story of redemption when we look at the bible we don't even have a perfect narrative you understand what i mean it's not it's not just done in a way to where it just seems like everything's perfect and everything's clean and everything's neat god preserves the mistakes god preserves the blemishes and the failures of his people he includes them all in there and he doesn't make anything to be something that it's not and he does it all for edification and why does god allow this word even in the way that he presents it it's perfect but maybe not perfect in the way that we think perfection is it's perfect just the way he's preserved it it's perfect just the way that he's delivered it to us but when we read it we can read of mistakes we can read of blemishes we could read things and say well it says this here and it says that there but god has preserved it for our edification what does it teach us that regardless of our situation god can take our brokenness god can take our uniqueness god can take our family situation which isn't ideal god could take a situation that doesn't seem to be pure god could take a situation that seems to be hopeless and he can use it for something beautiful praise god i just i mean think about it relationships relationships are messy family dynamics can be very very complicated can be unique and challenging we can be estranged from our family we could find that church alone is our family we could find that there's people coming together and learning to respect one another and work together those things are very difficult whether you see it professionally in business and running a running a business you have different personalities and different gifts and different different abilities and ambitions and it's very difficult to harmonize that harmonize those things with a vision that you might have in business and and even with the family of different degrees of learning and different degrees of perception and different ways of disciplining you learn that you can there's ways that you would address one child that you can't address the other child the same way and it's that way in the church that's right so we can only be who we are let god deal with that person in the way that they are let god deal with that person the way that they are but then we all are just yielding saying hey i'm on my will god you're forming me you're you're doing something to me and you rejoice you see brother mark on his will you've got however god wants to mold you brother i'm with you i support you and we can support one another when we're being torn down and we're being worked over and really going through something we can kind of all experience it together but it's our experience that we were conscious of that we're yielding to and we're expecting god to do something beautiful in america so what is this i'm trying to bring this to a close i think i just have a couple more scriptures here let me just leave you with some thoughts when we say no filter it means no judgment when you say no filter means no pretense no competition no comparison amen no personal pressure on ourselves i'm not gonna pressure myself to be a certain way no political pressure to achieve change within our church no political pressure to achieve uh change within our families amen because the purpose of church the purpose of lifting up the word the purpose of teaching true teaching is not to paint the picture of the perfect family not to paint the picture of the perfect church but just to lift up scriptural promises that's right lift up scriptural truths that we can place our faith in that's right that when when divine healing is preached it's not to make the person that's sick and not healed feel bad because they haven't been healed say god by your stripes he's healed and god he paid the price for that sickness on calvary 2 000 years ago and that's not preached so the person over there who's been suffering with an affliction for many many years is like well i guess i don't have enough faith no it's continuing to lift up the truth so that that's what you put your faith in amen because in reality you're constantly being reminded by your doctor how sick you are you're constantly being reminded by by your symptoms how much pain you're in you're constantly reminded by family history everyone in your family died 62 years old with a heart attack or you have diabetes you have this and you're constantly be reminded by all the negative right and so the preach of the word is not to condemn you but to preach in divine healing preaching that by your strife by his stripes you're healed is not to make you feel bad because you haven't been but to persuade you to put all your faith in that that's right it's the word giving us a path to walk in amen even a place to walk towards the preach of the word gives us a goal that we're walking towards but then is creating the path that we can walk in and remember it's always a work in progress right when we went through these family pictures try to get back there this is what it looked like right but it was always a work in progress right that's right our lives sometimes this is all we're ever seeing right like this is this is a family this is everyday life and it may never look like this we can do this for family pictures but as far as our life is concerned this may be what our life always looks like always always this never the never the image that we're striving for never what exactly what we think it should be but that's not our goal our goal at the end of the day isn't to achieve some perfect picture it's always a work in progress man i went through a lot tonight let me just get to where hey don't laugh too heartily you might get a complex we should make it our ambition to please god amen amen say our family ambition is to please god not man our church and our ambition as a church is to guide to serve not control i always appreciate it as i started a church last year as you know and the people have just been absolutely amazing i kind of feel like um god's done it maybe for my my family and my children my wife especially because i certainly haven't deserved such a wonderful group of people that have come together so beautifully and they communicate brother aaron we're not going to be there and in the beginning people are coming so frequently if they couldn't make it to church i just said hey we're here to serve not take attendance i said always love to know when you're not going to be here i think that helps me especially if you're going to do something we're expecting to be there just always give us a heads up that's great but i don't want you to do it because we're taking attendance we're just here to serve that's what a church is here to do the church is here to serve and to guide not to control so a church has an ambition and a vision to see that you succeed spiritually not that the church succeeds naturally a family has an ambition to please god paul says for do i now persuade men or god galatians 1 10 or do i seek to please men for if i yet pleased men i should not be the servant of christ he said am i preaching to get followers am i preaching just to please men he said if i if i did that if i did that just to please men if i did that just to have followers i by appearance sake it may look like i've preached and i've gained this following but really saying i'm a servant to my followers amen i've become a servant to the crowd that i've gathered around me i become a servant to the people that i brought under my ministry in my orbit and under my influence i become i it looks like i'm their head it looks like they're my slaves it looks like they're my subject but in reality you've become a slave to your crowd you become a slave to your followers and that's what happens to these influencers and their whole lives are now living they're called influencers on instagram and tick tock and these social media platforms but really who are they influenced by their followers because they've now gotta cater to the crowd they've got to grow their numbers they've got to increase their membership and paul is saying do i persuade men do i seek to please men if i did that i'm not a servant of christ so i believe that we ought to strive for scriptural perfection i believe that we ought to strive to be perfect in our lives and our families and in our church but not to impress people but to please god amen if we make decisions within our family within our relationships and our personal life if we make decisions and do things as a church to promote whether it be to promote standards or even adhere to standards for the eyes of men then we become the servant of man but our goal must be our goal is harmony harmony with the word of god that's what we want within a family harmony with the word of god love among each other what we want within a church harmony with the word of god love among each other from where from the inside amen not the outside praise god peter writes in 1st peter chapter 3 verses 3 and 4 whose adorning let it not be in that outward adorning of plaiting the hair and of wearing of gold or putting on of apparel it's about the woman it can certainly be used in type of the church the the local church let's not let all of her labor and her appearance and everything just be the the plotting of the hair the wearing of gold the putting off a pair of what he is doing is he's cautioning against being consumed by what the outside looks like says but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament now from the inside the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which in the sight of god not the perception of men not the filter man not on the instagram or pinterest but in the sight of god of great price praise god that's where you have a vision not not the filtered one but with no filter you have a vision to please god amen and i say this to you as a church today i commend you on your over 20 years now i don't know if you had did you have your university services this year at all did you think you were wanting to do am i wrong to say were you weren't you going to do like a 20-year anniversary meetings and i was going to preach i was going to headline and it was going to be a big to do we're saving it we're saving it yeah for 25. um but let me say this to you commend you in your faithfulness and your labor what you've done brother john here all that you've stood for there's no filter on this it's genuine it's authentic it's real and in re when you see it for what it is nothing else compares because it's real and i say for each of you whatever your situation has been in your families and in your life and what you're going through and your background and whatever this church has endured whatever you've gone through personally whatever hurts and pains and whatever things may look at you just take your picture the one that god has of you the one that's perfect the one that's complete the one that's whole and walk towards it by faith if you're the widow of zarephath keep walking into that ministry god's called you to keep walking forward to what god's called you to if you're a timothy you just keep walking in the things that god's called you to because it's not we're not being judged by worldly things or worldly metrics we're judging ourselves by the word of god bless you let's stand i'd like just to pray with you and turn it over to brother john if we could maybe we'll just ask the lord to help us now help lord remove all the filters our gracious heavenly father tonight as we stand in your divine presence just by this act of bowing our heads and lifting up our voice to you lord we desire that there be any filter that we've put on the word lord may it be removed lord we're even taught that the word should be our filter that there's got to be we've got to have this discipline that the word itself keeps out things that aren't pure and keeps things away from us that's harmful lord if we've used any kind of carnal filter to create an image of christ that is not true lord we pray that you take it away we've caused we've used any kind of filter man-made filter to produce the image of a christian that is not true lord we ask that you take away the filter lord if we filtered the preaching and the teaching of this church to be pointing to an image that's not accurate lord if we've if we've done it of our own doing our own accord lord remove the filter lord if we viewed other people's lives as being a desirable and what we want to achieve and we're trying to achieve that image or maybe we even remove that filter lord certainly if we filtered our lives to try to present to others that were put together and things are good and everything's fine and we've done it for pretense and for politics lord remove the filter lord take these jumbled up scattered here and there thoughts and these different things that i've delivered just with the real maybe more with my personality lord i pray that it would be effective for your people may it encourage them to see that where this church stands today and what it's done and what it's labored for is never in god's eyes measured by instagram followers and pins on pinterest and circles on in social media subscribers and views or even members it's judged by whether or not we've done what we're asked to do judged by whether or not we're we're being what you've called us to be may that be our ambition as a church maybe our ambition as a family just to do us do what we're called to do be what we're called to be and not take another man's place now try to be something else bless your people may there be a reward lord in their spirits of a refreshing and a lightening of their burden may they be encouraged may you continue to have preeminence and bless these people i pray in the name these saints of god not just these people this beautiful church and the servants therein bless them i pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen praise the lord god bless you tonight brother john if you'd come brother aaron that was just absolutely beautiful oh my that was just beautiful and to think that was that was could be for anybody but that was for our church and um i believe the lord has given us directions in how to grow and to become more into his character and and just to be ourselves be a be ourselves and not try to be something that we're we're not listening that little core is pleasing pleasing let me be pleasing please let me be pleasing to you let everything that i do be pleasing to you pray let everything i pursue be pleasing unto you [Music] please me be pleasing to you let everything that i do be pleasing to you pray [Music] let everything i pursue be pleased o lord unto you one more time just with all your heart meaning to him please [Music] let me be pleasing to you let everything that i do be pleasing to let everything i pursue be pleased lord unto you amen i'm so glad i know my jesus i you know after this so after the service i feel i can be myself and make all the mistakes and it's still okay now [Music] i'm so glad i got acquainted with the one that is anointed here he's the one who cleansed and made me whole i'm so glad i know my jesus i'm so glad i love his name he's the one who saved me and satan [Music] i'm so glad i got acquainted with the one that is anointed he's the one who cleansed and made me whole amen may the lord be with you and make you feel so whole i just i feel very refreshed as our brother was praying i felt this this is for me and uh i feel that we can serve god better when we're just ourselves we can serve one another we're not worried about having to be perfect to do something for somebody just at your heart and uh boy i just i just this this this service here the word that we heard today the living word that was amongst us i believe it fits right in to what god has been speaking to us he's wanting us to grow and this this this was this was it amen amen may the lord be with you bless you and keep you and let's continue to pray one for another and for the service this sunday and god puts it on your heart and fights somebody i think they would be really blessed amen and then gonna ask our precious grandson elliot to close in the word of prayer and thank you for blessing us with your word tonight thank you lord keep us out of temptation thank you for us and we love you and thank you
