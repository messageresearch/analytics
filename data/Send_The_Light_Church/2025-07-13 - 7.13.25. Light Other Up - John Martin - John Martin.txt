I'm at least 90% betterise. &gt;&gt; So, praise the Lord for that. Amen. Amen. Sister Beckman says, "Please pray for our granddaughter, Addie. She's on traveling on the road from Ohio today."

So when you get even on the back roads, anytime before you leave the driveway, say, "Lord, please send your angels round about me." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. That this morning we were coming up through here through the trees. And there's some lady pushing her kid with a, you know, a cart on the side of the road on this road. No lights, no stripes, no nothing. you know, if you're not paying attention. So, we are grateful this morning that God watches over all of us.

We can have so many problems in this world that we lose sight &gt;&gt; of the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated for just a moment. We have a couple announcements we wanted to make. Um good to see um everyone uh again this morning in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um our first announcement is that um we want to uh make sure that we uh keep this door to the side uh closed. We want to keep that closed during the services. um it can uh echo into the other rooms and from the other rooms it can come in disrupt the service and the actual live stream. So um we just want to try to use the back doors um you know quietly and that would be much appreciated. Um, and we want to welcome our visitor here in the back. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming and joining with us today. And may the Lord just bless you and meet with you personally is our sincere prayer from the church. Um, we welcome brother Bruce and sister Donna back. Amen. From their their trip. And um as we made mention before uh they uh just celebrated their 49th wedding wedding anniversary. Amen. Let's give them a a hand clapping. In fact, um so we have something. Oh, you &gt;&gt; Yeah. You're welcome from the whole church. Um, was it on Friday? Friday. &gt;&gt; Friday the 11th. Amen. July 11th. Well, it's a real great honor. &gt;&gt; It's a real great honor. And may the Lord just continue to bless them, keep them. We sure appreciate both Brother Bruce and Sister Donna here, the help they are to each and every one of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together for the reading of the word today. And we have some some visitors over here, some young visitors. We want to welcome them to the church, too. &gt;&gt; Yes. John chapter 8 for our opening scripture. John chapter 8. We did, as you're turning there, we did have a baptism on Friday. It wasn't here. was um our first one in the pond um this year. &gt;&gt; So, we're grateful to the Lord for that. It was someone that Brother Dennis Cosby had been working with for a couple years. &gt;&gt; Couple years. But, uh he's all he's in. &gt;&gt; He's in, you know, he's he's he's not just, you know, let's you know, get baptized, but he's in. &gt;&gt; He's in. He's accepted the message. He He sees the light and what a beautiful thing it is. Before we read this verse here, let's look to the Lord in prayer. Our heavenly father, we thank you for you in each one of our lives. Where would we be today without you? We certainly would not be here today. And we we we wouldn't have a desire to go uh in a rapture. Neither were we have a vision or a light how to make it into the rapture. But Lord, you have showed us the way. And God, we're grateful to that for that uh this morning. And we thank you that we could come into your house and to worship you and just to to be real with you. And we ask God that you would look down upon each one of us. We all have different needs, Lord. Some of us are perhaps afflicted or sick. &gt;&gt; Lord, we're thankful for the testimony for our sister Jeanie. &gt;&gt; Lord, perhaps um some of us here are are feeling um like they just need a dose of the Holy Ghost this morning. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, there may be someone that just uh tired and they just need strength just to be able to enter into the word. May you bless them, &gt;&gt; Lord. Many needs represented, but you're a God that can meet every one of them, and you care about every one of them. And Lord, we're bowing in faith in this prayer, believing that you'll meet our needs this morning. Please bless the reading of your word and the ministry thereof. May our ears uh be prepared to hear our hearts prepared to receive. And may you help this uh unworthy vessel, Lord, to step out of the way that you may speak. Feed your bride this morning. We give you the praise for these things in advance. In the precious name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. St. John chapter 8, we're going to read one verse there. Verse number 12. Then spake Jesus again unto them, saying, I am the light of the world, and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May God bless you. May be seated. &gt;&gt; Um, we want to la last week we we or last service we spoke on walking into the light. And um this morning we want to speak on light up others. &gt;&gt; Light up others. And I got just a couple quotes I'm going to read here. Brother Bren says in in the message at thy word. He says, "A person who lives their life for themsself lives a selfish life." &gt;&gt; He says, "We must live for others. bear ye one another's burden and so fulfill the law of Christ. &gt;&gt; We've got to have a feeling for one another. Now, I think what's important when we're when we when we we come to church, we're hearing uh the word of God is that we really want to take inventory of oursel, right? Because um that's the only way we can be helped, right? Is when we look at ourselves, what our need is. &gt;&gt; I tell you, none of us want to live a selfish life. &gt;&gt; Amen. We all want to live for others, but it is easier said than done. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother B, can I say an amen on that? &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to make all of you come up and sit in this front row together. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham said in the message that that day on Calvary, he said, "What is crucified with Christ mean?" What does that crucified with Christ? It is to live for others. &gt;&gt; What kind of others? those who hate you, &gt;&gt; those who wouldn't like you, those who would make fun of you, live for them, be with them, love them, pray for those who despitefully use you, and say all manner of evil falsely for my name's sake. They persecuted the prophets which were before you. Right? &gt;&gt; And in the message uh that day on Calvary, brother Bram says, "Now the first thing I want to say is that Jesus never lived for himself. &gt;&gt; His life was spent for others. That's perfectly eternal life." Think about that. When you live for others, that's perfect eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you say you go to church and you do good things, that's fine. But when you live your life to yourself, you haven't eternal life. &gt;&gt; Wow, that's a strong one. &gt;&gt; Eternal life is living for others. &gt;&gt; It proved that when come in the lamb of God, he lived and had eternal life because he did not live for himself. He lived for others. And you receive eternal life by receiving that day. And you don't live for yourself no more. You live for others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Calvary opened the door for us to receive God. Without Calvary, there is no way that God could have came inside and lived inside of us &gt;&gt; because of our nature. But being that he paid the price for our sin and we repented of our nature, that opened the door to say, "I can come in you now." &gt;&gt; Amen. and and the nature can be changed and all a sudden we're not selfish anymore. We're not thinking about ourel anymore. We're we're we're we're thinking about helping somebody get into the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Jesus is the light of the world. Jesus said, "I am the light of the world." &gt;&gt; We learned that in him is no darkness at all. But if I could say this, that God is love, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; His love is light. We read in our opening verse that he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life. &gt;&gt; The light of life. So the scripture says he that loveth his brother abideth in the light. &gt;&gt; There's no occasion of of stumbling in him. There's none. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he's abiding in the light. And the light is the love of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Shed abroad in our hearts. We don't think about ourselves. We're living for others. &gt;&gt; But he that hateth his brother. &gt;&gt; He's abiding in darkness. &gt;&gt; So he's in darkness and he's walking in darkness. So hatred actually blinds you and you don't even you you you you don't even know what you're doing or what you're saying. The word is light. &gt;&gt; The word of God is light. I love that. Amen. The Bible says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path." &gt;&gt; So Christ is the light. The love of God is the light and the word is the light. &gt;&gt; First John 2:5 says, "But whosoever keepeth his word, in him verily is the love of God perfected." &gt;&gt; Amen. If you just keep the word, you know, when you think about love, it's okay, I'm associated. I got to, you know, be nice to somebody and it's it's how you But if you could just focus on living the entire word of God, you will automatically love others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hereby know we that we know him is when we keep his word. Jesus said, "If any man loves me, he will keep my words." Talking about that love relationship. Galatians 5:14, "For all the laws fulfilled in one word, even this, that thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So husbands are to love their wives like themselves &gt;&gt; and we as Christians are to love our neighbor as our as thyself. &gt;&gt; So we just need the love of God to do these things. That's right. &gt;&gt; For we see that the word of God and the love of God is exactly the same thing. You can't separate them. &gt;&gt; We can't just say, "I love God." But I know I don't. The word isn't that important to me. The Bible's No. If you love God, you read the Bible. &gt;&gt; If you love God, you read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because that's who God is. First John chapter 1 verse one says, "In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God." You know, we we read um St. John 3:16, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son." For God so loved the world that he gave his word. That's who the only begotten son was was the word. He He so loved you and I that he gave the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. that whosoever believed the word &gt;&gt; shall not perish because the word is a person. &gt;&gt; It is God. It isn't something wrote about a person. This is God. &gt;&gt; So in the beginning was the word. The word was was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything that uh that anything made that was made. In him was life, and the life was the light of men. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the light shineth in darkness, which was &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; we're darkness, right? Before we come to Christ, and the light shineth in darkness, and the darkness comprehended it not. I remember when I was first introduced to the truth. To me, it just seemed so foreign. I'm sorry. I wasn't raised in it. I I wasn't taught it. I It just I just knew the Bible was it was was was God's book and and God um was was was real. The the the book was true and that's about all I knew. But it was it was a natural comprehension. It wasn't even by revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when I was being introduced to all these things, uh uh there was something in me that didn't comprehend it &gt;&gt; and I I had to like pray about it and and and let it come in and and begin to to to to communicate to me. How many times you ever hear something from the word of God and say, "I don't know. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about." That's darkness, not comprehending it. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the Holy Ghost says amen to every word of God. &gt;&gt; There was a man sent from God whose name was John. The same came for a witness to bear witness of the light that all men through him might believe. Now he was not that light. Either are we but was sent to bear witness of that light. &gt;&gt; Understand the difference. It was the light that was was in him in us. But God is the true light. That was the true light which lightth every man that cometh into the world. &gt;&gt; He was in the world and the world was made by him and the world knew him not. He came to his own and his own received him not. But as many as received him. That's all we got to do is re be true about it. &gt;&gt; Receive him. To them gave he power to become lights. Amen. &gt;&gt; To become light sons of God, even to them that believe on his name, which were not born not uh which were born not of blood, not of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. We want to keep it simple. &gt;&gt; We just want to submit to obeying the word of God. And we're we're literally witnessing the new birth when we do that. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know pe people in the in the fact that we become born again that is a mystery &gt;&gt; but how to become born again is extremely simple. &gt;&gt; You come to church you hear the word being preached and you say I want to live that and you walk out those doors and you put your heart into living that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are experiencing in real time the new birth in your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not some feeling that comes and bounces on you and makes you dance and and and and you feel different. I mean, those are blessings and we're thankful for them. And not that God can't do something during those times. But look, this new birth happens through a mutual agreement between you and God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you've got to take his word, which you know is true, and make it true in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 14, the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And I believe God wants to make it flesh again in us. Amen. Our opening scripture, I am the light of the world, and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. Now, we were all born in darkness, &gt;&gt; raised in darkness. Darkness is all around us today. It's in our governments, our schools, our TVs, our phones, our music, &gt;&gt; the people we work with, our friends, our family, even darkness, gross darkness, has covered the world that we live in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John said in 1 John 2:16, "For all that is in the world," this is how he's describing the world. Now all that is in the world, not talking about governments and TVs. All that is in the world is the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life. &gt;&gt; It's not of the father, but is of the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, the Bible is describing the world as the nature of an unconverted soul. And basically it's the unconverted soul who just does what he wants to do. &gt;&gt; Lawless. Just whatever he feels, he just does. Nobody's going to tell me what to do. I'm going to do what I want to do. &gt;&gt; This is the world nature. Verse 17. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof. But here it is. But he that doeth the will of the father abideth forever. So there there it is. &gt;&gt; All you got to do is do what the word says. Care about what the word says for your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean don't don't don't try to leave the churches. I I I don't I just can't do this whole thing. &gt;&gt; Don't have that mentality. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have the mentality that God, you see my heart. I want to follow you. &gt;&gt; What is the first step you want me to take? I'm telling you, if you're going to walk here to the gas station down there to get a candy bar, you got to take your first step. &gt;&gt; Don't worry about your last one. &gt;&gt; Take your first one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then after you take your first one, then you take your next one. Verse 15 says, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the father's not in him. &gt;&gt; Now, this is pretty strong, but God draws a line between his will and Satan's will or man's will. &gt;&gt; There's a solid line, and he's not he's not going to cross it. God draws a line between his will and our will. Right. &gt;&gt; How many Okay, we've we've heard the story that, you know, many people would say to brother Brand or people would say to Brother Bren, "I love you." But he knew they didn't. &gt;&gt; How many people think How many people do you think tell think they love that they love God? They tell God they love him, but they don't. &gt;&gt; So, you know, God draws a line. We can't just you dive into our own nature and still hold on to God. &gt;&gt; God draws the line. The quicker we learn to draw the line, the better. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 55:8 says, "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, sayeth the Lord." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. So, I'm so glad we have the word of God to know the thoughts of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; These are the thoughts of God for every situation in every one of our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Personally, no matter what's happening in our life, this word has an answer for that situation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why we know God cares and he understands everything. &gt;&gt; And if we just spend time with him, he'll lead us in the right direction. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So God has drawn the line between his nature and the worldly nature inside of us. It's why we need to die daily. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Bingo. Right there. &gt;&gt; It we we if we don't die daily, that means the our our nature is going to get in the way with God. So, no matter how much God loves someone, he draws a definite line. He will not cross it. So, we have to be willing to say, God, I want to I want your word. I want all of your word. I care about all your word. I haven't been caring about your word, but I care now about all your word, and I'm going to step into that. I'm not going to just depend on going to church as if that is all I need to do. It's not all you need to do. You need to take the word, the inspiration, the message that's being given at church, take it home, and apply it in your lives. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:5 says, "For they that are after the flesh, they do mind the things of the flesh, but they that are after the spirit, the things of the spirit. For to be carnally minded is death, but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Show them the difference now. Because the carnal mind is is emnity against God. &gt;&gt; For it is not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be. So then they flesh cannot please God. How many times have you ever said something, you knew it was wrong, but you didn't care at that moment that you said it. &gt;&gt; And you had this attitude of I just don't care. At that moment is emnity right there between you and God. &gt;&gt; God draws that line. You're in the flesh. You're not pleasing God. That mind can come at any time and trick us even though we're Christians. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? That's why we need that's why we need to walk in the spirit, not fulfill the lust of the flesh and and and allow God to have his way in our life. Now, God himself is speaking to the devil here in Genesis 3:15. He's speaking to the devil and the seeds of his nature that would grow after him. So, I just want to get like a little background here of this this nature. And in Genesis 3:15, God says uh to the devil, "And I will put enmity," that same word again, that that means hostility and hatred, between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed, and eventually it shall bruise thy head, and thou uh and it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. So, we know this is a the prophecy of Christ bruising Satan's head at Calvary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we see God is speaking to the devil himself. &gt;&gt; Speaking to a spirit. And we know uh Ezekiel in 8:13 says, "Thou has been in the Garden of Eden." Revelations 12:9. and that great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we know that uh the the the devil's called a serpent, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And that he was in the garden. And so, we've got scriptures for this. But God was also speaking to the most subtle beast of the field when he said these words in verse 15. We know that because of the verse, the Lord God said unto the serpent, because thou has done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, above every beast of the field, and upon thy belly thou shalt go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, he's speaking to both. &gt;&gt; He's speaking to the to the most subtle beast. We'll just call him a person at this for a second. He's speaking to him, but he's also speaking to the devil inside of him because they became one. &gt;&gt; They became one. And this outside person, he was literally turned into a snake. &gt;&gt; I I mean, I don't want to go preach the serpent seed right now, but that's what happened. And those of you that believe, we should just say amen right now so we can continue on here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we need to remember this. The two had become one. &gt;&gt; The most subtle beast and the devil had become one. They became united with one purpose. This is why it's important that we make sure what spirit is anointing us. &gt;&gt; Because whom you yield yourself servant to obey his servant you'll be. Right. &gt;&gt; And when we become one with the devil's will or his nature, this will always put hostility and hatred between us and the nature of God. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And those who have God's nature. You understand sometimes why there's bickering and fighting and things like that. &gt;&gt; Because there's two spirits. &gt;&gt; Now, I know um the devils, you know, want to get people fighting. I understand that. &gt;&gt; But just because you're standing for the truth doesn't mean the devil's gonna say, "It's okay. You just you be a good boy. You be a good girl." He's not going to do that. &gt;&gt; He's going to try to get you riled up. &gt;&gt; But you can't become one with a wrong message from the enemy, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Because then you you'll have this purpose to do ill. And you don't want that. The first nature that we're born with is a beastly nature. Nature, &gt;&gt; the most subtle beast united with a human being and were born by a a a beastly nature because of that union. Everyone was born in sin shapen in iniquity. I'll say it like this. Everybody was born either by a sexual act of pleasure or born by the will of their mother or father. And you want me to say that again? &gt;&gt; Well, then let's say amen. &gt;&gt; Let's say amen to the word. &gt;&gt; And you know what it did? It produced a hybrid nature &gt;&gt; that knows to do good but chooses to do what it wants to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, as the Bible says, alive but really dead in sins and trespasses. Amen. &gt;&gt; And that's why Christ, the word, the light of God with whom there's no darkness, come to pay the price for our sins &gt;&gt; and allow the living word, which is the Holy Ghost to come and live inside of a person if they invite them in. &gt;&gt; Right? They got to say, "God, I want you more than I want this ugly old nature." &gt;&gt; And you have to come to grips with that because inside of us, every one of us love doing the things in the world, and it was hard to give them up. Yes. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen. That's that's the honesty. And even to this day, there's things that creep in and we want to hold on to them. &gt;&gt; And and we've got to be one with God and say, "Not my will, thy will be done." And the Holy Ghost will come into our lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the only way we're going to make it into that rapture that we're going to fly away is get so full of God that when he comes, he's going to come for his own. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now that Holy Ghost, it needs to be living inside of us. Why? It is the only thing that'll kill the devil inside of us. &gt;&gt; It is the only thing that'll stomp out the nature of the devil. We can do all we can to try to be a better person and, you know, discipline ourselves, but if we don't have the Holy Ghost inside of us, it will be fruitless. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the only thing that would destroy the works of the devil. And 1 John 3:8 says, "For this purpose, the son of God was manifested that he might destroy the works of the devil." Notice if the spirit of God would have remained in heaven, there is no way that he could have destroyed the works of the devil because the word was that the day you eat is the day you die. That's right. &gt;&gt; He had to come in the form of the flesh to pay the penalty and it destroyed the works of the devil that he could no longer the devil could never no longer hold us in hell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That that we're we're we're set free because God was manifested in the flesh. &gt;&gt; I'll tell you when God becomes manifested in our flesh, it'll destroy the works of the devil inside our nature. We'll have the nature of God Amen. &gt;&gt; It's real saints. &gt;&gt; Turn with me if you would to Ephesians 2 verse one. When we were out in the world, we were doing the things of the world. And by the grace of God, he came and spoke to us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ephesians 2:1. And you have he quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins. where in times past you walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit that now is working is still here. &gt;&gt; Where is it at? is in those children who are being disobedient among whom also we all had our conver our conversations in times past in the lust of the flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and where by nature just by nature the children of if I don't get what I want I'm going to show you &gt;&gt; the only thing you're going to show me &gt;&gt; is the devil &gt;&gt; that's the only thing you're showing me &gt;&gt; but God who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us. &gt;&gt; Even when we were dead in our sins have quickened us together with Christ by grace are you saved. Now we're laying this foundation because when we were dead in sins, God came and he loved us. He quickened us and he showed us the way out. Well, when Christ comes and lives inside of us, he will do the exact same thing to somebody else that he did to you. &gt;&gt; But he's going to use your body to get in there and reconcile somebody that's in sin back to him. &gt;&gt; Because it's the same God that yesterday, today, and forever. He's not going to stop with you and say, "Okay, you're taken care of. You're going to heaven, and I don't need you anymore. You can go do what you want to do." That is not the nature of God. &gt;&gt; God called us and we followed him unto &gt;&gt; unto justification, sanctification, and the baptism of the Holy Ghost. And Jesus said in Matthew 19:28, he said, "Verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration, the regeneration. When the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, you know, when we're raptured out of here, he shall also sit upon the 12 tribes uh the 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and everyone." Now he expresses what you got to do to get through this regeneration here. And everyone that have forsaken houses or brethren or sisters or father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a hundfold and shall inherit eternal life. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, brother John, that is not when I read when when I read he that believeth in baptiz is saved. That's not I didn't read that in there. I think this is a different doctrine. No, but to truly believe in Christ is to believe the whole word. &gt;&gt; You don't leave anything out. &gt;&gt; You leave part of it out, you leave your part out of the book of life. You add to it, then you're adding to the plagues that are going to come upon you. &gt;&gt; I'll say it like this. You you fathers, you mothers, and I'm talking about even you children. When you set an example before somebody that you know is not the word, you're adding a plague to your life. &gt;&gt; Spirits. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; We've got to, you know, we if we don't take the word of God serious, &gt;&gt; it's only going to hurt us. It &gt;&gt; it's going to hurt us because God ain't going to change his word for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; So true. &gt;&gt; So God wooing us closer every day to follow him. Follow the the the light of God's word. Amen. He said, "I am the light of the world, and he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, shall not walk in hatred, shall not walk in in the things of their their desires, but they shall have the light of life." Now, the only light of life that I know, brother Dennis, is eternal life. &gt;&gt; Eternal life is light. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, on the day of judgment, you know what's going to be there judging all of us? &gt;&gt; The light of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what's going to be there. &gt;&gt; Now, when we truly follow Christ, we are actively becoming more like him. &gt;&gt; Amen. So what I mean by that is you're putting forth effort to become like him &gt;&gt; and other people see it. They say things about it because they notice it. Our lives begin to testify that we're following Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus himself said, "By the manifestation of perfect love shall all men know that you're following me, &gt;&gt; that you're my disciple, that you're walking in the light, &gt;&gt; you're loving the whole word because you're able to love others." &gt;&gt; And that's what it means to truly follow Christ. It's not um well, I belong to this church &gt;&gt; or I go to church or I pay my tithe. That is not following Christ. That's just part of what needs to be done. But there's a relationship and if that relationship doesn't get settled and and and be lived on on a daily basis, we've missed it. &gt;&gt; We've missed it. And I'll tell you, it isn't that we that that it isn't because it wasn't preached here. It's because the flesh did not want to submit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It the the the desire did not want to submit to the word. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, as God's followers, we press in to become more and more like him every day. As brother Dennis would say, he says that often in our men's meeting. 2 Corinthians 5:17. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he all things are passed away. He's a new creature. Behold, all things are passed away. Uh I'm so I'm going to read that the right way instead of the wrong way four times. Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature. &gt;&gt; Old things, old nature are passed away. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Behold, all things are become new because God is inside now. &gt;&gt; And he wants everything different than the way that we want it. and all things are of God. Who has reconciled us or changed us mutually. That's what that word means. In other words, he's not a he don't got robots. He don't come in your life and just shake you up and you you better listen to me. No. He comes and he knocks on the door of our heart. &gt;&gt; Says, "Would you like &gt;&gt; to have a relationship with me? &gt;&gt; This is what I'd like you to do first. &gt;&gt; Just do this." He would never put anything on us that we couldn't bear, right? Many things to tell you, but you can't bear it now. But he doesn't throw it all on one time. But if you don't do what Lord, he's asking you to do, he's not going to be able to take you to the next step. Yes. &gt;&gt; So he's reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given us the ministry of reconciliation. So we have changed together. It's been a mutual agreement. I desired. I sought the change. I paid the price. And God said I will come and do the work in you. Right? It's not by works that we have done. Right? It's by a submission to what he's asked us to do. &gt;&gt; Right? He if he asks us to repent, we repent. If he asks us to to to to to make things right with our brother, our we make things right. Whatever God asks us to do, we do it. You know, a lot of times we we we we act like we're a judge over things. Like this is not important. I don't need to do that. This is all I need to do. &gt;&gt; Well, if you can find it in the word, believe it. But if you can't find that in the word, you shouldn't say that. Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, "Now the Lord is that spirit." Talking about changing mutually. Now, now the Lord is that spirit, and where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen somebody they were mad? Has anybody ever seen anybody mad? I need participation. and you try to say something or do something and they don't change, they still remain mad &gt;&gt; and you you kind of conclude there's not a whole lot you can do until they change. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And so you you don't feel at liberty to go there and have popcorn with them. &gt;&gt; Right. You you you just it it you you're you feel you feel there's something there. Well, when God comes and we don't give him liberty, come inside, Lord. I'm hungering for you today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He sees that that Brother Bam says there's like a a wolf nature that can get on us and he don't feel comfortable coming there. So he comes and he sits on &gt;&gt; a a pole or a line just waiting &gt;&gt; for us to change our minds. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there's got to be a mutual agreement in in the new birth. &gt;&gt; The new birth is not just something that happens with the turn of a calendar. No, you've got to have a desire. No matter how bad the preaching is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. No matter how bad the preaching is, you got to have a desire to be changed. &gt;&gt; And if you got to have music to feel good, we're not talking about the same thing. But because I'm not talking about emotion, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I'm talking about something that happens on the deep part of the soul. A desire that I want to be like Jesus when I get done. &gt;&gt; Something that's not here and there and back and forth and up and down. It's something that's steady Eddie. That's right. Amen. God reconciles us little by little as we give him liberty. Verse 18. But we all with open face, beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord, were changed into the same image from glory to glory, from experience to experience, from church service to church service, from prayer room to prayer room. Amen. &gt;&gt; From entering in the spirit to entering into the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even by the spirit of the Lord. So we come to church, we hear God's heart for our lives. We say amen. So be it for our lives. We leave the church and we begin to apply that word slowly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God sees that there's a mutual desire that you have. You are literally having the same desire that he just preached to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He sees that. And you know what he does? He then quickens the word in your life. And now you're living something you've never lived before. &gt;&gt; We've all experienced it. &gt;&gt; But God wants us to continue experiencing it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's more things because all things need to become God. Amen. &gt;&gt; I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. So, we're no longer walking in darkness, but we're walking in the light of God as he manifests himself out of us. Jesus said, "As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world." But there came a time that Jesus said in Matthew 5:14, "That you are the light of the world." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Now, notice this. He didn't say somebody else is the light of the world. He said you. Right? &gt;&gt; I'll say it like this. If God was here and he spoke this word, you are the light of the world. At this point, you cannot look to anybody else in this room except yourself for that responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the You are the light to get us out of here. &gt;&gt; You are the light to get your family out. Amen. &gt;&gt; You're the light to get your your co-workers out, &gt;&gt; your your neighbors, your friends. You are the light. Well, they won't listen to me. Tell them anyways. &gt;&gt; Tell them anyways. &gt;&gt; You're not responsible for them to receive it. You're only responsible to shine it. &gt;&gt; Shine it. You're the light of the world. A city that a city that is set on hill cannot be hid. So, you're going to tell me you got the light of God and other people around you aren't going to see it. &gt;&gt; If it's in there, it's coming out. &gt;&gt; The only way it's not going to come out is it's not in there. &gt;&gt; Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel. I'm a Christian, but you know, I'm not going to bring it out right now because I know you know how I know how they'll react. but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. &gt;&gt; Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven. Now notice it says your good works. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; you're joining together with God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, when somebody's in darkness, they don't know it's God in you, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; So, when you when you do this good work, this good deed, this this love, this forgiveness, this prayer, or whatever you're doing with them, when you do that, all is they're seeing is your good works. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember when they looked at when Peter and and John they prayed for the the man at at the gate called beautiful and he got his sight. &gt;&gt; The Bible says they took note that these men had been with Jesus. &gt;&gt; And when you you you are doing the works of Christ, he that believeth on me, the works I do, he shall do also. When you're doing those works, others are going to see Christ in you. &gt;&gt; They're say, "I never seen that before. I've never seen somebody love and forgive me like you do." What? What? What is that? &gt;&gt; Now your door's open. &gt;&gt; Tell them about Jesus. &gt;&gt; And your motive for doing good works in front of others is what the scripture tells us right here. We just read it. What is our mo What is our motive? &gt;&gt; So God can get glory through your works. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot of times we do things and we want people to look at us. &gt;&gt; Look what I did. Look at me &gt;&gt; like it's not about you. &gt;&gt; It's about Christ in you loving others. You're reconciling others to to Christ. You're not reconciling others to you. &gt;&gt; So let your light so shine. That word shine means to give light to beam it with radiant brilliancancy. Wow. I'll tell you what, if you were going to buy a light and it said it it beams with radiant brilliancancy, what are you going to think when you first read that? When you first hear about that, you're going to think, "Do I want this room to be that bright? Is it going to blind my eyes?" Right? &gt;&gt; So, let your light so shine that it's beaming out, &gt;&gt; right? Not. Well, I got to check out the waters here. &gt;&gt; Beam it. &gt;&gt; Let others know that's the way to shine. &gt;&gt; Not everyone is going to see the light. &gt;&gt; Not everyone is going to walk in the light as he's in the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But God still wants us to beam it out. 2 Corinthians 4:3 says, "But if our gospel be hid, it is hid to them that are lost." &gt;&gt; In other words, there's nothing you can do about it. &gt;&gt; Do Do you think that Jesus could convert any of the devils back to angels? Do you think we can convert someone who sold out to the devil? &gt;&gt; I mean, everybody's not going to see the light. &gt;&gt; But guarantee God knows those that are his. &gt;&gt; He does. He's not going to lose one. They're in the palm of his hand. But we need to understand if our gospel is hid to somebody, it's hid to them that are lost. in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which what believe not. &gt;&gt; Lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who's in the image of God should shine unto them. &gt;&gt; For we preach not ourselves but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake. In other words, it's not about us. It's about others and we're trying to get others to Christ, reconciling them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse number six. For God who commanded the light to beam out his light with radiant brilliancancy to shine out of darkness has shined in our heart. So why did God come into our heart? Why did he shine that light in there? to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God called us out of sin. We saw the light. We begin to read the Bible more. We begin to read the message more. &gt;&gt; We begin to feed. &gt;&gt; We begin to get the knowledge, the true knowledge of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we begin to walk in it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's no good to read it if you don't walk in it. &gt;&gt; In fact, you're in worse shape if you read it and you don't walk in it. &gt;&gt; The Jes Bible says it'd be better if they have not known the way of the Lord than to know it and to turn it down. &gt;&gt; God doesn't give us light just for ourselves alone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Or so we can judge others with it. &gt;&gt; Right. I got this. I got this light now. Now I can judge others. &gt;&gt; Or I got this light now. It's all for me. It's not for either of those. &gt;&gt; God gives us the light to give it to others, to help others, to live for others, to save others, to reconcile others, to himself. &gt;&gt; Somebody gave us the light. Somebody came by and gave us the light. Every one of us sitting here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We weren't alone. Jesus appeared in the room. &gt;&gt; He chose the foolishness of preaching to save men. &gt;&gt; And God wants to continue on that process to get others saved to use us. &gt;&gt; But if we're just caught into this this religion of just me and God, just me and God. No, it's it's it's you doing what God wants you to do to help others. &gt;&gt; You know, you if we don't have a burden for others, &gt;&gt; and you're and you're telling me Christ is there, I mean, Christ today, he's still in the same mindset that he was on the day of Calvary. &gt;&gt; Very true. &gt;&gt; These many years later, he still cares about the person that's living today that don't have him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's looking for somebody that will be be a vessel to shine the light to them, &gt;&gt; to be a light to them. And you know, you do that by actually living something different than everybody else does in the world. Right. &gt;&gt; It ain't the knowledge. Ain't you got more knowledge. &gt;&gt; Your your knowledge ain't that's not it. &gt;&gt; There's a lot of people out there that don't know Christ that probably know more about God or know more about this book than we do. &gt;&gt; But I'll say it like this. It's got to be a life that nobody else lives. &gt;&gt; Something's got to attract them. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now look, verse 7 says, "But we, the Sendelite church, but we have this treasure in our hearts, in our earn vessels." &gt;&gt; We have Christ. It's a treasure in our earn vessel that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you got the Holy Ghost, it's of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when the Holy Ghost isn't doing it, there ain't much power there, by the way. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise God. I feel like preaching now. &gt;&gt; We are troubled on every side. Now, look, look what the power is going to do inside. We are troubled on every side, yet not distressed. &gt;&gt; We're perplexed, but we're not in despair. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We're even persecuted, but we're not forsaken. We're cast down but not destroyed. &gt;&gt; So you you see we have a treasure, a power inside of us. Yes, our outside vessels, they're going through all these things, but the treasure inside of us is what keeps us steady, Eddie. &gt;&gt; It's what keeps us going. How many, you know, we need to thank God for the keeping power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Keeps us through that stuff. &gt;&gt; Now, what's happening in our life? Verse 10 says, "Always bearing about in our earth and vessel, our body, now the dying of the Lord Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies." Now, we sing that song, must Jesus bear the cross alone. &gt;&gt; We know the scripture, I am crucified with Christ, I die daily. Amen. &gt;&gt; We got these scriptures and we must all if we if we don't feel a pain in dying, &gt;&gt; I doubt whether there's going to be very much life coming forth. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; It it says always. Always. That is that what your Bible says? Always bearing about in our body the dying of the Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the life also of Jesus might be made manifest. for which for we which live are always delivered unto the death for Jesus' sake. In other words, have you have you have you ever done something and you you say when you done it, I can't believe I just did that. &gt;&gt; I can't believe I just said that. And you realize that was not the right thing to do. That was bad. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Am I just speaking about myself? &gt;&gt; Okay. But at that point, I wasn't We weren't bearing about in our body the dying. We weren't dying out. &gt;&gt; How many times you just want to show somebody how great you are? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; I I want I want you to know, you know, that it was me that did that. You know what I'm talking about? &gt;&gt; So, at that point, there's you're there's no you haven't died at that moment. &gt;&gt; You're still a Christian, still go to church, but your vessel got lent over there, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And you wanted some of the glory. You wanted you wanted people to look at you or or or or you're trying to be funny or or or whatever it might be, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And the thing is, we must always be about dying. We must. That's the only way the life of Christ is going to come forth. For we which live are always delivered unto the death for Jesus' sake. That the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in what? Our mortal flesh. Not when we get to the other side, but right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the conclusion here in verse 12. So then death works in us, but life in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what does that mean? I I've come, brother Ron. I I'm going to reconcile. &gt;&gt; We're going to we're going to die out. Death is going to be in us so we can give life to somebody. &gt;&gt; Death is working in us. We don't get to do our will, but we're we're going to live for others. Life is going to come for others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you we got to have the mindset of what our calling is. Right. &gt;&gt; It it you don't have to be called to to preach or do Sunday school, but you have to be called to give Christ to somebody who doesn't have Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; An ambassador. &gt;&gt; Let's drop down to verse 17. And it's hard to do, right? It's hard to do this, right? To live for others. &gt;&gt; We're encouraged here in verse 17. For our light affliction, notice, our light affliction, which is but for a moment, workketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory. &gt;&gt; Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; While we look not at the things which are seen, &gt;&gt; but the things which are not seen. &gt;&gt; For the things which are seen are they're temporal. &gt;&gt; Amen. But the things which are not seen are eternal. &gt;&gt; We need to look at everything through eternal lenses. &gt;&gt; Eternal lenses. Set your affections on things above and not the things of the earth. Amen. Philippians chapter chapter 2. You know the same same stuff is happening. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm talking about. Time is just going by too quick. Lord, help us. Lord, help me. Lord, help your people to be able to sit just a little bit longer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know that it's it's 69 in here, but I'm sweating. Terrible. All right. Philippians 2:12. This is I'm going to tell you this whole message was because of this verse came to my heart, you know, through the week. So, I want to get to this. Wherefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. &gt;&gt; Remember the day you gave your heart to the Lord? &gt;&gt; Remember the tears? &gt;&gt; Remember that? Oh, God, I just I want to be pleasing. I want to make it. &gt;&gt; That's right. I think the fear of God is the beginning of all wisdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I I think we just need to keep that with us. We don't want to get we don't want to get lukewarm like leodysa. &gt;&gt; Now notice, for it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. So we do all things without murmurings and disputings, that you may have a testimony, that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God. Now notice this. Blameless and harmless. Now who's that for? Who's that verse for? Is this is this Who's this verse for? &gt;&gt; One, two, three, four. &gt;&gt; Okay. If it's for you, you've got to take the responsibility of it. &gt;&gt; This is what's beautiful about this. that you may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom you shine as lights in the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a difference between you and somebody that murmurss and complains and backbites and says something negative. holding forth the word of life that you that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I may that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain. I mean, there are people we know that have come into the light, that have come into the truth, you know, perhaps by you that went back out into the world, &gt;&gt; and I'll say it, it was it's vain for them. &gt;&gt; Right? Because they didn't stay with it. &gt;&gt; But for those that stay with it, praise God, it'll be worth it all. &gt;&gt; Now, we know the days that we're living in the church condition. This know also that the last days perilous times shall come. For men shall be lovers of their own self, covetous, boasters, proud blasphemers, disobedient to parents unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, truth breakers, false accusers, incontinent, fierce, despisers of those that are good, traitors, heady, high-minded, lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God, having a form of godliness. And what is our job? to turn away from them having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from such turn away. That's the condition of Leodysia. &gt;&gt; This is the condition of the worldly church member in Leodysia. It's the nature. Notice he's talking about the nature. &gt;&gt; Amen. But we also live in a perverse nation and not only a perverse nation but a perverse planet &gt;&gt; where women want to be men and men don't even want to be men. Sodom and Gomorrah beastality and popilia you know the word. And you know what it is? Where 18-year-olds can physically alter their gender. The world we're living in where men and women can divorce for no reason. &gt;&gt; In every in the United States, all states permit no fault divorce, meaning a spouse can obtain a divorce without proving the other spouse has did anything wrong. You know, you we've heard of no fault insurance, right? &gt;&gt; Well, no fault divorce. &gt;&gt; Hey, just there's not one bit of scripture to back that up. &gt;&gt; There's only one scripture that allows for divorce. Does anybody know what that is? &gt;&gt; Somebody knows your scripture. It's not adultery. &gt;&gt; Adultery is is not the reason. &gt;&gt; It's fornication. Matthew 19:3, the Pharisees also came unto Jesus, and what were they doing? tempting him, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; "And saying unto him, is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause?" &gt;&gt; Verse seven. And the Pharisees asked Jesus, "Why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away?" And he saith unto them, Moses, because of the hardness of your heart, &gt;&gt; suffered you to put away your wives. &gt;&gt; But from the beginning, it was not so. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So just like today in this perverse nation that we live in today, no fault divorce, no fault insurance. &gt;&gt; It's there because of the hardness of the people. The people want it. Why do we got abortions? Because the people want it. No different. And I say unto you, whosoever shall put away his wife, except it be for fornication, &gt;&gt; and shall marry another, committh adultery. &gt;&gt; And whosoever marrith her that is put away committh adultery. And his disciples said unto him, I if if the case of a man be so with a wife, it is not even a good thing to get married. You know there come that time where you just want to like I want to get married. I want to get married so bad. I want to but he saith unto them all. All men cannot receive the same say they to whom it is given. &gt;&gt; Jesus said I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life. In other words, we become the light of Christ to the world. Doing what? Living for others. Getting our vessels to be joint with Christ. Just as Satan was became joint with the most subtoast and the most I'll say it like this, the most subtaste lent his body over. &gt;&gt; And they became one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; We do the same thing, but it's only to Christ. We lend our body over to Christ, the Holy Ghost, and we let him use us. And we become conscious of what we're doing. We're conscious of Jesus said, "You don't take my life. I lay it down consciously. I know that I'm giving myself to others." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you become one. &gt;&gt; Amen. 2 Corinthians 5:18, God have given us the ministry of reconciliation to that God was in Christ, reconciling the world to himself, not imputing their trespasses unto them, and have committed unto us the word of reconciliation. It didn't stop with Christ. Now it's Christ in us. Now then, we are ambassadors for Christ as Christ as through as though God did beseech you by us. Amen. We pray you in Christstead be reconciled. So as ambassadors we go to people and we teach as Jesus said teaching them to do all things whatsoever I've commanded you. You read in the Bible that this is what God's will is and you share it with somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You share it with them. &gt;&gt; You don't cram it down their throat, &gt;&gt; but you share it with them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Knowing the terror of the Lord, we persuade men. &gt;&gt; There's got to be that burden that look, if you turn this down what I'm telling you, &gt;&gt; you're turning down eternal life. There will be a day where I will see you no more. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you're you're put in a a pickle with knowing something they don't know &gt;&gt; that this is a real serious situation &gt;&gt; and you got to get the truth across to them. &gt;&gt; And and and I I tell you the greatest thing you do is lay down your life and live for them. &gt;&gt; Let them see that you have a greater power inside of you that you don't have to live for yourself anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you've been set free from yourself. &gt;&gt; Now your life is being lived for others. &gt;&gt; Amen. I just have a couple more quotes I want to read and then we're finished. Amen. And that day on Calvary, Brother Ram says, "Someone said, "How can you stand and let somebody call you such bad names?" Brother Ram says, "You don't live for yourself, you live for others. that you might redeem that man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You become sons. And the trouble of it is the church has forgotten. They were sons. &gt;&gt; You're a son. You're a daughter. &gt;&gt; You're taking Christ's place. Remember ambassadors. You're a son. So don't live for yourself. Live for others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, faith in the son of God. Brother says so such day I want to live. So each day he said so each day I want to live not for myself. If I live for myself I live a selfish life. If I I want to live for others and give what strength I have not to myself and to my own pleasures &gt;&gt; but for the benefit of others &gt;&gt; that that'll build the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; Notice the motive of why we're supposed to be on the planet. &gt;&gt; One more quote, okay, and then we're done. Thank you for your patience. Brother Ram said the day that day on Calvary says would there be someone else he's at the end here making the call. He says I want to know him. I want this to be a day at Calvary for me. I'm sick. I'm tired. What's the use of me throwing around here and the very thing that I was born to do? I was born born to be a son of God. And here I am holding on to the things of the world. God, let me be crucified today. Let me crucify today myself and my ideas that I may live with Christ and live for others. No matter what they do to me to make fun of me, to persecute me and say all evil against me and the things, let me just humbly walk along and and be meek like a lamb like he did. And someday he promised to raise me up again at the last day. I'm looking forward to that day. He said, "Would there be someone would there be some more hands that would go up?" God bless you back there and you. All right, some God bless you. God bless you some more. Now before we pray, let's stand together. The desire to to to be like Jesus, to really be like Jesus, we got to give up oursel, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We can't be like Jesus and hold on to oursel. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I'm so glad that he's made a way for us. We are now the light of the world. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's sing that little chorus. We are the generation. We are the generation. We're a chosen generation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are the generation. We're themination, the final voice. The world will hear. The coming of the Lord is near. Living out the revelation. Overcoming sins temptation. The truth will go to every tongue and nation. We are the chosen generation. We are the generation where the calmination, the final voice the world will hear. The coming of the Lord is near. Living out the revelation. Overcoming sin temptation. The truth will go to every tongue and nation. We are the chosen generation. Amen. Sing it with all your heart now. We are the generation. We're themination, the final voice the world will hear. The coming of the Lord is near. Giving out the revelation. Overcoming sins, temptation. The truth will go to every tongue and nation. We are the chosen generation. Amen. And I'm I am thankful. I I think about all the people in my family uh that I'm talking about from before me and um none of my family came in and that he chose me out of my brother, out of my dad, out of my mother. What a privilege. He's chose us &gt;&gt; with that choosing. Now there comes that responsibility &gt;&gt; to share it with others &gt;&gt; to shine that light because there's probably not probably there is somebody for all of us to speak to. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it may just be one in a family. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the the more serious we can get about that, the quicker we can get out of here. &gt;&gt; I can imagine Joshua and Caleb saying, "Let's get this thing going. I want my mountain." &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. Shine, Jesus.
