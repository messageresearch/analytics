TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] only believe all things are possible only believe now receive what he said only receive lord i receive all things are possible [Music] only receive oh may i receive lord i receive all things are possible lord i receive hallelujah isn't a good to receive already hallelujah god bless you brother hallelujah my forgetting to put the mic on i've put my jack and i'm like man i feel ready to go oh i wasn't so but by the grace of god we'll make it here i think so amen you love the lord today amen well you know what i guess uh you hundred some years ago they didn't have a microphone i just have to speak real loud anyhow so but we thank god for the ability to have a microphone and to stream the services and all these things and just anybody under the sound of my voice would like to greet you all thank god for this opportunity to be with you today and we just counted grand privilege uh if you uh if you would with me just let's bow our heads forward a prayer this morning and look to him heavenly father lord we thank you today as we bow our heads and our hearts and reverence to you lord we look down now towards the earth the dust from which we come knowing that we've come from that we must return these bodies they are not fit to live in forever but we thank you lord for a glorious resurrection for those that sleep in christ you've promised that they would rise first and thus which are alive and remain we'd be gathered together to meet you in the air these pesthouses these bodies that we live in with all their frailties and their faults and all the difficulties they give us one day these bodies shall be changed you shall change us from this vile body into a glorious body until likened unto your own and lord as we look unto you now we ask you lord that you just come and speak words of life because we believe that while we're even while we're in these bodies there's quickening power in the word of god today by the spirit of god that it would bring these mortal bodies as the prophet said throw them into subjection to the word lord the spirit of christ if that same spirit lives in us you promised it would quicken these mortal bodies and so i pray that quickening power today the same power that let us see your coming the same power that raised our lord jesus from the grave would speak now to each one lord bless us we pray father do exceeding abundantly above anything we could ask or think lord you know each situation in our lives those little things that lay there lord sometimes that maybe we don't even see i trust that by the word of god you'd come for your word as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it's quicker it's sharper than any two-edged sword and lord may you come and do that which only you can do and we thank you father we give you all the praise and glory and honor now for we ask all these things in jesus christ's name amen amen uh just take a moment here if you will and we'll look into the book of the hebrews the 13th chapter for a very lengthy reading of one verse you know i i was telling my wife uh you know i was kind of conflicted actually and sister and come back one of the sermon titles i said well i can't give it to you yet because i wasn't quite sure i just felt to go this way i trust to be a blessing to you and so i'm just kind of uh i'm a little out of sorts with it at the moment because i didn't know exactly which direction the lord wanted me to take but i trust this will be a blessing as i said hebrews 13th chapter 13th chapter we'll read the first verse and i'll have you be seated hebrews chapter 13 verse 1 says let brotherly love continue may the lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated if i could take for a very unoriginal title this morning let brotherly love continue we'll speak on that but uh i just uh i think it's important to make a point here you know i've been ministering for several years now i guess and whenever you get to speaking about divine love or brotherly love or whatever it's funny because usually some people have already checked out the door mentally at this point and it may seem like i have myself but i assure you i have not yet taken a leave of my senses i have my faculties i'm just trying to let the coffee kick in a little bit but uh you know you begin to preach about brotherly love or something and people they just kind of check out they say well you know clearly this sermon's about brotherly love and and caring for one another and you know that's just that's just not for me and i'm thinking well it probably is for you if you feel that way so hey man uh you know we're always looking for something that's great and it's supernatural and you know first of all i think it's important to ask you know what is supernatural we assign that term to so many things in our human thinking you realize god doesn't see things as supernatural he just sees them as him doing things because we we make that we look at our natural world we look at the natural order of things we we distinguish natural from supernatural but to god it's just god god the same god that made the natural losses the same one that breaks them or suspends them whenever he wants i should say so for him to part the water that's no harder for him than the rising of the sun or the grass that it's all god to him so we look at supernatural and you know sometimes we think supernatural maybe it's it's just a miracle only and of course the miracle is supernatural amen but we think about supernatural like we come to church and we're going to run around and shout well they do that at rock concerts and in one sense that is supernatural as well because it's the spirit that anoints them to do that that's spirits that anoint people so it's always spirits at play so what i want to really look at is not just supernatural and natural but the idea of of carnal and spiritual what is spiritual amen because sometimes what we look at is supernatural it could be the wrong kind of supernatural if you will so uh but people they shut down say well you know we want to see something supernatural we want to see something powerful and if you've ever if you've ever met someone in your life as a christian you've ever been persecuted if you've ever loved somebody that hated you and you were able to turn the other cheek i assure you that's supernatural you might not have seen any lightning you might not have seen an angel brush by you that day but to have a man you look at christ himself a man hanging on the cross despised and rejected by the world his own father as i preached last time i was here his own father had forsaken him and turned his face away and the earth had rejected him here's a man forsaken by everybody and yet he could look at those sinners he could look at those people say father forgive them for they don't know what they're doing now that didn't look like much to most of the people standing there but that was absolutely supernatural that a man could have that kind of love that that's the that's the the very god the very logos made flesh hanging there having a love for the people that rejected him so if you ever love somebody that hated you and you really love them with the love of god that is supernatural because your flesh can't do that on its own amen and so the reason i i felt to go this way and preach this and and i think about this many times and i think we see it in the world today the world testifies of it that this is the age where the love of many wax is cold and i say this because i'm convinced more and more as i go on as a as a christian you know the the reason people don't see god move in a greater way in their churches it's not a lack of faith we we tend to chalk it up to well you know if these people had more faith if they believed the word of god they'd see more miracles but i believe the faith of the the our apostolic fathers has been restored amen i believe that we can have faith to move mountains but not have charity and so i believe that the the reason that many times we don't see a greater manifestation of what we would call the supernatural or miracles or the the move of god in our lives it's not a lack of faith but it's a lack of love amen galatians 5 6 paul says for in christ in jesus christ neither circumcision availeth anything nor uncircumcision but faith which worketh by love so you can have all this faith bottled up and you have all these potentials but until there's a divine love that's projected there's no sovereign grace the sovereign grace is not able to take over until you project divine love that's up to you and i amen listen we know god loves the world we know god loves us but can god love the other person through you can you allow god to have that preeminence in your life because he's looking for a vessel to operate through amen brother braham says this and i think this is just marvelous he says this in 1955 the way to have fellowship he says listen just a moment he said i would rather have a church now think about this because sometimes we get up here well listen we gotta we gotta we gotta labor on this thought and this we need this brother bam says i would rather have a church that knows nothing about any spiritual gift and just be so in love with each other and with christ i'd rather have that than every spiritual gift operating in the church he said now that might sound hard in a pentecostal group we'll praise the lord well that's not our problem is it well it depends on the church you're preaching i guess he said that might sound hard in a pentecostal group but i would rather have it he says where there is gifts they'll fail where there's gifts will bring confusion where there's gifts they can be questioned but where there is love it is perfect that's right and then he makes this statement this is why i made what i said a moment ago he says and if you had perfect love you'd have perfect gifts that's right so work first with love that brings fellowship and fellowship brings gifts amen so i think many times we have we start with the wrong premise and then we're we're trying to produce something that's like what you need to do is have love for one another because listen if you really love that person and you go to praying for that person and their time they'll be a gift there somewhere for that person because god has already made a provision but can we have the right kind of attitude toward one another amen now we talk and hopefully we do anyway a lot about charity or agape love god's love because this is the capstone age amen we understand the prophet talks about this the adoption series that that perfect love that's the only thing that's in that place he saw beyond the curtain of time perfect love's the only thing he saw there and perfect love is the only thing that'll put you in that place amen so we believe in that but we look at the idea of brotherly love you say well this brotherly love it's something lesser well it's something different amen brother love is something different you know we look at the last church the philadelphian church age according to second peter the first chapter it is the is the church age of brotherly kindness and if you look in the greek it's the exact same word brotherly love brother it's philadelphia philadelphia church age it was the age of philadelphia of brotherly love amen so the same thing as far as the greek is concerned in that context and so why i say this is we understand that charity it's it's of a higher order than brotherly love because it's actually a gift to the church according to first corinthians the 13th chapter charity and faith and hope they abide forever amen but i want you to remember brotherly love is not to cease with the last church age any more than faith or virtue and knowledge in the very text i took let brotherly love continue so it's not to cease it's not to end amen and why i say all these things and why i'm kind of laying a foundation for a moment is you know sometimes brotherly love it looks kind of rough amen you know i i've had people say things before they say well you know these people at church they they care and they squabble on like their brothers or something and i'm like well it's because they're brothers that's why they do that you know if you've ever grown up in a family like brother bram talk about you grew up in a family with a lot of siblings guess what they fight a lot amen that's just the human condition but they're still siblings their disagreement doesn't change their relationship to one another amen and so i say this and i hope you can i hope you can rightly divide how i'm saying because you can go on on a limb with this but this is why i say all this sometimes it is easier to have love or mercy or compassion for a person you don't know you see what i mean when it's like i talk about with jesus you see a sinner in their condition maybe they're hostile to you maybe they've called you every kind of name they've rejected you but you know what the love of god he says well that person they don't know better they're they're a sinner and they need me to pray for him you turn the other cheek because you feel bad but when you know somebody and you know their fault you know there's that old there's an old saying familiarity breeds contempt have you ever heard that saying it's true many times there's a lot of truth to it when you're familiar with people you see the same people all the time you see their humanity you see their faults and their failures and you've got to maybe deal with them every day that can be much harder sometimes to be gracious to that person because you're sitting there going well they should know better i've told them 30 times why they're wrong they should know that i'm right right now and it becomes harder many times to have a care for that person than the person on the street because you know that person maybe too well maybe they know you too well you know you learn how to push one another's buttons you know exactly what to say to somebody amen and listen if we're not careful when you know somebody that's when it becomes very dangerous because you know how to when when you see a weakness or you see something in their life that's wrong you know what that is and if you don't have brotherly love you'll exploit that you see a lot of times in a marriage if two people you know uh this isn't marriage counseling but maybe this will help somebody i guess a lot of times in a marriage a relationship to people when they become adversarial toward one another most of the time in a marriage when when communication breaks down or something begins to happen the initial issue is the premise is completely wrong they begin to look at one another as adversaries well you know it's like i was talking to um i don't want to say too much i was talking to somebody one time about a certain situation their marriage and with their spouse they would do a certain thing i said well the reason they do this is because they feel this way and they don't want to tell you about it i said now listen if if you're that person's enemy you'll take advantage of that and you'll point it out and rub it in their face but if you love that person you'll recognize they're actually telling you they need help and you'll be gracious to them and so the entire basis is are we on the same page are we adversaries listen if we're brothers and sisters we're not looking to exploit one another's weakness we're not looking to take a situation and we see a weakness in one another's lives and and use it to our advantage and many times it plays out right in the church because one of us has to be right and everybody else has to be wrong and i think that many times is why there's such a breakdown in assemblies or churches or families or marriages they don't let brother love continue we get to know one another too well and that becomes the problem many times amen well listen if we're all i thought maybe we'd have more laughing we're all like man this guy's just laying out here heavy well that's we all we all fight with him listen even jesus and his disciples did it listen peter goes up to jesus one day and the bible says that peter rebuked jesus here's the lord this is jesus this guy has multiplied loaves and fishes he's raised the dead he's healed the sick he's open blinded eyes he tells the disciples you know what i'm going to go up to jerusalem and that and peter he the bible says he rebukes him oh lord you're not going to do that now i'm like man who are you we know we say who are we to tell the lord what to do well peter was so so familiar with jesus listen these guys spent every waking moment together they were just together all the time and peter rebukes him and the bible says jesus rebicked him right back satan get behind me listen it's just normal we can all lighten up a little bit i'm not here to condemn you i'm saying it's normal it's normal don't don't feel like you're oh well you know i just you know i there's this guy he just drives me nuts well listen there's there's people like that and you're gonna deal with them but your ability to love them anyway is what's gonna it's gonna make the difference because you probably do something praise the lord it's like another situation you know i was talking to a couple and the one the one come to me and said well you know you know this this that said do you think your spouse is hard to live with and and the person's like well yeah a little bit sometimes like well do you think that maybe you're hard to live with yeah i probably am even more exactly some somebody somewhere is forbearing with us probably not not me obviously but other people but you know you look even in the bible in the early church you look at the first six chapters of the book of acts when the church comes together and god pours out the holy ghost they're all together in one spirit and one accord even after the holy ghost falls in acts chapter two the bible said they contin they were continuing one accord and they were in singleness of heart and then one day there arose a murmuring among uh the different widows because they were neglected in the daily administration now listen that didn't de-christianize them because they had a complaint amen because sometimes people present that way well listen if you don't agree with me and you don't see it exactly the way i see it you're just not as spiritual as me you shouldn't be upset about that well they were upset about it you know what the disciples did they did something about it they didn't say well listen we these women ought to know not to complain they're just a bunch of women what are they not that's not what they did they said you know what we'll set some men over the church and we'll deal with it because sometimes the only way to deal with the situation is to bring it up in the first place so i i forget how it goes nicola machiavelli made a quote but he made he makes the point that the the best way to guard yourself against flattery is to let people know that you won't offend them with the truth amen if if we're not careful we present where we're always offended by everything well you shouldn't bring that up to me and you shouldn't complain if you cultivate that kind of attitude nobody will talk to you anymore so we don't want to we don't see because this and this is kind of the point i'm trying to build too you have to foster brotherly love you have to foster fraternity you have to work at it hey man it doesn't always seem supernatural but this is something you have to listen paul spends a great deal of time telling the ephesian church the most spiritual orderly church that was in the the first church age he speaks the ephesian church and he lets them know you husbands now make sure you love your wives amen your wives make sure you submit to your husbands why is he going to remind him this because the breakdown in the home the breakdown in our relationships is where satan wants to enter into the church that's why the prophet warns the church when something rises up you stick that much more close together it's not a matter of saying well i'll just go here and do my own thing or i'll go there the breakdown is going to affect our spiritual condition it's going to affect our ability to be used by god because we're going to begin to look at other people with the wrong kind of cynicism listen if somebody has a disagreement or whatever with you that doesn't make them not a christian or you a christian you're allowed to have disagreements and still come together listen they had a disagreement that didn't break their one accord their fellowship this is what i'm trying to say this idea of being in one accord it's not that we all agree on every little thing you know i think that fords are the best well you're an idiot well i think the chevys are the best i don't know who that is and i met one one time you know i could go on about ohio state michigan i'm not going to do that right now but the point is being a one of course not we agree on every single little thing we like the same food on our pizza that's not what it's talking about we can disagree we can see things different and still be one accord on the word it doesn't have to break our fellowship hey man we're not a bunch of cookie cutters we we do what they did there they they had an issue they sat down and worked it out now you say well again that doesn't seem real supernatural well i would tend to agree with you except we look at the society we live in today a people without natural affection they're incontinent they're fierce they're they're truce breakers they're despises the parents they're haters of things that are good we see the world in an insane condition and for you to have a what we would what was once called a normal you can't even call it normal now because that implies the rest is abnormal what is that normal it's not according to the plan of god we see breakdowns in homes and in brotherly kindness towards one another and then we wonder why the world's in a neurotic condition that's why it's there a breakdown even the natural affection toward one another amen i love how brother brown talks about it because he said you know then branhams he said you know we had some that were tall and some that were short and some that were fat and some were fit thin and when the brands got together in the backyard guess what they did they weren't roasting weenies on the grill they weren't cooking burgers for the fourth of july they were fighting with one another that's what they did when they got together why because they were family but guess what happened as soon as i went in the front yard he said you messed with one of them brandon said watch out so listen we can we can fight in the backyard that doesn't mean we're not family up front we're still family in the backyard and i i fear so many times we live in this we live in a society where we're so offended by everything and then we're offended that they're offended well these people praise the lord stay off social media you know you look at the political climate and everything has changed and all these people are offended by what's happened and then the christians are offended they're offended why do you care if they're offended they're always a listen we praise god well here i am i'm going off the rails we're just shooting from the hip now praise the lord amen listen we look at our society uh you know it's like i was talking to a brother one time we look at our society we look at the moral breakdown of our society and we look at how wayward this nation is from what it used to be and i agree it's awful i agree it's a bad thing but listen we're not the first christians to ever live in a godless nation can we get real for a second listen you look at the corinthian church corinth was the worst of the worst of the heathen world and there was people there that believed and we say well listen if i if the ten commandments aren't in the courthouse and i don't see i don't see churches everywhere this country's falling apart how am i gonna raise my children to serve god you're probably gonna have to raise them the same way they did back there you're probably gonna have to trust in god's grace that the mercy of god in your life is greater than the power of the world greater is he that's in you ah but the whole world is funneled by they don't believe anymore so what that shouldn't change where you stand well they took prayer out of our schools well don't let it take prayer out of your home it amazes me how many people i wish we had prayer in school you wanted to pray in your own house you wanted to sit down and pray with your kids you want the schools to do it for you that's what it is we want society to make it convenient for us to be christians that's not biblical everybody's a christian in that kind of condition that doesn't mean anything everybody has brother-in-law while we're on the same team and our team scores and praise god everybody can do that you used to amuse me when i was a kid i guess i'm on football now i'll use the nfl you know i remember when i was a kid and the packers were going to the super bowl my dad was a packers fan i didn't know he liked the packers he did that here everybody rallies around the champion oh yeah we're so great oh listen when we had we used to have the fire of god in this country we had to zoom the street and charles finney's and they're all gone can you can you serve god now when there's no no no government to prop you up i don't need the government listen i you i've been to countries and i've been near cut listen there are there are places in this world they will kill you for believing this bible there's places in this world that will put you in jail for even having a message book in your home and we act like we got so tough because they won't put our our favorite thing on tv or something i don't know why i'm going here all of a sudden we get so offended so easily by everything well listen these people are a bunch of sinners yeah that's what they had back there too i listen i understand this is the most deceitful wicked ages ever i totally get that but it's another thing when we sit here and we we nurture this idea that somehow we have to get everybody to see everything the way we want and then we'll serve god well if the pastor does it the way i want and if the church does it the way i want they preach it the way i want they sing the songs i want listen if that's all the deeper your commitment is to your family or your church or god you've got the wrong kind of commitment i'm not saying there's not issues to disagree about that you have to separate i'm not saying that but i'm saying we make mole hills in the mountains many times and we tend to make people well they're not as spiritual because they disagree with me well if you're really spiritual you'll love them anyway because when you're in the front yard i don't care how much you punch that guy in the face in the backyard hopefully you were hitting them more than you got hit as soon as you're in the front yard they come against one of you that come against all of us you want to touch my brother you want to come against my sister you have to go through me first i'm going to try to get back to my text here brother brown says in discernment of spirit again he says now they're talking about gifts again because i want to tie this into this idea of the supernatural as well but he says there's so much in the day we live and pertain to gifts so many people judge people by gifts that they have and they do it in churches oh listen he preaches this way and this guy's got this kind of gift and he's this kind of singer that's not good and fine but what's his attitude behind it there's plenty of listen balaam was gifted but he tried to destroy israel he tried to speak against it and god wouldn't even permit him and yet we think god's gonna let us speak against the bride even balaam knew better than that he says well i believe these things are gifts i believe what we see take place is gifts and they are god given gifts but we if we do not use them in the right way that god intended them to be used we can do more harm with the gifts than we could if we did not have the gifts so a gifted man with the wrong attitude is more dangerous than a man that has the wrong attitude and doesn't have a gift and we lift up the gift many times look he's and he's saying watch the spirit behind it because that'll do more damage the other night i made a statement the pope is saying this i would rather see brother brotherly love amen brotherly love existing among the church if we didn't have one case of healing or anything else now listen i believe in divine healing i preached about him i've seen it all the time but brother man is making the he's not he's not saying to throw out divine healing he said if i had to pick one if i had to only see one thing i'd rather see brotherly love among the churches if i didn't see one person healed we get worried when we pray for this person they don't get and you should be don't get me wrong we we should believe for healing we should see that but we'll get very concerned about that case and and we should but we'll neglect a lack of love among one another we're like ah that's just how it always is we've always been that way we just always fight that should concern us even more you know as a minister sometimes you run into the other ministers and stuff and you know they're both and i went over here and i preached i just raped these people over the coals and i just showed them this and i got on further this and then i'm like well i i don't enjoy doing that listen brother enjoy doing that listen brother brown you know if you want to hear a hard preacher brother brandon just turn on tape you know you're getting you hear somebody preach like man that preacher is just a hard preacher i'm thinking do they listen to the same tapes i listen to man that private he just he just tears them up but but he never enjoyed doing that he wasn't doing it because he disliked him see the difference he didn't get up there to vent on them his opinion because he was trying to stick it to him amen he got there because he loved them people didn't want to know what the scripture said so say it's the attitude behind it whatever kind of a gift or whatever we have in our life it's the attitude behind it that's important amen paul talks about this with the corinthian church i won't i won't read it all here for the sake of time but you know paul with the corinthian church he's dealing with this man that was caught in sin and he writes to him in second corinthians it says if i make you sorry he says who is it that makes me glad but the same that i made sorry in other words like if if you were all my joy why would i want to make you sorry that's what paul's saying why would you enjoy tormenting people that love you and that's his whole point i wouldn't i wouldn't want to do that and he said out of much affliction and anguish of heart i wrote on you with many tears not that you should be grieved but that you might know the love paul wasn't saying and doing these things because he he wanted to teach him a lesson and let him know that they were dumb and they weren't spiritual enough he said i didn't do it that you'd be greeted so you would know the love that i have more abundantly for you brother braham says now there's some members go to your church he says i know i'm talking to protestant and catholic i'm talking to calvius and armenia but that's neither pro nor khan you do this he says he says if you want to be a real outstanding person in your church how many wants to be an outstanding person in their church some of us are already outstanding hopefully you don't feel too anyway who wants to be an outstanding person i think we all want to amen if you want to be a outstanding person in your church whatever church you go he says he go you go to he says you just fall in love with god with all your heart and when you do that so i love god with all my heart when you do that you will fall in love with every member of your church and every member of everybody else's church with all your heart this is where we get spiritual say well i'll just convince everybody oh well he's got that covered next next sentence he says now you can't bluff that actually i found out you can to some yeah people i guess it's interesting i'm all i'm kind of all over the place here but it's interesting to me because you know people in the world if i could say it that way they seem to pick it they because they're a lot less willing to give you the benefit of the doubt they pick it up a lot faster if you're being insincere oh listen you know i love you and that's why i feel the need to make you be more like me people in the world don't buy that at all hey man they're just like you're just a pretentious religious person but they see someone that really loves them and they know it now a lot of times we just well you know that person i'm not saying we shouldn't give people the benefit of the doubt amen but the prophet's making the point you can't bluff that you might bluff it to some people people are going to find out what you're really about after a while you can't bluff that so don't try is this whole point you can't bluff that there's something about that people know he said if there's anything think about this is marvelous if you catch nothing else catch this today if there's anything i can contribute the success of my meetings to earthly speaking it is to know that people have a conscience to know that i truly love people now we talk about the spiritual element but he's talking about earthly speaking if i could contribute the success of my meetings anything people know that i really love people amen and they know that and you could he says you can't fool them on that if you're making your pretendings it's just like christianity if you're pertaining to being christian or just pretending rather to be a christian you will never make a go of it no sir it's absolutely got to be there that's all love will do it amen you know the bible is are you all are you all feeling good today well hopefully you love me at least maybe even love one another maybe even well praise the lord you know the bible says blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children not the war makers the peacemakers shall be called the children of god why because as it said a few moments ago making peace is hard amen listen it's very it's it's i you know i i really respect uh you know nurses and doctors and things it's very easy for us to die physically it's very easy to hurt somebody it's it's really not that hard to hurt somebody it's really something when you can bind up somebody or help somebody a great man can lift somebody else up that's that's real power amen listen everybody can make war that you know of course you all probably heard me talk about how you know i read the art of war i read sun since the art of war and all this that's but listen i'm so thankful for the art of peace i'm so thankful there's a peace that god can give to your heart i'm thankful that god can teach you to make peace god can make you to sit down with your enemies that's real power amen making peace is hard listen like i said if you've ever been married if you've ever gone to church once i don't think it's somebody's first is this anybody's first time have you ever gone to church at all if you've ever been married if you've ever been in any relationship at all in your life amen you know that it's it's work sometimes sometimes it's not even always possible romans 12 says this in verse 18 the bible says if it be possible as much as life within you live peaceably with all men so it's not always possible but to the extent that it is as much as lies in you not the other person well listen if they just be a little more accommodating well you could be a little more accommodating maybe what as much so obviously there's different degrees some of us are able to be more peaceful than others i guess at least that's been my my witness in life some people but whatever the extent of that is that lies in you as much as lies within you live peaceably with all men amen so we have to make like i said an effort paul says again in hebrews 13 9 he says be not carried about with divers in strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with grace not with meats which have not profited them that have been occupied therein so this ties into what peter talks about in acts chapter 15 verse 10 they're taught about the different doctrines because the church they had a dissension there again they were fighting over what do you need to be circumcised do we need to follow the law of moses and peter makes this point he says now therefore why tempt you god to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples which neither our fathers nor we are able to bear thank god for a man like peter could have an honest moment like that you know why are we going to make a bunch of rules divers and strange doctors why are we gonna make this so much harder when we can't even do what we're telling other people to do there's something about a legalist especially amen they've got every kind of rule for you well listen the church doors have to be this and the picture the prophet has to be hanging in your church at such such a high this has to be this way and you can't have this color carpet and you can't they've got all these rules for how you've got to come into the kingdom and peter's making the point listen we couldn't do it anyway why are we going to project onto others rules that we can't keep well maybe i can keep it well your fathers couldn't do it listen if they couldn't if they couldn't do it if we can't do it why would we expect somebody else to see a lot of our a lot of our our variances come from rules that we thought that god gave us but it was really our opinion and we try to impose on everybody else when they don't want it imposed upon them well this is the fourth of july praise the lord coming up listen to the british government they want to impose all kinds of things and it caused what it caused of war it caused animosity because what they were imposing was too great a burden on these colonists listen sometimes we're that one we put rules on everybody else we can talk about everybody else how they did this to me i want to talk about us for a moment sometimes we have expectations well listen my my pastor needs to pray eight hours a day do you prayed hours a day well listen so-and-so they never call me when's the last time you called them well listen i was sick and and and nobody ever come and talk to me did you let them know you were sick well no they had they need you know if they were inspired if god inspired them they'd had a vision oh is that how you do it we've got all these expectations well listen nobody listen the bible said if you're secure call for the elders at least let them know praise the lord well listen these people they they didn't talk this person talked to me at church i had a brother one time listen i i stood by this person they never once said anything to me did you say anything to them well no might have been a good place to start a conversation little hello there how you doing god bless your brother you don't know their name you know i love that when i first started coming to church i didn't know anybody praise god didn't matter god bless you sister how you doing brother man you don't have to know my names listen we got all the barriers out of the way you can love everybody you don't have to know him for 40 years we we are brothers and listen we come from the same daddy that makes us siblings you've got brothers and sisters you might never met him in this life you'll meet him one day because you got the same daddy your family are all the same we put rules on people put rules a lot of times in a marriage listen my spouse they need to do this and you do that well what are you doing well nothing maybe you make a better attempt to get along with me clearly i see where the contention's coming from amen we make up rules that we can't even keep many times and listen and that's what paul talks about even when paul preaches about marriage and divorce he says you know it's a good thing he says if you can be unmarried like me but not everybody can do that listen not everybody has to be like me he's saying listen why aren't more people like me probably because we like to get along with one another because we all acted the same we'd probably not get along even worse i thank god i don't know anybody that's like me praise god one was enough well you all laugh but i won't be laughing i go home tonight like why me hi me lord you've all been there too i guess amen paul's you know listen i think it's good if you can live my like this but i'm not going to make that a commandment i'm not going to impose that because not everybody is like me in other words this is a this is a situation where you don't have to be just like this person there are certain things in the bible that we are to conform to and then there's certain things in the bible it's up to you well listen listen we're all looking for this ah we need to all be in the same no there's things that you're allowed to do it maybe somebody else isn't oh man oh man people they get all cringe about that oh man wow you sure about listen paul talks about with your meat and your drink all these now i'm not saying for well i'm gonna go have three wives who don't condemn me that's not what i'm talking about it's not what i'm talking about but listen he makes the point listen if you're if your me defends your brother don't eat it in front of him you're not going away well listen i can do what i want i love bacon no no no no no by the way i do love bacon but if i knew it offended you i would he said i won't eat meat till the world ends well praise the lord i i got convicted because uh my wife's one sister she's she's a vegetarian she turned vegetarian or vegan she's one appraisal i better stop later in her life she decided to to do this so of course me being a red-blooded male american i i decided that i would make it a point to eat lots of meat in front of her but i but what i'm saying is it's actually the wrong attitude now and i understand that there's more of a spiritual thing behind it but the point is listen if it bothers him don't do it we're so busy trying to make sure we offend it listen i'm gonna let everybody know where i stand well you you confess christ before man that's true but you don't have to listen i i had a triple whopper today i'm more spiritual than you i'm the bible says i'm strong in faith because i eat all things well the bible says don't let your meat destroy your brother if he's waking faith that doesn't mean you go up to him and say well listen brother i understand you're weaker in faith than me so i'm not going to do this it's not that point the point is to not let him be condemned because of your attitude in the first place so you might try to find all these work-arounds see your attitudes are only looking for a workaround well how can i how can i condemn this person without condemning them why are you trying to condemn him at all that's peter's whole point listen why are we gonna put rules on to stop him from coming in when we want him to come in so sometimes we impose our own rules i'll give you an example let's pick on me hour praise the lord you're all safe today march safe from condemnation well listen when i was a young man i i got saved at 24 come the church i was married married at 24 as well i believe no i was 25 by then yes so i started preaching a couple years later and i'll just be real honest uh i've never i've never adamantly been against doctors i've had bad experiences in my life and things and so you know it's like anything else there's good doctors there's bad doctors they're good there's good lawyers there's bad lords it's all the same but as a young man i i maybe leaned a little bit against doctors i'm like listen if this person really had faith they wouldn't need to see a doctor they'd be healthy like me listen that's easy to say when you're a 20 some year old man well listen i've invented this rule because i'm able to live this way well i was till i got sick guess what happened you know you see people like well i'll never go to the doctor i've got faith they feel that way till they get sick and then guess what happens they get more spiritual all of a sudden oh god has led me to seek out a physician well praise god you're the first person in history that god's ever wanted to have somebody go see a doctor all these other people were just backsliding but you you've got faith it's true you begin to reevaluate after what well you know maybe maybe that was my idea no i praise god i i try never like lean that way preaching whatever but i yeah it's hard to say what comes out i mean there's so much this is god let's be honest sometimes the man comes out hopefully not too much the less the better but listen i i would never want to this is my point i would never want to take somebody that goes to the doctor and condemn him for that that's not how the prophet preached it that's not what the bible says but there's people that have done that and even in message churches well listen if they had faith they wouldn't have to go to the doctor maybe they have faith that's why they're going amen now doctor you know i do like i read this quote this this is kind of a segue here i'll read this brother man talks about this in 1953 elijah he says look at diseases breaking out when doctors don't even know what they are here we are my kids just my kids went in the the breakfast area the hotel this morning like oh there's something about monkey pox on there like a crate there's hippo pox and monkey pogs and lf i can't even keep track anymore this coven 19. we've never seen anything like it oh that's reassuring listen we've we just come to this new thing but we don't know you know it's gonna make you lose your smell you're gonna lose your memory yeah all these people have all these different reactions to it they don't know listen i believe they're trying i get that but they really don't know what they're dealing with if there's ever a time you want to be certain of god it's now amen he says we're developing drugs and i look i preach divine healing i'm not against drugs you realize that no sir they're god-given but today they've become he says i don't know what to call it he says well we're here not long ago i was saying tells you a story not long ago i was writing on the road i i picked up an agent we were talking together in a filling station he come talking about divine healing he said the medical racket has become the greatest in the nation they kill as many as they help they give a penicillin shot it'll help you get rid of a bad cold it'll set you up something else that might take your life now they've gotten this thing well you know you've got this slight chance of a heart condition you took this this vaccine but you know it your survival rate's really high i'm like oh you mean like it was with kovid so now i'm not against her for it but i'm just making the point he's he says this here he says i come back from overseas dr dare my friend in jeffersonville he said billy i don't want to give you penicillin i've got you some chloromycetin well i was up there praying for the sick and everything i was just sneezing around my wife said well you come in a hot climate take some medicine so his wife said get some medicine i took them things and didn't do me no good i went and got another bottle and took them i got so swimmy headed sometimes sometimes the remedy is worse than the cure or the the i'm sorry the remedy is worse than the the malady the situation my wife's just doing that so they're going with these allergy shots and she's worse than ever it's like well praise the lord i couldn't stand up i called the doctor said doc you know them things when you're swimming headed he said how many you took i said two bottles he said mercy goodness enough to kill you quit taking them now the doctor expected you to tell him before you took the second bottle what did the doctor tell me this had side effects because he expected you to call when he had side effects he didn't expect you to take another bottle almost kill yourself brother bam says there's only one thing about a bad cold if you take the medicine you have it seven days if you leave it alone you have it for one week now i read all this to make this point the very next sentence is so you can suit yourself now that's it so i use that example because of myself i've seen i've seen a lot of the racket you know when they're coming out and telling you where you need your fifth vaccine now the ceo of this mega corporation that sells pharmaceuticals saying well we need your fifth vaccine now i'm thinking to myself well he's not motivated at all he's not motivated by any sort of monetary incentive at all but at the same time i'm thankful that they are because of the people that need him now that's why i'm saying this you're looking even message churches i'm bringing this full circle now you know we look at this covert thing certain churches react one way and certain churches react another way people some people get a vaccine and some people don't and we're sitting here supposed to be the enlightened bride of jesus christ and we're such medical experts not only for our own condition but everybody else is to let them know listen brother if you're a christian you wouldn't take that or listen brother if you're a christian you would take that listen suit yourself because what works for you might not work for somebody else listen even biologically we're different listen i am not a medical doctor i thank god for him amen but listen i'm not one if you feel that you need to take a certain thing or do it if god let you do it why would i condemn you for that and if you don't feel that way listen our church we're gonna do listen you do what you need to do and don't condemn the other person for doing it it's become such a variance you've got message preachers and i'm not preaching against either one because this is my whole point you got one church they preach it one way and they tell this church over here they're carnal and the other one gets up well listen they're a bunch of backsliders i'm thinking let brotherly love continue where where's the brotherly love you know what if this church starts it amazes me well listen their church starts at 10 30 and we start at 10 i'm not saying this church because you start at 10 but they start at noon and listen they're right listen if i don't go to that church why do i care when they start we've got so spiritual now to where we know how to run everybody else's church and our own can't run our own house we can't run our own lives but we're on everybody else's business i just don't know why nobody agrees with me all the time they just want to fight with me i don't know it's astounding i just don't get it you know what now praise the lord now you may know somebody like this in your life it doesn't matter what you do you're wrong you'll pull you pull out of the driveway you turn one way well you should have went that way pull on the drive with the next one you turn this way you should have went that way i forgot it was a full moon on the third wednesday of the month so now we can condemn this person for being contentious or you could use a soft answer and turn away wrath you can turn the other cheek the whole point is not saying well look at this person see because you preach this and people say well i know somebody like that well the point is are you the somebody not the somebody this is not let's call out that guy i've been waiting for this day wow we're gonna drag him out in the parking lot brother he was talking about you pitchfork religion brother this is all for you sister sister you better straight up what are you doing to live peaceably david said the 131st psalm i love this david says lord my heart is not haughty nor mine eyes lofty neither do i exercise myself in great matters or in things too high for me he says surely i behaved and quieted myself as a child that is weaned of his mother my soul is even as a wayne mother i'm sorry weaned child let me read the first verse in psalm 131 verse 1 lord my heart is not haughty nor my eyes lofty neither do i exercise myself in great matters or things too high for me this is a king once you understand this is not a guy that's uh he's working at a restaurant he's a factory worker he's a he's a homemaker this is the king of an entire nation he's like lord my heart's not haughty i don't exercise that myself it matters too great for me what's too great for the king even a king you're saying lord if it's not my business if it's beyond my scope lord i'm not gonna mess with it i'm not gonna exercise myself in it if king david could have that kind of discretion why do we think we need to quarterback everybody's lives for them listen this is the play we're gonna run here i didn't know we were running a play okay well thanks i'm laughing because i know where i'm going with this i've got i've got some brothers that they've planned my ministry out for me you probably know some people that they know where your life is going for you and they let you know and he told me one time well listen i believe the lord called you to go to such place okay brother well i appreciate that lord talks to me too i'll i'll take it up with him he come back a couple months later brother i believe the lord wants you to be at this in such a place i'm thinking i have not yet mastered the ability to be in two places at once i i don't know how i'm going to fulfill your will in my life sir [Laughter] surely the lord would grant me the ability to do this if he wants me to do it you know he's got all these lofty plans for me but listen david the leader of a nation said list and there are some things it's just too great for me and i leave it alone just leave it alone so in other words it's not my job i found this out hopefully not the hard way i found that's not my job to call up every message church see what time their service is and how they operate church order and let them know it's none of my business that church is sovereign this church is sovereign it's not your business now listen to those necessarily you have to like it or agree with that many times you don't have to go along listen like i said a lot of times it's just it's something doesn't even concern us listen these people they they do this in their home what is that concerning well no then why do you care listen i i just be real honest the older i get because i'm so old i feel like it felt like it this morning listen the older you get for me at least you see stuff it's either going to bother you more or you're going to learn just to have to relax a little bit amen you know you see people and i maybe you've never dealt with this maybe this is just me but you see people sometimes and they're doing something wrong and you know it's wrong and maybe it's actually even wrong and you're like man they're doing that wrong but you know what sometimes it just doesn't concern you i'm not saying if it's something sinful or whatever you shouldn't i'm talking about you know maybe they make a bad purchase or something oh they bought this swamp land in this undeveloped area well listen they're they're not gonna go to hell over that they might they might put themselves through a personal one of that because they put all their money in crypto and then it crashed 300 percent you know but sometimes it doesn't concern you listen i this this is just me now you could take or leave this sometimes i see people doing something and i think well i'm right and they're wrong just let them go i just let them go because you know what then i then i'm right and i can be like shy yeah i showed them no i didn't show them but if if that person's wrong and you're right listen jesus said that wisdom's justified over children if you're doing what you're supposed to do and you're right god will bless it you don't have to go and announce it to everybody is my point god will allow it to pan out over the listen david when he was in the wilderness looked like he didn't know what he was talking about when saul died he become king wisdom was justified over children that was absolutely the plan of god where you're at now is not where you're going to be listen god he casts down the that which results itself but he lifts up that where you at today where somebody else is at today you might see the wicked prospering like david and you might wonder why did the wicked prosper you don't have to put your hand to saul let god take care of it god will put you where he wants you to be and god will put that person where he wants them out you don't have to sit there and try to tell them there are certain things this is what i was getting at earlier there are certain things that are they're not salvation issues we might try to make it into that but it's not always the case paul talks about this in first gear first corinthians 3. i won't read the whole thing but paul talks about laying a foundation you can lay a foundation of gold and silver and precious stones or you can use wood or hair stubble every man's work is going to be tried whether you preach the gospel you heal the sick whatever it is you did your work is going to be tried what was your motive behind it why did you do the things that you did your work can be tried and somebody else's work is going to be tried your work if it's tried and it's not found wanting if it's gold or silver or precious stones you'll receive a reward for it the bible says but i really want to kill this if if your work is wood and hate and stubble and it's burnt up you did everything for the wrong motive you saw this person did the wrong thing whatever it is their work is destroyed but they themselves will still be saved so some people might be losing their reward but they're not still losing their salvation many times that's the thing we fight with people over well listen i i believe that the church should be this way many times we rob not only others of peace but our own selves because we make things overly important we fuss and we debate about things that don't need fuss and debate about so that's why i if you're around me for like the time i'm sitting with people and they'll they start bickering about something i'll just be like well let bro they love continue so you remind yourself of this verse you're in that situation you know what they're just brothers they're just carrying on like brothers that's fine just remind yourself you know what we're still brothers we're still sisters just let brotherly love continue that's just how they're just family it's okay as long as they can still love one another at the end of the day if they can bitterly disagree not just if they can bitterly disagree and still put their arm around one another if you can still do that at the end of the discussion that's all that god requires he's not asking you to convince everybody he don't ask you to always be right and convince everybody you're right listen if you disagree and you can still love them that's what god's concerned about that's what we ought to be concerned about as i often say we're more concerned in our lives about being right than we are about being righteous well we want to be right we want everybody know that we're right just love them anyhow maybe you are right maybe they are wrong but can you love them anyhow because you can be right about something and have the wrong attitude and that's worse it's worse amen you know i think uh i think that's one of the big things that's been a reproach around the message even you know we claim to be non-denominational and the message is non-denominational but the whole issue that paul deals with in first corinthians 3 was their divisions or their variances it wasn't about caiphus or paul or whatever it was about the fact that they were divided about it amen and message churches you know you look at brother brahm's own church when uh junior jackson leaves the church and he goes down the church he's got people in his church criticizing the people and he said don't you do that they believed this message just the same as me even though their order was different but the brand didn't model it that way well listen i'm the prophet of god they shouldn't listen to me that's not how he dealt with it in the church he said listen they're just as much my brothers they believe this message just as much as me they just differ on church order with gifts on the floor that's their troubles he said that's their troubles let them have their own troubles don't make it your trouble but it's not your trouble see we've got so much we lose so much peace worried about things it's not yours to worry about if it bothers you so much pray for that person can we pray for that person as much as we complain about him can we pray for that person as much as we rebuke him can we love him as much as we chide them amen but what i love about this paul he's he's he's blasting so to speak these corinthians for their divisions they're being carnal this is but you know what you're still god's children you're fighting and you're carnal and you're letting all this stuff go on but you know what you were all baptized into one spirit by one body we're all one body we're still christians god even a colonel you say that that christian they're the most carnal christian i know well as long as they're a christian that's fine amen because they can grow up too listen baby christians grow up you say well they just act like such a colonel person well praise god they've got room to grow let them go let god do something in their life if you want to be there and say something do it to be a help to them not to put them down and pull them up amen brother brahm says this probably uh it's 1958 the great commission he says if i have found grace in your sight through god you take my word for this brother if you want to be a blessing and get a blessing when a man has done you wrong i'm talking about your attitude now now talk about the other person when a man has done you wrong and he absolutely just i mean he's done you wrong and you know that he's done you wrong there's no question about it this is the bible it's in black and white he is this guy is absolutely wrong towards me okay what's the prophet say i mean he has done you wrong and you know he has done you wrong he's done you evil don't mention that you take him to prayer before god amen before you think well the preacher said i have to take to prayer before god well he covers that he says and don't take it away just self and say well i'm supposed to do this that's what we do well i guess i'll love you because i'm supposed to but stand with your shoulder to his shoulder and stand in the presence of god our father pray he says the way a prayer should be made in the presence of god say father here's my brother and he justly he deserves punishment he's dummy evil i don't see why he did it that's the problem we don't see the we don't see the other side of it well i don't know why this person acts this way well you don't know where they've been maybe they asked that way for a reason not justif listen i'm not justifying when people do the wrong thing but i'm saying maybe sometimes they do the wrong thing because something in their life made them feel that way this person's insecure or whatever maybe they come out of an abusive home and then they act a certain way well listen it's because they have a problem you want to make that worse or you want to help them brother braham says this continuing on here i don't see why he did it then let god go to talking to you and maybe you'll see maybe where that man's been through the devil has twisted him up somewhere and caused him to do that though he's absolutely wrong before you leave the throne of god you'll be feeling sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing with that brother when you get back down here to earth again you'll go to that brother and shake his hand because you know what he's been through see a lot of times you know what somebody's been through well this this brother well praise the lord this is another i guess maybe this is why i'm going this way but i was talking to i'll mention who i was talking brother henry van wyk here at the kids days last week we were talking about you know the situation you ever meet somebody and like the first time you mean they just can't stand you you're the devil and shoe leather and they just hate your guts you're thinking what did i do a lot of times when you look like somebody you remind them of something you're not that person but you remind them of somebody and because it's so bad that's why they treat you that way now if you knew that was why you'd feel sorry for them but when you don't know you said they're going well i didn't do anything to them they were just absolutely wrong there's no i'm a christian there's no reason for them to treat me that way and i didn't do it but when you realize what they've been through you say you know what i get it i get it nobody likes being reminded of those things i i didn't mean to do that sometimes you can't help it that's why as much as lies with sometimes it can't be helped but my goal is never to run them further away you'll go to feeling sorry he said sorry for that man you'll be sympathizing that brother when you get back down to here you go to that brother shake his hand because you know what he's been through you can't stand with a mortal in the presence of god and condemn anybody i don't believe no sir even if he's a rank sinner and what about a brother see brotherly kindness what about a brother that's made a mistake though i say he's wrong sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong ever been there listen have you ever been accused or had a rumor told about you didn't like it well if you don't like it don't do it about somebody else sometimes he's accused wrong when he's not wrong but if he is wrong well we'll just take the throne of god stand there shoulder shoulder with our brother not think about the sound nor he's immortal and maybe his destination rests upon our attitude toward him when we come back from the throne of god we realize we're everyone guilty where everyone need help from one another this is what i was dealing with this this woman she must i don't know she was hurt somewhere in life by by a preacher or something she just had this you know i i said one thing to a guy and she took it i was attacking this guy and this that and the guy and i were totally on the same page we were just we're just kind of joking a little bit about something she totally took it the wrong way and like you know a pastor shouldn't be trying to preach or shouldn't i'm like i i don't know what i did to you but this brother he was so intent that she needed to apologize and make this right said don't do that that's just going to drive her further away because she feels justified i said brother i don't need her apology i forgive her it's fine see we're i need them to be sorry about i need them to tell me i was right you you put in that position all that if they're already defensive they're just going to build up a wall my my goal not to run her further off and say well i was right she's wrong my goal is you know what if there's any way that she would ever feel to come to somebody and ask about christ again i i would wonder i would never want to stand in the way of that i'm willing as paul said i'm willing to suffer suffer being wrong suffer the loss of all things what is your pride what is your reputation compared to the value of a soul is it not worth laying down oh i gotta be right i don't care if she thinks i'm the worst person in the world as long as she finds jesus she'll find out in the end who's who anyway i i don't care if that person thinks you're whatever just let them find jesus let them get the answer they need she doesn't mean me as a man amen maybe you might and that's why i said listen it's the wrong attitude i do i don't need i don't need validation i want to see somebody saved your attitude can affect their destination amen for the sake of time i'm going to move on here real quick but paul says in colossians chapter 2 he says walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time let your speech always be with grace seasoned with salt that you may know how you ought to answer every man so you don't want to just say things you want to have the right kind of a seasoning you want to have the right kind of a savory wants to be salty now it's funny because salty today has a different connotation than salt he does in the bible now when somebody's salted it means they're upset they're crying they're tea you know they're salty we don't want to be that kind of salty christian we want to be the bible kind of salty we want the things that we say we don't just tell the truth we want to speak the truth in love amen i got a whole nother thing here and i i don't i don't really have time for it but you know i'll say this i'm a preacher that i don't believe in secret sensitive churches we're trying to make everybody happy and i've preached against it many times you know we're not to be men pleasers because that's what paul said in in galatians chapter 1 uh verse 10 we're not to seek to please men but you know the boss paul does also talk about trying to please your brother or whatever for for edification it's a greek word it's a rescue and it means to be agreeable or by implication to strive to be agreeable in other words as a christian you're actually trying to get along with people your goal is not to say well i was persecuted because i badmouthed everybody at church it's not persecution you're just unlikable [Laughter] your goal is not to run them off paul says in romans 15 we then who are strong oh i'm strong well okay this is what strong people do we them that are strong ought to bear the infirmities of the weak and not to please ourselves that everyone must please his neighbor for his good to edification not pleasing for political reasons not pleasing for your own gain please them for edification even christ please not himself but that is written the reproaches of them that approach thee fell on me you've got a better reproach to help somebody than do it that's what christ did for you first corinthians 10 whether therefore you eat or drink or whatever you do all to the glory of god giving none offense neither the jews nor the greeks or the church of god he was like please a rescue i please all men in all things now he's not a people pleaser but he's trying to help somebody if he has to accommodate them in a not sinful way to accommodate them to get them to the gospel he's going to do it he's going to do all things for all men that by all means he might save some amen i please almond all things not seeking my own prophet but the prophet of many that they may be saved listen i use the example earlier paul talks about marriage he said if you are a married man uh you know the unmarried man he minds the things of god mary baby has to mind the things of the world how to please his wife now paul's not saying that's a bad thing listen if you make your wife happy that's a good thing and when it's married if you're white you know happy wife happy life it's not a bad thing hey man it's okay to get along with people oh brother loves corrective well it's not nitpicking you to death that's not what it is it's not only corrective amen it's also patient it's kind it envy it's not seeketh not her own love has a lot more to it than just wow you know we got to correct people all the time amen i use this example all the time you know we talk about listen jesus was a likable person the only people that didn't like jesus was other religious people amen listen common people heard him gladly he went well he's one of them fussy dog no the common people liked him they just got who incited them to kill jesus the religious people because they don't know what they're doing he said that they don't know what they're doing the leaders know what they're doing but these common people he actually died for them he loved him even under death and they loved him sort of they liked him amen praise the lord i'll read this quote here i i i want to tie this up this is a familiar quote if you've ever studied the message standing in the gap 63 brother talking about the complex he developed where he lost his feeling for the people because they rejected his message he says you see even the great saint paul got between straights one times and many times god has did things watch this or let his servants do things that was mistakes in order to prove these things now we know that human beings can make mistakes but god can make no mistake so sometimes god allow mistakes in people's life that we're sitting and we're just fussing and fighting why would god let him do that sometimes god allows it for his purpose he said now i get in the field of preaching i go the way i do i have to set up meetings ahead and things get lined up and perhaps this is that great time coming that we've been looking for and surely if this is itself is a tremendous thing it will bring to pass it may come to pass the tremendous victory in the love divine that's the verb before the adverb it's divine love which is god it takes the love of god to dash out there on the front line and stand in the gap for the people brother man says and these ricky's or a cat is that have so sassed the words i've called them no he's the one being sassy i've called them that ricky and raquetta god give me to understand i shouldn't do that because it's many of them that are still his children well listen this person is the worst sinner i know yeah but you don't know where they'll be in five years if the lord tarries you don't know where to be next week how many times and i don't want your mind to water too much but how many times do you see someone at church here's a here's a great so-and-so this is a great person oh here's and where are they at five years later we're not careful we're sitting here bad-mouthing this person oh they're just the lowest worst most carnal person in the church well if they belong to god that's what matters i wouldn't want to go badmouth one of god's children just because they're in disobedience still god's children god gave me an understanding i shouldn't do that there's many that steal his children they can't help because they act so much different sometimes they can't help it some of these old cold formal churches have gotten that spirit upon them and there is much in prison as israel was in prison just as much as moses went down there to deliver them from slavery human beings that loved jesus would serve him if they only knew what to serve him by now remember that they can't help it that's why he was asked him he lost his feeling his brotherly kindness you say well that's just a bunch of sinners he's saying it's church people people in churches if they're in the wrong kind of church listen why did he lose his feelings because churches rejected as religious people they're the hardest ones to deal with that's why i said earlier many times the sinner's easier in a natural sense to get along with because they just don't care about anything most of the time amen but you have to make it ever because listen we are the children of god that person next to you they're just as much a child of god as you are sometimes you have to make an extra effort to love them and don't lose your feeling form because like i said this is the day where the love of many is wax cold brother graham says don't lose the feeling of the people you must remember they're not made out of sawdust they are flesh and blood human beings and assault i think we forget many times the value of that person that person that i could i could tell testimony here there's a certain brother i don't think he might be telling me the story so i'm going to tell because i've told before but there's a certain brother and i've known him for years and he's he's kind of rough around the edges but i love him you know uh if i could just say this he uh he was in an accident one time and i won't go over all the details for the sake of time here but he was in an accident and uh he was sitting still and a vehicle rear-ended him at 55 over 55 miles an hour he was in his pickup truck it slammed into him they life-flighted him he was fixing to die and my wife actually sent me a text about it i didn't know what was all about but i was at work and the lord showed me in the vision i saw the accident taking place and the lord told me that he's not going to die he'll live and he'll walk out of that hospital and the doctors are saying they don't expect him to make it through the day if he does survive he'll never walk again and i texted the one brother at the hospital said you begin to pray it said the lord show me he'll live and he'll walk out there two days later that man walked out of the hospital he said brother why are you saying all this that's not the end of the story there's more to that but i tell this for a reason this same guy he ended up his his marriage went bad he left his wife he got a bunch of money made a mess out of his life by his own confession like i said i'm not i'm not saying this to embarrass him but he made a mess out of his life and i'll be honest i had a bad attitude about it i prayed for this man i spoke on this man's behalf i went before the lord you heard this testimony and i said lord i looked at the man one day and i said you know i i almost feel bad i wish you'd have died you'd have been better off in that condition than what you've done with your life but you know what the lord's done things in his life and he's back in church and he's still kind of a rough kind of a guy but you know what like i said god can love a carnal christian as much as a spiritual christian but my attitude has changed about him i love that guy so much you know why god loved that guy every time i look at his life i said that guy has made all kinds of mistakes and god loved him enough to give him a save his life i always look and say god sure loves that man i don't know why but i don't this is my part i don't know why he loves me either i used to look at that man and get frustrated why would god be so gracious to this guy and do all this and look what he's done with his life and then i begin to look at my own life more over the course of time i see where i'm at so you know what every time i look at that guy and say god loves that man so much if god can love him that much maybe god can love me that much too i believe he does we're looking at it the wrong way now why can't they be more like me thank god he has so much love for that man that supernaturally raised them up if god has that kind of love for him what about you and i today what about that person that maybe you don't get along with at church or maybe at home or work if you they're not sawed us we forget we get in the heat of an argument with a spouse or a brother or a sister and we say something we forget listen they're not just six foot of dirt they are but there's more to it they've got a soul they've got a life they've got a history they've got family and we forget about it and we say things that are hurtful to try to validate ourselves why are you trying to hurt him in the first place see the whole premise is wrong that's not your enemy that purse that person is not your enemy amen oh but brother you don't understand they're wrong that's got nothing to do with it well they deserve punishment deserves got nothing to do with it some of them are still god's children that doesn't mean god's just gonna let them do whatever they want all the time they get off they get let off the hook but it does mean they're still children he's the father not you brother rem says and he says the world is dying for love the church is dying for love jesus said you are the salt of the earth but if the salt has lost it savor it is henceforth good for nothing but to be trod under the feet of men and if the church has lost its divine revelation of the love of god it becomes a mock and a stalk and a stumbling block to the world now there's only one thing the church has to do if you want somebody to come to christ you be salty salt makes a thirst you be salty and the world will get thirsty that's right it's very important how we present the gospel in our lives it's very important that we take great care with one another like i said you have to make an effort to do that sometimes but god will honor that effort god wants to see as much as lives within you are you doing your part to strive together to endeavor to keep the bond of unity and peace it's funny i uh i didn't know which direction i was going this but i was thinking about last year i i preached uh i was preaching about the zeal of the lord's time about being angry and stuff there was a brother brother david was here he's like ah we're going to start start another revolution in this country i'm like well brother that wasn't quite what i was going for it was very like ah it's all about you know spiritual warfare or whatever but i think it's ironic today here we are striving to keep the bond of peace amen as you stand to your feet today let us endeavor to continue in that that bond now like i said at the beginning that that doesn't mean that you don't ever disagree that certainly doesn't mean you're not allowed to voice your disagreement but it does mean that you do it with the right motive and the right attitude and if somebody does that with you hopefully you can receive it not everything is a personal we we do that we view everything as a personal attack that's the world politics today well you you know you're you must be against me because you don't feel the same well that doesn't mean that at all i'm actually for you i just don't agree with you right you know how it is if somebody disagrees with you about something view it for what it is they just see it a different way and maybe they're right or maybe you're both kind of right be willing to listen to that person not just give them the brush off well they they never know what they're talking about well maybe they do this time even a broken clock right twice a day amen be long-suffering gentle patient with one another let's bow our heads once more heavenly father i thank you today for this time and this lovely group of people lord i don't i don't know all their situations well i know they've never had a disagreement among them lord i i do doubt that we're all human beings even even your early church those men that walked with you that handled you and your flesh they they disagreed with you they disagreed with one another but they were still brothers at the end of the day lord we're in a country in a time where people are more polarized all the time by their personal differences by politics lord it seems like nobody's willing to to mend the fence or reach across the table anymore lord it's the spirit of this age it's the spirit of the time that we're living in but father i pray that you'd help each of us not to be partakers of that same spirit lord we don't want to be united with a church conformity the world does that denominations do that or we don't want to be a bunch of cookie cutters trying to conform to a man's ideas but we're individuals you made us each different lord but i pray you'd help us as individuals with our own ideas our own directions having different goals in life many times ones called to one place one to another that we could continue and we would strengthen ourselves and working together lord if if there be any here today with a variance i pray that they'd take this time and reach across the table may they not wait for somebody else to make it right but may they do their part may they strive earnestly in their homes and in this church in their lives to be peaceable with all men as much as lies within them lord help us to be salt and light to this world and to one another lord i never want to be the reason i never want to be the reason my temperament my personality my own opinion i never want to be the reason that somebody walks away from the truth lord help us never never to be in a fence like that lord if the truth offends him it's one thing but lord may our personalities may we be so yielded to you may we be so sweet and humble lord that we're willing to turn the other cheek knowing it might affect somebody's eternal destination lord i've seen it so many times it breaks my heart lord i never i never want to be that one lord i never want to i never want to do that to somebody i believe that's each of us if we're if we're sincere today if we're earnest none of us want to do that lord it's so easy the bible says in many things we offend our tongue such an unruly member lord it's so easy it's so easy for us to say hurtful things it's so easy for us to say heated things may we be so quick to say i'm sorry maybe we'd be so quick to say i forgive you maybe we'll be so swift in our speaking they say i love you too may we not hide our light under the bushel today may we present it may you send the light i pray and each of our lives one towards another lord sometimes in this great chaos and sea of life we find ourselves in great darkness may we be lights one to another lord be gentle and patient and apt not striving with other men but seeking to persuade them to draw closer to you bless this church this pastor all the different ones assembled lord i thank you for each one i thank you for their great love and their care lord may thee let brotherly love continue lord we must allow it we must let it continue i pray may that be the very sincere desire of each heart i ask and we thank you father in jesus name amen amen oh my let's let's just sing a song here we'll have a
