It's really good to see Johnson and our brother Orlando on a Wednesday. What a great blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. May the Lord bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you would turn in your Bibles to the book of Exodus, chapter 12. Some of you already know what we're going to be speaking on. Soon as we say Exodus chapter 12, we're going to begin reading here at verse number five. Everybody there say, "Amen." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And we'll have a a word of prayer. This is during the the plagues that were in Egypt upon Pharaoh and all of Egypt. And the children of Israel were instructed. God told Moses to speak all the all these things that we're going to read to the congregation of Israel while they were yet in Egypt. And he said in verse 5, "Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year. You shall take it out of the sheep or from the goats, and you shall keep it up to the 14th day of the same month, and the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening. They shall take of the blood and strike it on the two side posts, and on the upper doorpost of the h of the houses, wherein they shall eat it. They shall eat the flesh in the night, roast it with fire on leaven bread, and with bitter herbs they shall eat it. Eat not of it raw, nor soden at all with water, but roast it with fire, his head, and his legs, and with the prudinence thereof. And ye shall let nothing of it remain until the morning. That which remainth of it until the morning shall be burned with fire. And thus shall you eat it with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, your staff in your hand. You shall eat it in haste. It is the Lord's Passover. &gt;&gt; For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night, and will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, against all the gods of Egypt. I will execute judgment. I am the Lord. The blood shall be to you for a toolken upon the houses wherein you are. And when I see the blood, I will pass over you. And the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt. Amen. Let's just bow a word of prayer. Our heavenly father, Lord, we thank you that we could come to your house tonight to worship you, to praise you, to be with brothers and sisters of late precious faith. &gt;&gt; Have our hearts prepared that we might receive from you just a word, Lord, that would help us in our walk with you. And I say tonight, Lord, an important word, Lord, an important message. Father, may it resonate in every one of our hearts. May we go home with a renewed purpose, Lord, that we didn't have when we came. &gt;&gt; I pray that the the Holy Spirit now would move upon our hearts. Only you can do that, Lord. Only you can cause us to hear your word. Lord, give us a hearing ear, receiving heart. Pray, Lord, that you'd help me to get out of the way that your word could be ministered just as you would have it to be to the hearts of your people. feed your bride. Lord, we commit the service remainder of this message into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. We're just going to continue reading here. I want to drop down to verse 21. Moses is that was the instructions that God gave Moses. God said, "I am going to pass through Egypt and I am going to kill the firstborn." God was taking uh charge or sending the message of of this that he's going to do. He's bringing judgment upon Egypt. The thing is he made a statement. I'm going to kill all the firstborn where the blood of the innocent lamb is not applied. &gt;&gt; And even uh that doesn't matter if it was a beast or a human being. It doesn't matter if it was Egypt or if it was the uh the Hittites that were visiting or uh neighboring nations or if it was Israel. If there was a firstborn that didn't have the blood applied, death was setting in. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Drop down to verse 21. Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said unto them, "Draw out and take your lamb according to your families and kill the Passover. And you shall take a bunch of hissup," which we know the prophet taught us. That was just common faith. &gt;&gt; Didn't need anything supernatural. Just believing the word that was preached. You shall take a bunch of hissup and dip it in the blood that's in the in the basin and strike the lentil which is the top post and the two side post which uh with the blood that is in the basin and none of you shall go out of the door of his house until the morning. For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians. And when he seeth the blood upon the lentil on the two sidepost, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your house to smite you. And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons forever. And it shall come to pass, that means today. And it shall come to pass when ye come to the land which the Lord will give you according to he have promised that he shall keep this service that ye shall keep this service. And it and it shall come to pass when your children shall say unto you, what does this mean? Why do you pray in our home? Why do you read the Bible in our home? Why do we reverence the Lord in our home? &gt;&gt; Amen. that ye shall say, it is the sacrifice of the Lord's Passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smoked the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshiped. And the children of Israel went away and did as the Lord uh had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they. Well, this is really a sobering message because the destroyer was not the destroyer was not meant to hurt anybody in Egypt. But there was something that the um I'm sorry, there was the the the destroyer was not meant to destroy anyone that was in Israel. None of the people of God. It wasn't sent for. But something had to transpire in order for Israel not to be destroyed because it was a law that he's just going to destroy all the firstborn in the land. &gt;&gt; So he there was a time where the the the the um there was darkness in the land and then uh there was a a time where the Israel had light and um um and the darkness didn't affect them. But when it came to this plague right here, this was it was affecting everyone and the only way it could be escaped was the blood had to be applied. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon preached the message the token. How many has heard the message the token? &gt;&gt; Okay, now I recommend hearing this message again. He preached September 1st, 1963. In one way, brother Brandham esteemed this message, the toolken, higher than any other message that he had previously preached. And he took his message from Exodus 12, which we read. Now, he had preached great messages like I'm sure you know some of these. Christ is a mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he esteemed it higher than that. Is your life worthy of the gospel? The flashing red lights of his coming. Standing in the gap. The absolute letting off the pressure. The countdown. Convinced then concerned. Now these are great messages. Why I'm against organized religion. The statue of a perfect man. Jehovah Gyra series. The spoken word is the original seed. That is a magnificent message. The greatest battle ever fought. &gt;&gt; Daniel's 70 weeks. Perfect strength by perfect weakness that God had explained. The mark of the beast possessing the gate of the enemy as the eagle stirth up her nest that day on Calvary. The seal of God, the rejected king, the adoption series. What is the Holy Ghost and what is the Holy Ghost given for? How many know these messages? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Be certain of God. Thirsting for life. Why we are not a denomination? The mighty conqueror, the Hebrew series, the teachings in Revelations, even the church ages. He esteemed the token higher. If I could say this, even the seven seals which brother Brandon preached five months earlier in March and they were sandwiched together between two great messages called God hidden simplicity and revealed the same in the beginning and at the end showing how important it is to to catch this message. He did not want the people to miss the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And people came from all over the globe led by God to come and hear the seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And yet it was hid in simplicity. And brother Brandham esteemed this message the token higher than any other message that he had preached. &gt;&gt; And we've listened to it. But have we got the importance of this message? Right before he preached the token, he preached the message perfect faith because I believe we need perfect faith &gt;&gt; to really receive the token. &gt;&gt; And after he preached the token, he preached it is so important. He preached desperation &gt;&gt; that we've got to get desperate for the token. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want to read a a quote here that he said in the desperation message. He said, "This morning, the message this morning was to me," which that's when he spoke the token to me was the highlight message of my entire ministry. This morning, see, the highlight message of my entire ministry. He says it two times. Someday I'll tell you how it came about. And I know that everything has worked for months and months and months up to that one message moving up to come to a place that was the capping off time of it. You see, so brother Brandham's now sitting back after preaching all these these messages and he says, "I can see how the Lord has been preparing all these messages that I've been preaching for this message." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's getting the attention of the people. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now, I I I hope that you got what the token meant." See the token is the sign that the blood has been applied that the price that's been asked or required of God. See Jesus paid the price by shedding his own blood. He did that and then from there his life came the Holy Spirit. And when the blood is applied to you, &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit is a token that your price is paid. &gt;&gt; God has received you. And that's the token. &gt;&gt; Remember that is the token. &gt;&gt; Now there is many people who don't know what the token is. See, &gt;&gt; and you have to make it that nobody knows so that all have a chance to get it. The highlight of his ministry. The highlight of his ministry. He's the seventh age messenger. He's the angel to the Leodysian message. The one whose message is to get the bride ready for the groom. The one who went around seven times proclaiming the message of the hour. And it was the highlight of his entire ministry. &gt;&gt; The one who saw cancer fall off people's body where the blind eyes were open and crosseyes became straightened. He saw new limbs come forth. He saw the dead raised. And yet he said, "This is the highlight of my entire ministry." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One who God used to discern the thoughts and intents of men's hearts and their minds. The one who could tell you if you were lying to him &gt;&gt; or withholding something from him. &gt;&gt; This man, this man, the one who lived in the supernatural realm more than he lived in the natural realm. Amen. &gt;&gt; The one who had that plane, God had that plane stopped just to go help answer Aunt Jamaima's prayers. &gt;&gt; The one where the sword came down in Sabina Canyon and said, "This is the sword of the Lord." the one where that voice came down in 1933 and brother Brandham is uh baptizing the 17th person in the Ohio River and said as you and your me or as John Baptist forerrun my first coming so shall you and and your message forun my second coming. This man he said this message is the highlight of my entire ministry. the toolken, the man that went beyond the curtain of time. &gt;&gt; This man who God used to send a message to get his bride out. &gt;&gt; The one we will stand before &gt;&gt; on the day of judgment. Amen. &gt;&gt; This man said, "This message, the token, is the highlight of my ministry." The capping off &gt;&gt; like, "If we don't get this, we're going to miss it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God heard the cry of his people and he sent his servant Moses to deliver them. And it the now God could have handled it any way, but he decided to handle it with punishing the Egyptians with 10 plagues. And the first one was the blood, the Nile River, and all the water sources of Egypt turned to blood. The next was a massive infestation of frogs and then gnats or lice and and then there was flies and and pestilence and and then boils, hail, locust, and then darkness. And the last plague was the death of the firstborn. &gt;&gt; Amen. And God's people were instructed to take the blood of an innocent lamb and strike it on the two side posts in the upper doorpost of of their house wherein they lived. And they were to take the actual uh meat of that lamb and eat it physically. &gt;&gt; And if the blood wasn't applied, there was death to all the firstborn. Now today, if the blood isn't applied to our house, &gt;&gt; then we will die &gt;&gt; because without the Holy Ghost, we're only first born. &gt;&gt; We've got to become born again. And when you apply the blood of Christ to your house, you are born the second time and death will pass you. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know what it is? The devil, he preaches. How many times have you heard in the world that somebody's born again and you knew they weren't? It's a pretty common thing. &gt;&gt; Now, that's the devil's job is to get us get as many people as he can feeling as comfortable as he can that you've got the Holy Ghost. In fact, many will come to me in that day and say, "Well, wait a minute, Lord. I I cast out devils. I I I did many wonderful works. I I I prophesied in your name." And and and Jesus is going to say, "I never knew you." &gt;&gt; So, you weren't born again. You weren't born again. So, you can have those experiences, not have the first birth, and miss it. It's a it's a very it's a sobering thought to think that the devil is ministering to as many people as will give him an ear. Oh, you got the Holy Ghost. You got the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, you got it. Why did Brother Brandham said this was the highlight message of my entire ministry? If you listen to this message, I am telling you will have if you don't have the fear of God before you listen to it, you will have it after you listen to the message &gt;&gt; because brother Brandon made it real clear. It don't matter how many demons you've ever cast out by your faith. &gt;&gt; It don't matter how many good deeds you've done. It don't matter how many healings took place. It just doesn't matter. If the blood isn't applied, if the life of Christ is not beaming outside of you, you're going to have a spiritual death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, um I would ask Ree how old he is, but he's sleeping. &gt;&gt; How old are you, Ree? 10. All right. And uh Jonathan, you're you 14 or 15 sorry on me. Now I am pretty sure that there is more required of John John than there is of Ree. Is that a true statement? Because there's an age difference. Well, in this age, this is the seventh church age. We have all the truth that's been given. There is no more truth. &gt;&gt; There's nothing more we're looking for. &gt;&gt; The mystery of God is finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So more is required. Jesus said, "To whom much is given, much is required." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And the life of Christ must be manifested. We can't just have justification &gt;&gt; that it's not going to make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. sanctification ain't going to make it. &gt;&gt; Or me comparing myself with somebody who's a little bit less than me. &gt;&gt; That ain't going to make it. &gt;&gt; The token must be applied. The blood must be applied. &gt;&gt; Now, it's not the literal blood, &gt;&gt; right? It's the life that was in the blood. No, man had sin and it caused God's word to bring death. And yeah, man died physically, but God was concerned spiritually, right? And so, as you know the story, they offered up animals, they killed animals, and they hh made atonement, but it only worked for a year. And then they had to do it again. And brother Brandon taught us the reason why that is is that the spirit that's in an animal cannot come upon a human. &gt;&gt; So it took a human to redeem the human because a human was required because he said the day you eat thereof the day you'll die. That word had to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And so what did God do? He came himself. &gt;&gt; He came He he birthed himself through a virgin. &gt;&gt; Without man being evolved, a virgin shall conceive and God was manifested in the flesh, seen of angels, justified. God came and paid the price for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; At Calvary so we didn't have to die. Amen. &gt;&gt; But that does not mean we're all saved. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus went to Calvary. &gt;&gt; There's many people that that can say, "Yes, I believe that Jesus died on the cross for my sins, but that doesn't make them saved." &gt;&gt; I know this is this is hard, but the blood has to be applied. that life has to come back upon the human being and change his nature into the nature of God of what it was back in the garden. &gt;&gt; And we've got a a a a message that's being preached by the devil that that really isn't necessary. that all you have to do is just accept the message of the hour. Just repent, get baptized, just try to do your best because really nobody is perfect. You know, &gt;&gt; and you know, as long as you're going to church, you're actually pressing in like, you know, you you just do a good deed once a month for the church and you'll be accepted by God. I mean, there's some that don't even do things for the church. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; You know, oh, they got that handled. I'm not called to do that. What are you called to do? What is God calling you to do? Because if you're doing something, praise God. &gt;&gt; We have to receive the life inside. Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ died so the life could come back inside of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the life comes inside of us, we literally live the life of Christ. &gt;&gt; It is so simple. &gt;&gt; Well, I believe I've got the Holy Spirit, you know, but I just can't kick this lion. All I want to tell you is you need to make sure you get enough Holy Ghost that you kick the lion. And you could just take that with whatever it is that's hanging on you. &gt;&gt; Don't just be satisfied with how much Holy Ghost you got because there's a death angel set to come. &gt;&gt; Do you know everybody if you don't make the rapture? Did you know if you belong to him, you're going to have to give your life's blood? Think about this. You're going to taste death in the flesh anyways. But that still don't put you with the bride, &gt;&gt; you got to sleep a thousand years. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's right. &gt;&gt; It's a serious thing. This message I I say to you, if I say nothing today, go and listen to that message and get serious between you and God because it doesn't matter who else you live with. To me, the those 10 natural plagues were just a type of the spiritual plagues. I believe that. I believe that we're dealing with spiritual plagues. And you can read more about it in Revelation 16 and 2 Timothy chapter 3. What's happening in the church, but I just want to read this in Luke chapter 21:34. Luke 21:34. Jesus speaking here says, "Take heed to yourselves." Speaking of the last day, lest at any time your hearts be overcharged. You ever been overcharged? You got too much going. Can't handle it. &gt;&gt; Overcharged with surfing, with drunkenness, and with the cares of this life. I just can't keep up, brother John. So that that day come upon you unawares. Unawares. I mean, I'm telling you, what came upon Egypt was unaware. They didn't know what was coming. When Moses stepped down there, that was it. For as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell on the face of the whole earth. Watch ye therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all the things that are coming to pass and stand before the Son of Man. I'm telling you, the only way that you're going to make that is have the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Get serious about getting the Holy Ghost. Don't be a gambler. That's assuming, right? Uh, brother Brandon said assuming is a venturing without authority. We need the Holy Ghost to escape. The 10th plague is not just natural death, but it's a spiritual death. Brother Brandham taught us those that were in the age of justification with Luther, all they had to do was believe. The just shall live by faith. If they did, they were part of the bride, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; They were there are brothers. &gt;&gt; And in in in Wesley's age, they had to get sanctified. Each age more light was given, more was required. &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, in this age for us there, we we got to have it all. &gt;&gt; We can't have Luther's message. We We don't live off of Luther's message. &gt;&gt; Add to your faith, virtue, virtue, knowledge. You add you're you're you're you're walking up seven steps to perfection. Now, how many here owns a house? Let me see your hands. You do. You do. Okay. So, the bank owns the rest of them. Okay. Is that it? Anybody else own a house? Well, I want you children to know you own a house. You own a house. You don't only have a mansion on the other side, but you own a house. Every one of us has a house and the blood has to be applied. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You children can't look to your mom and dad. You husbands can't look to your wives. You wives can't look to your husbands. Hebrews chapter 3:5. Hebrews chapter 3:5. And Moses verilely was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which were to be spoken after. But Christ as a son over his own house, whose house are we? If we hold fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the hope firm unto the end. Now I just want to hit 14. And for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end. Now we are the house of God if the blood is applied. If the blood isn't applied, the death angel is going to set in. It's a spiritual death. So, the blood has to be applied to your life. You have two side posts. You have a a a a head post as it were, a threshold on top and two side post. And the blood has to be applied. Now, what does that mean? If you walk in when you go home today from church, you're going to enter in the door to your house, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; And everybody can visualize what your house looks like. Our house, it has gray side post and one on top. It's it's got a red. You visualize it as you walk in. Everybody's got that. But you yourself have a door and it's displayed by everybody. Everybody sees your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody sees when you get angry, when you get upset, when you lie, when you all the things that you do, it is seen by your life. &gt;&gt; And the blood has to be applied there. &gt;&gt; Now, what would happen if they did not eat? If they didn't believe in this, if they didn't believe the message of Moses, they wouldn't applied the blood. They literally had to eat the lamb in their home. Jesus said, "Unless you eat the flesh of the son of man, you have no life in you. You drink his blood, you eat his flesh. You have to do that or there's no life in you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, uh, my my flesh it my words are spirit and they are life. It is the word of God that we eat. We come to church, we hear the word, and that word is so real to us that we eat it. We just don't let it go in one ear and out the other. &gt;&gt; We've got to take it and eat it into our house. In other words, though none go with me, still I'll follow him. If I'm the only one that's going to live at my home, I'm going to be that one. I'm not going to I'm not going to rely on my my husband, my wife, my children, my mom, my dad. It does not matter because Christ has called me to be his house. I'm applying the blood. I'm eating the word. I'm becoming the word. The message of the hour is real to me. The highlight of the message of brother Brandham. It means something to me. I've heard his voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm not just It's just another message. &gt;&gt; Not just another message. We'll get into that if we get some time. What the message is, we must apply the life of Christ to our house, our vessel, our body. Get rid of the shenanigans. &gt;&gt; Get rid of acting like you're a Christian, but really you're not. &gt;&gt; We must have the life of Christ. Somebody that acts like a devil and says they are Christian. I am telling you that is the most phony baloney. Jesus taught us by their fruit. The fruit that's coming forth either the blood is applied or it's not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The brother Brandham said it like this. The blood must be on display. The Holy Spirit must be on display. It's nothing that you do in your home. &gt;&gt; And then you you you it's not something that's hid. &gt;&gt; It's not something that you just out there a little bit. Brother Brandon says your life is on display. Everybody sees it. Your enemies see it. Your neighbors see it. Your workers see it. &gt;&gt; It's not two different lives. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's one life. &gt;&gt; Amen. the life for Christ. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the evening time message. How many knows what what brother Brandon said the evening time message was? How many remember brother Brandham saying the message is Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today and forever? &gt;&gt; All right. But he says here in the message the token the evening time message is to apply the token. Well, is it the evening time message or is it is it Jesus Christ the same yesterday or different or is it to apply the token? The token is the life of Christ. The token is the life of Christ which is Jesus Christ the same in you today and forever. &gt;&gt; It is the same thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. The the token applied is Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. Not just at church, not just in some brother or some sister, but in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's what counts. I'm telling you, when the rapture happens, there is nothing that anybody can do to help you make it in. &gt;&gt; Your your sister, your brother, nobody's prayer is going to get you in. This is the hour that the token must be on display, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Don't wait. &gt;&gt; Nothing can take the place of the token. That doesn't matter how long you've been serving the Lord or what great deeds you've done. How many testimonies you can tell, the life has to be on display. The toolken is what God gives you when he has received your faith. &gt;&gt; You can say, "Well, I repented. I believe in Christ. I'm going to get baptized." And you get baptized. And you say you're a believer. Oh, are you a believer? I'm a believer. But it isn't until God ushers you and gives you the Holy Ghost that you truly have been accepted by him. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know that's a strong message, but it's a truth. Jesus said, "I will build my church upon this revelation. Upon this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Christ is building the church, not us. &gt;&gt; Christ is. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're workers together with him. He tells us what to do. We go and do it. And he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that scripture? He gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him. &gt;&gt; We play a part, but it's only Christ that can give us the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We can't do anything to get it. &gt;&gt; We can't make it happen. But if we follow him, ask and it shall be given. Seek and you shall find. Knock and the door shall be open. If we do what Christ said, how much more us being evil, how much more will God give us the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; That's the token. It's the life. It's not going to a church where you feel good. Amen. You know how many good feelood churches are out there? or they're going to miss it. &gt;&gt; It's the blind leading the blind. &gt;&gt; And and nobody wants to come to the facts. I'm so glad, brother Lando, that God sent a prophet because if God wanted to send a prophet, there is no church, there is no way that I ever I could have ever got this truth. &gt;&gt; None. There just isn't. &gt;&gt; I could have got some. &gt;&gt; I could have got because I was in the Catholic church. I could have got some. But to be honest with you, uh, without the message of the hour, I would think I would always have enough. But this tells me that there's more for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; More for us. The greatest thing a believer can do is seek the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Did you know what the revelation of Jesus Christ is? The revelation of Jesus Christ to you is when it's manifested in your flesh. &gt;&gt; It's not what you know, not what you can quote. It's not even when God comes and showers his blessings or gives you faith to cast out devils to to know the seals to know the mysteries to know the thunders to know the plagues all the vials all this is wonderful but until Jesus Christ is manifest in your flesh you don't have enough of the revelation of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; it's not knowledge it's it's a a manifestation where you've given him your body to live through. And I I look at it like this. We were sharing a little bit of this in the men's meeting, but Jesus said, "For this purpose, I came to give my life at Calvary. This is why I came to give my life." But when to the acid test came, he was in the garden praying and he did not want to go. This is a perfect sinless human being in that body that suffered afflictions like you and I and didn't want to go. &gt;&gt; How much more are we not going to want to? &gt;&gt; But he taught us to die out. &gt;&gt; Keep praying. Keep being serious. and end your prayer with not my will but thy will be done. &gt;&gt; The token is the sign that the blood has been applied. Brother Brandham said the life of Christ will be on display. It's we just got to get past this. You you can't say I'm not a Christian. You can't say that I'm not a believer. You can't say I I'm not. You can't say I don't believe. I mean, we need to get beyond that. We should be hungering to say this to one another. Do you see the life of Christ in me? Do you see something that's missing? Do you see that I am not displaying the life of Christ as you see it? &gt;&gt; Now, that's where we should be. You know what? I'm gonna say it again. There should be such a hunger inside of us to make sure that the token has been applied, that the blood is there, that the life is being lived, that we're living for others, &gt;&gt; that we're just not half in and half out. &gt;&gt; It's sad. Some of us are at the age of accountability and we're not even concerned about the life that we're living. We're still depending on mom and dad to tell us when to be good, how to be good, when we should be seeking the Holy Ghost because we're at the age of accountability. &gt;&gt; And I'll tell you, the greatest thing your mom and dad make them the happiest in the whole world is you get the Holy Ghost. There ain't nothing because you just well took the job off their their hands because the parents are the responsibility of being the Holy Ghost until you get the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The prophet said it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of a living God. Look, there was fear and trembling in in the the camp of Israel when they were in Egypt. I am sure that the kids were saying to their dad, "Are you sure the blood's applied? I'm the oldest, you know." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No skin off your teeth, but it is mine. Is the blood applied? And you need to be concerned about yourself. &gt;&gt; All we have to do is believe the word. &gt;&gt; Just believe the word. Get the Holy Ghost. Make it a priority in your life. When brother Brandham said, "Set everything aside until you get perfect love." You know, God is love. &gt;&gt; God is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is the word written on the Holy Ghost is the word alive. So when you lay every side everything aside to get the Holy Ghost or get perfect love, you're literally laying aside everything until you get perfection of the Holy Ghost. Right? Come on now. Because we all got the Holy Ghost in portion, &gt;&gt; but we need enough Holy Ghost that we literally can love our enemy. It's the hardest thing to do. &gt;&gt; It's the hardest thing to do is to love to a place that you lay down everything your whole life and live for your enemy. &gt;&gt; Love the soul of your enemy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's godly love. And to me, that's the token. When you can love your enemy, you've got the token. We all have those internal battles. I'll say it's at that time that Christ must come on display. &gt;&gt; You know, sometimes we get bent out of shape if somebody doesn't keep the door open for us when we're walking through &gt;&gt; or somebody doesn't want to shake hands with us. Right. &gt;&gt; It's it it's sad, but we we have a chance to exercise perfect love. &gt;&gt; If we're just good to those that are good to us, what what good is that? Jesus said, "What good is that?" &gt;&gt; But we should be looking for opportunities to love when somebody uses us. to say all manner of evil against us, to talk behind our back &gt;&gt; because it gives you a chance to manifest Christ. &gt;&gt; And when you can manifest Christ, you're fearless. &gt;&gt; But if you can't manifest Christ, you're like going through the graveyard whistling. &gt;&gt; You're still scared. &gt;&gt; You're scared of the boogeyman's the ghost coming. I don't know. You're scared of something in the graveyard. But when you've got perfect love, you have you boldness. You're not afraid of anything. &gt;&gt; All right. First or Colossians chapter 1 27. Colossians 1 verse 27 Paul speaking to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory everybody that has Christ inside of you. It is the hope of glory. But can we make a rapture with just having Christ in a way of justification? &gt;&gt; We cannot. We cannot make the rapture. There's there's that hope is not there. The only time we can get hope is that when we are willing to work to get Christ all the way in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that means we have to be honest with oursel. Die out to the flesh. &gt;&gt; Be willing to get serious about, you know, sometimes it's hard to get, you know, people motivated to come and get in the prayer closets, to get in the prayer rooms, to spend time listening to tapes. When was the last time you sat down and listened to a tape? &gt;&gt; Well, Brother John, I don't even really listen to them. I come to church and I'm hoping you're going to tell me all about them. Brother Ron was telling me he he's telling me this today. He says, "Um, I was watching this real or or this some information and a man was giving uh the information that if you read your your Bible uh once a week, it doesn't do anything for you." And if you read your Bible twice a week, it doesn't do anything for you. And if you read your Bible three days a week, it doesn't do anything for you. And if you read your Bible four times a week, it won't do anything for you. I wonder if any of this is now making sense. But he says if you read your Bible five times a week, it's 200 it'll it'll draw you closer to God 220% more. It'll help you 220% more. Is that what you said? &gt;&gt; Yeah. It It's like all in or or not not &gt;&gt; Jesus or brother Brandon said like this. If you want to get closer to God, read your Bible and pray every day. &gt;&gt; Not once a week or twice a week or three times a week, but every day. &gt;&gt; That's how you do it. That's how you get more Holy Ghost is be serious. &gt;&gt; Like I really want more Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Don't wait for the preacher to to say come up to the altar or raise your hand. Just make a decision. I want more of God. And start seeking more of God. Because even though you might be in a message church, you might be even in a wonderful church. I would never say you had a wonderful pastor, but you might be in a wonderful church. &gt;&gt; The thing is that's not good enough to get you the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's only set in an atmosphere in which you can get it. &gt;&gt; You still need to I want it. I want it. All right. to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles which is Christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom. What are you doing that for? That we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus. where to I also labor striving according to the working to his working which workketh in me mightily. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Going to read this quote and then we're going to just close. Brother Brandham said this morning. The message this morning to me was the highlight message of my entire ministry. This morning see a highlight message of my entire ministry. Someday I'll tell you how I come about it. And I know that everything has worked for months and months and months up to that one message moving up to come to that place. That was the capping off time of it. You see now I hope that you got what the message the token meant. See the token is a sign that the blood has really been applied. That the price that has been asked or required of God. See Jesus paid the price by the shedding of his own blood. He did that. Then from then from his life came the Holy Spirit. And when the blood is applied to you to your house, the Holy Spirit is the token that your price is paid. That God has received you. That the token remember that is the token. Every see God Calvary was for everybody. &gt;&gt; But until the blood of the life comes inside of you, you personally your price has not been paid. Your price has not been paid personally. That's why in every church there's three types of believers. Some got the Holy Ghost and some don't. And those that got the Holy Ghost, their price is paid. Remember the 10 virgins. Five were wise. Five did not take oil with their vessel. Remember we are the vessels. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the oil has to be inside. &gt;&gt; We can't just say, "Oh, I plead the blood. I plead the blood. I plead the blood." Eventually the the life of the blood has to be inside of us. &gt;&gt; That's what the devil's scared of. &gt;&gt; He's scared of the life. &gt;&gt; He is not scared of of in my name you shall cast out devils. How many times have we tried to cast out a devil out of somebody and it didn't come out? &gt;&gt; You understand what I'm saying? How many times we want to cast out a devil out of somebody? Look, the devil trembles at the weakest one among us when we're on our knees to God. &gt;&gt; It's just getting serious with God. God's on your side. &gt;&gt; God wants to give you the Holy Ghost more than you want it. &gt;&gt; Only you can apply the token. &gt;&gt; Only you can apply his life to you. Only you can say, "I I'm I'm I'm going to stop this and I'm going to start doing that." &gt;&gt; Only you can do that. And I trust by the grace of God that today you're going to make it the highlight of your entire life is to apply Christ to your life. Amen. Let's stand together. Amen. Amen. And amen. Let's sing um at the cross. At the cross. You know how many people the cross will be in vain to? But to us who have received his life, it's not in vain. Amen. Alas, and did my savior bleed? And did my suffering die? Would he devote that sacred head for such a worm as mine? At the cross, at the cross, where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart rode away. It was there by me. I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. Was it for crimes that I have done? He groaned upon a tree. Amazing pity. Grace unknown and love beyond degree. At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart rode away. It was there by faith I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. Well, the sun in darkness is light and shut his glories in. In Christ the mighty maker died for men the creature sin. At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart ro away. It was there by faith. I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. But traps of grief and dare repay the debt of love I hold. Dear Lord, I give myself away is all that I can do. At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart rode away. It was there by faith I received my sight. And now I am happy all the day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where I first saw the light. &gt;&gt; But every time you open up the Bible, &gt;&gt; you see more light. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Every time you come to church, every time you put a tape on, often often we get on our knees and we hear God speak to us. That's light where we're seeing more light. &gt;&gt; And God wants us to walk in that light. You know, I I don't know how many times I've ever looked back and saw didn't know why I was preaching what I was preaching, but it was leading up to what he was trying to get to. &gt;&gt; God wants us to walk in all the light. &gt;&gt; He really wants that blood of life. Amen. Let's bow our heart in a word of prayer. I wonder if there'd be anyone here today that say, "Brother John." I just appreciate special prayer for my house. God bless you. God bless you. Oh, so wonderful. So wonderful. All right, let's approach him in sincerity now. Our heavenly father, we just think about when you told your own prophet of this age to be more sincere. God, the first thing I want to ask you is just help us to be more sincere. Yes, I &gt;&gt; think your word even says to prove the sincerity of our love. Keep your commandments to walk in your will. Thank you for sending a prophet to let us know what was required to make it. And God, all of us, we we've lifted our hands. We've we we know we have a part of you in us. Some are so full, but they want more. How beautiful that is. How beautiful. Lord, we're asking that you would fill every one of us with more of you. We want you to be on display. We don't want to be dealing with our our flesh in an outward way, but we want to keep him crucified. Lord, I pray that you would fill us so full that our cup would be running over like David talked about, "My cup runth over." Fill us with joy unspeakable. Give us so much joy. We can't wait to get to the house of the Lord. As brother Ron said, "Grant it, Lord. Fill us with more of you. More of you. Help us to to take your word when we read it, when we hear it, to eat it. Help us to know what it means to eat your word by simply applying it to our life, Lord. And when we do that, that blood is being applied. It's Jesus on the inside working on the outside. Lord, that's what we're asking. Work in us, Lord. Work in us. your will work in us to do what you want us to do, Lord. Father, I pray for our young people here, Lord, that are in that transition stage. How beautiful it is to get the Holy Ghost before you're at that age of accountability, which we know can happen. But Lord, waiting too long, it's a dangerous a dangerous place to be without the Holy Ghost. And I pray for every young person here that you would fill them with the Holy Spirit. God, keep them from the enemy. Put a hedge of protection around them, Lord. Lord, may they could they be able to just focus on trying to get your attention than the attention of one another. &gt;&gt; Oh God, we love you. We love you. We thank you for filling us with your spirit. We thank you for your promise that if we just seek you, you will you will reveal and you will show yourself. we keep knocking, if we keep asking, Lord, you're going to give us what we want because you gave us that example when that woman and that unjust judge. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. &gt;&gt; Kept calling. Kept calling. Finally, he gave her what she wanted. Even though he wasn't a believer, &gt;&gt; how much more will you avenge your own elect that cried day and night? Yes, &gt;&gt; God. Avenge us of our real adversary, this flesh, &gt;&gt; Lord, and fill us with the goods, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh, we thank you for these things. Now Lord, we pray that you'd bless these upcoming services that we're going to be having with these visiting ministers, oh God, starting this Sunday, Lord, and uh right throughout the next two weeks, we just ask that the word that would be preached would penetrate and and do a work inside of every one of our hearts, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I believe Lord that they're they're here in accordance uh to the working of the Holy Spirit. And I pray that every one of us could just receive more of you, heavenly father. &gt;&gt; We just pray your blessings on the services ahead. know we think.
