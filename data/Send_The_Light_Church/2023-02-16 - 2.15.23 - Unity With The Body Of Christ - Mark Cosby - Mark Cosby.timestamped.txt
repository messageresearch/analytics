[34:41] Lord that we would hear Lord not as it
[34:45] were brother Mark's voice but Lord we
[34:47] would hear your voice speaking amen God
[34:50] you would give us Revelation that would
[34:52] help us in our walk with you that we
[34:55] would come closer to you and mourn your
[34:58] image we pray these things now in Jesus
[35:01] Christ's name amen amen
[35:04] we got two scripture readings for
[35:06] receded uh first one is John 17 21 then
[35:10] the second will be in Genesis 11 5-7.
[35:14] so very familiar scriptures
[35:17] so the title of this uh little part two
[35:19] Unity with the body of Christ amen so
[35:23] the first part we talked about Unity
[35:25] with God our Oneness with God and how
[35:27] important it is for us to be one with
[35:29] God before we even know what true Unity
[35:32] really is because God is true unity and
[35:35] for one with God then we can help be one
[35:38] with the body of Christ
[35:40] so go to John 17 verse 21.
[35:43] that they all may be one as thou father
[35:47] are in me and I in thee
[35:51] that they also may be one in us that the
[35:54] world may believe that thou has sent me
[35:58] so Jesus is really pointing us to this
[36:00] Oneness and unity that we need to have
[36:03] not with this
[36:05] people you like between one another even
[36:08] the people you don't like in fact
[36:10] amen let's go to Genesis 11.
[36:13] we'll read two verses in there
[36:27] verse 5 and the Lord came to see the
[36:31] city in the tower which the children of
[36:34] men builded and the Lord said behold the
[36:37] people is one notice that statement and
[36:39] they have all one language and this they
[36:41] begin to do and now nothing will be
[36:44] restrained from them which they have
[36:45] imagined to do verse 7 go to let us go
[36:49] down and there confound their language
[36:51] that they may not understand one
[36:53] another's speech you may be seated so we
[36:57] see we talk a little bit about last week
[36:58] about this uh this verse but we see that
[37:02] man
[37:03] they were trying notice Gods said they
[37:05] were one but it's not the type of
[37:07] Oneness that God was looking for it was
[37:09] a man-made Oneness God bless you Sister
[37:12] Tasha it's wonderful to see you
[37:14] um so we look at this this Unity that
[37:17] God is trying to strive for that he his
[37:20] perfect plan is for and it can't be
[37:22] anything man-made in between it can't be
[37:25] anything of us in there to create that
[37:28] Unity because our nature
[37:31] um is fickled it's it's faulty and it
[37:35] has selfish motives and God's Unity does
[37:38] not have selfish motives it's to make
[37:40] the people one but in his images One his
[37:43] word in one
[37:45] and so we got a quote gotta quite a few
[37:47] coats quotes to go with this I just felt
[37:49] like it was uh just perfect for this you
[37:52] know God has made man to achieve so
[37:55] there's something inside of us that
[37:57] wants to achieve something
[37:59] and we got to make sure that we're
[38:01] achieving what God wants us to because
[38:03] otherwise you'll be in a substitute
[38:05] trying to achieve something that you can
[38:07] never achieve because you're not trying
[38:09] to achieve what God has placed in your
[38:11] heart that desire that that this hunger
[38:14] just to please him
[38:15] so that was what man was made for and
[38:18] all down through life he has tried to
[38:20] achieve something and his achievements
[38:22] the reason he tries that is because he
[38:25] was so designed to do that so we
[38:27] realized we were designed we were
[38:29] fearfully and wonderfully made
[38:31] God made him that way but the trouble of
[38:33] it is and his achievement he tries to do
[38:36] something within himself so we said
[38:38] before we can't do anything with
[38:40] ourselves we got to recognize like our
[38:42] brother Joseph said or where we came
[38:44] from we got to recognize of the cross
[38:46] that Jesus died upon for us so that we
[38:49] could be here tonight and our strength
[38:51] comes from him everything we have comes
[38:54] from him so if we recognize that then we
[38:56] won't lose sight of what we're called
[38:59] for because we recognize that this life
[39:01] that we're living is not for us but it's
[39:03] for him we're here to serve him and
[39:05] serve God's people that's true servitude
[39:08] it's a true a true servant is
[39:11] that's what that that's where he makes
[39:13] this mistake with me there's where he
[39:15] makes his mistake and he gets in trouble
[39:17] that's from the unity of God in the one
[39:19] Church 1958.
[39:21] now in the beginning Genesis which is
[39:24] the sea chapter of the Bible we find in
[39:27] there that when God made a man he made
[39:29] him in the way that he knew that he was
[39:32] supposed to be so God had a made a
[39:36] perfect man in the Garden of Eden and I
[39:39] believe that perfect man was in harmony
[39:41] with God ends with harmony with all
[39:44] creation
[39:45] because that's how when God makes
[39:46] something that's always perfect
[39:48] no flaws no nothing just perfection at
[39:52] his finest
[39:53] he made him in the way that he knew that
[39:55] he was to be and he could never be any
[39:58] greater design than what he was than
[40:00] what he is when he began to make life he
[40:03] made it from the lowest life which is
[40:05] more or less the pollywog the Frog and
[40:08] unto the highest life is man which is
[40:10] the image of God you know I found this
[40:13] other little this little quota says if
[40:15] we can only get in spiritual Unity with
[40:18] his word and with him
[40:21] so God is always pointing us to the word
[40:23] because he is the word amen and so we
[40:26] got to be in line with the word we said
[40:28] the statement before that the word is
[40:30] not going to conform to your life you
[40:33] must conform to the word
[40:35] and so when we do that we throw all of
[40:37] us out and put all of God in here like
[40:40] John the Baptist said I must decrease so
[40:42] he can increase I was really blessed by
[40:45] the word on Sunday what we're doing to
[40:47] you guys
[40:48] is this that statement I remember
[40:49] brother John has talked about how that
[40:51] what Antichrist is is
[40:54] um not the word not being manifested in
[40:56] here and it's just you know so so simple
[40:59] but so profound
[41:00] because that word has to just live
[41:02] inside of us
[41:04] and I just love that the word just has
[41:06] to constantly live inside of us it can't
[41:08] just be on this paper us just reading it
[41:10] but the thing the word that we're
[41:12] reading has to really just sink inside
[41:14] so that we could become what Christ has
[41:17] caused to be which is the word
[41:19] amen
[41:20] so God's plan from the beginning was to
[41:23] have us in harmony with him that's what
[41:24] we're trying to get back to is
[41:26] everything in harmony once again but
[41:29] we're slowly getting back to it we're
[41:31] slowly God is just shaping us refining
[41:34] us and molding us that we can be in
[41:37] harmony with him
[41:39] because when that that great day comes
[41:41] when he comes in the air and takes us up
[41:44] um it's not always going to happen then
[41:45] but everything we're doing every
[41:46] decision we're making is going to lead
[41:49] us to that Rapture because the Rapture
[41:50] is happening right now
[41:52] and we got to make sure that we're ready
[41:54] for that Rapture because any day we
[41:56] could be called home tomorrow
[41:58] you know we I it's my last term like we
[42:00] preaching this today so we got to make
[42:01] sure that our calling and election is
[42:03] sure is so important
[42:07] and a man can achieve better when
[42:09] they're United so we look at the Tower
[42:10] of Babel they were United in one
[42:14] but once again that's not the even God
[42:16] said the Lord came down to see the City
[42:18] verse six and the Lord said behold the
[42:20] people is one
[42:22] but that Oneness like we said before was
[42:25] man-made we look at Hitler Mussolini
[42:28] Stalin
[42:29] Hitler got the people to be one
[42:32] but it wasn't the right kind of Oneness
[42:35] he he his his whole motive was to make
[42:38] everybody like him everybody not sees
[42:41] every all these things and we see that
[42:44] that Unity he got the people to stand
[42:46] with him for a little bit but eventually
[42:48] that whole regime fell
[42:50] just like the Tower of Babel it fell
[42:52] because it was not pleasing to God and
[42:56] God isn't looking for that type of
[42:57] Oneness in the world he's looking to
[42:59] everybody to be American everybody he's
[43:00] looking at everybody to be born In His
[43:03] Image born again and filled with the
[43:05] Holy Ghost and that's the only way we
[43:07] can achieve a Harmony is the spirit of
[43:09] God dwelling inside of us and we've got
[43:11] to bury that old man daily so we could
[43:15] become one with God and one with one
[43:17] another because God's heart is to see
[43:20] the whole body of Christ working
[43:21] together thinly jointed together because
[43:24] if everybody knows if you break
[43:27] something uh say if you get knee surgery
[43:29] you can't walk or somebody's missing a
[43:32] limb they can't walk but the body of
[43:34] Christ we need all of us
[43:36] we need the big toe we need the arm we
[43:38] need the eyes to have the body
[43:40] functioning
[43:42] and I love how that's how God designed
[43:43] it and we're going to make sure we're
[43:45] following that we all need one another I
[43:47] don't care if we're weak strong whatever
[43:48] it is we need one another we got to come
[43:50] together we got to cry together pray
[43:51] together all these things we've got to
[43:53] come together
[43:55] and man can achieve better when they're
[43:57] United notice that now you take one man
[44:00] by himself his power is limited to one
[44:02] man two men makes him twice his strength
[44:06] four men makes him four times his
[44:08] strength and God wants us to be one
[44:11] praise God God made man that we should
[44:15] be one our motives should be one and our
[44:19] objectives should be one and our
[44:21] achievements should be one he just
[44:24] designed that way
[44:26] that's from the unity of God in the one
[44:29] Church let's go to that uh quote
[44:31] reminded me of Deuteronomy 32 verse 30.
[44:37] see the more we can be Unified
[44:39] that's when the devil can't get in
[44:42] but when we're not unified everybody's
[44:44] doing this thing over here that thing
[44:45] over there that's when the devil can get
[44:47] in and slip things in but if we come
[44:49] together
[44:51] but Lord bind us together there's no
[44:53] devil no demon that can stop the bride
[44:56] working in one Unity
[44:59] so Deuteronomy 32 verse 30.
[45:07] amen
[45:08] so it says how should one chase a
[45:12] thousand and two put ten thousand the
[45:14] flight except that Iraq has sold them
[45:17] and the Lord had shut them up so it is
[45:19] see that Unity we can chase more we can
[45:22] accomplish more in the kingdom of God
[45:25] and that's why how God designed it he
[45:27] didn't design for to be a one-man show
[45:29] but he decided to be a United show and
[45:32] and the world see it's so it's so hard
[45:35] because Society always points us to it's
[45:38] you you all about you but when you come
[45:41] into Christ it's not all about you
[45:43] anymore it's all about others because
[45:45] the very God Of Heaven humbled himself
[45:47] and became a servant
[45:49] and who do we think we are
[45:52] if we don't match that same image
[45:54] following those same footsteps because
[45:57] God came to serve and we need to come to
[45:59] serve one another
[46:00] we got to wash one another's feet
[46:02] spiritually and physically
[46:05] amen and all these things are going on
[46:08] the spirit of living God is striving
[46:10] with flesh trying to get man away from
[46:14] his own achievements so God is
[46:16] constantly trying to to get us away from
[46:19] looking at all our problems like we
[46:21] can't overcome them he's trying to get
[46:23] us away from being all about ourselves
[46:25] and self-conceited and he's trying to
[46:26] get us to see him and who he is he's a
[46:29] provider he's a Waymaker he's all these
[46:32] things Jehovah Raphael Jehovah Jireh
[46:35] he's all these things he wants to be to
[46:36] us but if we can't get our thoughts over
[46:40] our thoughts off off these problems and
[46:42] issues in our life and put our eyes on
[46:45] him then he can't be those things God
[46:47] wants to be all those things in our life
[46:49] but his hands are going to be tied if we
[46:51] can't have faith in him that he can be
[46:53] those things in our life
[46:55] and so faith is such a key point in a
[46:59] Christian's life it's in fact it's the
[47:01] the foundation of a walk because if you
[47:05] don't have faith you can't even please
[47:07] God
[47:08] and so you got to believe and have faith
[47:10] that the body of Christ here can be one
[47:13] you gotta have faith that God can move
[47:16] in any situation in your life no matter
[47:18] how hard you think it is or impossible
[47:21] you think it is he can part any Red Sea
[47:23] in fact he part of the Red Sea for the
[47:25] children of Israel imagine they had
[47:27] probably thousands of Egyptians chasing
[47:30] behind them
[47:31] and so our God
[47:33] is a mighty God he's a powerful God who
[47:36] can't be stopped I love what Jesus said
[47:39] all power is given to me in heaven and
[47:41] in Earth so let's never forget that
[47:45] amen
[47:48] God is striving with flesh trying to get
[47:51] man away from his own achievement trying
[47:54] to get man away from his own selfish
[47:57] motives just like our pastor preached
[47:59] about this our motives we got to make
[48:01] sure our motives are pure and pleasing
[48:04] to God
[48:06] because a mo a wrong motive will lead
[48:09] you down a wrong path as we saw what
[48:11] happened to David that wrong motive let
[48:13] him down a wrong path
[48:15] and as long as a man Works in his own
[48:18] plan he will be a failure every time as
[48:21] long as a man Works in his own plan he
[48:25] will be a failure
[48:27] any man can only achieve right when he
[48:30] comes back with the right objective and
[48:33] the right emotive one more time a man
[48:35] can only achieve right when he's come
[48:37] back with the right objective and the
[48:40] right motive so if you decide if you
[48:42] want unity in the church don't do it
[48:43] just because brother John said or or
[48:46] somebody else said it but do it because
[48:48] you want to please God that's your sole
[48:50] motive we heard that sermon that brother
[48:52] John preached on your motive has to be
[48:54] to please God don't please somebody
[48:56] don't be a man please or be a god
[48:58] pleaser because the end of the day we're
[49:00] serving God and we're not serving we're
[49:02] serving God not Mammon
[49:04] but while we're serving God we are
[49:06] serving others
[49:08] amen
[49:09] when he comes back with the right
[49:11] objective and the right motive that is
[49:13] according to God's plan for him uh any
[49:18] other Foundation is on sinking Sans amen
[49:22] I just suggest me each read this listen
[49:25] to this sermon I love this um
[49:27] this my brother Brandon the unity of one
[49:30] God and the one church I just suggest to
[49:32] listen to that is such a a beautiful
[49:34] just showing what that Unity really is
[49:37] so we must lay aside what we think
[49:40] Harmony is
[49:41] and Oneness and we need to become in
[49:43] unity with God and his word
[49:46] so we got to lay every thought aside
[49:47] that we think what God wants and just
[49:50] really find out what God really wants
[49:52] because I believe that he's given us a
[49:54] blueprint of what he exactly he wants
[49:57] but that blueprint must be quickened in
[50:00] our heart for us to really uh
[50:03] live it out
[50:05] because how many churches are out how
[50:07] many I think there's over like 30 000
[50:09] Christian denominations who say they're
[50:11] in the truth and I believe brother
[50:13] Brandon in his time in the 60s it was
[50:15] 900 so I'm not sure what the math is on
[50:17] that but that's a lot of math and we got
[50:20] to recognize that when we're not we're
[50:22] not a man-made Church we're a holy
[50:24] ghost-led church and the Holy Ghost is
[50:26] leading our church here at sin the light
[50:28] and we have to believe that the Holy
[50:30] Ghost is here
[50:31] speak into our hearts and leading us
[50:33] into the spirit of unity with him
[50:34] because on the other side
[50:37] everything is going to be in unity in
[50:39] one that's what God is trying to prepare
[50:41] us for is for that other side amen
[50:44] and we have to recognize that God is
[50:47] love
[50:49] and we need that love to even get over
[50:51] there on the other side we need that
[50:53] love to love one another the proper way
[50:55] because God's love is Limitless our love
[50:59] has its limits it can only love so far
[51:02] but God's love is you could stretch it
[51:06] from Sky to Sky and it still wouldn't
[51:08] even escape the surface of that love so
[51:11] we got to recognize we've got to take
[51:13] our love out and let God's love fill us
[51:15] all the way up
[51:19] and the thing is we must be in great
[51:21] desperation and desire for this Unity it
[51:24] has to be something that you you have to
[51:26] desire for you have to be desperate for
[51:28] and we're going to just pick that up in
[51:30] psalm 63.
[51:37] 63 verse 1.
[51:40] and it says
[51:42] oh God Thou Art my God
[51:45] early will I seek thee
[51:48] notice this uh this uh what David's
[51:52] saying right here my soul thirsted for
[51:55] thee
[51:56] My Flesh longer for thee in a dry and
[51:59] thirsty land where no water is how many
[52:01] has been really thirsty and very parched
[52:03] and you just you just needed water you
[52:05] just couldn't live without water that's
[52:07] how David feels when he's seeking and
[52:10] searching for God and that's what we
[52:12] need as well to be one with God and to
[52:14] be one with the body of Christ we got it
[52:17] at his hunger and thirst for that
[52:18] because I believe the the spirit of the
[52:21] the spirit of the Living God wants his
[52:23] people just to be one
[52:27] and this is such a beautiful thing just
[52:29] to see that
[52:30] to see thy power and thy Glory verse two
[52:34] so as I've seen thee in the sanctuary
[52:36] because thy loving kindness love loving
[52:39] kindness is like favor
[52:40] is better than life my lips shall praise
[52:44] thee verse 4 thus will I bless thee
[52:47] while I live I will lift up my hands in
[52:50] thy name
[52:51] verse 5 my soul shall be satisfied as
[52:54] with marrow and fatness and my mouth
[52:57] shall praise thee with joyful lips verse
[53:00] six when I remember thee upon my bed and
[53:04] meditate
[53:05] on thee in the night watches because
[53:08] thou has been my help therefore in the
[53:11] shadow of thy Wings will I rejoice
[53:14] I just love the book of Psalms that's
[53:16] one of something that's about the book
[53:17] of Psalms is one of my favorites because
[53:19] you just see a a man after God's Own
[53:21] Heart but you realize that he's human
[53:23] just like you and I and he he had ups
[53:26] and downs and he just wanted God to be
[53:28] present in his life at all times of his
[53:31] life no matter if he messed up he would
[53:33] truly repent and turn away from his ways
[53:35] and I believe we can relate to all these
[53:38] Bible characters because they were like
[53:40] us with like passions and we got to just
[53:42] recognize and see that these men weren't
[53:45] called because they were perfect that's
[53:47] right no but God called them to
[53:49] Perfection just like he's calling his
[53:51] bride which I believe all the bride's
[53:53] here tonight and he's calling us into
[53:55] perfection in that uniting time but we
[53:58] still have work to do while we're in
[54:00] going into perfection
[54:02] amen Ephesians 4.
[54:13] the very familiar scriptures and we'll
[54:15] start with verse one and we'll actually
[54:17] go to verse six sorry about that Anne
[54:24] say Amen when you guys get there
[54:26] I love to hear the the pages turn
[54:29] so verse 1 I therefore the prisoner of
[54:32] the Lord how many are prisoners of the
[54:34] Lord tonight
[54:36] amen amen I love that amen
[54:41] prison of the Lord beseech you that you
[54:43] walk worthy of the vocation wherewith
[54:46] you are called so we're called to
[54:48] something much higher than we can even
[54:51] realize a high calling that goes beyond
[54:54] all our emotions and all our feelings
[54:55] when we should be Dishonored and
[54:58] privileged that God would even call us
[55:00] who are we to even be called to in this
[55:03] vocation in this life that we're living
[55:06] verse 2 with all lowliness and meekness
[55:09] with long-suffering forbearing one
[55:12] another in love
[55:14] so I know we all have we all have flaws
[55:17] and we could probably sit here and maybe
[55:20] even Point each other's flaws out but
[55:22] that's not what the love of God does it
[55:24] doesn't point out flaws it doesn't maybe
[55:26] somebody choosing here too loud maybe
[55:28] somebody chooses their mouth open
[55:30] God doesn't look at those things he
[55:33] looks as his bride being one and we
[55:35] don't come together because we all like
[55:36] chicken or we all like hamburgers but we
[55:38] come together because we love God and we
[55:41] love his word and want to see his word
[55:43] fulfilled in our lives in our church in
[55:45] our body and that's why we come together
[55:47] but we got to lay aside everything
[55:49] that's right that is contrary everything
[55:53] that's fleshly and just want what God
[55:56] wants
[55:58] verse 3 endeavoring notice that word
[56:01] endeavoring so it's something you gotta
[56:03] fight you got to fight to keep you you
[56:05] gotta fight to keep peace because the
[56:07] enemy was so loved to take away Unity he
[56:11] was so loved to seek kill and destroy in
[56:14] this church but we got to Endeavor to
[56:17] keep him out we got to be sober be
[56:19] vigilant because our enemy he's crafty
[56:22] and cunning but we serve a god who's
[56:25] powerful who is defeated this creature
[56:27] he's a defeated creature he has no power
[56:30] over you if you're in Oneness with God
[56:33] because if we're Oneness with God then
[56:35] the body of Christ can be won
[56:38] and that enemy
[56:40] is he's false he's a liar
[56:43] keep going this is one body knows this
[56:46] is one body it's not a five-man show a
[56:48] two-man show but it's one body
[56:51] one Spirit even as ye are called and one
[56:55] hope of your calling is talking to all
[56:57] of us
[56:58] verse five one Lord One Faith one
[57:02] baptism
[57:04] one God and Father over all who's above
[57:07] all and through all and in you all
[57:08] notice all that one one one one one one
[57:10] one
[57:10] he's calling us to Unity to Oneness and
[57:14] we got to recognize that in order for
[57:16] our body to function properly we got to
[57:19] work together
[57:20] if we're on a basketball team and I had
[57:23] the ball and I'm just ball hogging and
[57:25] not passion the ball ever and I may be
[57:27] scoring 40 points but we're losing about
[57:29] 50 points every game
[57:30] there's no chemistry so it's like in
[57:33] sports there has to be a chemistry in
[57:36] order for you to win the gold win a
[57:38] championship so the same thing in the
[57:39] body of Christ there has to be a
[57:42] spiritual chemistry for us to work
[57:45] together not every person not not just
[57:48] one person can just do every single
[57:49] thing in the church that's why God has a
[57:52] set up and established for churches to
[57:54] have many members it's a mini body
[57:56] remember church for a reason so we all
[57:58] can play our part and do our role not
[58:01] everybody be become a minister not
[58:03] everybody can become a deacon everybody
[58:06] become this but there's so many roles
[58:08] that we could become but I know one role
[58:11] that we all are called into is being
[58:12] ambassadors to help one another to
[58:15] encourage one another to disciple one
[58:17] another all these things are part of the
[58:20] body jobs in the body even cleaning the
[58:23] church
[58:24] that's a job so all these things it's
[58:27] not just one thing one one of these
[58:29] things but it's all these things that
[58:31] God is looking at in in a church because
[58:33] in order for a church to work properly
[58:35] there certain roles have to be filled
[58:38] and not everybody can be a Indian or a
[58:41] chief there's Indians you know so we all
[58:44] can't be the head honcho in Chief that's
[58:46] why God has said brother John is a
[58:48] pastor for a reason he was the only man
[58:51] that for the job God chosen for a
[58:53] specific reason to lead us and so we got
[58:56] to trust that the office that God has
[58:58] called him into the Holy Ghost is using
[59:01] Brother John to lead us to the Rapture
[59:03] to lead us to a closer walk with God so
[59:06] we got to have faith in that that the
[59:07] office that he's called in
[59:09] let's go to um Acts 2.
[59:21] 2 so we see in the day of Pentecost we
[59:25] see that they were all in one Accord one
[59:29] mind everything was one it was all about
[59:32] God they all recognize and realize that
[59:35] they they needed that promise before
[59:37] they could become what God wanted them
[59:40] to become they had to be one in order to
[59:43] receive
[59:44] the one Holy Ghost baptism
[59:46] that's a mouthful to say but we see in
[59:49] verse one and when the day of Pentecost
[59:51] was fully come come they were with all
[59:55] one Accord in one place all the people
[59:57] up there was a hundred and some people
[59:59] just imagine they were all in one Accord
[1:00:01] one Unity
[1:00:03] and look what happened to them and
[1:00:06] suddenly there came a sound from Heaven
[1:00:07] as a of a rushing Mighty Wind and it
[1:00:10] filled all the house
[1:00:12] they were sitting and it appeared onto
[1:00:14] them cloven tongues like it's a fire and
[1:00:16] it set upon them and they were all
[1:00:18] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[1:00:20] speak with other tongues as the spirit
[1:00:21] gave them utterance so notice I believe
[1:00:24] the same thing can happen in our church
[1:00:25] the Holy Ghost can give us a refilling
[1:00:27] it could baptize us
[1:00:30] and that's scriptural because the Holy
[1:00:32] Ghost baptized them again if you look
[1:00:34] throughout the Book of Acts and I
[1:00:37] believe that we need a refilling
[1:00:39] constantly because we see that Parable
[1:00:41] with the the wise and the foolish
[1:00:43] virgins they had some oil in their lamps
[1:00:45] the foolish but they never got refilled
[1:00:49] over and over again like the wise did
[1:00:51] and so I believe that we're wise virgins
[1:00:54] and I believe we need a refilling daily
[1:00:58] I believe
[1:01:00] so we find out going back to the tower
[1:01:03] Babel and we found out that they've
[1:01:04] tried to unite they begin to come one
[1:01:07] person but in this United they did that
[1:01:10] time it was under political power so we
[1:01:12] see the UN United Nations they're trying
[1:01:15] to unite under man-made conditions and
[1:01:19] they wonder why it doesn't work out
[1:01:21] because for for instance for one
[1:01:23] instance every man is right in his own
[1:01:26] eyes that's number one right there if
[1:01:28] they'll recognize that how many wars
[1:01:30] have we been fought over religion
[1:01:33] you see um all we can name all these
[1:01:36] great
[1:01:37] um so-called what they call Great Attila
[1:01:40] the Hun uh Genghis Khan all these
[1:01:42] Empires that what fell
[1:01:45] Napoleon fell
[1:01:47] all these Powers because they don't
[1:01:50] recognize and realize that they're going
[1:01:51] the wrong way to try to bring Unity
[1:01:54] you can't bring Unity based upon your
[1:01:56] your selfishness and your selfish
[1:01:58] motives but you have to go the way God
[1:02:01] intends for you to make Unity that's why
[1:02:03] they will always fall kingdoms will
[1:02:05] always fall
[1:02:09] under political power Man became one the
[1:02:13] only objective was one their achievement
[1:02:15] was one but it was a wrong kind of one
[1:02:18] because his reason it was against the
[1:02:22] plan of God but he continued to go on so
[1:02:25] we see all throughout history man is
[1:02:27] always trying to rule and unite and
[1:02:30] every time
[1:02:32] leaves to death and destruction every
[1:02:34] single time
[1:02:36] death and destruction
[1:02:38] and finally when you when you find Unity
[1:02:40] amongst the people like that they do
[1:02:42] great things you just look over the
[1:02:44] world today when people unified
[1:02:45] themselves together yet under the wrong
[1:02:48] plan they do great things so we see
[1:02:50] Hitler he he conquered a lot of Europe
[1:02:53] he did these great things that he
[1:02:55] thought were great
[1:02:56] but eventually
[1:02:58] he fell
[1:03:00] so he they see man when they United
[1:03:03] together they can do great things they
[1:03:05] uh automobile airplane
[1:03:08] uh we got buildings all these things
[1:03:10] they can do but the problem is they're
[1:03:13] all perversions of God
[1:03:16] see that that Unity see the devil is
[1:03:18] trying to get people in unity as well as
[1:03:20] well even though his Unity may look like
[1:03:22] chaos and all these things but his Unity
[1:03:25] is division yes Discord yes
[1:03:28] and if he can get people to be in
[1:03:31] division and Discord then his his plan
[1:03:33] is working out for Unity
[1:03:35] and so we got to recognize when the
[1:03:37] devil is trying to slip something in
[1:03:40] because when he slips something in
[1:03:42] that's when division happens isms and
[1:03:44] schisms and we want to just kick all
[1:03:46] those things out of our church and just
[1:03:49] kick Satan out and just want to just put
[1:03:51] him on blast as they would say yeah
[1:03:54] now
[1:03:56] they built a tower which I doubt that
[1:03:59] modern science could build today with
[1:04:01] all their machines and things because
[1:04:03] they were United together
[1:04:05] they had one Mind One Soul one purpose
[1:04:08] one mode of one objective now imagine
[1:04:10] this if they could have all those things
[1:04:12] in being one imagine what the body of
[1:04:15] Christ could accomplish could achieve
[1:04:17] being in one mind one body and one
[1:04:20] Spirit One Faith one baptism it's
[1:04:22] imagine the things that we we can't even
[1:04:24] comprehend that God can do in our church
[1:04:26] and move in our church just by being one
[1:04:28] with him
[1:04:30] and they tried to build a tower so high
[1:04:33] notice this the uh just notice this the
[1:04:36] cardinality behind this tower that if
[1:04:38] God ever took a notion to destroy them
[1:04:40] again they run them right up into the
[1:04:42] heavens with them so I just like so so
[1:04:44] so man recognize and realized that God
[1:04:48] flooded the Earth right
[1:04:50] but they don't look and realize why he
[1:04:53] did that
[1:04:54] because they were Wicked they were
[1:04:56] sinful they turned their back from God
[1:04:57] so now they have this idea where I can
[1:04:59] build this Tower
[1:05:01] to Heaven that God if he would try to
[1:05:04] destroy him again he can't
[1:05:05] but this is so this is God they don't
[1:05:08] realize how powerful God is they run up
[1:05:10] them right into Heavens with him and
[1:05:12] there'd be no way that they could keep
[1:05:14] him from doing it or he could keep them
[1:05:16] from doing it as they thought and we
[1:05:18] find out that they organize themselves
[1:05:20] together
[1:05:21] and we find them again completely out of
[1:05:24] the will of God see if man would just
[1:05:27] surrender and submit itself to the
[1:05:28] Living God they would avoid so Much
[1:05:31] Death and destruction unnecessary death
[1:05:33] and destruction in this world but we
[1:05:35] know what Spirit they're influenced by
[1:05:38] and whoever you yield yourself servant
[1:05:40] to your servant to
[1:05:44] go to Psalms 133.
[1:05:55] and we'll read verses one through three
[1:05:56] it's very familiar scripture
[1:05:58] you guys say Amen when you get there
[1:06:06] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[1:06:09] for Brethren to dwell together in unity
[1:06:11] I mean I love that read that again
[1:06:13] behold how good and how pleasant it is
[1:06:16] for Brethren to dwell together in unity
[1:06:19] verse two it is like the precious
[1:06:22] ointment upon the head that ran down
[1:06:24] upon the beard even Aaron's beard that
[1:06:27] went down to the skirts of His Garment
[1:06:30] as the Dew of Herriman and as the Dew
[1:06:33] that descended upon the mountains of
[1:06:35] Zion for there the Lord commanded the
[1:06:38] blessings even life forevermore
[1:06:42] so we notice how displeasing it is
[1:06:44] for God's bride to dwell together in
[1:06:47] unity I believe it just pleases his
[1:06:50] heart it touches his heart because he
[1:06:51] feels welcome there because it's only
[1:06:54] love there and not division but it's
[1:06:56] love
[1:06:57] I'll look the word of unity I was just
[1:06:59] curious what um I like using the
[1:07:01] Webster's I think 1828 dictionary I just
[1:07:03] I just love this to just the words
[1:07:05] because a lot of times they nowadays
[1:07:06] they change the words and all these all
[1:07:09] these things but this is the definition
[1:07:10] that it gives it Unity of spirit
[1:07:14] is the Oneness which subsists between
[1:07:16] Christ and his Saints by which the Same
[1:07:19] Spirit dwells in both and both have the
[1:07:22] same deposition and aims and is the
[1:07:25] Oneness of Christians among themselves
[1:07:27] United under the same head I love as
[1:07:31] having the same Spirit dwelling in them
[1:07:33] and possessing the same Grace Faith Love
[1:07:36] and Hope and Etc and in another
[1:07:38] definition the state of being one
[1:07:40] Oneness Unity May consist of a simple or
[1:07:44] existing between as the soul but it
[1:07:47] usually consists in a close Junction of
[1:07:50] particles
[1:07:51] or parts
[1:07:53] Consulting a body detached from other
[1:07:55] bodies Unity is a thing undivided itself
[1:07:59] but separate from every other thing so
[1:08:02] the world is just
[1:08:04] pushed out and it's all Unity I love
[1:08:06] that let's go back to um Ephesians 4
[1:08:09] again
[1:08:17] so it is seeing in heaven
[1:08:19] there has to be unity and Oneness so we
[1:08:22] see somehow the devil
[1:08:25] was able to get a third of the Angels so
[1:08:29] he was able to get them in unity and
[1:08:31] Oneness with his uh selfish plan
[1:08:36] and we see that as we see we got to
[1:08:38] recognize how cunning our enemies like I
[1:08:39] said before if we don't recognize we got
[1:08:42] to realize that he's a good enemy and we
[1:08:44] got to recognize that we cannot defeat
[1:08:45] him ourselves
[1:08:46] and we can only defeat him through the
[1:08:49] power of God
[1:08:51] and God is the only one who can defeat
[1:08:52] the Devil in fact he's defeated him
[1:08:54] already he's a defeated creature and if
[1:08:56] we can recognize that more than more we
[1:08:58] can say boo back to the devil
[1:09:00] and we got to realize and recognize that
[1:09:03] God is using the devil for us to get
[1:09:06] closer to God through the fiery trials
[1:09:09] opportunity for us to get christ-like
[1:09:11] character so the devil isn't going to
[1:09:12] realize that he's being used to help us
[1:09:15] get one step closer to the Rapture I'm
[1:09:17] saying one more time the devil doesn't
[1:09:18] realize that he's being used to help us
[1:09:20] to get one step closest to the rapture
[1:09:22] so we should be glory in our
[1:09:24] tribulations and our trials because it's
[1:09:26] taking us one step closer to being
[1:09:29] eternally in the presence of God never
[1:09:31] to leave no more sorrow over there I
[1:09:34] love that what a day glorious day that
[1:09:37] will be amen uh let me get to Ephesians
[1:09:40] 4.
[1:09:42] can we uh put up verse 1 Ephesians 4
[1:09:44] verse 1.
[1:09:46] therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[1:09:48] beseech you that you walk worthy of the
[1:09:50] vocation wherewith you are called I look
[1:09:53] at the word vocation up among divines a
[1:09:56] calling by the will of God I love that
[1:09:58] so you're called by the will of God I
[1:10:01] love that or the bestowment of God
[1:10:03] distinguishing Grace upon a person or
[1:10:06] Nation by which that person or nation is
[1:10:09] put in the way of Salvation as a
[1:10:12] vocation of the Jews under the old
[1:10:14] dispensation and the Gentiles under the
[1:10:17] gospel
[1:10:19] verse 2.
[1:10:21] with all lowliness and meekness with
[1:10:23] long-suffering forbearing one another
[1:10:25] with love so there's going to be before
[1:10:28] we're called home I guarantee you one of
[1:10:31] us
[1:10:31] is going to say something that's gonna
[1:10:34] hurt a little bit
[1:10:36] it could be uh whatever it could be you
[1:10:39] fill in the blank it could be something
[1:10:41] love through scripture or it could be
[1:10:43] something we just weren't in the right
[1:10:45] spirit and we said something bad and we
[1:10:47] got to be willing to Long suffer we
[1:10:50] gotta be willing to forgive
[1:10:52] because it's it's actually so much
[1:10:54] harder actually to hold on to a grudge
[1:10:56] it actually hurts you more than you
[1:10:58] realize you holding on to The Grudge and
[1:11:01] it's
[1:11:02] we look in the scripture Jesus
[1:11:04] said in Matthew 6 let's go to that
[1:11:08] Matthew 6.
[1:11:12] it'll go with a verse
[1:11:16] 15 6 15.
[1:11:20] but if you forgive not men their
[1:11:22] trespasses neither will your father
[1:11:24] forgive your trespasses
[1:11:26] so for not feel for not willing to
[1:11:29] forgive then how can God forgive us
[1:11:31] because I guarantee you
[1:11:33] we did so many things to hurt him in
[1:11:36] fact when he died upon that cross he
[1:11:38] bore every sin Hallelujah every lie
[1:11:41] everything every addiction that you had
[1:11:44] he bore on the cross for you and you you
[1:11:47] see what he said he said father forgive
[1:11:49] them they know not what they do he
[1:11:50] didn't say how dare you mark for doing
[1:11:53] this uh when you were 15 years old or 17
[1:11:56] years old he doesn't look at those
[1:11:58] things what he looks as is that finished
[1:12:01] product when he died upon that cross he
[1:12:03] he saw a finished product of you a
[1:12:05] Finnish Masterpiece of you so he's
[1:12:09] constantly sculpting us
[1:12:11] molding us and just shaping that that
[1:12:13] perfect sculpture because he knows
[1:12:16] exactly what it's going to look like
[1:12:18] he's just refining it
[1:12:19] and he's building it until that day when
[1:12:21] it's complete completely finished
[1:12:25] amen
[1:12:27] you take a fine piece of Machinery like
[1:12:29] a watch and let every piece of that
[1:12:32] Machinery work in harmony notice that in
[1:12:34] order for even a car to work properly
[1:12:37] all the Pistons the engine has to be set
[1:12:40] properly the tires have to be on
[1:12:42] properly every piece has to be in order
[1:12:44] in order for a car to fully function and
[1:12:48] if not the check engine light is going
[1:12:49] to come on or the car might not start
[1:12:53] so we we got to recognize and just kind
[1:12:55] of type that because if if the see the
[1:12:58] world is trying to type something that
[1:13:01] God
[1:13:02] is already perfect see the world is
[1:13:04] trying to mimic God Satan is always
[1:13:06] trying to mimic God uh we got Carl's the
[1:13:08] horsepowers and they still use
[1:13:10] horsepower we got a man over here trying
[1:13:13] to rush her trying to conquer the world
[1:13:17] all these things we see man is trying to
[1:13:20] do which is a perversion of what God has
[1:13:23] already done it's very forever settled
[1:13:25] in heaven
[1:13:26] and we have to recognize we can't take a
[1:13:29] substitute for what God has already
[1:13:31] because any substitute will leave you
[1:13:34] wanting and lusting for more but if it's
[1:13:39] what God has given you it will fill you
[1:13:41] up your cup will overflow as the
[1:13:43] scripture tells us
[1:13:46] but when one piece gets one way in one
[1:13:48] another it won't keep time no matter how
[1:13:51] good the jewels are it's all got to be
[1:13:54] unified together we look at our bodies
[1:13:57] everything has to be in unity your brain
[1:13:59] has to be put in the right signals to
[1:14:02] your body for your heart to pump and
[1:14:04] then your brain has to move so your legs
[1:14:07] can do this so we see all the how God
[1:14:09] has made the body it's beautiful the
[1:14:11] anatomy of a body
[1:14:13] and now we look at the anatomy of a
[1:14:15] spiritual body of Christ how beautiful
[1:14:17] it is when it's all working together in
[1:14:19] harmony God just begins to pour
[1:14:21] blessings he begins to answer prayers he
[1:14:23] begins to see things can be hindered
[1:14:26] when we leave things undone in our life
[1:14:28] so we got to make sure that every stone
[1:14:30] is unturned so God can move freely
[1:14:34] in our church
[1:14:37] and that's God's purpose for us to unify
[1:14:42] together and be one
[1:14:44] let's go to Ephesians 4 16.
[1:14:51] amen
[1:14:56] For Whom the whole body notice right
[1:14:58] here fitly jointed together it doesn't
[1:15:01] say off-centered doesn't say the legs
[1:15:05] over here missing and the big toes over
[1:15:07] here what it says from whom the whole
[1:15:08] body fitly jointed together notices and
[1:15:13] compacted by that which every all of us
[1:15:16] joint supplyeth according to the factual
[1:15:21] effectual working in the measure of
[1:15:23] every part making increase of the body
[1:15:27] unto the edifying of itself in love so
[1:15:31] it takes love for the body of Christ to
[1:15:34] be fitly jointed together
[1:15:37] we can't say this person is better than
[1:15:39] this person that person is better than
[1:15:40] that person but we're all big important
[1:15:43] inside of God God all loves us the same
[1:15:46] he doesn't love you more than he loves
[1:15:48] you or me he loves you with all his
[1:15:50] heart
[1:15:52] so we got to recognize that that it's
[1:15:54] it's not about
[1:15:55] how how big we are or how little we are
[1:15:58] it's just about how big is God in our
[1:16:00] life how big are we making God in our
[1:16:02] life that's what the most important
[1:16:03] thing is you see the center of your life
[1:16:05] or is he just a part of your life say it
[1:16:07] one more time is he the center of your
[1:16:09] life or is he just a part of your life
[1:16:11] see God desires to be the center of all
[1:16:14] that you do not just 98 not 99 but a
[1:16:18] hundred percent
[1:16:19] of your life
[1:16:21] verse 17.
[1:16:23] this I say therefore and testify in the
[1:16:25] Lord that he henceforth walk not as
[1:16:28] other Gentiles walk in the vanity of
[1:16:30] their mind
[1:16:31] having the understanding darkened being
[1:16:34] alienated from the life of God through
[1:16:36] the ignorance that is in them because of
[1:16:38] the blindness of their heart so we saw
[1:16:40] these dictators and everything that's
[1:16:41] the reason why they're blinded
[1:16:43] and God God said he'll give you over to
[1:16:46] to believe a lie if you want to and so
[1:16:49] we have to recognize and realize that
[1:16:52] that we need to our minds to be clear we
[1:16:55] need our minds to be free from the devil
[1:16:58] we could the greatest spell ever thought
[1:17:00] is in your mind
[1:17:01] and if Satan get one thought in there
[1:17:03] and get you to feed on it then he has
[1:17:05] you but we got to be like brother like
[1:17:07] the brother John said in John 4 1 you
[1:17:09] got to try the spirit
[1:17:11] we can't decide anything that's coming
[1:17:13] to our minds we got to be willing to if
[1:17:15] a negative thought comes in about a
[1:17:16] brother you kick it out and you pray for
[1:17:19] that brother or sister
[1:17:20] because prayer because getting the
[1:17:22] presence of God all those thoughts will
[1:17:24] vanish away
[1:17:26] but we got to kick him out though that's
[1:17:27] the thing God isn't going to do it for
[1:17:29] you because you're a Son of God or a
[1:17:30] daughter of God
[1:17:33] alienated from the life of God through
[1:17:34] the ignorance that is in them because of
[1:17:36] the blindness of their heart verse 19
[1:17:38] who being passed
[1:17:40] feeling have been giving themselves over
[1:17:43] until lasciviousness
[1:17:44] to work all uncleanliness uncleanness
[1:17:48] with greediness but ye have not so
[1:17:50] learned Christ it's time it's talking to
[1:17:52] us but you have not so long Christ I
[1:17:54] love that
[1:17:55] if so be that you've heard him and have
[1:17:57] been taught by him
[1:17:59] as the truth is in Jesus how many
[1:18:01] believe they have been heard him and
[1:18:02] been taught by him how many believe that
[1:18:04] tonight
[1:18:05] says that you put off concerning the
[1:18:08] former conversation of the old man we
[1:18:10] got to bury that old man
[1:18:13] which is corrupt according to deceitful
[1:18:16] lust no to verse 23 right here and be
[1:18:19] renewed in the spirit of your mind
[1:18:24] so you don't have to your mind does not
[1:18:26] have to be a Devil's Playground amen
[1:18:28] amen your mind can be dedicated to God
[1:18:31] your mind can be dedicated to just
[1:18:34] positive thoughts about others about
[1:18:37] just seeing a vision of others coming
[1:18:40] into uh the unity with Christ but we got
[1:18:43] to lead by example though we can't just
[1:18:46] talk the talk we gotta walk the walk we
[1:18:48] heard that saying before
[1:18:50] so and be renewed in the spirit of your
[1:18:52] mind and that you put on the new man I
[1:18:55] love that which after God is created in
[1:18:58] righteousness and truthness in verse 25
[1:19:01] wherefore putting away lying
[1:19:04] speak every man truth with his neighbor
[1:19:06] if we are members one of another for we
[1:19:10] are members one of another
[1:19:13] let's go to Philippians 2.
[1:19:21] so if they're yeah if there'd be there
[1:19:24] for any consolation in Christ if any
[1:19:28] comfort of love if any Fellowship of the
[1:19:31] spirit if any bowels in mercies verse 2
[1:19:34] fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded
[1:19:39] it's not talking about the
[1:19:40] like-mindedness of you like Cedar Point
[1:19:42] I like Six Flags it's not that kind of
[1:19:44] you like Chevy's I like GMC's or you
[1:19:47] like Chevys I like the Ferraris no none
[1:19:50] of that stuff matters not talking about
[1:19:52] that it's talking about spiritual mind
[1:19:55] spiritual Accord spiritual Oneness so
[1:19:59] it's the same love those have the same
[1:20:01] love so we've got to have that love of
[1:20:02] Christ in US
[1:20:04] because our love only goes so far but
[1:20:06] the love of Christ will mend or men
[1:20:10] something that we thought that couldn't
[1:20:11] be mended amen it will create something
[1:20:13] atmosphere that we thought that never
[1:20:15] could be created
[1:20:16] we gotta recognize that God can he
[1:20:19] doesn't patch up he makes new we got to
[1:20:21] recognize that he doesn't patch up he
[1:20:23] makes new
[1:20:24] so it says of one Accord of one mind
[1:20:27] verse three let nothing be done through
[1:20:29] Strife or vainglory
[1:20:31] so when we're doing something for God
[1:20:34] we're not here to get an award or have a
[1:20:37] standing ovation or flowers thrown but
[1:20:40] we're here
[1:20:42] for God to get the glory and honor let
[1:20:44] him get all those things let him get
[1:20:46] praised and worshiped
[1:20:51] says but loneliness of Mind Let each
[1:20:54] esteem other better than themselves one
[1:20:57] more time let each esteem other better
[1:21:00] than themselves let's edify one another
[1:21:02] let's build one another up and not tear
[1:21:04] down
[1:21:05] because the enemy job is to tear one
[1:21:07] another down if he can get us to bite
[1:21:09] and devour
[1:21:10] then the unity can't be had in a church
[1:21:12] but if we take that out of a church the
[1:21:15] body and devouring and just coming
[1:21:17] together and loving one another the
[1:21:19] natural in unity can be truly achieved
[1:21:21] the way God wants it to be
[1:21:23] verse 4 looking at every man on his own
[1:21:26] things but every man also on the things
[1:21:28] of others verse five I believe reverse
[1:21:31] five is so important this is that's the
[1:21:33] mind he was talking about in uh verse
[1:21:35] two that you be like-minded that's what
[1:21:37] he's talking about right here let this
[1:21:39] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[1:21:41] Jesus imagine we all have the mind of
[1:21:43] Christ
[1:21:44] and guess what the mind of Christ did it
[1:21:47] served
[1:21:48] it was willing to take weapons beatings
[1:21:50] it was willing to uh be ridiculed it was
[1:21:54] willing to suffer for living for God
[1:21:57] so that that Minds in us then it's going
[1:22:00] to strive and look for how to get more
[1:22:03] unity in a church it just has to be
[1:22:05] that's the mind of Christ
[1:22:08] who being in the form of God thought it
[1:22:10] not robbery to be equal with God but
[1:22:12] look at verse 7 says
[1:22:14] the very God Of Heaven
[1:22:17] came off his throne came out from being
[1:22:20] worshiped in heaven
[1:22:22] to being to made himself no reputation
[1:22:25] he didn't care about reputation all he
[1:22:27] cared about was you and I all he cared
[1:22:29] about was
[1:22:30] you and I being like him he became you
[1:22:34] that we could become him but made
[1:22:37] himself no reputation and took upon him
[1:22:39] the form of a servant
[1:22:41] and was made in the likeness of men and
[1:22:44] being found in fashion as a man he
[1:22:46] humbled himself and became obedient unto
[1:22:49] death
[1:22:50] even the death of the cross
[1:22:53] we got two more scriptures and we'll
[1:22:55] close first Peter 3 or First Peter 1 3
[1:22:58] because there's no such thing as first
[1:23:00] Peter three three Peter
[1:23:04] don't worry I'm not making scriptures up
[1:23:06] I promise
[1:23:09] verse 8.
[1:23:12] notice this
[1:23:14] finally be all of One mind I love that
[1:23:19] mind of Christ having compassion notice
[1:23:22] that one of another love as Brethren be
[1:23:25] pitiful and be courteous not rendering
[1:23:28] evil for evil or rallying for rallying
[1:23:31] but contrast blessing knowing that you
[1:23:34] are there and to call that you should
[1:23:36] inherit a blessing so when somebody does
[1:23:38] you wrong don't do wrong back to them
[1:23:41] because that's not that's not
[1:23:43] christ-like
[1:23:45] the devil does things like that
[1:23:47] says
[1:23:49] for he that will love life and see good
[1:23:51] days let him refrain his tongue from
[1:23:54] evil like you said brother Jonathan
[1:23:55] power and life in the death of tongue in
[1:23:57] his lips that they speak no guile verse
[1:24:00] 11.
[1:24:01] let him eschew evil and do good let him
[1:24:04] speak peace
[1:24:06] and ensue it and the word issue means to
[1:24:09] flee from to shun to avoid
[1:24:12] in verse 12 for the eyes of the Lord are
[1:24:14] over the righteous and his ears are open
[1:24:16] unto their prayers
[1:24:18] but the face of the Lord is against them
[1:24:21] that do evil
[1:24:22] amen and our last person will close
[1:24:26] Matthew 22.
[1:24:31] verses 37-39
[1:24:37] say Amen when you get there
[1:24:41] is that it this one person
[1:24:44] [Laughter]
[1:24:48] Jesus said unto them thou shall love the
[1:24:51] Lord thy God with all thy heart and with
[1:24:53] all thy soul and with all thy mind this
[1:24:56] is the first and great commandment so
[1:24:58] knows that's why we're talking about in
[1:24:59] the first service the Oneness
[1:25:01] we got to make sure that we're loving
[1:25:03] God with everything that we have and the
[1:25:06] thing only we could truly love God
[1:25:07] obviously we could play that part and we
[1:25:10] play that part he can fill you with his
[1:25:11] love so you can reciprocate that love
[1:25:13] back to him
[1:25:15] precipitate that perfect love back to
[1:25:16] him because we can only love so much but
[1:25:18] when God gives us that love we can love
[1:25:20] Limitless because it's his love dwelling
[1:25:23] inside of us
[1:25:25] verse 39 and the second is like unto it
[1:25:27] thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself
[1:25:29] so if you're truly loving God with all
[1:25:31] your heart with all thy soul and all thy
[1:25:33] mind then you can truly love your
[1:25:35] neighbor
[1:25:36] it's just because you can't say you hate
[1:25:38] your brother and have love of God and
[1:25:40] you the scripture tells it's impossible
[1:25:42] so if you're truly loving God truly
[1:25:44] seeking God with all your heart then
[1:25:46] that love is going to be in you so
[1:25:47] richly that you can't stand to even
[1:25:50] think one thought negatively about your
[1:25:52] brother about your neighbor out there
[1:25:55] on these two Commandments saying all the
[1:25:58] law and the prophets
[1:26:00] think about that on these two
[1:26:02] Commandments saying all the law and the
[1:26:03] problem we're following these two
[1:26:04] Commandments right there then all the
[1:26:06] other Commandments are going to fall in
[1:26:08] line see Jesus didn't have this name all
[1:26:09] every single commandment because if
[1:26:11] you're following these two Commandments
[1:26:13] is going to be organic because he says
[1:26:15] I'll write the laws upon your heart
[1:26:17] even says in Ezekiel I want to give you
[1:26:19] a new spirit a new heart then he says I
[1:26:22] put my spirit in you he's going to write
[1:26:24] the I love that just write those
[1:26:25] Commandments you're going to be
[1:26:26] following line
[1:26:28] with God
[1:26:29] and so he's had to recognize how
[1:26:31] important it is for a body to function
[1:26:33] together
[1:26:35] we have to come together set aside any
[1:26:38] differences or dislikes and just come
[1:26:42] together because we come together and
[1:26:44] pray for one another that prophecy can
[1:26:46] be fulfilled in our church and I believe
[1:26:48] it will be fulfilled this year I believe
[1:26:50] it but we got to just humble ourselves
[1:26:52] and come together everyone I have to
[1:26:54] humble myself everybody
[1:26:55] we got to just come together we'll get
[1:26:58] to stand and disinvite sister Sherlock
[1:27:13] and we'll just uh we'll just sing when
[1:27:15] sister show gets there just Turn Your
[1:27:16] Eyes Upon Jesus
[1:27:19] we keep our eyes on him
[1:27:21] and we'll be successful have a
[1:27:23] successful spiritual walk have a healthy
[1:27:26] spiritual walk
[1:27:34] [Music]
[1:27:37] Turn Your Eyes Upon
[1:27:43] Jesus
[1:27:44] look full in his wonderful thing
[1:27:51] is
[1:27:52] and the things of Earth will go
[1:27:57] strangely down in the light
[1:28:02] alive is glory and grace
[1:28:09] turn your eyes
[1:28:11] Upon
[1:28:13] Jesus
[1:28:15] look full in his wonderful faith
[1:28:22] [Music]
[1:28:24] anything's over we'll go strangely dim
[1:28:30] [Music]
[1:28:35] and Jesus continues to play that soft
[1:28:37] listens by our heads
[1:28:40] oh Heavenly Father we just thank you
[1:28:43] Lord for you being here tonight Lord
[1:28:46] just thank you Lord for your word just

[1:30:20] persons of love when we when we love
