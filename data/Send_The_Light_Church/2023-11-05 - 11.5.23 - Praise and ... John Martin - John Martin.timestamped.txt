[39:07] into your image you are the one that
[39:09] makes us to love like you love you are
[39:11] the one that makes us to give like you
[39:14] give Lord and we're in debt to you today
[39:17] and as we stand here before you in your
[39:19] house Lord we want to thank you for the
[39:21] opportunity to worship you to come into
[39:24] your gates with Thanksgiving to come
[39:26] into your courts with praise to
[39:29] recognize Lord that you are our
[39:32] creator we humble ourselves before you
[39:36] today pray Lord that your presence would
[39:39] come in the furtherance in the ministry
[39:40] of the word Lord that we could feed upon
[39:45] the bread of life which only you can
[39:47] feed us Lord only you can break yourself
[39:50] to us only you can make yourself known
[39:52] to
[39:53] us and we pray that you'd come in a
[39:55] supernatural away and Grant to each of
[39:58] our hearts what we have need of Lord as
[40:01] we wait furtherance on thee we give you
[40:03] glory and praise in Jesus Christ's
[40:05] precious name amen amen amen you may be
[40:12] seated well the Bible says out of the
[40:15] mouth of babes and
[40:18] sucklings that thou has perfected praise
[40:25] amen
[40:28] Amen to come into God's presence
[40:31] requires a
[40:33] sacrifice we just can't come in any old
[40:38] way the scripture says know ye the Lord
[40:40] he is God it is he that made us and not
[40:44] we
[40:45] ourselves we are his people and the
[40:47] Sheep of his pasture just that thought
[40:50] alone that he made us and we're coming
[40:53] now into his
[40:55] presence
[40:57] makes
[40:58] us to offer him an offering of humility
[41:03] that we're not worthy to be in his
[41:05] presence and to praise him for the gift
[41:08] of life that he has given us even this
[41:10] day he's given us breath and he's given
[41:14] us health and strength and uh we're
[41:17] living in a n as bad as this country is
[41:20] we still have freedom to worship God
[41:22] from the dictates of our heart and while
[41:25] the doors are still open we should come
[41:27] into these doors with Thanksgiving amen
[41:30] we should come in with a a a praise on
[41:32] our
[41:33] lips because he's told us to enter into
[41:37] his gates with Thanksgiving now Many
[41:39] religious people worship God in
[41:42] vain I say that many when you look at
[41:45] this
[41:46] world even in Jesus's day he said in
[41:50] vain do they worship me so there's a way
[41:53] to worship God that it just does it's
[41:55] it's for
[41:57] not it's in vain he said with their lips
[42:00] they do worship me but their heart is
[42:04] far far from me we heard Brother Bruce
[42:07] say that
[42:08] today in other words in the sight of God
[42:11] words are
[42:13] cheap if love is not the
[42:16] motivation of the worship
[42:19] amen Jesus said some people don't even
[42:22] know what they're
[42:25] worshiping
[42:26] in other words there's something lacking
[42:28] in their
[42:31] relationship so we know that God is the
[42:34] spirit and if we're going to worship God
[42:36] we got to get into the
[42:38] spirit wouldn't it be nice if you could
[42:40] just come in that door and you're
[42:42] automatically in that Spirit now your
[42:45] body may
[42:46] be your body may
[42:48] be because he's honored
[42:51] here but we've got to our spiritual
[42:54] man's got to get into the spirit
[42:57] because we don't worship from our body
[42:59] we worship from the
[43:00] inside and so we got to get into the
[43:03] spirit
[43:04] now maybe
[43:07] some they haven't committed to walking
[43:10] in the truth that they
[43:11] know when you do not commit to walking
[43:14] in the truth that God gives you you
[43:16] cannot worship God in spirit and in
[43:19] truth are you with me he said the true
[43:23] worshippers shall worship the father in
[43:25] spirit and in truth for the father is
[43:28] seeking such to worship him he's
[43:32] literally here looking for someone that
[43:34] will worship him the way he wants to be
[43:37] worshiped God is a spirit and they that
[43:41] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[43:45] and in truth you can't leave out one of
[43:49] them try leaving out something when
[43:52] you're baking a
[43:54] cake you're making cookies how many
[43:57] times you made cookies you forgot to put
[43:59] an ingredients in you went to taste it
[44:00] you thought oh whoa something's wrong
[44:02] with this something's wrong with worship
[44:05] if all you're going to do is just try to
[44:08] get in the spirit but you refuse to walk
[44:10] in the obedience to his
[44:16] word every believer ought to come into
[44:19] church with the offering of
[44:23] Praise we don't want to come to church
[44:26] without this offering because it's a
[44:27] requirement that God has for us now to
[44:30] the unbeliever worship is an option are
[44:34] you with me it's an option but to the
[44:36] True Believer it's not an option it's a
[44:41] requirement but I'll say it like this
[44:43] it's not only a commandment of God it's
[44:44] a
[44:45] privilege it is a privilege to worship
[44:48] God it's such a privilege God promised
[44:52] to actually inhabit our Praises so why
[44:54] wouldn't we want to praise Him amen
[44:57] so if we just Praise Him from our lips
[44:58] he's just going to inhabit our
[45:01] lips but if we we praise him from the
[45:04] deep part of us even though it's hard
[45:06] because you know what we're so
[45:08] programmed to only do what we feel to do
[45:11] I like that song I'm going to sing to
[45:14] it oh he's worthy to be praised on your
[45:18] worst day the worst thing that's ever
[45:20] happened to you in the world God is
[45:22] worthy to be praised on that day he's
[45:25] still God no matter what we go
[45:28] through and he will always remain
[45:32] God Psalms 15 verse one says praise ye
[45:35] the Lord praise God in his
[45:41] sanctuary in his Sanctuary this is not
[45:46] ours this is not mine This Is Not Yours
[45:50] this belongs to
[45:51] him and he's saying for us to praise him
[45:56] now how much do I praise him how do I
[45:59] praise
[46:00] him well
[46:02] look don't you wish that you could get
[46:05] more money when you went to the
[46:08] bank don't you wish your paycheck was a
[46:10] little bit more your retirement was a
[46:13] little bit
[46:15] more when that last cookie is gone don't
[46:18] you wish there was another
[46:20] one I'll just say it like this give God
[46:23] a greater effort give him a great effort
[46:27] and not just a little and
[46:29] say I did my part give them more make it
[46:34] a sacrifice whoa I really gave a lot I
[46:37] really pushed it up I really gave more
[46:39] than I thought I was ever going to give
[46:41] that's what he's looking for amen verse
[46:43] six let everything that have breath
[46:47] praise the
[46:48] Lord children do you have
[46:52] breath praise the Lord do not wait for
[46:55] mom and dad to say praise the
[46:57] Lord praise the Lord without Mom and
[47:01] Dad praise the Lord without your husband
[47:03] there without your wife there praise God
[47:05] because inside of you you want to praise
[47:07] him that's what he's looking for today
[47:11] now the True Believers has prepared his
[47:13] heart to praise God in his Sanctuary
[47:15] because he's
[47:17] worthy Psalms 116 verse number 17 we're
[47:20] going to read three verses there God
[47:22] requires this Sacrifice from all his
[47:24] people I will offer to thee the
[47:26] sacrifice of
[47:28] Thanksgiving the sacrifice in other
[47:30] words you have to bring a sacrifice
[47:33] before the Lord and will call upon the
[47:36] name of the Lord I will pay my vows yes
[47:39] you owe vows unto the Lord I will pay my
[47:42] vows unto the Lord now in the presence
[47:45] of all his people I guess it's not that
[47:47] private is
[47:49] it he's requiring it to be done in the
[47:52] presence of those that are around
[47:54] you because because God is just not the
[47:57] god to you he's a God to all of us we
[48:00] are his children we are his people we
[48:02] are the Sheep of his pasture and we need
[48:04] to all of us all pay our vows before the
[48:07] Lord in the courts of the Lord's House
[48:10] in the midst of the old Jerusalem praise
[48:12] ye the Lord I say it's time for us to
[48:16] pay
[48:17] up we need to be prayed up to pay up
[48:21] give him what he's worthy Psalms 106
[48:24] ver1 praise ye the Lord oh give thanks
[48:26] unto the Lord for his good for his mercy
[48:28] endureth forever who can utter the
[48:32] mighty acts of the Lord who can show
[48:34] forth all his praise all right who
[48:39] can good
[48:42] question verse
[48:44] 48 blessed be the Lord God of Israel
[48:47] from Everlasting to Everlasting and let
[48:50] all the people say amen praise ye the
[48:54] Lord amen
[48:56] now if I'm going to stand before the
[48:59] Lord and I had
[49:03] $1,000 and God told me to give that ,000
[49:06] to
[49:10] missions and I gave it I know that he
[49:14] would be pleased with that don't
[49:17] you now if God said I want you to give
[49:22] $10 million to missions but I never had
[49:25] $10 million I don't think God would ever
[49:28] ask me to give $10
[49:31] million I do not want to stand before
[49:33] the Lord when he has asked me to praise
[49:36] him and I refuse to do it you understand
[49:40] what I'm
[49:41] saying if it's in your hands if it's in
[49:44] your heart if it's in your mind praise
[49:47] him it's not an option if you're a True
[49:49] Believer and I'll tell you if you're
[49:51] predestinated to be in His image there's
[49:53] something inside of you that just when
[49:55] the the word comes I'm going to praise
[49:59] him because it's a relationship that you
[50:01] are having with God Psalms 113:1 says
[50:05] praise ye the Lord Praise oh ye Servants
[50:08] of the Lord praise the name of the
[50:11] Lord blessed be the name of the Lord
[50:14] from this time forth forever and more so
[50:17] let's just say hey I I haven't been
[50:19] praising God the way I should be well
[50:22] this time from this moment ever for from
[50:25] this time forth and forever more let's
[50:27] bless the name of the Lord from the
[50:30] rising of the sun and the going down of
[50:32] the same the lord's name is to be
[50:34] praised the Lord is high above all the
[50:37] nations and His glory above above the
[50:40] heavens who is like unto the Lord Our
[50:44] God who is like unto the Lord well you
[50:47] put a football game on and you'll see a
[50:49] lot of Praises going
[50:53] on and they're able to to praise their
[50:56] God what about us who know the real God
[51:00] what about us we ought to light this
[51:02] place up more than any
[51:04] Auditorium any ball field
[51:07] amen the Lord is worthy to be praised
[51:10] but who is like unto the Lord Our God no
[51:13] one but the Lord answers the question in
[51:15] Isaiah 45 verse5 Isaiah 45:5 he says I
[51:20] am the lord and there is none else and
[51:23] there is no God beside me
[51:26] I GED thee though thou has not known me
[51:31] isn't that wonderful just like we take
[51:33] care of our our children when they were
[51:35] real young they didn't even know who we
[51:37] were but we took care of them right
[51:40] verse six that they may know from the
[51:42] rising of the Sun and from the
[51:46] West that there is none beside me I am
[51:49] the lord and there is none else I think
[51:53] when we come into his house we ought to
[51:56] let him know there's none like you Lord
[51:59] I Want To Praise You like there's none
[52:00] like
[52:02] you now think about this I know you're
[52:05] you're not going to go to a football
[52:06] game today and you know rip your shirt
[52:08] off and paint your body and say go go go
[52:11] I understand that but you're here in
[52:14] church why won't you give your your best
[52:17] to God because God no give your
[52:21] best but I know that's the heart
[52:26] you understand what I'm saying they're
[52:27] giving their best to their God why not
[52:29] us give our best to our god you
[52:32] understand what I'm saying here Isaiah
[52:34] 45 Verse
[52:37] 18 when we turn our focus on God it you
[52:40] know worship and praise just becomes
[52:43] organic for thus sayith the Lord that
[52:46] created the heavens and God that formed
[52:49] the Earth and made it he that
[52:52] established it he created it not in vain
[52:55] he he formed it to be inhabited I am the
[52:58] lord and there is none
[53:01] else I just love the scriptures now look
[53:04] hey I'm not going to give you any
[53:06] emotion but this word ought it ought
[53:08] make you
[53:09] emotional this word ought to make you
[53:12] emotional Isaiah 45: 211 who have
[53:16] declared this from ancient times and who
[53:19] have told it from that time have not I
[53:21] the lord and there is none else there's
[53:24] no I'm sorry there is no God else beside
[53:28] me a just
[53:30] God a savior there is none beside me
[53:36] amen I'm so glad that God made his self
[53:39] known to us unto me look unto me he said
[53:44] and be ye saved all the ends of the
[53:45] Earth for I am God and there is none
[53:49] else David in his prayer in 1st
[53:52] Chronicles chapter 17 he says oh Lord
[53:54] there is none like thee neither is there
[53:56] any God beside thee according to all
[53:58] that we have heard with our
[54:02] ears Psalms 868 I know I'm going through
[54:04] a number of scriptures here Psalms 868
[54:07] among the God there is none like unto
[54:10] thee Oh Lord neither there are any works
[54:12] like unto thy works so there's so many
[54:15] scriptures describing how great God
[54:18] really is it ought to make it so easy
[54:21] for us to come into church and worship
[54:23] God from the dictates of our heart
[54:26] he is God he is he is the Lord of lords
[54:29] he is the king of kings he is our savior
[54:31] he's our healer he's our provider he's
[54:34] Jehovah Gyra he is he is everything to
[54:37] us and it's something when we have that
[54:39] in our hearts we don't need to be pumped
[54:41] up it just wants to it just wants to
[54:43] come out now I'm going to tell you why
[54:45] it's so hard for us to come into church
[54:47] that way is because we don't come with
[54:49] that mindset when we come into church we
[54:52] think it's the church's job to get us to
[54:54] to remember
[54:56] that well hey it's it's the preacher's
[54:59] job to tell you what you need to remind
[55:01] yourself of that the other six days of
[55:03] the week amen spend some time with Jesus
[55:06] spend some time reading the word spend
[55:08] some time count your blessings name them
[55:10] one by one put your mind set your mind
[55:13] on the things of God that he is God
[55:15] there's none like him he he gave you
[55:18] breath today he let the sun come up
[55:20] today he gave us a place to worship
[55:22] today he gave us brothers and sisters of
[55:24] light precious Faith he has filled our
[55:26] heart with love he is God there's there
[55:29] are so many things to praise God for
[55:32] amen I just say we ought to praise God
[55:36] more we ought to testify the things of
[55:38] God more amen we ought to EXA exalt the
[55:41] name of the
[55:42] Lord Psalms
[55:45] 34:3 says oh magnify the Lord with me
[55:48] and let us exalt his name together was
[55:53] that our opening verse to exalt the
[55:57] Lord so here we've come together oh
[55:59] magnify the Lord with me and let us
[56:02] exalt his name together that means if
[56:05] one person is exalting the Lord the
[56:08] other one supposed to be doing it too
[56:11] amen this isn't just for those who are
[56:14] trying to be you know spiritual during
[56:17] service you know all the thoughts we get
[56:19] from the devil right well I don't want
[56:21] to stick out like a sore thumb and you
[56:24] know and I you I didn't do it yesterday
[56:26] and you know you just lay every thought
[56:28] aside and praise God because he's worthy
[56:31] forget about what's happened forget
[56:33] about where you're at forget everything
[56:35] and exalt him enter into his
[56:39] Gates you know sometimes we we think
[56:43] that we worship God through the
[56:47] songs and then we're all done with
[56:51] worship we forget to worship the word
[56:54] amen
[56:56] because he is the
[56:58] word we need to have that worship going
[57:02] throughout the service are you with
[57:05] me now we need to exalt the name of
[57:08] Jesus I believe we ought to use the name
[57:11] of Jesus more don't you the Bible says
[57:13] his name is a high
[57:16] tower in his name demons are cast out
[57:20] all kinds of
[57:22] demons demons of sickness
[57:25] Demons of
[57:27] depression
[57:31] anxiety demons that want to Puff us
[57:34] up Demons of arrogancy
[57:37] haughtiness
[57:40] selfishness demons that want to esteem
[57:44] ourself right didn't
[57:46] didn't Jesus tells Satan thou Savor the
[57:50] things that uh uh appeal to man
[57:56] demons that lift us up demons that want
[57:58] to give us a
[58:01] reputation come on I want to hear some
[58:03] amens because there the I'm talking
[58:04] about
[58:06] demons see the difference is is these
[58:08] demons are attacking
[58:11] us demons that cause anger
[58:14] frustration confusion Strife
[58:17] fighting the Demons of this world Demons
[58:21] of pleasure all sorts of demons
[58:26] did you know
[58:28] demons can get on you when you talk to
[58:30] other
[58:33] people did you know brothers and sisters
[58:36] can have demons on them oh we just
[58:37] talked about all these and we're
[58:44] guilty
[58:46] there's demons that are
[58:52] religious but they just got a form
[58:54] there's no no godly power there it's why
[58:58] the Bible says don't entertain that turn
[59:01] away get away because you think you're
[59:04] strong enough but I'll tell you what
[59:06] Spirits can get on you and you don't
[59:07] even realize
[59:08] it so we need to use the name of the
[59:11] Lord more to cast the demons out of our
[59:16] life are you with me
[59:19] amen say in the name of Jesus Christ get
[59:22] out of
[59:23] me get out of my mind get out of my
[59:28] thoughts he tempts
[59:31] us and oh yeah that oh that sounds cool
[59:34] yeah I would just a
[59:38] demon trying to rob Glory from
[59:43] God look we had a perfect example Jesus
[59:46] made himself of no
[59:49] reputation why would we want
[59:52] to he's our example we follow his steps
[59:55] now everybody's got a reputation here by
[59:57] the way all you need to do is look at
[1:00:00] anybody
[1:00:01] here and you know they got a
[1:00:09] reputation but don't make it don't make
[1:00:14] one don't make one let your life let
[1:00:18] your life speak you understand what I'm
[1:00:21] saying let God build the reputation if
[1:00:23] he wants to build it but the thing is
[1:00:26] God wants to be glorified through your
[1:00:28] body he wants to be glorified through
[1:00:30] your mind through your thoughts through
[1:00:32] your words through your actions when
[1:00:34] people look at
[1:00:37] you God wants them to see
[1:00:41] him we need to remember
[1:00:45] that we need to recognize our own
[1:00:49] demons be courageous about getting them
[1:00:52] out you know sometimes we are so
[1:00:54] bothered by somebody else's
[1:00:57] mistakes and boy we just
[1:00:59] wish they really know how to push your
[1:01:03] button but you know we don't even care
[1:01:05] if our own button we is
[1:01:07] pushed we don't care if we push our own
[1:01:09] button we don't care how upset we get
[1:01:12] how angry we get we don't really doesn't
[1:01:14] bother we're just we're going to show
[1:01:15] we're

[1:01:19] stand for Jesus use the name of Jesus
[1:01:23] say Satan get get out of get out of me
[1:01:25] get out of my mind this is not your will
[1:01:29] your will is for me to to walk in
[1:01:32] humility to esteem my my brother my
[1:01:35] sister my wife my husband my child amen
[1:01:39] better than
[1:01:41] me lift God
[1:01:43] up the name of the Lord is a mighty
[1:01:48] weapon we need to exercise it more in
[1:01:51] our lives it's an honor to actually
[1:01:53] speak the name name of the Lord Jesus
[1:01:55] amen to have those words come out notice
[1:01:58] how the devil anoints the world world to
[1:02:01] take that same name Jesus in a evil
[1:02:06] way just they curse with it and then
[1:02:10] when they're trying to be halfway good
[1:02:13] you know they say it you know you know
[1:02:15] kind of like so it's not so obvious but
[1:02:18] from the heart it's the same intent you
[1:02:21] know what I'm trying to say to
[1:02:23] you the same name in other words they're
[1:02:28] using the name to condemn somebody they
[1:02:31] they become judge right come on I you
[1:02:34] know what I'm saying I don't have to say
[1:02:36] the words you've all heard them but to
[1:02:38] us we come into God's house we lift up
[1:02:41] the name of the Lord amen we praise the
[1:02:44] name of the Lord Jesus Acts 4:12 if you
[1:02:47] want to write this down Acts 4:12 I
[1:02:50] forgot to tell you but I'm glad that you
[1:02:53] got an extra hour of sleep today because
[1:02:55] you know we got a lot of stuff on the
[1:02:56] plate today there's a lot at the table
[1:02:59] today the Bible says neither is their
[1:03:02] salvation in any other for there is none
[1:03:05] other name under Heaven that would be
[1:03:08] here on Earth given among men whereby we
[1:03:13] must be saved amen I believe we have to
[1:03:19] be saved in the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:21] Christ there is no other name
[1:03:26] look at Ephesians chapter 3:14 for this
[1:03:29] cause I bow my knees unto the father of
[1:03:33] the Lord Jesus Christ of our Lord Jesus
[1:03:34] Christ of whom the whole
[1:03:38] family the whole family in Heaven and
[1:03:42] Earth is
[1:03:44] named we are all
[1:03:48] Jesus we're all the family of
[1:03:51] Jesus I don't think there's no one big
[1:03:54] Bigg ger and better than
[1:03:57] anyone we're all the
[1:04:00] family Philippians chapter 2:9 wherefore
[1:04:04] God also hath highly exalted him and
[1:04:07] given him a name which is above every
[1:04:09] name that at the name of Jesus every
[1:04:13] knee should bow of things in heaven
[1:04:15] things in Earth and things under the
[1:04:17] Earth and that every tongue should
[1:04:19] confess it that Jesus Christ is Lord to
[1:04:24] the glory of God the father now I'm
[1:04:26] going to say this to the unbeliever that
[1:04:30] is
[1:04:31] optional you don't have to do that you
[1:04:33] don't have to come to the altar bow
[1:04:35] before
[1:04:37] him but one day when this life is all
[1:04:41] over every human being that was ever
[1:04:44] born is going to Bow before the Lord if
[1:04:47] they hadn't bowed
[1:04:49] yet I just wonder brother Johnson if the
[1:04:52] bride's going to be sitting on the
[1:04:54] throne at that time next to the groom
[1:04:57] when they do it I don't know but I'll
[1:04:59] say it like this it will happen because
[1:05:01] the word says it's going to
[1:05:03] happen I'm I'm just glad that I have
[1:05:06] such a desire every morning and I get up
[1:05:09] boom hit the floor and thank
[1:05:12] God because he's the Lord of lords the
[1:05:15] King of Kings he's worthy to be praised
[1:05:19] every single day he gives you a new day
[1:05:21] he don't owe you he don't owe you
[1:05:23] anything that's right he don't owe you
[1:05:26] health he don't owe you a sound
[1:05:28] mind he doesn't owe you
[1:05:34] anything but we owe him
[1:05:38] everything he
[1:05:40] doesn't have to give me another day to
[1:05:42] live but if he does I want to show that
[1:05:46] appreciation I want to thank him for
[1:05:48] that day if he puts Bread on my table
[1:05:50] I'm going to thank him for that bread if
[1:05:53] he provides a Bill to be paid I'm going
[1:05:56] to praise him for that because he don't
[1:05:59] owe it to
[1:06:00] me I owe God
[1:06:04] everything now God has given us his name
[1:06:07] and we need to use it more in our lives
[1:06:11] it's a very powerful name honestly if
[1:06:13] you pray in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:06:15] need to expect your prayers to be
[1:06:18] heard they're
[1:06:20] Mighty do you know I run to that name
[1:06:23] every morning
[1:06:25] every morning I run into the name of
[1:06:27] Jesus I call on that name every day I
[1:06:31] sing in that name every day I pray in
[1:06:34] that name every day that name is above
[1:06:37] every other name that I
[1:06:40] speak the Bible says and whatsoever you
[1:06:43] do in word or deed do all in the name of
[1:06:45] the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God and
[1:06:48] the father by
[1:06:49] him we've often heard around Christmas
[1:06:52] time his name shall be called called
[1:06:54] wonderful and counselor and mighty God
[1:06:56] the Everlasting father the Prince of
[1:06:57] Peace his name is
[1:07:00] wonderful
[1:07:04] wonderful as great as the name of Jesus
[1:07:07] is did you know there's something above
[1:07:10] his
[1:07:14] name think about that that God actually
[1:07:18] has something above the name that you
[1:07:21] use to cast demons out
[1:07:25] to pray for your
[1:07:26] food that we worship when we come to
[1:07:29] church the songs that we sing about
[1:07:32] Jesus there's something above that
[1:07:36] name turn with me if you would to Psalms
[1:07:39] 138 verse one Psalms 138 verse
[1:07:43] one I want entitled this message
[1:07:48] praise and dot dot dot because I wanted
[1:07:51] you to fill in the blank want you to
[1:07:54] fill in the
[1:07:56] blank Psalms 138:1 says I will praise
[1:08:00] thee with my whole heart before the gods
[1:08:04] will I Sing Praises unto thee I will
[1:08:09] worship toward thy Holy Temple and
[1:08:12] praise thy name for thy loving
[1:08:14] kindness and for thy Truth for thou has
[1:08:19] magnified Thy word above all thy name
[1:08:26] name I want us to consider just how much
[1:08:30] God manies all his
[1:08:34] words of this beautiful book called The
[1:08:39] Bible that every word in
[1:08:42] here he magnifies it higher than his
[1:08:49] name you know we're we're very good to
[1:08:53] use that name of Jesus when we want
[1:08:57] to God wants us to become as interested
[1:09:01] in following this word as he wants us to
[1:09:05] you understand what I'm
[1:09:07] saying we need to exalt the word of God
[1:09:11] like he does we need to magnify the word
[1:09:14] of the
[1:09:15] Lord if God has magnified his word above
[1:09:20] his own name how much more ought we to
[1:09:23] ify his word above our own
[1:09:27] lives come
[1:09:30] on we've heard of prayer being more
[1:09:33] important than necessary
[1:09:36] sleep this word obedience to this word
[1:09:39] is more important than anything that
[1:09:40] you're going through in your
[1:09:44] life the word of the of the Lord is his
[1:09:49] will it's his will it's the only book
[1:09:52] that we know without a shadow of of a
[1:09:54] doubt it's his
[1:09:58] will if I told you God spoke to me and
[1:10:01] he told me to go buy a brand new pair of
[1:10:03] shoes and give it to so and so down the
[1:10:05] street we would know there could be
[1:10:07] question there could be doubt about
[1:10:10] that even though he might have spoke
[1:10:13] it but this
[1:10:16] word there's no doubt about
[1:10:19] it there's no question about it and this
[1:10:22] word no matter how much we think it's
[1:10:25] not that big a deal cuz I've been
[1:10:26] baptized it needs to be exalted in our
[1:10:29] life we need to lift it up more we need
[1:10:31] to get into it we need to say God what
[1:10:34] would you have me to
[1:10:38] do the word of God is his will and his
[1:10:42] will is exalted above his name amen
[1:10:46] according to Ephesians 1:11 the Bible
[1:10:48] says that God works out all things after
[1:10:51] the counsel of his own will think about
[1:10:53] that he's working out everything to the
[1:10:55] counsel of his own will
[1:10:59] right his will is more important than my
[1:11:02] will in fact he made it pre pretty clean
[1:11:04] to me when I first met him deny your
[1:11:10] will deny
[1:11:13] yourself our will doesn't mean anything
[1:11:17] when it interferes with God's will your
[1:11:20] will means everything when it lines up
[1:11:22] to his will
[1:11:25] see the whole world is full of people
[1:11:27] who want to use God for their benefit
[1:11:33] right but the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:36] knows her
[1:11:38] position she's been called to do his
[1:11:43] will the interest is to do the will of
[1:11:46] God to exalt the word of God in their
[1:11:50] life I just want to be like God I want
[1:11:52] to magnify his word above
[1:11:56] everything I think we need to talk about
[1:11:59] it
[1:12:00] more testify about it more and I think
[1:12:04] we need to to read about his will more
[1:12:07] to share it with our texting a little
[1:12:09] bit
[1:12:12] more I think when we're having to make a
[1:12:14] decision in your life am I going to go
[1:12:16] to church or if I'm going to do this
[1:12:17] personal thing for my life I think you
[1:12:20] need to exalt the word of God Amen come
[1:12:23] on it's the
[1:12:24] word it's easy it's easy it is easy to
[1:12:29] take the book and eat
[1:12:32] it what's hard is to have it
[1:12:37] digested it's easy to say Amen to the
[1:12:40] word but it's another thing to say I'm
[1:12:42] going to live
[1:12:43] that what was meant behind that amen was
[1:12:46] so be it my life because I'm gonna do it
[1:12:48] I'm Gonna Leave Here different than when
[1:12:50] I came amen what has to change a lot is
[1:12:53] our attitude the
[1:12:56] determination to pick up that book and
[1:12:58] read it and say God I'm gonna follow it
[1:13:00] today I'm G to walk in your will
[1:13:04] today Matthew chapter 7 verse 21 now
[1:13:07] we've read the scriptures
[1:13:10] before and uh boy you know time is just
[1:13:15] it's going by fast I'll just tell you
[1:13:16] that but you got extra hour
[1:13:22] sleep
[1:13:26] now we've read this scripture before but
[1:13:28] I want to just come into it from another
[1:13:31] Point here not everyone that saith unto
[1:13:33] me Lord Lord shall enter into the
[1:13:36] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[1:13:40] will of My Father which is in heaven so
[1:13:44] this is the an important reason we need
[1:13:46] to exalt the word to magnify the word in
[1:13:50] our life look here how Jesus exalts his
[1:13:55] word above his own name many shall say
[1:13:59] in to me in that day Lord Lord have we
[1:14:02] not prophesied in thy
[1:14:04] name and in thy name have cast out
[1:14:08] devils and in thy name done many
[1:14:11] wonderful
[1:14:12] works and then will I profess unto them
[1:14:16] I never knew
[1:14:20] you what's the end result dep part from
[1:14:25] me ye that work iniquity so what is
[1:14:29] working iniquity a working iniquity is
[1:14:31] when God has spoken to you out of his
[1:14:34] precious word that he's exalted he
[1:14:36] exalted it so much that when you came to
[1:14:39] church he spoke it to you amen and
[1:14:43] something inside of your heart just oh
[1:14:46] God I think you're speaking to
[1:14:49] me and then you walk out and you say boy
[1:14:53] that was a good
[1:14:56] service and you don't put into action
[1:14:59] what he spoke to
[1:15:01] you that's what it means to work
[1:15:04] iniquity so this is a dangerous place
[1:15:07] Jesus said it'd be better if you had not
[1:15:09] known the way of Truth than to have
[1:15:11] known it and to walk away from
[1:15:14] it the Bible says that judgment first
[1:15:17] begins in the house of the Lord this is
[1:15:19] a place where we subject oursel to our
[1:15:23] our
[1:15:24] bridegroom he's our
[1:15:27] head now I know a lot of people don't
[1:15:29] like
[1:15:30] headship but we have a head and the
[1:15:33] bride has a
[1:15:35] head and it's important the little
[1:15:39] things that he's dealing with us now
[1:15:42] I'll tell you where Satan gets us a lot
[1:15:43] of times is none of us are going to deny
[1:15:47] that we believe the Bible is the
[1:15:50] truth we would never do that but the
[1:15:53] very fact that we would not follow to
[1:15:56] obey a part of it shows something is
[1:15:59] missing in our relationship with God and
[1:16:02] where Satan gets a lot of us is well
[1:16:05] that's just one part and you know
[1:16:07] everybody is human everybody fails
[1:16:11] everybody's not perfect and I agree with
[1:16:14] that praise God for the blood praise God
[1:16:19] that if a righteous man falls seven
[1:16:21] times seven times he'll get back up but
[1:16:23] there's no scripture in that Bible that
[1:16:25] tells me I can have that kind of
[1:16:29] attitude the attitude it wants me to
[1:16:31] have is to press towards that image to
[1:16:35] come into His likeness to spend more
[1:16:37] time on my knees and say God help me
[1:16:39] with my My Flesh that's so weak and that
[1:16:42] keeps making this mistake and doesn't
[1:16:44] doesn't try hard enough help me to to
[1:16:46] fast more to pray more to spend more
[1:16:48] time with you Lord that's what it's
[1:16:51] looking for
[1:16:53] looking for more
[1:16:56] heart looking for more heart do you
[1:16:59] think that was Brother Bruce that was
[1:17:05] saying God wants it coming from the
[1:17:09] heart or was that the spirit of God
[1:17:12] speaking through Brother
[1:17:14] Bruce come on in the light of the
[1:17:16] message you tell me what looked like
[1:17:19] Brother Bruce I know but what was in
[1:17:23] iring him what was behind
[1:17:28] him brother brandham said in the message
[1:17:31] the
[1:17:34] token he said full obedience to the word
[1:17:36] of God brings
[1:17:41] God full obedience to the word brings
[1:17:44] God the word Eternal into you and that
[1:17:48] is the token when the word is in you
[1:17:53] it's Christ in you now too often because
[1:17:57] we feel his presence and we claim that
[1:17:58] he's filled us with the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:00] I've got the Holy Ghost and yeah I
[1:18:02] received it I'm years ago that you know
[1:18:04] we just we just take that scripture and
[1:18:06] we just say goes in one ear and out the
[1:18:11] other but look how could brother Brandon
[1:18:14] made also made this statement he says
[1:18:16] how can you say you have the Holy Ghost
[1:18:18] and deny the word that's being spoken
[1:18:21] and the Holy Ghost wrote the word
[1:18:24] word so doing things in the name of the
[1:18:26] Lord is wonderful it really is but
[1:18:29] obeying his perfect will is what
[1:18:32] counts right that's what counts brother
[1:18:36] brandham said about six months earlier
[1:18:38] in another message called the token he
[1:18:41] said the token is the sign that the
[1:18:43] purchase has been made and been accepted
[1:18:46] now you can't get the token from the
[1:18:47] railroad Fair until you pay the
[1:18:51] price
[1:18:54] you can't get it until you pay the price
[1:18:56] well brother John I thought he freely
[1:18:58] died for me I thought he went to Calvary
[1:19:01] for
[1:19:07] me what Jesus did at
[1:19:10] Calvary didn't make me become
[1:19:16] obedient I literally had to repent of my
[1:19:19] ugly sinful nature and say I'm sorry God
[1:19:25] right I accept your
[1:19:28] sacrifice at Calvary to cover
[1:19:33] me but that didn't mean the Holy Ghost
[1:19:35] came
[1:19:39] inside that's my first step to get my
[1:19:46] life covered by the
[1:19:50] blood I still need to go through a
[1:19:52] process is called
[1:19:54] sanctification that's where the word of
[1:19:56] God you hear the
[1:19:58] word and the word says you need to cut
[1:20:01] your hair because it's too long my hair
[1:20:04] looked like Sister Sister Lor's over
[1:20:06] there at one
[1:20:10] time and so when I cut my
[1:20:14] hair I was becoming obedient to the
[1:20:18] word there was a process of
[1:20:20] sanctification going on you and it
[1:20:23] wasn't up to me Brother Joseph how long
[1:20:26] I had to go through that
[1:20:29] process it's not up to me to say oh I
[1:20:32] went through it long enough and now I've
[1:20:33] got the Holy
[1:20:35] Ghost you know it may take one minute it
[1:20:39] may take 30 years I don't know because
[1:20:42] your heart is different than anybody
[1:20:44] else's in here everybody's heart is
[1:20:51] different I want to continue reading
[1:20:53] this we got to pay the price and the
[1:20:57] only way you're going to pay the price
[1:21:01] is catch
[1:21:03] this pay
[1:21:06] it there's no shortcuts you got to pay
[1:21:09] it he said that's right what then he
[1:21:12] says what does it mean to pay it he says
[1:21:15] believe it and accept
[1:21:18] it so I wonder now how many caral
[1:21:22] believers do we got here in how many
[1:21:23] spiritual Believers what does that
[1:21:25] really mean to believe it and to accept
[1:21:28] it well he defines that in the next
[1:21:31] sentence he says full obedience to the
[1:21:36] whole word of
[1:21:39] God that's what it really means to
[1:21:42] believe and to
[1:21:44] accept is to become obedient to the full
[1:21:47] word of God he says full obedience to
[1:21:49] the word of God will entitle you to the
[1:21:51] token full
[1:21:54] obedience
[1:21:56] not the part of
[1:21:59] it not the part of it as far as your
[1:22:05] denomination
[1:22:07] goes or we might say it like this not
[1:22:11] the part of it as your denominational
[1:22:13] thinking
[1:22:15] goes right because we're not a
[1:22:16] denomination
[1:22:18] here but all of it full obedience to the
[1:22:21] word which is Christ brings you into
[1:22:24] Christ think about that full obedience
[1:22:26] to the word is what brings you into
[1:22:28] Christ I thought it's separate I thought
[1:22:30] I got my relationship with this and the
[1:22:32] word is different I thought church is
[1:22:34] different the word is different and
[1:22:36] Christ is in my heart no we don't
[1:22:38] serve a
[1:22:41] trinity the Holy Ghost the word of God
[1:22:45] and the one who died for you at Calvary
[1:22:47] is all
[1:22:48] one is all one you can't separate them
[1:22:55] full obedience to the
[1:22:57] word let's continue on Matthew chapter 7
[1:23:00] back there where we were in Matthew 7
[1:23:02] therefore whosoever heareth these says
[1:23:04] of mine that's this book and doeth
[1:23:08] them God is going to liken you unto a
[1:23:12] wise
[1:23:13] man which built his house upon a
[1:23:18] rock and The Rock descended I'm sorry
[1:23:21] and the rain descended and the floods
[1:23:23] came and the winds blew and beat upon
[1:23:25] that house and it fell not for it was
[1:23:29] founded upon a rock now I'll tell you
[1:23:32] that's the life I want right there that
[1:23:34] is the life I want I want a life that
[1:23:37] cannot be
[1:23:38] moved well I can't get that with my own
[1:23:42] thinking my own
[1:23:44] smarts my own ability my own money I'm
[1:23:48] sorry it can only be done when you stand
[1:23:50] on the word of God you you let your life
[1:23:53] be with this word is full obedience to
[1:23:55] the word of
[1:23:57] God you know we we need to take a good
[1:23:59] look at our
[1:24:01] lives I know where you're standing on
[1:24:04] ain't what you
[1:24:05] say what you obey it ain't what you say
[1:24:09] it's what you
[1:24:11] obey and everyone that heareth the
[1:24:14] Saints of mine these Saints of mine and
[1:24:16] doeth them
[1:24:17] not shall be likened unto a foolish man
[1:24:22] right which built his house upon the
[1:24:27] sand and the rains descend the floods
[1:24:30] came the winds blew and beat upon the
[1:24:31] house and it fell oh and great was the
[1:24:36] fall of
[1:24:38] it I'll tell you Rapture hasn't taken
[1:24:41] place yet how do we know this how do we
[1:24:45] know this brother
[1:24:46] Dennis because we're still
[1:24:49] here that's how we know
[1:24:52] but I tell you I want that ticket in my
[1:24:54] hand when it does
[1:24:57] happen I know if the ticket I know if
[1:25:01] the Rapture happens tomorrow I do not
[1:25:04] have the day after tomorrow to get ready
[1:25:07] are you with me teach us to number our
[1:25:10] days Lord we're running out of time and
[1:25:13] we need to get serious with this word
[1:25:16] this we need to fall in love with this
[1:25:17] word it's not about just having some
[1:25:20] sort of Association or how we
[1:25:22] are viewed by other people look you may
[1:25:26] be the only one going in a
[1:25:28] Rapture why would you want to compare
[1:25:30] yourself with
[1:25:32] somebody compare yourself with the word
[1:25:34] that's the only thing that can get you
[1:25:36] there I cannot get you there I cannot
[1:25:39] get you
[1:25:41] there but I do believe with the prophet
[1:25:45] that that office will lead you there
[1:25:48] it's ordained to God loves you more than
[1:25:51] I love you
[1:25:53] and you know I love
[1:25:55] [Laughter]
[1:25:57] you God's going to see you
[1:26:00] through God's going to see you through
[1:26:03] but we have to take the word we got to
[1:26:05] leave here and start putting into
[1:26:07] practice and not be thinking I'm doing
[1:26:10] it
[1:26:11] enough we got to cast that demon out if
[1:26:15] we were doing enough we'd be out of here
[1:26:18] in fact the prophet said when when you
[1:26:20] you're as close as you can get to him
[1:26:22] he'll take you you're still
[1:26:25] here we have a work to do too right all
[1:26:29] right brother Bram said then the church
[1:26:30] age I have to skip a lot of stuff the
[1:26:32] normal procedure where you study for
[1:26:34] hours and hours and then you skip it I
[1:26:36] don't understand that brother B said in
[1:26:39] the message the Le seean Church age he
[1:26:41] says he stands outside is a good example
[1:26:45] he stands outside calling to his
[1:26:49] own who follow him
[1:26:53] by obedience to the
[1:26:56] word that's how we follow him we can't
[1:26:59] follow him by joining the
[1:27:01] church by paying
[1:27:03] tithes we follow him by obeying the word
[1:27:08] so we come here Lord I want to follow
[1:27:10] you some more I want to follow you
[1:27:11] closer I want to draw nigh to you speak
[1:27:14] to my heart tell me what you want me to
[1:27:15] do and then when he speaks it to you and
[1:27:18] you do it then you're following him
[1:27:22] otherwise you're just following a
[1:27:25] denominational view oh yeah God's in my
[1:27:29] heart no matter
[1:27:31] what yeah I've got the baptism I don't
[1:27:34] care what anybody says I know I got
[1:27:36] it what if the word is telling you
[1:27:39] you're you're missing
[1:27:43] something see you're disagreeing with
[1:27:46] God I'm so glad we have the word and I'm
[1:27:49] so glad that God sent a prophet to tell
[1:27:52] what that word
[1:27:54] meant right he's a Seer not only he sees
[1:27:59] but he's he rightly divides the word for
[1:28:02] us I don't want to choke anybody but I'm
[1:28:06] glad that God had a prophet in the
[1:28:09] Ephesian Church age who wrote 14 books
[1:28:12] of this Bible that every other Church
[1:28:15] age messenger had to
[1:28:18] read and and everybody else did we need
[1:28:22] to preach the same message that Paul
[1:28:25] preached we need to believe the same
[1:28:27] word that Paul preached to us no
[1:28:30] different I tell you this message is not
[1:28:33] a different message it's the same
[1:28:35] message he's the same yesterday today
[1:28:37] and
[1:28:42] forever our ultimate focus in life ought
[1:28:45] to be doing more of the will of God in
[1:28:47] every day not just our our job or
[1:28:52] the house or where he wants us to live
[1:28:55] I'm talking about the important things
[1:28:57] in life what are the important things
[1:28:59] I'm talking about what you think about
[1:29:01] every day what you talk about every day
[1:29:04] trying to go through the day and not put
[1:29:07] God in it is
[1:29:09] wrong and then calling I'm going to pray
[1:29:11] about where I'm going to live is
[1:29:12] something important when you want to
[1:29:15] kick them out of your everyday life come
[1:29:18] on I feel like preaching today I think
[1:29:21] we need to be checking our motives
[1:29:23] checking our
[1:29:26] objectives you know there's times that
[1:29:29] we have a motive to do
[1:29:31] good but we don't we fail to realize
[1:29:34] that we got other motives mixed maybe I
[1:29:36] want to you know you're going to do
[1:29:38] something for the Lord right it's a good
[1:29:40] motive it really
[1:29:42] is but then you you kind of want
[1:29:45] something out of
[1:29:46] it it becomes a mixed
[1:29:50] motive
[1:29:52] I just want to please him don't mix it
[1:29:54] with the things of the world come on you
[1:29:56] know what I'm saying let your motive be
[1:29:59] only for him if you're look at there's
[1:30:01] only one person that can change your
[1:30:03] life and that's Jesus
[1:30:06] Christ there's no human being that no no
[1:30:10] Seminary no no no uh uh meeting that you
[1:30:15] can have with the uh Dwayne
[1:30:19] DWI all these great
[1:30:22] people only God can change her nature
[1:30:26] and that simply comes it comes when you
[1:30:28] say I'm in love with the word I'm just
[1:30:30] going to start obeying it so we ought to
[1:30:33] give the more Earnest heed to the things
[1:30:36] that we have heard don't you believe
[1:30:37] right all right brother Bram said in the
[1:30:39] message God's only place of worship
[1:30:42] God's only provided place of worship he
[1:30:44] said
[1:30:45] now the word Deuteronomy right that's
[1:30:48] the fifth book in the Bible is that
[1:30:49] right is that is that the fifth one okay
[1:30:52] thank you he said the word itself means
[1:30:56] two
[1:30:58] laws the word
[1:31:00] Deuteronomy and God has two
[1:31:03] laws the two laws one of them is
[1:31:07] Disobedience to the word and
[1:31:10] die and the other is obedience to the
[1:31:13] word and live there's the two
[1:31:16] laws I never read that
[1:31:19] before too often we talk about the
[1:31:24] Lord and we become
[1:31:27] careless about his
[1:31:31] word yes God loves us yes God cares
[1:31:35] about us but also God has a word for us
[1:31:37] to live
[1:31:39] by and he said in Luke 6:46 write it
[1:31:42] down I'm going to have to go super duper
[1:31:43] fast and why call ye me Lord Lord and do
[1:31:49] not the things which I say
[1:31:52] I don't want to be of that group that
[1:31:54] says Lord Lord didn't I do many
[1:31:56] wonderful things for you while I was
[1:31:59] alive in my
[1:32:01] life and then know that there were
[1:32:04] things that I wasn't being obedient to I
[1:32:08] don't want to be part of that
[1:32:09] group I need your
[1:32:12] prayers you need my prayers you need the
[1:32:15] prayers of the person sitting next to
[1:32:17] you we need one another's prayers in
[1:32:19] fact you know what we need to spend more
[1:32:21] time praying for one another
[1:32:23] amen if you love me and I love you we're
[1:32:26] going to pray together we're going to
[1:32:27] pray for one
[1:32:33] another I don't want to neglect the word
[1:32:36] the word is the most important thing
[1:32:37] while we come to
[1:32:39] church I don't want to just praise him
[1:32:41] and not praise the word I want to do
[1:32:44] what the Bible says I want to magnify
[1:32:47] the word above his
[1:32:50] name I want when I I say amen I want it
[1:32:52] to be so be it in my
[1:32:55] life I don't want to have a
[1:32:58] pitchfork I don't want to say you know I
[1:33:01] really wish Bob was here
[1:33:04] today Bob needed to hear that
[1:33:07] one we don't have any Bobs here so I can
[1:33:10] say
[1:33:15] that don't wrestle with the
[1:33:18] word don't struggle with it Isaiah 4 59
[1:33:22] says woe unto him that striveth with his
[1:33:26] master look he's the Potter we're the
[1:33:30] clay we don't tell the Potter what to do
[1:33:33] with
[1:33:34] us know ye the Lord he is God I think
[1:33:39] that's the first thing we need to do
[1:33:41] know the Lord that he is God it is he
[1:33:43] that had made us and that we ourselves
[1:33:45] we are the his people and the Sheep of
[1:33:48] his
[1:33:50] pasture
[1:33:52] we
[1:33:54] are of his blood now think he gave his
[1:33:59] life at on Calvary for you he gave up
[1:34:02] his whole life for you that you could
[1:34:05] have
[1:34:07] life we need to love this word as much
[1:34:11] as God loves his
[1:34:13] word I mean how would you like to be
[1:34:15] married to somebody that was not even
[1:34:17] interested in the things you
[1:34:20] liked wouldn't that
[1:34:22] be we we call that hell on Earth don't
[1:34:27] we right why in the world would God want
[1:34:32] to be with
[1:34:34] somebody that wouldn't want to do his
[1:34:36] will it would be hell in heaven right
[1:34:40] you understand what I'm
[1:34:42] saying so we need to fall in love with
[1:34:45] this word more we need to magnify it
[1:34:47] more we need to to think about its
[1:34:49] importance when we're not here
[1:34:52] we come here to get the word and we we
[1:34:54] leave and we take the word with
[1:34:56] us man shall not live by bread alone but
[1:35:00] by every word that proceedeth out of the
[1:35:02] mouth of
[1:35:06] God every word which word are you
[1:35:08] leaving
[1:35:10] out think I would rather spend more time
[1:35:13] thinking about what I have yet to do
[1:35:16] than all the things that I have done all
[1:35:18] the things that I
[1:35:20] do
[1:35:23] right if I spend too much time thinking
[1:35:26] about everything all the great things
[1:35:28] I've done and how everything is
[1:35:30] wonderful and I might be missing God
[1:35:33] trying to tell me I want you to do
[1:35:36] this are you with me
[1:35:41] see all right if you got you got a
[1:35:44] pencil write down Matthew 33 to 30 uh
[1:35:49] 23 uh through 25 Matthew 23 23 through
[1:35:55] 25 and this is the scribes and Pharisees
[1:35:57] and they left out part of the
[1:36:00] word and and Jesus said you shouldn't
[1:36:02] have done that you shouldn't leave out
[1:36:05] part of the word God is looking for full
[1:36:08] obedience can you say Amen to that all
[1:36:11] right you going to bear with me a little
[1:36:12] bit I figured I could do this today
[1:36:14] because it wasn't Pastor appreciation
[1:36:16] day and you
[1:36:18] know I am so sorry that this is taken so
[1:36:21] long in the message the token brother
[1:36:23] brand says full obedience to the word of
[1:36:25] God the word Eternal in you and that is
[1:36:31] the token when the word is in you when
[1:36:37] the word is in you all right in the
[1:36:39] rising of the sun brother random said
[1:36:42] this Earthly body is quickened and
[1:36:45] brought by the quickening spirit to The
[1:36:49] Obedience of the word of God okay so so
[1:36:51] here it is I'll just say it like this it
[1:36:53] is the the holy spirit that quickens
[1:36:55] your body to fulfill to manifest the
[1:36:58] word the thing is it's got to start with
[1:37:01] one thing a desire inside your heart I
[1:37:05] heard the word I'm interested in
[1:37:07] pleasing you Lord in fact I want that to
[1:37:09] be above all my will I want to do your
[1:37:12] will when God sees that you have that
[1:37:15] desire and you're and you're knocking
[1:37:17] you're seeking you're you're calling
[1:37:20] upon him you're saying God I want to
[1:37:22] love you the way your word is calling me
[1:37:24] to love you when he sees that then he
[1:37:27] sends his spirit and he will Quicken the
[1:37:29] very thing that you're Desiring in his
[1:37:31] word and you will manifest it amen do
[1:37:36] not wait for God to fill you with the
[1:37:38] Holy Ghost so you can obey the word it
[1:37:39] ain't going to work like that he gives
[1:37:42] the Holy Ghost to them that obey him so
[1:37:44] there has to be some action being put
[1:37:47] forth on our ends it's a love
[1:37:50] relationship
[1:37:51] you can't get the Holy Ghost by coming
[1:37:53] to
[1:37:56] church you can't get the Holy Ghost by
[1:37:58] just paying
[1:38:02] ties it takes
[1:38:04] heart it takes heart you got to get your
[1:38:06] heart
[1:38:07] involved exalt the word I come here to
[1:38:11] exalt the
[1:38:12] word too often we just come with greedy
[1:38:16] hands it's all about
[1:38:18] me not all about me it's all about him
[1:38:21] that's why I'm here I understand if
[1:38:24] we're young in the Lord but look if
[1:38:26] you've tasted that the Lord is good he
[1:38:29] expect some maturing to take place are
[1:38:32] you with me all right in the message
[1:38:34] Investments brother R says how how does
[1:38:37] this
[1:38:38] happen how does it come by all night
[1:38:42] fasting he said well that's good by all
[1:38:46] night prayer meeting well that's still
[1:38:48] good but obedience to the word is where
[1:38:53] it comes obeying the
[1:38:56] word their interest of what part of the
[1:38:58] word I'm not obeying you ever looked
[1:39:00] Lord how can I get things better how can
[1:39:02] I get more joy how can I get more peace
[1:39:04] how can I how can I just have this
[1:39:06] energy to serve you well let's start
[1:39:09] with Lord is there anything in my life
[1:39:11] that I'm not doing that you've asked me
[1:39:13] to do a month
[1:39:17] ago did I miss
[1:39:19] something see you know what's happen
[1:39:21] happening when you ask that question
[1:39:22] you're getting real with your
[1:39:24] heart you're getting more into your
[1:39:26] heart you got to meet God in there he
[1:39:28] says in that day I'll meet you in
[1:39:31] there right here amen that's where God
[1:39:34] wants to meet you right inside your
[1:39:38] heart get that word in there in the
[1:39:40] message blind bmus brother B says just
[1:39:42] like the brass serpent why that serpent
[1:39:46] didn't have any no virtue in it it was a
[1:39:49] piece of brass
[1:39:51] they brought it up out of
[1:39:53] Egypt neither did the pole have any
[1:39:56] virtue in it not a bit but it was
[1:40:00] obeying what God Said do what brought
[1:40:03] the power what brought the virtue is
[1:40:06] obedience to the word of God Amen
[1:40:10] sometimes we look at everything carnal
[1:40:11] well this doesn't matter and that
[1:40:12] doesn't matter and you know it doesn't
[1:40:14] matter how you act in church and it
[1:40:15] doesn't matter what you it doesn't
[1:40:16] matter if you come God still you know
[1:40:18] what there's no virtue in that type of
[1:40:20] thinking
[1:40:22] amen you to cast that
[1:40:24] down there's virtue that comes from
[1:40:27] obeying the word of God in your
[1:40:34] life the Bible says let us offer the
[1:40:37] sacrifice of praise of God continually
[1:40:41] that is the fruit of our lips giving
[1:40:42] thanks to his name so we need to praise
[1:40:45] God we need to use the name of the Lord
[1:40:47] but what else do we need to do obey the
[1:40:49] word we need to exalt that
[1:40:52] that's what's most important the prophet
[1:40:57] Samuel have and Samuel said have the
[1:41:00] Lord he's asking a question now have the
[1:41:03] Lord as great Delight in burnt offerings
[1:41:07] and
[1:41:08] sacrifices as in obeying the voice of
[1:41:11] the Lord is a good question does he does
[1:41:15] he have as great
[1:41:19] Delight he said be hold to obey is
[1:41:23] better than
[1:41:24] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[1:41:28] rams obedience is what matters to God
[1:41:32] you know we were created to do his will
[1:41:35] we were born again not to do a different
[1:41:39] will that we want to do you understand
[1:41:43] it wasn't just recognizing okay I can't
[1:41:45] be in the bars and I I I can't play that
[1:41:47] kind of music and I I can't smoke that
[1:41:49] stuff anymore but I'm going to go over
[1:41:52] here and I'm going to start doing
[1:41:54] this when you're born again you're born
[1:41:56] again to one will that's the will of God
[1:41:59] not a different will in this world we
[1:42:01] got to understand this word is the
[1:42:04] absolute for the believer am it is what
[1:42:07] it means to be born again right it isn't
[1:42:10] something that we just say we're born
[1:42:11] again because we got baptized 10 years
[1:42:14] ago come
[1:42:16] on every day we should be getting closer
[1:42:18] and closer to God
[1:42:25] how you doing how's your feelings right
[1:42:29] now are you wishing I was done I just
[1:42:32] want to know some of those thoughts
[1:42:33] you're thinking right
[1:42:36] now brother Brenham said in the message
[1:42:38] the resurrection of Lazarus he says look
[1:42:41] just before the coming of the righteous
[1:42:43] one the great Son of God God sent an
[1:42:46] angel down and the angel come to a home
