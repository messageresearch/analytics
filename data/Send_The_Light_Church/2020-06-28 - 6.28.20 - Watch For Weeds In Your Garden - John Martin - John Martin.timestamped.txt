[28:27] stand together for the reading of the
[28:28] word I ought to say there there couldn't
[28:30] have been a better course before the
[28:35] word I wasn't asking the Lord for a
[28:38] vindication I wasn't looking for
[28:42] anything like that
[28:42] he just sometimes you just know but I
[28:45] had written this song sort of course to

[29:04] Lord with you he's here
[29:05] amen god bless you let's turn in the
[29:08] book of Ecclesiastes for one verse there
[29:12] please yesyes chapter five and this
[29:16] really wasn't even the
[29:25] the opening scripture I've been studying
[29:27] for a couple weeks now but it's the one
[29:35] that I wanted to read to start amen
[29:38] maybe we could just look to the Lord in
[29:40] a word of Prayer at this at this time
[29:42] before we read it
[29:43] Heavenly Father we're so grateful Lord
[29:47] for your presence today Lord you've made
[29:52] the promise in your word you've never
[29:54] lied he never failed before he said when
[29:58] just two or three would be gathered
[30:00] together in your name that you would be
[30:05] right there in the midst we thank you
[30:07] for being in our midst today
[30:09] Lord we also know that you inhabit the
[30:12] praises of your people and we thank you
[30:15] for inhabiting not only our lives and
[30:19] our minds that our hearts today our
[30:23] praise could come from the depths of our
[30:26] hearts Lord we ask that she would take
[30:30] control of our hearts and our minds and
[30:32] this time Lord we pray that you raise up
[30:36] a standard against the enemy who would
[30:37] come in and try to cause an unbelief and
[30:43] a confusion and anything that would
[30:47] hinder your word from bringing forth
[30:50] fruit in our lives pray that you bless
[30:53] each one today Lord we commit our hearts
[30:57] in your hands our souls Lord or we
[31:01] commit the service to you now receive
[31:03] glory and honor through each one we pray
[31:07] in Jesus Christ's name we ask
[31:10] amen please yes use chapter 5 verse 1
[31:13] keep thy foot when thou goes to the
[31:16] house of God and be more ready to hear
[31:18] than to give the sacrifice of fools for
[31:22] they consider not that they do evil and
[31:25] God bless you may be seated
[31:27] I want to say it's good to have brother
[31:28] Samuel here and brother Bruce and sister
[31:34] Donna could make a pit stop with us
[31:36] because we weren't expecting this
[31:39] blessing but they had to do a little
[31:43] repair and we're just grateful to see
[31:47] them especially sister Donna it's been a
[31:49] long time yeah god bless you well we had
[31:54] a wonderful prayer meeting Wednesday did
[31:55] we know Amen it's good to hear that
[31:59] testimony from our brother man brother
[32:02] Ben as you know is come up most of you
[32:04] know brother ben god bless her is right
[32:06] here I don't know your name but God
[32:08] bless you sir mmm Chris god bless you
[32:13] brother band has come up for prayer many
[32:15] times and I just I'm so thankful to see
[32:22] God's grace prevail amen well a couple
[32:32] weeks ago two to three weeks ago
[32:36] something had come out of my heart and
[32:38] it is basically seeing how this
[32:42] coronavirus and how it will start with
[32:47] the corner virus but you know we've got
[32:48] all the riots and how the government's
[32:53] handling things the economy so many
[32:56] things are affecting the world affecting
[32:59] the nation but it's also affecting the
[33:02] believer causing many to kind of drift
[33:06] out of their place and
[33:11] it's cause they're real squeeze on
[33:13] people and that's there's really the
[33:19] very burden for this message today
[33:20] because I believe that we can't allow
[33:26] anything to get us away from what God
[33:29] originally gave us the word for so we
[33:34] want to title this message watch for
[33:37] weeds in your garden and for a subject
[33:40] we've been called to bring forth the
[33:43] word that God places in our heart we're
[33:45] going to get into the four types of of
[33:47] ground but today I just want to say I'm
[33:50] thankful that the doors are open
[33:52] there's many churches honestly that the
[33:55] doors are shut
[33:57] today it's a privilege for us to gather
[34:00] together we don't want to take it for
[34:01] granted we we want always pray that God
[34:04] protects us here and that the doors can
[34:07] continue to stay open but going to the
[34:10] house of God is sufficient for a lot of
[34:12] people maybe doing their Sunday Duty as
[34:15] long as I make it there everything
[34:17] should be fine but in this opening
[34:19] scripture the preparation of the heart
[34:22] is more important than simply going to
[34:23] church without preparation believers
[34:27] won't consider that they do even I want
[34:29] you to think of that statement without
[34:31] preparation believers will not consider
[34:33] that they do evil and if we're not ready
[34:36] to hear the word the word will not
[34:38] profit us in others we've got to better
[34:41] believe so why does the Lord want us to
[34:44] remember that we do evil when we get in
[34:46] our car and we're heading to church so
[34:50] we'll be more ready to receive the word
[34:53] sometimes we can come all proud I got it
[34:57] together I'm fine but if we consider
[35:03] that we'll do evil will be more open to
[35:06] hear more the gospel God has ample
[35:10] revelation to the humble and her
[35:14] Jesus loved us he he proved it at
[35:17] Calvary he died to set us free of
[35:19] Ephesians chapter 5 verse 23 says for
[35:23] the husband is the head of the wife even
[35:26] as Christ is the head of our church amen
[35:29] he has to he's that of the church but we
[35:32] have to allow him to be head of this
[35:34] church and he is the savior of the body
[35:37] therefore as the church is subject now
[35:39] we're subject unto the word unto Christ
[35:42] so let the wives be to their own
[35:44] husbands and everything husbands love
[35:46] your wives even as Christ loved the
[35:48] church and gave himself for there it is
[35:51] Jesus loved us he gave himself for us
[35:53] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[35:56] with the watering of the washing of the
[35:58] watering of the word that he might
[36:00] present to himself a glorious church not
[36:02] having spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[36:03] but that it should be holy and without
[36:05] blemish
[36:06] I thought Calvary sanctified me Calvary
[36:12] made it possible for the Living Word to
[36:14] come upon you and wash you that's what
[36:19] Calvary did Jesus loves us so much that
[36:23] He gave His eternal word the Living Word
[36:28] is forever son in heaven for the purpose
[36:31] that he might wash as sanctifies cleanse
[36:35] us get is prepared for for a
[36:40] relationship with him for eternal life
[36:43] that he might sanctify and cleanse us
[36:46] with the washing of the water by the
[36:49] word so that's showing the importance of
[36:51] coming to church and hearing the word
[36:53] because there's a washing that takes
[36:56] place Jesus died to set us free
[37:03] but it's the Living Word or the life of
[37:06] Christ that really sets us free yes it's
[37:10] the Spirit of God inside the word that's
[37:13] being preached yes we can feel his
[37:15] presence here but it may not change us
[37:18] here so that spirit has to come inside
[37:21] our mind our hearts our souls
[37:24] and have preeminence he's the head of
[37:27] the church Jesus said in John 8:36 if
[37:31] the son therefore shall make you free
[37:33] you shall be free indeed yeah but how
[37:38] does this happen did Calvary do it all
[37:40] by itself why would we have to be washed
[37:43] by the word see Calvary played its pace
[37:48] it's parked and the full torment of
[37:51] Calvary does washes but the phone Tolman
[37:54] is the spirit that Jesus died now could
[37:57] come back upon the believer and sanctify
[38:01] us he get us ready for heaven of Jesus
[38:04] said in in verse 31 if you continue in
[38:08] my word then are you my disciples indeed
[38:12] and you shall know the truth and the
[38:15] truth shall make you free how many is a
[38:21] disciple indeed that means you're
[38:25] continuing in the word if you continue
[38:31] in the word you will continue to be set
[38:35] free now this is a this is this kind of
[38:38] goes against our our thinking like I'm
[38:40] already free what I have to be set free
[38:43] you aren't afraid he them the Sun is set
[38:46] free is free indeed
[38:48] but he's given us more of his word and
[38:51] the word sets us free you shall know the
[38:54] truth and the truth shall make you free
[38:59] my backside a lot I fall I sin you know
[39:06] what the devil has a way of not letting
[39:08] you know that you've done that but when
[39:12] you come and you place yourself at the
[39:14] presence of Lord before the Living Word
[39:16] and that Living Word begins to to deal
[39:19] with your heart remind you of certain
[39:22] things
[39:24] then we have a chance to release that
[39:27] and be set free from that situation is
[39:30] not just of our sins in the past right
[39:34] way past cuz they're though they're done
[39:37] forgotten right there does he
[39:39] forgetfulness but there's new things
[39:42] that God wants to deal with us now the
[39:45] Prophet said the Prophet Solomon said be
[39:50] prepared for the word of God when it's
[39:52] preached to you be more ready to hear
[39:56] prophet and our day said when we come to
[39:59] the house of God we don't know where
[40:01] we're really at that's another hard one
[40:04] to accept because we're every man's
[40:07] right in his eyes and he feels he's got
[40:08] it together and and and this is I know
[40:11] ROM Matt so it's a little contrary so
[40:16] when we come we come to find out where
[40:19] we're at not to gather new information
[40:21] it's all about relationship and the
[40:26] preparation of the heart before the word
[40:28] is preached is critical to the believer
[40:30] I cannot over emphasize that enough we
[40:35] want to watch for the weeds in our
[40:37] garden this morning we want to not only
[40:39] learn how to take care of those weeds
[40:42] but we want to be able to see them in
[40:44] seed form before they begin to grow
[40:46] right Matthew chapter 13 certainly what
[40:50] verse number one as a parable about the
[40:53] four conditions of the heart week we
[40:56] preached actually we studied on this in
[40:58] the past we've done a series on it but I
[41:01] want to concentrate on one of them that
[41:04] I believe is affecting the church in
[41:06] this hour we'll start with verse 1 the
[41:09] same day what Jesus out of the house and
[41:11] sat by the seaside and great multitudes
[41:14] were gathered together with him so that
[41:16] he went to a ship and sat and the whole
[41:18] multitude stood on the shore and he
[41:20] spake many things unto them and terrible
[41:23] saying behold a sower went forth to soul
[41:25] and when he and when he sold some seeds
[41:27] fell by the way side and the fowls came
[41:30] and devoured them up so it's almost like
[41:33] that didn't even do any good
[41:37] some fell upon stony places when where
[41:42] they had not much earth for and
[41:44] forthwith they sprung up because had no
[41:47] deepness of earth and when the Sun was
[41:49] up they were scorched because they had
[41:52] no root they withered away and some of
[41:54] them fell among the thorns is where we
[41:57] want to be focusing on and the thorns
[41:59] sprung up and choked them but the others
[42:01] fell to good ground and brought forth
[42:03] fruit some one hundredfold some
[42:05] sixtyfold and some thirtyfold who have
[42:07] ears to hear let him hear
[42:09] citizeness something how Jesus had
[42:11] purposely spoke in parables he knew some
[42:16] would have ears in some woman's he
[42:18] didn't speak in such a way that made is
[42:20] just plain for everybody so we've got to
[42:23] want to have these ears you've got to
[42:26] have a desire to hear what God's really
[42:28] trying to say to us people will come to
[42:31] church to sit down in the comfort or in
[42:34] the comfort of their homes to hear the
[42:36] word of God are not all the same Jesus
[42:43] being the Great Physician here shares
[42:45] four different heart conditions of the
[42:47] believers before the word of the Lord
[42:50] before the word is being preached right
[42:52] it's a condition to the heart before the
[42:54] word comes inside yeah we can see by
[42:58] this parable that the preparation is
[43:00] more important than making it to church
[43:04] putting on a tape or reading the Bible
[43:07] without proper condition inside of our
[43:10] heart the word will not work for us
[43:13] that's really really important it really
[43:15] just shines a light of the importance of
[43:18] our heart being prepared more more
[43:20] important than just while I'm going to
[43:21] pick up the bag I'll read it I'm gonna
[43:23] put a tape on to listen to it yes the
[43:27] word is perfect the word is pure and
[43:29] nothing is greater it's forever settled
[43:31] but the letter will kill us we need the
[43:36] spirit of the word and it's got to have
[43:39] Liberty we're going to look at giving us
[43:45] grace to get into it today
[43:47] we're going to look
[43:48] a little bit of the nature that God has
[43:51] the nature of God to I mean when you
[43:53] want to know something you want to know
[43:54] their nature have a person they are what
[43:58] they expect verse number 10 and that and
[44:01] the disciples came and said unto Him why
[44:03] speakest thou unto them in parables and
[44:06] he answered and said unto them because
[44:07] it's given unto you to know the
[44:08] mysteries of the kingdom in heaven but
[44:10] to them it is not given now God is no
[44:13] respecter persons but God knows down
[44:19] that our heads God knows who loves him
[44:23] and those who want to steal eternal life
[44:27] I can't steal from God it's a
[44:35] relationship you give your life he gave
[44:38] you a lot he gave his life for you but
[44:42] whosoever hath to him shall be given and
[44:44] he shall have more abundance but
[44:47] whosoever hath not for him it shall be
[44:49] taken away even that he hath therefore
[44:51] speak unto them in parables because they
[44:53] seen really don't see right and they
[44:57] hear and really don't hear neither do
[44:59] they understand and end M is for Phil
[45:02] the prophecy of Isaiah which saith by
[45:05] hearing ye shall hear and shall not
[45:06] understand and seeing as you see in the
[45:08] perceive for this people's heart notice
[45:12] the condition of their heart is waxed
[45:15] gross right you've heard of something
[45:20] that was well that's gross loo well
[45:25] Jesus looks at a heart than just so hard
[45:29] and wax gross their ears are dull of
[45:32] hearing that oh they don't want to hear
[45:34] their eyes are closed if they don't see
[45:38] exactly what they want to see less than
[45:40] any time they should see with their eyes
[45:42] and hear with their ears and should
[45:43] understand with their heart and should
[45:44] be converted and I should heal them see
[45:47] what the purpose of the word is to bring
[45:50] a conversion amen
[45:53] would heal their souls and but blessed
[45:57] are your eyes can you say amen to that
[46:00] for they see and your ears for they hear
[46:02] for a family I say to you that many
[46:03] prophets and righteous men have desired
[46:06] to see those things what you see and
[46:08] have not seen them and to hear the
[46:11] things what you hear and have not heard
[46:13] them yeah hear ye therefore the parable
[46:15] of the sower when any one heareth the
[46:19] word of God and understandeth it not
[46:20] then cometh the wicked one and catcheth
[46:24] away that means pluck or pull or take by
[46:28] force that which was sown in his heart
[46:31] this is he that receiveth see by the way
[46:34] say when you come to church you just
[46:36] don't want your mind to be wandering
[46:39] here and there and doing all this stuff
[46:43] because before that word really gets
[46:46] ahold the devil can just take it away
[46:50] from you yea how many times she just
[46:54] you've been to church and hardly
[46:56] remember what was preached when Jesus
[47:01] preached to those to walk into the mass
[47:03] he said did not our hearts burn within
[47:05] us as he talked with this along the way
[47:09] there's got to be a connection on the
[47:11] inside for the word amen that will has
[47:15] the ability to take away things that
[47:17] have been sown in her heart now that's
[47:19] scary it's quite simple if the word that
[47:25] was just received is it grasped and we
[47:30] don't see it with great importance we
[47:32] don't take it personally then the devil
[47:34] would take away and help you forget the
[47:39] very thing that was sown into your heart
[47:43] too often we're content with just
[47:45] listening to the word or just making it
[47:49] to church but the thing is this is not
[47:52] going to bring forth any fruit in our
[47:54] life make us good church members we
[47:57] don't want to be good church members we
[47:59] want to be ready for a rapture amen
[48:03] remember the importance of the preaching
[48:05] of the word Jesus said in John 6:63 the
[48:09] words that I speak unto you they are
[48:11] spirit and they are life so we've got to
[48:19] catch it we've got to catch the life of
[48:21] the word not just the the natural
[48:24] intellectual understanding of it but the
[48:27] spirit of it he didn't say my words are
[48:29] intellectual their knowledge their
[48:32] encyclopedia their spirit and their life
[48:36] something happens inside of a believer
[48:40] that receives the Living Word of God
[48:45] so getting understanding takes effort
[48:50] desire time sacrifice love it takes a
[48:54] great interest so that's we we that's
[48:58] our hearts got to be there to understand
[49:02] the word we just can't as a word and
[49:04] don't mean I don't mean this wrong sit
[49:06] there's a bump on a log because you're
[49:08] all sitting there and we're all feel
[49:09] like we can take that one I don't mean
[49:11] it like that but talking about the
[49:12] condition of our heart we've got to be
[49:15] involved because God's presence is
[49:18] Harry's presenting himself to you yes
[49:21] this isn't some seminar where we we
[49:25] learn about something no this is God
[49:28] dealing with our relationship with him
[49:30] verse 20 but he then receiveth the seed
[49:33] into stony places the same is he that
[49:35] heareth the word and a nun with joy
[49:38] receiveth it yes now you might think it
[49:44] would be good enough just to receive the
[49:45] word but it's not good enough the
[49:48] condition of our heart must be right
[49:50] before we receive the Word of God in
[49:53] order for the word to go deep inside of
[49:57] our lives because if it only goes so far
[50:01] we're gonna rejoice in this part but
[50:07] when we get tested out there we're gonna
[50:11] get offended if
[50:12] word doesn't go real deep you can't have
[50:17] a shallow relationship with God the word
[50:21] needs to come deep inside of us forever
[50:24] settled in heaven inside of us stony
[50:31] I don't want hard places remember what
[50:33] happened the children of Israel God
[50:34] blessed them and set them free they were
[50:36] walking out of Egypt Jesus set me free I
[50:39] was bound but Jesus set me free but
[50:43] because they had hard spots in their
[50:47] life
[50:47] they were willing to go all the way with
[50:50] God they got offended began to murmur
[50:54] and complained about the preacher they
[50:59] didn't quite like what was going on in
[51:01] church fact they were more spiritual
[51:06] than Moses terrible attitude
[51:11] verse 21 yet have he not root in himself
[51:16] but dureth for a while for when
[51:18] tribulation or persecution arises
[51:20] because of the word in other words it's
[51:22] going to happen they not live godly in
[51:24] Christ Jesus
[51:25] they're going to suffer persecution by
[51:28] and by he is offended now notice in this
[51:31] condition the word is received into the
[51:33] heart with joy but because the receiver
[51:37] of the word didn't think it was
[51:38] necessary to have their heart unhardened
[51:42] before the work was breached
[51:47] before the word was preached the word
[51:51] the word fell down into the heart but it
[51:56] fell on the hardness it couldn't go
[52:01] beyond a certain spot but if you get rid
[52:05] of the hardness before the word comes
[52:07] then he can go deep he also that
[52:13] received seed among the thorns is he
[52:17] that heareth the word and the care of
[52:22] this world and the deceitfulness of
[52:25] riches choke the word and he becometh
[52:29] untruthful right in this condition the
[52:34] word is received into the heart at
[52:39] church but because the receive of the
[52:42] word didn't think it was necessary to
[52:44] clear out the other things that were in
[52:46] the heart there wasn't enough room in
[52:50] the heart for the word to continue to
[52:53] bring forth what it was intended to
[52:55] bring forth yes we need to catch this
[53:01] the word cannot and will not grow
[53:03] simultaneously for very long in
[53:06] somebody's life it may start out that
[53:09] way but eventually I don't care what it
[53:13] is in there God will not take second
[53:17] place any of it it can start out that
[53:24] way but eventually the same desire that
[53:27] wanted it to be there in the first place
[53:29] would take over in the end I want you to
[53:33] think about that we let things in our
[53:38] heart we let things in her life and they
[53:42] seem harmless and not that big of a deal
[53:44] yeah but the very thing that we allowed
[53:48] in that we didn't think it was a big
[53:50] deal God says I am NOT going to share
[53:54] your heart with that
[53:57] so those things will always choke out
[54:01] the word now we know the word is the
[54:03] most powerful thing right but God will
[54:06] not surpass free more agency he will not
[54:09] undo your will for something else in
[54:12] there those things will naturally choke
[54:16] the word out and will never become
[54:18] fruitful we got to clean the heart out
[54:22] first it's God's requirement he that
[54:26] receiveth the seed into good ground see
[54:29] that here at the word they understand it
[54:30] it and also bear fruit bring bringing
[54:33] forth some 160 and 30 fold on this last
[54:38] day believe it or not we're just getting
[54:40] to the that was just the foundation I
[54:42] don't know what that is but I got to
[54:45] really work on my foundations in this
[54:50] last day it's the most deceptive in
[54:53] history the most perilous times of all
[54:57] ages in this hour Jesus talked about the
[55:01] two spirits being so close that most
[55:04] people can't tell the difference
[55:08] believers in this age are mixing the
[55:11] word with hearts that have been occupied
[55:14] with other things we think it doesn't
[55:21] matter because Satan deals with this
[55:23] outside of the church
[55:32] you
[55:37] if their heart condition is so dangerous
[55:39] and deceitful is because at the time the
[55:42] word is received the thorns are already
[55:46] inside of us yes they seem quite
[55:51] harmless innocent powerless gentle they
[55:55] can even appear non-toxic in other words
[55:59] controllable or they're manageable
[56:02] they're just little bitty seeds some
[56:07] tender plant you know maybe it's just
[56:10] buddy it's not a real big deal nothing
[56:13] to worry about got a handle mind your
[56:18] own business
[56:20] good I got a good relationship my god I
[56:26] love God always remember that eventually
[56:32] whichever word that was received from
[56:35] the Lord will never be able to come to
[56:39] fruition or maturity if you have other
[56:43] desires and cares inside of your heart
[56:48] those other desires and cares will
[56:51] always choke out the word so it's not a
[56:56] matter of course I love God more that's
[56:58] not it
[57:00] God don't want any of it there God only
[57:04] always living in me amen
[57:06] the thorns of this life will always
[57:09] choke out the life of God sure is
[57:13] anything thorns will grow and eventually
[57:16] choke us they may seem small and
[57:20] insignificant but they will take over
[57:22] our thoughts our time our desires and
[57:28] our actions they will just get a hold of
[57:30] us believers are mixing the preaching of
[57:36] the word with their hearts that are
[57:38] already preoccupied with other things
[57:41] the things of this world I just want to
[57:44] kind of break this one down a little bit
[57:47] I'm not okay if I can do this
[57:50] Jesus mentions first the cares of this
[57:53] world this age in this particular age
[57:56] that we're living in good bad ugly or
[57:59] indifferent anyway you want to slice it
[58:01] there's a lot of cares in this world yes
[58:04] that word cares means through the idea
[58:08] of distraction through the idea of
[58:15] distraction it means solicitude these
[58:19] cares are not necessarily always evil
[58:23] but they're still care of the sage and
[58:26] saint will use to distract you from
[58:29] bringing forth the fruit that the word
[58:30] had intended you to bring forth now
[58:34] these distractions could be things that
[58:37] are that are caused by anxiety
[58:40] yeah anxiety in our life now just think
[58:44] about what we're going through
[58:47] apprehension worry uneasiness distress
[58:54] of mine caused by fear danger or
[58:57] misfortune now that's just the word this
[59:01] is what a care could be it causes
[59:05] anxiety or concerned it can be an
[59:08] attitude of expressing excessive
[59:10] intended in other words you're just
[59:11] paying attention to something too much
[59:13] right makes you feel uneasy discs
[59:18] uncomfortable it now becomes a care that
[59:21] talks the word out even though we still
[59:25] say I'm a believer so did the children
[59:28] of Israel that came out of Egypt that's
[59:32] not good enough
[59:33] they should have continued in the word
[59:35] the word is coming for you to continue
[59:38] in they thought they had the main thing
[59:49] handled - they were out of Egypt
[59:53] fill-in-the-blank like it or not we all
[59:56] have a lot of things to deal with you
[59:59] probably don't realize it but Satan uses
[1:00:02] them to distract you they're more likely
[1:00:07] distracting you from manifesting the
[1:00:09] word of the Lord
[1:00:11] too often believers are content with
[1:00:14] just hearing the word making it to
[1:00:15] church I've heard some in church with a
[1:00:19] pitchfork spirit on them in other words
[1:00:27] this is for somebody I'm thinking about
[1:00:33] as if the word was mostly for somebody
[1:00:37] else
[1:00:37] I'm so glad when I can come to church
[1:00:39] there's such a personal relationship
[1:00:41] that I can receive from Christ you know
[1:00:49] there are people who would judge other
[1:00:52] people think about people to judge them
[1:00:54] but they won't think about people to
[1:00:56] wash their feet God has has called us to
[1:01:05] lay down our life for one another not
[1:01:08] pitchfork the word on here the word is
[1:01:14] meant to help correct your life it ain't
[1:01:18] for you to correct somebody else's life
[1:01:22] not to judge others with the word that
[1:01:27] you hear is completely for you to
[1:01:29] manifest more off that's what the word
[1:01:31] is for get in love with the word this
[1:01:34] morning amen God's intentions for
[1:01:37] speaking his word is for you to receive
[1:01:39] into her and to bring forth the fruit or
[1:01:42] the manifestation of that word that's
[1:01:45] why the Prophet could say we could never
[1:01:47] leave the church the same way that we
[1:01:48] came in we will either be drawn closer
[1:01:51] to him because we've received the word
[1:01:53] into her heart or we've rejected the
[1:01:56] word right and now his relationship with
[1:02:00] you becomes more distant God wouldn't do
[1:02:05] that jesus said if his word is sown into
[1:02:16] a heart that's already has other seeds
[1:02:19] the word will not prevail through the
[1:02:22] other seeds so it's not just a matter of
[1:02:26] I meant to church I'm receiving the word
[1:02:28] I'm real happy and excited about this
[1:02:31] this whole parable about the other
[1:02:33] things that's happening their heart that
[1:02:35] has nothing to do with the word that got
[1:02:37] preached it's those things that is
[1:02:41] keeping the word from becoming
[1:02:42] manifested of the Prophet taught us in
[1:02:45] this hour there is coming to squeeze
[1:02:49] we're feeling it I never thought it
[1:02:53] would be just look these thorns are
[1:02:57] choking the word they're squeezing the
[1:03:00] life of Christ out of us we need to
[1:03:03] recognize it the thing is all this
[1:03:13] that's happening people do not recognize
[1:03:16] it they keep going to church they become
[1:03:23] unfruitful right they lose their joy
[1:03:29] these are piece all sudden think you
[1:03:32] have a hard time loving Nick we is
[1:03:35] abounding they're struggling right
[1:03:39] they're losing their fruit instead of
[1:03:49] justifying some misfortune in her life
[1:03:52] let's recognize the devil is wanting to
[1:03:55] use this thing to distract us from the
[1:03:58] word that we heard in church last time
[1:04:00] we came we think it's not that big a
[1:04:04] deal buy what the word or just put a
[1:04:06] tape on right think about attitude
[1:04:09] you're having right now don't allow
[1:04:20] yourself to develop an attitude of an
[1:04:23] excessive attendant Asst about other
[1:04:26] things this news that we hear on all the
[1:04:34] stations of our phone or the TV or the
[1:04:39] radio will not bring you closer to Jesus
[1:04:48] it's not good news don't worry yourself
[1:04:55] sick about things
[1:04:57] don't let it cause anxiety in your minds
[1:05:03] first Peter chapter 5 verse 7 casting
[1:05:10] all your care upon him hate men just
[1:05:15] cast it on him for he careth for you yea
[1:05:18] what's he want us to do he wants us to
[1:05:21] be sober be vigilant be prepared when
[1:05:25] you come to hear the word of God because
[1:05:27] your adversary the devil as a roaring
[1:05:29] lion walketh about seeking whom he may
[1:05:31] devour
[1:05:32] Satan is she
[1:05:33] using it to distract you from
[1:05:35] manifesting the word is not just saying
[1:05:39] well I'm a Christian I'm going to heaven
[1:05:40] who's interested in manifesting the word
[1:05:44] who's interested in manifesting
[1:05:47] something greater in their trial than
[1:05:49] they did last week last month that's
[1:05:52] where God is at where are we at
[1:05:57] who resists steadfast in the faith
[1:06:01] knowing that the same things that are
[1:06:03] happening yes in your life right are
[1:06:08] happening to your other brothers and
[1:06:10] sisters in the world yes you're not the
[1:06:13] only one going through this misfortune
[1:06:16] we're all having misfortunes roll off
[1:06:19] the face the same battles but the word
[1:06:24] but the God of all Grace who have called
[1:06:27] us unto his eternal glory of Jesus
[1:06:30] Christ after that you've suffered a
[1:06:31] while
[1:06:32] make you perfect stablish strength in
[1:06:33] the center you see there God doesn't
[1:06:35] gonna take away your suffering why
[1:06:39] because through this there's a there's
[1:06:42] an opportunity for you to become perfect
[1:06:43] yeah to become stablish strengthen and
[1:06:46] to settle you place blows up I'm son
[1:06:52] solid ground today the word I can still
[1:06:56] manifest in this hour I just I don't I'm
[1:07:00] not gonna have time to read everything I
[1:07:01] just want to read this quote but the man
[1:07:03] said the end time eventually said Peter
[1:07:05] had a sword he pulled the sword he was
[1:07:08] going to cut the high priests ear off
[1:07:10] and the things like that he did but when
[1:07:12] it come to the real Christian courage he
[1:07:15] didn't have it he backed up and denied
[1:07:18] him is that right he could have cut the
[1:07:21] high priest ear off with the sword sure
[1:07:23] he known how to hand on but when it come
[1:07:26] to the squeeze and that end time to
[1:07:30] stand on the word of God he didn't have
[1:07:33] the courage and even denied that he
[1:07:36] known Jesus
[1:07:42] we need to become established
[1:07:45] strengthened settled and perfect in this
[1:07:48] hour we need a go on to perfection the
[1:07:51] word needs to become real to us
[1:07:53] Laurie O'Toole I'm talking about the
[1:07:55] spirit of the word the life of the word
[1:07:58] living in me now another thing that
[1:08:04] Jesus mentions is a thorn is the
[1:08:06] deceitfulness of riches riches in
[1:08:10] themselves are not bad
[1:08:12] Abraham job Solomon were good examples
[1:08:15] of that
[1:08:19] thing is these men didn't ask for it
[1:08:23] they didn't ask for it
[1:08:26] God chose it now I'm not saying you know
[1:08:31] we have not because we ask that but we
[1:08:32] need to be careful when you ask for
[1:08:34] riches because God
[1:08:46] odd gave them character to use it one
[1:08:51] thing that makes rich is so deceitful is
[1:08:54] simply the quiet yet strong desire for
[1:08:58] them that strong desire for them could
[1:09:02] be quiet to talk about it just inside
[1:09:06] when you have money you can buy anything
[1:09:08] you want
[1:09:09] so that desire opens that door a man
[1:09:14] brother
[1:09:14] first Timothy chapter 6 verse 6 amen
[1:09:19] brother you're with us amen praise God
[1:09:24] it's an order amen but godliness with
[1:09:28] contentment is a great game yeah
[1:09:31] for we brought nothing into this world
[1:09:34] and certainly we carry nothing out
[1:09:36] intent but think that will be now notice
[1:09:39] this they that will be we're talking on
[1:09:41] a desire I'm going after it hey that
[1:09:44] will be they're not rich it's just the
[1:09:47] desire to go after it they that will be
[1:09:50] rich fall into temptation and a snare
[1:09:52] too many foolish and hurtful lusts which
[1:09:55] drown men into destruction tradition
[1:09:58] yeah for the love of money right perhaps
[1:10:02] quiet yet strong desire for it is the
[1:10:05] root of all evil yes for which some
[1:10:09] coveted after they have erred from the
[1:10:12] faith notice they were in the faith but
[1:10:15] they erred from it and it pierced
[1:10:17] themselves through with many sorrows
[1:10:19] many sorrows going after something we
[1:10:24] need to be going after the word the word
[1:10:27] the word that we don't have not the word
[1:10:30] we have go after the word we don't have
[1:10:33] there's more of God to manifest we need
[1:10:36] to rise our expectation for more of the
[1:10:39] life of Christ in this that can handle
[1:10:41] the situation when we come into a
[1:10:43] temptation or to a trial when they have
[1:10:47] a chance to spread the good news that's
[1:10:49] all persecution
[1:10:54] another thing that makes rich is so
[1:10:56] deceitful is the snare we fall into as
[1:10:59] we pursue them it's a snare to go after
[1:11:07] them
[1:11:09] it's a snare what we go through
[1:11:11] going after deceitfulness of riches are
[1:11:16] thorns that will keep the word that you
[1:11:18] hear from bringing forth the fruit in
[1:11:21] your life now yes we can come to church
[1:11:24] and we can hear the word of God preached
[1:11:26] and we can say amen to it but that's
[1:11:28] just the beginning the hard part is
[1:11:33] going home and being able to live that
[1:11:36] that's what really is hard things keep
[1:11:41] that from happening that's what this is
[1:11:43] about it's the other things that are
[1:11:47] mixed inside our hearts they could they
[1:11:51] may not be a love for money
[1:11:52] maybe the cares of this life but mark 4
[1:11:57] verse 19 talks about a third one that's
[1:12:00] not mentioned here in Matthew and he
[1:12:03] describes these thorns as lust of other
[1:12:05] things mark 4 19 if you want to write it
[1:12:08] down the lust of other things entering
[1:12:11] in this could be longings for anything
[1:12:15] leftover beside God that's what that
[1:12:18] means if you look it up there are so
[1:12:21] many things that the devil offers
[1:12:22] believers things that replace time that
[1:12:26] we used to spend with Jesus praying and
[1:12:30] fasting now we pray fast to have more
[1:12:37] time with those other things what about
[1:12:41] the time we used to spend praying with a
[1:12:44] burden not just praying now but also we
[1:12:47] have a we have a burden now something
[1:12:50] that the effectual fervent prayer and
[1:12:52] that's something where we can enter in
[1:12:57] or setting time aside to go out witness
[1:13:04] about cleaning and organizing the church
[1:13:07] helping the ministry or missions or
[1:13:10] supporting the work of the Lord what
[1:13:12] about the time we used to spend doing
[1:13:14] that and it meant something to us but
[1:13:19] now things have been slowly replacing
[1:13:22] that time that we used to spend with
[1:13:24] Jesus and believers are becoming more
[1:13:26] and more lovers of pleasures more than
[1:13:30] lovers of these things more than lovers
[1:13:34] of God instead of living for others and
[1:13:36] Nick Witte is bounding and the love of
[1:13:40] many is waxing cold right we must be
[1:13:43] careful not to let other things in Jesus
[1:13:45] ones first place not second he wants to
[1:13:49] be the Lord of our lives first John
[1:13:51] chapter 2 verse 15 love not the world
[1:13:54] neither the things that are in the world
[1:13:57] If any man love the world the love of
[1:14:00] the father is not in him
[1:14:04] see that's that's you know that's one of
[1:14:08] those hard things that every one of us
[1:14:09] would deny I love God you can't tell me
[1:14:14] different but you love other things
[1:14:19] Jesus is making a statement it's like
[1:14:21] the statement amazed he says if you love
[1:14:23] me keep my Commandments right I can
[1:14:26] still love you without keeping your
[1:14:27] Commandments God because you're so good
[1:14:29] to me see the devil has a way of getting
[1:14:35] us to think contrary to the word for all
[1:14:41] that is in the world is the lust of the
[1:14:46] flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride
[1:14:51] of life it's not of the Father but is of
[1:14:56] the world the pride of life
[1:15:04] the pride of life sound of the father
[1:15:11] it's a wrong spirit and the world
[1:15:16] passeth away and the lust thereof but he
[1:15:19] that doeth the will of God abideth for
[1:15:23] ever and his will is for us to bring
[1:15:28] forth fruit and then our fruit would
[1:15:31] remain amen
[1:15:32] turn with me if you would to John
[1:15:33] chapter 15 God has called us to execute
[1:15:38] his will his word presents to us the
[1:15:41] next step to take so that's why we come
[1:15:44] to church we're here to find out the
[1:15:45] next step to take not the next thing to
[1:15:48] learn nothing not the next revelation
[1:15:52] that's gonna make us feel you know
[1:15:54] puffed up the next step that he wants us
[1:15:58] to take he wants us to go on to
[1:16:01] perfection and bring forth the fruit of
[1:16:04] perfection John 15 verse 1 I am The True
[1:16:08] Vine and ye and my father is the
[1:16:10] husbandman in every branch in me that
[1:16:12] beareth NOT fruit he taketh away in
[1:16:16] every branch that beareth fruit he
[1:16:18] purges it that it may bring forth more
[1:16:20] fruit now ye are clean here it is
[1:16:22] through the word that I've spoken to you
[1:16:24] that this is what washes us today is the
[1:16:28] Word of God
[1:16:28] abide in me and I in you as the branch
[1:16:31] cannot bear fruit of itself except it
[1:16:33] abide in the vine no more can ye except
[1:16:34] ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the
[1:16:37] branches he that abideth in me and I in
[1:16:39] him the same bringeth forth much fruit
[1:16:41] for without me you can do nothing if a
[1:16:47] man abide not in me is cast forth as a
[1:16:49] branch and withered and men gather them
[1:16:51] and cast them into the fire and his
[1:16:52] burned if he invited me and my words
[1:16:54] abide in you ask what you will show be
[1:16:56] done unto you herein is my father
[1:16:58] glorified that you bear much fruit so
[1:17:00] shall you be my disciples now those are
[1:17:02] some really fine scriptures there we see
[1:17:08] the very heart of God think
[1:17:12] for his children in these scriptures he
[1:17:16] isn't happy with us just being his
[1:17:18] children saved and happy do as low as
[1:17:23] possible to get by first God expresses
[1:17:27] that if we're abiding in Christ if we're
[1:17:30] abiding in Christ and were not bearing
[1:17:33] fruit of his word right that he gives us
[1:17:37] then he simply is going to withdraw his
[1:17:41] joy from us you can see that verse 11
[1:17:44] verse 11 if you want to put that up
[1:17:45] there shows that I don't want him to
[1:17:51] withdraw that's my life the joy the Lord
[1:17:55] as your strength so we can be abiding in
[1:18:02] him not bearing fruit God we see God
[1:18:06] wants us to bear fruit all the time not
[1:18:08] just saying the Christian now just say
[1:18:10] I'm in Christ but to bear the fruit
[1:18:13] second God expresses that if we're
[1:18:16] bearing the fruit of the word that he
[1:18:18] gives us then he simply is going to
[1:18:21] purchase some more because his heart
[1:18:27] wants to see more of himself in you he's
[1:18:31] not being unfair and everybody hurts
[1:18:37] when something gets cut off right
[1:18:43] how many who wasn't I think was
[1:18:46] Elizabeth when she was over at the house
[1:18:48] she purged some bushes that were bearing
[1:18:55] good fruit
[1:18:56] she purged him we had another tree that
[1:19:03] just looked like it dices wasn't bare
[1:19:06] anything as a snowball bush and Cheryl
[1:19:08] just cut that faint I like half off and
[1:19:13] now there's there was no growth coming
[1:19:15] in it's in the middle of the summer
[1:19:17] now there's growth coming out everywhere
[1:19:20] god knows what he's doing
[1:19:23] let the word have its way let it wash
[1:19:26] you let it cut off the thing that's
[1:19:30] choking out the word from bringing forth
[1:19:32] life the life of Christ we get so
[1:19:35] involved in these things in the world
[1:19:37] they're choking on us you know some
[1:19:39] people and they look at you they're so
[1:19:41] involved in what you're saying they
[1:19:43] don't even think about Christ now what's
[1:19:45] happening I'll tell you when I go out
[1:19:54] there and I see those bushes I want to
[1:19:56] see life
[1:19:57] I don't want me looking at something
[1:19:58] dead you keep talking about the world
[1:20:01] ain't gonna bring forth life and me yeah
[1:20:04] it's gonna roll in the atmosphere talk
[1:20:08] about something that brings forth life
[1:20:10] talk about how good god is talk about
[1:20:15] what God is doing for you talk about the
[1:20:18] victory you have talk about your healing
[1:20:20] and then talk about the promise you're
[1:20:24] holding on to tell me about your
[1:20:27] expectation think on these things talk
[1:20:35] on these things begin to act on these
[1:20:38] things
[1:20:39] yes God would you exceed me above all
[1:20:42] that we ask or even think of him now
[1:20:47] jesus said ye are clean to the word that
[1:20:50] I've spoken unto you it washes you verse
[1:20:56] already in Christ we've already accepted
[1:20:58] him as our Savior we didn't go out there
[1:21:01] and do some horrible thing but we come
[1:21:05] to church and I want to be washed when
[1:21:07] it come to church I don't want to hurt I
[1:21:10] don't want to hurt I don't don't want to
[1:21:13] suffer don't want to feel pain but in
[1:21:18] all reality the love that God has for us
[1:21:22] is corrective
[1:21:26] you don't want to feel corrected you
[1:21:30] love your hurt you want to feel loved
[1:21:34] you want to feel someone that wants to
[1:21:38] see himself in you and that's all he's
[1:21:41] trying to do yeah and that's the
[1:21:45] attitude that we need to have with the
[1:21:47] word that correction not like you know
[1:21:56] what I mean
[1:22:01] keep the word that he's spoken keep
[1:22:04] abiding in the word you don't want to
[1:22:08] let anything begin to lose fruit and if
[1:22:13] you're bearing good fruit
[1:22:14] you're on victory and you come to church
[1:22:16] and you feel like you got snipped a
[1:22:18] little bit why it's just good enough I'm
[1:22:28] good enough well yeah he's the Potter
[1:22:33] you're the clay he made you to bring
[1:22:37] forth more than you are who are you to
[1:22:40] say he knows he knows what's just you to
[1:22:44] the word learning to lean you know you
[1:22:49] got to be we should sing this song
[1:22:51] willing to lean we're not gonna learn to
[1:22:55] lean on anything if we're not willing to
[1:22:56] lean we gotta be first willing as the
[1:23:04] branch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:23:06] except it abide in the vine no more can
[1:23:09] you accept you abide in me so we have to
[1:23:12] abide in the word I am the vine you are
[1:23:15] the branches he then abideth in me and I
[1:23:16] in him the same bringeth forth much much
[1:23:20] fruit Wow now the reason I'm reading
[1:23:25] this is we're getting an idea of what
[1:23:28] God's heart is for us
[1:23:33] his expectation as the father see his
[1:23:37] children not just happy happy children
[1:23:42] there's nothing in here about happiness
[1:23:44] a lot in here about fruit a lot in here
[1:23:50] about fruit tell me if you're bearing
[1:23:54] the fruit you've been happy that's right
[1:23:56] you'll be happy but the people don't
[1:24:00] have Christ are still looking for
[1:24:02] happiness fruit is what God's interested
[1:24:08] in a fruit is what other people see
[1:24:11] right I'll tell you if it's time to go
[1:24:15] pick apples or cherries we don't want to
[1:24:22] go there and see no fruit on these
[1:24:25] beautiful apple trees right green leaves
[1:24:29] new life springing forth no fruit
[1:24:34] yeah what did Jesus think about that
[1:24:41] fruit he wants to see fruit love joy
[1:24:45] peace longsuffering gentleness meekness
[1:24:47] temperance faith he wants to see you
[1:24:49] bring forth another soul go eat out
[1:24:55] somewhere in your life spend some time
[1:24:58] looking for someone that don't know him
[1:25:02] it's a fruit
[1:25:04] you'll be wise it went so wise hey that
[1:25:11] don't win souls ha's let's look at the
[1:25:20] endgame in verse eight God's endgame
[1:25:23] herein is my father glorified that ye
[1:25:26] bear much fruit so shall ye be my
[1:25:30] disciples he didn't say you're my
[1:25:33] disciples no matter what right you
[1:25:36] accept me a Calvary you're my disciple
[1:25:38] no matter what he didn't say that
[1:25:40] the children of Israel didn't come out
[1:25:42] and say hey look for your disciples we
[1:25:44] came out of Egypt we went through the
[1:25:47] water the rock followed us we all ate
[1:25:49] banana
[1:25:50] we all went to church the pillar fire we
[1:25:52] had all these supernatural experiences
[1:25:54] in her life it's not it
[1:25:59] you got to continue to bear there's
[1:26:03] every time the word comes every time you
[1:26:05] come to church there's a word for you
[1:26:08] yeah and that word now that you receive
[1:26:14] needs to become fluent in your life yeah
[1:26:18] the thing is it cannot and will not if
[1:26:22] there are other things in your life now
[1:26:26] we've heard a lot of sermons you've got
[1:26:27] to believe the word you got a Blee Blee
[1:26:29] Blee Blee and it's true you have to
[1:26:31] believe I'll never happen but you can
[1:26:34] believe and have other things in your
[1:26:36] life and it's just gonna eventually get
[1:26:38] choked out so yes we have to believe but
[1:26:43] we also have to make sure about those
[1:26:44] other things were you thinking about why
[1:26:46] we're here
[1:26:47] and what I'm saying by that is when the
[1:26:50] word is preached see I I don't want to
[1:26:52] know anything in your life please do not
[1:26:55] tell me anything in your life I do not
[1:26:57] want to know but I will love for you to
[1:27:00] come in the maturity to place your heart
[1:27:04] before the word and say Lord if there's
[1:27:07] something there that you want tub with
[1:27:11] right speak through the word and I'll
[1:27:14] know it's you
[1:27:17] that's what it's for it's a personal
[1:27:21] relationship it's not John against you
[1:27:27] John don't know you John don't want to
[1:27:29] know you are you kidding I want God I
[1:27:38] want God have a relationship with me
[1:27:44] don't get bad the messenger he just
[1:27:48] bring in the word and don't get mad
[1:27:54] where the message came from
[1:27:58] because he loves you Bryan wants you to
[1:28:00] bear more fruit man we serve a God who
[1:28:04] has expectations of us much higher than
[1:28:08] we're at that ride is going to be
[1:28:10] without spot or wrinkle or no such thing
[1:28:14] right when she walks others are gonna
[1:28:18] look at her and say I see a difference I
[1:28:21] see a difference in her walk yes not
[1:28:26] just what she wears but I'm talking
[1:28:29] about the ornament of a meek and quiet
[1:28:30] spirit I'm talking about a humility
[1:28:34] she's quote with humility
[1:28:36] it's about giving glory to the Father to
[1:28:39] her husband she doesn't draw attention
[1:28:42] to herself
[1:28:44] Esther never walked in there and said
[1:28:46] look at me
[1:28:50] - she did she acted like she was more
[1:28:54] important than what she was I got proof
[1:28:58] I'm already the Queen so do the
[1:29:01] Pharisees and the Sadducees so do the
[1:29:05] children of Israel when they came out of
[1:29:06] Egypt it's about maintaining the spirit
[1:29:10] that's pleasing to the Lord be humble
[1:29:13] before the Lord let the word have its
[1:29:17] way in your life amen
[1:29:20] well I just want you to know that were
[1:29:24] about 50% done and if we were to waited
[1:29:31] another week and probably were to went
[1:29:34] into a series
[1:29:39] Thorin's have a way of entangling our
[1:29:42] spiritual walk keeping us from bringing
[1:29:46] forth the fruit of the word that we
[1:29:49] heard in the past keeping us from
[1:29:53] walking in the spirit of that word
[1:29:56] thorns that are mixed with the word
[1:30:00] being preached eventually become a
[1:30:03] stronghold in her life yeah
[1:30:06] choke out the light the victory the joy
[1:30:09] working for the Lord a burden for souls
