lord there are so many few in bondage and there's no escape there's no there's no way out but lord you are the way you are the truth the door you're the answer to every this world situation lord we thank you for another opportunity that we could gather together this week and we pray lord that your presence would come in the opening of the word that you would draw us closer to you father that you would feed the bride as only you can do lord may you take control the remainder of the service bless the scriptures that we read the quotes the word that would be spoken may it all be with the inspiration of the holy spirit we'll be careful to give you the honor the praise the glory for all these things now as we submit commit ourselves to you in jesus precious name we pray amen amen while you're remaining standing if we could just read a few scriptures and we'll have you be seated we want to minister on finishing our course finishing our course we started and we thought um brother mark was just going to preach the whole thing during the men's meeting amen starting here with verse number one second timothy chapter four verse number one we'll read through verse eight i charge thee therefore before god and the lord jesus christ who shall judge the quick and the dead at his appearing and his kingdom we're instructed to preach the word to be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all long-suffering amen that's the right spirit and doctrine for the time will come when people will not endure sound doctrine anymore but after their own desires shall they heap to themselves a certain type of preacher that will speak to them exactly what they want to hear and they shall turn their ears from the truth and shall be turned unto fables but watch thou on all things in your afflictions do the work of evangelists make full proof of thy ministry for i am now ready to be offered the time of my departures at hand i have fought a good fight i have finished my course i have kept the faith henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness which the lord the righteous judge shall give me at that day and not to me only but unto us that love is appearing amen god bless you may be seated how many enjoyed the services that we had with brother george smith weren't they wonderful i just wanted to play just a little bit of clip on one of them before i start our message if we could start that that's just because i want to play it doesn't mean we're going to be able to do it i don't get i don't get everything is it ready oh yeah let's do it so when you don't fully understand why brother john chose a certain color for the walls over there i had brother george pick out the color paint i wanted him to be a part of it but he brought a real good point and this point is we don't know everything that's behind what we see and the advice that not brother george gave us but that god gave us through his servant big difference wasn't the opinion of a man it was god speaking to us how we need to conduct ourselves amen just want to finish it when you don't understand an issue or something that's going on be careful it could be part of a bigger picture it's there for a reason or not right and god allows these scenes to play out in order to bring our reactions to the surface be careful god has not called me or any of you to straighten everything out that's right years ago when i was working over the jeffersonville with billy paul you're 75 way back there someplace so i forget what was going on i said you know what billy if i was god i just amen god is in control we have to trust god we know that we all make mistakes on a daily basis so if we're making them that means the others that we're around are going to be making them right what we probably lack a lot is praying one for another that's what we're really lacking that's really what god wants us to do but i really appreciated the message uh that uh brother george brought to us and uh really down to earth just simple but yet profound and this evening we want to talk about finishing our course because we're near the end we're at the coming of the lord and uh we're all in a race and uh we all want to finish the course with a good fight and we want to keep the faith and uh just thinking about that crown of righteousness i don't know but i just i have a thought that everybody's going to have a crown there but it's going to be different of course it's all going to be attached with eternal life but somehow brother branham taught us that every soul is going to be attached to us and i do believe that some of the crowns are going to be brighter than others and um um the more souls that you won i believe you're going to shine like the stars as the bible says and those souls that you win win souls and those souls win souls are going to be attached to your crown but they may be a dimmer light but still attached to your crown do you see and so i want us to get excited about a crown that's bright amen amen and that we have a part to play to get there it's not just oh i hope i make it i'd be honest i don't want to be there with the dull you know my batteries out you know what i mean i want people to know that i worked for the lord that while i was here i did something for the kingdom i won souls because that's all that matters that's what our course is supposed to be when we were born we were born on a course that headed straight to hell we were wild by nature we were just saying and doing anything we wanted to do ephesians 2 verse 2 says where in times past he walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power the heir of the spirit that now worketh in children in the children of disobedience among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of the flesh and fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and were by nature the children of wrath even as others so we were on the course of this world and even though we were fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind we were by nature the children are even as other the bible says we're actually walking according to the course of the prince of the power of the air amen so we thought it was we were doing our will doing our thing but we really weren't right we were doing exactly what satan wanted us to do the thing is he was he was using our desires to get what he wanted right the devil was actually directing our course to the channel of our own will and we didn't know it was right that's why hey whatever you want have a good one whatever it is it's that's the broad way it didn't matter if you went this way or that way you were still doing your will but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us he got our attention and he let us know that we were headed straight to hell and he told us he provided a way for us at calvary amen all we had to do was surrender our will over to god amen repent for our hideous selfish attitude amen and get baptized in the name of jesus christ and start on a new course of life amen this is god's course for our lives now it's vital to get a clear revelation of what this course really is too many people have misinterpreted their course right there are some who keep on living according to their own will and their own desires thinking they're on the course of life jesus expressed that there were two courses that we could take one was a oh it started out with a wide gate a broad way it was easy to travel and you could just do your own will and satan encourages the human race to take it to take that course it's a course that really everybody's started on but but jesus told us that the end of that course is destruction amen and he told us about the correct course for our lives that we have to get off the first one to get on the right one amen and it's a real straight and narrow path and we we've often heard it when people say you're you know you're you've heard you're narrow-minded you need to open up a little bit well many people when you preach the gospel from cover to cover of what it says exactly what we need to do it's looked at as being narrow-minded let's find a church that we can kind of do what we want to do you can see that satan is incur satan is in the churches right it's true god is in his word i remember just being a a kid and god was dealing with my heart and i was trying to find the right church and god said i'm not in the church i'm in my word and i've never never forgotten that satan is allowed to go to church that's why we can sit in church and have all these mind battles what's going on satan is trying to keep us from the word amen now god left us his precious word that we might know the new course of life to follow romans chapter 12 verse 1 says i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your body a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god which is your reasonable service be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of god this is the new course of life for us and god wants us to prove it right to prove around the right course which is the will of god it's not our job it's not our house it's not our vehicle it's not our personal plans for our future it's the will of god amen and we have to present our lives to the will of god for his purpose not for our personal lives now the bare bones reasonable service that's acceptable to god for the new course is to present our body a living sacrifice that's not just come to church twice a week pay your tithes and then do what you want to do unfortunately there's too many that have misinterpreted the course of life that we should be on amen paul had a revelation of his new course of life he helped before he had a real experience with christ he was so puffed up that he wanted to be the absolute best but he learned that he had to forsake it all to gain christ he had to look at himself as to being not the best but the least of all saints amen right as he said paul's new course of life was filled with hardships sufferings afflictions jesus showed him how great things he was going to suffer in his new course of life is that true it seemed like it was really this new course was death in that life because of all the sufferings paul presented his body a living sacrifice to god he had a revelation from jesus what it really meant jesus by revelation i believe told paul to deny himself and to take up his cross daily and follow him in fact he preached it he said i i died daily he must have got the revelation from god amen he didn't say i learned it from any other disciple he said i learned it from no man but i got it from jesus christ himself tell you this even though it's written and it's been preached we need to get in the prayer closet and we need to hear from god ourselves amen amen paul knew the only way that he could that he could save his own life would be to lose it to give it up give it to jesus present it back to god for his eternal purpose on a daily basis not just repent be baptized and then that's all you got to do life has to be changing amen i believe it was this morning early this morning after i got a coffee i was looking at some furniture for the church and i went and looked at it it was used because just trying to save some money and um it was not a good not a good fit for us it was just you rub it and and it was coming off so i knew it was just it was too used i said it was good good deal but not good for us not a good fit for us but as i was leaving i noticed that there was this big tree is about this big in diameter but it was so short it was maybe just from there maybe maybe five feet taller and it just looked odd to me and he said yeah it was about um about 10 years ago it just sprung up on its own and every year i cut it down well it just continued to grow this way instead of that way but if there's the life of christ inside of us we're going to be growing amen amen we're not just going to say i'm in it we've got to grow our life's got to prove it this new course that paul was on it seemed like death but it was really life everywhere he went and everything that he did totally discouraged the flesh it was a decay to the flesh he wrote about in second corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 he says but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god and not of us he says we are troubled on every side so if i go over here there's trouble if i go over here there's trouble if i go over here there's trouble accept it we lived in trouble yet not distressed perplexed but not in despair persecuted but jesus is still with us we're cast down but we're not destroyed always bearing about in our flesh our body the dying of the lord jesus now how how is that how do i how do i bear in my body of the dying of the lord jesus i do not do my will that's how you bear the dying of christ is when you refuse to do your will that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body you can't do your will and god's at the same time now no saint monster wants to get you to believe that but you can't [Music] the only way the life of christ will be manifested in us is when we're willing to die out to our will and it has to be on a daily basis present your body a living sacrifice every day god what would you add me to do don't just say the prayer and then go on with your day don't do that for we which live are always delivered unto the death unto death for jesus sake that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh manifest in our mortal flesh i want jesus in my mortal flesh the only way is when jesus delivers me unto my death he says this is what i want you to do pray keep my commandments uh reach out first so whatever he's asking me to do i've got to die out to what i want to do and just do what he told me to do amen so then here's the conclusion death works in us but life in you see this this this new course of life it seemed like death but it was really life amen that's right what works in the believer death death to our will it's constantly working on a daily basis we can see the new course of life for paul was a crucified lifestyle you've heard about people having such a a good lifestyle right well paul's lifestyle was a crucified lifestyle that's why we can't allow ourselves to become at ease in zion we've got to make that hard choice every day paul said in galatians chapter 2 verse 20 i am crucified with christ amen i am crucified with christ not just christ was crucified for me but i'm there with him nevertheless i live yet not i but christ liveth in me and the life which i'm now living in my flesh i'm living by the faith of the son of god who loved me and he gave himself for me [Music] paul learned to die daily amen to live that crucified life he was following the instructions that christ gave him to to deny himself daily to pick up his cross and follow him think about this we can all testify of of of of something that we did for the lord at some time but what's being presented to us through this gospel is that we should be daily following the lord daily not weekly doing what we should be doing for the lord every day amen it may just be one person that you reach because god knows you got to work right god knows what you got to do but i'm telling you he also knows that you have a heart that wants to please him or you just have a heart to kind of go the way that you want to go [Music] peter said this new course of life was a calling to suffer amen for jesus he did first peter chapter 2 verse 21 for even herein to were you called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we should follow his steps for what i'm going to go to verse 20 now with this so you can kind of catch it for what glory is that when you're buffing it for your own faults and you take it patiently but if when you're doing the right thing you suffer for it and you take it patiently this is the acceptable and perfect will of god for our lives we don't got like brother george we're saying we don't gotta prove straighten everything out let your life be a manifestation amen this new course of life is really a crucified lifestyle think about it we ought to be living a crucified lifestyle here's the beautiful thing about this brother martin we can be full of joy with a crucified lifestyle amen instead of trying to act like we're really something special in our flesh we need to crucify it first corinthians chapter 2 verse 1. first corinthians chapter 2 verse 1 and our brother when i came to you i came not with excellency of speech or of wisdom declaring unto you the testimony of god for i am determined not to know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified amen and i was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling and my speech and my preaching was not with enticing words of man's wisdom but in the demonstration of the spirit and the power that your faith should not stand in the wisdom of men but in the power of god how many seen the power of god ministers sunday amen amen the power of god isn't being slain in the spirit dancing in the spirit that's right that's right it could be but don't put god in the box something inside should have been connecting amen that was the power of god he wasn't speaking with man's wisdom or enticing words he wasn't even trying but he said it like it was can you imagine the great theologian paul who was determined not to know anything save christ died i wonder if his sermons became a little boring yeah right a little repetitious the old same old same old christ and him crucified that that's it's all i know sorry paul not only had a revelation of christ suffered for him but he also had a revelation that he was called to suffer in order for others to be saved as well now what's important about that statement is too often we have what we say a revelation that christ suffered for us who am i i'm not worthy but we have no revelation that that same sacrifice was supposed to be lived out through me to to to another soul it's like we we don't capitalize on that revelation because it's filled with responsibility the first one was god's responsibility remember jesus telling ananias that he was going to show paul how great things he must suffer from my name's sake in his new course of life his new course of life that he was he was on paul's ministry was christ and him crucified amen it wasn't a ministry of sermons preached no sir it was a hard rugged life ministry he never compared his sermons with other ministers other disciples whose was better remember paul talking in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 he said that he labored more abundant than all the other ministers not whose whose sermon was better but who labored more his proof was his stripes he was he had stripes above measure he was in prisons more frequent he was in debts more often it was always about what happened from his ministry it was talking about the results of his ministry what it did what it did towards him and it all was about how much he suffered he was measuring his ministry with other ministers by how much he suffered amen he was beat with rod stone shipwreck in journeyians often in perils of his own countrymen in weariness painfulness watchings often in hunger and thirst and fastings often and cold in nakedness wow all just to get the message out christ died for you that's all i know jesus died for you yeah god gave him an abundance of revelation but you know he never puffed himself up he still preached christ crucified give your heart to god lay down your life for the one who laid down his life for you verse 28 besides those things that are without that which cometh upon me daily and the care of all the churches he said who is weak am i am i not weak who's offended and i burn not if i'm gonna glory in anything in my life it's not gonna be in my sermons about my shermans i will glory of the things which concern my weaknesses my infirmities my sufferings because that's what he called me to do and i'll tell you you want to go get the gospel to somebody it's going to take the height off of you you're going to have to give up your time you're going to give some money you're going to give some reputation you're going to you're going to get turned down and turned down and turned down that's what paul said that's what i'm going to glory in right there that proves that i'm living for god that's proves my ministry not this that and the other second corinthians chapter 12 verse 9 it was all about christ being crucified amen paul wanted the same message lived out in his life that jesus lived out in his i don't know how we could sit under a ministry like this and not give more of yourself to christ you'd have to come become hard to the gospel amen and he said unto me my grace is sufficient for my strength is made perfect in weakness that's right i'm able to get something done in your body when you say i can't do nothing when you're down when you're against the wall you have no ability to go do your will that's when i can come in and become strong in your life because alls i'm wanting you to do my my son my daughter is say i need you lord i can't do it without you that's when he can be strong most gladly therefore well i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me not going out there trying to handle blaze some new trials therefore i take pleasure he said i take pleasure in infirmities we take pleasure and run away from them reproaches man we run the other way in necessities no way i ain't getting myself in the spot right need and persecutions i know when to stay away from not to get persecuted just do a little compromising in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong he pointed people to everything that he suffered because he stood for the for calvary i think if paul was here today he'd be dealing with the same thing doing the same thing during the culvert during the 21st century right i don't think you'd be doing anything different right you know the world they got to spend a whole time compromising with the new new stuff yes sir give me this old-time religion give me this this old way just believing in calvary this new course of life was completely different than paul's old course of life yes in the old course of life we ran away from our problems that weakened us but our new course of life we face our problems we embrace what we have to go through we're not afraid of what god is leading us to he wants us to be a witness he wants us to be a testimony he wants us to manifest a part of christ that other brothers and sisters don't seem to care about they'd rather just say they're a christian without british manifesting it and god wants you god wants you to manifest the word for this hour to stand the test and and and win souls regardless of just how busy and corrupt this world is don't wait for colby to stop don't wait for the next presidency time is running out we need to be christ everybody just jump off the diving board and start telling somebody about jesus this is the hour do not wait we got to finish the course in the new course of life we have learned to embrace the things that once we were scared or afraid of for when i'm weak then i'm strong it's okay for me to get weak it's okay for me to get needy it's okay for me to be without this um reputation amen i don't need a reputation i need christ i need the love of god in my heart remember timothy wasn't really excited about this rugged new course of christianity right he wasn't excited about the things that accompanied a true believer like the many persecutions that follow when you're living a new godly life it'd be better just to kind of hide in the background i'm glad this is in the bible to let me know that the things that timothy went through we can relate amen but paul taught timothy to be a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel to partake of the afflictions not just take the good scriptures that you want to get out of there not just the promises but be a partaker of the afflictions or be a partaker of the new manner of life this new course of life according to the power of god it's a new course of life with a new purpose than we had before before our purpose was just to get whatever we wanted to get out of life and enjoy it and build the future and just have you know so many people love us now the new course of life is we don't care people love us we care that they love jesus that's what we care about because jesus died for me i'm dead i'm in debt to him i'm a prisoner of him i'm bought by him it's no longer about me it's about the one who bought me amen this new course of life is the token on display amen yes it is ii timothy chapter 3 verse 10 but thou has fully known my doctrine do people fully know your doctrine put yourself in here my manner of life nothing about how many times we go to church my manner of life my purpose my faith and my long-suffering my charity my patience my persecutions my afflictions think about how he's trying to identify his manner of life his purpose my persecutions and afflictions which came upon me at anac iconium at lystra what persecutions i endured i mean you could just like magnify them it wasn't some little thing he said they were mighty persecutions that i endured but i love this testimony but out of them all the lord delivered me no you don't have to be afraid of persecutions if you believe god's with you he will deliver you you've got to believe it you don't have to be bothered don't be afraid you have to trust god he'll see you through he will deliver us brother branham conveyed that this new course of life as a christian was a very difficult it was a very hard way it's really you've heard this that when we become a christian we get baptized we repent and we give a heart to god that's when the battle really starts you're right i've read this quote before but i want to read it again because it's in a different subject a different message a man running from the presence of god brother brown said christianity thinking a new course of life now sort of honestly laying the foundation and you know me long foundations quick little thing at the end right christianity is is an every day rugged life living for god in this present world so it didn't stop when covet started when we got the new presidency when we got all the broadway all the bills nope it's an everyday rugged life living for god in this present world right so what is what is the constant what is the constant about this it's a constant burning of the fire and the love of god in the in the heart that's what should be constant no matter what yes i don't care what you're going through i don't care what's happening i don't care i don't care if the tires are flat we lose our job the house burn i don't care what happens there needs to be a constant fire and burning of the love of god in our heart amen now what is it there for so we can just say we're christian no no that sets you a fire and puts you out yonder with people making converts to christ now to me that is the exact same thing that we read in the bible about paul's life amen it's true but it's to us 21st century are we going out do we wake up in the morning i want to go out and get it a convert for christ do we even have those thoughts yeah right do we have that go ye out that's right to me this is the correct course of life right here of a christian life now he uses the word responsibilities in other words it's our responsibility remember brothers in our men's meeting talking about that one word he says but it's easy to go the way the world goes okay it's easy to flow down the stream now that's the first course of life that we were all born with get out there and sit down in the river with your boat you get your oars and start pulling up against the current you don't make much time it goes hard but you just want let loose of those oars and watch how fast you pass the trees going down but look where you're going when things are floating easy he's inside remember you're going towards a great cataract down there remember it leads to destruction jesus said he said of some sort you're going towards the falls and it won't be too long and you're going to go over the falls just floating with the world easy the way it goes he says you don't want to do that no sir he says but you must accept your responsibility so let me just say it like this god has never been a pusher he's a gentleman he said this is my will with this will is a responsibility if you love me keep my commandments it's just there's a responsibility to this now we can get up tomorrow morning and we can take it easy and just wait for the next service or we can get up because we heard from god wednesday night it's your choice but to to god he has given us his responsibility it's up to us whether we want to follow it or not he says in the responsibility that god has given us in this day is to bring this message to bring this message and as i get older and i know my days are shortening up not feel that now right we all think about well when i get covered well that could be it we're we're thinking about our days shortening up don't tell me we're not right brother that's right the whole the whole world isn't we don't have much time to to win a soul for the lord we don't get all the time in the world he says as i get older i know my days are shortening up and i feel the responsibility greater than i've ever felt think about that at the very end when he preached this is this is the last year of his life 1965. more than he ever felt at the end at the end of his course that he was running pressing on we must do it we must get down to it everywhere we go and tell the message and tell the people that jesus is coming amen that he's he's god and he's coming soon and there's no hope left in the world but the coming of the lord amen we must finish our course people have got lazy they've laxed out they've gotten out of the race they never even had a revelation of how to run the race brandon said that these are the responsibilities of a true christian amen every day rugged life making converts to christ amen whoa whoa whoa whoa i want to ask you when's the last time you did that when's the last time you did that brother john it's not about brother john i'm sorry brother john isn't up here i would never ever want to be up here without god ever still never don't even want to be up here but the problem is we think it's brother john we think it's a man talking is it a man was it a man or what was it was it god and brother branham that spoke this it's a hard rugged life making converts to christ well brother john that's not what i signed up for that doesn't sound like joy and peace that was promised to me i say brother and sister the joy and peace that god has promised you comes as a result of doing god's will everybody wants joy and peace that nobody wants to do the will of god i'm talking about the hard things the suffering all that paul went through he had joy and peace yes he did yes amen now how did he have joy and peace when he was suffering all the time because he was in the will of god amen and when you're in the will of god doing the will of god i don't care how much you're suffering there's an internal joy and peace that happens inside of you did not jesus say uh peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you it's a the peace that you get from the world when everything's got to be okay with everybody when they say peace and safety the world goes oh yeah this is great but we know what's going to happen but the bottom could be falling out in your life and you could have peace you can just be wretching in pain and have a joy unspeakable and full of glory because it doesn't come from man it comes from god and god gives it to man [Music] think about it he can he can withhold his joy from anybody he can withhold his peace from anybody and he's able also to make grace abound to the fullness in any man's life it's just who wants to get serious with god amen who who who will dare to believe god is speaking tonight i'm scared i am scared for those who do not see god behind his word because it doesn't matter the vessel it's the word that's what he'll back up if we don't suffer with them we're not going to get to reign with them what is all this suffering for the suffering is to get a soul in it's not just going through a bunch of pain ridiculous hardships for nothing we all the whole world's got that the whole world's suffering but to suffer for the lord how many can testify that you belong to jesus remember just because we've accepted the benefits of calvary doesn't mean that we've accepted the responsibilities of calvary in other words we really belong to god we have no right to do our will if we do it's called rebellion right that's right come on we must finish our course crucified amen we must finish our course crucified lives crucified to our will crucified to our flesh paul said in galatians 5 24 and they that are christ they that belong to christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lust that's right amen amen if we live in this spirit will also let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vainglory let's not be desires of provoking one another let's not be desirous of envying one another in other words we need to embrace the new course of life sure when we accepted jesus into our heart we like made a decision i'm going to crucify this flesh and the affections with the lust but you know you wake up the next day and here comes satan trying to give you a desire so we must remain we must live we must finish our course crucified don't be led astray brother sister always remember that at any time you embrace the old cushy style of life or begin to desire vainglory riches popularity envying having a desire to provoke someone you have opened the door to be led astray right right now the thing is you don't think so but you don't realize it but doesn't the bible say he that looketh in the perfect law of liberty walks away and forget what he read for his life as he goes on monday tuesday that he deceives him own his own self he's the one that brought about being led astray because he already purposed that he didn't have to do it all right all i gotta do is say amen to it so as i say amen you gotta do it can't be a hero of the word only gotta be a that's doer no no this message isn't a real popular message but if there's one bride member here they appreciate it [Laughter] i want to preach to the bride because you know what you cannot make a foolish virgin a bride and it's impossible to take a bride and they become a foolish virgin because every seed is going to bring fourth of its kind and and the seed is this is the seed in the beginning was the word the word was with god and the word was god it will remain when the battle is all over the smoke is settled you will see the words standing there and they that are the word are going to be standing with them amen all we have to do is desire something more than pleasing christ that's all we got to do to be led astray it will open the door to be led astray just wanting anything more than pleasing christ ii peter chapter 2 verse 15. which have forsaken the right way and have gone astray following the way of balaam the son of bolsor have loved the wages of unrighteousness you know satan's got some good wages out there for us so it's easy to be led astray we don't want to be led astray that's why jesus said he then endure to the end amen stay on track as soon as we get a little pride going in this new course of life you've gotten out of favor with god the bible says that god resists the proud and gives grace to the humble so we must keep ourselves crucified this is where i'm going with this there's a purpose for self-crucifixion i mean we i i want a greater revelation that there's nothing good in me [Laughter] i don't care what revelation i got i want to i want it greater i want the iron field taken off a little bit more i want to see how rotten i really am it's our own desire that leads us astray it's not some false doctrine it's not the devil against your will it's the devil uniting with your will that leads you astray it's the devil saying that's what you want i'll give it to you that's what you want i'll give it to you that's what will lead you astray right not some false doctrine right true we don't have to worry about that but we certainly got to worry about our desires james chapter 1 verse 14 every man is tempted when he is drawn away from his own drawn away of his own lust and enticed see how the devil works with our i mean if brother bob purposely didn't pick on you if brother bob had a a problem with having with stealing in a store well it's going to be very hard for the devil to get me to steal because i i just i don't have that desire where bob does where he's going to get me is what what i desire in my flesh so it's not a matter of well let's just preach this this and this what about the thousand things this is where we come to church and we allow god to speak to us god search my heart know my thoughts amen then when lust have conceived it bringeth forth sin and sin when it's finished and bringeth forth death do not air my beloved brethren don't air keep yourself crucified with christ don't be led astray by your wants keep yourself crucified before one another esteem others more than yourself lay down your will lay down your time live for one another find a time that you can get away make a phone call tell somebody you love them get on your knees and pray for them some of you won't call somebody because of your pride some people you won't do it because you got other excuses right i say pray for one another with love and compassion don't be led astray of your own wants the devil's easiest priority job is to give you what you already want no what makes his job hard is when you've laid down your life for christ and you're just out there winning a soul that's your whole mother that's what you're doing your purpose you're laying everything else aside to do that then he's got to go out there and stick some lures out in front of you but if you're not working for the lord and you just got your own believe me you're easy keep yourself crucified brother john why are you pushing it because we got to finish this course that's why first peter chapter five verse eight first peter chapter five verse eight be sober be vigilant this is your job in other words be serious christian because your adversary your real adversary is not your brother it's not your sister it's the devil as a wrong line he's walking about seeking whom he may devour he'll devour somebody that just i so bad wanna go steal easy target let's just go to the store he looks at your desire and he sets the test for you that's why you need to be sober be vigilant amen who resists steadfast in the faith knowing that the same look at this afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world the same what the same crucifying of yourself every christian has to crucify themselves and when you live godly just like all your other brothers and sisters you're going to suffer persecutions right amen we can't get away from it we must remain sober we must remain vigilant we must remain crucified with christ we must take charge of our wants and the best thing i can say to you is psalms 23 the lord is my shepherd i shall not want [Laughter] take charge of your wants want to please him don't allow yourself to be a victim of satan's tactics by giving you what you want romans chapter 6 verse 6. knowing this that our old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin how many has been free from sin amen okay but that's right that's right but notice you're free from sin but you sin every day and you want your flesh wants to sin so understand this cockapur nature we still got to deal with and the way that you deal with it is crucify it daily but because of calvary because of what he did you have power you have power if you yield to god now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that christ knowing that christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death have no more dominion over him for in that he died he died unto sin once calvary just one time but in him that in him that he he liveth he liveth unto god so now he's trying to tell us what kind of attitude to have what kind of direction he says likewise reckon yourself also you're wrecking your also yourselves to be dead indeed onto sin so if you don't look at yourself as look i'm dead understand i'm not going to do my will if you don't reckon yourself like that then you're going to keep uting yourself to the easy path but alive unto god through jesus christ our lord he's telling us that we have control here let not sin therefore reign in your moral body that ye should obey it in the lust thereof neither healed ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness unto sin but yield yourselves unto god as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto god for sin shall not have dominion over you for you're not under the law but under grace there's control that we can take in our lives we can either make excuses or we can say i'm not going to let this happen wherever the soldier your feet shall tread upon that ground i've given you amen as i was with paul as i was with no so shall i be with you you gotta take a stand you gotta fight the good fight of faith don't get lazy don't get lukewarm finish your course you started the race now finish it make a decision for christ to finish it see it through use the talents that god has given you to win a new soul for jesus use your time your compassion your love reach out to somebody your flesh don't want you to help change the course of another soul think about that help change the course of another soul because the souls that are not uh in christ are in their flesh they're heading towards hell and and and some having compassion making a difference the other could care the less make a difference we don't got much time take action in your course to change the course of another soul don't stop working for god don't just think well it's at the end i'm just going to coast in now no you've got to accept your responsibility brother branham said second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 we're winding down we don't have long to go of course i'm considering this with eternity second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new so this is a new course of life that means we're not allowed to do our own thing and this is just a matter of just being honest lord am i pushing my will too much in my life and all things are of god who have reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and has given to us the ministry of reconciliation here is exactly what god gave paul a ministry of reconciliation and this ministry caused him to suffer but it brought life to others amen right and when he talked about how great the ministry was he talked about all the sufferings i love that spirit that was christ and paul and i would recognize that christ in a person today a ministry of reconciliation he was willing to suffer to see somebody else reconciled amen not just to wit that god was in christ reconciling the world unto yourself not imputing their trespasses unto them and has committed unto us the word of reconciliation the word now we can preach the word or we can let our life preach the word didn't brother george say preach the word always absolute have to use some words that's the word of reconciliation what attracts people you hear people talk all the time and that don't attract them but when they see you lay down your life when they see you turn their their cheek and they still when they see somebody still loves them regardless of how they're treated only god can do that man can't do that now then verse 20 we are ambassadors not for send the light not for brother branham but for christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ said be reconciled to god that should be our motive when we get up in the morning lord use me to reconcile somebody you want to finish the course not just well yeah i made it to the end i'm sorry do something with your course we know through the parables that jesus gave that we got to give an account amen we need to use our talents we need to we need to bring more to him than what we started out with he expects us to bring more to him than what we started out with and i'll tell you if i come up short i want to die trying i want to die trying i do not want to face god as a coward i don't know what's happening here but more than likely it's this well-used thing in my pocket we have another one awaiting us praise the lord things are uh we're gonna get a fire uh inspection tomorrow and and after that is just the final inspection and things are looking really really good turn with me if you would acts chapter 20. just got two more scriptures just a couple more scriptures i want to read this is one that brother mark brought up and he said would anybody like to read this scripture and i said not me i'll be reading it later and now behold paul says i want to follow paul's example who stayed the course stayed working to the very end and he didn't care about the persecutions that got in his way he kept going he just kept his eyes focused and now behold i go bound in the spirit unto jerusalem not knowing the things that shall befall me there say that the holy spirit witness in every city saying that bonds and afflictions abide me he didn't know what was going to happen the only thing he knew is that he was going to be suffering he had that revelation from the beginning paul said i suffer as an evil doer he said in second timothy chapter 2 verse 10 don't turn there he said i endure all things for the elect's sake his whole motive of suffering was to see a soul saved the elect the elect not the foolish virgin the elect i wonder how many is like interested in getting to the elect i endure all things for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory and verse 12 if we suffer we shall reign with him but if we deny him deny suffering right because the first one says if we if we suffer we're going to reign so if we deny suffering he will he also will deny us think about that how in the world could god tell brother branham tell us through paul through the word through the message that this is the way and let us get off on a flowery bed of ease it just wouldn't be fair it would not be fair all right verse 24 back to acts there but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself why paul why why why why why so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received of the lord jesus to testify the gospel of the grace of god paul wanted to finish his course strong he wanted to finish it with joy he wanted to finish it he didn't have that well you know i've done so much for the lord no let me go i want to my life i want to witness some more of the resurrection of jesus christ that he was crucified and risen again inside of me amen his life wasn't dear to him how about you have you been moved away from the ministry paul wanted to finish his course with joy in the ministry which he had received of jesus have you counted your time and your resources and your personal life dear unto you paul didn't have your thoughts been to finish the course with the same joy that was set before paul and the same joy that was set before the lord how are you planning to finish your course that's my question to you today the last verse hebrews chapter 12 verse 1 paul knew that heaven was watching him is he going to be willing to go to jerusalem is he going to go there and be a witness be be the testimony or is he going to be afraid even when satan got into the other brothers and sisters and said don't go don't go don't go they're gonna kill you he says what do you mean to break my heart right amen i'm not only willing to go but i'm willing to die for my lord so i want to say how are you going to finish the course are you just going to take it easy and just try to stay in church stay in the message won't you challenge yourself i know you want a message that says you're doing really good praise god you're doing good you got it now i got a message for you also how are you going to finish your course hebrews chapter 12 verse 1. wherefore seeing we also we also not just paul we also are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses what should we do just say yeah they're watching us yeah they're watching us no that's not what the writer says the writer says let us lay aside every weight and the unbelief of what's being preached to us lay it aside and every sin which does so easily so easily besets us gets us out of the race and let us run with patience the race that is set before us the hardest thing is to get up and do it again it's easy to go do something for christ right now the hardest harder things get up and do it again get up and do it again and get up and do it again that's what the patience is needed for looking unto jesus now this is what we need to do the alternate finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him he endured the cross the joy was set before he knew someone was going to be helped this should be what gives us joy when we give up our time our money our talents our resources everything that we have just to see one soul it's worth ten thousand worlds right amen for the joy that set before me endure the cross despising the shame and set down the right hand to the throne of god for consider him consider jesus that endured such contradiction of sinners against himself lest you be weary and faint in your mind in other words you're not the only one that's in a battle right you're not the only one that's going through this we're all in a race we all have a course we all have uh hardships we all have battles but we got to keep our eyes on a soul because i'm telling you if you're looking at jesus jesus is going to be telling even from the cross son behold my mother mother behold the son he's going to be leading you to help somebody so look to the author and finish your faith if you keep your eyes on jesus you will be helping us you will be living for us because the prophet god sent a prophet in this hour and he told us what real eternal life was it wasn't something we were just going to see on the other side it's something that was demonstrated and lived on this side not living for others over there living for others here and i'll tell you let your relationship be so sweet with jesus that you don't have to wait for somebody to ask you to do something you get in that prayer closet you feel this burden that's how god works i haven't felt that in a while brother john just keep praying keep praying it will come he's just looking for somebody that will yield amen let's stand together god bless you that little chorus that or song that brother mark had led us in must jesus bear the cross alone was that not a perfect song for this message a preparation must jesus bear the cross alone i to be honest with you even if he did i wouldn't want him to i feel in debt i i feel like i just want to help carry the cross now of course if i was there literally when it was happening i would want to be one but i wasn't but i can still do it today i can do it today by bringing the crucifixion of christ to some soul that just looks at it as some story and how that can change a person's life amen let's sing god is god is so good god is so good god is so good god is so good [Music] god is so good he's so good to me god is so good one more time god is so good think about his goodness god is so good god is so good he's so good to me amen as she continues to play that i just want you to think about god's goodness in your life the grace that is raw in your life another day of life when i wake up in the morning unlike you i thank god for the day of life that i have that i've awakened and i got breath and that there's a desire deep inside to to serve them god is so good to us saints he's just calling us to finish this course the way that he he planned us to finish it the way that he wants all the elect to finish it pressing in for the eternal purpose of winning getting the rest of the family of god inside i want god to bless you with jews in your crown with testimonies of all the suffering that you've been through to win some soul i want to hear that testimony it just blesses me so much to know that you're willing to suffer for jesus many are not but i believe his bride is just think on god's goodness we go to him in prayer our grace is heavenly father we thank you for all that you've done for us we thank you one day when we were in the middle of sin on the on the course that led right to hell right to destruction you sent somebody by our way to let us know about calvary that calvary could change our life that you could change our life to come into our our very nature [Music] lord we thank you for that day we thank you for directing somebody by the holy spirit whether they knew it or not to come by us and to call us from a world of sin give us a ministry just like they had to keep the torch going to show our gratefulness to you lord lord we heard this message tonight that you gave us [Music] that you gave us lord [Music] yes lord you put thoughts in my mind before i ever got here i wrote them in on a piece of paper [Music] but lord we believe it was your mind and your thoughts for this hour lord we want to finish the course and i pray that you would give each and every one of us a greater determination to accept our responsibilities lord that you've laid before us tonight let us leave here united with your word united with the holy ghost united with the spirit in which this message was brought forth and god i pray that you would reveal to each and every one of us individually what it is that you'd have us to do where you'd have us to go and until lord until some soul is won through these vessels may there be a constant burning of the fire of god and the love of god in our heart longing to make a convert for you lord i want that description of a christian in my life we commit ourself to you we give you ourselves lord we place ourselves into your hands not only for your safe keeping but for your use lord in the precious name of jesus christ we thank you for these things amen thank you lord all i see and when you are on this child your grace abounds to me oh lord please light the fire that once burn bright and clear replace the lamp of my first love that burns with holy fear oh lord you're beautiful your faith is all i see for when your eyes are on this child your grace abounds to me one more time the second verse lord please light the fire think about what brother bran said that once burn bright and clear replace the lamp of my first love that burns with holy fear amen may that be our prayer every day when we get up in the morning lord let that first love be there in my life it can easily leave it left the first church left the first church age it can certainly leave us and you know it's there when you want to get jesus to somebody it's an automatic right you know you're in the will of mission work is always in the will of the lord amen if you don't take anything i said tonight take everything that brother george said sunday i can say that we're hearing from the lord amen god be with you and bless you and keep you and be dismissed in a word of prayer let's continue to pray for all the requests that was uh spoken to us and that that's been on our telegram and for brother bruce and sister down their travels for the funerals for the celebrations amen and for the hurt of the loved ones that are still dealing with that absence that's something that only god can fill that boy amen goodness our our brother marty if you would to close the service in prayer
