[35:51] from Genesis chapter
[35:55] 28
[35:57] and start with verse 10 is it wonderful
[36:00] to be in the house of the Lord in the
[36:01] middle of the week man there's uh you
[36:03] know just we know that these
[36:05] opportunities we shouldn't take for
[36:07] granted we just have to think a few
[36:08] years ago when doors were closed and
[36:11] circumstances were such where we
[36:12] couldn't gather so when we have times
[36:14] like this I think we should just uh
[36:16] really really enjoy it really appreciate
[36:18] it and just grateful to be able to come
[36:20] to a midweek service I think they're
[36:22] getting rare and rare used to be that uh
[36:25] remember when I grew up playing Sports
[36:27] they didn't have practice or games on
[36:28] Wednesday night because they just
[36:29] expected you to go to church nowadays it
[36:32] sounds like practice games every day of
[36:34] the week including Wednesdays and
[36:36] Sundays and so a midweek service is
[36:38] getting rare and rarer so I'm just
[36:40] really really glad that we could be here
[36:42] in the middle of the week to fellowship
[36:43] with one another and fellowship around
[36:45] the things of the
[36:46] Lord Genesis chapter 28 verse 10 it says
[36:50] and Jacob went out from beeba and went
[36:53] toward Heron he lifted up a certain
[36:56] place and carried there all night
[36:57] because the sun was set and he took up
[36:59] the stones of that place and put them
[37:01] for his pillows and laay down in that
[37:03] place to sleep and he dreamed Behold a
[37:07] ladder set up on the earth and the top
[37:09] of it reached to heaven and behold the
[37:11] angels of God ascending and descending
[37:13] on it behold the Lord stood above it and
[37:16] said I am the Lord God of Abraham thy
[37:18] father and the god of Isaac the land
[37:20] were on thou liest to thee will I give
[37:22] it and to thy seed and thy seed shall be
[37:25] as the dust of the Earth Thou shalt
[37:27] spread AB abroad to the west and to the
[37:29] East and to the north and to the South
[37:31] and in thee and in thy seed shall all
[37:34] the families of the earth be blessed
[37:37] behold I am with thee and will keep thee
[37:39] in all places whether thou goest and
[37:42] will bring thee again into this land for
[37:44] I will not leave thee until I have done
[37:46] that which I have spoken to thee of and
[37:49] Jacob awake out of his sleep and he said
[37:51] surely the Lord is in this place and I
[37:55] knew it not and he was afraid and said
[37:57] how Dreadful is this place this is none
[38:00] other but the house of God and this is
[38:03] the Gate of Heaven amen we'll just stop
[38:06] there you can be
[38:09] seated I want to give my my title as the
[38:13] Gates of Heaven and I I wrote down just
[38:16] a little note here so I'll mention it
[38:17] now because I meant forgot to mention it
[38:19] on on Sunday I just really am impressed
[38:23] with the library you all have I don't
[38:24] know if if anybody goes back there and
[38:26] sees but I went back there you've got
[38:28] church age books you got Seven Seals
[38:30] books got all sorts of books and I I
[38:33] thought man what a I appreciate brother
[38:35] John you making the effort to see that
[38:36] you you have these I know they're
[38:38] available digitally but um if any of
[38:41] these young people haven't read a church
[38:42] age book or if there's books that you
[38:44] you're looking for want they're
[38:46] available and so I just wanted to
[38:48] encourage you all got a great Library
[38:49] use it support it um those books aren't
[38:52] cheap we appreciate those who are still
[38:54] printing them and all the work we do to
[38:56] get them message out it would be a shame
[38:58] if we spend thousands and tens of
[39:00] thousands maybe millions of dollars
[39:01] getting the message out overseas and
[39:03] what we just lose our appreciation of we
[39:05] here and we're not feeding it the same
[39:07] here so brother John I really appreciate
[39:08] your burden and missions the care that
[39:11] you give over over this church it may
[39:12] not be readily noticed um I'm just going
[39:15] to say this personally I was an
[39:17] associate pastor for many years and uh
[39:20] and it's you know it's one office maybe
[39:22] close to almost 15 years being an
[39:23] associate pastor but as soon as I became
[39:25] a pastor I felt like I owed an apology
[39:27] to every Pastor I ever knew because you
[39:29] just don't know what goes into it you
[39:31] don't know what it feels like and you
[39:32] don't know what's demanded of it so but
[39:34] John you're a uh you're an example
[39:37] Pastor example father an example husband
[39:39] you do a tremendous job and I hope that
[39:41] you all notice just what great care your
[39:43] Shepherd gives over you here and just
[39:45] all the things he provides and things he
[39:46] looks out after you're tremendously
[39:49] blessed I I wish gives me something to
[39:51] Aspire to with our own church back home
[39:53] so wanted to say that uh Sunday and I
[39:56] forgot so we love you brother John very
[39:57] very much just so glad to be here and we
[39:59] love sister Cheryl too very very much I
[40:03] have a song maybe we'll sing later but
[40:04] we'll I'm just making her
[40:07] nervous but uh if you want to look again
[40:09] just to our text I want to bring the I
[40:11] want to take this called the Gates of
[40:14] Heaven and we're drawing it from there
[40:16] in verse 17 and let's just let's just
[40:18] look back at this I want to keep reading
[40:20] a little bit more in verse 16 and Jacob
[40:22] awake out of his sleep and he said
[40:24] surely the Lord is in this place and I
[40:27] knew it not he kind of suggesting that
[40:29] he arrived at this place uh and since
[40:33] the sun was going down he needed to to
[40:35] rest and it's kind almost like my
[40:37] circumstance I I needed to stop and I
[40:39] needed to no longer continue in my
[40:41] journey and I made myself a bed and I
[40:43] fell asleep and he's like this was God
[40:45] was here this whole time and I didn't
[40:48] realize it that's kind of how he phrases
[40:49] it Sur the Lord is in this place and I
[40:51] knew it not except that he appears to
[40:53] him in a dream God says I'm with you and
[40:55] he sees this this uh latter come down
[40:57] out of Heaven he sees Angels uh
[41:00] ascending the angels of God ascending
[41:02] and descending so this was quite a
[41:04] experience for him in this dream and
[41:06] this is how he characterizes where he
[41:08] was and he was afraid and said how
[41:11] Dreadful is this place and not maybe as
[41:13] a terror in that you're you fear for
[41:15] your life but just in the awe and the
[41:18] reverence that one would have to have
[41:19] for this place he said this is none
[41:22] other but the house of God and this is
[41:26] the Gate of Heaven that's that's quite a
[41:28] statement I think when he makes that
[41:30] statement here he is on Earth this is a
[41:31] place where he just slept during the
[41:32] night it's just a place there as he's
[41:35] journeying uh from be from berseba
[41:37] toward haran and as he's in this journey
[41:40] in this maybe we could say just a random
[41:42] place it wasn't like he was Googling a
[41:45] lodging and found a halfway point and
[41:47] decided to stay there he happens here
[41:49] and he says this is the house of God in
[41:51] the Gate of Heaven I want to come back
[41:53] to that here in a moment but let's just
[41:54] keep reading to verse 22 and Jacob rose
[41:57] up early in the morning and took the
[41:58] stone that he had put for his pillows
[42:00] and he set it up for a pillar and poured
[42:03] oil upon the top of it so here's this
[42:05] image as he builds up this pillar and he
[42:08] pours oil on it he's he's stacking these
[42:10] things it's a commemoration it's a
[42:12] memorial of what God has done and he
[42:14] pours the oil upon it and it's called a
[42:16] pillar he sets something up it's going
[42:18] to rise up from the Earth to signify
[42:21] this place he says and he called the
[42:22] name of that place bethl the name of the
[42:25] city was called L at the first Jacob
[42:28] vowed a vow saying if God will be with
[42:31] me and will keep me in this way that I
[42:33] go and give me bread to eat and
[42:35] reignment to put on so that I come again
[42:37] to my father's house in peace then shall
[42:39] the Lord be my God now he's not
[42:42] necessarily inventing a standard or
[42:44] qualifying it well if God will do this
[42:46] then he's my God he's really just
[42:47] repeating what God said he would do and
[42:50] so God said he would do something and
[42:51] he's saying the go the one that says
[42:53] he'll do it and does it to him is God
[42:55] the one that keeps his word and he says
[42:58] and this Stone which I have set for a
[43:00] pillar shall be God's house and all that
[43:03] thou shalt give me I will surely give
[43:05] the tenth unto thee so there's quite
[43:08] quite a bit that's just in this
[43:10] particular passage where Jacob's dream
[43:11] and then his vow to God and he said this
[43:14] Stone now this pillar that he erected he
[43:17] says this shall be God's house quite a
[43:19] statement this shall be God's house he
[43:21] said earlier this is the house of God
[43:23] now he says this shall be God's house
[43:25] it's a place he's clearly wanting to
[43:26] identify with Elohim a place he's
[43:29] identifying with Jehovah and call it
[43:32] God's house this isn't the place that
[43:34] God hangs out this isn't the place where
[43:36] he comes by every once in a while but he
[43:38] say this is where God dwells and to use
[43:41] that phrase God's house this is even
[43:43] before the Tabernacle in the wilderness
[43:45] this is before the temple this is before
[43:47] God said build me a place and the place
[43:50] where I put my name there behind the
[43:52] veil in the holiest of holies will I
[43:54] dwell and where the shikina glory will
[43:56] be uh this is before those things but
[43:58] yet it has the same idea when Jacob's
[44:00] like this is none other than the
[44:02] habitation of God I I went to sleep here
[44:05] not knowing that God was here and in the
[44:07] night he visits me and he's with me and
[44:09] I see these Supernatural things and so
[44:12] he said this is a place where God is Not
[44:15] only welcome but it's where he lives
[44:16] it's where he resides that's what's
[44:18] striking him in this moment and then he
[44:20] says this is the Gate of Heaven I'm
[44:23] wanted just to amplify that tonight I
[44:24] think it's such a wonderful phrase
[44:27] but as Jacob experienced uh this dream
[44:29] and the supernatural he says this is the
[44:31] Gate of Heaven I want you to think of it
[44:34] as a meeting place on Earth where Heaven
[44:37] came down it was a meeting place where
[44:39] the natural meets Supernatural here
[44:42] Jacob's going to sleep he's going to
[44:43] make uh some rocks his pillows uh he's
[44:45] obviously getting natural rest because
[44:47] he's in a natural body but now in the
[44:49] midst of all that he has a supernatural
[44:51] experience and so he say this is a a
[44:53] natural place a normal place this is I
[44:56] picked it as a good spot to lay my head
[44:58] but this is a place where God could come
[45:00] down this is the place where I could
[45:02] have a vision of Heaven this is a place
[45:04] where angels are ascending and
[45:06] descending so he say this is a place
[45:08] where Heaven and Earth are meeting and
[45:10] the natural can experience the
[45:11] Supernatural and come into contact the
[45:14] Earthly can come in contact with the
[45:16] Heavenly how many calls it a gate the
[45:18] gate refers to an entrance and it's more
[45:21] than that and I'm going to use some
[45:22] scriptures tonight to kind of lay some
[45:24] things out there and as I look out
[45:26] tonight think everyone who's here
[45:27] tonight's heard me preach before so we
[45:28] just kind of all relax and you kind of
[45:30] know how I work it takes me a while to
[45:32] get going and I'm still learning how to
[45:33] preach and so you guys are just real
[45:35] patient with me like we've been hearing
[45:37] him for over 20 years now just hold on
[45:40] he'll get there eventually so you'll
[45:41] just stay with me but the gate it refers
[45:44] to an entrance and we would recognize
[45:46] that where a gate denotes where you
[45:48] would come into a place but it means
[45:50] more than that it's also a meeting place
[45:52] this is the ideas behind the name a
[45:54] meeting place and and it's also a place
[45:56] of authority a place of judging let's
[45:59] just look at a few scriptures as we
[46:00] consider what Gates represent or these G
[46:03] this Gate of Heaven in Psalms 24:7 it
[46:07] says lift up your heads oh ye gates and
[46:10] be Li be ye lift up ye Everlasting doors
[46:13] and the king of glory shall come in so
[46:15] there's where it speaks of an entrance
[46:17] where the gates are going to be lifted
[46:18] up and the doors are going to lift up
[46:21] and it's a it's a welcoming an opening
[46:24] and the gates would be since it's an
[46:26] entrance point in a lot of ways you
[46:28] could say it was the kind of the first
[46:30] impression of the city so it would it
[46:32] would kind of declare the glory of the
[46:34] city we can maybe say that if you just
[46:36] kind of walked we're kind of traveling
[46:38] and you saw this kind of raggedy wall
[46:40] and a broken down gate you'd say well
[46:42] what kind of city is this and uh maybe
[46:44] it wouldn't seem like there's much
[46:45] behind it because it's not much
[46:47] fortification not much watching but the
[46:50] so the gates will represent the Grande
[46:52] the power and the beauty and the glory
[46:54] of a city it's one of the things that
[46:56] God used describes the New Jerusalem it
[46:58] speaks of the gates being made of a
[47:00] single Pearl and so the Grandeur and the
[47:03] glory and the honor of a city is
[47:05] represented in the gates then in
[47:08] Proverbs chapter 31 verse 23 it speaking
[47:11] of this virtuous woman and her husband
[47:13] says her husband is known in the gates
[47:16] where he sth among the Elders of the
[47:18] land so it's kind of speaking of how
[47:21] this husband is in this rightful place
[47:23] of honor and to sit in the gates is a
[47:26] place of respect and it is uh he's there
[47:30] in a where he sits with the elders so
[47:32] it's a place of power and a place of
[47:33] judgment place where business was
[47:35] conducted you'd go to the gates to
[47:37] adjudicate something you'd go to the
[47:39] gates to deliberate and to make
[47:41] decisions and we find in the book of of
[47:44] of Ruth where they go to the gates to
[47:47] determine the near Kinsman whether or
[47:49] not he would want to uh take the land
[47:51] and so there's a lot of it's a place
[47:52] where judgments dispensed and decisions
[47:54] are made and things are declared the
[47:56] Bible even speaks about a man whose
[47:58] quiver is full and blesses a man who has
[48:00] these sons who will stand with him in
[48:02] the gates Amen in Proverbs chap 22:22 it
[48:06] says Rob not the poor because he is poor
[48:09] neither oppress The Afflicted in the
[48:12] gate why why does it speak of in the
[48:14] gate it doesn't mean that you can do it
[48:16] everywhere else except in the gate so
[48:17] the poor is just always trying to run to
[48:19] get to the gate so he won't Rob them but
[48:21] it means that where you're judging where
[48:23] you're making determinations and you're
[48:25] assessing the needs of the poor you're
[48:26] judging the poor it's it's a place where
[48:28] judgment Goes Forth correction is given
[48:31] in the gate if if you are we are to take
[48:35] a lot of different things we know in the
[48:37] Old Testament says you shall possess the
[48:38] gates of your enemy mentioned over and
[48:40] over again if you possess the gates you
[48:43] possess the city you control control the
[48:45] coming in the going out you control the
[48:48] city you control the economics you
[48:49] control the the comers so you possess
[48:52] the gates you possess the city this is
[48:54] what is represented in the gates are you
[48:56] thinking about this think about this
[48:58] with me a gate is a place of entrance it
[49:01] represents the glory of a city it's a
[49:03] place of power and Justice and judgment
[49:05] says in Zechariah 8:16 these are the
[49:08] things that ye shall do speak ye every
[49:11] man the truth to his neighbor execute
[49:14] the Judgment of Truth and peace in your
[49:17] Gates so Gates is a place where things
[49:20] are announced things are declared things
[49:22] are deliberated business is conducted
[49:24] judgment Goes Forth opinions are giv
[49:26] decisions are made so it says execute
[49:29] the Judgment of Truth and peace in your
[49:31] Gates so a gate properly is a place
[49:34] where truth should be found it's a place
[49:36] where righteousness should go forth a
[49:38] place where peace is found not a place
[49:40] of warfare uh it's a place where the
[49:42] gates should be possessed so that there
[49:44] can be a place of judgment and
[49:46] righteousness and peace if there was
[49:48] always constant turmoil and and fighting
[49:50] in the gates that would be a city under
[49:52] siege a city under ATT attack but it
[49:54] says a catch execute the Judgment of
[49:57] Truth and peace in your Gates that's the
[49:59] gates are a place where truth Goes Forth
[50:02] Amen in Matthew chapter 16: 18 you're
[50:05] all familiar just with a larger context
[50:07] to this it's Peter who do you say that I
[50:09] am Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[50:11] Living God and it says Flesh and Blood
[50:12] hath not revealed this to you but my
[50:14] Father which is in heaven hath revealed
[50:16] this unto you and in verse 18 and I say
[50:18] also unto thee that thou art Peter which
[50:21] means rock or stone and Upon This Rock I
[50:24] will build my church and that rock we
[50:26] know is the revelation of Jesus Christ
[50:29] and even in it Peter is a stone says
[50:31] they call you Peter so Peter is a stone
[50:33] in that church he's part of it he's he's
[50:35] a living Stone and the and the church is
[50:39] the the house of God there's a lot
[50:40] that's been in this Upon This Rock of
[50:42] Revelation I will build my church Stone
[50:44] upon Stone I'm going to build it up says
[50:46] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[50:49] against it amen as I've titled this the
[50:51] Gates of Heaven we find if there's Gates
[50:54] of Hell there got there has to be Gates
[50:56] of Heaven and when it speaks of the
[50:58] Gates of Hell to a to a Jew I've just
[51:00] been reading in different places how the
[51:02] Jews had some sades that there's three
[51:04] gates of hell uh one in the I think the
[51:06] land one in the sea and one in Jerusalem
[51:08] so it would show that this this place of
[51:10] power this place of attack to the gates
[51:13] of hell it's the strength of hell
[51:15] because it's the court of hell it's the
[51:18] uh it's the place where his SK the
[51:19] schemes of Satan are where his
[51:20] instruments his plots his strategy go
[51:22] forth if Satan has a kingdom it's
[51:25] through those Gates that he makes his
[51:27] attack it's through those Gates that he
[51:29] he's going to enter into our realm and
[51:31] enter into our lives and try to fight us
[51:33] so the gates of hell it's a place of
[51:35] power place of tactics a place of
[51:38] strategy and so the Gates of Hell shall
[51:40] not Prevail against this Revelation
[51:42] shall not Prevail against Peter shall
[51:44] not Prevail against the church the gates
[51:46] of hell then are the powers of hell so
[51:49] when we look at the Gate of Heaven
[51:51] speaks of the power of Heaven Jacob if I
[51:54] could put it this way he found in his
[51:56] own words the house of God this is the
[51:58] Gate of Heaven he said I found heaven on
[52:01] Earth I I didn't have to leave Earth I
[52:04] found it on Earth and I'll maybe just
[52:07] share this with you since we just feel
[52:08] at home and so comfortable last year we
[52:11] we preached a number of services at our
[52:13] church on the kingdom and kind of the
[52:15] way it was inspired is reading about the
[52:17] life of Paul and realizing that Paul uh
[52:20] as a Jew and bringing this from the Old
[52:23] Testament he wasn't trying to create
[52:25] this idea that one day we're all just
[52:26] going to go to heaven but the disciples
[52:29] and the Jews looked for heaven to be
[52:31] established on Earth that the kingdom
[52:33] was to be on earth and it's kind of like
[52:35] a Catholic con construct to where we
[52:38] divide Heaven and Hell and you're just
[52:40] kind of making your decision on Earth
[52:41] where you want to spend eternity you're
[52:43] either going to spend it in hell you're
[52:44] going to spend it in heaven and it it
[52:46] kind of loses sight of the fact that one
[52:48] day we're coming back to this earth to
[52:49] spend eternity and that really what God
[52:52] was always aiming for is his kingdom to
[52:55] be be established on Earth it wasn't
[52:57] just oh I just want to go to heaven I
[52:58] just want to go to heaven I just want to
[52:59] go to heaven but Heaven Come Down Heaven
[53:02] let the kingdom be established in Earth
[53:05] so to the Jews and the apostles and Paul
[53:08] they were looking for the kingdom to be
[53:10] established on Earth not just get out of
[53:11] here and get to heaven because really if
[53:14] if you look at it that way if the goal
[53:15] was just to get to heaven that could get
[53:18] kind of scary wouldn't it because we we
[53:20] would be only concerned about ending
[53:22] this life want you catch this and chew
[53:24] on it the goal would be to end this life
[53:27] not live
[53:28] it and that's that's the danger of all
[53:31] which just when we get to heaven I just
[53:32] want to go to heaven I just want to go
[53:33] to heaven that that misses the reality
[53:36] that God's desire is to be expressed
[53:39] here on Earth the kingdom to be
[53:41] established in Earth and so when we look
[53:44] at this Jacob is saying I found heaven
[53:46] on Earth to youe that's what they're
[53:47] looking for they're looking for the
[53:49] Kingdom on Earth the the the when
[53:51] Abraham was looking for a city whose uh
[53:53] Builder and maker was God he wasn't
[53:55] talking about building a rocket ship
[53:57] wasn't trying to find some way to travel
[53:59] uh through Dimensions he he looked for
[54:01] it on Earth and so Jacob had found
[54:04] heaven on Earth he calls it beel or
[54:07] bethl which is the house of God it comes
[54:10] from the the two Hebrew words Beth which
[54:13] is house and L which is God called a
[54:16] house of God is he's speaking of a
[54:18] consecrated place to him it was a sacred
[54:21] meeting place and I want you to think of
[54:24] it where he says
[54:25] maybe I could say it this way we think
[54:27] of the house of God and we think of
[54:28] church H and what we what do we do we
[54:30] kind of come and go and and we meet here
[54:33] and then we don't meet here and if
[54:34] there's not service maybe we just think
[54:35] it's just a building that's not what
[54:37] Jacob was thinking he's thinking a
[54:39] consecrated place a sacred meeting place
[54:42] where you can expect to see God or meet
[54:44] God so when he takes a stone and he
[54:46] wrecks these stones and he sets this
[54:48] pillar up and he anoints it with oil it
[54:50] was the act of dedicating this place he
[54:53] was wanting to set it up as a sign that
[54:55] that there would be a memorial that this
[54:57] is the house of God I'm going to take a
[54:59] pillar and I'm going to anoint it with
[55:00] oil and anointing it with oil I'm
[55:02] consecrating this place as a Dwelling
[55:06] Place of
[55:07] God and in this and and I hope I could
[55:10] just bring this out uh with so much that
[55:12] I have maybe here before me and with the
[55:15] with the pull on the word here and just
[55:16] the ease with which we can Minister
[55:18] sometimes we just get maybe too too long
[55:20] and we get caught up in some of the
[55:21] details so you'll have to amen and pull
[55:23] me through this
[55:25] in this image of him saying this is
[55:28] bethl I'm going to erect a pillar I'm
[55:30] going to build up this Stone I'm going
[55:32] to anoint it with oil and this is the
[55:34] dwelling place of God this is quite an
[55:37] image and in this image we can see the
[55:39] picture of the house of the Lord in all
[55:41] its different applications Amen in more
[55:44] than just one not just in a temporary
[55:46] meeting place as we might think Jacob
[55:48] found it but when he says house and even
[55:50] this Hebrew word Beth house it it can
[55:53] refer to the human body
[55:55] very word bth it be it speaks of the
[55:59] human body but then it also is the same
[56:00] word that's used of a dwelling place we
[56:02] might say a home or a house that which
[56:05] contains a family and it can also be
[56:07] used and it's used of the temple that
[56:09] very word Beth in the Hebrew is used of
[56:12] a human body it's used of a human's home
[56:15] and it's also used of the Temple and so
[56:18] what I want to kind of express to you
[56:20] tonight just the moments that we have
[56:22] together and I believe these moments are
[56:24] worth every every bit is to consider
[56:26] your body your house and this church as
[56:30] the Gates of
[56:32] Heaven and if this isn't your church I
[56:34] would say then your body your your house
[56:37] where you dwell and your church where
[56:39] you attend to think of them as the Gates
[56:42] of
[56:43] Heaven I I've bitten off a lot I'm not
[56:46] going to try to chew it all but we'll
[56:47] just taste it but in 1 Corinthians
[56:50] chapter 6:9 this is just a very quick
[56:52] glance at look considering your body
[56:55] as the house of the Lord and as the
[56:58] Gates of Heaven says know you not that
[57:01] your body is the Temple of the Holy
[57:03] Ghost which is in you which you have of
[57:05] God and ye are not your own he's
[57:07] revisiting something that he'd already
[57:09] said that this your body is the Temple
[57:11] of the Holy Ghost know you not that your
[57:13] body is a temple and he's revisiting
[57:15] here again to say this you are your body
[57:19] your your physical being uh Body Spirit
[57:22] Soul he said it is the house of God it
[57:26] is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which
[57:28] you have of God the Holy Ghost you have
[57:30] from God and you are not your own so he
[57:32] signifying the individual who's been
[57:35] born again which is the New Birth the
[57:37] baptism of the Holy Ghost and this the
[57:38] soul of a a Believer it makes them a
[57:42] temple a Dwelling Place a habitation of
[57:45] God's own
[57:46] life brother Brandon when he preaches
[57:48] the statue of a perfect man he makes uh
[57:50] similar statements to this throughout it
[57:52] but he called the title building the the
[57:54] living Tabernacle of the living God's
[57:57] Dwelling Place the perfect man amen the
[58:00] living Tabernacle of the Living God
[58:02] where he dwells and and it's a it's a
[58:04] teaching on us that when we have been
[58:07] born again and we've been filled with
[58:08] the Holy Ghost that we become his
[58:10] dwelling place and it's how this
[58:12] dwelling place is built up the living
[58:14] Tabernacle of the Living God so our
[58:17] bodies are a Dwelling Place of God in 1
[58:21] Peter chapter 2:5 he says ye also as
[58:24] light L stones are built up a spiritual
[58:27] house a holy priesthood to offer up
[58:30] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[58:33] by Jesus Christ what a what a beautiful
[58:36] picture because in the Old Testament we
[58:38] had the holy of holies and in that Holy
[58:41] place the most holy Place one person was
[58:43] allowed to enter into the high priest
[58:46] and he was enter into that Holy place
[58:48] and there he would make a sacrifice and
[58:50] he would make this offering once a year
[58:53] and it was a type of Christ
[58:55] who Christ became what he's the high
[58:57] priest he's the sacrifice he becomes The
[59:00] Mercy Seat there's so much that's in
[59:02] this image the temple spoke of Christ
[59:05] the sacrifices all these different
[59:06] elements that are speaking of things and
[59:08] then we have been made these priest he
[59:11] says you are Lively Stones built up a
[59:13] spiritual house but not just a spiritual
[59:16] house also a holy priesthood to offer up
[59:19] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God
[59:21] as the temple of God so he's bringing
[59:24] these images together to where we're not
[59:25] just priests that enter into a temple
[59:27] but we are a temple and we are priests
[59:30] to offer up these spiritual sacrifices
[59:33] that are acceptable to God and he says
[59:35] you are Lively Stones when Jacob built
[59:39] that pillar of stones and anointed it
[59:41] with oil who was who was the image of it
[59:43] was an image of you amen not just an
[59:46] image of the church which God would
[59:47] build upon Revelation but it's the image
[59:49] of the individual a pillar that is a now
[59:51] a stone a Lively Stone with the oil
[59:54] anointing oil symbolizing the Holy
[59:56] Spirit you are built up a spiritual
[59:58] house amen as as Jacob said this is the
[1:00:01] house of God this is the Gate of Heaven
[1:00:03] this is what we become when we're filled
[1:00:05] with the Holy Ghost we are built up the
[1:00:07] house of God we are built up a temple of
[1:00:10] the Holy Ghost we are built up as a
[1:00:11] Lively Stone a spiritual house to be a
[1:00:15] holy priesthood to offer up spiritual
[1:00:17] sacrifices brother B said and you are
[1:00:19] God's house living walking around
[1:00:22] manifesting the Living God Amen this is
[1:00:25] this is the truth amen you are God's
[1:00:28] house walking around manifesting Living
[1:00:30] God for God dwells not in temples made
[1:00:32] with hands but a body hast thou prepared
[1:00:34] me you are God's letter a written
[1:00:37] epistle God is in you manifesting
[1:00:39] himself through that's what we become we
[1:00:42] become the very House of God and as
[1:00:44] Jacob woke that night and said this is
[1:00:47] none other but the house of God he knew
[1:00:49] then if it was the house of God it
[1:00:50] became access to God it became the Gate
[1:00:53] of Heaven
[1:00:55] Heaven is where God dwells he Heaven is
[1:00:58] associated with God so he to connect us
[1:01:01] now as the house of God this body then
[1:01:03] being in the house of God in the temple
[1:01:05] of God becomes a Gate of Heaven brother
[1:01:08] brandom in the sermon why Christ speak
[1:01:09] he said but there's only one real church
[1:01:11] and you don't join it you're born in it
[1:01:14] yes and if you're born in it the Living
[1:01:16] God works himself through you and making
[1:01:19] himself known that's where God dwells in
[1:01:23] his church God goes to church every day
[1:01:27] that's right just lives in church he
[1:01:30] lives in you you are his church you are
[1:01:34] his church you are the Tabernacle that
[1:01:37] God dwells in what a what a statement I
[1:01:39] hope this is really hope you're really
[1:01:41] catching these these very weighty words
[1:01:43] by the prophet when you're born into the
[1:01:45] Church of God when you're baptized by
[1:01:47] one spirit in the body of Christ he says
[1:01:49] that's where God dwells he says he
[1:01:51] dwells in his church I love it he goes
[1:01:53] to church every day and hopefully this
[1:01:57] kind of helps Shake us a little bit to
[1:02:00] think that God that we are his church
[1:02:04] and he goes to church every day because
[1:02:05] he lives in
[1:02:07] you you are his church I had a friend
[1:02:10] many years ago that he kind of joked
[1:02:11] around if you asked him where he went to
[1:02:13] church he'd kind of say I am the church
[1:02:16] and not that we would necessarily need
[1:02:17] to borrow that people say where you go
[1:02:18] to church go I am the church but there
[1:02:20] is a reality just as brother R tells us
[1:02:23] story of the we
[1:02:24] Revival it it's not there's not an
[1:02:27] address but it's a character it's not a
[1:02:30] location but it's a person we know that
[1:02:32] the resurrection is Christ the person of
[1:02:34] Christ and therefore his church can be
[1:02:36] embodied in an individual in a person
[1:02:38] you are his church you're the Tabernacle
[1:02:41] that God dwells in you're he says you're
[1:02:43] the Church of the Living God yourself
[1:02:45] and if the Living God lives in his
[1:02:47] living being then your action is of God
[1:02:50] I kind of just tightens it down a little
[1:02:52] bit if it isn't then God isn't there
[1:02:55] I know that kind of tightens it up
[1:02:57] pretty good it's good to challenge
[1:02:58] ourselves but it tells us that if our
[1:03:00] life isn't manifesting it then
[1:03:02] something's wrong because that's what it
[1:03:04] needs to do he wouldn't make you act
[1:03:07] like that when he says in the word here
[1:03:08] his blueprint don't do it and you go do
[1:03:10] it see that's wrong when you deny it
[1:03:12] then that shows the life isn't even in
[1:03:14] you quite a heavy statement I believe
[1:03:16] but it's not to take away from your
[1:03:18] experience but to challenge you to let
[1:03:20] the experience live yes let it live out
[1:03:22] you are the house of God could you
[1:03:24] imagine if we called this a church but
[1:03:26] you came in and it was just pinball
[1:03:28] machines and pool tables and televisions
[1:03:30] up and and we're serving hot wings and
[1:03:32] different things like that and just
[1:03:34] because we want to call it church it's a
[1:03:36] church but everything goes and there's
[1:03:38] nothing sacred there's nothing
[1:03:40] consecrated there's no nothing being
[1:03:42] expressed and actually done and there's
[1:03:44] not the elements of Christ made
[1:03:45] available and that's where things are
[1:03:47] going now to where now there's a lot of
[1:03:49] so-called churches that are
[1:03:51] secular a and they're not preaching the
[1:03:53] Bible they're not teaching Christ but
[1:03:55] they recognize the power of community
[1:03:57] they recognize the beauty of fellowship
[1:03:59] and certain kind of continuity so
[1:04:00] there's secular churches that don't
[1:04:02] teach from the Bible it's just a
[1:04:04] Gathering
[1:04:05] Place and and it's becoming even more
[1:04:07] and more popular and so for ourselves
[1:04:10] likewise we must challenge ourselves uh
[1:04:12] with this what he says that the Living
[1:04:14] God has to live through us but more than
[1:04:16] that I really want to emphasize to
[1:04:18] recognize that if we have his life
[1:04:20] inside of us we are his body and
[1:04:22] therefore we are a church his church we
[1:04:25] are the temple the Tabernacle of the
[1:04:28] Holy Ghost in John chapter 14 he says if
[1:04:31] I go I prepare a place for you in my
[1:04:33] father's house are many mansions and it
[1:04:36] kind of creates this separation again in
[1:04:37] our minds that one day we're going to go
[1:04:39] we know a body he's prepared there's a
[1:04:41] body waiting this Earthly Tabernacle be
[1:04:43] dissolved we have a body waiting for us
[1:04:45] in in the my father's kingdom are many
[1:04:47] bodies many palaces we're going to leave
[1:04:50] here and go to a body but he doesn't
[1:04:53] want us just to be seeing singly focused
[1:04:55] on leaving Earth so then he comes back
[1:04:57] in verse 23 he says if any man he says
[1:05:00] my father and I will come he says and
[1:05:02] we'll make our Abode with him if any man
[1:05:05] believes he says what my father will
[1:05:06] come and we'll make our Abode with him
[1:05:09] that word abode is we'll make our
[1:05:11] mansion with him in my father's house
[1:05:13] there many mansions if it were not so I
[1:05:15] would not told you I go to prepare a
[1:05:17] place for you so we know we have a body
[1:05:19] waiting for us there's a body that we're
[1:05:21] going to go to but in the meantime he
[1:05:23] says if you'll believe I will come and
[1:05:25] the father will make our Mansion we
[1:05:28] we're going to a mansion but first and
[1:05:30] foremost he wants to make a mansion in
[1:05:33] us he wants to make a Dwelling Place in
[1:05:36] us so we're not just aiming to make
[1:05:39] Heaven our home catch this this is a
[1:05:41] whole separate sermon I got plenty of
[1:05:42] time my flight doesn't leave till
[1:05:44] Friday but there's uh we can just we
[1:05:47] could do Uber Eats we can just have them
[1:05:48] deliver snacks in the hallway there we
[1:05:50] can just keep going and keep going but
[1:05:52] we're not just aiming to make Heaven our
[1:05:54] home but to become a home for
[1:05:57] heaven we're guaranteed a resurrection
[1:06:00] we're guaranteed this Rapture if we have
[1:06:01] the Holy Ghost Inside of us one day
[1:06:03] we're going to make in that sense Heaven
[1:06:05] our home we're going to go into the
[1:06:06] eternities but one day that eternity is
[1:06:08] going to be United with Earth and we're
[1:06:10] going to see a New Jerusalem a heaven
[1:06:11] and earth restored and redeemed but in
[1:06:13] the meantime we're not just trying to
[1:06:15] make Heaven our home but we want to be
[1:06:17] made a home for
[1:06:19] heaven and that's what our bodies are to
[1:06:21] be a Gate of Heaven and then our body is
[1:06:24] a temple of the Lord but our body is
[1:06:27] being a temple of the Lord and if if our
[1:06:29] body being then the dwelling place of
[1:06:31] God just think of the extension of how
[1:06:33] that also our home where we sleep where
[1:06:35] we dwell where we keep our valuables and
[1:06:36] our possessions and our church also
[1:06:39] should be Gates of Heaven and there is a
[1:06:42] duty just as we would have to as Paul is
[1:06:45] saying in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 that
[1:06:47] know you not that your body is the
[1:06:48] Temple of the Holy Ghost and we must
[1:06:50] keep it consecrated and sacred and look
[1:06:52] out after it there's a duty to
[1:06:54] consecrate your homes call them houses
[1:06:56] and we know brother said there's a
[1:06:58] difference between a house and a home
[1:07:00] and so we have a duty to turn that place
[1:07:02] where we sleep that residence that we
[1:07:04] have listed on our ad on our driver's
[1:07:06] license the the our our primary dwelling
[1:07:09] place we have a duty to make that house
[1:07:11] whether it be an apartment a basement
[1:07:12] Suite or if it's a condor or if it's a
[1:07:15] if it's a two-story house or a singl
[1:07:16] story house or we're just written a room
[1:07:18] out of a house we have a duty to make
[1:07:20] that house a home amen it's a duty to
[1:07:23] con and set aside your house is a duty
[1:07:25] and cons a duty to set aside and
[1:07:28] consecrate this
[1:07:29] church 1 Timothy 3: 5 says for if a man
[1:07:33] know not how to rule his own house how
[1:07:36] shall he take care of the Church of God
[1:07:39] that's quite a quite a statement uh and
[1:07:41] I think we can say that about anything
[1:07:42] in the scripture it's quite a statement
[1:07:44] that God will memorialize these thoughts
[1:07:46] in a Bible and preserve it and keep it
[1:07:47] for us but when he says if you know how
[1:07:50] to rule his own house and I know there's
[1:07:51] a much larger setting that he's using
[1:07:54] here but he's drawing a parallel of how
[1:07:56] a man rules his house and how that he
[1:08:00] would take care of the Church of God so
[1:08:02] what he's done is he said there's a
[1:08:04] parallel between the home life and the
[1:08:06] church and if a man doesn't know how to
[1:08:08] rule his own house he's saying then how
[1:08:10] if he doesn't have his house in order
[1:08:12] how is he going to keep the house of God
[1:08:14] in order or the Church of God in
[1:08:16] order and that that there's this uh and
[1:08:19] I believe that's where it should start
[1:08:21] is in our homes and you say well and my
[1:08:24] it's chaotic and it's broken and things
[1:08:26] are out of place that's great that you
[1:08:28] have a church that you can come to where
[1:08:30] you could hear the word but you've got
[1:08:31] to put into practice the things you hear
[1:08:34] and take it home and say this is where
[1:08:36] it starts because if the families never
[1:08:38] get fixed the church eventually
[1:08:41] breaks because it's where the strength
[1:08:42] of a church is is in the families and
[1:08:44] the individuals we got to we don't want
[1:08:46] this just to be a sanctuary that we
[1:08:47] escape to and like oh man I'm so glad
[1:08:49] I'm not at home tonight just happy to be
[1:08:51] in the house of the Lord you should go
[1:08:52] from this Sanctuary to another
[1:08:54] Sanctuary home should be a sanctuary so
[1:08:57] Paul says if you can if he can rule his
[1:08:59] own house then he's in the kind he's in
[1:09:01] that place to take care of the Church of
[1:09:03] God because church is just a type of our
[1:09:07] home life amen in the beginning God
[1:09:11] created a family not a
[1:09:12] church right when God first created an
[1:09:15] Eden he didn't build a church and then
[1:09:17] place man in a church he didn't create
[1:09:20] Church order and church systems and have
[1:09:21] a song service and and and build it all
[1:09:24] just right and then put man in a church
[1:09:26] he created a a paradise his garden his
[1:09:28] pleasure ground and put man there and he
[1:09:30] brought forth the family so God's
[1:09:32] ultimate was a family in this household
[1:09:35] this Gathering of a family with this
[1:09:37] vision of a man and a woman bringing for
[1:09:38] children and that was the ultimate and
[1:09:41] church serves that purpose not the other
[1:09:43] way around am and so there we could say
[1:09:47] that church is a type Church order is a
[1:09:49] type of family order I don't think I'm
[1:09:51] getting out in the weeds here but if I
[1:09:53] could just say this this that uh because
[1:09:55] we we got to be careful that we don't
[1:09:56] get so Church Centric and brother John
[1:09:59] has done a tremendous job of not making
[1:10:00] it about him so I don't think you have a
[1:10:02] problem with it being Pastor Centric but
[1:10:04] it's just kind of maybe in the uh the
[1:10:06] the lore and the DNA sometimes of
[1:10:08] message Believers to it's all about the
[1:10:10] pastor and it's all about the gift and
[1:10:12] it's all about the church when really uh
[1:10:15] it the if there is no Believers there's
[1:10:17] no church right there's no sheep there's
[1:10:20] no pastor and and I believe the people
[1:10:22] are we mutually dependent upon one
[1:10:24] another but the ultimate isn't just to
[1:10:26] serve the church the ultimate is that
[1:10:28] the church serves the family builds up
[1:10:30] the individuals that make up that family
[1:10:32] a a and if we C if you can get that part
[1:10:35] right uh then you really can grow in the
[1:10:37] family life through the work and the
[1:10:39] labor that the church provides those
[1:10:40] resources and I might just have to
[1:10:42] preach the rest of the week just to make
[1:10:44] sense of that because there's so much
[1:10:45] there but I think there's a greater it's
[1:10:48] greater to View Church as being the
[1:10:50] church order as a type of family order
[1:10:52] instead of the other way around right
[1:10:53] when brother bandam says your pastor's
[1:10:55] your husband spiritually speaking you
[1:10:56] know what he meant by that right he
[1:10:58] doesn't mean brother John's your
[1:10:59] spiritual husband that'd be a little
[1:11:00] weird wouldn't it brother Bruce to think
[1:11:02] that brother John's my spiritual husband
[1:11:04] but he meant in the home your husband is
[1:11:07] your pastor spiritually speaking right
[1:11:10] brother Beckman that's what it is a
[1:11:12] pastor in the home is spiritually he's
[1:11:14] spiritually a pastor in the home because
[1:11:16] brother John is literally the pastor in
[1:11:17] the church not spiritually he's
[1:11:19] literally the pastor that's an office
[1:11:21] that God places in the body and he's the
[1:11:23] pastor but at home you have the pastor
[1:11:25] and the associate pastor you have the
[1:11:28] pastor spiritually the husband and the
[1:11:30] Fifth Gospel the mom the wife in the
[1:11:32] home and together they rule rule their
[1:11:34] home as God wants the house of God to be
[1:11:36] ruled that's why the parallel is here a
[1:11:38] man who doesn't know how to rule his own
[1:11:39] house how can he take care of the Church
[1:11:41] of God because those roles in that
[1:11:43] church are just a type of what the
[1:11:45] husband is in his home amen because you
[1:11:47] realize there's not one office in the
[1:11:49] local church that assumes all the
[1:11:50] responsibilities that a husband does in
[1:11:52] the family
[1:11:54] and so when brother Bram said your
[1:11:56] pastor is your husband spiritually
[1:11:57] speaking you can correct this all you
[1:11:58] want brother John but I believe brother
[1:12:00] brandom meant that your the husband in
[1:12:03] the home is a spiritual Pastor not that
[1:12:05] our pastors of our church become our
[1:12:07] spiritual husbands because that's been
[1:12:08] used to abuse a lot of people and so we
[1:12:12] must then in this paril of ruling your
[1:12:15] house and being able to care for the
[1:12:16] Church of God we must rule our bodies
[1:12:18] and our homes if we want our church to
[1:12:20] be right amen our heart is a home for
[1:12:23] heaven and if our heart's a home for
[1:12:26] heaven then our house must be a home for
[1:12:28] us the house itself must be a sanctuary
[1:12:31] the house itself must be a place where
[1:12:33] the holy spirit is welcome the the home
[1:12:36] itself must be a place uh that God is
[1:12:40] pleased to come to and pleased to dwell
[1:12:42] in I I look out on the congregation
[1:12:44] tonight and I see message believers who
[1:12:46] are taught well knowing that you're at
[1:12:47] this church you get you're taught very
[1:12:49] very well and you may recall the sermon
[1:12:51] that brother Bram a story brother Bram
[1:12:53] tells I I think in a couple places about
[1:12:55] the uh the rich couple where he knew a
[1:12:58] boy who wanted to get married and is a
[1:13:00] uh he married eeve night's daughter
[1:13:02] there in the Jeffersonville area New
[1:13:03] Albany area very uh uh rich man he tells
[1:13:07] a story about how that they got married
[1:13:10] uh and when they got married they had a
[1:13:12] beautiful big huge beautiful mansion and
[1:13:15] he talked about how the door knobs or I
[1:13:18] don't know if he called them diamonds or
[1:13:19] something like that but he just talked
[1:13:20] about how it's just very very ornate in
[1:13:22] this Mansion actually went up and looked
[1:13:23] up the neighborhood that they lived in
[1:13:25] and uh the homes there beautiful uh
[1:13:28] extraordinary neighborhoods and he said
[1:13:30] he went up to visit them after they got
[1:13:32] married and he said they were just
[1:13:34] fussing and a fighting as he walked up
[1:13:37] and he and then as he knocked on the
[1:13:38] door of immediately they kind of held
[1:13:40] hands and oh brother brandham come in
[1:13:43] isn't everything wonderful a and he and
[1:13:46] he realized and this is just a big show
[1:13:48] they're just kind of putting it on cuz
[1:13:49] they were fighting and fussing and
[1:13:51] dancing with another woman the night
[1:13:52] before he's like man no matter how much
[1:13:54] money they have no matter how beautiful
[1:13:56] the house was in all its amenities it
[1:13:58] was a place of quarreling and fighting
[1:14:01] and hypocrisy because when they stood in
[1:14:03] the gate they held hands and
[1:14:05] pretended that everything was fine right
[1:14:08] and brother Bram tells that tells that
[1:14:10] part to introduce a different couple
[1:14:13] that wanted to get married he said they
[1:14:14] didn't have enough money to get married
[1:14:15] and his brother had asked him if they
[1:14:16] could marry him and here's the
[1:14:18] difference between a mer Millionaire's
[1:14:19] daughters whose door knobs are 14 karat
[1:14:21] in their home who marries this boy named
[1:14:23] Herman Holtz and they have this big
[1:14:25] beautiful home in this really nice
[1:14:26] mansion that overlooks the the valley
[1:14:28] and he talked about this boy who didn't
[1:14:30] have enough money to pay for a wedding
[1:14:32] and this girl that didn't even have
[1:14:33] hardly had shoes and hitchhike from
[1:14:35] Indianapolis or something like that and
[1:14:37] he said that they when they got married
[1:14:39] he was ask said where where are you
[1:14:40] going to live he said in a box car and
[1:14:43] but they loved one another and he talks
[1:14:45] about how that one day so after he had
[1:14:47] visited this one family in this really
[1:14:50] nice neighborhood he said well I think
[1:14:52] I'll just go find out about this this
[1:14:53] couple that lived in the Box car and he
[1:14:55] said he taken this box car and he
[1:14:57] described how they taken newspapers and
[1:14:59] put tacky buttons up anybody know what a
[1:15:01] tacky button
[1:15:03] is what part of Kentucky you from
[1:15:05] anyhow brother brandom said when he
[1:15:07] everybody said they knew what it was and
[1:15:09] he said what part of Kentucky you from
[1:15:11] but he said he brought old boxes and
[1:15:12] made tables out of them and he's
[1:15:15] describing this scene and if I could
[1:15:17] just uh maybe fast forward in a little
[1:15:19] bit he walks up on this couple now and
[1:15:21] they don't know he's there but he saying
[1:15:23] oh honey there's a there's a a dress I
[1:15:27] want you to buy and they put their arms
[1:15:28] around one another and he said the way
[1:15:30] they were talking uh um there's a little
[1:15:32] dress that hangs in this window and I
[1:15:34] can I can buy it and she's like oh no
[1:15:35] honey you don't need to buy it they're
[1:15:37] talking said I stood there be admiring
[1:15:40] this relationship between these two in
[1:15:42] this old box car you talking about what
[1:15:44] what was the house technically we could
[1:15:46] argue that the house on the hill was a
[1:15:48] house and this is literally a box
[1:15:51] car but one lived in the house one lived
[1:15:53] in a home took a box car and made it a
[1:15:55] home he said I stood there and turned
[1:15:56] around this way looked up on top of the
[1:15:58] hill and I could see the home of the
[1:15:59] other the Steeples on top of the house
[1:16:01] and I thought which is the rich man amen
[1:16:05] and he makes this statement so powerful
[1:16:08] they had taken the old box car put
[1:16:09] newspaper up and tacky buttons he said
[1:16:12] and he and he paper newspapers he
[1:16:13] brought down some old boxes and they
[1:16:15] made a table out of it he says but
[1:16:16] brother if I'd ever found a heaven on
[1:16:18] Earth it
[1:16:20] was brother if I ever found heaven on
[1:16:24] Earth it was here's this million dooll
[1:16:27] home on a hill busting and fighting
[1:16:29] hypocrisy in the gate and here's an old
[1:16:31] box car we didn't have a proper door I
[1:16:33] assume I have to slide that thing back
[1:16:35] and forth and here they live in this old
[1:16:37] box car not sure exactly what it would
[1:16:38] have looked like or how it would have
[1:16:40] been but he said brother if I ever found
[1:16:42] a heaven on Earth it was found in a box
[1:16:45] car what does that tell us not only can
[1:16:48] our hearts be a home for heaven but a
[1:16:50] home a house a box car can be made a
[1:16:52] heaven on on
[1:16:53] Earth our house then can be a home for
[1:16:56] heaven a place where God is welcome this
[1:16:59] is why we're taught about applying the
[1:17:01] token this is why we're conscious of the
[1:17:03] atmosphere that we create brother talks
[1:17:05] about fuss and stewing and fighting
[1:17:06] people get aggravated Mom and Dad
[1:17:08] fighting and aggravate it aggravates the
[1:17:09] whole atmosphere attitudes and all those
[1:17:12] things create an atmosphere so it's
[1:17:14] something we ought to be conscious of
[1:17:15] the culture we're building within our
[1:17:17] own home the atmospheres that perpetuate
[1:17:19] in our homes there's a reason why we're
[1:17:21] taught to apply the token there's a
[1:17:22] reason why that we're to be very careful
[1:17:24] about the things that we let in the
[1:17:26] things we read the things we watch the
[1:17:27] things we talk about because that home
[1:17:30] should be a
[1:17:31] sanctuary should be a Gate of
[1:17:34] Heaven where we as the pillars in the
[1:17:37] church we as the rocks and the stones
[1:17:39] that make the church live and not only
[1:17:41] where we live and we find it a sanctuary
[1:17:43] but it's where others can meet him a
[1:17:46] place where Heaven is present where our
[1:17:49] homes being set aside this is where our
[1:17:51] children begin to learn about God our
[1:17:53] our children first learn to obey God as
[1:17:54] they learn to obey us where they learn
[1:17:56] about love and they learn about respect
[1:17:58] and learning Authority as they serve us
[1:18:00] so our children not filled with the Holy
[1:18:02] Ghost they're learning about God and the
[1:18:04] things of God and the house of God and
[1:18:05] respect and nature and atmosphere right
[1:18:07] there in our homes not just church don't
[1:18:10] put all the responsibility on the Sunday
[1:18:11] school teacher don't put all the
[1:18:12] responsibility on the pastor the church
[1:18:15] exists to give you the resources and the
[1:18:16] tools to be doing those things in your
[1:18:20] home our homes our houses our dwelling
[1:18:23] places our Apartments even if it's a box
[1:18:25] car even if you're living out of your
[1:18:28] car make it a place where Heaven is
[1:18:31] welcome a Gate of
[1:18:33] Heaven that third thing we were
[1:18:35] mentioning not just our bodies not just
[1:18:37] our house but also the church 1 Timothy
[1:18:39] chap 3:15 just a little bit later in
[1:18:41] that same chapter but if I T long that
[1:18:43] thou mayest know how thou oughtest to
[1:18:45] behave thyself in the house of God which
[1:18:48] is the Church of the Living God the
[1:18:50] pillar and ground of Truth you you are a
[1:18:53] pillar and the church is the pillar and
[1:18:55] ground of Truth when Jacob erected that
[1:18:57] pillar and said this is the house of God
[1:18:59] what an image when he Anointed with oil
[1:19:01] what an image we are representing that
[1:19:04] but then also the Church of the Living
[1:19:05] God which is the pillar in ground of
[1:19:07] truth that's something to think about
[1:19:09] for a while that's something to really
[1:19:10] get into and think about what does it
[1:19:11] mean that the Church of the Living God
[1:19:13] is the pillar and the ground of truth
[1:19:15] but he does something very unique here
[1:19:17] again he brings together the church just
[1:19:20] as he brought together the home life and
[1:19:21] the local church here he brings together
[1:19:24] the the Church the true church and the
[1:19:26] local church that we might know how to
[1:19:28] behave ourselves in the house of God in
[1:19:31] the local Gathering and the local
[1:19:33] Gathering is to serves the purpose of
[1:19:37] that spiritual Gathering the body of
[1:19:39] Christ if you recall brother BR preached
[1:19:41] the sermon the five definite
[1:19:43] identifications of the True Church of
[1:19:44] the Living God and no offense but this
[1:19:47] church isn't the True Church of the
[1:19:50] Living God but send the light serve the
[1:19:53] True Church of the Living God no one
[1:19:56] church is the singular or is the church
[1:19:59] True Church of the Living God why
[1:20:00] because you could be a member of this
[1:20:02] church and God could lead you to go be a
[1:20:04] member of another church amen right
[1:20:07] pastors change in True Churches they
[1:20:08] they they retire the sometimes their
[1:20:10] lives will end in their service to the
[1:20:12] Lord they'll step down or maybe
[1:20:14] sometimes they just go by way of the
[1:20:16] grave and they the pastor of a church
[1:20:17] will change but you know what there's
[1:20:18] only one Shepherd of the true church and
[1:20:20] it never changes there's no splits in
[1:20:22] the true church that's right there's no
[1:20:23] quarrels and disagreements in the true
[1:20:25] church so the local church and its
[1:20:27] government is set up to serve the true
[1:20:30] church because if there wasn't a true
[1:20:31] church we wouldn't need a local
[1:20:33] church and so when Paul says that you
[1:20:36] might know how to behave yourself in the
[1:20:37] house of God he's tells that there are
[1:20:39] local Gatherings that serve the Church
[1:20:41] of the Living God that serve the pillar
[1:20:44] and the ground of Truth and so it makes
[1:20:46] this local church this beautiful
[1:20:48] building and just how it continues uh uh
[1:20:50] to be taken care of and to grow and
[1:20:52] provide provides so many different
[1:20:53] resources and has prayer meetings and
[1:20:55] church services and youth functions this
[1:20:57] is should be a sacred place yes this
[1:21:00] should be considered a special place
[1:21:02] just look at how quickly brother John
[1:21:04] that how you labored all those years uh
[1:21:06] uh renting for almost almost 20 years
[1:21:10] renting and keeping that place together
[1:21:13] and then when finally finding a building
[1:21:15] as soon as you find it co comes and
[1:21:17] shuts down any plans of getting a permit
[1:21:19] to
[1:21:20] occupy right slows everything now then
[1:21:23] you get it all together it's a big
[1:21:24] beautiful uh uh beautiful Sanctuary with
[1:21:27] the carpet the chairs and all the
[1:21:28] details I wonder who picked the colors
[1:21:30] do we know who picked the colors I'm
[1:21:31] just
[1:21:32] kidding and and all the labor that goes
[1:21:34] into it and the woodwork you could tell
[1:21:36] brother John's a perfectionist and the
[1:21:38] detail you know I I think the these this
[1:21:40] Altar and these Pony walls are a
[1:21:43] microcosm of the the detail and the
[1:21:45] attention he gives to the sermons he
[1:21:47] studies for and the care that he gives
[1:21:49] for his people he wants to be sure it's
[1:21:51] right that's what a a pastor does he
[1:21:53] looks out after these things he watches
[1:21:54] over these things it's the just the
[1:21:56] burden and the gift that God will give a
[1:21:57] man to labor in these things and as soon
[1:21:59] as it's all done and beautiful a gas
[1:22:01] company forgets to come by and fill up
[1:22:03] the gas and it floods tens of thousands
[1:22:06] dollars worth of damage oh surely it was
[1:22:08] going to be something that would further
[1:22:10] uh hinder the Gathering but God comes on
[1:22:12] the scene look at everything you can't
[1:22:13] even tell there was ever a flood in here
[1:22:16] unless you start looking maybe at the
[1:22:17] tiles and did you ever replace those
[1:22:19] different colors see he's a
[1:22:21] perfectionist amazing
[1:22:24] but it just why why would the devil
[1:22:26] attack these things or why do those
[1:22:27] things happen to keep you from having a
[1:22:29] place like this that you could call your
[1:22:31] own because it's an important Place
[1:22:33] brother B the sermon why I'm I've run
[1:22:35] out of time I'm running out and I can
[1:22:37] take my time I'll take my time with what
[1:22:39] little bit I'm running out of but notice
[1:22:41] what brother Bram says here these are I
[1:22:42] think these are very important
[1:22:43] statements he's talking about people and
[1:22:45] their struggles and there ups and downs
[1:22:47] and and things is because there's no joy
[1:22:50] in the house of the Lord like think
[1:22:51] about your private life your personal
[1:22:53] life and the struggles you have and he
[1:22:54] says is it because there's no joy in the
[1:22:56] house of the Lord you don't have a place
[1:22:57] you can turn there's there's not a a
[1:22:59] resource he said what makes a person
[1:23:01] want to drink and run around and act
[1:23:02] like that is it because we don't have
[1:23:05] any God now do we drink do we smoke do
[1:23:08] we cuss we do all these things or do we
[1:23:09] turn to the things of the world for our
[1:23:11] Recreation for our release for our
[1:23:13] comfort because there is no God well we
[1:23:16] know there's a God we know that there's
[1:23:18] truth is it because there's no joy in
[1:23:20] the house of the Lord anymore so the the
[1:23:23] house of God should be a place of Joy
[1:23:25] brother B talks about how your children
[1:23:27] re reach a certain age where he said
[1:23:29] actually doesn't say when they reach
[1:23:30] certain age about it he says you should
[1:23:32] make home for your children a place
[1:23:33] where they're happy to be place where
[1:23:35] they're happy to bring their children
[1:23:36] make it about them and think of ways to
[1:23:38] where they feel comfortable and they
[1:23:39] feel safe place they want to invite
[1:23:41] their friends to and then it get to a
[1:23:42] certain point where they grow up and you
[1:23:43] need to be there as a friend to your
[1:23:45] children and be there someone that they
[1:23:46] can trust and have confidence in and
[1:23:48] home should be a place of Joy a place of
[1:23:50] safety and church should be a place yes
[1:23:52] of joy is it because the Holy Ghost
[1:23:55] isn't ready to bless all of us surely it
[1:23:57] is but what have we made Church he's is
[1:23:59] a challenge is there anything wrong with
[1:24:00] it but because we do it that's the
[1:24:03] reason we're cursed catch this that's
[1:24:05] the reason God puts these things upon
[1:24:07] the church this cold and dampness we're
[1:24:09] going to other places for pleasure
[1:24:11] instead of coming to the house of the
[1:24:13] Lord for
[1:24:14] pleasure this should be a place a
[1:24:16] consecrated place just like you always
[1:24:19] return home at the end of the day after
[1:24:20] work and after travel and after your
[1:24:22] journey you know eventually you're going
[1:24:23] to come back home no matter where things
[1:24:25] take you whether it be a road trip or
[1:24:26] vacation or work or you go to go to
[1:24:29] school you come back home church should
[1:24:31] be that place where you come back
[1:24:33] to he says we just go to all these other
[1:24:35] places instead of coming to the house of
[1:24:37] the Lord for pleasure but run off to
[1:24:38] ball games and movies and shows or you
[1:24:41] name it he says we go to all these other
[1:24:43] places for pleasure instead of coming to
[1:24:44] the house of the Lord for pleasure he
[1:24:46] said the house of the Lord is the joy of
[1:24:48] the
[1:24:49] Lord this is the place that God joys in
[1:24:51] he says we ought to to know how to
[1:24:52] behave ourselves in the house of God
[1:24:54] it's speaking of the local Gathering of
[1:24:57] Believers and it's a place that God
[1:24:59] finds joy he said the joy of the Lord is
[1:25:01] the joy of his people he wants you to
[1:25:03] come to church and worship him and be
[1:25:06] happy and satisfied giveing praise and
[1:25:09] honor and glory and wisdom and might and
[1:25:11] power to God he wants you to do that so
[1:25:13] he wants you to come to church and
[1:25:15] church be a place where you worship him
[1:25:16] where you're happy satisfied give him
[1:25:18] praise and honor and glory and wisdom
[1:25:19] and might and power to God that's what
[1:25:21] church should be
[1:25:23] you know it's a shame that people drag
[1:25:25] themselves to churches that they don't
[1:25:27] like being in they complain about they
[1:25:29] always run down and they always find
[1:25:31] things to criticize and when church
[1:25:33] should be a place where you want to come
[1:25:36] you want to worship and you're happy and
[1:25:39] satisfied where you can give praise and
[1:25:41] honor and Glory where wisdom might and
[1:25:43] the power of God is welcome if the if
[1:25:45] the power of God's not welcome that's no
[1:25:46] place you want to go to if the wisdom of
[1:25:48] God isn't going forth that's no place
[1:25:50] you should want to be but you God wants
[1:25:52] you to go to church where you can
[1:25:54] worship him where you can be happy and
[1:25:56] satisfied where you can give praise and
[1:25:58] the honor and glory and wisdom and might
[1:26:00] and power of God is welcome and I
[1:26:01] believe this place is that
[1:26:05] place he wants you to come to church
[1:26:08] it's a Gate of Heaven Amen brother Ram
[1:26:11] in the sermon the unchangeable word of
[1:26:12] God said the Bible says these signs
[1:26:14] shall follow them that believe God makes
[1:26:16] a distinction he gives a mark on the
[1:26:19] people if he believes these signs shall
[1:26:21] follow them back believe that's right
[1:26:23] the believer not to say that they
[1:26:25] believe not that they say they believe
[1:26:28] or not the supposed believer but the
[1:26:29] real believer he says I want to belong
[1:26:32] to a church that's got them signs and
[1:26:33] wonders following it that's where I want
[1:26:36] to have my fellowship right under the
[1:26:38] blood of Jesus Christ we're angels and
[1:26:41] Powers the Holy Ghost and God works back
[1:26:44] and forth through his church through his
[1:26:45] people showing signs and wonders notice
[1:26:48] this just as Jacob saw angels ascending
[1:26:51] and descending just as he said surely
[1:26:53] the Lord was in this place he says I
[1:26:55] want to be at a church I want to belong
[1:26:56] to a church Where Angels and powers and
[1:26:58] the Holy Ghost God works back and forth
[1:27:00] through his church through his people
[1:27:01] showing signs and wonders why it's the
[1:27:03] greatest thing I've ever known in my
[1:27:05] life it's part of Heaven on Earth
[1:27:09] amen notice how we our hearts become a
[1:27:12] home for heaven and brother bam
[1:27:15] identified a box car down on down by the
[1:27:17] river said it was a place where they had
[1:27:19] built some things and there used to be
[1:27:21] some indust things where they uh I can't
[1:27:24] remember just exactly how he described
[1:27:26] it there's a box car down by the
[1:27:28] river and they he in a Box Car by the
[1:27:30] river brother said if I ever found a
[1:27:32] heaven on Earth I found it there that
[1:27:34] day and now brother brandham says church
[1:27:37] is a part of Heaven on
[1:27:40] Earth and all these parts are working
[1:27:43] together we try to wrap this up just
[1:27:45] think about the parallel among the three
[1:27:48] gates I could try to preach as fast as I
[1:27:50] can and we could just slow the recording
[1:27:51] down down so it it's a normal speed but
[1:27:54] I'm I'm running out of time and I want
[1:27:56] to just finish here but let's just look
[1:27:58] in this kind of this uh this area here
[1:28:01] as we try to sum it all up this parallel
[1:28:02] among these three gates you have your
[1:28:05] body you have a house we have this
[1:28:08] church I believe our home life should
[1:28:10] reflect that hidden
[1:28:11] life there there's this hidden life down
[1:28:14] in our souls and it ought to be
[1:28:16] reflected in our attitudes our spirits
[1:28:17] and our bodies the way we present
[1:28:20] ourselves our home should be the same
[1:28:22] way that if we as the children of God
[1:28:24] dwell there that our home should reflect
[1:28:26] that what's on the walls what what has
[1:28:28] the preeminence what what kind of is the
[1:28:31] centerpiece I I I kind of noticed that
[1:28:34] sister Elizabeth and I have been we're
[1:28:35] Lord willing you pray for us we're
[1:28:37] building a house and in a lot of places
[1:28:39] when they build their house there's got
[1:28:40] to be this feature right that the the
[1:28:43] there's got to be a place you got to put
[1:28:44] the screen and everything has to orient
[1:28:46] that way and we don't even think about
[1:28:47] that at all as a matter of fact the more
[1:28:49] that I think about it our you know who's
[1:28:51] going to want to buy our grand room our
[1:28:53] grand living room because it's like so
[1:28:55] where do you sit to watch the
[1:28:56] TV right and so there's there's just
[1:28:59] things that we don't you don't make the
[1:29:01] centerpiece we don't make this is what
[1:29:02] we gather around there's a it's to be we
[1:29:05] want our homes to have a welcoming
[1:29:08] atmosphere because it's to be a gate to
[1:29:11] heaven and this church it exists to
[1:29:13] promote the health and well-being of
[1:29:15] those of individuals of your body and
[1:29:18] your home I think of how sister Kathleen
[1:29:20] had that Ministry to watch out over us
[1:29:23] in our in our health and to notice
[1:29:25] certain signs of certain things and she
[1:29:28] had a real burden uh how we could take
[1:29:30] care of ourselves and you know the Bible
[1:29:32] speaks so much of our health and and our
[1:29:34] bodies and taking care of our natural
[1:29:36] bodies and so this church this church
[1:29:38] exist to promote the health of our
[1:29:40] bodies of our spiritual well-being our
[1:29:43] physical well-being and to also promote
[1:29:45] the well-being of our
[1:29:47] homes and we need all
[1:29:50] three because together it constitutes
[1:29:53] that three- room house talks about a
[1:29:55] three- room house and that's all of us
[1:29:58] are a three room house he said God
[1:29:59] dwells in a three room house Body Spirit
[1:30:01] Soul the Tabernacle was arranged into
[1:30:03] those three areas the outer Court inner
[1:30:05] Court holy of holies if you took any one
[1:30:08] of those out it wouldn't be the temple
[1:30:10] it wouldn't be the Tabernacle as a
[1:30:11] matter of fact it's when they finally
[1:30:13] set up the outer wall to create the
[1:30:15] outer Court when the sh Glory came down
[1:30:17] the Tabernacle sh sh Glory came down
[1:30:20] into that holiest of holies why because
[1:30:22] God was signifying the necessity of
[1:30:24] those three parts I just don't want to
[1:30:26] have a saved saved soul and not have my
[1:30:29] spirit perfected and what and not have a
[1:30:32] redeemed body amen right God promises a
[1:30:34] total Deliverance a total Redemption
[1:30:36] Redemption of the Soul spirit and body
[1:30:38] he's going to redeem all three this is
[1:30:40] expressed in the Tabernacle in the
[1:30:42] instruments of the temple God expresses
[1:30:44] it so we are a three- room house and all
[1:30:46] are needed because together they make up
[1:30:49] what God wants us to have our soul is
[1:30:52] that innermost part that's the most
[1:30:54] private we don't see our souls but it's
[1:30:56] there where God
[1:30:58] dwells and then we have the spirit you
[1:31:01] look at that Spirit as being our house
[1:31:03] it's it it it it's hidden it's more
[1:31:05] personal but yet others can others can
[1:31:07] get to know it others know you by your
[1:31:10] personality by your spirit the things
[1:31:12] you think about the things you talk
[1:31:13] about and then you have your body which
[1:31:16] is the most visible it's the things that
[1:31:19] people see it's outward it's public and
[1:31:21] that's what this church church becomes
[1:31:23] not everybody's going to be able to go
[1:31:24] to your homes and everybody that goes to
[1:31:26] your homes isn't going to be able to go
[1:31:27] to the bedroom so we have a soul that
[1:31:29] only God enters in and he dwells but
[1:31:31] then as we invite people to our homes
[1:31:33] and our house they get to know us more
[1:31:34] personally more individually it's a
[1:31:36] place where everyone can Fellowship uh
[1:31:38] in this body in a more personal way but
[1:31:40] then this house becomes the public face
[1:31:44] and a place that welcomes The The Lost
[1:31:46] and the lonely it takes those that are
[1:31:48] hurting those that are burdened those
[1:31:49] that are sick those that are seeking and
[1:31:52] we welcome them here so they too can
[1:31:54] come in contact with god brother BR in
[1:31:57] the sermon and knoweth it not said
[1:31:58] that's three rings three circles and
[1:32:00] that's you and that's God God and a
[1:32:02] trinity is one and without a trinity
[1:32:04] he's not God quite a statement said he
[1:32:07] can be manifested he can't be manifested
[1:32:09] any other way and neither can you be
[1:32:11] manifested without being the Trinity
[1:32:12] person that you are that's Body Spirit
[1:32:15] Soul without either one of them you're
[1:32:17] not complete you didn't have a soul
[1:32:19] you'd be nothing if you didn't have a
[1:32:20] spirit you'd be nothing you didn't have
[1:32:22] a body you'd just be a spirit not a body
[1:32:24] so we need all three and that's what I'm
[1:32:26] kind of wanting to say now to you and
[1:32:28] kind of taking that thought that we've
[1:32:30] got to have not just a soul that's
[1:32:32] sealed but a house that's consecrated
[1:32:34] and a church that's set aside for the
[1:32:36] Living God that there's a place where
[1:32:38] God dwells in our hearts but then
[1:32:40] there's also a place where we dwell
[1:32:41] that's dedicated to God called a home
[1:32:43] and that we go to church and it's I I
[1:32:46] preached this on a Wednesday night to
[1:32:47] people who came to church so you could
[1:32:49] leave here going that's right I go to
[1:32:51] church on Wednesday wday nights and so
[1:32:53] we express it to you not just to
[1:32:55] encourage you but to show you're doing
[1:32:57] the right thing by coming here I don't
[1:32:59] think
[1:33:00] anybody I at our church there back in
[1:33:02] Texas would be streaming this or would
[1:33:03] know about it but I I started a series
[1:33:07] of couple years ago called kids eat free
[1:33:09] it's or a segment called kids eat free
[1:33:10] on Wednesday
[1:33:12] nights and the whole idea the whole idea
[1:33:14] just in case they do streaming I'm going
[1:33:16] to turn my mic off and I'm just going to
[1:33:17] share this off the Record because they
[1:33:19] all they don't know what it means at
[1:33:20] home they're all what does it mean kids
[1:33:21] e free but the whole concept and idea
[1:33:24] behind kids e free is we'll
[1:33:27] sometimes put our kids together put in
[1:33:30] the car and drive somewhere to eat maybe
[1:33:32] we don't even like but we do it
[1:33:36] because just tell me I can get something
[1:33:38] free and I'm there and you're making the
[1:33:40] right decision by having
[1:33:42] kid you're making the right decision by
[1:33:44] bringing your family to church your kids
[1:33:47] are eting for
[1:33:50] free they getting getting and my my
[1:33:53] vision my idea was oh I just wish the
[1:33:55] parents could catch the vision of what a
[1:33:57] benefit it is to their families when
[1:33:59] they come to the house of God on
[1:34:00] Wednesday nights they come on Sundays
[1:34:02] they make the sacrifices for youth
[1:34:03] meetings because it's such a benefit to
[1:34:05] the family and that's kind of the whole
[1:34:13] vision and that's what it means that
[1:34:15] kids eat
[1:34:19] free we have a duty
[1:34:23] to this body to your house to this
[1:34:27] church they're the Gates of Heaven we
[1:34:30] have a duty to consecrate them as homes
[1:34:32] for God we our individual persons our
[1:34:36] houses and this church become Gates of
[1:34:38] Heaven where others can have access to
[1:34:41] God I I I've preached an hour so now we
[1:34:45] got to kind of we I want you to be able
[1:34:47] to go all the way even back to the
[1:34:48] beginning start tying this all together
[1:34:50] what were gates to begin with what do we
[1:34:52] learn in the very beginning about a gate
[1:34:54] it's not just an entrance but it's a
[1:34:56] meeting place it's a place of authority
[1:34:58] a place of judging it's a place that
[1:35:01] represents the glory of a city the glory
[1:35:03] of a dwelling place it's a place of
[1:35:05] honor a place of respect a place of
[1:35:07] power and judgment it's a place where
[1:35:09] Justice is to go forth It's a place of
[1:35:11] strength a place where you to find truth
[1:35:14] and Justice so therefore as this gate
[1:35:16] was a place of business a place of
[1:35:18] transacting a place of deliberation a
[1:35:20] place where truth was to go forth a
[1:35:22] place where decisions were made a place
[1:35:24] where opinions were given then we are to
[1:35:26] be a place where others have access to
[1:35:28] Heaven a place where God is manifested a
[1:35:31] place where others can receive truth a
[1:35:33] place of God's power if it's the gate to
[1:35:36] a city that's a person's access to a
[1:35:38] city it's a place to the access of what
[1:35:40] the city has to offer I want to be a
[1:35:42] Gate of Heaven I want my home to be a
[1:35:44] Gate of Heaven for my children I want
[1:35:46] this church to be a Gate of Heaven for
[1:35:48] all that would come the Bible says that
[1:35:50] out of you would poor rivers of Living
[1:35:52] Waters and think of all those things
[1:35:54] that you become that even in your home
[1:35:57] in your house it becomes a place an
[1:36:00] entrance to Heaven a place where truth
[1:36:02] Goes Forth a place of deliberation a
[1:36:04] place where business is conducted a
[1:36:06] place where the right kind of atmosphere
[1:36:08] can be
[1:36:09] created and since this gate these Gates
[1:36:12] of the body the gates of your homes and
[1:36:15] the gates of this church are so
[1:36:16] important it's the gates where the enemy
[1:36:18] attacks where it try to makes us weak
[1:36:20] and vulnerable
[1:36:22] says that I have set the point of the
[1:36:23] sword against all their Gates here in
[1:36:25] Ezekiel
[1:36:27] 21:15 that their heart May faint their
[1:36:29] ruins be multiplied ah it is made bright
[1:36:31] it is wrapped up for the slaughter and
[1:36:33] when he refers to their Gates here he
[1:36:35] refers to the entirety of the city the
[1:36:38] palace and the houses I've set the sword
[1:36:42] against their Gates and so it's not just
[1:36:44] that you go up to a gate and
[1:36:45] go said I've set my sword against their
[1:36:48] Gates that means I'll get the city I'll
[1:36:51] get the palace I'll get the
[1:36:53] homes and that's what the devil wants to
[1:36:55] do he wants to set his sword against the
[1:36:57] gates against you as an individual
[1:36:59] against your house and against this
[1:37:01] church that's true therefore we must
[1:37:04] guard these Gates amen we must ask God
[1:37:08] to strengthen these Gates this body when
[1:37:09] I say body I mean you as a person Body
[1:37:11] Spirit Soul you as an individual
[1:37:13] strengthen our homes strengthen this
[1:37:15] church amen Proverbs 147: 12 and 13
[1:37:19] praise the Lord oh Jerusalem praise thy
[1:37:20] God oh for he hath strengthened the bars
[1:37:23] of thy Gates Heath blessed thy children
[1:37:26] within Thee the strong the strength of
[1:37:28] the gates and fortifies the blessing of
[1:37:31] those within he strengthened the bars of
[1:37:33] thy Gates that should be our prayer that
[1:37:35] he would strengthen these Gates
[1:37:38] strengthen me as an individual that is
[1:37:40] the dwelling place of God that I could
[1:37:42] be a Gate of Heaven and Lord since I
[1:37:44] have a place I lay my head and I collect
[1:37:46] my valuables and I and I pay my rent or
[1:37:48] I pay the mortgage and there I am with
[1:37:50] my wife in my children and I invite
[1:37:52] others into it Lord strengthen that gate
[1:37:55] May that house be a a gate to heaven and
[1:37:58] Lord strengthen this church and all that
[1:38:00] consider themselves a part of it
[1:38:02] strengthen each one each member from the
[1:38:04] pastor all the way to the youngest Lord
[1:38:06] strengthen this
[1:38:08] church as we said on Sunday as I close
[1:38:11] this sister Cheryl and the musicians
[1:38:13] those that are here in Psalms 27 verse4
[1:38:16] said one thing have I desired of the
[1:38:17] Lord that will I seek after that I may
[1:38:19] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[1:38:21] days of my life to behold the beauty of
[1:38:24] the Lord and to inquire in his
[1:38:27] temple one thing have I desired that
[1:38:31] will I seek after that I may dwell in
[1:38:34] the house of the Lord all the days of my
[1:38:36] life now that's David's desire and if I
[1:38:40] could just kind of peek into this God
[1:38:41] desires to dwell in
[1:38:43] you brother B said God goes to church
[1:38:47] every day he lives in his church how he
[1:38:49] lives in you
[1:38:51] the very desire that David expressed is
[1:38:53] only there because the desire that God
[1:38:55] originally expressed his desire to make
[1:38:57] your heart his
[1:38:59] home David's desire no wonder he had a
[1:39:02] heart like God's because God said I want
[1:39:04] to dwell in my people all the days of my
[1:39:06] life I want to be in
[1:39:08] them and as David said one thing have I
[1:39:11] desired that will I seek after the dwell
[1:39:13] in the house of the Lord whether he was
[1:39:14] referring to the Tabernacle in the
[1:39:15] wilderness or whether he' be referring
[1:39:17] to that Temple that one day would be
[1:39:18] built called the house of God in the Old
[1:39:20] Testament God home was that Tabernacle
[1:39:23] there behind the veil the shikan of
[1:39:24] Glory would come and dwell God's home
[1:39:26] was in the Tabernacle in the temple so
[1:39:28] we read already already tonight the New
[1:39:31] Testament this church that God builds
[1:39:33] God's home is in his church God finds
[1:39:36] rest in you and I God's Dwelling Place
[1:39:39] in the New Testament is in the hearts of
[1:39:41] his Believers it is his body and one day
[1:39:44] in eternity in the future home we're
[1:39:47] taught that God is resident with Man in
[1:39:50] Christ Christ and his bride where on
[1:39:53] Earth for all
[1:39:55] eternity in every single instance God's
[1:39:58] home is on
[1:40:00] Earth it's almost as if that Dimension
[1:40:04] that heaven that God created where he
[1:40:05] can manifest himself was just
[1:40:08] temporary because one day it's all going
[1:40:10] to be Consolidated in a new Heaven and
[1:40:12] new earth God's going to make his
[1:40:14] dwelling place on Earth so your heart
[1:40:17] matters now your home matters now this
[1:40:19] church matters now and with without any
[1:40:21] one of those you're not who you're
[1:40:23] supposed to be any one of those is out
[1:40:25] of the kilter if any one those of those
[1:40:27] is not dedicated if any one of those
[1:40:29] aren't his he says you're not
[1:40:32] complete brother brandham in the sermon
[1:40:34] God hiding himself in Simplicity than
[1:40:36] revealing himself and the same remember
[1:40:38] that's where you find God is in
[1:40:39] Simplicity that's why life is so complex
[1:40:43] so complicated really it's made to
[1:40:46] scatter us and to spread us out because
[1:40:48] God's in simplicity so if we can get
[1:40:50] spread bread then we won't find God so
[1:40:52] we got to come back to Simplicity to
[1:40:54] find God he says now I think it's our
[1:40:57] duty to make the inside right he's
[1:40:58] talking about the remodel at the
[1:41:00] Tabernacle a a and and there's this
[1:41:03] physical building but he says we have a
[1:41:04] duty to make the inside right by the
[1:41:05] grace of God to be ever so grateful to
[1:41:09] uh to God that our this will just not
[1:41:12] only be a beautiful building that we'll
[1:41:14] come to but may everyone now this is
[1:41:17] spoken of a Jefferson in Jeffersonville
[1:41:20] brandom tabernac
[1:41:22] he says may everyone who comes in see
[1:41:24] the beautiful characteristic of Jesus
[1:41:27] Christ in every person that comes
[1:41:31] in so there's you may it be a
[1:41:35] consecrated place to our Lord a
[1:41:37] consecrated people for no matter how
[1:41:40] beautiful the structure is that we
[1:41:42] certainly do appreciate the beauty of
[1:41:44] the church is the character of the
[1:41:47] people so he says I trust it'll always
[1:41:50] be a house of God of
[1:41:53] beauty there's the beauty of God in his
[1:41:55] people your body the beauty of God in
[1:41:58] the church as he says I want May
[1:42:01] everyone who comes into the house of God
[1:42:03] see the beautiful characteristic of
[1:42:05] Jesus Christ in every person therefore
[1:42:07] we want this place to be a consecrated
[1:42:09] place where the beauty of the church
[1:42:11] being the character of the people may
[1:42:13] this house always be a house of God's
[1:42:16] Beauty therefore let us make our hearts
[1:42:18] a home for heaven that we might be the
[1:42:22] beautiful characteristic of Jesus Christ
[1:42:25] therefore if that's true of me then let
[1:42:27] it be true of my house that it may be
[1:42:29] made a home and may it be true of this
[1:42:31] place the house of the Lord that I call
[1:42:34] my home Church may it be a house of
[1:42:36] God's Beauty may we all be the Gates of
[1:42:40] Heaven amen could you stand together
[1:42:42] this
[1:42:43] evening thank you for your patience and
[1:42:46] allow me to just deliver that
[1:42:49] burden now don't go telling anybody what
[1:42:51] the kids eat free
[1:42:56] means we just bow our heads tonight
[1:42:59] sister Sher if you have a song on your
[1:43:00] heart just feel led to
[1:43:07] play maybe that song uh in my life Lord
[1:43:10] be glorified key of F I think in my life
[1:43:14] Lord be
[1:43:16] glorified that's what our desire is
[1:43:19] that's what God desired in
[1:43:22] creation as he
[1:43:25] desired that in what he created he would
[1:43:29] be
[1:43:30] glorified and not that just rocks would
[1:43:32] cry out or man would worship one that
[1:43:35] they couldn't see but that somehow the
[1:43:37] nature the divine nature of God could be
[1:43:40] expressed through that which he
[1:43:42] created and I believe that God wants our
[1:43:44] lives to glorify him and maybe we could
[1:43:47] just consecrate ourselves I know we make
[1:43:49] mistakes when I say we I'm not just
[1:43:51] saying the Royal we we I know I make
[1:43:53] mistakes I know you make
[1:43:56] mistakes and we can be really really
[1:43:58] hard on ourselves but just think of the
[1:43:59] grace of God to speak to us as he has
[1:44:02] through his word to say you're going to
[1:44:04] make it cuz I'm With You Jacob in all of
[1:44:07] his deceit and all of his fears and all
[1:44:09] of his problems in that moment he said I
[1:44:12] am with
[1:44:15] you and I will not leave thee until I've
[1:44:18] done that which I have spoken to thee of
[1:44:20] I God says the same thing to you tonight
