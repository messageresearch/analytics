[16:04] [Music]
[16:07] So,
[16:09] I think the humidity messes with my
[16:11] eyes. So, I told my wife this morning, I
[16:13] said, "Uh oh, can't see again today."

[16:42] [Applause]
[16:45] in various ways.
[16:50] [Music]
[16:51] troubles. He had some,
[16:57] but not from above.
[17:03] God gave him his son.
[17:09] On the wings of a dove.
[17:15] On the wings of a snow
[17:19] white
[17:20] dove,
[17:22] God sends his pure
[17:25] sweet
[17:27] love, a sign from above,
[17:34] on the wings of a dove.
[17:41] Jesus our savior
[17:46] came to earth one day.
[17:52] He was born in a stable
[17:58] in a manger of clay.
[18:05] Though here rejected,
[18:10] but not from above.
[18:16] God gave us his son.
[18:22] On the wings of a dove.
[18:28] On the wings of a snow
[18:32] white
[18:33] dove.

[18:39] love, a sign from above
[18:46] on the wings of a dove.

[18:56] [Music]
[18:58] in many a way.
[19:04] I cried for healing.
[19:10] Both night and day.
[19:16] Faith wasn't forgotten
[19:22] by the Father above.
[19:28] He gave us a son.
[19:34] On the wings of a dove.
[19:40] On the wings of a snow
[19:43] white
[19:45] dove, God sends his pure
[19:49] sweet

[20:13] morning.
[20:15] Remember, faith was not forgotten.
[20:20] &gt;&gt; Faith is when you pray and you still
[20:23] don't see results.
[20:25] &gt;&gt; That's faith.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; Praying and seeing a miracle, that's
[20:29] well, that's just God's wonderful mercy
[20:31] to us.
[20:33] But it takes faith to stand a test.

[47:39] The book of 2 Kings chapter 5.
[47:51] We are going to read from verse 1 to3
[47:55] and Revelation chapter 10
[48:00] and we'll be reading verse 8 to 11.
[48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[48:08] &gt;&gt; 2 Kings chapter 5
[48:16] the Bible read us.
[48:19] Now non captain of the host of the king
[48:23] of Syria was a great man with his master
[48:27] and honorable because by him the Lord
[48:30] had given deliverance unto Syria. He was
[48:33] also a mighty man in valor but he was a
[48:37] leper. And the Syrian had gone out by
[48:40] companies and had brought
[48:44] away captive out of the land of Israel a
[48:47] little maid. And she waited on Neon's
[48:51] wife.
[48:53] And she said unto her mistress,
[48:56] "Will God my Lord with a prophet that is
[49:00] in Samaria? For he will recover him of
[49:04] his leprosy."
[49:06] Revelation
[49:08] chapter 10
[49:24] from verse 8.
[49:26] And the voice which I heard from heaven
[49:28] spake unto me again and said, "Go and
[49:30] take the little book which is open in
[49:32] the hand of the angel, which standed
[49:35] upon the sea, and upon the earth." And I
[49:38] went unto the angel and unto and said
[49:41] unto him, "Give me the little book." And
[49:44] he said unto me, "Take, eat it, and hit
[49:47] it up. Take it and hit it up, and it
[49:50] shall make thy belly bitter, but it
[49:52] shall be in thy mouth sweet as onion.
[49:55] And I took the little book out of the
[49:57] end out of the angel's hand and ate it
[50:00] up, and it was in my mouth sweet as
[50:03] honey. And as soon as I had eaten it, my
[50:08] belly was bitter. And he said unto me,
[50:11] "Thou must prophesy again before many
[50:15] peoples and nations and tongues and
[50:19] kings."
[50:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:20] &gt;&gt; Amen. And may the Lord bless the reading
[50:22] of his holy word. God bless you. May be
[50:24] seated.
[50:26] This morning we want to speak on this
[50:29] simple subject you know that I titled
[50:32] the gospel according to the bride.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:36] &gt;&gt; The gospel according to you. The gospel
[50:41] according to me. Amen.
[50:43] &gt;&gt; The gospel according to the bride.
[50:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[50:47] &gt;&gt; Now we know that the word gospel means
[50:49] good news.
[50:50] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[50:51] &gt;&gt; That's the meaning of the word gospel.
[50:53] It means good news.
[50:55] &gt;&gt; Good news. And we are living today in a
[50:58] world of bad news everywhere.
[51:02] &gt;&gt; Is bad news everywhere you turn to. You
[51:04] look everywhere on the media, on the
[51:06] radio, on the newspaper. Bad news
[51:10] everywhere. And it's becoming popular
[51:12] and is becoming more and more and more.
[51:16] &gt;&gt; You can hardly hear anything good. All
[51:19] what you are hearing is bad news.
[51:22] Although there are scientific
[51:25] advancements in the world today, but yet
[51:29] we have bad news at the end of it all.
[51:33] For it is the tree of knowledge of good
[51:36] and evil
[51:37] &gt;&gt; and is bringing bad news everywhere on
[51:41] earth. Because this is not God's Eden.
[51:45] This is Satan's Eden. Amen.
[51:47] &gt;&gt; And it has become as it was in the days
[51:50] of Sodom. You know in the days of Sodom,
[51:53] the news were flickering and the news in
[51:58] Sodom were faxing the righteous soul of
[52:01] Lot
[52:02] &gt;&gt; and they had no grace, you know, to
[52:05] speak against it because the prophet
[52:07] said that his wife wouldn't let him
[52:09] speak against it. And we have a lot of
[52:12] people today who are like m Mr. Lords.
[52:14] They are pastors on the pit. There are
[52:17] pastor in the world. There are great men
[52:19] everywhere. But they could not speak
[52:21] against you know the sin of Sodom and
[52:24] it's fixing their righteous soul. They
[52:27] don't have the grace. Their church,
[52:29] their wife, their church wouldn't allow
[52:32] them to speak against it because it's a
[52:35] meat ticket.
[52:37] is a meth ticket and there's a lot of
[52:40] compromise you know everywhere on earth
[52:42] today
[52:43] &gt;&gt; and pollusions and perversions on earth
[52:46] today and is bringing bad news
[52:49] everywhere
[52:50] &gt;&gt; but thanks be to God we are not in Sodom
[52:54] &gt;&gt; we are outside Sodom for we are not
[52:57] sodomite we are not Lite but we are
[53:00] Abramite
[53:02] &gt;&gt; and the Abraham was not in Sodom Abraham
[53:05] was outside Sodom. He was living not in
[53:09] Sodom. Therefore, the sin of Sodom. The
[53:12] news of Sodom don't affect Abraham
[53:16] didn't affect Abraham. They are not
[53:18] fixing Abraham's righteous soul.
[53:21] Hallelujah. Because he was not in Sodom.
[53:25] He was outside Sodom. And I want to tell
[53:28] you this morning, church, we are not in
[53:31] America.
[53:32] &gt;&gt; We are not living in America. We are not
[53:35] living in Canada. We don't live in
[53:38] Europe. And we don't live in Nigeria.
[53:41] The bread of Jesus Christ. We are living
[53:44] in heaven.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:46] &gt;&gt; Heaven on earth.
[53:48] &gt;&gt; That's where we live. We are living in
[53:51] heaven. We are pilgrims and we are
[53:53] strangers here. We do not belong here.
[53:56] Our own land is heaven.
[53:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[54:01] &gt;&gt; It is heaven. And I tell you tonight
[54:03] church or this morning, heaven is not a
[54:07] place that you can geographically locate
[54:11] by your compass and GPS.
[54:13] &gt;&gt; The prophet said that heaven is a
[54:16] dimension faster than here.
[54:19] &gt;&gt; And the brother it is a realm and it is
[54:22] really real and we get into heaven and
[54:27] atmosphere. Hallelujah. that was brought
[54:30] down and we are caught up into it.
[54:34] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Amen.
[54:35] &gt;&gt; The Bible said in Hebrews 12 from verse
[54:39] 22, it said, "But ye are come unto Mon
[54:43] Zion and unto the city of the living
[54:45] God, the heavenly Jerusalem, and to an
[54:48] innumerable company of angels, to the
[54:51] general, hallelujah, assembly and church
[54:54] of the firstborn, which are written in
[54:57] heaven, and to God the judge of all, and
[55:01] to the spirit of judgment made perfect,
[55:04] and to Jesus Jesus the mediator of the
[55:07] new covenant and to the blood of
[55:10] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[55:12] than that of. Amen. Hallelujah.
[55:16] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord.
[55:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:18] &gt;&gt; What a place to live.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; What a place to dwell.
[55:22] &gt;&gt; What a place to abide. Heaven not just a
[55:25] geographical, you know, place.
[55:28] &gt;&gt; It's not a place that you travel and you
[55:30] go to by GPS
[55:32] &gt;&gt; or you go to by your compacts. But
[55:34] brother, a faster dimension that is
[55:37] beyond modern science. Hallelujah. Is an
[55:40] atmosphere is being brought down, you
[55:43] know, unto us. And we are caught up into
[55:46] it. And right now, the Bible said in the
[55:50] book of Ephesians chapter 1 from verse 1
[55:52] to3 that we are in heavenly places in
[55:56] Christ Jesus.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[55:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. We don't sit here this
[56:01] morning in send the light church
[56:05] &gt;&gt; phantom Michigan. We don't sit here this
[56:08] morning. Are you hearing in church in
[56:10] Michigan in United States? We are
[56:13] sitting here this morning in heavenly
[56:15] places in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah.
[56:19] &gt;&gt; And how do we get in there? By one
[56:21] spirit. We are all baptized into one
[56:24] body. By the Holy Ghost, we get into the
[56:27] heavenly places. And that's where we are
[56:29] sitting this morning. And there's
[56:30] nothing that can pull us down
[56:34] &gt;&gt; for is our predestinated place.
[56:37] &gt;&gt; Is our place
[56:39] &gt;&gt; predestinated place.
[56:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing can affect you
[56:43] there. Nothing can bother you there.
[56:46] Nothing can bring you down there.
[56:48] &gt;&gt; You are in your places in Christ.
[56:52] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. is our place and it belongs
[56:56] to us and we living there. Amen. And we
[56:59] are hearing from whom every day. So how
[57:04] can you live in such a place and be
[57:07] bothered by the news going on around
[57:09] here?
[57:11] &gt;&gt; You don't hear them.
[57:13] &gt;&gt; You are beyond them.
[57:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You are beyond them. You are
[57:18] in the presence of the angels of God.
[57:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:21] &gt;&gt; Oh, amen. innerble companies of angels
[57:24] and you are feeling the pull. You are
[57:26] hearing from whom like our precious
[57:28] brother Paul used to sing. You know I
[57:30] feel the pull. Brother Paul a Fontaine.
[57:33] He said I feel the pull. I hear the
[57:35] call. I believe you feel the pull this
[57:38] morning.
[57:38] &gt;&gt; You hear the call this morning.
[57:40] Hallelujah. And then let me tell this
[57:42] brothers and sister. Brother Abraham
[57:44] said there was a boy. A little boy was
[57:46] flying the kite and he could not see the
[57:49] kite. And then you say, "Little boy,
[57:51] what are you doing?" I'm flying the
[57:52] kite. He said, "But where is the kite?"
[57:55] "You couldn't see it." He said, "No, I
[57:58] couldn't see it." He said, "Bet, I can
[58:01] feel it tugging.
[58:03] &gt;&gt; I can feel it pulling." And brother, you
[58:06] may not be able to see heaven with your
[58:08] naked eye. You may not be able to see
[58:10] with your 2020. But brother, down deep
[58:13] within your heart, there is a pull
[58:15] there. You can feel it pulling. You can
[58:19] feel it tugging. Hallelujah. And in as
[58:22] much as you can feel it, brother, that
[58:24] is our name.
[58:28] &gt;&gt; I feel it pulling.
[58:31] &gt;&gt; There's a voice calling in
[58:34] &gt;&gt; from the whole rug tree. Hallelujah.
[58:37] Somebody,
[58:38] &gt;&gt; are you with me this morning?
[58:40] &gt;&gt; There is somebody. There is a voice.

[58:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[58:55] &gt;&gt; I'm hearing from home. And I want to
[58:58] tell you this morning, how long have you
[59:00] heard from home last? Did you hear from
[59:03] home?
[59:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:04] &gt;&gt; Have you heard from home?
[59:05] &gt;&gt; Did you read the word of God? Did you
[59:07] pray?
[59:08] &gt;&gt; Did you wait on God?

[59:55] them all the way from above.
[59:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:58] &gt;&gt; That's all what I hear.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's what I hear and
[1:00:03] that's what I'm hearing this morning and
[1:00:05] that's what I will hear tomorrow. It
[1:00:07] doesn't mean you know that you have to
[1:00:08] be in church before you can hear good
[1:00:10] news from home.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:11] &gt;&gt; You must hear it constantly.
[1:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Every day of your life, every
[1:00:16] moment of your life. Amen. Oh, praise
[1:00:19] God.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:20] &gt;&gt; There is something in my soul which gave
[1:00:24] me joy all along. Hallelujah.
[1:00:26] &gt;&gt; It is love. My savior's love.
[1:00:30] &gt;&gt; Something lightens everybody.
[1:00:33] Hallelujah.
[1:00:34] &gt;&gt; It lightens everybody.
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:38] &gt;&gt; It takes all the burdens away.
[1:00:40] &gt;&gt; I'm hearing from home. I'm hearing from
[1:00:43] home. Angels.
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because we are in the present, the
[1:00:48] Bible says, of angels. That's where you
[1:00:50] live, church.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; You don't live in America. Remember
[1:00:54] that.
[1:00:55] &gt;&gt; Hebrews chapter 12 says you are living
[1:00:58] in heaven.
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:01:02] &gt;&gt; You are living in heaven. Oh, praise the
[1:01:05] Lord. And that is the way should be.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. But brothers,
[1:01:12] bad news
[1:01:14] started in Genesis.
[1:01:18] &gt;&gt; That's where bad news started from. It
[1:01:20] started in Genesis. It was good news all
[1:01:22] along.
[1:01:24] It was good news.
[1:01:32] The songwriter says,
[1:01:35] songs of praise, I woke the moon. Amen.
[1:01:40] When God spake and it was done, that was
[1:01:44] songs of praise. Like Job, when God was
[1:01:48] speaking to Job, he said, "Where were
[1:01:50] you?"
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Where were you when I laid the
[1:01:54] foundation stone, the cornerstone of
[1:01:56] this earth and the sons of God and
[1:01:59] shouting for joy? Hallelujah. He said,
[1:02:02] "Where were you?"
[1:02:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; Not bad news,
[1:02:08] &gt;&gt; not sad news, no sorrow, no regret,
[1:02:13] &gt;&gt; good news,
[1:02:15] &gt;&gt; all the way from foundation of the
[1:02:17] world.
[1:02:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm happy tonight,
[1:02:20] church, or this morning, church, to know
[1:02:23] that my name is written in the lamb's
[1:02:25] book of life before the foundation of
[1:02:28] the world. Therefore, I was there
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; shouting for joy.
[1:02:34] &gt;&gt; We were there in the mind of God. We
[1:02:37] were there when this earth
[1:02:41] was made.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; Yes,
[1:02:43] &gt;&gt; we are older than the earth. Because for
[1:02:47] you to witness it, you have to behold
[1:02:50] her.
[1:02:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:51] &gt;&gt; And that's why brothers, you know, we
[1:02:53] are from eternity.
[1:02:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:55] &gt;&gt; And we came down into time.
[1:02:57] &gt;&gt; And the brother, we are going back.
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Are you hearing me in church?
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:03:04] &gt;&gt; So therefore, you know, it was good
[1:03:06] news. Good news. Then you go to Genesis
[1:03:10] chapters 1 and two. The Bible made us to
[1:03:13] understand you know that when God
[1:03:14] started to create this world remember
[1:03:18] that the Bible says in the beginning God
[1:03:21] created the heavens and the earth.
[1:03:23] Period.
[1:03:24] &gt;&gt; Then God now took six days to transform
[1:03:29] the chaotic word
[1:03:32] &gt;&gt; the word of deluge onto a respplent one.
[1:03:36] &gt;&gt; It took six days. The prophet said it
[1:03:39] doesn't take God six days. He said, "But
[1:03:41] God took six days."
[1:03:45] &gt;&gt; God could do it immediately.
[1:03:48] &gt;&gt; Within a moment, he can do it, but he
[1:03:51] took six days. Each day a thousand year
[1:03:55] &gt;&gt; and he took it. And the Bible says the
[1:03:57] first day was good news.
[1:04:00] &gt;&gt; On the first day and it was good. Second
[1:04:04] day and it was good. Third day and it
[1:04:07] was good. Good news.
[1:04:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:10] Good news. Come on somebody. This
[1:04:14] &gt;&gt; good news.
[1:04:15] &gt;&gt; Fourth day it was good. Fifth day it was
[1:04:18] good. On the sixth day the Bible say it
[1:04:21] was very good. Can I hear you say very
[1:04:24] good?
[1:04:25] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:04:26] &gt;&gt; Can I hear you say very good?
[1:04:28] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Very good.
[1:04:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:04:32] &gt;&gt; Why was it very good?
[1:04:35] Because you know God had something in
[1:04:36] his mind.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. And what God had in his mind
[1:04:39] before the foundation of the world was
[1:04:42] to bring a man here on earth that we
[1:04:45] live and exercise authority over this
[1:04:48] earth. When God will be his father, he
[1:04:52] will be the son of God, an offspring of
[1:04:55] God.
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; Reflecting God on earth.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. An amature God on her. And
[1:05:02] that was the man Adam. So he was made in
[1:05:05] the image of God. And when we have that
[1:05:08] man on earth in the image of God with
[1:05:11] power and faith to use it, it was the
[1:05:14] masterpiece of God on earth. And the God
[1:05:17] was so happy. Hallelujah. Until the
[1:05:20] report says it was very good,
[1:05:26] &gt;&gt; good news.
[1:05:30] &gt;&gt; Unheard.
[1:05:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen.
[1:05:37] &gt;&gt; And when that man was here on earth,
[1:05:39] supernatural manifestation was the order
[1:05:41] of the day.
[1:05:43] &gt;&gt; That was his nature.
[1:05:46] It was supernatural manifestation. A
[1:05:48] regular routine.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; A regular routine. A way of life.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:05:54] &gt;&gt; Was supernatural. It Oh, praise the
[1:05:57] Lord. Adam,
[1:06:00] it doesn't need to construct bridge
[1:06:03] or bridges in order for him to walk over
[1:06:06] the lake Michigan
[1:06:08] &gt;&gt; or any other body of water on here. He
[1:06:11] doesn't need to do that. It doesn't need
[1:06:14] to go to America embassy or any other
[1:06:18] embassy to obtain visa and go to the
[1:06:22] airlines and pay ticket you know and fly
[1:06:25] plane to come down to United States from
[1:06:28] Nigeria like brother Gideon
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; it doesn't need to do that
[1:06:35] &gt;&gt; hallelujah
[1:06:38] he thought it is there
[1:06:40] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; it was just traveling like a thought
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:06:44] That was Adam. He can walk on water.
[1:06:47] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; He can travel like a T.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nothing bothers him. Nothing
[1:06:52] hurt him.
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; He was a bonafide son of God.
[1:06:56] &gt;&gt; With authority and power.
[1:06:59] &gt;&gt; He was God's scientist.
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Oh my. Are you hearing me now? There was
[1:07:08] a time that faith was in action.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. It was first civilization.
[1:07:15] Nothing to halt, nothing to destroy,
[1:07:18] nothing to bother. God on the seed in
[1:07:20] the form of Adam. Hallelujah.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; He was leading lion and cheetah
[1:07:30] like a pet.
[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; Brother Mike told me, bro, don't be
[1:07:36] afraid.
[1:07:38] This dog is royer.
[1:07:43] When I heard the name Rottweiler,
[1:07:46] oh man, I said, "This dog must be very
[1:07:49] wild."
[1:07:52] He scared me and he was telling me not
[1:07:54] to be afraid.
[1:07:56] Rottweiler,
[1:07:58] he said, "Bro, no." He said, "This dog
[1:08:00] will not haunt you. It won't hurt you."
[1:08:03] He said, "Because
[1:08:05] I will I I will bring the dog. It won't
[1:08:07] hurt you. You the dog will know." And
[1:08:10] the door came and it was just leaking.
[1:08:13] Oh my. I was just standing by faith.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:21] &gt;&gt; He said, "Brogide, it won't hurt." Is if
[1:08:23] I tell this dog to you, it will hurt
[1:08:25] you. But I I train the dogs. It won't
[1:08:29] hurt you. Just don't worry, bro. It I
[1:08:32] said, "Okay."
[1:08:34] So I I I took it
[1:08:37] by faith.
[1:08:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:42] Adam needs to need not to be scared of
[1:08:46] anything.
[1:08:47] &gt;&gt; Not even lion. Not even
[1:08:53] He doesn't have to be afraid.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:56] &gt;&gt; He has power over them. He rules over
[1:08:59] them. He governs them.
[1:09:02] But one day,
[1:09:05] one day another scientist came,
[1:09:10] another scientist came.
[1:09:13] And this scientist that came came and
[1:09:15] preached another gospel.
[1:09:22] &gt;&gt; He came to preach another gospel.
[1:09:26] the gospel
[1:09:28] according to another scientist.
[1:09:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; And the prophet said it was wisdom
[1:09:38] versus faith.
[1:09:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:09:42] &gt;&gt; That was why he preached. He came to
[1:09:44] preach wisdom. That old serpent, the
[1:09:48] devil,
[1:09:51] &gt;&gt; he was a robber, a thief.
[1:09:54] And the Bible said a thief came to ruin
[1:09:58] and to destroy.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:01] &gt;&gt; And he came in through the woman.
[1:10:06] He couldn't come through the man
[1:10:09] because that man was in the image of
[1:10:11] God.
[1:10:12] &gt;&gt; He was infallible.
[1:10:15] &gt;&gt; He cannot be deceived.
[1:10:17] &gt;&gt; But the woman can be deceived. And he
[1:10:19] came through the woman and preached
[1:10:23] another gospel.
[1:10:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:26] &gt;&gt; Like Apostle Paul call it,
[1:10:29] another gospel to this woman.
[1:10:32] And the woman said amen to it and
[1:10:35] believed it and fell for it.
[1:10:37] &gt;&gt; Yes, that's right.
[1:10:42] &gt;&gt; And the man came and met the woman
[1:10:46] falling.
[1:10:47] Adam saw the woman, she was already a
[1:10:51] fallen woman.
[1:10:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:54] &gt;&gt; Before Adam ever knew the woman, she was
[1:10:59] already a fallen woman,
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; a fallen church
[1:11:05] by traditions of man,
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; by another gospel, deceivers.
[1:11:12] &gt;&gt; And brother Brown told us, you know,
[1:11:14] that there's going to be deceivers of
[1:11:15] the third bride. Amen.
[1:11:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. He said, "For this is the
[1:11:19] third bride. The first bride was
[1:11:23] deceived." That was Adam's bride.
[1:11:26] &gt;&gt; And the second bride was Jehovah's
[1:11:29] bride, which was the nation of Israel.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; And the third bride, we are the bride.
[1:11:35] &gt;&gt; The bride of the second Adam. But
[1:11:37] brother, the deceiver of the third bride
[1:11:40] are here today to preach another gospel.
[1:11:44] But brothers and sister, you and I, we
[1:11:47] have been predestinated
[1:11:49] not to fall
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; before the foundation of the world.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; We were ordained,
[1:11:57] &gt;&gt; predestinated
[1:11:58] not to fall. We are infallible this
[1:12:01] morning.
[1:12:04] &gt;&gt; Come on. How many of you believe that?
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:12:10] Praise the Lord.
[1:12:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. another gospel.
[1:12:15] This scientist came
[1:12:18] and he started to preach another gospel
[1:12:21] like we have a lot of them today on
[1:12:23] earth preaching you know
[1:12:26] their wisdom preaching their
[1:12:28] understanding leaning to their own
[1:12:30] understanding.
[1:12:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:33] &gt;&gt; Going you know to Facebook and Google
[1:12:36] and WhatsApp and internet trying you
[1:12:38] know to bring confusions. Hallelujah.
[1:12:41] Oh, praise the Lord. Trying to send, you
[1:12:44] know, that bride back to delusion
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; and a state of deluge. That was what,
[1:12:51] you know, their mind was all about and
[1:12:53] not that gospel.
[1:12:56] Amen. They are scientists anyway.
[1:13:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me, brothers?
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; But brothers, we are scientists also. We
[1:13:04] are scientists. Amen. The prophet said,
[1:13:07] spiritual scientist. Amen.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; That's what we are. We are God's
[1:13:11] astronauts. Amen. We are spiritual
[1:13:15] scientists. Amen. And we are in God's
[1:13:18] laboratory to tap the inexhaustible
[1:13:22] resources.
[1:13:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Whereas the natural scientists
[1:13:27] today, the prophet said they broke into
[1:13:30] God's laboratory
[1:13:32] &gt;&gt; and they are fooling themselves to kill
[1:13:34] themselves.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; The same thing to the devil.
[1:13:38] in the garden of Eden, you know, that
[1:13:40] came through the serpent unto the woman.
[1:13:43] Hallelujah. To preach another gospel in
[1:13:46] order, you know, to pervert the true
[1:13:49] gospel.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:51] &gt;&gt; And any man who broke into another
[1:13:54] people's home or property is a robber
[1:13:57] and a thief.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; And it should be mercilessly dealt with.
[1:14:03] Are you here, church?
[1:14:04] &gt;&gt; And that's what the devil was. Satan
[1:14:07] their father is a thief and a robber.
[1:14:10] He's a liar. He only came to kill and to
[1:14:13] destroy. Amen. Let me tell brothers and
[1:14:16] sisters, there's no need for you, you
[1:14:18] know, to be worried. There's no need for
[1:14:21] you to be disturbed. There's no need for
[1:14:23] you, Hallelujah, to be weary and to be
[1:14:26] weak and to be tired. You take
[1:14:28] possession of that which belongs to you.
[1:14:32] God's laboratory is your possession.
[1:14:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:36] Every blessing in the book belongs to
[1:14:39] you. Every book in the every blessing in
[1:14:42] the storehouse belongs to you.
[1:14:44] Hallelujah. There's healing there. There
[1:14:46] is blessing there. There is victory
[1:14:49] there. Hallelujah. Inexhaustible
[1:14:52] resources that are there are ours.
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. We are not fooling around with
[1:15:02] nothing.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's right. We are claiming that which
[1:15:05] belongs to us.
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Is our possession. Amen.
[1:15:10] Oh, praise the Lord. You love him this
[1:15:13] morning.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; It belongs to us.
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Healing belongs to us.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost belongs to us.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; The prophet says children's bread. It
[1:15:23] belongs to us. The spoken word belongs
[1:15:24] to us. The thoughtful manifestations
[1:15:27] belong to us. It is ours, brothers.
[1:15:30] Amen. And don't you never be confused.
[1:15:33] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Be not dismayed at the
[1:15:40] signs of heaven."
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; For the hidden are dismayed at these
[1:15:44] things.
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Don't be confused when you see things
[1:15:48] happening everywhere.
[1:15:51] Don't be confused. The devil has
[1:15:54] invented things.
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:15:58] And those things that the devil has
[1:15:59] infected, remember we have them
[1:16:04] at our tip today.
[1:16:07] We use the good part, we drop the bad
[1:16:09] part is knowledge of good and evil.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; That's the truth. That's what science
[1:16:16] is. And the brother, I don't care what
[1:16:18] the science says. Hallelujah. I come
[1:16:21] back to what the world says. I come back
[1:16:23] to the gospel. I come back to the
[1:16:25] original. Hallelujah. I come back.
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:16:32] Praise the Lord. Oh my.
[1:16:35] Now we find out that he corrupted the
[1:16:38] world by his wisdom. And Eve fell for
[1:16:41] it. And Adam was not deceived, but Adam,
[1:16:45] you know, went in there with his 2020.
[1:16:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:16:49] &gt;&gt; Playing the role of a savior to bring
[1:16:52] back the woman.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:53] &gt;&gt; That was Adam. She was not deceived. No,
[1:16:56] she was not deceived. Hallelujah. You
[1:16:59] love him this morning.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Praise the Lord.
[1:17:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You love him this morning.
[1:17:06] &gt;&gt; Adam went in there, you know, to bring
[1:17:08] her back. But Adam
[1:17:11] in the process of playing the role of a
[1:17:13] savior for the woman
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; because she loved her.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. thereby sed his possession
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; for fated
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; everything.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; That was what Adam did.
[1:17:33] And then that was how
[1:17:36] good news
[1:17:38] &gt;&gt; ended.
[1:17:40] That was the end of good news. And then
[1:17:43] the prophet of the almighty God says
[1:17:45] when everything fell, he said then hers
[1:17:49] went back home weeping.
[1:17:58] &gt;&gt; Your son is lost.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; But Abraham said angels went back home
[1:18:05] weeping.
[1:18:06] Your son is lost.
[1:18:09] Bad news.
[1:18:12] Amen.
[1:18:15] &gt;&gt; Thanks be to God for our heavenly
[1:18:17] father. For God so loved the world.
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. God so loved the world that
[1:18:23] when God had it, God came down. In
[1:18:27] Genesis in chapter three, God himself,
[1:18:30] he came down. He never sent another man.
[1:18:33] He came down. Heaven came down. God came
[1:18:36] down.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Woo. Glory.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:18:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; And God came down
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; and he had a conference
[1:18:49] right there in the Garden of Eden.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; And at the conference, there was a
[1:18:54] conclusion reached.
[1:18:56] &gt;&gt; And the conclusion was Genesis 3:15. The
[1:19:00] seed of the woman shall bruise the head
[1:19:03] of the serpent, and the seed of the
[1:19:06] serpent shall bruise the heel of the
[1:19:08] seed of the woman. Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:19:11] praise the Lord.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:14] &gt;&gt; Oh my, what a wonderful news. Again,
[1:19:19] is brutal, but it's news.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; And I will see from the scripture this
[1:19:26] morning.
[1:19:28] Amen.
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; For God said there will be a seed of the
[1:19:31] woman. And that was why Genesis 3:15,
[1:19:36] which was the seed of God, the spoken
[1:19:39] word, you know, has to find a place
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; for is the spoken word and it must be
[1:19:47] quickened.
[1:19:50] &gt;&gt; And Isaiah in chapter 7:14,
[1:19:54] he caught that.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And then when Isaiah caught
[1:19:59] that, then what did he do?
[1:20:02] He said, "Behold, a virgin shall
[1:20:05] conceive."
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; A virgin shall conceived. Oh, what a
[1:20:11] glorious thing.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Genesis 3:15
[1:20:16] produces
[1:20:18] Isaiah 7:14.
[1:20:21] &gt;&gt; And Isaiah 7:14 produces Matthew
[1:20:27] 1 and two.
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] And the angel
[1:20:35] &gt;&gt; said unto the woman
[1:20:39] over there in the book of Luke in
[1:20:40] chapter
[1:20:42] two at the birth of Jesus Christ he said
[1:20:45] hey Mary you are highly faithful.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; Are you here with me?
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; And he said
[1:20:54] you shall give birth to a child. He
[1:20:56] said, "How shall these things be seen
[1:20:57] that I know not?"
[1:21:00] He said, "The power
[1:21:03] of the highest."
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:21:05] &gt;&gt; Shall I overshadow thee
[1:21:07] &gt;&gt; is an overshadowing power.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; There's going to be a creation,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; a creation that Mary knew nothing about,
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; That Mary did not contribute nothing.
[1:21:19] No egg, no nothing, no h. But God
[1:21:22] created the eggs and the the the seed
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; and deposited inside the woman that
[1:21:29] should pass through the woman and the
[1:21:31] passing through the woman it will become
[1:21:34] our brother.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:36] &gt;&gt; Because when it passes through the
[1:21:38] woman, are you hearing me? You know,
[1:21:40] then it becomes our brother.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; For is now a king's man
[1:21:46] to ros.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Without him passing through
[1:21:49] the woman, he will not be able, you
[1:21:51] know, to die. In Genesis chapter 3, God
[1:21:54] cannot die.
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; In Genesis chapter 14, when he was here
[1:21:59] on earth in the form of Theophanic
[1:22:01] Mechisedc, he cannot die.
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; But brother, in the book of Matthew,
[1:22:08] when God became flesh,
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; and dwell among us,
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; he was our brother. That's why you know
[1:22:16] the same God in Genesis chapter 3 that
[1:22:18] came down is the same God again in
[1:22:21] Matthew is God. God God is our redeemer.
[1:22:26] There's no any other person that can
[1:22:28] redeem. It has to be God himself.
[1:22:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:33] &gt;&gt; And he came down in the form of the
[1:22:35] flesh.
[1:22:37] Pay the price.
[1:22:40] He came down and died. God. Oh brothers,
[1:22:47] when he was born, the Bible says Luke
[1:22:51] chapter 2 from verse 8, what did it says
[1:22:55] there? I mean Luke chapter 2. Yes, the
[1:22:57] angel
[1:22:59] in the book of Luke chapter 2, I think.
[1:23:05] Praise the Lord. Oh my. Yes.
[1:23:10] In verse eight, he said,
[1:23:14] "And there were shepherd."
[1:23:17] Amen. Look at it. There were shepherd.
[1:23:21] Somebody, are you with me?
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; He said, "And there were in the same
[1:23:25] country, shepherds
[1:23:28] abiding in the field, keeping watch over
[1:23:31] their flock by night. And Lord, the
[1:23:33] angel of the Lord came upon them. And
[1:23:36] the glory of the Lord shone round about
[1:23:40] them, and they were sure afraid. And the
[1:23:42] angel said unto them, Fear not,
[1:23:47] for behold, I bring you good tidings of
[1:23:51] great joy,
[1:23:52] &gt;&gt; Amen,
[1:23:53] &gt;&gt; which shall be to all people. For unto
[1:23:56] you is born this day in the city of
[1:23:59] David a Savior, which is Christ the
[1:24:03] Lord.
[1:24:06] Glory to God.
[1:24:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Somebody say amen.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; The good news
[1:24:15] is back on earth again.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; At the birth of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:24:22] when he was born right there in
[1:24:24] Bethlehem in the city of David, the
[1:24:27] angel came down and the angel told the
[1:24:30] shepherd, he said, "Fear not.
[1:24:33] There's nothing to be worried about.
[1:24:35] There's nothing to be afraid about.
[1:24:37] Can't you see, brothers and sisters, he
[1:24:39] has to first of all tell them, "Fear
[1:24:42] not."
[1:24:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Every time, "Fear not."
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Each time that the angel is
[1:24:48] bringing good news, brothers and
[1:24:50] sisters, is fear not.
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; There's going to be good news here, fear
[1:24:55] not. Amen. Fear not. I bring you good
[1:25:00] tidings of great joy
[1:25:03] which shall be to all people. All
[1:25:07] people. Amen. Amen.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Good news
[1:25:13] &gt;&gt; is back on earth again.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:16] &gt;&gt; You see how he works. So therefore you
[1:25:19] know when the good news came back to the
[1:25:21] earth then brother but Abraham said
[1:25:25] that was good news
[1:25:29] when Jesus Christ was born the message
[1:25:31] it is the rising of the sun.
[1:25:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Listen to what the prophet said.
[1:25:36] It is the rising of the sun.
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; It was good news.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 60. It said no wonder the
[1:25:45] gospel is good news. He said the very
[1:25:48] word gospel means the good news.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; The good news what if a man died for our
[1:25:53] sake that's good news. If Christ was
[1:25:57] born that's good news. Yes.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; But never a news,
[1:26:04] never was there news like this news that
[1:26:08] he who made the promise has confirmed
[1:26:12] the promise that is alive forever more
[1:26:16] and have the keys of both death and hell
[1:26:19] in his hand. All the gloom was shook
[1:26:23] away. There was no more gloom to be seen
[1:26:26] for the sun was up from the grave. There
[1:26:28] was no well he will come or he may come.
[1:26:32] He are already come.
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; The good news the gospel good news.
[1:26:37] Norice the very message of the gospel
[1:26:39] itself is to prove to the people that he
[1:26:42] is risen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He is risen.
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; Oh my God.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:26:54] &gt;&gt; He is risen. God tell my disciple that
[1:26:57] I'm risen from the dead and I will meet
[1:27:00] with them to confirm this to them.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Oh God, how in this last days there
[1:27:06] shall be light again across the earth
[1:27:08] and I will prove to my disciples. Go
[1:27:11] tell them that I am not dead and I'm not
[1:27:14] a tradition but I am a living Christ. I
[1:27:17] will meet them. Take this message to my
[1:27:20] disciples that I am risen from the dead.
[1:27:23] The gospel good news. You say, "Is that
[1:27:26] right?"
[1:27:29] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8 said is the same yesterday,
[1:27:33] today, and forever. We is beneficiaries
[1:27:36] are to prove his life in us now. The
[1:27:40] beneficiaries of this life. The life
[1:27:42] there never was a life lived like it. He
[1:27:45] was the son of God and he died and that
[1:27:48] shut it out. But when he raise again
[1:27:51] from the dead on Easter morning, then we
[1:27:54] as his servant are commissioned by him
[1:27:56] to go into all the world and to bring
[1:27:58] this good news to every person
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; that is are living. How can we and how
[1:28:03] can we do it by word only?
[1:28:07] For it is written, the gospel came not
[1:28:11] by word only, but through the power and
[1:28:14] the manifestation of the Holy Spirit to
[1:28:16] prove that he is alive.
[1:28:21] &gt;&gt; Glory.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Good news, brother. Good news, sister.
[1:28:26] To you and I.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; That when he was born that the angel
[1:28:32] said, "Good news."
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:28:36] good tidings of great joy.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; And when he died, he said, I have power
[1:28:41] to lay down my life and to take it up
[1:28:43] again. And brother Abraham said, Christ
[1:28:46] zeroed in at Calvary and wounded that
[1:28:50] animal called Satan forever.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; And he brought light to human race that
[1:28:56] because I live, you shall live also.
[1:28:59] &gt;&gt; Good news.
[1:29:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:02] No wonder
[1:29:05] the prophet said
[1:29:08] when Jesus Christ died and rose again,
[1:29:12] he said that was the greatest news flash
[1:29:16] in history.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; The greatest news flash in the history.
[1:29:24] Hallelujah. What is it, brother? In John
[1:29:27] in Revelation chapter 5, we saw the the
[1:29:31] the the the
[1:29:33] picture of the event. You know how it
[1:29:37] happened? Oh man. When the when when the
[1:29:41] redeemer walk forth and took the book
[1:29:46] and he said I am the worthy one to take
[1:29:49] that book and to lose the services
[1:29:52] thereof. Hallelujah. And the book cannot
[1:29:54] be uh uh opened and cannot be the seven
[1:29:58] seals cannot be loosed. The book cannot
[1:30:00] be opened without the blood.
[1:30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; Of the redeemer.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:06] &gt;&gt; And his blood Amen. You know opened the
[1:30:10] book. He opened the book. And then when
[1:30:14] the redeemer took the book, what
[1:30:16] happened?
[1:30:18] Something happened in heaven.
[1:30:20] Because
[1:30:22] before that time when there was no one
[1:30:25] worthy to take the book or to lose the
[1:30:27] services thereof, John said, "I wept."
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; It was bad news.
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; I wept.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; I wept bad news
[1:30:43] because we will all be lost.
[1:30:49] But brothers and sisters, one of the
[1:30:51] elders told John, he said, "We have non
[1:30:55] &gt;&gt; pastor John,
[1:30:57] are you here with me?"
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; And I'm not just only talking to you
[1:31:02] because John represent the entire bride.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They predestinated.
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; We acknowledge John.
[1:31:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:14] But the land of the tribe of Judah had
[1:31:17] prevailed to take the book and to lose
[1:31:19] the seven sees thereof. And the John
[1:31:21] said, I turned around to see the lamb, I
[1:31:25] mean the lion of the tribe of Judah. But
[1:31:27] he saw the lamb because that was the
[1:31:30] time hallelujah of redemption. Oh my.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. And at that time there
[1:31:37] was jubilee in heaven because bad news
[1:31:40] turned to good news. Amen.
[1:31:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Our bad news turned into
[1:31:46] good news. And but Abraham said in the
[1:31:48] message,
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; yes.
[1:31:51] &gt;&gt; A man running away from the presence of
[1:31:53] the Lord, he said, I believe, I am
[1:31:56] prophesying.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; He's a great mystery will be made clear
[1:32:01] and the saddening heart will be turned
[1:32:03] to joy.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Oh brother, this is the day, hallelujah,
[1:32:08] of good news to the bride. This is the
[1:32:11] day that our sadness is turning to joy.
[1:32:15] This is the day that our sorrow is
[1:32:17] becoming happiness. Brother, this is not
[1:32:20] the time to frown our faces.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; This is not the time to be sorry.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; This is the day of jubilee.
[1:32:32] &gt;&gt; And there was jubilee in heaven.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; Shouting in heaven at the taking of the
[1:32:38] book by the lamb. And brother, it was
[1:32:41] good news. And I'm telling you this
[1:32:43] morning, church, the book was not just
[1:32:45] only taken, but the book has been
[1:32:47] revealed unto the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:32:50] in this last days. And brother, this is
[1:32:53] not just a story. This is not just a
[1:32:55] meat. This is not just a makeup. This is
[1:32:58] the living reality of the living God
[1:33:01] that we can see in our day today.
[1:33:03] Brothers and sisters, rejoice, rejoice,
[1:33:07] rejoice, rejoice. This is the day of
[1:33:11] joy.
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:33:14] &gt;&gt; It's happy day.
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; This is happy day, brother.
[1:33:18] &gt;&gt; Happy day, sister. Joyful day.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. God's prophet said sad
[1:33:29] heart will be turned into joy. And I'm
[1:33:33] telling you, brothers, there's no need
[1:33:35] for you to weep. Weep no more, brothers,
[1:33:37] sister. Weep not, brothers. Weep not,
[1:33:40] sister. No matter how rough, no matter
[1:33:43] how bad, no matter how Oh, brother. No
[1:33:46] matter what the doctor said.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; The doctor's report is not your death
[1:33:53] sentence.
[1:33:55] That was the doctor's report based on
[1:33:58] the doctor's lesson in the school
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; and is basing that report on the word
[1:34:05] that he learned in the school and
[1:34:07] according to science book. Amen. And
[1:34:10] brothers, I have the science book here
[1:34:13] with me this morning. The book of the
[1:34:15] great physician is here with me this
[1:34:18] morning. And this book says, "By my
[1:34:20] stripes you were healed."
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:26] Hallelujah.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Is the same yesterday, today, and
[1:34:29] forever.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:31] &gt;&gt; Rejoice.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; The book says, "All things are
[1:34:39] possible."
[1:34:40] &gt;&gt; Tell me one thing that is not possible
[1:34:42] this morning. The death could be raised.
[1:34:45] Is it possible?
[1:34:46] &gt;&gt; All things are possible.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, brother. Cancer.
[1:34:51] All things are possible. TB all things
[1:34:54] are possible. Come on somebody. Corona
[1:34:57] virus all things are possible regardless
[1:35:00] of the situation of the circumstance. No
[1:35:02] matter how bad how was your situation
[1:35:07] all things are possible. That is what
[1:35:10] the doctor's book says.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; I believe the scientist
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; the great physician.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I'm doubting what the
[1:35:21] headlessly scientist says
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; because you cannot believe the true
[1:35:25] report. That's why you know Isaiah said
[1:35:28] who had believe our report and to who
[1:35:30] was the hand of the Lord revealed. I'm
[1:35:33] here to tell you this morning who had
[1:35:35] believe our report. This is the report.
[1:35:38] This is the good news. This is my
[1:35:40] message. Who had believe our report
[1:35:44] Michigan. Do you believe the report?
[1:35:46] Amen.
[1:35:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:35:52] Praise the Lord. All glory.
[1:35:57] Amen. All the good news.
[1:36:01] The greatest news flies in history.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today,
[1:36:08] and forever. Amen.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ is the only good news,
[1:36:16] the only gospel.
[1:36:18] Amen. That is the only gospel. The only
[1:36:22] gospel is Christ himself.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[1:36:30] They are just writers
[1:36:34] of the gospel.
[1:36:36] That's why those gospels are called the
[1:36:39] gospel according to Matthew,
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; the gospel according to Mark, the gospel
[1:36:46] according to Luke, the gospel according
[1:36:49] to John.
[1:36:51] They were called the four synoptic
[1:36:54] gospel.
[1:36:56] That's the synopsis
[1:36:58] of bereie gospel,
[1:37:00] the abstract, the writing of the gospel.
[1:37:05] And that's why Matthew looked at him and
[1:37:07] he saw him as the king. Mark said he's
[1:37:10] the sacrifice. Luke said he's the
[1:37:13] prophet, the son of man. And the John
[1:37:15] said is the deity.
[1:37:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; The word made flesh.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Because they were looking from different
[1:37:23] angles.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:24] &gt;&gt; At the same gospel.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:26] &gt;&gt; And they can see him. And brothers, I
[1:37:30] want to tell you this morning, look at
[1:37:32] live. Look at the gospel. Look at Jesus.
[1:37:36] Oh, hallelujah. For if I be lifted up
[1:37:39] from the earth, I would draw all men
[1:37:41] unto me. Look, brother. Look, sister.
[1:37:44] Look and live. Look and see your savior.
[1:37:46] Look and see your healer. Look and see
[1:37:49] your blesser. Hallelujah.
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; Look and see your victory. Brother
[1:37:54] James, God bless you, brother.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:58] &gt;&gt; Look,
[1:37:59] look.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; Look,
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; you love him this morning. Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; And brothers,
[1:38:07] John saw him as deity.
[1:38:10] Amen. Because John was an eagle. And the
[1:38:15] we are here.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; I believe you believe.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Because those four gospel or those five
[1:38:22] gospelers or the synoptic writers of the
[1:38:25] gospel, are you with me now?
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; They are under different anointing.
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; Yes. And the Matthew came under the
[1:38:34] anointing of the lion.
[1:38:35] &gt;&gt; Are you with me now?
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; Mark came under the hawks
[1:38:39] &gt;&gt; and the Luke under the anointing of man
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; and the those anointing were you know
[1:38:44] put in different hedges and they each
[1:38:47] age preach the gospel
[1:38:51] under the anointing that was released
[1:38:52] upon them.
[1:38:53] &gt;&gt; And the brother the anointing that was
[1:38:55] released upon this age
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; was eagle. flying eagle
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; and that that was John and that that was
[1:39:04] why John can see him as deity made flesh
[1:39:09] and I tell you this morning brothers and
[1:39:11] sister deity is not in heaven deity is
[1:39:15] in you
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; is in you this morning

[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; We are preaching
[1:39:37] through God
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; in this age with his omnipotent.
[1:39:44] Amen. That's what we are preaching.
[1:39:46] That's what we represent.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. In this age,
[1:39:50] this bride has a gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:39:54] the same yesterday, today and forever.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Of Christ in me,
[1:39:59] the hope of glory.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; For in the days of the voice of the
[1:40:04] seventh angel. Is that the message of
[1:40:06] the hour? Yes, sir. The mystery mystery
[1:40:10] of God should be finished as he had
[1:40:14] declared unto his servant the prophet.
[1:40:15] Revelation 10:7. Is that right? And I
[1:40:18] want to tell you Christ is the mystery
[1:40:21] of God revealed.
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; For God was in Christ
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; reconciling the world to himself. So God
[1:40:29] was revealed in Christ and the Christ is
[1:40:31] revealed in you and I.
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; We are the embodiment of deity.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ
[1:40:42] is our gospel.

[1:40:47] defininity.
[1:40:49] Amen. With all he is, that is our
[1:40:52] gospel.
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; How many of you believe with me?
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; Is our gospel this morning?
[1:40:58] &gt;&gt; And church of God.
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; Praise God.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; You believe the report?
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:06] &gt;&gt; You believe the report?
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; If you believe the report,
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then you preach the report
[1:41:15] &gt;&gt; and you cannot preach it this gospel
[1:41:19] without Joshua in you.
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me? You have to get
[1:41:25] Joshua in you.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; In order to preach it,
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me?
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; That's why you know 10 spies. But
[1:41:37] Abraham said 10 was a bad number.
[1:41:40] Those 10 spies, they went there, they
[1:41:43] saw it, they came back
[1:41:47] and they said, "The land is real, but we
[1:41:49] cannot take it."
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Right?
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; Because we were like grasshopper. They
[1:41:53] were gi
[1:41:57] those 10 spies, they weakened the people
[1:42:00] for the promise.
[1:42:04] But Abraham said they are 10 theologians
[1:42:08] and we have a lot of them on the pit
[1:42:10] today that are preaching nothing but
[1:42:11] theology
[1:42:13] and not that gospel. Remember that's
[1:42:15] what they were preaching. They are
[1:42:17] scientist
[1:42:20] preaching
[1:42:21] another gospel preaching wisdom.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; against faith
[1:42:27] &gt;&gt; and multitude of people fell for it.
[1:42:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But there were only two
[1:42:33] that still the people and said, "Be
[1:42:36] still. We are more than able to take the
[1:42:40] land. Let's go in all at once and
[1:42:43] possess the land.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; For the inhabitant of the land, they
[1:42:47] were afraid of us."
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; And I tell you this morning, church, the
[1:42:52] land of promise is ours.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; Every promise in the book belongs to us.
[1:42:57] Amen.
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; And all the demons, they occupants, they
[1:43:01] are scared, they afraid of us because
[1:43:05] God has promised that I will send my
[1:43:07] fear before you.
[1:43:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:10] &gt;&gt; I will send my fear before you. The fear
[1:43:13] of God is going before us. The hornets
[1:43:16] are going before us. Hallelujah. God is
[1:43:20] our battle.
[1:43:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Jeremiah said, "The Lord
[1:43:25] thou art at my battle axe." Amen. Is
[1:43:28] going before us.
[1:43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; We have the power. We have the victory.
[1:43:35] &gt;&gt; We are more than able.
[1:43:40] That was the report
[1:43:42] of the two great men. And the who are
[1:43:47] those two? Caleb and Joshua. Amen.
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Now, Mother Abram said, "The Holy Ghost
[1:43:53] put upon my pen to write and to tell you
[1:43:57] that Caleb is the bride, the believers,
[1:44:02] and Joshua is the type of the Holy
[1:44:04] Ghost."
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And I tell you this morning,
[1:44:08] church, it is only the believer and the
[1:44:11] Holy Ghost that will be able to preach
[1:44:14] the gospel of the bride.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. that will be able to believe the
[1:44:18] report of the bride
[1:44:20] &gt;&gt; that will be able to say this gospel,
[1:44:23] &gt;&gt; preach this gospel, live this gospel.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Nobody will be able to do
[1:44:28] that. But it will be you and the Holy
[1:44:31] Ghost and Joshua. And the when you have
[1:44:34] the Holy Ghost in you, that is the
[1:44:36] Joshua. And you can take the land. It
[1:44:39] belongs to you. There's nothing that the
[1:44:42] devil can do. You don't need to sign any
[1:44:45] memorandum of understanding with the
[1:44:47] devil. Hallelujah. Because he's scared
[1:44:50] already.
[1:44:53] &gt;&gt; He's afraid
[1:44:56] when you know your position.
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; He's afraid of you.
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; It's scared of you.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; The fear of God is going before you,
[1:45:06] church.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Do you believe that?
[1:45:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. And brothers, when you are in that
[1:45:12] condition, amen, you are entering now
[1:45:16] into perfect faith, into a perfect
[1:45:18] rapture faith. You are getting into the
[1:45:20] bride material,
[1:45:21] &gt;&gt; into the rapturing condition. And the
[1:45:24] brother, you are already in an
[1:45:26] atmosphere
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; for supernatural.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; And then in the atmosphere of
[1:45:32] supernatural, all things are possible in
[1:45:34] there. And your testimony will always be
[1:45:37] ringing and it will always be true.
[1:45:39] Hallelujah. Because that is the gospel.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:45:44] &gt;&gt; That you carry. Not just pastor John,
[1:45:47] not just, you know, Reverend uh Bruce,
[1:45:49] not just Reverend Heron Gary, not just,
[1:45:52] you know, Pastor Gideon, not just any
[1:45:54] other ministers of God.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; But we all carry that.
[1:46:02] &gt;&gt; Ye are my witnesses.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus said so every brothers,
[1:46:06] every sister,
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; the bride.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says you will
[1:46:12] prophesy again.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He's talking about the bride
[1:46:16] because the bride in the omega church or
[1:46:19] in the alpha church prophesy signs and
[1:46:23] wonder miracle. Hallelujah. Oh brother,
[1:46:26] the alpha church had it and the omega
[1:46:31] church will have it again.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. you will prophesy again.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; So you got to take that book and he that
[1:46:38] book and become that word so that you
[1:46:41] can prophesy again.
[1:46:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:45] &gt;&gt; Get that Joshua in you.
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; Get the Holy Ghost in you. And the Holy
[1:46:49] Ghost will feel upon every word that
[1:46:51] proceedth out of the mouth of God. For
[1:46:54] the word of God is the food of the Holy
[1:46:56] Ghost. And the one you give the Holy
[1:46:58] Ghost is food. Brother, you can whip the
[1:47:00] giant. You can bring the giant down.
[1:47:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:47:21] &gt;&gt; Atmosphere
[1:47:23] for supernatural.
[1:47:25] Brothers, I stop you this morning by
[1:47:28] telling you this. In 2 Kings chapter 5,
[1:47:34] 2 Kings chapter 5, we saw that uh the
[1:47:39] Syrians
[1:47:41] went down, you know, to Israel and took
[1:47:45] them away captive.
[1:47:47] And brothers, we are here in the land of
[1:47:50] our captivity.
[1:47:52] is the land of our captivity.
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Thank God, you know, for America. Thank
[1:47:59] God for every other country. Thank God
[1:48:01] for the liberty that you have to serve
[1:48:03] God. But brothers and sister, don't you
[1:48:04] never forget is a land of our captivity.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:08] &gt;&gt; It's not our homeland.
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; Heaven is our homeland.
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; We were under captivity.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; And then you know it took them away into
[1:48:16] Syria. And they when they got to Syria,
[1:48:20] no more life, no more hope, no more
[1:48:23] expectations. Only God knows when the
[1:48:26] time to go back. But this lady,
[1:48:30] this lady, this bride, Hallelujah. Oh,
[1:48:34] praise the Lord. All is well. All is
[1:48:38] well. For we have had a message. Shalom.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; All is well. Amen. There is
[1:48:48] a place
[1:48:49] behind the veil, that Raven veil. Amen.
[1:48:55] A hiding place.
[1:48:58] Little bride. Rest. Live under that
[1:49:02] atmosphere. That lady was living under
[1:49:04] an atmosphere of supernatural.
[1:49:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; She was not scared. She was not afraid.
[1:49:13] And then you know when she was living,
[1:49:15] look at it.
[1:49:17] She was living
[1:49:20] with a leper.
[1:49:23] In Israel, you don't live with leper.
[1:49:28] A leper
[1:49:30] must be excommunicated.
[1:49:34] &gt;&gt; A leper must be carried out of the town,
[1:49:37] out of the city
[1:49:39] and go and live
[1:49:42] in
[1:49:44] a secluded place,
[1:49:49] confined
[1:49:51] place.
[1:49:53] That's a leper,
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:49:58] &gt;&gt; Take them to leprosy
[1:50:01] and let them live in there. But she was
[1:50:04] living
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; right there
[1:50:08] &gt;&gt; with a leper.
[1:50:11] Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. And let me
[1:50:14] tell you this. The Bible says Mayan
[1:50:20] was the captain of Syrian. He was a
[1:50:23] great man of valor, but he was a leper.
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; An honorable man, but he was a leper.
[1:50:31] And we have a lot of them on here today.
[1:50:33] Leper.
[1:50:36] Lepers on the pulpit.
[1:50:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[1:50:40] Lepers they don't know what to do. They
[1:50:43] can they can't do nothing.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; They are dummies.
[1:50:48] They don't believe in Jesus Christ the
[1:50:50] same yesterday, today. Leopard
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; great men, pastors, preachers, leper
[1:50:59] that with that supernatural and yet they
[1:51:02] are preaching the gospel.
[1:51:05] Oh no, another gospel.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:09] great men, lepers
[1:51:12] and brothers.
[1:51:14] But this lady
[1:51:16] was living under the atmosphere, under
[1:51:19] the supernatural atmosphere. And she
[1:51:21] said,
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; "Oh, oh, I wish my Lord Nean was with a
[1:51:27] prophet in Israel. He would just recover
[1:51:31] of his leprosy."
[1:51:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:33] The prophet of the Almighty God said
[1:51:36] that lady
[1:51:38] probably, you know, she hasn't seen
[1:51:42] Elijah
[1:51:43] heal a leper, but because she was
[1:51:46] brought up under the atmosphere
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; of a home
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; that believe in supernatural
[1:51:53] &gt;&gt; and I want to challenge you, you young
[1:51:54] boys and girls, our youth this morning,
[1:51:59] &gt;&gt; only believe all things are possible.
[1:52:02] Those who never doubt, supernatural God
[1:52:06] is still living and is alive and well.
[1:52:11] &gt;&gt; And he's here this morning.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:14] &gt;&gt; He can do all things. Is in our home, is
[1:52:17] in our school, is in our working places.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; And we have a lot of people that are
[1:52:24] challenged and we should tell them the
[1:52:26] truth.
[1:52:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; Tell them about our God. Tell them about
[1:52:31] is omin. Tell them about how is the same
[1:52:36] yesterday, today and forever.
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Let's tell them this lady was speaking
[1:52:43] about the true God and the prophet
[1:52:46] messenger of the hour.
[1:52:50] &gt;&gt; And then when Mrs. Neman heard it,
[1:52:54] Mrs. Neman told the husband, the husband
[1:52:57] went to the king of Syria. The king of
[1:52:59] Syria gathered the gift together and
[1:53:02] wrote a letter to the king of Israel and
[1:53:05] sent Captain Nean, you know, to the
[1:53:09] king. You can just see how it's going.
[1:53:12] Ups ups ups ups. But brothers, the ups
[1:53:16] ups know nothing.
[1:53:18] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:53:19] &gt;&gt; They knew nothing
[1:53:21] &gt;&gt; about the supernatural.
[1:53:24] &gt;&gt; They knew nothing about his omnipotent.
[1:53:28] That lady did not talk about ups. He
[1:53:31] wasn't talking about the politicians,
[1:53:33] about president, about governors, about
[1:53:35] senators, about house of rap member. He
[1:53:37] was not talking about that. He was
[1:53:39] talking about the omnipotent God. He was
[1:53:42] talking about Jesus Christ. He was
[1:53:45] talking about the prophet messenger that
[1:53:47] God has sent to that age. And I'm here
[1:53:50] this morning, brother. I am not talking
[1:53:52] about politics. I am not here talking
[1:53:54] about governor or president. I'm here
[1:53:56] brothers and sister talking
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; Amen
[1:54:00] &gt;&gt; about the promises of God
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; for this age
[1:54:05] &gt;&gt; God sent us a prophet
[1:54:08] &gt;&gt; Malachi for promised day
[1:54:10] &gt;&gt; and God brought it to pass in our day
[1:54:13] Luke 17:30 the day when the son of man
[1:54:17] is revealed we are living such a day we
[1:54:20] have seen supernatural in our day
[1:54:24] &gt;&gt; we have seen cancer being healed, TB
[1:54:27] being taken off.
[1:54:30] &gt;&gt; And if he did it one time, he can do it
[1:54:32] again.
[1:54:33] &gt;&gt; He will do it again.
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; He will do it again.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; I believe this morning, brothers, and
[1:54:39] that's what we are talking about. And
[1:54:42] brother, that is what we should talk.
[1:54:45] Amen. That is my gospel. That is the
[1:54:49] gospel of that little lady. That's the
[1:54:51] gospel of the little bride. Amen. Yes.
[1:54:54] &gt;&gt; Are you hearing me church?
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; Our gospel is
[1:55:00] Jesus Christ.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; Hebrews 13:8, the prophet said that is
[1:55:05] the theme of our campaign.
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:55:12] Brothers,
[1:55:14] when Neon got to Israel
[1:55:18] and the king got all the gift
[1:55:21] and he got the letter.
[1:55:25] &gt;&gt; He read the letter.
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[1:55:30] &gt;&gt; See how this guy is seeking quarry.
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. To kill and to make live. And
[1:55:39] he took his garment.
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; And he tore his garment.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; And the prophet had it. Elisha.
[1:55:55] And Elisha the prophet said, "What?
[1:55:59] Send him here."
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; And we know that there is a God in
[1:56:06] Israel. Amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:56:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Brothers, don't be scared of
[1:56:14] nothing. Only believe.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; All things are possible. We are built to
[1:56:20] believe.
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:22] &gt;&gt; Not to disbelieve. To believe.
[1:56:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; That's why so many times, you know, we
[1:56:28] are faced with a lot of challenges.
[1:56:29] Those things are meant to build us.
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:56:34] to build us, to grant us.
[1:56:39] The prophet of the Almighty God made us
[1:56:41] to understand that these are the process
[1:56:43] of character development,
[1:56:47] &gt;&gt; trials,
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; difficult times,
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; mountain things are meant to be stepping
[1:56:52] stone onto victory,
[1:56:55] &gt;&gt; we should not be deterred.
[1:56:58] We should not be confused. Right. Right.
[1:57:01] &gt;&gt; We should hold to God.
[1:57:05] And Neon got to the prophet's house.
[1:57:08] And then when he got in there, the
[1:57:11] prophet was told that Captain Nean, such
[1:57:14] a great man,
[1:57:16] is here looking for you, sir.
[1:57:21] Praise the Lord.
[1:57:24] Praise the Lord. And neon said what?
[1:57:30] Huh?
[1:57:32] I mean the the prophet said what? Okay.
[1:57:36] Uh one of you five-fold ministers.
[1:57:41] You have the gift
[1:57:45] also to pray for the sick.
[1:57:48] You can preach like the way I do.
[1:57:52] That is why you are ordained.
[1:57:57] Somebody are you here?
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; The prophet of the Almighty God said
[1:58:03] that God raised up
[1:58:08] wonderful helpers
[1:58:10] for the messengers of the age.
[1:58:14] It's not just only the messenger alone
[1:58:16] but brother said God rest up what
[1:58:19] wonderful helpers
[1:58:23] &gt;&gt; wonderful helpers
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; to carry the message to preach that
[1:58:27] message.
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; They may not just only play tape. They
[1:58:32] can read the Bible and preach church.
[1:58:34] And that is why I am here this morning
[1:58:36] brothers because I am ordained to pray
[1:58:39] church. I am called to pray church like
[1:58:41] any other fivefold. Amen. They are
[1:58:44] wonderful helpers.
[1:58:50] &gt;&gt; To preach
[1:58:52] the same message
[1:58:56] that Elisha was preaching.
[1:58:59] And the spirit of Elijah was upon
[1:59:02] Elisha. And God said, "I will use that
[1:59:04] spirit five times." And then we are
[1:59:06] right here at the fourth time when God
[1:59:09] is using the same spirit. And then you
[1:59:12] know God raised up men you know to carry
[1:59:14] that message.
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the same way but Abraham said
[1:59:19] God will raise up young men that will
[1:59:22] preach this message in a more powerful
[1:59:26] way
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; than it is.
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. And I believe we are still doing
[1:59:34] poor job about it. But I believe you
[1:59:35] know that God can never fail.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. So therefore, our brothers and
[1:59:39] sisters, don't you never stop me from
[1:59:42] preaching it because the prophet said,
[1:59:44] "I shall preach it."
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; And I'm here preaching. I'm here
[1:59:48] preaching. Hebrews 13:8 is my gospel.
[1:59:54] &gt;&gt; Is the gospel of the bride?
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; Somebody you believe this morning?
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; And the when that man came out, one of
[2:00:03] the preachers,
[2:00:05] do you know what he said? He said the
[2:00:08] prophecy

[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It
[2:00:17] praise the Lord. Oh my. And Nema was
[2:00:20] kind of looking. He said what? He said
[2:00:22] the prophecy. The prophet said, "Amen."
[2:00:26] And I'm here to tell you this morning
[2:00:27] the prophet said,
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[2:00:30] But Abraham said, "You are either a
[2:00:35] messenger
[2:00:36] of good news
[2:00:39] or bad news."
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. Is that a messenger?
[2:00:48] You are a messenger this morning. You
[2:00:50] are a messenger of good news or a
[2:00:55] messenger of bad news. Oh, isn't it
[2:00:59] beautiful to know that we are
[2:01:01] ambassadors, that we are angels, the
[2:01:04] messenger of the resurrection.
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:07] &gt;&gt; And we are God's messenger to the sinful
[2:01:09] world. That Christ lives in our heart.

[2:01:15] brings us from the low debtured life of
[2:01:18] sin and exalt us and give us a
[2:01:21] hallelujah in our soul
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; and makes us new creature.
[2:01:27] We are messengers, angels of the

[2:01:38] of the covenant. Amen, brother. You are

[2:02:04] believe in supernatural.

[2:02:11] prophet was here.
[2:02:13] Neymar never saw the prophet.
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; Neymar did not see the prophet.
[2:02:21] He saw one of the ministers.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; And the minister told nan what the

[2:02:39] through the minister the neman turn
[2:02:42] around and he said oh I wish he will
[2:02:44] come out and cause that sickness and
[2:02:47] call upon his god over me.

[2:02:55] damascus better water than that of
[2:02:58] Israel?
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; Right.
[2:03:01] and he went back to his own country and
[2:03:04] then when he was on his way he was rot

[2:03:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; And the one of the boys saying, "Sir, if
[2:03:48] that prophet told you something harder
[2:03:50] than that, wouldn't you do it?"
[2:03:54] He said,
[2:03:57] "How much less?"
[2:03:59] He told you to go and wash in Jordan's
[2:04:01] river.
[2:04:03] But Abraham said he can go away if he
[2:04:05] want to keep his leprosy.
[2:04:08] And brother, I don't want to keep my

[2:04:14] to obey
