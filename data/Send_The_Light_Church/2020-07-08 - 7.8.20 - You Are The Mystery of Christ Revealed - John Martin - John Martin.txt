privilege to be in the house of the Lord I was looking forward to being here today and I don't know of any other place I'd rather be especially in this late hour there's a dark holler that's confusing now or this hour when it just seems like fear is gripping and then the the news can't stop the unveiling of all the other stuff that's going on trying to figure things out I just I don't know any other place I'd rather be than in the house of the Lord I know you feel the same way amen how many got a chance to listen to the the key to the door Sunday keep your hands up let me just see one well praise the Lord Amen my brother this should be easy because I'm just asking you now because you're the only one listen what is the what is the key to the door that brother Branham said was what was the key to the door okay and that key was the key is the key to every promise is Amen that's what he said the key of faith it unlocks and locks it does both so as we're listening to the word it can unlock and if we question it can lock so we want to believe the Word of God today hey Ben well god bless you brother Martin may the Lord give you a double portion for listening to that message amen turn with me if you would to the book of Colossians chapter 1 verse 24 all right let me see us show of hands how many either listen to a tape live streamed or went to a service let me see your hands one one-and-a-half praise the Lord well you know sometimes we have two services and you took a break you took a break and I think that's just that's just good we'll see we still have a chance to listen to that message the key to the door it was a very good message I recommend take some time to listen to that message I believe the Lord the Lord definitely spoke to me in that message I believe he'll speak to you to each one of us I believe there's something good there for us in this hour amen before we begin reading here let's just look to the Lord in prayer and you that are in your homes pray pray with us at this time Heavenly Father we thank you for this privilege that you've given us to be in your house today to be gathered together with those of those saints of like precious faith that love you believe in you that are holding to your unchanging hand and all the more as we see the Day approaching father I pray that you would not only be with us here in this little building but be with each family that's watching in that's listening in this that's praying right now Lord may you be in their homes right now me you unveil yourself to each one of them and may you bless them and meet every need that they would bring before you Lord today as we stand here we're in needy people god I ask that the blood of Jesus Christ would cover us and cleanse us and washed us of our sins today Lord may you dress us in your righteousness and may you prepare us for your word today God we know not all that you would have force us that you'd take these lips of clay and that you would speak to them to your people Lord that you would bring them the word that would lift up their faith that they could take that that that key of faith and unlock any any promise Lord that they're desiring in their lives their families and lore that you just meet the needs father Lord we need you in this late hour pray that you would fortify us with your word Lord Lord reveal every word to us tonight help us to be a attentive and Lord open our hearts to all that you'd have for us that we may leave here stronger strengthen two shadowed more prepare to meet the enemy tomorrow father Lord we commit ourselves into your hands I'll pray that you'd bless the ears Lord that would here give each one of us ears to hear what your Spirit is saying to us today we Lord will give you the praise and honor for this as we wait further on thee for we ask these things now in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen praise the Lord Colossians chapter 1 we're gonna be step begin reading here at verse number 24 now who who now rejoice in my sufferings for you and fill up that which is behind of the afflictions of Christ in my flesh for his body sake notice which is the church wherever I am made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God even the mystery which had been hid from the ages and from generations but now has made manifest to a Saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach and warning every man teaching every man in a wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus we're into I also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily amen god bless you me you may be seated brother Branham preached a sermon Christ is the mystery of God revealed that's quite a lengthy sermon and today we wanted Minister on the bride as the mystery of Christ revealed and title this you are the mystery of Christ revealed and for a subject I want you to think on as we Minister today what about Christ in you because we want to take our our text from this set of scriptures here Paul was rejoicing in his sufferings but it wasn't just oh I'm suffering I'm getting nothing out of it he was getting something out of it and what it was getting out of it was the church the body other people seeing other people come to the light and the glorious salvation of Jesus Christ he says where have I made a minister according to the dispensation of God which is given to me for you to fulfill the Word of God you have been saved for a purpose that's beyond you take a look at everything that God created it's always benefiting something people don't even know God can look at the Grand Canyon and look at the the oceans and the mountains and the snow and the birds and and and and glorify the how this came about so these things even to the person that doesn't believe in God can behold the beauty of it and when God saved us he didn't just have you in mind because he would have stopped with Jesus Christ but God so loved the world that he gave there was others that he loved and and Paul had the Spirit of God in him to where he could see that his calling was for others amen even the mystery which had been hid from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of this glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory now he says whom we preach Christ in you the hope of glory we preach in this way warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that to the end we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus now that kind of sounds like the army to me you don't just enlist and that's it okay I'm in the army you keep growing and learning and they you've served 20 years they don't say okay we're going to start all over no they want to make you a higher rank they want to put you further they want they want you to help other men in the army and and and teach others to do what you've done in this it's a continual grooming process and and Paul's desire was not just that people would get saved but that they would become perfect in Christ Jesus he wasn't just interested in some baptism he said he warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom in God's wisdom that he may present them perfect to God it's a chaste virgin he said I labor striving according to his work which worketh in me mightily so this man strived and is working it wasn't just about barely making it to church barely making it through the week no he had a purpose his relationship with God didn't fall by the wayside in between services he had a job to do in between the services amen think about how amazing God is and everything that he does is amazing when I sit back and I I began to think about God and I spent a lot of time sitting at the edge water the the edge of the water this week and just looking at the the birds in the mainly the birds but the water and the rocks and the trees and the water rushing and every time I think deeply about the things that God has created I really do stand in all how could this be created God is he's the God that created the heavens and the earth he created everything he said when he said let there be light and there was light he made thousands of galaxies with millions of custom stars they're not all cookie cutters right they're customs he made all the atoms and the molecules in the the elements think about the the bitty insects that fly and call to the giant elephants and rhinos and dinosaurs from the nature of a lamb to that of a lion or grizzly look at all the beautiful and colorful birds that God created not just to enjoy not just so we could enjoy them but that we could be it can be a witness from God to us that he's amazing to get us to look at God and say God you're great look at that bird look at that mountain look at that out that that animal even the bugs that crawl around all the creatures that live in the water zooplankton is the smallest of animals which the smallest of zooplankton you can't even see with the naked eye it's called an animal he made that but when you consider from the smallest microscopic marine virus to the huge whales weighing up to 200 tons that's four hundred and forty thousand pounds the blue whale right that's nearly twenty times heavier than a t-rex or forty African elephants or 3333 humans and their tongue weighs the same as three average cars that way the tongue of a blue whale can you imagine just coming down like three cars slamming you 9,000 nearly 9,000 pounds their heart is the biggest weighing in about the weight of a Volkswagen Beetle their heart God is amazing we were the only creature he created in His image he created us with the soul look at all the intelligence that man has he can create an atmosphere he can create things he he he can make things he can figure out things he can overcome problems God is absolutely amazingly awesome you talk about the triple-a that's Jesus Christ first Corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 and all this amazingness man has a hard time figuring out who God is but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for they are foolishness unto Him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so there's like a disconnect between God and man even though man is made in His image and we know that because man fell and he was born with the wrong nature 1st Corinthians chapter 2 verse 11 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of a man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us see we cannot know God without the Spirit of God so if you want it you want to know God seek His Spirit I don't mean to to say you know set down the Bible but get serious about the Spirit of the Bible because youyou could just stay in this world net this word naturally the rest of your life brother bands that you'd be further away from God than when you started but just get down on your knees and just 5 minutes in his presence you will know more than the theologians Romans chapter 1 verse 19 because they which may be known of God is manifest in them for God have showed it unto them this is a very powerful scripture because that which that which may be known of God is manifest in them so if you want to know God it when it is known it's manifest in you so when you're asking God God would you just show me this what you're really asking for has got to manifest it in you and your your your your whole desire is it to be here not here for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and Godhead so that they are without excuse so we don't we don't know God we don't see God but God makes all these things and then we see how great God is I mean just think about this little Bertha flapping his ring so fast you can't even see it and God created him like that how could we not think that God isn't awesome that there that how could the Big Bang do that the Big Bang must've did a lot of things because I could show a lot of things are awesome and yes so vastly different because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were thankful what a terrible spirit but became vain in their imaginations from the foolish heart was darkened professing themselves to be wise they became fools and changed the glory of the incorruptible God into an image that has made like to corruptible man and to birds and four-footed beasts and creeping things see what the devil wants to do in the mind of people belittle God instead of looking at him from who he is God has always hid himself in simplicity from the wise and the prudent his birth was hid in a manger and revealed to some humble shepherds they were just think here of the Sheep they were just doing their job and God it is his majesty he hid it from the wise and prudent that day by just placing it in a manger where nobody knew about it for God so loved the world that He gave he wanted he would that no one would be lost yadi hides himself from those who think they have salvation all figured out without reverence without fear without humility anytime we're beginning to feel those things God hides himself from you we serve an awesome amazing God who's able to hide himself to someone in church because there's three types of believers not going to change this message for us not going to start a new message and say you know what we're all believers here whoa brother John well we're all believers there's three types of believers but you wouldn't want me to tell you that no matter what we're all going in the rapture and be like someone at a funeral saying this person's going to heaven no matter what it's up to you to decide what you want to believe now I want to believe with you on a trust but God is has the ability in a church where there's three types of believers let's just say we're not one of those churches don't let anybody be offended but in a church where there's three types of ly God has the ability to hide himself from the unbeliever the make believer and unveil himself to the real believer because it has to do with love relationship with Jesus Christ as that that's simple not how smart we are how long we've been going but how much do we love God today brother Branham speaking of God he says if you want to know God look at Jesus Christ and you'll know exactly who God is the truth of Jesus Christ had been a mystery to the world but in this age we are that mystery revealed to the world we are the manifestation of the gospel unveiled to the world there's only one group of people that are going to unveil who Christ is the denominations can't do it they're man-made the independent churches they can't do it some of those churches yeah they can show they can show the the moving of the Spirit they can speak with tongues no doubt there's miracles that take place but I'm not talking about that do they really know Christ the bride of Jesus Christ is the only group of people who will be just like Jesus Christ and she unveiled that to a group of people the world is blinded deceived lost second Corinthians chapter four verse three says but if our gospel be hid is hid to them that are lost in whom Satan the god of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the glorious gospel of Christ who is in the image of God should shine unto them the gospel of Christ that is the light of God in this age we're all have that light now it's hid to them that are lost that's why you could talk to some people and they're just not interested but that doesn't mean we should stop we should never wait for somebody to come up to us and say okay I want to know about Jesus he would have never said go ye out you never went looking for God God came looking for you and God wants to go looking for someone else that belongs to him and he needs a vessel that's willing to go out Jesus testified that the church in this age was wretched he's his own testimony was miserable poor blind and naked and wasn't even aware of their spiritual condition so instead of going to the church with the right attitude I could be wrong I need to work out my salvation with fear and trouble I need to find out where I'm at with God today they came to church wanting to be pleased wanting to be entertained wanted to feel good wanted to be reassured of something that took place years ago that God still loved them that they're saved in other words they're they're taking their time through the course of the week and instead of building the relationship with God they want the preacher to do it all for him it's not what the ministry is for now we all we all go through times that we need reassurance and help from one another from the ministry no doubt about it but we should never live under those conditions that's just a lazy believer why is the church in this condition because they simply lack the Holy Ghost the very nature of Jesus they're having church without the Holy Ghost they're singing the songs they read in the Bible reading things that appeal and the peace the people make him feel good but they're not growing Peter said he that lacketh faith virtue temperance patience godliness brotherly kindness and charity is blind and cannot see afar off so Peter suggests that we should give all diligence to get get it back give give all diligence Jesus suggested getting some counseling from him he said I counsel thee to buy of me gold but the band said whatever you do lay aside everything else although the things you got going in your life lay it aside until you get perfect love now these are some some good advice here from men from the Holy Ghost it is our responsibility to take the things that God has shown to us Jesus's ministry of reconciliation he gave it to us but it's his he just using us truth that God has given us the light of our the manifested word for our day and unveil the mystery of Christ to others it isn't just telling people about God sent a prophet and it's not just about God sent a message what is the message brother Brennan repeatedly said it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever what our goal should be here is Christ the same in me as he was in that first wave sheaf that went in this age and not being content just to sit under the umbrella saying it's the message you don't make people sit in a message church they don't care what Word is as long as it says Presbyterian Lutheran Catholic Pentecostal doesn't matter as long as it has that name there are people sitting in the message as long as it says mrs. Church they're not even interested in in manifesting Christ as long as they say they belong to it lord help us we need to unveil Christ to the people that's our responsibility unveil more of him to the people that we live with the people that we work with the neighbors that we live by to the people we don't know to the people we meet it's our responsibility second Corinthians chapter three verse one do we begin again to commend ourselves or introduce ourselves that's what that means or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of combination from you I don't think we need to proclaim ourselves when we're trying to bring Christ to somebody our life and we don't need to introduce ourselves my name is John Martin and I really I am a believer of this endtime message and start with some sort of introductory no just let Christ be on display in your life let people see things that only Christ would be able to do it's your reaction and your love unconditional to them by this show men know you're my disciples when you have love one for another if the only way that people are going to see that is when you get hurt turn down stabbed in the back said something negative people just ah I ain't got time for you and when you can love them like your best friend now you've manifest is something that nobody else can do except Christ if people only see you love your friends then where is the reward but if you can love your enemies then you will have the reward of Christ being manifested in what honestly what greater reward is there it isn't about a show-off contest it's about being free from your flesh from your nature that just wants to stick your nose up at him and say I'll show you but to be free from that the better I love them unconditionally you can't even control it because it's Christ in you oh boy second Corinthians chapter 3 verse 3 for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistles of Christ ministered by us ilove that you have a big part to play in somebody there their character and their their coming to Christ and and and manifesting Christ you have a part to play and that's what what what Paul say in here the Epistle of Christ ministered by US written not with ink but the Spirit of the Living God not in tables of small stone but in fleshy tables of the heart now I can't put the Spirit of Christ in you but I can live such a life in front of you I could display Christ in such a way that you would hunger and desire to have that and say God fill me with that I want what he has you play a part and such trust have we through Christ to God word not that we are sufficient of herself to think of ourselves to think as ourselves but our sufficiency is of God who also have made us can you say made us amen made us able ministers capable ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the Spirit for when you preach it it can kill people but when you live it it can give life to somebody I'm not saying we don't share the word with our lips I'm not saying that but I tell you what catch catches my eyes when somebody's doing something that I know that they got to deny their flesh they got to lay down their reputation they got to lay down their time they got to lay down their pride hallelujah and they that's Jesus Christ now that's all I see left Jesus whining trying to help me praise the Lord brother Ben speaking of the bride in this hour and the choosing of a variety says she must have his character she must have his character in her the real true born-again crit Church must have the character that was in Christ because the husband the wife are one and if Jesus did only that which pleased God kept his word and manifested his word his bride will have to be the same kind of character now that character that the bride has not only keeps the word but she manifests it now I'll tell you that that that last word manifest that puts pressure on me because it's no longer what I know it's what I'm living the bride is the manifestation word for the hour she is the mystery of Christ revealed to people who don't even know Christ so my question to you is what about Christ in you where do you stand with this the hope of glory it's not just about you making it to glory it's about the others that you're on display with because God will not take you until it's time for you to go we have a work to do second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 5 for we preach not ourselves that's a good one right there amen but Christ Jesus the Lord and ourselves your servants for Jesus sake oftentimes when missionaries are communicating with us through emails in different ways they refer often to themselves as servants and I believe when it comes to helping others to other people we need to be their servant we're a servant for Jesus Christ you know you the only way you're gonna really serve God is by serving his people brother BAM said if you wanted to do something nice good for God do it for his people he says if you want to do something nice for me do it for my my children my family right didn't he say that we serve for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness now do you remember last Wednesday service Ephesians 5:8 for ye were sometimes darkness but now are ye light in the Lord walk as children of light and hear Paul speaking to the Corinthians for God who commanded the light to shine out of darkness have shined in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ when Christ came into us it was darkness and that light came in and it just shined out of our life a life begin to change we begin to do things different act different seat different things that light is not just for you we are the mystery of Jesus Christ revealed in this age shining out our lives are giving light to those who are in darkness you're no longer in darkness you were sometimes in darkness but now ye are light washes childrenht you are in the light you walk in the light you're bringing light to those around you why try brother John I just I told them over and I just tell them and and they don't listen well maybe ask God for it to let them see Christ in you well you know what that's gonna mean the bride is the only group of people that's going to manifest everything that Christ did Christ in us the hope that others may see glory the hope that others may see glory 2nd Corinthians 4 verse 7 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels we have a treasure in here because the light is shined on here and there's a treasure it's called a treasure chest that the excellency of the power may be of God and not of us there it is right there the power is of God we just need to use that key that key of faith we know it's the power of God and lies by how we react to problems because look at verse 8 because when we are troubled on every side we're not distressed one more perplexed we're not despair when we're persecuted we know we're not forsaken you'll never leave us nor forsake us when we're cast down that's ok we get back up we're not destroyed we're always varying about in our bodies the dying of the Lord Jesus that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our bodies Jesus can't be manifested in you without you being dead to yourself Jesus is not gonna die in there just wipe out what you got going so he can shine his light he's looking for vessels that are willing to surrender him so he can come into their hearts and live their life in front of somebody he's interested in other people for we which live are always delivered unto the death for Jesus sake always I thought it was just once so it's just at the beginning I thought I was I to do is get baptized you know a nervous you were when you got baptized I don't want to do this I'm gonna do this in front of people it's scary feel uneasy why can't they just bypass this part I promise to believe and boy we get that done it was like God all over with it was great we felt free but we stuff to continue to die because Satan gets in our minds and gets us to think certain things and we then we do certain things we say certain things and before you know it we're being used by him instead of God the way we want to be and I'll tell you we need to die out to that how are other people going to see Jesus Christ when told you got to tell them is what you think is right hey just turn on the news you don't like CNN watch NBC you don't like NBC watch a fo X F and I say that Fox you can hear what you want to hear but when you see a life demonstrated you can't deny Jesus Christ for we are always delivered unto the death delivered for Jesus's sake that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh so then death worketh in US but life in you so who is God interested in your life others amen how many love the word Amen just say Amen to the word your flesh don't like this I'm not asking for your flesh to say Amen I'm asking for the Spirit of God that soul that belongs to God to say amen to that word amen first John chapter 3 verse 16 howbeit perceive we the love of God because he laid down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brother yes Amen isn't that good brothers you would not believe how many things that were said today in those men's meetings just same thing happened as last Wednesday now some some believers don't like to think about laying down their lives for others as if the treasure that's inside of them is only for them no Christ wants us manifested to the world to those that we live with in this world those that we rub shoulders with he is so desperately thinking I need brother John to lay down his life just a little bit so that person there that he's talking to you will see me but if my mind is so interested in something else do what I got to do to get to it but got on the back burner come on I really appreciated something but other sudden in our men's meeting today we get so caught up thinking that Christ is only interested in the things that we want God has his own desires too you know and his thoughts are much higher than her thoughts his ways are much higher than our ways and we need to think about those things eternal things so much more a soul is eternal thing second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 15 and if Christ died for all then they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto which died for them and rose again so Christ wants us manifested to those and around us he wants us to unveil Christ to them the bride is the mystery of Christ revealed brother Branham said all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in Christ he poured into the church the bride and I believe all that's in the bride he is manifesting to the world today she is the mystery of Christ revealed to the world I'll think about it what about Christ in you the hope of them making it to glory she is not announcing herself for an adducing herself as Miss Jesus nope she's announcing Christ with her life she's manifesting the Living Word she's unveiling the mystery of Christ to others she's on display for the world to see see brother band said I'd much rather have someone live me a sermon than preached me one you know we all have that great opportunity but what it takes is just getting a little bit more serious about our ministry about our sermons don't wait to the next church service to live out your sermon the church world is so confused in this hour they don't know what's right they don't know what's wrong it's like listening to the news the more you listen to the news the more confused you yet I thought I was confused in January February March it's getting worse and worse Satan's the author confusion just like the church world they're further away today than they were ten years ago twenty years ago the church has gotten so cold cooled off they really don't know what it means to be born again they're perfectly content with just a form of godliness their attitude shows that the power of the Holy Ghost in their everyday lives isn't that necessary they can still be a believer without it in the message the key to the door brother Bannon said that's the reason the great miracles and signs are not done amongst the people today that there used to be they've lost the key to the door and Jesus said I believe it's in Luke chapter 18 when he returned shall he find faith on the earth we need faith in this hour there's such a confusion that the devil has created in the church and people need to see Christ in you the hope of glory it's the only hope that people have they your words may be absolutely 100 percent correct when you speak to them but that's not enough to catch their attention why did brother remember when God sent Moses to the children of Israel first and gave them signs they don't believe the first time they lead the second what did brother Branham say that this healing and this discernment was their bait to get the attention of the people well you know we're in our if we don't got the gift that brother Brandon had we still got the life that should get their attention always be ready to give a hope for what lies within you to somebody who's got an ear to listen the hope of others seen glory is when they see the mystery of Christ unveiled through you when they see you loving without respect to persons when they see you living humbly reacting humbly and meek walking in the spirit not fulfilling the lust of the flesh not all puffed up or boasting about yourself not seeking your own things and talking about your own things rather seeking the things of others caring about others not so easily provoked you know some people get so easily provoked to think evil to react negatively it's not about the letter it's about the spirit of the word living through you to others it's our responsibility Saints to unveil Christ to others it isn't God's what I mean you don't just go live off to yourself anymore but we're in debt in debt to what in debt to let Christ live through you that they may come to know him because somebody gave up their life for you somebody gave up their time for you think about the people in your life the people that were in your life that are in your life that gave their time for you now you're in debt to God I'll just say it like this pass it forward pass it forward you ever go over the the Mackinac Bridge and somebody paid for you oh yeah I think so I'll just keep buying money then or you can give it and say hey pay for the guy behind me pay forward let God use you to help somebody it isn't what you know it's who you know it ain't the knowledge of the word if the love of the word it's the spirit of that word living in you manifested to others where the RAM said in the message running from the presence of Lord I've read this a number of times but he says we must accept our responsibility we have a responsibility to unveil Christ before people and the responsibility that God has given us in this day is to bring this message and as I get older I know my days are shortening up I feel the responsibility greater than I've ever felt press on we must do it we must get down to it in every where we go and telling the message and telling the people that Jesus Christ is coming that he's God and he's coming soon and there's not a hope left for the world but the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ in you the hope of glory he says there's not a hope in the world and it's our responsibility to give them that hope and we do that by manifesting Christ we do that by receiving more of the Holy Ghost in our lives by loving him and obeying him more so that others can see Jesus in us turn with me if you would to John chapter 14 verse 8 Philip saith unto Jesus Lord show us the father and it suffice us us so here Peter was saying I I want to see the father and we know brother Branham says if you want to know God just look at Jesus Christ this is kind of the message that Jesus is now his tone-tone feeder Philip I mean jesus saith unto Philip have I been so long time with you and yet that was not know me Philip he that have seen me have seen the father and how they'll say is now then show us the father believe us though not that I am in the father and the father and me the words that I speak are not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works now believe me that I am in the father and the father and me or else believe me for the very works sake now he's getting Philip to take his eyes off of the flesh off of his words even though his words were of the father and he says just look at my works who else does this as I'm saying if you really really want to give hope to somebody let them see Jesus in you let them see the works of Christ in you verily verily I say to you he that believeth on me the works I do shall he do also and greater a men and greater praise the Lord John 14 verse 19 yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye shall see me because I live you shall live also and at that day you shall know that I'm in the father and ye and me and I in you I in the father all that was in God he poured all that was in the Father he poured it in Christ and Christ was in the father and you in me and I in you and he that that we are the mystery of Christ revealed to the world because we have Christ in us he's in us living in us he that had my Commandments and keepeth them he it is that loveth me and he that loveth me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him now remember when God unveiled something to you it now becomes manifested in your life that hasn't happened with the second it'll Shh it will soon happen Judas saith unto Him not Iscariot Lord how was it that that was manifest or show myself unto us and not unto the world and jesus answered now notice it's not an outward appearance remember that the kingdom of God doesn't come with observation it comes within so he's gonna answer this he says if a man love me he will keep my words so now we're talking about a love affair he's he's answering the question how he's going to manifest himself - to - to his disciples but not aunt I was up to why he's imprudent if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him isn't that beautiful the father is in you Jesus is in you the Holy Ghost is in you you know what's happening if you let him have his way he wants you to lay down your life for somebody else that's where he's at he's not about you doing something and then you've taken all the credit for or tootin your horn like you got something to do with it lay down your life for others John 17 look where we're going with this John 17 verse 20 neither pray I for these alone but for them also which shall believe on me through their word now it ain't just natural word spiritual word living word manifested word amen that and I'll show you where right here that they all may be one as thou father art me and I in thee never all that was in God he poured into Christ all that was in grace important to the church that they also may be one in us that the world may believe that thou hast sent me how else are they going to see how else are they going to believe and the glory which thou gave us me I've given them that they may be one even as we are one I in them and thou in me that they may be perfect and one that the world may know that thou has sent me and has loved them as thou has loved me by this shall all men know you're my disciples when you have a different type of love the type of love that only Christ could have for us because I didn't care about him I remember having such negative thoughts about God selfish thoughts how could you love me and make me have to do that then he loved oh yeah evil thoughts but you know he still loved me let God use your body like that let him use your mind like that god is awesome he is the creator of all things he created her Souls he's the author of our eternal life that he's given us God is awesome Christ is awesome look at neat Nicodemus his own testimony says we know that our a man come from God no man can do these things except God be with him the beautiful thing is you're awesome too because now Christ is in you and when people look at you they say you are a you are a human that's part of that bride of Jesus Christ because no wife can do the things that you're doing except God be with her Jesus Christ is still doing great things he's just doing him and his bride he is the same yesterday today and forever won't you consider Christ in you what about Christ in you Colossians chapter 1 verse 16 we're coming down to an to a close here but this I'm telling you this the service is way shorter than brother Adam sermon that he preached way shorter way sure plush ins chapter 1 verse 16 Jesus Christ is the image of the invisible God the firstborn among many creature for by him we're all things created that are in heaven and on earth visible and invisible whether they be Thrones or dominions principalities powers all things were created by him and for him for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist he is the common denominator everything that we see and he is the head of the body he is the head of this church amen who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence and that's why we're against any spirit that tries to take the preeminence away from God any spirit that tries to take the preeminence away from God we're against it it's not the right spirit because God wants the preeminence how many can say he meant to the word for it please the father that in him should all fullness dwell so whatever God was Jesus was whatever God is Jesus is whatever God will be Jesus will be for Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever God is a creator Jesus Christ is a creator we all things were created by him we just read it God is a redeemer Jesus is a redeemer God is our Savior Jesus is our Savior God is our healer Jesus is our healer the Bible says that he heal with our diseases but the Bible also says by His stripes that Jesus bore we are healed God is love Jesus is love the Bible says when he looked over the multitude he had compassion as he saw them a sheep scattered that didn't have a shepherd so how is Jesus looking at the people you look at every day does he is he have compassion on those people he does are you what about Christ in you is he having compassion now it's Jesus Christ in you the hope of glory people see you creating an atmosphere because you can do that your Creator that is pointing them higher closer to Christ provoking them to good works remember our opening scripture warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom that's Christ that's Christ in Paul what about Christ in you you got that same ministry they're seeing Christ the Redeemer inside of you that's right trying to get them closer to Christ trying to show them that there's hope for them that there's a redeemer for them as you're standing in the gap for them Christ in you they that win souls is wise you become part of the plan of salvation you play an important role someone that's praying the prayer of faith over them for their healing this is this gives them hope when they see Galatians 5:22 when they see the love of God Galatians 5:22 for the fruit of the Spirit is love when they see the spirit of love on you the spirit of love if it's a living thing when they see joy in you not that you won the lottery but that there's some soul getting help right now when they see you happy about that they see joy when they see you having peace when nothing's going your way you're becoming Christ you're giving somebody hope when they when you're getting provoked to all get-out and you're not bothered you're just long suffering you're givin somebody hope when when the lion nature comes out at you and just but you're nothing on display except gentleness that's Christ in you you're giving somebody hope I'm telling you goodness faith temperance maintenance against such there is no law the fruit of the Spirit remember it's not the fruit of John Martin if you want to see the fruit of John Martin come on over for dinner and round but the fruit of Jesus Christ the more we die the more the people are going to see the love of God amen like the clothes and saying this that today the bride is the mystery of Jesus Christ revealed and you you are the one that gives people hope it's Christ in you look for the opportunity to display Christ in a way that people would say that had to be Christ and not because somebody was thinking the same thing that you talked to them about but because you were in such a pickle and they saw Christ manifested in the flesh it'll give them hope this is the hour that our light should be shining the most now what about Christ in you is the world stopping to talk about what they'd seen happening in your life are they seeing Christ being revealed before them manifested before them loving them when everybody else gave up on them are they stopping to talk about it are they stopping to consider look at that Grand Canyon look at that mountain look at the ocean look at those birds look at that bride are they taking time to stand in awe that you lay down your life for them you're the only hope that this world has a willing vessel that will go out and share Christ with others yes it's all about our love affair let's stand together you are the mystery of Christ revealed Christ is in you not only the hope of you making it to glory but it is the hope of others making it to glory as you manifest Christ to them amen maybe we could just before we sing a song maybe we could just bow our hearts just thinking on these things people need the Lord but are they seeing the Lord in us I know we're giving them the words but are they seeing the manifestation of the words it's something that we have to be so conscious of and so thinking of all the time no matter what we're doing what's happening that all they must see Jesus in me this is the hour this is the time this is the situation that they need to see Jesus in me and maybe this evening you're considering what about Christ in you maybe you're here today and you really want people to see more of Christ in you you want to lay down your life that others may be able to find life maybe you're you're here today and you're more interested than just coming to church because it's church but today you're interested in your relationship with the Lord that you want it to blossom you want it to grow you want to put forth the sacrifice that this word tonight has spoken to your heart you know you're the bride God is calling you to reflect him to unveil who he is to others just hold that before the Lord as we go to him in prayer God sees your your your hands you've lifted your hands God sees your hearts I didn't ask you to lift your hands I did it didn't desire you to lift your heart before the Lord for sure those watching on the livestream you in your home's this is your earnest desire this is your prayer you want to reflect Jesus in a greater way in your life maybe there's things that have gotten our way it got our attention off him but tonight God's brought it right back to what's really important God sees your heart seizure desire wants you to take that key of a faith that brother Branham said unlocks every promise of God we must believe for this we must believe it's not by feelings that's not by scientists it's not by anything natural but is by that sixth sense that we can have what we're we're desiring tonight I want you just to believe it with all your heart Heavenly Father as we come before your awesome throne just thinking about how awesome it it is when Isaiah was there he was just in all felt so unworthy to be there but to see your glory your holiness righteousness and all the beings that you create to worship you to stand guard to be your servants God down here on the earth when we just look at the things that you created we stand in all know God we want to be one of those creatures that other humans look at and stand at all because they see not John Martin anymore but they they're seeing Jesus Christ the hope of glory Lord I asked today that you would take our lives Lord as we lay them on the altar right now in our heart we lay them on the altar god we give you our lives of fresh take our
