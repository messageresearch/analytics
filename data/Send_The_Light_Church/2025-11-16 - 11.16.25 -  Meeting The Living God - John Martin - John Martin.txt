No turning back. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, well, I just like to just do something a little bit different than I think we've ever done here before. And I just came across this as I was preparing songs uh during the week. Anyway, I want to tell you the story behind that song we just sang. I don't know anybody's heard it, but it's definitely a testimony. Well, I don't know how many there's a few older ones here, but there used to be this uh who how many has heard about the Welsh Revival, right? Well, it's a big revival that happened, right? And it was so big that when somebody came over to find out what was going on, everybody was gone and they were all just all worshiping God. There was no there wasn't anybody in the jails. I mean, everybody was just a revival can just bring forth God and somebody's life. Amen. To a fuller extent. Amen. Well, anyway, this song comes from somebody that went to that revival and they went to India after the Welsh revival and the person came to uh north uh East India which was a really violent kind of like uh you could just imagine the different religions and things like that that comes forth from there, right? And um so the man preached the gospel of Christ to the whole village that was there. And um this [clears throat] man his his wife and his two children accepted Christ, right? So the chief of the tribe back then got really mad. He says, you know, you you can't do this, right? And you can just put this in however in your own mind, but so he got mad and he says, "You got to renounce Christ." And he says, "No, I'm not going to do that." He says, "No." He said, "No, I won't do that." And uh so the um um let me just read this here. And um so the chief said, "Okay, well then bring your family up." So his his wife, his two kids and himself stood in front of the village and this told him again he says you have to renounce Christ. And and the father said no I'm not going to do that. He says I've decided to follow Jesus and there's no turning back. So the chief had some of the his followers, I guess, shot to his two kids. And so he he came to the father again and he says, you know, you got to denounce Christ. And he says he says he told him again, he says, no. So he he shot the he shot the two or he shot his wife and uh you know they just laid there lay there dying and uh he says no he says uh no there's no turning back you know none go with me still I'll follow. So the chief said well he says you know if you don't denounce Christ we're going to kill you. And he says, "Well, if that's what it takes, kill me." And so anyway, he uh the chief killed him, right? So we think of this as a sad story, right? And in some ways it probably is. But the testimony of the of the story is that because he he stood up for Christ, the whole village accepted Christ. &gt;&gt; So it's not what we can be a testimony. Amen. &gt;&gt; So anyway, let's just I pray that gives you more meaning to the song. &gt;&gt; So we know that following Jesus isn't what everybody thinks it is. It's deeper. So let's just sing that again. Amen. I have decided [music] to follow Jesus. I have decided [singing] to follow Jesus. [music] I have decided [singing] to follow Jesus. [music] No turning back. No turning [singing] back. The cross before me. The world behind me. The cross before [music and singing] me. The world behind me. The cross before [music and singing] me. The world behind me. [music] I won't turn back. I won't turn back. Take this whole [music and singing] world, but give me Jesus. Take this [singing] whole world, but give me Jesus. [music] Take this whole world, [singing] but [music] give me Jesus. I won't [singing] turn back. I won't turn back. No, none go with me. Though none go with me, still I will follow. [singing] [music] Though none go with me, still I will follow. Though [music] none go with me, still I will follow. No turning [music and singing] back. No turning back. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. I pray you have that revelation this morning. &gt;&gt; Because it's a personal walk with Christ. Amen. Fill my cup, Lord. Fill my No, I fill my fill my way with love. I'm sorry. Amen. Let me walk blessed Lord in the way [music and singing] thou has gone. Leading straight to the land above. [singing] Giving cheer everywhere to the sad and alone. Fill my way [singing] every day with love. Fill my way [singing] every day with love. As I walk with that heavenly dove, [singing and music] let me go all the while with a song [singing] and a smile. Fill my way every day [singing] with love. Keep [music] me close to the side of my savior and guide. Let me never [singing] in darkness ro. Keep my path free from wrath and my soul satisfied. [music] Fill my way every day [singing] with love. Fill my way [singing] every day with [music] love. As I [singing] walk with that heavenly [music] dog, let me go all the while with a song [music and singing] and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Soon the [music and singing] race will be over and I'll travel no more, but abide in my home above. [music and singing] Hallelujah. Oh, let me sing. Bless the King all the way to the shore. Fill my [music] way [singing] every day with love. Fill my [music] way every day with love. As I walk with that heavenly [music] dove. Let me go all the while with a song [music and singing] and a smile. Fill my way every day with [singing] love. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Grant it, Lord. You know, I don't think that man had very much time when he gave his heart to Christ. &gt;&gt; But I do believe God filled his heart with love. And you know sometimes we sing these songs but we don't really think of the meaning of the songs. &gt;&gt; And in each song I truly believe that there's a testimony. &gt;&gt; So let our life be a testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, there's some needs that we need to bring before the church. Amen. Let's uh our sister Cheryl has a a request. Um well, it's from Sister Anne, but I I sister Cheryl has it. It's for her dad. Please continue to pray for uh my grandpa healing as well as strength in his body. My sister Cheryl's family has uh is come to decision and I think he's accepted it from my understanding that he's going to come down tomorrow and they're going to try to find him a rehab place here and uh her mother's going to stay with Cheryl for a while through the course of that. So we pray that uh strength for her dad and uh for all wisdom for all the family. Amen. and uh also prayers for her brother uh Jeff that had uh has cancer. Amen. So let's just continue prayer for uh sister Cheryl and her family. Amen. Uh so uh let's just continue to pray for our sister Elizabeth Murphy. She's in a lot of pain. One of the her vertebraes in her back collapsed and they are trying to figure out what to do. Amen. All I can say is God's on time, God. &gt;&gt; So, we just pray that uh God would be your portion. Amen. Also, our sister Linda Beckman's got a request for eye surgery this week from tomorrow. I pray uh eye is very inflamed at times and appreciate all your prayers so much. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, let's just continue to lift that up. Our brother Bill, uh, he's doing better, but uh, you know, we want to just just because somebody's better, we shouldn't really stop praying for him, right? &gt;&gt; Because, you know, the devil might give you a good day here and there, but he he don't go away. So, let's just lift up everybody on on one accord this morning and just pray for everyone that's here that they would receive this morning from Christ, from the word of God, and uh may it just uh not go from the outside, but that we would open our hearts and it would just change our souls. Amen. Let's just stand this morning. Amen. There be anybody on your heart this morning, let's just lift it to the Lord. Amen. There, let's just go in one accord. Dear heavenly father, Lord, as we come before you this morning, Lord, you've heard these requests, Lord, for sister Cheryl's dad, Lord God, and for all the family, Lord God, associated with that, Lord, that you would give them wisdom, that you would give them strength, Lord God, that Lord, they might turn to you, Lord, for that strength, Lord, for we know you are the source of joy and the source of strength, Lord God.

But I know [music] my hand believeth and am persuaded [singing] [music] that he is able to keep [singing] that which I've committed unto him against that [singing] day. [music] I know now how the spirit moves, convincing men [singing] of sin, revealing [music] Jesus through the word, cateing [music] faith in him. But I know whom I have believeth [singing] and am persuaded that [music] he is able [singing] to keep that which I've committed unto [music and singing] him against that day. I know not [singing] what good good or ill [music] may be reserved for me of weery [singing] ways or golden days before [music] his face I see. But I know [singing] my belieth and am persuaded [music and singing] that he is able to keep that which I've committed unto him against [music] that [singing] day. I know not when my Lord [music and singing] may come at night or noonday fair, nor if I'll walk the veil with him [music and singing] or meet him in the air. But I know whom [singing] I have believeth and [music] am persuaded that he [singing] is able to [music] keep that which I've committed unto him against that [singing] day. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You know a lot of people out there trying to keep themselves. You can't do that. It's Christ in you that keeps you. Amen. Well, let's just stand. Amen. Brother Dennis, can you just lead us with some uh offerings and tithes? Thank you. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Stand up and say I love the Lord Jesus Christ.

[music] Amen. &gt;&gt; What a precious desire. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe that God is here. He promised to fill the hungry &gt;&gt; to to quench those that are thirsting after righteousness. And yet he's hid from those that don't trust him. &gt;&gt; And we serve a a a mighty God today. Well, God bless you. It's good to be in the house of the Lord and good to be with my family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh brother uh Gideon sends his greetings this morning. So we want to greet him back. Amen. It's good to see Sit Trina. &gt;&gt; It's been uh too long. And uh and the boys, it's been too long. It's good to see them front and center. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. How many love Jesus today? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Um let's look to the Lord in prayer and then we'll open the scriptures. Father, we thank you that we've had this this time to worship you, to praise you, to express our love to you in song and course. Lord, we thank you for these these men that have given their life to stand for you. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we don't know, but there are countless of those that have given their life standing for the truth. &gt;&gt; Yes. And Lord, what a privileged people we are today to be able to be in a a country in a in a church where there's freedom and liberty to believe your word. &gt;&gt; To stand for the truth, to to worship you in spirit and truth. Father, as we've gathered together this morning, Lord, we've there's a a yearning inside of us to to know you in a deeper way, to have communion with you. um so close that we would leave here changed, that it would be uh no longer us trying to live a better life, but it would be you inside of us living that life. &gt;&gt; That's how much we desire you this morning, Lord. Will you come in the realness of that in of that and uh unveil yourself to every one of us? May you get personal with every one of us. &gt;&gt; May we open our hearts to you and give you our will, give you our promise to keep your commandments, Lord. Lord, &gt;&gt; Father, we commit this service into your hands and ask you to bless the reading of your word to all of our hearts. May it be accompanied with revelation now as we wait further upon thee. We pray these things and give you the glory for them all in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to Psalms chapter 46. And after you turn there, then you can go to Isaiah 61. [snorts] Well, we may not all feel like praising the Lord. We may not all feel uh cozy and beautiful, but I'll say this. If we can just focus on what God has done for us. &gt;&gt; Uh because there's no one here that can testify that God has not been good to them. &gt;&gt; And he's he's worthy of our praise. &gt;&gt; So let's worship him as we receive the word now. Psalms 46:7, the Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Come, behold the works of the Lord. What desolations he have made in the earth. He maketh wars to cease unto the end of the earth. He breakth the bow and cutth the spear under. He burneth the chariots the in the fire. Be still and know that I am God. And I will be exalted among the heathen. I will be exalted in the earth. The Lord of hosts is with us. The God of Jacob is our refuge. Sheila. Amen. Turn with me now if you would to the book of Isaiah chapter 61. We want to entitle this message the living God. And for our subject, Stand still and know God. Isaiah chapter 61. We're just going to read one verse there and that's verse number three. God is here this morning to appoint unto us that mourn in Zion to give unto us the beauty of ashes, the oil of joy from mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness, that we might be called trees of righteousness, &gt;&gt; the planting of the Lord, that God might be glorified. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. When I think about God um and and how people view God because he's invisible, it makes it so easy for the enemy to to say there's no God. As we know, one of Jesus's disciples, God bless you, brother Marty. So good to see you. Amen. Um, Thomas, one of his own disciples, doubted the the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And he said, "I won't I won't believe until I see." And I more than see, I got to take my fingers and I got to stick it in in in his side where the spear went because I saw it happen. But if we could just ponder this thought, how many has the ability to do something to to to make an outfit to to make cookies? We got abilities to craft woodwork to do drywall to do all sorts of things to take the copper out of out of some uh mold or something like that. We but none of us has the ability to create life. &gt;&gt; So I just step back for a second. I think who created me? Who created human beings? Who created life? There are so many amazing facts about the human body. There are about 80 organs in our body. And these organs all have a different purpose. They function differently to accomplish something. You take a couple of those organs out and you're not alive anymore. &gt;&gt; It has to be replaced with another organ. And in that there's just a chance whether it's going to take or not. And each one of these organs have a particular purpose that they must fulfill in order for you to breathe today. &gt;&gt; And these organs are supplied by blood. And there's a vessel that goes to each one of these and through them and around your body. There are so many vessels in our body that literally if you put them all together, you could go around the earth four times in each human body. And inside those vessels are about 35 trillion cells with a purpose. And just from a scientific standpoint, there is like no doubt in my mind that there's a God &gt;&gt; because there ain't a human being that can create that &gt;&gt; and that just goes on and on with the animals. So, it's easy for me to believe that God is here this morning. And his word declares that if just two or three are gathered together in his name, I'll be there in the midst. &gt;&gt; He does not have to be seen for me to believe. &gt;&gt; So, we're going to talk about meeting the living God. What I find today is there's a lot of people who don't come to church to really meet God. &gt;&gt; They don't expect to have a oneon-one encounter with him. They may come to church because uh that's what church people do. They just go to church on Sunday. &gt;&gt; Some may come because there's nice programs, enjoyable music or a band or fine fellowship. Some because it's convenient for them, a better standing church. Uh some may come because a family attends or they may like the pastor, they may like the people. I mean, there's just different reasons that people come to church. There's all sorts of reasons. They all just don't seem to to come. They all seem to come short of the the right reason to come to church. &gt;&gt; It's hard to find people who are interested in wanting to build a character that's needed to make it into a rapture. &gt;&gt; Because that's the only thing that gets you in there. Not nice music, not a nice pastor, not a nice group of people, not because it's convenient, not because it's big, but because our lives become changed into his image. &gt;&gt; That is the purpose to come to church. Brother Brandham said in the message, the evening messenger, he said, "God has always counted character, not members. And today we do vice versa. We count members, good dress, well prayers instead of character, right? Eleaser sweed it out until he found character. That's right. Who would he get? And he trusted God uh character for Isaac, the bride, which the church is a type of. You know that that was the natural seed of Abraham. This is the royal seed of Abraham. Well, if Alzer the messenger hunting the bride was trying to find character, if that man comes a messenger of the last day trying to find the bride for Christ, he will not be looking for a denominational membership. He will look for a character that's willing. &gt;&gt; Remember, she was willing to work. Rebecca was willing to work. Hey, I'll not only give you some water, give, you know, water to all your camels. said, 'W watch good character first, then to get her ready to meet Isaac. After he found the character, then get her to stand still long enough to listen to the message of Isaac. &gt;&gt; Stand still long enough to listen to the message. That's the message of the last day, the evening light is first find the church. Where will they believe the message? Hunt it. Can you read what I'm talking about? Hunt where the church is that'll let even uh let you come in and won't just close the door on your face. And then when you do that, you'll find you find character. And now if she will stand still long enough to tell her how the bride's got to get dressed, she's got to be clothed. She's got to stand still. and if she's going to get it. So, Brother Brandham is saying here that the message has come, it's come with the gifts. It's attracted us. The discernment, the healing, the raising of the dead, all that in his ministry, it's attracted us. &gt;&gt; But now, what the prophet's saying is, I got to get her to stand still long enough to listen to the message because inside those tapes, it tells you what character you need to make it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at the little Rebecca listening to every word. Her little heart was beating. Now you sweat it out. Where will I go until I find character? That's when I find character. Then make her stand still long enough to get her ready to meet him. Oh my, what a striking thing. Wish we had a little bit more time on the clock. Get her ready. Stand still to listen to the message of him. Eleazar wasn't speaking of himself, but he was speaking of the one that sent him. And he had the gifts to prove that he was sent from him. Amen. And he wanted to clothe her with these things. You know how uh he fixed her up. If I could just get her to wash her face. Now he's speaking to brother speaking to the bride. Now he says, "If I could just get her to wash her face, now listen. Stand still." Notice the end time messenger, his job will be to get the saints ready. [clears throat] The bride's ready for the bridegroom. That will be his message. Now, you want to learn your ABCs so you can get so you can do algebra, he says &gt;&gt; later down the road. So, this message is really here to show us what's really needed. The all the denominations, they're probing. I hope we got it. They're assuming that what they believe is right. All the non-denominational churches, this message is the truth. &gt;&gt; It is what will judge the people of this last age. &gt;&gt; And we're so fortunate that it's been revealed to us &gt;&gt; that we don't have to go searching anymore. We found it. Now, all we got to do is stand still. Get serious with the word and and become what it says. &gt;&gt; If the word says this, just do it. &gt;&gt; Don't pick and choose. &gt;&gt; Because you pick and choose, you're not choosing Christ. &gt;&gt; We really need to get to know God more. Amen. &gt;&gt; We think we may we may know him because we have an idea or we know things or we have information, but do we really know God? &gt;&gt; Do we really have the character of Christ? Do we really have the gold that's been tried by fire as Jesus talked about because he invited us to buy gold tried to the fire that we might be clothed in his righteousness? Paul had to give up everything he thought he knew about God just to know God &gt;&gt; to give up his ideas even after 30 years &gt;&gt; of meeting God there was something in him that says I need to know him more &gt;&gt; and when you stay in contact with God you cannot get enough of God &gt;&gt; it's when you drift away from God that you don't think you need God anymore that you got enough Paul said, "I've suffered the loss of all things, and I do count them but dung that I might win Christ, that I might know him in the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death." God doesn't care how much we know, how smart we are, how religious we act. God revealed himself and gave the keys to the kingdom to someone who was ignorant and unlearned. &gt;&gt; Think about that. He he entrusted Peter with the keys of the kingdom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So it's not what we can attain to, it's how much we can love God. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Whatsoever you bind on earth, it'll be bound in heaven. Whatsoever thou loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. God had to kick Saul off his high horse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And get him to stand still long enough for God to speak to him. &gt;&gt; God appeared to Saul in a pillar of fire. The Bible says a light from heaven. But we're we know the prophet told us it was the same pillar of fire that led the children of Israel. And Hebrews 12 tells us that for our God is a consuming fire. Acts 9:4 Saul fell to the earth and he heard a voice saying to him, "Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?" &gt;&gt; Paul was hurting other people. And God says, "You're not hurting other people. You're hurting me." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Why is that? Because those people who you're hurting are standing for me. &gt;&gt; And when you start persecuting one of God's children, you're in trouble. Yeah, &gt;&gt; you got you got all heaven against you. &gt;&gt; All the angels of heaven against you. &gt;&gt; We need to learn to respect God's people. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Who art thou, Lord? I never met you." And the Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest. It's hard for thee to kick against the pricks." Amen. &gt;&gt; Saul, you're only causing yourself to suffer more when you fight against me because you're not going to win. &gt;&gt; Touch not my anointed, nor do my prophets any harm. You know, Jesus said, "What you've done unto the least of these little ones, you've done it unto me." &gt;&gt; We need to be careful of how we treat one another, how we talk to one another &gt;&gt; because we're speaking to God in the flesh with one another. God met Saul in the pillar of fire and he made him stand still so that God could reveal himself. Be still, Saul, and know that I am God. You're not God, Saul. I am. It's hard for you to fight against me. You're not going to get anywhere. &gt;&gt; And we know what happened. He went away for years and he got serious with God. One experience should all it take for us to get serious with God. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't need to be blessed and spoken to and all this. &gt;&gt; Look, God is only obligated to speak to us one time. &gt;&gt; That's it. After that, we need to decide what side we're on and that we're going to serve God because God can't come and baby us every day. &gt;&gt; When Paul met God, he had a choice. ignore the truth and fight against it or accept the truth and stand for it. And that's the choice that we have every time we come to church. And here we are. What are we doing? Sitting. Standing still and knowing God. But it's not just sitting still in a church. What we need to do is get our heart to stand still. &gt;&gt; Because God don't speak to our eyes. He's not speaking to our emotions. He's speaking to our heart. We have the same choice in church today that God is here speaking to us. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brandon says, "We will never leave church the same way we came in. &gt;&gt; Never. we will either be closer to him or be drawn away. Isn't it funny that it happens so slightly that you can't even hardly tell the difference? &gt;&gt; People can sit in church, come to church, come to church, and and yet we see their lives, their worse. So, it's very easy for us to conclude when we look back that when they came to church, they really didn't accept the word, they rejected it quietly &gt;&gt; and their life became worse. But then you see the genuine Christian who's becoming like Christ. &gt;&gt; Slowly but surely, they're becoming more faithful. &gt;&gt; They're becoming more like Jesus. They're getting a a sweeter spirit. They're able to to take the trials more. They're they're willing to stand the test more because when they come to church, they receive the word of God. Something happens in their life. &gt;&gt; So, we all need to stand still and know God more. Turn with me to Exodus chapter 3. Exodus chapter 3. Moses also met God with fire. The reason I mention this part about fire is because our God is a consuming fire. That fire is here today. &gt;&gt; That fire is in this building today. &gt;&gt; You may not see it, but it's here. &gt;&gt; Exodus 3:1. And Moses kept the flock of Jericho, his father-in-law, the priest of the Midionite. And he led the flock to the backside of the desert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. And the angel of the Lord appeared unto him in a pillar of fire out of the midst of a bush. And he looked, and behold, the bush burned with fire, and the bush was not consumed. And Moses said, I will turn aside and see this great sight. why the bush is not burnt. And when the Lord saw that he turned said see uh aside turned aside to see God called him out of the midst of the bush and said, "Moses, Moses." And he said, "Here am I." And God said, "Draw not nigh hither. Put off thy shoes from off thy feet, for the place where thou standest is holy ground." Now, think about that. The message that God is wanting to send right off the bat is you're unworthy of me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't think you can just keep, you know, just hop in here with any old attitude. &gt;&gt; You need to reverence me because I am a holy God. &gt;&gt; I'm a righteous God. I'm the one that created you. I am your creator. And he deserves reverence and respect. And this Lord said uh and moreover he said, "I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob." And Moses hid his face, for he was afraid to look upon. Now notice what happened. Moses listened to the word, and the word humbled him. What happens to people who come in the church and they don't care about their attitude? They don't reverence themselves. They don't reverence the presence of God. &gt;&gt; And how how is God going to help a person like that? &gt;&gt; And the Lord said, "I have surely seen the affliction of my people which are in Egypt and heard their cry by the reason of their tasmaxes. For I know their sorrows, and I am come down to deliver them out of the land of Egypt, and to bring them out of the out of that land, on to a good land, and a large onto a land flown with milk and honey, unto the place of the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Pasites, uh, Hivites, and the Jebusites. And now therefore, behold, the cry of the children of Israel, come unto me, and I have also seen the oppression wherein the Egyptians oppressed them. Come now, therefore, and I will send thee unto Pharaoh, that thou mayest bring forth my people, um, the children of Israel, out of Egypt. So, when you meet God and you leave God's presence, just like with Isaiah, God always wants to send you somewhere. &gt;&gt; He's got a job for you to do. God doesn't have a place where just Christians just do what they want to do when they leave church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our God is a consuming fire. And that fire is here today. That same pillar of fire that was there, he's here today. How do you know that, brother John? Because the Bible tells me Revelations 1:12. Revelations 1:12. And brother Brandon brings this out in the church ages. But just want to show you uh this here. Now we know that this is speaking of John in that day in the Lord's day. But he says, "And I turned to see in verse 12 the voice of him that spake unto me. And being turned, I saw seven golden candlesticks." So here, same thing, turning and beholding, same as Moses. And in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks, one like the son of man, clothed with the garment down to his foot. His girth was uh about the paps with a golden girdle. His head was hair uh his head and his hair was white as wool uh like wool, as white as snow. And his eyes, look at this, were as a flame of fire. Hm. And his feet were like unto fine brass. We know that's judgment. As if burned in a furnace, and his voice as the sound of many waters. And we understand that that is the ministers preaching this message. And he had in his right hand seven stars. There's the messengers. And out of his mouth went a two-edged sword, which is the word of God. and his countenance was as the son that shineth in his strength. So the the the ministry the the word being preached is the strength of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can find strength in the ministry of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when I saw him, I fell at his feet dead and he laid it in and he laid his right hand upon me saying unto me, "Fear not. I am the first and the last." Brother Brandham said this was not God standing as a priest as an intercessor that at this time this was God as a judge judging right and this is what's happening in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks but it's not as it were uh there's two let me let me just say this what What is God doing in the church today? Okay, it's quiet because we know that if we answer, we might be wrong. So, we're not going to say anything. &gt;&gt; What is God doing in the church today? Well, &gt;&gt; for the bride, he's bringing judgment. The bride is being judged now. The word when the word is spoken the bride for the bride it becomes her white throne judgment &gt;&gt; because remember the Bible says that all must appear before the white throne judgment &gt;&gt; all well the bride doesn't appear before it because she's sitting with Christ on it. So in order for that scripture to be fulfilled, this is her white throne judgment right here for the bride. She comes to church to be judged by the word. &gt;&gt; Now the thing is on this side of it, there's mercy accompanied. &gt;&gt; There's mercy accompanied with their white throne judgment. But now for those who are not bride, which I'll just say it's the normal church member, they don't come to be judged. They only come for the grace, right? Come boldly before the throne of grace that you may obtain mercy. They just come for the goodness, for the for the healings, for the mercy, for help me in my life, for these things. And they're not interested in a character change. &gt;&gt; But only the word is going to change the character. &gt;&gt; So the bride is here to be judged. And this is a mature thought. But Peter said in 1 Peter chapter 4:17 if you want to write it down. 1 Peter chapter 4 verse1 17. For the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God. And if it first began at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, &gt;&gt; where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? &gt;&gt; Now, here's some comforting words for us. Wherefore let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in welloing as unto a faithful creator. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "I have many things to say unto you, but you can't bear it now. But see, now that the Holy Ghost is here and now that we invite the Holy Ghost in our heart, we can take it. &gt;&gt; And and what what's what's the word say? Great peace have they that love my law, and nothing shall offend them &gt;&gt; because there's a there's a love for God. There's a love for his word. But the Holy Ghost is here. Jesus said, "When the Holy Ghost has come, I'll lead and guide you to all truth." But when he comes, what is he going to do? He's going to reprove, rebuke, convict. There's going to be conviction when the word comes. Because why? Not that God wants us to feel bad. Not that he wants to hammer us over the head. Not that we want to feel beaten. [clears throat] That's such a poor, negative, immature attitude. &gt;&gt; But what God is looking for, he's looking his BRIDE TO STAND STILL LONG ENOUGH THAT HE COULD GET THE WORD SO character can meet Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because God didn't Abraham didn't tell Eleaser just go get any old woman. &gt;&gt; It had to get BE A SPECIFIC ONE WITH CHARACTER. &gt;&gt; One that he would spend eternity with. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S OKAY IF GOD LOOKS AT MY LIFE AND SAYS, "JOHN MARTIN, YOU'RE NOT READY YET. YOU NEED TO take care of this." &gt;&gt; There's nothing wrong with that. Can two walk together unless they agree? Amos 3:3. Can two walk together except they be agreed? &gt;&gt; The answer is no. Two cannot walk together unless they agree. &gt;&gt; And we have to be the ones that agree with God's commandments &gt;&gt; or we're not walking with him. 2 Corinthians 6:14 the Bible says, "Be ye not unequally yolked together with unbelievers?" &gt;&gt; For what fellowship have righteousness with unrighteousness? And what communion have light with darkness? And what concord have Christ with bile? Or what part have he that believeth with somebody that doesn't even believe? Now, you know what I mean about somebody that's that doesn't believe? Somebody that doesn't believe, they actually say they believe. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? It's not the words they say, it's the life that they're living. &gt;&gt; And what agreement have the temple of God with idols? For you are the temple of the living God. Notice that we come to meet the living God. As God has said, I will dwell in them. I will dwell in them. Notice what happens to the believer. And I will walk in them and I will be their God, and they shall be my people. Now, that's the agreement that God has with his children that to live inside of them, to walk inside of them. Wherefore, come out from among them, meaning everybody that doesn't believe this gospel. &gt;&gt; Come on. Amen. &gt;&gt; And be ye separate, sayeth the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you. &gt;&gt; So, there's something we have to do for for Christ to receive us. &gt;&gt; We can't ditto dial in the world and expect to be saved. &gt;&gt; It just doesn't work like that. And he says, "And will be a father unto you, and ye shall be my sons and daughters, saith the Lord Almighty." Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; I love the word of God today. &gt;&gt; Exodus 25:8. Exodus chapter 25 verse 8. Now, [clears throat] here God is speaking to Moses about making a tabernacle in the wilderness in order for God to meet his people. And he says in verse number eight, "And let them make me a sanctuary that I may dwell among them." Now, God could simply just go and be with anybody anywhere, but he says, "I'm not doing that. Make me a sanctuary. It's going to be dedicated to me. It's going to be holy. Only certain things are going to happen in this church, and that's where I'm going to meet my people. &gt;&gt; According to all that I show thee, make this sanctuary. after the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of the instruments of even so shall you make it. So it had to be made according to way God wanted it to be made. Amen. This is important. You know, when I would say to brother Stan, a lot of times, uh, you know, brother Stan, he's done a lot of work for us. And sometimes we we toss ideas back and forth and but you know, I'll say to brother Stan, I'll say, "Brother Stan, just do it the way you want to. You're creative. You just give it your own signature, your own flare." And he would make it the way he wanted to. And that has become what is right now that we look at and uh we get to enjoy. But God never said to any human being, you just you just live any old life you want to and I'll accept it. Our life has to become according to the word of God &gt;&gt; after the pattern that was shown to us in this word. Drop down to verse 22. Now in this this place there's in the inside of the inside and there I will meet with thee and I will commune with thee from above the mercy seat from between the two cherubans which are upon the ark of the testimony. All the things I will give thee in commandment unto the children of Israel. God plans to meet man inside the church. Now the church in the wilderness consists of three areas. The outer circle, the outer court or what Hebrews 9:1 talks about the worldly sanctuary. Now inside that is the middle circle that we talked about and that's the inner court or what the scripture says the holy place and then inside of that is the innermost circle which is called the holiest of all. Now that is where God promised to meet man and commune with him of all his commandments. Notice why we're meeting God. &gt;&gt; We're meeting God so we can find out our instructions, what he wants us to do for our life. &gt;&gt; That's the purpose we meet with God. It's it's a different mindset why a lot of people come to church. And if we receive his word into our ark, because in the in the tabernacle in the wilderness, inside the holiest of holies was the ark of the covenant. What was inside the ark of the covenant? &gt;&gt; What was inside the ark of the covenant? &gt;&gt; Inside the ark of the covenant, well, we had Aaron's rod. Aaron's the bread that didn't get moldy. We had Aaron's rod that always budded. But there were the commandments of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The commandments of the Lord were inside. Well, you represent the ark, right? You are the church. &gt;&gt; But as we talked about last service, there's three parts of you. And the innermost part of you is the ark, the heart. &gt;&gt; And inside that ark, if you receive God's commandment inside, he will have mercy on you. Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you do not receive the word in your ark, &gt;&gt; then he'll have mercy on whom to have mercy and he'll have judgment on whom we have judgment on. &gt;&gt; So we come to church to receive the word. We should walk out with Lord, you asked me to do this and I'm going to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you can say amen, I'm going to do it. You're going to receive more word. You know, when you receive more word, you know, you're going to receive more mercy. &gt;&gt; You're going to receive more grace. You're going to receive more blessings. You cannot receive the word of God without receiving more grace and more blessings from God. &gt;&gt; See, we're the bride is different. &gt;&gt; She's not the regular churchgoer that just comes to see what they can get out of church and well, I go to this church because of that, and I go to that church because of that. It's like that they don't have a vision. and they don't want to stand still long enough to hear how to get dressed. &gt;&gt; Jesus stands at the door, not of our body, not of our spirit, but our heart. And he's knocking. He wants to come in, but he can't come in where he's not welcomed. And when you welcome his word into your heart, then there's that communion that takes place, that real sweet fellowship. And I'm telling you, you can't have You ever be with somebody and you feel their presence? You've been around somebody that you just get nervous around them. Come on. &gt;&gt; You've been around somebody that just, oh, they're just so peaceful. Well, you can't you can't have Jesus in your heart and not feel the peace of God. [laughter] &gt;&gt; You can't you can't have Jesus there and not feel the joy. &gt;&gt; So, you you get blessings when you invite him in. &gt;&gt; But here's the thing. You know, you're not going to have him come in if you're not willing to stop doing what you're doing. &gt;&gt; So, there's a trade-off. He stands at the door and knocks. If any man will hear my voice, what is the voice? It's not John Martin. It's not the word John Martin is speaking. The voice is the word of God. &gt;&gt; It's the word. &gt;&gt; It It's the word that's being preached over your ark, the ark of your heart, that it means something to you and you accept it. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. As many Jesus said, as many as I love, I rebuke and I chasen. That's a different definition of how a lot of people think that God loves them. For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that should be the end of it. No, God still loves me. you know, he's trading beauty for ashes. [laughter] It's to be expected to get rebuked, &gt;&gt; but it's not it's not like we would rebuke our kids. It's not like what we're used to in this world. God speaks to us because he longs for us to be in his image. So, it's a it's beautiful. And God says, "I I I love you. I want you to be with me." &gt;&gt; Not I just want you to have a happy life here, get everything you want, and then miss going into rapture. What kind of what kind of husband would I be if I didn't tell you the truth? &gt;&gt; Right? I mean, that work, you know, Rebecca, she was willing to work more than what was asked of her. &gt;&gt; Amen. Inside the bride, there is a willingness to work all the garbage out of their life to work on keeping the commandments because it takes work. The flesh don't want to do it. You got to die daily. &gt;&gt; You got to have a hunger when you come to church. You got to mean business. You want to meet a real God. You're not satisfied with just a denominational going to church. I I I I learned this when I went to church. No, you want to walk out with a substance. Amen. Faith in the word of God is a substance. We come to this tabernacle to learn where we're standing with God. What is he doing? He's knocking on our heart. says, "I will meet you there and I will commune with you there above the mercy seat between the two cherubans which are above the ark of the testimony all of all the things which I give you in commandment." Remember we need humility in order for God to come into our hearts. If there is no humility, God's not coming in. &gt;&gt; God knocks on the door. Pride does not open the door. &gt;&gt; Pride will not open the door. God resists the proud, but he gives grace to the humble. James 4:5 says, "Do you think that the scripture saith in vain, the spirit that dwells inside of us, it lustth to envy?" So, we are born with a spirit and it's kind of like a cocka nature. that it's always one in its own will. I want, I want, I want. This is what I want. This is what I want to do. This is what I want to see happen. This is I want, I want, I want. So, it's there. It's not the scripture is not in vain. We need that scripture to tell us that. But God gives more grace. Wherefore, he say God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble. In in other words, if you're just always going to want want your will, then you're not going to get the grace of God. &gt;&gt; But if you humble yourself to the word of God, then God can help you. &gt;&gt; So verse seven, submit yourselves therefore to God. Resist the devil who's trying to get you to want, want, want, want, and he will flee from you. This is how you meet God. Draw nigh to God and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, you sinners. Purify your hearts, you double-minded. In other words, there's some work that has to be done. You don't I mean, have you ever had dirty hands and you just walk up to the faucet, turn the water on, and you go like this, your hands don't get clean. And I know if Sister Kathleen was here, I'd say, "Sister Kathleen, how long are you supposed to work and putting your hands together and cleaning it off, scrubbing to get the germs off, you have to work at cleansing yourself, purifying your minds. Don't be double-minded. Make a decision. Stay with it." &gt;&gt; Don't be wishy-washy. The Bible says, "Don't let that man think that he'll receive anything of the Lord." You can't even be blessed in life when you're double-minded. &gt;&gt; It's not a sound mind. You're not going to get anywhere. Even if you found the right path, you just get off of it. Verse nine, be afflicted and mourn and weep. These are things that we labor to do. Let your laughter be turned to mourning. Let your joy into heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord that he may lift you and he shall lift you up. Notice he wants to give us the oil of joy. He wants to give us gladness for our mourning, for our sorrow. He wants to to take all the negative in our life and bless us. But we first must get to the place where we humble ourselves in the sight of God. And we let our laughter that things don't matter, let it be turned to mourning. Let our joy and our in our in our worldly joy, let it be turned to heaviness that we humble ourselves before God. Doesn't the Bible say, "If my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves, &gt;&gt; then I will hear from heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. There's a part we have to play when we meet with God. He's a living God. We don't serve a picture on the wall. &gt;&gt; We serve someone who wants to change our life. &gt;&gt; And he's the only one THAT CAN. WE CAN'T change our life. All you got to do is be honest with yourself. Look at what you accomplished in the last month by yourself and see how much you change for the good. We need God to change us. Brother Brandham said in the message the unveiling of God. He says, "But when Moses came on the scene, he had the revelation. He had met the pillar of fire in his meeting with God. It was real." So when you do meet God, it's real. And it was revealed to Moses ho how Genesis he wrote the first four books of the Bible. Moses did. Is that right? For he met God in the form of the pillar of fire veiled in the pillar of fire. I always wondered how in the world did Moses know what happened? But God met him and revealed it to him. When Paul met him on the road, the disciples just wrote that they seen him do. But Moses had the revelation, went down into Egypt for three years and studied and seen God of the Old Testament where Jesus of the New Testament, the revelation, and Paul said, "I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision." That's right. And think of it, that same pillar of fire that came upon those men who wrote the Bible is the same pillar of fire here today &gt;&gt; interpreting the Bible. Amen. How can we thank him for that? Same. How can we thank him for that? Same. What a comfort. What an identification. I'm so glad to be identified with that. I don't know what I would do. I'd rather be I I' I'd rather be identified with that meaning the pillar of fire than all the Baptist, Methodist, Presbyterian, Lutheran, and all the rest of them identified in that word where that shakana glory and the revelation lays the pillar of fire appearing visibly among us identifying that the message is right like he did at Mount Si. Remember before the true message come forth, Moses preached and he laid them led them out of Egypt. But there before the real commandment was laid, the seal was brought in. God come down before the people and prove that Moses was sent from him. Is that right? In a pillar of fire that Moses said he had seen a in a burning bush and talk to him. Oh, in the last days to see that same pillar of fire among us speaking the same word. Not only that, but interpreting it by making it manifest and proving that it is true. I would rather stand with the message of the hour than what any man could say. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'd rather stay with the man that God sent as a seventh age messenger to tell me how to make it &gt;&gt; than to lean to my own understanding and listen to 15 other people &gt;&gt; try to find out. So, brother Rand says, "So, the people has not one way to disbelieve unless they just willingly want to." That's scary. And then he quotes the scripture. If that sin, if they sin willfully after they've received the knowledge of truth, there remainth no more sacrifice for sin. Notice the same pillar of fire sent to Moses and to Paul that wrote the Bible now sent to reveal it. That's through the ministry of Malachi 4:5. The grace of God, the unchanging God, the fulfilling of the promises of Matthew 20, law, I'm with you always. Fulfilling St. John 14:12, the works I do, you shall do also. Fulfilling Luke 17:28:29, in the last days, the son of man will be revealed in Malachi 4. Behold, I send you Elijah the prophet be and he will restore the faith of the people back to the original word. Oh my. He died to reveal himself to us. Brother Bham says, "Now let us die to self to reveal him to others." &gt;&gt; Let us die to our traditions and things to reveal him to others. Die to denomination to reveal him to others. We've got to die to what we want to do with our own time &gt;&gt; and take our time and share this message with somebody. I'm just going to be perfectly honest with you. The most important thing that God wants us to do is to receive the message of the hour. Now, I don't mean as a as a some sticker you put on the wall that says, "Yes, I believe the message of the hour." But you receive it into your life. That's the first thing that God wants you to do. The second thing he wants you to do is go give this message to somebody. &gt;&gt; And number two doesn't stop. &gt;&gt; You go give it to somebody else. And this will make God happier than anything you could possibly do on the planet because this is the will of God. Exodus chapter 29. Now, we only got about 56 more minutes. I don't know how we can quite condense it. But I I want to meet God. &gt;&gt; I want to meet God. We won't be able to do everything, but we want to do just a few more things if we could. Exodus 29 starting with verse 42. This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generation at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord, where I will meet you to speak there unto thee, and there I will meet with the children of Israel, and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by my glory. And I will sanctify the tabernacle of the congregation and the altar. I will sanctify also both Aaron and his sons to minister to me in the priest's office. And I will dwell among the children of Israel, and I will be their God, and they shall know that I am the Lord their God that brought them forth out of the land of Egypt, that I may dwell among them, and I am the Lord their God. Be still and know that I am God. I will be exalted among you. God is wanting us to be still in our spirit. Be still in our heart. Really focus on the word that's being ministered because God is trying to get our attention. He's wanting to reveal his will for our life personally. I'm just being honest with you. What good would it do for brother Stan if ev if God spoke to everybody here and they all received the will of God for their life but brother Stan didn't receive it. What good would it do for brother Stan? All of us are in the same place where all of us are in the same place. We all must desperately hear from God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The the when I come to church, the message is not for somebody else. &gt;&gt; When I come to church, the message is for me. &gt;&gt; Because if I don't receive Christ, what he has for me, then my gathering is in vain. &gt;&gt; All right, we're coming down to it. John chapter 14. So that that is a that's speaking of of the the natural tabernacle now that we heard. But now we're going to come back down. Just kind of going back and forth, but the same thing typing back and forth with our tabernacle, our bodies, God coming in communion with us. John chapter 14 verse 15 says, "If you love me, keep his commandments." Now, this is his theme as we read the rest of the verses. If you love me, be interested in what I'm saying at church. And I will pray the father and he will give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever. And even the spirit of truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know him for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you. Now notice he's speaking of the spirit of truth. He's speaking of the comforter, but Jesus is talking to his disciples and he's speaking of himself. &gt;&gt; He said, "For he dwells with you. I've been with you." He told Peter, "Philip, have you seen Have you not seen I've been with you this this long and you haven't seen the father?" So he says, "No, the world don't see him." Of course, the world didn't see Jesus, right? &gt;&gt; I mean, they saw him with their natural eyes, but they didn't know he was the son of God. They just, you know, give us Barabbus. They just, he was just un not interesting to them because they didn't follow their traditions. But he says that the spirit of truth, he said he dwelleth with you and shall be further future tense shall be inside of you. &gt;&gt; This is now. This is right now today. And I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you. Yet a little while the world seeth me no more, but you shall see me because I live, you shall live also. At that day you shall know that I'm in the father and you in me and I in you. Now he goes back to this commandment. He that has my commandment and keeps them. Notice you've got to hear the word. You've got to say, Lord, I will do this word when I leave. He it is that loves me, and he that loves me shall be loved of my father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him. What a communion. What a communion. And Judas saith unto him, not as scary, Lord, how is it that you're going to manifest yourself to us, but not to anybody else in the world? And Jesus answered and said unto him, "If a man loves me, he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our abode with him." Meeting God. It all starts when we hear the word of God that we we don't just say amen because it's a natural thing to say, but we really we we mean what that word says, what it what it says, which means so be it. &gt;&gt; So be it in my life, Lord. I want to get dressed for the rapture. &gt;&gt; I want to have something more on today that I need to get ready. We only have so much time to get ready. We need to take advantage of the time. We need to better walk away from church and say, "God spoke to me this. God spoke to my heart." Because if we don't hear God speak to our heart, something personal, then it's just us building the church. And unless God builds the church, they that labor labor in vain. &gt;&gt; GOD, WE'VE got to hear God's voice. &gt;&gt; Obedience is better than sacrifice. &gt;&gt; We just got to get more serious with meeting God. coming to church to meet with him. Pages I just have to throw to the side because time is all is up. God wants to give us beauty for ashes. He wants to fulfill all of our needs. He wants to have a real But more than that, what does he want? Fellowship, &gt;&gt; communion. He wants us to be interested in what he's interested in. Did you ever ever have a relationship with somebody and it was always about them? You know, like you don't have hardly any. It's never 50-50 in the decisions. It's always what they want. And and Jesus said, "All that ever came before me are thieves, robbers. They just want what they want. They they want all these things from me, but they're not interested in my commandments." &gt;&gt; And God just wants, you know, he's not going to say anything against anybody who doesn't want to keep his commandments. You know, God is such a beautiful God. But understand, there's a bride that's coming out of this church. I I think we should just be shouting from glory with that statement. There is a bride coming out of this church. I believe it with all my heart. Now, the word that's preached for this pulpit isn't for everybody, but I do believe it's for the bride. Amen. [clears throat] &gt;&gt; And and they will they will be happy about it. They'll be glad about it because it's what is needed to make it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's stand together. God bless you. Meeting with the living God. Think about how privileged we are to know that God, he cares and loves his word so much and he's trying to get it to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that little chorus.
