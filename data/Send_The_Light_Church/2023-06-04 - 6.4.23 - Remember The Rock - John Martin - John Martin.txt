receive the word of God Amen well praise the Lord so good to see each and every one of you this morning in the house of the Lord we've been praying for each of you I trust you've been praying for one another amen and for this time to be gathered together if you'd like to turn with me to the book of Psalm 61 for opening scripture it's good to see brother and sister Johnson back amen amen this morning we want to talk about remembering we're entitled this message remembering the Rock and for a subject God has a word that will Deliver Us from being overwhelmed amen I think it's something we all could relate to if if if we're not feeling that way today you need this message because you will in some time soon feel this way and I believe the Lord has something special for us this morning amen let's just look to him in a word of prayer and then we'll read the first four verses our heavenly father Lord we just want to thank you that you have given us strength and health and so much a desire to be here in your house today and father because of this Lord this Grace Lord we're here now to receive from you the things that we have need of and father we pray that your presence would not be uh in inhibited uh in any way that that you would be able to move freely in our midst Lord that there be no no no doubts no fears no unbelief but that you would bind up every evil spirit and cast it forth out of this place Lord that your people may be able to receive the things that they desire that they they want to believe for Lord that you would heal the sick that you would fill those that are thirsty for the Holy Ghost and Lord that you would bless us showers with your blessings and may your word come forth with Revelation Lord recommit the furtherance of this service in your hands as we wait now upon thee in Jesus Christ's name we ask it all amen amen Psalm 61 verse number one here My Cry o God attend unto my prayer from the end of the Earth will I Cry unto thee and when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I for thou has been a shelter for me and a strong tower from the enemy I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever and I will trust in the covet of thy wings amen God bless you may be seated I will trust in the protection or the secret place of thy Wings there is a place that we can go amen well the book of Psalms expresses so many things that David went through in his life we've all been through it so many things so many songs of joy and delight and gladness hope confidence and peace we can find in here him expressing love and gratitude in his deep desire is for God and just a respect for God in the awesomeness of God and David is one that really expressed his heart but we also find out in the Book of Psalms that he expresses many hardships that he went through in his life and so we will see here he expresses con Contrition of broken Spirit sorrow pain Agony regret and even shame grief and broken heartedness discouragement and loneliness so we can find these things and more in the Book of Psalms but just like us David felt overwhelmed many times in his life and here he expresses his heart's crying his faith that that during these periods that God would just meet him he said from the ends of the Earth not just for one place but from the ends of the Earth why cry unto thee when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I so the answer to being overwhelmed was a rock that David did not possess David was here and The Rock was up here and if he knew he could just get to that rock he would be safe that he wouldn't be overwhelmed anymore and I do believe that there is a place for every single one of us to not be overwhelmed in our situations and I believe God wants to lead us there are certain animals that are known for their Iraqi climbing skills but one of them Reigns Supreme anybody know who that is or which one that is that's right the mountain goat he is the Undisputed master of terrifying Heights and seemingly impossible to scale Cliff faces mountain goats they have predators just like we do there's our Bears wolves and Wolverines and much of the mountain goats behavior is a strategy to avoid these animals they're always on the lookout so their defense is to climb higher on Steepy Rocky slopes at other animals can't navigate there's something that's inside that that leads them up higher and so their enemy doesn't necessarily vanish away from them but they're up so high that they can't be touched by their enemies Just Like an Eagle in this age flies above his all the problems that there are going on down here and I believe there's a place in Christ where our life is hid with Christ in God there's a secret place of the most high under the shadow of the almighty where the enemy cannot bother us as Psalms 23 says that he prepares a table before us right in the presence of our enemies God is not moved by Satan he is not moved by problem and and and we should never fear because God in us is greater than our problems amen now it didn't matter what location David found himself in he said from the end of the Earth will I cry unto thee David knew that there was always a rock that was higher than his situation than his present situation that he was in and he looked at that rock as a shelter and it's a strong tower from his enemy and so David's strategy now was to keep climbing higher than his enemy and he was asking God to lead him to that rock he was asking God to lead him to that place he said I will abide tonight to have an echo forever I will trust in the covet of thy wings believed we as people we as a church we as believers we're living in a day where there's more evil than ever before we're battling more Spirits than ever before and it's so easy to become overwhelmed with things nowadays there's all kinds of pressures that we're dealing with Financial pressures how are we going to keep up physical pressures how long can we cope with these physical ailments that we're having job pressures so many pressures on the job nowadays so many demands we've got marital pressures social pressures worried about our image or being accepted by others we take a look at our teens though they're such a spirit pressuring them to change their gender teens battling peer pressure having a desire to be to dress a certain way so they can be accepted I just read one in five youths meet the criteria for severe mental health disorders a fact well we ought to just thank God for sound Minds amen a pressure to succeed academically athletically scrambling for a sense of direction in their lives they got pressures with their parents just parental pressure everyone is facing stress fears anxieties isolation and depression digital distractions pressure to stay connected on social media confusion about what to do in your life no one's listening to you no one really cares sometimes we're left without a friend at times we're left alone feeling completely overwhelmed with no one to talk to no one understands can anybody relate to what I'm saying sometimes we're just buried under heavy burdens like a massive weight over ourselves or a Dan that's just ready to burst and sweep us away leaving us feeling abandoned have you ever felt overwhelmed in a situation the Bible says there's a rock that is higher than our current state amen I believe that there's a revelation for us that is higher than our circumstances a solid foundation that's higher than our our weariness or uh unstable situation that God has a faith that is higher than her fear a peace that is higher than our turmoil God has a rock for us we need to believe that to start with it's a rock where the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against mother Brown and Son the message believeth thou this he says the devil might have bit you but there's enough drawing power in the Rock of Ages cleft for me let me hide myself in the Hallelujah the devil can't get you when you're hid in there so when we're feeling all these pressures around us we we need to realize that there is a place where we don't feel them now I'm not saying that the devil still isn't there taunting he just can't get to you it'd be like going to a zoo and this most dangerous animal that's caged up is just ferociously you know rowing at you but he can't get to you because there is a defense there and I believe there is a place in Christ where we don't fear amen we don't fear because we're we're so close to God because his presence is just so much around us that we don't fear because God don't fear there's a cleft in the rock for us there still is a rock and a weary land there's something to hang on to there's a Shelter From The Storm there's a refuge from the enemy there's still a place that we can stand still and know that he is God he has everything under control but life throws us curveballs all the time we get put in difficult situations sometimes overwhelming situations that it's that's when we need to literally humble ourselves and cry out to God because if we don't do that part and we don't say God lead me to that that rock that is higher than my situation it's just not going to be done God don't owe us anything he allowed the overwhelming situation to come for a reason he wants to build character he wants to see us grow in a trust for him David said when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I in my office I have a little quote from Abraham Lincoln he says I have been driven many times upon my knees by the overwhelming conviction that I have nowhere else to go Peter said where else can we go thou alone has the words of eternal life when we when we have a revelation that God is the answer for our situation we won't spend so much time trying to work on it herself God loves us to loves to put us in situations that it forces us to turn to him did you ever want to get somebody's attention and they don't want to give you the time of day come on they don't want to answer the phone they they they they they you're trying to look them in the eye they will look at you you're just trying to get their attention because you want something but they're too busy for you sometimes we're just too busy for God and he has to throw things some curveballs in our life to get our attention he knows what he's doing if we get a little bit squeezed we'll just be more likely to cry out to him lead me to the rock that is higher than I David's cry wasn't for the enemy to be just uh gone so he didn't have to deal with things anymore but David's cry was for the Holy Ghost leadership to direct him to a rock that was above his situation and that leadership comes from the word of God that is the rock it is the word of God that's why it's so important when we come to church that we're really listening to God when he speaks to us personally because he has a word to help us with our situations he doesn't have to stand here and call out every single thing that's personally happening in your life to get you to believe you got to believe the word is it's coming forth over the pulpit there is a word for all of us to hold on to something that will help us not to feel overwhelmed about our situations something that gives us a word of peace or a word of direction for our lives that gives us comfort in our trials so when God speaks to us when you hear the voice of God you just feel like you're lifted up into Heavenly places and you're you're higher above your potential or your situation that you were in a lot of times when we're feeling overwhelmed we're always thinking about all the bad things that could happen right we're not thinking positively but you know when something just comes someone gives you a word of advice or that God's presence just comes or something happens to where it's the answer to the situation and all sudden that burden just kind of lifts off of you you're no more worried about it and God wants us to remember that there's a rock for us to go to he doesn't want us to be bothered down he wants us to know that even the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against That Rock Amen Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and they follow me we must we must listen to the voice of God inside this voice I don't care who's preaching I don't care what word you're reading what type you're listening to if you're not focused Zoom Focus I'm talking about laser focused on God and from your heart trying to hear from God you're going to probably miss it I'm sorry that that may have not made you happy but I'm trying to provoke you to God's voice amen personally you've got to hear from him because when you hear from God personally that is your answer to not being overwhelmed anymore men can't help you we're going to have some examples of this coming up here lead me to the rock that is higher than I think we need to remember that there's a rock Christ Jesus for us that's higher than our situation and he's leading us there let's take a look at Jonah he was completely overwhelmed don't you think when a great fish swallowed up Jonah and Jonah was in the belly of the fish three days and three nights the Bible says that the the waters come past me about even to my soul the depth closed me round about and the weeds were wrapped around my head In Jonah 2 6 says I went down to the bottoms of the mountains the Earth with their bars was about me forever yet thou has brought me up my life from corruption oh Lord my God and when my soul fainted Within Me I remembered the Lord now you don't nobody's been in a situation like Jonah has I mean I would be thinking if I got ate by a fish that would be it for me you know what I mean I just but Jonah said I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thy Holy Temple now how did he know how did he know his prayer went out into the Holy Temple how did he know because he believed he believed we've got to believe that's the only way it works because all this time Jonah was running because he didn't believe but God got him in a place put him in an overwhelming place to where he had to believe a lot of times God puts us in situations because he wants us up higher to believe the full word for us he says in verse 8 they that observe lying vanities they forsake their own mercies you know the devil lies to us don't you you just got to call it out a line vanity he says but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that which I have vowed salvation is of the Lord now you know Jonah made a vow like many of us have I'm going to serve the Lord all the days of my life but what happens to us I'm saved I'm just going to do what I want to do now that God remembers your vow and God will hold you to your vow aren't you thankful for that and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon the dry ground now I'll tell you that that was a great thing it all started with Jonah remembering the Lord God wants us to remember that there's a rock a rock no you may not be going through nothing now you may not be bothered now your mind may be on something else now I don't know but I'm telling you there'll come a time where you're going to feel so overwhelmed and I want you to know that there's a rock God wants you to remember that rock yeah look at job do you think he was overwhelmed by his situation many of his family members died separated from him without a notice couldn't make any closure his friends falsely accused him his wife said that you should just Curse God and die tell you there wasn't a whole lot of encouragement was there but you know what job did he remembered that there was a rock higher than him yes he said let come on me what will though he slay me yet will I trust him that's scripture that was his testimony he remembered that there was a rock higher than him look at those who went to the septica to see Jesus the Bible says that they were much perplexed and the angel said unto them why seek ye the living among the dead he is not here but risen remember how he spake unto you when he was yet in Galilee the Angels were actually leading these women to Remember The Rock to remember the word that was spoken at church you know a lot of times church is over we go on with our life and we kind of forget about it until we think about going to church or think about reading the Bible or think about listening to a taste but I'll tell you what we hear today God gives it to us for not just now not just what happened in the past but our future how else are we going to get perfected Luke 24 verse 8 says and they remembered his words in other words it was settled in their heart they remembered the rock the word of God and returned from the septica and told all these things unto the eleven and to all the rest now it was Mary and Jonah and Mary the mother of James and the other women that were with them which told these things unto the apostles now look at verse 11. and their words seemed as to them as Idol tales and they believed not now why is that because it was the truth we need to get desperate not to hear from John Martin not to hear from the preacher our favorite preacher stand behind the pulpit but we need to get desperate from hearing from God behind the pulpit because when God speaks to you there is no doubts but when you're hearing from a man you're going to question and doubt and place everything where you want to to kind of fit your understanding the Bible says in verse 12 then it Rose Peter ran to the septic Earth stooping down he beheld the linen clothes laid by himself and departed wondering in himself at that which has come to pass that's right and our personal lives we need to remember the Rock and we need to go get it we need to start climbing Mount Zion we need to start climbing higher towards Gods we need to literally set our affections on things above we need to draw nigh to God let them draw nigh to us we need to remember the Rock Psalms 104 Verse 18 says the hills are a refuge for the wild goats this is a good good scripture for sister Cheryl the high heels are a refuge for the wild goats and the rocks for the colonies those conies are rock rabbits the hills are a refuge for wild goals and the rocks for the colonies Psalms 1 21 says I will lift up my eyes unto the hills from Once cometh my help My Help Cometh From The Lord which made Heaven and Earth and he will not suffer thy foot to be moved and he that keepeth thee will not Slumber lift up your eyes for once cometh your help I believe that God has a rock right next to him remember that rock moved right when the children of Israel the Bible says that rock went with them I believe it was leading them it wasn't only following them but it was leading them do you believe that amen now we need to look to the hills where comes our strength the Bible says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength I believe that's what David was doing he was waiting on the Lord they shall Mount up with wings as egos they shall run and not be weary they shall walk and not faint we need to spend some time crying out to God you know we cry about a lot of situations we cry when we don't get what we want do you ever cry when you didn't get what you want do you ever get angry and upset and cry and because you didn't get what you want but sometimes we just don't when's the last time you cried for the Lord because you just love him because you want to express your your soul sorry for not being all that he's called you to be I believe that's that relationship that God has wanting us to work on and I believe I don't think God wanted David to just spend time crying and suffering for no reason because David was a man after God's Own Heart and no matter what he did was wrong he got back up and he started heading for that rock and I don't care how many times you fall well brother John I passed seven times I don't care if it's seven times seventy get up and start going towards that rock God is looking for Overcomers in this age God gives the reward of strength to the believer who spends time with God he gives the reward of peace to them who practice keeping their minds stayed on the Lord because he trusts in them God rewards the believer with great peace if he loves God's word great peace have he that love my law nothing shall offend them right right you know we're just looking for a reason why it's okay to be offended like I got a reason no you're lacking love is what the real truth is uh I feel like having church today you know I would have been happy sitting here and listening to somebody preaching today I really would David wasn't crying out for God to take his trial away he knew if God had allowed this trial it was for a reason it was for a purpose and he wanted that purpose to be fulfilled so he never said take the trial away he just said lead me to the rock that is higher than I am we need to remember so often when we're going through pressure we want the pressure off of us somebody's stepping on your foot you want to get that pressure off of you look if God orchestrates a trial we ought to be praying God whatever you're trying to do through this trial let me do my part but we can be lifted up to a place where that doesn't bother us right we can get get thrown in the fiery furnace and we're not going to get burnt we're going to get thrown in the Lion's Den and we're not going to get eat up we don't have to fear we can open those doors cry out to to the Lord in prayer tell you what David did though because he knew that God had to fulfill his purpose he got desperate in prayer and he cried out to not be overwhelmed because of the situation and we must understand the difference we feel we're overwhelmed because we have the situation and our first our first thought is well if I didn't have this situation I wouldn't be overwhelmed well he would just been crying Lord take this situation away from me there would be nothing there about leading to a rock that is higher than me it just be take this situation and I won't be overwhelmed but see he wasn't looking at the situation carnally he was looking at it spiritually he knew God was in control and he knew that a word just one word from God a revelation from God what put him above his situation and that's all we need is a word from God a word a revelation a rock that we can hold to and then it didn't matter what happens to us here the Bible says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light onto my path God gives us his word to overcome our overwhelmingness we sing that song by his word will prevail by the word of God we Prevail not by our word we're no match for the devil I want you to think about this the Bible says who can say I have made my heart clean nobody can clean their hearts it takes God we're not going to Prevail over the Devil by our own word we cannot defeat the devil on our own we cannot cast Devils out in our own name or by our own power Jesus told pilate he says you could have no power except it given to you of my father before Jesus left he said all power is given unto me and he promised that power to us if we receive him and we receive his word he'll give us power to overcome the devil I just want to spend a minute on overcoming this devil if I could Jesus is the only one that can overcome the devil and he paid that price at Calvary where he could come down now and live inside of you and take control of your life now when Jesus said to him that overcometh I will grant to sit with me on my Throne as I have overcome and sat down with my father in his throne we overcome through Christ that is the only way we can overcome the because Christ laid the example that he overcame through God when he surrendered his will not my will but thy will be done so we're not going to be able to overcome uh the enemy with our abilities and our achievement and the gifts that God had given us but it's through Christ Alone the Bible says I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me amen and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith our faith in Christ not our faith and our abilities but our faith in Christ now listen to these words that Jesus said he said be of good cheer for I have overcome the world now we look we look at that currently we say well of course your God In the Flesh of course you overcame but where does that put me well if he's living in you that puts you an overcomer well if you don't feel he's enough in you to overcome then maybe we need to start right there and start crying out to God and say God fill me with more of your spirit because he wants you to be of good cheer amen so when we allow the Overcomer to come into our life and have preeminence he will overcome through us not just be inside of us now this is a catchy one we don't want to look at that Jesus is just inside of us because we all believe that but here's the real question is he preeminent because he's not going to overcome through us if he's not preeminent in our life that's the reason he puts trials in our life is to turn us closer to God but when you give them preeminence then he overcomes the devil that's attacking us so if we're going to let Christ have be praying minced inside of us we need to be equally serious about loving not our own lives unto the death now I'll tell you when we're thinking about overcoming I want the situation in my life and I want I want Christ more in me we don't think much about dying out that's like two separate subjects and you know it's like this I believe it was John said that um I must decrease he must increase he must increase I must decrease for every one of our Lives if you want more of God you got to get less of yourself it you just can't maintain this the the the the the the I wants and my will and I'm gonna do do it my way and expect God to come and make you an overcomer in your life you can't have it both ways we need to give up deny our wants our will and ourselves if you want to overcome you're going to have to surrender all to Christ now this is a big thing but here we have learned to come to church hear the word of God and not change I'll say it like this and not change for the good because we do change brother random says you can't come to service and not be the same when you leave this word has come to strengthen us to build us up to put us more In His Image to get us ready for the rapture but when this word is being preached there needs to be such a hunger and such a faith inside of God's people to say Amen to every word of God and really mean it from the depths of your heart we need to let our testimony be the word the word the word this is what the word says you need to believe what the word says about you more than what you feel about yourself the Bible says we're going to be in His image be in his likeness and we need to remember the Rock this is what the word says it does not yet appear but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him that's the Rock the whole earth is groaning waiting for us to be manifested to manifest the word it's it's waiting are we waiting are we anticipating are we longing are we Desiring because we got to become one with the word the word says nothing can separate us from the love of Christ that's nothing now we need to remember that so whatever the devil taunts in front of you and says you don't got enough time to give Jesus more calm out if you don't call him out he'll stay there I have learned that if you don't call the devil out he stays there he's allowed to stay right where you let him and sometimes we're just too afraid to say it like it really is I got this problem I've got this need I've got this thing happening I got these thoughts I've got I'm spending too much time for myself I'm I'm spending time doing the wrong things and you need to call it out and say that's wrong and Satan I come against you in the name of Jesus you need to do that you need to call it Devils out of your own life before you're worried about calling Devils out of somebody else's life he is our Rock we need to remember we have a rock we can change situations in the message Divine love brother Brandon says why do we fear then as long as we know the love of Christ is resting divinely in our heart not our love now the love of Christ is resting divinely in our heart that we've passed from Death unto life all demons out of hell hasn't got a chance to get in even at death if you'll I love this because it doesn't No period is a comma if you'll continue in that love and faith now what that really means is you got to be on fire for God so much what we think is continuing in the that love and faith is well I haven't made a decision I'm still I I'm still gonna love God that is not continuing to love God so this is a very powerful quote you've got to be honest with yourself because God is honest with you right and and you know you're no match for the devil you're not going to be able to take care of the devil you really need God and you need to submit to God you need to get serious you know I love the antidote that Jesus gave he said be zealous therefore and repent amen get excited about making things better in your life amen don't just allow that all everything that God is okay that's the laodicean spirit and they overcame the devil not by their own spiritual ability not by what they knew but by the blood of the Lamb or the word of their testimony they loved not their lives unto death you need we need to keep the token to fight her life that's what the prophet said we need to keep the token applied in our home applied to our family apply to our church body we need to keep the light applied the life of life not some picture of the blood but the life I understand that our desire is that God would take our trials away but God's desire is that we would overcome the trial we do that by knowing that there's a rock that is higher than our situation you know when we become overwhelmed become frustrated upset we try to do things and manipulate things and say things and and try to take a control and it usually ends up turning into a disaster it really does because when we do that we're literally showing that we don't believe there's a rock higher than us we're still in control we need to show God that we we trust you're in control that God is going to work it out when Jesus told his disciples that he was leaving them he said in Saint John Chapter 14 verse 1 he says let not your heart be amen what not your heart be troubled the real answer right here you believe in God believe also in me I am not going to leave you in this situation I'm not going to leave you in this situation of being overwhelmed of being troubled of being separated from me in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and where I am there ye may be also now I want you to remember this because when you're going through a trial God wants you next to him that's why he's leading you to a rock that's higher that's where he's at now I know he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you but God is not in a spot of turmoil God is not in a spot of confusion God is not in a place of being full of fear wondering what's going to happen he's not there he's with you but he's not there he's in a a place of of security a place of knowing he's I'm he's a I'm a president he's uh he knows everything he's God and when we forget that he's in control we become overwhelmed so God wants us by that where he's at and I'll have a scripture just shortly for us on that so we have a choice notice we have a choice every one of us has a choice when we become overwhelmed in our situations if Jesus said let not your heart be troubled he's presenting a choice is that some magic wand let not your heart be troubled no you still are a Freemore agency and you gotta you gotta make a decision where you're gonna stand the Bible says God is faithful who will not suffer us to be tempted above that which we are able but will with the Temptation also make a way of Escape that we may be able to what bear it parrot does it he doesn't take it away he gives you what you need to Bear it so you're not bothered you're not overwhelmed he lifts you above your situation your egos you're not chickens remember we have a choice be bothered or be led to the rock that is higher than us at that moment be bothered or let your heart be troubled so by remembering the Rock by believing the word that he is going to speak now here's the key we we believe that God oh when God spoke to Moses who he was and Moses just one is a legitimate question what do I tell pharaoh who you are because you're not the normal Nation King who do I tell that you are how do you want to be identified and he wanted to be identified as the I am that I had that I am so is the I am presently in your situation or the I was or that I hope will be God wants us to recognize him now right now speaking to my heart right now dealing with my situation right now that if I can just cash in and believe it you know we get so used to coming to church and just hearing a servant like a a a a a a conference get some information this is not about information this is about life the word of God brings life he said my words are spirit and they are alive amen and we got to catch him not the dead letter the dead letter is not going to do anything for us it won't make us walk out of here hole but the Living Word will The Living Word will Psalms 20 verse 7 says some trust in chariots some in horses but we will remember the name of our Lord our God now when we're bothered we're troubled we're overwhelmed we need to remember the Rock remember to cry out for God to lead you to the place higher than where you're at because a lot of times when we're bothered I mean just just naturally think about this I'm going I'm on my way I'm driving I get a flat tire I I pull over I make a phone call not gonna be there start pulling out the our mind is thinking about how could this happen to me right now and we're not remembering that somehow this could all be in God's Providence this could all be part of the plan of God and so we could get frustrated and bothered about the situation or we can just rest our thoughts on God and he could lift us above this situation yeah we still got to deal with the tire yeah we do but we're not bothered anymore and I'll tell you there's so many times the course of the day we can learn to practice those little things that when the big things happen to us we could learn how to be at peace with those big things God doesn't teach his children through a learning curriculum just come to church sit around and learn no character is built when we make the right choice in the middle of our trials we're either going to Remember The Rock or we're just going to take life in our hands now sometimes God leads us to a rock that is higher than us by speaking a word that we need to obey I want you to catch this how is God going to lead me to the rock that is higher than me he's going to speak to you a word that he wants you to obey and when you obey that word then you'll be lit then you will be lifted up above your trial amen I want you to catch that Matt on Matthew 7 verse 24 somebody getting something out of this I'll tell you I am just having a wonderful time in the Lord up here Matthew 7 verse 24 therefore whosoever here are these sayings of mine and do with them I will liken him unto a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain decided the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not for it was founded upon a Rock Amen his word is The Rock so sometimes the word that he speaks to us will be trust me just trust me and sometimes the word that he'll speak to us will be obey me whatever it is you got to do it and I'll tell you when you're when you feel overwhelmed no matter which one it is it's hard to do when you're overwhelmed it's hard to trust and it's hard to do what he tells you to do but that is if you follow what he said that is how he's leading you to the rock that is higher than you we just can't you know haphazardly imagine that there's some rock up there that somehow you know just kind of poofed me up there no there's a reality of what's going on in our life God is real we may not be thinking of the middle of the day but he's thinking about us all the time now I know the thoughts I think towards you saith the Lord he hasn't expected and for the believer who also believes in expected end he's coming for those who love his appearing amen all right brother Rand said in the message the reaction to an action he says and if you're sure that you're born to the spirit of God that you have the Holy Ghost and the promise of God is yours I don't care what the devil does you can still rest assure Faith takes its unmovable stand faith cannot rest upon the shifting Sands of man's theology but it takes a solemn stand on the Rock of Ages which is unmovable there is a rest with Assurance no matter what comes or what goals my faith holds so no matter what the devil tries to tell you just tell him I won't be moved here here's what I have learned when I'm getting down to pray and there's a lot of battles that happen when you get serious about getting down to pray in the battles that go on is all the thoughts that you get different than why you actually got down to pray I mean sometimes we get done to pray about our situation but even when we do that we don't we don't kneel down a lot of times in faith we kneel down and oh Lord what about this I'm worried about this and what if this ends and what'll I do here Lord God wants us to kneel down in faith to start believing that greater is he that's in thee than he that's in the world greater Is God that's in me than this devil that's trying to talk to my head right now sometimes we're just too afraid are too proud to admit that the devil's speaking to us they don't know the devil ain't bothering me the devil ain't moving me that he's not and why are you acting the way you're acting yeah why are you gold why why are you choosing not to have the victory when you can have the victory a lot of times the devil will try to get us to lean on our own understanding because he wants to say how smart you are we need to recognize and resist those Temptations Deuteronomy 32 verse 31 says for their rock is not our Rock for the rock is not our Rock everybody doesn't trust in the same thing right we need to remember our Rock our rock is different than our own understanding amen Psalm 78 verse 35 says and they remembered that God was The Rock and the high tower and the high tower the Redeemer remember the rock that is calling you higher than where you're presently standing there is a rock higher than your situation we need to remember that because the devil wants to distract us from that to take us our thoughts away from that there's actually an answer right here I don't need this trial taken away from me but there's an answer right here and we need to remember that rock first Samuel 2 2 says there is none holy as the Lord but there is none for there is none beside thee neither is there any Rock like our God like our God Amen Deuteronomy 32 verse 4 it says he is the rock his work is perfect for all his ways our judgment a god of Truth and without iniquity just and right is he how many can say God Is My Rock he is my rock it's got to be a personal now we must approach this rock in close of humility now he hides himself from the wise and the prudent but he will reveal himself from those who wear clothes of humility I believe that the Bible says that Moses was a Meek man I believe at that time that it was spoken that he was the meekest man on the on the planet I don't think it's a bad characteristic to be meek do you I think we could all use a little bit more of that don't you know Exodus chapter 32 verse 20. Exodus 33 verse 20 God told Moses thou canst not see my face for there shall no man see me and live and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shall stand upon a rock notice where the rock is at it is beside Christ amen and it shall come to pass that while my glory passes by that I will put thee in the cleft of The Rock and we'll cover thee with my hand while I pass by Hallelujah there's a rock for us today God is literally leading us up to where he's at not down here think about the analogy that brother Brandon gave about the eagle in the barnyard God is always calling us to come out of our situation to come out of Doubt to come out of fear to come out of worry to come out of this thing that hinders God it's like puts handcuffs on God when we don't trust him and we think it's okay to be a Christian and not trust God you show me that in the Bible look I understand that we all slept we all fail we all go through things but what I am saying to you we're not allowed to sit around and do nothing we need a cry out to God we need to do what this Bible gives us an example to cry out to God and say God help me lead me to that rock that's higher than don't come to church and lead the same way you came God is calling us higher [Music] remember the rock there's a place by me and thou shall stand upon a rock God is a rot by his side for each and every one of us today Psalms 18 verse 2 says the Lord is my rock and my Fortress and my deliverer and my God in whom I will trust can you say that today I will trust my buckler my horn the Horn of my salvation and my high tower it sounds to me that uh God is is is you're all in all here yes that no matter what the problem is God Is The Answer amen and look at verse three I will call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised and so shall I be saved from my enemies that's what David wanted he wanted to be saved from the situation and I'll tell you the biggest enemy that we have is ourselves we're the one that's not trusting God we think our enemy is this is my enemy no that none of these people are your enemy look in the mirror if you want to see your enemy because if you yield yourself to God the devil won't be able to get near you devil can't do anything else he's got a vessel to work through all right turn with me about I think this is time is wrapping up but I want to go to Psalms 27 if we could Psalms 27. all right I don't hear many pages going so for those that don't got a Bible we're going to put on the board the Bible says is the Psalms of David here the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is the strength of My Life whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and they fell and look at his testimony here though a host should a camp against me my heart shall not fear can you honestly say that in your trials though this situation is going on my heart will not fear because this is spiritual this is Eagle food this is not some learning seminar because you will be faced with the test in a trial and you'll automatically you're going to fear or have faith but David is telling he says my heart shall not fear though War should rise against me in this will I be confident he said one thing if I desire to the Lord and that why I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temper now don't you want to be in that place where Jesus is at amen for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me up on a rock so in his Pavilion in his Tabernacle where he is at he has a rock he has a word when he speaks to you a word for that situation you don't have to be in this building but you have to be connected to him [Music] there's no way that David could literally spent his whole lifetime in the sanctuary he could spend his whole life with God though he knew there was a rock there and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me notice that just like those little mountain goats they're looking down at all those Predators trying to get to and they can't get to him and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round above me therefore what I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy I will sing yea I will sing praises unto the Lord I'll tell you I don't think we should ever ever go a service without giving God our full effort in praising him you know it isn't like you're here 24 7. you come here for a little bit I think you should give them your best hear O Lord when I cry with my voice have mercy also upon me and answer me and he goes back and he says when you said Lord you need to spend time seeking my face my heart sent back to thee Lord thy face Lord will I seek look it sometimes God puts you in a situation because he wants you to get on your knees and seek him hide not thy face far from me put not thy servant away in Anger thou has been my help leaving not neither forsake me o God of my salvation notice you know I don't believe David was stumbling about his salvation I don't think he was stumbling about his relationship with God as as if um you know he was going to be eternally disconnected from God he was unchristianized no Jesus said abide in me abide in the vine you cannot do anything without me without me you could do nothing and we need to stay connected to God it don't just happen because your name hasn't changed because you're still living at the same house you're going to the same church you're saying you believe look at there's many people that believe the Bible there's many people that believe they say they believe this message but is this message inside of them it's got to be real to you he said when my father and my mother forsake me then the Lord will take me up teach me thy way O Lord and leave me lead me in a plane path because of my enemies delivering me not over to the will of my enemies for false Witnesses are risen up against me and and such as breathe out cruelty nah don't you ever be found breathing out cruelty don't you ever do that he said I had fainted unless I had believed to see the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living and look at how this this beautiful Psalms ends up wait on the Lord be of good courage and he shall strengthen thy heart wait I say on the Lord amen amen hallelujah kind of just do one more Psalms 4 40 verse 1 says I waited patiently for the Lord and he inclined unto me and heard My Cry he brought me up also out of a horrible pit out of the Miry clay and set my feet upon a rock and established my goings yes amen God bless you let's Stand Together God wants to establish our goings amen when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is higher than I so when your heart gets overwhelmed remember there's a rock and remember that rock is Christ and that he has a word for you to get where he's at because where he's at just when you remember the rock remember he's a God that's not bothered that's what's happening in Russia what's happening in Israel what's happening in California he's not bothered in fact I believe God's probably hearing more today brother Orlando he's hearing his bride more today say come Lord Jesus come quickly come Lord we want you we're so sick of this world there's got to be more than there is here so don't be moved God's got everything in control what we need to do is just start working on our personal relationship with God I hate to make it so simple but it is that simple we can't just we're not going to come here in here as a group of people and just somehow somehow automatically become the bride of Christ just because we we gather together twice a week we've got to take this word and make it personal for our lives amen let's sing without him I could do nothing [Music] [Music] without him away [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] I lost I would be [Music] without him but with Jesus thank God Jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] this is of anchored save me in glory [Music] for without him [Music] oh Jesus [Music] yes [Music] I am more [Music] thank you you're all right [Music] in this world [Music] you know to be more like [Music] you [Music] with me amen she continues to play that quietly if I could just get each of you to know your your heads your heart and just and respect to the Lord God is has spoken I trust to every one of our hearts in some way this morning he's definitely given us a way of Escape he's reminded us of a rock that's higher than us higher than our situations I wonder if there'd be someone here today said brother John would you would you remember me that that when I'm going through a trial and I'll remember the word that God gave us today God bless these hands God beautiful amen I wonder if there'd be someone here today that's been really resisting the enemy resisting but just can't seem to break through say brother John I'm really looking for a victory would you pray for me today amen God bless these hands [Music] praise the Lord I wonder if there'd be anyone here today hasn't been submitting to the Lord I know this is a very awful thing to ask but foreign [Music] we come to you Lord for your children Lord Lord you see the various needs that are here in our midst Lord father you poured out your heart to your people and now Lord your people are pouring their heart out to you and they're expressing nor they need your help they need you they need you to bring remembrance that rock you said when the Holy Ghost comes he'll bring all things she remembers and Lord there's some Lord that are just praying God would you remember them today Lord in this prayer that when they're going through a difficult time lord instead of just letting lucid and just letting things get cared on out of cater Lord that they would just remember that there's a rock higher than their situation may you bless each one father that had raised their head and said God would you remember me oh granted heavenly father and father we pray Lord for those that are looking for victory Lord in their life over this enemy that keeps pastoring them that's coming against them Lord you said when the enemy comes in like a flood that you you you you would raise up a standard

regret it Lord I pray for these hands and these hearts Lord that have found found it difficult in themselves to yield themselves to you and obey the things that you've asked them to do God I prayed this morning that they could find Victory as they surrender to you surrender to you Lord Jesus surrender their will surrender them their thoughts and Lord everything that they have to deny themselves Lord you said that was that first requirement to follow you and I pray Lord Jesus as you as they surrender Lord as they go through that three more agency and they say Lord not my will but thy will be done I pray that you would come down and the power of the Holy Spirit and fill their very vessel with such a such a power Lord they would have a joy to serve you Lord that it would be such a victory to serve you Lord it wouldn't be Grievous but it'd be full of joy oh granted today Lord we believe in you Lord we believe in your presence is here today Lord we and we are your believing children Lord
