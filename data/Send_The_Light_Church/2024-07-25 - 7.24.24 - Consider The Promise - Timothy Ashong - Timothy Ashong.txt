day that will beise Lord so let's keep trusting the Lord for soon and very soon we shall see the king Hallelujah let's read this evening from The Book of Romans chapter 4 and just to encourage ourselves Romans chapter 4 let us read from verse 13 Romans 4 13 down for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of Faith amen for if they which are of the Lord be H faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law WTH rough but where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even God who quickeneth the dead and call those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about 100 years old neither yet the deadness of Sir womb he ster not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in Faith giving glory to God Amen and be fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able also to perform right therefore it was imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him but to us also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who was delivered for our offences and was raised again for our justification may the Lord bless the reading of his word amen shall we please be seated praise the Lord hallelujah so we once again greet you in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen and I want to thank you again for giving me this opportunity to be here and brother John the pastor giving me the right hand of fellowship and he always give me the open door to com in so once again say God bless you Pastor pastor and uh I want to thank brother Ron and the wife for taking care of me uh they've treated me very very well nicely wonderfully and uh I say God bless you yeah for all your efforts and your care and say to me that oh everything fine food and clothing wash and may the Lord richly bless you and God bless every one of you for your prayers I really appreciate that and uh I still CT your prayers and uh we allow another prayer so let's continue to pray for one another amen we are looking forward that soon and very soon one of these days the meeting will be in the air will not be coming here we meeting up in the air yes it is a promise that the lord gave us and he always keeps his promises Hallelujah and so this evening just to encourage ourselves we are speaking on consider the promises of God am consider the promises of God we are speaking of this great character in the scriptures that is the man Abraham a great character and he was called the friend of God think about it a man that God said to himself when he was on his way to destroy Sodom and gomorra and God stopped and he said should I hide this from Abraham God said no I will tell him about it and he spoke and talked to God as a friend and he put a request to God what about this why don't you do it this way and go well if I get 40 men I get I will not say oh no okay what about if you don't get 40 what about that and God said um okay okay if I get 30 that would be okay okay but if you don't get 30 what are you going to do and he as a friend what a wonderful thing to be a friend of God Amen and so Jesus said I call you not servants ye are my friends amen so we are his friends What a Wonder ful people we are what a blessed people we are we should not forget who we are and we should make sure we don't lose our identities am cuz it's very po important not to lose your identity because we are in the world that people don't know who they are whether they are men or they are women they are boys or they are girls or they they the the people have lost their identity right Men Behaving like women women behaving like men yes you know may God help us there is something about a Christian that word Christian means Christlike amen so that name that we call ourselves or put upon us we should not allow anything for that name to be questioned Christ because whatever we do it reflect on the Lord because when you say Christian is Christlike right amen so everything that we are doing today it reflects on the Lord amen may God help us that our lives our conduct and behavior will glorify the Lord Jesus Christ the righteous one the just one the one man that stood there and pilate said I find no fault with him even Judas who betrayed him said I found no F I have betrayed the innocent blood and Herod said he didn't find fault with him may God help us to live such a life amen that his name will be glorified so the prophet phet of God I read from me said we are speaking tonight upon faith and I thought it would be nice maybe if we would use this great character of Abraham for an example of Faith because it was to Abraham the promise was given and we will kind of review the life of Abraham just a little because he was an outstanding character and he was a man who believed God he was an outstanding character and he was a man who believed in God may the Lord help us and now he had no great background of no great background to believe God because it's commonly believed that he was from a family of idolators idol worshippers he came down from Babylon his family dwelt in their land in the land of the chadians the city of O The Valleys of sha and was just an ordinary man so he was not not an angel he was an ordinary man and we read in the scripture how God called him say Abraham or Abraham come out from your nation from your Kindred from your father's house and I will show you where to go hallelujah amen so as God called Abraham that is how he called every Seed of Abraham and remember that God's word always calls for total separation from unbelief amen from unbelief God want us to believe his word because a man and his word is the same so God and His word is the same just like you and your word is the same amen so if you say one thing and you do something else that is hypocrisy so we are taught in the scriptures that our Y Must Be Y and our n might be n amen praise the Lord amen may the Lord help us so this great character Abraham that what was called from the land of Babylon from idol worship praise the Lord and he said he had no great background of to believe God because it is commonly believed that he was from a family of idol worshippers so he had no background that oh the Father the parent no no no no they were all ID the worshippers and he was called and he said here and uh he he was an ordinary man just like you and just like me right and he said he wasn't no angel he was just a man like you and I and God looking over the Earth to see for a man that he could put confidence in God looking over the Earth to see a man that he could put confidence in God uses a man God ants for a man amen he always uses man because man is God's agent that's why when when he want to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt he was looking for a man the Bible say when he came down he heard the Cry of the children of Israel nobody knew what was happening the children of Israel were being Afflicted they were being persecuted they were being tormented they did not go to Egypt as slaves when they were in Egypt they had the best because of Joseph they were very special they were given everything the best but then the Bible says there arose a pharaoh that didn't know Joseph and because the time that God gave the promise was at hand because God had told Abraham years back amen when Abraham had known child God gave a promise to him and God told him your seed will be in a Strange Land for 400 years right amen and after that I will come and I will deliver them why did he choose 400 years I don't know but that's his choice that's what he said so God has a purpose for everything yeah amen God don't please man he pleases himself amen and none of us are here just for being here we are here for a purpose and somebody brought us here and the one that brought us here has a purpose for it he a god of varieties yes he is so he give somebody black skin and yellow skin and whatever we are all colored people amen color blue color yellow we are all colored amen because he's a god of variety he made the mountains and he made The Valleys am he made tall people and short people he's God he doesn't make mistakes Hallelujah so we should be glad and we should be happy for what God has made us amen hallelujah we should be thankful to God for making us the way he has made us we should maintain it amen hallelujah because it's not by mistake that we are the way we are blessed be the name of the Lord this word we are in today remember if you're a Christian the Bible tells us that this word is not our own we are strangers we are pilgrims on Earth and God don't want us to lose our focus of that we are going somewhere he don't want us to conform to this word amen he said we should be conformed to Christ amen to his word amen may the Lord help us amen hallelujah so he c as he came on the Mount and then he saw this young man there oh he was about maybe 40 years because he Liv in 40 years he went to the back side of the desert 40 years he came back for 40 years so he had three 40s so at this time maybe about uh he was a man of maybe about 40 years or 40 something years or whatever age and God called him said I have seen the Affliction of my people it was God that told him I have heard the Cry of my people right so remember this he hears your cry amen he hears your prayers he knows all that is happening amen and he has appointed a time for deliverance a time for manifestation he came and he told Moses Moses didn't know he said but I am the god of Abraham I am the god of Isaac I am the god of Israel I am the god of your father and your mother the amra and yed I am that God that's right Hallelujah he's God today he knows about our afflictions he knows about our trials he knows about our pains he knows everything he has not forgotten you and he will not forget any of his own his promises are yeah and amen and remember he watches over his word to perform it and so he meets this man and he said he called his name he said Moses and he knows your name too am he knows your name he know wherever you are at any time Hallelujah he knows all about it because he's the god of creation that created the heavens and the Earth that knows everything that is happening today in America and the world I say oh amen every flee and every fly he knows all and he knows the thoughts that we think that's why he told Moses even when they were to leave Egypt he told Moses pass this way and when you pass this way the way of the Red Sea Pharaoh will think you are stranded and he will come after you and I will meet him there he know all things Jesus speaking to the disciples and telling them about the crucifixion and he told them what will happen to him and I'm going to Jerusalem and this will happen and when he was to enter Jerusalem say you go to this side you meet a man he's carrying something and ask that man where is that chamber for the master to have supper with his people and He will show you a place so he knows all amen Hallelujah that's the God we are serving today and when you know that this is the God you are serving it will make you to relax amen and you will rest because Christianity is resting yes resting rest resting in your God Amen knowing that he knows all about it and that nothing can overtake him right and also nothing can happen to you without he knowing it in know all because our life Journey has been pre-planned and pre-arranged by him so he knows whatever will be at every Junction every mile of the way that is the God we are Serv and this God want you to believe him am that I am the Creator that's why told Moses I am that I am amen I am the beginning and I am the End Amen I am the alpha and I am the Omega I am the way and I am the truth I am the all in all I am the Healer I am the deliverer I am your protection I am your peace I am your joy I am your way I am your life I am everything to you amen I know all about it amen he knows all about you am Hallelujah he want us to believe him yes he said to Moses I have seen also he sees too I have seen and I have heard so he says us it does not matter where you are it does not matter the condition it does not matter what it sees as because his eyes is on us and he watches over Us by day and by night remember there is no darkness in his sight day and night is the same to God it don't use light electricity doesn't use it it doesn't need it that's why in the city for square there will not be the sunand light there we will not need this s o n and we don't need electricity there the Bible said the lamp shall be the light of the city amen amen the City for square think on God's promises he gives strength and he gives courage amen I've seen it I've heard it and I have come down but I want to send you he has no hands but your hands no legs or feet but ours so he wants us to surrender to him and when we surrender to him then just like this coat he will wear it right so you become his coat he dress in you he walk in you he speaks in us he does whatever he does through us may the Lord help usen so that we can yield to him amen we can surrender to him when he was to send Moses and he spoke to Moses Moses said who am I how can I go to Pharaoh because he has run away from Egypt and they want to kill him and God say you don't have to worry about that I will go with you I will go with you oh may God go with us am and may we have that assurance that he said he will not leave us so he is with us no matter the challenge is more than able to s as true hallelujah hallelujah so remember this great character Abraham he wasn't no angel he was just a man like you and I and God looking over the Earth to see for a man that he could put confidence in he wanted somebody that he could put confidence in right and somebody he will who will believe him regardless of the circumstances God looking over the Earth to see for a man that he could put confidence in that will believe him regardless of the circumstances amen somebody that he God could put confidence in amen somebody that he could trust regardless of the circumstances somebody that will say yes I stand on the side of God I believe God I'm holding on to God Amen regardless of the circumstance will he find somebody here today because he's still looking for somebody here amen somebody that he could put confidence in somebody that he know will take my word somebody that oh like job said when he tried me I will come out as pure good job said for I esteem his word more than my necessary food and when God tried me I will come out as pure God Amen somebody that could say for me to live is Christ am and to die is gain amen somebody that will take God at his regardless of what he will stand on God's word may God find us today may we be the people that can say this is my beloved daughter here my beloved Son my beloved child I'm pleased to D it that will be pleased to trust you he'll be pleased to send you he'll be pleased to commission you send you and you know that she will go she will stand she will not fear like Daniel even if he has to go to the lion regardless of the circumstances regardless of the regardless of the second that will stand like shadra mesach and Abednego our God God is able to deliver us even if he does it will not bow regardless somebody that he could put confidence in who will stand for him regardless of the Fashions of the day regardless of the thinking of men regardless of what the nation will say regardless of this age we are living in regardless of the popular belief and popular opinion somebody that God could put confidence in no matter what the age has t to be praise the Lord he was not an angel he was just a man like you and I and God looking over the Earth to see for a man that he could put confidence in that will believe him regardless of the circumstances he found Abraham and called in by election looking for somebody there were many people living in the days of Abraham Abraham had brothers and he had sisters too he had his father and there were others living in that day and God was hunting for a man right he went to the knowledgeable people people educated and this and that he could not find any he's looking for man when he met Moses at the back side of the desert and the the the the the tree was on fire and there was God on the mountain the God on the tree there amen there was a supernatural art over there right and it was burning and until Moses said let me now turn so he has seen it amen it was there it was on the the fire was there Moses was busy Moses was busy then something ah what is this let me now turn and see what is happening May God help us not to miss that sign he might be trying to draw your attention there might be things happening around and here and there and it might be trying to draw your attention amen but sometime we get so busy too occupied thinking about this and worry about this and worry about that and busy Moses was busy running after sheep running after this running after this here and there and here and there and God was with him oh patient God God of patience he's

God was quiet God told Satan have you considered my servant job that there is nobody like him right amen Jo Satan said yeah is it not because you have done this you have done this you are protecting him you are doing this and that that's why he's serving God but this is what I said Satan said because you've made the edge over job and my question is that how did the devil know that God has made a

amen as our Father Abraham Oho man he did not consider the deadness of serious womb he only considered what God said he didn't even consider his own body now weak no he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief right he was strong giving praise to God if God didn't do it today if it didn't happen today it will happen next year and you don't consider anything else how impossible it is don't consider what the doctor said you don't consider what mama said or what Papa said what the preacher said just consider what God Said and if we be the children of Abraham we've got to have that kind of Faith amen regardless of what the symptoms say like Jonah when he was swallowed by the fish he didn't consider those symtoms think about a man in the belly of a fish swallowed by a fish Jonah in the belly of the fish at the bottom of the sea lying down there and Jonah said these are lying vanities I'm not going to consider these things I'm not considering where I am I'm considering the word of the Lord the word of the Lord said if we are in trouble and we look up to the temple and pray God will hear our prayer so he did not consider where he was he did not consider the womb of the of the of the of the whe he did not consider all the RS that were around him he did not consider the dep of the ocean where the fish was late sleeping he didn't consider he only considered the promise God say so and he said now I will look to the temple how did he look to the temple by faith amen because in the belly of the way how is he going to turn and no no no but by faith he set his mind he I'm looking to the temple I'm looking to the promise I'm holding to the word of the Lord God says so that wherever will be he didn't mention when he was given a promise they didn't mention whe or fish he said wherever whatever the condition whatever the situation if you look to this Temple and pray I will hear you and job the Bible say Jonah he looked to the temple how I don't know I just believe what the Bible said and he prayed and he said I'm not going to observe these things these are Liv ities yes the doctor said this yes I'm feeling this yes it's this he didn't look at that he said God is able he said God is able he said God you can do it for me Lord You Are My Savior yes I've done wrong but be merciful to me make a way for me bring me out of this problem change the situation Jehovah of Miracles he considered that promise and the Bible say when he prayed God spoke to the fish think about that God spoke to the fish fish your time your holiday is over get up take him to nineve and the fish obey wow everything obey Jehovah fish whatever obeys Our God and the fish obey the voice of God am and the fish move out move out why didn't Jonah die there because God has a purpose for his life am he has to preach the gospel he has to go and testify amen woo Hallelujah If Abraham didn't consider the deadness of sah womb but said what about your own body that is alive Sarah's body was dead Sarah's womb was dead and abrah didn't consider that and God came down what about your body what about us is your body dead your body is not dead Sarah's body was dead Sarah was dead but God changed it hallelujah oh praise be to God may the Lord help us look at Noah way back in Genesis when God spoke to Noah that day the word of the Lord came to Noah and told him to build an ark for the saving of his household and you know the word stood upright before the anti anti- Delian destruction it wasn't leaning back like this today to bring water and when God told Noah he was going to send a flood a rain why you know he had critics but Faith doesn't look at what the circumstances is Faith looks to what God says faith don't try to rais him Faith just TS God at his faith value yes Hallelujah may God help us my brothers and my sisters consider the promise consider what God said why the children of Israel failed because they were looking at the Anakin when they came to Kadesh Bania when they were to enter the promised land amen they've been there for years they've been on this journey for 40 years or some years that they've traveled from place to place now the time to enter the land and Moses said go and look and see what the land is like the Bible say they came back with an evil report yeah the anakites are there and the jeites are there and this one is there and the fence is there and the doctor said this and this one said that and this the all those things they didn't consider a promise but Joshua and calb considered the promise amen that God said so so God has given us the land this is what he told Moses and he said to that he said this to Moses because he told Abraham Our Father oh Hallelujah consider the promise don't look at the obstacles and the problems and the doctor say this and my body say this and they said consider what God Said consider the promise of God I am more than able I am the way I am the truth I am the life they consider what God Said I have given you the land listen I just look at the map here and I look at the Nations surrounding Israel the Nations that are against Israel almost the whole world is against Israel how big is that nation very small very small if it had not been the Lord there will no there will be no Nation called Israel but God said I will them and I will bring them back they were scattered and they were brought back 1948 they were declare a nation ever since from the first day they were declare a nation to today it have been fighting but listen we before that Israel still remain the best of everything in this world the best army the best efforts the best agricultural Nation the best in heti the small nation amen because God has blessed them God told Abraham I will bless your seed amen look at the Nations surround them if be if not because of their trust in God they would have been wiped off true but even to today they are still claiming it they still holding to the promise the other day the Ambassador Israel's ambassador to the United Nation Gillard and he was say said he went back to Genesis he said in in the book of Exodus when our fathers were in Egypt and the Egyptians thought of destroying us he said you know what when they were persecuting our people our people grew stronger he said today we will grow stronger these people are always speaking about the Bible the promises that was given to Abraham they said our connection oh my goodness amen when David benu before Israel was declared nation and they said look this land of Palestine belong to us and they called the Arab people why is your own okay if you are claiming the land where is your proof they didn't have it they David benri stood up and he said he took the Bible he said this is our approve the Bible is our proof that's our document that God said the land is for us so that's our document and to today what are they talking about the Bible it said our connection to this land has been since the days of Abraham over 3,000 years that's our connection to the land this land belong to us consider the promise consider the promise and I want to say to you no Nation can wipe off Israel right no Nation no power not even America America America you can keep your weapons and refuse to give Israel God will fight for Israel every time in the days of Joshua when they were fighting and at a point Joshua has to stop the Son and the people he killed and some people were running you know where the Bible said he said God raised stones from Heaven and those that were killed by the Stones were more than those who died in the war god stoned them on from Heaven head Stones hit the enemies God know how to do it I'm telling you God will fight for you don't worry God will defend you God will protect his children no matter what surrounds us no matter who come against us the god that is with us and the god that is in US is greater than the devil that is in the word have faith in God consider the promise you will never be alone you are not alone you will never be alone you are not alone you will never be alone because Jesus said I will never leave you and I will never forsake you when you pass through the waters I will be with you there when you go through the Flames I will be with you god promis us consider the promises of God they are Y and they are amen may God be with us we still have
