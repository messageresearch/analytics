in after the four wheels amen amen well turn with me if you would to the Book of Job we have kind of a lengthy reading I'd like to read the the first chapter of job and then heavy BCD I hope that that's okay if you need to see it sooner you you may amen before we begin reading let's just look to the the author of this book lord we know that this story The Book of Job is not here just as an entertainment but there are some real nuggets Lord in here father we thank you that you have put it in your book lord for our admonition and we pray that you would take the preeminence now in the ministry of the word Lord whether it would be spoken from our lips or Lord that you would just speak it to the hearts and minds of your Peoples the word is coming forth may you bless the ears that they would hear exactly what you'd have them to to hear today we ask that Revelation would just flood each of us Lord that we could leave here with a seed that been planted and that it could come forth in its proper season amen we commit this service the reading of your word now into your hands for your honor and Glory we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen there was a man in the land of us whose name was job and that man was perfect and upright and one that feared God and exceed evil now when God's talking to Satan he says the same thing showing that What God Says and the word is exactly the same amen amen and there were born unto him seven sons and three daughters his substance also was seven thousand sheep and and three thousand candles and 500 yoke of oxen and 500 she asses and a very great household so that this man was the greatest of all the men of the East and his sons went and feasted in their houses and everyone his house and everyone his date and sat and called for their three sisters to eat and to drink with them and it was so when the days of their feasting were gone about that job sat and Sanctified them and Rose early in the morning and offered burnt offerings according to the number of them all for job said it may be that my sons have sinned and cursed God in their hearts notice where it happened thus did job continually amen good example for us now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the Lord and Satan came also among them and the Lord said unto Satan once cometh thou and then Satan answered the Lord and said from going to control and all the Earth and from walking up and down in it and the Lord said unto Satan has thou considered my servant job there's none like him in all in the earth a perfect and upright man one that feareth God and excuse evil then Satan answered the Lord and said doth job fear God for naught has not Thou made a hedge about him and about his house and about all that he hath on every side that was blessed the work of his hands and his substance is increased in the land but put forth thine hand now and touch all that he have and he will curse thee to thy face the Lord said unto Satan behold all that he have is in thy power only upon himself put not forth thine hand so Satan went forth from the presence of the Lord there was a day when his sons and his daughters were eating and drinking wine and the elders brother's house and there came a messenger unto job and said The Oxen were plowing and the asses feeding beside them and the Siberian sibians fell upon them and took them away yeah have slayed the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped alone to tell thee while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up notice where he said it came from Heaven the fire of God has fallen from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them and I and only am I only am escaped alone to tell thee and while he was yet speaking there came also another and said the Chaldeans made out three bands and fell upon the camels and have carried them away yea and slain the servants with the edge of the sword and I only am escaped alone to tell thee and while I was yet speaking there came also another and said thy sons and thy daughters were eating and drinking wine in their eldest brother's house and behold there came a great win from the Wilderness and smote the four corners of the house and it fell upon the young men and and they are dead and I only am escaped alone to tell thee then jobber Rose rent and rent his mantle shaved his head fell down on the ground and worshiped and said naked came I out of my mother's womb and naked shall I return dither and the lord gave and the Lord have taken away blessed be the name of the Lord notice this verse in all this job said not nor charge God foolishly amen amen God bless you may be seated this is quite a story and I hope you excuse me for my fast reading there but you are all familiar with the story of job anyways amen amen now notice here this was really a situation between God and Satan God who's the greatest and Satan who was the second greatest and and job was just in the crosshairs of this battle it was a conflict between Good and Evil and job's life was the battlefield and we we need to understand sometimes we're going through trials and we take it personally yeah see Satan never disputed how good job was never disputed that but Satan disputed job's motive and it was really a dig towards God's in integrity he said the reason the only reason that job is serving you so perfectly is that you have blessed them you put a hedge of protection around him and his family in his home on every side and you've increased his substance Beyond expectation yeah he's going to serve you perfectly but it is not a pure love it's because he's getting something out of it and you know there's there are believers who serve God because of what they can get out of it right Satan said put forth on hand now and touch all that he have and he will curse thee to thy face see Satan was challenging God's integrity Satan was accusing God that he didn't have a love relationship with job and that job did not have a love relationship with him and that he or God was actually manipulating job with blessings this is what was going on right and of course God won't have any of that God wanted to prove job's relationship with him job was a special man Noah was a special man he found Grace in the sight of God Moses was special Enoch was definitely special Joshua was special Joseph was special Paul was was special and I hope each one of you feel the same way this morning Deuteronomy 7 6 the Lord thy God have chosen thee to be a special people unto himself above all the people that is on the face of the Earth and he set his love upon us and chose us because he loves us right so there is the foundation for our relationship and though job was very special Saul was his trials job lost all his prosperity his all his children died he suffered great physical Agony and in the midst of all his sufferings job's closest friends were accusing him of transgressions right right now I don't care what trial you're going through what you've been through it can't compare with job and not that we want to compare trials but we do need to compare how we're reacting in our trials because that's what's important amen no if we're going to give this little message a title I like to entitle it meeting God in your trials amen amen but before we get to meeting God in our trials this morning I want to talk about meeting him with a revelation of Who We Are job knew who God was he knew who he belonged to he knew who had the final say-so in his life there was something inside of job that made him look at life and and that included his trials what he was going through in a different way than what most people looked at God wouldn't allow this to happen to job unless it was somehow going to work out for the good because job knew that God was a good God and everything he did was good even when he created Lucifer he was good he was perfect you can't point a finger at God at any time and say what God did was not good you just can't because he's a good God as we learned that a word is a thought expressed in God's thoughts are higher than our thoughts what we normally think his thoughts are eternal our thoughts are temporal in the samura church age brother Brandon says the Eternal thoughts of God let me ask you are the thoughts of God eternal he said if you can see this you will see many things God is unchangeable in both Essence and behavior that means he's the same yesterday today and forever he's never going to change God is infinite in his ability so therefore he is as God uh so therefore he as God must be omniscient in other words he knows everything so if he knows everything and he only does good we don't have to worry about anything right job 42 verse 2 says I know uh you don't need to turn there I know that thou can't do everything and that no thought can be withholden from thee so job knew had a good idea who God was it's important when you're going through trials to know who God is amen he said if he knows everything then he knows not now learning he's not now learning nor is he taking counsel even with himself nor is he at any time adding to his knowledge if he can add to his knowledge then he's not omniscient he has never had a new thought about anything that was such an amazing statement he has never had a new thought about him you know we get up and every day we're learning right we love learning we like watching the discovery trial we like learning how to do something faster and but with God you can't because all his thoughts he has always had and always will have and knows the end from the beginning because he's God thus the thoughts of God are eternal they are real they are not simply like a man right with a blueprint he has drawn up which one day he would translate into substance and form but they are already real Eternal and a part of God 's thoughts are not like our thoughts amen we can think a whole bunch of thoughts and at the end of the day probably 95 percent of them weren't even true right yes that's true but when God thinks brother Brandon says they are real they are a hundred percent one hundred percent of the time real amen there's no mistakes brother Brandon said the questions and answers before there was a world before there was a planet before there was a sun before there was a moon before there was light before there was anything when it was still God God and His Thoughts the Eternal thoughts of God chose you chose you by predestination by foreknowledge to know that you would be on the earth and to know there would be sin so we're serving a god who knows the trial that we either came out of are in or going into before it ever happens there's no surprise with God and this is important to have this understanding so we're just not blown away the Eternal thoughts of God chose you by predestination he put your name there we didn't have to do anything he did it all right to me that's just mind-blowing John 15 16 says ye have not chosen me but I have chosen you now notice you do have a part to play and we're going to get into this a little bit later in the message you must will your will to the Eternal thoughts of God Amen you can't keep your thoughts and expect to be predestinated you can't hold on to your will your thoughts your way and expect that by God's foreknowledge you're going to make it right no you have a part to play God played his part but you got to Play Your Part you have not chosen me but I've chosen you know I ordained you that ye should go and bring forth fruit that your fruit should remain in other words you have a part to play I have a part to play you have a part to play God has his part and then he said that whatsoever you should ask in the in my uh ask the father in my name he will give it to you now notice that comes after you do your part so many people want to claim the promises of God and they don't really care about the relationship part you know this promise is for everybody this promise isn't really for everybody it's for whoever can't believe yes but is God going to give you faith for promises all the time when you are not doing what he's asked you to do come on now I mean it's the word you should still be excited about it that's all I can say these things I command you that you love one another now he said to murder Church age brother Branham said he says so when Adam was formed of the Dust of the earth and his spiritual being created by God then Adam became God's thought expressed and those Eternal thoughts were now manifested amen amen now down through the centuries we go we find Moses and Jeremiah John the Baptist and each one of these were God's Eternal thoughts expressed in its season why are you reading that brother John because you are God's Eternal thought expressed in a season and you have to go through your child you won't be going through job's trial you won't be going through Moses's trial but you will be going through your trial and you must meet God there you got to know where you're standing now if God's thoughts are eternal where does that puts you in God's thoughts he thought of you he spoke of you and now you are going to manifest what he thought of you yes yeah God never intended and ever intended when he called any of us that we would slip away that we would revert but when he called us he predestinated us to be Overcomers to be in His image when this was over and we must keep focused on that yes yes you know the scripture Jeremiah fry I know the thoughts I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end amen now these thoughts of you are just as eternal it's it's God wants to give us an expected end they must come to pass they his his word his thought his word being the same right will not return unto him void it's got to accomplish what it was intended for now job knew who he was he knew was somehow connected to the Eternal God and if we could go through life and all of our trials with this Revelation then we could really have more confidence that somehow God is going to see us through the Bible says that nothing shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as I was with Moses so shall I be with thee I mean I as I was with job so shall I be with you but job had a part to play every seed must bring forth of its kind now it takes something to bring forth a seed what does it take we got grass growing out here they were just seed moisture is one light hate son Sun generates light and and light really generates heat and if you don't don't believe that just step in my our Greenhouse it was over a hundred in there yesterday trials create Heat and they really bring forth Who We Are [Music] now we're all in the midst of changing right from a corruptable seed to an incorruptible and so there's a constant manifestation First Corinthians 3 13 don't turn there just write it down every man's work shall be made manifest for the day shall declare it because it shall be revealed by fire yeah fire reveals Who We Are and the fire shall try every man's work of what sort it is right so God wants to prove us just like he wanted to prove to Satan who job was amen and it took the fire to do it because Satan said oh he's just serving you because of what he can get out of you of course anybody that you bless is going to just you know serve you better that ain't the truth right that is nothing but a lie amen Psalm 66 10 says for thou o God has proved us thou has tried us as silver is tried now when we're made out of the same substance that God is made out of then we'll be able to stand the test like job did that's why Jesus told the church age our church aged the church World in our age I counsel thee tobiome gold tried in the fire it's able to to go through a test and remain faithful to come to church it's able to go through when it don't have money it's able to still pay its ties because that is what deity is it stays true to the word amen the word is our foundation we don't learn this word so we can know the word and still do what we want to do That's what Satan is offering we need gold Tried by the fire God can take the Heat job could take the Heat job was a predestinancy to God and God be an omniscient new job would remain faithful to his sufferings now I want us to remember this God being omniscient new job would remain faithful through no but Satan didn't know that amen and even though God knows he still wants us to prove it this is an important subject because God knows everything knows it and from the beginning right he knew Abraham loved him he knew he'd be faithful but he still wanted Abraham to offer up Isaac to take that knife and to kill Isaac and when he stopped his hand he said now I know that thou lovest me you have to manifest you have to manifest you have to prove with your life how much you love God it is not good enough to say God knows my heart amen God himself wants you to prove it not me but but God does so we have to go through with it so Satan doubted God inside of job you can write this down God inside of job kept job inside of his trials because that's what it is right it is not the knowledge of God that helps you overcome trials it's not the learning that you can learn it's God in you the hope of glory amen job didn't know everything but he knew he belonged to God job understood that the creator of all life knows that he can try them that are his and he knows that they will still pass the test right because the receipt of God see you know what Satan is wanting to offer and brother bran talked about this is an intellectual salvation an intellectual relationship in intellectual I know I know the Bible and I just I believe the Bible but they're not willing to allow the trials that they go to to to Really Define where they're at with God to really prove in other words is God's God wants to prove us but we don't want to be proven we what we want to just sit with this magical belief of I believe the message no job understood that if he belong to God and God was in that he was going to be able to go through the trial because they're made out of the same substance job and you are made out of the same substance that God is but you have to believe that yes before we came to God we were outright sinners scared of everything ran after all will did what we want to do and I understand that that Cocker burn nature is still hanging on and we got to Die daily that that's the prescription that Jesus gave us but we must believe that we are of Christ to the point that we can go through the trials and remain faithful don't question God don't doubt God don't say something's out of order something must be no amen we've got to believe that if our children died and and our house blew up and and whatever happened that we would still remain in love with Jesus Christ don't always slay me yet but I trust him job 23 verse 10 says but he knoweth the way that I take see job understood this when he have tried me I will come forth as gold you have that attitude we need it my foot have held my steps and his way have I kept and not declined I love that there's no declining there's no sidestepping there's no taking a break we've got to remain faithful neither have I gone back from the Commandments of his lips I have esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food that doesn't say more than my Double Stuffed Orioles I'm talking about necessary food when you need it his word is more important job didn't understand everything that happened to him but he still trusted God in the middle of his trials to the highest degree to the highest degree of Temptation which is though he slain me yet why trust him will you allow God to slay you amen [Music] praise the Lord amen it just proves your love for him how deep it is the whole world Church World loves God to a point and brother Brian said you love God every day and still miss it but we're talking about a real love relationship to where he's the Potter you're the clay he can put you through anything and you remain faithful that's what it's all about the most important thing in life is our relationship with God yes amen and it's not that we have a relationship with God but what is the proper and pleasing relationship with him right because everybody says oh I got a relationship with God oh I gotta walk with God I got a relation but is it pleasing is it proper is it is it according to what how he wants it or is it according to your standard right our trials do two important things they prove not just to God who knows all things already but to the devil who doesn't know nothing it proves to the world and to us who we really are yeah oh this is an important aspect amen it proves where we're at number two God uses them to purify the worldly nature outside get it out of us he uses the trials to purify and get rid of the worldly nature Oh Brother John I got rid of mine a long time ago I'm a new creature where you just woke up on a new day right and you got to Die daily brother Brian said in the church age the laodicean church age he says the gold of God is a character like is a christ-like character produced in the furnace in the fiery furnace of affliction this is the right kind of gold so how in the world are we ever ever gonna get character number one if we stay away and don't want to deal with our trials number two when we had the trials we ain't even interested in what we need to do to get the character we just want to get out of the trial I mean to me character isn't naturally produced when you're going through trial that would be like a gift did we say give me trials give me trials I'm off character when I'm done I'm sorry don't work like that that's right that's right brother Brian says now what kind of character will you take with you when you go to heaven will it be like his whose character was molded by the suffering in the fiery furnace of Affliction or will it be the softness of the character list laodicean people brother Brian said that's the only thing we're taking with us right it's our character right right just it just depends on what kind of character you're going to have this is a real Secret of the importance of Trials of why we can rejoice when we're going through our trials trials open the door of opportunity for a character to be manifested James 1 just just you know these scriptures I just kind of want to go through them James 1 verse 2 my brother encountered all joy when you fall into diverse temptation knowing this that the trend of your faith worketh patience but let patients have a perfect work that ye may be perfect complete entire wanting nothing what happens when we're going through a trial I don't want this what is this going on this is your fault well there's a reason that we go through these things and if we could come in agreement here with James that God is looking for us to get to a point when we're in our trial to not want just to Comm commit yourself to God Amen commit the situation to God and and and what happens when you commit yourself to God character will be manifested in your life but if you choose to fight your way through your trial without a submission to the way God wants you to handle it you will not get character you will just get miserable the whole world is full of miserable people going through trials first Peter 4 12. beloved thinking not strange concerning the fiery trials which is to try you as though some strange thing happen unto you don't think it's strange God is in control amen amen but rejoice in as much as ye are partakers of Christ's suffering that when his glory shall be revealed ye may be glad also with exceeding Joy the joy of the Lord is our strength amen we don't want to be afraid of our trials we're not alone in our trials God is there but we need to meet God in the trial we need to let him have his way we need to be conscious of his will in the trial or else how are we going to choose it and I'll tell you A lot of times when we go into a trial we are just so messed up in our mind about this thing that's happening this shouldn't be happening why did this happen and we're so distracted where are we going to get the money from where are we gonna how I I I don't want to go back to the doctor I mean it's endless of the distractions that happen to us when we enter a trial that we are so unfocused on what God wants us to do we need to learn to stand still and know that he is still God in the middle of our trial that's what job did he didn't run over here run over there and get his friends and make this phone call and come on he had something on the inside of them that was greater than all his friends change let him prove his faithfulness to you amen yes how about a love relationship it doesn't matter your child doesn't matter what you're going through it doesn't even matter how it's affecting you but I want you to remember this I want you to turn with me to this one first John chapter 4 verse 4. we got to take our time on this one all right that's enough time you should have got there by now first John 4 4 ye are of God settle it settle it ye are of God now if you can settle this this the rest of this would be quite easy you have got little children and have overcome them well how'd I do it because greater is he that is in you amen then he that is in the world that's in you amen see there's the white dog and the black dog there's the battle and if you know you can walk into your trial I am with I am of God I'm a part of God what he spoke has got to come to pass it's not going to be I'm not going to be the only person that he spoke and it doesn't come to pass but somehow the devil just gets us to wander off look we got to stand there in the trial we got to stand there as a Believer and know that I am of God and the Overcomer lives inside of me [Music] oh I don't have to worry about doing it he's going to do it through me I'm just going to trust him I'm going to believe the battle is inside of us amen and we don't got time to read it but James 4 verses one through three it talks about it we must remember who we are and who we belong to yeah so how do we overcome by believing by believing first John chapter 5 verse 4 I want us to go here too first John chapter 5 verse 4. by believing God is greater on the inside of us than anything that we're facing I I just can't imagine anybody is going to say well you don't understand that's right you're going to tell me your trial is worse than job's right Joel why did Joe pass the test feared God he skewed evil he walked uprightly he had a real love relationship it was a real thing right he manifested this thing called predestination he manifested this foreknowledge he manifested in his time the word that God spoke before the foundation of the world it is no different for you and me don't say you don't understand don't think nobody understands thank God is with me God in Me is greater than this situation that's going on trials are essential part of our growth do you believe that all right for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world have you been born again [Music] you've got the scripture right there yes you have no excuse of not overcoming right there and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so you're going to go into your trial and you're you're not going to believe well number one you've got to get along with God and get that thing cleared up because the only way you're going to get Victory with God is through faith so many examples of that in the Bible trials are the last thing we want to go through they're the last things we want to face they're when we're in them we want to get out of them but they are an essential part of our growth it's like if a person never goes through a trial they don't grow amen I know this is hard to understand because we feel we can grow by listening to tapes by reading the Bible by memorizing scriptures you may grow into the knowledge intellectual knowledge of God but you literally if you choose what the prophet the words of the Prophet you are further away from knowing god than when you first started that's what he said so we can't know God in that way but yet the prophet told us we need to read we need to pray we need to listen to taste rapturing faith and The Taste we need that but it's not for this it's not for this organ right I don't know if this is an organ but it is for this organ that's why we should always pray Lord help me to see amen open my eyes when we go to read it amen amen a bunch of head knowledge will never prove anything right how many times have you known the right thing to do but you still didn't manifest it that's what head knowledge does there's no life in it you you need you need to prove you need to take that knife you just ah you need to prove how much you love God amen wait for God just hold back that knife and say now I know you love me first [Music] right because we all face the same thing all of us I don't care what color our skin is I don't care what gender we have as long as it's male or female and I don't care what country we're from I don't care what we're going through right we all need to put God first we got to have a love affair where he's number one now in your life God will prove you and you will prove God both of these things happen in the life of a Christian and this proving is all about what kind of relationship that we really have with God let me give you a couple examples here first is Malachi 310 and and you want to put that up there you can but you all know the scripture uh bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my table and look and prove all right prove me prove me now prove me now right now herewith saith the Lord of hosts if I will not open you the windows of heaven and pour you out a blessing that you shall not be uh not be room enough to receive it [Music] now those that are faithful have proved God to be faithful with that those who have skirted and not been completely faithful and did a little bit here and highly forget about this and God understands and you got your own quirks as of why you haven't been faithful I don't see God prospering it I'm just being honest with you another scripture now I'm not talking about ties so you can lighten up but I am talking about proving God and God proving you so we know the scripture brother Mark quotes it all the time seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and and all and all other things shall be added on to you so we're going to like prove God we gotta if we if we seek God with all of our hearts we seek the kingdom of God we put it first amen then God takes care of our life now those that only do it 90 of the way don't get everything added because God's still not first and it's all about relationship amen it's not about majority or or on a curve it's all about you proving God and God proving you now God proved the children of Israel Deuteronomy 8 2 this will be up on the board Deuteronomy 8 2 and thou shall remember all the ways which the Lord thy God LED thee these 40 years in the wilderness well why do you do that the Bible says to Humble thee in other words you weren't humble and it took it took a long time to Humble you and what and to prove thee to know what was in thine heart well I thought he's God and he knows everything he wants it manifested amen it's manifesting time Brother Bruce to send that song a number of times it's manifesting time everything's being manifested how was the Liz off hell and the devil's being manifested to know what was in the heart which is important because we don't really know what's in our heart the majority of the time it's very deceptive whether thou what is keep his Commandments or no this is about relationship amen this proving is everything about relationship and he humbled thee and he suffereth thee to hunger and fed thee with manna which thou newest not neither did thy fathers know that he might make thee to know that that man doth not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of the Lord does Man live [Music] you know most of us are satisfied we're doing you know a lot and God's over here in the relationship he says I want to be first in everything the children of Israel what in a lot of the word they did but they did not walk in all the words they were they walked in a lot of the word that's why he he said these are my children I've come down to deliver them my children he called them but with many of them he wasn't pleased in afterwards he destroyed them so the key is we've got to follow all the word and he's going to prove us amen you know you know we got to get rid of this mindset well for the most part you know everybody likes me for the most part I'm doing this for the most part everything's okay with me and God God is interested in the parts that's not happening that's where God is at and then he uses trials to work on those things that's what he's using trials for and we've got to meet God there in the trial we've got to come to grips with what he wants us to do now we've all read this and I think brother Mark had maybe read this in Hebrews 3 don't turn there I'm just going to read it real quick he said wherefore as the Holy Ghost say it today if you would hear his voice and heart not your heart is in the provocation the day of Temptation the Wilderness when your father's tempted me and what they proved me and saw my Works 40 years in other words God was faithful to them God God was faithful to them when they were not faithful to God yes that's how good God is and today every time we hear the word we have a choice to harden a heart or to unharden it to say God I want to obey what you've been speaking to me amen you know we all we would love to be in a church we're constantly who's ever at the pulpit is calling out something personal in everybody's life God told me this about you and God showed me that and this is what you need to do That's so exciting but what about the still small voice what about the way that he chose it to be I'm not against those other things I'm really not but relationship with God is much greater than that God proved the three Hebrews brother brother Bruce made mention of this God met them in the furnace he met them in the middle of the trial he wasn't on the outside when they were pushing him in he didn't say come on you guys we can do this together I'll be with you don't worry they didn't know what was going to happen they knew they had crossed the line that they were not going to bow they weren't going to say I'm not going to do part of I'm not going to have put something else before God and they walked in there by faith but because they were a part of God you can't burn God Amen they tried to burn John in boiling oil and they couldn't do that right if we're a part of God don't worry about the trial okay God will beat you there Isaiah 48 verse 10 says behold I have refined thee but not with silver he said I have chosen thee in the furnace of affliction remember I have you have not chosen me but I've chosen you from the foundation of the world but he chose you in the furnace of affliction here's the Beautiful You know I'm not trying to get us all psyched up about hey just blindly going trials and say well this is you know must happen I gotta just no I want you to walk in there with confidence that God is there you don't have to wonder now just literally Rejoice because the door of opportunity for character to be molded is about to happen it's about to happen by the choice I make when I'm facing this difficulty am I going to put God second because of this this this this and this or am I going to remain faithful because that's exactly what job did he remained faithful look God proved Daniel in the Lion's Den and Daniel proved God they prove one another sure we're going to face um have you ever been faced persecution by your family for doing something right so here here Daniel praying and he was going to face a persecution he knew that but he kept moving forward because it was the will of God and that's what you got to remember when it's the will of God you keep moving forward and so here Daniel goes into the lion's den and now this is where Daniel is going to see if God is faithful of course he knew he was going to be but it wasn't just intellectual knowledge the proof is in the pudding he went down there and that's where God was taking care of those lions making him such an enjoyable pillow for the night so God proved uh Daniel that he was going to remain faithful and open those doors and keep praying no matter what the persecution was and then there in the middle of the trial Daniel proved that God was faithful by remaining do you love the word amen Zechariah 13 9. I will bring the third part through the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and will try them as gold as tried they shall call on my name and I will hear them I will say it is my people and they shall see the Lord is my God so what are we going to do in the middle of the trial call on the Lord there was a time that they had a trap set for brother Branham I believe it was a Ministerial Association and it's one of the states here and um God had showed them that there was going to be a trap and brother branham's initial reaction is this okay well I won't go then thanks for warning me I won't go right and God said no you're going you're going you're going to go and you're going to face this trial you're going to get there you're he says I'll be with you and when you know God is with you you can have boldness yeah yeah not arrogancy right not haughtiness [Music] but just boldness and you know they even testified you know you may disagree with his Doctrine but I'll tell you what he's Fearless in what he believes and that's how we got to be when we're in a trial I believe that God is going to help me he's with me right now amen crazy First Peter chapter 1 verse 6 boy we have to we have to hurry wherein ye greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be if need be air in heaviness through manifold Temptations so who determines if you need to be in a trial so I want you to stop saying well this wouldn't have happened if you wouldn't have you're not allowed to say that anymore that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perish it though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and glory amen where at the peering of Christ of Jesus Christ why then because that's that's what you're taking with you when you leave is your character it's the only thing you're taking with you when you leave is your character whom having not seen look it's all about love relationship these this this is all about love relationship who whom having not seen you love in whom now you see him not yet believing that's how you overcame he Rejoice with joy unspeakable and full of Glory receiving the end of your faith even the salvation of your souls I'll say don't you take your foot off the pedal until you're in the rapture don't do what this the snake of laodicea is trying to get everybody in the message to do is just lay back don't you take your foot off the gas remember God's thoughts of you are eternal our thoughts in our trials are like up and down they're all over the place we must settle down in the middle of our trial and line up with God's original thoughts which we know that he wouldn't put us in the spot if it wasn't for our good I'm glad that God is interested in building my character because I'll be honest with you there's times that I don't even think about it I am so interested in doing what I want to do that I am not even thinking about it it's not about doing some do's and don'ts you got here's the three things I want you to do today this is my world do these three things and the rest of the day is yours it's not like that brother Branham uh I gotta I gotta I'm gonna read you a quote here in a second that this is important we know what God speaks must come to pass and what God has spoken of us is going to come to pass there's no doubt about it but where most Believers miss it is that they don't have to do anything you know you just sit there and God does it all things don't happen without you making the right decision let me just say this things do we know that there is a part that God plays but we don't sit back as if character is a gift and we don't have to do anything right character is not a gift it's a victory which means you must make a choice to overcome in your trial to get character and so this is what I'm saying you have a part to play and most people don't think about this they just they oh yeah God's gonna do it God's gonna do it God's gonna do it and they want to leave the trial there's no proving we ought to be interested and really I want character to be manifested in me let me read this quote to you brother Brian said in the samura church age he said unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to Reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't Reign because power apart from character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and has set down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him but be of good cheer I have overcome and the little temporal temporary suffering we go through now is not worthy to be compared with the tremendous Glory that shall be revealed in us when he comes oh what a treasure are laid up for those who are willing to enter in his kingdom through much tribulation it's basically a different attitude I I are you with me stay excited about the word don't oh my my I I don't like doing this I don't like having to throw away half of my message every time I come up here you have a part to play this is important when God created everything that didn't have a free more agency it automatically obeyed them but when he created beans with a Freemore agency they didn't always obey him right so remember when Jesus he descended from the mount and the starchy Pharisees who didn't like praise you know made him feel uncomfortable basically they weren't getting praised and I mean they probably like praise when they were getting praised but they didn't like humbling themselves to praise God and so they came to Jesus said will you tell them to hold their peace tell them to be quiet he said well if they hold their peace if they who have a free more agency hold their peace then these rocks who don't have a free more agency they're going to cry out praise me because it has been spoken that there should be praise given at this time so God's word demands praise God made us with a free more agency we must agree with his thoughts so the scripture says for I know the thoughts I think towards you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you in an expected end we must line up with his thoughts to get the expected end this is no blindness God did not make us a mountain a tree a planet a dog a hippo he made us a human being with a free more agency so our will must be submitted to his will we must align our thoughts with his thoughts we must align our will with his will in order for there to be an expected end for us and that's just all there is to it if we're predestinated it will happen now I'm not talking about failures I'm not talking about mistakes I'm talking about outright disobedience no one is without mistakes we need submission to the whole word we can't leave part of it out we need to be zealous and and repent and we need to submit our life to God we can't stare at I've got this perfect relationship for a Rapture because I got this Badge of attendance we got to get back in line how Jesus said it with every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God we just must we got to get rid of our double-mindedness amen get rid of our lusting for our will or judging others or our pride or arrogancy we need to let the mind that was in Christ Jesus be in US as he submitted himself to the father we must submit ourselves to the word of God and then we can have the correct expectation that we'll have an expected him second Timothy chapter two don't turn there we don't have time second Timothy 2 21 says if a man therefore Purge himself from these things he shall be a vessel so there is a part that you play it must go through three more agency all right Isaiah 50 55 verse 6 and I'm just going to try to hurry is just as best as I can and I know because you love me you'll be patient with me and if you if you're not patient with me then you know there's something that you need to pray about because you're going through a trial Isaiah 55 verse 6. seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon and while he's near let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man what his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon them and to our God for he will abundantly you know God is just so good he's just looking for us to let him be first he said for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my ways uh neither are your ways my ways saith the Lord for as the heaven is higher than the earth Soul or my my way is higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh down and the snow from Heaven return if not then there but watereth the Earth and maketh it bring forth and Bud look at that grass seed when you leave may you remember this service that it may give seed to the sower and bread to the eater so shall my word be that go forth out of my mouth it shall not return to me Glory but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper anything we're into I sent it so you don't have to be afraid of the trials right amen you have to be scared you can know that God is with you now it may take a couple it may take a while to go through trials before you get purified it took seven Church ages to get a bride ready without spot a wrinkle it took the dipping in muddy Jordan seven times for Naaman to be purified [Music] Psalms chapter 12 verse 6 this is the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of Earth purified seven times so if you're going through something for a while I mean job went through a trial that I from what I understand from what I read it was it was with about a year within a year that's a long time to go without knowing your remedy without without without really having God come and just make it real clear he's walking by faith amen we need to accept God's plan for our life and our trials don't fight God don't fight his will don't tell God he's wrong amen just because this is happening he knows what he's doing first John chapter 3 verse 1 says behold what manner of love here it is love relationship what manner of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth that's not because it knew him not but we know him beloved now are we remember we read that scripture now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and so every man that has this hope in him purifies himself even as he is pure in other words he allows himself to go through the trials for the purpose of becoming more like Christ amen and it's a love that he's bestowed upon us what matter of love the father's bestowed you know many people go through trials and they don't see God in fact they Curse God how many people do we know actually get mad at God because something happened in their life oh my Psalms 26 1 Judge Me O Lord for I have walked in my Integrity I have trusted also in the Lord therefore I shall not slide examine Me O Lord and prove me and try my Reigns and my heart now this was a Psalm of David his heart wanted to be examined with sincerity amen all right I just want to read you one more scripture it's in Philippians chapter 2 turn with me if you would there it's okay for God to try us amen we could did I say one more scripture yes praise the lord we got an amen there well if I only got one more scripture you read that when you get home because if I only got one I'm only going to do one I'm gonna do Hebrews chapter 13 verse 5. remember no man can pluck you out of the father's hand so no matter what you're going through no God will not put anything on you that you can't bear he will make a way of Escape so when you're going through trials I want you to remember to meet God inside your trials that's what this service was about Hebrews 13 Verse 5 says let your conversation be without wantonness without wanting and be content with such things as you have for he have said I will never leave you nor forsake thee so that we may boldly say the Lord is my helper and I will not fear what man shall do unto me amen let's Stand Together remember the Lord is your helper he's there to help you in your trial amen not my will but thy will be done he which begun a good work he's going to finish it amen so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad and yours [Music] thank you for your patience so glad you're [Music] so glad I'm yours so glad you're Mercy has followed me so glad you found me and set me free so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad I'm yours so glad I'm Yours Lord so glad on yours so glad your mercy has followed me so glad you found me and said be free so glad I was so glad I'm Yours amen amen as we go before the Lord if there's someone here that just desires prayer something in the words been spoken something on your heart that you just you want to be faithful to meet the Lord in your in your trials and you want to be remembered in prayer just lift your hand up before him as we go to him in prayer Heavenly Father Lord you see the hands that have been lifted Lord Lord I haven't seen him but I know that you have lower my hands up too [Music] oh I want to be able to look at my brother job my my brother Abraham foreign [Music] be able to manifest a trust and a faith that I seen in my brothers I believe you your your servant Paul told Timothy to be an example to the others father I pray you'd remind us all Lord to be an example one to another to remain Faithfully believing that you're greater inside of us than whatever we're facing that you have equipped us what we need to make it through bring this word back to our remembrance Lord when we're going through something that we don't want to be going through and father we thank you with all of our heart for every test and every trial that you brought in her life because we know it hasn't been to be any harm to us it's only been to build the character that we need to make it out of here father we want to thank you with all of our hearts I pray now that you just bless each and every one Lord with a a great a greater portion of of you Lord I want more of your Holy Spirit Lord [Music] I'm not worthy Lord I'm not a man like job who walked upright it was perfect thank God I want to be found faithful like him just fill me with what I need that I'll be more faithful Lord Jesus bless your children be with those that are not here today Lord those that are live streaming Lord let them put their trust in you that you'll lead them through father we thank you for these things now we ask it all in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ and we give you Total Praise total honor and total glory for these things amen amen amen [Music] [Music] thank you I can't cast all my care 's upon you I lay all my burdens down at your feet anytime I don't know just what to do I will cast all my cares of
