look around the night and see more than two or three here we see a house full of believers tonight and so we are very much aware that he's here amen his presence is with us tonight and we want to say god bless you all we greet you in the name of the lord and sure counted an honor and privilege to be here with you all it's our first time to minister here in brother john's church we sure counted an

bible believers is his nephew his dad is my pastor brother sean martin there in blacksburg virginia so there's martin's all over the place amen but we sure appreciate him for coming up with us this weekend and just before we read the word let's just buy our hearts together and let's just invite him into the meeting tonight we have sung the songs of zion we believe the atmosphere has been created now let's just invite him to come and take preeminence heavenly father lord as we gather here tonight we have not gathered to be seen or to be heard lord we've not gathered here for just another service or just another gathering lord we've gathered here tonight that our lives might be changed by your presence for lord your prophet would tell us in a message in his presence he would say that no man can come in the presence of god but what is affected and lord we know that we'll either leave your presence better or worse and tonight god we're believing we're going to leave better father we're believing that lives are going to be touched by your presence and lord i'm asking you to come tonight father as we have stepped in this building lord and felt the warmth of your presence and the welcoming spirit lord father knowing here tonight there's no doubt many needs maybe sicknesses lord maybe discouragement i don't know all the needs but i do know you tonight father and i know that you're the all-knowing god and lord i believe if i'll humble and surrender myself to you that you'll lead us in the channels and avenues it would be beneficiary to your children tonight and lord i pray you would send a revival in every heart lord may you speak to us tonight god lord as i've just sit there in the back room and lord heard it over and over and over to receive more than an intellectual understanding but a revelation lord spoken from the lives of these believers here father that's the believers that i'm identified with and those that believe in the supernatural presence of the living god so tonight god come move among us in a special way bless this assembly father bless brother john bless his family lord his ministry lord may you just give him many souls for their labor and lord may you bless them abundantly father brother be o lord and his assembly their father may you bless him god and his uh his family lord bless them with souls father lord we're just giving you all the praise all the honor and all the glory for it's in the wonderful name of our lord and savior jesus christ we pray and all the believers says amen and amen god bless you this scene and if you have your bibles we'll turn to the book of galatians the sixth chapter the book of galatians the sixth chapter i want to look in the tenth verse and then also we'll turn to the book of ephesians the second chapter galatians 2 or rather galatians 6 and we want to look in the 10th verse amen you love the lord this evening amen god bless you brother dan good to see you amen amen galatians 6 and verse number 10. here paul writing says as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith amen let us do good unto all men especially unto them who are of the household of faith if we could look in the book of ephesians the second chapter ephesians the second chapter and in the 19th verse paul here writing to the church at ephesus in the 19th verse he says now therefore ye are no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god so galatians 6 he says of the household of faith here he identifies us as of the household of god and are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto a holy temple in the lord now in whom ye also are build it together notice what you build it together for and habitation of god through the spirit amen we ask the lord this evening as you have the blessing to the reading of his word as you can be seated here this afternoon from those scriptures for just a few moments i want to by the help of the lord to speak tonight if i entitle this thought i want to speak to you on the household of faith amen the household of faith i wonder tonight how many uh recognizes that we are of the household of faith i find it amazing that we're living in the day and time when you'll uh just have to realize that there is an attack against the church of the living god the devil's doing everything he can attacking on every hand that he can against the church of the living god and we know what his attack is on his attack is not on our buildings it's not on our groups or anything his attack is on our faith the devil is doing everything he can to attack our faith now i find it amazing that satan has desires as well as god has desires and you will realize that one thing satan desires for the church is he desires the church to forget amen and to fear think about that the devil desires the church to forget and to fear amen but god desires the church to remember and believe the devil desires the church to forget and fear but god is desiring the church to remember and believe now i find it a powerful quote brother brahman says in letting off the pressure he said oh how satan would desire to take us quickly from the scene right in the midst of the battle so the devil amen is not desiring to take you out before the battle so much or even after the battle amen but if he can get you called in the middle of the battle and begin to forget who you are forget begin to forget what you believe then the devil can take you out now if you study much you'll realize that science actually has proven that there is a connection between fear and memory loss there's a connection between him when someone becomes stressful or anxiety amen fear or depression can cause forgetfulness think about that stress anxiety depression nervousness can cause forgetfulness it can cause confusion and difficulty concentrating on other problems that disrupt daily activities if the devil can get you to forget then you'll become amen confused if he can get you to forget then you'll have a difficulty on concentrating on the things that you should be looking at i know it's a it's a very a well-known point around the message that the prophet would tell us amen that we are living in a neurotic age we're living in an age of neurotic amen where people don't know what to do because they don't know where they're going amen they don't know what to do because they don't know where they're going if they knew where they were going then they would know what to do he said the doctors don't have an answer for it they mean the psychiatrist is being doctored by the psychiatrist and they don't have an answer now you may wonder why would satan want the children of god amen to forget and fear well the prophet says it like this who has the most power before god he said what is an angel an angel is a servant amen there is servants but what are you you are his sons and daughters see amen who has the most power in heaven then he meant a sinner that's been saved by grace or an archangel that is standing by his right side he said the sinner that's been saved by grace has more authority in heaven than the archangel that is standing by his side without sin amen because he is a son and who has more authority a servant or a son amen seek oh we forget amen what we are listen this we forget what we are we forget many times what made us what we are and after we become what we are then we forget where we got there amen think about that we forget what we are we forget many times what made us what we are and after we become what we are then we forget how we got here amen but i want tonight by the help of the lord to remind you amen that we are not sinners we are christians amen we are not fearful people we are believers tonight we we have not come here to come under the oppression of satan we have not come here to come under the ideas of satan that will cause us to forget who we are amen but we are here to remember who we are there's a reason why amen that satan wants us to forget amen and fear because the prophet said faith is he meant a law of god the devil wants the church to forget their faith i want you to remember that the devil wants the church to forget their faith and the reason he wants the church to forget their faith is because all the power of god that we're talking about is accessible to us by faith all the power of god is accessible to the church by the faith of god amen then the key is faith to the power of god so what does the devil want us to do he wants us to forget amen how to access the power of god all things are possible say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart and believe what you said should come to pass and you can have it it is accessible to you amen if you've got the law the law is the faith that controls all things amen then satan's greatest fear here tonight is that the church of the living god would access the faith of god amen and that would produce another book of acts church because christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of acts amen but the book of revelation shows can i lay a foundation if that's okay how the antichrist would come in the church it would defile it making it lukewarm and formal and powerless it exposes satan revealing his works the attempted destruction of god's people the discrediting of god's word right down to the time that he is cast into the lake of fire he fights that he cannot stand it because he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for amen then she can do the greater work she will be an invincible army amen i want you to catch what he said if she gets the revelation of who she is and notice what he said what she stands for he didn't just point out what she stands against and i know we stand against many things amen but i want to remind you tonight we don't just stand against things amen we stand for things we stand and can't see him we stand against ungodliness we stand against perversion we stand against the things of the world amen but at the same time we're standing against things amen we're standing for things amen we stand for jesus christ we stand for the holy ghost we stand for the power of god we stand for the supernatural we stand for miracles we stand for signs we stand for wonders listen friends we're not just a bunch of people it's making us stand against something we are the sons and daughters of god that has been called in this last stage amen the world has bowed on their knee to every demon out of hell every spirit of perversion every spirit of confusion denomination bowed their knee to every antichrist spirit but there is a bride in the last day who will not bow her knee to one devil but she will take a stand upon the same rock amen that moses stood upon she'll stand up on that rock and what is that rock it's the rock of revelation and if you take a stand upon the rock of revelation amen the gates of hell will come against the church but they will not prevail over the church because greater is he that is in you i feel like preaching greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world amen by a revelation my we don't just stand against things we stand for things and by what we stand for we receive a true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the christian church and by god's spirit amen we discern and withstand the antichrist spear and satan will be powerless before her if you remember who you are amen by the revelation of the word satan will be powerless before the church he will be as definitely thwarted today amen as he was when christ was stood his every effort amen to gain power over him in the desert satan hates revelation but we love it amen satan hates revelation but we love it see so satan remembers amen what happens when the church accesses the power of god do you realize it's off of the bible but can i give you one example tonight it's in the book of luke the 10th chapter amen the 17th verse the 70 returned again with joy saying lord even the devils are subject unto us through thy name and he said unto them i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven and then he turns brother john and says behold i give you power amen to tread upon serpents and upon scorpions and over all the power of the enemy and nothing shall by any means hurt you he said see this was immediately after jesus had given his disciples power against unclean spirits and they went out casting out devils and they sent him two by two he said don't go to the gentiles but go rather to the lost sheep of israel and as you go preach the kingdom of heaven amen heal the sick cast out the devils well then they come back rejoice and come back happily rejoicing amen and he says rejoice not amen the devil is subject unto you amen but rejoice because your name is written in heaven can you imagine them disciples coming back to jesus man they're on fire they just cast out devils they just laid hands on sick folks and then they've seen demons leave people amen they seen a mighty move of god and god said don't rejoice amen because you've seen the devil subject unto you amen but rejoice because your name amen is written in heaven amen and god would send a prophet in the last days amen to tell us how our name is recorded in heaven he would say in the blood of jesus christ he recorded your name in the lamb's book of life well what can wash away my sin amen nothing but the blood of jesus do you realize the same blood amen that can wash away your sin is the same blood that shields your name in the lamb's book of life from before the foundation of the world and there ain't enough devils past present or future amen to cause the church to forgive we've got more than representation on earth we've got representation in heaven we've got representation in the mind of god before you was a sinner you was a son of god before you was a town or you was a synagogue because there was a gene seed in you by the predestination of almighty god don't rejoice because devils are subject amen rejoice because your name is written in the lamb's book of life amen it amazes me brother that jesus would turn and say i beheld satan as lightning fall from heaven he said see the power of that church moving forward had just upset the whole kingdom of hell the power of god in the church upset the whole kingdom of hell he said see he saw him drop from his place because god had given them power amen to his church to go on amen can you imagine before the disciples got back to jesus and said lord we got all the devils cast out he said you're not telling me nothing i don't know amen i saw him fall as you was casting them out amen before you come and told me what you've done amen i saw it as the all-knowing god i saw what was happening amen but listen he was cast from out of the holy place he said by what by the power of the church amen by the power of the church of them having power amen he was cast out he said and they really upset the kingdom of satan he says what could we do with it today oh my amen amen i'll just be honest with you can i just preach for a minute amen i'm a little bit sick and tired of being told what we cannot do i'm ready somebody tell us what we can do amen we've been told we can't pray and we can't believe and we can't sound and we can't rejoice and we can't cast out devils amen but somebody stand up on the promise of god's word and remember god has called us ain't meant to be more than just church members he's called us to be more than just you sinners he said you are a city amen that is set on a hillside amen that lighteth up the world come on church we not come here to pack up in the corner and bury this message under some tradition we are here to let a lost and dying world know that the same power that was in the bible has returned to the church by the baptism of the holy ghost this ain't a powerless church this ain't a confused church this is the church of the living god and the same power that was in jesus amen is in the church tonight all that god was he poured into christ and all that christ was he poured into the church he has no hands but your hands he has no feet but your feet he has no arms but your arms but he has supplied the power to bring the promise to pass in the age you're living in oh if they could tear satan's kingdom up with the power of god in their day what don't we be able to do with the power of god today and then i'll say it to you like this young people satan is not so much afraid of just the preachers getting a hold of the power of god amen he don't just fear your pastor or brother bill or brother dan or any other minister amen getting hold of the power of god he does not want the laity ain't meant to get a hold of that same power he does not want the weakest christian in the church ain't meant to get a hold of that power amen because i'll show you what happened when they got a hold of it are you ready amen in the book of luke the 24th chapter jesus said tarry in the city of jerusalem until you be endued with power from old high in the book of acts the first chapter he said ye shall receive power in the book of acts the second chapter amen you know what happened the power came in acts the third chapter amen there were two ignorant and unlearned preachers amen that received the power that was prophesied by jesus they received it amen and they said amen unto a man who was sitting by the gate amen two preachers have just received amen the fulfillment of the promise of the father amen they've just received the power and here sets a man by the gate in a terrible condition i've always said it like this it was an ugly problem at a beautiful place he was sitting by the gate called beautiful he'd been crippled for many years it was an ugly problem was there any power to change the situation amen well then two preachers had received the power to change the situation and they walked by him and he was asking arms and they didn't have no arms to give him but they did say such as i have give i thee amen in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk and he took him by his right hand and he lifted him up and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength and he leaping up stood and walked and entered with him in the temple amen walking and leaping and praising god and all the people saw they met him walking and praising god and they knew that it was he which sat at the gate he meant of the temple and they were filled with wonder and amazement at which it happened unto him the prophet said see what happened was right off they went amen just as hard as they could go preaching the gospel amen my the devil said well now they're just out there preaching so it won't be no it won't it won't hurt nothing amen let peter and john go preach all over the place it won't hurt nothing amen all the people preaching everything but they pastor the gate called beautiful amen and the holy ghost said peter i perceive that man has faith to be healed he said you know what amen when that man jumped up and began to praise god amen that caused more trouble than all the preaching they ever did amen batman getting up out of that condition amen caused hell more trouble than ever sermon peter ever preached you know why because the word has now moved amen from being word to be an action it is now moved from just being the ideas of some man amen to be in a reality oh i would tonight that that same power that failed by the gate caught beautiful would fall in this church tonight and no matter what condition you're sitting in no matter what spirit you're under no matter what demon has pledged your life for sicknesses claims your body there is a word here there is a power to change the situation in the face of every devil oh come on friends this power is not dead this power is here in the building tonight amen you know what that caused more trouble oh brother you just let something on the phenomenal side start and watch every rogue in hell amen go to hollering and craving his blood i'll tell you this he said peter preached a sermon on the day of pentecost three thousand souls were saved and the devil never moved out of his bed think about that peter preached a sermon on the day of pentecost 3 000 this is brother man's words amen and the devil never moved out of his bed oh well let them alone see but he passed the gate called beautiful he said see amen i might fill them around with a little theology amen once in a while but i sure can't fool the real thing oh my amen i can fool him around with a little theology but i really can't fool the real thing so in other words he could change their ideas of what they was hearing as long as it was coming forth in word form but when they saw what he was preaching about coming to action it had now moved from a sermon to a reality and he said i cannot fool you know why i couldn't fool the real thing amen because it was a witness now it was more than a head knowledge it was more than an education it was more than a religious understanding it had now come down in the form of power amen and demonstration oh glory to god it's the truth anyhow come on friends we've not received a dead letter we've received the power to make the world live in the age we're living in oh i'll tell you this much he said i'll just stop this before it gets another group on the scene he never stopped at the end and he cannot stop it now he never stopped to thin and he cannot stop it now that's right amen god's gospel will move on and on and on and when there's no more heaven and there's no more earth that word will still remain the same amen all things that jesus was he is now how many believes that all things jesus was he is now and always will be what he was then he is now and he always will be he's the same yesterday today and forever and the same holy ghost that fell on the day of pentecost is the same holy ghost that is falling today oh i'll admit it's been tramped on it's been made fun of it's been misrepresented it's been misinterpreted amen that's only the devil counterfeiting because there's a real genuine baptism of the holy spirit that brings the same results today that it did on the day of pentecost then we don't need to tweak the holy ghost to fit the situation we need to let the holy ghost have the right of way in the church i'll tell you what i believe i still believe the holy ghost can fix a marriage i still believe the holy ghost can fix a family i still believe the holy ghost can fix a church i still believe the holy ghost can set a young person free i still believe in the power of the holy ghost because what he was he is and what he is he always will be and there's not enough devils in hell ain't meant to stop him from being who he is well we might as well go ahead and meet on good terms this is who i am i believe in the holy ghost i believe in the message of the hour i believe in the preeminence of jesus christ i believe supreme deity has returned to the church to lead us out of the confusion of laodicea into the rapture of jesus christ that'll change her bodies what he was then he still is now if he ever saved before he can still save now if he ever healed before he can still heal now well brother john can i preach amen i'll just be honest with you amen i'm a little bit sick here and saying well people's in too bad of condition to be saved amen what if that has said that about you when you needed to be saved well come on now amen god they told me you got a burden on his heart to go in some souls amen went and talked to some people and they gave about four excuses on why it couldn't be done the area was too bad and this was too rough and it's not going to work i tell you what amen that's a devil from the pits of hell amen that don't want to see a move of god break out but i don't know about you amen but i believe sin the light church welcomes the move of god i believe we welcome the power of god and then to move in our services to move in our families you want to see the devil get mad get people saved and full of the holy ghost and walking in the newness of life and it'll cause every devil and hell to turn over but the same devil that tried to stop at the end won't stop it now it's the irresistible force of the church of the living god remember this friends the power of pentecost is not dead it's still in our churches you know why people don't want it because people's made a mockery of it well they might as well preach they made a mockery of the move of god they made a mockery of the power of god but i say this wherever andrew glover is i welcome the spirit of god i welcome the power of salvation i welcome the god of redemption i welcome the god of abraham isaac and jacob to come in the church i give him the right of way i give him my voice i give him my mind i give him everything i have he meant to find a channel to access his children through by his word oh the devil can't stop within and the devil won't stop it now so what we need to do is we need to sharpen our spiritual memories amen and remember and believe and quit doing what the devil wants us to do and forgetting fear peter would say it this way i now write unto you in both which i stir up your pure minds by the way it remembers is this okay that you may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets and of the commandments of the apostles of the lord and savior how many will agree we all need reminders from time to time we brother brother damn we live in an age where we got reminders and we still forget come on hey man you need to go to the store and get something and you make a reminder on your phone you make a reminder on your watch you now make a reminder on all kinds of things and you go to the store and get everything and forget what you went to get see it's an age we need reminders i'll say it like this especially in this present hour we're living in when it's one plague when it's one war when it's one pressure after another we need to be reminded who we are we need to be reminded what we are and we need to be reminded where we're going if we forget who we are we forget what we are and we forget where we're going we open ourself up to whatever spirit wants to lead us away from where god is trying to take us amen that's the church of the living god we ought to close the door to every unbelieving spirit that tries to confuse us on who we are we are holy ghost field pillar fire following message believers that are being laid by god it's not come from denomination it's not come from a system it's come from the word to remind us who we are to remind us what we are and to remind us where we're going well we might as well tell the devil we're not going with you and we're not going to hell and we're not going to tribulation amen we're going to glory we're going in the rapture our bodies are going to be changed our sails are going to be rearranged this word has reminded us who we are what we are and where we're going glory to god and then you say well you're a little happy i am happy i am happy to know what i believe it's the truth of god it's the power of god unto salvation it is a refreshing from the presence of the lord to refresh our spiritual memories amen to call to mind amen i tell you the bible gives us beautiful places where we need to call to mind certain things deuteronomy 32 7 says we need to call to mind the past mercies of god we need to remember the days of old and consider the years of many generate generations ask the father and he will show thee and the elders and they will tell thee i tell you what we need we need fathers and elders that will tell their children amen that the god that was with him is the god that is with you he's not a god of history he's an ever ever-present reality amen we need to call to mind amen the wonderful works of god how that david would say i will remember the works of the lord surely i will remember the wonders of old i will meditate also of thy work and i will talk without doing if we're going to meditate upon anything if we're going to talk about anything let's talk about something that's got some value to it call the mind amen call to mind that the lord is a deliverer amen how many will remember god as a deliverer tonight amen jonah would say it like this when my soul fainted within me i remembered the lord amen and my prayer came unto thee in that holy temple amen we need to call to mind the words of christ amen call the mind the death of christ when he would say the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying amen this cup is the new testament in my blood amen this to you also and drink and remember to me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the lord's death till he comes see we should never forget the death of christ we should never forget what that death produced it's in two powerful tapes called remembering the lord amen we'll hear him say it like this remember jesus when you're sick remember jesus when you're discouraged remember jesus when you don't know how you're going to make it remember jesus glory to god oh hallelujah remember jesus church i don't know what you're going through i didn't have time to go through and take account and see what you're going through and what you're going through and what you're facing but i did come to tell you one thing remember jesus whatever you're going through remember jesus whatever you're facing remember jesus no matter how low you are remember jesus no matter how broke you are remember jesus no matter how sick you are remember jesus if we can forget the past and remember the future we can rise in the power of god oh hallelujah amen that's coming to me so i'm just going to preach if that's okay whatever said the other day i was on an elevator down here in louisville at the habern building he said we got on that elevator he said we went on there and he said there was three other guys and one of them was drunk he said he didn't know i was a preacher he said we got on the elevator and the old drunk guy looked over and said well we're going up to the eighth floor i thought that's kind of strange but then out of all the floors he picked he said the eighth floor he said we're going the eighth floor he said okay he said well this is as high as we're ever going to go he said yes this is as close to heaven as we're ever going to get brother said he looked at me and said that not knowing i was a preacher he said problem was i couldn't hold my peace i said yes sir that's as high as you'll go if you're trusting your own marriage he said but if you'll remember jesus you'll go higher if you'll remember jesus you'll go higher you know why you can't go no higher because you remember the past and you've forgotten the future you remember the divisions you remember the sicknesses but what about tonight amen we forget the past and we remember the future and we remember jesus is still god and his word is still true and his power is still here anybody ready to go up higher anybody ready to move up in higher hearts into deeper depths how we going to get there remember jesus he'll take you there remember he died in your place remember he bore the scars you should've bore remember he took the beatings for the peace of your life hallelujah remember jesus tonight and let the power remembers raise you into heavenly places in christ jesus remember his death remember his life remember his birth remember his resurrection remember his promises remember his word oh my sharpen your spiritual memory the devil's doing everything he can to dull it remember the joy in the night season david said like this my soul shall be satisfied as with tomorrow and fatness and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips when i remember thee upon my bed and meditate on me in the night watches oh my don't that make you excited i know where i am it just feels good when i get to thinking about see there is one among you preaching he said you think i'm excited i'm not i know exactly where i'm at he said i just get excited when i begin to remember brother bill there's one among us and if we can remember who's among us oh god this is another sermon coming out right now if we can remember who's among us he will take us through whatever we come to if we can remember who is among us he will bring every mountain down come on zerubrable you don't have the power to make the mountain a stone or a plane but if you'll speak the word with silence and crying grace unto it then the headstone will make every mountain a plane the low places will be raised high and the high places will be brought low remember jesus i say that tonight there is one among you the great holy spirit who promised to be poured out in the last day i see him i see a sign constantly i know he is the messiah because he still does the messiah mind oh he still does the messiah's sign rather see that our spiritual memory how is it quicker our spiritual memory is quickened by the holy spirit peter or rather john would say in john 14 26 would record the words of jesus the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and what bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i have said unto you now i'll say like this we all need a reminder from time to time i received a reminder the other day from a brother in a group text he would send out this this text of with all the things that's going on and this word really called me he would say you know as the head of your household you can literally place that token over your wife and your kids while everyone is growing weary feeding off of media us as the head can place this blood over our loved ones and keep them covered we've heard this but it's because but it's became so real to me this morning while praying over my family this morning while they slept it's our duty as men but it is also our privilege think about that we have the privilege as the head of our household see that word just caught me amen household what does the word household mean it means of one's own house belonging to a house or a family domestic intimate belonging to one's household related by blood see amen the household is a relation by blood he meant kindred belonging to the household of god of the thing belong and devoted to adherence amen deuteronomy 16 verse 5 thou mayest not sacrifice the pastor with any of the gates which the lord thy god giveth thee but at the place which the lord god shall choose to place his name in there shalt thou sacrifice amen that evening after going down of the sun at the season thou came us forth out of egypt paul comes in first corinthians 12 and verse 13 and says for by one spirit we are all baptized into one body whether we be jews or gentiles bond or free have been all made to drink into one spirit see then by one spirit one spirit the spirit of god which is the life-giver to the word the seed to vindicate the seed for that season direct quote amen the life-giver amen to the word the seed to vindicate the seed for that season amen by one spirit we're all baptized into one body and that body is a family it's the family of god look around you tonight amen this is your family i know i know we got blood cannon relationships but i want you to i want you to remember tonight who your real family is i want you to remember who you're going to spend eternity with amen remember you're of the family of god and that's the house of god and the house of god is the name of jesus christ and the name of the lord is a mighty tower and the righteous run into it and are safe he said now how are you going to come in by a title how is your check going to be received by saying paid to the order of reverend doctor or minister you might be a reverend not to minister but the name of the lord is jesus christ amen somebody shout jesus christ the name of the lord is jesus christ i have chose to put my name at the door of the house of my worship for my family will be gathered in there under the blood glory i feel like shouting for a second my family will be gathered in there under the blood see then tonight amen you are kin to god by the blood hallelujah tonight you are kin to god by the blood amen your connection to god is by the blood then there is nothing that can separate us from the love of god that is in christ jesus those who have been born and drawn and connected by the blood like it was in egypt anything outside died and in there there's no living bread there's no denominational mixture it is my house my children born to my genes glory to god he says my genes are in them oh i hope this is okay my genes are in them i put my word in them i'll write up on the tables of their heart that's my family the family of the body of jesus christ amen the family and the door you'll come in it's not methodist baptist pentecostal amen it's the door where i put my name amen and the name is jesus christ of whom the whole family in heaven and earth is named the name of jesus christ then we are of the household of unadulterated faith come on church we're not of the household of fear we are of the household of unadulterated faith paul would say faith is the substance of things hoped for it's the evidence of things not seen that word substance means foundation he would go on to say in hebrews 3 14 we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence amen steadfast unto the end see right now the devil wants you to forget who you are and he wants to take you out of the battle quickly amen but if there's ever been a time amen to hold your steadfast right now is the time to stand now you find there if that faith amen is the foundation look at this in the stature of perfect man he said you must be born again and when you're born again you can't be born again without having faith so see on my chart here i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it faith is the foundation of amen so faith is the foundation of the family of god oh i hope this is okay without faith it is impossible to please god see when you're a skeptic of the bible you'll be a skeptic of the word being right you might as well stay back until first you believe it amen see just depends now watch this what is sin it's unbelief there's only two elements controls the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other you're possessed of one that dominates your life it just depends on how much faith you have is how high you can rise no wonder the devil wants you to forget and fear amen and not remember and believe because fear will take it down amen but faith will take you up just as much faith as you can have this is how high you can rise faith and doubt will not mix together may i say this like this faith and fear will not mix together this will be either a church of faith or it'll be a church of fear amen brother dan your church will be the church of faith or a church of fear brother bill it'll either be a church of faith or a church of fear amen there are no two households that has two heads that will ever succeed but a house that's divided against itself will fall oh come on if we welcome fear in we're making faith unwelcome if we welcome down in we're making faith unwelcome but is there anybody here that's ready to take back dominion of your own house as the family as the genes of god that's the bloodline of almighty god you're ready to stand up and say devil you might have brought fear in but you're taking it back to hell where it come from no we will not welcome fear we will welcome faith we welcome faith faith to believe for salvation faith to believe for healing see what happened in the fall in the garden it produced the faith but the prophet said it was a hybrid faith he said see what a hybrid faith does is it takes what man says and mixes it with what god says and produces the faith which is the hybrid faith which is not an unadulterated faith which is not a substance faith he said see no satan come right along with his theology and eve mixed it and gave it to adam and calls the hybrid faith that's what the church has got today so-called church a hybrid faith it's mixed with fears doubts and frustrations if it is genuine faith it would not move come on now hybrid faith is mixed with fear it's mixed with doubt and frustration amen genuine faith will not move well preacher amen hybrid faith makes a beautiful church i'll agree with you it does it's made beautiful best ministries it's made beautiful road ground road choirs it's made beautiful doctors of divinity it's built beautiful buildings brother john amen that don't have no faith to weather the storm it can't go through the fire and come out on the other side of believer amen i'm not talking about a hybrid faith i'm talking about a living faith i'm on church our faith is not dead our faith is alive and well tonight we are just as strong tonight come on caleb we're just as strong to go in today as we were the day we came out our faith has not been mixed with what man thinks about the word our faith has been mixed with the spirit of god and it has quickened a pulsation in our hearts to believe when it's crazy to believe to stand when it's crazy to stand hybrid face a beautiful church but it's a dead church i hope that's okay there's no life in it it's dead it's a hybrid faith oh i don't believe that god was yes but now he's not a healer today that's a hybrid faith come on the hybrid faith limits the power of god he said watch amen see oh i believe he gave the holy ghost to the pentecostals back there but not today that's a hybrid faith amen condemned by god hybrid no good stay away from it it's evil it brings in doubts come on church hybrid faith brings in doubt well i might as well bring it to the message amen can i just go and bring it to the message amen well that was brother bama's opinion and that don't matter today and we move me on this amen i'll tell you what that is that's hybrid faith and as long as i've got breath in my lungs i will kick every devil hybrid faith out of the church and i will welcome the unadulterated faith of the living god to come in the church and to mix with faith in a heart that'll produce a change it brings in doubts well maybe i'll go up and get healed maybe the lord will heal me that's hybrid faith it's no good that's the church's faith we want god's faith anybody want god's faith amen god said something and that's the truth and we stay with it oh i wish he said see he said hybrid faith he'll read hebrews 13 and say jesus christ the same then hybrid faith comes in and says well in a certain way he's the same amen but he can't heal today because that's out of this program but genuine faith will say he's the same is there any genuine faith in the building tonight it'll say he's the same amen it's not hybrid it's not all church stepper theology it's not your religion it's not man's word amen mixed with god's word it's pure unadulterated faith which that's the faith that jude spoke of when he said we are to contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints amen listen to me tonight the faith that was delivered to the saints was not a hybrid faith it was not a it was not a denominational faith it was a pure faith of god what did jesus say he said have faith in god a prophet comes along and says in other words what he means is have the faith of god see then this generation is the first generation in 2000 there's a preacher in here tonight amen amen it's the holy ghost are you hearing me tonight amen there's a faith in this building tonight amen the faith of god returned to this generation through a message where is the last time you've seen a man since creation amen speak and swirls come into existence amen speak in the nature elements obey his voice amen it's never happened until god would send a prophet that would restore the faith of god to the church of god i'm on church you've been sitting back beat down long enough the devil hates you he fears you because your voice is the same as his voice and when you speak it'll paralyze demons greater is he that is in you glory to god creator is he that is in you than he that is in the world there's a power to speak there's a faith to speak amen there's a faith that is returned it's an unadulterated faith you know what unadulterated means it's not mixed or diluted with any different or extra elements it is complete and absolute having no inferior added substance it's pure i'm on church amen god's faith is not added with the baptist faith it's not added with catholic faith it's not added with denominational faith god's faith is pure pure pure faith we have received absolute faith god have mercy look in john 16 he says in verse 23 can i have a few more minutes in that day you shall ask me nothing verily verily i say unto you whatsoever you shall ask the father in my name he will give it to you hitherto have you asked nothing in my name ask and you shall receive that your joy may be full come on friends god don't want you sitting in church frowning god don't want you sitting there looking like him amen well i might as well preach that now god don't want you looking depressed amen i preached to people before brother john and one time i preached to him they look like they're on the world on top of the world and the next time you preach to them they look like the world's on top of them amen that's that's not how god desires you to be he sent this faith that your joy may be full in the age you're living in amen see whatsoever you shall ask your joy may be full these things i have spoken unto you in proverbs but that time cometh when i shall no more speak unto you in proverbs but i shall show you plainly of the father listen friends you're living in the hour when the mighty god has been unveiled before you amen you're not looking at him through proverbs you're not licking him to a veil or a glass darkly amen the same shekinah glory that filled the old testament has returned to the church open your eyes and let us see god let it seem in the presence of his deity let it seem as not a dodie or grandpa let it seem as a mighty living warrior god who's come on the face of the situation we're looking at god plainly for the father himself loveth you because ye have loved me and i believe that that came out of god i came forth from the father and him come into the world again i leave the world and go to the father his disciples said unto him lo now speak us down plainly and speaketh no proverb now are we sure that thou knowest all things and need us not that any man should i see by this we believe that thou came us forth from god jesus answered amen do you now believe do you now believe you have heard of the father you have heard of god you have heard of his word but now you're okay i'm about to shout all over this place are you hearing me tonight you're not looking at him through proverbs you're looking at him for yourself when you've seen me you've seen the father it's the uniting time and time what did jesus say in that day you shall know that i am in the father and the father is in me and i knew and you and me he said what day is that brother said that's this day you're living in the day when jesus christ has returned in plain views to the church do you now believe see us thou all things know us tell all things he said see amen god knows the heart of every man do you believe that he will only give it to us in measure but look to me friends if you'd see his great presence feel his spirit i don't have to feel it you don't have to do it you should believe it in the first place faith was here before feelings come on church amen belief was here before feelings amen you shouldn't have to feel it to believe it amen but when you see him come down brother i'm saying this is the fulfillment of this scripture when you see him come down and manifest himself just exactly as he did in the days gone by then you should have altogether pure unadulterated faith in him and then accept him on them grounds when you see him come in the glory of his word you should accept him on the grounds that he's come to the church in real unadulterated faith is taking god in his word i say tonight friends we want a church with pure faith unadulterated faith amen amen faith in the lord jesus christ that is predominating amen true unadulterated faith will hold you safely against the cross that's a direct quote true unadulterated faith will hold you safely against the cross unadulterated faith holds fast to the promise then we're being baptized by this token he says see now we are subject to the gifts that's in there when we were baptized into him we have every promise that god made laid at our fingertips no sin is in there no death is in there even sickness cannot stay in his presence if satan then puts his hands to you and tries to tempt you into something you hold your token in your hands and you show that you're a redeemed product of jesus christ and let your unadulterated faith wave that token there and say i am a product at jesus christ come on church amen you got a right amen brother john your children have been born in your house amen they're your children they're yours by your blood amen they've got a right to claim the promises that you made them and somebody else can try to take it from them but they've got a right to stand there and say john martin is my father and he said i could have these things and you've got no right to take it amen wave your identification before the enemy and say you cannot take it well if that can be that way with the natural father then how much more without my father amen with jehovah we can take the token of the holy ghost we can wave in the face of depression we can wave in the face of confusion and say i'll hold safely to the cross i'll clean hallelujah he said what's going to happen then sickness is going to flee because we have been given an invitation to the household of faith listen when an invitation is sent there must be a response and your response is your action come on your response is your action remember the prayer line says lady you're laying there do you think god would heal your fat cancer on the lung if you believe with all your heart you'll listen at me you have only one thing to do you're laying there like the lepers laid at the gate he's telling her you have no other options this is your only option you're either going to do it or you're going to die they said why do we sit here until we die if we sit here we'll die if we go in the city we'll die we only got one chance that's go to the enemy if he keeps us we live if we don't we die he says but you're going to die anyhow you're not invited to go to an enemy's camp i'm on church do you realize tonight you don't have to go to hell to get your salvation you don't have to go to hell to get your healing you don't have to go to hell to get your joy when christ died he that preached to the souls amen descended into hell and took the keys of death hell in the grave brother baby said like this he said he went to hell so i don't have to go come on friends you ain't got to go to hell tonight and take the power of god from the devil jesus went down there for you and he took it for you the only thing you got to do is rise up and go the house of jesus christ which is the household of faith and accept your healing and believe that god will heal you that cancer it will go out of your lungs and you'll be made well somebody shout glory oh you got to let it out every now and again it'll hurt you ain't been glory to god we don't have to go to hell tonight he went for us the only thing we got to do is accept brother what god done for us 2 000 years ago hallelujah glory to god then with that word i refuse to fear the devil i refuse to fear hell i know this last day amen is plagued with true spirits it's the spirit of fear and it's the spirit of faith i'm a labor here for a minute and i'm going to try to close y'all's killing me but i'm loving every minute of it two spirits in the land today one is the spirit of fear the other is the spirit of faith the prophet said be not afraid there's two elements control the entire human race in the world one of them is fear and the other is faith well glory to god with andrew amen the democrats are controlled by faith by fear and republicans are controlled by faith the entire human race republican independent liberal conservative the entire human race is plagued by the spirit of fear the only thing that separates you from the entire human race is a bloodline by a household by a gene seed of god by a kindred king of god that separated you by predestination that you would not be swept away in the fears of laodicea but you would rise in the power of faith it's either fear faith controls every nation every nomination every individual you're either fear or faith that controls you somebody shout fear or faith fear or faith i say faith over fear i say faith over fear he said brother andrew those two spirits are representing two persons that's right i almost said like this the spirit of fear represents the devil amen i feel that devil right now pushing against me because he knows somebody's about to go free he knows somebody's about ready to remember who they are they're going to remember where god called them and they're going to believe their way out of the situation they're in spirit of fear represents the devil but the spirit of faith represents jesus christ then today there are two households in the land one of them has to have a head both has to have a head may i say the household of fear the head is the devil the head of the household of fear is the devil but the household of faith amen the head is the lord jesus christ the head of the household amen knows the house that's why jesus would say i know thy works and thy tribulation and thy poverty amen thou art rich but i know the blasphemy of them which say they are jews and are not but they are of the synagogue of satan see he is looking down upon his family he is the head of his household he is the provider he is the protector your father knoweth the things you have need of oh it is not true today for the artists and age when they're full of wealth amen and often the criteria of spirituality is an abundance of earthly goods we may not have enough money in our pocket tonight to buy a warm cheeseburger after church but if we've got the blood of jesus christ amen flowing through our veins we are the richest people in flint michigan tonight we are the richest church on the face there we have got the kingman skinship to jesus christ he is our father come on friends i told somebody i said look i know gas prices are going crazy right now but don't you forget amen your father is the father who showed up at a wedding one time and there was no wine they ran out of wine and his mother looked at him and said go get some water and just bring it in his presence he'll turn it into wine amen and they said whatever he say do you better do i told somebody today i said if it gets where i ain't got no gas i'll go get a water hose and fill up my tank because my god can turn water into wine he can turn water into gasoline your father knows the things you have needed your father knows everything about you he is a rich god you're in a rich household well glory to god you're in a rich household tonight you're not wearing a second-handed robe you're wearing the best robe you can wear you're not eating the crumbs you're sitting at the table feasting up on seven seals revealed man and the age you're living in oh the bible says it amen this this time is preaching faster i can't preach can i have a few more minutes the bible prophesies that the time we're living in will be a fearful time jesus said you'll hear of earthquakes divers places famines pestilence fearful sights great signs shall there be from heaven look at this word fearful it means to strike terror it means a cause of fright the prophet said one of the greatest curses on the church today is fear everybody's scared to death it's what's going to happen who what he said even when fearful sights come lift up your head if you're of the household of faith you can lift up your head for your redemption draw a nigh amen don't worry about the sputniks don't worry about all these things and quit sitting here looking for something greater come on well something greater is coming even something greater is coming the prophet said don't look for nothing greater we've already got the greatest thing in heaven the holy spirit manifesting himself in this generation there's nothing else can be done when you see these fearful sides lift up your heads amen your redemption draws nigh amen see what that word fearful means it means to strike fear it means to strike terror let me set you like this natural terrorism is an awful thing we a few years ago we were up in in new york for some meetings and brother brother there in the church at brother yvonne carrion's he took us down to the 911 memorial he meant that man that actually took us i didn't know while we were in there brother bill he was he was walking through kind of to himself you know and i could tell he's a bit subdued amen and afterwards he told me he said andrew he said i was in the bottom of these towers on the morning they blew up he said that was the day that i gave my heart back to god he said i hope i'm not opening up too much about his testimony he said that morning he said i left home and he said my wife told me it's over we're going to split up you're going to find somewhere else to live you're not coming back home you're living a horrible life he said i left that morning not having a home to go to he said the morning the towers blew up he said my car was outside fried to a pancake he said i'll tell you why i'm crying in here he said because it was the day that jesus christ changed my life for him but there was a heavy there was a there was a heavy spirit in that building it was a place where over 3 000 lives were lost in one day see that was a natural terrorism and i'll say this natural terrorism is awful but let me say there's also spiritual terrorism you say what is terrorism it's the use of fear and acts of violence in order to intimidate societies governments or against an ideology even common definitions of terrorism refer to violent acts which are intended to create fear or terror they may be done for a religious political or ideological goal and it's used as illegal violence that if the devil is intimidating you tonight he is illegally using fear against you well let me just go ahead and cut to the chase and say satan is a terrorist and i'll say what else a terrorist will do a terrorist will disguise herself to try to fit in the pattern of their surrounding if you go in that memorial 911 you'll see a video screen of those terrorists that hijacked those planes they didn't come in robes and and turbines on their head and all kinds of things they come in looking like everybody else they went through security like everybody else but they were terrorists in disguise well paul says i know that after my departing shot gravious wolves enter and among you not sparing the flock he would also that say satan himself is transformed into an angel life that word transform means fashion himself into something see then the devil comes in the church as a terrorist amen attempts to destroy the church by lying promises by the spirit of deception amen by resting of the scriptures but let me set you like this when you show up for church the devil shows up too because he's a terrorist when job went to the presence of god blood said the devil was right there with him he said see the devil was right there and the bible says amen that job began to fear and the thing he feared come upon him amen i'm closing right here in just a moment in the book of job it says job fear what he feared it actually happened what brought in his fear see notice this his faith would have kept him from it but his fear brought it to him i'm on church fear was the vehicle that brought jobs to caesars to him fear was the vehicle that brought jobs fears upon him he said but faith would take it away amen job had a fear that these things would come upon him and they did and if you have a fear that your disease won't leave you it won't but if you have faith it will come on peter amen get out of the boat and walk on water oh my i'm scared he was doing all right till he got scared amen the prophet said he stepped down and said lord i'll just walk but when he got his eyes on the waves he got scared what come in his mind the first thing i'm going to walk because the word said for me to walk and the next thing he looked at his symptoms he looked down out there he seen how big the waves was and he got scared and what he did down he went what he feared happened but what he believed happened come on he believed if that was the word he said bit me to walk and i'll walk and he had enough faith to step out on the water but the symptoms rose up around him and he looked around and he began to go down oh come on church this is not the time to look down this is not the time to turn around he said the substance would have went right over the top of that white calf and went right onto him see if he had perfect faith oh god if he would have kept his eyes with a damn on jesus he would have walked over them white caps he would have walked over them lying symptoms let me let me knock the devil square in the face and we'll go home fear is of the devil somebody preached with me fear is of the devil so don't fear everything jesus would say fear not fear not amen god don't want you to fear he wants you to believe your great adversary the devil can catch you in one way he'll try another he said but see look to jesus jesus came to destroy the works of the devil that's why god was made both soul and body jesus had both soul and body and yet was god i love this brother bill he came to take on himself the full form of man to redeem the full form of man back to god he come to take on the full form of man to redeem the full form of man back to god that's why he come in flesh and soul i say to you like this resist the devil resist the spirit of fear resist steadfast in the faith what are you saying preacher i'm saying the devil uses fear to attack the church the living god to intimidate them i know what i'm talking about let the power of god move into service and people start dancing and shouting and rejoicing and that old terrorist of hell will come in name satan and he'll feel that fear that you say around listen you all better be careful this might turn into wildfire he's intimidating you but remember you're of the household of faith what does the word intimidate mean it means to frighten or all someone especially in order to make them do what one wants them to do i find it amazing the problem of god would come along and said like this he would bring us the secret to the victory in the battle of intimidation of a man waking up and the devil in his bedroom and the devil looks at the man and says boo and the devil gets bigger and the man gets smaller he says boo again the devil gets bigger and the man gets smaller he keeps saying boo bye brother said that the man got so small come on boo send the light church and the devil got bigger and the church got smaller boo devil got bigger church got smaller he said but then all of a sudden the man realized we're gonna have to do something we're gonna have to do something he said so he looked over brother john and there was his bible and he picked up his bible and he looked the devil in the eye and said boo back brother seth he said boo back and when the man said boo he said all of a sudden the devil got smaller and i got bigger the devil got smaller and i got bigger he said i begin to say boo boo boo until the devil was booed back to hillary come from i'm on church and is there any believers here tonight that's ready to tell that devil that's been intimidating you he's been scaring you he's been robbing you he's been beating you he's been abusing you amen and you just been getting smaller and smaller you forgot who you were you forgot who your daddy was you forgot what you believe but is there any believers ready to look at that devil tonight and say boo devil blue devil i resist you in the name of jesus christ i will look at the word i close by saying this you were not born in your father's house to carry the spirit of fear you were born you were born to walk in the faith of jesus christ you know what fear is it's an unnecessary weight now i'll say to you like this you're going to the airport and somebody hands you a suitcase you're running late to get to your gate they say here carry this suitcase for me would you carry it for me you're trying to cross the finish line i mean you're trying to get to the gate preaching to you now carry this for me and then here comes somebody else says hey would you mind to carry mine and then somebody else says would you mind to carry mine and before long you're carrying about three unnecessary suitcases trying to get to the airport trying to get to your gate to take a flight out of there you've got a destination to reach you're trying to reach your destination and somebody's got you carrying unnecessary baggage that's hindering you from operating the way you should to get to your transportation to go to your destination well i got to carry it i got to carry it well my question is has it got your name on it brother dan has it got your name on it if it's got susie or or chess or john's or billy's name on it it don't have andrew's name on it then i don't have to carry what's not mine and if you're carrying fear you're only helping the devil out carry something that's not yours you know how you get rid of it you don't have to fast it out you don't have to stomp it out you just got to let it go you could be running to the airport and when the revelation strikes your heart i don't have to carry this any longer this don't have my name on it this person is not my father they're not my brother my sister i'm carrying somebody's luggage you can drop it right there and you'll be freed instantly oh church the living god is there anybody ready tonight to drop the spirit of fear drop the spirit of nervousness drop the spirit of anxiety drop the spirit of depression then let's drop it as we stand to our feet tonight let's drop these things tonight we are of the household of faith we are not of the majority that is looking at fearful sides we are looking with the minority we've looked away to jesus we've looked away to jesus all my numbers 21 would tell us look away to jesus when everyone that is bitten looketh upon it it shall live zechariah 12 will say they shall look upon me whom they've pierced and they shall mourn for him isaiah 45 22 would say look unto me and be saved all you the ends of the earth for i am god and there is none else let me say this probably god said like this when the systems of the earth comes to an end look away to jesus he said see i would like to kind of turn that a little bit and say it like this look especially unto me at the end of each world system now brother dan is about makes me shout he always makes himself known so real at the end of a world system when it's coming to an end is when he makes himself known so real then may i ask you where we are tonight that's right we're at the end we're at the end of a world system that cannot stand any longer we're living in a democracy that's living on borrowed time but god would choose you to be a son would choose you to be his son would choose you to be his daughter brother dad the father of all fathers would choose us to be one of his sons bring us into the household of faith by his blood give us a token in this age of fear this age of neurotic to wave in the devil's face as an ensign we're not of the household of fear of the household of faith you realize tonight the word of god will defeat the devil anywhere anytime anyplace under any conditions about 1958 i study the other day and i come across something brother graham is talking about jesus use the same word that we're using he was the word to defeat the devil probably god will set like this shall say over and over the word of god will defeat the devil anywhere anytime anyplace in any condition one service he'll actually not 1958 i believe he'll start listing conditions he'll say if it's in the belly of a whale the world of the word will defeat the devil he'll say if it's in a hus if it's in the lion's den the word will defeat the devil he'll say if it's laying in a hospital bed dying of cancer the word will defeat the devil brother danny says something that strikes me if it's laying in an automobile accident bleeding to death he'll defeat the devil 1958 he says if the word in that condition is in the heart of the believer it'll defeat the devil brother what weaker condition could you get in than to be laying in an automobile accident bleeding to death died and the word will still defeat the devil in that condition that was 1958 then the other day i was just the one when billy paul brother billy paul's testimonies and he says it like this he said on the day of the accident he said when they was in the accident he said i ran up to daddy's car he said there's daddy laying out over the steering wheel he said bleeding all over the place said laying there dying and he says in that condition i asked daddy daddy are you okay he said billy where's sarah he said daddy sarah's behind you but billy said there was no ambulance there there was no medical scans there he said and daddy looked at me and said billy sarah's back is broke not even talk to her but that same gift that was an operation that could tell you what color the doctor's clothes was that talked to you that day that same gift that could tell you what you had on or what you were wearing was laying in an automobile accident and the body bleeding to death but the word was still in full power and would say sarah's back is broke and he'd say take my hand and lay it over on her back on her body and she would be healed he would say where's mama he would say daddy she's laying there dying they been she's already dead he would say take my hand and lay it over on her body oh god friends i'm catching a second wind right now are you hearing the power that's been restored to you it don't matter what condition he was laying in an automobile accident bleeding to death and the word was stealing authority well if we're not in automobile accident tonight we're in the house of god and we need healings and deliverances and miracles then quit sitting there letting the devil tell you you're the weakest christian the prophet said that word is in the reach of the weakest of christians you can use it it'll defeat the devil in the whales barely it'll defeat the devil in the lion's den it'll defeat the devil on the bed of cancer it'll defeat the devil in an automobile accident bleeding to death the word will defeat the devil and that word tonight is at your fingertips you've got rights to the word of the living god tonight you know that song he is here he is here can we just play that softly tonight i pray that tonight you can see who you are i was sitting today thinking we've just come through a pandemic and we didn't even get we we didn't even announce the pandemic's over till the war breaks out it's one fear after another fear after another fear after another fear and i began to think of a prophet's words he would say it like this he would say watch russia watch russia but you know what he never said he never said fear russia he said watch russia there's a big difference in watching something fearing something watch russia you're not of the household of fear you're the household of faith god did not place you here to be crippled under the pressures of fear in this last age he placed you here to rise in the spirit of faith let's bow our heads together tonight he placed you here to access the powers of god he sent a prophet to you in this generation that would remind you would remind me would remind the church that all these things are possible we have access to all these promises by the faith of jesus christ with every head bowed every eye closed here tonight as they played this softly let's remember whose presence we're in let's remember who's in our midst tonight it's not a special preacher or a vistan evangelist it's the king of all kings

trouble and i said the putter if i will stand between you and a car wreck it'll stand between you in a sickness when i begin to say that brother bill there is a sister about right where you would be sitting she began screaming and just worshiping the lord and afterwards we went over to the to the dining hall and she said i gotta have the microphone and testify she said for years i've had a fear that i'll die in a car wreck she said for years that's been my fear i'll die in a car wreck she said in a few days ago we was leaving to bring our kids to this camp and she said that fear just gripped
