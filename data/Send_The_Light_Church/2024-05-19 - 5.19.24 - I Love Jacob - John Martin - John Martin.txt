for the courage to come out to the house of the Lord here may God bless you and I say with a name like that sherish I believe he's a believing man he believes has faith he sure the Bible is correct amen that's a good name turn with me if you would this morning to our opening scriptures here and first is going to be in Luke 16 and then the second is going to be in Romans chapter 9 Romans chapter n now I know that you are saving all your amens and things for the for the ministry of the word so uh thankful for that amen amen before we read the scriptures here let's look to the author and just invite invite him in to take the preeminence here our heavenly father Lord we are so dependent on you at this moment amen we're asking Lord that you would come into this service in a greater way we know you're here we know you you came with each of your children Lord we've invited you you said you inhabit the Praises of your people Lord we just ask that you would take control of every spirit in here Lord that you would bring it under subjection to you to your word that you would cast out all doubts all fear anything that is UN like you we pray that it be separated from this little room right now that you could come and Reveal Your Precious word to us Lord may you strengthen us through the word may you guide us may it be a light to our path father may you continue to encourage us on this journey to the Rapture father um give us the Revelation that we have need of that we may press the the battle Evermore God will be careful to give you praise and honor for all these things in the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray amen amen amen just one verse here in Luke chapter 16 verse 16 says the law and the prophets were until John and since that time the kingdom of God is preached and every man presseth into it amen amen and then in Romans chapter 9 verse number 13 as it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated amen God bless you may be seated I really enjoyed the service on Wednesday Brother Bruce said this statement he said if we're going to have a successful Walk we're going to need to remember who we are no matter what you're going to you got to remember who you are amen we were reminded Wednesday that this jacob guy he was a deceiver and a liar and and he really and he and he really was but honestly God loved this man Jacob amen I want to title this this morning I love Jacob amen I want us to remember that no matter how bad things get in our lives at times no matter what's going on there's something that will always attract the love of God even to an unconverted Soul amen and that is the willingness to do whatever is needed to get a complete nature change and that's why brother Bram said that mission work was always in the will of God that's why there's no other place in the Bible where it states that all the Angels Rejoice over one sinner that comes to repentance because it is the beginning of a nature change amen now Jacob had a brother and his name was Esau and they were twin boys they had Godly Parents Isaac and Rebecca and their grandfather and grandmother were also Godly their grandfather was the father of their faith and the father of our faith that was Abraham amen Abraham had two sons one by faith and the other by the flesh The Works of the Flesh and I want us to back up and just get a little background here in Romans chapter 9 verse 6 the Bible says not as though the word of God had taken none effect the word doesn't affect everybody the same right the same word preached to 10 different people can affect them differently that's so it's just Jesus told us about having four different heart conditions in which if if our heart is a little bit Stony you know we're the the word is not going to be able to Avail in our life if it's mixed with thorns and the things of the world the cares of this life thing being bothered about things the word of God's not going to grow in our life if we just happen to be here because it's Sunday and it's time for church we we're coming to church without a purpose well the word of God is not going to help us it's not going to take the effect we've got to have what's called good ground amen I trust this morning that we all have good ground this morning amen he says for there for they are not all Israel which are Israel so there's an Israel of the flesh it's the natural Seed of Abraham and it's it's by their their natural DNA you can know who they are Ishmael was the first one and there's a Israel of the spirit of God which is the spiritual Seed of Abraham amen and by the spiritual DNA which is the faith of Abraham you can know them right amen is that is that simple one is of faith and one is as of the flesh amen verse seven neither because they are the Seed of Abraham other words the natural Seed of Abraham are they all the children are they all children but in Isaac shall they thy seed be called so here in this verse we're seeing that even though they came forth from Abra it doesn't mean they're the the the the CH a CH a child of God that's right a child of the promise ishmail was born by the will of the flesh Isaac was born by the will of God both sons of Abraham one the natural of the flesh came forth by the efforts of the flesh the other uh the seed of God came forth by faith in what the will of God not just Faith but faith in the will of God it has to be the will of God verse eight that in that is that they they which are the children of the flesh these are not the children of God it's a strong statement for ishmail but the children of the promise are counted for seed for the seed for This Is The Word of Promise at this time will I come and Sarah shall have a son now that was the will of God and he spoke it and Abraham believed it amen and not only this but when Rebecca also had conceived by one even by Our Father Isaac for the children being not yet born neither having done good and evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth it was said of her that the Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is written Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated such a contrast when we think of God we don't think of of him as someone that hates because God we we've heard more than ever that God loves everybody amen but here in the scriptures we find out that God hated Esau there was a reason for it and this deceiving boy this boy boy that went to extremes to trick his I can't imagine going to such extremes that's good to deceive my father but there was something about this boy that God loved now they were they were twins Esau uh was actually born first amen and then uh Jacob came out now with when Esau's last foot came out Jacob was was holding onto the heel and it was a sign it it was a sign now because Esau was born first it meant that he would get the inheritance of his father Jacob now what that really meant is he would get a greater inheritance than Jacob would get the first born was entitled to a double portion of his father's inheritance the firstborn was given power and authority over the family when he was gone he would take on the priesthood of the family and take care of Family Matters it was a great honor to be a the firstborn and to take on the family name it brought also a greater resp respect right to uh to to them so this is what Esau was already predestinated to get right I mean his father loved him yes it was sure as anything you're the firstborn you're getting it it was the Talk of the Town it was the talk of the family it wasn't like uh uh um Isaac didn't uh like Esau but he loved him and they must have talked about uh what you would be getting inherited when I was gone because he was getting older amen but when Jacob was born he came out second you heard Wednesday that he was he kind of an awful man an outright liar a Deceiver amen if you look it up it means a schemer a trickster a swindler but there was something about Jacob that God loved he was a supplanter that means in one place that he took by the heel he took by the heel that's what he was and that's what happened when he was born he took by the heel but what it meant spiritually now Jacob was able to restrict or restrain Esau from getting the birthright Jacob circumvent circumvented Esau he sees the birthright Jacob found a way around the problem to overcome and and take care of the first birth problem amen I hope you're with me I believe this is why God God said I love Jacob Jacob was willing to go to the extremest ends to get the birthright to get the rights of being born again to get the inheritance the double portion the power the authority to get the name to get the blessings of God Jacob was willing to do whatever he needed to do to get it right amen Jacob have I loved but ES saw I hate it Jacob was already in the position to receive the inheritance might say that he testified I'm predestinated to get it because he was right in order he was told by his father that he was being born properly yet God allowed the birthright to be stolen from him why did God actually hate Esau Esau loved his flesh more than he loved the benefits of his father's inheritance Esau despised the benefits that come from being the firstborn just like a lot of Believers today I believe despise the benef benefits that come along with being born again turn with me if you would to Genesis 2527 as we go through this the Bible says in Genesis 25:27 and the boys grew and Esau was a cunning Hunter a man of the field and Jacob was a plain man dwelling in tents we might say that you know we know that Esau was kind of hairy not kind of but greatly hairy and a hunter you know we might say he was a real He-Man he would be say there's a real man there and Jacob he didn't have much hair on him he was a plain man might say he was more of a Mama's Boy and Isaac loved Esau now look at the reason because he did eat of his venison in other words his father loved him for natural reasons but Rebecca loved Jacob I believe that his mother could see the motive yes that Jacob had and I think it's real important our motives today amen and Jacob S or cooked up some pottage and Esau came from the field and he was faint and Esau said to Jacob feed me I pray thee that with that same red potage for I am faint therefore was his name called Edom and Jacob said sell me this day thy Birthright in other words you want me to feed you let's make a deal amen and Esau said behold I am at the point to die what does it matter if I go to church what does it matter if I read the word listen to the tapes what does it matter if I try anymore right hold I'm at the point to die and what profit shall this Birthright do to me that's right I say here in is the too many Believers have the same attitude that Esau had or Esau did amen they don't want to die out to their own will right I'm I'm I'm I'm about to to die out and I can't take this anymore I just got to do my own will what profit shall this Birthright do to me right now how is this Birthright going to help my business my marriage my livelihood my life my dreams I only have so much time to live brother John I got to get everything I can get out of this life amen and Jacob verse 33 said swear to me this day and he swear unto him and he sold his Birthright unto Jacob he took the mark of the beast then Jacob gave Esau bread potage of lenos and he did eat and drink and Rose up and went his way and Esau despised his Birthright amen Esau dis esteemed his Birthright because to him it had no value right he didn't value it he valued what was the pain that he was suffering with right now more important than a nature change that word despise it means to regard with content to distaste to disgust to disdain scorn or Loaf in other words this new birth was a back burner this inheritance was a back burner for him maybe sometime down the road but right now I've got other things on my mind Esau despised his Birthright now how can we despise our Birthright today how can we despise the new birth or being born again with a new nature how can can we know too many people think that they're born again when they repent they get baptized the Holy Ghost comes upon them they speak in tongues and they think they're born again brother brandham said quoting he said that is only the beginning that is only the begin in other words there's a midle and there is an end to the new birth praise God the new birth is not just a one minute decision it's where our nature is constantly changing to be more like his amen now I think that that all make the Christian the more the most happiest and excited person on the planet right there it's the process of God's life the Holy Spirit coming and setting up his kingdom inside of us in Luke 17 verse 20 and when he was demanded by the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation in other words you're not going to see it neither shall you say Lo here or or low there amen behold the kingdom of God is inside of you yes amen it's inside it's within us now how could God's Great massive Kingdom all fit inside of each one of us he's Mighty he created this whole world that we know the all the galaxies and the planets and everything that we see was made by something he created and yet he's so powerful that he can dwell in the heart of a man that's the god that we serve it's the Holy Spirit which is I'll say it like this the Living Word of God you've got the written word that doesn't live it and then you've got the Living Word that lives it I think it's so misunderstood in churches but the New Birth really is but I'll say the kingdom of God is being ministered to us every time we come to church Peter said in second Tim second Peter 1:1 that we need to to be serious about making sure that we got all the kingdom that we're supposed to have for so in entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and our Savior Jesus Christ see in entrance is being ministered so as the word comes forth it's speaking to us what we need to do to allow God to come more into our heart see it has to go through free more agency that's what the ministry of the word's for wherefore I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you already know them and be established in the present truth we still have to be reminded amen amen how can we despise our right to be born again and and and despise the right of the new birth which God has promised every believer it's real simple by despising part of the word amen I just want to make it real simple for us how we despise our Birthright is by despising just part of this word it's it's so simple no one despises the blessings of God no one does nobody despises the promises of God we want them right but we despise correction that's right exhortation direction for our our our lives spiritually and this is how we can despise the new birth or our nature to be completely changed turn with me if you would to Hebrews chapter 12 and I want to read quite a few verses in here but you see we all feel that we're like Jacob and we're not like Esau in this the scenario but I'm telling you we The Inheritance understand that God had an inheritance for the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt amen and that was to go into the promised land now they received the blessings they went out they went on the other side of the uh of uh the river and they rejoiced and they were excited about being freed from the devil they could say that I'm I've been out I'm C out of the world and so they were in this place being out of the world but not yet into the Holy Ghost not into the promised land and in this place where you don't got enough Holy Ghost you're always murmuring and complaining and bothered about this and bothered about and God you should be doing this and it just been better if you would have never called me come on true I I I I hope there's somebody spiritual this morning in this church because it's the word of God and you know what when they came up to the promised land they despised what God had promised them a lot of people they're willing to go to church willing to get entertained they'll go as far as paying their TI amen but they're not willing to get a nature change that is how we can despise our Birthright Hebrews 12:5 says and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son despise not the chastening of the Lorden nor faint when thou art rebuked hey that's if there's any father that will not chasen his children nor rebuke his children I would say that that father is missing something and to ever have a God that you you just re you just dislike when he rebukes you something's wrong with your relationship with him amen right for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth and scores every son whom he receiveth if you endure chastening God deal with you as son for what son is he to whom the father chasethe be without chastisement whereof all are partakers of it right but if you if you're without it you don't want nothing to do with it then you're you're bastards and you're not really children of God furthermore we've had fathers of our flesh which corrected us and we gave them reverence shall we not much rather be subject unto the father of spirits and live amen for they verily for a few days chasing us for their own pleasure by the way I'm glad I'm glad it's being honest you know you can get so mad at your kids that's true you get so mad at your kids that you'll correct them for the purpose because you're mad at them that's for your own pleasure that's right but that is not the way God never cracks like that he has something greater in mind and it's our own interests it's the our character our soul he says shall we not okay okay but uh I'm sorry for very few days chase us after their own pleasure but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness God wants us to be more like him that's why he corrects us now no chastening for the present seem to be joyous but it's Grievous nevertheless afterwards it yield of the Peaceable fruits of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereby and this is what I say the word's going to come forth at this Pulpit whether you're here or not here the word is going to be preach the same whether you love God or don't love him amen whether you long for chastisement or you just I'll never take it nobody's going to tell me what to do God will remain the same it's up to us to be identified with what Spirit we are of am I think it's one of the most silliest things for us to act or to talk like we're a child of God and act like like we are not come on let the word be word every seed shall bring forth of its kind it's a I think it's about time for us to get more serious with the word of God we've got to exercise we've got to be exercised in this if God speaks we need to be more than hearers of the word but doers and if we become a doer of it then we're going to be more like Christ when it's all done so he concludes here wherefore lift up the hands which hang down and the feeble knees and make straight paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out of the way but let it be rather healed follow peace with all men does your bible say that right right follow peace with all men even my enemies I this is not my opinion we're not here to hear Brother John's opinion this is why I like scriptures they put us all on the right page amen amen follow peace with all men and Holiness without which no man shall see the Lord so we need this we need this correction to become more more holy or we won't see the Lord now look at this looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest a any root of bitterness springing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled many can be defiled by just one root of bitterness inside someone all right Sami colon verse 16 lest there be any fornicator I'll just say spiritually right now or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright amen one decision that we make can change your Eternal Destiny you look what Esau needed was to get more serious about his Birthright get more serious about his inheritance not just say well I'm the firstborn Daddy loves me too bad Jacob I'm sorry that ain't going to work there is a reason that God loved Jacob for ye know how that afterwards when he would have inherited the blessing he was rejected for he found no place of repentance look it though he sought it carefully with tears brother sister we can cross a line I'm not being judgmental but look we're running out of time to get serious with God I think this is the hour we need to be seeking that nature change that means getting serious with God because he's the only one that can give it coming to church don't give you a nature change you've got to believe the word as it comes forth youve got to apply it to your life the B the Bible says uh um um they it did the word did not profit them not being mixed with faith everybody's got faith that the word is true but who's got faith that the word is for you there's the difference it's got to be personally for you all right Joshua 24:2 Joshua is gathering all the tribes of Israel to shikim and Joshua said unto the people thus sayith the Lord God of Israel your fathers dwelt on the other side of the flood in old time even Tara and uh the father of Abraham and the father of Nicole and they served other gods in other words Abraham came out from the world he didn't have Godly Parents and I took your father Abraham from the other side of the flood and led him through all the land of Canaan and multiplied his seed and gave him Isaac and I gave unto Isaac Jacob and Esau and notice here I gave unto Esau Mount seir to possess it but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt oh did I read that right okay I thought I thought maybe I I I read that wrong but Jacob and his children went down into Egypt and I sent Moses also and Aaron and I plagued Egypt according to all that which I did among them after as I brought them out so notice He blesses Esau with Mount seir to possess it and then it takes Jacob and he sends them to Egypt where they's plagued now Esau despised his Birthright yet God blessed him amen naturally Jacob loved the birthright he loved the right to be born the proper way because that's the only way you can get the blessings of God is to be born the proper way yet he sends them down into Egypt and there he's plagued but look what happened to Esau in Malachi chap 1:2 Malachi 1: 2 I have loved you sayeth the Lord yet ye say where in H has thou loved us was not Esau Jacob's brother sayeth the Lord yet I love Jacob sir verse three and I hated Esau and laid his mountains and his Heritage waste for the dragons of the Wilderness amen why would you want to mess with a pot some something down here and miss all the spiritual things that God has for you look if all if if all you had to do was come to church and say Amen to the word and you would become more like Christ and I would be preaching that message but what we need is to get serious with the word that's being preached Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated Esau have I hated despised his Birthright despised his inheritance and it became a waste too many Christians are not willing to die out to get into the promised land now I'll say it like this we're not trying to enter a kingdom we're trying to get the kingdom to enter us and the only way it's going to enter us is if we die out to the kingdom that we're in amen we're all born in sin shapen in iniquity and we got this nature that have you ever looked in the mirror and literally hated I don't necessarily mean a real mirror but when you start taking a look at the way that you act your behavior the things the decision you make do you ever look at yourself and you say you are just terrible okay so these are called Giants a giant ugly nature that you don't want inside of you amen and we want to get the Giants out so we can possess the land so the Holy Ghost can have his way with love joy peace longsuffering that's our inheritance amen this is what God has forced on this side it's not just about on the other side look why are we worried about the other side if we're not willing to get what we need on this side to get to the other side praise the Lord Jacob was loved by God God loved Jacob because he wanted the birthright I don't care if you feel like you're a bad person Jacob did I don't care if you feel unworthy I don't care if you've deceived somebody I don't care if you feel like an outcast like you're walking in the flesh sometimes when you turn your heart to wanting the new nature change inside of you God will pour out his love upon you but you've got to turn your heart towards the nature change nothing else Works nothing else Works what good would it be to read the Bible if you're not interested in becoming the Bible right you might as well go read some other heal health help self-help book right if you want to know how to put Small Engines together you can get a book on small engines you could get uh small engines for dummies and then you can know better I'll say we read the Bible so we can become more like Christ amen I'll say it like this it's all our motive what's our motive what's our motive are we putting everything that we could be putting into becoming changed or are we satisfied with where we're at with God yes in the message impersonation of Christianity brother Bon says but Jacob have re recompense that that uh Birthright and regardless of what anyone called him if I could say it you excuse the expression you could call him a Holy Roller fanatic or whatever they wish to but he had respect to that Birthright and this is what he said that was his whole motive his whole motive isn't that what Jesus said that we need to do forsake everything and to put him first amen and I to really put God first is not to to walk around with the flag and say yes I'm in the message I belong to Jesus I go to church I'm a Christian Christian what that really really means is Christ is living in me what will it produce living for others it's that simple you don't want to hurt anybody you want to help them in fact you want to help them to the degree brother Ben that you want to love your enemy love your enemy that's what Christ inside of a person will do sir that that's what is whole motive no matter what it cost him he wanted the birthright and when we want God that much that is what will bring God's pour out his love upon you Esau sought to save his life and he lost it right and that's what Jesus said if you seek to save your life you'll lose it right Jacob paid the price and God said I love Jacob not all Israel is Israel not all message Believers are the bride but the true bride in the message will manifest the word of God there's the difference and I don't think we should stop short until we see it manifested in our life amen amen uh brother Gideon sent me this quote this morning no that's a wrong statement my daughter sent me this this morning in the me in the message Christ is the mystery of God revealed but the only way that you can actually be a Christian is for Christ to identify himself in you yes right that that's strong he says he says we got a stinger there I hope everybody on the tape gets that too that's why I'm reading that the only way we can actually be a Christian is for Christ to identify himself in you yes so it's not us saying we're a Christian it's us living that life that humble Godly holy life learn of me for I'm Meek lowly in heart you shall find rest for your souls it's when Christ identifies himself in us are they're getting sent me this quote this morning in the eagle in her nest he said businessmen what about you one of these days you're going to leave your business no matter how prosperous you are you're going to leave that business every penny you've made will be scattered among your relatives and it'll be fussing and fighting and carrying on then how much treasure have you got up yonder in heaven what do you know about Christ do you just know him as a blesser that blesses your soul he said Remember the rainfalls on the just and the unjust alike but I mean do you know Christ he says amen oh you say I know the Bible pretty good he said to know the Bible is not life it's not about knowing anything just want to follow that up with this scripture here that I already had before brother Gideon sent that 2 Corinthians chapter 5:1 17 therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature new creature it doesn't he doesn't know everything he's just a new creature the old creature old things are passed away the only way the old things are going to be passed away is the Nature has to leave because if if if you don't get the nature out you can wash up that pig put perfume on him put a bow on him all clean he's never been in his life since the day he was born and he'll run right back out to the old nature things so old things are passed away behold all things are become new new and and all things are of God now who's there who's there okay you know what really matters is do you have the desire like Jacob had to get there because Jacob was willing to do whatever he needed needed to do to get there and I'll tell you I I can't make it without God and if I'm going to find favor with God I've got to want what God wants for me I say we need to keep pressing on we need to keep fighting the good fight of Faith press towards the Mark we need to go on to Perfection to have that love in our lives that we need to have I'll tell you when it's there Jesus said that's my identification when all when you have loved one for another amen then shall all men not just people in the church but all men shall know you're my disciples when you have love one for another all right Romans chapter 8 we're going to need to go through this kind of quickly are you getting something out of this all right praise the Lord Romans chapter 8 H do you believe God is leading the church you believe God's leading you amen Romans 8 ver14 for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God that's right for we have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but we have received the spirit of adoption whereby we're crying ABA father so what's going on here what what what's happening the spirit itself is bearing witness with our spirit that we are not the children of the flesh but we're the children of God and if children then heirs Heirs of God join ears with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together now why is they sticking that in there if so be that we suffer with him that we may also be glorified together if we're going to break through this nature that we were born with in into the nature of Jesus Christ it will not happen without suffering the children of Israel when they came up to those giants they had to face their fears they had to walk they had to step over they had to say greater is he that's in me than this old nature that I was born with and they had to go after those Giants and if we're not willing to do that if we just don't want to deal with that part of our life you're really not manifesting yourself as a child of God that's right amen for I reckon Verse 18 for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us so how can you compare how can you compare I just think about Esau all he had to do is take a second God wasn't going to let him die though I walk through the valley of shadow of death I shall fear no evil I I know sometimes it seems so hard that you really got to come to the Altar and get serious with God and repent and and reconsecrate yourself to God you just need to get serious with God Amen I I know it seems like it's it's like I I could I could do it without doing that I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us for the earnest expectation of the creature is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God now the spirit of the Holy Ghost is leading us to manifest Christ right amen there's a part we play and there's a part he plays if we play our part no matter how we're all Jacobs we're all Jacobs but we learned Wednesday we're all israels right the thing is don't despise what you need to do don't despise that nature change don't despise well I don't really need to do that God hasn't called me to that I don't feel that I don't feel led to do that brother sister you don't know what you're saying you've got to come under subjection to the word if you're a child of God take the word of God as your absolute your ideas or whatever you've been taught or that don't mean anything in the past you got to throw it all behind Saul had to throw it all behind we got to throw it all behind don't be satisfied with just claiming you're predestinated amen predestination will always lead you to the manifestation of the word we've got to fix our eyes on becoming the word Romans 8:29 says for whom he did for no he also predestinated to be conformed to the image there it is the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among us we're we're we're part of the many Brethren praise the Lord I'm predestinated somehow I'm going to be just like Jesus it does not yet appear but when he comes I know I'm going to be just like him for we shall see him as he is the Bible says in the Samaran Church age brother B says be careful here and see this be careful here and see this it is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God he said it is the word or the seed now this is this was shocking when I read this to me it is not the person that comes to predestinated eternally from God it is the word or the seed in other words it's not well I'm just going to choose him I'm going to choose him and I predestinated them and I'm predestinated no what's really predestinated is is the word that is the seed and if you are the word then you're predestinated it's not you becoming the word the word's already in you right it's you yielding to what's already inside of you you dying out brother B says what we got to do is just lay out in the presence of the sun he says we're not willing to die out there lay in the Sun long enough to mature to ripen he said that is it way back there too far back for human and mind to grasp the Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and and decreed Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and neither was born neither had done good and evil see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God brought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed yes Jacob alone was seed and that's why he had respect to the birthright and to the Covenant of God if you are uh true seed you will hear the word and the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and your age amen he said see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you amen how beautiful in the message hear ye him brother B says notice now when a baby son was born into the family of his father he was born a son but yet he had no inheritance just as a son now there's where I think a lot of Full Gospel people let down a bit on our Doctrine see we can take a person and say well now he's filled with the Holy Ghost I think I might have quoted this when he speaks with tongues that he said that's it the person says well now he's filled with the Holy Ghost he speaks with tongues and that's it he said no he says you just only began you just been born into the family that's all that's the reason today our churches is not progressing the way that they should be I mean think about it how many times have you done something children husbands your wife's ask you to do something your mother asked you to do something they said I would like you to do this brother Marty can remember this when sister Kathleen would ask for something to be done maybe something in the garden and you did it and she said you have not completed it you don't clean your room by shoving all the toys under the bed see a lot of people well I I got this experience with God I spoke in tongues I danced I did all this and you know I'm in if you wake up tomorrow I'll say it like this today is the day of salvation we God is a living God he ain't a dead God we don't serve him I did this in the past no we we have new testimonies every day we're seeing the nature of God manifested in her life through trials every day am He's Alive and Well in that same me message he says we're children of God but we're losing our inheritance by our conduct the things that we do and the things that we permit to be done and the way we live and act and so forth we're living millions of miles below our privilege look if we listen to this we're going down this tells us we're right and what we got to do is deny this and remember the word this will keep us on track am I love Jacob he had a fight in him he had a real fight in him you know I could say this the natural seed had a fight in them too out of ishmail came the TW the 12 the Arab Nations they got to fight in them but their fight is physical it's outwardly but Jacob see we don't fight against flesh and blood right but we fight against principalities and spirits and you know where they're at they dwell inside of us often and if they're not dwelling in Us in that old nature it wants to come and anoint us and we need to recognize the fight is not here the fight is here Jacob had a fight here I don't care how good your fight is here The Battle Belongs to the Lord yes we've got to fight the good fight of Faith to get the nature change that's what we're fighting we don't want to become complacent with our old nature if we do I think think don't misunderstand me but just according to the scriptures that we're reading here if we become complacent about the nature change we're not going to find favor with God I don't want to be replaced with Esau just because I become complacent and not that big a deal if I get the nature change Jacob he held on to that heel I'm not going to let the blessings go right amen amen oh my my we're running we're running out of time you know what hopefully you're able to keep running just a little bit longer Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 verse 5 I'm just going to try to read these scriptures and they which are the children of the flesh are not the children of God that what we in our opening scripture okay now this can transpire each and every day for us Romans 8 verse5 for they that are after The Flesh they do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit but to be Carly minded is death but to be spiritually minded is is what life and peace because the carnal mind is enity it's against God it's against the word for it is not subject to the word neither indeed can it be right so then they that are in the flesh they can't even please God so how is God going to say I love you when you're in the flesh now don't misunderstand me I'm not trying to bring division here about God's love but what I am trying to say is we got to be honest we've got to be honest if our dealings it just doesn't matter about acting the right way living the right way how are we going to find favor with God Paul said to the galatian church this I say walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so we have a a a part to do and he goes on and he's talking about this battle in verse 17 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and they are contrary to one another so that you cannot do the things that you would now you take any two people that when they're fighting think about all the divorces that have happened when they're fighting let me just say how often have you ever heard hey let's get into a fight I know I'm wrong it just don't exist every man's right in his own eyes but we got to understand there's a way to fight the right way Vengeance don't belong to us it belongs to God Amen God just wants us to represent him represent him if the whole world is condemning somebody don't you be added on be like Jesus where's your accusers neither do I condemn thee but we're in a battle I just want you to know we're we're in a battle that battle is inside amen the kingdom of God cometh not not with observation but it won't come without a fight Matthew 11:12 and from that from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent taketh it by force that's exactly the type of what Jacob did we got to take on the nature of God by force because our old nature stand standing on the outside is too proudful it don't want to yield itself it don't want to Humble itself before the mighty hand of God it wants to act like it's a it's a Christian when it's when it when it's really not acting like one fight the good fight of Faith lay hold of eternal life lay hold of our inheritance amen take it by force Genesis chapter 32 now I do want you to know that I didn't start on time today so I get a few extra minutes and just because of that a little extra time I can have all the time I want now no it's not true all right Genesis chapter 3 to verse 24 Jacob was willing to fight to get what he needed and Jacob was left alone and wrestled with a man with him until the breaking of the day now that wasn't just a man he wrestled with God do you ever get in the prayer closet with God and you you needed him and a lot of times we get in the prayer closet we'll just go through our prayers and then you know we don't feel the presence of God we'll just like okay go on with our day I did my prayers yet we have needs yet we're just telling everybody about our needs or we're just wallowing because we've got these needs and nobody seems to want to help us now Jacob had a need he didn't get the whole church together he got alone with [Music] God and he wrestled he wrestled until the presence of the Lord came and when he saw that he prevailed prevailed not against him this man was not prevailing against Jacob that he was real serious he touched the hollow of his thigh and the hollow of Jacob's uh he touched his thigh in the hollow of Jacob's thigh and was out of joint as he wrestled with him now notice when you spend the time that you need with God your life will change forever because Jacob's always his walk was never the same they say he always had a different walk and the only one that can change our nature is Jesus Christ amen and we've just got to get serious and really serious wrestle with them I'm sorry if coming to church made you a Christian then when you come over to my barn you either come goats or chickens or cats or chicken eggs we've got to go beyond being in church right we've got to start getting serious with the word Saints and he said let me go for the day breth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me now that's what has to happen when you want your nature to be changed Lord I'll not let you go until you change me amen amen we don't get to that place change ain't coming Jacob have I loved Esau have I had that's why God loved Jacob because he was willing to fight right and we're fighting not to enter a kingdom but to get the kingdom inside of us and God wants to give us the Holy Ghost more than we could ever want it amen he's pressing to get it in but our own nature says no I don't I don't think I want to do that I don't want it to die out but we have received a kingdom don't be scared don't be scared there's nothing to beared about imagine having peace when everything around you is blowing up how can you put a price tag on that how about when everybody's hating you but you have nothing but love coming out of you turmoil everywhere but you've got joy unspeakable and full of Glory that's God's kingdom inside of you amen now that's there we just got to yield to it if the seed is in there you yeld to it Hebrews 12:28 wherefore we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear one more scripture First Peter chapter 1 verse 22 seeing ye have purified your souls in obeying the truth so the word's coming forth over the pulpit you're believing it you're saying amen with a heart in obeying the truth through the spirit unto UNF unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart don't be a don't be some fake a pure heart and do it fervently yes sir look at this verse being born again a new nature change not of the corruptible seed but of Incorruptible amen by what the word of God not by Church attendance by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for all the flesh is grass and all the glory of man is the flower of the grass the grass wither and the flower thereof falleth away H Elvis Presley long gone all the great actors and and and and and sports people all the musicians the majority of them got caught up in drugs true yeah there was Glory of man but it was like the flower of the grass that withth and falleth away it's gone but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached un to you yes this let's stand together we are blessed because we have the greatest thing known to man that's the word of God I went years had a Bible in my home and did not even know how powerful it really was having that Bible sitting there never changed me went to a Catholic Church never changed me but when somebody said this word is true and I believed it then change happened because it happens by believing it that it's for you it's for your life amen let's keep fighting amen let's keep fighting for the right thing amen let's fight for the nature change how many wants to see more of Christ in you let it become the greatest the greatest desire that you have amen and I'll say when you do that you might would just believe God's saying I love you I love you just like he said to Jacob amen let's sing uh when the battle's over amen we will wear a crown amen amen am I a soldier of the cross the follower of the lamb and Shall I Fear to own his cause or blush to speak his name and when the battle's over we shall wear a crown yes we shall wear a crown yes we
