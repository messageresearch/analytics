[35:47] even
[35:48] the message of this hour in in english
[35:51] when it you could have sent a prophet to
[35:53] to any nation lord you sent him to our
[35:55] nation we're grateful
[35:57] for this lord before we read lord
[36:01] we recognize even with these blessings

[36:11] we pray that lord that your power and
[36:13] your spirit would be

[36:51] chapter one starting with verse number
[36:53] 13 wherefore
[36:55] gird up the loins of your mind
[36:59] be sober and hope to the end
[37:03] for the grace that is to be brought
[37:06] unto you at the revelation of jesus
[37:09] christ
[37:10] as obedient children not fashioning
[37:14] yourselves according to the form or lust
[37:17] in your ignorance but as he which is
[37:21] but as he which have called you is holy
[37:26] so be holy in all manner
[37:30] of conversation because it is written
[37:34] be ye holy for i am holy
[37:38] god bless you may be seated this morning
[37:40] we're certainly not worthy
[37:43] uh not only to read this book but to
[37:46] preach this sermon knowing
[37:54] i don't know i've never experienced it
[37:57] before
[37:58] but i don't know if you get to a place
[38:00] where you feel like you are
[38:02] holy i don't know for speaking for me
[38:06] um this series on church order
[38:10] has
[38:14] been beyond challenging to me
[38:17] but has pointed me to where i've been
[38:20] out of order
[38:21] and i'm sure there are other things that
[38:23] are out of order that i don't even know
[38:25] about yet
[38:28] and uh i i can't put enough
[38:32] emphasis today on my wife
[38:35] who has been such
[38:39] an inspiration for this series
[38:44] uh uh outside of
[38:48] i'll say it's like this that god i
[38:50] believe used my wife
[38:52] to uh
[38:56] to bring about a better order and this
[38:59] something that's been
[39:00] god had been uh dealing
[39:03] with her about and of course
[39:06] my view was god is going to
[39:10] work on these things individually with
[39:12] people
[39:14] and um but seeing a need
[39:18] uh for teaching church order
[39:21] amen it's just something that has fallen
[39:24] through the cracks i think in
[39:25] 2002 we preached it in two thousand
[39:29] uh
[39:32] sixteen and and and here and here it is
[39:36] uh five years later and it it's
[39:39] something that needs to
[39:41] to be reviewed on on a yearly by yearly
[39:44] basis
[39:45] and and i've it's just definitely
[39:47] slipped and
[39:49] um i praise god for church order today i
[39:52] praise god for what he's doing
[39:54] to this series i praise god for the
[39:56] number of people have
[39:57] have come and said to me what is
[40:00] transpiring in their life and there's
[40:02] just been a number of people and i
[40:04] i thank the lord for it and i thank the
[40:06] lord for what he's
[40:07] he's he's doing in my life because he's
[40:11] he's calling us to a place that we're
[40:14] not there
[40:16] amen we had uh four parts
[40:19] uh to this series of church order
[40:23] first being god is a god of order
[40:26] the second god's order of reverence and
[40:29] respect to kind of sum up
[40:31] um you know we could talk about a lot of
[40:35] kings and uh magistrates and
[40:39] people down through the ages uh that
[40:41] were were kings that were
[40:43] emperors that were rulers that were
[40:45] presidents and
[40:46] and yet they were mean and evil
[40:50] and they called the shots but um
[40:53] and what they say it went but there was
[40:56] there was no righteousness there was no
[40:57] judgment
[40:59] and uh the god and that yet they were
[41:01] trying to have order of their kingdoms
[41:03] and
[41:04] when we think of nero i mean it's just
[41:06] history of how many
[41:07] uh christians he killed and how ruthless
[41:10] he was
[41:12] yet our god he's a god of
[41:15] order of reverence and respect
[41:19] and that's what he's called us to amen
[41:21] in part three we
[41:22] we talked about behaving in god's house
[41:26] and we're going to continue
[41:27] in that uh um as we as we
[41:31] further go on and in part four showing
[41:34] respect
[41:35] in god's house i don't think we can do
[41:37] too much
[41:38] respect we can't get to a place where we
[41:40] feel like
[41:41] we've achieved uh enough amen
[41:45] today we want to title this the call
[41:49] of becoming holy the call
[41:52] of becoming holy according to hebrews
[41:54] chapter 12 verse 14 we know that without
[41:57] holiness
[41:57] that none of us are going to see the
[41:59] lord amen
[42:01] so it's very important uh
[42:04] that we we pay attention to the
[42:06] importance of the subject holiness if
[42:07] god
[42:08] requires holiness from us then we he
[42:11] must be calling us
[42:12] to holiness amen can you can you say
[42:15] amen to that if if he he requires of us
[42:18] then he
[42:19] he's calling us to it amen first
[42:21] thessalonians chapter 4
[42:23] verse 7 says for god have not called us
[42:26] unto uncleanness
[42:28] but unto holiness as soon as we come out
[42:32] and and we're born
[42:33] and and and as soon as we begin
[42:37] to be able to manifest our true nature
[42:40] it is selfish to the core
[42:44] we will begin to manipulate our mom our
[42:47] dad
[42:48] our brothers our sisters to get what not
[42:51] to get righteousness
[42:52] not to get holiness but to get what we
[42:55] want
[42:56] and and when it's young we think it's
[42:58] cute and when it gets old we put them in
[43:00] jail
[43:04] it just it's just the way it is but god
[43:06] is calling us
[43:08] unto holiness how many can hear the
[43:11] gospel call
[43:12] unto holiness amen god is holy
[43:15] and he's calling us to be holy in all
[43:19] manner of conversations
[43:22] now those of you that think that has
[43:24] just to do about how you talk
[43:27] it's not it's about our behavior amen
[43:31] it's in everything it's all about us
[43:33] it's it's the way that we behave
[43:36] so we don't want to look at holiness as
[43:39] a
[43:40] gift given by god to just certain
[43:43] individuals that he esteems
[43:45] to be his favorites it is also not
[43:49] merited through even
[43:50] sincere works or desires or
[43:53] efforts it's
[43:57] really god's spirit living inside of us
[44:00] manifesting his holiness through us
[44:05] it's the only way we can become holy is
[44:08] have a holy god in us
[44:10] otherwise a man at his very best is what
[44:13] all vanity
[44:15] so as we yield to the call god will draw
[44:18] us
[44:19] into becoming more like him and as we
[44:22] yield ourselves to god
[44:23] we'll automatically become more holy
[44:26] because that is what he's calling us to
[44:29] it starts with a right attitude now
[44:32] notice
[44:33] a number of times in the bible the bible
[44:36] says
[44:37] that if we would when we hear the word
[44:38] if we would harden not
[44:40] our hearts it's an attitude
[44:45] there's a connection there between the
[44:48] attitude that we have
[44:49] and how will we how our heart is going
[44:52] to be
[44:53] if satan can ever get us to think that
[44:56] we're
[44:57] already holy enough or
[45:00] i'll never be holy he has
[45:04] already defeated you he has stopped you
[45:08] in your tracks
[45:10] we need a different attitude to start
[45:12] with a right attitude an attitude that
[45:15] confesses
[45:16] i will walk towards the direction that
[45:18] god is calling me to
[45:19] amen just take the first step
[45:23] the bible says draw nigh to god he'll
[45:25] draw an eye to you you you've got to
[45:28] and every one of you at one moment this
[45:31] morning
[45:32] was laying in bed and you opened your
[45:35] eyes
[45:36] and you probably wondered what time is
[45:39] it
[45:39] [Laughter]
[45:42] what time is it
[45:46] but every one of you here today had
[45:48] determined in your heart
[45:49] that i'm going to go to church
[45:53] and so you made that that decision in
[45:55] your mind i'm going to walk towards that
[45:57] so when you originally had that you
[45:59] weren't here
[46:01] number of steps had to be made right
[46:03] like i said
[46:04] a number of times the wheels had to turn
[46:07] on the road to get here
[46:09] but it started with a thought
[46:12] that i'm going to go to church and it's
[46:14] the same thing with
[46:15] becoming holy it starts with a direction
[46:18] that i'm going to become holy i'm going
[46:21] in this direction amen it's important
[46:28] if god's calling us to holiness then
[46:30] holiness is a direction
[46:32] that i'm heading towards so let's look
[46:35] at the type of attitude we need to have
[46:37] in romans
[46:38] chapter 6 verse 11.
[46:42] romans chapter 6 verse 11 likewise
[46:45] reckon
[46:46] ye your soul also yourselves to be
[46:49] dead indeed unto sin but alive
[46:52] unto god through jesus christ our lord
[46:55] so
[46:56] you we reckon ourselves
[46:59] to be dead now every one of us just
[47:00] think about this for a second every one
[47:02] of us
[47:03] sinned yesterday
[47:06] we we've sinned today perhaps in our
[47:08] thoughts
[47:10] okay so so now it's not a matter of can
[47:13] i make it to a day
[47:14] to where i can say i i i i
[47:17] i'm like god
[47:20] no we have to have the attitude that i
[47:23] am going
[47:24] to die out to the lord
[47:27] and i am going to to walk towards christ
[47:30] and be alive unto god
[47:34] so it's it's a reckoning of yourselves
[47:36] to be dead as long as we're
[47:38] as long as we're not thinking that we
[47:40] need to die out
[47:42] it's hard to get anywhere with god so we
[47:44] have to reckon ourselves
[47:46] in a position like right now you can go
[47:48] to your house right now in your mind
[47:50] and you can go into a certain room and
[47:52] you know exactly
[47:55] where the bread is at or where the trash
[47:56] can is at because you
[47:58] you you have it visualized in your head
[48:00] you you recognize it
[48:02] right and you have to reckon yourself as
[48:05] dead
[48:08] because as long as you think you're just
[48:10] wild and do everything you want
[48:12] you're going to do anything you want so
[48:14] you have to reckon yourself dead amen
[48:17] let not sin therefore reign
[48:21] in your mortal body now who's in control
[48:25] that
[48:27] you are that's why the prophet could say
[48:29] you are your greatest enemy
[48:32] let not sin therefore reign in your
[48:34] mortal body that ye
[48:35] should obey it in the lust thereof
[48:38] neither you ye your members as
[48:41] instruments of unrighteousness unto sin
[48:43] but
[48:43] yield yourselves unto god
[48:47] as those that are alive from the dead
[48:50] and your members as instruments of
[48:52] righteousness unto god
[48:54] for sin shall not have dominion
[48:57] over you for you're not under the law
[49:00] but under grace you just you confess it
[49:03] you can just as you have to confess i'm
[49:06] a believer i believe in god i believe
[49:08] that
[49:08] jesus died for me you have to confess
[49:11] sin
[49:11] is not going to have dominion over me
[49:13] you can't wait till it's gone to say it
[49:16] your children of abraham you have to say
[49:18] it before it happens
[49:21] there's something about the power that's
[49:24] behind the words that come out of your
[49:25] mouth think about this
[49:27] you you could walk into a perfect
[49:29] situation
[49:30] a perfect conversation a perfect
[49:32] atmosphere and you come in with a
[49:34] negativity
[49:35] oh me oh my and before you know it
[49:37] everything just comes down
[49:41] so your words are powerful
[49:45] and and according to uh to if you can
[49:48] put it up there and it's uh
[49:50] hebrews chapter three verse one
[49:54] it's not my notes but it came let's
[49:56] let's read that we're for holy
[49:58] brother and partakers of the heavenly
[50:00] calling
[50:01] consider the apostle high priest of our
[50:04] profession right amen
[50:08] if you profess positivity
[50:11] in your life god is going to stand
[50:15] for that but if it's negativity
[50:19] how is god going to be a high priest
[50:24] of a negative profession he can't do
[50:27] nothing
[50:29] so we must remain positive
[50:32] and we got to confess i'm not going to
[50:35] allow
[50:36] this thing in my life i'm going to work
[50:38] at getting rid of it
[50:40] i'm not under the law i don't need to
[50:43] listen to the devil
[50:44] i i i could have victory over it's
[50:47] through jesus christ who's going to give
[50:48] me a victory
[50:53] with the right attitude we can bring
[50:56] god on the scene we can begin to slice
[50:58] away the things that are in our life
[51:00] that
[51:00] we don't want there a little bit by a
[51:02] little bit i'll tell you
[51:03] it's all because of the selfish behavior
[51:08] ephesians chapter 4 verse 22
[51:12] that she put off concerning
[51:16] the former conversations
[51:20] the former conversation the old man
[51:23] which is corrupt according to his
[51:25] deceitful
[51:26] lust now every one of us that has sinned
[51:30] has been deceived
[51:34] and the devil tricks us we
[51:37] yes we should know better and
[51:40] and and and yes uh uh
[51:44] we ought to be doing better and yes
[51:46] we've done it before
[51:47] so there's another reason we but i'm
[51:49] telling you the devil
[51:51] tricks us comes from 15 different angles
[51:53] to do the same thing
[51:59] so we need to put off the former
[52:02] behavior which is corrupt according to
[52:06] deceitful lust
[52:07] and be renewed in the spirit
[52:10] of your mind and that ye put on the
[52:13] new man which after god is created
[52:16] in righteousness and true
[52:20] holiness now to put on
[52:24] now to put on i mean when i when i
[52:28] before i ever came in this message and i
[52:30] went to a church
[52:34] and they wore the robes and all this
[52:38] to me that was the representation of
[52:40] holiness on earth
[52:45] but that
[52:48] could be just an outside
[52:53] we don't know you understand
[52:56] but there is a true holiness that comes
[52:58] from the heart of man
[53:03] that's where it lies if you receive the
[53:05] holiness of god in your life
[53:06] it's not a put on it comes from the
[53:09] heart
[53:11] and and and it's it's true holiness
[53:18] notice after we recognize god is calling
[53:20] us to become more holy
[53:22] our attitude needs to to be that
[53:25] we want to put off a former
[53:29] behavior our formal behavior how we act
[53:33] so we're making a decision to go in the
[53:35] right direction
[53:37] and change the way that we think about
[53:39] things to be
[53:40] renewed in the spirit of our mind that's
[53:43] how we
[53:44] look at things like what really is holy
[53:46] is holy just
[53:47] you know that man that's standing behind
[53:49] the pulpit and he's dressed in these
[53:50] robes and we call that holy
[53:53] is that really no we got to change that
[53:55] because
[53:56] holiness is is is something that god is
[53:59] dealing with inside of every one of us
[54:03] think about this you are the temple of
[54:06] the holy ghost and god dwells in
[54:08] holy temples so he's working
[54:12] on the inside jesus on the inside
[54:14] working on the outside
[54:16] we don't we're not worried about the
[54:18] outside
[54:19] until the inside sees the holiness of
[54:23] god right
[54:28] we need to let the holy spirit teach us
[54:30] how to become more holy amen
[54:34] we're learning to put on the new man the
[54:37] bible says which
[54:38] after god is created in righteousness
[54:42] and true holiness with new goals
[54:46] new attitude new behavior new
[54:49] outlet new determination we can expect
[54:52] us to become a new man but if
[54:55] we don't change the way we think we are
[54:58] not
[54:59] going to change at all
[55:10] brother branham said the right mental
[55:12] attitude towards any divine promise of
[55:14] god will bring it to pass now divine
[55:15] promise
[55:17] well we can read and peter there where
[55:20] ad
[55:21] talks about the divine nature of god and
[55:24] and that
[55:24] add to to faith and virtue and these are
[55:27] promises that god has given us
[55:30] by these uh precious promises that we
[55:34] in we can become god's nature
[55:38] and um we need to have
[55:42] faith for these things in our life
[55:47] they're not just going to happen but
[55:50] we've got to believe for them we gotta
[55:51] have their the right mental attitude as
[55:53] the prophet said and
[55:55] uh i heard read
[55:59] a quote many years ago and i've i've
[56:01] quoted i don't have it written here but
[56:03] i believe it was
[56:04] uh uh by a man named
[56:07] james something that um the greatest
[56:10] discovery of any generation is that a
[56:12] man can alter his life by altering his
[56:14] attitude
[56:15] it starts with i believe i'm heading
[56:19] i'm going but if we're going to sit
[56:20] there and wait for feelings to change
[56:23] our our circumstances to change and
[56:26] all things around us to change before
[56:28] we're going to be moving
[56:30] in a certain direction it will never
[56:32] happen because there's a free more
[56:34] agency that god is dealing with
[56:36] and that's why i'm saying it is faith is
[56:39] simple
[56:42] you you just you step out of of you step
[56:45] out onto the water and say i'm going
[56:48] towards jesus
[56:51] as we learn to drop our selfish attitude
[56:53] and begin to look at things
[56:55] more the way that god wants us to look
[56:57] at them which is basically
[56:59] living for others right not selfish
[57:02] live for others our love will increase
[57:06] and as our love increases so were our
[57:08] holiness
[57:10] yes here's scripture first thessalonians
[57:12] chapter 3 verse 20
[57:13] verse 12. first thessalonians chapter 3
[57:16] verse 12.
[57:19] we're just pointing out certain ways to
[57:21] walk towards holiness here
[57:22] and the lord make you to increase and
[57:25] abound in love
[57:28] towards me
[57:33] towards one another
[57:37] and towards all men
[57:40] even as we do towards you
[57:43] to the end to the end now we're talking
[57:47] about the end of this
[57:48] he may establish your hearts unblameable
[57:53] in holiness before god
[57:56] even our father at the coming of our
[57:58] lord jesus christ with all saints
[58:00] so god is going to be looking for a holy
[58:03] bride
[58:05] that's what he's coming for we might as
[58:07] well put attention to it we might as
[58:09] well
[58:09] come to grips with what we need to come
[58:11] to grips with
[58:12] to become what god is
[58:16] for god is holy be he holy
[58:19] amen that's the scripture and so we need
[58:22] to dive into in our personal lives we
[58:24] need to get into the message
[58:25] and and look at where god is speaking to
[58:29] us about becoming that inside the
[58:31] message
[58:32] because a man-made church and a man way
[58:35] thinking
[58:36] in the way that god would try to
[58:39] interpret
[58:40] holiness to us is off
[58:45] we can't go by that it needs to become a
[58:48] personal revelation to us
[58:50] we cannot depend upon what's being
[58:54] preached to us to become a revelation
[58:57] now what i mean by that is we can sit in
[58:59] church
[59:00] for service after service never be in
[59:02] the spirit
[59:03] never hear what god is saying and say
[59:05] well i didn't hear that
[59:06] that's why we're not going to have any
[59:09] any quotes today from the prophet but
[59:11] we're probably going to have a service
[59:13] where we're going to talk about the
[59:14] quotes of of this just the whole thing
[59:16] but i wanted to lay a foundation
[59:18] scripturally
[59:21] that is not just coming from a man but
[59:23] this is from god
[59:24] this call to be hol to be holy is really
[59:27] from god
[59:30] and so often when we listen to
[59:34] the message our whole
[59:37] mind is already set on what we're
[59:39] looking for
[59:44] and we we are we don't just lay
[59:47] uh like the prophet said we come to
[59:50] church to find out where we're at in
[59:52] other words i don't know where we're at
[59:54] i'll be honest with you i'm i'm a a
[59:57] sheep that needs to make sure that i'm
[59:59] on the right track today
[1:00:03] and so when we listen to the tapes we're
[1:00:05] we're just looking for
[1:00:09] okay and i'm i'm not against any of that
[1:00:12] but the thing is if we're not open we're
[1:00:15] going to miss a lot of things through
[1:00:16] the tapes
[1:00:17] that god could be speaking to us about
[1:00:19] church order
[1:00:20] about how to get our lives in order and
[1:00:22] how to become more holy
[1:00:32] too often satan will try to trip up
[1:00:35] believers into thinking
[1:00:36] that since certain things have changed
[1:00:39] in their lives and that they've
[1:00:42] arrived to god's standard of holiness
[1:00:46] never feeling a need to go on to more
[1:00:49] holiness
[1:00:54] i'm doing this now i didn't used to do
[1:00:56] that i'm doing this now i didn't used to
[1:00:58] do that
[1:00:59] therefore i don't have to put much
[1:01:02] attention
[1:01:03] to holiness second corinthians chapter
[1:01:07] seven verse
[1:01:08] one tells us having therefore these
[1:01:12] promises dearly beloved let us cleanse
[1:01:14] ourselves from all filthiness of the
[1:01:17] flesh into the spirit
[1:01:18] perfecting holiness in the fear of god
[1:01:22] i have not perfected holiness
[1:01:27] has anybody the requirement is fear
[1:01:31] fear the lord i could be wrong lord show
[1:01:34] me
[1:01:35] so obviously there still is a cleansing
[1:01:39] needed because it says from all
[1:01:44] filthiness of the flesh not just the
[1:01:47] part
[1:01:48] that we that we did clean up we can
[1:01:52] testify we clean that up it's
[1:01:54] and and and we're good now well you're
[1:01:56] good now in that area
[1:01:58] right and and they god gives us that if
[1:02:02] i could say it like that
[1:02:03] but god is still calling us to be more
[1:02:06] like him
[1:02:09] now you know the army when they put you
[1:02:10] in the army they don't just set
[1:02:12] everybody down and they say
[1:02:14] look we're going to be starting boot
[1:02:16] camp here pretty soon
[1:02:18] i want you to understand is we're into
[1:02:20] this boob cup at any time
[1:02:22] that you feel that you're being pushed
[1:02:24] too much
[1:02:26] and things are a little bit too hard on
[1:02:27] you and
[1:02:29] you i just want you to raise your hand
[1:02:32] and then
[1:02:32] uh you don't have to do anything more
[1:02:34] than you feel you're capable of doing
[1:02:36] okay
[1:02:39] but see that's the way we want the
[1:02:40] gospel preached to us
[1:02:44] don't challenge me don't push me god
[1:02:48] god knows that you're his bride you just
[1:02:51] have to believe that and start walking
[1:02:53] in that
[1:02:55] not feeling this is too hard for me this
[1:02:57] is too much
[1:03:00] you've got to believe that you're going
[1:03:03] to become
[1:03:04] exactly the way god wants you to become
[1:03:07] but the thinking the attitude the heart
[1:03:10] that has to be right let's get straight
[1:03:12] with god
[1:03:16] the army they push you
[1:03:19] they push you they push you how many
[1:03:21] times have we seen
[1:03:22] somebody come out of the army they go in
[1:03:24] one way they come out of the army and
[1:03:26] they're just more
[1:03:27] they come out of the army and they still
[1:03:29] stand straight they still
[1:03:31] they still act the way they were taught
[1:03:34] a lot of them i mean maybe after a time
[1:03:36] they they go
[1:03:38] different but what i'm saying here is
[1:03:40] that
[1:03:41] god's trying to train us amen amen
[1:03:45] and he wants us to become holy in all
[1:03:47] manner of conversation he wants us
[1:03:49] to perfect us so we need the attitude of
[1:03:51] pressing
[1:03:52] towards the end result and not being
[1:03:55] satisfied
[1:03:56] at the area that you are in right now
[1:04:01] holiness is a divine calling from god
[1:04:06] it's it's for a chosen group it's it's
[1:04:10] not
[1:04:11] everybody doesn't receive it everybody
[1:04:13] that goes in the army does not become
[1:04:15] the elite
[1:04:19] they do not become special ops or green
[1:04:22] beret
[1:04:24] it's all that came out
[1:04:27] all of god's children that came out of
[1:04:29] egypt did not go into the promised land
[1:04:32] we're not
[1:04:33] chosen to go into the promised land
[1:04:35] right
[1:04:36] everybody that's called into this
[1:04:40] message and everybody that has come into
[1:04:42] the message
[1:04:43] does not go into the rapture because our
[1:04:46] prophet told us
[1:04:48] that there is a voice inside a voice
[1:04:51] there is a message inside of the message
[1:04:53] and there is a calling inside this what
[1:04:56] we're calling it's not just to a message
[1:04:58] and not just to a group it's not just
[1:05:00] i'm behind brother branham it's it's to
[1:05:03] be
[1:05:03] miss jesus so we have to go beyond the
[1:05:06] seed of comfortability-ness
[1:05:08] to making sure that there's a fear of
[1:05:10] god inside of his life
[1:05:11] i must hit the mark i must reach forth i
[1:05:14] must become all that he's called me to
[1:05:16] become
[1:05:16] amen amen
[1:05:21] first peter chapter 2 verse 9 but ye
[1:05:24] are a chosen generation
[1:05:28] a royal priesthood a
[1:05:32] holy nation you look around and think
[1:05:35] well who's
[1:05:36] who's you know what's which nation is
[1:05:38] holy which is right and
[1:05:40] we think about when we brother branson
[1:05:42] says with every
[1:05:44] nation and nationality there's a spirit
[1:05:46] behind it and
[1:05:47] and and peter's talking about that we
[1:05:50] us sitting here today we're a part of a
[1:05:54] holy nation
[1:05:55] it's separated from this world it's
[1:05:57] separated from other churches
[1:05:59] it's separated from other believers it's
[1:06:01] it's been called to god amen
[1:06:04] we're a peculiar people that's why
[1:06:07] people look at you
[1:06:08] and they say oh you're you're you're
[1:06:10] you're weird you're strange
[1:06:12] yeah i i feel uh you know i just i have
[1:06:15] a hard time connecting
[1:06:16] you know it's okay it's really okay
[1:06:20] that just showing that you're you're
[1:06:22] connected with god amen
[1:06:25] that you should show forth the praises
[1:06:28] of him that have called you out of
[1:06:30] darkness into his marvelous light
[1:06:32] praise god which in times past we're not
[1:06:35] a people
[1:06:36] but are now the people of god which have
[1:06:40] not obtained mercy but
[1:06:41] now have have obtained mercy amen and
[1:06:46] those of us who are taking this
[1:06:47] seriously
[1:06:48] i'm saying we're part of a holy nation
[1:06:51] amen
[1:06:52] keep marching keep marching because in
[1:06:54] every nation
[1:06:55] there's needs there's needs there's
[1:06:59] there's things to fulfill
[1:07:02] right we're part of god's holy nation
[1:07:07] we've got a job to do amen amen
[1:07:12] god has called us to be holy it's a
[1:07:14] divine calling
[1:07:15] it's a divine order of god it doesn't
[1:07:18] happen
[1:07:19] on its own it doesn't happen with church
[1:07:21] attendance
[1:07:22] it is something that has to be worked on
[1:07:25] in other words
[1:07:26] you have to have the attitude make the
[1:07:29] decision
[1:07:29] this is the direction i want to go lord
[1:07:32] what do you want me to do
[1:07:33] how do i do it you have to believe the
[1:07:35] word
[1:07:36] beyond feeling that you're holy you have
[1:07:39] to believe it
[1:07:42] not easy it's not as easy as for a woman
[1:07:46] to put on a dress
[1:07:48] or for a man to cut his hair i don't
[1:07:50] know if brother
[1:07:52] um brother
[1:07:55] want to call you brother ron i want to
[1:07:56] call you brother roger brother bruce i
[1:07:59] wonder if brother bruce sister don't
[1:08:00] ever remember me having long hair
[1:08:03] no no okay so but when i first came
[1:08:08] you know i had long hair
[1:08:11] and when i cut that hair and i honestly
[1:08:13] i wanted to talk to
[1:08:14] brother larry about this he's not here
[1:08:16] and i can either
[1:08:18] get his permission afterwards or you
[1:08:21] know
[1:08:22] usually don't get permission afterwards
[1:08:24] but uh
[1:08:27] but uh you know just cutting my hair
[1:08:29] didn't make me holy
[1:08:34] it didn't make me holy putting a dress
[1:08:36] on doesn't make a woman holy
[1:08:39] it's not that easy it's not about the
[1:08:41] law of following do's and don'ts
[1:08:44] it starts with a right attitude and it's
[1:08:47] walking
[1:08:48] towards god's holiness now god will tell
[1:08:51] the men to cut their hair and when he
[1:08:54] does
[1:08:55] and you do it that is god's holiness in
[1:08:58] you
[1:08:58] and you're walking towards it but that
[1:09:00] is not the the completion
[1:09:02] that's not the the the perfection that's
[1:09:05] not
[1:09:06] the um it's not the establishment of it
[1:09:09] it is just
[1:09:10] a step but it's it's how we act and
[1:09:14] how we think and what we do
[1:09:18] paul said cleansing ourselves from all
[1:09:21] filthiness of the flesh
[1:09:23] and the spirit and the spirit so if i
[1:09:26] cut my hair there's no
[1:09:27] you don't see a spirit we know there's a
[1:09:30] spirit behind it
[1:09:31] right but what about the spirit and
[1:09:34] everything else
[1:09:34] i do right that's true you know we don't
[1:09:37] see one another's spirit
[1:09:39] right it's true but we know that our
[1:09:42] spirits can become filthy
[1:09:44] right amen and we need to cleanse
[1:09:46] ourselves in other words it has to go
[1:09:48] through your
[1:09:49] gait a free more agency where you say
[1:09:51] i'm i'm done with this i'm not going to
[1:09:53] just yield to this thing i
[1:09:54] i'm going to put it away god fill me
[1:09:56] with your spirit
[1:09:58] and and that's where you are cleansing
[1:10:00] yourself from all filthiness of the
[1:10:02] flesh and the spirit perfecting
[1:10:04] holiness in the fear of god amen
[1:10:08] in the fear of god amen praise the lord
[1:10:13] first we need to recognize the calling
[1:10:15] that god is calling us to
[1:10:17] no man can come unless god calls first
[1:10:21] in other words it's not in our lost
[1:10:24] nature
[1:10:26] of a man
[1:10:29] to recognize a holy god
[1:10:34] no it takes god to knock on the door
[1:10:38] of our heart and say i am here
[1:10:41] and you are there and i'm calling you
[1:10:46] and that's what god does when we hear
[1:10:49] the word of god
[1:10:50] he speaks to our heart he he gets a hold
[1:10:53] of us
[1:10:53] and he lets us know something that we
[1:10:55] weren't thinking of that we weren't
[1:10:57] looking at and and when we see that and
[1:11:00] we respond to that
[1:11:05] i'm so grateful that it is the nature of
[1:11:07] god
[1:11:09] to knock on the children of his his
[1:11:12] his his lost children that are out of
[1:11:14] the way and to get him
[1:11:16] back in line because it's not in my
[1:11:19] human nature
[1:11:20] to go help anybody
[1:11:24] i know my human nature is to live for
[1:11:26] myself
[1:11:27] to lust after myself to give me
[1:11:29] everything i want for myself
[1:11:32] because that's who i was before i came
[1:11:34] to christ
[1:11:36] and i know even since then satan wants
[1:11:38] to get in there
[1:11:40] but that's why the nature of god is
[1:11:42] always to look
[1:11:44] for those who are lost and to get them
[1:11:46] back
[1:11:48] god is calling us to holiness
[1:11:52] there's something inside of the child of
[1:11:53] god that when he hears the call
[1:11:55] and he responds as jesus said in john
[1:11:58] chapter 10 verse 27
[1:12:00] my sheep hear my voice
[1:12:04] i know them and what happens when they
[1:12:06] leave the church
[1:12:08] they follow me
[1:12:13] god is not calling us here to church
[1:12:15] attendance
[1:12:18] just no he's calling us to follow him
[1:12:21] every day every step of the way
[1:12:25] and when we hear god calling us to
[1:12:27] holiness
[1:12:28] we respond yes lord i will i will i will
[1:12:31] now he's dealing with every one of us
[1:12:33] in different areas
[1:12:37] just respond to the call
[1:12:42] stay away from i'm there
[1:12:47] stay away from i can't i don't got this
[1:12:50] straight stay away from both of those
[1:12:52] ends
[1:12:54] both of them are not with humility
[1:12:58] we come right down the middle say lord
[1:13:02] not my will thy will be done i believe
[1:13:05] i'm a believer we as god's children
[1:13:09] respond to god's call
[1:13:11] on to holiness now that god has got our
[1:13:14] attention we begin
[1:13:16] he begins to unveil himself to us that
[1:13:18] he is righteous
[1:13:20] and holy and as he unveils himself we
[1:13:22] begin to identify
[1:13:24] that's what we're supposed to become
[1:13:27] that's the reason that he unveils
[1:13:30] himself
[1:13:33] think about when he made man in his own
[1:13:35] image he didn't make him a selfish man
[1:13:38] a selfish nature
[1:13:42] he did that which god
[1:13:46] orchestrated him to do
[1:13:49] amen he made him a holy man he was holy
[1:13:53] and that's what god's calling us to now
[1:13:55] this is this to me
[1:13:57] this is why this age here is the hardest
[1:13:59] age of all ages
[1:14:01] because this is the age that we have
[1:14:04] so much more to satisfy us
[1:14:09] so much more that we can enjoy so much
[1:14:12] more that we can
[1:14:13] we can get satisfaction from
[1:14:16] the first time in even in the
[1:14:20] prophet's age he he
[1:14:23] did not have the world at his fingertips
[1:14:26] in a foam
[1:14:30] i'm i don't know if he he saw it or not
[1:14:33] but it doesn't make a difference
[1:14:34] i'm telling you it's much harder today
[1:14:37] than when he walked
[1:14:40] we have to defy so much of the flesh
[1:14:43] to become holy and the devil says go
[1:14:46] over here
[1:14:47] enjoy this enjoy that do this do that
[1:14:50] there's nothing wrong with this
[1:14:51] and before you know it we're so consumed
[1:14:54] with the things of the world that we're
[1:14:56] forgetting what we're being called to
[1:15:06] as god unveils his holiness to each of
[1:15:09] us
[1:15:10] he's magnifying his holiness
[1:15:14] just how pure he is how clean
[1:15:18] how true how right how powerful how
[1:15:20] mighty
[1:15:21] this is what's happening when god is
[1:15:24] unveiling
[1:15:24] his holiness he's opening our eyes
[1:15:28] to what he already is
[1:15:33] we may be able to say with no problem
[1:15:36] god is holy but what does that mean
[1:15:39] what does that mean people in
[1:15:42] denominations could go to church and say
[1:15:45] he's holy
[1:15:48] every car every
[1:15:52] church saying holy holy holy
[1:15:56] but what does that really mean
[1:16:00] i mean the very thought process of of
[1:16:03] some
[1:16:04] uh church or some denominations they
[1:16:07] they put people up on pedestals
[1:16:11] statutes they they make them
[1:16:14] higher and uh cannot attain
[1:16:18] where jesus he just said i'm the
[1:16:20] firstborn among many brethren
[1:16:25] what i am you are become you're going to
[1:16:26] become you've been predestinated to
[1:16:28] become what i am
[1:16:29] right amen the very
[1:16:33] presence of his holy word
[1:16:37] is sharper than a two-edged sword amen
[1:16:40] that's what we enter into when we come
[1:16:42] into this church
[1:16:44] hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 says for the
[1:16:47] word of god
[1:16:48] is quick and powerful
[1:16:52] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[1:16:56] piercing even to the dividing asunder
[1:16:59] of our soul and our spirit
[1:17:02] and of the joints and the very moral and
[1:17:05] solar bones
[1:17:06] and it is a discerner of the thoughts
[1:17:09] and the intents of our heart right now
[1:17:12] i'm gonna tell you what all that make
[1:17:14] you do when you step into church
[1:17:18] you're stepping into the presence of the
[1:17:20] word
[1:17:22] and it's going to go to work
[1:17:26] look at verse 13 neither is there any
[1:17:30] neither is there any creature that is
[1:17:32] not
[1:17:33] manifest in his sight
[1:17:37] but all things are naked
[1:17:40] and open unto the eyes of him with whom
[1:17:44] we have to do how many has to do with
[1:17:46] god here today that's why you're here
[1:17:48] today
[1:17:48] because you have something to do with
[1:17:50] god amen
[1:17:51] now we're all wearing clothes for the
[1:17:53] obvious reasons because
[1:17:55] we want to cover ourselves rightly so
[1:17:58] but understand that god sees every
[1:18:01] single
[1:18:02] thing that we've ever done he
[1:18:05] sees where we're at he knows our
[1:18:07] thoughts
[1:18:08] he knows what we've been thinking it
[1:18:10] ain't some santa claus
[1:18:13] ain't some santa claus song he knows if
[1:18:16] you've been naughty or nice
[1:18:19] but when we come into his presence
[1:18:22] his word views us naked and
[1:18:26] open before him and we know he
[1:18:29] he knows everything about us how should
[1:18:32] that make you feel when you come
[1:18:33] and you sit in the presence of almighty
[1:18:35] god in the seats that you're sitting in
[1:18:39] this isn't some man-made religion when
[1:18:42] we talk but we
[1:18:43] give our thoughts and our opinions about
[1:18:44] who god is or
[1:18:46] what he is we're coming in in the living
[1:18:48] presence of almighty god
[1:18:54] walking into the presence of god all and
[1:18:56] make every one of us
[1:18:59] at all with god tremble at his presence
[1:19:04] just knowing we're naked just knowing he
[1:19:06] knows our thoughts he knows how
[1:19:08] upset i got yesterday he knows what i
[1:19:09] was thinking about this brother he knows
[1:19:20] because we don't want to think about
[1:19:22] something when we come to church it
[1:19:23] doesn't mean god's not thinking about it
[1:19:27] there's been many times that the word of
[1:19:29] god has discerned
[1:19:30] our thoughts and even made
[1:19:33] known the intents of our hearts
[1:19:37] yes especially
[1:19:40] when we didn't even know ourselves
[1:19:47] if you ever think about it
[1:19:51] we all think we got great intents
[1:19:57] and the god part
[1:20:00] inside of us the inner man the man
[1:20:04] that's
[1:20:04] created after his own image certainly
[1:20:07] does
[1:20:10] but unfortunately we're in this body
[1:20:12] which is not our
[1:20:15] yes our theophany our theophany body
[1:20:19] which is subject to selfishness
[1:20:23] subject to wrong intents
[1:20:27] but yet because we're a christian we
[1:20:30] think everything that we're doing is
[1:20:32] okay
[1:20:33] we come into the into the presence of
[1:20:36] the word and the word
[1:20:37] begins to speak to us and pull out
[1:20:39] things that we weren't even thinking
[1:20:41] about
[1:20:43] what is that that's not the preacher
[1:20:47] that's god that's god how many times
[1:20:50] have we experienced this
[1:20:55] did you tell the pastor that thing
[1:20:58] right i've had so many testimonies of
[1:21:02] people
[1:21:03] did you tell
[1:21:07] that's why i like knowing nothing i i
[1:21:11] love being able to say i don't know what
[1:21:13] you're talking about right
[1:21:14] but god does we don't come here to find
[1:21:18] out
[1:21:19] what you know brother john is going to
[1:21:21] discern
[1:21:22] about somebody's heart that is so
[1:21:25] ridiculous
[1:21:26] people get off on that we ought to be
[1:21:30] here in the reverence and respect
[1:21:32] the holiness of an almighty god that is
[1:21:34] concerned about your holiness
[1:21:43] according to isaiah chapter 6 when you
[1:21:45] enter the presence of the lord
[1:21:48] you're in awe that all
[1:21:52] is an overwhelming feeling
[1:21:55] of reverence fear
[1:21:58] adoration
[1:22:01] why because you're standing in the
[1:22:03] presence of the most
[1:22:04] powerful the most powerful
[1:22:09] the most powerful power that there is in
[1:22:12] existence you're standing in it
[1:22:13] it is this presence that created
[1:22:16] everything that you see
[1:22:19] everything that you've ever experienced
[1:22:23] every picture you looked at every
[1:22:26] every wild kingdom every animal
[1:22:29] everything that you
[1:22:30] wow that's amazing you're standing in
[1:22:33] the presence
[1:22:34] of that being
[1:22:38] it'll make you tremble i can't create
[1:22:40] anything
[1:22:41] i can't create anything except a bunch
[1:22:43] of confusion
[1:22:46] i can't create things up a mess
[1:22:50] but this god knows how to take our
[1:22:52] messes
[1:22:53] and he knows how to put him in order
[1:22:55] we're standing in the presence of god
[1:22:58] it ought to put such a fear in us we
[1:23:01] ought to be grabbing our seats
[1:23:02] we ought to be making sure that god am i
[1:23:05] pleasing
[1:23:06] to you amen
[1:23:10] because that's what happened isaiah
[1:23:15] standing in the presence of a god
[1:23:18] that not only knows
[1:23:25] your thoughts
[1:23:28] not only what you did but what you're
[1:23:31] going to do
[1:23:34] he knows the day you'll take your last
[1:23:36] breath
[1:23:38] amen he knows the very hour the very
[1:23:41] moment
[1:23:41] that you will breathe in on your own the
[1:23:43] last breath
[1:23:45] that you will ever breathe
[1:23:48] he knows the very moment your heart
[1:23:52] will beat the last time it will beat and
[1:23:55] you are standing
[1:23:56] in the presence of that being when you
[1:23:58] come to church
[1:24:02] yeah we just don't think about it like
[1:24:04] that we
[1:24:05] we make we have made church someplace we
[1:24:07] come to gather some
[1:24:08] information that will maybe help us in
[1:24:11] life
[1:24:11] but that's not it we're standing in the
[1:24:14] presence of god
[1:24:16] we ought to be at all it'll make us
[1:24:18] tremble
[1:24:20] brother john you're kind of getting
[1:24:21] beside yourself aren't you
[1:24:27] aren't you like pushing this preaching a
[1:24:29] little bit too far
[1:24:31] but you know you're making me feel a
[1:24:32] little uncomfortable
[1:24:37] the most powerful presence
[1:24:41] what it ought to make a person do
[1:24:45] it ought to make us feel undone
[1:24:49] unworthy unclean
[1:24:53] unable to speak a word of utterance
[1:24:56] against another person amen
[1:24:59] unable to criticize anyone
[1:25:02] why because no one can compare
[1:25:06] with the holy ghost no one can compare
[1:25:09] with almighty god this holy god that
[1:25:12] you're standing
[1:25:13] in the presence of and this god is
[1:25:15] saying vengeance
[1:25:16] is mine saith the lord i will repay
[1:25:20] this presence is saying judge not that
[1:25:22] ye be not judged
[1:25:23] for with what judgment you judge
[1:25:25] somebody i'm gonna use that same thing
[1:25:27] on you
[1:25:30] may not be the same boat that you stole
[1:25:35] or the same five dollars stored out of
[1:25:38] your brother's wallet
[1:25:41] but god will take that same judgment
[1:25:45] and judge you with the same amount of
[1:25:49] mercy
[1:25:50] the same amount of grace of course when
[1:25:52] you judge somebody
[1:25:53] did you know there is no mercy
[1:25:59] you know you came over my house you
[1:26:00] stole that tie
[1:26:03] that was wrong you're gonna pay now tell
[1:26:05] me what mercy's in there
[1:26:10] mercy is you took that tie for me that
[1:26:13] wasn't right
[1:26:14] but you know i want you to have it just
[1:26:16] don't do it no more
[1:26:18] that's mercy you don't say you didn't
[1:26:21] steal the tie
[1:26:23] you just handle it differently
[1:26:26] and when you start handling things that
[1:26:28] people deserve judgment
[1:26:30] right that's good god's going to look at
[1:26:33] you in that same way because think on
[1:26:34] the white throne judgment
[1:26:36] is there mercy on that day
[1:26:40] how the tree falls that's the way it
[1:26:42] lies
[1:26:44] today is our day
[1:26:48] he is on the throne of mercy today
[1:26:52] but one day
[1:26:58] we ought to be in awe when we come into
[1:27:00] church
[1:27:01] it all be we ought to be more serious
[1:27:03] about it
[1:27:04] not just not paying attention thinking
[1:27:07] about this thinking about what
[1:27:08] hoping you know this and no
[1:27:12] stand attention god is here he's
[1:27:14] speaking
[1:27:16] he wants to deal with us because he's
[1:27:19] calling us
[1:27:20] he's sending a call out to be holy
[1:27:24] and as we recognize him as being holy
[1:27:27] we will become holy
[1:27:34] if you will humble yourself in the
[1:27:36] presence of god
[1:27:37] he will clean you up so you can become
[1:27:40] closer to him
[1:27:42] yes he'll take a coal
[1:27:46] off the fire just like he did for isaiah
[1:27:48] and he will sanctify
[1:27:50] his life for service he'll sanctify
[1:27:53] our lives for service a more holiness
[1:28:00] come on now god is holy
[1:28:03] he's calling us to be holy the presence
[1:28:06] the very presence of god's holiness
[1:28:09] will make you more holy
[1:28:14] now the thing is in other words god did
[1:28:18] not
[1:28:18] allow isaiah to do
[1:28:21] anything that was undone anything that
[1:28:25] was filthy anything that was unclean
[1:28:27] because he was the one that confessed i
[1:28:28] am undone i'm not clean i'm not uh i i
[1:28:31] do all monks unclean i don't
[1:28:32] i i'm in a nation of uncleanness and i
[1:28:35] just stepped into
[1:28:37] a presence of holiness and god would not
[1:28:40] allow
[1:28:41] that uncleanness of that world to come
[1:28:43] into his presence
[1:28:46] so just being there in the presence of a
[1:28:48] holy god
[1:28:51] yielding his is on
[1:28:54] unworthiness to be in this presence
[1:28:59] it allowed god to take the coal off the
[1:29:02] fire
[1:29:03] touch his life and change it it became
[1:29:05] more holy
[1:29:06] and that's the way it happens but you
[1:29:08] know people can come and sit in church
[1:29:10] brother branham said they could be
[1:29:12] hearing discernment going by and the
[1:29:14] angel the pillar of fire and the angel
[1:29:16] of the lords there and they're sitting
[1:29:18] there chopping on their
[1:29:19] bubble gum joking around
[1:29:23] not recognizing the presence of god it
[1:29:26] don't have to be visible
[1:29:28] there is angels that are camp round
[1:29:30] about this place
[1:29:32] that's that fear the lord if you
[1:29:35] reverence
[1:29:35] respect the angels of god's camp
[1:29:38] around you and they're here
[1:29:43] amen we can't come into this room
[1:29:47] i'll tell you what i like to do sometime
[1:29:49] i like to come to church and everybody
[1:29:50] have blind folders on
[1:29:55] forget about looking at brother john
[1:30:00] forget about with these eyes trying to
[1:30:02] visualize because
[1:30:04] we need to close our eyes and we need to
[1:30:08] recognize that god's presence is here
[1:30:10] amen it's outside of this body called
[1:30:14] john martin
[1:30:15] amen that's why we can't look at this
[1:30:18] body
[1:30:18] it's the living word that's going forth
[1:30:21] it's what changes our life
[1:30:26] psalms 99 time is running out we're not
[1:30:28] about to get everything i want to
[1:30:31] as usual it's kind of a usual thing
[1:30:35] psalms 99 think that the situation that
[1:30:40] experience that wonderful experience
[1:30:41] that isaiah had there in chapter 6
[1:30:44] is not isolated it's the way it needs to
[1:30:47] be here in this church
[1:30:49] but it's not something that just is
[1:30:51] physically laid out
[1:30:53] it's in the spiritual realm
[1:30:57] it wasn't it wasn't god
[1:31:01] coming down in his whole heaven coming
[1:31:04] down
[1:31:05] to a natural isaiah isaiah was lifted up
[1:31:11] and recognized something's out of place
[1:31:13] here i know
[1:31:14] this is not what i'm used to
[1:31:18] this is we have to recognize god's
[1:31:20] presence this is the part that you play
[1:31:22] you cannot depend on the music you
[1:31:24] cannot depend on the preacher
[1:31:25] you cannot depend on your feelings you
[1:31:28] need to enter into this place with a
[1:31:29] visualization
[1:31:31] with faith that you're going to meet god
[1:31:32] that god is here his presence is here
[1:31:34] and you're entering into it and it can't
[1:31:36] be any other way
[1:31:38] that's why you could you know two people
[1:31:39] could be sitting in church they walk out
[1:31:42] and one of them says oh he called me a
[1:31:44] buzzard and the other one says oh is
[1:31:45] that right well he called me an eagle
[1:31:49] same server same message
[1:31:52] what we're paying attention to what
[1:31:54] we're connected with
[1:31:55] there's so much more we could be getting
[1:31:57] out of those services if we can enter in
[1:31:59] to the spirit of christ and not
[1:32:02] depending on trying to receive from
[1:32:03] christ in the flesh
[1:32:07] verse 1 of psalms 99 the lord reigneth
[1:32:11] let the people trample
[1:32:16] not the angels not isaiah
[1:32:21] who reigns in your life who reigns in
[1:32:24] your life
[1:32:29] that means take from the state where
[1:32:31] you're at to go in the state of
[1:32:34] god he's here
[1:32:38] can you do that
[1:32:41] can you have a heart and a desire and a
[1:32:44] will
[1:32:44] and a do you are you willing to believe
[1:32:48] that god's presence is that real that it
[1:32:50] can make you trouble and i know this
[1:32:52] i've been in the presence of god
[1:32:54] where i have trembled amen
[1:32:59] and i understand i understand this
[1:33:02] you can't manufacture a thing
[1:33:06] you cannot manufacture the presence of
[1:33:09] god
[1:33:10] but we had a prophet come by and said if
[1:33:12] you meet the same requirements that
[1:33:14] somebody else said god is duty-bound
[1:33:16] to give you the same thing that he gave
[1:33:18] that person and if we humble ourselves
[1:33:20] in the sight of the lord he will lift us
[1:33:22] up
[1:33:26] but if we're already coming in his
[1:33:27] church lift it up
[1:33:30] kind of looking down
[1:33:34] we the people need to tremble
[1:33:38] the people need the tremble let the
[1:33:41] people
[1:33:41] tremble he sitteth between the
[1:33:44] cherubians
[1:33:46] let the earth be moved right
[1:33:50] well the nation that we live on
[1:33:53] they're not even thinking about a holy
[1:33:56] nation
[1:33:58] thinking about the throne of god they're
[1:34:00] not thinking about trembling
[1:34:02] in fact they'll do everything they can
[1:34:04] to deceive to cheat to
[1:34:05] to conquer to manipulate
[1:34:11] but you know god has called us to
[1:34:14] another kingdom
[1:34:15] that cannot be moved the lord
[1:34:19] is great in zion and he is high above
[1:34:23] all the people
[1:34:26] remember isaiah saw him high and lifted
[1:34:30] up
[1:34:32] let them praise thy great
[1:34:36] and terrible name for he
[1:34:39] is holy
[1:34:43] we have a responsibility when we come to
[1:34:45] church
[1:34:47] praise the name of the lord right amen
[1:34:52] the king strength also loveth
[1:34:56] judgment
[1:34:59] yes i do believe god wants me
[1:35:01] straightened up
[1:35:02] as much as i want to say oh lord look at
[1:35:05] this
[1:35:06] oh lord look at that god says no i'm not
[1:35:09] looking at that i'm looking at what i
[1:35:10] want you to do
[1:35:14] not where you're at it's where you need
[1:35:15] to get to
[1:35:19] oh we were sitting there men's man i
[1:35:20] hope this is okay brother mike was
[1:35:22] was sharing with us when he had come to
[1:35:25] church he got
[1:35:26] into when he came back to church and uh
[1:35:30] not when he came back but i think maybe
[1:35:32] maybe it was when he came back i can't
[1:35:33] remember it was the first time or when
[1:35:34] it was that you came but
[1:35:35] he came into churches kind of slum had a
[1:35:37] hoodie on just
[1:35:38] kind of you know whatever and the lord
[1:35:41] spoke to him
[1:35:43] and said i've called you to a higher
[1:35:46] standard than what you think
[1:35:52] and it got a hold of his attention and
[1:35:55] if we could realize
[1:35:56] that we don't got god all sold up
[1:36:00] that he's calling us higher and he he
[1:36:03] the bible says that the king's strength
[1:36:05] also loveth
[1:36:06] judgment thou dost establish
[1:36:11] equity equity
[1:36:14] in other words god wants to make all of
[1:36:17] us
[1:36:18] just like him amen that's what that
[1:36:21] means
[1:36:22] not what the world wants to give
[1:36:23] everybody is rob from the rich and
[1:36:26] you know pay for the poor not that type
[1:36:27] of thing not socialism god isn't into
[1:36:30] that
[1:36:32] but he wants to all of us to become like
[1:36:34] him
[1:36:37] he wants to establish that thou execute
[1:36:39] his judgment

[1:39:04] a lot of times we want to come in
[1:39:06] to church and we just want to feel good
[1:39:08] right
[1:39:09] we just want to just we always you know
[1:39:11] we just want to sing a song that makes
[1:39:13] us feel good
[1:39:15] and i am never ever ever i'm never
[1:39:18] against that
[1:39:20] but there needs to be some fear and
[1:39:22] trembling somewhere in the presence of
[1:39:24] god
[1:39:25] there needs to be there needs to be that
[1:39:28] respect
[1:39:30] you know god is not just someone
[1:39:35] who meets all of our needs i'm sorry
[1:39:37] he's just not that that is called an
[1:39:39] errand boy
[1:39:41] that's more of a santa claus type
[1:39:43] thinking yeah
[1:39:44] but god is our husband
[1:39:49] god is our husband you tell me one man
[1:39:52] on the planet
[1:39:53] that never ever ever wanted his wife to
[1:39:56] do anything
[1:39:59] exactly
[1:40:04] because woman was made for man we came
[1:40:07] out from god
[1:40:09] we're going back to god he is our head
[1:40:12] and he has a lot more say over us than
[1:40:13] we do him
[1:40:17] amen but the world has gotten to a place
[1:40:20] where the women were in the pants
[1:40:23] the women are calling the shots the
[1:40:25] women are an authority in our government
[1:40:27] there is a spirit that brother adam saw
[1:40:29] coming on this nation right before it
[1:40:31] was destroyed it wasn't a good spirit it
[1:40:33] was a spirit of
[1:40:34] of a woman dominating
[1:40:38] amen we as the church don't dominate god
[1:40:41] we don't tell god how things are going
[1:40:43] to be here
[1:40:44] we we're not of the church that has
[1:40:45] kicked god out
[1:40:47] we don't want god on the outside
[1:40:49] knocking to get back in
[1:40:52] we're a holy nation we recognize his
[1:40:55] presence in this place
[1:40:57] when we're driving towards church we
[1:40:59] know what we're driving towards amen
[1:41:01] we know what's going to happen when he
[1:41:03] gets there we're going to come into
[1:41:04] god's presence and we're going to shake
[1:41:06] we're going to tremble and we're going
[1:41:07] to fear before the
[1:41:08] before god because we're standing in the
[1:41:11] presence of almighty god
[1:41:14] and as we stand there what happens we
[1:41:17] become
[1:41:19] more holy because he's calling us to
[1:41:22] what he is
[1:41:23] yes he's called us to be holy
[1:41:27] how many will answer that call and say
[1:41:29] amen let's stand together
[1:41:43] he which have called you as holy so be
[1:41:46] ye
[1:41:46] holy in all manner
[1:41:50] of behavior i don't think it'd be very
[1:41:52] hard for any of us to look back
[1:41:54] and see some behavior in our life
[1:41:58] that wasn't as holy as it should have
[1:42:00] been
[1:42:02] so he's calling us from where we're at
[1:42:06] to where he wants us to go now we can
[1:42:08] have two choices
[1:42:10] we can have the choice of hey we're
[1:42:13] human
[1:42:14] and it's always going to be there or we
[1:42:17] can have the choice of
[1:42:19] he's he's called me to be more like him
[1:42:23] and that attitude will make the
[1:42:24] difference of what you will become just
[1:42:26] that attitude
[1:42:28] amen amen let's
