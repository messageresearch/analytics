[0:02] lots of stuff.
[0:05] But he is our peace, the Bible says. And
[0:08] God bless you this evening. It's good to
[0:10] be in the house of the Lord. How is the
[0:12] temperature feeling with everybody?
[0:14] Okay. Okay.
[0:17] And who doesn't want to speak? I mean,
[0:20] everything's okay because Oh, we got one
[0:24] cold. I I turned it I turned it to
[0:27] become a little bit warmer because I
[0:29] kind of felt that too.
[0:31] And uh
[0:35] this is the time to speak. You're not
[0:37] going to get in trouble today.
[0:43] So we just uh are going to warm it up a
[0:45] little bit here. Turn with me if you
[0:47] would to the book of Psalms 91. And I
[0:51] believe brother Daniel had touched on
[0:54] these scriptures and as he was reading
[0:56] something just touched my heart and I
[0:59] want to be I would like to speak today
[1:01] on uh beholding our salvation. Beholding
[1:06] our salvation title this beholding your
[1:08] salvation and get our our um
[1:12] our our our
[1:14] thought here in the book of Psalms 91.
[1:18] We're going to begin reading with verse
[1:20] 14- 16 and have a word of prayer.
[1:24] The Bible tells us because he
[1:28] representing us has set his love upon
[1:33] me. So we've set our love upon God.
[1:36] Therefore God says will I deliver him. I
[1:40] will set him on high because he have
[1:43] known my name. He shall call upon me
[1:46] because he's in trouble now. And this
[1:49] this understand this this is coming from
[1:52] being in the secret place. Uh making God
[1:56] um his portion, his refuge.
[2:00] And this is the process to get
[2:02] salvation. He shall call upon me. I will
[2:05] answer him. I will be with him in
[2:07] trouble. I will deliver him and I will
[2:09] honor him. and with long life I will
[2:11] satisfy him and show him my salvation.
[2:15] Now notice he didn't say I'll show him
[2:17] my salvation and give him long life. But
[2:20] the scripture says I with long life I
[2:23] will satisfy him and show him my
[2:26] salvation.
[2:28] Amen. Let's just bow in a word of
[2:29] prayer. Our heavenly father, thank you
[2:31] today,
[2:33] Lord, that you have provided a place
[2:38] that we could just come and be sheltered
[2:40] from the heat as it were and a place
[2:43] that we could gather together as
[2:45] brothers and sisters in Christ and
[2:47] cherish um the love of God and in one
[2:50] another that you we're family. You've
[2:52] called us out of sin. You've called us
[2:55] into your the kingdom of your dear son
[2:57] as the Bible says. And today we could
[3:01] come and just rejoice and worship you
[3:04] and and now Lord to receive of the word
[3:07] of God that is able uh to save us as the
[3:12] Bible says. And we pray that this word
[3:15] would become uh quicken to us that we
[3:17] might be able to glean something uh Lord
[3:21] through the word that would help us with
[3:22] all of our troubles with all of our
[3:25] needs and all the things that we have
[3:26] need of and being saved from today.
[3:30] God will give you the praise for this as
[3:31] we commit the service into your hand
[3:34] every soul believing now in Jesus
[3:37] Christ's precious name. Amen. And God
[3:39] bless you. May be seated.
[3:43] I believe God wants to show us his
[3:45] salvation every day.
[3:48] It's not just something at the
[3:50] beginning, but I believe God wants to
[3:53] show us how great he is every single day
[3:55] and to save us from our our situations,
[3:57] our troubles, whatever our prayer
[3:59] request is. I believe God wants to to be
[4:02] the one that's showing off. He's able to
[4:05] do exceedingly above all that we would
[4:07] ask or think. He's a present help in a
[4:09] time of trouble. that God is there and
[4:12] he wants to help us and he wants to show
[4:14] us that. But we have to we have to call
[4:17] upon him in the same way that we did for
[4:20] salvation.
[4:22] You understand what I'm saying? It was
[4:24] desperate.
[4:25] When we needed salvation, we called upon
[4:28] God in a in a state of desperation and
[4:31] God responded. And that's what the
[4:32] scripture says here. He shall call upon
[4:34] me and I will answer him and I will be
[4:36] with him in trouble and I will deliver
[4:38] him and and honor him. So we see that
[4:42] God is there ready to do his part if we
[4:45] do our part. What is our part? Set our
[4:48] love upon him, call upon him and believe
[4:50] that he's a God that can save us in our
[4:53] situation, whatever it is. And we we we
[4:55] see the request that has come forth. We
[4:57] we serve a God that gets us out of
[5:00] trouble.
[5:02] He he he he can take a disaster and make
[5:05] all things beautiful in his time. Our
[5:07] God is a great God. He just is not a God
[5:10] of the past that that just divided the
[5:12] Red Sea, but he's a God a present tense
[5:16] God.
[5:17] Let's go to 2 Chronicles chapter 20 and
[5:21] take a look here at uh Jehoshaphat's
[5:24] prayer
[5:26] um in in a situation. and he was in a
[5:29] pickle and he had countries coming
[5:31] against him and he needed uh to be
[5:34] saved. He needed the salvation of God
[5:37] coming because he was in a situation
[5:39] that he himself they could not uh win
[5:42] without God. And God usually puts us in
[5:45] situations that we can't win without
[5:47] him. He's just that way.
[5:50] He he wants us to look to him and and
[5:53] trust him. And he he makes prepared
[5:55] situations like that. Let's start with
[5:57] verse one of 2 Chronicles chapter 20.
[6:00] And it came to pass after this also that
[6:02] the children of Moab and the children of
[6:04] Ammon. And with them others beside the
[6:07] Amorites came against Jehoshaphat to
[6:10] battle. Um then there came some that
[6:14] told Jehoshaphat, saying, There cometh a
[6:17] great multitude against thee from beyond
[6:20] the sea on the this side of Syria, and
[6:23] behold, they be in Hezantamar,
[6:30] which is Ended.
[6:34] And Jehoshaphat feared
[6:37] and set himself to seek the Lord. Now,
[6:39] isn't that the the thing to do right
[6:41] there when you're in a pickle? You're
[6:43] afraid, but what do you do? You set your
[6:47] heart towards the Lord. You set your
[6:49] love upon him. You go to the source. He
[6:52] is our peace. Right? We come to Christ
[6:55] for the answers. Amen. And Joseph feared
[6:58] and set his uh set himself to seek the
[7:00] Lord and proclaimed a fast throughout
[7:02] Judah. and Judah gathered themselves
[7:04] together to ask help of the Lord even
[7:07] out of all the cities of uh Judah. They
[7:11] came to seek the Lord. And Jehoshaphat
[7:13] stood in the congregation of Judah and
[7:16] Jerusalem in the house of the Lord
[7:18] before the new court and said, "Oh
[7:21] Lord," this is how we need to pray in
[7:24] our pickle. "Oh Lord, God of our
[7:28] fathers, art now thou the God in
[7:31] heaven?" He wants to be reminded. A lot
[7:33] of times we forget, right? And God God
[7:37] puts us in a situation where we're
[7:39] forced to look at him instead of just
[7:42] trying to handle life with oursel
[7:45] and rulest not thou over all the
[7:48] kingdoms of the heathen and in thine
[7:51] hand. Is there not power and might so
[7:53] that none is able to withstand thee? I'm
[7:56] I'm just reminding you, Lord. Are you
[7:58] not this God that's capable? Right. Art
[8:01] not thou the God who didest drive uh
[8:05] drive out the habitants of the land
[8:07] before the people uh Israel before thy
[8:11] people Israel and gavest it to the seed
[8:14] of Abraham and thy friend forever. and
[8:18] they dwelt therein have built thee a
[8:22] sanctuary therein for thy name saying if
[8:25] when evil cometh upon us as the sword
[8:28] judgment or pestilence famine we stand
[8:31] before this house and in thy presence
[8:35] for thy name is in this house and cry
[8:38] unto thee in our affliction
[8:42] then thou will hear and help amen I mean
[8:45] it's just quite simple here's the
[8:47] problem. Here's the solution. This is
[8:49] how we get there.
[8:52] Follow the instructions. Amen. Doesn't
[8:55] matter what the problem is. Right.
[8:57] Doesn't matter. Amen. The situation that
[9:00] we're dealing with, I believe with all
[9:02] my heart, if we do what what what the
[9:06] Bible says, we'll get the same results
[9:08] because God's no respector of persons.
[9:11] And now behold the children of Ammon and
[9:14] Moab and the mount Sierra whom thou
[9:18] wouldest not let Israel invade when they
[9:22] came out of the land of Egypt. But they
[9:24] turned from them and destroyed them not.
[9:28] Behold, I say, how they reward us to
[9:31] come to cast us out of thy possession
[9:35] which thou has given us to inherit. Oh
[9:39] our God, will thou not judge them? For
[9:42] we have we have no might against this
[9:45] great company that cometh against us,
[9:48] neither know we what to do, but our eyes
[9:51] are on the I think it's just so
[9:53] beautiful. I don't have to have all the
[9:55] answers to know what to do.
[9:58] God doesn't want us to have the answers.
[10:01] He just wants us to come to him, be
[10:02] honest. I don't know what to do here,
[10:05] but I'm looking to you, Lord.
[10:07] I'm going to put my trust in you and
[10:10] you're going to you're you're you're
[10:11] going to do what you've always done,
[10:13] which you never let us down.
[10:25] We're in verse 13. Okay. A and all Judah
[10:30] stood before the Lord with their little
[10:32] ones, their wives, and their children.
[10:36] Then upon Jahazio the son of Zachariah
[10:41] the son of Beniah the son of Jewel the
[10:45] son of Mahhatania a Levite and I'm sorry
[10:50] that I don't pronounce these perfect the
[10:52] sons of Asf
[10:54] came the spirit of the Lord in the midst
[10:57] of the congregation
[10:59] and
[11:01] and the spirit of the Lord said hearken
[11:04] ye all Judah Judah and the inhabitants
[11:07] of Jerusalem.
[11:09] And thou, King of Jehoshaphat, thus
[11:12] sayeth the Lord unto you, be not afraid,
[11:15] nor dismayed by reason of this great
[11:19] multitude that you just told me about.
[11:23] For the battle is not yours, but God's.
[11:29] What a if we could just have a
[11:30] revelation of that thing right there
[11:33] that this problem that I have, God's
[11:36] going to take care of it. Cast your
[11:39] cares upon it. He care it for you.
[11:42] God does not want us to engage in the
[11:45] battle as if we literally ourselves have
[11:48] to tackle it.
[11:51] He doesn't want that. He wants all of
[11:54] our effort to be put into trusting him,
[11:56] to having faith in God, to believing
[11:59] that he's the mighty conqueror.
[12:04] Amen.
[12:06] For the battle is not yours, but God's.
[12:09] Tomorrow
[12:11] go you down against them. Isn't that
[12:13] something? The the battle is not yours,
[12:17] but God's, but you're going to go down
[12:18] against them. We're going to get into
[12:21] this a little bit.
[12:23] Behold, they come up by the cliff of
[12:26] Ziz, and ye shall find them at the end
[12:30] of the brook before the wilderness of
[12:32] Jewel Giru.
[12:35] Ye shall not need to fight in this
[12:37] battle, but but you need to go down
[12:40] against them. Right.
[12:42] Set yourselves.
[12:45] Set yourself.
[12:47] Stand still and see the salvation of the
[12:50] Lord with you. Oh Judah and Jerusalem.
[12:55] Fear not nor be dismayed. Tomorrow go
[12:59] out against them for the Lord will be
[13:02] with you. Now I just this is confusing.
[13:05] Do I got to take care of this problem or
[13:06] you handling it?
[13:08] Right.
[13:11] Look at you're in a joint love affair
[13:14] with God. You set your love upon him and
[13:18] he wants you to do your part. You're
[13:21] going to go out there and you're going
[13:22] to face the Goliath right face to face
[13:27] and you are going to trust God that he's
[13:30] going to fight the battle. That's right.
[13:31] I don't believe that David was relying
[13:34] on his skill to get Goliath. Right. Any
[13:38] man that is relying on his skill to be a
[13:41] demon.
[13:45] No way. Amen. He had to have he needed
[13:48] to be putting his trust in God. I mean,
[13:51] we all got abilities, but we don't got
[13:53] ability to take the devil on oursel.
[13:57] And that's what Goliath represented,
[14:00] right? He's the one that taunt day and
[14:02] night for months the children of Israel.
[14:06] And so
[14:09] God wants us to trust him, to play our
[14:13] part in truly trusting him. Not just
[14:15] say, "I trust you, God." But not be
[14:18] willing to stand there and face the
[14:20] enemy.
[14:21] If you're going to trust God, that's why
[14:24] the scripture says, "Be not dismayed.
[14:27] Don't fear. Go up against them, but
[14:30] don't fear."
[14:32] And and it's it's it's it's a
[14:35] that's how you you have to set yourself
[14:37] and then you stand still and you're
[14:39] facing the devil face to face, but
[14:41] you're trusting in God at that moment to
[14:43] move. And that shows your faith. Amen.
[14:47] And and you know, we we handle things
[14:48] differently. We just we want to do
[14:52] things without trust.
[14:55] And um and our walk with the Lord is
[14:58] trust.
[15:00] And and if you want God to show you
[15:03] salvation, then you have to set your
[15:05] love upon him. You have to trust him and
[15:08] you have to follow the instructions. And
[15:10] a lot of times, you got to go up there
[15:12] and face that demon right in the face
[15:14] and say, "I stand in the name of the
[15:17] Lord." Right?
[15:20] I'm not I'm not backing down. I don't
[15:23] got to uh necessarily uh do the fighting
[15:27] because he's going to fight the battle,
[15:29] right? But I'm not backing down. I'm I'm
[15:32] not going in another room. I I I'm I'm
[15:35] going to stand there and I I I'm I'm
[15:37] going to uh the Lord's promised that
[15:40] he's going to be with me. Right.
[15:43] And so when I I think about these these
[15:46] scriptures here,
[15:50] um that
[15:52] that God doesn't want us to fear
[15:54] anymore. He doesn't want us to be
[15:55] dismayed. He just wants us to go out
[15:57] against the enemy. But but don't fight.
[16:00] Just set yourselves and behold, you're
[16:03] going to see the salvation of the Lord.
[16:06] There's always a part we have to play in
[16:08] every one of our trials.
[16:11] You have a part to play. Amen. And and
[16:14] count it all joy. Amen. You you you
[16:18] literally got to be happy.
[16:21] This is a hard thing to do. But I mean,
[16:23] it shows you're trusting God.
[16:26] So you have to believe. You have to
[16:28] trust God. The Bible says, "This is the
[16:29] victory that overcometh the world, even
[16:32] our faith." So we got to have faith in
[16:34] our trials. But this that we're talking
[16:37] about that God is is going to fight the
[16:40] battle. God is going to give the
[16:42] victory, but we have to do something.
[16:44] This is God's law of appropriation. God
[16:48] gives, but we must take. In other words,
[16:52] there's a part we play and there's a
[16:54] part that God plays. Let me give you
[16:57] some examples. Jesus said, "Fear not,
[17:00] little flock. It's the father's good
[17:02] pleasure to give you the kingdom.
[17:05] But Jesus also said the kingdom of God
[17:07] sufferth violent and the violent taketh
[17:09] it by force.
[17:11] So there's a part that he plays, there's
[17:14] a part that we play. Another place Jesus
[17:17] said, "Every man presseth into it." So
[17:20] in one sense it's the father's good
[17:22] pleasure just to give it to you. But uh
[17:25] you you you you got to start standing up
[17:28] and take it by force.
[17:31] Paul said, "I haven't attained. I
[17:33] haven't apprehended. I'm pressing
[17:34] towards the mark." So, there's a there's
[17:37] a part that I'm I'm taking. There's a
[17:39] part I'm doing. Joshua said, "Every
[17:42] place," not Joshua, I'm sorry, but God
[17:45] said to Joshua, "Every place that the
[17:47] soul of your foot shall tread upon, that
[17:50] I have given you, as I said unto Moses."
[17:53] So, God is the same yesterday, today,
[17:55] and forever. He told it to Moses. He's
[17:57] telling Joshua that if you're willing to
[18:00] put your foot at a place that you
[18:02] haven't been before, I'll give it to
[18:04] you. And if you're not willing to go
[18:06] there and take possession, if you don't
[18:08] want to say peace is mine, love is mine,
[18:10] joy is mine, uh um God in our home is
[18:13] mine, that that that that God is going
[18:16] to supply our needs according to his
[18:18] riches and glory. You're not going to
[18:19] put your foot there. You can't have it.
[18:24] Amen.
[18:25] And unfortunately, we're never going to
[18:27] hear a gospel that's going to change our
[18:30] lives.
[18:34] You're going to hear the gospel and
[18:36] you're going to believe the gospel.
[18:38] You're going to apply the gospel to your
[18:40] life and then the change is going to
[18:41] happen.
[18:43] It's not about
[18:46] hearing something and then just
[18:47] something magical happens in our life.
[18:50] No, we hear the word, we receive the
[18:52] word, then we manifest the word, and
[18:54] that's what changes our life. The law of
[18:57] appropriation, God gives, but we must
[19:00] take. Let's go to Exodus chapter 14.
[19:05] Exodus chapter 14.
[19:08] We're going to start with verse number
[19:10] one.
[19:16] And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,
[19:18] speak unto the children of Israel, that
[19:20] they turned and encamped before by Her
[19:26] name
[19:28] between Mdal and the sea, and against
[19:31] Balo Zof.
[19:36] See, I got some of you to to laugh.
[19:40] And I'm not even saying any jokes. They
[19:43] just I'm just being normal.
[19:47] I'm a natural
[19:51] before it shall ye encamp by the sea.
[19:54] For Pharaoh will say of the children of
[19:57] Israel, they are entangled in the land.
[19:59] The wilderness have shut them up, and I
[20:01] will harden Pharaoh's heart, and he
[20:03] shall follow after them, and I will
[20:05] honor be honored. I will be honored upon
[20:08] Pharaoh and upon all his hosts. God was
[20:11] going to get honored upon Pharaoh after
[20:14] f God hardened Pharaoh's heart. So, we
[20:18] see the that God is really trying to get
[20:20] something out of this situation than
[20:23] just helping Israel,
[20:26] right? It wasn't just helping God's
[20:29] people. God wants to be worshiped. He
[20:32] wants to be glorified. Here it is 2025
[20:35] in in June and we're talking about
[20:37] something that happened that far a long
[20:40] ago and God is still receiving glory.
[20:44] How great is our God, right? He he he he
[20:47] parted the Red Sea. We're we're still
[20:49] talking. He's still getting glory right
[20:52] here. And he's telling that he's going
[20:53] to do this to Pharaoh that he could
[20:55] receive glory. God knows what he's
[20:58] doing. So even though we're wanting to
[21:00] be delivered of our situation, we're
[21:02] wanting we're wanting to be helped,
[21:04] there's other things that is going on,
[21:08] we just got to trust trust God for that.
[21:11] And Pharaoh and upon all his host and
[21:13] the Egyptians that the Egyptians may
[21:15] know that I am the Lord and they did so
[21:18] and it came and it's kind of weird that
[21:20] the Egyptians may know that I am the
[21:23] Lord. Now, how long did that last?
[21:24] Right? They all got killed, right? So
[21:27] that they didn't keep that revelation
[21:29] very long. But yet he really wanted the
[21:32] enemy to know before they perished.
[21:37] And it was told that the king of Egypt
[21:41] that the people fled and the heart of
[21:43] Pharaoh and his servants was turned
[21:45] against the people. And they said, "Why
[21:48] have ye done this? And we have let
[21:51] Israel go from serving us." He made
[21:53] ready his chariots and took his people
[21:55] with him. And he took 600 chosen
[21:57] chariots, all the chariots of Egypt, and
[22:00] the captains, every one of them. And the
[22:01] Lord hardened the heart of Pharaoh, the
[22:03] king of Egypt. And he pursued after the
[22:05] children of Israel. And the children of
[22:06] Israel went out with him on high hand
[22:10] with a high hand. And the Egyptians
[22:12] pursued after them and all the horses
[22:14] and chariots of Pharaoh and the horse
[22:15] his horsemen and his army and overtook
[22:18] them and encamped encamping by the sea
[22:21] besides that one place before Balilean.
[22:28] And when Pharaoh drew nigh, the children
[22:31] of Israel lifted up their eyes. And
[22:33] behold, the Egyptians marched after
[22:37] them, and they were so afraid. They were
[22:40] in a pickle. And the children of Israel
[22:42] cried unto the Lord. What a pattern do
[22:45] we see here.
[22:48] Problem? Cry after the Lord.
[22:52] Amen. Don't look to another human being.
[22:56] Right? Don't look to the government.
[22:57] Don't look to the church. Look to God.
[23:01] Amen. You know, look to God because God
[23:04] is wanting to develop relationships with
[23:06] us.
[23:10] Um, and we're in verse number 10. And
[23:13] when Pharaoh drew Nai, okay, we read
[23:15] that. And verse 11, and they cried unto
[23:18] Moses because there was no graves in
[23:21] Egypt. And they cried unto Moses,
[23:23] "Because there were no graves in Egypt,
[23:25] that thou has taken us to die in the
[23:27] wilderness? Wherefore has thou dealt
[23:28] with us to carry us forth out of Egypt,
[23:32] is not this the word that we did tell
[23:35] thee in Egypt, saying, Let us alone that
[23:40] we may serve the Egyptians, for it had
[23:42] been better for us to serve the
[23:44] Egyptians than that we should die in the
[23:46] wilderness." So, we could see that they
[23:48] were not trusting the Lord.
[23:52] They were not trusting the Lord here. It
[23:54] was like the experience that they had,
[23:57] you know, with the 10 plagues.
[24:00] Believe there was 10 plagues, right? 10
[24:01] plagues or 12 plagues, I can't remember.
[24:04] There was 10 plagues. And they were, I
[24:07] mean, very uh powerful plagues,
[24:09] especially the last plague.
[24:12] And you would think that would be enough
[24:15] to help them along,
[24:18] but for some reason
[24:20] the problem that they were facing, they
[24:22] forgot the greatness of their God in the
[24:25] past.
[24:27] And you can't do that. You got to
[24:29] remember what God's done for you in the
[24:31] past because that's what you need to
[24:34] remember to give you strength.
[24:37] Well, we're going to read some
[24:39] scriptures.
[24:41] Uh, I'm just going to read the
[24:42] scriptures right now. I'm I'm I'm going
[24:44] to go right back here, but if I'm just
[24:46] going to read them. You It's in Psalms
[24:48] 106:21.
[24:49] The Bible says, "They forgot God their
[24:53] Savior, which had done great things in
[24:56] Egypt,
[24:58] whose wondrous works in in the land and
[25:01] and terrible things by the Red Sea."
[25:04] See, but they murmured in the temps, and
[25:06] they hearkened not to the voice of God.
[25:08] So, we've got to keep in mind what God
[25:11] has done for us in our past. We just got
[25:13] to, you know, we got a memory for what?
[25:14] For good things, not bad things. Amen.
[25:17] So, we need to use it. All right. So,
[25:20] let's go ahead and go back to um uh
[25:25] Ezekiel, not Ezekiel, Exodus chapter 14.
[25:29] Where am I at today? All right. And
[25:33] Moses, verse 13, and Moses said unto the
[25:38] people, "Fear ye not, stand still."
[25:43] There it is again, "and see the
[25:46] salvation of the Lord, which he will
[25:49] show to you today. For the Egyptians who
[25:53] you have uh seen today, you shall see
[25:56] them again no more forever. The Lord
[25:59] shall fight for you, and ye shall hold
[26:03] your peace.
[26:09] And the Lord said unto Moses, "Wherefore
[26:11] cryst thou unto me, speak to the
[26:12] children of Israel, that they go
[26:14] forward."
[26:17] So fear not.
[26:19] You're in your situation. Fear not.
[26:23] Stand still and behold the salvation of
[26:26] the Lord. Behold it. It's It's going to
[26:29] happen.
[26:30] God, after God saved you, he wants to
[26:34] keep saving you from situations.
[26:37] He He wants to continue to be God in
[26:39] your life. He He He's not the type of uh
[26:42] God that just wants to see you saved and
[26:44] then, you know, whatever. You just go
[26:46] through life and just battle all your
[26:48] problems. No, God wants to be a
[26:50] companion to you all your life. Fear ye
[26:53] not. Stand still. See the salvation of
[26:56] the Lord. Most people can't see the
[26:59] salvation of the Lord. Amen.
[27:02] They're often live in a state of fear
[27:05] and it paralyzes them.
[27:07] They won't stand still and and and quiet
[27:10] their spirit enough to actually see God
[27:12] move. Right? The devil wants to get
[27:15] really bothered. They don't they don't
[27:16] have eyes of faith to see God in their
[27:19] situation because they're focusing too
[27:22] much on the problem. And I understand we
[27:25] got problems and they're big. But we
[27:28] serve a God who wants to help us in that
[27:31] problem. And we've got to take the first
[27:33] step. Draw nigh to me and I'll draw nigh
[27:36] to you. Take the first step of faith.
[27:38] Stand still and behold. I'm expecting
[27:40] you, God, to move. I'm going to trust
[27:42] you in this situation. Now, if you feel
[27:44] you can't do that, then what you need to
[27:47] do is get on your knees and cry out to
[27:49] God. Call upon God and go to the source
[27:52] of God.
[27:55] You got to get your heart prepared to a
[27:57] place that you you're not going to go
[27:59] anywhere else. You're not going to look
[28:00] to anybody else. You're going to put
[28:02] your trust in God.
[28:05] Matthew 13:16, Jesus said, "Blessed
[28:08] are your eyes." Right? Many people can't
[28:11] see the salvation of the Lord, but
[28:12] blessed are your eyes, for they see, and
[28:16] your ears, for they hear. For verily I
[28:18] say unto you, many false many no not
[28:20] false many prophets and righteous men
[28:23] have desired to see those things which
[28:26] you see and have not seen them
[28:29] and to hear those things which you have
[28:31] hear and have not heard them. So we are
[28:33] a blessed people today. We are a blessed
[28:36] people. The the message, the prophet of
[28:38] the hour, the the the the manifestation
[28:41] of of the spirit of God in a man, we've
[28:43] never seen it as it was in in William
[28:45] Brham. And we've got a message that's
[28:48] true.
[28:50] Amen.
[28:56] And we are a special people,
[29:00] a a chosen people, a royal priesthood.
[29:03] And God has selected us to be able to
[29:06] believe in him in the middle of rotten
[29:09] situations.
[29:11] Where the other other peoples that, you
[29:13] know, we don't see. We don't we don't
[29:15] see that. We we can't trust God that
[29:17] much, but we're chosen.
[29:20] God has put something inside of us.
[29:22] Amen. It's him bearing witness. Our
[29:26] spirit bearing witness with his spirit.
[29:29] We're we're sons and daughters of God.
[29:31] And God will never leave us. He'll never
[29:33] forsake us. He's there to see us
[29:36] through.
[29:39] So fear not. Stand still and see the
[29:42] salvation of the Lord which he will show
[29:44] you today. Yes. Is not Jesus Christ the
[29:49] same yesterday, today, and forever. Did
[29:52] he not say, "I'll never leave you nor
[29:54] forsake you." Why did he say that? The
[29:57] Bible says, "So we can boldly say, I
[29:59] will not fear what man will do unto me."
[30:03] Just so we can boldly say that the Lord
[30:06] is my helper. I will not fear what man
[30:08] shall do unto me.
[30:10] the Lord. How many can say the Lord is
[30:12] my helper? Amen. And we're going to look
[30:14] to the Lord. We're not going to look to
[30:16] one another. That's right.
[30:19] I don't mind looking to one. I don't
[30:21] mind praying for one another. But here's
[30:22] the thing. We got to learn to get a hold
[30:25] of God ourselves.
[30:28] We're not eight years old anymore. Amen.
[30:32] We're adults
[30:34] and we don't believe in a shirt tail
[30:36] experience of hanging on to somebody to
[30:38] make our salvation.
[30:41] We got to get our own salvation.
[30:45] I was sitting there with thinking before
[30:47] service. I didn't
[30:50] have these in my original notes, but I
[30:51] just jotted them down. I want take a
[30:53] look at two men. They were looking for
[30:55] salvation. The first one was the rich
[30:57] young ruler.
[30:59] He came running. What must we do? What
[31:02] must I do to inherit or to receive
[31:06] salvation, eternal life? And Jesus told
[31:09] him, just give what you have, distribute
[31:11] it to the poor and and and you shall
[31:14] have treasures in heaven. Come follow
[31:16] me. That was the advice that Jesus gave
[31:18] him. Amen.
[31:20] To get saved
[31:25] because he was lacking one thing, right?
[31:27] He kept all the commands, but he was
[31:29] lacking one thing. And the Bible says
[31:32] that he turned it down. He turned
[31:33] salvation down
[31:36] because what he had meant more to him
[31:38] than what God was requiring of him.
[31:41] Amen. And then there was another man.
[31:43] His name was Zacharias.
[31:47] And this man didn't come running. He got
[31:49] up in a tree and he was just going to
[31:52] watch Jesus go by.
[31:55] And when Jesus got under that tree, he
[31:57] just stopped and he looked up and he
[31:59] said, "Zakius, come down." Right? In
[32:02] other words, there was a call.
[32:05] There was not a call to the rich young
[32:06] ruler because think about it.
[32:13] God knows those that are his. And I know
[32:15] there's a many are called, few are
[32:16] chosen. But I'm just saying right here,
[32:19] here is this man, Zakius. Come down.
[32:22] Make haste. Come down here. we're gonna
[32:24] go and we're going to have supper at
[32:25] your house today.
[32:28] And so he gets in there and he's talking
[32:30] with them and he he says,
[32:34] "I am going to take half of my goods and
[32:38] I'm going to distribute to the poor. Not
[32:41] all of them, half of them.
[32:44] And if I've if I've done anything wrong
[32:47] to anybody, if I've manipulated, if I've
[32:50] come and I tried to do something ac uh
[32:54] wrongfully accuse somebody just to get
[32:56] gain for me, what I'm going to do is I'm
[32:59] going to pay them back four-fold.
[33:02] You know what Jesus said? This day
[33:05] salvation has come to this house.
[33:09] Two men
[33:13] wanted salvation. One willing to pay the
[33:15] price. God says, "Give it all." He
[33:17] wouldn't give it. The other says, "I'll
[33:19] give half." But see, Jesus knew the
[33:23] heart of Zakius.
[33:25] Said, "This also is the son of Abraham."
[33:31] God means business if we mean business.
[33:37] Sincere heart. That rich young ruler,
[33:42] he might have had a lot going for him,
[33:46] but you got to have a sincere heart.
[33:48] Amen.
[33:50] God has saved us from so many
[33:52] situations.
[33:56] Most Christians view salvation as
[33:58] something that happened to them long ago
[34:00] at the beginning of their journey when
[34:02] they repented and they got baptized.
[34:05] and there's really no need of any more
[34:07] salvation because they're saved.
[34:10] But that ain't even scriptural.
[34:13] First Peter 1:9 says, "Receiving the end
[34:15] of your faith, even the salvation of
[34:18] your souls."
[34:20] Jesus said, "He that endure to the end,
[34:22] the same shall be saved." 1 Peter 15, we
[34:25] are kept by the power of God through
[34:28] faith unto salvation when ready to be
[34:31] revealed in the last time.
[34:35] So, we need to start looking at God. We
[34:38] need God today as much as we did when we
[34:40] repented and got baptized in the name of
[34:43] the Lord Jesus Christ.
[34:46] Amen.
[34:49] We constantly lead to the Lord every
[34:51] day. We need salvation. Amen.
[34:55] 2 Corinthians 6:1, "We then as workers
[35:00] together with him beseech you also that
[35:03] you receive not the grace of God in
[35:06] vain." There's a there's a going to be a
[35:08] lot of people that receive the grace of
[35:09] God in vain. In other words, they never
[35:11] follow through with it.
[35:14] Right.
[35:15] Amen. For he saith, I have heard thee in
[35:18] an accepted day, accepted a time
[35:21] accepted, excuse me, and in the day of
[35:24] salvation have I sucked thee. Behold,
[35:28] now is the accepted time.
[35:33] Behold, now is the day of salvation.
[35:37] Now, when you read that scripture,
[35:38] tomorrow it'll be the time or the day of
[35:42] salvation.
[35:44] All you got to do is look at your life
[35:45] and see what you really want God to help
[35:48] you with.
[35:50] And God, if you're if you're willing to
[35:53] do your part, God is willing to take you
[35:55] as far as you want to go. That's right.
[36:00] I have heard thee in the time accepted.
[36:04] In the time accepted,
[36:07] you shall seek me and find me when you
[36:09] search for me with all your heart.
[36:11] there's an accepted time and that God
[36:15] does everything beautiful in his time.
[36:18] It it not it's not always our time
[36:20] because
[36:23] maybe we got to go somebody's got to go
[36:25] through the 10 plagues.
[36:27] Maybe we got to have a a Red Sea
[36:30] experience. We we we don't Maybe we got
[36:32] to get attacked by the enemy. I don't
[36:34] know. But we got to trust God in our
[36:36] situation. We serve a real God. We're
[36:39] not just in some religion. Amen. We
[36:41] serve a real alive God.
[36:45] In the day of salvation, salvation
[36:48] wasn't just coming out of Egypt.
[36:52] The children of Israel were saved from
[36:55] many things after they crossed the Red
[36:58] Sea. Did you know that? God saved them
[37:01] over and over and provided for them.
[37:04] Their shoes never wore out. They never
[37:06] had to they never had to get the blue
[37:08] cross and blue shield out.
[37:11] I went to the doctors this week and I
[37:13] used my blue cross and blue shield. I
[37:15] don't know how much it's going to pay,
[37:16] but you understand what I'm saying. They
[37:19] didn't need that. Think about it, right?
[37:22] They had a God there to make sure it was
[37:25] supplied when when death was coming.
[37:30] Amen. Right.
[37:32] Praise God. This is the day of
[37:35] salvation. There's a God that can save
[37:37] us today. In the day of salvation have I
[37:40] suckered thee. That means I have aided
[37:43] thee. I've relieved thee. I have helped
[37:45] thee. God is here to help us. If we
[37:49] could just sink our teeth, he's the one
[37:51] that we're looking for. Amen. He's the
[37:54] one we go to. Amen. So, we need to have
[37:57] faith in our situations.
[38:00] Now is the time to behold your
[38:03] salvation. I can do all things through
[38:06] Christ who strengthens me.
[38:09] Put my trust in him. Greater is he
[38:12] that's in me than he that is in the
[38:15] world or your situation. If God before
[38:18] me, who can be against me? No weapon
[38:22] formed against me shall prosper. Every
[38:26] place that the soul of my feet shall
[38:27] tread upon is mine. Right? I mean, we
[38:31] have these promises. Either we're going
[38:33] to take God at his word and stay there,
[38:35] or we're gonna become a denominational
[38:38] believer,
[38:40] right? Who knows the scriptures, but
[38:43] then don't believe them
[38:45] because the devil, he knows the
[38:47] scriptures better than we do, right,
[38:48] Brother Dennis? That's true. He knows it
[38:51] better than we do, but he doesn't adhere
[38:54] to them.
[38:56] God wants to give us victory.
[38:59] 1 Corinthians 15:57, "But thanks be to
[39:02] God which giveth us the victory through
[39:06] our Lord Jesus Christ."
[39:09] Therefore, therefore, my beloved
[39:12] brethren, our job is to be a wishywashy
[39:17] just God will take care of me. That's
[39:19] not what the scripture says. Therefore,
[39:22] my beloved brethren, be ye steadfast,
[39:26] unmovable, and be occupied, always
[39:29] abounding in the work of the Lord. For
[39:32] as much as you know that your labor is
[39:34] not in vain in the Lord. Amen. Now, he's
[39:37] given us the victory. Amen.
[39:41] What we need to do with that victory.
[39:44] Do you know every time that God has
[39:45] healed you, he has saved you from
[39:47] sickness? Amen.
[39:50] How many time How many times has God
[39:52] healed you? We've all been healed
[39:54] before.
[39:56] That is God saving you from your
[39:58] sickness. Amen. He's a savior.
[40:02] Every time God has blessed the food you
[40:04] prayed for, he has saved you from a
[40:06] sickness.
[40:09] You ever get sick after you eat and
[40:10] wonder about your prayer? You know what
[40:13] I'm talking about? Because sometimes we
[40:15] just kind of take for granted, I'm going
[40:18] to pray for the food, right? Give thanks
[40:20] and pray for the food. And then you get
[40:22] sick and you wonder sometimes like, was
[40:25] it the food? I prayed for the food. What
[40:29] happened? And so I think we just really
[40:33] need to a sign, Lord, let me put my
[40:35] heart into the increase my faith when
[40:37] I'm praying. Are you with me?
[40:40] Every time God has protected you from an
[40:42] automobile accident, he has literally
[40:44] saved your life. We all got testimonies.
[40:47] I I'll never forget this car was just
[40:49] going this fast in front of me. And I'm
[40:52] telling you, I I would say from here to
[40:54] the middle of those uh chairs right
[40:56] there. And I'll tell you it just two
[40:59] seconds different. I mean, he ran a stop
[41:02] sign and he was going like seven. I
[41:04] don't know what he he must have been
[41:05] going at least 60 in town. He was It was
[41:10] like in the middle of the night. He must
[41:11] have been drunk. I don't know. But I'll
[41:13] tell you, I walked I I'll never forget I
[41:17] was saved.
[41:19] God protected me. He was my savior. He
[41:21] saved me in that situation.
[41:24] Every time God moves in your behalf,
[41:27] you're beholding your salvation. That is
[41:29] right. And I think we need to give
[41:31] thanks to God. Thank you, God. Thank you
[41:34] for that. Count your blessings. Name
[41:37] them one by one. We get to where we just
[41:39] all we're doing is focusing on problems
[41:41] and we just have this negative thing of,
[41:44] you know, fix fix and we need to spend
[41:46] some time. Thank you, Lord. Thank you,
[41:48] Lord. Thank you, Lord. Make God, you
[41:51] know, he wants to receive glory. Amen.
[41:54] Even if it's just for a little bit and
[41:56] you die like Pharaoh. I'm not saying
[41:58] that happened to you, but God wanted God
[42:00] wanted
[42:02] God wanted Pharaoh to know. If he wanted
[42:04] Pharaoh to know, don't you think he
[42:05] wants his children to know? Amen. Amen.
[42:09] Behold your salvation. Give thanks in
[42:13] all things, for this is the will of God
[42:15] in Christ Jesus.
[42:18] Who shall lay anything to the charge of
[42:20] God's elect?
[42:23] Think about that.
[42:25] Why are we worried if God's for us?
[42:30] If we're if we're God's elect, what do
[42:32] we got to worry about? He's going to
[42:33] take care of us. God wants to save us
[42:36] from our situations. He wants to give us
[42:38] the victory. He wants to give us joy
[42:40] unspeakable, full of glory. He wants to
[42:42] give us peace that passes all
[42:44] understanding. He wants to give us love,
[42:46] divine love that is doesn't fear loving
[42:49] our own enemies.
[42:52] That's the God we serve. 1 John 3:1
[42:57] says, "Behold, what manner of love the
[43:00] Father have bestowed upon us that we
[43:03] should be called the sons of God.
[43:06] Therefore, the world knoweth us not,
[43:09] because it knew him not." Do you ever
[43:12] wonder wonder why nobody understands
[43:15] you,
[43:16] right? But they didn't understand Jesus
[43:19] either.
[43:21] That word behold means to see or to
[43:24] perceive, to consider, to be aware, to
[43:27] know, to understand or to be uh to be
[43:29] sure. Behold your salvation. Behold what
[43:34] manner of love the father have bestowed
[43:36] upon us.
[43:38] Beloved, now are we the sons of God.
[43:41] Even though it doesn't appear, but we
[43:44] know that when he shall appear, we shall
[43:46] be like him, for we shall see him as he
[43:47] is. And every man that has this hope
[43:50] inside of him, even though it doesn't
[43:52] appear, he has a hope in here. Even
[43:54] though it doesn't appear, he has a hope
[43:56] in here. Even though it doesn't appear.
[43:59] That's right. What's he do? He works
[44:02] towards
[44:04] becoming more like Jesus. Amen.
[44:07] He works towards becoming more like
[44:09] Jesus. You know, everybody don't have
[44:11] that hope.
[44:13] And when they don't have that hope, they
[44:14] they don't look they don't work towards
[44:16] it. Romans chapter 8:38, "Behold your
[44:20] salvation." Romans 8:35. I I'll start
[44:23] with here. Romans 8:35. Who shall
[44:26] separate us from the love of Christ?
[44:31] Think about your problem. Think about
[44:33] yourself situation.
[44:36] Who's going to separate us from the love
[44:37] of Christ? So tribulation,
[44:40] distress, persecution, famine,
[44:43] nakedness, peril, sword, employee,
[44:46] uh spouse, neighbor,
[44:50] the government,
[44:54] drones,
[44:58] countries.
[45:03] So some brother, some sister,
[45:06] so some trial,
[45:09] something we're going I'm just going to
[45:10] throw in the towel.
[45:13] I'm sorry. I believe the scriptures.
[45:16] I believe the scriptures. I'm not going
[45:18] to allow anything to separate me from
[45:21] the love of Christ. Nothing. Amen.
[45:26] And I don't care if you get in some big
[45:28] fight and you know you don't you don't
[45:30] feel like talking to to somebody. I'll
[45:33] say get on your knees. Get a hold of
[45:37] God. Say, "God, fill me with your love
[45:40] and and and and and and stand up and and
[45:42] and deal with that situation."
[45:46] Don't let anything separate you from the
[45:48] love of God. Now look, God ain't
[45:51] changing his opinion about you, right?
[45:55] But we can change our opinion about God,
[45:59] right? God is faithful. We're the ones
[46:02] that are struggling learning how to be
[46:04] faithful.
[46:06] As it is written, for thy sake, we are
[46:08] killed all the day long. In other words,
[46:10] we got trials coming
[46:13] and and we're counted as sheep for the
[46:16] slaughter. It just seems like sometimes
[46:18] nobody cares and and nobody's looking
[46:21] for us and nobody's helping us and and
[46:23] and nobody's reaching out for us. Just
[46:26] like counted
[46:28] as sheep for the slaughter. I'm just
[46:31] being slaughtered.
[46:33] Nobody seems to care.
[46:37] Nay, in all these things, we are more
[46:40] than conquerors. Even in that state of
[46:43] being slaughtered, nobody seems to care.
[46:46] We are more than conquerors. Think about
[46:49] that. Through him that loved us, it's
[46:53] through Christ that we can do all
[46:55] things. For I am persuaded that neither
[46:58] death nor life, nor angels, or
[47:00] principalities, nor powers, nor things
[47:03] present, look at that, things present,
[47:05] nor things to come.
[47:08] Behold your salvation saints for ne nor
[47:11] height nor depth nor any other creature
[47:14] shall be able to separate us from the
[47:15] love of God which is in Christ Jesus our
[47:18] Lord. Amen.
[47:23] Set your love upon him because he set
[47:25] his love upon me. I will deliver him.
[47:30] We got that first part to play. I'm
[47:32] going to put God first in my life. I'm
[47:34] not going to let anything come between
[47:36] me and God.
[47:38] If everybody else wants to jump ship,
[47:41] let him jump.
[47:43] I'm holding to God's unchanging hand.
[47:46] I'm staying with God.
[47:49] God allows sickness to come into our
[47:51] life in order to heal us.
[47:54] He allows bitter problems with people to
[47:56] come in order for God to forgive them
[47:59] through us. Right. Right. If if if and
[48:03] and if we forgive others, then God's
[48:05] going to forgive us. And if we don't
[48:06] forgive others, then God's not going to
[48:07] forgive us. So God allows these bitter
[48:10] situations.
[48:12] God allows all kinds of situations to
[48:14] happen in order for us to really behold
[48:18] the salvation of our God.
[48:22] 1 Chronicles 29:10.
[48:26] Wherefore David blessed the Lord before
[48:28] all the congregation. And David said,
[48:30] "Blessed be
[48:32] thou, Lord God of Israel, our Father,
[48:35] forever and ever.
[48:38] Thine, oh Lord, is
[48:41] the greatness and the power and the
[48:44] glory and the victory and the majesty.
[48:48] For all that is in the heaven and in the
[48:52] earth is thine.
[48:54] Thine is the kingdom, O Lord, and thou
[48:57] art exalted as head above all. Amen.
[49:02] both riches and honor. Amen. Come of
[49:05] thee, and thou reignest over all, and in
[49:09] thy hand is power and might, and in thy
[49:11] hand is to make great, and to give
[49:14] strength unto all.
[49:17] Now therefore, oh God, we thank thee,
[49:20] and we praise thy glorious name. Amen.
[49:24] You know what? That's right, Sister
[49:26] Linda, I want my prayer to be like that.
[49:29] That's how I want to pray.
[49:31] That's I want to look to God with a
[49:33] confidence.
[49:35] You you you read that and there's a
[49:37] confidence coming forth there. That's
[49:40] what I want to have. He have done great
[49:44] things. Yes. Don't cry in the
[49:47] wilderness.
[49:49] Don't be of those who have no hope,
[49:51] whose eyes are shut, whose ears are
[49:53] shut, who cannot see. Our eyes are open.
[49:57] We know who to go to. Yes.
[50:02] He's delivered us and saved us so many
[50:04] times. We don't have to go through the
[50:06] cycle and learn all learn all over like
[50:08] like I got to find out a new way. No,
[50:10] God is the way.
[50:13] He is the way.
[50:16] Psalm 71 verse 17.
[50:20] Oh God, thou has taught me from my
[50:23] youth.
[50:26] And hither have I declared thy wondrous
[50:30] works. Isn't it a blessing to have
[50:31] served the Lord?
[50:33] Well, however long you serve the Lord,
[50:36] the longer you serve the Lord, it's a
[50:40] it's an honor.
[50:42] God, oh God, thou has taught me from my
[50:46] youth. You know, God even tries to teach
[50:48] the youth. Praise God, brother Luke.
[50:53] God's teaching you. I think that's
[50:55] glorious.
[50:59] I think God cares about the youth. He
[51:02] cares about us.
[51:05] And hitherto have I declared thy
[51:09] wondrous works.
[51:11] Now also when I Now also when I am old
[51:14] and gay-headed, oh God, forsake me not
[51:19] until I have showed thy strength unto
[51:22] this generation and thy power to
[51:25] everyone that has come. Thy
[51:28] righteousness also, oh God, is very
[51:30] high.
[51:33] Who has done great things, oh God, who
[51:36] is like unto thee. What an attitude to
[51:39] have when you got a problem. God,
[51:42] there's nobody like you. There's nobody
[51:44] that can help me like you can. I tell
[51:47] you, when you talk like that to God,
[51:49] you're stirring up the faith inside of
[51:52] you. Amen. And that's what we need.
[51:55] Because Jesus said, "If thou canst
[51:57] believe, all things are going to be
[51:59] possible."
[52:01] And and and and there's a reason that
[52:03] when God gives faith, faith is made in
[52:07] such a way to grow.
[52:11] And we do not make it into a rapture
[52:14] with faith for salvation.
[52:20] Your faith has to grow.
[52:22] You know, Brother Brand preached a
[52:24] message, perfect faith. It takes perfect
[52:26] faith for to make uh uh perfect perfect
[52:30] faith uh for perfect love to make it
[52:32] into a rapture.
[52:36] And it is the same, if I could say it
[52:39] like this, the same faith that's built
[52:41] in a mature way. You understand what I'm
[52:44] saying? But you can't just expect to go
[52:47] anywhere with God if you if you have
[52:49] this mindset. Well, I believed. I got
[52:51] saved. I got baptized. I'm saved. I
[52:53] guess things are just settled with me.
[52:56] That is not how it works. This is just
[52:59] the beginning of growing your faith.
[53:01] Now, every single day you have
[53:03] situations that come into your life and
[53:05] you've got to have your faith put to the
[53:07] test. You've got to exercise that faith
[53:10] and it's got to grow. And then before
[53:12] you know it, you're handling things with
[53:15] your faith over fear that you never did
[53:18] in the past
[53:20] because you're exercising your faith.
[53:23] Last scripture, Psalms 126:3,
[53:27] the Lord have done great things for us,
[53:30] whereof we are glad. Let's stand
[53:32] together. God bless you.
[53:34] The Lord have done great things for us.
[53:38] We should all be testifying. If you
[53:40] don't you don't go like we we should
[53:42] testify to one another. I mean, we're
[53:45] always dealing with problems with one
[53:46] another. Why not testify?
[53:51] I I think that would just encourage me
[53:53] if someone gave a testimony of a great
[53:56] thing that that God's doing, has done
[54:00] to remember what God has done in our
[54:03] life. Amen.
[54:05] Let's sing. Can we sing that uh song? He
[54:08] hideth my soul.
[54:11] Try. Let's sing that. He hideth my soul
[54:15] in the midst. Right in the midst in that
[54:17] secret place of the most high. He hides
[54:20] us there.
[54:21] [Music]
[54:23] Wonderful
[54:25] savior
[54:27] is Jesus
[54:30] my lord.
[54:32] A wonderful
[54:35] Savior
[54:37] to me.
[54:40] He hideth
[54:43] my soul in the cliff
[54:48] of the rock.
[54:50] Mary.
