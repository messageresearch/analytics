while like he's been trained by his parents and we're just uh we're real proud of the whole family amen it's a great privilege to have them with us and have them in our home in our barn and all the different places that they're sleeping but we had asked we had asked sister elizabeth if if she would seeing a special for the lord and uh for god's people amen whatever would be on our hearts so we want to have her come forward amen praise the lord so [Music] sorry [Music] it's not hard to believe standing on the mountaintops of glory when you can hear the songs of angels and a breeze from heaven sends your spirit sorry but in the valley once more will jesus still be lord that's the question [Music] for believing when believing isn't easy that is the testing [Music] i need faith for the times when the sun does not shine and the mountaintop is just a memory [Music] when there's no sign to be seen and i don't feel a thing to the word of god alone i must clean i need faith for the day when trouble comes my way and i just don't understand what it means [Music] that's when nothing else will do faith alone will get me through and believing becomes my victory it's not hard to believe when things are going well and skies are sunny [Music] when you feel you're making progress doing good living in a time of plenty [Music] but if all of that should change would you still keep the faith that's the question [Music] for believing when believing isn't easy that is the testing i need faith for the times when the sun does not shine and the mountaintop is just a memory when there's no sign to be seen and i don't feel a thing to the word of god alone i must clean i need faith for the day when trouble comes my way and i just don't understand what it means that's when nothing else will do faith alone will get me through and believing becomes my victory that's when nothing else will do faith alone will get me through and believing becomes my victory [Music] [Applause] the scripture says this is the victory that over the world given our faith without faith we can't make it without faith we can't please him we become born again by faith we become to the statue of a perfect man by faith and we're going to receive this word by faith tonight amen we certainly appreciate that song and i need faith for the valleys i need faith for my trials my test that's where i really need faith and i believe i'm going to receive more faith tonight amen that's the word faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word we're going to hear the word tonight amen amen how many is excited for the word amen um well this is a special night um for brother aaron mcgarry to be with us um he was telling me in the back room and i don't keep track of these things but my brother's got a

mentioning it was 21 years ago he had a service on a thursday night and a friday night to fit me in between preaching um in lima and then also preaching in uh ottawa lake and he found out i was in town he said can you preach i said well i'm only in town wednesday through sunday and i'm already preaching wednesday and sunday he said what are you doing thursday night and friday night and we ended up having preaching on a thursday and friday night and i was the first minister they ever had guest minister they ever had in the church after it started that year so i feel like i'm part of the beginning and i feel like i'm the last one to preach in the new building though but it's uh but we're happy to be able to be here tonight and see god blessing still persevering and continuing just seeing god adding to the ministry and to the work and it just shows that you don't labor in vain when you labor for the things of god so we're happy to be here and considered a great honor and privilege to be able to minister this is home for us and we appreciate the privilege james chapter 2 i'd like to read verse start with verse 20 read to verse 24 then i also like to read in the book of romans and not sure just how far we can get tonight if the lord terry's and we're here on sunday morning he would continue to lead like to pick up on the same subject that we're ministering tonight so i i appreciate the opportunity just to take my time with the subject james chapter 2 verse 20 but will thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar see us thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which saith abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only and then james chapter four excuse me romans chapter four romans chapter 4 verses 12 to 18. says romans chapter 4 verse 12 and the father of circumcision so speaking of abraham and the father circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to abraham or his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith for they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void and the promise made of none effect because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to that also which is a faith of it the faith of abraham who is the father of us all as it is written i've made thee a father of many nations before him whom he believed even god who quickeneth the dead and calleth those things which be not as though they were who against hope believed in hope that he might be the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be amen if we could just bow our heads in prayer our gracious heavenly father we considered a wonderful privilege to be together this evening as family on these wednesday nights to sit at your table lord knowing that as we come together that we'll be feasting on eternal things that we do not come in a way of lifting up tradition or man that we come because there's something in our hearts drawing us we see the promise and the word of god where we're gathered there you'll be in our midst we see the time that we're living in and know that we ought to gather ourselves together even more so for it's in these gatherings like this that our faith has increased and grows so bless all that are here and we know that being a midweek maybe school has started back for some families maybe there's just the demands of a thursday morning that are looming but we pray that in the lateness of the day and the time that we have together you can make the most of it as we look solely to you to come and speak to us we ask this in the name of lord jesus christ amen and you can be seated my title tonight is supreme faith supreme faith and i'd like to use a a statement at the very beginning to kind of get us thinking in the right in the same channel brother branham when he's speaking uh the sermon balm and gilead in 1959 he says one thing that we have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we have had and that that statement we can connect with rapturing faith a perfect faith and we know he teaches us that we have to have more faith than there was in any age and i think that's part of what his burden was if not the exact vision that he had when he makes this statement he says the one thing we have to move up to now is a supreme faith to what we have had and he says you cannot have that faith until you know perfectly what you're doing so you can't have supreme faith until you know perfectly what you're doing and then all of us feel like we should quit now because there's probably nothing we've ever done that we could say we knew perfectly what we were doing if we were being honest with ourselves so it's supreme faith is quite a high bar but notice what he says you just say well i'm going home i'm going to go out and start the car that's all an act of faith tomorrow i'll meet you at a certain place that's all an act of faith because you've just done it so much because it's a regular routine with you well that's the way things of god are so we think of supreme faith that we've got to move up to a supreme faith in what we have had we start feeling this pressure i got to know perfectly what i'm doing i got to figure it all out i've got to have all these things in place but brother brahma's just telling us how that we get there and he uses just the common example of saying well i'm going to go home tonight so i'm going to start my car and go home i'm going to go meet you at a certain place he says those are acts of faith and he says you've just done it so much towards a regular routine so he says that's the way the things of god are after you have trusted him and watched him do so many things till it becomes just like a regular routine so it's all it's it's in watching him that supreme faith has developed it's in keeping your eyes on the word of god and he says and that's the condition i think the church will be in before the coming of the lord so the rapture will just go right on that way it'll be it'll just be a regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god amen isn't that amazing to think that the rapture the change of our body is going to be in the regular routine of following the scriptures and the plans of god and so as our title is supreme faith we can get in our minds while that's an unattainable unreachable faith but keep that in mind that to come to the supreme faith brother braham said it's just going to be the regular routine of following the plans of god following the scriptures to where you see him meet his promises so many times that our faith just continues to grow and continues to grow and i want to draw out of the example of abraham this example of supreme faith because i believe it's supreme faith that was revealed in abraham and you forgive me if i don't know what to do with all this space here at sin of the light this brother aaron gary might finally be loosed i hardly ever move a foot when i preach but with all this space i feel like i need to use it and i was telling brother john on my when i pulled in i said how many people are here tonight he goes i don't know and i said i've just never seen that many cars in the parking lot that weren't for sale and so i i like these people are here for church this is wonderful and so it's great to see everyone here i want to draw out of abraham's life this example of supreme faith because it's supreme faith that's revealed in abraham's life and we use the phrase rapturing faith we've all heard that and we know rapture and faith is what lays in this word it's what's coming to us that quickening power at the opening of the seals uh it's a perfect faith that we have to come into in this hour uh to change our bodies to be changed in a moment in a twinkling of an eye and when we speak of faith in that manner and brother braham says you'd hardly have enough faith for your a headache and you've got to have faith to change your body we can begin to feel as if uh it's out it's it's not something that we have let alone something we're ever going to get to so it can feel very out of reach uh maybe in some ways it seems unrealistic you might even feel that way just about general faith and just the faith uh for the daily needs and we make it very mysterious uh rapturing faith seems very mysterious it's a perfect faith seems very unattainable but in the as we look at the example of abraham i want it to become more practical i'd like for it to seem to be more reachable abraham and we're just going to jump into the life of abraham drawn a lot from romans there and james and we'll just pick up these scriptures but abraham is called our father abraham jesus refers to him as our father abraham he's called the father of faith he's the great patriarch so when we begin to think about even the christian faith and we think about the father of faith we think of one man abraham and there are over 400 billion followers of abraham in the world today he has a birth three different religions judaism christianity and islam nearly 60 of the whole world or abrahamic religions that's a lot of people one man has over 4 billion followers that look to him as the father of their faith and the one that began their religion and abraham's faith i think we could all agree is a legendary faith if we were to say nama name a character of faith and tell us someone who is faithful you'd have to start with abraham because he is the father of faith he's the epitome of faith and it's a legendary faith and and when we look at his faith and how the bible speaks of it even the different scriptures we've read already we see that his faith was unwavering called those things that were not as though they were and who against hope believed in hope and when everything was said against him i mean still persevered and when we look at him we can applaud his faith and we can honor his faith and lift up his faith and maybe perhaps we think that his faith is unreachable but i want it to become more realistic for us james chapter 2 verses 20 to 22. just read this portion it says but will thou all wilt thou know o vain man that without faith without works uh that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar since thou how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect that was a real beautiful thought maybe if the lord would lead we could amplify this more on sunday but james is saying that abraham's faith was made perfect reached its full and supreme expression so this was supreme faith it reached its fullness and and was complete when he offered isaac his son upon the altar and i think it's a very peculiar word if you read this to anybody who wasn't familiar with the scripture that you know i know this guy whose faith was manifested perfectly when he was willing to sacrifice his only son i might seem a little bit odd but this is where abraham's faith reaches its supreme expression when he offered up isaac his son upon the altar and it's something to think about why is that why was that supreme faith why was that the full expression of his faith but it was through this this instance and this moment in abraham's life didn't happen at the beginning it's happening at a critical juncture at a time in which god had fulfilled his promises and and kept his his word to abraham and it was something he did out of faith and the word of god is saying that's when abraham's faith was made perfect when he offered up isaac his son and just a few statements very brief statements from the message just so you can kind of pick up where see where i'm identifying abraham as such a great example of the supreme faith brother branham says abraham was the example what all he was going to do to abraham he was going to do to him and his seed so abraham is an example whatever god did to abraham he does to his seed he's going to do he did it to abraham he'll do it to his seed we are his seed he says in the message influence he was showing an example of what he was going to do in the last days so abraham's life gives us a foreshadowing or a type of what he's going to do in the last days he says in the sermon god is identified by his characteristic in one day when god seen that his servant was determined to be an example for people today if you go home and you read james chapter 2 and just begin to think about it and examine it and ask yourself how does this relate to where we are in the end time you begin to see how that abraham's life was set forth as an example for our faith today he was going to show in abraham an example of what god was going to do in the last days and what he did to abraham he does to his seed after him and even though and even in that if i could say this i think it already begins to emphasize this point that abraham is not set before us as an idol but he's set before us as an example i don't we don't worship him and we're not idolizing his faith but god wants his faith to become practical to us because he's to be an example to us in the last days he was an example for people today what god did to abraham he's going to do to you so then abraham's life is not something that we venerate in honor but something that we recognize is for us because abraham's faith was simple and it was practical to where it it actually came to a place where it was so simple and practical but it matured to supreme it matured to uh uh to grow into the supernatural works that we see in his life and in hebrews chapter 12 verse two this is speaking of us we look unto jesus the author and finisher of our faith so christ is the leader the originator of our faith but he is also the original or the perfecter the finisher of our faith and if we could even just bring this into our view tonight faith has an origin and faith has a destiny amen if we if we recognize that our faith had a beginning in our lives i began to believe and this is when i became a christian and this when the word of god began to open up to me and we can generally point back uh to a time especially people who are here on a wednesday night there's something real that's happened we have a saying at our church uh there and i was i meant to bring greetings from the church there in phoenix arizona believers church forgot to do it you can show just how good i am at this but greetings from all the believers there in phoenix at arizona believer's church but we have a saying that if you go to church on sunday morning you love church if you go to church on sunday evening you love your pastor and that's why we don't have an evening service at our church and then if you go if you go on wednesday nights you love the word so i know you're here because you love the word and and you can those of you who are in love with the word you can look back and identify the time when that began to be awakened inside of you my faith has a beginning but don't ever forget it has a destiny your faith has an origin and it also has a destiny and if you leave the destiny side out we're always looking back it's easy to get discouraged but christ is not only the author or the originator of our faith but he is the perfecter of our faith so what he started he will finish and so let's look at the genesis of abraham's faith so we can catch this example of our faith has an origin it also has a destiny and we want to recognize this in abraham's life because paul writes in first corinthians 15 19 if in this life only we have hope in christ we are of all men most miserable now that's that's a scripture to think about for a while that if we in this life only have hope in christ then christians are the most miserable people in the world that's exactly what paul's saying that if your hope is only in this life then we of all men are most miserable and so the key to our our being the most happy people in all the earth isn't necessarily what's in this life but what is in the life to come because we do not just have hope in this life only but in the life become that's why we of all men are the most happy because we have a we have a life to come we have a hope in christ that's beyond time beyond what we're living in now so if we look at the genesis of abraham's faith let's look at hebrews chapter 11. i think i just have a few verses here to read and it describes abraham this way it says by faith abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went now i'm reading some of these things his background before we actually read in genesis about the life of abraham but i want you to catch how how much it's amplified by the writers in the new testament it says by faith when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for inheritance obeyed and he didn't know where he was going god asked him to begin to journey without telling him the ultimate destination he says by faith he soldier and he continued he he lived in the land of promise as in a strange country so it's promised to him but he's a stranger it's his but he's a foreigner by faith he soldiered in the land of promises in a strange country dwelling in tabernacles with isaac and jacob the heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose builder and maker is god abraham though he lived in the land of promise as a foreigner was looking for an ultimate destination that was permanent a city that had foundations not just pitching these temporary tents and these temporary dwellings and always being able to wrap up and move on eventually he wanted a place that had foundation an eternal home an eternal city whose builder and maker is god amen and in romans chapter 4 verse 12 we believe we already read it he says and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised so there's that puts us in the pattern of abraham that he is the father of us all and we are to walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham if he has a legendary faith if he had a perfect faith if he had a faith it's hard to understand your calling is still yet his walk in the very same steps of that faith of our father abraham so this is what you want to claim tonight and just believe you possess that faith that's the takeaway from this scripture that we walk in the steps of that faith of our father abraham though it may seem to be legendary by this scripture i believe that we possess the same faith of abraham and then he says we walk in the steps of that faith and we are to perform the same exercise of that faith abraham's what we'll call we'd call the parent believer he's the father of our faith he's the parent believer he's the model of justification by faith uh and we are walking after his type he is the parent believers he is the type that we are following in he's the first example of this faith says in isaiah chapter 51 verses 1 and 2 hearken to me ye that follow after righteousness ye that seek the lord look into the rock once you're hewn into the hole of the pit which you are digged look under abraham your father and unto sarah that bear you for i have called him alone and blessed him and increased really abraham was that rock they were hewn from it says i called him alone and blessed him and increased him and so you that follow after righteousness and seek me look at what i have brought you out of from look at the pit from which you were digged abraham is your consider abraham your father look to him look at him as the example of how i called him alone and blessed him and increased him telling israel he's your example you are hewn from him he's your example even in new testament he is our example of faith brother branham in the sermon possessed in the gate of the enemy after trial and the patriarch was faithful to call to his call and the promised word he was an example to what we should be abraham was an example to what we should be so there in hebrews it says he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive abraham's faith begin this is where i want you to start identifying with abraham's faith begin when god called him when he was called to go out into a place that says he obeyed abraham's faith began when god called him and this is the basis for all true faith it's that faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of the lord that it's got to be our faith is birthed by god calling it to us and speaking to us and if we start there at this very moment if we can say look at this i'm going to go through this in greater detail that abraham as the bible says he called him alone and blessed him and increased him he says look at the pit that you've been dug out of the rock that you've been hewn out of abraham's faith began when god called him and that should start to make abraham's faith a little bit more relatable genesis chapter 12 and that will just if you could keep your bible close to you we'll probably just walk through a number of scriptures in in genesis a few of them at least and so this is where abraham's faith began by faith abraham when he was called to go into a place that he should after receive for a promise says he obeyed and here's where we begin to see the life of abraham in genesis chapter 12 verse 1 now the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee this the way that the scripture describes it is it's telling us that god had already spoke to him the lord had said unto abram get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and from thy father's house so there was things that he had to do he had to get out of his country he had to get away from the kindred and ultimately he had to separate from his father's house and he says unto a land that i will show thee and hebrews told us that he left uh not knowing where he was going and that god would just show him later he's go there i read these statements in a couple places and i thought they were just so tremendous it said god did not immediately make known the land to him so that it might be lovely in his eyes he didn't show him where he was going he wanted he wanted it just to he wanted to bring him to it for him to see it he says he knew not where he was as a man that was in the dark so he says abraham get up and all he knew is he had to leave his homeland he had to leave his kindred and ultimately he knew he had to leave his family and so the bible says in genesis chapter 11 verses 27 and 28 it says now these are the generations of terror terror begat abram nehor and haran and haran begat lot and heron died before his father tara in the land of his nativity in ur of the chaldees this is where abraham has come comes from it says get the out of thy country he's coming out of the land of ur of the chaldees he is kind of describing his family tara uh is his father nehor haran are his brothers and then it mentions his his nephew lord who came from his brother haran says here they are in chaldea in in ur in the land of the counties and this signifies to us they're in babylon and there in babylon are all are idol worshipers i think that's something maybe we don't think about very often abraham was a gentile he was an idol worshiper it was just among the nations uh you didn't have hebrews then you didn't have the jews you didn't have a a religion you just had idol worshipers and there was and they'd made idols out of the things that they could see they worshiped the sun they saw the sun and they worshipped it they worshipped the moon because they saw the moon there were certain things and elements in nature that they worshipped and if they had a god they fashioned an image like unto it and they worshipped that image and you'd find these images were strewn throughout babylonia and there's even along the trade routes there was large altars that were erected as tributes to false deities and it's just it's really a logical conclusion that abraham and his family were all idol worshipers there's some that dispute that but the bible says in joshua 24 2 that tara the father of abraham and the father nehor and they served other gods that's what the bible says in joshua 24 that they served other gods so when abraham is called he's not called out of a christian family he's not called from job's family believing in god he's not called from a great lineages of parents and grandparents who believed in the one true god but abraham is called out of idolatry called out of unbelief he's called out of just worshiping things that they knew that had power they had substance and they there was something maybe tangible to the things that they tried to worship but there was nothing remotely akin to faith and this is abraham's condition when god calls him out of er of the counties it says in genesis chapter 15 verse 7 and this is the lord now describing how he brought abraham out and he said unto him i am the lord that brought thee out of ur of the counties to give thee this land to inherit amen so god had called him out of the land even though he didn't know where he was going and he brings them to this place to give you this land for an inheritance this is why we call it the promised land because this is the land that god had promised abraham and it really is a future promise and so he could think of this his origin when god calls him there in ur in the land of the counties but then god brings into a place says this is the land i'm going to give you and now he's showing him destiny in nehemiah chapter 9 verse 7 it says thou art the lord the god who did us choose abraham and brought us him forth out of ur of the chaldees and gave us him the name of abraham so it's god that chose abraham chose him there in the in the in the land of the chaldees and ur the counties among idol worshipers with family that are idol worshipers it's god that chose them and brought him out of earth the chaldees and changes his name and gave him this land of promise just picking up several scriptures that tell the story and in acts chapter 7 verses 2 to 4. he said men and brother and fathers hearken the god of glory appeared unto our father abraham when he was in mesopotamia before he dwelt in quran and said unto him get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred and come into the land which i shall show thee then came he out of the land of the chaldeans and dwelt in heroin and from thence when his father was dead he removed him into this land wherein you now dwell these scriptures are just telling abraham's journey he starts in ur and he travels out and we know the uh i believe most of us are familiar that he gets as far as quran and there he lives with his father he's there with his with his family his extended family he's in his father's house and there he is dwelling together with his father and with his family and the bible says that even from then he had to get out of that when his father was dead he came down and lived in the land of promise this is the journey of abraham out of earth in the koran down into the promised land and so in genesis chapter 11 let's start with verse 29 i i don't know if i read i maybe read a couple of these already but this is just background in genesis chapter 12. i hope it's not uh jumping around or confusing for you i know it's just real simple wanting to get some of these uh scriptures out before you to consider genesis chapter 11 verses 29 to 32 it says abram and nehor took them wives the name of abram's wife was sarah and the name of nehor's wife was milka the daughter of haran the father of milka and the father of iska but sarah was barren she had no child this is should help us to understand and relate that abraham's situation was one and which those around them are being blessed they're having children but abraham and his wife are unable to have children and it's kind of striking that it's put in this that sarah was barren and she had no child it says and tara took abraham his son took abram his son and lot the son of haran his son's son and sarah his daughter-in-law his son abram's wife and they went forth with them from ur the chaldees to go into the land of canaan and they came unto her on and dwelt there and the days of terror were 205 years and terah died in haran now what stands out to you as being a little bit different in this reading than what we read in nehemiah in acts chapter 7 genesis chapter 15 and these other places that we've already read even in isaiah 51 here as we read it in genesis chapter 11. this is the background to verse to genesis chapter 12. genesis chapter 12 says now the lord had said unto abram this is why you find what takes place in verses 29 to 32 of chapter 11 because god has spoken to abraham god spoke to abraham to get up and leave er the chaldees and what happens the whole family is going and so abraham and his and his brother they take wives and they and his brother has children and it says tara took abram and his and his and his grandson and although it was god that spoke to abraham tara as the father is honored as the leader but the bible wants us to know they laughed because god had said unto abraham god spoke unto abraham that's that's why they're leaving and we might find this true in our lives there's times when god speaks to us there might be a lot of other people that are moving along with us but it's faith when you know that god has spoken to you if you can be walking in the pattern of abraham it's not enough that everyone kind of gets the idea and we all go along with it but god has to have spoken directly to you so it's at the at the end of chapter 11 it ends with them being halfway between ur and canaan they're in that place in acts where it's called quran or in the in the genesis heron this is where they are they're halfway between ur and the promised land halfway in the journey and as abraham is halfway in the journey he's there he's left but he's not all the way and it's then that the bible says the lord hath said unto abram get thee out of that country and from thy kindred from thy father's house unto a land that i will show thee and in verse 2 it says and i will make of thee a great nation and i will bless thee and i will make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and i will bless them that bless thee and curse them that curseth thee and in these shall all families of the earth be blessed i think it's become common to us because the nation of israel is so pronounced so established we call them israelites they call them the seed of abraham we know their promised land all the even the physical condition the physical promises but god is saying that from one man abraham i will make of thee a great nation and i will make thy name great and all and all in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed see there's going to be a nation whose origin is faith in one god i'm going to call you there's going to be a people who can trace their origin back to being called from this one true god and in genesis chapter 14 verse 13 i don't know if you've this is something that's really easy to miss we know we call them hebrew children the hebrews but this is where the name comes from genesis chapter 14 verse 13 and there came one that had escaped and telling the story of lots capture and told abram the hebrew this is what others called abram abram wasn't one that necessarily called himself a hebrew but when he had come and traveled into the promised land they looked at abraham and they called him a hebrew which means one who's crossed over one from beyond so when abraham traveled down out of ur down through haran and came down to the promised land he was one that they looked at had crossed over he had come down into their land he was one that was traveling and so when we call when abraham is called to hebrew it was because he was one that was he was a foreigner he was one that kind of crossed over and he was one from beyond and i believe that little did they know they were attributing to abraham something that had a deeper meaning because he was one from beyond he was one that had crossed over from a life of just natural things and natural senses into a life of faith and therefore to be a hebrew is not to have your origin in natural things but to really understand that you come from something eternal and you're going to go back to something eternal abram was a hebrew because he had crossed over and had traveled down into this promised land with a promise that god would make him a great nation he would make his name great and in abraham all families of the earth would be blessed it says in galatians 3 29 if you be christ then are ye abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise you're abraham's seed the seed is the one the thing that contains the german the one that has the dna that determines the development and so it's important for us to recognize our dna when we look at abraham we're looking at we're looking at our dna we're looking at our ancestry there's people that don't know maybe who their father is or their mother or they have certain uh certain things come up and they want to start looking at family history we go to the doctor for checkup they ask you questions about your family history why because it's relevant amen certain things exist in your family then they expect them to show up in your life and they want to know certain things about you the health of your mom the health of your dad how far back does it go because it's kind of projecting what your physical makeup is like and the same thing for us as the seed of abraham you are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise he holds for us the phenotype or the example of what we are to become his faith is very relatable he was called out of unbelief called out as an idol worshipper when he called out all he was he was just following god didn't know where he was going is that not how it is for all of us we've only responded to a call of god we're not quite sure where this is going to cause us to end up but we only know to follow god well john would have you ever imagined that this is where you'd be having church 21 years later you passed by this building dozen times a day a municipal building a government building used for other purposes and all you know to do is just put one foot where god's telling you to step and he doesn't tell you the end it's a good thing because you probably would have tried to buy it then or just show everybody out this is mine god showed me this is mine but there's a certain way that god wants us to grow and to mature in our faith being created to be able to possess our inheritance and possess the things he wants to give us and so abraham is our example we need to look into and you'll just maybe you could do it on your own in your own study is begin to recognize family characteristics that you have as a believer in the life of abraham amen amen special characteristics of this nation that god said would exist brother branham and the sermon faith says now we're speaking tonight upon faith i thought it would be nice maybe we could use this great character of abraham for an example of faith because it was to abraham the promise was given and we'll kind of review the life of abraham just a little a little because he was an outstanding character he was a man who believed god and now he had no great background to believe god because it's commonly believed that he was from a family of idolaters he gained town from babylon his family dwelt in their land of chaldea the city of earth the valleys of shinar and was just an ordinary man he wasn't an angel he was just a man like you and i abraham was just a man like you and i he says nothing that that not an angel comes from a family of idolaters he was just a man like you and i it says in the sermon jehovah jair he says abraham was just an ordinary man he wasn't any different from any of us just the same people today when they see god put a gift in the church some people tries to stand that person up as some great big outstanding something well that's wrong you got your mind on the person then instead of on christ we're all just the same the bible said that elijah was a man subject to like passions as we are he just had the same ups and downs that we have now my people formerly are catholic you all know that and they're great on holy man holy man but to me it's not a holy man it's a holy god that's right it's god is the object we're men all the same it says notice but abraham was just an ordinary man came down from babylon and he dwelt there in the land of shinar this is where i i like how brother branham can just do this in the way of telling a story and perhaps his diet was go in of a morning and pick some berries from the bushes go back out and kill an animal and have his noonday meal and some more berries for supper and so forth so i'm not quite sure does it sound like intermittent fasting doesn't sound like keto or the carnivore diet maybe a combination of that maybe just the right kind of corn carnivore diet because you're just eating the whole natural fruits and avoiding all the processed things so there's an abraham diet i'm sure that we can gather from this quote sure somebody will be working on it tomorrow and let us know all the details soon but abraham said just pick some berries from the bushes go out and kill some an animal for his noonday meal some berries for supper he's just showing this is just an abraham this is his ordinary life we think of abraham as this great great legendary faith and we think that perhaps when he was young he was he was fasted in praying as a as a child and he had access to all sorts of materials and the way that he lived his life what was so far beyond the life that we would lead but he's just saying here that it's a very simple life he had breakfast he ate lunch and he had dinner he was married to his half-sister her name was sarah and while abraham being just an ordinary man god chose abraham by election not because he was different from any other man but it was because that god's election has to stand sure can't you see how much more easily we can identify with abraham nothing special about him we try to figure out well how can my faith be like abraham look at abraham's life look at his faith he's eating berries for breakfast see barry's for dinner he's uh he's having he's killing an animal for lunch there's nothing supernatural about his life there's nothing in his regular routine of the day that would speak out this is a man of faith this is different abraham's been set apart he wasn't the subject of conversation in his neighborhood man abraham's different abram he's a different guy man he's he's different he's going to be special no he's a berry eater like everybody else he has to hunt his food just like everybody else promise he's just an ordinary man and that god chose them not because he was different than any other man but he chose them because it was god's choice and i realized that election can be really really hard for us to get our minds around it and i read where it was attributed to luther one time and i have since not been able to find it but uh it's just one of those things where you just know that you read it and i don't know why it's that way i'm trying to remember the effect that they call it but where they said that luther said to uh you you die trying to figure out predestination or you lose your mind trying to figure out predestination but you'll lose your soul denying it and it's very very difficult to try to figure out election well how does it how does my choice fit how does this work and how does that work you just have to accept that god chose abraham was placed on the basis of free more agency yes he had the chance to choose he had the opportunity to choose but he never had a choice to be a son god didn't mention you want to be my son no god made him his son god chose him to be a son and in that way we can identify with abraham i'm no special than anybody else except that god has chosen me and it's upon this basis alone that we speak about abraham today abraham is known today simply because god revealed himself to him and i'm just going to be ending on this thought i realized that um service starting at 7 30 and then you start preaching at eight man it's late it gets really really late so i'll just be long-winded on sunday this is a warning maybe only a few people that show up that might not be very wise but do i need to take that back okay good brother mark will be here and that's all we need two we got two that's what we need got the song leader in the preacher we'll have church abraham is a legend today for one reason god revealed himself to him that's the true legacy of abraham that's the the the singular significant characteristic of abraham's life faith in god true faith faith in the one god faith in the god of creation amen and the bible says as we've been reading the lord had said unto abram get out of that country from thy kindred from thy father's house i'll make you a great nation make thy name great and thee all the families of the earth will bless so in verse 4 it says so abraham departed this is his testimony think about it abraham is just eating berries for breakfast and dinner and having meat for lunch and one day god speaks to him and says get out of your country away from your kindred and from your father's house and and to a place i'll show you later i'm not going to tell you where you're going you just need to start leaving and the bible says abraham departed as the lord had spoken to them that's it this is what happened the lord had said unto abram and spoke to abram and he says he departed just as the lord had spoke to him and lot went with them and abram was 75 years old when he departed out of haran so god had spoke to him it was god that had let him out it's god who's leading them and he's in that next step of the journey where he has to separate from his father's house but then lot goes with them and i know these are just a few verses of the lord speaking to abram and telling him to get out of his country from his country from his kindred and from his family but we've got to it's important for us to grasp the circumstances that are expressed here it's important for us to even understand the exact situation that's in these verses because it's very critical to understanding our faith there's a there's just an unassuming simplicity in it i know there's just things that that we we want to make out to be very very great but it was just an ob this obedient faith is born in this very scripture that we're reading it's born and it's a faith that's going to change the entire world so a faith that's going to change all of humanity and when you read about abraham it's not wealth that makes them stand out is you read the narrative as you try to figure out who abraham was it's not wealth that makes him who he is there's no wars that make him great right he doesn't rebel and cause a civil war in ur he doesn't defend against invaders in the land of the chaldeans there's nothing of that that makes his name great as you look at the history of abraham there's no laws that he that are ascribed to him there's no art that he's to be the originator of there's no armies there's no science there's nothing about aim there's no not even lands that are attributing him that makes abraham famous there's one thing that makes abraham famous it's his faith nothing else do you look at his history try to find out what made abraham so great wasn't his wealth wasn't his family wasn't his contributions to science or the arts it was simply his faith abraham represents faith in god a god that was personally revealed to abraham and so as abraham travels we're just wanting to consider this journey it comes out of earth the land of counties comes to haran and the lord had spoken to him and told him to go so he departs and he begins to leave he departs out of haran and he's going to come to that place that god had showed him and as he travels towards canaan he's in obedience to god's command he's got faith in the promise one commentary i'd read said get thee out of thy country from thy kindred and from thy father's house unto a land that i'll show thee this was god's first revelation of himself to abraham up to this time abraham to all appearance had no knowledge of any god but the deities worshiped by his fathers in caldea now he finds within himself impulses which he cannot resist in which he is conscious that he ought not to resist he believes it to be his duty to adopt a course which may look foolish in which he can justify only by saying that his conscience bids him he recognizes apparently for the first time that through his conscience there speaks to him a god who is supreme in dependence on this god he gathered his possessions together and departed as i was thinking about this today i was thinking i'm so glad abraham did it so that i could have the example that god wants to start something in abraham so now once he has worked with abraham and called him in this manner it's abraham's testimony that eventually becomes the old testament right because it's the story of abraham and his seed to whom the promise is given and then the fulfillment of that promise to his seed is the new testament so that we don't have to go by impulse alone we have a word that's been preserved for us we have an example that we can look to and go by he says that abraham had by all appearance had no knowledge of a god other than the false deities worshiped by his family but then god speaks to him and as god speaks to me finds an impulse deep inside of him which he cannot resist and he knows that he should not resist and he feels compelled that i must follow the leading of this god i must follow the leading of this spirit and though it may seem foolishness to everyone else around me but i must do it and he knows now there's a god who is supreme because none of the other deities could speak they could just imagine a a a a a a voice they could just prostrate themselves before these idols and desire that they speak but this was a god that could speak to them and the most important to me the most incredible aspect is here's everyone worshiping physical things worshiping nature and the god of nature speaks to abraham in a supernatural way he sees no vision he sees no man but god speaks to him and he knows this is who i ought to follow that's why this is a fa the father of our faith as he didn't put his faith in the flesh he didn't put his faith in an altar he didn't put his faith faith in a man or some sort of image it was faith in a god that spoke to his heart he says i know this is god i know this is the supreme i know this is the one that is greater than everyone else and so it's faith in the word that compelled abraham it wasn't curiosity it wasn't a columbus wasn't just trying to go and discover new lands or get away from his father so he can be on his own abraham didn't leave for notoriety he didn't leave for wealth he didn't leave for family abraham left following god and brother ram tells us he's chosen out of all humanity a normal man just like you or i and god chooses him out of all humanity to walk with him abraham didn't step forth from the breath of god the bible tells us that we're to follow the in the steps of christ and we begin to think about christ we think wow he was he bypassed the virgin birth or he bypassed the sexual birth he came born as a virgin and he comes knowing who his father was and he lives a sinless life and he never never does anything wrong i think that's my example and it can be very very hard for us in our carnal minds to think that i can ever be like christ regardless of what the scriptural promises are but maybe we can begin by identifying that we can be like abraham abraham was born of a woman just like your eye a man with passions just like your eye struggles and trials if you go and look into his life abraham's life is not just this picture of perfection abraham had problems abraham had struggles he had difficulties had ups and downs he had he had opposition but abraham's faith is what survives it all as something that should be admired abraham didn't step forth from the breath of god he came forth as humanity just like your eye when abraham begins to walk out of ur and he comes down in haran and he ultimately ends up in the promise of it's not famine that drives them out it's not war that drives them out but he's under the influence of an unseen god think of it amid idol worshipers idolatrous all bowing to the things that can be seen abraham bows to the invisible his families are idolaters they're in a land of idolatry but it's from that pedigree that god chooses abraham and the bible says in abraham departed this is the first step in a lifetime of obedience to the supreme the first step into a lifetime of an example for us brother branham in the masterpieces now he's doing the same thing in his ever-changing method we find out in malachi 3 he said i'm god and i change not he cannot change his method i think this statement is so amazing now as he started in abraham after the fall of the first masterpiece he started in abraham on a foundation to build another masterpiece so in the fall when god promised genesis 3 15 that the seed of the woman would crush the head of the serpent god does not start to bring forth that masterpiece until the bible says and he called abraham said the lord said unto abram abram is the beginning of the restoration of the fall of the masterpiece abraham is the beginning he says he started a neighbor on a foundation to build another masterpiece and what did it climax in christ abraham is the beginning of abraham he's the seed of the masterpiece he's the beginning of the masterpiece and he started in abraham to build back that masterpiece and he says he started on the day of pentecost to build another masterpiece the original seed word started in the first church what was it the seed word the word manifest the promise that had been given so just as abraham's promise culminated in jesus christ brethren says on the day of pentecost there's seed sown of another masterpiece and you are that masterpiece what is the bride another masterpiece in the making he says she's the new testament that's all seems a little bit dismissive if i'm going to be that's all that's what i want to be is the new testament so abraham was the seeds of jesus christ and jesus christ was the perfection and the fulfillment of abraham's faith and we too are the perfection and the fulfillment of the faith of the church we are following in the pattern of abraham who upon god's call god says follow me and abraham departed the first step in a lifetime of obedience to an unseen god it says in matthew chapter 1 verse 1 the book of the generation of jesus christ the son of david the son of abraham the son of david brings into view the king in the kingdom that the son of abraham brings into view humanity the son of man so you have the root the foundation and you have the the throne he calls abraham not a king not a deity not a sovereign just a normal man but he says he is the son of david christ is the son of david the son of abraham how could he be that because there's your root in offspring the root the foundation being abraham the son of man the humanity but then the deity the kingdom the bible says we read it already you are abraham's seed and heirs according to the promise you know a seed is the grain of a plant that holds the future plants that's what a seed is there's something reserved in the seed as a germ he says and if you be christ then you're abraham's seed there was something there's something in the image of abraham that was a germ of a new race the modern events made clear by prophecy he says we are supposed to be the royal seed of abraham isaac was the natural seed but the faith seed the faith and the promised word the promised word don't miss it was that royal seed that was the seed abraham's faith we've been dead in christ we are abraham's seed heirs with him according to the promise and the seed holds the mystery of the plant if you ever seen a seed they had an issue a couple years ago where people receive it in their from amazon or just from packages overseas just packages of seeds they had no idea what they were they're coming from china and nobody well what is this what what what have i received and and they wouldn't know what it was until they planted it and it would grow and so the department of agriculture saying whatever you do don't plant the seeds don't grow them turn them over to us we don't don't want invasive species but you can look at a seed and in that seed it holds the mystery of the plant and so even in abraham's life if you take the time of just introduce i know it's very very basic very very fundamental very simple apologize if i failed you tonight but i just wanted to share these things in a very simple way uh hopefully to be able to build on it sunday abraham then as the seed held the mystery of christ if the seed holds the mystery of the plant and abraham then it has is the beginning of this and he lays the foundation his life holds the mystery of christ and the life of abram then holds the mystery of the foundation of simple faith supreme faith is a is is the faith that we have to rise up to the supreme faith is the faith that we have to have in this hour but look at the life of abraham and see that he lived an ordinary life of following the plan of god the ordinary life of just doing what god told them and it was through the faith in god if there was any exploits it was god that did them because abraham believed my last statement tonight from the sermon from that time he says let's take for instance abraham he was just an ordinary man he came down from babylon with his father he dwelt in the land of caldeas in the city of ur probably a farmer an ordinary man he was no special man he was just a man and he found grace in the sight of god and god told him when he was 75 years old that he was going to make him a father of nations and that he was going to give him a child by his wife sarah who was 65 years old at the time and abraham believed god it was imputed in him for righteousness that's it abraham believed god that's the testament of image no special man he was just a man he says probably a farmer so what was abraham doing when god spoke to him he's just farming so he's doing picking berries going out killing killing something to eat for the midday meal so he's probably just a farmer he was just farming when god came and spoke to him and supreme faith brother brahm said it's just going to be the regular routine to follow in the scriptures in the plan of god it's just going to be by living your life we don't have to go out chasing the fantastic we don't have to try to find some pie in the sky just stay faithful to what god called you to do stay faithful to the word of god live a simple life do the things that you know you ought to do as a christian because it's from the regular routine it might seem to be the mundane it might seem to be just the oh the the ho-hum and the hum drum of life but that's where god manifests himself that's where you're going to hear from god that's where god is going to make himself known and it's just as abraham lived that his faith received its realization it's and as the bible says that as abraham offered up isaac his son therein was his faith made perfect it was just to live in his life that his faith was entirely exemplified it was just to live in his life that it was filled up he wasn't chasing vindication he wasn't chasing a moment to where he would have enough faith to do something powerful he was just doing what god told him to do as he continued and my prayer would be that for all of us we could just take this into our hearts and have this kind of dedication that we would desire that god would bring forth from us this glorious mystery of faith how by ordinary people living ordinary lives and just by living an ordinary life the supernatural unfold in its simplicity in our daily life could we stand tonight abraham was living just an ordinary life nothing outstanding nothing remarkable but god called him he says and he believed god that's what we can do you know for the young people that's all you can do is when god speaks you just believe him just answer to that call and say lord i believe in you lord i'm going to trust in you could we bow our heads tonight i appreciate your patience i know these things were are just incredibly simple and foundational maybe you could offer a hand to the lord if you need prayer and say lord i i i believe help my unbelief lord i want my faith to become a supreme faith i want to become supreme to what i've had to this point i want more faith and i don't believe that that would uh offend god tonight if our prayer was for more faith our gracious heavenly father lord as we are standing in your presence tonight having fellowship together around these scriptures and these quotations i trust lord not from my vantage point but from the here's vantage point i i pray lord that there's been something quicken to them and it's just at the beginning of this thought and subject that abraham is someone that we can relate to ordinary man nothing special or outstanding about him just a simple ordinary life a farmer a gatherer or a hunter from a family of unbelievers but you called him and in him was an impulse a drive and a desire that he could not walk away from he knew they ought to heed it and lord if there be anyone here tonight that has resisted that call resisted that voice may they yield to you lord may they accept you there be any that are getting weary in the journey lord encourage their faith there's a payoff coming lord it's going to be worth it all one day i pray that you would encourage them to believe for the impossible to believe for the destiny lord lord for this church so we see you blessing them and increasing them we see them growing lord may they recognize that it's all been done by simple faith yielding to you our resources yielding to you the things that we have taking what was in our hands and consecrating it to you and what you could do to one man yielded what you could do through one man that's yielded what you could do through just the simple things that we have lord all the volumes that could be written just from this work alone we could just yield ourselves to you not to try to have our name on a marquee not to do something popular not to get attention but just as abraham left and obeyed lord may we likewise follow you and may the supreme faith that can only come by following the scripture may it rise up within us lord commit the people to you tonight those that lifted their hands desiring more faith desire and encouragement a quickening lord i pray that you would grant it we thank you for this time that we've had together tonight in the name of the lord jesus christ amen amen and he is here hallelujah is here [Music] i will bless his name again he is

in all of our reach we are just like abraham we were in the same place that he was just being called out from of our family who were idol worshipers come on and uh and if it wasn't our family it was our family's family you know yeah um but we have the same i i love to say we have the same genes but i just want to say it like this to make it in our reach if we're questioning that all we have to do is believe and we believe by obeying the call how important it is when we come to church we hear the word you know what we're doing we're hearing god call us amen amen he and and he tells us okay now you've been walking this way i want you to go this way and this way in every step that we're taking in the steps of our father abraham their steps leading us to the promised land and so we don't this is how important it is to be in tune with the lord when we come to church because this is a journey for all of us for abraham's children i really appreciated that message god is hid in simplicity that's where we're going to find him that's where we're going to see him i'm really looking forward to the service on sunday amen let's be in prayer not only for brother aaron but let's be in prayer for us that we can catch the revelation of the word and and it and be benefited amen amen and and we got some time to invite somebody too you know and you could your labors could lead them to christ amen amen um we we have some refreshments after the service and we just want to allow a little time for those who could fellowship just for a little bit before you leave um just know it's available those that you've got to get home and drive where you just do what you have to do but we just want to at least have this time we didn't really have as much time as we wanted to have with our brother but um maybe get a chance to to get with him and tell him how much you appreciate him amen let's continue to pray for uh those uh who are are not here who would want to be here but their their their bodies uh are are afflicted and let's just continue to pray for them and let's not forget we have a youth service just for the youth adults are not allowed we probably could use a deacon or two though that's proper in every uh in every service to have no not me this time so that's going to be at uh five o'clock on saturday and we want to come with our best manners and expecting that it's not for the adults it's just for you amen so we're excited about that and excited that our brother aaron is going to be the one bringing the word to us amen amen well god bless you god be with you amen we're going to be dismissed in a word of prayer now can ask our brother jonathan if you would dismiss us in prayer god bless you
