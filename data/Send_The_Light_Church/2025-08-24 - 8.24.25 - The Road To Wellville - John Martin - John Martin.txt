You just have to be willing to pray and then the Lord will lead you. So, let's just remember that it's always a good time for fellowship. We have our time here with the Lord, but it's good time to have fellowship with one another. Amen. So, let's just be praying for that and um I'm sure the Lord will reward us.

When the redeemed are gathering in that shoe. When the redeemed are gathering in wash like snow and free from all sin. How we'll shout and how we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in. There will be a great possession over on the streets of gold. When the redeemed are gathering in. Oh, what music? Oh, what singing on the city will be rolled. When the redeemed are gathering in. When the redeemed are gathering in, washed like snow and free from all sin. I will shout hallelujah. And how we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in.

Thank you, Lord Jesus, for filling us up. Amen. Praise God. I'd rather be a vessel for God than a vessel for the devil. &gt;&gt; We're one or the other. We are one or the other. Um, men may think, "No, I don't want nothing to do with either of them." But in reality, there's only two spirits. Amen. What a privilege it is to be a temple for the Lord, a sanctuary for God to dwell in, and so he can through us. As brother Ron was so graciously saying, share Christ with the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's our responsibility until we're out of here. Amen. To be doing that. Well, God bless you today. It's good to be in the house of of God's prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I I believe that we have uh Evelyn Lorie Sister and and Doug, God bless you. Good to have you here today. Amen. Praise the Lord. Amen. Amen. And what a blessing it is to see Um, Sister Brooke and you got you never had that one time where there's like a blanker. &gt;&gt; Tyler, that's right. Blair, too. I know. That's That's just terrible. Well, God bless you, Blair. God bless your precious family. We think of you often. Pray for you. And it's good to have you back home. Amen. back in the house of the Lord. Um, you can see uh Doug and Evelyn that I'm not I'm not embarrassed. I'm not afraid to be embarrassed because that's just who I am. Amen. Well, let's turn in our our Bibles today to Matthew chapter 7. And really what that that is, Brother Tyler, is is is it's like you just got that little stage fright there. I still have that feel like the first time I've been ministering every time I come up here. Yes. It's a well we we trust we can't can't help it. Turn with me if you would to Matthew chapter 7. We're going to read just two verses there. Have a word of prayer and enter into the word of the Lord. Pray that this service will be an encouragement to all of us today. Amen. Jesus speaking here in St. Matthew chapter 7 verse 13. Enter ye in at the straight gate, for wide is the gate, and broad is the way which leadth to destruction, and and many people be which go in there at. Because straight is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadth unto life, and just a few people there be that find it. Amen. Very sobering. Let's look to God in prayer. Our heavenly father, we thank you, Lord, that there is a place that we can gather as brothers and sisters in Christ. that we hold the same precious faith, that we love you, that we love your salvation, that we're crying, "Grace, grace, grace, and full of praise, full of power, and full of glory, all because of your amazing grace today." And Lord, we thank you that we could express oursel in in this worship through song and chorus. And Lord, we just invite you now through not only the ministry of the word, but the receiving of the word. We need you for both. Lord, be the inspiration of our heart. Help us to get out of the way that you may speak to your people that you may nurture, strengthen, and guide them today, Lord, through thy word. Father, we ask that you'd remember um Lord our sister uh uh Amanda today that you just touch your body and that you would uh bring uh wellness to her body. We pray and Father, we just ask that you'd meet every need as we commit the service now into your hand in Jesus Christ's precious name. Amen. Amen. To God be all the glory. You may be seated. We want to entitle this message the road to wellness. No, the I'm sorry. The well the road to Wellville. It's a town. It's a place. &gt;&gt; Wellville. Have you ever heard of it? Just know. It's not paved. And um Jesus here speaking in these scriptures entering at the straight gate. So it's a very narrow to even enter in the gate because there's only one way that leads to life. And narrow is the way. In other words, it's not paved. It's not easy. The word narrow here it means crowded with afflictions. So Jesus is saying enter the straight gate. It's crowded with afflictions with tribulations, troubles, pains, sorrows, challenges, afflictions. It's not easy, but it is the way which leadth to life. And the very fact that it's filled with all this stuff, not very many people are going to find it. It's not because Jesus is hard to get to. It's just the way to follow Jesus is not easy on the flesh. &gt;&gt; If a person wants to enter eternal life, it's more than just expressing a personal belief. It's more than just expressing um a repentance and baptism. It is u it's it's a difficult road to travel. If all we had to do was something at the beginning and then kind of go on living our life, it would be quite easy to enter in. &gt;&gt; But Jesus said, "It's he that endureth to the end, the same shall be saved, not he that starts the race." Starting is easy, but it's it's he who finishes the race. Let's say you're on the road to losing weight. Would you rather be able to take one pill a day and keep all the eating habits that you got? &gt;&gt; Or would you rather change your complete diet, suffer throughout the day with all your cravings, have to exercise, have to make sure you're looking at food and constantly resisting? Oh, no. I can't have it. I can't have it. Which would you rather do? &gt;&gt; Take the one pill. I mean, it's just natural. is no different spiritually. Statist statistics show that many people stop their diets early. We all know that because we we're one of them. We're one of the statistics with one survey finding 40% of the people quit within a week. Four out of 10 people quit within a week and only 20% reaching the threemonth mark. So the road to Wellville is is not an easy road. What is needed to make it to the end is perseverance is uh dedication. I is is commitment is is faith is confidence. It's it's optimism. It's a right mental attitude. It will bring it to pass. The prophet said it's our way to get to Wellville. Mark Jesus said in Mark 9 verse 23 if you want to write it down. Mark 9:23 if thou canst believe all things are possible to him that believeth. Whatever all things are possible if we can believe. Now that is that's that's so beautiful. That just opens the door of excitement. That opens the door to happiness. That opens the door to uh the pressure off because we have to walk this road that's this hard road and we got a lot of distractions and problems. But to know that the end result is as sure as God is sure, that's encouraging. &gt;&gt; Does anybody remember the children's story book from the early 1900s, the little engine that could? &gt;&gt; There was a need to get some cargo train over the mountain and they needed an engine to pull it and they asked a few great engines that were very well known. engine one, they asked, "But he was too proud and he was concerned about his appearances to to go over the mountain." The big freight engine was too busy and bothful to take on the challenging task, and the rusty old engine was too tired and believed he couldn't move another inch. Now, when the locomotives didn't have the courage to go over the mountain, they asked this little blue engine. And this little blue engine had never faced a challenging task like this before. It had never pulled heavy a a heavy train before. And neither did it ever go over that mountain before. It wasn't built to haul heavy freight or or passengers and things like that. But with tremendous courage, determination, it a positive attitude to accept the challenge. And up the hill it went. And you know what it was saying when it was going up the hill, right? I think I can. I think I can. And it started out slow, but it started getting momentum. &gt;&gt; Word upon word, faith upon here a little, there a little. I think I think I can. It started going and as it finally got the steam to get to the top. &gt;&gt; And when it got there, it said, "I knew I could. I knew I could." And we're all on this road. We've never been there before. We never got there. Amen. &gt;&gt; But we've got to have the same confidence. &gt;&gt; Because there's troubles and problems standing between us and Wellville. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in Mark 11:24, "Therefore I say unto you, whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe that you shall receive them, and ye shall have them." &gt;&gt; Whatever you desire when you pray, just believe and you'll have it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it won't be easy and it won't be the next day, but God doesn't lie. &gt;&gt; Put the desire of your heart on the table with God and believe for it. If you think you can, then you can. &gt;&gt; But if you don't think you can, you can't. &gt;&gt; It's It's really up to us. &gt;&gt; There were two blind men following Jesus desiring to be healed. cry and say, "Thou son of David, have mercy on us." I wonder how many times we've cried that in our lives. Have mercy upon us. And Jesus saith unto him, believe that I am able to do this. And they said unto him, "Yes, Lord." And Jesus touched them and saying, "According to your faith, be it unto you." Amen. &gt;&gt; Nothing to do with me. Nothing to do with these unbelievers over here. But whatever you believe, be it unto you. &gt;&gt; You know what that does? It just it takes all the pressure off of me of worrying about what brother and sister are thinking about me &gt;&gt; or where they're going to make it or not going to make it. Though none go with me, I still I will follow. &gt;&gt; Amen. because I'm go I'm on my road to Wellville. Jesus can get us there. He can get us there. A Canaanite woman had desired for her her daughter a healing and and she cried unto Jesus these same words, "Have mercy on me, O Lord. Have mercy on me." She was in she cared about her children. Amen. And she was saying, "Have mercy on me because I love my children. I love my daughter." She was grievously vixed. And the Bible says that she worshiped Jesus, &gt;&gt; saying, "Lord, help me." Sometimes we come to church and we can't even lift our hands. &gt;&gt; We come to church as if we don't got any needs or something. &gt;&gt; I mean, we just need to get serious with God. We have not because we asked not. But we need to ask for God to help us. Amen. And even though Jesus did not come to meet her need, it's a true statement. She still had a a right mental attitude. And she said, "Truth, Lord, yet the dogs eat the crumbs which fall from the master's table." And Jesus said unto her, "Oh woman, great is thy faith. Be it unto thee, even as thou will. Be it unto you as you will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you think you can, you can. &gt;&gt; If you don't think you can, you can't. If you think that I'm able to help you, I can. If you don't think I'm able to help you, then I can't. &gt;&gt; It doesn't change who God is. &gt;&gt; Just changes the outcome for our lives. Be it unto thee even as thou wilt. Whatsoever things you desire when you pray, believe, and ye shall have them. Jesus can help us on the road to Wellville. Jesus saith unto the father who who was caring about his son, if thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. And straightway the father of the child cried out and with tears the Bible says, "Lord, I believe. Help thou my unbelief." &gt;&gt; I'm a human. I I know what I'm dealing with. It's not perfect in here, but you know what? I'm stepping out in faith. Lord, I believe. Help my unbelief. &gt;&gt; We got to step out in faith. go beyond the complacency of our easy life that we're living because God is calling us to a greater thing. We're going to get into it the second half of the service, but he's I'll just say it like this. He's calling us to be in his image. &gt;&gt; We have to work through our unbelief. We have to work through our our afflictions, our troubles, our pains, our sorrows, our our our challenges, our difficulties. We have to work our way all the way to Wellville. I think I can all the way. Press towards the mark. The the ang that voice told brother Brand, "Keep pressing in. Keep pressing. There is nothing else to do. We got to press. As soon as you stop pressing, I'm going to tell you what happens. When you stop pressing, you go backwards. &gt;&gt; You do not stand still. You never stand still." The prophet of God says, "You never leave church the way you came. There is no standing still. It's either closer to God pressing in or you're backsliding. Don't even realize it. &gt;&gt; Proverbs 23:7 says, "As for as a man thinkketh in his heart, &gt;&gt; so is he." Amen. &gt;&gt; If you truly know, if you know, you you say, "I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. I know I can." &gt;&gt; And you can. But if you think in your heart, "I don't think I can ever get rid of this problem. This thing's been with me too long. I just don't think I can ever forgive. I just don't think I can love with an unconditional love, a perfect love. I just I don't think I can, you know, really be what I'm supposed to be. I I I I don't think I can I can do what is being asked of me. If that is what you think in your heart, so is it. But if there's someone here today &gt;&gt; with some confidence that can go beyond their human intellect and look to the word of God, all things are possible to him that believeth. &gt;&gt; Whatever you say in your heart &gt;&gt; as a man thinkketh in his heart. It's why it's important to guard your heart. Don't let doubt, though some may dwell where these abound, my prayer, my aim is higher ground. &gt;&gt; I can do all things through Christ who strengthenth me. If that's in your heart, then you can do all things. God told Joshua, "Nothing shall be nothing shall ever nothing shall be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life. Wherever the souls of your feet shall tread upon, it shall be yours. If you're thinking that mountain is mine, then you you go after it and that mountain will be yours. &gt;&gt; But if you say those giants, they're a little too big for me. I can't handle my problem. You can't handle the problem then. &gt;&gt; What you're saying is God is not strong enough in me. Because I'm telling you, God is able to do exceedingly above all that we would think or ask of him to do. That's the God we serve. We don't serve some dead God. &gt;&gt; He's a living God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's got power. And we just sung the song. It wasn't just a nice song to sing. There was a message in it. Full of grace, full of power, full of glory. We're full of God today, saints. &gt;&gt; In our heart, we should be full of God. There should be There's Is anything too hard for the Lord? &gt;&gt; Nothing's too hard for God. Philippians 1:6, "Being confident of this very thing, that he which have begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ." Remain confident that Jesus Christ will see you all the way to Wellville. &gt;&gt; I don't care what it is that you're desiring, what it is that you want, God will see you through. You have, but as you thinkketh in your heart, so shall it be. This has nothing to do I'm going to just get this real straight. This has nothing to do with God's will. This has everything Jesus said it has everything to do with your faith. It has everything to do with your confession. The Bible tells us that he is the inter intercession and it he intercedes upon the profession of our faith. &gt;&gt; So if we're saying he can then he can if we're saying I don't know it may not be God's will. That sounds to me like I'd rather go down drowning &gt;&gt; claiming God's will &gt;&gt; because he told me to. He didn't say, "Look, I made you all smart. You figure out what the will of God is for all the for all the promises." No. Every promise in the book is mine. Every chapter, every verse, every line, it's the devil that tells you you can't have victory. &gt;&gt; It's God saying there's victory ahead. &gt;&gt; It's at Wellville. You just keep marching forward. And I'm going to tell you, I'd be honest with you. I know this road is hard. We just read it. But the thing is, you know how you build up momentum that train that arm just I think I can I can when you go and you overcome one thing you're just faithful to get up and pray whatever it might be. Yeah. One thing it just now you got some momentum. You don't have to try as hard the second time. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's you're building self-esteem. You're building your confidence. You're building yourself up. Look, you either let the devil tear you down or you'll fight the good fight of faith and you'll press in. That's it. We can't sit here and and expect God to do it all. &gt;&gt; God's looking for the one thing he can't do, and that's go through your free moral agency. But when your freemore agency can agree with the word of God and say for me in my house I'll serve the Lord. &gt;&gt; Then all things are going to be possible in home. &gt;&gt; We sing that song. I am one of the few. Yes, one of the few. And by faith in God's word I can claim it. Though the way may seem long to Wellville and the opposition is strong for the bride there's a way provided. But just to hope it will not do. We must be fully persuaded to follow the Lord. How do we do that? By obeying the word and just believe that I am one of the few. I mean, we sing these songs, but do we realize the message in these songs? &gt;&gt; You could literally come to church and have a double sermon &gt;&gt; just entering into the message of the worship. &gt;&gt; Paul told Timothy in his hour of fear when he was ashamed of suffering afflictions because of this straight this narrow this straight a gate narrow way. So he didn't he didn't like suffering as a Christian and he was fearful and he got ashamed and Paul told him in 2 Timothy 1:12 for the which cause I also suffer these things. So Paul suffered the same things as Timothy. For the which cause I also suffer these things. Nevertheless, I am not ashamed. &gt;&gt; I love that. Sister Linda, I am not ashamed. I am not ashamed. For I know whom I have believed and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him against that day. &gt;&gt; In other words, he's going to Wellville. &gt;&gt; And he was persuaded he was going to get there. He wasn't going to allow um some afflictions, some persecutions, some some some things that were hard. I know they're hard, but to keep them down, &gt;&gt; you got to be determined. I'm one of the few. I'm going through. &gt;&gt; You must be fully persuaded. You can't be halfway. &gt;&gt; You can't say, you know, I'm thinking, you know, I'm thinking about trying this out. Put my foot in the water. Make a decision. Dive in or don't. &gt;&gt; I like what the prophet said. He said, "If you can't come hook, line, and sinker, then don't come at all." Because it takes that to make it. There are so many people who started the race &gt;&gt; that fell out along the way. &gt;&gt; There is very few that go to the end. Now, there will be many that come to him and say, 'Lord, Lord, didn't I do these things? How about me? There'll be those. But that ain't making it to the end. Because the end is when we come to church and we hear all the word. Man shall live by every word of God that p that every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Whatever that message said, we're we believe it. And when you take in the word of God and you don't leave part of it out, that's you getting to the end of Wellville because the world is full of denominations and the people become their own denomination. Well, this is what I believe. &gt;&gt; This is all I have to do. &gt;&gt; God knows my heart. Like God's looking to see for fruit. In fact, he wants your fruit to remain. &gt;&gt; He wants you out there on the front line. sharing Jesus Christ and the love of God with others. Amen. &gt;&gt; Romans 4:19, Abraham speaking here. He says,"Abraham being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body, now being dead when he was a hund years old, neither the yet the deadness of Sarah's womb." The Bible says, "He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God." I love this testimony. And being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he he was able also to perform what he promised. And therefore, it was imputed unto him for righteousness. It wasn't just, "Well, I repented and I got baptized and I'm righteous now." No, God made him go through the test of what 25 years. And through the 25 years, he had to remain strong. He had to remain fully persuaded. He had to remain having the testimony that I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. Brother Bram used to illustrate when he's talking to Sarah. Sarah, do you feel anything moving inside? No, I don't. Would you just keep making those booties because he is for sure coming. &gt;&gt; The promise is coming. And that's what we need a little bit more in our homes is headship. Come on. We need headship in our home saying God is going to bring his promises to pass. &gt;&gt; Have too much jellyfish stuff going around. Don't stagger at any promise of God through unbelief. Be strong in faith. Fight the good fight of faith. Give glory to God with every step on the road to Wellville. &gt;&gt; Learn to testify every day. Get up. God gave me breath. He's still not done with me today. &gt;&gt; Give him glory. Walk with persuasion. Walk with confidence. Don't walk with pride. Don't walk with arrogancy. Don't walk with an ego. Don't walk with thinking you're something. No. Walk knowing God is inside of you. You be humble and confident at the same time. How many are marching in the footsteps of Abraham, &gt;&gt; right? To the to the road to Wellville. Because the Bible says that that we walk in the steps of our of our father Abraham, then we are literally children of Abraham by doing one thing, walking in the steps of our father Abraham. And what were those steps? He just believed God. &gt;&gt; And when you believe God, that is the evidence that you're a son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Keep walking. I want to get to an important part of the message and that's about right. It's about half. So, we're about midway. This is just just turned out perfect. Now, as long as the second half just, you know, doesn't get extended. You know, that can sometimes happen. I want to make this statement. I want to embraed in your heart and your brain. We become the express image of what we believe. We become the express image of what we believe. What we believe in our heart is what we will become. If we have an image in our mind that we can't overcome something, then we won't. If we have this image that we don't see ourselves victorious, then we probably never will. If we have this image that we can't love, then we probably can't love. I can't get rid of this hatred. I then we can't get rid of it. We become the express image of what we believe. Why that is so important to know what you're believing. John said in 1 John 11 verse 11 just that's where this hole next to the rest is just going to be on this so you don't have to try to wonder where I'm at. He came unto his own his own people and his own did not receive him. They said nope. But as many as did receive him, which were not his own, but as many as received him, to them, to that group of people, he gave power to become the sons of God, even to them that believed &gt;&gt; on his name. You become the express image of what you believe. You know, the whole world, the whole world that goes to hell, not one of them will be there because they didn't have a chance. God gives everybody a chance. And if I understand God in my life, he gives me more chances than what I deserve. Brother Orlando, This statement is so crucial that we become the express image of what we believe. We must believe what the word says about us more than how we feel about oursel. &gt;&gt; So when you believe what the word tells you that greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world. When you feel like man I don't even feel like anything today. I feel like a wet noodle. I don't feel like I got anything. You say what the word says. &gt;&gt; You deny your feelings. You deny your emotions. &gt;&gt; You you deny that intellect, that that tree of knowledge of good and evil that says um that you're you're not going to make it. And you humble yourself to the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And you say, "By the grace of God, I'm going to make it. I'm going to overcome because greater is he that's in me. If we do not have the correct image in our mind of what we're to become, I say this, no matter how much it hurts, humble yourself and change the image that's in your mind. Amen. &gt;&gt; I've talked to people and I you try telling them something and they don't want to hear it. &gt;&gt; And all you're trying to do is tell them what the image is, but it's like they don't want it. How are you going to become How are you going to hit Wellville if you don't get in your heart and mind what Wellville really is? And I want that to sink in very deep. We've got to be serious about changing how we think about what the image of God is for our lives. It is serious to understand that we must have the correct image in our mind. We must have the correct image of Christ. We must have the correct image of what we're to become. We must have the correct image of what we should be doing. It should be clear as day. We shouldn't be walking around floating wondering who am I, where am I at, how I should be living, what should I be striving for, is this okay, is this not okay? &gt;&gt; We we barely have time to get ready. I if I understand the scriptures, if if um the righteous scarcely make it, &gt;&gt; yeah. So, if they scarcely make it, that means they are pressing in. God, show me what I need to be doing. They don't they don't you know the the righteous don't get in f uh 20 you know 20 years before the rapture and they coast the last 20 years you know well I got baptized I repented I'm saved no matter what you know once saved always saved can you show me that scripture you know you may better to take some certain scriptures and try to prove that point but when you do that you literally have to deny other scriptures &gt;&gt; amen And that's why the whole word or our doctrine must dovetail from cover to cover. Now Jesus not John said in 1 John 3 verse number one talking about the image. Now we're staying in this this theme. How many's with me? Say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Behold what manner of love the father has just bestowed upon us. all of us here that we should become the that we should be called the sons of God. Therefore, the world out there, the worldly people knoweth us not because it knew him not. And I do want to say this, not just the worldly people out there don't know us, but this worldly nature in here doesn't know Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there is a very vast difference to my carnality in God's spirituality. &gt;&gt; Beloved, now are we the sons of God. Now are we the sons of God. But let's be honest, it does not yet appear what we shall be. But we know that when he comes down to get his bride, &gt;&gt; we shall be like him. For we shall see him as he is. That's why it's important for us to see him as he is. Who is he? How is he? Is he what I think? Is God what I think? Is God what brother Ben thinks? God is what the word says God is. That's this is Bible says that Jesus Christ is in the image of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; And God sent a prophet to let us know what this really says, the interpretation of this. And you know, it dovetales. It doesn't hit any walls. It doesn't It's not a new doctrine. It's not an addition to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Nothing like that. It's the opening of the word to the bride &gt;&gt; because man shall add shall not add one word to it or his part will be taken out of the book of life and he shall not add to the word or plagues will be added to his life. This word is what the bride is looking at who she is. Now, it doesn't yet appear because obviously there's certain things in our lives that are not reflecting the word. But her attitude is this is really important to me. I'm going to go to church. I'm going to get prepared. I'm going to get serious because I want the revelation of the word so I can become the word. You know, where you go down the road, brother Ron's telling me he's passing churches and they're flooded with people, but you know, it's a false image of what they're looking to become. &gt;&gt; Amen. the blind are leading the blind. They're all going to fall in the ditch. I remember when I was wanted to know God, I tried church after church after church. Even in the churches, I was having meetings with the priest and wanting to get in the word and have a Bible study. And all I could really get from him was the pope. The pope. The pope. Like, forget about what Jesus is saying. And the Pope has supernatural authority over the word of God. &gt;&gt; And something inside of me says, "Look, I'm not basing my salvation on a man. &gt;&gt; I'll stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Been the best decision I've ever made. But now are we the sons of God." I want to read that again. And it does not appear what we shall be, but we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. Now, you got this image here. And every man that has this hope inside of him, he's actually purifying himself even as he's pure. In other words, he's becoming into the image that he sees. &gt;&gt; He's not afraid to go to church and say, "I want to knock off some of this flesh today. He's not afraid to go to church and say, "I want to be changed from glory onto glory. I want to become more like Jesus, to be like Jesus." He sings that song from his heart. There's a realness there to the believer. The bride of Christ has something inside of her. And that's I see the image of who God is. And now I am to become like that. And if you think you can, you can. And if you don't think you can, you can't. And all the encouragement of the world can't get you there. &gt;&gt; You can have all the encouragement of the world. It can't get you there. Encouragement is really meant to be short-lived. What will get you there is faith. I'll get back to that. Faith is what gets you there, not encouragement. God told Joshua, "Look, I'm with you. Wheresoever you goeth. Don't be afraid. Don't be dismayed. I am with you." &gt;&gt; God was encouraging him. But you notice that was shortlived because he had to step back and he had to go into the battle. He had to go take the land. He had to face the giants himself. God gives but man has to take. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm thankful for encouragement. But you know what? We're living in a world where we hardly get encouragement. &gt;&gt; You know what we get, sister? We get discouragement. &gt;&gt; We get dis discouragement. Everybody discourages us. I can't believe you're not living for me. You know what, brother Ben? The Bible says you got to live for me. You better do it. I'm going to let you know. And you're not living for me. It discourages me. It's amazing how Satan likes to take the word and twist it. &gt;&gt; Twist it. But a pure heart, blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. They that have this hope in they that have this hope inside of them. They that are they want to purify themselves. &gt;&gt; You know, it's time for us to to get more serious with God. Don't you think? &gt;&gt; I think it's late in the hour or living in a late hour. &gt;&gt; Honestly, no matter what we got going on in life, nothing is more important than making a rapture. Amen. &gt;&gt; And before we make a rapture, we can we got to get into his image because God is not going to marry some I don't care bride. &gt;&gt; He's going to marry a bride without spot, without wrinkle. And it's going to be more than his blood doing it. She's going to have to fall in love with what that blood paid for. Amen. &gt;&gt; God gave his life that his word could come and live inside of us. And if we're each day not embracing that word and saying, "God, come into my heart. God, I love you. God, I want more of you." Because it can come. Now, before Calvary, it couldn't came. &gt;&gt; But that word can come in. He said, "I'll write my laws in their hearts and in their minds. I'll put my spirit in them. But if say, "No, I don't want to do that. I want to do my own thing. I just want to do it my way." Well, your way is not going to get you to Wellville. Your way is going to get you to unwell. Everyone that goes to hell is not excited. I don't think there'll be one person. I'm so glad I went my way. I'm so glad I didn't listen to my mom. I didn't listen to my dad. I didn't listen to the word. I didn't listen. There ain't anybody's going to be Come on, everybody. Hell, let's let's just I want to encourage you. You made the right decision. The devil's out to get us. &gt;&gt; He's vicious. He don't care. Anytime you see a spirit of I don't care, it is the devil in flesh. It is the manifestation of the spirit of evil in flesh. Don't ever have a spirit of I don't care. Never. I don't care what anybody ever does to you. Jesus never said I don't care. He never projected an attitude of I don't care. He was hanging on the cross suffering. And he cared about his mother. He cared about his disciple John. &gt;&gt; For the joy that was set before me endured the cross. He cared. I'm telling you, you feel, you know, because there's feelings, right? We all have feelings. When you start to feel a feeling of I don't care, run. That's the devil inside. Call that thing out and say, "Satan, get out of my mind. Get out of my body. Get out of my feelings. I choose to care." &gt;&gt; Because that's the image of God. That is the image of God is to care. God cared. For God so loved the world that he gave. That is the image of God. And if we're to become that same image, then we're supposed to care. Care about everything. Care about our family. Care about souls. Care about our brothers and sisters. Care about the lost. Care about the hurting. Care care about Well, brother John, what if somebody hits me in the, you know, hits me with their attitude? What do you expect me to do? Just stand there and take it? I don't expect you to do that. The word expects you to do that. Turn the cheek. Offenses are going to come. Wo to them by who they come. But remember, it's not the action but the reaction. The image of Christ is for us to lay down our life and live for others. Now, I know it's a hard pill to swallow. That's why the prophet said, "Whatever you do, lay aside everything that you think's important going on in your life and get perfect love. Get to a place where you can love everybody, even your enemy." Now, I know it's a hard pill to swallow, but if you don't keep that image there, you won't be trying. You'll be making excuses of why you don't do what you do. Genesis 1 26. Now, now you got to put on your prayer your prayers for me because I think I just put like four pages of notes on it. I left my my path to Wellville. Genesis 1:26 says, "And God said, let us make man in our image after our likeness, and let he let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, over the fowl of the air, the cattle, and the all over the earth, and all and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth." So God created man in his own image, and the image of God created he him, male and female created he them. A lot could be said about this, but the main point I want to bring here is that God said, "Let us make man in our image," not a different image, not half human and half God, not half sinful, half holy. Let us make man in our image. And God blessed them. And God said unto them, "Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it. Have dominion over the fishes of the sea, the fowl of the air, and every living thing that moveth upon the earth." God's original intention was to have a bunch of humans walking around on earth that are just like him. &gt;&gt; That was God's original original plan. Now his intention and his plan has never changed. He doesn't have a plan B. Well, that didn't work. Well, we might as well just let him be sinful. That'll be, you know, good enough. Like a teacher grading on a curve because the whole class did bad. or God never said, "Well, if we can't if we can't beat them, you know, let's join them." Well, there isn't no, "Well, we'll just settle for the best that we can get out of them." He never said that. He never thought that. When God's word goes forth, it will not return unto him void. &gt;&gt; And no matter how much Satan messed up the plan, God will have a bride in his image. He will have a bride without spot and without wrinkle before he returns. &gt;&gt; And you know who it's going to go to? It's going to go to those who believe in the same thing that God said. &gt;&gt; He's not calling favorites. He's not calling me because my name is John Martin and you know he's got blue eyes. It really doesn't matter if I wear a tie, don't wear a tie. Doesn't matter if I'm fit, not fit. Nothing matters. Does it matter? I like Chevrolet or Ford, apple pie or peacon pie, chocolate chip cookies or molasses. The only thing matters is does my life line up with the word. &gt;&gt; And the only way that's ever going to happen is not by what's preached behind this pulpit, &gt;&gt; but what's inside your heart to become. What image is inside of you? What are you visualizing as a man? Think it so is he? We must have the correct image of who God is. How else will we know what to become? If we think God is some daddy old grandpa that, you know, whatever, whatever, whatever you want, I'll just give it to you. Yeah. Yeah. I'm going to spoil you. Some Santa Claus. Give, give, give, give. Meet all your needs. Just, just it's all about you. It's not about me. But Jesus said, if you love me, it is about me. You'll keep my commandments. &gt;&gt; It's a relationship. Remember, every seed brings forth of its kind, including God's seed. That means if we are the seed of God, we're going to become like God. &gt;&gt; Romans 8:29, for whom he did forno, he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of the of of this I'm sorry. Uh of the son. I'm just going to get it up here. The image of his son. My word got cut off. that he might be the firstborn among what? Many brethren. So, they're going to be just like Jesus. If we've been predestinated, then we're going to be conformed. That doesn't mean lay back on a hammock. It means jointly form. That's you agreeing with God about who you are. That's God saying to each one of us individually, if you can believe, be it unto you as as thou believe, as thou wilt. If you believe that you're my daughter, that you're my son, be it unto you. I believe what we need is to take a stand. Because if you don't take a stand against the devil, he's going to lay he's going to just cradle you in Le Oysia. &gt;&gt; Nothing matters. You don't even have to go to church. You just do what you want to do. You're still Brother Brandham said, pinch your conscience. Pinch it. There's a people who believe this. They believe they're predestined. They're called. They're chosen. They're elected by God's fornowledge to be in the same image. They have the correct image of what God is. Therefore, they have a correct vision for their lives because they know who God is. They have a hope inside of them that's purifying them by the word of God. They are meditating upon the word day and night. They're working out their own salvation with fear and trembling. The bride of Christ doesn't sit around without a vision what they should be doing. They are being conformed to the image of Jesus Christ because Jesus wants to be the firstborn among many brethren. It's awful quiet in here. &gt;&gt; So if we don't start saying amen, then we're going to step up and do what do they call that where you're doing exercises? calisthetics. Remember, just like the children of Israel coming out of Egypt, it was a mixed multitude. &gt;&gt; So, the church in the last days coming out of a worldly denomination. The world worldly church feels this I'm in need of nothing lukewarm, complacent feeling, not recognizing fully that they're wretched, miserable, poor, blind, naked. Don't tell me what to do. I can make it without oil in my lamp. I don't need to be counseledled. You know, they got this attitude when you try to tell them what the word is expecting of them that that they got this defiant attitude. But God gave them some counsel. Anyways, in Revelations 3:18, he says, "I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raignment that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear, and anoint thine eyes with eyes, that thou mayest see. And as many as I love, I rebuke and chasten. Be zealous, therefore, and repent." I'm so glad that God cares enough about me to correct me. &gt;&gt; I think the I think this is what I mean, hell is going to be terrible because it's knowing that you'll never see the Jesus again, the face of Jesus, the presence of God, but it's also that knowledge that you you do not have a chance to come back, right? You don't have a chance. In other words, God finally said, "Okay, I've called long enough. I've invited long enough. You would not come. Okay, you're not coming. That is such a horrifying thought to me. The bride of Christ is the one really who has repented, &gt;&gt; who comes out of their own image and they come into the image of God. See, you're you're not just repenting about coming out of a denomination. Oh yeah, I'll start going to a message church. But you're you're repenting of coming out of your own image because you know you've been called to the image of Christ. You've been predestinated to come into his image. They have traded their lives for gold which is the deity of God. You give up your will for God's will and they come into the same image of God. The bride of Christ has heard the voice of her husband speaking to come out and be ye separate from your first nature and receive the second nature of God. &gt;&gt; Come out of your own image and come into the image of Christ. And he continues on in Revelations 3:20. Jesus saying, "Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door of their heart, &gt;&gt; I will come into him and I will s with him and he with me and to him that overcomemeth to him that says I think I can. I think I can. I think I can. I will grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and has sat down with my father in his throne. And then this word goes out to everybody. He that have an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches. And we just think about this. Many of us are thinking, brother John's speaking, our pastor speaking. He's just gathering some stories and sharing his thoughts and, you know, trying to convey what he feels. But in reality, he that has an ear, let him hear what the spirit, what the Holy Ghost spirit is saying to the church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's not me. It's got to be Christ that you're hearing. The only place I'm going to lead you is to the restaurant so you can buy me dinner. But when he, the Spirit of truth, come, he will lead and guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; The bride of Christ is taking her husband's word for instructions on the road to Wellville through the straight gate along the narrow way that's crowded with afflictions and problems. Just taking the word. You know, a lot of people when there's a problem, you know what they do? Does anybody know what most people do when there's a problem? Most people, what do they do? Huh? Run away. Okay. Huh? Deny it. Good. Who? Whoever said deny it. Ignore it. Good. Complain. People who love to be on welfare, they want the government to take care of everything for them. But God has made his wife is an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Everybody else that didn't make it, they were not overcomers. They went part way. They lived good, clean lives. We know the parable about the 10 virgins. Five were wise, five were foolish. Brother Brandon gives this illustration, the choosing of a bride. He talks about all these women that thought that they were going to be the ones going to marry this cowboy. And most of them were just bragging. But you know what? They didn't want to work. They didn't want to overcome. They didn't want to they didn't want to suffer. I'm just going to stay behind and I'm just going to work. They wanted to be out there and party and look at me and you know I'm a great Christian. But that cowboy came back for character. &gt;&gt; And character is overcoming your flesh. &gt;&gt; It's overcoming your flesh. 2 Timothy 3:16. All scripture is given by the inspiration of God, and it is profitable for reproof, for correction, instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furnished onto all good works. It's profitable for the direction to Wellville, for the reproof when we stop moving forward, for correction when we start going the wrong direction, for instruction how to become in the image of Jesus Christ. This word of God must become our absolute, not just something that we say we know it's true. &gt;&gt; But it needs to be true for our lives. We need to take it. He that believeth on me, the works I do shall he do also. Got some cults on that, but I'm not going to read it. I just want to read Romans chapter 12. I know we have to skip some stuff here. Romans chapter 12, verse one. The bride of Christ is not allowing the world to hold her back. She is pressing through all of her trials, all of her tests to become in the image of Christ. I beseech you therefore by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God, which is your reasonable service. God is showing us how to walk on the road to Wellville. because it is God that workketh in you both to do of his good pleasure. Amen. And be not conformed to this world, to this worldly nature. But be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind. I think I can. I think I can. I can be an overcomer. I can be a Christian. I can live the way he wants me to live. Be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Think differently about yourself. that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for your life. We are changed from glory unto glory. &gt;&gt; All right. Can I just do a couple quotes? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said in this church age, he says, "A child of God can go a long time before they recognize who they are." Can go a long time. And he would go on to tell the story about uh the eagle who uh uh the farmer took an eagle egg and pl placed it under one of the hens and it got enough heat. It had enough atmosphere to be to come out and be the new birth started. Uh but he was inside this uh chicken pen or or this down here with the chickens in the manure and you know if anybody's got chickens, you know, you just throw some corn out there and they just start digging and you throw it right on the manure. They just start eating it. You know, they don't they don't say, "No, I want a clean plate." Anything like that. And so, you know, this is what the the eagle was looking at what was happening. And it just seemed so disgusting to him that he he just found it very difficult to be doing. He felt like he was out of place. He just looked odd to himself. I know I'm going to church. I got to go to church. I got to go somewhere. But something inside just felt uncomfortable. And one day he heard the eagle. &gt;&gt; Heard a scream from above. It was mama eagle. calling down saying, "Come up out of your will. &gt;&gt; Come out up out of man-made religion. Come up out and fly. You're an eagle." And it was when this eagle recognized that he was an eagle that he started flying. &gt;&gt; But he was an eagle to begin with, &gt;&gt; but he just didn't recognize it. And when you recognize that you are the word of God in flesh, &gt;&gt; then you'll start following the word like you've never followed it before. &gt;&gt; Brother Brand said in the rising of the sun, he said, "And God knows, hallelujah, he's got a predestinated for ordained church. He known he's got sons and daughters and a bride waiting somewhere. And when the Holy Spirit begins to fly over it and wave that sheave, oh my, he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. Not some mis uh mythical story, but a reality. And when we see not a denomination, not a good neighbor, but a son of God molded into the image of God with the dynamic power of God to answer the request of this day that he is the same yesterday, today, and forever. that ain't that uh there ain't no hen going to hold you. He hunts his mama. He's an eagle to begin with. He recognizes this eagle recognizes the call of God's word. Why? He's an eagle. An eagle to an eagle. The word before the foundation, the word to the word. The word predestinated to the word written for the hour. You realize your possession. You realize your position and you hunt for it. &gt;&gt; And the revelation of Jesus Christ, I've quoted this before, but it's real important. I believe worth repeating. Now, remember this. Christ is the true church in the continuation of the book of Acts. Christ in the true church is the continuation of the book of Acts. But the book of Revelation shows how the Antichrist spirit would come into the church and defile it, making it what? How do you defile a church? Make it lukewarm, formal, powerless. It exposes Satan, revealing his works, attempting destruction of God's people, and discrediting God's word right down to the time he's cast into the lake of fire. He fights that. He cannot stand it. He knows that the He knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is, what she stands for and she can do the greater works, she will be an invincible army. See, recognizing who she is, that's why it's important for us to recognize who we are. The sooner the better because you will when you recognize you're a true son of God, a true daughter of God, a true child of God, Satan can't do nothing to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's powerless. &gt;&gt; Didn't the prophet say that the Christian, the weakest Christian on his knees, the devil trembles? &gt;&gt; Because the weakest Christian is going before his heavenly father saying, "Father, I need thee." And God, you know, he's faithful. If they can get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern and withstand the antichrist spirit, Satan will be powerless before her. He will be as he will he will be as definitely throtted today as when Christ withtood every effort to gain power over him in the desert. Yes, Satan hates this revelation. He hates revelation. But we love it. With true revelation in our lives, the gates of hell cannot prevail against us, but we will prevail against them. Amen. One quick quote from Christ, the mystery of God revealed. And here it is. You can stand to you can stand if you'd like. And here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did there. She can't recognize another headship. No sir. There is no bishop, no nothing. She recognizes one headship. That's Christ. And Christ is the word. Oh my. R. I love that. We recognize Christ as our headship. We recognize this word as our headship. You know, a lot of people they go to church and they look at they they go to church and they say, "Well, the Bible is there to kind of help you become a better person so you can treat your neighbor better and uh just just be a a little bit better person." They view coming to church for that reason. But we, the bride, knows that this is the word of God that's going to judge them in the last day. And the word is so much more serious and important to them. &gt;&gt; And I believe that we have an excellent opportunity to become in the image of Jesus Christ because we know what that is here. &gt;&gt; And all as we're doing all God has given us opportunity to get serious with the word when we go home and spend time reading, spend time praying and say, "God, I want to make it to Wellville. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you desire, whatever you want, you want healing in your body, you want victory over uh some uh device in your life, whatever it would be, there is a way to get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to have the attitude, I think I can. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing that chorus. I am I am one of the few. [Music] I am one of the few. Yes, I'm one of the few. And by faith in God's word, I can make it. Though the way may seem long and the opposition strong for the bride there so away provided if I plan to go through just to hope will not do I must be firmly decided to follow the Lord by obeying his word and believe that I'm one of the few. What do you believe? I am one of the few. Yes, I'm one of the few. And by faith in God's word, I can claim it. Though the way may seem long and the opposition strong for the bride, there's a way provided. If I plan to go through just to hope will not do, I must be firmly decided to follow the Lord by obeying his word and believe that I'm one of the few. [Music] Amen. And believe. How many believes you're one of the few? &gt;&gt; Amen. I wonder if there's anybody here today that says, "Brother John, I have really been living underneath the privileges that God has given me to claim all his word for my life." And you would like to have prayer before we go to him in prayer. Amen. Amen. Praise the Lord. I believe in the power of God. I believe that God has power to take us. His word will not return void. And all we're doing is agreeing with what he said. &gt;&gt; We're not making our own word up. We don't got power in our word. We just got power in believing in God's word. Amen. Let's go to God in prayer. Our heavenly father, Lord, I thank you for your bride here. for your sons and your daughters and those that you have you have predestinated all of us to be in your image. And Lord, we're here today, Lord, asking through this word that you have given us, God, would you help us to step up to the plate with more confidence, with more assurance, with with a right attitude, with a a right testimony, a right profession, a right confession without a laxadesico but with Lord I care with all my heart. I want to become like you. Bless your people with an inner strength Lord. Lord you said they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength. We need strength on a road to Wellville. There are many obstacles, things we're facing, things all over that one another don't know what we are going through. Lord, you know, Lord, thank you for being greater in us than all of our trials, all of our test. Thank you, Jesus. Lord, we want to we want to tap into more of the promises of God. And Lord, we're asking, Father, that you would help our unbelief. Take our doubts away, our fears away, our shame away, and help us to stand up for you as you stood up for us. You lay down your your life that you may come down to our level. Help us to lay down our life now to come up to your level. Bless your people now, Lord. We commit them in with their desire. You see the desire in their heart. We see the commitment they're making right now. I pray Lord Lord let let it grow in such a way that they can look back to this moment and know Lord is because you said to them be it unto you according to thy will and they said Lord I want to be just like you grant it father we thank you and we give you praise with all of our heart in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. Amen. I just want to thank the Lord for that prayer. Thank the Lord for doing that.
