[0:01] um so if it cuts out then I'll run over
[0:06] there and grab one of those mics if
[0:09] you'll turn with me this
[0:11] evening to Hebrews
[0:16] 11 turn it
[0:20] on I thought you guys already did turn
[0:22] it on there you go how we
[0:26] doing okay praise the Lord amen amen
[0:31] amen amen
[0:34] so I just want to say this I don't
[0:36] normally say things too much I but I
[0:40] certainly have appreciated brother
[0:42] John's
[0:43] messages and so it puts me in a bad
[0:50] place I mean I I prayed and prayed pray
[0:53] I came out told sister Donna Monday I
[0:56] says we're in
[0:58] trouble
[1:01] yes so if the Lord doesn't inspire you
[1:05] then you're just
[1:08] aurer and we never want to be just a
[1:10] lecturer amen we're not here to lecture
[1:13] we're not here
[1:15] to the the secret thing that goes on is
[1:19] that we try to give you something that
[1:21] you can take home and then when you're
[1:24] in the midst of
[1:26] battle my testimony won't help you
[1:30] that that won't help you but the word of
[1:32] God is forever settled in heaven and if
[1:35] you hear the word and hide it in your
[1:37] heart he's a present tense God and he's
[1:41] a present help in a time of trouble and
[1:43] his word will do all those things for
[1:46] you
[1:48] so praise the Lord enough of that
[1:51] Hebrews 11 we want to start with verse
[1:55] 13 these all died in faith not having
[2:00] received the promises but having seen
[2:03] them a far off and were persuaded of
[2:06] them and embraced them and confess that
[2:09] they were strangers and pilgrims on the
[2:11] earth for they that say such things
[2:14] declare plainly that they seek a country
[2:18] for truly if they had been mindful of
[2:21] that country from whence they came out
[2:23] they might have had opportunity to have
[2:25] returned but now they desire a better
[2:28] country that is is a Heavenly wherefore
[2:31] God is not ashamed to be called their
[2:33] God for he hath prepared for them a city
[2:37] amen let's bow our heads for a word of
[2:40] prayer dear Lord
[2:42] Jesus Lord we've sung the songs of Zion
[2:46] Lord father we've brought our offerings
[2:49] we've laid them at your feet Heavenly
[2:52] Father we pray that you'll receive us
[2:55] and that you'll come tonight father that
[2:57] you'll break the bread of life Lord that
[2:59] you'll feed us from your word you'll
[3:02] bless those that aren't here father
[3:03] those that are sick and Afflicted
[3:05] remember Billy Paul Lord remember
[3:08] brother Johnson remember brother Donnie
[3:10] and his daughters passed on now and
[3:13] remember the son-in-law and the grand
[3:16] children Comfort Lord Jesus sister
[3:19] Hope's family Lord Heavenly Father thou
[3:23] knowest all things we just pray that
[3:25] you'll just be merciful to us and
[3:27] gracious may you just come and be our
[3:29] guest tonight we love you father in
[3:32] Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen
[3:36] you may be seated
[3:44] amen verse 15 says if indeed that they
[3:50] had remembered from there from whence
[3:53] they had came forth they would have had
[3:56] a season to have returned
[4:01] so tonight I just want to talk to you
[4:03] about the choice is
[4:06] yours we find out here that
[4:10] um that it says in verse 13 it says so
[4:13] they all died in the faith not having
[4:16] received the
[4:17] promise but they saw them a far off so
[4:21] they they never the thing that God had
[4:23] given to them they never possessed it
[4:27] they possessed it in faith
[4:30] and they but they saw it a far off and
[4:32] they knew that God could not lie so they
[4:34] they were able to chase after that
[4:38] amen and he said and they were persuaded
[4:41] of them and they embraced them the
[4:43] promises of God and they confess that
[4:46] they were strangers and pilgrims in the
[4:48] earth and they that say such things
[4:51] declare plainly that they seek a
[4:54] country but the question in verse 15 was
[4:57] it says and truly if they had been
[5:00] mindful of that country from whence they
[5:03] came out they might have had an
[5:07] opportunity to have
[5:10] returned if they were mindful of where
[5:13] they came
[5:14] from they may have returned to
[5:18] that brother Brenham says so he says you
[5:20] have a choice as a Christian you have a
[5:23] choice of the church here in America so
[5:26] far that we can go to that your American
[5:30] privilege to choose any church that you
[5:32] want to belong to that's a choice you
[5:34] don't have to go to any of them if you
[5:36] don't want to but if you want to change
[5:38] from the Methodist to the Baptist or the
[5:40] Catholic to the Protestant or so forth
[5:43] there's nobody can tell you or make you
[5:45] come to any certain church that's that's
[5:48] our freedom that's what our democracy is
[5:51] every man can choose for himself freedom
[5:53] of religion and that's a great thing God
[5:56] help us to keep it as long as we can and
[5:59] you you have also a choice now you can
[6:01] choose this church you can choose
[6:04] whether you in this church whether you
[6:06] would choose a church that will guide
[6:08] you to your Eternal
[6:10] destination you can choose a church that
[6:12] has a certain Creed that you might think
[6:14] that Creed is just what you want or
[6:16] another church that has their Creed and
[6:19] then there of course there's the word of
[6:21] God and you have a choice of that also
[6:23] you have to make a choice there's an
[6:26] unwritten law Among Us for choosing amen
[6:30] so the choice tonight is
[6:32] yours we go forward it said here in
[6:35] Hebrews it said these all died in the
[6:37] faith they died in the faith they didn't
[6:39] receive some of them didn't receive the
[6:42] the promise that they were looking for
[6:44] but they embraced it
[6:46] anyways and if they had been mindful of
[6:49] where they came
[6:51] from if they had really had a draw on
[6:54] them they would have sought an
[6:55] opportunity to return to it right and
[6:59] and you tonight if you still have a
[7:02] mind The Choice is still yours amen
[7:07] amen back here in verse eight because
[7:11] we're going to talk about Abraham first
[7:13] it says by faith Abraham when he was
[7:16] called to go out into a place which he
[7:19] should after receive for an inheritance
[7:22] obeyed he was called to go to a place
[7:25] and he was promised and we'll get into
[7:28] that the promise was that he would
[7:30] possess the land yet while he was alive
[7:33] he never possessed the
[7:37] land amen and he went out not knowing
[7:41] where he
[7:42] went and by faith he sojourned in a Land
[7:45] Of Promise as in a strange country
[7:48] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[7:50] Jacob The Heirs with him of the same
[7:52] promise for he looked for a city which
[7:55] hath foundations whose Builder and maker
[7:59] is God and you'll notice there if you
[8:02] flip back and you look at the end of
[8:04] verse 16 he says God is not ashamed to
[8:07] be called their God for Heath prepared
[8:10] for them a
[8:13] city
[8:14] amen amen so let's go back here to
[8:17] Genesis
[8:18] 11 praise the
[8:22] Lord
[8:25] amen Genesis Genesis 11
[8:35] oh verse
[8:37] 27 it says now these are the generations
[8:40] of Tara Tara begat Abram nahor and Haron
[8:45] and Heron begat lot so this is Abraham's
[8:51] father and Heron died before his father
[8:54] Tara in the land of his Nativity and er
[8:57] of the
[8:58] cheles and Abram and nahor took them
[9:01] wives the name of Abraham's wife was
[9:04] Sarah and the name of nahor's wife milka
[9:07] the daughter of Heron and the father of
[9:09] milka and the father of isca but Sarah
[9:13] was Barren she had no child so they were
[9:16] living in the ER of the cheles they they
[9:21] you know they were they were people like
[9:22] us you know when you get old or get old
[9:26] but when you come to maturity and you
[9:28] graduate from school days are over with
[9:30] you you go out you get a job you try to
[9:32] make a way in the world you if if you so
[9:36] desire you go you you look for a wife
[9:38] Lord and and you you look to have a
[9:42] family you have all these desires and
[9:45] terara had his three sons but his one
[9:47] son died and they dwelt there in ER the
[9:50] child EES and in verse 31 it says and
[9:53] Tara took Abram his son and lot the son
[9:57] of Heron his son son and Heron was dead
[10:01] and Sarah his daughter-in-law his son
[10:04] Abram's wife and they went forth with
[10:06] them from ER the cheles now they left
[10:10] the other son in ER the cheles but they
[10:13] they left out of there and that to go
[10:16] into the land of Canaan and they came
[10:18] unto Heron and dwelt there and the days
[10:21] of Terror were 2005 years and terara
[10:25] died in
[10:26] Haron now the Lord had said on the Abram
[10:29] get theee out of thy country and from
[10:32] thy Kindred and from thy Father's House
[10:35] unto a land that I will show
[10:37] thee and I've been pondering I've been
[10:40] thinking about a lot of these things
[10:42] lately I've been thinking if the Lord is
[10:45] soon to come what is it that I expect to
[10:49] meet when I meet God
[10:54] himself what is he going to be
[10:56] like because my imagination says he's
[10:59] going to look like that but is that what
[11:01] he's going to be
[11:03] like I know he saved me but have I
[11:06] really met the visible person of Jesus
[11:11] Christ so when the Lord spoke to Abram
[11:15] how did he do
[11:18] that Abram was just you know there
[11:21] dwelling alone with his thoughts you
[11:23] know maybe maybe he was just starting
[11:25] out as a a sheep herder and he was
[11:27] working and that and the but the Bible
[11:30] says the Lord said unto abrahamabraham
[11:33] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[11:36] Kindred and from thy Father's House unto
[11:39] a land that I will show thee he never
[11:41] told him where he was
[11:43] going he there was no way for him to
[11:45] Google it to see if they had good
[11:47] economy there he couldn't see whether
[11:49] they had food there or what the jobs
[11:52] were like because he didn't know where
[11:54] he was going but the choice was
[11:57] his
[12:00] he could look at the country where he
[12:02] currently lived and he could consider
[12:05] the things that he had or he could
[12:07] follow this gwing thought that was in
[12:10] his heart of someplace else that was
[12:13] better that God was calling him
[12:17] to he says and I will make of thee a
[12:20] great nation and I will bless thee and
[12:23] when I will make thy name great and thou
[12:25] shalt be a blessing and I will bless
[12:27] them that bless thee and curse him that
[12:30] curseth thee and in thee shall all
[12:33] families of the earth be blessed was he
[12:36] talking to a man at the
[12:39] supermarket who was it that was talking
[12:42] to him because he never came and saw him
[12:45] until after Sarah just before the
[12:47] promise was going to be made and the
[12:50] Bible says that when he was in the The
[12:52] Plains of mamory and he was sitting
[12:54] there there was sheep herders and they
[12:56] saw three men come up till that time God
[12:59] never came to him
[13:02] visibly so when he said I heard the
[13:04] voice of the Lord what was
[13:08] that
[13:10] amen and Jehovah jari brother Brenham
[13:13] says notice but Abraham was just an
[13:15] ordinary man and he came down from
[13:18] Babylon and he dwelt there in the land
[13:20] of shinar and perhaps well and I thought
[13:23] this is this is a funny statement that
[13:25] he makes he says perhaps his diet was
[13:29] go in the morning pick up some berries
[13:31] from the bushes go back out kill an
[13:33] animal have his Noonday meal and some
[13:36] eat some more berries for supper and so
[13:40] forth he's just living life like brother
[13:45] Marty got up got your degree got a job
[13:51] found a place to work got up every
[13:53] morning started the car went to work had
[13:57] the boss yell at him said I won't fail
[13:59] that no more CU I don't like to get
[14:01] yelled at then you know and and brother
[14:04] ROM's trying to show you that
[14:07] Abraham was just an ordinary
[14:10] man but he had a
[14:13] choice amen he had married his half
[14:17] sister and her name was Sarah and while
[14:19] Abraham just being an ordinary man God
[14:23] chose
[14:24] Abraham by
[14:26] election not because he was different
[14:28] from from any other man but because
[14:31] because that God's election has to stand
[14:35] sure now I want you to look here at
[14:37] Romans
[14:38] 9 and I want you to think every one of
[14:42] us in this room
[14:44] tonight we are reflection of
[14:49] Abraham
[14:51] Amen in Romans
[14:53] 9 and verse 7 it says neither because
[14:57] they are the SE of Abraham are they all
[15:01] children okay there is nobody sitting in
[15:04] this
[15:05] room that can claim to be the Seed of
[15:09] Abraham we just don't have the DNA
[15:12] makeup we
[15:15] don't are they all children but in Isaac
[15:19] shall the seed be
[15:22] called that is they which are the
[15:25] children of the flesh they are not the
[15:28] the children of God but the children of
[15:31] the promise are counted for the seed and
[15:34] that's where we all come
[15:36] in amen and This Is The Word of Promise
[15:39] at this time will I come and Sarah shall
[15:42] have a son and not only this but when
[15:45] Rebecca also had conceived by one even
[15:47] by Our Father Isaac for the children
[15:50] being not yet born neither having done
[15:52] any good or evil that the purpose of God
[15:56] according to election might stand not of
[15:59] works but of him that calleth so
[16:03] Abraham he only had God only expected
[16:06] one thing out of Abraham what was going
[16:09] to be the result of his
[16:13] choice was he going to consider the land
[16:16] where he lived at was he thinking well
[16:20] maybe I can follow God maybe maybe this
[16:24] this maybe I can make this thought or
[16:26] whatever this is this thing that's
[16:28] trouble in me that's causing me to do
[16:31] something it's causing me to separate me
[16:34] I'm going to separate from my family I'm
[16:36] going to separate from my Kindred and
[16:38] I'm going to follow
[16:40] this I don't I don't know what to call
[16:43] it this impression this inspiration I'm
[16:47] going to follow it and brother brandom
[16:50] said that was God and it was God's
[16:52] election
[16:56] Amen brother brandom went on a say he
[16:58] says but God called Abraham not because
[17:01] he was
[17:02] good but because God chose
[17:05] Abraham Jesus said you've not chosen me
[17:09] but I have chosen
[17:11] you at some point we have to believe
[17:15] that at some point that has to become a
[17:18] reality that you are not here of your
[17:21] own
[17:22] choosing
[17:26] amen he says I you have not chosen me
[17:29] but I have chosen you Jesus said no man
[17:31] can even come to the father or come to
[17:34] me except my father draws him first why
[17:37] are you out here
[17:40] tonight is because you're
[17:43] interested why aren't you over at a ball
[17:45] game is because you love God more than
[17:48] you love ball games and that's the
[17:51] reason you're here God called you and
[17:54] put a different desire in your heart and
[17:57] Abraham
[17:59] he's just a normal that's why we went
[18:01] and read the lineage and that he's just
[18:03] a normal
[18:05] common brother Keith that's what he is
[18:09] just a common
[18:12] guy but God spoke to
[18:16] him and when God speaks to you you have
[18:20] a
[18:21] choice are you going to follow that and
[18:25] you can try not to follow it but I'm
[18:27] telling you the way of a transgressor is
[18:30] hard God
[18:33] wins because if he elected you you're
[18:36] coming and that's the believer's
[18:38] confidence no matter whatever happens
[18:41] God is coming Abraham we don't know
[18:44] exactly how many years Abraham wrestled
[18:47] with that
[18:49] thought you know he wrestled with that
[18:51] thought and think about Mo this is going
[18:52] to this is really going to upset a lot
[18:55] of things if I leave my family and I
[18:57] take my wife and and I go and people are
[19:00] going to ask me they're say what are you
[19:02] doing well I'm quitting my job I'm I'm
[19:04] going over here why are you going over
[19:06] here well I just kind of feel that's
[19:08] what I should be doing and I believe God
[19:11] will well who is this God show me this
[19:13] God where is
[19:15] he where can I find him what house does
[19:18] he live in what does he look like is he
[19:20] black is he an Indian is he is he up is
[19:23] he a some guy up on top of a mountain
[19:26] somewhere where is this God but see
[19:27] Abraham couldn't show people God he
[19:29] could only show them what he believed
[19:33] and when he believed then he became what
[19:36] the message that was given to him that's
[19:39] true when the Bible said when God said
[19:41] to Abraham he said Abraham come and
[19:43] follow me go to a country that I have
[19:47] called you to when Abraham went and
[19:50] started to do that he manifested that
[19:53] word that was in his heart that he
[19:55] couldn't share with anybody he was live
[19:58] in it and when he lived it became a
[20:00] written epistle read of all
[20:02] men amen
[20:06] amen so he says God called you and put a
[20:09] different desire in your heart but on
[20:11] this election God chose Abraham not
[20:14] because he was an educated man not
[20:17] because he was a smart man but because
[20:20] that God saw something in Abraham before
[20:23] the foundation of the world and that's
[20:25] the reason you are a Christian
[20:29] tonight is because that God saw
[20:32] something in you before the foundation
[20:35] of the world and put your name on the
[20:37] Lamb's Book of Life before the world was
[20:40] ever formed how are you going to lose
[20:43] how can you do it amen amen how can you
[20:46] come up
[20:47] short if God be us who can be against us
[20:52] amen and yet you have a
[20:55] choice you can be mindful you know some
[20:58] people they have they struggle with that
[21:00] but a lot
[21:01] of most people that I know of that truly
[21:05] get saved that their family isn't a
[21:08] question they're they once they find God
[21:13] they're sold
[21:14] out amen they're sold
[21:18] out so we want to take a look at a
[21:21] couple
[21:23] examples that's just Abraham and when I
[21:25] was looking um through my notes and
[21:29] that
[21:31] Abraham there too many
[21:34] scriptures so let's let's take a look at
[21:38] Moses so in Hebrews
[21:41] 11 Paul writes about
[21:48] Moses and he makes this
[21:51] comment verse
[21:53] 23 he says by faith Moses when he was
[21:56] born was hid three months of his parents
[22:00] because they saw he was a proper child
[22:02] and they were not afraa and they were
[22:04] not afraid of the king's
[22:07] commandment you think about that do you
[22:10] just read it you know but amram and
[22:14] jabed that was his
[22:17] parents they were of the the lineage of
[22:19] Levi they were both Levi so they were
[22:23] they were people that had been brought
[22:24] up to to serve the temple but they were
[22:27] in a Strange Land there there was no
[22:29] Temple they were they were just of the
[22:31] tribe of Levi but yet God before the
[22:33] foundation of the world he had already
[22:36] called the tribe of Levi to be his
[22:38] servants to be to take care of his
[22:40] temple in that so how many parents were
[22:44] there when Moses was born that were
[22:47] praying for a
[22:49] deliverer we're praying God send us a
[22:52] deliverer we got we got the clock we got
[22:54] the calendar we got it figured out we
[22:57] can look at the signs today and we can
[23:00] say we see we're in the hour we see
[23:02] we're in the time Lord come quickly but
[23:05] we don't know what time we don't know
[23:08] the hour but yet we have a choice
[23:10] because we're born In the Flesh and our
[23:13] family still pulling on us if we were
[23:16] mindful of the country from once we came
[23:19] we may find opportunity to return to it
[23:22] because the choice is
[23:25] yours that choice will always be
[23:29] yours
[23:31] amen he says so by faith when he was
[23:34] born he was hid three months of his
[23:36] parents because they saw he was a proper
[23:39] child and they were not afraid of the
[23:42] king's commandment so it was against the
[23:44] law in Egypt at that time to have a male
[23:48] child at that time when a male child was
[23:51] born it was under federal government law
[23:55] that the midwives were to kill the male
[23:57] child child they were to kill all the
[24:00] male children that's what they had to do
[24:04] but here was some parents that prayed to
[24:07] God and somehow when Moses was born they
[24:12] said just think about it they spend all
[24:15] this time praying that God would send a
[24:17] deliverer they have a child and they say
[24:20] oh this child this is child is for the
[24:23] downfall of our
[24:26] family because we're going to have to
[24:28] tell the authorities or the authorities
[24:30] are going to find out about it and then
[24:33] they'll kill it and that'll break my
[24:35] wife's heart that'll break my heart and
[24:39] they hit
[24:40] him they hit him for three months every
[24:43] day thinking don't cry now because the
[24:46] police are going
[24:47] by don't don't let the neighbors know
[24:50] because if they if anybody finds out
[24:53] because my neighbor just across the
[24:55] street from me he had a male child and I
[24:57] saw the police come and kill that
[24:59] baby because all the Jews all lived in
[25:02] one
[25:04] area and here I am saying mine's a
[25:08] proper child mine's a different kind of
[25:10] a child that's good
[25:13] amen verse 24 says by faith Moses when
[25:17] he came to years refused to be called
[25:20] the son of Pharaoh's
[25:22] daughter choosing rather to suffer
[25:26] Affliction with the people of God
[25:28] than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a
[25:31] season esteeming the approach of
[25:33] Christ's greater riches than the
[25:35] treasures in
[25:38] Egypt yet Christ hadn't even showed up
[25:41] yet how could that
[25:44] be how could he esteem The Riches of
[25:47] Christ greater when Christ hadn't showed
[25:52] up how can you do
[25:56] that
[26:02] by faith he forsook
[26:04] Egypt not fearing the words of the king
[26:07] for he endured as seeing him who is
[26:11] invisible and through faith he kept the
[26:14] Passover and the sprinking of blood lest
[26:16] he that destroyed the firstborn should
[26:18] touch them and by faith they passed
[26:22] through the Red Sea as by dry land which
[26:24] the Egyptians ass saying to do were
[26:26] drowned
[26:30] Amen brother brandham says in spoken
[26:33] word his Original Seed this is really he
[26:35] says remember Moses was born for the
[26:39] work today everyone that's sitting here
[26:43] if you're a Christian brother brandham
[26:46] said God saw something in you before the
[26:50] foundation of the world and started to
[26:53] draw you to
[26:54] himself when his time came he started
[26:57] started to draw you to himself because
[27:00] he saw something in you Jes and then you
[27:03] had a choice whether the things of the
[27:06] world or whether your friends your
[27:07] family whether you would be mindful to
[27:10] turn back to that but brother brandom
[27:13] says Moses he was born for the work he
[27:16] had to wait on God for the extra gift
[27:20] for the job he had to go back and wait
[27:24] and for the time appointed by God
[27:28] a certain Pharaoh had to be on the
[27:30] throne and the people had to be waiting
[27:32] for bread of for the bread of life
[27:34] before God would send him back just
[27:37] think about that Moses so Moses's
[27:40] parents they put him in the ark and they
[27:43] took him down and they put him in the
[27:45] bull rushes and pushed him out in the
[27:47] Nile not knowing what was going to
[27:51] happen not
[27:53] knowing but believing that the voice
[27:55] that they heard that this is the
[27:59] child this is the believer what is it
[28:04] that draws you to the word of God people
[28:08] have the Bible on the I mean well nobody
[28:11] people don't have the Bible anymore in
[28:12] their living rooms or in their bedrooms
[28:14] if they don't even put the Gideon Bibles
[28:16] in the hotels anymore we we don't we
[28:19] don't want to offend anybody we don't
[28:20] want you know that's so we don't have
[28:23] the Bible anywhere but yet God God Drew
[28:28] you to his
[28:30] word when you read it you said something
[28:33] inside started to stir something inside
[28:37] started to do something to you and and
[28:39] you had a choice to make you had a
[28:43] choice am I going to am I going to do
[28:47] this or and and
[28:49] Moses so when Moses's parents pushed him
[28:52] out to sea and then he floated up the
[28:55] Nile and he floated right in into
[28:57] Pharaoh's
[28:59] daughter's bath
[29:01] house where she was taking a bath which
[29:05] to the carnal mind is the absolute worst
[29:08] place for the deliverer to
[29:11] go because you know that the the
[29:15] children of the king are going to follow
[29:17] the king's
[29:19] commandment not unless you following the
[29:22] Unseen
[29:24] God because the Unseen God did something
[29:28] very
[29:30] miraculous because he watches over his
[29:32] word he watches over it if that's his
[29:36] deliverer then he's got to bring it to
[29:39] pass so he takes that baby and he raises
[29:42] him up and in teaching on Moses brother
[29:45] Brenham said he said even even so much
[29:48] that Moses's Sister Miriam when she was
[29:51] there she went to Pharaoh's daughter and
[29:53] said do you need a wet nurse and she
[29:56] said yes yes I do says I got
[30:01] one and she went and got the mother of
[30:05] the baby that they had just pulled out
[30:08] and even if you go back and look at the
[30:10] scriptures and then we got to go fast
[30:12] cuz
[30:13] so even if you look at the the pharaoh's
[30:16] daughter said right there she looks at
[30:19] her servant girl she says oh look at
[30:21] this beautiful baby must be a
[30:24] Hebrew that was her own words must be a
[30:28] Hebrew but she says I will take him and
[30:31] raise him as my own
[30:34] wow and every night when Mama sat down
[30:38] and nursed that baby of hers right she
[30:43] said Moses you're the
[30:46] one you're the one when he got older she
[30:50] said let me tell you about your father
[30:53] Abraham I didn't know I had a father
[30:55] Abraham yes you do let me tell you about
[30:58] God who's god Jehovah amen he he fills
[31:03] all space and time amen and and Moses
[31:07] grew up grew up the word being placed in
[31:10] him being placed in him being placed in
[31:12] him but see that isn't how God
[31:16] works that's good it filled him and
[31:18] filled him up and and and you know Mom
[31:21] said you got to be good you got to
[31:23] follow the rules you guys because we
[31:25] don't bring a reproach on our God God
[31:28] and we want you to do good in school and
[31:30] he became a great General and he became
[31:32] a great man of authority and he was he
[31:35] could even teach the
[31:37] Egyptians and one day he got up he he
[31:40] got he got
[31:42] so he came to
[31:44] maturity and when he got to maturity
[31:48] that call that was in his
[31:51] heart not just words on a
[31:54] page because words on a page won't
[31:57] change your heart but there was
[32:00] something on the inside of Moses that
[32:03] God placed there amen
[32:06] amen and proving his word brother bam
[32:09] said so Moses looked out the same window
[32:12] that Pharaoh
[32:14] did he looked out the same window he saw
[32:17] the same people that Pharaoh looked out
[32:21] upon them and Pharaoh looked at them and
[32:24] he said you know this is a cursed people
[32:26] a people that had nothing but a bunch of
[32:28] fanaticism and they have some God and
[32:31] nobody's even seen it in this God dwells
[32:34] in the
[32:36] desert nobody knows where he is and
[32:39] these people are
[32:41] crazy they got all these rules and
[32:44] things and they they they
[32:47] just but when Moses looked out
[32:50] there he could hear his mom given the
[32:53] promise of God 400 years
[32:57] I will deliver my people with a mighty
[32:59] hand Moses you're the guy you're the guy
[33:02] Moses you're the guy and Moses Moses
[33:06] acted on that but he completely
[33:12] failed brother brandham said he
[33:14] completely failed he was born for the
[33:17] work but he had to wait for God for the
[33:21] extra gift to do the job am sir when he
[33:26] killed the Egyptian he thought for sure
[33:29] that the people would rejoice and say
[33:32] yes but they didn't they looked they had
[33:35] a law thou shal not
[33:37] murder they looked at him and said what
[33:41] now you going to kill us like our task
[33:43] Masters
[33:44] do and he fled he fled from Pharaoh he
[33:49] fled he went out into the desert and God
[33:52] left him in the
[33:54] desert with his thoughts while he sat
[33:57] down and thought about all the things he
[33:59] could have done or should have done or
[34:01] maybe he maybe if IID have done this it
[34:03] would have turned out different maybe if
[34:04] I'd have done that maybe if I oh if I'd
[34:06] only done only only brother sister he if
[34:11] he'd have been mindful of the country
[34:13] that he had come from he would have
[34:15] sought an occasion to go
[34:18] back the choice was still
[34:23] his but he didn't consider pharaoh
[34:27] he didn't consider the riches he didn't
[34:30] consider all the good things he had and
[34:33] when the right Pharaoh was in the right
[34:35] place and the right things were in the
[34:38] right place and the hearts of the people
[34:40] were in the right place then God came
[34:42] down in a pillar of
[34:44] fire and spoke to Moses and Moses could
[34:48] say now the God that I thought I heard I
[34:52] have now seen him face to face and
[34:55] whatever he says do
[34:57] if he says take off my shoes I'm taking
[35:00] my shoes off amen and he went back
[35:05] amen
[35:07] amen praise the lord they're a bunch of
[35:10] Fanatics they were a bunch of slaves and
[35:12] their God letting them be slaves proves
[35:15] that he's not even
[35:18] God what kind of a God is that what kind
[35:21] of a God would take the heritage of
[35:24] Abram the I'll bless everybody that
[35:27] blesses you and I'll curse anybody that
[35:29] curses you God took that seed that
[35:33] blessed seed of the promise and let them
[35:36] all go down into Egypt and starve and
[35:40] become
[35:43] slaves God's ways are pass finding
[35:46] out and then right in the midst of the
[35:48] whole thing he was raising up the very
[35:52] man God does things in such peculiar
[35:55] ways right up under them not a
[35:57] theologian not a teacher not a
[36:00] priest not one of their holy men but
[36:02] just an ordinary man born for the job
[36:07] amen I want you to notice that Moses
[36:11] when Moses saw the pillar of fire then
[36:14] he had a connection with God and he he
[36:17] had to obey that word everywhere it
[36:23] went he had to obey it but when he went
[36:26] to the Red Sea when he got the children
[36:28] of Israel now they saw 10 Miracles and
[36:31] the children of Israel when they came
[36:33] out with Moses and they were the Seed of
[36:36] Abraham because God's promise to Abraham
[36:40] was thy seed didn't say some of them are
[36:44] make Believers some of them are
[36:45] unbelievers he said thy
[36:48] seed all of them will dwell in a foreign
[36:52] land and after 400 years I will bring
[36:55] them out with a mighty hand
[36:57] and he brought them out with a mighty
[36:59] hand and when they got to the Red Sea if
[37:02] you go and you look at it when they got
[37:04] to the Red Sea the very first thing that
[37:08] that Collective seed
[37:10] said you brought us out here to
[37:14] die they looked right back to the
[37:17] country they had come from and they
[37:19] hadn't even been gone for two
[37:21] days they looked right back and they
[37:24] would have sought a way back
[37:27] but God who is great in Mercy and his
[37:31] grace is
[37:33] great he delivered
[37:35] them he took them not very far and when
[37:39] they they ran out of food they they
[37:42] cried and what did they do they look
[37:45] back to the country where they came from
[37:47] they said you know when we when we lived
[37:50] in Egypt there was a 7-Eleven on every
[37:52] corner and a general dollar and we could
[37:54] buy food we could buy bread milk we
[37:57] could have whatever we wanted now we're
[37:58] out here in the
[38:00] desert and you're trying to kill
[38:03] us they were looking back at where they
[38:06] came
[38:07] from the choice tonight is still
[38:12] yours that choice is yours are you
[38:16] looking back to where you came from or
[38:19] you looking towards the promise
[38:22] amen when they went down and they ran
[38:24] out of water they got to the
[38:27] water they they ran out of water they
[38:30] said Moses we need water and what did
[38:34] they do they looked back to where they
[38:36] came from they looked back they
[38:40] continually looked
[38:43] back and when they got to cadesh
[38:47] barnea in numbers 14 after the spies had
[38:51] gone over and saw the promised land and
[38:52] came back the children of Israel they
[38:56] wept all night long because they said we
[38:59] can't fulfill the word you can't fulfill
[39:02] the word but God
[39:06] can that's what Abraham Abraham couldn't
[39:09] make the world bless him Abraham
[39:12] couldn't own the land Abraham couldn't
[39:15] bring
[39:16] Abraham Abraham couldn't change Sarah
[39:20] back to have that
[39:23] baby he knew it Sarah knew knew it and
[39:27] that's why they had the Bond
[39:30] woman God wants you to believe the word
[39:33] against all
[39:35] circumstances he wants you to believe
[39:37] the
[39:38] promise and no matter what happens you
[39:41] keep walking towards that promise even
[39:44] if you die in faith they possess the
[39:46] promise amen though they couldn't see it
[39:49] but if you're mindful of the country
[39:51] where you came from the trials will get
[39:54] hot enough you'll leave
[39:56] you will leave cuz we haven't even
[39:59] gotten hot
[40:00] yet
[40:03] amen let's move on and take a look at
[40:06] Ruth
[40:09] amen praise the Lord
[40:24] amen and Ruth verse 5 it says and Maan
[40:29] and chillan died also both of them and
[40:32] the woman was left of her two sons and
[40:35] her husband now that's a bad place to
[40:39] be this lady she had left Israel she had
[40:44] gone off off out of the promised land
[40:47] and her husband had died her sons had
[40:51] died which means she has no inheritance
[40:56] she has nobody to fight for her to get
[40:59] her inheritance because it's all under
[41:03] the
[41:05] men so now she's left by herself with
[41:09] her two
[41:11] daughters-in-law
[41:14] amen and she arose with her
[41:17] daughters-in-law that she might return
[41:19] from the country of Moab for she had
[41:21] heard in the country of Moab how that
[41:24] the Lord had visited his people and
[41:26] giving them bread so she's pretty carnal
[41:29] she just wants some place to eat she
[41:33] wants a place to live she wants some
[41:34] peace in her
[41:36] life wherefore she went forth out of the
[41:39] place where she was and her two
[41:41] daughters-in-law with her and they went
[41:43] on their way to return into the land of
[41:45] Judah and Naomi said unto her
[41:48] daughters-in-law go return each to her
[41:51] mother's house the Lord deal kindly with
[41:53] you as you have dealt with the dead and
[41:56] with me Naomi is telling them take a
[42:00] look what you're
[42:03] leaving because the choice is
[42:08] yours go back where you know it'll be
[42:12] easier go back where your family
[42:16] is go
[42:20] back and the Lord grant and she even
[42:23] tries Naomi gives them tries to give
[42:25] them a blessing
[42:26] the Lord grant you that ye may find rest
[42:29] each of you in the house of your husband
[42:32] then she kissed them and they lifted up
[42:33] their voice and wept so they were
[42:36] actually it was this was a hard decision
[42:40] for them and they said under her surely
[42:43] we will return with thee unto thy
[42:47] people so at the first time that she
[42:51] talked to them about where they had come
[42:54] from they all said no we're good Naomi
[42:58] what you told us about the promise of
[43:00] God we believe it we'll leave our Our
[43:04] World Behind we'll leave everything
[43:06] behind and we'll follow you and they go
[43:08] on a
[43:09] journey and after a while Naomi says to
[43:13] him again turn again my daughters why
[43:16] will you go with me are there yet any
[43:18] more sons in my womb that they may be
[43:20] your husbands turn again my daughters go
[43:23] your way for I am too old to have a
[43:25] husband if I should say I have hope if I
[43:28] should have a husband also tonight and
[43:31] should also bear Sons would you Terry
[43:34] for them till they are grown would you
[43:36] stay for them from having husbands nay
[43:39] my daughters for it grieveth me much for
[43:42] your sakes that the hand of the Lord has
[43:44] gone out against me and they lifted up
[43:46] their voice and they wept
[43:49] again and
[43:51] Oprah kissed her mother-in-law but Ruth
[43:55] clave on her
[43:56] her Oprah considered where she came from
[44:00] and said you know what maybe this
[44:02] message is a little bit too hard for me
[44:05] maybe this is just a little you know you
[44:08] guys are a little bit too fanatical for
[44:10] me I think I'm going to go back where
[44:12] it's a little safer and she
[44:15] left but
[44:17] Ruth Ruth said
[44:21] no and behold thy sister-in-law is gone
[44:25] back under her people and unto her Gods
[44:28] return Thou after thy sister-in-law and
[44:30] Ruth said I've already made up my
[44:34] mind stop trying to tell me to go back
[44:38] ENT treat me not to leave thee nor to
[44:40] return from following after thee for
[44:42] where thou goest I will go and where
[44:44] thou lodgest I will Lodge thy people
[44:47] shall be my people and thy God my God
[44:50] Amen and I imagine God on his throne
[44:53] he's high and lifted up when he heard
[44:55] that testimony said who said
[44:59] that who said
[45:01] that right
[45:04] amen because God respected Ruth for her
[45:08] decision for her
[45:11] choice when brother Brenham was reaching
[45:13] Revelations chapter 5 he says now here's
[45:15] the four stations or the four Junctions
[45:18] in Ruth and Boaz the first is Ruth
[45:21] deciding how many ever heard me preach
[45:24] that message let's see your hands now
[45:26] well all of you I guess I've had it here
[45:28] and had it on tapes and so forth Ruth
[45:31] first she had to decide whether she was
[45:34] going to go into the land or not when
[45:37] Naomi she had to make a decision she had
[45:42] to make that choice not knowing what
[45:45] laid before
[45:48] her we don't know what's going to happen
[45:50] tomorrow we don't know what's going to
[45:51] happen next week we don't know we don't
[45:54] know
[46:01] amen quickly let's go over here to
[46:04] Matthew
[46:05] 4 let's take a look at some other
[46:08] people what
[46:10] choice are you going to make so I
[46:13] already made my choice well God will
[46:18] will try you on that
[46:21] Amen in Matthew 4 verse
[46:24] 18
[46:26] it says Jesus walking by the Sea of
[46:29] Galilee he saw two brothers Simon called
[46:32] Peter and Andrew his brother casting a
[46:34] net into the sea for there were Fishers
[46:37] and he said unto them follow me and I
[46:39] will make you Fishers of Men and they
[46:42] straightway left their Nets and followed
[46:44] him what an what how insane is
[46:48] that what if you were down at Walmart
[46:50] and some guy just walked up to you and
[46:52] said hey follow
[46:54] me
[46:57] no right
[46:59] exactly but the the whole story isn't in
[47:02] Matthew we're going to look at all of
[47:03] them
[47:04] but and going on from then he saw two
[47:09] other brothers James the son of Zebedee
[47:11] and John the brother in a ship with
[47:13] Zebedee their father mending their Nets
[47:16] and he called them and they immediately
[47:19] left their ship and their father and
[47:21] followed him
[47:24] amen well let's see how Mark Rec records
[47:27] this Mark 1 verse uh
[47:34] 14 now after that Jesus was or John was
[47:37] put in PR
[47:39] prison Jesus came under Galilee now now
[47:43] here's an interesting
[47:45] thing John was the messenger for the
[47:48] hour because the scripture says that the
[47:51] whole city of Jerusalem and all the
[47:53] coast round about went out to hear
[47:56] John even even the king liked to Herod
[47:59] liked to hear John and they all went to
[48:02] hear John and in the midst of ter now
[48:05] Jesus's Ministry hadn't even started yet
[48:08] he had come down one day he had been
[48:10] baptized Jesus said behold or John said
[48:13] Behold the Lamb of God that take away
[48:15] the sin of the
[48:17] world and after John was thrown into
[48:21] prison now if you're a
[48:23] Believer you're going to be real careful
[48:25] about saying you're following John the
[48:27] Baptist cuz your Leader's in
[48:33] prison Jesus came unto Galilee preaching
[48:36] the gospel of the kingdom of God and
[48:39] saying the time is fulfilled and the
[48:42] kingdom of God is at hand repent ye and
[48:45] believe the
[48:47] gospel amen and now as he walked by the
[48:51] Sea of Galilee he saw Simon and Andrew
[48:53] his brother casting aned into the sea
[48:55] for for they were Fishers and Jesus said
[48:57] unto them Come Ye after me and I will
[49:00] make to you make you to become Fishers
[49:03] of Men and straightway they forsook
[49:05] their Nets and followed him and when he
[49:08] had gone a little farther then he saw
[49:10] James the son of zebede and John his
[49:12] brother who were also in the ship
[49:14] mending their Nets and straightway he
[49:17] called them they left their father
[49:19] zebedy in the ship with the hired
[49:21] servants and went after
[49:24] him as soon as they heard the voice
[49:29] gone Not Looking
[49:31] Back
[49:34] amen but Luke Luke brings out something
[49:37] that's even better than that because you
[49:39] remember brother brandom said we already
[49:41] read the quote where brother brandham
[49:43] said that Moses was the man born for the
[49:48] job but he couldn't do the job until God
[49:53] gave him the extra gift to to make it
[49:56] work up till then he was just
[50:00] following
[50:02] amen he was just following but when he
[50:05] met the pillar of fire that changed
[50:08] him
[50:09] Amen in Luke 5 verse one it says and it
[50:13] came to pass that as the people pressed
[50:15] upon him to hear the word of God he
[50:18] stood by the lake of Ganer and he saw
[50:21] two ships standing by the lake but the
[50:24] fishermen had gone out of of them and
[50:26] were washing their Nets and he entered
[50:27] into one of the ships which was
[50:34] Simon's and he prayed him that he would
[50:36] thrust out a little from the land and he
[50:38] sat down and he taught the people out of
[50:41] the
[50:42] ship so Simon sees this guy he comes
[50:46] down and there's this big crowd of
[50:47] people and they're pressing to hear him
[50:50] and he says to Simon he says
[50:52] Simon can I borrow your boat and he goes
[50:54] yes he says says so push out a little
[50:56] ways and he sat down and he taught the
[50:59] people and Simon's probably sitting
[51:01] there men in his net but he's
[51:04] listening
[51:07] amen now when he had left speaking off
[51:10] he said unto Simon launch out into the
[51:13] deep and let out your net for a
[51:16] drop and Simon answering said unto him
[51:19] master I'm a professional
[51:23] fisherman I know the sign the seasons
[51:26] the phases of the moon I know when the
[51:28] fish are biting and when they are
[51:31] not ask brother Ry because he's a good
[51:34] fisherman me I don't know I mean cast
[51:37] and if I then go over here that's
[51:41] me I have toiled all night and have
[51:44] taken nothing
[51:47] nevertheless I heard something that you
[51:50] said and it's stirring my
[51:53] heart it's stiring stirring me I don't
[51:56] know why it's stirring me I know I I
[51:59] follow Jehovah I go to the temple every
[52:01] week I do the sacrifices I pay my arms I
[52:06] do all the right things he says but
[52:08] there's something there's
[52:10] something at your word I will do
[52:14] it and when he had done this they
[52:17] enclosed a great multitude of fishes and
[52:19] their net break and they beckon under
[52:22] their Partners which are in the other
[52:24] ship that they should come and help them
[52:27] and they came and filled both the ships
[52:29] so that they begin to
[52:31] sink and you know who her Partners were
[52:34] the sons of
[52:36] Zebedee James and
[52:39] John and when Simon Peter saw it he fell
[52:42] down at Jesus's feet knees saying depart
[52:45] from me for I am a sinful man oh Lord he
[52:50] had changed from just a man who came to
[52:52] ask his
[52:53] boat he called called him
[52:57] Lord and he said the first thing when
[53:01] you get in the presence of God that's a
[53:03] problem we don't get in the presence of
[53:06] God when Moses got in the presence of
[53:08] God he couldn't speak and he was a real
[53:11] good speaker but when in the presence of
[53:14] God well I can't speak I don't he's
[53:17] asking about his degrees is I don't have
[53:19] any degrees I don't know now these
[53:22] people won't believe a word I said that
[53:24] won't do anything and God had to prove
[53:27] to Moses throw down your staff put your
[53:31] hand in your bosom and when God had
[53:34] proven that to Moses that this was God
[53:36] and it was God that was fulfilling his
[53:38] word then Moses went down and took over
[53:40] the country amen
[53:44] amen verse 9 says for he was astonished
[53:48] and all that were with him at the
[53:50] drought of the fishes which they had
[53:51] taken and so was also James and John
[53:55] the sons of Zebedee which were partners
[53:58] with Simon and Jesus said unto Simon
[54:01] fear not for henceforth Thou shalt catch
[54:04] men and when they had brought their
[54:06] ships to land they forsook all and
[54:09] followed
[54:10] him if they had been mindful of the
[54:14] country where they came from they' have
[54:16] said hot dog we have hit the mother load
[54:20] tomorrow I'm going out fishing and God
[54:22] probably would have gave him
[54:24] fish that's true you see but they
[54:26] weren't mindful of the fish they were
[54:29] mindful of what happened they were not
[54:32] mindful of what they could get out of
[54:34] following Jesus they they saw God in
[54:38] flesh amen
[54:42] amen now I want you I want to compare
[54:44] this with Matthew 9
[54:49] amen or Matthew 8 if we go to Matthew
[54:53] 8 verse 19
[54:56] it says and a certain scribe came and he
[54:59] said unto him master I will follow thee
[55:03] wheresoever thou
[55:04] goest he had made up his mind he was he
[55:08] had
[55:08] already he recognized who Jesus was and
[55:11] he says I'm I'm ready to go let's go and
[55:16] Jesus said unto him the foxes have holes
[55:18] and the birds of the air have Nest but
[55:20] the son of man hath not we to lay his
[55:24] head and that
[55:26] scribe took a look at the
[55:29] word took a look at the word being made
[55:32] flesh and then looked back to the
[55:35] country where he came
[55:40] from and slowly found opportunity to
[55:45] leave
[55:49] amen and another of his
[55:52] disciples a disciple he'd been fall on
[55:55] him for a little while said un him Lord
[55:58] suffer me first to go and bury my
[56:02] Father and Jesus said unto him follow me
[56:06] and let the dead bury their
[56:08] dead but the call on his family his
[56:12] family had such a draw on him that he
[56:15] turned and he went
[56:17] back that's a lot difference see there
[56:19] was something different about Peter
[56:22] Andrew James John barthol
[56:26] Thomas ma Matthew Luke there was
[56:29] something different about all of those
[56:32] people God had called them in Luke
[56:38] 9 praise the
[56:42] Lord in Luke 9 verse
[56:49] 23 and he said unto them all if any man
[56:52] will come after me let him deny himself
[56:55] and take up his cross daily and follow
[56:57] me for whosoever will save his life
[57:00] shall lose it but whosoever shall lose
[57:02] his life for my sake the same shall save
[57:05] it for what if a man it's Vantage if he
[57:09] gains the whole world and he loses
[57:11] himself or be Cast Away for whosoever
[57:14] shall be ashamed of me and of my words
[57:17] of him shall the son of man be ashamed
[57:19] when he shall come in his own glory and
[57:21] in his father's and the Holy Angels amen
[57:28] amen let's look at one more example Mark
[57:33] 10
[57:44] amen Mark 10 verse1
[57:48] 17 it says when he was gone forth into
[57:51] the way there came one running
[57:56] and kneel to him and asked him good
[58:00] Master what shall I do that I may
[58:03] inherit eternal
[58:06] life he was so sure that he wanted to
[58:09] follow Jesus Christ he had
[58:13] urgency his request wasn't well I'll
[58:16] just wait till it's convenient that I
[58:17] can get and be in his presence he saw
[58:20] him and he
[58:23] ran and he showed
[58:25] respect he knelt down in front of him
[58:29] and he said Master what can I
[58:31] do to inherit eternal
[58:34] life and Jesus said unto him why callest
[58:38] thou me good there is none good but one
[58:41] and that is God he says Thou knowest the
[58:44] Commandments do not commit adultery do
[58:46] not kill do not steal do not bear false
[58:49] witness defend fraud not honor thy
[58:52] father and mother and he answered and
[58:54] said on him master all these have I
[58:57] observed from my
[58:58] youth he's a much better man than
[59:01] me much
[59:06] better I knew God didn't dwell in the
[59:09] Presbyterian
[59:10] Church I knew he wasn't
[59:15] there but when some people came and
[59:17] talked to me they said oh Bruce they
[59:19] told me about speaking in tongues and
[59:22] and this guy that was a drug dealer
[59:23] getting his life changed and everything
[59:25] else they looked at me and they said you
[59:27] need that and I said you know I I I
[59:30] believe that I believe what you
[59:33] said but I'm having way too much
[59:38] fun it's not my
[59:40] time but one day he passed by he passed
[59:44] by my Shore
[59:47] amen
[59:49] amen and Jesus beholding him loved him
[59:52] and said unto him one thing thou lackest
[59:54] go thy way sell whatever thou Hast and
[59:58] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[59:59] treasure in heaven and come take up thy
[1:00:03] cross and follow
[1:00:05] me and he sat down and he counted the
[1:00:10] cost well he was really excited about
[1:00:13] coming to church because he ran in the
[1:00:16] doors every time the doors were open he
[1:00:18] was right there amen Lord I'm here I'm
[1:00:21] here what can I do to have eternal life
[1:00:24] but you back one thing and when he
[1:00:27] considered where he came from and what
[1:00:31] God was asking him
[1:00:33] for the price was too
[1:00:37] great and he found a way to go back
[1:00:40] brother brandham said he said that Rich
[1:00:42] Young
[1:00:43] Ruler he still stayed in
[1:00:46] church he still stayed in
[1:00:49] church fact he probably built a church
[1:00:52] probably had his name on the Pew
[1:00:54] probably did a lot of great things but
[1:00:57] he had turned down the one that could
[1:01:00] change his
[1:01:02] heart amen
[1:01:05] amen this young fellow he identified
[1:01:08] himself with his own church the price
[1:01:10] was too great so if you remember his
[1:01:13] last identification where we identified
[1:01:16] this young ruler that the opportunity to
[1:01:18] come and follow Jesus he went ahead and
[1:01:20] took his church and he went on he was a
[1:01:23] good boy said he kept the Commandments
[1:01:25] done all these good things he knew just
[1:01:28] as good as any of the rest of them so he
[1:01:30] just take that idea he rejected to
[1:01:33] follow Jesus in his last identification
[1:01:37] we find him in hell was crying to
[1:01:39] Lazarus to come and bring him some
[1:01:43] water now the warning tonight the
[1:01:45] conclusion Tonight is the last
[1:01:49] example because it's the most
[1:01:53] outstanding and that's John
[1:02:07] 21 John 21 it says and after these
[1:02:10] things Jesus showed himself again to the
[1:02:13] disciples at the Sea of tiberias and on
[1:02:16] this wise showed he himself there were
[1:02:20] together Simon Peter and Thomas called
[1:02:22] dius and Nathaniel of Canaan in Galilee
[1:02:26] and the sons of zebon that's Jame and
[1:02:28] John and two the other his
[1:02:30] disciples and Simon Peter said unto them
[1:02:34] I go
[1:02:37] fishing yet he had admitted that he was
[1:02:41] willing to die for
[1:02:43] Christ he had admitted that nothing
[1:02:46] would ever nothing nothing could happen
[1:02:48] to me I'll follow you I'll follow he was
[1:02:52] faithful beside him for three and A2
[1:02:55] years some of us have been faithful
[1:02:57] longer than
[1:02:59] that
[1:03:01] Amen brother brandham said he said how
[1:03:03] they were so
[1:03:06] disappointed they were so
[1:03:10] disappointed when they saw him die they
[1:03:13] didn't understand the word being
[1:03:16] manifested even though the word had been
[1:03:18] preached to them Jesus had told them
[1:03:21] from Palm Sunday he said I have to go to
[1:03:24] Jerusalem I'll be turned over to wicked
[1:03:26] men they will scorge me they will
[1:03:28] crucify me they will hang me I will die
[1:03:31] I will raise three days later amen and
[1:03:35] yet they could not comprehend that
[1:03:39] word they were just like Moses they were
[1:03:43] the word for the
[1:03:45] hour but they
[1:03:48] needed the goods to make it
[1:03:52] live because Simon Peter said unto them
[1:03:55] in verse three he says I go
[1:03:59] fishing he considered his old ways and
[1:04:03] he went back to
[1:04:04] that he went back to the country that he
[1:04:07] had come from that's where Jesus had
[1:04:10] found
[1:04:12] him now in our carnal Minds we would say
[1:04:15] oh God would be done with
[1:04:20] us but God
[1:04:22] wasn't Jesus wasn't done with
[1:04:25] him Peter might have been done but Jesus
[1:04:30] wasn't and Peter's influence was so
[1:04:33] great that all those disciples in verse
[1:04:36] two followed
[1:04:38] Peter and they went forth and they
[1:04:40] entered into a ship immediately and that
[1:04:42] night they caught
[1:04:45] nothing but when the morning was now
[1:04:48] come Jesus stood on the shore but the
[1:04:50] disciples knew not that it was Jesus
[1:04:54] so often while this is going to play
[1:04:58] out people are going to be dying in the
[1:05:02] faith not receiving the
[1:05:06] promises right brother
[1:05:09] Marty didn't receive the
[1:05:12] promise Donnie
[1:05:14] Reagan his daughter passed
[1:05:17] away then receive the
[1:05:21] promise what if Billy Paul passes away
[1:05:27] how many prophecies are people going to
[1:05:29] say oh but I thought he said I thought
[1:05:31] he said I thought this would happen I
[1:05:33] thought that would happen I thought this
[1:05:35] was going to happen if you consider the
[1:05:38] place you came from even today the
[1:05:41] choice is
[1:05:42] yours today brother Marty the choice is
[1:05:46] yours you can consider the country you
[1:05:48] came
[1:05:49] from you can say there's nothing to this
[1:05:53] nothing to it I'm going back brother
[1:05:57] renam said they were so disappointed
[1:06:00] they had went away to their fishing nets
[1:06:02] Peter said I go fishing and the
[1:06:04] disciples said well we'll just go with
[1:06:05] you and they did and they were all
[1:06:08] together tore up and disappointed there
[1:06:10] they had watched they took his body down
[1:06:12] they wrapped it in some linen they laid
[1:06:14] it in the grave and they said well
[1:06:16] that's the finish of that fanatic how
[1:06:18] the world was against him they said he
[1:06:20] was a Holy Roller he was insane he was a
[1:06:23] fanatic so forth but he said he was God
[1:06:28] he looked like him he acted like him he
[1:06:32] proved he was God that's
[1:06:36] right and Jesus said unto them children
[1:06:39] have you any meat and they answered him
[1:06:41] no and he said cast your net on the
[1:06:43] right side of the ship and you shall
[1:06:47] find I wonder if Simon even recognized
[1:06:50] his voice when he said
[1:06:53] that but when he put the fish when he
[1:06:55] put the net in there and he saw those
[1:06:58] fishes his eyes came
[1:07:01] open he came open you know he is the
[1:07:04] first one to jump out of the
[1:07:06] [Laughter]
[1:07:07] boat he jumped out of the boat and ran
[1:07:11] to
[1:07:13] him and that's the best
[1:07:16] part the choice tonight is
[1:07:18] yours oh you might get discouraged and
[1:07:21] you might decide there ain't nothing to
[1:07:24] this message but if God has elected you
[1:07:27] before the foundation of the
[1:07:30] world Jesus will have a message for
[1:07:33] you because you could say oh look Peter
[1:07:36] Peter backslid back Peter you know he
[1:07:39] blasphemed I can show you in the
[1:07:40] scriptures he said he blasphemed he
[1:07:43] cursed he said I don't know this man but
[1:07:46] God never rote him off he never rote him
[1:07:49] off even if he went back to his old ways
[1:07:51] he never rote him off because when he he
[1:07:54] came down and he ate the fish Jesus
[1:07:56] looked at him and said
[1:07:59] Peter he
[1:08:00] says I got a message for
[1:08:04] you I got some
[1:08:06] Lambs Do You Love
[1:08:09] Me Do You Love Me Above All
[1:08:13] Else tonight do you love him above all
[1:08:17] else if they close the doors do you
[1:08:20] still love me if they outlaw us do you
[1:08:23] still love me do you still love me if
[1:08:26] your family and everybody turns against
[1:08:28] you do you still love me if there's no
[1:08:30] songs there's
[1:08:33] nothing the choice is
[1:08:36] yours tonight the choice is
[1:08:39] yours amen if they were mindful of the
[1:08:44] city that they'd come out of they'd have
[1:08:46] sought an opportunity to go
[1:08:52] back I ain't going anywhere
[1:08:55] any let's bow our
[1:08:58] heads dear Lord Jesus Heavenly Father we
[1:09:02] thank you Lord for your
[1:09:04] love we thank you Lord for your mercy

[1:09:08] exhausted
[1:09:10] Lord we're Sinners
[1:09:13] we're we're trapped in these bodies but
[1:09:17] Heavenly Father you place something down
[1:09:19] inside of us Lord that every time we
[1:09:21] hear the word it leaps it jumps
[1:09:26] Elizabeth said the first time she said
[1:09:28] that the name of Jesus was mentioned and
[1:09:31] it hit my ears my baby that had been
[1:09:34] dead no evidence none all the prayers
[1:09:38] nothing happened but as soon as it heard
[1:09:41] it the right time the right place the
[1:09:44] right hour it
[1:09:48] leapt
[1:09:50] amen we are looking for that day we're
[1:09:54] looking for that day for that Holy
[1:09:56] Spirit Lord it'll come one more time
[1:09:59] it'll shake the foundations of the
[1:10:01] church it'll shake the foundations of
[1:10:04] the Believers Lord Jesus and until that
[1:10:07] time we'll keep singing your Praises
[1:10:10] we'll keep worshiping you huj Lord Jesus
[1:10:14] we're looking for you to fulfill your
[1:10:16] promise because it's your word you chose
[1:10:19] us you brought us here you saved us you
[1:10:22] set us on a Solid Rock Lord Jesus take
[1:10:26] us the rest of the way we love you
[1:10:29] father we commit this service we commit
[1:10:32] these Believers we
[1:10:34] commit all of them into your hands for
[1:10:36] your safekeeping we love you father in
[1:10:40] Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen amen
