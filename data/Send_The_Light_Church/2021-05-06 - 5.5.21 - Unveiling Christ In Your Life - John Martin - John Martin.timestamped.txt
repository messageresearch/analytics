[34:05] revealed to us may we see more plainly
[34:08] more
[34:08] clearly our position with you lord
[34:12] lord we commit the furtherance of the
[34:14] service in your hands
[34:15] we ask god that you meet the many needs
[34:18] that would be amongst us for we commit
[34:20] them all into your hands now by faith in
[34:22] jesus christ's name we pray
[34:24] amen amen god bless you turn with me
[34:27] if you would to the book of second
[34:30] corinthians
[34:31] chapter four we're going to have three
[34:34] scriptural readings before we have you
[34:35] be seated
[34:37] amen and as we're as you're turning
[34:41] there i want to
[34:42] let you know the the subject today is
[34:45] the process of manifesting christ so as
[34:47] we're
[34:48] reading these scriptures i want us to be
[34:50] thinking about the process
[34:52] of manifesting christ entitled this
[34:54] message unveiling of christ in your life
[34:57] amen
[34:57] second corinthians chapter four starting
[35:00] with verse number 16
[35:03] for which calls we faint
[35:06] not but though our outward
[35:10] man perish yet the inward man
[35:14] is renewed day by day
[35:18] for our light affliction which is but
[35:21] for a moment
[35:22] worketh for us a far more exceeding
[35:25] and eternal weight of glory while we
[35:29] look not at
[35:30] the things which are seen but the things
[35:32] which are not seen for the things which
[35:34] are
[35:35] seen are temporal but the things which
[35:38] are not seen are eternal
[35:41] amen and then colossians chapter one
[35:46] colossians chapter one i'm wondering how
[35:49] come i'm not hearing very
[35:51] many of the pages you know turning
[35:56] you all got your bible don't you
[35:58] colossians chapter 1
[36:01] starting with verse number 26
[36:05] even the mystery which have been hid
[36:08] from
[36:08] ages and from generations but now is
[36:11] made manifest to his saints
[36:14] to whom god would make known what is the
[36:16] riches
[36:17] of the glory of this mystery among the
[36:20] gentiles
[36:21] which is christ in you
[36:24] the hope of glory whom we preach
[36:28] warning every man teaching every man
[36:32] in all wisdom for the purpose that we
[36:35] may present
[36:36] every man perfect in christ jesus
[36:40] whereunto i also labor striving
[36:42] according to his working
[36:44] which worketh in me mightily amen
[36:47] and then just first john chapter
[36:51] 3 first john chapter 3. very
[36:54] familiar scripture of course this whole
[36:58] book ought to become
[36:59] feel very familiar to us amen
[37:03] first john chapter 3 verse number 1
[37:06] behold
[37:08] verse 1 behold what matter of love the
[37:10] father bestowed upon us that we
[37:12] should be called the sons of god
[37:15] therefore the world knoweth us not
[37:17] because it knew him not
[37:19] beloved now are we the sons of god
[37:24] and it doth not yet appear what we shall
[37:26] be
[37:27] but we know that when he shall appear we
[37:30] shall be like him for we shall see him
[37:34] as he is and every man that have this
[37:38] hope in him purifyeth himself
[37:42] even as he is pure
[37:45] amen god bless you you may be seated
[37:52] may the lord
[37:56] have his way with each of us tonight
[37:59] amen
[38:02] i really like what brother ron said it's
[38:04] our responsibility to lift up christ
[38:06] that's right if we don't do it nobody
[38:09] else
[38:10] is going to that's right amen how many
[38:13] has been trying to remember all the
[38:14] benefits of the lord
[38:16] since last service it's
[38:19] not always easy when we're caught up
[38:23] in different things but i want us to
[38:26] remember
[38:27] it is our responsibility to the lord he
[38:32] said forget not
[38:34] putting the responsibility upon us
[38:37] means we no longer can say oh i'm sorry
[38:41] i forgot you know how often we've
[38:44] said that to one another oh i'm sorry i
[38:47] forgot
[38:49] lord put the responsibility in us to
[38:51] remember all the benefits that he's
[38:53] given us
[38:55] it's a benefit just to come here to the
[38:57] house of the lord
[38:59] that's why brother branham said we ought
[39:00] to have that attitude i can't wait
[39:03] to get there i can't wait to those doors
[39:06] because of the benefit
[39:07] that we have amen well
[39:11] i want to start off by saying we are a
[39:14] seed
[39:14] of god amen and it brings comfort and
[39:18] security to know that
[39:20] now are we the sons of god that's right
[39:23] amen right now right now we
[39:26] are a son of god amen but it also brings
[39:30] forth
[39:31] the responsibility to manifest that
[39:36] just not get quiet on that part because
[39:39] we have to manifest what we say we are
[39:42] and every man that has this hope inside
[39:46] of him
[39:46] he purifies himself
[39:50] if we always remain a seed and never
[39:54] manifest it will never fulfill the
[39:55] purpose
[39:56] in which it was brought forth jesus said
[39:59] unless the seed
[40:00] dies and falls into the ground unless it
[40:03] rots
[40:03] it abides alone so
[40:07] our death is this outside nature
[40:11] has to come off to manifest christ
[40:15] amen so the seed of god
[40:20] is not satisfied with just saying
[40:23] i'm a seed of god amen it just
[40:26] it doesn't work anymore there's a deep
[40:29] calling inside of the bride
[40:31] to manifest christ and it's an honor
[40:34] it's a privilege
[40:36] we've got to manifest christ in the
[40:39] flesh
[40:40] in this age more than any other age that
[40:43] there's been
[40:44] more word has been given so more more of
[40:47] manifestation
[40:48] is required in the age of
[40:52] pentecost well we can manifest the gifts
[40:56] and it wouldn't even really matter what
[40:59] seed you were because the
[41:00] rain falls on the just in the unjust sea
[41:03] and gifts are given out
[41:04] elvis presley had a gift that's
[41:07] true but in this age the last age
[41:10] the bride will be like christ
[41:13] will manifest the nature of christ
[41:18] and it's a responsibility
[41:25] in the day that john lived he said it
[41:27] did not
[41:28] yet appear what we shall be
[41:32] but the mystery had been hid from ages
[41:34] and from generation
[41:36] and now is made manifest to the saints
[41:39] to whom
[41:40] god would make known the riches of the
[41:43] glory of this mystery among
[41:44] the gentiles which is christ in you
[41:48] the hope of glory that's the whole
[41:51] mystery now
[41:52] amen how hard it is to
[41:56] to get somebody to believe that god is
[41:58] in you
[41:59] trying to talk to them about what they
[42:01] need to be doing
[42:06] god is making this mystery known
[42:10] he's unveiling himself not just behind a
[42:14] pulpit
[42:16] but he's unveiling himself in the pride
[42:22] we are his bride he's unveiling
[42:26] in your temple
[42:29] whom we preach warning every man and
[42:32] teaching every man in all wisdom
[42:33] that we may present every man perfect in
[42:36] christ jesus we see
[42:38] the reason of a fivefold ministry
[42:42] because that five-fold ministry is to
[42:45] present us
[42:46] perfect yes amen the message of the hour
[42:49] was not to warn every man about
[42:51] denominations and that god sent a
[42:53] prophet
[42:54] that was not the reason
[42:58] this message was to present us perfect
[43:01] to jesus christ
[43:02] a bride without spot or wrinkle that's
[43:05] what this message was for
[43:11] so we could manifest that jesus is the
[43:13] same yesterday today and forever
[43:16] yes part of that that message
[43:19] that message that the prophet brought
[43:22] showing that the discernment and
[43:25] speaking at the well
[43:26] and telling what's happening in your
[43:28] life and those were
[43:30] the the things that attracted
[43:34] that attracted the woman at the well
[43:36] that attracted the people in this age
[43:40] and he tried and he said look jesus
[43:42] christ is the same yesterday today and
[43:44] forever
[43:45] but that was not the end of hebrews 13
[43:48] 8 that was the beginning for the bride
[43:52] we now
[43:52] have to become the manifestation of that
[43:56] we too have to manifest christ brother
[43:59] branham was the sh
[44:00] the wave chief for this age
[44:08] whereunto i also labor striving
[44:11] according to his working
[44:13] which worketh in me mightily
[44:16] paul was faithful warning every man
[44:20] teaching every man in all wisdom and he
[44:23] didn't have
[44:24] a respect to persons he wanted everyone
[44:27] to be perfect
[44:30] he carried a burden
[44:33] he didn't
[44:37] have favorites
[44:40] just like jesus he don't got favorites
[44:43] he gives everybody a chance he gave
[44:47] judas a chance
[44:50] he didn't treat the others better than
[44:52] judas
[44:55] and when the the power of god is so
[44:57] strong in your life
[44:59] you can't even think with respect to
[45:01] persons you don't think about what
[45:03] somebody did
[45:04] to use you to hurt you to talk behind
[45:06] your back you don't even think like that
[45:08] because the love of god think is no evil
[45:15] all these warnings and teaching and
[45:18] wisdom
[45:19] and sanctifying and cleansing with the
[45:21] washing of the water
[45:22] by the word can often seem overwhelming
[45:28] as we're going through the process we
[45:31] barely make it through the day
[45:32] we think we've achieved something by
[45:34] making it to church
[45:38] but i'll just say it like this these
[45:40] warnings and these teachings and
[45:42] this correcting the sanctifying this
[45:45] washing
[45:46] it's needful in the process of
[45:49] manifesting christ
[45:53] will never be able to let christ shine
[45:56] forth
[45:56] without it second corinthians chapter 4
[46:00] verse 16
[46:02] for which calls we faint not
[46:07] for the which cause we faint not but
[46:09] though
[46:10] our outward man perish yet the inward
[46:14] man
[46:14] is renewed day by day amen how is that
[46:18] outward man
[46:19] perishing the word comes forth
[46:23] and it cuts off the carnality the flesh
[46:26] that old nature
[46:30] that word does the carving
[46:36] and the old man is perishing and you
[46:39] feel so
[46:42] like i'm losing control of my life and i
[46:44] don't get to do what i want and
[46:47] but the inward man is being renewed
[46:52] god don't leave you they're cut
[46:56] his life shines forth
[47:00] for our light affliction which is
[47:04] but for a moment worketh for us
[47:07] a far more exceeding an eternal
[47:11] weight of glory so you know it's on the
[47:14] balance here
[47:15] right i'm going to make a trade with you
[47:18] i'm going to sell my car to you
[47:21] i'm going to sell my car for five
[47:23] hundred thousand dollars and you're
[47:25] going to buy it
[47:27] well he's going to get a a a fifty
[47:31] thousand dollar car
[47:33] and i'm gonna get five hundred thousand
[47:36] dollars
[47:37] that's a good deal for me
[47:42] not a good deal for him not a good deal
[47:45] for our flesh
[47:48] but it's a real good deal for our inner
[47:50] man
[47:52] the things that we got to give up the
[47:54] obedience to the word of god the
[47:56] the laying down our lord it's a light
[47:58] affliction it's only going to last a
[48:00] little bit
[48:04] but what's going to we're gonna get out
[48:05] of it amen is
[48:07] love joy peace i'll tell you to be about
[48:09] to have
[48:10] love no matter what anybody does to me
[48:13] the
[48:13] the value of the realness of that cannot
[48:16] be
[48:17] bought or compared with anything in this
[48:19] world
[48:21] because you cannot
[48:24] mimic that
[48:30] you can try
[48:34] you can't get worn by a painted picture
[48:40] amen this process of putting off
[48:43] the old and letting the seed of god
[48:46] manifest
[48:48] it's like you're a seed of god
[48:53] you're uh god is in you the light's in
[48:55] you the holy ghost is in you
[48:57] and all you have to do is take the
[48:59] bushel off the light
[49:02] you just got to take the flesh off
[49:05] of god
[49:10] i hope you're catching it verse 18 while
[49:12] we look not at the things which are seen
[49:15] but the things which are not seen for
[49:18] the things which are seen are temporal
[49:20] i got this going on i've got that going
[49:22] on i got that's our all
[49:24] scene we've got to look at what's not
[49:27] seen
[49:28] we've got to have a vision of christ in
[49:30] us the hope of glory
[49:31] [Music]
[49:36] i want to say a few things about
[49:37] michelangelo
[49:40] brother branham talked about
[49:42] michelangelo
[49:44] brother alex talked about michelangelo
[49:47] brother bruce talked about michelangelo
[49:51] i would like to say a few things about
[49:53] michelangelo
[49:56] he was a famous italian renaissance
[49:59] artist
[50:00] and considered by some to be
[50:03] the greatest sculptor of all times of
[50:06] history
[50:07] amen now i can relate to some of the
[50:09] things that he believed in
[50:14] one of those things is he believed in a
[50:16] continual process
[50:19] his parting words at age 88 which at
[50:22] that time
[50:23] you were fortunate if you lived to 40.
[50:26] his parting words at 88 this is his
[50:29] parting words at 88 years old
[50:31] he said i'm still learning
[50:36] he believed in the continual process he
[50:39] was a visionary
[50:41] he didn't have an attitude of let's just
[50:42] get this thing done and get out of the
[50:44] way let's just get church
[50:45] done you know i got things i got to do
[50:48] one of his famous quotes couple of i'm
[50:50] going to read two of them
[50:52] he said every block of stone has a
[50:55] statue inside of it
[50:57] it is the task of the sculpture to
[50:59] discover it
[51:03] another one is i saw the angel in the
[51:06] marble
[51:07] and i carved until i set him free
[51:13] he saw moses inside that marble
[51:18] and he chipped away until moses was
[51:21] there
[51:24] that's exactly what god wants to do in
[51:26] our lives
[51:28] he has a vision the image of his son
[51:32] inside of us amen and he wants to chip
[51:36] away that old
[51:37] carnal nature until only thing left
[51:40] is the image of jesus christ now he has
[51:43] predestinated us to this image
[51:46] yes he sees his son in you
[51:49] and wants to carve away until you have
[51:52] been
[51:53] set free from your flesh
[51:58] it's the only thing that's holding his
[51:59] back his flesh
[52:02] set free to serve him in the way that
[52:04] you've been predestinated to serve him
[52:08] we believe in predestination amen not
[52:11] just
[52:11] salvation
[52:14] what predestinated to manifest christ
[52:18] and we have that opportunity all day
[52:21] long
[52:22] in every situation especially when we're
[52:25] going into the furnace when we're
[52:26] getting thrown in the lion's den
[52:28] when we're
[52:33] god uses the tools of the fivefold
[52:35] ministry
[52:36] to keep chick chipping away and carving
[52:39] away
[52:40] at the things that are in our life
[52:44] he's the potter we're the clay
[52:48] the song goes have thine own way thou at
[52:50] the potter i am the clay
[52:51] mow me and make me after thy will
[52:54] while i am waiting yielded and still
[52:59] we need to be still know that it's god
[53:02] who's doing the chipping away
[53:04] it isn't some man behind the pulpit say
[53:06] you need to be better
[53:08] [Music]
[53:10] listen there's a man here and there's a
[53:12] man there
[53:14] we are in the flesh but we are
[53:17] also a spirit man we have an inward man
[53:22] and it's up to us to be
[53:25] in the spirit when the word of the
[53:28] spirit of the word
[53:29] is being preached amen because if it
[53:32] falls on the wrong ground
[53:34] a carnal mindset well then we're gonna
[53:37] have a pitchfork
[53:39] that belongs to somebody else i'm not do
[53:41] i'm fine
[53:43] or we're going to become judgmental
[53:44] about what's being said
[53:48] i want you to think about this the only
[53:50] thing that the sculpture does
[53:52] is carve away what isn't the image
[53:57] he never cuts away at the image itself
[54:01] he leaves the image intact so you don't
[54:04] have to worry
[54:05] about the word unchristianizing you
[54:12] how many wants to be in his image then
[54:14] you say amen to the word
[54:16] and don't get critical of the preaching
[54:20] great peace have they that loved thy law
[54:22] and nothing shall
[54:24] offend them i want you to think about
[54:27] your your your walk with the lord
[54:30] god is wanting to carve away everything
[54:34] that's
[54:34] around you that nature that anything
[54:37] that
[54:38] isn't of god to take it away so he can
[54:41] shine
[54:41] out of you that's all he's trying to do
[54:44] amen
[54:48] the thing is that old nature ain't
[54:49] coming off in you unless you say yes
[54:51] lord
[54:52] yes take it lord take it take it take it
[54:54] i'm sick of it take it out of here
[54:58] he can't go against your will
[55:02] if your heart's desires to be in his
[55:04] image then eagerly
[55:06] hunger for the word to carve away every
[55:09] part
[55:10] that's hiding the image of christ inside
[55:13] you because
[55:14] now you are the son of god
[55:17] today you are well what are we waiting
[55:20] for
[55:20] we're waiting for that to manifest
[55:25] to so the world can see
[55:29] you know they're not going to see until
[55:30] you get hot water
[55:35] when everything's going good oh yes i'm
[55:37] a christian i love everybody
[55:39] but just wait everything's against you
[55:42] wait till the chips are down
[55:43] that is the time to shine
[55:46] arise and shine the prophet said
[55:55] instead of sitting
[55:59] at the seed of judgment in church
[56:03] dissecting the preaching let the word
[56:06] carve away your carnality your old
[56:10] nature
[56:10] your excuses your selfishness your pride
[56:13] and anything
[56:14] that god's speaking to you just let him
[56:16] have his way
[56:20] hold over my being absolute sway
[56:24] filled with thy spirit till all shall
[56:25] see christ
[56:27] only always living in me
[56:32] yeah we can go out there and we can
[56:33] leave here and we can be so determined
[56:35] that we're going to do something for
[56:36] christ be
[56:37] be something handle a certain situation
[56:40] and the rest of time
[56:41] just be yourself
[56:44] this is the hour of the unveiling of
[56:46] christ in the bride
[56:49] this is where we shine amen
[56:52] this is our hour more than any other
[56:56] hour
[57:01] it's like i don't want to know what i
[57:04] know
[57:04] and i want to know what you know i want
[57:07] to see christ in you
[57:08] you want to see christ in me i want to
[57:10] see christ in me
[57:12] because it is the hope of glory christ
[57:15] in me not
[57:16] christ knowledge not quoting but christ
[57:19] in me manifested
[57:21] because if christ is in you he will
[57:24] manifest
[57:26] you walk around a person that's so full
[57:27] of the love of god and tell me you won't
[57:29] feel it
[57:37] brother branham just let me just talk to
[57:39] you just a moment
[57:42] he would know what spirit he's dealing
[57:44] with
[57:46] it's invisible but you can see
[57:53] there's the fruit of the spirit
[57:56] right now you cannot
[58:00] see joy or peace in my heart
[58:05] you give me enough time it will be
[58:06] manifested
[58:12] we just want this shell to come off
[58:18] you've got to vision what god visions of
[58:21] you
[58:23] god knows exactly the image we are to be
[58:27] and how our nature is supposed to be
[58:33] did you know god is excited to go to
[58:36] church
[58:38] i want you to think about that we often
[58:41] think about whether
[58:42] we want to go whether we're excited to
[58:43] go is there
[58:45] we've even been to a place of trying to
[58:46] make an excuse so we didn't have to go
[58:50] but god is actually excited for church
[58:54] to meet with us and to work with us
[58:56] because
[58:57] he sees a masterpiece coming
[59:01] and he's inspired to carve away the
[59:03] worldly nature
[59:07] he's the anointed word not a dead letter
[59:11] an anointed word of power hebrews
[59:13] chapter 4 verse 12 says for the word of
[59:16] god
[59:16] is quick and powerful and sharper than
[59:20] any two-edged sword piercing even to the
[59:23] dividing that's under the soul and
[59:25] spirit the joints of marrow and as a
[59:26] discerner the thoughts
[59:27] and intents of the heart amen god comes
[59:31] to carve away
[59:32] everything that's not his image
[59:36] that's what the word does now you
[59:38] respect the word
[59:40] and you say that's god or you dilute the
[59:42] word
[59:43] and you say that's just a man
[59:49] come on
[59:52] what's he doing when he's going to
[59:53] church he's cutting away
[59:56] everything that's not him he so long
[59:59] wants to see himself in us now we've
[1:00:02] already testified we are a seed we
[1:00:04] are a son of god it's time to let
[1:00:07] everything else go so it can shine
[1:00:09] it's it there's nothing more to this
[1:00:12] it's simple god is hid
[1:00:13] in simplicity we keep wrestling
[1:00:24] god don't want isms in the church
[1:00:33] that's not manifesting christ
[1:00:37] well i wouldn't do this if they wouldn't
[1:00:38] do this
[1:00:42] that's like saying i'd be a christian if
[1:00:44] everybody else was
[1:00:48] your light supposed to shine when
[1:00:49] there's not
[1:00:54] you know the true church is not the
[1:00:55] building
[1:01:00] you're in charge of your church you're
[1:01:03] in charge of your church
[1:01:07] let it shine let your church be full
[1:01:10] praises to god
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:15] god is inspired every time you come to
[1:01:18] church he's inspired
[1:01:20] to carve away your nature he knows how
[1:01:24] to do it just like michelangelo
[1:01:26] he just he he saw the angel in there he
[1:01:28] saw moses in there he saw what he wanted
[1:01:31] to see in that marble
[1:01:33] and he did not want to come close to
[1:01:36] chipping
[1:01:37] at the real image that he saw
[1:01:41] god don't want to chip away at what is
[1:01:44] good that's going on in your life
[1:01:47] he's not trying to chip away christ
[1:01:51] he's trying to chip away the things that
[1:01:53] aren't amen
[1:01:54] we just got to get out of the carnality
[1:01:57] of you know why does he keep saying this
[1:01:59] and why is it
[1:01:59] why isn't it just uplifting
[1:02:08] can you imagine the marbles hey put that
[1:02:11] back that hurt
[1:02:13] it wasn't part of the image god knows
[1:02:17] what he's doing
[1:02:19] we just got to be serious mature
[1:02:23] about what church is about amen when we
[1:02:26] listen to a tape
[1:02:27] it isn't to find something just
[1:02:28] encouraging it isn't just about finding
[1:02:31] something new or verifying something we
[1:02:32] want verified it's about becoming more
[1:02:35] in his image
[1:02:35] and that takes a dying and a rottening
[1:02:37] out
[1:02:43] god is coming to church to unveil christ
[1:02:46] in you
[1:02:47] the hope of glory he wants to see
[1:02:51] himself
[1:02:51] reflected in our lives christ
[1:02:55] only always living in me amen
[1:02:58] and that's through the power it can only
[1:03:00] be through the power of the holy ghost
[1:03:01] living
[1:03:02] inside of us now he wants to speak his
[1:03:06] word
[1:03:08] and he wants you to speak the word yes
[1:03:12] remember at the at the end of this
[1:03:17] masterpiece of the fine-tuning of the
[1:03:21] sandpapers and the files and the
[1:03:25] polishing it was so real i've actually
[1:03:28] spent time
[1:03:30] uh studying the the sculpture moles i
[1:03:34] don't know if you've ever seen pictures
[1:03:35] of it but it is
[1:03:36] amazing it is amazing you look at it
[1:03:39] and it shows power in his muscles
[1:03:43] horns coming from his head he's getting
[1:03:45] ready to get off the seat he's got the
[1:03:47] commandments
[1:03:48] it's just powerful
[1:03:55] at the end this is
[1:03:59] as far you know legend says
[1:04:02] but it was so real to him he wanted
[1:04:05] moses
[1:04:06] to speak
[1:04:10] when we become so much in his image
[1:04:13] brother adam says he gives you the
[1:04:15] chapbook
[1:04:17] whatever you see wants you to speak the
[1:04:20] word
[1:04:22] it takes a maturity to take that word
[1:04:25] and believe it it
[1:04:26] is jesus christ speaking it out of your
[1:04:28] mouth and not just you
[1:04:32] it needs to become that real to you
[1:04:39] romans chapter 8 verse 29 says for whom
[1:04:41] he did for no he
[1:04:42] also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:04:46] to the image of his son that he might be
[1:04:50] the firstborn
[1:04:51] among us right
[1:04:55] so we're predestinated not just to be a
[1:04:58] child of god
[1:05:00] but a manifested child of god yes
[1:05:03] there's the responsibility comes in we
[1:05:06] can say amen to the
[1:05:08] i'm a child of god amen i'm
[1:05:10] predestinated
[1:05:11] now we need to say amen i'm going to
[1:05:13] manifest more
[1:05:14] i'm going to allow that word to carve
[1:05:16] away what's what's not him in my life
[1:05:19] and though none go with me if i'm the
[1:05:21] only one in the church lord let it be me
[1:05:24] that's what we need don't look to the
[1:05:26] left don't look to the right don't
[1:05:28] don't compare yourself with anybody
[1:05:30] what's important is that this word
[1:05:31] is number one in your life
[1:05:37] brother branham speaking on michelangelo
[1:05:38] and enticing spirits he said it cost him
[1:05:40] his life
[1:05:42] and when he got to where he thought it
[1:05:44] was so perfect
[1:05:46] he become so thrilled at the image of
[1:05:48] moses so he struck it
[1:05:50] uh struck the knee of it and said speak
[1:05:52] moses
[1:05:53] it looked so real it was so patterned so
[1:05:57] perfect until it looked so much like
[1:06:00] moses
[1:06:01] to his thought that he struck it with
[1:06:03] the hammer to make it have
[1:06:05] feeling
[1:06:12] god wants you to feel like you are his
[1:06:14] bride
[1:06:16] amen that there is
[1:06:19] nothing to fear that you can stand upon
[1:06:22] the word and that word is for you
[1:06:26] to have the feeling of christ living
[1:06:28] inside of you that
[1:06:29] then somebody slaps you on the cheek you
[1:06:32] can turn the other one
[1:06:34] if somebody asks you to do something you
[1:06:35] say no i'll do that i'll give two miles
[1:06:37] for you
[1:06:39] feeling with it he wants you to believe
[1:06:42] that you're a believer that you can live
[1:06:44] this word
[1:06:49] not just some religious talk
[1:06:58] but a christ like walk
[1:07:01] he said puts in the mind of the church
[1:07:05] no matter how much you substitute
[1:07:09] how big a congregation you get or how
[1:07:12] well you sing
[1:07:12] songs or how good your congregation
[1:07:15] dresses
[1:07:16] how much you got this that or the other
[1:07:18] you could strike and feel whatever
[1:07:22] i'll never it'll never take the place of
[1:07:24] the life
[1:07:25] until christ comes down in the form of
[1:07:28] the holy ghost
[1:07:29] into that church and gives it a new
[1:07:31] experience of being born again
[1:07:33] amen it'll never take place of god's
[1:07:36] word
[1:07:37] god's word stands alone so notice what
[1:07:39] we're trying to get
[1:07:41] is the realness of christ to come forth
[1:07:44] the whole world is oh yeah i got christ
[1:07:47] and i can prove it
[1:07:49] some prove it with tongues some prove it
[1:07:51] their names on the book some prove it
[1:07:53] with
[1:07:54] my mom and my dad and and i've gotten
[1:07:56] baptized and i had this thing happen to
[1:07:58] me and god used me and god did this
[1:08:01] and that's wonderful but what about just
[1:08:03] simply your life being lived
[1:08:04] in a mess messy world where are you
[1:08:07] standing in those situations
[1:08:11] we don't want to turn it on and off this
[1:08:13] is the time to to get
[1:08:15] to for us to look at our lives and
[1:08:17] realize that we're not where we need to
[1:08:19] be
[1:08:20] and what we need to do is get rid of
[1:08:21] this old nature so christ can shine
[1:08:24] and women he can come into church with
[1:08:26] that and say god share all my rights
[1:08:28] away
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:33] that just pleases the lord
[1:08:36] god's hidden simplicity like that you
[1:08:38] know
[1:08:41] god is not wanting to carve a little of
[1:08:43] your flesh away
[1:08:48] just so we can pretend we got the rest
[1:08:51] he doesn't want to dress you in some
[1:08:53] kind of carnal form of godliness
[1:08:56] he doesn't want a substitute he wants us
[1:09:00] to have the genuine image
[1:09:01] shining forth and the only way it can
[1:09:03] happen
[1:09:05] is for us to get this out of the way you
[1:09:07] think about this i want you to think of
[1:09:08] your
[1:09:09] your your carnal nature as clouds
[1:09:15] the sun was shining so beautiful today
[1:09:20] and yesterday
[1:09:23] i i don't know if y'all seen it
[1:09:27] probably didn't because there's all the
[1:09:28] clouds in the way
[1:09:30] but it was still shining amen it was
[1:09:33] still the sun was out there
[1:09:38] for you to say i wish the sun would
[1:09:39] shine it's just silly the sun is shining
[1:09:42] it didn't get turned off behind the
[1:09:44] clouds
[1:09:45] god is still in you the hope of glory
[1:09:48] still in you
[1:09:50] you just got to get the clouds out of
[1:09:51] the way and let them shine
[1:09:53] it will create an atmosphere it will
[1:09:56] create a home it'll create
[1:09:57] what's needed in every relationship
[1:10:05] he wants our life to speak his word to
[1:10:07] the lost
[1:10:08] and to the dying christ
[1:10:12] in you the hope of glory i'll say it
[1:10:14] like this
[1:10:15] christ in you is the only is is the only
[1:10:18] hope
[1:10:18] that anybody will have of making it to
[1:10:20] glory
[1:10:23] god does not give us a ministry of
[1:10:24] reconciliation and say no you don't have
[1:10:26] to do it if you don't want to
[1:10:28] there is a purpose in you sharing god
[1:10:30] with somebody
[1:10:34] think about this it's not just the job
[1:10:36] of the ministry
[1:10:39] imagine right now
[1:10:42] if there was no ministry behind the
[1:10:44] pulpit
[1:10:46] you got you just think about the twelve
[1:10:48] disciples
[1:10:49] never said okay well we're gonna have
[1:10:51] church
[1:10:53] come gather they went out go he out
[1:11:00] one on one one on two
[1:11:03] get three or four you all can be doing
[1:11:06] this
[1:11:06] outside of this church
[1:11:10] and that is your responsibility to god
[1:11:15] and when you get them hooked say come
[1:11:18] come
[1:11:22] but it's all of our responsibility
[1:11:25] romans chapter 8 verse 20
[1:11:30] for the creature was made subject
[1:11:33] to vanity that's us
[1:11:38] not willing we didn't want it but by
[1:11:40] reason
[1:11:41] of him who has subjected the same
[1:11:44] in hope there was a reason god allowed
[1:11:48] us
[1:11:48] to be born in sin shapened in iniquity
[1:11:55] the the the wonder and the pleasure
[1:12:02] the honor the glory that god gets
[1:12:06] from seeing his seed fight through
[1:12:09] that carnality of of of of a selfish
[1:12:13] flesh
[1:12:14] and to blew forth of serving god and
[1:12:17] living for others
[1:12:19] what an awesome thing that god
[1:12:21] experiences
[1:12:27] he's not just pleased with me saying
[1:12:31] i know i'm a seed of god
[1:12:35] it's got to start with that but it don't
[1:12:37] end with that
[1:12:39] it's got to end with the manifestation
[1:12:41] of that just give me a chance to show
[1:12:43] christ is in me
[1:12:47] you know what you're asking for right
[1:12:48] it's the same thing as asking for
[1:12:49] patience
[1:12:57] because the creature itself also
[1:13:01] shall be delivered
[1:13:04] from the bondage we are going to be
[1:13:08] delivered from this bondage and if you
[1:13:11] can believe you can have more
[1:13:12] deliverance
[1:13:13] you will and the more you're waiting
[1:13:17] around
[1:13:17] for the rapture to happen to do it all
[1:13:19] you're going to miss out of
[1:13:20] what how much christ can be manifested
[1:13:23] and how much you can be delivered today
[1:13:25] amen it's okay in this age to be
[1:13:29] expecting god doing more in your life
[1:13:31] this age you can because this is the age
[1:13:34] we're fully supposed to manifest christ
[1:13:41] because the creature itself shall also
[1:13:43] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:13:44] corruption into the glorious
[1:13:47] liberty of the children of god
[1:13:51] amen not the glorious liberty to do what
[1:13:54] your flesh wants
[1:13:56] to the children friend no the children
[1:13:58] of god what they do they're born of
[1:13:59] god's will
[1:14:02] for we know that the whole creation
[1:14:06] groaneth and travaileth
[1:14:09] something's going on in pain together
[1:14:13] until now
[1:14:16] they're waiting for this unveiling of
[1:14:18] christ in you
[1:14:22] and not only they but ourselves also
[1:14:25] which have the first fruits of the
[1:14:27] spirit even we
[1:14:29] ourselves grown within ourselves waiting
[1:14:32] for the adoption to with the redemption
[1:14:34] of our bodies
[1:14:37] i can't stand this pest house
[1:14:40] i want to manifest christ
[1:14:44] yep i i'm flesh too and i would like
[1:14:48] to escape the pain of just
[1:14:51] wishing that i was out of here and that
[1:14:53] i could just
[1:14:54] get out of here without having to
[1:14:56] manifest it
[1:14:59] i'm so sick of this world when i get out
[1:15:00] of here
[1:15:02] how about i'm so full of christ i just
[1:15:04] manifested no matter what
[1:15:09] but god has us here for a reason
[1:15:13] groaning and travailing in pain until
[1:15:15] now what's happening
[1:15:17] it's the unveiling of christ
[1:15:22] i can say for all of our lives
[1:15:27] there's more of the marble of the old
[1:15:30] nature
[1:15:32] than taken off of us
[1:15:36] we're a lot closer to manifesting christ
[1:15:38] the way he wants us to than we've ever
[1:15:40] been
[1:15:43] but we can't stop
[1:15:47] mike and joel didn't stop
[1:15:50] not until he saw perfection we need to
[1:15:53] go on to perfection
[1:15:55] let us go on to perfection let god
[1:15:58] continue to have his way
[1:16:00] don't question what god is speaking to
[1:16:02] you if it's the word just say amen
[1:16:04] and move forward
[1:16:17] even we ourselves are groaning within
[1:16:20] ourselves
[1:16:22] we are waiting for christ to be unveiled
[1:16:26] how many times you're talking to
[1:16:27] somebody and you said i just wish i
[1:16:30] they could see it
[1:16:39] well people believe more what they
[1:16:43] see manifested than what they hear
[1:16:46] spoken
[1:16:48] and the only way that you can manifest
[1:16:50] it is have something
[1:16:52] so contrary to what you believe that you
[1:16:54] stand as a shining light
[1:16:56] in the midst of that situation because
[1:16:59] of you saying what you believe and what
[1:17:00] you know
[1:17:01] that just doesn't mean anything it's
[1:17:03] manifesting time
[1:17:04] not knowledge time manifesting time
[1:17:08] this robe of flesh i'll drop and rise to
[1:17:12] seize the everlasting prize
[1:17:16] because we've been predestined to the
[1:17:18] statue of a perfect man
[1:17:19] everything in our carnal nature has to
[1:17:22] be
[1:17:22] stripped away
[1:17:26] you know the problem is brother marty i
[1:17:27] think so often we think
[1:17:30] well my carnal nature i got most of it
[1:17:33] out
[1:17:35] and what we do is we cease
[1:17:39] to get more like christ and then we
[1:17:42] substitute it with knowledge
[1:17:45] i'm gonna listen this tape and get
[1:17:46] knowledge it's gonna make me more like
[1:17:49] christ well just
[1:17:50] tell me is it making you more humble
[1:17:53] are you laying your life down more
[1:17:54] you're serving others are you still
[1:17:56] you're still selfish and spending all
[1:17:58] your time doing what you want to do
[1:18:01] after that tape
[1:18:06] you don't get rapturing faith by
[1:18:08] listening here
[1:18:09] and knowledge here you get faith to
[1:18:12] start living what you're hearing
[1:18:15] and it just keeps building until before
[1:18:17] you know it your faith becomes a
[1:18:20] perfect faith ready for rapture
[1:18:24] you fall so perfectly in love with god
[1:18:28] you just take him at his word
[1:18:32] we are not only predestined to be the
[1:18:35] bride of christ
[1:18:37] but we have been predestined to go
[1:18:38] through things that only the bride is
[1:18:40] ordained to go through
[1:18:44] the chipping away of the carnal nature
[1:18:48] many can't take it
[1:18:51] it's too hard
[1:18:55] they get their mind off of it they just
[1:18:58] go on to something different
[1:19:00] but god is here wanting to bring forth
[1:19:04] that image
[1:19:05] out of out of you with this great vision
[1:19:08] that he has
[1:19:10] it's not the preacher brawling us over
[1:19:12] the head
[1:19:14] making us feel like we're nothing
[1:19:21] no it's christ wanting to see himself in
[1:19:24] you
[1:19:34] i
[1:19:37] you've heard that
[1:19:40] honey attracts more bees
[1:19:48] so sister kathleen help me with that
[1:19:50] honey attracts more
[1:19:54] than vinegar very good very good and the
[1:19:56] point of that is is
[1:19:57] that you you want to uh embrace
[1:20:03] but but honestly
[1:20:07] the only way that you're going to get to
[1:20:08] the statue the image
[1:20:10] of moses is to chip away what isn't
[1:20:13] moses
[1:20:16] the only way you're going to get to the
[1:20:18] image of christ is to chip away
[1:20:20] what's not christ and it hurts though
[1:20:24] our
[1:20:24] outward man perished the inward man is
[1:20:27] renewed day by day
[1:20:30] we just can't get away we can't get away
[1:20:34] from it
[1:20:34] it's okay love the word great peace have
[1:20:38] they that love my law
[1:20:39] and nothing shall offend them
[1:20:45] every time you allow god to chip away at
[1:20:47] something in your life
[1:20:50] more of the image of christ is being
[1:20:53] unveiled
[1:20:54] think about that in other words
[1:20:57] embrace it embrace if you hear
[1:21:01] the preacher say we need to pray more
[1:21:04] embrace it amen let that
[1:21:08] carnal man die
[1:21:11] christ is going to shine
[1:21:14] if you hear the if you hear the word
[1:21:16] telling you
[1:21:18] don't just listen to a message and try
[1:21:20] to do two or three other things
[1:21:22] focus on what's being said then just do
[1:21:25] it just do it because he's trying to get
[1:21:27] something to you
[1:21:29] god says so many things in the course of
[1:21:31] a service he speaks to all of us
[1:21:33] differently takes the same word the same
[1:21:37] scripture
[1:21:38] and he speaks something personal to us
[1:21:40] because he knows where we're at
[1:21:42] amen
[1:21:47] i just want to say it's perfectly in
[1:21:49] order to come to church
[1:21:50] and feel the lord is chipping away at
[1:21:52] your carnal nature
[1:21:54] it's perfectly in order to feel that
[1:21:56] because that's exactly what he's doing
[1:21:59] can you imagine coming to church and
[1:22:01] hearing the message of needing to get
[1:22:03] baptized
[1:22:04] over and over and over
[1:22:10] you've already been baptized it just
[1:22:12] wouldn't make any sense would it
[1:22:16] i mean at first you'd feel pretty good
[1:22:18] oh yeah i've already been baptized i
[1:22:20] don't have to do that
[1:22:24] but after a while it's like
[1:22:27] hey do you know your congregation we've
[1:22:29] all been baptized here
[1:22:32] are you with me
[1:22:35] and there just wouldn't be a need for
[1:22:37] the message every time to come to church
[1:22:40] if all you're going to do is say
[1:22:43] you need to be baptized in the name of
[1:22:45] the lord jesus
[1:22:48] it's the same way with having to be
[1:22:50] reminded that you're the bride
[1:22:54] or that you've been predestinated
[1:22:57] you've already been told that over
[1:23:01] and over you've already accepted it
[1:23:04] you've already said amen
[1:23:06] to it so it just wouldn't make
[1:23:09] much sense to keep telling you that
[1:23:15] i'm going to bring a balance to all this
[1:23:16] so just bear with me
[1:23:19] if you keep feeling like you need to be
[1:23:21] baptized every time you come to church
[1:23:23] when you've already been baptized
[1:23:25] something is wrong
[1:23:27] somewhere
[1:23:31] and if you keep feeling like you need to
[1:23:33] be told that you're
[1:23:34] the elected you're the chosen you're
[1:23:37] predestined
[1:23:39] when you've already testified that god
[1:23:41] spoke it to you
[1:23:42] something is wrong somewhere
[1:23:50] i want to bring a balance to what i said
[1:23:55] we can't forget we will need
[1:23:59] our minds to be stirred up and
[1:24:01] stimulated
[1:24:02] we got the example of that in the
[1:24:04] scriptures
[1:24:06] there was a time that john the baptist's
[1:24:13] vision got clouded over and jesus said
[1:24:17] go tell him
[1:24:18] what's happening
[1:24:27] we can get overtaken in the cares of
[1:24:28] life things will happen to us and we
[1:24:31] will need
[1:24:31] to be stirred up in our minds but we
[1:24:34] won't need
[1:24:34] that every single week
[1:24:39] if so there's something wrong somewhere
[1:24:43] it's time to get a hold of the lord
[1:24:47] paul admonished us to keep moving
[1:24:50] forward
[1:24:52] hebrews chapter six my i don't know if
[1:24:54] we're going to be able to
[1:24:57] get through everything but you know that
[1:24:59] is
[1:25:00] definitely not the first time that's
[1:25:01] ever happened to us in our lives
[1:25:06] brother uh mark asked me today he said
[1:25:10] do you ever get through your notes
[1:25:13] i said well it's about 50 50. no i said
[1:25:15] it's about 40 60.
[1:25:17] i don't i don't usually get through them
[1:25:18] all all right hebrews chapter 6
[1:25:21] verse 1. therefore leaving the
[1:25:24] principles of the doctrine of christ
[1:25:26] let us go on onto perfection not laying
[1:25:29] again the foundation
[1:25:31] of repentance and dead works and faith
[1:25:33] toward god of that
[1:25:34] doctrine of baptism and laying on the
[1:25:36] hands of the resurrection of the dead
[1:25:38] and the eternal judgment and this we
[1:25:40] will do if god repents
[1:25:44] permits so there is times that we need
[1:25:47] to be
[1:25:48] stirred reminded but we come to church
[1:25:52] to go forward
[1:25:54] if we
[1:25:57] are keep having problems and we're
[1:26:00] having a hard time going forward because
[1:26:02] we need to hear
[1:26:03] we need our faith to be stirred we need
[1:26:06] to be reminded that we're proud that
[1:26:07] we're predestinated
[1:26:09] we need to look at what's happening in
[1:26:10] the process when we're not at church
[1:26:14] i'll say it again it's the god's truth
[1:26:17] we need to come
[1:26:18] with a mindset of moving forward
[1:26:22] that's what the scripture says it's in
[1:26:23] this age we can't be waiting around
[1:26:26] i'll tell you i don't got a calendar
[1:26:29] and i cannot tell you what day the
[1:26:31] rapture is going to happen but as
[1:26:33] sure as anything it's already set
[1:26:36] it is already set it does not keep
[1:26:39] moving out
[1:26:42] in our mind it does just like our age
[1:26:47] tell me when you wake up and all day
[1:26:49] long and all you want to say
[1:26:50] is i'm old i'm old i'm old i'm going to
[1:26:52] die die die no
[1:26:57] you don't when my dad was 35 he was an
[1:27:01] old man
[1:27:03] forty-five fifty and then i become
[1:27:05] thirty-five four
[1:27:07] yeah who wants to say i'm an old man
[1:27:12] we want we will put that date up but god
[1:27:15] is not putting the rapture data waiting
[1:27:17] for you he's not delaying his coming
[1:27:20] we need to set this this thing's real
[1:27:22] it's going to happen i need to get
[1:27:24] serious about the word
[1:27:25] i need to go on what things are my life
[1:27:27] you got to chip off lord
[1:27:34] for it is impossible for those who once
[1:27:38] enlightened and have tasted of the
[1:27:40] heavenly gift and were
[1:27:41] i'm sorry if you want to put this up
[1:27:43] there's this is hebrews chapter six
[1:27:48] verse four tastes of the heavenly gift
[1:27:50] and were made partakers of the holy
[1:27:52] ghost and have
[1:27:53] tasted the good word of god and the
[1:27:55] powers of the world to come if they
[1:27:57] shall
[1:27:57] fall away to renew again unto them
[1:27:59] repentance seeing they have crucified to
[1:28:01] themselves the son of god afresh and put
[1:28:03] him to an open chain for the urge with
[1:28:06] drinketh
[1:28:07] in the rain that cometh often upon it
[1:28:09] bring forth herbs meat
[1:28:11] for them by whom it is dress receiving
[1:28:14] blessing
[1:28:14] from god but that which beareth thorns
[1:28:17] and briars is rejected is not into
[1:28:19] cursing
[1:28:20] whose end is to be burned but beloved
[1:28:24] we are persuaded something
[1:28:27] better of you now what church do you
[1:28:30] want to be in
[1:28:33] do you want to be in the church that
[1:28:35] nothing more is
[1:28:37] is expected of you
[1:28:44] i mean it would be easier in our flesh
[1:28:50] it's easier to go to church when the old
[1:28:53] man
[1:28:54] is not suffering that's really good
[1:28:59] but god your husband is looking at you
[1:29:03] and saying there's greater things per
[1:29:06] he's persuaded greater things out of you
[1:29:10] the things that accompany the image of
[1:29:11] christ the manifestation
[1:29:13] of christ
[1:29:19] for god is not unrighteous to forget
[1:29:21] your work and labor of love
[1:29:23] which you have shown toward his name in
[1:29:25] that he administered to the saints and
[1:29:27] do minister
[1:29:28] and we desire that every one of you in
[1:29:30] this church
[1:29:31] show the same diligence to the full
[1:29:33] assurance of hope
[1:29:34] until the end now what about everybody
[1:29:37] that left
[1:29:40] what about everybody who is not pressing
[1:29:42] in today
[1:29:46] i understand there's a lot of stuff
[1:29:50] but we've got the word our husband is
[1:29:53] telling us what to do
[1:29:54] hold that same confidence till we're out
[1:29:57] of here
[1:29:58] amen can you say amen to the word that
[1:30:01] ye be not slothful
[1:30:07] not me brother john not me i'm building
[1:30:09] three houses
[1:30:12] that's not the salt it's talking about
[1:30:17] but followers of them who through
[1:30:20] faith and patience inherit
[1:30:23] the promises amen
[1:30:27] every promise in the book is mine amen
[1:30:30] praise the lord
[1:30:34] how many loves the word
[1:30:37] let's go on to perfection what is that
[1:30:39] the image of christ
[1:30:40] pressing towards that mark for the prize
[1:30:42] of the high calling
[1:30:43] it's the unveiling of christ in you
[1:30:48] we don't want to put peacock feathers on
[1:30:50] and try to do this and try to do that
[1:30:52] try to be this that and the other
[1:30:56] it's not real it just takes a little bit
[1:30:58] of test you'll fly off the handle
[1:31:02] but you just say lord share on my right
[1:31:04] so i share that nature away
[1:31:06] i just want you to shine forth amen
[1:31:11] amen amen
[1:31:14] god had a vision for us
[1:31:18] that vision is the same vision that he
[1:31:20] had
[1:31:21] in the garden when he said let us make
[1:31:23] man in our image
[1:31:26] he had the image and he made it perfect
[1:31:31] adam was perfect yes
[1:31:35] today he has the same image adam is our
[1:31:38] brother
[1:31:40] not our flash no talk about the inward
[1:31:43] man
[1:31:45] he has that same image of us that he did
[1:31:48] of
[1:31:48] of adam we've got to allow
[1:31:52] this carnal nature to be carved away
[1:31:56] whatever he speaks that's him carving
[1:31:58] he's a
[1:31:59] a discerner of the thoughts and tense
[1:32:01] and art he takes that
[1:32:02] knife of the word he says get this out
[1:32:04] of your life i'm speaking to you today
[1:32:06] go home and sh
[1:32:08] carve it out and you just got to believe
[1:32:11] that's christ speaking to you and not
[1:32:13] john martin's idea or some brother bruce
[1:32:16] or
[1:32:16] some minister
[1:32:19] it's got to be personal
[1:32:24] jeremiah says i know the thoughts i
[1:32:26] think towards you saith the lord
[1:32:29] he wants to give us an expected end
[1:32:33] he doesn't want us coming into church
[1:32:35] we're the only 15
[1:32:36] coming into church that's
[1:32:40] not quite in his image or coming into
[1:32:42] heaven not quite in his image
[1:32:48] amen no his vision for you is to be
[1:32:51] without spot
[1:32:52] without wrinkle
[1:32:56] you're the bride you are making
[1:32:59] yourselves ready let's
[1:33:01] rejoice and be glad
[1:33:04] for his wife have made herself ready
[1:33:07] she had this hope she purified herself
[1:33:10] by
[1:33:10] knocking off this old nature even as she
[1:33:13] already was pure
[1:33:14] she's still knocking off the other stuff
[1:33:20] being confident of this very thing he
[1:33:21] which had begun a good work in you he's
[1:33:23] going to perform it
[1:33:24] amen for we are made partakers of christ
[1:33:29] if we hold the beginning
[1:33:31] of our confidence steadfast to the end
[1:33:38] let him chip away
[1:33:42] don't get offended don't get bothered
[1:33:47] don't say that don't encourage me
[1:33:51] we don't have time but i'd like you to
[1:33:53] read hebrews chapter
[1:33:55] 12 you'll see
[1:33:59] that every son and daughter of god
[1:34:03] as many as i love i rebuke chasing
[1:34:06] he doesn't want us to be weary and faint
[1:34:07] in our minds and get offended because
[1:34:10] we think this is something personal and
[1:34:11] directed and this is the do's and don'ts
[1:34:14] of a church and it's just religion and
[1:34:15] it's not god and
[1:34:16] god has set me free you gotta get away
[1:34:19] from that garbage
[1:34:22] satan will plant his his theology inside
[1:34:25] of you to keep you away from living this
[1:34:26] word and dine out to the flesh
[1:34:32] let them carve away the world the
[1:34:34] worldly nature
[1:34:37] that nothing's left don't you when
[1:34:39] people see you
[1:34:41] um don't when people see you don't you
[1:34:43] want them saying
[1:34:45] i i really see christ in you
[1:34:50] not whoa
[1:34:55] not the mood to talk to him
[1:34:59] i better wait
[1:35:03] that thing's got to get carved off
[1:35:06] we could go the rest of our life and say
[1:35:08] we're human it's always going to be
[1:35:09] there
[1:35:11] and say amen to that and feel just as
[1:35:12] good and don't have to worry about going
[1:35:14] home and doing any better
[1:35:16] that's right there's truth that we will
[1:35:18] have this cockabur nature
[1:35:20] but where's our attitude about it do you
[1:35:23] got faith
[1:35:24] to have the image of christ shining
[1:35:26] forth more
[1:35:28] be it unto you according to your faith
[1:35:31] that's why i'm saying if the 15 people
[1:35:34] next to me don't want to believe
[1:35:36] for their life as as much as i do i'm
[1:35:38] not going to let them stand in my way
[1:35:40] then brother branham said if if i can't
[1:35:42] uh
[1:35:43] when i pray for this man if i can't do
[1:35:45] anything i'm not going to stand in the
[1:35:46] way of somebody's got faith
[1:35:48] to do something to pray and believe
[1:35:51] this is an individual work a work
[1:35:56] god deals with us as individuals yes
[1:35:58] we're we're a body
[1:36:00] but not everybody in the body is saying
[1:36:02] lord have thy no way
[1:36:03] amen they all might be saying lord have
[1:36:06] thou
[1:36:06] wait to this point to this point
[1:36:10] to this room in my heart to this room in
[1:36:11] my heart
[1:36:15] that's why it needs to become more real
[1:36:18] to us
[1:36:18] personally getting ready to close
[1:36:24] in just another hour or two
[1:36:27] lord help me the unveiling of christ
[1:36:30] in our lives it's it's very similar
[1:36:33] to the things that we deal with in
[1:36:36] society and you take any sports team
[1:36:41] when they go to draft somebody they
[1:36:44] really don't know what they're getting
[1:36:46] they do not draft somebody just
[1:36:49] haphazard oh yeah whoever whatever come
[1:36:51] on
[1:36:52] give me a chance they go and they
[1:36:55] uh they got scouts and they they they
[1:36:58] look at
[1:36:58] how they handle themselves at the age
[1:37:01] that they're at
[1:37:02] and they give their their opinion on
[1:37:05] whether this would be a good candidate
[1:37:06] for their team
[1:37:09] and so they'll draft them
[1:37:12] but just because they got drafted to
[1:37:14] some professional team
[1:37:16] it doesn't mean they're going to play
[1:37:18] professional
[1:37:20] in fact the majority of the people that
[1:37:22] get drafted never
[1:37:24] make it to the teams
[1:37:28] and the ones that do make it well
[1:37:31] there's a lot of them are still
[1:37:32] borderline
[1:37:35] after a couple years they ain't
[1:37:39] towing the rope they trade them
[1:37:42] put them on waivers get rid of them
[1:37:47] it takes time to unveil who they are
[1:37:51] everybody is not a bradley
[1:37:55] what's the quarterback tom brady
[1:37:58] everybody's not a tom brady
[1:38:00] i should know tom brady
[1:38:08] everybody know that suit from the wings
[1:38:12] most everybody he was a very talented
[1:38:14] player
[1:38:17] he was known for going to the game
[1:38:20] for the mission to just watch him at how
[1:38:24] good he was
[1:38:28] well he was drafted in the 200s
[1:38:34] nobody knew he would be unveiled to be
[1:38:37] this great
[1:38:38] one of the greatest players talented
[1:38:44] we don't know
[1:38:48] this is the time to unveil what's inside
[1:38:51] you it's
[1:38:52] manifesting time amen
[1:38:56] those players can't go to the team and
[1:38:58] say coach look i'm just as good as
[1:39:00] anybody else on this team
[1:39:01] that don't work words are words
[1:39:06] put them through the test see if they
[1:39:08] can do it god is putting us through the
[1:39:10] test to see
[1:39:11] if we're going to manifest him or we're
[1:39:13] going to manifest you talk to me that
[1:39:15] way i'm not going to
[1:39:16] talk to you anymore i'm not going to
[1:39:17] shake hands with you
[1:39:22] i'm going to be christians who i want to
[1:39:23] be and not to you because i don't think
[1:39:24] you're one
[1:39:28] the carnality that comes out of what we
[1:39:30] think is
[1:39:32] christian it's manifesting time
[1:39:40] have you ever heard these words if i
[1:39:43] knew the way that you were i would have
[1:39:44] never married you
[1:39:51] brother john that's a sticky subject
[1:39:55] it's so sticky that we don't want to
[1:39:58] talk about the truth
[1:40:02] well it was different words that i heard
[1:40:06] john
[1:40:09] in other words love is blind but
[1:40:13] marriage is an eye-opener
[1:40:18] it's manifesting what's really an inside
[1:40:24] society it's it's manifested the devil
[1:40:27] hell is
[1:40:28] uh opened up enlarged and and
[1:40:32] the world is manifesting more and more
[1:40:35] evil
[1:40:36] the bride should be manifesting more and
[1:40:39] more the love of god
[1:40:43] not just saying well not part of that no
[1:40:46] manifest a greater love not what you had
[1:40:50] 10 years ago
[1:40:53] more times been given more is expected
[1:40:56] too much is given much is required
[1:41:01] it's an opportunity for us to be christ
[1:41:04] to a dying world
[1:41:06] god's got a vision for you
[1:41:10] he's waited a long time for this fruit
[1:41:14] to come forth
[1:41:16] amen let's stand together
[1:41:23] the rest of my sermon is going to be you
[1:41:25] standing
[1:41:27] we all have heard the scripture god
[1:41:29] knoweth
[1:41:30] them that are his
[1:41:36] he knows those that are his but what
[1:41:39] does he tell them
[1:41:40] that are his he's not telling the world
[1:41:42] this now but what is he telling
[1:41:44] those that are his he's telling them
[1:41:49] to depart from iniquity
[1:41:54] nevertheless the foundation of god says
[1:41:56] you're having this healed the lord
[1:41:57] knoweth them that are his and let
[1:41:58] everyone that nameth
[1:42:00] the name of christ depart from the
[1:42:02] nickname so what is he saying
[1:42:04] shave off those things that you know
[1:42:07] that need to get away amen and unveil
[1:42:10] who you are because you belong to christ
[1:42:19] what's not him we don't gotta
[1:42:22] try to figure things out more and have
[1:42:25] more mysteries and
[1:42:26] have go down this trail on that trail
[1:42:29] have been able to figure things out no
[1:42:32] let go of everything that's not him
[1:42:38] it's okay to be weak paul said
[1:42:42] god told paul when my my strength is
[1:42:45] made perfect in weakness
[1:42:47] he said i will gladly therefore glory
[1:42:50] in my infirmities this outward man
[1:42:53] perish

[1:42:56] know christ is gonna shine forth
