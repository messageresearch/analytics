========================================
Only believe all things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. [Music] All things are possible. Only believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. [Music] All things are possible. For I believe I believe I believe. All things are possible. [Music] the power for all things, right? &gt;&gt; We in ourselves don't have the the power to do it. We just have the ability to believe &gt;&gt; and God has the the power to do it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's good to be with you this morning. I want to say thank you from the family for praying uh for Cheryl's dad, Harry. Um they were able to take out a part of his colon and they feel they got all of it and it looked like a very good success in the the surgery. they won't have the the results of the test for a few more days, but I want to say thank you &gt;&gt; for praying and your continued prayers. We had a chance to pray with him and he's testifying, you know, that God was with him. So, we are grateful for that and want to also congratulate brother and sister Bman. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's beautiful, beautiful testimony. Bill, before we look to the word, let's just bow our hearts in a word of prayer. Dear heavenly father, thank you that you have placed a desire in each of our hearts today to be in your house. Lord, there are others who you have called that could be here this morning but have chosen not to be. So Lord, we count it a privilege that the desire you placed inside of us is so strong that we couldn't wait till the doors were open today. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you for that. Thank you for the Holy Spirit that resides inside of us. And this morning, Lord, we're we're looking to you, Lord. Father, we are incapable in ourselves to to really do anything that would help feed your bride. But the great Holy Spirit is the only one that can feed us. And we pray that you would come in a way this this day uh Lord in a personal way to every one of our hearts that we could recognize that it is you speaking Lord and that we uh would would find it easy to accept your word into our hearts this morning that we could leave here uh more equipped to face the enemy when we leave. Bless each and everyone. Lord, you see the needs that would be represented in our lives. The perhaps questions and on hearts, directions that would be needed, healings for the bodies, those that are hungering uh for more of the Holy Ghost, those that are desperate for deliverance, those that are wanting just to get ready for the hour that we know not when you would return. God, may you come in a supernatural way today and may all of our hearts be able to look to the unseen God in our midst. Oh Lord, that you might have your way. Thank you, Lord, for this grace as we commit the service in your hands. Pray that you bless the reading of the word and the preaching of the word and the hearing thereof. God, we give you praise and honor for these things. We pray in Jesus precious name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to the book of 1st Samuel chapter 30 for our opening scripture. 1st Samuel chapter 30. And in this uh set of scriptures, David is just getting back. He was actually uh was going to be in a place that he would be fighting against Israel. And God uh didn't wouldn't allow that to happen. And here he comes back to the city where his family was in the family of all the soldiers. And starting here in verse number one of 1st Samuel chapter 30. And it came to pass when David and his men were come to Ziglaggle on the third day that the Amlikites had invaded the south and Zigleg and smitten Zigleg and burned it with fire and had taken the women captives that there that were therein. Uh they slew not any, either great or small, but carried them away and went on their way. So David and his men came to the city, and behold, it was burned with fire, and their wives and their sons and their daughters were taken captive. Then David and the people that were with him lifted up their voice and wept until they had no more power to weep. Just imagine if that had happened to you. And David's two wives were taken captives. Ahonium the Jezeritis and Abigail the wife of Nabbo the Carmelite. And David was greatly distressed for the people spoke of stoning him because the soul of all the people was grieved. every man for his sons and his daughters. But David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. You know, David was a man that wasn't always he was pretty he was solid. I could say that. There was a time that they they said uh Saul had killed his thousand, but David his 10,000. &gt;&gt; But that didn't lift up David. That didn't make him feel like a big head. And he was just steady. And we can see here that at his highest highs or as low as low, he didn't let things get to him. And here he's at a spot that there was his wives are gone, his family's gone, the the city is burnt. His own men are are are wanting to stone him, get rid of him, get get another leader in here. And but he stood solid. The solid rock he stood and he encouraged himself in the Lord. This morning we want to entitle this message the power of encouragement and and take uh for a a subject encouraging ourselves in the Lord. &gt;&gt; Has anybody ever been discouraged before? &gt;&gt; Well, this message is for you then. &gt;&gt; This message is for you. Discouragement, the dictionary says, is a loss of confidence or enthusiasm. It can also be the feeling of being less confident or less hopeful. The Bible says that we're not ignorant of the devil's devices, but often times people become ignorant of discouragement. What I mean by this is that discouragement seems to be a large part of people's lives, but they ignore how dangerous it is to be in a state of discouragement. Discouragement is the devil's workshop in which he can craft up anything to happen once you get discouraged. Discouragement distracts and hinders individuals and leads them away from positive actions and a a spiritual growth that happen. So as soon as he gets you in that place of discouragement, you you you've you're disfused. There's no armor. There's no strength. There's no power because you've been discouraged. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, the devil's motive for wanting to get us discouraged is to try to get us away from that place of I'm going to press in &gt;&gt; to like I'm just going to like hang out here and see if somebody will encourage me. &gt;&gt; People who are discouraged are are more susceptible to negative influences. &gt;&gt; Things like gossip and not caring and bad attitudes. Not necessary to go to church or or to pray through or to listen to a message. A a message all negative influences because of discouragement. People who are discouraged are less likely to pursue good and and productive endeavors. They take their foot off the gas. They stop building spiritually. But in all honesty, discouragement is all around us. And life is full of disappointments. Things trying to swallow up our expectations. There's always another issue to deal with. I haven't even got to put a stone on the greenhouse this year because of everything else that came up. And my plan was to to get it done this year. Well, it's not even going to happen. I haven't even started. Another issue to deal with, another unexpected problem, another a bad attitude to deal with, another bill in the mail, more sickness, uh more rebellion to deal with, another restless night. &gt;&gt; And when it comes down to it, often times we feel like no one seems to care when we're discouraged. &gt;&gt; Coming to church doesn't necessarily bring encouragement. Coming to church doesn't necessarily bring encouragement. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says we either leave church closer to God or further away. &gt;&gt; And leaving church further away isn't encouraging. &gt;&gt; See, it's our attitude about the word that makes the difference. When we positively look to the word of God for our lives personally, then it will encourage us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Great peace have they that love thy law, and nothing shall offend them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon says, "If you come to church to find fault, there's plenty enough to see." &gt;&gt; There's plenty enough to see. &gt;&gt; Amen. Unquestionably, everyone welcomes encouragement into their lives. Everyone wants to be encouraged. And often times, we expect others to encourage us, &gt;&gt; especially when we're down. It's just that, you know, that entitlement, you know, you're doing better than me. It's your job to encourage me. &gt;&gt; But in reality, we hold the power of encouragement right inside of us. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I want to say a statement. I hope it sticks with you forever. &gt;&gt; Never place your power into the hands of another person to encourage you. &gt;&gt; Never do that. &gt;&gt; You'll sorely be disappointed. &gt;&gt; God will allow you to be placed in positions that will force you not to rely on other people's encouragement. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just so you learn to lean and trust in the Lord &gt;&gt; so he can teach you to grow up. &gt;&gt; Just to teach us to encourage ourselves in the Lord. God wants us to learn to encourage ourselves in the Lord &gt;&gt; to cast to really be able to to cast our cares upon him for he cares for us &gt;&gt; to to to come to grips that it's not the situation that needs to be right. But he is our peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is our hope. He is a present help in a time of need. He wants us to rely on his promises. And and so we got to remember his promises and rely on them. &gt;&gt; So God wants us, this is an important important an important word here. God wants us to safeguard against discouragement. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because once you get discouraged, you you you you don't have any power to overcome the devil. &gt;&gt; That's right. So I would say if we would stand if we would recognize when discouragement is trying to come against us and safeguard against that then we won't we won't uh be left without any armor without any uh any strength to do the right thing &gt;&gt; because once discouragement happens we just kind of throw our hands up and we don't feel to care. It's almost as important to to safeguard. We'll see in the scriptures here coming up to safeguard against discouragement. &gt;&gt; And I'll say the important to remember this. If we don't safeguard against and we get discouraged, God is not going to pick us up every time we get in the dumps. &gt;&gt; Every time we get discouraged, God is not going to come and pick us up. Yeah. I'm going to say it again. Don't expect God to come every time we get in the dumps and get lazy and get discouraged to pick us up. He's not going to. That is not the nature of God. &gt;&gt; God wants us to grow up into all things. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Unto a perfect man, the measure of the statue of Christ, that we be henceforth no more children tossed to and fro. God wants us to grow up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we must learn to safeguard ourselves from discouragement. &gt;&gt; Amen. and learn to encourage our own selves in the Lord. &gt;&gt; It's not everybody else's job to keep us pumped up, &gt;&gt; encouraged or enthused. It's not the song leader's job to make you feel like you you should worship. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. It's not. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is your relationship with God before you come through those doors. &gt;&gt; That's your attitude. Come on. &gt;&gt; If you got a if you got a you you're expecting something better to be happening up here to help you. I'm telling you, it's all emotion and it's not the reality of God in your life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has placed the power inside of us. &gt;&gt; We must learn to encourage oursel and I'll say it like this. In the midst of an of adversity, &gt;&gt; in the midst of advers just like just like David, the children of Israel could not keep uh could not keep themselves encouraged along their journey to the promised land. They they murmured, &gt;&gt; they complained, they fussed, they stewed, they whined, they taught behind Moses's back. The Bible says that God was grieved with them. &gt;&gt; He also said they did not know me. &gt;&gt; They Can you imagine walking 40 years in the message of the hour and not knowing God? &gt;&gt; They seen the miracles. Their shoes didn't wear out. They had a great blue cross plan, &gt;&gt; but they did not know God. That was his testimony of them. They never became partakers of the promise of Christ because why? They didn't hold the beginning of their confidence steadfast to the end. &gt;&gt; Wow. &gt;&gt; The expectation that God has of a Christian who says, "I'm going to get baptized. I'm going to start serving God." &gt;&gt; He expects them to be on fire all the way through. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To keep going. They came up to the promised land and God told Moses to send gall men to spy out the land. And Joshua and Caleb were were two of the 12 spies. And all 12 spies, did you know they agreed with part of the message? They did. They had all agreed in part of the message. But it was the easy part of the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Surely the promise of God flowth with milk and honey, and this is the fruit of it. We brought forth the fruit. It is just like, you know, everybody just love the the healings and the discernment and um uh God that that there's against denominations, the easy part. But 10 of the 12 spies recanted part of the message and they gave an evil report. The Bible says they recanted. What was that evil report? Anybody know? If I could say it like this to bring it home to us, it was not continuing to grow in all things that Christ had given them. &gt;&gt; Because when they were in Egypt, God gave them the promised land. And they went right up to it and said, "I don't have confidence to go get the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; I don't have confidence to come into the image of Christ. I don't have confidence to be just like him. In other words, my life, I'm going to say over here, I'm predestinated, but my life is not going to be working towards what I'm predestinated to. That was the evil report. &gt;&gt; They chose to stop moving forward. They they refused to stop pressing in. And it is it's evil to stop moving forward into the character of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's evil to stop adding uh virtues to your life. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 3:12 says, "Take heed, brethren, lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the living God." &gt;&gt; Now, notice this is he's referring to the children of Israel. They their attitude was, "Well, I'm not leaving God. I'm just going to serve them outside of the Holy Ghost. I'm going to serve them outside of the promised land." And a lot of times Christians are very content serving God without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Very content. &gt;&gt; That is just the devil. &gt;&gt; We need to go on and get the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; because if we're don't, it's evil and we're under the influence of a wrong spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now this departing is the departing from overcoming all things. This departing from the living God is departing from overcoming all things. In other words, I can overcome some things. That should be good enough. No, God wants you to overcome all things. The promise is to him that overcometh all things. &gt;&gt; He's the one that's going to sit with me on the throne as I've sat with my father on the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's departing from losing the interest from pressing into the image of Christ from laying aside all things until we can love with perfect love as the prophet said. God caused us an evil heart of unbelief. Well, like how many times have we focused on having perfect love in the last week? Have we? It should be something that should be first going on in our lives &gt;&gt; because it's brother Brandham said that's that's that's all that was there. You couldn't even enter in without it. He comes back with his report from spying over the land and he says, "Whatever you do, lay aside, well, lay aside whatever you got going on and whatever your ideas and whatever your plans are, whatever you want to do this year and wherever you want to go, lay it aside until you get perfect. Let that be your goal, your motive, &gt;&gt; because you may not live to do what you want to do, &gt;&gt; but exhort one another daily." Verse 13. While it is called day, exhort one another. Stay with it. Come on, let's go. We got to become more like Christ. &gt;&gt; Exhort one another daily. While it is called today, lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin. You ever get a hard heart? That's because of your unbelief. &gt;&gt; That's where it comes. For we are made partakers of Christ, not if we repent and get baptized, if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end, not just after the beginning. &gt;&gt; So what is God's vision for you? That's important to know that. Yeah. &gt;&gt; If it's just to come to church and kind of satisfy your church attendance, not going to make it. Joshua and Caleb were the only two preachers who believed the message right to the end. &gt;&gt; They believed the whole message. The rest of them only believed a portion of the message. And this is why it's important to not get caught up in saying, "Well, I believe in the message." and you kind of cherrypick what you like &gt;&gt; because the whole heart of the message is that Christ is going to be manifested in your life. If the message doesn't bring that to you, you missed the message. &gt;&gt; You missed it. &gt;&gt; In the midst of church adversity, those two encouraged themselves in the Lord. &gt;&gt; 1.8 million murmurss and complaints. Can you imagine going to church with them? Can you imagine living with a murmur and complainer? Going to church with them, having to sit there and who's turn to preach? And they weren't uh they weren't preaching the whole word. &gt;&gt; You know, Brother Brham says if you can't uh if you can't find a whole loaf, you should at least be eating a a piece, right? A slice of bread. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine for 40 years everybody you talk to negative? This was in church. &gt;&gt; This is church adversity. &gt;&gt; But they were special, these two men. In the midst of church adversity, they encouraged themselves in the Lord. They were enthusiastic. Their attitude was, "Well, the bigger the giants are, the harder they're going to fall." &gt;&gt; They were not dismayed. They were full of confidence. They were full of faith. They were full of trust. &gt;&gt; They didn't allow the people they were rubbing shoulders with to influence what was in the inside of them. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Numbers 13:3 says, "And Caleb stilled the people before Moses and said, "Let us go up at once and possess it, for we are well able to overcome." And I'm telling you, when things just start to get hairy, wherever you're at in your homes or whatever is going on, the best thing to do is still the people, still the still the children, still the husband, still the wife, still the church, still the atmosphere. Quiet it down. &gt;&gt; Don't let the devil just go rampid. &gt;&gt; Get things still and then give the message. Let us go. Let's serve God with all of our heart. &gt;&gt; Let's put God first, not second, not starting tomorrow. Now, today is the day. &gt;&gt; They kept themselves encouraged. They kept a right mental attitude. They didn't allow fear to get them down. They safeguarded themselves from a wrong attitude. Do you know it's easy to get a wrong attitude when things don't go your way? I mean, it's easy to wake up on the wrong side of the bed. &gt;&gt; Numbers chapter 14 verse 22. Because all those men which seen my glory and my miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these 10 times and have not hearkened to my voice. Can you imagine? Surely they shall not see the land which I swear to unto their fathers, neither shall any of them that provoke me see it. Now you got to understand this is really referring to not seeing the power of the Holy Ghost in your life. &gt;&gt; That's what this is referring to. Because if if we we're going to murmur and complain about all of our trials, all of our tests, we're not getting what we want, we're not willing to take the word, God just says, "Okay, you're not going to see the promised land." Because the promised land is the Holy Ghost living inside you &gt;&gt; to the point to the point that it's not you anymore, but it's him, &gt;&gt; right? And you've got love, you've got joy, you've got peace. You do not live for yourselves anymore because you've been set free of yourself. You're living for others. You're not selfish. You're selfless. &gt;&gt; Verse 24. But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, what was that spirit? That spirit is described right here. And have fully follow followed me fully and have followed me completely. &gt;&gt; See, most Christians will follow God to a point. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'll do it to hear, but that's it. &gt;&gt; But the spirit of God says yes to every word of God. &gt;&gt; It will live by every word of God. &gt;&gt; It'll it'll overcome by the word of God. &gt;&gt; We don't leave out one part because we're leaving our our part out of the book of life. We we need the whole word of God. And we need to start not just if I could say it like this, we can agree with that, but is our life living that? Are we are we taking the gra in the word into our lives and say, I'm going to go to church. I'm going to hear the word of God and Lord, my heart is to start living it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To start implementing it. Because if you don't practice this habit, how in the world are you fully going to follow the Lord? &gt;&gt; So, it's not agreeing with it. You you've got to possess it. Joshua and Caleb had another spirit. They have fully followed me. Him will I bring into the land wherein he went and his seed shall possess it. God said he'd give the Holy Ghost to them that obey him. &gt;&gt; Fully follow him. So right now we're we're like on a here we it it isn't how long you've been coming to church gives you the Holy Ghost. These men followed the pillar of fire for 40 years, day and night, followed the Lord, could testify their God was the only God their shoes didn't wear out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the only God that could heal, they could testify to all the other nations, all the other denominations. But that's not good enough. Because at the end, if we don't come into the image of Christ, we're not going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; You could sit and you could pound and you could you could fight yourself, fight anybody to death saying that this message is true, but if this message isn't living inside you, you're not going in a rapture. &gt;&gt; The word has to be manifested. Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb had another spirit. It was a right spirit. I'll say it like this. Make sure you got a right spirit &gt;&gt; inside of you. That spirit that they had was God's spirit. It was a spirit of confidence, a spirit of trust and power. For God has not given us the spirit of fear, but of power and love and of a sound mind. Their spirit didn't lean to their own understanding, but they acknowledged the Lord in the situation and they and God directed them, "Move forward. We're more than able to take the land." &gt;&gt; They didn't look at the giants. They looked at God's word that said, "It is yours and they just followed fully." &gt;&gt; Look, you their own understanding couldn't understand it. Well, you know, why should I go on the altar and get serious with God? Nothing's going to change. Lean to your own understanding. It'll take you further away from God. &gt;&gt; God deals with our hearts. &gt;&gt; He's trying to change our desires. &gt;&gt; Verse 25. Now the Amalites and Canaanites dwelt in the valley. Tomorrow uh turn you and get into the wilderness by the Red Sea. And the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron, saying, "How long shall I bear with this evil congregation?" This was his people that he caught out of Egypt. And now he calls them an evil congregation. Which murmur against me. I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel. Remember, first he heard the cry of his people in Egypt and he came down to deliver them. He delivers them. And now he's hearing the murmuring &gt;&gt; murmurings which they murmur against me. Say unto them, "As truly as I live, sayeth the Lord, as ye have spoken in my ears, so I will do to you." Oh my my. I'll say this. God hears when you murmur and complain. &gt;&gt; You may not do it in church. You may do it on the phone. You may do it in the text. You may do it somewhere else. But God hears it. And I'll say it like this. It's coming back to you. It's right here. You're going to see it right here. He says, "So I will do to you. Your carcasses shall fell in the wilderness, and all that were numbered of you according to the whole number from 20 years old and upwards, which have murmured against me." Doubtless. Just think about this. Don't you think all those parents, all those people above 20 years old, don't you think that they influence the children? &gt;&gt; They influence the children. &gt;&gt; God hated that. God hates when we influence the children with negativity. your carcasses um okay from 20 years old upward and that which have murmured against me. Doubtless ye shall not come into the land cons concerning which I swear to make you dwell there save Caleb the son of Junapath and Joshua the son of Nun but your little ones this is powerful right here which you said should be a prey them what I bring in bring in and they shall know the land which ye have despised. Think about the times that you told your children that it wasn't that necessary to do what was asked for them to do in church &gt;&gt; or what the prophet said to do or it wasn't that necessary to go to church or wasn't that necessary to go to Sunday school or wasn't that necessary to be respectful or wasn't that necess it it. We're not up here making our own rules. &gt;&gt; We've been taught. We've been taught by the seventh days messenger. I'll stay with that more than I'll stay with any other man. &gt;&gt; We just got to have a heart. We got to have a revelation of what's happening in this hour. &gt;&gt; Joshua and Caleb knew how to encourage themselves in the Lord in the midst of adversity because nobody was there patting them on the back. They stood alone. The Bible tells us in Peter that whom speaking of the devil whom we resist steadfast in the faith knowing that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the world. We all are facing adversity. All of us are. We have to learn to take charge and keep ourselves encouraged. Amen. Well, you know what? I want you uh we we if we don't face discouragement with the right spirit, then we constantly have to be babyed by other people to stay encouraged. And I'm sorry, this message is not for you. This this message is for the overcomer. That's what this message is for. &gt;&gt; Joshua chapter 1 verse one. Now after the death of Moses, now this is about 39 40 years later after what we just read. Now after the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, it came to pass that the Lord spake unto Joshua the son of Nun, Moses's minister, saying, Moses, my servant, is dead. Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou and all this people unto the land which I do give them, even to the children of Israel, and every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon. Uh that I've given you as I said to Moses and from the describes the the the geological territory there. Uh but you know, we got uh love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness. That's our territory. There shall not be any man that shall be able to stand before thee all the days of your life. As I was with Moses, so I will be with thee, and I will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. Now, that sounds pretty cut and dry. &gt;&gt; I I'll take that right there. &gt;&gt; But there's something more that's needed. Be strong and be of good courage. For unto this people shalt thou divide for an inheritance in the land which I swear unto their fathers to give them. Now this is 3940 years later. Joshua and Caleb had another spirit and their spirit is were more than able to take the land. And now God is coming and it almost sounds like he's commanding be courageous. be. &gt;&gt; It's a commandment. Be. You need to be this way. You can't rely just on doesn't matter what your attitude is. I'm still taking you over. &gt;&gt; No. Because you got adversity coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil don't want you to get the Holy Ghost. The devil wants you just to relax. You can't wait till church is out. Get get what you got going on the rest of the day. You know, get caught up on things. Boy, I feel like preaching right now. &gt;&gt; God is actually commanding us to be strong and to be courageous. &gt;&gt; Not some laxidasical encouragement, but a commandment. &gt;&gt; We look at that. He was God was just trying to laxidasical encouraging. And that is not what was happening. If not, Joshua could have got weak in his mind and begin to faint. There was a reason that God said, "Be strong. Be courageous." And I'll say this, it is our job to stay encouraged in the Lord. Do not expect the preacher to do it. Don't expect your friend to do it. &gt;&gt; You know, we get real carnal. I'm going to call so and so. I'll tell you what you need to do is call on God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Call on God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Wait on the Lord. He'll renew your strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse seven says the very same thing in verse six. Only be thou strong and very courageous. To do what? That thou mayest observe to do according to all the law which Moses my servant commanded thee. turn not from it from the right hand or to the left that thou mayest prosper whethersoever thou goest. Wow. If I just focus on obeying the word, &gt;&gt; not my goals, not how I want things to do, but I'm going to straighten the preacher. I'm going to straighten the church out. &gt;&gt; I'm going to let them know. No, just stay with the word. &gt;&gt; Stay with the word. You want your life to prosper, stay with the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; This book of the law shall not depart out of thy mouth, but thou shalt meditate therein day and night, that thou mayest observe to do according to all that is written therein. &gt;&gt; For then and only then thou shalt make thy way prosperous, and then thou shalt have good success. &gt;&gt; And he comes back for the third time. Have not I commanded thee? Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and be of good courage. Be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed, for the Lord thy God is with thee, whethersoever thou goest. Now, God has given us one thing to do, and that is to believe the word from cover to cover. Get serious about this message. Get the message in your home. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Get it in your home. Get it in your heart. Get it in your lives. Dig into it. Don't expect the five-fold ministry up here to do it for you. You've got one that you should be listening to all the time. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. That's how you become strong and of good courage. We don't come to church just to be encouraged only. No sir. No madam. No Christian friend. We don't come to church just to be encouraged only. We must encourage ourselves to follow the word that comes from the church &gt;&gt; to observe all to do accordingly that is written. I know it's it may not be exactly what you want to hear, but it'll definitely get you down the road. &gt;&gt; It'll definitely take you through hard times. It'll definitely meet you when the going gets tough and you ain't got nobody to turn to. But God will be there. He'll meet you. He'll meet you. He said, "I'll never leave you. I'll never forsake you. I'll be with you whethersoever thou goest." &gt;&gt; We don't need brother John. All we need is God. &gt;&gt; God before us. Who can be against us? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We want to make our way prosperous and have good success. We must learn to encourage oursel &gt;&gt; to meditate on God's word day and night. Though none go with me, still I'll follow. Learn to encourage yourself. Turn with me to John uh Jonah chapter 2. Now, I just need you to pray that you get this real quick. You say a lot of amens and that you don't look at me like, uh um what's going on? And that we get through this because I want to get to the good part. &gt;&gt; Jonah encouraged himself in the Lord right in the midst of adversity. Jonah chapter 2:1 Then Jonah prayed unto the Lord his God out of the fish's belly. And he said, 'I cried by the reason of my affliction unto the Lord, and he heard me. Out of the belly of hell cried I, and he heardest my voice. For thou has cast me into the deep, in the midst of the sea, and the floods compass me about to all thy billows and thy waves pass over me. Then said, I I am cast out of thy sight. Yet I will look again toward thy holy temple. I don't think anybody has ever been in this predicament. This would have been doomsday. This would have been I'm a goner. I mean, I messed up. I I rebelled against God for the last time. I'm in a pickle. And I can imagine the devil was beating him up. Do you know, brother Ron, there was nobody there to encourage him. &gt;&gt; There wasn't one person there to encourage him. You know what he had to do? He had to remember the word of God that he read before. &gt;&gt; He had to remember. And that word is what encouraged him. &gt;&gt; Praise God. The waters compass me about even to my soul. The depths clothed me about. The weeds were wrapped around my head. I went down to the bottoms of the mountains. The earth was her. Bars was about me forever. Yet has thou brought me up my life from corruption. Oh Lord my God, when my soul fainted within me, I remembered the Lord and my prayer came in unto thee into thy holy temple. So you're praying from here, but your prayers is reaching God. Amen. &gt;&gt; They that observe lying vanities forsake their own mercy. We can either stare at our problem and be discouraged or we can encourage oursel in the Lord in the midst of adversity. Say, "I'm not going to look at that. I'm going to believe in the promises of God. &gt;&gt; But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving. and I will pay that which I have vowed. Salvation is the Lord. I wonder sometimes when we come to church why it is so hard for us to praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; We owe that vow to God. &gt;&gt; We should not be asked, hey, let's praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; There should be something inside of a believer who's full of thanksgiving. I will pay my vow in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; I will give praise to my God. &gt;&gt; Look for all that he's done for me. I'll tell you when he did that at that time when that praise went forth and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah unto dry land. &gt;&gt; Praise is the way to get God on the scene. He inhabits the praises of his people. &gt;&gt; Now sometimes we cry because of our our affliction as well, right? The things that we go through. But we hold the power of encouragement right inside of us. And we need to remember whenever we're in a trial, we need to encourage ourselves in the Lord. That means trust in him. &gt;&gt; Trust in God that he'll he'll be there to see you through because it's through that encouragement that you begin to build your faith in the situation. Without faith, it's impossible to please him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you've got to put in action this this confidence, this trust that God is going to see me through. He's not forsaken me. He's with me. There there's a there's a purpose in this. I I I I I I just going to trust God in this situation. &gt;&gt; Don't look at your lion vanities. Now, even though David was a born leader, he was anointed king, he was a man that God chose after his own heart. &gt;&gt; David still had to encourage himself in the Lord. &gt;&gt; I'll say it like this. Nobody else was going to do it for him. In fact, they weren't just off doing what they wanted, Brother Ron. They wanted to stone him. &gt;&gt; They wanted to stone him. Let's get rid of our leader. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How easy it would have been just to quit. Sometimes we're not getting what we want from somebody and we just want to quit. Come on. Who wants to who wants to enjoy the message with me today? Because I I can't imagine being in David's situation. I'd much rather be in the situations that I'm in. You know what I'm saying? But we need to learn not to murmur and complain about our situation. We need to encourage ourselves saying, "God is with me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is with me. &gt;&gt; The city in which they live was completely burned with fire and all the women including his wives were taken captive. But D, the Bible says that David was greatly distressed. For the people spake of stoning him, because the soul of all the people was grieved, every man for his sons and his daughters, but David encouraged himself in the Lord his God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He couldn't speak for the murmurss and complaining, but he knew his God. &gt;&gt; Amen. One time he said, "When my heart is overwhelmed, lead me to the rock that's higher than I." &gt;&gt; Psalm 3:6, "I will not be afraid of 10,000 people that have set themselves against roundabout." So, who cares who's against you? If God before you, who can be against you? Psalms 5:7, "But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy, and in thy fear will I worship toward the holy temple." Psalms 18:2, "The Lord is my rock, my fortress, my deliverer, my God, my strength, and whom I will trust, my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, and my high tower. I will call upon the Lord, who is worthy to be praised. So shall I be saved from my enemy. David learned to encourage himself in the Lord. And we hold the that same power of encouragement, every one of us, inside of us. If the Bible says I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me, then I can do all things through Christ who strengthen me. Yes. &gt;&gt; If the Bible says, "Greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world, then I believe greater is God inside of me than he that's in the world." &gt;&gt; We, like Job, hold the power to stay encouraged in the midst of adversity. Job's family was slain. They were all destroyed. His friends secretly judged him. His wife turned against him. God refused to comfort him. In all this, Job sinned not, nor charged God foolishly. Job humbled himself, fell down on the ground, and the Bible says he worshiped God. You know, we just want to go and tell everybody our hard trial that we're going through that shouldn't have happened. And I got to tell you what my friend did, my mom did, my daughter, my husband, my wife, my &gt;&gt; Why do you got to tell that? &gt;&gt; You got to tell that because you're not in the spirit. You got to tell that because you're not trusting in God. I'm telling you, God is calling a bride to wake up, to grow up, to stay up, and get ready for a rapture. &gt;&gt; That's what God's doing. &gt;&gt; He's getting us prepared. &gt;&gt; Though he slay me, Job said, "I'm still going to trust him." &gt;&gt; I wonder if there's somebody here today that says, "I don't care what God does in my life. I'm still going to trust him. &gt;&gt; I'm going to hold you to this. I don't want you murmuring and complaining anymore. &gt;&gt; It's got to stop. &gt;&gt; For he said, "I will never leave you. I will never forsake you that we may boldly say, the Lord is my helper. I will not fear what man shall do unto me." Bible says, "For though we are killed all day long, we are counted sheep as the slaughter, yet in all these things we're more than conquerors through him that loved us." Think about our the father of our faith, Abraham. We can we hold the very same faith that our father Abraham holds. Are we are we not? We're children of Abraham. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "Who against hope, he believed in hope." Amen. &gt;&gt; Being not weak in faith, he considered not his own body being dead when he was about a hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb. He staggered not at the promises of God through unbelief, but was strong in faith, giving glory to God, and being fully persuaded that what he had promised, he was able also to perform. I don't want to be the mediocre Christian who just comes to church and isn't interested in being changed. &gt;&gt; I'm interested in becoming in the image of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I want to become so much more like him than I am now. I got a ways to go, brother Ryan, but I'm pressing in by the grace of God. I'm gonna get there. I believe it. Paul who lived in adversity and afflictions and persecutions. He encouraged himself and we can be just like Paul. Paul was beaten, whipped, stoned, suffered, prisoned, shipwreck, perils of all sorts. If Paul was going to receive glory for any of his devotions and and things that he did, it was going to be through his sufferings &gt;&gt; because that's all he had. He lived a life of suffering. Amen. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 11:30 says, "If I must glory, I will glory of the things which concern my infirmities." In the midst of his adversity, as a physical affliction, he learned to encourage himself in the Lord. There was nobody there to encourage him. No one else. 2 Corinthians 12:9. And he said unto me, God said unto him, "My grace is sufficient for you. For my strength is made perfect in weakness. Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in all my problems, in my infirmities." Why? Why would you say something like that? Because that's the opportunity that the power of Christ may rest upon me. Amen. &gt;&gt; If everything's going good, people ain't going to see Christ in you. &gt;&gt; They're just going to see you're happy. You're happy. Well, you go to Cedar Point, you see a lot of happy kids. You you you if you're there at you're at the date uh the date the gate walking into uh some casino, you're going to see a lot of parents big smiles. It's when they're leaving that you see the frowns, right? &gt;&gt; It's not about being happy. &gt;&gt; It's about Christ being inside of you and living his life through us. &gt;&gt; Therefore, I take pleasure in my infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities and persecutions, in distresses for Christ's sake. For when I'm weak, then am I strong. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I can do all things through Christ who strengthenth me. Paul commanded us to be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus to endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. He says,"I suffer truffle as an evildoer even unto my bound bonds. Therefore, I endure all things for the elect's sake that the elect of God may also obtain salvation which is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory." He said, 'Be strong in the Lord, in the power of his might.' We're commanded by the Lord throughout the scriptures. It's a command. It's not a choice. It's not a choice because I'm telling you, as soon as you become weak and you're not strong, the devil is going to get you. &gt;&gt; He and he's going to make you so fruitless spiritually that you don't even care about people. &gt;&gt; Yes, it's the truth. I've seen it. You go through the weekend, it's all about you. There's no nothing on your mind about winning a soul. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; This gospel isn't for you alone. &gt;&gt; The reason God brought you in was so he could use you to bring the rest of the family in. It didn't stop with you. If it stopped with you, the rapture would have taken place. We like David hold the power to encourage ourselves in the Lord. Though a host should encamp against me, my heart shall not fear. Though war should rise against me, in this I'll be confident. The Lord is my light and my salvation. Whom shall I fear? The Lord is my strength of my life. of whom shall I be afraid? We hold the power to encourage ourselves in the Lord. We hold it. Don't place it in somebody else's hand. Don't place it in the song leader. Don't place it in the preacher. It's you believing the word of God. &gt;&gt; If you can believe the word of God, all things are possible. There was no way that Jonah could have, you know, picked up the phone and dialed 911 or, "Hey, hey, congregation, I'm sorry. Come and grab me, will you? &gt;&gt; I'm in this pickle." No. So often God puts us in situations that forces us to look to him, &gt;&gt; to encourage ourselves in him. God deals with us as individuals. We're here at church. We're a body. We're a local body. We're supposed to function as a body. But I'm telling you, not everyone. God deals with us individuals. Though none go with me, still I'll follow. &gt;&gt; We've got to be willing to get more serious with God &gt;&gt; to walk out of here. I'm going to become more like Jesus. I'm going to get serious with my walk with God. Don't take it at your pace. Take it at God's pace. We hold the power to encourage ourselves in the Lord by thinking on these things by keeping our mind stayed upon him by remembering that nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus. It doesn't matter the adversity. If God be for us who can be against us he that spared not his own son but delivered him up for us all. How shall God not freely give us all things? He ended by saying,"For I am persuaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. We don't have to wait to get to heaven to get filled with God's love." &gt;&gt; You can have it right here. Fact, you can have it right now. Amen. &gt;&gt; You want it bad enough, you can have as much God as you you want because God is endless. You can never get too much of him. &gt;&gt; I think the problem is we get too much too much of ourselves. We get too full of ourselves, too satisfied. Right? Isaiah 30:15 says, "For thi, for thus sayeth the Lord God, the Holy One of Israel, in returning and rest shall you be saved, and quietness and confidence shall be your strength." What did he tell the children of Israel at the Red Sea? Be stand still and know the salvation of the Lord and know that I am God. Stand still and know that I am God. God wants us to look to him. That confidence is right here. I don't care if the bottom falls out, the boss fires us, the the the dinner burns, the tires are flat, we got more bills than we got money. Nothing matters. We have what it's inside to take us through. &gt;&gt; We have it. We We don't look to anybody else to, you know, pat us on the back anymore. We're growing up children. &gt;&gt; Now we're sons and daughters of God. We're we're mature adopted children. We're not tossed to and fro. &gt;&gt; Just remember, let's stand together. Well, we hold the power. We hold the power within us to encourage ourselves in the Lord. Some of you may have heard the story about a a donkey and he was an old donkey and he could hardly pull things anything more. He couldn't plow the the gardens any anymore. And this old farmer said, "Well, we'll just get rid of them. We'll just get rid of them. and next time he's by this big well that doesn't work anymore cuz it's all dried up. We'll just kind of push him in the well. And so he got pushed into the well and he didn't know what was happening. Lucky he didn't break any of his legs but he was certainly bruised up and he was crying for help. Help me. Help me. And no one helped him. His owner just said it's just time to go. You've served your purpose. I have no more use for you. And so he didn't have any help, any encouragement. And then all of a sudden he felt the dirt hit his back from the the old farmer. He started burying this donkey alive. And he cried all the more, "Help me. Honk honk." Whatever they they do. But they went but but no one responded and nobody came. &gt;&gt; So this donkey, you know what he did? He encouraged himself in the Lord. &gt;&gt; He took the adversity that was on his back. He shook it off. &gt;&gt; And then he stood on top of that adversity and he walked his way up and he walked right out. If God be for you, &gt;&gt; that's all you need. &gt;&gt; You don't need anything else. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing. I have decided to follow Jesus. &gt;&gt; Decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. I have decided to follow Jesus. No turning back. No turning back. The cross before me. The world behind me. The cross before me. The world behind me. The cross before me, the world behind me. No turning back. No turning back. Take this whole world, but give me Jesus. Take this whole world, but give me Jesus. Take this whole world, but give me Jesus. I won't turn back. I won't turn back. I have started for the kingom. I have started for the kingom. I have started for the kingom. I won't turn back. I won't turn back. Though none go with me, still I will follow. Though none go with me, still I will follow. Though none go with me, still I will follow. No turning back. No turning back. Amen. No turning back. &gt;&gt; You won't regret it. There won't be one person that will ever regret it.
