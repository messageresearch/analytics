appreciate everybody cooking giving and just wanting to be a family today amen amen well if you have your Bibles and you'd like to turn with us to the book of Colossians chapter 2. good to see each and everyone out today amen God bless our our young sister here God bless you yes amen good to see brother Mike Amen brother Jason good to see him amen good to have God's presence amongst us amen amen before we begin uh reading if we could just bow in a word of prayer with me dear heavenly father Lord we need you we need you so very much and we pray that your precious presence would come now and break the bread of life to each of us today father where our eyes need to be open a little bit more would you open them where our ears need to be opened a little bit more would you help us to hear what your spirit's saying Lord would you just cause us to be the kind of people that you you've ordained us to be from the very beginning Lord that when we leave here when we when it comes time that you catch your bride away that we wouldn't be lacking we wouldn't be out of balance but we would be exactly where you'd have us to be Lord we don't want to miss that day please come Lord and fill us with your word bless the reading of this word Lord give us the Revelation and we'll be careful to give you the praise and the honor for these things for we humbly pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen I wanted to actually start in Colossians chapter 1 at the end of it to try to get the continuity of where I'm going with this maybe we could start with Colossians 1 verse 20. um 26 we start with 26 there even the mystery which have been hit from ages and from Generations but now has made manifest to his Saints to whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles now notice what the mystery is it's Christ in you it's the hope of the Rapture amen whom we preach warning every man it takes that doesn't it and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in Christ Jesus we're into I also labor striving according to the working which worketh in me mightily keeping this same this same thought going for I would that ye knew what great conflict I have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh that their hearts might be comforted being knitted together in love and unto all Riches of the fullness of a a full Assurance of understanding to the acknowledgment of this mystery of God here it is again to the acknowledgment so this Christ in you amen and of the father and of Christ in whom are HID all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge and this I say lest any man should beguile you with enticing words for though I be absent in the flesh yet I am with you in spirit join and be holding your order and the steadfastness of your faith in Christ as ye have therefore received Jesus Christ the lord so walk ye in him that's a huge responsibility right there rooted and built up in him established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving amen God bless you may be said I want to entitle this message abounding with Thanksgiving I want to say it's good to see sister Jeannie back and amen you know um every time someone's not here I recognize it can't but help recognize it good to see brother Johnson back amen um I believe that God one day we're going to be together and we'll never ever go a day as it were and separate will be together for eternity a bounty with Thanksgiving or the giving of thanks sometimes it's easy to abound with Thanksgiving and sometimes it's hard things can steal away our joy and our gratitude sometimes our trials and problems afflictions they can steer us away from abounding with Thanksgiving but there are other things that can shrink wrap our gratitude in life we live in a world of materialism people are so full they're full to the brim of themselves a society that feels entitled to what it receives will not adequately Express gratitude there are thieves of unthankfulness that can slip into our lives things like pride and arrogancy vanity and envy Strife unforgiveness self-righteousness judgmentalness all these can steal away gratitude Paul warned us just before the coming of the Lord that the church would be going through perilous times and I'll tell you we know the world that we're living in is horrible the world's going through troubled times but he said the church will be as well members of the church would become so full of themselves in excessive sense of self-importance he described the church as lovers of their own selves covetist bolsters proud fierce wow false accusers Traders just forgetting about what they said in the past heady high-minded unthankful unthankful lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God now it's really really hard a Believer has to fight through a lot of spirits to actually be abounding with Thanksgiving but I believe that there's a bride that will deny her flesh and that opens the door to abound in Thanksgiving because if you don't put this flesh under subjection you will always find something to complain about commit and I'll tell you this this is an important scripture that that that we have something I think that we just we Overlook we want to be rooted we want to be built up we want to be established in the faith but we need to be abounding with Thanksgiving I want to turn to some scriptures today I want them to to dictate to us what our life should be did you know that if you really believe church will change your life but you got to really believe you can't believe carnally or picking and choosing I want you to write this scripture down first Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13. first Thessalonians chapter 2 verse 13 for this calls also thank we god without ceasing when's the last time you thank god without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which he heard of us you received it not as the word of men just a man saying that but as it is in truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe the word of God really works it's not just a religion there's power in believing the word things can it can give you Joy it can give you peace it can it can help you go through trials God never promised us sunshine he promised us peace he promised us joy and that's what we're after Psalms 100 if you turn with me I'll tell you if we could enter into the spirit of this Psalm every day would be a Thanksgiving Day Psalms 100 verse 1 says Make a Joyful Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands A Joyful Noise now how do you do that I mean think about it we make a lot of noises but we need to make a Joyful Noise and it needs to be unto the Lord you know sometimes we make we make noises for attention right but we need to make a Noise unto the Lord All Ye Lands not just America but everywhere serve the Lord with gladness serve him with gladness I'm so glad to be alive come before him what's singing amen song in your heart you know you don't have to wait for church to that happen you could just you know be all by yourself but you want to come into His presence start with a song yes just start singing before you know it you're going to feel better his presence will come near you I mean this is the word of God I tell you our minds need to be made up before we come into church you know if your mind isn't made up I'm I'm going to come before him with praise and thanksgiving you're not you're gonna struggle know ye that the Lord he is God it is he that made us and not we that made ourselves we are the his people and the Sheep of his Pastor you know too often we think we are in control of Our Lives that we call the shots that we're going to do what we want to do as if God did not make us but God made us we belong to him we pay attention to him his word is our absolute amen so we need to know that know the Lord know in that measure we're not a part of Darwin's theory where something special where are the people that God has created enter into his gates with Thanksgiving and into his courts with praise and and don't stop there be thankful unto him be thankful and bless his name that's a it comes from the heart for the Lord is good not sometimes but all the time his Mercy is Everlasting and his truth endureth to all generations I wonder how often we've come before is his Gates without the respect that's right a praise the respect of Thanksgiving the respect of gratitude that we think this is an option this is not an option to God it may be an option to us but it is not an option to God when we don't praise him when we don't come before him the way he says we are disrespecting God [Music] and then we sit here in church and wonder why we don't feel the presence of God come on I'll tell you the whole world could be blown up around you but if you're praising God and you're in his presence where did the prophet say he'd rather where would he like to be when the play Scrolls blows up he wants to be in the word the word is here praise the word amen God requires respect when we come before him not just making it to church it's a condition our attitude has to be right we have to give him praise I'll tell you when Isaiah was in the presence of the Lord he saw things going on he saw angels that were continuously praising God just non-stop it's because God expects that he demands it they weren't options they weren't over to the side talking to one Angel talking to the other yeah look what's going on over there look at that angel you know they're in the prayer room they're praying all that's crazy okay no there was an order in heaven and God was the creator of the beans and these beings were created to get praise and honor and sometimes we just forget I'll tell you why sometimes we don't praise God like we should when we come to church it's because we don't bring it with us there's nothing to do about what songs being sung or what sermons being preached it is to do with where a heart's been sisters know how it feels like when you spend hours cooking preparing a meal just to have someone plop down and start eating and express no gratitude for the time that you spent preparing come on anybody ever experienced that a little thank you would be nice sometimes our attitude well that's your job my job's at work your job is or I just I don't feel like I got too many problems today come on I want you to think about all the things that God does for you every day he gives you new mercies every day amen he's taking care of us we daily sin and we need his Mercy he protects us from so many things he's a present help in a time of trouble he's still Jehovah Jireh his grace is still sufficient to meet our needs he's Jehovah Rapha he's still our healer he still heals our hearts when they become broken he's still he's still Jehovah shalom Jesus is still our peace we don't find peace anywhere else he gave us his love he's still given us more and more and more of his love it was his love that said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you he's doing that daily he's preparing Our Lives daily and we come into His presence and we forget to thank him for it embrace how does that make him feel well brother John I just don't feel like it hmm I don't believe there's one angel in heaven that feels that way all the other ones got kicked out they said we're not going to have this selfishness in heaven you don't let me be God over your life he cast him down to earth I'll tell you we think it's a choice but it's a respect there's a big difference God spends all this time taking care of us and we need to remember to respect God to give him what he deserves he deserves our Praises he deserves our Thanksgiving he deserves us to bless his name to make a Joyful Noise forget about how hard it is forget about how you feel Psalm 68 verse 19 said blessed be the Lord who daily lordeth us with benefits even the god of our salvation who daily sometimes we go through the day and we Where's God Where's God our eyes are awful what he's doing for us we're focusing on what we want instead of what he's doing come on we need to bless the Lord for what he's doing for us you know one thing I've I've in my life what I've noticed is the more thankful you are the more he gives you I know the scripture teaches me to not murmur not complain the children of Israel when they came out of Egypt the majority of them murmured and complained God wasn't pleased with it now Joshua and Caleb had to go through the same things right they had to go through the same muck that everybody else went through when they came out the same trials the the lacking of water when the got the water was bitter uh uh having to eat the the same Mana every day and all the trials that they went through but they went through it without murmuring and complaining they cut their eyes on what God was doing for them how can you forget the pit that he brought you from he brought us out of the Myra clay amen sometimes we forget the blessings that are connected to being a child of God Psalms 103 verse 1 bless the Lord O my soul your soul is saved amen bless the Lord O my soul and all all that's within me bless His holy name sometimes we can't even get a little peep out sometimes we'll sit in church and we won't even peep praise the Lord bless the Lord Almighty I hope you don't get mad at me I'm just going to be as provoking as I can I believe I believe the Lord wants us to bless his name more than we do verse two bless the Lord O my soul and forget now all his benefits oh sometimes we got to write things down because you know we get so busy right so many things that are happening all of a sudden we're we forget what God has done for us so maybe writing them down is not a bad idea go back it and look at that list count your blessings see what God have done it it will so it will surprise you it won't surprise you how's that go of the things he's done for you you know what I'm trying to say we just forget but if we can get our mind on it all right look at these benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities oh my aren't you glad for that every one of them he forgiveth all thine iniquities he doesn't leave some undone if you're if you confess them the Bible says he is faithful and just to forgive us amen who forgiveth all thine iniquities who healeth all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crowneth thee with loving kindness and Tender Mercies who satisfieth thy mouth with good things so that the youth is renewed like the eagles are oh forget not the benefits I think something happens in our life when we forget the benefits I mean the the children of Israel they forgot them right and he swore they would not enter into the rest so they came out of the world they walked through a process of sanctification and never quite got through it and so through our process of of getting to where God is really calling us to we can slip away in this murmuring and complaining forget what God is really doing you know we don't hate our flesh enough that's the problem we like ourselves too much but it's our flesh that gets me in trouble it is not my brother it's not my sister it's me oh Lord that's standing in the need of prayer if this thing can be crucified then Christ can come alive in our lives I love the word Psalms 116 verse I don't want to encourage you this morning enter into the word amen enter into the word say Amen to the word it's our it's our absolute your flesh may not like it that may not that that may be why you don't want to say Amen but your soul is rejoicing Psalms 116 verse 12 what shall I Render unto the Lord for all his benefits towards me what shall I render what should I do well I'll just come in church and I'll see what God's got for me I will take the cup of Salvation and call upon the name of the Lord look what he says here I will pay my vows unto the Lord now in the presence of all his people right it sounds like God demands the respect of blessing His holy name in church it's not an option don't make it an option don't let the devil tell you it's an option if there is a failure the failure is here why don't we get to the place church that we're literally praising God too much see what happens see how he hurts the church or is is negative towards the church you know what I'm saying we sit here and kind of Judge whether we're I've done enough I've praised God enough well I'm coming against that spirit God wants more praise yeah and I just say it like this let this message be for the rest of your life for every time you go to church you and God it's not about you and everybody else I'll do it if everybody else says no you do it because you love God because he he he redeemed you he saved you he's blessed you this week a lot of times we don't realize but gratitude is the thing that could be missing the psalmist said that we're to enter his Gates and to be thankful to be thankful we got scriptures that talk about being thankful for our trials I mean stretching the boundary sometimes not that we you know really want them in our lives but we need a right attitude towards them brother Brandon says it's not the action that happens to you but it's how you react towards it that's what counts being thankful comes from the inside of a man's heart and honestly God expects it and demands it to be expressed outwardly think about that a noise comes aloud when Isaiah was in heaven he didn't see a was in silence foreign God is always long for Fellowship he's long for praise we were created to praise him but for some reason this flesh keeps us from giving the respect that God demands and I use this word because we know he he wants us to respect him all right we know he deserves it but we don't think often that he demands it but he does he demands it sometimes our own negative attitude can get in the way of abounding in Thanksgiving you know if you're going to abound you got to get the train going down the track you got to put some some coal in the engine you got to get things going you got to start off our own selfishness our own ungratefulness can get in the way we want to blame our problems and our neighbors and our jobs and our and this and that and God is God is looking for jobs that's what he's he's looking for jobs someone that's going to maintain no matter what happens to him Psalms 34 Verse 1 I Will Bless The Lord at all times at all times his praise shall continually be in my mind heart mouth he wants it to come out continually my soul shall make her boast in the Lord now the humble shall hear thereof and they're going to be glad that means those that are fighting Pride kind of want to sit there and don't be told to praise the Lord come on I look at look it is not you it is not you it's the spirits that get on you that's who I'm talking to the thing is you're the one that's got to agree with the word and say get behind me Satan I'm going to praise the Lord I'm going to bless him with all my heart oh magnify the Lord with me we sing it didn't we o magnify the Lord with me and let us exalt his name by ourselves we come together brothers and sisters of light precious faith you know you can't go in a grocery store and just run up to everybody say let's praise the Lord but when you're in his house we all come for the same purpose we ought to feel like a family of God here there ought to be such Unity here we ought to feel comfortable praising God next to our brothers and sisters I sought the Lord and he heard me and he delivered me from all my fears how many Deliverance today amen we have a God he can Deliver Us from all of our fears and we Face them we all face them you may not think you got it right this second but be honest we Face them but you just seek the Lord he promised to deliver from all our fears now perfect love would just cast it out and I'll tell you you just fall so in love with God amen you're secure in his love now the Lord notices when an invitation to exalt his name together comes and there's an unwillingness there you know what I'm talking about right let's just praise the lord well you know I'm not going to do that or how about this one God didn't tell me but the humble I'm telling you they're going to be glad sometimes we rely on our feelings more often than not people rely on their feelings to tell them when it's time to praise yeah if their feelings are telling them well they're not in the mood if they're too tired they had a hard day been through the wringer or they just don't feel like doing it their feelings become their decision maker on whether they're going to praise God or not their feelings Trump the word Oh Brother John I'm just I'm just being human hmm but this is a place to let your soul rejoice in the Lord yield your soul to the Lord if we're only going to express our Thanksgiving when we feel like it God will be missing out on a lot of the respect that he deserves that's number one and number two you're going to be missing out on a lot of Joy from being in his presence we need to learn from the scriptures they teach us we need to focus and maintain a grateful attitude in our heart for things there are always things around us to be grateful for be grateful for the seat that we're sitting in the heat that we have in the room a place that we can come together brothers and sisters that we know that pray for us we just need to to look more for them and and stay focused on them I understand things can become difficult I understand difficulties uh believe me I'm a fellow servant of difficulties and sufferings I I know about them Oh Brother John things are so bad that I can't possibly focus on anything except my problems right now you just have no idea what I'm going through do you You couldn't possibly see or understand my situation it just seems like we've always got the wrong attitude it's through these times that we give the respect that God deserves he doesn't deserve less respect because you don't feel like it it's not our feelings it's not our problems it's not our circumstances God is worthy to be praised at all times we just got to sink that get get it through I'm telling you because if you keep your mind on praising God your troubles won't seem so bad and you know I think sometimes he's just waiting for us to start praising him and giving the glory that he deserves so he'll do something for you hey man God don't want our feelings above his word think about Paul and Silas when they were thrown into prison for no wrong they did and they were persecuted for doing good Shackles on their feet germs and diseases all around them you know the things that would go into prison back then these the prisons we got now are halfway decent the government was against them there was nothing to help their feelings to want to praise God not a thing no outside support group nothing there saying come on but something inside of them I'll tell you what to stop most believers but it didn't stop Paul it didn't stop Silas no there was something inside of them called g-o-d called the Holy Ghost I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you to the end it's a strong belief they had Grateful Hearts I'll tell you they were abounding with Thanksgiving sometimes we think we need a better situation to be in a better set of circumstances until we feel like praising God or someone just to help us no sir if they maintained it a grateful heart a Heart of Thanksgiving Soul can I so can I tell you hubby's been in prison well excuse me hummy's been in prison with shackles on your feet humans been in that condition absolutely right and if you were in that condition how many were you praising God like Paul and Silas I'll tell you the angel of the Lord just came and took care of those chains I'll tell you A lot of times we're we're bolted down by the chains of this world change the circumstances chains of doubt problems in her life and we need to look to the author of our salvation the one who began to work in us the one who's forgiven us of our sins the one who's redeemed us the one that loves us with benefits first Thessalonians 5 16 tells us to Rejoice Evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus and you know what my friend it's concerning you and you and you and you and you and you and you it's a personal thing from God to you it is his will for your life now that word give thanks it means to be grateful it means to actually Express gratitude that means when you're talking to somebody they're going to hear coming forth out of you how grateful you are to your lord in some fashion former way they're going to see a gratefulness that you have in your heart for what God has done in your life God has a perfect will for our lives and it's to abound with Thanksgiving don't just make it a little bit of your life but make it so that when everybody thinks about you there's someone who's abounding in Thanksgiving when they have a thought when they're reminded when something comes up the first thing that comes to them is boy you know they're just always grateful they're just always thankful they're just always abounding come on now I want our lives to change that's why we're here we're not here to get on a as it were uh just a report card we're about coming from where we're at to where he's calling us to going back to our opening scripture Colossians 2 verse 4 and this I say listening man should beguile you with enticing words for though I'd be absent in the flesh yet I'm with you in the spirit join and beholding your order and your steadfastness of your faith in Christ isn't this a beautiful thought to have of others as ye have therefore received Christ Jesus the Lord so walk in him don't put him on the Shelf don't make him a Jew boy don't make him just you know take care of all my problems walk with him walk with him make it so personal that people think they're ignoring you because he seems to be talking to Jesus all the time be an oddball now notice there's a colon afterward him and that's used to proceed a list of items or an expansion or an explanation so in other words we're going to talk about what it means to walk with them rooted and built up in them established in the faith amen believe in the Lord and you shall be established Believe In His prophets and you shall prosper rooted building him built up and established in the faith as you have been taught what have I been taught abounding therein with Thanksgiving I've been taught it Paul said I have learned that whatever state I'm in there with to be content the disciples were taught how to pray we're being taught how to abound with Thanksgiving don't make it just a little part of your life make it the major part of your life I'm bound with Thanksgiving He's Worthy He's Worthy that word a bounty with Thanksgiving it means to Super abound in quantity and quality so in other words our gratefulness and our thankfulness needs to become a greater quality not just some but make it clear that it's obvious to the people that watch your lives you're super grateful thankful for him it means to be in excess he wants me to be excessive with this Thanksgiving whoa this this doesn't this doesn't compute with my mind no it doesn't his thoughts are higher than our thoughts it means to be superfluous which to the flesh may seem unnecessary or too much to cause to excel to make more abound to have more abundance to be more abundant to be the better to exceed to excel to increase to to do over and evolve that's what it means that's what this scripture means abounding therein with Thanksgiving it means a little bit more than okay John I got your point I heard it can you go on no I can't go on because this is the message today our feelings won't always be grateful but the Holy Ghost Inside of us will always respect God's word which of his word says Praise Him without ceasing be thankful always to abound with it then I'm going to do that because I'm compelled Paul says it's no longer me but it's Christ in me fulfilling fulfilling the will of God God is worthy of all of our praise at all times amen don't wait till you get to church but I'll say when you get here enter his gates with Thanksgiving and I'll say remain thankful while you're in the gates and I'll say this when you leave the gates be thankful thankfulness is the center Hub well brother John I've got this other thing on my mind and I'm trying to wrestle and deal with it well you know I understand but that attitude if you allow that it will always be Trump it'll always Trump coming the right way because if it's not one thing today it'll be another thing next service and another thing next service and then another service and before you know it you're coming to service with all this and you're missing the very thing that God wants you to be doing which is a bounding with Thanksgiving we're staring at all of our problems too much well brother John you don't understand my problem is much worse than yours I wish I had what you had no you don't I'll tell you what there's nobody here that would like the debt that I owe today don't compare God is with you God's going to see you through God wants every one of us wherever we're at to be abounding with Thanksgiving praising God it is a personal choice in one way but that doesn't mean our soul has a choice in the matter our flesh may feel like it has a choice but a genuine believer filled with the Holy Ghost he doesn't have a choice in the matter he reads this word and it becomes his absolute it's his law that God has written in his heart and he begins to manifest it outwardly you know I'm just I'm so tired of a devil that tries to get us to pick a cherry pick of what scriptures we want to go by and which ones we don't come on now I can't believe it's so quiet after I said that I mean the word is the word we come here hungering for the word now your flesh don't want all the word I understand that my flesh don't I understand that but this is a relationship between your soul and God and your soul feeds on every word of God it's the only way we'll become the bride without spot or without wrinkle so we got to take this word and say oh God let me live it let me manifest it let my light be changed let me come into your house uh the way that you want me to don't sit here and sit here as if this is some seminar that we learn stuff this is God speaking to your hearts and souls he demands respect the respect of praise Thanksgiving in fact the scripture says everything that has breath praise ye the Lord he makes the trees to clap their hands and praise Him Jesus says if they hold their peace the rocks will cry out rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice we can see God in nature see him in the Grand Canyon it's a different mountain ranges we talk about the Trees of the forest and the Everglades the sun sets and the Sun rises all beautiful could you say Amen we can see God in all the animals he's a god of variety just one species he has so many different shapes and sizes and colors and some you know flap their wings like this on her property and something like this so fast you can't even see it he's awesome we can see God in his creation it's much easier to look at those things and abound with Thanksgiving that's true we even find ourselves looking at the beauty of some of these things and begin to weep and to cry but sometimes we look at our own life and can't give thanks we we don't look at the one Soul that's worth ten thousand worlds of sunsets and we can't give them praise for it the saving of your soul is worth praising God for today friends you can't find anything else to praise God for praise him for saving your soul go take your eyes you're more valuable than the sparrows look at the beauty of God inside of you the beauty of changing your nature we need to spend more time humbling ourselves under the mighty hand of God God has done so much for us if he never done another thing he'd be worthy if you praise him to your dad just amazing to me how much we've been disrespecting God it's true when we listen to the the tapes sometimes we can hear brother Brandon say let's just say let's say praise the Lord and then you hear the congregation saying praise the Lord when the Holy Ghost would say in our church let's praise the Lord sometimes we bow on our heart well I don't have to that's just brother John trying to work something up I'm more spiritual than that if that was really God it would just be happening on its own come on don't tell me we don't battle thoughts like that around but you know what we wouldn't dare to think that thought when we hear Brother Branham say it what's going on what's going on it shows that we're not believing it's the Holy Ghost talking friends I don't know look I would to God that we could be in a place we all could be in a place I don't care what planet it is what church it is but you could be in a place where you could actually believe but I'll tell you I have enough faith that if I go to a Catholic church I'll hear from God but I know he he called me out of it right but I know Jonah turn to God and heard heard God I don't care what state we're in I don't care what the situation is if you don't believe that God is real to you sitting there you've got to get to the altar you got to get your heart prepared the Holy Ghost says let's praise the Lord praise the Lord don't go by your feelings don't battle those thoughts the prophet was here saying it well I believe because he's the prophet what am I doing here then foreign exactly what was the prophet's gone we just all wait to the coming of the Lord no we got a five-fold Ministry that God said he had perfect the Saints with let's stay with the word I I don't think we praise God like we ought to you it's because we're not bringing him with us to church we're looking for excuses not to praise him sometimes when we come to the house of God we're not in the spirit and I understand you don't got time to prepare sometimes sometimes but it becomes a habit and then sometimes when we're here we're not prepared we're not serious in the prayer rooms I'm going to tell you we're not even right now God told us the remedy of blessing this church that we need to come together and pray one for another where is that happening well I pray for him that's not what God Said he said come together and pray one for another well that I just do that on prayer meeting oh when you make it you know we want God to bless but we're so unwilling to work you don't work you don't eat right you don't eat come on sometimes we come to the house of God we're not in the spirit and yet we'll crucify the song leader crucify somebody playing the instrument something's not right crucify the preacher the Sunday scoochie something just not right in church well I thought the Holy Ghost in you is supposed to help well no the Holy Ghost In Me Is made me a judge I'm an administrator of judgment shame on us I want to see the Holy Ghost in action bring the Holy Ghost with you brother Brennan said the message led by the spirit of God he said it's anything I hate Is that real still silence go around some of these old morgues around here you got them in Shreveport too Put Me In Mind of an Undertaker parlor you take a dead man in there and a balm him and keep him dead that's about the way it is teach them some old theology that's just as dead as it can be back there and never tell them about the Holy Ghost feeling them and giving him new life and and new leading that ought to excite us the Bible says we're Lively stones we're living Epistles amen First Peter chapter 2 First Peter chapter 2 verse 8. now we know everybody that we bring to this message isn't going to receive it and people are going to stumble they may walk a while and they may stumble First Peter chapter 2 verse 8 says and a stumbling a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word see they don't stumble at you they stumble at the word the word being disobedient they pick in in choosing what they want to obey where and to also they were appointed but that's some people but you are a chosen generation God has chosen you a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people you're just an oddball you're so peculiar what makes you so peculiar that you should show forth the Praises of him who have called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light amen That's What Makes You peculiar because you're praising him he brought me out of Darkness he's brought me until I'm going to the house Lord why because I'm going to receive more light that's why I'm going to the house of the Lord to receive more light for my life you know I'm anxious to walk in it too because I I have learned that when I walk in the light as he is in the light then I can have Fellowship more fellowship with him and one another which in times past were not a people but are now the people of God which had not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy how many thankful for that Mercy the mercy that re-rolled and it's still re-rolling our life let's not forget all his benefits let's not forget to communicate with God to praise him sometimes we just forget to praise him I tell you we don't we may not forget to tell them what we want right I want this Lori but we forget to praise him Hebrews 13 15 says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to God continually that is the very fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name but to do good and to communicate forget not God does not want us to forget to give thanks to his name for with such sacrifices God is well pleased how many wants to please God well amen remain grateful abound in Thanksgiving Philippians chapter 4 verse 6 I got to just skip some stuff because it's running very late God demands the respect of Praise of Thanksgiving of gratitude just a heart of gratitude you know if we're so full of gratitude just so full of it we'll be blinded to one another's hiccups we won't be staring at the problems that other people have you know if I was sitting out there and the preacher said that I'd really say Amen to that one I believe it I'm not one to say Amen to my own preaching Philippians 4 verse 6 be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving notice within everything with your prayers your supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God now if you do that thing the right way here's the blessing and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and your minds through Christ Jesus stay hungry for God stay grateful for God just mix your prayers with Thanksgiving [Music] There Were Ten lepers that came to Jesus only one abounded with Thanksgiving and when he came back Jesus the Bible says Jesus answered he said were there not ten cleansed were there not ten that received forgiveness he says but where are the nine there are not found that return to give glory to God Save The Stranger I just wonder sometimes where we're at I understand none of us got leprosy but leprosy is a type of sin which we all got and we all come and we we ask God to forgive us of our sins and he forgives us because he's faithful but I just wonder who's coming to abound in Thanksgiving who is that one that's coming should there not be all of us yes should we should we not be abounding you know you don't got to come to the altar just to to to to to seek him about a certain situation or to seek him about a closer walk which is important but you can come to the altar to give him thanks to abound with Thanksgiving let this be the place you meet God for everything I mean I believe God has answered a lot of prayers right here I believe God has met a lot of people right here a lot of needs but let this be the place that we can abound with Thanksgiving too When you pray abound with Thanksgiving I want to I want us to give God glory look what happened to Zacchaeus when when the real Joy Of God comes into a man's heart it'll change your very nature yes yes it will you won't just go back and say I'm sorry for the things I've done look at Zacchaeus he repaid four times I think it was for the wrongs he had done for the people he used I'm telling you he had God in his heart he was abounding in thankfulness oh my I wonder if there's any Zacchaeus is here today I wonder if there's anybody here that's been changed like Zacchaeus Was changed I'll tell you I I remember saying more than sorry you know here's the thing sometimes we're not sorry but we just say the word sorry and sometimes we just need to abound with Thanksgiving I'll tell you when you're forgiven of something aren't you grateful to express it press it express it if I if I hurt this brother here I did something to offend him just saying hey I'm sorry it just doesn't cut it with me it just doesn't cut it with me the least I could be is thankful for his forgiveness thankful that he understood that he's bearing with me praying with me being long suffering with me because that's what the scripture says forbearing one another in love that's what the Holy Ghost for the Holy Ghost is so we can get to so we can deal with one another and get along with one another better that's what the Holy Ghost is for it's not to keep your distance it's not to be standoffish to draw closer you got a pencil I just I'm going to do one but you just read the I'll say here's your homework for the next year read the book of Psalms read the book of Psalms it's just so filled with with Thanksgiving and praise and gratitude but I want to read this with you before we close because we got to eat Psalms 26 verse 7. it says that I may publish with the voice of Thanksgiving publish publish you know what it means to publish yes publish it now

himself everything that said everything that's done is all around God that's why we got church order when things get out of order we don't we take care of it we don't allow it right because God deserves to be respected man I've loved the habitation of the house and the place where thy honor dwelleth Hallelujah let's Stand Together let's walk abounding with Thanksgiving he is worthy yes I
