[11:52] amen god bless you we certainly
[11:54] appreciate that so i'll listing it
[11:56] together for the reading of the word
[11:59] you can find uh that
[12:03] in saint john chapter 14.
[12:06] we're just going to read one verse of
[12:09] scripture
[12:17] amen i think we'll we'll read it and
[12:20] then we'll have a word of prayer
[12:22] saint john chapter 14 verse number 26
[12:26] but the comforter which is the holy
[12:29] ghost
[12:30] whom the father will send in my name he
[12:34] will teach you all things
[12:36] and bring all things to your remembrance
[12:38] whatsoever
[12:40] i have said unto you amen let's look to
[12:43] them in prayer
[12:47] our dear heavenly father we
[12:51] all of us stand here absolutely
[12:57] helpless without you
[13:00] we need you lord to be able to even hear
[13:05] from you
[13:07] we need you to give us the ears to hear
[13:10] and lord we also need you this
[13:13] morning that you take these lips
[13:16] this tongue and this mind and these
[13:19] thoughts
[13:21] and lord that song we heard just
[13:24] give it back to you that you may speak
[13:29] your thoughts to us today lord that
[13:32] those
[13:32] thoughts would become real to us
[13:36] and that would they would become a part
[13:38] of our life
[13:40] so lord we ask that you take control
[13:43] lord of the
[13:44] service today that you'd bind up
[13:47] every disbelieving spirit every spirit
[13:50] that would try to
[13:52] keep us from the revelation that you
[13:55] would have for us
[13:56] we rebuke it in the name of jesus christ
[13:59] and we cast it
[14:00] forth lord may you take
[14:03] control lord of the atmosphere today
[14:06] lord
[14:07] may you bless every heart and every mind
[14:10] and lord bring us to the revelation that
[14:14] you would have for us today
[14:16] our dependency is upon you we also pray
[14:19] lord that
[14:19] you'd remember lord the individual needs
[14:22] that there would be
[14:23] in our midst lord lord whether it be
[14:26] some
[14:27] fighting depression some just uh
[14:30] being bothered by the things that are
[14:32] happening in the world
[14:33] lord perhaps bothered by the sicknesses
[14:36] and by this colvid and
[14:38] lord whatever would be a hindrance today
[14:41] we just ask that you'd raise up a
[14:43] standard in the name of jesus christ
[14:46] lord we thank you for your word for your
[14:48] word
[14:49] lord gives us power over these things
[14:52] and we
[14:52] lord we take charge today we love you
[14:55] today we thank you for your word we
[14:56] thank you for these
[14:58] songs lord we thank you lord
[15:01] for those that you have gathered
[15:03] together for those that are testifying
[15:05] today though none
[15:06] go with me still i will follow lord we
[15:10] just commit the furtherance of the
[15:11] service in your hands and ask that you
[15:13] would accomplish
[15:14] lord its very purpose now in jesus
[15:17] precious name we pray
[15:18] amen amen god bless you may be seated
[15:24] the last two services
[15:28] we had a little series on experiencing
[15:30] god's love
[15:33] and the first service was receiving
[15:35] god's love
[15:37] it was an awesome service
[15:41] we had the most compliments with that
[15:43] one
[15:44] the second service are releasing god's
[15:47] love
[15:48] well that was less popular
[15:52] that they didn't read have reached any
[15:54] popularity contest with that one
[15:57] um i may say things that you don't agree
[16:00] with
[16:02] and that's okay that's right brother
[16:04] branham said things that a lot of people
[16:05] didn't agree with
[16:08] paul had said things that it was even
[16:10] hard for the man who had the keys to the
[16:13] kingdom
[16:13] to understand brother branham said
[16:18] if he would be saying something and it
[16:21] didn't turn out right he says i want you
[16:23] to
[16:24] to to think about it in this way when
[16:26] you would go to eat
[16:27] chicken and you run into a bone you
[16:30] don't throw the whole meal away
[16:32] you just set the bone aside and you keep
[16:34] eating the chicken and i don't know many
[16:36] times
[16:36] i've taken out of my mouth some some
[16:39] some sliver of a bone or something and
[16:41] i never had a thought well i'm not going
[16:42] to eat anymore this meal
[16:46] now we might get a negative thought when
[16:48] we're in a restaurant that happens
[16:52] right but we won't do that at home
[16:57] or he said about having a cherry pie and
[16:59] you run into a pit
[17:01] he doesn't say well i'm disgusted with
[17:03] this pie
[17:04] you just put the pit aside so i'll say
[17:06] it like this when you
[17:08] you hear things that that don't agree
[17:11] with your real good
[17:12] just set that thing aside and keep
[17:14] eating don't stop eating
[17:19] sometimes it takes time for god to
[17:22] show us things
[17:26] the comforter which is the holy ghost
[17:28] whom the father will send in my name
[17:30] he will teach you all things and bring
[17:32] all things to your remembrance
[17:34] whatsoever i've said unto you
[17:37] now in order for the holy ghost to teach
[17:38] us something that means we haven't
[17:40] learned it yet
[17:41] amen so why would we come to church only
[17:44] agreeing with stuff that we already know
[17:47] it just doesn't make sense
[17:51] we wouldn't need a holy ghost then where
[17:54] do you know it
[17:55] so just because you don't agree with
[17:57] something doesn't mean it's not true
[18:01] the holy ghost teaches us it guides us
[18:03] it reminds us of things that we need to
[18:05] be reminded of
[18:06] paul said i stir up your minds by way of
[18:08] remembrance
[18:10] but what exactly is the holy ghost
[18:12] teaching us
[18:14] what is he guiding us and what is he
[18:16] reminding us of
[18:17] we want to speak on the comforter today
[18:20] and for a subject god's
[18:22] purpose for giving us the holy ghost
[18:28] else did jesus describe the comforter he
[18:30] described it as power in acts chapter 1
[18:33] verse 8
[18:34] he said but ye shall receive power after
[18:37] the holy ghost has come upon you and you
[18:39] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[18:41] jerusalem judea and sumerian unto the
[18:43] under most parts of the earth
[18:44] so this comforter not only teaches and
[18:46] guides us
[18:47] and reminds us but it's also a power
[18:51] to witness amen amen we're just going
[18:55] off of the words
[18:56] that jesus said but we want to dive into
[18:59] exactly
[18:59] what this is all about too often we have
[19:02] viewed the
[19:03] holy ghost comforter as being just
[19:06] something personal for us
[19:08] because we can't make a rapture without
[19:10] it and uh the spirit teaches
[19:12] us and guides us into all truth it helps
[19:15] us navigate and
[19:16] of all of our natural life issues
[19:20] how many listened to the tape last
[19:23] wednesday the first hour
[19:25] okay the tape was what was the holy
[19:28] ghost given
[19:29] for all the quotes that will be taken
[19:33] today is coming from the first
[19:35] hour of that message
[19:38] but i just wonder when we listen to a
[19:41] tape
[19:42] what we're really catching
[19:46] he said now last night he was referring
[19:47] to the night before
[19:49] last night we were speaking what it was
[19:51] what the holy ghost
[19:53] was and we found out in just about
[19:56] everything
[19:57] that god promised to us uh-huh in it we
[20:00] found that
[20:01] god it was for god's church it was what
[20:04] he
[20:05] what the church needed we found out it
[20:07] was the seal a comforter
[20:09] the rest the joy and the peace and the
[20:11] resurrection
[20:12] and all that god promised to his
[20:16] church now notice it was to the church
[20:22] not to my personal life
[20:25] right yes to the church
[20:28] lies within the holy spirit now i'm
[20:30] going to say some things that are going
[20:31] to stretch
[20:33] stretch what you think of the holy ghost
[20:35] but just be patient
[20:36] with me through it he says all my dear
[20:39] friends from around this country
[20:41] in this little city if i could get only
[20:43] with my human voice
[20:45] place into your heart the importance of
[20:48] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[20:50] it would be the most wonderful
[20:51] revelation that you've ever had
[20:53] in your life you to see he said to
[20:57] see you must do it amen
[21:00] so we have to our goal this morning is
[21:02] to try to get a better understanding of
[21:04] what the purpose
[21:05] of the holy ghost is and it takes a
[21:08] revelation i want to say today
[21:10] pray for revelation pray to receive
[21:14] not not to learn from my voice or my
[21:18] words but
[21:19] a revelation believe that you're here
[21:21] under the divine
[21:23] function of god that you've come here
[21:24] not on your own
[21:26] but the spirit inside of you led you
[21:28] here today
[21:30] for a purpose now the holy spirit is god
[21:34] the holy spirit is given to us to
[21:36] fulfill
[21:37] god's will in his church
[21:43] the holy ghost comforter is not for us
[21:49] it's not for our flesh right now we need
[21:52] it for a rapture and i've got some
[21:54] quotes again all these quotes are coming
[21:56] from there now we're going to show you
[21:58] after a while
[22:00] that there's those who are filled with
[22:02] the holy ghost
[22:03] goes into the rapture for the rest of
[22:05] the dead live not for a space of a
[22:07] thousand years that's right just
[22:09] holy spirit filled people was all that
[22:12] went into the rapture brother
[22:13] said in fact he says you're not
[22:17] converted
[22:18] until you receive the holy ghost
[22:22] he says you're believing on two
[22:26] so until that place you receive it
[22:28] you're believing unto the holy spirit
[22:30] has spoken to you
[22:31] and you've you publicly confessed him
[22:34] he says well the devil does the same
[22:36] thing i believe him to be the son of god
[22:39] so
[22:40] does the devil but you're walking on
[22:43] towards him now showing us the
[22:46] importance
[22:46] that the holy ghost is what this whole
[22:49] thing is about
[22:52] and yes the holy ghost will lead and
[22:55] guide us into all spiritual truth
[22:58] it will help us navigate through these
[23:01] life's issues
[23:02] and we benefit from having the holy
[23:04] ghost but the holy ghost
[23:06] isn't just for us
[23:11] now you've probably never heard a
[23:12] preacher say those words before
[23:15] that just happens to be how i am
[23:19] so why do we need the holy ghost well we
[23:21] need
[23:23] the holy ghost to make a rapture that's
[23:25] true
[23:29] because the bride will have the same
[23:31] spirit
[23:32] that the bridegroom has it'll have the
[23:35] same
[23:36] character that's why we need the holy
[23:38] ghost to make a rapture
[23:40] but it's not for us it's for christ
[23:44] we benefit from it but it's for christ
[23:49] christ loved and gave himself
[23:52] back right
[23:58] we already belonged to christ but he
[24:01] gave himself at calvary that he might
[24:04] buy back what already belonged
[24:06] to him amen
[24:10] he washes her with the word just like
[24:12] esther needed to be purified for the
[24:14] king ephesians 5
[24:16] verse 27 that he might present unto
[24:19] who himself a glorious church not even
[24:23] spot or wrinkle or any such thing
[24:24] but that it should be holy and without
[24:27] blemish
[24:30] so he washes the church and gives her
[24:33] the holy ghost
[24:34] for himself
[24:39] jesus said i have many things to say
[24:42] unto you
[24:42] but you cannot bear it but after the
[24:46] holy ghost comes
[24:48] see after he comes inside
[24:51] the love of god is shed abroad in their
[24:53] heart by the holy ghost
[24:55] great peace have they that love my word
[24:57] and nothing shall offend them
[24:59] when the holy ghost is inside god can
[25:02] have his way with dealing with our flesh
[25:04] but until the holy ghost comes inside
[25:07] it's
[25:09] you can't hardly god can't hardly deal
[25:11] with certain things
[25:15] the holy ghost has power to bear truth
[25:20] remember love the love of god
[25:23] beareth all things but remember my love
[25:27] it only goes so far you you just you
[25:30] you push my button
[25:34] and you know what the hammer is going to
[25:36] come down
[25:38] but not god's love so when we bear
[25:42] god's love we can bear the truth
[25:45] amen come on be with me now don't be
[25:48] making excuses
[25:52] in ourselves we cannot bear the facts of
[25:54] dying out
[25:56] of forgiven 7 times 70 for
[25:59] laying down our lives for the brethren
[26:02] living for others the way that god's
[26:04] spirit does
[26:08] so is the holy spirit for us
[26:13] god does not want us
[26:17] in our carnal flesh in heaven god does
[26:20] not
[26:21] want to be married to carnality
[26:25] god wants to be married to character
[26:29] he wants to be married to someone who's
[26:32] just like him
[26:34] amen so is the holy ghost for us
[26:39] think about it we're so used to it's
[26:42] about us it's about me
[26:44] it's for me but
[26:47] is it really for us
[26:52] the holy spirit is not merely for our
[26:54] personal purpose
[26:56] but for god's eternal purpose
[27:00] think about the new birth first
[27:01] corinthians chapter 12 verse 13 says for
[27:03] by one spirit
[27:05] were all baptized into one body
[27:09] john chapter 1 verse 13 which were born
[27:11] not of blood nor
[27:13] the uh nor the will of the flesh nor
[27:16] of the will of man but of
[27:19] god right we were born
[27:22] of the will of god we were born for him
[27:28] not for us when we are born again
[27:32] we are born again to his will
[27:36] in other words we no longer are doing
[27:37] our will
[27:39] but it's his will that's important
[27:41] second corinthians chapter 5
[27:43] verse 17 therefore if any man be in
[27:45] christ he is a new creature all things
[27:47] are passed away behold all things become
[27:49] new
[27:50] and all things are of god
[27:54] amen he's and he gives us a ministry of
[27:56] reconciliation
[27:58] so when we're born again a complete
[28:00] nature change
[28:01] by one holy spirit we're we're baptized
[28:05] into the body
[28:06] of christ for christ to do the will of
[28:10] christ
[28:14] brother branham said and what was the
[28:17] holy ghost given for he said what is it
[28:19] he said god working in
[28:22] you anywhere in the world that he
[28:26] he would want to call on you you're
[28:28] right there working in you
[28:31] to do his good will how we ought to
[28:34] thank god for that
[28:37] god the holy spirit is sent for the
[28:40] purpose
[28:41] of god living in this church moving
[28:44] through each age working out his
[28:48] divine will i wonder how many caught
[28:52] that when they were listening
[28:55] well that's just one isolated thing well
[28:56] that's why i got some more quotes for us
[28:58] today
[29:00] brother branham went on to say later and
[29:02] then
[29:03] he was made flesh and dwelt among us in
[29:06] order that he could come back
[29:08] again to man i'll tell you this this
[29:11] quote here is going to
[29:12] capture the whole message so please
[29:15] listen
[29:19] and then he was made flesh and dwelt
[29:21] among us in order that he could come
[29:23] back again to man and live in man
[29:25] and to restore a man to a state of
[29:28] communion with him again and to give
[29:30] him back his god-given right that he
[29:33] that's what he did he said that's the
[29:36] purpose of the holy ghost
[29:38] it's the father again god the father
[29:41] dwelling in you
[29:42] working out his plan to finish
[29:46] his plan of redemption working through
[29:50] you
[29:50] making you a co-worker with him giving
[29:53] you a place
[29:53] giving you a part for your fallen lost
[29:56] brother and sister
[29:57] giving you the holy spirit his love to
[29:59] go hunt the lost
[30:02] as he did in the garden of eden adam
[30:04] adam where art thou
[30:06] that's what the holy spirit does in a
[30:08] man or a woman when it strikes
[30:10] into their heart and takes a boat
[30:13] there's a thirst and a hungering for
[30:15] lost souls
[30:15] [Music]
[30:17] so tell me is the holy ghost for you
[30:22] that's what the matter with the meetings
[30:24] today there's not enough
[30:26] spirit touch in it to go for the souls
[30:28] of the lost in the dying
[30:30] it's more to make a name or a church or
[30:32] a building or a denomination and
[30:34] instead of a soul-winning program he
[30:36] said how pitiful
[30:38] we could stay on it much
[30:44] so i'm glad that's there because now i
[30:46] don't have to interpret
[30:48] how i'm supposed to feel when i get the
[30:50] holy ghost
[30:51] i don't have to interpret what the holy
[30:53] ghost for me does
[30:57] i know i gotta match that i've gotta
[31:00] match the book of acts
[31:03] many people visualize the comforter of
[31:06] the holy spirit
[31:07] as a comfort to help them with the
[31:10] affairs
[31:10] of this life is that true
[31:14] not realizing that isn't really what
[31:16] jesus was referring to and i want that
[31:18] to soak
[31:18] in jesus gave us the key when he
[31:22] told peter says after thou art converted
[31:25] strengthened thy brethren
[31:27] it was like a responsibility had nothing
[31:30] to do with him
[31:31] and all the problems he was going
[31:33] through the holy ghost
[31:36] was for the plan of redemption was
[31:39] helping
[31:40] out god's plan of redemption
[31:43] jesus had told his chosen disciples that
[31:46] he was going to be crucified
[31:49] what happened what happened
[31:55] their hearts began to get troubled he
[31:58] was leaving them they became full of
[32:01] sorrow
[32:02] and we might ask the question why would
[32:04] we
[32:05] would we visualize it would we imagine
[32:08] it the same way
[32:09] we would feel if we lost a loved one
[32:12] that our hearts was
[32:13] sorrowful and and and and and troubled
[32:16] at the situation
[32:19] remember they came to understand that
[32:22] the disciples they were not of this
[32:24] world
[32:26] and the only connection they had to the
[32:28] world that they were originally from was
[32:30] leaving them
[32:33] jesus was the one that told them said
[32:35] you're not of this world
[32:38] i'm not in this world you're not of this
[32:40] world we're from a different
[32:42] place he that fights with the sword dies
[32:46] with the sword
[32:47] so he made it clear and now the only
[32:53] connection to the world that they were
[32:56] going to was leaving them
[33:00] i think it was a a much greater
[33:04] connection there with that than anything
[33:12] he was the only one that had the words
[33:14] of eternal life
[33:15] and they were these words were leaving
[33:20] the comforter wasn't just for their
[33:23] troubles and fears
[33:26] he had already told them let not your
[33:27] heart be troubled
[33:29] he said in john chapter 14 27 he said
[33:32] peace i leave with you my peace i give
[33:36] unto you
[33:37] not as the world giveth give i unto you
[33:40] let not your heart be troubled neither
[33:42] let it be afraid so he had already
[33:44] given them peace he already told not
[33:46] your heart be troubled
[33:49] they didn't follow jesus for peace
[33:54] they didn't drop their nets for an
[33:55] easier life
[33:57] they didn't leave their professions for
[33:59] better money
[34:01] they left because jesus had the words of
[34:04] eternal life
[34:06] and they were called to fish out men out
[34:08] of this world
[34:09] so they could share the words of eternal
[34:11] life with them
[34:14] and now this eternal life was leaving
[34:18] them
[34:21] when jesus began to preach about harder
[34:24] things
[34:24] that believers needed to do the things
[34:28] that accompany salvation
[34:30] the things that strong meat belongs to
[34:33] them that are full
[34:34] age the bible says about receiving
[34:38] all of jesus that's a harder thing
[34:41] into their personal lives but
[34:44] they seemed like bones in the chicken
[34:49] or pits in the pie
[34:52] and they decided
[34:55] that they couldn't take
[34:58] that much of jesus
[35:02] in john chapter 6 verse 66 as we know
[35:06] brother john lafontaine said they took
[35:08] the mark of the beast
[35:11] it recalls from that time many of his
[35:14] disciples
[35:15] went back and walked no more with him
[35:18] now why is it that some people they'll
[35:21] come to jesus
[35:22] they'll get baptized they'll go so far
[35:25] and then they just stop
[35:28] they withdraw from continuing to walk
[35:31] forward
[35:32] they don't realize they're taking
[35:35] the mark of the beast
[35:40] we just sung it brother brother ron son
[35:43] the song
[35:44] if we don't walk in the light
[35:47] we're not going to go in the rapture
[35:50] we're going to miss it
[35:55] then said jesus unto the twelve will
[35:58] you also go away
[36:03] simon peter answered lord to whom shall
[36:05] we go for thou
[36:06] has the words of eternal life
[36:10] and we believe and are sure that thou
[36:12] art the christ the son of the living god
[36:14] now jesus was leaving them the words of
[36:17] eternal life
[36:18] was leaving them and i just want you to
[36:19] imagine this for a moment how would you
[36:22] feel if the only connection to eternal
[36:25] life was leaving
[36:26] you you just oh i'm gonna hop into
[36:27] another message church brother john
[36:31] think about it they didn't have another
[36:33] message church to go to
[36:40] john chapter 14 verse 5 thomas sayeth
[36:44] unto him
[36:44] lord we know not whether thou
[36:48] goest and how can we know the way
[36:51] and jesus saith unto him i am the way
[36:54] the truth the life
[36:55] and no man cometh to the father but by
[36:58] me
[36:58] and now the me was leaving them
[37:02] so how are they going to get connected
[37:05] how are they going to make it
[37:07] how are they going to get others that
[37:09] they were supposed to fish out of the
[37:11] world
[37:12] get them there
[37:16] yes the disciples were bothered
[37:20] about the fact and jesus told them that
[37:24] they're going to mock you and afflict
[37:27] you
[37:28] and crucify you and kick you out of the
[37:31] church
[37:33] they're even going to kill you thinking
[37:34] they're doing me a service and i'm sure
[37:37] those things bothered them
[37:40] but the disciples were also concerned
[37:42] about not knowing
[37:44] how they were going to make it without
[37:45] jesus being there
[37:50] because jesus had the words of eternal
[37:53] life
[37:55] these disciples did not have an
[37:58] overconfident attitude
[37:59] that they had enough i'm offered jesus
[38:03] enough
[38:04] or they knew it all or had enough
[38:06] experience with jesus
[38:11] no sir they were concerned and they
[38:12] realized they still
[38:14] needed jesus jesus dealing with their
[38:18] concern in in his own way he said in
[38:21] saint john chapter 16 verse number 6
[38:24] because i i said these things unto you
[38:26] sorrow
[38:28] has filled your heart nevertheless i
[38:30] tell you the truth is expedient if i go
[38:32] not away
[38:33] for if i go another way the comforter
[38:35] will not come out to you but if i depart
[38:37] i will send him
[38:38] unto you
[38:44] we need the holy ghost amen
[38:48] the holy ghost is just peace in the
[38:51] middle of a storm
[38:54] now since the day of pentecost
[38:58] what has the devil been trying to do
[39:01] since the day of pentecost
[39:04] he's doing everything he can to keep
[39:06] people from the holy ghost
[39:08] i can just imagine i can just see these
[39:11] devils and how having meetings trying to
[39:14] come up with ways
[39:15] to keep people from getting the holy
[39:17] ghost
[39:19] trying to form ways to achieve their
[39:21] objectives
[39:25] let's put the thoughts into the people's
[39:28] minds
[39:29] that it was only for the first 12
[39:32] disciples
[39:35] or it was just for the early church
[39:40] or how about this one it really doesn't
[39:42] exist
[39:45] see all these things will make somebody
[39:47] not seek after
[39:49] the holy ghost how about this one this
[39:52] is a big one
[39:53] they already have it let's put in their
[39:56] minds
[39:57] that they already have it because if you
[39:59] already have it
[40:02] why do i need to go look for my car keys
[40:06] if i already got them
[40:16] let's tell them that as soon as they
[40:18] speak in tongues they got it
[40:20] or they get baptized or they accept the
[40:23] message
[40:24] or that they believe
[40:29] he says we'll confuse them and get them
[40:31] so
[40:32] busy in the world that they won't even
[40:34] make time and if that don't work
[40:40] as as a as a final we'll relax them
[40:44] and give them so many pleasures that
[40:47] getting the holy ghost won't even enter
[40:48] in their minds
[40:51] why is it so hard for us to come into
[40:54] church
[40:55] and hunger for the holy ghost
[41:01] you don't got to be very spiritual to
[41:02] know what's going on
[41:06] the importance of getting the whole holy
[41:08] ghost is
[41:09] cannot be overemphasized brother branham
[41:11] said is the most
[41:13] wonderful revelation that you can ever
[41:14] have in your life we read that
[41:17] now if you don't have the holy ghost or
[41:21] you want more we got good news today
[41:26] doing what god tells you to do will give
[41:29] you the holy ghost
[41:31] acts chapter 5 verse 20 32 acts chapter
[41:34] 5 verse 32
[41:36] and we are his witnesses of these things
[41:39] and so is the holy ghost whom god have
[41:42] given to them
[41:43] that obey him so if you know god wants
[41:47] you to do
[41:48] something just do it just do it it
[41:51] doesn't matter
[41:52] how simple it is doesn't matter if it
[41:54] doesn't have anything to do with
[41:56] whatever you think is spiritual
[41:58] if god wants you to do something just do
[42:00] it
[42:01] because it opens the door for the holy
[42:03] ghost
[42:05] john chapter 14 verse 15 john chapter 14
[42:09] verse 15
[42:09] if you love me keep my commandments
[42:15] and i will pray the father and he shall
[42:17] give you another comforter isn't that
[42:18] something just kind of connected right
[42:20] there
[42:22] that he may abide with you forever even
[42:24] the spirit of truth whom the world
[42:26] cannot receive because it seeth him not
[42:28] neither knoweth him
[42:29] but ye know him how do you know him
[42:33] for he dwelt with you and shall be in
[42:36] you
[42:37] i will not leave you comfortless
[42:41] i will come to you
[42:45] the comforter is the spirit of truth
[42:49] john chapter 14 verse 26 the comforter
[42:52] which is the holy ghost
[42:53] whom the father will send in my name he
[42:55] will teach you
[42:56] all things and bring all things to your
[42:58] remembrance whatsoever
[43:02] i have said unto you
[43:08] jesus explains in a very simple way
[43:11] to help us understand the workings of
[43:14] the holy spirit
[43:15] inside of a human being and how it
[43:18] happens and it's
[43:19] it's hid i believe in john chapter 14
[43:21] verse 26
[43:23] john chapter 14 uh verse 20 i mean
[43:26] john chapter 14 verse 20 at that day ye
[43:29] shall know that i am in the father and
[43:31] you and me and i and you
[43:33] now that can be you know a little
[43:35] complex because
[43:36] we're used to saying either the water's
[43:38] in this bottle where it's not right
[43:41] he that hath my commandments now notice
[43:44] and keepeth them
[43:46] he it is that love with me and he that
[43:48] loveth me shall be loved of my father
[43:49] and i will love him and will manifest
[43:52] myself
[43:52] to him so if you want revelation be real
[43:54] serious
[43:55] about keeping god's commandments
[43:59] if you want to pick and choose you want
[44:00] to have a smorgasbord every time you
[44:02] come to church
[44:02] you're going to take what you want you
[44:04] don't realize that you are
[44:06] identifying the relationship that you
[44:08] have with god
[44:11] now judas saith unto him not iscariot
[44:13] lord
[44:15] how is it that thou will manifest
[44:16] thyself to us
[44:18] and not to others
[44:21] not to others because they were staring
[44:24] at jesus as one man
[44:27] and now it's going to be an invisible
[44:30] thing
[44:31] right can god cometh without observation
[44:34] jesus answered and said on him if a man
[44:37] loved me
[44:38] if a man loved me there's the there's
[44:40] the crutch right there
[44:42] he will keep my words and my father will
[44:44] love him
[44:45] and we will come unto him and make our
[44:47] bold with him now that's
[44:48] the comforter coming inside of a human
[44:50] being it can't get any more simpler than
[44:52] that
[44:54] because you know when we stare at acts
[44:57] chapter 2 38 repent be baptized every
[44:59] one of you in the name of the lord jesus
[45:00] christ remission
[45:01] and you shall receive the gift of the
[45:02] holy ghost it doesn't say anything about
[45:03] obeying
[45:05] it doesn't say anything about keeping
[45:06] the commandments but that's what it
[45:08] really means to believe
[45:10] what it really means to what it means to
[45:12] turn around
[45:14] that's why we got to search the
[45:16] scriptures amen right
[45:19] it's so simple that it goes over the
[45:21] heads of the majority
[45:22] but god is hidden in simplicity
[45:26] in this modern day they would write a
[45:28] book and say
[45:30] how to receive the holy ghost for
[45:31] dummies
[45:35] we just need to get more serious about
[45:37] the word
[45:39] brother branham talked in that that
[45:42] message that we listened to
[45:43] about getting into prayer he talked
[45:47] about those that had the holy ghost
[45:49] ought to be concerned about for those
[45:50] that didn't and to pray with those that
[45:53] didn't
[45:55] well he didn't say just the
[45:59] it's true pastors that claim they got
[46:00] the holy ghost ought to be interested in
[46:02] those that don't have it and to get with
[46:04] them and pray
[46:07] that's that's old-fashioned that's
[46:09] old-fashioned
[46:10] but people need to be taught how to get
[46:12] the holy ghost
[46:15] john chapter 15 gives us a a visual of
[46:18] what it means to
[46:19] abide in christ he said i'm the vine you
[46:21] are the branches
[46:23] and jesus gives us a responsibility in
[46:26] that chapter to do our part
[46:28] by keeping abiding in him
[46:32] we have to be willing to continue to
[46:35] abide
[46:36] in other words our will can separate the
[46:38] abiding
[46:40] our desire to do what we want to do
[46:42] instead of what god wants to do
[46:44] can stop the abiding now once the
[46:45] abiding stops the joy stops
[46:49] because you know i'm going to tell you
[46:52] me
[46:53] our flesh our joy only goes so far
[46:59] if i was an entertainer or a comedian
[47:03] if i was tim hawkins if i could
[47:07] entertain for you and make you laugh
[47:10] enjoy
[47:11] it would last such a short time
[47:15] as soon as it was over and your thoughts
[47:18] were done you started with
[47:19] life well we'd start to get unhappy and
[47:22] long
[47:23] faces and but the joy of the lord
[47:28] it abides as long as you're abiding in
[47:31] the word
[47:32] in the last word he gave you r
[47:39] amen amen
[47:42] later in the chapter 15 verse number 26
[47:45] but when
[47:47] the comforter is come whom i will send
[47:50] to my fathers
[47:52] sent unto you from the father even the
[47:54] spirit of truth which proceedeth
[47:55] from the father he shall testify in me
[47:58] and ye
[47:59] shall bear and ye also shall bear
[48:02] wetness
[48:02] he and ye shall also bear witness
[48:05] because he
[48:06] had been with me from the beginning
[48:10] i think that's why it's important for us
[48:11] to know the nature of god
[48:15] amen chapter 16 verse 7
[48:19] a worse there's a lot of scripture i
[48:22] know but i just want you to catch the
[48:24] point you can go back and study any time
[48:27] saint john chapter 16 verse 7
[48:29] nevertheless i tell you the truth is
[48:30] exceeding it for you that i go away if i
[48:32] go no
[48:32] way the comforter will not come but if i
[48:33] depart i will send them unto you and
[48:35] when he's come
[48:36] he will reprove the world of sin the
[48:38] righteousness of judgment
[48:40] of sin because they believe not on me of
[48:43] righteous because i go to the father
[48:45] you should see me no more of judgment
[48:46] because the prince of the world is
[48:48] judged
[48:49] i have yet many things to say to you but
[48:50] you cannot bear it now albeit when this
[48:52] fair truth has come he will guide you
[48:54] into all truth he shall
[48:55] speak of not of himself but whatsoever
[48:58] he shall hear that shall he speak and he
[48:59] will show you things to come
[49:01] so the work of the comforter or the holy
[49:04] ghost
[49:05] is to reprove us
[49:09] it's not the job is not to reprove
[49:12] the world but the world inside of us
[49:19] we don't need to get out there and find
[49:21] a newspaper that we can tell the world
[49:22] how bad it is
[49:27] but god sees things in us that are bad
[49:30] it's called the world and the job of the
[49:33] comforter
[49:33] is to reprove those worldly things
[49:36] inside of us
[49:37] the way we think about our lives how
[49:40] we're supposed to live our lives
[49:43] the comforter leads and guides us into
[49:45] transforming
[49:46] our minds into the mind of christ to
[49:49] think the way that christ
[49:51] thought paul said let this mind be in
[49:54] you which was also in christ jesus
[49:57] just think about this he made himself of
[49:59] no reputation
[50:00] and he took upon him the form of a
[50:02] servant
[50:04] now this is the working of the holy
[50:06] ghost
[50:09] philippians chapter 2 verse number 2 he
[50:11] said fulfill ye my joy
[50:13] that you be like-minded having the same
[50:15] love
[50:16] being of one accord of one of mine let
[50:19] nothing be done through strife or
[50:20] vainglory
[50:21] but in loneliness of mine let each
[50:23] esteem the other better than themselves
[50:25] so it takes a lot for a person
[50:27] to actually want somebody else to be
[50:29] blessed
[50:30] more than yourself it's a different
[50:33] spirit
[50:36] let not every uh okay look not every man
[50:39] on his own things
[50:40] hey look on my stuff
[50:44] no but every man also on the things of
[50:46] others
[50:48] let this mind be in you which was also
[50:50] in christ jesus
[50:51] now this is such a very
[50:55] this is what the holy ghost is god the
[50:57] holy ghost in you is the mind of god in
[51:00] you
[51:02] it's this is not something that we you
[51:04] know we try to do on ourselves to become
[51:06] more interested in others
[51:09] this is what happens when we do let go
[51:12] and let god have his way
[51:14] this is the way that he will have he
[51:15] will not have a different way
[51:18] it will be this way the word way
[51:22] now the comfort of the holy spirit leads
[51:24] us
[51:25] into all truth the bible says that jesus
[51:29] christ
[51:29] is the truth so let the mind of truth
[51:33] be in you the mind of christ will always
[51:36] lead us into more truth and will always
[51:39] be using us
[51:40] to lead others into more truth because
[51:43] that's who christ
[51:44] is well brother john that ain't going to
[51:46] leave much time for my life
[51:53] use me lord
[51:56] lord don't use me that much
[52:00] think about it think about it
[52:04] some of us we'd have to have a big
[52:07] meteorite come down in our yard to say
[52:09] oh lord you're trying to speak to me
[52:12] the word is already calling us
[52:18] if you ever want to know what happens to
[52:20] a person who gets filled with the holy
[52:21] ghost
[52:22] read the book of acts
[52:25] the book of acts describes or narrates
[52:28] how
[52:28] the holy ghost acts acts in a human
[52:32] being
[52:34] so if you ever want to know how the holy
[52:36] spirit works
[52:37] leads guides or keeps us read the book
[52:41] of acts
[52:42] now the minds of the disciples
[52:44] drastically
[52:45] changed in the book of acts
[52:49] from the four gospels to the book of
[52:51] acts
[52:52] their minds drastically changed
[52:55] from being a selfish coward
[53:00] into a selfless and bold way
[53:03] of laying down their life for jesus
[53:05] christ
[53:05] [Applause]
[53:07] the holy ghost transformed them into
[53:09] another
[53:10] way of thinking they began thinking like
[53:13] jesus did
[53:15] jesus laid down his life they began to
[53:18] lay down their life
[53:19] they began to unite with carrying out
[53:22] the the plan of redemption the purpose
[53:26] of why god gave them the holy ghost
[53:30] shortly after the disciples had received
[53:32] the holy ghost in the upper room the
[53:33] comforter led them
[53:34] to preach the gospel and many signs and
[53:38] wonders began to be
[53:39] performed just pick up with me in acts
[53:42] chapter 5 verse 14
[53:44] and believers were the more added to the
[53:47] lord
[53:48] multitudes of both men and women in so
[53:50] much that they brought
[53:51] forth the sick and into the streets and
[53:53] laid them on
[53:54] beds and couches that at the least
[53:58] the shallow peter passing by might
[54:00] overshadow
[54:01] some of them they came
[54:04] there came also multitudes of the city
[54:06] round about
[54:08] unto jerusalem bringing sick folks and
[54:10] them that were
[54:11] vexed and unclean spirits and they
[54:12] healed everyone
[54:14] and the high priest rose up and all they
[54:17] that were with him
[54:18] which is of the sect of the sad you see
[54:22] and were filled with indignation
[54:26] and they laid their hands on the
[54:28] apostles
[54:29] and put them into the common prisons
[54:32] now that's a very sad situation
[54:37] now some modern 21st century new age
[54:40] believers
[54:41] would have questioned such persecutions
[54:43] happening to them
[54:45] perhaps they would have thought maybe we
[54:47] overdid it
[54:48] maybe we were over zealous maybe
[54:52] we were just you know pushing the gospel
[54:54] too much
[54:56] maybe we should have been a little bit
[54:57] more secretive about our beliefs
[55:01] maybe jesus really didn't want us to put
[55:04] uh a light
[55:07] uh out on the table maybe he really
[55:10] wanted us
[55:10] maybe we misunderstood maybe he thought
[55:13] maybe he wanted us to put our light
[55:15] under a bushel
[55:18] because his persecutions coming maybe
[55:21] jesus didn't understand what he was
[55:22] saying
[55:24] maybe jesus really didn't want them to
[55:26] preach it from the house stop
[55:28] maybe he meant to say basement
[55:32] maybe the comforter was trying to lead
[55:34] us to be more careful
[55:36] about who we talked to about jesus
[55:45] we know how peter responded
[55:48] when before he got the holy ghost
[55:51] he was so sheepish and
[55:55] coward denying that he was a christian
[55:58] in front of others
[56:01] verse 19 but the angel
[56:04] of the lord by night opened the prison
[56:07] doors and brought them forth and said
[56:09] go run for your lives
[56:12] you're free go go go
[56:16] no no he said go
[56:20] stand and speak in the temple
[56:23] to the people all the words
[56:26] of this eternal life
[56:31] so what's the holy ghost for
[56:37] the comforter was to hold them while
[56:39] they went through
[56:40] all the things that the spirit was
[56:42] leading them to do
[56:44] it has power to keep you
[56:49] the comforter held them while they
[56:51] further
[56:52] carried out the ministry of jesus or
[56:55] this great
[56:56] plan of jehovah's redemption
[57:00] amen one time they asked brother branham
[57:03] when he lost his daughter and his wife
[57:05] he says
[57:06] did you keep your religion he said
[57:09] no it kept me
[57:13] the purpose of the holy ghost is to keep
[57:16] you
[57:17] it doesn't keep you away from problems
[57:20] and trials and
[57:21] making mistakes brother branham made
[57:23] them you made them i made them
[57:25] we'll probably be making until we're out
[57:27] of here but the holy ghost will keep you
[57:32] the comforter will keep you whatever
[57:35] he wants you to do and wherever he leads
[57:38] you to do if
[57:39] he will keep you one day the comforter
[57:42] was guiding paul and silas into truth
[57:45] of doing god's will in acts chapter 16
[57:47] and while the spirit led them to pray
[57:51] a person with a religious spirit began
[57:53] to follow them saying
[57:55] these men are the servants of the most
[57:57] high god
[57:58] and show unto us the way of salvation
[58:02] now you might have thought this free
[58:03] advertisement would have been good for
[58:05] his campaign
[58:07] but after many days it grieved paul
[58:10] see there's some i think if they would
[58:11] have did it one time
[58:13] but it just kept on doing it paul knew
[58:17] something was wrong he was grieved in
[58:18] his spirit and he
[58:19] turned and said to the spirit i command
[58:23] thee in the name of jesus christ to come
[58:24] out of her
[58:25] and he came out the same hour
[58:31] now because of casting out religious
[58:33] demons
[58:35] the persecution started
[58:38] they were falsely accused they were
[58:40] threatened because of it they were
[58:41] beaten with many stripes
[58:43] they were cast into the inner prison you
[58:44] can read it in acts chapter 16
[58:46] they were chained to the floor and they
[58:49] were watched
[58:50] closely by a jailer
[58:53] do you think they were second guessing
[58:55] the leadership of the comforter
[58:58] think about what they went through
[59:02] sometimes we have a little something
[59:03] happen all sudden we just get all scared
[59:05] bend out of shape
[59:09] do you think they were questioning the
[59:10] spirit guiding them into all truth of
[59:13] this situation
[59:16] do you think they were whining and
[59:18] crying about
[59:19] what was seen to be so unfair i was just
[59:22] trying to tell them the truth and now
[59:23] look
[59:25] that's really good no sir
[59:28] the comforter will not lead you will it
[59:30] will not keep you
[59:36] so if i ain't keeping you think about
[59:38] what's guiding you
[59:42] in the middle of the night they agreed
[59:45] together in
[59:46] prayer and you know what they began to
[59:47] praise god
[59:50] that's what the comforter is for
[59:53] to be able to stand the persecution
[59:56] while god
[59:57] uses you to save a jail a jailer
[1:00:00] amen you know
[1:00:04] god could have led that jailer to come
[1:00:07] to one of paul's bible studies
[1:00:11] but that ain't what he did he sent paul
[1:00:13] to prison to save them
[1:00:15] amen and
[1:00:18] as he was working out the redemption of
[1:00:21] god's great
[1:00:21] plan for this paul needed the holy ghost
[1:00:25] to know to stand
[1:00:26] all the junk that he had to go through
[1:00:29] because it ain't normal for a human
[1:00:30] being to start praising god for being
[1:00:33] whipped and chained and thrown into
[1:00:34] prison
[1:00:35] you know someone don't shake our hand we
[1:00:37] get offended and start huffing and
[1:00:39] puffing and thinking about it
[1:00:41] and you know what is that why they do
[1:00:43] that
[1:00:45] what is going on what spirit is inside
[1:00:48] of us
[1:00:51] it ain't us building a church god is
[1:00:53] building the church
[1:00:54] and we need to be about the father's
[1:00:56] business
[1:01:02] the holy ghost was leading and guiding
[1:01:05] paul but he never knew
[1:01:07] what was going to happen
[1:01:11] i'll get to it just like moses
[1:01:15] i don't the bible doesn't say moses knew
[1:01:18] that the
[1:01:19] female servants were going to do the
[1:01:21] same thing that he did
[1:01:24] look about abraham abraham went out not
[1:01:27] knowing where he was going but he was
[1:01:28] blood of god
[1:01:30] look at aaron and elizabeth
[1:01:34] perfect example
[1:01:37] leading but not knowing what's going to
[1:01:39] happen
[1:01:41] god led brother johnson to ann arbor and
[1:01:43] he didn't even know where it was on the
[1:01:45] pla on
[1:01:45] the map
[1:01:50] brother branham was led to pray for a
[1:01:52] lost boy whose mother had prayed all
[1:01:54] night for
[1:01:55] and he didn't know what was going on
[1:02:00] remember when they had that trap set
[1:02:04] the chicago minister association had a
[1:02:08] trap set for him
[1:02:11] and as soon as brother random found out
[1:02:13] his first reaction he told
[1:02:15] the holy ghost he says okay i won't go
[1:02:17] then
[1:02:18] and the holy ghost said no you will go
[1:02:24] see the holy ghost don't keep you from a
[1:02:26] problem
[1:02:29] it keeps you through the problem
[1:02:34] god wanted brother ram to be a witness
[1:02:38] in the face of all those demons
[1:02:41] who did not believe the full gospel
[1:02:45] they only believed part of it
[1:02:52] he stood there not in the offense of the
[1:02:55] gospel
[1:02:56] but he's still there in the defense of
[1:02:57] the gospel
[1:03:00] and he's he knew everybody was sitting
[1:03:06] i love what tommy hicks said he said you
[1:03:09] may not disagree
[1:03:10] you may not agree with this man but i
[1:03:12] tell you
[1:03:13] he's fearless in what he believes
[1:03:16] that's what the holy ghost he says look
[1:03:18] i'm not you know
[1:03:20] come i want somebody to come up here
[1:03:22] with their bible
[1:03:24] prove me wrong don't bring your your own
[1:03:27] thoughts
[1:03:29] your own ideas about the message bring
[1:03:32] the bible
[1:03:34] no one would come all right bring your
[1:03:38] committee
[1:03:39] bring your ban your your board come up
[1:03:41] here as a group
[1:03:43] maybe you're too afraid
[1:03:47] he said not a one move
[1:03:52] what is the holy ghost for
[1:03:57] the holy ghost isn't for us personally
[1:04:01] it's for god to fulfill his purpose
[1:04:04] because it is god
[1:04:05] in you it's not a christmas gift for you
[1:04:08] to do what you want to do with it
[1:04:15] i'll never forget driving down the road
[1:04:17] when the holy spirit said you're gonna
[1:04:19] have a business there
[1:04:21] to this day i walk into the shop and i
[1:04:24] don't feel i own a piece of it
[1:04:27] but you know i feel like i feel like i
[1:04:29] got a weight
[1:04:31] of responsibility to keep things in
[1:04:33] order to make sure god is first
[1:04:38] i don't feel he gave it to me from me
[1:04:51] i didn't understand a burden
[1:04:56] that was on my heart to minister when i
[1:04:58] could not stand the thought
[1:05:00] of standing in front of people
[1:05:03] and anybody that ever knew me before
[1:05:06] being a minister would agree that man
[1:05:09] will
[1:05:09] never preach it's the truth
[1:05:15] a lot of times you see when i'm singing
[1:05:18] i don't even look at you
[1:05:23] i'm just not interested in being up here
[1:05:27] i so bad i want you to have the word
[1:05:28] that's so bad i want you to have a
[1:05:30] relationship with jesus
[1:05:32] that means so much to me so what i did
[1:05:35] to battle that fear put on my computer
[1:05:37] and some of you know this
[1:05:39] your love to help people needs to be
[1:05:40] greater than your fear of failing
[1:05:43] [Music]
[1:05:45] that's what the holy ghost is for
[1:05:49] god is always leading his people to
[1:05:51] fulfill his purpose
[1:05:54] they are they that are sons of god are
[1:05:56] led by the spirit of god
[1:05:59] god works out all things after the
[1:06:01] counsel
[1:06:02] of his will to fulfill his eternal
[1:06:04] purpose
[1:06:06] so the purpose of the holy ghost is to
[1:06:08] fulfill god's will
[1:06:10] and his eternal purpose not your
[1:06:13] temporary will that you want right now
[1:06:18] why this message is not going to be real
[1:06:19] flowery to the flesh
[1:06:22] but we need to know why god has given us
[1:06:24] the holy ghost
[1:06:28] so paul goes bound in the spirit unto
[1:06:30] jerusalem not knowing the things that
[1:06:31] shall
[1:06:32] befall him there and in acts chapter 20
[1:06:34] verse 23
[1:06:36] save the holy spirit witness in every
[1:06:39] city saying bonds
[1:06:40] and afflictions abide me
[1:06:44] he said but none of these things move me
[1:06:48] neither count i my life dear unto myself
[1:06:51] just thinking about the song that
[1:06:53] sister elizabeth saying you know if
[1:06:56] you're going to give your life to jesus
[1:06:59] you don't count your life dear to
[1:07:01] yourself
[1:07:03] but if you don't give your life to jesus
[1:07:06] you're holding back
[1:07:07] that means you count your life dear
[1:07:10] he says that i might finish my course
[1:07:12] with joy and the ministry remember
[1:07:15] he gives us a ministry after receiving
[1:07:16] the holy ghost which i have received to
[1:07:19] the lord jesus to testify
[1:07:20] the gospel of the grace of god the
[1:07:23] comforter
[1:07:24] was leading and guiding paul into the
[1:07:27] truth of
[1:07:28] what god wanted him to do not just
[1:07:31] the doctrine the truth and what to carry
[1:07:35] out in his life
[1:07:38] and the comforter was there with joy and
[1:07:40] peace
[1:07:41] as he went through his afflictions doing
[1:07:44] it
[1:07:46] see this this whole concept of this the
[1:07:49] holy ghost is for me and
[1:07:50] just all about me no it's not all about
[1:07:54] you
[1:07:57] acts chapter 21 verse 10 and as we
[1:08:00] tarried there many days there came from
[1:08:05] judah a certain prophet named agabus
[1:08:09] and when he was come unto us he took
[1:08:11] paul's girdle and bound it in his own
[1:08:12] hands and feet and said
[1:08:14] thus sayeth the holy ghost notice who's
[1:08:17] speaking here it's it's
[1:08:18] it wasn't egg of us it was god
[1:08:22] so shall the jews at jerusalem bind the
[1:08:24] man that owned this girdle
[1:08:25] and shall deliver him to the hands of
[1:08:27] the gentiles now why would god say that
[1:08:30] you know that's our god
[1:08:36] god is going to put us through things
[1:08:39] not because he wants us to suffer
[1:08:42] because we have to go through those
[1:08:44] things to save somebody to be a witness
[1:08:47] at jerusalem or somewhere in our life
[1:08:52] and when we heard these things both we
[1:08:54] in the
[1:08:55] and they that of that place besought him
[1:08:58] not to go
[1:08:58] up to jerusalem see now that's the
[1:09:00] natural thing if you know you're going
[1:09:02] to suffer don't do it
[1:09:04] but if you're filled with the holy ghost
[1:09:06] this is how paul answered
[1:09:08] what meaneth ye to weep
[1:09:12] you know you're breaking my heart acting
[1:09:14] like this
[1:09:16] for i am ready not to be bound only
[1:09:20] but also to die if i have to jerusalem
[1:09:22] for the name of the lord jesus
[1:09:24] you you now that was a real a real
[1:09:28] manifestation
[1:09:29] to me that his life was not dear unto
[1:09:31] him if he was willing to give his life
[1:09:36] and when we would and when he would not
[1:09:38] be persuaded
[1:09:40] we just quit and we said the will
[1:09:43] of the lord be taught think about that
[1:09:46] the will of the lord the will of the
[1:09:48] holy ghost it was
[1:09:50] not for paul's comfort
[1:09:54] it's so paul could carry out the will of
[1:09:57] god
[1:10:01] hey paul could have went and just
[1:10:05] built tents made a decent living
[1:10:09] stayed away from the persecution kind of
[1:10:12] live his own life
[1:10:14] maybe go to peter's church let him be
[1:10:17] the pastor
[1:10:21] they asked him to be a deacon he'd say
[1:10:23] no i don't really want to be
[1:10:26] well can you at least take no i don't
[1:10:28] want to take up the offering
[1:10:30] would you at least clean the church paul
[1:10:31] no i just has too much responsibility
[1:10:36] yes yes yes i will preach i will preach
[1:10:39] till there's nobody to preach to
[1:10:43] because satan wants to get in and have
[1:10:45] this whole thing about just
[1:10:47] us and god that's right
[1:10:51] we all look at the comforters being
[1:10:53] there to comfort us in our personalized
[1:10:55] our personal situations
[1:10:57] i want you to imagine for a moment peter
[1:11:00] was filled with the holy ghost when they
[1:11:01] came and they
[1:11:02] took jesus away to be crucified
[1:11:09] would we imagine peter's being comforted
[1:11:15] oh it's okay
[1:11:18] is that the purpose of the holy ghost
[1:11:22] how about after peter denies
[1:11:26] jesus let's imagine that he's got the
[1:11:28] holy ghost
[1:11:31] would we imagine the holy ghost
[1:11:33] comforting him saying
[1:11:35] well it's going to be all right
[1:11:38] no we want wouldn't how about when they
[1:11:41] they came
[1:11:42] to get jesus
[1:11:45] and he was filled with the holy ghost
[1:11:47] and jesus just let him take the sword
[1:11:49] draw the sword out and start you know
[1:11:52] killing everybody physically
[1:11:56] i don't think jesus or
[1:11:59] peter would have went away being scared
[1:12:03] because he was so physically psyched up
[1:12:08] just the wrong spirit
[1:12:12] because see peter was not called to the
[1:12:14] offense of the gospel
[1:12:17] but to the defense of the gospel
[1:12:21] he was called to be a servant a lamb
[1:12:24] to lay down his life for his brother not
[1:12:26] prove who's right
[1:12:33] so what is the reason god sent the holy
[1:12:35] ghost the spirit of truth the comforter
[1:12:39] the reasons that jesus gave us was to
[1:12:41] reprove the world out of our lives
[1:12:43] to lead us into righteousness to guide
[1:12:45] us into all truth
[1:12:46] to give us power to become a proper
[1:12:49] witness
[1:12:50] so we don't get offended
[1:12:54] they don't whine and complain because of
[1:12:56] a fiction afflictions
[1:12:58] or things are too hard or somebody did
[1:13:01] us wrong or
[1:13:02] or began to persecute us or or drew us
[1:13:04] out of their circle
[1:13:09] the holy ghost just draws a bigger
[1:13:10] circle
[1:13:12] i'm so sick of drawing circles
[1:13:15] i am too but you know what god gotti
[1:13:19] he endureth and about
[1:13:22] he endures all things he bears all
[1:13:24] things he just keeps going
[1:13:25] his love for you has not diminished
[1:13:28] since the day you gave your life to
[1:13:29] jesus christ
[1:13:31] but why do we have thoughts about how
[1:13:33] far we're going to go with somebody
[1:13:35] because it's you and it's not god in you
[1:13:38] speaking
[1:13:39] but you don't realize it
[1:13:42] holy ghost is not about you
[1:13:47] afflictions and persecutions will always
[1:13:49] follow a believer
[1:13:51] who takes a stand to reach out for souls
[1:13:55] paul told timothy straight up in second
[1:13:58] timothy chapter 1 verse 7 for
[1:14:00] god have not given us a spirit of fear
[1:14:02] but
[1:14:03] power and love and a sound mind
[1:14:07] and so look he's in prison now and he's
[1:14:10] inviting
[1:14:11] timothy be not thou therefore
[1:14:14] ashamed of the testimony of our lord
[1:14:18] what testimony is that that you're going
[1:14:19] to suffer that you're going to suffer
[1:14:22] if you really get filled with god
[1:14:26] nor of me is prisoner but be thou a
[1:14:29] partaker
[1:14:30] of the gospel amen a partaker of the
[1:14:34] gospel
[1:14:34] according to the power of god according
[1:14:37] to the power
[1:14:38] of the holy spirit you shall receive
[1:14:40] power after the holy ghost
[1:14:42] has come upon you and you shall be
[1:14:43] witnesses unto me
[1:14:46] that's what the holy ghost is for
[1:14:49] and paul tells timothy about the
[1:14:51] perilous times that are coming
[1:14:54] basically in the day that we're living
[1:14:56] in that church-going people
[1:14:59] would be lovers of their own self
[1:15:03] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[1:15:04] god while
[1:15:06] maintaining some sort of form of
[1:15:08] godliness
[1:15:11] come on now we should not be stopping
[1:15:13] saying amen let's say amen to the word
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:16] yet they have no power they have no
[1:15:19] spiritual strength
[1:15:20] for what to deny their flesh
[1:15:24] to lay down their lives no they don't
[1:15:26] have to
[1:15:28] they covet things they're proud they're
[1:15:29] boastful they're unthankful people
[1:15:31] heady high-minded fierce
[1:15:35] false accusers of others
[1:15:39] they're simply in love with themselves
[1:15:41] instead of in love
[1:15:43] with the souls of others
[1:15:46] paul said you better you better turn
[1:15:48] away from that kind of spirit
[1:15:52] paul identifies these people as men of
[1:15:54] corrupt minds
[1:15:55] ever learning and never able to come to
[1:15:57] the knowledge of the truth
[1:16:00] in other words they resist the truth the
[1:16:03] truth
[1:16:03] that they should be denying their flesh
[1:16:05] and laying down their lives for another
[1:16:07] soul
[1:16:10] in other words they're going to have
[1:16:13] they're going to serve god on this side
[1:16:14] of
[1:16:15] jordan they're going to go to
[1:16:18] have their own little denomination
[1:16:25] paul did not want timothy to be
[1:16:27] persuaded of taking
[1:16:29] an easier path and still call it
[1:16:31] christianity
[1:16:32] he said but be thou a partaker of the
[1:16:35] afflictions
[1:16:36] and the gospel according to the power of
[1:16:37] god we need
[1:16:40] the holy ghost that's the answer when
[1:16:41] we're staring at oh i gotta partake
[1:16:43] of afflictions oh that's not exciting
[1:16:46] i'm not interested in that i want a
[1:16:47] different gospel
[1:16:48] what we need is the gospel of the holy
[1:16:50] ghost so we can do that
[1:16:58] the spirit of this world inside the
[1:17:01] church
[1:17:02] is against the revealed truth of the
[1:17:04] hour
[1:17:05] i want you to think about that the
[1:17:07] spirit of this world that's inside the
[1:17:10] church
[1:17:11] is against the revealed truth of the
[1:17:13] hour now
[1:17:15] your intent of loving god loving the
[1:17:17] word becoming the word
[1:17:20] is just as real as real can be but
[1:17:22] remember
[1:17:23] the spirit of this world is against the
[1:17:26] spirit
[1:17:27] of the revealed truth of this message
[1:17:30] that's trying to meet the bride you
[1:17:33] believe that
[1:17:34] it is so no understand when things are
[1:17:37] happening inside of here and you're not
[1:17:38] liking or agreeing what's being said you
[1:17:40] need to recognize
[1:17:42] that ain't the holy
[1:17:46] brother branham said for when god made
[1:17:49] himself known to christ
[1:17:51] they hated him who hated him the worst
[1:17:54] the church
[1:17:56] the church hated him the worst they
[1:17:58] hated him worse
[1:17:59] than a the drunkard
[1:18:02] you know some people get along with
[1:18:05] drunks
[1:18:08] better why the drunk isn't going to give
[1:18:10] you any conviction
[1:18:12] is that going to give you a hard time
[1:18:16] they hated him worse than all the other
[1:18:18] people it was the church
[1:18:19] that hated him so anytime
[1:18:23] you feel a hate towards what's being
[1:18:25] spoken
[1:18:26] i don't take it personally
[1:18:30] because it's the spirit of the world
[1:18:31] that's inside of you that's hating the
[1:18:33] revealed truth
[1:18:34] that's coming out of this vessel it's
[1:18:37] not a popularity concert a concert
[1:18:41] contest they both start with a c
[1:18:46] second timothy chapter 3 verse 10 but
[1:18:48] thou has fully known my doctrine my
[1:18:50] manner of life my purpose
[1:18:52] my faith my long suffering my charity my
[1:18:54] patience persecutions and afflictions
[1:18:56] which came up to me in antioch iconium
[1:18:58] lystra
[1:18:59] what persecutions i endured but out of
[1:19:01] them all
[1:19:02] the lord delivered me there's the
[1:19:05] difference
[1:19:06] you know god's going to take care of you
[1:19:10] yeah and all that live godly in christ
[1:19:11] jesus shall suffer persecution
[1:19:13] but evil men and seduce yourself worse
[1:19:15] worse shall wax worse and worse
[1:19:17] deceiving and being deceived
[1:19:19] but continue down the things which thou
[1:19:21] has learned and has been assured of
[1:19:23] knowing of who thou has learned them
[1:19:26] stay
[1:19:27] with the bible stay with the message of
[1:19:30] the hour
[1:19:32] so what is the holy ghost for
[1:19:35] colossians chapter 1 verse 16
[1:19:40] for by him were all things created
[1:19:43] that are in heaven that are on earth
[1:19:45] visible and invisible whether they be
[1:19:46] thrones dominions principalities or
[1:19:48] powers
[1:19:49] all things were created by him
[1:19:52] and the most important for him
[1:19:57] so we were created for god god gives you
[1:20:00] the holy ghost for him
[1:20:04] and he is before all things and by him
[1:20:06] all things consist and he is the head of
[1:20:08] the body
[1:20:09] the church who is the beginning the
[1:20:11] firstborn of the dead that
[1:20:12] in all things that in the church
[1:20:16] that in your church in this church
[1:20:21] that in all things he might have
[1:20:24] the preeminence without the holy ghost
[1:20:28] you won't give god the time of day
[1:20:33] you're going to do your own thing with
[1:20:35] the holy ghost god's got control
[1:20:39] he takes preeminence in your life
[1:20:42] brother
[1:20:42] i'm saying them in that message with the
[1:20:45] holy ghost
[1:20:46] for christ poured himself into the
[1:20:48] church therefore now watch
[1:20:50] at that day quoting jesus you will know
[1:20:53] that i am in the father
[1:20:55] and you are in me and i in you at
[1:20:58] that day you'll know it for it's the
[1:21:01] whole thing in the
[1:21:03] in one plan of redemption
[1:21:06] coming down at that day you're gonna
[1:21:10] know i'm in you
[1:21:11] it's about the whole plan of redemption
[1:21:14] you know in our flesh we can sing
[1:21:18] i've been redeemed and we feel good
[1:21:21] about it
[1:21:22] but where's the burden for the person
[1:21:24] who hasn't been redeemed who hasn't come
[1:21:26] to this
[1:21:27] relationship where they've given
[1:21:28] everything to jesus
[1:21:30] where is that well that's not my
[1:21:32] responsibility
[1:21:35] show me that spirit show me that holy
[1:21:37] ghost spirit in the bible
[1:21:39] show me that holy ghost spirit in the
[1:21:40] message i can't find that
[1:21:43] but i could be wrong i don't think i am
[1:21:47] i'm giving you time come on up here
[1:21:49] bring your bible
[1:21:50] okay bring your panel
[1:21:56] for it is the whole thing in one plan of
[1:21:58] redemption coming down that god
[1:22:00] coming back to live in and to dwell with
[1:22:03] and to commune with his people as he did
[1:22:06] in the beginning
[1:22:08] now god as that light was begin to shine
[1:22:12] in the last days
[1:22:13] he is expecting us
[1:22:16] hope this doesn't get to you he's
[1:22:18] expecting us
[1:22:19] a great thing from us because where
[1:22:22] there's much given
[1:22:24] there is much required
[1:22:27] so he's going to require much of us than
[1:22:29] he did from the lutherans
[1:22:31] or the methodists because we walk
[1:22:35] in a greater light with a greater power
[1:22:38] with a greater witness than they had
[1:22:42] i want you to notice all these quotes
[1:22:43] came from the 60 minutes
[1:22:45] of that message that you listened to
[1:22:50] but it's all coming forth of the holy
[1:22:53] spirit till the great church
[1:22:55] is being filled up and chugged full
[1:22:58] hallelujah brother brown next on the
[1:23:00] pulpit twice
[1:23:03] of the great powers of the almighty god
[1:23:06] until it's got to a place
[1:23:07] until the very works of jesus done
[1:23:11] is manifesting itself right in the
[1:23:14] church
[1:23:15] now amen
[1:23:18] now so i read that i ought to come to
[1:23:21] church
[1:23:22] excited with an expectation
[1:23:26] not coming to church because it's a
[1:23:28] church
[1:23:30] i want to go if i don't go right i'll
[1:23:32] feel bad
[1:23:37] there would be a spirit inside of us i
[1:23:38] can't wait till those doors are open
[1:23:41] if that ain't there you need to look at
[1:23:42] the spirit you're feeding on
[1:23:46] now listen he said he deals with the
[1:23:49] church
[1:23:50] as individuals each individual in the
[1:23:52] church and that's why i say this
[1:23:54] you know everybody in this church is not
[1:23:56] going to agree with me
[1:23:57] they're not going to agree what's being
[1:23:59] what this message teach what this bible
[1:24:01] teaches
[1:24:04] but don't let you be that one
[1:24:07] be the one that says i'm going to get
[1:24:09] closer i'm going to take this word today
[1:24:12] and i'm going to let god have control of
[1:24:13] my life i'm going to seek more of the
[1:24:15] holy ghost
[1:24:16] so he can have his way in my life
[1:24:18] instead of just being satisfied while i
[1:24:20] got enough to make it
[1:24:23] you know that spirit if god had that
[1:24:25] spirit he would have never went to
[1:24:26] calvary
[1:24:28] and you're going to tell me that's the
[1:24:30] same spirit in you
[1:24:32] no sir
[1:24:36] he said now the words that i do
[1:24:39] shall you do also he said not another
[1:24:43] work
[1:24:44] but god wants to bring the holy ghost
[1:24:47] in you to continue the same
[1:24:50] work that he was doing in christ
[1:24:54] that's what the prophet said
[1:24:58] the same purpose in other words the same
[1:25:00] plan
[1:25:01] so why do you got the holy ghost
[1:25:04] what's the purpose of the holy ghost the
[1:25:07] brain said
[1:25:08] as jesus said as the father has sent me
[1:25:12] as now watch as the father has sent me
[1:25:16] so send i you
[1:25:19] as the father how did the father send
[1:25:22] him
[1:25:23] the father that sent him come down from
[1:25:27] heaven
[1:25:27] and dwelt in him so how does he send you
[1:25:31] the holy ghost comes down and sends you
[1:25:35] he went forth he said i always do the
[1:25:37] things that please my father
[1:25:40] he went about doing the things that his
[1:25:41] father was showing him to do i do not
[1:25:43] think that the father showed me first
[1:25:45] the god that sent him was on the inside
[1:25:49] of him
[1:25:50] as the father sent me the same way the
[1:25:53] father
[1:25:54] set me so i send you what is it
[1:25:57] god in you carrying on the same works
[1:26:01] the same way amen
[1:26:04] i tell you we
[1:26:07] we know we know this to be the truth but
[1:26:10] is it happening in our life
[1:26:12] that's the question is it happening in
[1:26:15] our life because
[1:26:16] if it's not this is where decisions have
[1:26:19] to be made
[1:26:24] so what is the holy ghost for let's
[1:26:26] stand together i just want to close in
[1:26:28] this statement
[1:26:30] the holy ghost isn't just
[1:26:33] for our personal purposes isn't just to
[1:26:37] comfort us
[1:26:38] with our personal life issues
[1:26:41] the purpose of the holy ghost today is
[1:26:44] so god can live in you
[1:26:46] and use you to carry out
[1:26:50] his original plan of redemption
[1:26:55] and did you know the bible says that all
[1:26:57] things work together for the good
[1:27:00] amen to them that love the lord
[1:27:06] and to them that are called according to
[1:27:08] what
[1:27:09] his purpose
[1:27:13] impart the holy ghost is for god's
[1:27:17] purpose
[1:27:19] to fulfill his plan of redemption
[1:27:22] not the zillion things that we got going
[1:27:24] on in our life
[1:27:26] i'm not saying god ain't interested in
[1:27:27] those i'm not saying god won't
[1:27:29] help with those things but that ain't
[1:27:32] its main objective
[1:27:34] to me those are just like the french
[1:27:36] benefits
[1:27:37] really you you you pay your ties
[1:27:41] not just so your barns are full that
[1:27:43] just happens
[1:27:48] you don't you don't get the only ghost
[1:27:50] since you can have joy it just comes
[1:27:52] from getting the holy ghost you still
[1:27:53] got to carry out the plan of redemption
[1:27:58] don't sell yourself short of the
[1:28:00] realness of what god has for each of you
[1:28:04] wherever you're at personally with the
[1:28:06] lord
[1:28:07] i want you to extend that imagine it
[1:28:10] like an extension ladder
[1:28:12] you're just reaching up a little closer
[1:28:15] to god
[1:28:16] seeing more clearly your purpose of why
[1:28:19] god gave you his spirit
[1:28:22] so you can be a fisher of
[1:28:28] men that's fulfilling his purpose
[1:28:31] that's why brother brahm could say that
[1:28:34] that missionary work was always in the
[1:28:35] will of god it was always
[1:28:36] his purpose amen it is a privilege
[1:28:41] so again we're fighting this
[1:28:44] the spirit that would try to keep us
[1:28:46] from allowing god to use our life
[1:28:50] it's don't be selfish with the holy
[1:28:52] ghost
[1:28:54] live for others amen let's bow our heart
[1:28:56] in in prayer
[1:29:00] maybe there'd be someone here today say
[1:29:02] brother john this word
[1:29:04] has spoken to me in a way that i've
[1:29:06] never quite seen it like this
[1:29:08] and i'm just asking would you remember
[1:29:10] me in prayer god bless these hands
[1:29:13] that sees your heart so beautiful
[1:29:16] so beautiful tell me my heart just
[1:29:19] rejoices off i can say it like this
[1:29:21] the holy ghost inside of me is rejoicing
[1:29:25] seizure your love for the holy spirit to
[1:29:28] have his way
[1:29:30] amen heavenly father lord my hands
[1:29:33] are lifted too lord has spent
[1:29:36] over a week pondering these things that
[1:29:39] you gave me
[1:29:41] that you gave us this little flock here

[1:29:48] forth

[1:29:51] show us
[1:29:53] it's really all about you

[1:30:01] was

[1:30:23] spirit

[1:30:49] light shining out

[1:30:55] yesterday today and forever caring about
[1:30:57] other people's souls

[1:31:02] just to see one come to know you
[1:31:08] keep us o god keep us
[1:31:13] with the mind of christ let us not slip
[1:31:16] in our own carnality
[1:31:18] but keep us as we go forth from here
[1:31:24] esteeming others better than ourselves
[1:31:27] help us to fulfill your joy
[1:31:30] to be like-minded with you lord we love
[1:31:33] you we thank you for these things now we
