[0:00] it's also in your hearts jesus said
[0:03] heaven and earth
[0:04] will pass away but my word shall never
[0:07] pass away
[0:09] that's why we must receive all of god's
[0:11] word into our heart
[0:13] not our head into our heart
[0:17] if you don't receive it into your heart
[0:19] it will not establish you
[0:22] believe in the lord thy god so shall thy
[0:24] be establish believe in his prophets so
[0:27] shall you prosper but it has to be in
[0:30] the heart
[0:32] if it's just in the head somebody
[0:34] smarter than you
[0:36] is going to come by and talk you out of
[0:38] it
[0:40] the devil's going to use somebody now
[0:43] jesus wanted us to receive more of his
[0:46] kingdom
[0:47] when he taught us to pray let thy
[0:50] kingdom
[0:51] come let thy will be
[0:54] done on earth as it is
[0:58] in heaven so he taught us how to receive
[1:02] more of his kingdom how to receive more
[1:04] of the government
[1:06] we need to learn to pray lord let that
[1:10] kingdom come
[1:11] not well it'll come if he wants it to
[1:14] until then i'm just going to do what i
[1:15] want to do i'm sorry
[1:16] he's not that type of god
[1:20] he won't come unless you're you will
[1:22] find me you will search me and
[1:24] find me you'll find me when you search
[1:27] for me with all your heart
[1:29] amen he requires
[1:33] more of our heart amen
[1:36] god's promises are settled in heaven let
[1:39] them be settled inside of you
[1:42] they are attainable simply believe that
[1:45] there is no
[1:46] higher law in the universe in other
[1:48] words if god gave you the promise
[1:51] don't let a devil tell you anything
[1:52] different
[1:54] there is no higher authority
[1:59] god cannot lie his word
[2:02] cannot fail it will accomplish
[2:06] its role second corinthians chapter 1
[2:09] verse 20
[2:10] for all the promises of god
[2:14] in him are ye and
[2:17] in him amen unto the glory
[2:20] of god all the promises of god are gay
[2:24] and amen
[2:25] not some of them you can depend on every
[2:28] one of them
[2:30] repent be baptized every one of you in
[2:32] the name of jesus christ and you
[2:34] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[2:36] well brother john i got baptized
[2:38] four years ago and i still haven't
[2:40] received it stand
[2:41] on the promise because god has never
[2:43] failed amen
[2:45] amen they've never failed not one time
[2:49] god has an impeccable record
[2:55] it's undefeated he's the undefeated
[2:58] champion
[2:59] amen god is unchangeable he is the same
[3:03] yesterday
[3:04] today and forever amen hebrews chapter 6
[3:08] verse 13
[3:09] for when god made his promise to abraham
[3:12] because he could swear by
[3:13] no greater he swore by himself
[3:17] think about it there was nobody great
[3:19] you know how it is
[3:21] you go to somebody and you make a
[3:26] a agreement you you you swear by
[3:29] something greater
[3:32] there was nobody greater than god
[3:35] verse 18 it is impossible for god
[3:39] to lie now that ought to give us a
[3:43] strong consolation who have
[3:46] fled for refuge to lay hold upon the
[3:49] hope that set before us
[3:51] which hope we have as an anchor
[3:54] of the soul both sure and steadfast
[3:57] which entereth into that within the veil
[4:01] that's verse 18 19.
[4:02] sorry that i didn't say that
[4:05] we have an anchor
[4:10] inside it's god i'm relying
[4:15] on god inside i'm not relying
[4:19] on my head
[4:22] that thing is so up and down you can't
[4:25] even make it to the day
[4:26] through the day with and be straight in
[4:28] your head
[4:30] but god is straight
[4:34] he's consistent and i'll tell you
[4:38] when things are shaky all around us go
[4:41] back to calvary
[4:42] go back to the word
[4:45] he makes all things beautiful
[4:49] now what are god's promises given for
[4:54] i want to step into this a little bit
[4:56] because
[4:58] we're a natural people
[5:01] that want god for natural things
[5:05] and i'm not saying that god isn't there
[5:08] for natural things i'm not saying that i
[5:09] would never
[5:10] say that but if that's all god did for
[5:14] us
[5:14] what would happen at the end
[5:19] we'd just be the absolute most blessed
[5:22] sinners
[5:26] the rain falls on the justin unjust
[5:30] god's spiritual promises are not just
[5:33] meant for our natural benefits
[5:37] they wanted to use brother branham to
[5:39] beef up their churches
[5:42] to draw the crowds to find out where the
[5:45] oil was buried
[5:48] to meet a lot of natural and
[5:54] a lot of natural desires and a lot of
[5:56] natural needs
[6:00] and i'm not against those things
[6:05] but jesus didn't just bear the stripes
[6:09] for our body's health no sir
[6:13] our healing is a promise from god and we
[6:16] need to learn to stand on that promise
[6:18] amen
[6:20] he already paid the price for the
[6:22] doctor's visit
[6:23] for the for the prescriptions amen
[6:26] all we need to do is only believe
[6:30] only believe the price was already paid
[6:35] but remember the needing
[6:39] the needed healings were just the bait
[6:42] on the hook
[6:47] we need to get hooked on jesus
[6:50] isaiah chapter 53 verse 7
[6:54] he was oppressed and he was afflicted
[6:58] yet he opened not his mouth he is
[7:02] brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[7:06] as a sheep before the shears is dumb
[7:09] so he opened out his mouth just picture
[7:11] jesus
[7:13] going to calvary today
[7:17] oppressed afflicted and he kept his
[7:20] mouth closed
[7:22] as he was suffering he was taken
[7:25] from prison and from judgment
[7:29] he was just verse eight verse three he
[7:31] was despised and rejected a man a man of
[7:34] sorrows
[7:34] acquainted with griefs surely he carried
[7:37] our griefs
[7:38] and our sorrows with him all the way to
[7:41] calvary
[7:43] as he was despised written stricken
[7:46] smitten of god and afflicted for us
[7:48] and you know what we did we just hit our
[7:50] faces remember when somebody first told
[7:52] us about jesus
[7:58] he died for you i'm fine i'm fine thank
[8:01] you don't need it
[8:03] i've been going this far in my life i
[8:04] don't need any help
[8:07] just hit our face
[8:11] think every single person
[8:16] was acting like peter
[8:24] because
[8:26] we're all in sin and did not really
[8:28] realize that we were going to hell
[8:30] without jesus
[8:36] peter did not esteem
[8:41] jesus what he did even denied him
[8:47] so he didn't just go to calvary
[8:50] for my body's healing it wasn't just so
[8:54] i could prosper in this life
[8:56] have a new home or or a new car or
[8:59] or something like that verse 5 says but
[9:02] he was wounded for our transgressions
[9:05] he was bruised for our iniquities and
[9:07] the chastisement
[9:08] of our peace was upon him calvary
[9:12] had to do with something other than my
[9:14] prosperity in this life
[9:17] it was a prosperity of my soul amen it
[9:20] was an
[9:20] increase to the god's kingdom
[9:25] the wall of sin of unbelief
[9:28] and a corruptable nature was dismantled
[9:31] between
[9:32] man and god right at calvary calvary
[9:34] opened the door for us to have
[9:36] fellowship with our creator amen
[9:39] to come into the image of our creator so
[9:41] he could
[9:42] so we could have proper fellowship if i
[9:44] could say it like this he told the woman
[9:46] who who did worship god he says you
[9:49] don't even
[9:50] know what you worship
[9:54] how many people are going to church
[9:55] today worshiping and don't even know
[9:58] what they're doing they don't even know
[10:00] the god they're worshiping
[10:07] calvary opened the door that god's holy
[10:09] spirit could come into our life
[10:10] and we could know god in a proper way
[10:13] that we could worship him in spirit
[10:15] in the spirit of the holy ghost
[10:20] and he's seeking those today that will
[10:23] worship him in that way
[10:25] he's going around the globe he's going
[10:26] in every church he's going down every
[10:28] every aisle every every row every pew
[10:32] and he's looking for someone that will
[10:34] worship him in spirit and truth
[10:38] because he is a spirit and they that
[10:40] worship him must it's a must
[10:44] it might be an option to our attitude
[10:48] but you want to find favor with god
[10:51] i'll just say like what he said to cain
[10:54] if thou doest well
[10:56] thou will be accepted
[10:59] praise god how many love the word
[11:04] you know all you got to do is say praise
[11:05] the lord i love you jesus
[11:07] knock those demons off all those throw
[11:11] cold informal feelings kind of trap us
[11:15] into some
[11:16] intellectual relationship with jesus
[11:18] christ
[11:19] we don't have an intellectual
[11:20] relationship with jesus christ
[11:22] we have one that goes deep inside our
[11:24] hearts amen
[11:26] god's promises are to bring a spiritual
[11:30] increase
[11:31] to god's government are you with me
[11:35] ii peter chapter one verse number three
[11:40] we've got to see what these promises are
[11:42] for they're not just for our natural
[11:44] life
[11:46] according as his divine power
[11:50] praise the lord love everyone getting
[11:53] into the
[11:53] pulling up their bible getting into it
[11:57] according as his divine power have given
[12:01] unto us
[12:02] all things that pertaineth unto life
[12:05] and godliness through the knowledge of
[12:08] him
[12:09] that have called us to glory and virtue
[12:13] whereby are given unto us
[12:16] exceeding great and precious
[12:20] promises hallelujah
[12:24] and that by these precious
[12:27] promises we might be partakers
[12:31] of his divine nature
[12:36] that's what they're for
[12:39] so i can become like jesus
[12:42] i wonder how many times we come to
[12:45] church and we want a promise of god
[12:47] that will change our nature
[12:53] having escaped the corruption that is in
[12:55] this world through lust
[12:57] and besides this
[13:00] giving all diligence
[13:04] add to your faith
[13:07] virtue strength and to
[13:10] our virtue knowledge and to our
[13:13] knowledge
[13:14] temperance and temperance patience and
[13:17] to our patience
[13:18] godliness and to our godliness brotherly
[13:22] kindness and your brotherly kindness
[13:25] charity
[13:25] and i'm telling you if you have all that
[13:28] you may have a
[13:29] a 1967 volkswagen you might have a 2021k
[13:34] i don't care but you need this right
[13:36] here that's what this is about
[13:38] it's about prospering in your nature
[13:40] prospering in your soul
[13:42] becoming like jesus christ in the very
[13:45] image of god
[13:48] that's what the promises are for
[13:52] god's promises in our life are to bring
[13:54] back such an
[13:56] increase of god's divine nature to all
[13:59] things
[14:00] our gods all things
[14:04] are gods in other words god owns our
[14:08] life god owns our soul
[14:10] god owns our will our time
[14:13] our our pocketbook
[14:16] i think this is a good time to take up
[14:18] an offering
[14:22] second corinthians chapter 5 chapter 5
[14:24] verse 17
[14:25] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17
[14:28] therefore
[14:31] if any one of us are going to be in
[14:34] christ
[14:37] if any man be in christ he
[14:40] is a new creature
[14:44] he's not an old creature with a new
[14:48] paint job
[14:51] new curtains new carpet
[14:55] he's new on the inside
[14:58] a new nature change old things are
[15:00] passed away
[15:01] behold all things are become new now i
[15:04] just want to say this today
[15:06] none of us have fulfilled this scripture
[15:10] brother john i'm offended i'm leaving
[15:12] here
[15:16] paul did not fulfill this scripture
[15:19] that's why he kept pressing towards the
[15:20] mark
[15:23] it's really good i think it's the
[15:26] attitude that we have
[15:27] well i'm a christian i got baptized i
[15:29] got the holy ghost i'm going to heaven
[15:30] on bride
[15:35] it's a carnal understanding is what you
[15:38] have
[15:39] the interest needs to be all things in
[15:42] my life need to become gods
[15:45] not trying to make everything you got
[15:48] god except
[15:50] it's a difference
[15:55] verse 18 and all
[15:58] things are of god
[16:06] he basically just takes your life and
[16:08] rips it open
[16:11] he says i'm taking this out and this out
[16:13] and this
[16:14] and i'm giving you this this this is my
[16:17] will
[16:17] this is what i want you to do
[16:21] and so he can stand back and say
[16:25] everything there is mine everything
[16:28] he's my elected official you know what
[16:32] i'm going to make him an ambassador
[16:35] i'm going to give him a ministry he was
[16:38] doing his own thing
[16:40] now he's going to do my thing amen
[16:44] all things are of god who have
[16:45] reconciled us to himself
[16:48] by jesus christ and have given unto us
[16:51] the responsibility of restoring
[16:55] others to christ
[17:00] i wonder how often we even think about
[17:02] that
[17:03] i'm talking about god's government here
[17:06] god wants to make an increase to his
[17:08] government
[17:09] the government is upon his shoulders he
[17:12] has elected officials
[17:14] he has called us to be
[17:17] ambassadors amen to wit that god was in
[17:19] christ reconciling the world to himself
[17:22] and imputing not imputing their
[17:24] trespasses upon them and committed unto
[17:26] us
[17:27] the word of reconciliation let's hit
[17:29] that next verse if we could
[17:32] now then we are ambassadors for christ
[17:38] we got a different job amen
[17:42] do you ever think about somebody that's
[17:43] an ambassador
[17:46] you know we've heard about uh american
[17:48] and
[17:49] embed ambassadors ambassadors and
[17:52] embassies
[17:53] you're the man in other countries and
[17:56] how they're bombing them are they
[17:59] kind of scary
[18:03] but it's a hope for those that are
[18:05] trying to flee for freedom
[18:08] we come across people who get desperate
[18:12] they they're looking for help for
[18:16] life you are the ambassador
[18:22] the ambassador for christ as though god
[18:24] did beseech you
[18:26] by us we pray in christ's dead be
[18:28] reconciled
[18:30] to god god uses us to help
[18:33] others get to jesus
[18:36] and if they're already to jesus god uses
[18:38] us to get him closer to jesus
[18:41] closer to jesus don't and you know i
[18:44] think jesus just wants to put his arms
[18:45] around us hug
[18:46] us and just pull us up real close to him
[18:50] amen we have that tendency to like as a
[18:54] child oh
[18:56] you remember when grandma and grandpa
[18:58] used to club ya
[19:02] i miss you too grandma
[19:05] and we want to get away and kind of do
[19:07] our own thing we have that
[19:09] tendency to kind of want to do our own
[19:10] thing sometimes we can drift off we just
[19:13] got to get back to jesus amen
[19:16] now we cannot lose focus on the purpose
[19:18] of god's promises
[19:20] for our life they're to change our
[19:24] nature so we can fulfill the will of god
[19:27] if we lose that focus and we just use
[19:29] god's promises for our natural life
[19:31] that is not even interested to us
[19:34] there's no interest to it
[19:38] why we need to keep focused
[19:41] on the real purpose of god's promises
[19:44] we've seen ministries that encourage you
[19:47] to use god's promises to get what you
[19:49] want out of this life
[19:51] a fleet of cadillacs prosperous jobs
[19:56] hefty bank accounts greatly it's about
[19:59] to greatly influence others
[20:02] we've seen them out there they're
[20:03] they're they're they're just
[20:05] on a lot of the tv channels a lot of the
[20:08] radio stations
[20:14] but what will all that matter on rapture
[20:17] morning
[20:19] how would any of those things get you to
[20:21] have favor with god
[20:24] or to make you ready when god's whole
[20:26] heart is he wants
[20:27] your will to be yielded to his
[20:32] that's his desire and he will not force
[20:35] himself on us
[20:36] and then we're going to take his word
[20:39] and use his word
[20:40] to prosper our life
[20:46] if i understand the scripture the
[20:48] scripture says i would that all would
[20:50] prosper
[20:50] even as thy soul prospers
[20:54] soul first then the other
[20:59] jesus didn't go up to the rich young
[21:01] ruler and say
[21:03] you rich you're rich i blessed you you
[21:06] should be thankful that i gave you all
[21:08] this money
[21:17] in fact he said you need to get rid of
[21:20] this great blessing
[21:21] because it's standing in the way between
[21:24] your will
[21:26] for me in your life
[21:31] because god will not force himself on
[21:33] the rich young ruler
[21:35] he won't force himself he won't make us
[21:38] do his will
[21:39] he'll put us in very uncomfortable
[21:41] positions
[21:43] he'll make us rethink the decision that
[21:46] we made
[21:47] he'll make us say oh make us get to a
[21:51] place that in our heart we say
[21:53] oh to jesus
[21:56] i surrender
[21:58] [Music]
[22:02] because he wants to be the king
[22:05] of our life the lord of our life
[22:09] not just the savior of our life
[22:13] and the prosper of our life
[22:16] there's an interest to the nature of god
[22:19] being in us that god is concerned about
[22:22] we need to have that same concern amen
[22:26] now the scriptures have taught us what
[22:28] the promises are for
[22:30] look at abraham who received the promise
[22:32] of god
[22:33] for a land genesis chapter 12 verse 1
[22:37] now the lord had said unto abram
[22:40] get thee out of thy country and from thy
[22:43] kindred and from thy father's house
[22:46] onto a land that i will show thee
[22:52] so god right off the bat genesis chapter
[22:54] 12
[22:55] promises abraham a lamb
[22:59] god told abraham to separate from his
[23:02] family
[23:04] look even even he had to separate from
[23:07] lot
[23:09] who was a halftime believer
[23:14] he sat in the church with the believers
[23:16] and believed half the time
[23:22] genesis chapter 13 verse 14 and the lord
[23:25] in genesis chapter 13 verse 14 and the
[23:28] lord said unto abram
[23:30] after that lot after notice after that
[23:33] lot
[23:33] was separated from him he said now
[23:37] lift up now thine eyes and look from
[23:41] the place where thou art northward
[23:44] southward eastward westward for
[23:47] all the land which thou seest to thee
[23:50] what i give it
[23:52] and to thy seed forever
[23:55] the very promise that god
[23:59] had given now abraham is laying his eyes
[24:02] on it
[24:04] brother sister there's going to have to
[24:05] be a separation a lot of separation
[24:08] that takes place in our life
[24:11] if we're going to receive all of god's
[24:14] holy ghost
[24:18] all of god's nature how do you want me
[24:21] to say it
[24:23] we might have to separate from the
[24:25] halfway believers god
[24:32] word calls for a total separation from
[24:35] unbelief amen
[24:37] now this land right here is a type
[24:41] of the nature that god wants to give us
[24:44] think about that this land that
[24:48] god showed abraham in the natural
[24:51] is a spiritual type for us of
[24:55] his nature that he wants to give us
[25:02] his divine nature the holy ghost
[25:06] the new birth however you want to word
[25:10] it
[25:10] but a separation is required and we need
[25:14] to keep
[25:14] adding to that divine nature from glory
[25:18] unto glory line upon line hear a little
[25:22] there a little keep adding his divine
[25:25] nature to your life by using the
[25:28] promises
[25:29] of his word because that's what the
[25:30] promises are for
[25:32] do you want the devil to get off your
[25:34] back because you can't stand him
[25:35] bothering you
[25:38] so you can live the way you want to live
[25:40] in this world
[25:46] or do you want him to get off your back
[25:48] so you can have all of god inside of you
[25:51] amen because that's the land
[25:54] amen that's the land amen
[26:02] now you're going you're going to have to
[26:04] fight for it just like joshua and caleb
[26:08] did
[26:12] the children of israel
[26:16] they had an attitude of i
[26:19] can still serve god still love him
[26:23] still do all the things that the law
[26:25] requires
[26:27] on this side of jordan
[26:30] in other words this side of the nature
[26:32] of god living in me
[26:34] this side of the holy ghost living in my
[26:37] home
[26:38] living in my life i'll serve god here
[26:41] in this man-made system
[26:44] in other words what god wanted me to do
[26:47] what god has given me and what god is
[26:50] telling me to do to go over there
[26:52] i don't need to do that
[26:55] it's a man-made system
[26:59] that's why they got so many man-made
[27:01] religions out there
[27:05] i hope you're getting something out of
[27:06] this
[27:08] you know you just can't be a tagalong
[27:12] they were a tagalong
[27:15] god won't let us in the promised land
[27:18] being
[27:18] a tagalong you can't just
[27:22] say oh i i believe in moses our
[27:26] deliverer
[27:27] he was with us for for 40 years and we
[27:29] were
[27:30] our fathers eight men in the wilderness
[27:34] okay okay and jesus said to everyone
[27:38] dead
[27:40] speaking of the spiritual part
[27:46] because they were unwilling to go get
[27:48] the divine nature of
