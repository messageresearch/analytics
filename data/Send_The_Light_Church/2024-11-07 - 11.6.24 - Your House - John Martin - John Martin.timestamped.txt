[36:53] in uh the light of this late hour that
[36:57] we're living as we commit the service
[37:00] your blessings and the reading of the
[37:02] word now in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[37:04] amen amen Isaiah 38 starting with verse
[37:08] one in those days was Hezekiah sick unto
[37:11] death and Isaiah the prophet the son of
[37:14] Amos came unto him and said unto him
[37:16] thus saith the Lord set thy house in
[37:20] order for thou shall die and not live
[37:24] and Hezekiah turned his face towards the
[37:26] wall and prayed unto the Lord
[37:28] and said remember now oh Lord I beseech
[37:32] thee how I have walked before thee in
[37:36] truth and with a perfect heart and have
[37:39] done that which is good in thy sight and
[37:42] Hezekiah wept
[37:44] sore and the L and then came the word of
[37:48] the Lord to Isaiah saying go and say to
[37:51] Hezekiah thus sayeth the Lord the god of
[37:54] David thy father I have heard thy prayer
[38:00] I have seen thy tears behold I will add
[38:05] unto thy days 15 years amen God bless
[38:10] you may be
[38:11] seated before we stepped into this I
[38:14] just I wanted to um show some
[38:18] pictures uh from the Philippines that
[38:21] was sent I know that uh many of us have
[38:23] been praying for the Believers there
[38:26] that uh many of their homes were uh
[38:30] destroyed by the
[38:32] floods and even though it's far away
[38:35] from us and um but they are our Brothers
[38:39] and Sisters in Christ and I she sent
[38:42] these pictures and I I thought we could
[38:45] just pass them on so we could could
[38:47] maybe uh get a vision of of how to pray
[38:50] for these people that are less fortunate
[38:52] than us
[38:53] today and uh I'll just read what she had
[38:56] given us here here are some pictures
[38:58] that Brother Gary from nuba uh Kenneth
[39:02] sir they are just some of of the houses
[39:05] of his members where he was able to
[39:08] visit riding a small bat signal is still
[39:11] very intimate and
[39:13] slow uh he can't send more there are 17
[39:17] families in his church whose houses and
[39:21] livelihood have been affected Brother
[39:23] Gary lost more than 300 Hogs some of you
[39:26] may remember remember me speaking this
[39:28] before the typhoon because of the
[39:31] African swine view flu and they were
[39:34] supposed to harvest rice last week but
[39:37] even before they could do it the rice
[39:39] fields were already flooded they were
[39:42] supposed to harvest
[39:44] 1500 LBS or 1500 bags but ended up with
[39:49] just
[39:50] 34 which they got a day before the
[39:53] typhoon so the brother cannot help his
[39:56] members because because he himself
[39:58] doesn't have any means now amen praise
[40:03] the Lord that there are believers on the
[40:06] other side of the world that believe in
[40:09] prayer believe in support and by the
[40:12] grace of God this church was able to
[40:14] send some some help over to help these
[40:17] people I I believe every prayer every
[40:22] offering you put in the back in that
[40:24] says
[40:25] missions I believe God records he says
[40:28] he's not forgetful to forget your labor
[40:31] of love which you have shown unto the
[40:34] Saints and say God remembers a cup of
[40:38] cold water would not even be the reward
[40:41] of giving a cup of cold water to
[40:44] somebody it will not be forgotten
[40:47] amen I'm thankful that God is keeping
[40:50] some good records now we're all um maybe
[40:53] a little bit tired because we're like
[40:55] watching the good news course the the
[40:58] the election um that happened I'm sorry
[41:02] as to say that but the election was
[41:04] taking place and
[41:06] um it is um um well I'm I'm just
[41:12] thankful the Bible tells us to pray for
[41:15] those that are in authority and we're
[41:17] we're we're just anxious to see uh the
[41:20] results of that and I want to thank
[41:23] everybody for praying I believe that's
[41:26] uh in order
[41:27] and there has been a great relief uh
[41:31] about what has transpired in uh all
[41:34] across America and I know everybody
[41:37] isn't you know maybe in favor and that's
[41:40] very okay it's really okay um but um we
[41:46] know that we're living in a dark hour
[41:49] and we still have to get ready we still
[41:52] have to make sure that we're ready no
[41:55] matter who is being president no matter
[41:58] what's happening what is allowed there
[42:00] is a relationship that we have as
[42:02] individuals with God that that's really
[42:05] what matters and that's why we're here
[42:07] today uh one more thing before we get
[42:09] into the word and that's uh brother uh
[42:11] Gideon wanted to send his greetings U
[42:14] most some of you I could say like this
[42:16] had been praying for some time for him
[42:19] to get a Visa well he was just able to
[42:21] get his visa and uh he really
[42:23] appreciates the prayers of all the
[42:25] saints and um and so now we can at least
[42:29] have uh to look forward to him coming uh
[42:33] sometime and I don't know when that
[42:35] would be but at least the means to get
[42:37] here now we just want you know the will
[42:39] of the Lord amen we want to entitle this
[42:42] message this this evening your house we
[42:45] want to talk about your house now God
[42:48] came to Hezekiah with an important
[42:50] message from heaven and this message was
[42:54] set thy house in order
[42:59] Hezekiah didn't even realize this his
[43:02] house was out of
[43:05] order you notice this from the
[43:07] scriptures he said I've walked before
[43:10] thee in truth with a perfect heart I've
[43:13] done that which is good in thy sight and
[43:15] he was kind of thinking that what he had
[43:18] done in the past should have
[43:20] sufficed but that's not the way God
[43:23] looks at things God is not a god of the
[43:25] past he he is a god of the present amen
[43:30] he when he he told Moses tell him that I
[43:33] am that I am he's in I am God so God is
[43:36] really interested in what's happening in
[43:38] our house
[43:40] today no matter what we've done in the
[43:42] best he's interested in what's happening
[43:45] today but God said your house is out of
[43:48] order you need to set your house in
[43:51] order am God had found things out of
[43:55] order and hezek his house maybe the
[43:59] priorities were out of sequence you ever
[44:02] get priorities out of sequence right the
[44:04] God made it clear what the priorities
[44:06] are seek ye first the kingdom Priority
[44:09] One maybe there was some swearing going
[44:12] on in his home maybe some fighting or
[44:15] arguing or some gossiping or backbiting
[44:18] maybe there wasn't enough prayer time
[44:21] maybe there wasn't not enough respect in
[44:23] the home but God saw that something was
[44:26] out of order
[44:29] and someone was needed to rearrange the
[44:33] laxidasical attitude or the spirit that
[44:36] was in his
[44:38] home and God said Hezekiah I know you're
[44:41] sick but you are the head of the home
[44:45] and you're responsible for all the
[44:47] things that happen in your home and it
[44:49] is your responsibility to set the home
[44:51] in
[44:53] order notice he didn't leave as zekiah
[44:57] to go to the wife or to the
[44:59] children didn't matter if he was sick
[45:02] didn't matter if he was ready to
[45:04] die he had a responsibility and that was
[45:07] to set things in order and I believe it
[45:09] is our responsibility in our homes to
[45:11] make sure that things are in
[45:18] order so God wanted him to start
[45:20] directing his
[45:22] home towards him towards peace towards
[45:28] love command every devil to leave your
[45:33] premises to put away the other gods
[45:36] because we can't serve God and ourselves
[45:38] at the same
[45:40] time to instruct your house in the
[45:44] righteousness of
[45:46] God to rearrange your priorities and put
[45:49] me first in your
[45:51] house to set thy house in order know a
[45:56] lot of times
[45:57] in our homes there's
[46:02] confusion kids the family everybody's
[46:06] not on the same
[46:08] page Bible says for God is not the
[46:10] author of
[46:12] confusion but a
[46:14] peace as in all churches of the
[46:19] Saints well we are the
[46:22] church are we not the church we are the
[46:25] church and this Spirit of the prophets
[46:28] is subject to the prophets can I
[46:31] interpret that for us a little bit the
[46:34] spirit the spirits that be of God are
[46:38] subject to God or the word of God so if
[46:41] the spirit that you're
[46:43] projecting is of god you will stay in
[46:46] the boundaries of the word of God
[46:49] Amen not try to like well you got to do
[46:52] it my way or the way that I'm saying it
[46:54] or I'm the boss or you're not listen
[46:58] listening that's just a ball of
[47:01] confusion and God is not the author of
[47:04] Confusion And so I believe that God
[47:07] wants our house in order just like he
[47:09] wanted hezekiah's house in
[47:12] order he don't want confusion in this
[47:14] house this is his
[47:17] house James 3:16 Says for where envy and
[47:20] strife is there is
[47:23] confusion and every evil work
[47:29] Envy Strife when the spirits in your
[47:32] home are not subject to the word of God
[47:35] there will be Strife there will be
[47:37] resentfulness you ever feel
[47:39] resentfulness
[47:42] discontentment
[47:43] well that's what envying is there'll be
[47:47] confusion and the Bible says look this
[47:49] is basic every evil
[47:52] work just because of confusion
[47:59] see the devil knows how to yeah we've
[48:01] all had this we've all had a problem
[48:06] with somebody in our
[48:07] house doesn't necessarily need to be our
[48:11] spouse our children our parent could be
[48:14] sister
[48:15] brother
[48:17] and it starts out with something
[48:20] ridiculous like you ate the last cookie
[48:24] without asking me if I wanted half
[48:28] something so ridiculous and before you
[48:31] know it there's this anger and and and
[48:35] hatred and this this
[48:39] evil all because I didn't know how to
[48:42] handle the
[48:46] cookie that's because the spirit of the
[48:49] enemy was really in control because you
[48:53] allowed things to get out of control
[48:56] and I believe we're living in an hour
[48:58] that this needs to become a priority our
[49:00] homes are a priority because you we are
[49:03] nothing different in this church than
[49:05] what we are in our homes nothing
[49:12] different so it's important that our
[49:14] homes our homes make up with the
[49:16] churches you ever come to church I just
[49:17] don't feel like trying you want to know
[49:19] why that is because in your home you
[49:21] didn't feel like
[49:25] trying you you you ever come to church
[49:27] and don't want to get in the prayer room
[49:28] that's because you don't want to pray in
[49:34] home or you come to church and you just
[49:36] want somebody to serve you that's
[49:39] because in your home you wanted somebody
[49:40] to serve you and
[49:43] and we if our if we get our homes in
[49:47] line with the word of God that means our
[49:50] church Spirit wise will be more in line
[49:54] with the word of God Amen so we need to
[49:57] stop making excuses and get
[49:59] our our house in
[50:02] order don't sit around on the Lazy
[50:05] Boy don't sit around on the high horse
[50:09] don't act like there's nothing to do in
[50:11] your home there's need of
[50:13] nothing direction is needed from the
[50:17] headship rule regulation is needed
[50:20] structure is needed time spent building
[50:23] is needed your house won't get in order
[50:26] just because your name is John
[50:28] Martin just because you've been serving
[50:31] God for two years it doesn't mean your
[50:32] house is in
[50:36] order and it's a subject that we really
[50:40] maybe haven't wanted to look at but when
[50:44] I see the things that have transpired
[50:46] the things that have been happening and
[50:47] just praying God what would you have me
[50:50] to do what would you have me to say what
[50:52] can
[50:55] help well this is what came to my heart
[50:59] we've got to get an agreement that
[51:01] there's a job that we need to do in our
[51:04] homes because our homes are what our
[51:06] church
[51:07] is and even though we don't necessarily
[51:10] come out manifest yelling and swearing
[51:12] and getting upset and angry and want to
[51:14] punch the pastor I understand that but
[51:17] that Spirit still comes
[51:20] here and then it's hard to enter in hard
[51:22] to really worship from the dictates of
[51:24] our heart hard to just say God have your
[51:26] way with me because at home we don't let
[51:29] God have our way his way because we're
[51:32] going to be the
[51:33] boss because you're the boss doesn't
[51:35] mean the house is in
[51:39] order I think our houses get out of
[51:41] order and we don't even realize
[51:45] it and we're left and if I'll say if
[51:48] they're left out don't order too long
[51:49] you know what happens this is the truth
[51:52] you develop a spirit of I don't even
[51:54] care that they're out of order
[51:57] in other words you put forth no effort
[51:58] you just kind of want to walk
[52:01] out like ignore it I'm done I'm not
[52:05] listening to that
[52:06] anymore I hate I
[52:09] hate you may not say the words but the
[52:11] spirit of you not just getting
[52:14] down and washing the feet of your
[52:17] family is a spirit of
[52:20] hate that's what it is it's love
[52:23] less now you ought to be you ought be
[52:25] saying Amen to this
[52:27] message but because as clear as anything
[52:30] it's the right message for tonight that
[52:33] I
[52:35] know what an awful condition to be stuck
[52:38] in leoda and not even
[52:42] care an awful condition to not care
[52:45] about the character of our own
[52:50] children getting to the place that we
[52:52] don't even care about our example our
[52:54] spirit our attitude or or or the
[52:57] repercussions that our kids are going to
[52:59] act like just because our attitude
[53:01] is not
[53:05] caring we need to get a house in
[53:08] order an awful thing to be little God
[53:11] thinking it's his job to raise our
[53:14] children in the fear and ammonition of
[53:16] the Lord it is our job to raise our
[53:18] children in the fear and am it ain't
[53:20] God's
[53:21] job we can't just well it doesn't matter
[53:24] what I do it matters extremely what you
[53:26] do because what you do is going to make
[53:28] your children either want to serve God
[53:30] or could care
[53:32] less set thy house in
[53:37] order brother bam said in the message
[53:39] sure we would see Jesus he says you know
[53:42] we talk so much in America about
[53:44] juvenile
[53:46] delinquency it ain't juvenile
[53:48] delinquency it's parent
[53:51] delinquency so a lot of times it's the
[53:53] parents' fault not the children's
[53:58] one of the meanest mans in town brother
[54:00] BR said delinquent mothers and
[54:03] delinquent fathers is what makes
[54:06] delinquent
[54:08] child in the message influence he says I
[54:11] think our great problem of what we
[54:13] believe to be juvenile delinquency is
[54:15] parent delinquent a home
[54:18] delinquent think about
[54:20] it we don't even care how our home
[54:23] condition is
[54:27] our people have gotten away from the
[54:29] things they should have stayed
[54:33] with
[54:35] prayer real down to earth God is going
[54:38] to be the God of this home let's get
[54:40] serious and
[54:42] pray let's stop this attitude let's stop
[54:45] this talking we don't hear this in the
[54:47] word we don't hear this in church let's
[54:48] not have it in our
[54:51] homes Jesus said because iniquity just
[54:55] do whatever you want to do would abound
[54:57] the love of many would wax
[55:01] cold too many parents have lost genuine
[55:04] love for the character of of seeing the
[55:08] character of Jesus Christ in their
[55:10] children I I I've been around long
[55:13] enough to let you
[55:15] know children just don't wake up grow up
[55:19] and have character of Christ on their
[55:22] own that is a false conception
[55:26] there is a reason that we've been given
[55:29] the responsibility to bring them up in
[55:32] the way they should go brother Bandon
[55:34] said you are the Holy Ghost until your
[55:37] children get the Holy Ghost the Holy
[55:39] Ghost cares about its attitude cares
[55:43] about what it says it it cares about the
[55:45] example that it
[55:47] sets the way we Act is like we we're
[55:49] some denominational Church doesn't
[55:51] matter it matters we need a fear of God
[55:54] in our heart
[55:58] when we lose respect for ourselves we
[56:00] will automatically lose respect for our
[56:05] children you can't say you respect
[56:07] yourself and disrespect your
[56:13] children respecting yourself is not
[56:17] believing and having your own way and
[56:20] thinking your your will is important
[56:22] that is not
[56:25] respect respect is keeping yourself
[56:27] under subjection to the
[56:34] word brother BR said in the message the
[56:36] world has falling apart he's talking
[56:39] about this
[56:42] policeman he this policeman said well I
[56:45] admire that he said that's right when I
[56:48] was on the police force and everything
[56:51] uh it was juvenile delinquency that's
[56:54] what we call it today and and I said
[56:56] brother BR said and I said sir I don't I
[56:59] don't want to disagree with you but I
[57:02] said it's not juvenile delinquency it's
[57:04] parent
[57:07] delinquency the parent is
[57:11] delinquent parents don't know how to
[57:15] handle things and they don't
[57:19] care they either don't care or they
[57:22] don't know and instead of humbling
[57:25] themselves like the Bible says and get
[57:26] on your knees to just pray and say God
[57:30] would you help my children would you
[57:33] help my spouse would you help my
[57:37] home no they'd rather just I don't
[57:40] care so what do we develop a delinquent
[57:44] home a home out of order a home that God
[57:48] if he showed up at the door would have
[57:50] to say set your house in order before I
[57:52] come in
[57:57] he says' what did you do you put a true
[58:00] story magazine on the table instead of
[58:02] the
[58:03] Bible instead of prayer meetings you had
[58:06] to run out somewhere and do something
[58:07] else you know prayer meeting is just not
[58:10] important to many people
[58:14] nowadays that's what the matter with the
[58:15] world is today that's what the matter
[58:18] with our called Christians see it's
[58:20] parent delinquent not child delinquent
[58:22] the parent is delinquent
[58:26] uh he was saying this for years in many
[58:28] messages in the message door to the
[58:30] doors brother brand said this is the
[58:31] last quote so bear with me after you
[58:33] acquaint he says are you acquainted with
[58:35] the Amish this is back in ' 65 he says I
[58:39] don't know whether you have them out
[58:41] here uh long hair they're very sweet
[58:44] people very clean very nice type you
[58:48] know and all those menites and Amish and
[58:50] so forth he says we've not got one
[58:53] record of juvenile delinquency
[58:56] you he says call them funny if you want
[58:59] to but we got something lacking in our
[59:02] homes that they
[59:05] have they have't one record in the
[59:07] courts of juvenile misbehavior coming
[59:10] among
[59:11] them they bring up their children just
[59:14] in one way and that's the way they
[59:18] go the more consistent we
[59:22] are the more the children will not be
[59:27] confused and the more the children not
[59:29] confused the more they'll have their
[59:31] head on straight of how they're supposed
[59:32] to act and what they're supposed to
[59:35] do we can't expect them to be more
[59:38] intelligent more spiritual and and be
[59:40] able to overcome emotions and feelings
[59:42] better than us we're not trying to teach
[59:44] them to be to to be under subjection to
[59:47] us we're trying to teach them to be
[59:49] under subjection to
[59:51] God the motive has to be God God has to
[59:55] teach your children to love the Lord thy
[59:57] God with all their heart with all they
[59:59] soul with all they
[1:00:00] might if you want God to back you up put
[1:00:03] God
[1:00:06] first now the first thing I would do to
[1:00:09] get my house in order I would do the
[1:00:11] same thing that Hezekiah did you know
[1:00:14] what he did he turned his face towards
[1:00:16] the wall and prayed unto the
[1:00:18] Lord that's the first thing he did to
[1:00:21] get his house in order amen and I'll
[1:00:24] just say Ladi this you need to get
[1:00:26] serious with God right this thing of God
[1:00:29] knows my heart and this he does he knows
[1:00:31] what I'm going through humble
[1:00:34] yourself dig out those clothes of
[1:00:36] humility and put them
[1:00:40] on the Bible says all ye be subject one
[1:00:44] to another humble yourselves under the
[1:00:47] mighty hand of God and he shall exalt
[1:00:50] you in due
[1:00:53] time how many want God to do something
[1:00:55] in your
[1:00:56] home but we have the remedy right here
[1:00:59] in the word of God look this can be
[1:01:01] applied to our children our
[1:01:03] grandchildren our our great
[1:01:05] grandchildren our brothers our sisters
[1:01:07] you apply this word and God will bless
[1:01:11] you James 5:15 and the prayer of faith
[1:01:14] this is how important prayer is the
[1:01:16] prayer of faith shall save the sick the
[1:01:18] Lord shall raise him up and if he have
[1:01:20] committed sins they shall be forgiven
[1:01:24] what a promise through prayer
[1:01:27] prayer changes the
[1:01:30] situation and this is a perfect example
[1:01:32] and Hezekiah you got 15 more years so
[1:01:35] prayer does change situations if it
[1:01:38] Chang that for him it can certainly
[1:01:40] forgive me of my sins it can certainly
[1:01:42] deal with spirits that are trying to get
[1:01:43] in my home deal with my
[1:01:46] kids prayer brings down the power of God
[1:01:50] from Heaven to overcome the
[1:01:54] devil don't try to over become the devil
[1:01:56] yourself right don't try to say I cast
[1:01:59] you out in the name of John
[1:02:03] Martin and I'll say this don't use the
[1:02:06] name of Jesus if you don't respect it
[1:02:16] yourself God
[1:02:18] honors a heart that has put him
[1:02:22] first there's power in prayer
[1:02:26] mix your prayer if you're struggling
[1:02:28] just mix your prayer with a broken and
[1:02:31] contrite
[1:02:32] heart a broken and contrite spirit just
[1:02:36] mix it God will see God will not despise
[1:02:40] that I don't care about the condition
[1:02:43] you you you go ahead and you look at
[1:02:45] Jonah you look at um many examples in
[1:02:49] the Bible where people gotten away from
[1:02:51] God if they just humbled themselves God
[1:02:53] was always merciful to them
[1:02:59] yes God will move in your behalf when
[1:03:01] you're in there in prayer the right way
[1:03:04] you get up from prayer with the
[1:03:06] determination that I am truly with from
[1:03:08] my heart I'm going to set things in
[1:03:10] order in my
[1:03:12] home you have to care about doing that
[1:03:14] you have to get up in faith you have to
[1:03:16] say I'm moving forward because your
[1:03:18] house is not going to get order just
[1:03:20] because you got them in
[1:03:24] church it don't happen like that you've
[1:03:26] got to take the word you've got to eat
[1:03:28] the word you got to say I'm going to
[1:03:29] become the word I'm going to manifest
[1:03:31] the
[1:03:34] word prayer is the first
[1:03:37] thing I can't quite remember but was it
[1:03:40] brother Boaz that said there's three
[1:03:41] things prayer is number
[1:03:43] one prayer is number two prayer is
[1:03:47] number
[1:03:48] three prayer is powerful amen it's your
[1:03:51] it's your heart's communication with God
[1:03:54] you can't sit there and say well God
[1:03:55] knows all things God knows my heart God
[1:03:57] knows what I want no God wants to see
[1:03:58] you put clothes of humility on humble
[1:04:02] yourself before him well I'm just you
[1:04:04] know I don't feel like doing it
[1:04:10] John that's probably why we got the mess
[1:04:13] that we
[1:04:15] got that's probably why we struggle with
[1:04:18] the things that we struggle with because
[1:04:20] we haven't taken god seriously we come
[1:04:22] to church we hear the word and we think
[1:04:24] oh that's just Brother John John's
[1:04:26] opinion no is not brother John's
[1:04:33] opinion God's Gonna back up his
[1:04:36] word he's not GNA back up John
[1:04:38] Martin he will back up his
[1:04:42] word let God fill your home with his
[1:04:45] presence the presence of peace and how
[1:04:48] do you do that by humbling
[1:04:51] yourself to respect your home and put
[1:04:55] prayer back in the
[1:04:57] home I like what that one brother said I
[1:05:00] don't know who it was but he said you
[1:05:03] know we get all B out of shape because
[1:05:04] they could they took prayer out of the
[1:05:06] school and we talk about how bad it is
[1:05:08] they took prayer out of the school and
[1:05:09] it's really hurt our school and they let
[1:05:12] the devil get prayer out of their own
[1:05:19] home Isaiah
[1:05:21] 567 yeah maybe we can put that one up
[1:05:23] there Isaiah 567
[1:05:26] how many is enjoying the word
[1:05:28] today amen it's the word of
[1:05:32] God you
[1:05:38] think we need the word of God Isaiah 567
[1:05:41] says even them will I bring to my Holy
[1:05:44] Mountain and make them joyful In My
[1:05:50] House of Prayer we're still talking
[1:05:52] about prayer their burnt offerings and
[1:05:54] their sacrific shall be accepted upon my
[1:05:57] Altar for my house shall be called a
[1:06:01] house of
[1:06:02] prayer for that
[1:06:04] generation for all people
[1:06:07] amen so I want you to think about what
[1:06:10] this this building is really what it
[1:06:13] really is this this building that we
[1:06:15] call Sendel light church this non
[1:06:17] denominational church this this place
[1:06:18] where we go we we sing songs we hear the
[1:06:20] preaching what is really this place this
[1:06:23] place is a House of Prayer
[1:06:26] and we struggle to get here and pray in
[1:06:29] God's House of Prayer it's because we
[1:06:32] don't respect it as a House of
[1:06:35] Prayer come
[1:06:39] on we think it's some name we call it
[1:06:42] the House of Prayer no he wants his
[1:06:45] house to represent this is a place we
[1:06:47] come and have contact with
[1:06:49] him we get serious with him
[1:06:55] if God wanted his house to be one of
[1:06:59] prayer shouldn't we want our house to be
[1:07:02] one of
[1:07:04] prayer
[1:07:06] yes I mean you want God in your home
[1:07:10] right this is the place we believe God
[1:07:15] is I I tell you if you want God out of
[1:07:19] your home if you want God out of your
[1:07:23] church pick disrespect respect the word
[1:07:26] and kick part of the word
[1:07:30] out Don't Preach all the
[1:07:33] word and God will leave
[1:07:37] that or you might have
[1:07:40] manifestations because people have
[1:07:42] certain faith for certain things but you
[1:07:44] know what when it comes down to
[1:07:45] revealing who he really is you kick that
[1:07:49] out because he has hid it from the wise
[1:07:51] and prudent revealed it to
[1:07:53] babes and I'll say if you want God out
[1:07:56] of your home all you do is you
[1:07:57] disrespect the
[1:07:59] word you can't expect God to be in your
[1:08:02] home when you're not respecting his word
[1:08:04] which is what he stands
[1:08:07] for so it's
[1:08:10] important Jesus said man shall not live
[1:08:12] by bread alone but by every word that
[1:08:14] proceedeth out of the mouth of God
[1:08:17] Amen God has never intended his house to
[1:08:21] be a fellowship
[1:08:23] hall or a place that we come and we sit
[1:08:26] in church and we demand God to speak to
[1:08:28] us what we want to speak to or else
[1:08:30] we're going to have an
[1:08:33] attitude God has always
[1:08:36] intended this place to be a place where
[1:08:39] his people can come to and be intimate
[1:08:43] with
[1:08:45] him that's what prayer is you know
[1:08:47] that's what prayer is all about you know
[1:08:49] prayer is really is really not a prayer
[1:08:54] request we we write out our prayer
[1:08:56] requests and we say God this is what I
[1:08:59] want and that's the end of our prayer
[1:09:02] prayer is meant to be
[1:09:04] intimate it's where you come in contact
[1:09:07] with God you hear his voice he hears
[1:09:11] your
[1:09:12] voice he sees your love you see his love
[1:09:17] Faith grows and there's a relationship
[1:09:20] going
[1:09:21] on that's what it's intended to be for
[1:09:25] a place where the weary can come in and
[1:09:27] get connected with
[1:09:29] God to sincerely wait on him for his
[1:09:33] presence to come and begin to instruct
[1:09:35] Us in the ways of life but you know what
[1:09:38] the problem is with a lot of people and
[1:09:40] why they kicked out the real reason they
[1:09:42] kicked Jesus Christ the word of God out
[1:09:44] of their churches they replaced it with
[1:09:47] bands they replaced it with
[1:09:48] entertainment they replaced it with
[1:09:50] Bingle they replaced it with everything
[1:09:52] and I'm going to tell you
[1:09:54] why because they don't need to be
[1:09:57] intimate they can have church without
[1:10:01] them I'll tell
[1:10:05] you why would we ever want anything
[1:10:08] without
[1:10:12] God Isaiah chter 40:3 says even the
[1:10:16] youth shall faint our youth shall faint
[1:10:20] and be weary and the young men shall
[1:10:23] utterly fall
[1:10:25] but they that wait upon the Lord shall
[1:10:27] renew their strength they shall Mount up
[1:10:30] with wings as eagles they shall run and
[1:10:32] not be weary they shall walk and not
[1:10:34] faint what a promise here this church
[1:10:36] has been set up and dedicated for that
[1:10:39] for the relationships of
[1:10:41] people but if we don't reverence it
[1:10:45] we're not serious about it we're turning
[1:10:47] our nose up to God and making this
[1:10:49] something different than what he
[1:10:50] intended it to be my house shall be
[1:10:52] called a House of Prayer amen
[1:10:55] Jeremiah 29:12 says then shall ye call
[1:10:59] upon me and you shall go and pray unto
[1:11:02] me and you know what I will hearken unto
[1:11:06] you you shall seek me and you shall find
[1:11:09] me when you search for
[1:11:16] me if we believe it's all of our
[1:11:20] heart then let's start seeking him with
[1:11:23] all our heart amen because I'm going to
[1:11:26] say it like this I have seven
[1:11:31] children and if I have one
[1:11:35] child doing their chores giving their
[1:11:38] best being respectful to one another
[1:11:40] honoring their father and
[1:11:44] mother am I going to reward them with
[1:11:47] the same amount that these other six who
[1:11:51] just could care less
[1:11:58] Jesus said this I come quickly and my
[1:12:01] reward is with me to give every man
[1:12:03] according to his
[1:12:06] work God's got good records we have we
[1:12:09] you know we this is the way that we've
[1:12:11] gotten in life we can get mad we can get
[1:12:13] upset we can swear we can do what we
[1:12:15] want to do walk away forget about it and
[1:12:17] think you know since I'm not thinking
[1:12:19] about it everything's
[1:12:23] okay God isn't like that
[1:12:26] that's how the churches are in the world
[1:12:28] this is a we believe the word of
[1:12:32] God we believe in realness
[1:12:36] genuiness yeah we got people in the
[1:12:38] church who are human who make mistakes
[1:12:41] who have a testimony I'm going to go
[1:12:42] ahead and I'm going to serve God and
[1:12:44] they're going to fall that's that is
[1:12:46] acceptable what's not acceptable is to
[1:12:48] stay down after you fallen that's
[1:12:51] wrong get
[1:12:53] up get up and serve the Lord with all
[1:12:55] your heart put some effort into it seven
[1:12:59] times seven times get
[1:13:02] up this is a God we serve a God that's
[1:13:04] worthy to be getting up off our fallen
[1:13:09] faces give them our best he's worthy he
[1:13:13] saved
[1:13:14] you how many blessings has he blessed
[1:13:17] you with and you can't find a reason to
[1:13:19] get up and do your best that's just a
[1:13:23] devil Church is a place we can seek and
[1:13:27] worship God with all of our
[1:13:29] hearts church is a place to make a
[1:13:32] Joyful Noise to to bring our our
[1:13:34] offerings to God you know sometimes we
[1:13:37] come into church and the only offering
[1:13:39] we want to give give is a is an amen or
[1:13:42] a little I like that song so I'm going
[1:13:43] to try to sing that
[1:13:47] one no heart just emotion feeling if I
[1:13:51] feel good then I'll say Amen
[1:13:55] not even thinking about any kind of
[1:13:58] offering to keep the lights on or the
[1:14:00] air conditioning on or the heat
[1:14:03] on you know it's like well that you know
[1:14:05] somebody else takes care of that where's
[1:14:07] your
[1:14:08] burden are you part of the
[1:14:15] church that wasn't in my
[1:14:18] [Laughter]
[1:14:20] notes it's a place to come and lay
[1:14:23] before the Lord in reverence
[1:14:26] say God I really want to hear from
[1:14:29] you take away my hard heart let me hear
[1:14:32] from you because that's I don't know how
[1:14:34] many times we could hear the word of God
[1:14:36] hear directly from God but we're in
[1:14:38] another
[1:14:40] planet too many people don't want to
[1:14:43] hurt and suffer to to to bring a
[1:14:47] sacrifice they want somebody else to
[1:14:49] handle it somebody else to do it
[1:14:57] Mark 11:1
[1:14:59] 17 Jesus taught the people saying unto
[1:15:02] them is it not
[1:15:05] written my house shall be called of all
[1:15:10] Nations the House of
[1:15:12] Prayer but you you have made it a den of
[1:15:17] Thieves
[1:15:19] wow now you say well brother John none
[1:15:22] of us are in here trying to Pedal some
[1:15:27] books that's not how I read
[1:15:31] that we can end up making God's house
[1:15:34] something different than what it is for
[1:15:39] our own personal
[1:15:42] gain something that we're trying to get
[1:15:46] from being amongst other
[1:15:49] people doesn't have to be
[1:15:53] money maybe we just make us a place of
[1:15:55] fellowship with our believer our
[1:15:58] family maybe meet somebody
[1:16:02] there like the main thing is I'll just
[1:16:04] I'll just meet you there we'll talk
[1:16:07] then or maybe do we just want to build
[1:16:10] up our reputation in front of somebody
[1:16:12] else and let them know you know how
[1:16:13] spiritual we
[1:16:16] are maybe a place just to to show up at
[1:16:19] God's house make an appearance and just
[1:16:22] to appease ourselves that we went to
[1:16:25] church
[1:16:27] making the church which should be a
[1:16:31] House of Prayer something different than
[1:16:33] what it
[1:16:35] is now I'll say I'll say this and I mean
[1:16:38] this from my
[1:16:40] heart those of us that are sincere and
[1:16:43] humble and really want to serve God I
[1:16:46] say God bless you to those who are are
[1:16:50] not sincere who are not humble who have
[1:16:52] not been putting their heart into it I
[1:16:54] want this word to bring conviction to
[1:16:57] you because that's what it's
[1:17:03] for Jesus wants his house to be
[1:17:08] reverenced and he wants his house to be
[1:17:11] kept his house not to be made something
[1:17:15] different exactly the way he wanted
[1:17:21] it now if
[1:17:26] we've all worked for
[1:17:30] somebody and when we we work for
[1:17:32] somebody we have to kind of find out the
[1:17:35] way they want things
[1:17:39] done you just can't walk into some place
[1:17:42] make $40 an hour and start calling the
[1:17:45] shots of what you're going to do
[1:17:49] there if they're going to pay you 40 60
[1:17:51] bucks an
[1:17:52] hour you want to make make sure that
[1:17:56] you're doing the things that they want
[1:17:58] you to be doing
[1:18:00] right this is God's
[1:18:03] house it's your responsibility to care
[1:18:05] enough to know how to please him it is
[1:18:08] not the preacher up here to keep
[1:18:09] pounding how you should act and how you
[1:18:12] should be still during the
[1:18:14] service it is not the job of the
[1:18:18] preacher it's the job of your heart to
[1:18:20] get your house your house in
[1:18:23] order to set it in order to teach these
[1:18:26] things to your
[1:18:30] children God wants to meet his
[1:18:33] people we have come into this place
[1:18:39] we've gathered in his
[1:18:42] name to worship
[1:18:46] him just for get about
[1:18:50] yourself concentrate on him and word
[1:18:54] worship
[1:18:56] him we
[1:18:58] sing we got the word all we need is the
[1:19:02] heart our heart to be in the place that
[1:19:05] things can begin to supernaturally
[1:19:07] happen that we can be conformed into the
[1:19:10] image of Jesus Christ now I believe in
[1:19:12] the reality of this word because I know
[1:19:15] what I used to
[1:19:18] be I don't want to go
[1:19:21] back I don't want to go back to what I
[1:19:24] was
[1:19:28] our personal attitude can make the
[1:19:30] church completely different than what
[1:19:33] God intended to be in other words when
[1:19:35] you walk through the doors remember this
[1:19:38] is God's House of
[1:19:39] Prayer get your agenda on what God wants
[1:19:43] it to be and not on what you got in your
[1:19:48] mind now if God's house needed to be
[1:19:53] cleaned up right he went in there with a
[1:19:56] whip and he cleaned up the house if
[1:19:59] God's own house needed to be cleaned up
[1:20:02] how much more should
[1:20:05] ours it's good to clean up our attitudes
[1:20:10] in our homes to do a checkup from the
[1:20:13] neck up as it were to make sure that we
[1:20:16] get our house in order because he's
[1:20:18] coming
[1:20:19] soon now if he spoke tonight he might
[1:20:22] not say
[1:20:24] Thou shalt not live but Thou shalt die
[1:20:27] he may not say that but if he did speak
[1:20:30] to you tonight I believe he would say
[1:20:34] get your house in order I'm coming
[1:20:37] soon I believe that with all my
[1:20:41] heart imagine if Jesus came over your
[1:20:44] house and spent a few days with
[1:20:48] you absolutely but you know what we'd
[1:20:50] have to do we'd have to stop all the
[1:20:53] things that we had planned going
[1:20:56] I mean it's easy to say no I'm busy I I
[1:20:59] I'm working I can't come to church I I
[1:21:01] don't have money to give you know this
[1:21:02] is you don't understand my circumstances
[1:21:05] you can do that but you're standing in
[1:21:07] the front of in the front of Jesus you
[1:21:09] will never do that that only shows that
[1:21:13] you don't believe he's
[1:21:17] here it's the truth which means your
[1:21:20] attitude has made this church a
[1:21:21] denominational
[1:21:23] Church how is God going to bless your
[1:21:28] home your home with that
[1:21:33] attitude be careful how you've
[1:21:35] entertained strangers no be careful how
[1:21:38] you entertain Angels some have
[1:21:40] entertained angels
[1:21:43] unawares God wants us we don't he
[1:21:46] doesn't want us to have oh yeah you're
[1:21:48] going to have an encounter today an
[1:21:49] angel is going to meet you and I you got
[1:21:51] to be on your best behavior
[1:21:54] now he wants us to be in our best
[1:21:56] behavior all the time he wants us to
[1:21:58] respect others talk to people the right
[1:22:00] way have a good attitude towards
[1:22:03] them because God is real if we want to
[1:22:06] live in a fantasy that's our business
[1:22:08] but God Still Remains
[1:22:12] real Hebrews chapter 3 we're going to
[1:22:14] have to hurry
[1:22:17] now
[1:22:20] because this election is not going past
[1:22:22] midnight you know what I'm saying
[1:22:25] Hebrews
[1:22:26] 3:4 for every house is builded by some
[1:22:29] man so every one of us is building a
[1:22:31] house I don't you to think about your
[1:22:33] house here but he he that built all
[1:22:35] things is God and that's what we want to
[1:22:37] build our house is God and Moses
[1:22:40] verely was faithful in all his house as
[1:22:44] a servant for a testimony of those
[1:22:47] things which were spoken were to be
[1:22:50] spoken
[1:22:52] after now we know Moses had a struggle
[1:22:57] in his home of circumcising his boys
[1:22:59] remember
[1:23:00] that yet today the Bible is written that
[1:23:04] he had a testimony that he was faithful
[1:23:07] in all his house as a
[1:23:12] servant now we know Moses he was a
[1:23:15] leader he was a chief commander brother
[1:23:17] Bron said he was a oneman
[1:23:21] army yet he became a servant to take
[1:23:24] care of his
[1:23:27] home he humbled himself and got his home
[1:23:30] in order when God said circumcise your
[1:23:36] children he was a
[1:23:39] leader Deuteronomy 18:15 says the Lord
[1:23:43] thy God shall raise up to thee raise up
[1:23:45] unto thee a prophet from the midst of
[1:23:48] thee of thy Brethren liken
[1:23:51] unto
[1:23:53] me unto to him you shall hearken so
[1:23:55] here's a prophecy of of of of Jesus
[1:23:58] Christ is going to be just like
[1:24:02] Moses this Prophet was Jesus Christ he
[1:24:05] was the captain of our Salvation he is
[1:24:08] the chief
[1:24:10] commander he said unless you believe I
[1:24:12] am he you're going to die in your
[1:24:14] sins but you know what he was likened
[1:24:17] unto Moses and this chief commander this
[1:24:21] captain of our Salvation he made himself
[1:24:24] of no reputation and took upon himself
[1:24:26] the form of a servant and was made in
[1:24:29] the likeness of man the Bible says he
[1:24:32] being found in the fashion of a man he
[1:24:35] humbled
[1:24:37] himself and became obedient unto death
[1:24:40] even the death of the
[1:24:43] Cross he took on the form of a servant
[1:24:46] you want to know why because he wanted
[1:24:49] brother Ron he wanted to get his house
[1:24:52] in order
[1:24:56] and you know whose house he is right we
[1:24:59] are his
[1:25:01] house in order to get his house in order
[1:25:06] he had to Humble himself doesn't the
[1:25:08] Bible say he cleansed and washed her by
[1:25:13] the water of the
[1:25:15] word that's how much he loves
[1:25:20] us now he's got a spiritual house to
[1:25:23] live in
[1:25:25] that's us brother Bron said we are the
[1:25:27] sickest body that he knew
[1:25:29] of the Holy Ghost is getting us ready
[1:25:31] for his dwelling John saw the New
[1:25:34] Jerusalem coming down it was the
[1:25:36] Tabernacle of God it was the house of
[1:25:38] God and it was man so his whole desire
[1:25:41] is to build a character in us that he
[1:25:43] could live
[1:25:46] in dwell in Hebrews 3:5 Moses verely was
[1:25:50] faithful in all his house as a servant
[1:25:52] for a testimony of those things which
[1:25:53] are spoken after verse 6 but Christ as a
[1:25:57] son over his own house whose house we
[1:26:02] are we If We Hold Fast the confidence
[1:26:08] and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto
[1:26:12] the
[1:26:14] end so what was your beginning
[1:26:17] confidence when you got saved tell me
[1:26:21] about
[1:26:21] it when you got saved
[1:26:24] you really got saved did you come into
[1:26:27] church and say well whatever happens
[1:26:32] happens did you skip five
[1:26:35] Services did you say offering whatever
[1:26:38] that's not me it's not did you just go
[1:26:41] home and continue to yell and scream and
[1:26:44] fuss and fight I mean there was a change
[1:26:47] that took place we can all testify of
[1:26:50] that I mean even praise is perfected in
[1:26:53] a babe that just comes to Christ
[1:26:55] Christ but I'm going to be perfectly
[1:26:57] honest with you Satan has done a good
[1:27:00] job to get us to lose our beginning
[1:27:04] confidence and unfortunately we're not
[1:27:07] of that group that believes once saved
[1:27:08] always saved I do believe in a
[1:27:12] predestination but if you're
[1:27:13] predestinated you will maintain you will
[1:27:16] hold you will get back you will clean
[1:27:18] your house you will get that confidence
[1:27:20] that you had at the beginning and you
[1:27:22] will keep going till this race is over
[1:27:24] you will look to the author and the
[1:27:26] finisher of your faith you will keep
[1:27:28] running this race you will be like Paul
[1:27:30] I fought a good fight I finished the
[1:27:31] course laid up for me is eternal
[1:27:38] life don't lose that don't let it slip
[1:27:40] don't let the world distract
[1:27:43] you from your confidence in
[1:27:45] Christ I'll just say like
[1:27:49] this if things have gone to the side you
[1:27:53] got a word tonight
[1:27:55] the word is set thy house in
[1:27:57] order you got a job to do look at you
[1:28:00] I'm going to say like this if we're in a
[1:28:02] backsliding condition in some fashion
[1:28:04] form way how you didn't get there
[1:28:07] through the power of the Holy
[1:28:10] Ghost and I'm going to tell you what de
[1:28:12] the devil never bypassed your free more
[1:28:16] agency and and made you do the bad
[1:28:18] things that you
[1:28:21] did you made a choice
[1:28:25] and I think God wants you to make a
[1:28:27] choice I'm going to set my house back in
[1:28:30] order God will meet you there god'll
[1:28:33] meet you there Matthew 7 ver 24 we're
[1:28:36] going to have to
[1:28:37] hurry therefore whosoever heareth the
[1:28:40] Saints of mine and do with them I will
[1:28:42] liken unto him I will liken him unto a
[1:28:44] wise man which built his house upon a
[1:28:49] rock and the rains have said the floods
[1:28:51] came the winds blew and beat upon the
[1:28:53] house and it fell not for it was founded
[1:28:55] upon a rock so how many times have you
[1:28:57] heard somebody talk about their marriage
[1:28:59] and they went through a lot they had a
[1:29:00] lot of ups and downs and you know there
[1:29:02] was times that things are just but
[1:29:04] somehow it was just kept
[1:29:07] together I'm going to say it like this
[1:29:09] trials are going to come in our
[1:29:11] life problems are going to penetrate our
[1:29:14] home they're going to want to rock the
[1:29:17] home if you make sure that your decision
[1:29:21] making is based on this word you will be
[1:29:24] able to stand the
[1:29:26] test but if you get off and you leave
[1:29:28] Christ and Well church don't matter this
[1:29:31] don't matter that don't matter I don't
[1:29:33] care I can't deal with it right now you
[1:29:35] start having that attitude there is you
[1:29:37] have no
[1:29:39] promise that's
[1:29:42] foolish how many people have been
[1:29:46] Shipwrecked everyone that heareth the
[1:29:48] sayings of mine and doeth them not shall
[1:29:52] be liken unto a foolish man which buildt
[1:29:53] his house upon the
[1:29:55] sand the rang just said the floods came
[1:29:57] the winds blew and what happened it beat
[1:30:00] upon the house and it
[1:30:02] fell and not only that it said and great
[1:30:07] was the fall of it great was the fall of
[1:30:12] it Joshua 24:14 if we could put that up
[1:30:15] Joshua
[1:30:17] 24:14 just bear with
[1:30:20] me now therefore
[1:30:24] the
[1:30:25] Lord It's that simple be honest with
[1:30:28] yourself serve him in sincerity doesn't
[1:30:32] matter what your your kids speak your
[1:30:34] your your your parents think it it
[1:30:36] doesn't matter what your spouse thinks
[1:30:38] make a decision for your own heart serve
[1:30:41] him in sincerity and in truth put
[1:30:45] away the
[1:30:48] gods which your father
[1:30:51] served on the other side of the flood
[1:30:54] and in Egypt and make a decision to
[1:30:57] serve the
[1:30:59] Lord and if it seemed evil unto you to
[1:31:01] serve the Lord then choose you this day
[1:31:04] whom you will
[1:31:05] serve whether it's the gods which your
[1:31:07] father served that were on the other
[1:31:10] side of the flood or the gods of the
[1:31:11] amorites in whose land you
[1:31:13] dwell but as for
[1:31:16] me and my house we will serve the
[1:31:22] Lord a a conscious decision made and you
[1:31:27] know
[1:31:27] what I need my daughter I need my wife
[1:31:31] to hold me
[1:31:33] accountable I need you the sheep of the
[1:31:36] pastor to hold the pastor
[1:31:45] accountable I need to want to know am I
[1:31:49] offending you hurting
[1:31:51] you displeasing you am I missing the
[1:31:54] Lord am I grieving him do you see
[1:31:57] something in my life that just needs to
[1:31:59] be dealt
[1:32:01] with that's what it means
[1:32:05] sincerity serving the lord isn't coming
[1:32:08] to church and just saying this is I
[1:32:09] believe the message and you kind of go
[1:32:11] home and live the life that you want to
[1:32:12] live that is not serving the
[1:32:17] lord we choose Christ every day of Our
[1:32:21] Lives
[1:32:24] we choose to serve him every day in
[1:32:30] sincerity but if we have let things come
[1:32:32] between us and God then it's real simple
[1:32:35] make a decision to clean your house to
[1:32:38] set the house in order we need a good
[1:32:42] cleaning the Bible says be confident of
[1:32:44] this very thing that he which had begun
[1:32:46] a good work in you shall perform it so
[1:32:49] God promised to finish a spiritual work
[1:32:52] that he started with you at the
[1:32:53] beginning
[1:32:55] of course we just read that there's
[1:32:57] something that we've got to do we've got
[1:32:59] to hold our beginning confidence
[1:33:02] steadfast we've got to we can't let it
[1:33:04] go and expect God to keep his end of the
[1:33:07] promise we got to clean our act
[1:33:11] up now Paul who who really wrote that in
[1:33:14] Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 he said
[1:33:18] what we need to do in chapter
[1:33:21] 3 he said not as though I've already
[1:33:24] attained either we're already perfect
[1:33:25] but I follow after if I may apprehend
[1:33:28] that for which also I'm apprehended of
[1:33:29] Jesus Christ Brethren I count not myself
[1:33:32] to have apprehended but this one thing I
[1:33:34] do I forget those things which are
[1:33:36] behind me and I reach forth towards
[1:33:38] those things which are
[1:33:40] before you know too many people want to
[1:33:42] look at that promise God's going to
[1:33:44] finish the work that he
[1:33:45] started and so they just want to feel
[1:33:47] they've
[1:33:49] attained they've already attained
[1:33:51] because God promised to finish the work
[1:33:54] but that's not really what Paul's saying
[1:33:56] Paul's saying I press toward the mark in
[1:34:00] other words that's my beginning
[1:34:01] confidence when I got saved I went to
[1:34:03] church said Lord I want to serve you I
[1:34:04] want to know about you I want to walk
[1:34:06] here's my commitment here's my
[1:34:10] vows Paul's saying after 33 years he's
[1:34:15] got the same testimonies he did when he
[1:34:16] first got
[1:34:17] saved I press toward the mark for the
[1:34:21] prize of the High Calling of God and
[1:34:23] Christ Jesus let us therefore as many as
[1:34:27] be perfect be thus minded and if
[1:34:30] any and if anything you be otherwise
[1:34:35] minded God shall reveal even this to
[1:34:41] you I trust that we have ears to hear
[1:34:43] what the spirit is saying to the church
[1:34:45] let's Stand
[1:34:48] Together set thy house in order
[1:34:55] in other
[1:34:56] words press toward the
[1:35:03] Mark Press towards the
[1:35:14] mark the only real peace

[1:35:25] only real
