in the word now and give you the praise for all these things in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen in numbers if you would turn with me into Numbers Chapter 13 we're going to read a portion of scriptures uh from when the 10 spies uh or the the 12 Spies I'm sorry went into the promised land and came back with uh a report amen and we're going to start with verse number 23 if we could Numbers Chapter 13 starting with verse number 23 and they came unto the brook of ishol and cut down from then a branch with one cluster of grapes and they bear it between two upon a staff and they brought of the pomegranat and the Fig can you imagine going to to to Meyers and and getting some grapes that it took two men and a staff to carry them out of Meyers these were huge the place was called uh the place was called The Brook escroll because of the cluster of grapes which the children of Israel cut down from then and they returned from searching of the land after 40 days and they went and came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the children of Israel unto the Wilderness pan to cadesh and brought back word unto them and unto all the congregation and showed them the fruit of the land and they told them and said we came unto the land whether thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it and it would have been good if they would have closed the book and ministered on that but nevertheless the people be strong uh that dwell in the land and the cities are walled and very great and moreover we saw the children of anoch there and the alites dwelt in the land of the South and the Hittites and the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the Mountains and the Canaan IED Dr by the Sea and by the coast of Jordan it just kind of seemed to be flooded with Giants and Caleb stealed the people and Moses and said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it but the men that went up with him said we be not able to go up against the people for they are stronger than we and they brought up an evil report of the land which they had searched unto the children of Israel saying the land uh through which we have gone to search it is a land that eateth up the inhabitants thereof and all the people that we saw in it uh are men of great statue and there we saw the Giants and the sons of anoch which come to come of the Giants and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers and so we were in theirs in their sight amen God bless you you may be seated I tell you this was quite quite a story we want to entitle this we are uh uh well able to overcome amen but before we get to that part I if we could just you know kind of get a background of this uh God's people had come out of Egypt and they spied out the land that God had promised them now the land that uh God brought them out of was Egypt and and they were going to the promised land now these were two different lands and if I could say it like this they represent two different Natures spiritually it was the same Earth occupied by two different groups of people just like the same soul is occupied by two different Natures are you with me now Egypt represent presents a man born with a selfish worldly nature and he's held captive to it and the children of Israel were under the taskmasters of Egypt and man is under the Taskmaster of a selfish nature he ends up doing only what his flesh wants to do both the Hebrews in Egypt and every man that's unconverted are both in bondage uh we we read Paul said for the good that I would do I do not but the evil which I would not do that I end up doing now if I do that which I would not it is no more I but sin that dwelleth in me and I find that a law that when I would go to do good evil is present with me so there is this uncontrollable law of that's inside a man and it brings him into bondage and that's why we got to be born again as there was no freedom for the Hebrews in Egypt there's no freedom for any human being until Jesus sets them free and he that the son is set free is free indeed now when the Hebrews or the children of Israel were set free in Egypt that represented justification to every believer the very fact that they came out of Egypt were set free from the Egyptians that represents justification just as if they were never in bondage God set him free didn't say were you good or bad he just sets them free nobody is worthy to be saved amen amen now they both rejoiced they both looked forward to the promised land when the children of Israel got out of Egypt they were dancing around and they were rejoicing that they were set free and they were thinking about the promise that God had promised them a promised land they weren't going to stay there they weren't going to stay by Egypt they weren't going to stay in the world they were going to go to what God had promised them and so is every believer that when he he gets saved he's he's excited he he wants to go tell everybody I remember when I first got saved I had to tell everybody that I was saved it was just exciting but a Justified believer may be forgiven and he may be set free from his past sins and sometimes even things change in his life but he is not completely free yet and this is important to understand just like the children of Israel were not completely free they were not completely free but they were Justified now if if God would have came right then and there in that state they would make it but God gave them a space of time to prove whether they really would love God or not and it was during that time of proving that they proved that they did not love God first so they weren't completely set free that's why there was a promised land and when you entered that Promised Land you were completely free he amen amen now the next they go through the Wilderness and just like the children of Israel went through the Wilderness every believer goes through this experience and this experience is really it's a type of sanctification which most people do not make it through this process most people that get Justified do not make it through the process of sanctification this process is really set to prepare us for the promis land it cleanses up our ugly nature it makes us worthy to enter in it tries us it proves us to see whether we're going to be faithful or Unfaithful whether we're going to be half committed or or all the way committed that's what this process does you've heard the saying before you can take a man out of Egypt but you can't take the Egypt out of the man so there's certain things you can you can take a man out of a you know he's been hanging in the bar all this time and you finally say okay we're going to make a deal you're not going to be in the bar anymore but still inside of them he wants to be there and the children of Israel even though they left Egypt there was many of them who wanted to go back they were mindful of the things they they they thought about the things that were easier and better because this this this sanctification process or this Wilderness process it it's it's not an easy process to go through through and the children of Israel they begin to murmur the Bible say they begin to complain about their situations and their circumstances and their conditions and they even wanted a different leadership here the leadership just stood in the Gap through these 10 plagues and did all this work to get them to come out of the world they were set free they were real happy and all of a sudden this same leader they started having a problem with they wanted different leadership a different Captain somebody to take him back in in in a different direction for their life we see that so many times with people who come into the Lord and and they get started and you work real hard and all of a sudden they go through this process and they don't want you anymore they don't want the leadership anymore this is no different that when a Believer has been Justified saved he's saved and if he died at that point he'd make it but if he continues to walk on then what happens when you tell somebody that God wants to save you God wants to deliver you from these habits God wants to give you Joy God wants to give you peace God wants to fill your life with love get to a place where you can love others that that once that you hated now this becomes really exciting for person who's never experienced that and when they ex they repent they get baptized they accept Jesus Christ as their savior they're they're good but what happens through the process of the Wilderness sanctification when you you know you're sitting you're listening to the word and hear the word being preached and the word says you got to do this and you need to do this and you need to make sure about this and love your love one another and all these things they begin to lose focus of their Promised Land and they begin to saywell this you know nothing seems to change when I come to church everything just I still got problems and they lose focus of their Promised Land because they feel I'm saved and that's all they're looking at and you it's hard to go through through a sanctification process if all you're doing is looking at I'm saved you've got to see yourself as needy as I need God in my life I need I I I Can See Clearly how my nature is not pleasing to God and I need him so what happens to a lot of people when they don't keep their eyes on the promised land I'm going to tell you what the promised land is for the believer it is a complete nature change and I'm going to back that up here as we go through the scriptures it's a complete nature change that's what God promised the believer but because people don't focus on that and it becomes too hard this process and the trials and oh yeah I got to give up this and I gotta I got to be faithful and they're learning all these things and it becomes too hard you know what they become satisfied with their nature they become satisfied with it's okay that I have this nature that isn't quite like God and so they just learn to get used used to it are you with me and instead of focusing on the nature change they began to murmur about the things they have to go through the things they have to to do they begin to complain even complain about the preaching complain and make excuses and and uh why they don't believe and why they're not being faithful they begin to make excuses amen it is no different than the children of Israel what happened to them and they wander around in the wilderness process exercising their own will I don't have to do that I can do what I want to do you know you think about the scripture tells us about all the things they were murmuring and complaining about but you know God saw their thoughts which was much greater and there's so many people that are walking around in this process of of sanctification God's trying to prove them are you going to be faithful or not and they they don't seem to care they they they seem to be just satisfied with where they're at they're saved they're not even looking at the promised land anymore because they feel they got the Holy Ghost I'll say this part you have a portion of the Holy Ghost because brother brandham said justification is a portion of the Holy Ghost and I know brother Brandon said that the Holy Ghost is the promised land but it's more than the promised land because when you're Justified you have part of the Holy Ghost because that that was God that came down and delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt that was God that was God that saves the purpose that is the Holy Ghost that's God in you but that ain't the Promised Land brother darl said it's the most miserable place for a Believer to be is one foot in and one foot out halfhearted half committed the Wilderness you can't make up your mind I'm going into the promised land but you look you don't want to do that because it's too hard to get the nature change they're Giants standing in your way the giant ugly nature that don't want you don't want to crucify and you don't you don't want you know not to go back into Egypt because you know that's not right so you're stuck in the middle being what miserable miserable too many Believers remain in the wilderness content that their past sins have been forgiven but they don't want to labor at all to enter into the promised land now we're told in the book of of of Peter that an entrance shall be ministered unto you how to get in there but you've got to take the word and believe it for your personal life no matter what anybody else does we've got to get out of Leo DEA that that that that habit of just hearing the word and doing nothing with the word when you go home that to me is being stuck in leoda but God has a promised land now what is the Promised Land represent we're told it's the Holy Ghost but it's more than the Holy Ghost if Egypt represents a man born with a selfish worldly nature and held captive the propest land represents a man with God's nature do you see how you can have the Holy Ghost and not have God's nature and the the the message is is threaded with quotes from brother Brandon saying well if you got the Holy Ghost you'll do the same thing that God did it's threaded throughout because people say they got the Holy Ghost because they spoke in tongues or they did this or they did that and and they're ignoring the nature change so that's why I say the promised land is more than just the Holy Ghost because everybody's got a portion of it but the true promised land that you enter in is when you defeat the giants that are in in your life that are standing in the way from God coming in and reigning and ruling in your heart amen it takes the new birth it certainly does but it takes overcoming the giants that are standing in the way we have to fight we have to overcome that ugly nature first just like the children of Israel had fight it first before they entered in see it was no problem coming out of Egypt because God did all the work now God was saying I you want that you better believe for it you have to believe but they with their intellectual understanding said well I'm this big the Giants are that big and and they they they were using that instead of God promised it for some reason these Giants were such a much harder problem for God than taking out pharaoh and all of Egypt imagine how the devil can take the human mind over a period of time and begin to doubt God's ability Hebrews 4:9 says that there remain therefore a rest for the people of God been Justified been Sanctified there's there remains a rest for the people of God for he that has entered into his rest he has also ceased from his own works as God did from his and of course there could be a whole message that we could speak on this right now but you know we we do everything that we can to kind of control our temper and be careful about this and watch that I don't do that and all that's and I I shouldn't it's like we're working to be a Christian but when you enter into the promised land to where you give God control control inside of you now you have ceased from your works it's no longer you but it's Christ in me the hope of glory he's the one that's handling all this stuff and verse 11 says let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief now brother brandom taught us that that rest is the word of God you rest in the word it's when you and the word become one look if you're in if you are if God's got his arms wrapped around you what do you have to fear no matter what's happening on the outside but when you're not in his arms Jesus is in the boat and you're slipping in the water and you're Jesus see there's that distance but he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the end that is that rest that's the word of God you're resting on God's word he cannot lie not come short we enter into the word of God what that means is it becomes manifested in our life we no longer quote it we no longer think about it and then we don't think about it but you and the word become one so we can say that that this rest is also the promised land rest it is the nature change like many of us used to smoke and drink we don't do that anymore we could say we smoke and drink as much as we want to because we don't want to because God don't want to see we've entered into that but there's more for us because we're talking about a complete nature change so don't be satisfied with a partial change Hebrews 3:7 says God was grieved 40 years with the children of Israel and their carcasses fell in the wilderness and they could not enter into the promised land rest because of their unbelief right they they not denying that they were saved that God saved them out of they never denied that God saved them out of Egypt but they did not continue you to go onto the promised land and and as brothers and sisters in Christ as Sons and Daughters of God we must understand that God has something more for us amen and the devil's doing everything he can the news is doing everything it can the problems in the world the problems in her home the problems in her life our financial our bank account everything is pointing us to distract us away from the nature change that's the true promise for us don't say I've got the Holy Ghost don't say that don't say that don't say that as an excuse Paul said I press towards the Mark I haven't attained he said I it isn't as I've attained or I I'm I'm I'm there he says but I'm pressing what was he pressing the Mark what's the Mark it's the image of Christ it's the it's the nature of God inside of man he could have I've got so many Mysteries you know God using me to write the New Testament he had so many things to stand on to put his credentials to put his badge out there to say he's got the he's got it but you know what that wasn't his Spirit it wasn't his attitude it was just I need more I know there's more for me and we've read the scripture therefore If any man be in Christ he is a new creature old things are passed away and behold all things are become new and all things are of God now that is a complete nature change you know I I've never seen the spirit in in the message as far as the message that brother Brandon preached that he had already attained never seen that never seen that but you know the devil preaches that to us you don't need to do anymore you don't you look at you already got the holy ghost that way we you know we don't we don't talk about we don't battle we don't we don't we don't question it we don't we're not we're not going to sit here and debate who's got we just you know we all got it okay we all got it let's rejoice in that I'm great with that but I am not great with being satisfied with where we're at when God has called us to be just like him there's the difference don't fall after the same example of unbelief there was no doubt that the promised land surely flowed with milk and honey the fruit clusters were so heavy it took two men to carry him we all got that testimony of how great God is but the obstacles that stood in their way from enjoying it was too big for even God to handle that was their testimony Canaanites Philistines Hittites uh hivites genus sites amorites jebusites mobites they're all Giants and they all took different parts of the promis land if you think about our nature in certain areas you know we can just lose it right Giants that get in the way from the love of God just pouring out and they testified that all the people that they saw in it are of great statue sometimes we look at the problems that we have in our life and they're of great statue we've had them since we were a kid and to think that we can get to a place that we could think like the children of Israel yeah I know God saved me I know that I don't doubt that I don't question that but I don't think he can change my nature to be just like him that's exactly what the children of Israel were saying we were in our own sight as Grasshoppers and so we were in their sight don't fall after the same example of unbelief don't wander around thinking that things in your life are are too big for God to handle that our bad habits got a stronghold in our life and nothing can change that you'll be thinking that things are going to be so so permanent your life that they're never your nature is never going to change don't think like that because that is falling after the same example of unbelief don't ever be thinking you're always going to have these habits smoking swearing drinking pornography being judgmental or critical or finding faults with others getting upset short-tempered easily bothered getting angry yelling blowing your top being selfish wanting life to be about you being lazy uncaring Unfaithful murmuring complaining about things I put in there the preacher the preaching I mean these things can seem like well they just kind of everybody has them and you know everybody's GNA it's like as long as you maintain that attitude you're not focusing on the nature change it'd be better off to say Lord I know these things exist they've been here a while they seem to be Giants because I've asked you to take him many times you have got to have faith that you're going to become just like him amen that's just what the word says don't be thinking that you're always going to be the same always stuck with these Giants in my nature nobody okay nobody wants to deal with with their the their problems their habits nobody wants to deal with their bad nature we just ass soon brush it off throw it under the rug you know try to put on our best behavior and and and forget about it but it's still there don't allow yourself to think an evil report about not building God's nature in yourself that's what we're here for that's why we come to church that's why we pray that's why we read the Bible that's why we listen to the tapes because we want to be more like Jesus amen don't allow an evil heart of unbelief in departing from the Living God thought you know when we first met God it was real to us he was alive he was living we know because we just felt clean and we felt Victory and we felt free and we felt that God loved us and we again in this Wilderness experience and we get distant from God and we start you know we continue to go to church we continue to do certain things but it's not as real and we start serving a dead letter I believe this I'm in the message a dead letter God doesn't want us to serve a dead letter it God wants it to be alive inside of us real Hebrews 3:14 says for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end am in other words God's got to continue to be alive in her life what was the beginning confidence that the children of Israel had their beginning confidence was that I'm taking you out of Egypt because I have promised you a land that was their that was their beginning confidence obviously to the Wilderness experience they lost that confidence and they began to give up and they even add an attitude you know what we'll serve God on this side didn't that they say that we don't need to go over we'll just we'll serve God over here we'll build our we we'll build here this will be our land but that wasn't the land that God promised them a lot of Believers get like that what was our beginning confidence yes we were told that God will give us the Holy Ghost that's what the Bible says repent be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost but we didn't quite know what that meant we didn't quite know what that meant and we come to church and we read more and then we see you know after we get the Holy Ghost we get power Jesus said you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost comes upon you power over what over not just casting Devils out of somebody else but casting the Devils out of yourself Romans 8:29 says for whom he did Forno he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many of us amen we're going to be just like him I can't do that by my works I got to cease from my works I know what my Works do they get me in trouble 1 John 3:2 beloved now are are we the sons of God and it so we're yes we're a child of God we're saved and it but it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know by Revelation right there's something inside that's been spoken to us from the word that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and I love this third verse every man that has this hope hope in him purifies himself even as he's pure so he's working he's saying yes to the process God I I mean I'm thankful for every dose of holy ghost that he's given me and I could never deny any of it I would never want anybody to deny anything that God has given them but I do know this that there is more for me and we need more preaching there's more for us because this this age and every every movie we see every show we see every commercial every everywhere we go there's nothing being presented to us but hey whatever you want you just whatever have a good one nothing is telling us to press towards there except God only I know if if we could like have a camp meeting here for like three months straight and we have service every night we just have preachers coming in from everywhere I'll tell you we'd be doing good at the end of those three months but you know the the the denial that we'd have to put on our flesh to get here and do that but it is the word that changes us right the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 3:18 but we all with open face beholding in a glass glass the glory of the Lord are changed changed and what are we changed we're changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord don't depend on yourself to get changed don't depend on your ability to take the word that's being preached and say yeah I I I somehow want that to happen no God you just spoke your word and I believe it bring it to pass is by faith God is the one that changes us too much intellectual and not enough just faith and respect for the word of God Amen for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning confidence steadfast unto the end I think this is what we need to encourage one another with we're going to make it keep pressing you know the Bible says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together and all the more as you see the day approaching why because evil is on an increase and we need to combat it right you overcome evil with good God has more for us our opening scriptures and they told him and said we came unto the land where thou sent us and surely it floweth with milk and honey and this is the fruit of it nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the land the people be strong the habits that we have are strong the cities are walled I I can't even get it I don't know why I'm doing what I'm doing but very great and moreover he saw we saw that the children of anoch there and the amalekites dwell in the land of the South and the Hittites the jebusites and the amorites dwell in the mountains and the Canaanites dwell by the Sea and the and by the coast of Jordan it just it just kind of seems that there's we as humans got a lot of problems we we we were born in sin the Bible says shapen in iniquity so you know what you you get this Clump you put it on the on the wheel and you start to shape it you and you mold it and all through our life we are are we got a spirit inside of us that says no I'm not going to listen to you Mom I'm not gonna listen to you Dad I don't have to give that back I know I told you that but I'm not doing anyways and our whole life becomes shapen in iniquity knowing what to do but you decide you're not going to do it and they begin to mold Us in such a thing that we feel like we got such a terrible nature sometimes if we really take a look at what the word tells us that we're supposed to be and Caleb stealed the people before Moses and said let us go up at once don't have a meeting about it let's go and possess it for we are well able to overcome it what an attitude now I I I don't mean it wrong but what did those two have that the others didn't they went through the Wilderness saw the same experiences were in the same camp for 40 years hearing all the murmuring complaining every time they went to church what what made them have this mindset look we're we're well able we're well able we're equipped let's go they must have been staring at only one thing the promise of God because everything else said no way we're more than able to overcome the old nature that we have inside of us let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it what is it it was the Giants obviously that were standing in the way of the land that God said this is yours and we're like this hey if it's ours God I don't want these guys these guys shouldn't be here on the land that you're giv me this can't be what you're giving me but God promised I'm going to come into you in that day you'll know that I'm in you and you and me there's going to be a meeting place amen but you know what God is not going to gift that to anybody you've got to hate your ugly nature as much as God does and when you hate those things so bad that you're willing to to sacrifice and spend more time with God and seek more of the Holy Ghost and say God I need more of you then God will come on the scene because he promised to do it amen we get to this place where we just come completely satisfied that we're in the message we lost sight of what we're supposed to be just calling oursel the bride and it doesn't matter if we're acting like it or not I say to the bride let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to take it what is it the giant thing things in our worldly nature that are standing in the way from receiving all that God has promised us look we got a prophecy some time ago and it's just as real as if it was just said because I just believe it's the word of God and he said if God said if you would come together and pray for one another if you would seek my face if you would come under the word he said I will do things that you have not not not seen before not experienced before now why would God say that why don't God just do them because we all want him to do them don't we but God ain't G to just do it until you're willing to humble yourself cry out to him and start doing the easy things that we can be doing pray for one another help one another have a burden for one another act like a body act like it's more about you in your life it's about coming in with a heart to help somebody then God will honor that and I think it's the same way with any that we want to see changed in our life if we want more love I think we can get more love if we want more peace we can get more peace we got to you know the devil's trying to put our mind and everything and and God says keep our mind stayed on him that gives us peace so there's a battle you got to fight that battle we are well able to overcome our old nature I believing the promises of God's word by laboring to enter into that rest as the scripture tells us brother BR said Faith final resting places in the word of God that's right and don't wait to understand it don't wait to even you feel bubbly about it just say I believe it that settles it you know it's it kind of just put the the draw bar down that the devil can't come in and give you entertaining thoughts of Doubt God cannot lie he cannot come short he cannot fall he his word will not return void we can stand on the word of God it's the only thing we have I don't mean it wrong but there's only so much we can do to rely on one another we can't we can't get anybody over brother Bri says nobody can make it on somebody else's shirt tail right we need God and we need to get serious about believing the word of God the word says we can be like him then we can be like him if we're changed from service to service then I want to see a change in me God's word is for ever settled to Heaven it will not return un void Heaven and Earth will pass away but my words shall never pass away we are well able to overcome our old nature we're well able to do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me you got a big hard task in front of you and you know it just looks so big I don't know if you ever had one of those projects that seemed so big the way to do it is just one piece at a time one piece at a time got a big pile of dirt to move one shovel full at a time you got a big nature that I just not happy with anything in my life one thing at a time just start seeking the Lord one thing at a time we are well able to overcome because we have a God that's greater in us the god that's in US is greater than the god that's in our worldly nature you know brother BR preached that message possessing the enemy's Gates and it takes some possession you can't just be thinking about whatever you want and allowing lots of things to float around and expect to be in control but you've got to believe there's it's like you know brother R talking about that white dog and the black dog and and he asked the old Indian he says well who's winning in that fight of of of that Christian fight that you're having and he said whoever I feed the most and so if you're you're you're you're feeding the inside part which brother baham said the Holy Ghost feeds on the word the Holy Ghost In You feeds on the word and if you want it to grow you give it the word and when you get the word faith cometh by hearing the word you get more faith and you begin to grow and if you just are satisfied with being in the wilderness I'm saved I know I got the Holy Ghost and ignoring to become more like Jesus in fact you just make excuses for every time you mess up I am not preaching human Perfection and I'm not saying we can be perfect what I am saying is we can have a perfect attitude there was something that Caleb had that the others didn't had a different Spirit the the Bible tells us don't fall after the same example of unbelief hold your beginning confence just go back go back spend some time going back to when you first got saved what was on your mind what was on your mind is I want to make God happy I I want to please him I I I I want to learn about him I want to discover who God is I want I want to know more about them and it was just real and then as we go through this process of sanctification we come to church we hear this word and says we need to stop doing this and we need to do that and you need to do that and it's like oh I don't want to do that and you fall in the wilderness you fall in the wilderness so we got to hold the beginning confidence not today's confidence the beginning God wants the beginning praise is perfected in babes don't try to make it any better just praise him with all your heart because that's what babes do don't let God's word slip through your fingers like grains of s as Ray Boltz would say don't let the word just h no that's God speaking to you so we need to fear the lord we need to respect the word more we need to believe the word no matter what it says Hebrews 4:1 says let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of what of entering into his rest Les let us uh being left us of entering into with any of you should seem to come short of it and I like the way that said that any of you seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them because was not mixed with faith when they heard the preaching they oh well when's the service going to be over I'm getting you know you know what I mean it's just it's not real and I understand that you know we watch so much TV we see so many things on videos we we have to have so much action going around that if the preaching just isn't you know the way that you know we'd like it you know then it's just hard to get into it and I'm sorry the word should have nothing to do about how it's presented right the word is the word amen either you're in love with the word or you're in love at how it's presented is be honest God did not promise to just give us enough Holy Ghost to justify us unto salvation I believe that every one of us that we that every human being not us every human being that ever repented sincerely um got baptized I believe at that moment they were saved because that's just what the word says if they're sincere they follow the word the God's not going to lie but see here's the thing that's why a lot of people don't get filled with the Holy Ghost right away God gives them a chance to prove how much they're going at the Bible says God gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey him that you said brother bman in the men's meeting God gives the Holy Ghost to them obey him well let's see if that man's going to obey let's see if that woman's going to obey let's give him some time let's see what happens let's give him the word to much is given much is required let's see can he do more can he do more and if he completely has follen the word that the one that God wants to fill and it's that simple you know we we we we've made everything so complicated because we have to defend oursel forget about defending yourself just be like Jesus have that attitude of I want to be more like him no matter how much I am like him I want to be more like him so I I don't care you know this what I love about Paul and serving the lord years was he was our example he said follow me as I follow Christ but yet he never acted like he was there he you could put him next to a new believer like Timothy and you could tell that both would have the same attitude I want to be more like Jesus when it comes to that nature we should all be the same all be the same like it just does not matter how long we've been serving the lord or how holy we are or how high we are or what whatever that that may be we all are the same wanting to be more like Jesus that's what God wants out of us God promised us a land that floweth with milk and honey and lots of fruit and our fruit of the promised land is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance now to me this kind of culminates the nature of God and that's why the Bible calls this the fruit of the spirit and this is the promised land this isn't us saying oh yeah that's what the Holy Ghost is this is what I must become yes this is the nature that must get inside of me and in order for that to happen there's certain giants that are standing in the way you know I'm selfish I'm not gonna I'm just not going to give up my time I'm I'm just not going to pray that much I'm just going to do this and that's it well how how is how is God gonna say yeah I'm so happy with that attitude I'm just going to give you love I'm just going to give you peace about I'm going to give you Joy you're going to be so patient now no we have to take care of the Giants we have a part to play and I just say it has everything to do with your attitude and nothing to do with your ability amen and look at the rest of that verse says against such there is no giant that will be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life you got that I don't care what the you are the Fulfillment of the law when you got the Fulfillment of God in you Galatians 524 and they that are Christ now this is just said right after the fruits of the spirit and they that are Christ they they've crucified the flesh with the affections and the lust and these are pretty big giants don't you think he says if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of something for ourself or just provoking one another or just envying one another you understand that is the wrong nature that's the thing that we were born with we weren't taught to do that that just naturally happens by aspect by leaving the Giants there amen so we got to get serious about getting these things out of our life we can't have the nature of God flowing through us when we're Walking In the Flesh in carnality of our mind we all got giant problems with our nature but Caleb had something inside of him he stilled the negative attitude that was around him and we need to steal the negative attitude that's around our mind this this thing that's just negative like I think anything that tells you that you can't be just like Jesus is a negative report it's an evil report you need get that you need to steal that just nope I'm not going to think about that that's that's what Caleb's attitude was he stealed the people that were around him and he said let us go up at once and possess it for we are well able to overcome it turn with me if you would to numbers 14 oh you know this I I just had a really a few notes compared to almost half the notes that I did from Sunday and I can't believe that I'm still not getting through my notes it just doesn't matter how many I we're just going to trust the Lord numbers 14:19 now this is the very next chapter and start with 14 pardon I beseech Thee the iniquity of this people according unto the greatness of thy mercy and as thou has forgiven this people from Egypt even until now so here's this interceding going in that that was pleading out to God that he would have mercy upon these people who were murmuring complaining being disobedient and this is what the Lord said in verse 20 he said I have pardoned according to Thy word if this was your prayer you're interceding for the people in the church I will pardon them according to Thy word but as truly as I live all the Earth shall be filled with the glory of the Lord because all those men which have seen my glory and my Miracles which I did in Egypt and in the wilderness and have tempted me now these 10 times and have not hearkened to my voice I wonder how many times we've walked out of church and ignored the word of God that's a that's that's tempting the Lord and when we don't hearken to his voice when we don't get serious about the word he said surely they shall not see the promised land which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoked me see it now that's pretty strong but colon but my servant Caleb because he had another spirit with him and [Music] what was this spirit all about and have followed me fully he wasn't half in and half out him will I bring into the land wherein he went and his seed shall possess it so this is why I say here we are there's millions of people that go to church people are in the message lots of people only God knows who's who there's three types of Believers in every Church and I just say it like this forget your reputation forget forget everything except one thing seek to be like Jesus God will take care of everything else because if we don't follow him fully there is going to be a group who don't go on rapture we know that and did you know a big part of that group are people who made it through a Sanctified Wilderness there were 10 virgins five were foolish five were wise the five that were foolish they lived good clean lives the only difference so they made it through that process they didn't murmur they didn't complain they accepted it they liveed good clean lives but there were still a nature that was inside that they could maybe harness but it was still there and they didn't go on to get the Holy Ghost those are the ones that didn't go on Rapture they're called foolish virgins there is a a foolish people who do not take the word seriously and look we're all we got here we we need to encourage one another to get serious about the word that's it get serious about the world get serious about getting to be more like Jesus it is nothing you know becoming like Jesus is not something it's not like going to some um you know some Seminary or seminar I'm sorry and you get you know all uh worked up with some great swelling words positive yeah we need something that's real and and what God wants to see in US is he wants to see us get real with the word and so every one of us are in different areas God's dealing with us God may be dealing with me with something that he's not dealing with you about and vice versa and we we need to get serious about that that's that's important to God because it's what he wants and he deserves it yeah and I'll just say it like this if we copy the spirit that Caleb Joshua had copy it don't provoke the Lord don't grieve the Lord just follow the word fully whatever the word says just start doing it start making sacrifices for it when I think about you think about the children of Israel they're murmuring they're complaining you know they had a you know 1,800,000 strong you know we're going to win the election we're going in the promised land but you don't know they didn't know Jesus was the final answer whether they were going they got up to it they realized what it was said we can't do it now I'll say this if for 40 years they would have been practicing Christianity if they would have been practicing believing the word okay there there's no water I believe in God he's going to take care of it there's no food God's going to take care of it I'm not going to complain about the manner that I'm getting I'm just going to trust God if they had faith in their experiences in the wilderness when they got there they would have been prepared to enter into the the nature of God do we got we don't we don't we don't we don't and you get some time if you would read John 14 I got verses 15- 27 but in these verses this is where God said that that I'm that I'm going to come into you and you're going to come into me and we're going to be one and this is what it means to have the nature of God we come into Christ we enter into Christ If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things that become new and Christ comes into us and he starts to take a greater control and this is the realness of entering into the holy spirit because that yeah that is the promise but it's it's it's in this land right God Wants You are the Temple of the Holy Ghost God wants to have preeminence here he doesn't want to be out here only he wants to be inside of us amen so we are able well able to overcome well able what does that mean able it means we're equipped that means we're capable we're qualified God has qualified us we're trained we're skilled we're powered to overcome we we're well a to overcome now look there's only one thing I could get you to do is believe the word because that's the only thing that's going to change you you've got to believe the word is going to change you let's Stand Together God bless you for your patience greater is he that's in you than in your worldly nature How great is our God
