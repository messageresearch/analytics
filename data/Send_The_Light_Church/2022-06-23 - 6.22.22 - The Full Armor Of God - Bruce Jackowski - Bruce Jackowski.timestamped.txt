[32:59] beginning of months

[33:06] israel saying in the tenth day of this
[33:08] month
[33:09] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[33:11] according to the house of their fathers
[33:14] a lamb fern house and if the household
[33:16] be too little for the lamb let him and
[33:19] his neighbor next unto his house take it
[33:21] according to the number of the souls
[33:24] every man according to his eating shall
[33:26] make your count for the lamb
[33:28] your lamb shall be without blemish a
[33:30] male of the first year you shall take it
[33:33] out from the sheep or from the goats and
[33:35] you shall keep it up until the
[33:36] fourteenth day of the same month
[33:39] and the whole assembly of the
[33:40] congregation of israel shall kill it in
[33:42] the evening and they shall take of the
[33:44] blood and strike it on the two side
[33:46] posts and on the upper doorpost of the
[33:48] house
[33:50] wherein they shall eat it and they shall
[33:52] eat the flesh and that night roast with
[33:54] fire and unleavened bread and with
[33:57] bitter herbs they shall eat it
[34:00] eat not of it raw nor sodden nor all
[34:02] with water but roast with fire his head
[34:05] with his legs and with the pertinence
[34:07] thereof and you shall let nothing of it
[34:10] remain until the morning and that which
[34:12] remaineth of it until the morning ye
[34:14] shall burn with fire and thus shall you
[34:17] eat it with your loins skirted your

[35:48] had wars and rumors of wars and not too
[35:50] many hours ago we just had a great major
[35:53] earthquake in afghanistan a thousand
[35:55] people lost their lives
[35:57] just
[35:58] wiped them out gone
[36:01] so he said so we've had earthquakes and
[36:02] we've had wars and rumors of wars and we
[36:04] have this
[36:06] military operation in ukraine and if
[36:09] you've seen some of the pictures i mean
[36:11] the believers
[36:13] best we know all the believers have been
[36:15] safe
[36:16] but
[36:17] russia's just i mean if you want to take
[36:19] over some country why would you
[36:21] completely destroy the country before
[36:23] you take it over i want to take over
[36:25] fenton i'm not going to just bomb it to
[36:27] smithereens
[36:28] so it shows the insanity
[36:32] of the world
[36:34] amen
[36:35] so we've had wars and rumors of wars and
[36:37] we've had tidal waves as jesus said
[36:40] would be the sea roaring men's hearts
[36:42] failing and more heart trouble number
[36:45] one disease well back in 1953 that might
[36:47] have been the number one disease
[36:49] but now we have fentanyl
[36:52] now we have drugs we have
[36:54] i see yesterday thailand just passed a
[36:58] national law that they can all grow
[36:59] marijuana
[37:01] it's going these people are insane
[37:05] so they just they're just looking at the
[37:07] money it'll get me out of poverty if i
[37:09] can just sell marijuana to somebody
[37:13] fear
[37:14] perplexity of time distress between the
[37:16] nations
[37:17] horseless carriages on the broadways yes
[37:21] driving crazy
[37:24] all these things have been fulfilled but
[37:26] the last plague is death
[37:29] and it's not physically speaking but
[37:31] it's spiritually speaking
[37:33] death spiritually in the church
[37:36] so you notice it was amongst the sons
[37:39] the spiritual death the church had got
[37:41] more members than it's ever had it's
[37:43] thriving better than it ever did and yet
[37:45] the weakest in spirit than it ever was
[37:49] i mean the church is just it's grown by
[37:51] members leaps and bounds
[37:54] but the spirit of god is is not amongst
[37:57] them amen that's true that's just like
[38:00] it was in egypt so now notice the last
[38:03] thing but oh before oh amen amen before
[38:07] god let the spiritual death reign
[38:10] he made a way of escape for those who
[38:12] wanted to hallelujah and i love that god
[38:16] making a way of escape for those who
[38:18] desire to walk in it and now those that
[38:21] don't desire well okay they got death
[38:24] amen
[38:25] so we want to look here at luke 21
[38:28] amen as we
[38:31] kind of set
[38:32] a little background on this
[38:35] um
[38:38] luke 21 verse 34 it says so it says so
[38:42] take heed to yourselves
[38:44] lest at any time your hearts be
[38:46] overcharged with surfeiting and
[38:48] drunkenness and cares of this life so
[38:50] that that day comes upon you unawares
[38:53] for as a snare shall it come on all them
[38:56] that dwell on the face of the whole
[38:57] earth
[38:58] so watch ye therefore and pray always
[39:01] that you may be accounted worthy to
[39:03] escape all these things that shall come
[39:05] to pass and to stand before the son of
[39:08] man
[39:09] so you see there's no escape clause in
[39:11] those scriptures
[39:14] are not immune to anything in there
[39:17] he said it's going to come and it's
[39:18] going to come as a snare
[39:20] and a snare is how you trap things
[39:23] it looks very appealing and when you
[39:25] reach for it it's got you amen
[39:28] the greek says your hearts
[39:31] he says in verse 34 there he says take
[39:34] heed yourselves lest at that time your
[39:36] hearts be overcharged or your hearts be
[39:39] oppressed
[39:40] by gluttony and drunkenness
[39:42] and that greek word for drunkenness said
[39:44] and the side effects of a hangover after
[39:47] the drunkenness
[39:49] you know how like you know we all get
[39:51] together at thanksgiving we have a great
[39:52] big feast
[39:54] and we get all
[39:55] stuff full of turkey and everything else
[39:57] and the after effect is you all fall
[39:59] asleep
[40:01] and sometimes when you come to church
[40:03] you know you if you're not careful
[40:06] you'll fall asleep
[40:08] oh the word was so good it was so
[40:10] wonderful but then when you walk out of
[40:12] the door you forget
[40:14] amen
[40:15] so he says your hearts be oppressed by
[40:17] gluttony and drunkenness and the
[40:19] hangover after drunkenness and the
[40:21] anxieties of life you think about people
[40:23] are all anxious
[40:27] the anxiety and and we are not free of
[40:30] that and that day come unexpectedly upon
[40:34] you
[40:35] amen
[40:37] so you don't want that day to come
[40:39] unexpectedly because it's going to come
[40:41] as a snare and like i say if you're a
[40:43] good hunter
[40:45] a good trapper you make sure that your
[40:47] trap is well covered up
[40:50] you don't want to write out there big
[40:51] flags here's a trap
[40:54] it's not like that amen
[40:56] so he says in verse 36 there he says so
[40:59] watch ye therefore and pray always that
[41:01] you may be accounted worthy to escape
[41:04] all these things that shall come to pass
[41:08] and you're not getting out of it
[41:10] you're not getting out of it we're all
[41:12] going in this together amen
[41:14] and then let's look at revelations three
[41:17] i always think this is
[41:18] quite amazing
[41:20] revelations 3 verse 10 and 11 he says
[41:24] because thou hast kept the word of my
[41:26] patience i also will keep thee from the
[41:29] hour of temptation
[41:31] which shall come upon all the world
[41:34] to try them that dwell upon the earth
[41:39] the hour of temptation
[41:41] the snare
[41:43] the anxiety the pressures of life the
[41:46] uncertainty of the economy
[41:48] men's hearts failing for fear
[41:50] earthquakes you don't know when you get
[41:52] if you're gonna get killed on the
[41:53] expressway you don't know if if you go
[41:55] to the gas station the guy next to you
[41:57] because you got to the pump before he
[41:58] did
[42:00] right
[42:01] pulls a gun and follows you into the
[42:03] store
[42:04] right
[42:06] and that's the hour that we live in
[42:08] and we're not immune to that
[42:10] if the holy spirit doesn't go with you
[42:12] everywhere you go you are totally
[42:14] unarmed amen
[42:18] amen
[42:19] so he says
[42:20] to try them upon the earth behold i come
[42:24] quickly see it's a snare he says i'm
[42:26] gonna this thing's gonna happen
[42:29] and i'm going to come real quick
[42:31] when you're not expecting me when you're
[42:33] not looking
[42:35] hold out fast which thou hast that no
[42:38] man can take thy crown
[42:41] the original says because thou has kept
[42:43] the word of my patient endurance
[42:48] i like that
[42:49] i also will keep thee from the hour of
[42:51] trial which is about to come on the
[42:54] whole habitable to try those who dwell
[42:57] on the earth
[42:58] amen
[43:00] because the next thing that happens if
[43:02] we go back here to luke 12
[43:06] amen
[43:08] if we go back here to luke 12
[43:10] we see
[43:11] the after effects
[43:13] of not expecting the unexpected
[43:18] the after effects
[43:21] of not expecting
[43:23] a snare
[43:27] so he says here in luke 12 45
[43:31] he says but and if that servant say in
[43:34] his heart my lord delayeth is coming
[43:37] and shall begin to beat the men servants
[43:39] and the maidservants and see
[43:42] to eat and drink and to be drunken
[43:46] take heed unless your hearts be
[43:47] overcharged with the anxiety and the
[43:50] things and start to expect that well
[43:53] maybe this maybe this isn't so bad maybe
[43:56] i can make a better deal out of this
[43:58] thing and he says and then he said they
[44:00] start to eat and drink
[44:02] with the and be drunken and the lord of
[44:04] that servant what did he say there in
[44:06] revelation he will come in a day when he
[44:09] looketh not for him
[44:11] and at an hour when he is not aware
[44:13] and will cut him in asunder and will
[44:15] appoint him his portion with the
[44:17] unbelievers
[44:19] amen
[44:20] so it's a dangerous hour that we're
[44:22] living in
[44:23] it's an hour when
[44:25] brothers if you don't have the holy
[44:27] ghost you need to get it
[44:29] you need to get it amen
[44:32] amen
[44:33] and the third exodus brother branham
[44:34] said so you see they'd had many exoduses
[44:37] of course but i'm speaking on the time
[44:40] that god called for an exodus
[44:42] a separation from where they were so
[44:45] where they were in egypt at the present
[44:47] time
[44:49] and here god is making ready to fulfill
[44:51] his divine promised word that he had
[44:54] given to abraham and to isaac and to
[44:56] jacob years hundreds of years had passed
[44:59] 430 years
[45:02] that's a long time
[45:04] i mean
[45:06] most of us were alive when the world
[45:08] trade center went down right
[45:11] that's not a long time
[45:14] 21 years ago it's not a long time
[45:18] people have had babies after that people
[45:20] have gotten married after that people
[45:22] have had gone in and got careers they've
[45:24] been in in their career for 10 or 15
[45:27] years since 2001.
[45:29] just think of the things that have
[45:30] happened since 2001
[45:32] but here's the children of israel they
[45:33] had rehearsed this promise this prophecy
[45:37] for 400 years
[45:43] amen
[45:44] but god never
[45:46] yes
[45:47] years hundreds of years had passed but
[45:49] yet god never forgets his promise
[45:53] in the season
[45:55] in the due time
[45:57] god always makes his promise right
[46:01] amen
[46:02] therefore you can rest assured that what
[46:04] god has promised in this bible he's
[46:07] going to do it
[46:08] there's no need of trying to think
[46:10] anything else and say well the prophet
[46:12] was maybe he was wrong or this couldn't
[46:14] happen in this day looked almost
[46:16] impossible more impossible than it does
[46:18] now but god did it anyhow because he
[46:22] promised he would do it
[46:25] he has promised
[46:27] we've read the promises right we just
[46:29] read them
[46:30] so let's go back here to exodus 12.
[46:33] let's take a look and see what god has
[46:36] for us
[46:37] amen
[46:40] praise the lord amen
[46:44] so in verse 1 it says in the lord
[46:46] speaking to moses and aaron in the land
[46:49] of egypt saying
[46:50] this month shall be unto you the
[46:52] beginning of months it shall be the
[46:55] first month of the year to you
[46:58] and we all came out of egypt
[47:01] but when you hear the voice of moses
[47:04] when you hear his voice and aaron and
[47:07] they start to talk to you about the word
[47:09] of god that is the beginning
[47:12] anything that you did before that don't
[47:13] count
[47:16] this is the beginning of your life
[47:18] this is the beginning of your life is
[47:20] when you respond
[47:22] brother branham said he says coming down
[47:24] god said i'm done fooling around with
[47:26] you guys
[47:28] the time where i'm calling for the last
[47:31] this is it we're going
[47:34] now
[47:35] how are we going to get there
[47:38] so this is the beginning of the month
[47:40] so he says this is the beginning of
[47:41] months and it should be unto you the
[47:44] first month
[47:46] of the year to you
[47:48] and he says now speaking unto all the
[47:50] congregation of israel everybody
[47:53] worldwide
[47:55] the very first thing you got to do if
[47:57] you want to be in the exodus get a lamb
[48:02] well i don't i don't i don't know if i
[48:04] want to no
[48:07] no
[48:09] this is an optional
[48:11] get a lamb
[48:14] he says
[48:16] speaking under the congregation of
[48:17] israel saying in the tenth day of this
[48:20] this first month
[48:21] they shall take to them every man a lamb
[48:24] according to the house of their fathers
[48:26] a lamb for the house
[48:28] that house you'll notice that this lamb
[48:31] that that moses told them to get was
[48:34] large enough for everybody in your house
[48:38] and if it's too big there's enough lamb
[48:40] to go around for you and your neighbor
[48:45] but if you don't get the lamb you're not
[48:47] going on the journey
[48:49] you have to have the lamb
[48:51] amen
[48:53] amen
[48:57] he says and if the household be too
[48:59] little for the lamb
[49:01] let him and his neighbor next into his
[49:03] house take it according to the number of
[49:05] the souls
[49:06] every man according to his eating shall
[49:09] make you count for the lamb
[49:11] okay
[49:12] everybody we're all going to sit down
[49:14] and have a meal
[49:16] and he says in verse 5 he says so your
[49:17] lamb shall be without blemish a male of
[49:20] the first year and you shall take it out
[49:22] from the sheep or from the goats and you
[49:25] shall keep it up until the 14th day of
[49:28] the same month and the whole assembly of
[49:30] the congregation of israel shall kill it
[49:32] in the evening
[49:34] brother branham says so he says watch
[49:36] this in type
[49:37] this lamb figuratively speaking was the
[49:40] lamb of god
[49:42] the atonement just before
[49:45] the destruction
[49:47] how are you going to get by without a
[49:49] lamb
[49:51] how are you going to get by saying well
[49:52] i i you know my dad he he's a pastor
[49:56] or are my my aunt she's really faithful
[50:00] or or you know my brother he you know
[50:03] years ago his uncle's second customer
[50:05] they fished with brother branham
[50:09] no
[50:11] you've got to have the lamb
[50:13] amen
[50:15] the atonement just before the
[50:17] destruction and notice it must be a
[50:19] young lamb it must be a male
[50:22] the first from the mother you and that
[50:24] was jesus the first from the virgin mary
[50:27] and it must be without blemish it must
[50:28] be kept up and tried
[50:30] every one of us must try our lamb
[50:35] you can't just say i accept jesus as my
[50:38] savior without testing him
[50:43] you got to test him
[50:46] it's a requirement
[50:48] test him and see if the lord is good
[50:51] test him and see if he'll keep his word
[50:55] you know people that are real believers
[50:57] when they start god starts to draw them
[51:00] and starts to call them the very first
[51:02] thing he does is he delivers them from
[51:04] something so they say oh i didn't know
[51:07] it before but i know it now there is a
[51:09] god
[51:11] there is a god
[51:12] and all of your drunk friends smoking
[51:15] pot and everything else go what
[51:19] i'll tell you
[51:20] what car fell on me when i was 17
[51:25] and i should be dead
[51:27] but after that after i got out from
[51:28] underneath that i said you know what i
[51:30] don't care what any you guys say i'm not
[51:31] swearing i'm not saying that
[51:33] because i know there's a god i heard his
[51:36] voice he talked to me
[51:38] he told me what to do and i was still a
[51:41] sinner
[51:42] but you've got to know you've got to try
[51:45] your lamb
[51:46] you've got to try him
[51:49] if you what good is to come to church
[51:51] and pay your tithes and come and do all
[51:52] this stuff and still not know the
[51:54] reality that your lamb can take care of
[51:57] every situation you have
[51:59] amen listen what brother branham says i
[52:01] just love this he says he must be about
[52:03] blemish he must be kept up and tried to
[52:06] see and all how perfect that prefigured
[52:10] him he was the perfect one he everyone
[52:13] had to testify
[52:15] that he was the lamb even pilate said i
[52:19] have found no fault in him
[52:22] bring me some water
[52:23] and notice you talk about him i could
[52:25] call tonight i could say zechariah what
[52:27] do you think about him and he would give
[52:29] his expression and i could call eve and
[52:32] she could say oh it's the seed that was
[52:34] promised to me back in the garden of
[52:36] eden
[52:37] eve had to test the lamb zachariah had
[52:40] to test the lamb isaiah had to test the
[52:42] lamb jeremiah had to test the lamb and
[52:45] you think you don't have to test the
[52:46] lamb
[52:49] well you're not going
[52:52] amen
[52:55] he said i could call daniel daniel what
[52:57] about you i'll put him on trial with you
[53:00] said he is the rock that was hewed out
[53:02] of the mountain daniel saw that amen he
[53:05] could call isaiah and isaiah said that's
[53:07] the one that i said unto you a child is
[53:09] born a son is given that's the
[53:12] fulfillment that is the lamb amen
[53:14] amen isaiah saw him amen i could call
[53:17] ezekiel he said what do you think about
[53:20] him oh he says i saw him like clouds
[53:22] with his freedom moving amen a fire a
[53:25] wheel inside of a wheel amen i could
[53:27] call john the baptist and say what do
[53:28] you think about him and he said i didn't
[53:30] even know him
[53:32] but he
[53:33] see
[53:34] he that told me in the wilderness he'd
[53:37] already had a connection before he even
[53:39] got to his
[53:40] lamb there was something already there
[53:44] pulling on him
[53:46] he that talked to me in the wilderness
[53:48] said upon whom thou see the spirit
[53:50] descending and remaining he's the one
[53:52] that will baptize you with the holy
[53:54] ghost and fire amen
[53:56] praise the lord
[53:58] amen
[54:00] i like that
[54:02] upon whom thou shall see
[54:04] have you seen the spirit of god fall
[54:07] on your land
[54:11] god doesn't want you just to be a church
[54:13] member
[54:16] amen we're talking about we're talking
[54:18] about
[54:19] an exodus amen
[54:22] i could call mary and say mary what do
[54:24] you think about it mary would say i
[54:25] didn't even know a man but the holy
[54:27] ghost overshadowed me and said that
[54:29] thing that's born in you will be called
[54:31] the son of god i could call those
[54:33] different ones i could call the roman
[54:35] now see he started with the believers he
[54:37] says and i could call the roman what do
[54:39] you think and you would say well his
[54:41] friends will always testify but what
[54:44] about his enemies
[54:45] okay
[54:46] let's call pilate
[54:48] after taking a pen and washing his hands
[54:50] and saying i find no fault in him but
[54:52] take him away do whatever you want to he
[54:55] he tested the lamb and then rejected it
[55:00] yeah
[55:02] tested the lamb and then said nope
[55:05] let me wash my hands
[55:06] i wasn't here i didn't see it i didn't
[55:09] feel it i didn't know that he was i
[55:12] didn't know
[55:13] uh-uh
[55:15] trying to find a political favor he
[55:16] plunged himself to death up there in
[55:18] norway or in sweden and when every year
[55:20] they go there to watch this blue water
[55:22] bubbling up again and claim it's the
[55:23] water he washed his hands from christ
[55:26] you can't wash your hands off of him
[55:28] no sir you can't i looked at the roman
[55:30] centurion what do you think about him
[55:32] you're the one of his enemies he put his
[55:34] hand on his heart he said truly this is
[55:36] the son of god pilate said i find no
[55:39] fault in him
[55:41] first he was standing there very bad
[55:43] always ready to condemn everything and i
[55:46] hear a horse come running galloping down
[55:48] the street and here comes one of the
[55:50] temple guards he jumps off his horse he
[55:52] goes a little piece he's got a little
[55:54] piece of paper folded he runs up before
[55:56] a pilot he bows down hands in the piece
[55:58] of paper an old pilot you know he takes
[56:00] it he opens it up he was
[56:02] was early that morning kind of you know
[56:04] he even had his coffee yet
[56:06] he got up there and he looked he began
[56:08] to turn white his knees begin to beat
[56:10] together let's look over his shoulder
[56:12] and see what's in the matter what's
[56:14] written on that piece of paper his pagan
[56:16] wife had said have nothing to do with
[56:18] this just man for i've suffered many
[56:21] things in a dream today because of him
[56:24] amen the lamb has to be tested
[56:29] by every one of us
[56:31] not good enough that your husband tested
[56:33] the lamb not good enough that the wife
[56:36] tested the lamb not good enough that the
[56:39] deacon board tested it's not good enough
[56:41] you have to get a lamb you have to test
[56:45] it
[56:46] you have to test it oh judas iscariot
[56:49] what do you think about him he said i
[56:51] betrayed innocent blood
[56:53] he got a rope and was man enough to hang
[56:55] himself
[56:58] he tried him
[57:00] what do you think about him god said to
[57:03] he that's what do you think about him
[57:04] god
[57:05] he said this is my beloved son
[57:07] hear ye him
[57:09] kept up no fault in him sure first one
[57:12] from the old mother the mother you the
[57:14] lamb was jesus was the first child of
[57:16] the virgin born of a virgin birth and of
[57:18] course he had to be a virgin
[57:21] notice this now i want you to notice
[57:23] again that all the assembly then was to
[57:26] kill him
[57:27] and that's what we saw here
[57:29] first of all he says go get you a lamb
[57:32] everybody get a lamb for the house
[57:35] and then it and make sure that the lamb
[57:38] you get
[57:39] is um is big enough for all the souls
[57:42] that are in your house
[57:44] and if you get the one that's you know
[57:45] you get the super size one
[57:47] then share it with the guy next door to
[57:49] you
[57:52] and then
[57:53] test him
[57:55] test him and try him
[57:57] and after you've tested him and tried
[57:59] him
[58:00] then
[58:01] the high priest he also got a lamb
[58:06] because there's one lamb for the whole
[58:08] nation
[58:10] because the bible says
[58:14] and the whole assembly of the
[58:16] congregation of israel shall kill it
[58:19] that's one
[58:20] in the evening
[58:22] and then everybody killed their lambs
[58:27] the whole congregation
[58:29] and he says
[58:31] and i want you to notice again that all
[58:32] the assembly was to kill him the
[58:34] assembly the whole assembly now if you
[58:36] notice watch how this reads you can see
[58:39] it in a pre-figure see watch 14th day
[58:42] the same month the whole assembly of the
[58:44] congregation of israel shall kill it in
[58:46] the evening and you'll notice all israel
[58:48] stood there and said away with him let
[58:51] his blood be upon us and upon our
[58:53] children and they from cahiaphus
[58:56] all the way down witnessed his death
[58:58] every one of them did away with him give
[59:01] us barabbas you notice that and he died
[59:03] at three o'clock in the evening and they
[59:06] and they shall kill it in the evening
[59:08] how beautiful you see that end of verse
[59:10] six there shall kill it in the evening
[59:14] but it's not just good enough
[59:17] to kill the lamb
[59:20] because we're going on an exodus
[59:24] this is just before the last plague
[59:27] and now we're getting out
[59:29] well we saw the the frogs we saw the
[59:33] darkness that you could touch with your
[59:34] hands
[59:35] we saw the water turn into blood
[59:38] we saw the plagues we saw the the boils
[59:42] on on all the animals and everything we
[59:44] saw that but now the last plague the la
[59:48] it's time to leave egypt
[59:52] so now there's a separation there's
[59:54] something that god
[59:56] wants you to know about that he's
[59:59] testing this is different than all the
[1:00:01] rest
[1:00:03] because it requires a lamb
[1:00:06] and it requires that after you've taken
[1:00:09] and killed the lamb
[1:00:11] so they're going to kill the lamb in the
[1:00:12] evening
[1:00:13] and he says and thou shalt take the
[1:00:15] blood
[1:00:16] so now if and i'm me i'm i'm a wuss
[1:00:21] brother johnson and i we were talking
[1:00:22] about the squirrels in his backyard i
[1:00:24] said oh brother johnson i said i went to
[1:00:25] iowa one time i said went squirrel
[1:00:27] hunting brother invited me says come and
[1:00:30] go squirrel hunting with me i said i
[1:00:32] killed a squirrel i felt sorry for the
[1:00:34] squirrel
[1:00:35] then i picked this poor thing i liked
[1:00:37] him and they put him in my bag and i
[1:00:42] take him home and eat him
[1:00:43] i said no i just want to go to sam's and
[1:00:46] say i'll take that i like that roast
[1:00:48] right there like that pork and i said i
[1:00:50] don't i don't want to kill the lamb
[1:00:53] but you got to kill the lamb jesus said
[1:00:56] we just took communion he says if you
[1:00:58] don't eat my flesh and drink my blood
[1:01:00] you have no part
[1:01:02] you've got to kill the lamb
[1:01:04] so when they took the lamb
[1:01:06] you know you got to do it humane
[1:01:09] how many are your pet lovers
[1:01:12] yeah right now
[1:01:14] all of you that are pet lovers you got a
[1:01:15] pet at home
[1:01:17] okay
[1:01:18] try this when you go home
[1:01:20] grab your pet and just sit down in a
[1:01:22] chair and just hold him
[1:01:25] just hold on to him and see what he does
[1:01:30] just see what he so you think this lamb
[1:01:32] is going to lay down for you
[1:01:36] so you already picked the lamb you take
[1:01:38] the lamb you're going to have to tie its
[1:01:39] feet together
[1:01:41] and all the time it's fighting for life
[1:01:43] because everything wants to live
[1:01:47] so then what you do is you take a lamb
[1:01:48] and you want to be humane about it
[1:01:51] this is back in egypt
[1:01:53] you want to be humane about it so you
[1:01:54] don't have a 357 or a shotgun or
[1:01:57] something
[1:01:59] no
[1:02:00] you got to get a very sharp knife
[1:02:02] and you got to grab that lamb
[1:02:04] right up between his ears
[1:02:07] and you slit his throat
[1:02:10] and blood's gonna come out because his
[1:02:12] heart's beating
[1:02:14] you gotta let him bleed out so you put a
[1:02:16] pan down there
[1:02:17] because you gotta catch the blood you
[1:02:20] got to see it shaken for its life
[1:02:23] and you catch the blood
[1:02:26] now
[1:02:27] the blood in the pan
[1:02:31] moses didn't say just take the blood and
[1:02:32] put it in a pan and then let's go on and
[1:02:35] eat the lamb he said ah no
[1:02:38] take the blood of your lamb that you
[1:02:41] have proven
[1:02:43] the lamb that you have kept up for four
[1:02:45] days
[1:02:46] because it's on the 10th day of the
[1:02:48] month and this is the 14th 14th day of
[1:02:50] the month and now evening of the 14th
[1:02:52] day kill the lamb
[1:02:55] and now take the blood
[1:02:57] and take it
[1:02:59] and put it on
[1:03:00] the doorposts one on each side
[1:03:03] and across the lentil on the top
[1:03:06] he says so that everybody can see
[1:03:08] that you have slain a lamb
[1:03:12] people think somehow they can be a
[1:03:14] christian without the blood being on
[1:03:17] display are you kidding me
[1:03:21] it's got to be applied in your life
[1:03:26] it's got to be on display
[1:03:30] and we're not talking about jehovah
[1:03:31] witness on display
[1:03:33] we're not talking about that we're not
[1:03:34] talking about the guy that that walks
[1:03:36] around the factory floor with the bible
[1:03:38] underneath his hand and anytime you talk
[1:03:40] to me so let me tell you about a
[1:03:41] scripture here that is what we're
[1:03:42] talking about we're talking about blood
[1:03:45] being applied and the blood is what
[1:03:47] sanctifies the believer and
[1:03:49] sanctification means i no longer chew
[1:03:51] tobacco it means i no longer smoke it
[1:03:54] means i no longer swear it means i no
[1:03:56] longer run with the people they think
[1:03:57] it's strange that's what scripture says
[1:03:59] that says they think it's strange that
[1:04:00] you're no longer running with them now
[1:04:02] see sister lynn you amazed me you just
[1:04:06] absolutely amazed me i only talked to
[1:04:08] her once she told me she said 20 years
[1:04:10] as in flint she said you'd have to tell
[1:04:12] me she said i got a book and bang she
[1:04:15] proved the lamb
[1:04:16] and then the blood was applied
[1:04:19] the pants went out the window
[1:04:21] everybody said what what are you doing
[1:04:24] my god what god is this god the one
[1:04:28] that's got the blood see he's applied
[1:04:30] he's on display
[1:04:33] amen the blood's got to be applied it's
[1:04:36] got to be on display everybody's got to
[1:04:39] recognize it amen
[1:04:41] the sinners your friends everybody
[1:04:45] amen and not just for a week or two
[1:04:50] now you know a lot of people like that
[1:04:51] too well i got baptized i feel really
[1:04:53] good about it but then they just kind of
[1:04:54] slide back into the old muck and mire
[1:04:57] amen
[1:05:00] amen
[1:05:02] praise the
[1:05:06] lord that's what was in egypt
[1:05:09] that dreadful night
[1:05:11] just before death struck
[1:05:14] there isn't anybody that can tell you
[1:05:19] you can meet him at the gas you can meet
[1:05:21] them anywhere they all will tell you
[1:05:24] something is wrong
[1:05:28] because there's an oppression there's
[1:05:31] something happening
[1:05:33] just before death comes
[1:05:38] just before it comes
[1:05:42] just before the last plague
[1:05:45] god had showed his great signs and
[1:05:46] wonders in egypt his long
[1:05:49] and his kindness to pharaoh and all of
[1:05:51] his people he had sent many great signs
[1:05:54] through the land he sent him a prophet
[1:05:56] he showed them signs and wonders a
[1:05:58] pillar of fire and all the things that
[1:05:59] he did and yet in all that he had did
[1:06:02] they would not repent they would not
[1:06:04] come to god they ignored all of his
[1:06:06] signs they ignored his prophet they
[1:06:08] ignored a message they wanted their own
[1:06:10] way
[1:06:12] so god had been fed up with them so he
[1:06:15] said you know what i'm going to make a
[1:06:17] separation now
[1:06:19] between those who do believe and those
[1:06:22] who do not believe
[1:06:24] he said i'm going to make a separation
[1:06:27] and it was a lamb
[1:06:30] the lamb was the separation
[1:06:32] amen
[1:06:34] and brother branham says and i think
[1:06:36] we're living
[1:06:37] in that time
[1:06:39] now
[1:06:41] what
[1:06:43] now i thought we were talking about
[1:06:44] exodus and moses and many many many many
[1:06:47] no brother branham said it's now
[1:06:50] now
[1:06:52] god
[1:06:53] is making a choice
[1:06:55] and man will believe or he won't believe
[1:06:58] and then god required a token
[1:07:00] and this token was an innocent lamb that
[1:07:03] he had substituted
[1:07:05] for
[1:07:07] your death
[1:07:11] that's what the lamb is for
[1:07:14] if the if the children of israel found
[1:07:16] the lamb and they slayed the lamb and
[1:07:18] they applied the blood
[1:07:20] and they finished everything that moses
[1:07:23] said
[1:07:24] then god would spare their life the
[1:07:27] firstborn
[1:07:28] but if they did not if they
[1:07:31] one place in the token brother brandon
[1:07:34] preached a token i think four or five
[1:07:35] times he said one place he said the
[1:07:38] three
[1:07:39] there's three
[1:07:40] jews are all standing there
[1:07:42] and he says and the one brother he's
[1:07:44] he's stirring up the blood he said this
[1:07:46] is the blood of the lamb of god and the
[1:07:48] other two brothers said yes sir brother
[1:07:49] we believe that and he said then this
[1:07:51] will deliver us the death angel when he
[1:07:53] sees us he'll pass over our house
[1:07:55] tonight they say oh yes brother i
[1:07:57] believe that and he said he'd start
[1:07:59] putting it on the doorpost and on the
[1:08:00] little and everything else we believe
[1:08:02] that we believe it amen now you go do it
[1:08:05] well you know i got standing
[1:08:07] i got standing i i'm you know i'm
[1:08:09] popular amongst my friends i i
[1:08:12] my family will reject me who wants to
[1:08:14] put blood on my 200 000 400 000 house
[1:08:19] who you know
[1:08:20] who wants to do that
[1:08:22] who wants to clean it up who wants to do
[1:08:24] all oh i mean you know it's nice i i'm
[1:08:27] glad you believe the message like that
[1:08:29] but but that's not that's not for me
[1:08:31] that's your choice
[1:08:34] god required a token in that day because
[1:08:36] a death angel was coming amen
[1:08:40] and now when the lamb was killed the
[1:08:42] blood was to be placed upon the doorpost
[1:08:44] and on the lintel and it was to show
[1:08:46] that the requirement
[1:08:48] had been carried out
[1:08:50] oh i think that's a great lesson for us
[1:08:52] as we look at it
[1:08:54] see the believing worship as he was
[1:08:56] identified by the token of the blood he
[1:08:59] had to the believer had got the lamb he
[1:09:01] slayed the lamb a lamb for a house he
[1:09:03] took the blood with hyssop which is just
[1:09:06] a little brush that grows up there in
[1:09:07] the country and there's just a common
[1:09:09] weeds as we call it and to apply the
[1:09:12] blood it shows that the applying of the
[1:09:15] blood with the hyssop hyssop represents
[1:09:18] faith
[1:09:19] and many times
[1:09:22] listen many times
[1:09:25] people think they have to have some kind
[1:09:28] of supernatural faith
[1:09:31] and he said no all you've got to do is
[1:09:35] take him at his word
[1:09:37] and trust him
[1:09:38] prove him
[1:09:40] prove that lamb
[1:09:42] amen
[1:09:45] he says you think you need some
[1:09:46] supernatural faith to be a believer it
[1:09:49] isn't the hyssop speaks for that this
[1:09:52] common weeds that you could just get it
[1:09:53] anywhere pick it up dip it in the blood
[1:09:55] and apply the blood
[1:09:57] praise the lord amen
[1:09:59] you've got to do that
[1:10:01] every one of us
[1:10:02] you saw i don't know and that's kind of
[1:10:04] fanatical i'm okay with that
[1:10:07] i'm okay with that
[1:10:09] i'm okay with that
[1:10:11] so verse seven it says so you take of
[1:10:13] the blood and strike it upon the two
[1:10:15] side posts and on the upper door post of
[1:10:18] the houses wherein you shall eat it
[1:10:20] it's got to be applied where you're
[1:10:24] eating the lamb
[1:10:27] in revelations 10 1-7 it says the book
[1:10:30] was closed but he said i saw one sitting
[1:10:33] on the throne
[1:10:34] and he said and he had a book
[1:10:37] and he handed it to this other guy
[1:10:40] and this other guy took the book
[1:10:43] and he opened it up and he come down and
[1:10:44] stood upon the land in the sea put one
[1:10:46] foot on the land and one foot on the sea
[1:10:48] and said the book is no longer closed
[1:10:50] it's open now
[1:10:52] well that's great
[1:10:55] that's wonderful
[1:10:57] but that isn't what the next scripture
[1:10:59] says
[1:11:00] the next scripture says
[1:11:02] take the book
[1:11:04] jesus said i am the book
[1:11:07] right
[1:11:08] take the book
[1:11:10] and then eat it
[1:11:12] in the house where you sacrificed your
[1:11:16] lamb
[1:11:18] amen
[1:11:20] you got to eat this book
[1:11:22] you got to become one with your lamb
[1:11:25] you can't just oh it was a nice lamb it
[1:11:27] was really nice lamb and i had to kill
[1:11:29] him because moses told me i had to i
[1:11:31] didn't really wasn't what i wanted to do
[1:11:33] but you know i don't want to look like
[1:11:34] an oddball so i'll follow everybody else
[1:11:37] i'm going to kill the lamb and now i'm
[1:11:39] going to do just like every no
[1:11:41] there's no faith in that
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:47] so what look what he says in verse 80
[1:11:48] says and they shall eat the flesh
[1:11:51] in that night
[1:11:53] roasted with fire
[1:11:55] with unleavened bread
[1:11:57] and with bitter herbs they shall eat it
[1:12:00] now i want you to notice
[1:12:02] something
[1:12:04] i went
[1:12:06] i want you to turn over and look at
[1:12:07] verse 11.
[1:12:11] and thus
[1:12:12] shall you eat it
[1:12:15] with your loins girded
[1:12:17] your shoes on your feet
[1:12:19] your staff in your hand
[1:12:21] and you should eat it in haste
[1:12:23] it is the lord's passover
[1:12:28] i thought we were supposed to roast the
[1:12:29] lamb first no you got to get dressed
[1:12:38] when brother johnson read that i looked
[1:12:39] down and said wait a minute what
[1:12:44] he's he says when you eat the lamb verse
[1:12:47] 8 said
[1:12:49] and they shall eat the flesh
[1:12:51] verse 8 says eat the lamb but before you
[1:12:54] can eat the lamb you got to get dressed
[1:12:58] you can't just eat the dress any old way
[1:13:00] you can't eat the lamb any way you want
[1:13:03] you gotta have the blood applied and
[1:13:05] then you gotta get dressed
[1:13:08] you gotta get dressed
[1:13:10] amen
[1:13:12] you gotta
[1:13:13] you gotta have your loins girded that's
[1:13:15] the first thing get your loins girded
[1:13:18] you know get a nice big belt put it on
[1:13:20] there hold your pants up
[1:13:22] right
[1:13:25] get your loins girded and put some shoes
[1:13:28] on your feet because they're going on a
[1:13:30] journey
[1:13:31] and the stones are in the road
[1:13:33] and some of the places we're going
[1:13:35] people have thrown beer bottles out of
[1:13:36] their cars and there's glass in the road
[1:13:40] and there's nails in there there's all

[1:13:47] something with some really good souls
[1:13:49] that you can walk on these things
[1:13:52] because we're going
[1:13:55] and he says then take your staff take
[1:13:57] your staff too
[1:13:59] thy rod and thy staff they do comfort me
[1:14:03] because when you're out there walking
[1:14:06] and we're going in haste so we're going
[1:14:07] to be running
[1:14:09] he said because we're doing that you're
[1:14:11] going to have to have something to
[1:14:12] comfort you when the trials get tough
[1:14:14] because we have just started on this
[1:14:16] journey
[1:14:17] we just started
[1:14:19] amen
[1:14:21] so let's let's read verse
[1:14:24] 8 let's do this so he says you should
[1:14:27] eat the flesh in that night
[1:14:29] roast
[1:14:31] roast with fire
[1:14:33] unleavened bread and with bitter herbs
[1:14:36] you shall eat it
[1:14:37] eat not of it raw
[1:14:39] nor sodden it all with water i'm sorry
[1:14:42] if you like medium rare meat no
[1:14:45] you like your prime rib raw no
[1:14:50] no he says no
[1:14:52] not sodding at all with water but
[1:14:54] roasted with fire
[1:14:56] his head
[1:14:57] yes all the intelligence and his legs
[1:15:01] amen how he walks
[1:15:03] and all the insides
[1:15:06] everything
[1:15:08] yeah
[1:15:10] yeah when you kill the lamb and you
[1:15:12] become one with the lamb he wants your
[1:15:14] brains
[1:15:16] he wants how you walk
[1:15:18] he wants how you think
[1:15:20] he wants everything
[1:15:22] and no medium rare not good enough
[1:15:26] not good enough amen
[1:15:28] and you shall let nothing of it remain
[1:15:31] until the morning because you know
[1:15:34] that after the death angel came
[1:15:38] the battle it was new the next day
[1:15:41] do you realize that we're in the last
[1:15:43] age of the last day of the last hour and
[1:15:46] when the morning comes
[1:15:49] there is to be no lamb left
[1:15:51] because
[1:15:52] he that is filthy remains filthy he
[1:15:55] that's wicked remains wicked he that's
[1:15:57] righteous remain righteous because the
[1:15:58] lamb has been eaten
[1:16:02] and if anything's left
[1:16:04] because it's the last age
[1:16:07] it's roasted and burnt up with fire
[1:16:13] and that's what the scripture says
[1:16:15] and the righteous shall walk out on the
[1:16:18] ashes
[1:16:21] amen
[1:16:23] brother sister my
[1:16:25] then leave nothing of it till the
[1:16:27] morning
[1:16:29] if you haven't listened to the seals
[1:16:30] what
[1:16:32] if you haven't listened to the church
[1:16:33] ages what have you been doing
[1:16:36] you know you're not going to get out of
[1:16:37] here without the whole lamb you got to
[1:16:40] eat the whole lamb
[1:16:42] amen
[1:16:44] praise god
[1:16:47] brother branham said you know see i was
[1:16:48] standing here not long ago by a big
[1:16:50] smelter
[1:16:52] and i noticed how hot that fire was
[1:16:54] and it just cooked and cooked and cooked
[1:16:58] and as the hotter it got
[1:17:00] all the dross and the metal
[1:17:02] it all come it's in the gold and it will
[1:17:05] all come to the top
[1:17:09] god is going to put us all in the
[1:17:12] smelter puts us in the smelter
[1:17:14] and he says all the things i like how he
[1:17:17] says it all comes to the top and they
[1:17:19] skimmed it off
[1:17:21] oh good well they got all the dross out
[1:17:24] he said but that ain't enough
[1:17:25] so i'm going to turn the heat up even
[1:17:27] more
[1:17:29] because there's other things there's
[1:17:30] other impurities in there
[1:17:33] he says so he says they would heat the
[1:17:35] fire up a little hotter in the smelter
[1:17:37] and then when that boil would come then
[1:17:40] they would have some more stuff pyrite
[1:17:42] and stuff and they'd take that out of it
[1:17:44] so he says in the next paragraph he says
[1:17:46] so you see the first thing that comes up
[1:17:48] was the dirt
[1:17:50] so when you heard the voice of god and
[1:17:51] you tested the lamb and then you heard
[1:17:53] the blood you put the blood on the door
[1:17:55] and you started to eat the lamb the very
[1:17:57] first thing you're wondering
[1:17:58] you're wondering wait a minute i like to
[1:18:00] do this this i like to this is something
[1:18:03] i like to do
[1:18:04] but if it's not what god wants to do he
[1:18:07] just turns the heat up
[1:18:09] so all of a sudden that thing that you
[1:18:10] like to do
[1:18:13] get it away
[1:18:14] and he just skims it off
[1:18:16] and then he looks at you and he says oh
[1:18:18] you're kind of prickly you don't get
[1:18:19] along with your neighbor you're looking
[1:18:21] along with the people in the church he
[1:18:22] turns the heat up
[1:18:25] he turns the heat up
[1:18:27] yeah they bring all kinds of things can
[1:18:28] we rub their metal together brings that
[1:18:31] together brings disagreements and
[1:18:33] everything that's fussing and everything
[1:18:34] else these gods just standing back they
[1:18:36] said turn the heat up some more
[1:18:38] yes
[1:18:39] oh my
[1:18:42] praise the lord
[1:18:44] you know nebuchadnezzar nebuchadnezzar
[1:18:46] god sent nebuchadnezzar down to egypt or
[1:18:48] down to israel to to

[1:25:07] and this is where people stumble and
[1:25:09] fall
[1:25:10] first peter 4 12
[1:25:13] says beloved think it not strange
[1:25:15] concerning the fiery trial which is to
[1:25:17] try you as though some strange thing
[1:25:19] happened unto you
[1:25:20] eat it not raw
[1:25:23] eat it without any water in it eat it
[1:25:25] not sodden but roasted completely with
[1:25:29] fire
[1:25:31] that means
[1:25:32] he's gonna bring you
[1:25:34] to a test
[1:25:37] and you know what
[1:25:41] it's your test
[1:25:42] now he brought me through one i've been
[1:25:44] through a couple of tests myself but
[1:25:46] my test is my test
[1:25:48] and your test is your test
[1:25:50] and your test is your test by the market
[1:25:53] and your test sister manna
[1:25:55] got that
[1:25:56] he's got a fiery trial
[1:25:58] he's got something in there that will
[1:26:00] make i mean look at what it did to the
[1:26:02] disciples
[1:26:03] them disciples thought they really
[1:26:05] understood jesus christ they really
[1:26:08] thought they had it
[1:26:11] but when they saw the word made flesh on
[1:26:14] a cross they all ran
[1:26:18] because there was a trial
[1:26:21] god was turning the heat up he's turning
[1:26:23] the heat up and turning the heat up they
[1:26:25] were so scared they hid out in the upper
[1:26:27] room for 10 days
[1:26:30] they had takeout
[1:26:33] who's going out i ain't going out they
[1:26:36] were afraid of everything their own
[1:26:37] shadow and everything and jesus had
[1:26:39] already come and met with them you ever
[1:26:40] think about that in the book of acts
[1:26:42] they were hiding out and they'd already
[1:26:44] seen him risen from the dead
[1:26:46] so why weren't they testifying
[1:26:48] huh why weren't they out testifying hey
[1:26:51] i saw him he rose from the dead no they
[1:26:53] weren't afraid
[1:26:56] because the fire's got it it's got to
[1:26:58] come and touch your life
[1:27:00] it's thinking not
[1:27:02] strange concerning the fire trial which
[1:27:05] is to try you as though some strange
[1:27:08] thing happened on you but rejoice
[1:27:13] that's a trial in itself
[1:27:16] right there i feel like crying

[1:27:24] and then again i say rejoice
[1:27:27] rejoice in the lord always right
[1:27:30] inasmuch as you are partakers of your
[1:27:33] lamb's
[1:27:34] sacrifice

[1:27:51] christ's sufferings that when his glory
[1:27:54] shall be revealed you may be glad also
[1:27:58] with exceedingly joy you think of how
[1:28:00] those three hebrew children and that

[1:31:26] he says so he says no man that worth
[1:31:28] entangled himself with the affairs of
[1:31:30] this life that he may please him who
[1:31:32] hath chosen him to be a soldier god has
[1:31:35] chosen all of us

[1:31:40] and if a man also strived for masteries
[1:31:43] yet he's not crowned except you strive
[1:31:45] lawfully so that's very easy
[1:31:48] verse five is about you wanna you wanna
[1:31:49] become a lawyer well you go to school
[1:31:51] and get a law degree and don't cheat

[1:32:10] training to be an electrician
[1:32:12] right
[1:32:13] couldn't pass the test
[1:32:16] but you might have been a good
[1:32:17] electrician
[1:32:19] could have been
[1:32:20] but if you can't pass a test i'm not
[1:32:22] giving you the certificate
[1:32:24] if you can't pass the test of god's word
[1:32:26] you're not getting the certificate
[1:32:30] if you can't pass it
[1:32:33] amen
[1:32:35] paul says to timothy he says he says
[1:32:38] listen he says the husband that laboreth
[1:32:40] must be first partaker of the fruits and
[1:32:43] what that means is before you even
[1:32:46] even dream
[1:32:53] before i could even
[1:32:55] get behind here
[1:32:57] god says guess what brother bruce
[1:33:01] you're gonna get all their tests
[1:33:05] so that you know how they feel
[1:33:08] so that you can have compassion on them
[1:33:10] when you preach and not just beat them
[1:33:13] over the head
[1:33:16] oh yeah
[1:33:18] we're not talking about that
[1:33:20] verse 7 says consider what i say and the
[1:33:22] lord give the understanding in all
[1:33:24] things
[1:33:25] oh praise the lord all right look
[1:33:28] so we so let's go back here what are we
[1:33:29] talking about oh yeah full armor of god
[1:33:33] okay can you hang on for 15 minutes
[1:33:36] quick
[1:33:37] all right let's look at exodus 12.
[1:33:40] you don't have to answer because i'm i'm
[1:33:42] not stopping
[1:33:45] i remember you says brillo fontaine
[1:33:48] cervelo fontaine are you done he says
[1:33:50] i'm done when i'm finished
[1:33:54] all right so verse 11 says and thus
[1:33:56] shall you eat it with your loins skirted
[1:33:59] your shoes on your feet your staff in
[1:34:01] your hand you shall eat it in haste it
[1:34:04] is the lord's passover
[1:34:06] that what we see what we have been
[1:34:08] looking at tonight is how the believer
[1:34:11] is actually living out
[1:34:13] exodus 12 right now
[1:34:16] what about the rest of you guys come on
[1:34:18] come on come on amen
[1:34:20] right okay so now look
[1:34:24] let's go over here to
[1:34:25] ephesians six and keep your hand there
[1:34:28] on ephesians 12 or on
[1:34:30] exodus 12.
[1:34:32] so if you go over here to ephesians 6
[1:34:36] now i don't know if you know this this
[1:34:38] little nugget
[1:34:40] but if you have a scofield bible
[1:34:43] and you read the footnotes at the
[1:34:45] beginning of the book of ephesians
[1:34:48] the theologians believe
[1:34:50] that the book the letter to the
[1:34:52] ephesians
[1:34:53] was never
[1:34:55] it was never labeled
[1:34:57] it wasn't labeled the letter to the
[1:34:58] ephesians and they actually believe
[1:35:01] that the book of
[1:35:02] ephesians was written
[1:35:04] to the lady of sans
[1:35:08] the same letter that went to the first
[1:35:10] church
[1:35:11] is the same letter that goes to the last
[1:35:12] church
[1:35:15] amen amen
[1:35:17] so look here he says in
[1:35:19] ephesians 6
[1:35:21] 10
[1:35:22] it says finally my brethren be strong in
[1:35:25] the lord and in the power is might put
[1:35:26] on the whole armor of god that you may
[1:35:29] be able to stand against the wiles of
[1:35:31] the devil
[1:35:32] right because we're in the last stage
[1:35:35] the fire's been turned up right
[1:35:37] it says for we wrestle not against flesh
[1:35:39] and blood but against principalities
[1:35:41] powers the rulers of darkness of this
[1:35:44] world against spiritual wickedness in
[1:35:46] high places therefore take unto you the
[1:35:49] whole armor of god that you may be able
[1:35:51] to withstand in the evil day and having
[1:35:54] done all to stand
[1:35:56] he says stand there for having your
[1:35:59] loins gird about with truth
[1:36:01] okay
[1:36:02] exodus 11 says
[1:36:04] shall eat it with your loins girded okay
[1:36:08] so when they put this on you back in the
[1:36:11] roman days
[1:36:12] when they put this on you
[1:36:14] they had this it's like a uh
[1:36:18] a vest and they put it on over the over
[1:36:21] you put it on underneath
[1:36:22] and then you buckled it
[1:36:24] and then all of your armor attaches to
[1:36:27] that
[1:36:28] so if you don't have your loins gird
[1:36:30] about with truth you're lost
[1:36:33] you forgot your girdle
[1:36:36] you got to start with oh just put the
[1:36:37] breastplate on no no no because see the
[1:36:40] breastplate attaches to the truth
[1:36:44] the breastplate goes on the truth but
[1:36:46] you'll notice in exodus there is no
[1:36:48] breastplate
[1:36:54] because you know when they left egypt
[1:36:56] that night
[1:36:57] they weren't going into a battle
[1:37:00] they were going out into the wilderness
[1:37:06] i want you to notice something else
[1:37:09] he says put on the whole armor of god
[1:37:11] that you may be able to withstand in the
[1:37:12] evil day says therefore stand having
[1:37:14] your loin skirt about with truth and
[1:37:16] having on the breastplate of
[1:37:18] righteousness so when you put on the
[1:37:20] breastplate
[1:37:21] that means the blood is covering your
[1:37:23] heart
[1:37:24] right because you're not righteous
[1:37:26] without his blood
[1:37:27] you put the breast plate on and that
[1:37:30] that protects
[1:37:31] all your good organs
[1:37:34] yeah it takes care of your heart
[1:37:36] takes care of your your ribs
[1:37:39] your liver your kidneys your gallbladder
[1:37:42] your stomach everything's all covered up
[1:37:43] with the breastplate
[1:37:45] you have the breastplate on but you see
[1:37:47] the children of israel in the first
[1:37:48] exodus they were going into a battle
[1:37:50] they didn't have a breastplate
[1:37:53] they didn't need a breastplate
[1:37:55] but you need one
[1:37:59] he says and your feet shod with the
[1:38:01] preparation of the gospel of peace
[1:38:04] okay so we look back in exodus 12 right
[1:38:08] have have your loins girded and your
[1:38:10] feet shod right
[1:38:13] the children of god will be known as
[1:38:14] peacemakers we're not separators
[1:38:18] we don't argue in fuss
[1:38:20] sometimes we do but that's only the
[1:38:22] flesh
[1:38:23] the heat needs to turn up
[1:38:25] because when the heat turns up we'll
[1:38:26] argue less
[1:38:29] and he says above all taking the shield
[1:38:32] of faith
[1:38:33] so now he says so now you've got the
[1:38:35] shield of faith i'm going to read you
[1:38:37] this quote
[1:38:39] brother branham says so he says the last
[1:38:40] plague is death
[1:38:42] not spiritually it's but spiritually
[1:38:44] speaking death spiritually in the church
[1:38:47] you notice amongst the sons spiritual
[1:38:49] death
[1:38:50] he says and now in christianity versus
[1:38:53] idolatry he says now he says
[1:38:56] no you got to put this on with an
[1:38:58] individual ought to be dressed let us
[1:39:00] put on the whole armor of god amen the
[1:39:02] helmet of salvation amen we got to put
[1:39:05] on the helmet of salvation that's the
[1:39:07] only way to protect you know somebody
[1:39:09] who's really saved
[1:39:11] they got a helmet on
[1:39:13] if you can convince somebody that
[1:39:14] they're not saved they'll take their
[1:39:16] helmet off you know what happens if
[1:39:18] you're in a battle and somebody's
[1:39:19] shooting at you with a a gun
[1:39:22] it'll take the whole
[1:39:24] you know if it shoots you here take the
[1:39:25] whole back of your head off
[1:39:28] but if you have the helmet of salvation
[1:39:29] on you're protected
[1:39:31] because we are in a battle
[1:39:34] brother branham said he says so he says
[1:39:36] you you put on the helmet of salvation
[1:39:39] he says and then he says put on this get
[1:39:42] this great big shield he says it's the
[1:39:45] size of a door
[1:39:48] oh you're oh praise lord
[1:39:51] a shield
[1:39:52] now when a christian comes in this army
[1:39:55] and you're issued all your stuff did you
[1:39:57] get issued all your stuff brother
[1:39:58] ferguson they gave you clothes they gave
[1:40:00] you boots they gave you everything well
[1:40:03] when you come in this army because
[1:40:04] you've never been in a battle before
[1:40:06] we're going to give you a shield this
[1:40:08] big
[1:40:10] that's right
[1:40:11] you know what happens
[1:40:13] in a roman army when they used to fight
[1:40:15] like that they just had their footmen
[1:40:17] foot men were expendable
[1:40:19] and so the footmen had the biggest
[1:40:20] shields and not only did the footmen
[1:40:23] have a big shield the idea was they had
[1:40:25] this really long spear
[1:40:27] because they didn't want to get close to
[1:40:29] the enemy
[1:40:30] so i got a big shield and i get this
[1:40:31] long spear now from here i can kill
[1:40:33] brother mark he can't get near me
[1:40:36] and then my brother next to me his
[1:40:37] she'll go right next to mine and we can
[1:40:40] all line up and then we can push the
[1:40:41] enemy back we don't have to get close to
[1:40:43] the enemy we don't have to fight with
[1:40:45] him we're just going to be here like
[1:40:46] this but see after you pass a test a
[1:40:49] while the sergeant comes out and says
[1:40:52] what are you doing
[1:40:54] do you want to fight like that are you
[1:40:56] fighting in the army of god
[1:40:58] first thing he does he takes away that
[1:40:59] big shield he says what do you want to
[1:41:01] be
[1:41:01] i think i might want to be an archer i
[1:41:03] said okay
[1:41:05] archer can't walk around with a shield
[1:41:07] the size of a door
[1:41:08] what's he gonna do with that so he maybe
[1:41:11] he don't get a shield maybe he gets a
[1:41:13] quiver and a bow and he hides behind the
[1:41:15] foot man
[1:41:17] yeah and they shoot the arrows up in the
[1:41:19] air they also back then what they used
[1:41:21] to do they'd all get back and they'd
[1:41:23] have like a thousand archers and they'd
[1:41:25] all pull back and they'd say fire and
[1:41:27] the enemy on the other side they're
[1:41:28] standing there with their shields and
[1:41:30] their spears and them arrows come down
[1:41:32] from the ceiling and if they don't have
[1:41:34] their breastplate on it goes right in
[1:41:36] their collarbone and kills them because
[1:41:38] the arrows are coming right down
[1:41:40] that's why you gotta have the shield
[1:41:41] ahead you gotta have the helmet of
[1:41:42] salvation on that's why you gotta have
[1:41:44] the shield of faith okay
[1:41:46] but now let's say you don't want to be
[1:41:47] archer
[1:41:49] maybe you want to be a commando
[1:41:52] you know see the commandos they're
[1:41:54] fearless
[1:41:55] commando he don't care i'll get right in
[1:41:58] front of that devil i want to fight him
[1:42:00] so you know you give that guy you give
[1:42:02] him a little shield maybe big enough
[1:42:04] that he can just strap it on his arm now
[1:42:06] he's flexible he can move that thing
[1:42:07] around because he's fast
[1:42:09] and they give him they don't give him a
[1:42:11] 10 foot long sword
[1:42:13] they have a little tiny sword because
[1:42:14] he's skilled at that
[1:42:16] and they train him and then when they go
[1:42:18] into battle they have this the guys that
[1:42:21] are weak in faith that have the big
[1:42:22] shields and the long spears they're in
[1:42:24] the front they're pushing the enemy back
[1:42:26] but then the commandos i say this guy
[1:42:28] archers shoot they shoot
[1:42:30] then the commandos come up the commandos
[1:42:33] sneak around they're fast they go out
[1:42:35] there and they just get right they get
[1:42:37] right in the face of the enemy
[1:42:40] yes
[1:42:41] look that's what paul is talking about
[1:42:42] here in the lady hussain
[1:42:44] book ephesian
[1:42:46] book
[1:42:48] he says
[1:42:50] verse 16 he says above all taking the
[1:42:52] shield of faith wherewith ye shall be
[1:42:54] able to quench all the fiery darts of
[1:42:57] the wicked that's what the shield's for
[1:43:00] a commando he can look because he's
[1:43:02] looking he's looking everywhere
[1:43:04] and when he sees the enemy coming in
[1:43:06] he's got he moves his shield up to block
[1:43:08] the dart to block the arrow and then he
[1:43:11] takes and he can cut
[1:43:13] into the enemy he can cut
[1:43:16] he can cut he can go he can push him
[1:43:18] back
[1:43:19] because he's got intelligence
[1:43:21] he's got the helmet he knows what god
[1:43:23] wants done with his word he has a strong
[1:43:25] arm of faith he's not hiding behind a
[1:43:28] shield
[1:43:29] he's right out there amen
[1:43:31] amen
[1:43:33] he says wherein you should be able to
[1:43:35] quench all the fiery darts
[1:43:37] of the wicked and take the helmet of
[1:43:39] salvation and the sword of the spirit
[1:43:41] which is the word of god amen
[1:43:44] the word of god belongs to those that
[1:43:46] are of age
[1:43:48] right

[1:44:45] until they had been tried and weeded out
[1:44:48] and they crossed over jordan into the
[1:44:50] promised land
[1:44:52] and then they had to put on the full
