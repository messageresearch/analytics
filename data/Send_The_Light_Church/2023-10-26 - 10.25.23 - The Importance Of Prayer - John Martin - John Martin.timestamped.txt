[0:00] and that is try to spend a a few minutes
[0:04] I don't know maybe 15 minutes and just
[0:05] go through some scriptures about
[0:08] prayer and and our whole goal is to try
[0:11] to generate more of a uh a faith that
[0:16] when we do spend our time in prayer we
[0:22] can have
[0:24] an of
[0:26] fire and just more faith and and what it
[0:29] takes to the Bible says the effectual
[0:32] fervent prayer of a righteous man
[0:34] availeth much and so we believe that
[0:37] we're just going to read one scripture
[0:38] and then have you be seated um and it's
[0:41] going to be Jeremiah chapter
[0:45] 29 and this is a familiar scripture to
[0:49] us but we want to try to break it down
[0:52] the way that David saw saw the scripture
[0:57] here so Jeremiah 29 ver verse 11 says
[1:00] for I know the thoughts that I think
[1:01] toward you saith the Lord thoughts of
[1:05] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:08] expected end now we that's a promise
[1:12] that we hold on to right all right then
[1:16] shall ye call upon me and ye shall go
[1:19] and pray unto me and I will hearken unto
[1:21] you and ye shall seek me and find me
[1:23] when you search for me with all your
[1:25] heart and I will be found of you sayeth
[1:28] the Lord you may be SE did now actually
[1:31] these are this scripture and one more
[1:33] we're going to get into if we were to
[1:36] continue the series on precious
[1:38] promises um we brought a subject of by
[1:44] meeting God's con conditions it actually
[1:46] gives us faith for the promise so when
[1:49] we look at this Promise This Promise is
[1:51] an expected end this promise is peace
[1:55] and but we have to meet God's conditions
[1:59] and and so he's he's telling us here in
[2:01] the
[2:02] scripture uh you shall go and pray unto
[2:05] me and I will hearken unto you and ye
[2:08] shall seek me and find me when you
[2:12] search for me with all your heart and
[2:13] that that little bit there of searching
[2:16] with all your
[2:17] heart it it it's very critical
[2:23] to to receive the promise and if we if
[2:26] we if we did that part of just seeking
[2:30] God more when we enter and we go into uh
[2:32] we're having prayer tonight so we're
[2:34] going to be praying one for another
[2:35] we're going to be praying for certain
[2:36] needs and if we can actually just enter
[2:39] in with more of our
[2:42] heart I know it's it's like simple but
[2:45] it's something that we maybe you know we
[2:49] just try to spend that hour in prayer or
[2:52] that time whatever time it is that we
[2:53] end up praying we just end up putting
[2:56] that in prayer we don't put too much
[2:58] emphasis on all the heart and God is
[3:01] looking for all the heart
[3:04] amen okay
[3:07] and Jude CH uh we don't want to turn
[3:09] there but I'm just going to quote it
[3:11] Jude verse 20 says building up yourself
[3:14] in the Most Holy Faith praying in the
[3:17] Holy Ghost so we literally can build
[3:20] ourselves up during this time of prayer
[3:22] meeting it's not just you know we're
[3:24] having a prayer meet but we can actually
[3:26] build ourselves up in the Most Holy
[3:28] Faith by praying in the holy spirit so
[3:32] we get more of our heart into this time
[3:34] of prayer so if you have a Bible turn
[3:37] with me to uh Daniel chapter n and I
[3:40] just want to read uh the quite a bit of
[3:44] this prayer this was uh Daniel's prayer
[3:48] concerning the very
[3:50] uh
[3:52] uh scriptures that we we just read there
[3:57] in in Jer Jeremiah
[4:00] and even though we're not the children
[4:05] of Israel that have been in Babylon we
[4:09] can still take this scripture because
[4:11] it's it's a promise that we're trying to
[4:12] claim for our life right an expected end
[4:15] that we would have peace well we have to
[4:17] do the
[4:18] fulfilling of our part and seeking God
[4:21] with all our heart and I believe that
[4:22] Daniel sets this example just perfect
[4:25] for all of
[4:26] us let's start with uh verse
[4:30] uh number three verse number three of
[4:33] Daniel chapter 9 and I set my face unto
[4:37] the Lord God to seek by
[4:40] Prayer by
[4:42] supplications with
[4:44] fastings and
[4:46] sackcloth and Ashes oh my my my my so
[4:51] it's not just prayer
[4:53] meeting it's
[4:56] supplications
[4:58] supplications that's Earnest prayer
[5:00] that's what that word means if you look
[5:01] that up and it's different than in the
[5:03] New Testament but here in the Old
[5:05] Testament it's meaning Earnest prayer
[5:08] and then it says with fasting so now
[5:11] you're going to go without food you're
[5:13] going to actually hurt your
[5:16] body to because you're you're you're
[5:19] more you want more of your heart to be
[5:21] in it okay and then it says with
[5:25] sackcloth and Ashes of
[5:28] course um
[5:30] in in the Old Testament they literally
[5:33] would have a
[5:35] sackcloth and and Ashes and they would
[5:37] they would wear this on their outside of
[5:39] their body and it was worn to show
[5:44] remorse is what it was for and and here
[5:49] this is what Daniel was doing now of
[5:52] course in our day we don't wear it on
[5:55] the
[5:56] outside right it we it's on the
[6:01] inside and and God sees our heart but
[6:05] we're dressed in
[6:07] humility and it's Don uh Den denotes
[6:12] one's guilt so we're going to come
[6:14] before the Lord in this prayer meeting
[6:16] and we're all
[6:19] guilty but but sometimes we don't want
[6:21] to show that well Daniel saying here if
[6:25] you if you want to seek the Lord with
[6:26] all the heart you got to be dressed with
[6:29] SA cloth and ases so you're the inside
[6:31] of you's got to be um have that remorse
[6:35] for the wrong that you have done that we
[6:38] have done and that we need to take
[6:41] responsibility and not just uh Lord
[6:44] cover me with your blood okay God bless
[6:46] everybody and then prayer prayer is over
[6:49] with you know that's not with all of our
[6:51] heart even though you may mean those
[6:54] words we still have to get a fervency
[6:58] into our prayer prayer so he's listing
[7:01] all these things and he said and I
[7:03] prayed unto the Lord in verse four my
[7:06] God and made my what
[7:09] confession and said oh Lord the great
[7:13] and Dreadful God keeping the Covenant
[7:18] and mercy to them that love him and to
[7:21] them that keep his commandments so he's
[7:23] a he's addressing how great God is who
[7:27] he is and going to make his confession
[7:31] before him and he says here in verse 5
[7:34] we have sinned and have committed an
[7:37] iniquity and have done wickedly and have
[7:41] rebelled uh even by departing from thy
[7:44] precepts and from thy
[7:48] judgments that's a good confession there
[7:51] don't you
[7:52] think neither have we hearkened unto thy
[7:55] servants the prophets which spake in thy
[7:58] name for our Kings and princes and our
[8:01] fathers and to all the people of the
[8:03] land oh Lord righteousness belongeth
[8:07] unto thee but unto us confusion of faces
[8:12] so he's making a separation here in is
[8:15] seeking the Lord that there is a
[8:17] difference between him between God and
[8:22] himself God is righteous and we're we
[8:25] get full of confusion because the devil
[8:27] puts thoughts in our minds and we can
[8:29] just do this we could do that and and
[8:31] and really our will is just going to
[8:34] bring confusion to our
[8:37] lives all right as it as at this day to
[8:43] the men of Judah and to the inhabitants
[8:45] of Jerusalem and to all
[8:48] Israel that are near and that are far
[8:51] off through all the countries whether
[8:54] thou drivest them because of their trans
[8:59] trespass that they have trespassed
[9:02] against
[9:03] thee wow oh Lord to us
[9:09] belongeth confusion of
[9:12] face belongs to us we deserve it to our
[9:17] Kings to our princes to our fathers
[9:19] because we have sinned against
[9:23] thee to the Lord Our God belong mercies
[9:27] and forgiveness
[9:30] though we have rebelled against him
[9:34] neither have we obeyed the voice of the
[9:36] Lord Our God to walk in his laws which
[9:39] he set before us by his servants and the
[9:43] prophets yeah all Israel have
[9:46] transgressed thy law it kind of sounds
[9:49] just like what what what Jesus said uh
[9:53] there's none good but God and Paul said
[9:55] there's none righteous no not one and
[9:59] and and so if we can just realize that
[10:01] the only good that's ever in US is of
[10:04] god it would just help us to approach
[10:06] with more of our our our heart because
[10:09] look if if if we just you know quickly
[10:11] think you know God cover me with your
[10:13] blood I'm just coming to you now in
[10:15] prayer we're never going to get into the
[10:17] deepness and I'll tell you if God's holy
[10:19] spirit does come to you and bless you
[10:21] with his presence you will begin to
[10:24] repent of those things you will because
[10:27] he just he just demand s it to enter in
[10:30] now I'm thankful for the times that his
[10:32] presence comes and you just you just
[10:34] didn't hardly expect it as it were you
[10:36] know but when it comes you do offer the
[10:40] you do offer you just you make sure that
[10:43] everything is clean and right because
[10:45] you you don't want to be in his presence
[10:46] without pleasing
[10:49] him all right verse
[10:51] 11 um Y and all Israel have transgressed
[10:54] thy law even the departing that they
[10:57] might not obey the voice there for the
[10:59] curse is poured upon us and the oath
[11:03] that is written in the law of Moses the
[11:05] servant of God because we have sinned
[11:07] against him and he have confirmed his
[11:10] words which he has spake against us and
[11:13] against our our judges and that judged
[11:16] Us by bringing upon us a a great evil
[11:20] for under the whole heaven have not been
[11:23] done as have been done upon Jerusalem to
[11:27] whom much is given much is is required
[11:30] amen as it is written in the law of
[11:32] Moses all this evil has come upon us yet
[11:37] may we not our prayer before the Lord
[11:39] Our God that we might turn from our
[11:42] iniquities and understand thy truth
[11:45] therefore have the Lord watched upon the
[11:49] evil and brought it upon us think about
[11:53] that and brought it upon us for the Lord
[11:54] our God is righteous in all his Works
[11:57] which he doeth for we we obeyed not his
[12:01] voice I mean just I I know this just
[12:03] looks like it's like constantly hitting
[12:06] us over the head but it it's not it's
[12:10] it's what's coming out of David's heart
[12:12] this is how he
[12:14] feels and I believe that this is the
[12:18] type of prayer that gets us not only
[12:20] into the presence of the Lord but
[12:23] actually builds our faith and confidence
[12:25] that we could have an expected in
[12:28] because we met his
[12:30] requirements and now oh Lord Our God
[12:34] thou has brought
[12:35] forth has brought thy people forth out
[12:38] of the land of Egypt with a mighty hand
[12:40] and has gotten thee Renown at as it as
[12:44] at this day we have sinned we have done
[12:47] wickedly oh Lord according to all thy
[12:49] righteousness I beseech thee let thine
[12:52] anger and thy Fury be turned away from
[12:56] thy City Jerusalem thy Holy Mountain
[13:00] because for our sins and for iniquities
[13:04] of our fathers Jerusalem and thy people
[13:07] are become a reproach to all that are
[13:10] about us now therefore Our God he the
[13:15] prayer of thy
[13:18] servant here he's this far in his prayer
[13:23] and he's saying Lord hear our
[13:25] prayer he's still in that Lord I'm not
[13:30] sure that I found the favor with you and
[13:34] I'm asking for your mercy I'm asking for
[13:37] your grace you know sometimes we can
[13:40] just we can just pray and when we get
[13:43] done it's just a prayer and there was no
[13:45] like contact and I I believe that this
[13:49] type of spirit gets us more in contact
[13:51] and you know what happens when his
[13:52] presence comes it just he just squeezes
[13:55] your heart the tears fall down and you
[13:58] you feel unworthy and then you feel
[14:01] clean and then you're full of
[14:05] joy amen it's just
[14:08] beautiful now therefore Oh Oh Our God
[14:13] hear the prayer of thy servant and his
[14:15] supplications and cause thy face to
[14:18] shine upon thy Sanctuary that is
[14:22] desolate for the Lord's sake oh my God
[14:26] incline thine ear and hear and open
[14:28] thine eyes and behold our
[14:31] desolations and the city which is called
[14:33] by thy name for we do not present our
[14:37] supplications
[14:39] before thee for our
[14:43] righteousness because our righteousness
[14:45] is filth your EGS but for thy great
[14:48] mercies that's why we're coming before
[14:50] the Lord oh Lord hear oh Lord forgive oh
[14:54] Lord and hearken and do defer not for
[14:58] thy own sake oh my God for thy City and
[15:01] thy people are called by thy name what a
[15:06] beautiful beautiful
[15:09] prayer and this is the the the the 70
[15:13] weeks of the years uh part two here that
[15:17] scoffield has and verse 20 and while I
[15:20] was
[15:21] speaking and praying and
[15:25] confessing my sins and the sins of My
[15:30] People Israel and presenting my
[15:33] supplications before the Lord my God for
[15:37] the Holy Mountain of my God yay whilst I
[15:41] was speaking in prayer even the man
[15:45] Gabriel whom I have seen in the vision
[15:49] at the beginning being cused to fly
[15:53] swiftly touched me about the time of the
[15:57] evening I
[15:59] oblation and he informed me and talked
[16:03] with me and said oh Daniel I am now come
[16:06] forth to give thee skill and
[16:09] understanding
[16:12] am it took a little travailing in prayer
[16:17] and that's what we got to realize we're
[16:19] not just here to pray for a little bit
[16:21] we're here to get contact with God we
[16:23] got to meet
[16:25] him and he says at the beginning of thy
[16:28] supp ations the Commandment came forth
[16:32] and I am come to show thee so at the
[16:36] very beginning of his prayer God
[16:38] commands Gabriel
[16:41] go look we just we need to know that God
[16:45] is working on the other side
[16:47] amen and we just we just we want to
[16:50] follow the
[16:52] example you know if if if I'm going to
[16:54] learn how to pray it's going to be an
[16:56] example here in the Bible that that I
[16:58] can learn from and I I believe that God
[17:02] is
[17:03] touched
[17:06] by a a
[17:08] spirit that is more humble and contrite
[17:11] than perhaps than what we're used to
[17:13] using and I it's okay if we get more
[17:16] humble more more contrite it's okay if
[17:19] we break down more it won't hurt us it
[17:22] won't hurt us in fact it'll just open
[17:25] the door for the Lord to come and and
[17:28] fill us with his spirit so let's let's
[17:30] stand together and we'll sing a little
[17:32] chorus as we go to to seek him you know
[17:35] brother brother Ron was talking
[17:38] about uh believing like Christ is is
[17:41] here like he's here knowing he's here
[17:43] and I'll just say we we need to praise
[17:46] him like we know he's here let's let's
[17:50] pray like we know he's
[17:52] here um I just want to add this to the
[17:56] the prayer request brother Moses who was
[17:59] came and ministered for us from Honduras
[18:02] he had contacted us and wanted us to
[18:05] pray for his Pastor which is brother
[18:06] Casco and himself so if we could
[18:10] remember them when we pray for all the
[18:13] missionaries
