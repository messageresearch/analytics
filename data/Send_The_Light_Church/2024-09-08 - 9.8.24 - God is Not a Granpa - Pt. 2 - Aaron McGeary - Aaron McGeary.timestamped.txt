[33:28] possibly can and so just so grateful
[33:30] that we had uh the chance to come even
[33:33] though it's a short trip we're glad that
[33:34] we could be here I always let everyone
[33:36] know it's not a vacation for me because
[33:38] I work and uh yesterday I was talking to
[33:41] Brother John we had some time just to
[33:43] kind of hang out a little bit and I
[33:44] mentioned that I'd like to help him do
[33:46] some things maybe around the shop there
[33:48] around the garage and he said no when
[33:50] you come here you don't need to work and
[33:52] I'm
[33:53] like what do you think I'd do for a
[33:55] living and so uh
[33:58] um I said well sometimes it's that
[34:00] physical labor that I actually enjoy uh
[34:03] more than just the ministry and we still
[34:04] do work in the practice of law but
[34:06] that's become less and less and we're
[34:07] grateful for that that the Lord has
[34:09] freed us up to be able just to focus on
[34:11] Ministry but we love you we love you all
[34:13] very very much brother John your dear
[34:15] friend your dear example and so we
[34:17] appreciate the privilege you give us
[34:18] today to minister Ephesians chapter 4
[34:21] we'll start with verse 7 we'll read to
[34:23] verse 16 you weren't here Wednesday
[34:25] night you won't be too far behind uh but
[34:28] we so we will just give a few things
[34:30] just to recap the foundation that we
[34:32] ministered on Wednesday night but our
[34:34] title is God is not a
[34:36] grandpa but unto every one of us is
[34:38] given Grace according to the measure of
[34:40] the gift of Christ wherefore he saith
[34:43] when he ascended up on high he led
[34:45] captivity captive and gave gifts unto
[34:47] men now that he ascended what is it but
[34:50] that he also descended first into the
[34:52] lower parts of the earth he that
[34:54] descended is the same also that ascended
[34:56] up far above all heavens that he might
[34:58] fill all things and he gave some
[35:01] Apostles and some prophets and some
[35:02] evangelists and some pastors and
[35:04] teachers for the perfecting of the
[35:06] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[35:08] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[35:11] we all come in the unity of the faith
[35:13] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[35:15] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[35:18] the stature of the fullness of Christ
[35:21] that we henceforth be no more children
[35:22] tossed to and fro and carried about with
[35:24] every wind of Doctrine by the slight of
[35:26] men and cunny crafted
[35:28] whereby they lie and wait to deceive but
[35:30] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[35:33] into him in all things which is the head
[35:35] even Christ from whom the whole body is
[35:37] fitly joined together and compacted by
[35:40] that which every joint supplieth
[35:41] according to the effectual working in
[35:43] the measure of every part maketh
[35:45] increase of the body un the edifying of
[35:47] itself in love wow what poetry if we
[35:51] could just bow our heads in prayer
[35:53] gracious heavenly father today Lord as
[35:55] we have this opportunity to be together
[35:57] we're grateful for it thank you Lord we
[35:59] believe that you're already here in our
[36:01] midst because you promised to be where
[36:03] two or three are gathered in your name
[36:04] there you'll be Lord we believe that
[36:06] you're amongst us because we've lifted
[36:08] up praises to you and you inhabit the
[36:10] Praises of your people and Lord as all
[36:13] have come here that you knew would be
[36:16] here as we sit in your divine presence
[36:18] we ask now that you'd speak to our
[36:19] hearts and Lord if there be those
[36:21] unfamiliar with me or my Ministry Lord
[36:24] may they just realize that it's the word
[36:26] that should have preeminence it's not
[36:27] the man it's but the matter which has
[36:29] spoken so Lord help me to stay focused
[36:32] on the word Lord that the Bible would
[36:34] become alive To Us by Revelation help
[36:36] all of us father just to lay aside bias
[36:39] and any uncomfortable feelings that we
[36:41] might have and just expect you to speak
[36:43] to us as we have need of you we ask this
[36:45] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[36:48] amen you can be
[36:51] seated I've mentioned already that our
[36:53] title is God is not a grandpa
[36:57] and Wednesday night we'll just give a
[36:59] quick summary of where we were Wednesday
[37:01] night and sister an I don't know if you
[37:03] have that slide uh from Wednesday night
[37:06] maybe just show it real quick that
[37:08] opening slide we used but it was an
[37:10] article written um way back in the 60s
[37:13] in the Full Gospel businessman's voice
[37:16] and uh David deissy wrote an article and
[37:18] he said God has no grandsons and he told
[37:21] the story of uh how that the Lord just
[37:23] kind of spoke that and it was ringing in
[37:25] his ears and it just impressed him and
[37:27] he wrote an article in which he said and
[37:30] did you have the slide of the article
[37:31] there it is and I know it's written
[37:33] quite some time ago but yet we know that
[37:36] uh brother brandham quoted it many many
[37:38] times God has no Pentecostal children
[37:40] God has no grandchildren but this
[37:43] thought is really profound it's God not
[37:45] having any grandchildren and as we
[37:48] looked at it Wednesday night we felt
[37:49] like if there's some sort of emphasis
[37:51] there's something there in it there's a
[37:53] reason for it and we found that the
[37:55] chief reason that God has no Grant Sons
[37:57] is you must be born again that God only
[38:01] has Sons and Daughters he does not have
[38:03] grandsons he does not have cousins he's
[38:05] never been an uncle and God has no
[38:08] grandsons or granddaughters he only has
[38:10] sons and daughters so that means that
[38:13] all all God's seed are born direct from
[38:16] him when we look at it in the natural we
[38:18] see that people can be related and we
[38:19] can do DNA test and you could find that
[38:22] you're related to this person you're
[38:23] related to that person they could see a
[38:24] genealogy and say oh this person is a
[38:27] grandchild of this individual I've often
[38:30] joked that I wanted to hand out DNA
[38:32] tests to my extended family on Christmas
[38:35] just to see who might be the serial
[38:36] killer when they start getting all
[38:38] nervous like are we really doing this we
[38:40] don't have to do this uh but there is a
[38:42] way that they can do this in the natural
[38:44] but when it comes to the spiritual Gene
[38:47] if you did a DNA test everyone's a
[38:49] direct descendant God is the father
[38:51] there's no well you're distantly related
[38:53] to God and so we conclude from that God
[38:56] is not a Grandpa regardless of the new
[39:00] birth experience that your parents may
[39:02] have had you must be born again also and
[39:05] what was at the real heart of of that
[39:08] emphasis was seen in the scripture in
[39:10] many different places that God is not a
[39:13] man God is not a man that he would lie
[39:15] and let the words of man be a lie but
[39:17] let God's word be a truth be the truth
[39:19] God is not man where he repents like man
[39:21] and he does things like man does so God
[39:24] not being a man he cannot have
[39:27] grandchildren and this was to me the the
[39:29] kicker nor does he want them and to
[39:32] grandparents might be hard to get their
[39:34] head around the fact that God would not
[39:35] want to have grandchildren but that was
[39:38] uh one thing we wanted to emphasize is
[39:40] God is not a grandpa and he doesn't he's
[39:42] not missing anything in his mind because
[39:44] he doesn't even want to have
[39:45] grandchildren and so I want to uh take a
[39:48] step forward in this and give some
[39:50] reasons are just uh build upon that
[39:53] foundation and something that might
[39:54] hopefully will make uh sense to us
[39:56] spiritually but the nature and
[39:58] responsibility of a grandparent is
[40:00] different than that of parents and I
[40:02] think that may be obvious and we're
[40:04] talking about the general rule not the
[40:06] role that sometimes grandparents F feel
[40:08] when uh something happens to parents or
[40:11] parents need the help and grandparents
[40:12] will step in and and be the primary
[40:15] caretaker and sometimes grandparents
[40:17] will raise their grandchildren as the
[40:19] parents so they can assume that role but
[40:22] we're acknowledging the fact that it's
[40:24] not the grandparents responsibility it's
[40:26] something extra that they take on it's
[40:28] something they have to step into and
[40:31] just to kind of wet our whistle a little
[40:32] bit on what I mean by that I have a few
[40:34] statements out of many that we could
[40:36] find about Grandparents I think I
[40:38] mentioned these maybe at the very end
[40:40] Wednesday but grandchildren are the
[40:41] reward you get for keeping their parents
[40:44] alive and I guess it implies maybe if
[40:46] you don't strangle them when they're
[40:48] kids if they are able to grow up a and
[40:50] have children that the grandchildren are
[40:52] the reward for you not killing them and
[40:55] uh or they say the opposite that grand
[40:57] grandchildren are the reward for
[40:58] surviving your children that if they
[41:00] haven't killed you that grandchildren
[41:01] are the reward for doing that and then
[41:04] the there statement is made I think this
[41:06] was written in a book being a
[41:08] grandparent sufficiently removes us from
[41:11] the
[41:11] responsibilities so that we can be
[41:14] friends and it implies that a a parent
[41:17] has a special responsibility and a
[41:19] special relationship to their child to
[41:22] uh raise them and to discipline and that
[41:26] grandparents are maybe not completely
[41:28] removed but they're sufficiently enough
[41:30] removed to where they don't have to
[41:32] worry about that or have the primary
[41:34] burden responsibility of it so they can
[41:36] just be friends with the grandchildren
[41:38] and I think that's a beautiful part and
[41:40] all the grandparents say amen amen and
[41:43] then to me this is the one that really
[41:45] serves my purpose so it may be selfish
[41:47] if I pick this one out to end on but it
[41:49] says when grandparents enter the door
[41:51] discipline flies out the
[41:53] window and it was in this that I learned
[41:56] why God has no grandchildren because and
[41:59] I watched how my dad treated my kids I
[42:02] was like well no wonder there's there's
[42:04] no uh respect for what the parents want
[42:07] yeah give them coffee let them chew
[42:09] candy at 2 o'clock in the morning it was
[42:10] kind of like wanting to be the cool
[42:12] Grandpa may he wasn't that bad but it
[42:14] was then that I realized that the the
[42:16] grandpa can just come and go he can
[42:18] yo-yo you know can be around for the fun
[42:20] stage and when things get difficult hey
[42:22] I'm out of here we'll see you later and
[42:24] so it is true that they my I think my
[42:27] grand my my kids grandparents in Texas
[42:30] even had a sign that once you cross this
[42:32] threshold there's no more rules does
[42:34] anybody remember what it
[42:35] said no but you remember the sign it was
[42:38] a sign that basically said grandkids are
[42:40] just free to do whatever they want once
[42:42] they enter into this house and so that
[42:44] kind of helps us understand this
[42:46] distinct relationship between a
[42:48] grandparent to a grandchild and how
[42:50] different it is from that of a parent
[42:53] and these statements reflect the
[42:54] difference in Dynamics whereas a parent
[42:56] a par has a burden and it has a they
[42:59] have a great responsibility whereas the
[43:01] grandparent Dynamic is free from that
[43:03] grandparents do not have the primary
[43:05] responsibility of raising the children
[43:07] and instructing them and and maybe more
[43:09] importantly correcting and disciplining
[43:12] and it's not that they don't have a role
[43:14] in that they just don't have the primary
[43:16] responsibility and burden a grandparent
[43:19] isn't fashioning the vision the
[43:21] grandparent isn't the one taking the
[43:23] lead but a grandparent should catch the
[43:24] vision of the parents and support them
[43:26] in that even if they have one different
[43:28] and say well I wouldn't raise them that
[43:30] way but I want to respect the way that
[43:31] you're doing and I want to support you
[43:33] and I want to reinforce that and I could
[43:35] say that uh brother John and sister
[43:37] Cheryl have been amazing in that there's
[43:39] been times in our children being raised
[43:41] where we've uh benefited from uh brother
[43:44] John and sister Shell catching the
[43:45] vision and seeing what we're trying to
[43:47] do and reinforcing that and taking an
[43:48] active role and encouraging them so this
[43:51] isn't me taking a shot at my in-laws
[43:53] today it really is just uh me a point
[43:57] about the difference in
[43:59] grandparents and I think you can all I
[44:02] I'm not a grandparent so I'm a I'm a
[44:04] great dad I hope but I'm not a
[44:07] grandparent but grandparents can enjoy
[44:09] the fun of the grandchildren they can
[44:11] have the fellowship they can have the
[44:13] Friendship they can Frolic and play and
[44:16] that can be all that they do in other
[44:19] words they they can enjoy the Frolic
[44:20] they can enjoy the play they can enjoy
[44:23] all the things that come with uh being a
[44:25] grandparent because in Proverbs chap
[44:27] 22:6 it says train up a child in the way
[44:30] that he should go and when he is old he
[44:32] will not depart from it that
[44:34] responsibility isn't the primary role of
[44:36] the grandparent that's the role and
[44:38] responsibility of the parents the ones
[44:40] that birth him the one that have the
[44:42] ones that have the more instinc of love
[44:43] and that and that drive to do so and
[44:47] that being said I think a lot of parents
[44:48] can relate to this I've heard it said
[44:50] many times but many parents often love a
[44:54] certain stage of
[44:56] childhood and as they either hold their
[44:58] baby or they they're in that a certain
[45:00] stage they say I want them to always
[45:02] stay like this anybody ever said that I
[45:05] hope they never grow up I love this size
[45:08] and I wish they would just stay at this
[45:10] stage and it might be that stage where
[45:12] they're not able to talk back it might
[45:14] be at that stage where you're just able
[45:16] to tell them what they want to do and
[45:17] they can't give you any opinions or
[45:19] they're completely dependent upon you
[45:20] and you feed them and you change their
[45:22] diapers and you pick their clothes out
[45:23] and and there's those that just love
[45:25] certain stages of that CH of childhood
[45:29] that stage of fun and enjoyment and uh
[45:32] that stage where you can just enjoy the
[45:34] personality uh before the real work of
[45:36] correcting and disciplin and instructing
[45:38] begins maybe it's that stage when you
[45:40] can just rely on well because Dad said
[45:43] so and there might be just certain
[45:45] stages can you relate with that there's
[45:46] people who say I hope they never I
[45:48] wouldn't I don't want them to grow up I
[45:49] want them to stay this size exactly and
[45:51] it might have something to do with the
[45:52] fact for the first two years you're
[45:54] trying to get them to talk and walk and
[45:55] the rest of their lives to sit and be
[45:57] quiet but the truth is there's stages
[46:00] where we really really love kids at a
[46:02] certain stage and we don't want them to
[46:04] grow up but God is not a man no he
[46:08] doesn't want
[46:09] grandchildren he wants to have children
[46:12] amen and God is not a man so he doesn't
[46:15] want them to stay
[46:16] children it's his desire that they grow
[46:19] up and so that's where that's at the
[46:21] heart of this thought God is not a
[46:22] grandpa as we looked at it Wednesday
[46:24] night you must be born again and this
[46:27] word birth brings you forth as a babe in
[46:30] Christ in 1 Timothy chapter 1 verse 23
[46:34] he says being born again this speaks of
[46:36] the believer not of corruptible seed but
[46:38] of Incorruptible seed by the word of God
[46:42] which liveth and abideth forever that is
[46:45] what every CH child of God is is born of
[46:49] The Incorruptible seed of the word of
[46:51] God and it is a seed that liveth and
[46:54] abideth forever so be born again and
[46:57] this is what caught Nicodemus off guard
[46:59] he says be born again how can a man who
[47:01] when he is old enter back into the womb
[47:03] of his mother and be born again because
[47:06] it does set forth the truth of infancy
[47:09] of being a newborn and being a babe and
[47:11] so being born again we begin in type as
[47:15] a babe or an infant in the body of
[47:18] Christ and that's spiritually as you are
[47:22] when you're born again you are
[47:23] spiritually a babe in Christ even Jesus
[47:27] himself in Luke 2: 11 and 12 did not
[47:30] come forth as a full grown mature man
[47:33] whereas Adam did Christ the second Adam
[47:36] comes forth a as a baby as it says as he
[47:38] speaks these angels speak to Shepherds
[47:41] for unto you is Born This Day in the
[47:43] city of David a savior which is Christ
[47:46] the lord so he had been born of a woman
[47:48] the prophecy spoke of him coming forth
[47:50] born of a woman and this shall be a sign
[47:52] unto you you shall find the Babe wrapped
[47:55] in swaddling clothes lying in a m manger
[47:59] this is how the Prince of Peace came
[48:00] forth this is how the mighty conqueror
[48:03] came forth this is how uh the the go the
[48:06] one upon whom the government would rest
[48:08] upon his shoulder he came forth as a
[48:10] babe wrapped in swaddling clothes lying
[48:13] in a manger and so just as Jesus Christ
[48:16] came forth as a babe you spiritually
[48:19] when you were born again come forth as a
[48:21] babe in Christ amen Jesus even makes
[48:23] this statement in Luke 10: 211 he says
[48:26] in that Jesus rejoiced in spirit and
[48:28] said I thank thee oh Father Lord of
[48:31] Heaven and Earth that thou Hast hid
[48:33] these things from the wise and prudent
[48:35] he's he's pointing out those who have
[48:37] lived it all seen it all heard it all
[48:39] know it all and and they have an answer
[48:42] to every question and you can't teach
[48:43] them anything so the wise and PR are the
[48:45] learn they've already learned they're
[48:47] now the teachers and so they they you
[48:49] can't reveal something to them because
[48:51] they they just have too much in their
[48:52] database where they're figuring
[48:53] everything out and they're going to tell
[48:54] you exactly what it is actually but he
[48:56] says and Hast revealed them unto babes
[48:59] amen even so father for so it seemed
[49:02] good in thy sight it's been revealed
[49:05] unto babes and the thought that is
[49:08] expressed in this scripture is you have
[49:10] the wise and prudent the learn the
[49:12] educated the grownup the mature but he
[49:15] reveals them unto babes who are able to
[49:18] learn amen such as our as such as are
[49:21] able to read and to uh they can learn
[49:24] they can grow from that state of being a
[49:27] babe one thing I don't mean to get lost
[49:29] in this but I find it fascinating but a
[49:31] baby's brain has tremendous
[49:34] neuroplasticity and I know you all know
[49:36] what that is so I won't tell you what it
[49:38] is but it's the ability to change and
[49:40] adapt after having new experiences right
[49:43] and so as a baby's brain has this
[49:45] neuroplasticity uh they say that in a
[49:47] baby it's always on it's always
[49:49] activated so they're wired to try
[49:52] something over and over and over again
[49:53] to master a skill like frustrating you
[49:58] they just they'll try something over and
[49:59] over again they don't ever give up
[50:00] whereas I guess if we as adults if we
[50:03] had to learn to walk again we might just
[50:04] like forget about it they make really
[50:06] good wheelchairs but for children they
[50:09] try and they try and they try and
[50:10] they'll try something over and over
[50:11] again until they Master a skill and this
[50:14] learning process that this as a babe
[50:16] creates these neural Pathways where they
[50:18] make this connection and in doing so
[50:21] that makes them more proficient and it
[50:23] opens up their brain to grow and to be
[50:24] used a little bit more I say grow just
[50:26] those neural Pathways and how it's
[50:28] exercised and this process is most
[50:31] constant within the first 5 years of a
[50:33] child's life and during this time they
[50:35] can quickly uh unlearn negative habits
[50:39] and replace them with good ones and
[50:40] things that are better and so this is a
[50:42] real critical stage in a in the
[50:44] development of a person is when they are
[50:46] a babe when they're an infant when
[50:47] they're a toddler because they're
[50:49] learning things and they can try and
[50:51] they can quickly unlearn bad things at a
[50:53] young age so Jesus says he revealed them
[50:56] unto babes such as would learn such as
[50:59] are able to be taught and to grow and of
[51:02] Jesus it was said in Luke 2:52 Jesus at
[51:05] the age of 12 goes home to be with his
[51:07] parents it says he submitted himself
[51:09] unto the parents and increased in wisdom
[51:12] in stature and in favor with God and man
[51:16] God entrusted his own son to Parenthood
[51:19] he didn't bring him forth as an orphan
[51:21] and and and was adopted and raised by
[51:23] grandparents or uncles and it wasn't
[51:25] Elizabeth that or Zachariah but it was
[51:29] uh John and Mary Joseph and Mary raised
[51:32] Jesus in WIS uh to increase in wisdom
[51:36] and stature and in favor with God and
[51:37] man and Jesus was subject unto his
[51:41] parents and
[51:43] grew so in 1 Peter chapter 2 veres 1 2
[51:47] and 3 Peter says this to the believer as
[51:51] he said prior the prior chapter we're
[51:53] Born Again by The Incorruptible seed of
[51:56] the word of God which liveth and abideth
[51:58] forever so having been born again and
[52:01] and with our spiritual neuroplasticity
[52:03] where we're able to learn things and and
[52:06] by Revelation increase these neural
[52:08] Pathways and and unlearn bad habits and
[52:11] keep trying and keep pressing he says
[52:13] lay aside all malice and all guile and
[52:15] hypocrisies and envies and all evil
[52:18] speakings this is what he's teaching the
[52:20] born again to do so there's a process of
[52:23] laying down but not just laying down
[52:25] there is a reaching out there's a a
[52:27] grabbing for as newborn babes desire the
[52:31] sincere milk of the word that you may
[52:33] grow thereby if so be that ye have
[52:36] tasted that the Lord is gracious if
[52:38] you've tasted his grace if you've been
[52:40] born again then to lay aside all these
[52:43] negative things lay aside all the things
[52:45] of the flesh a as paully puts it says
[52:48] put off the old man put on the new man
[52:51] and so lay aside all these negative
[52:53] human traits these things related to
[52:55] Fallen Humanity and as a newborn
[52:57] spiritual babe brought forth by the word
[53:00] Gene by the seed of God uh
[53:03] desire the sincere milk of the word and
[53:07] that would be for all of us we say oh
[53:09] well that's true there's a there's a
[53:11] stage at which that is the primary
[53:13] substance by which a child a baby is
[53:16] develops is solely by the milk and that
[53:19] it's desire the sincere milk of the word
[53:21] that you may grow so a babe who's been
[53:24] born again scripturally just even in
[53:26] following the pattern of what Peter is
[53:28] teaching should desire the milk of the
[53:31] word because that's the only way you're
[53:32] going to grow you're not going to grow
[53:34] by G you're not going to grow by
[53:35] hypocrisies and you're not just going to
[53:37] grow by laying down bad habits you've
[53:40] got to form a new one by Desiring the
[53:42] sincere milk of the word and feeding on
[53:44] the Milk of the word that would cause
[53:46] you to grow by the word and it says milk
[53:51] it's things that maybe are easier for
[53:53] you to process and things that you ought
[53:55] to enjoy and when when you're born again
[53:57] and you begin to enjoy the spirit of God
[53:59] uh you don't need to jump into the Book
[54:00] of Revelation and try to figure it out
[54:02] or bring out all the types in Ezekiel
[54:04] but just enjoy the grace of God enjoy
[54:06] the the the The Parables of Christ and
[54:09] and and lean into the things of God as
[54:11] it relates to Grace and salvation and
[54:14] healing and all the things that God
[54:15] would do with forgiveness of sins feed
[54:17] on the Milk of the word amen Paul said
[54:21] it this way in 1 Corinthians CH 13:1 and
[54:24] I think this just forms a beautiful
[54:26] image
[54:27] when I was a child I spake as a child I
[54:30] understood as a child I thought as a
[54:33] child as
[54:35] children we expect uh childlike behavior
[54:40] and you could go into a room and you
[54:42] could see a baby with a marker drawing
[54:45] all over the wall and you wouldn't agree
[54:48] with that behavior but you would almost
[54:50] expect it because that's what a baby
[54:52] would do but if you walked into the
[54:54] church this morning and I was over here
[54:56] with the giant crayon just working on
[54:59] the wall you be like that image is a
[55:01] little in congruent with how old that
[55:03] dude looks and it wouldn't be you
[55:05] wouldn't expect it and Paul's saying the
[55:07] same thing when I was a child I I spake
[55:10] as a child I understood as a child I
[55:12] thought as a child I acted like a child
[55:14] there was childish things I would do it
[55:16] would maybe be understandable if I got
[55:18] jealous because somebody else had a toy
[55:20] it was understandable if I had malice
[55:22] because I was a little jealous of the
[55:23] new sibling but he says when I became a
[55:26] man I put away childish
[55:30] things and so there is a mark of
[55:34] maturity that has more to do with what
[55:36] you put away instead of what age you are
[55:40] amen the season there's a season of life
[55:43] when there's certain things that are
[55:44] expected because of your age but then
[55:46] there comes a time when because of your
[55:48] age you should put things down and it's
[55:49] what you put down that is the mark of
[55:51] maturity I put away childish things I
[55:54] put away childish speaking and childish
[55:56] thinking and childish understanding and
[55:59] I and I grew to I I chose adulthood by
[56:03] the decisions that I made the things I
[56:05] sought out and the and the way that I
[56:07] chose to live my life and Paul is not
[56:10] just giv you the history of his life
[56:12] that when I was a kid I was a child and
[56:14] I did this and I did that and as I grew
[56:16] up I did more manly things he's relating
[56:18] it to us spiritually amen so in the next
[56:21] chapter in verse 20 he says Brethren be
[56:23] not children in understanding
[56:26] don't be simple and innocent and don't
[56:28] be wishy-washy and don't be ignorant uh
[56:31] and and don't be knowledgeable or don't
[56:34] lack knowledge and don't uh lack
[56:36] Proficiency in understanding he say says
[56:38] don't be children in understanding but
[56:40] in Malice be ye children in other words
[56:43] don't don't be easily don't understand
[56:45] malice don't be quick to malice don't he
[56:48] says be innocent of it be inexperienced
[56:50] in it but in understanding be menen so
[56:54] he's he's making this distinction that
[56:56] there's something to be expected about a
[56:57] child even sometimes children or maybe
[57:00] all the time they'll Express certain
[57:02] things and behaviors and there's no real
[57:04] guile behind it they're not really
[57:06] saying I hate you and they know what it
[57:07] means to hate and I hope I never see you
[57:10] again they they haven't really thought
[57:11] through this uh but they're just saying
[57:13] things maybe they've heard other people
[57:14] say and and they make comments and he's
[57:17] saying that don't be uh uh experienced
[57:21] in Malice so be a child when it comes to
[57:23] malice but when it comes to
[57:26] understanding be
[57:28] men TR be spiritually mature have a
[57:32] matured spiritual mind and not just in
[57:34] your thinking and your contemplations
[57:36] but in your
[57:38] acting and I believe the revelation of
[57:40] the word is Jesus said he Reveals His
[57:42] word unto babes it works to mature our
[57:45] thinking to mature our discernment and
[57:47] our processing and our perception to
[57:49] give us an understanding of the way
[57:51] things work I don't think there's a
[57:53] better book in the world to read to
[57:55] understand human behavior than the
[57:57] Bible and as we read the word and it's
[57:59] quickened to us it matures our thinking
[58:01] it corrects our uh inexperience it
[58:04] corrects our judgments and our and our
[58:06] wrong attitudes and therefore it helps
[58:08] us in our
[58:10] acting second Peter chapter 3:18 he says
[58:14] but grow in Grace and in the knowledge
[58:16] of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ this
[58:19] is the admonishment to those that are
[58:21] born again those that have tasted and
[58:25] seen that the Lord is good the ones that
[58:28] have found that the Lord is gracious
[58:31] Peter says grow in Grace amen there is a
[58:34] maturing there is an increasing in the
[58:36] knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[58:38] Christ so to newborn babes who desire
[58:40] the sincere milk of the word they're
[58:42] going to grow and they're going to put
[58:45] away childish things they're going to
[58:47] become more spiritually mature in their
[58:49] understanding and as they grow in Grace
[58:50] they're to grow in the knowledge of
[58:53] Jesus Christ this is the pattern
[58:56] that God has set forth for his babes
[58:59] it's not necessarily the burden in the
[59:01] pattern that a natural grandparent would
[59:03] have or even some parents would have for
[59:05] their own children where it's like I
[59:06] just wish they would stay this way
[59:08] forever that's not the way that God
[59:10] feels amen Galatians CH 4: 19 Paul says
[59:15] my little children of whom I travail in
[59:18] birth again so he kind of gives him the
[59:22] the heart of a father that you are i'
[59:25] I've brought you forth
[59:26] uh by the word of God and I'm your
[59:28] father in The Gospel he says my little
[59:29] children I'm travailing as a mother
[59:32] would when giving birth he says I
[59:33] travail again because they've already
[59:35] been born by the word of God but now I'm
[59:38] travailing and and I have this great
[59:39] sorrow as a parent that Christ would be
[59:43] formed in you amen you look in the
[59:46] scripture you'll remember I think we
[59:48] might read read it later on here in a
[59:49] little bit yeah we'll read it here in a
[59:51] little bit Lord will and he's dealing
[59:53] with the subject of adoption or maybe a
[59:55] better way of putting that is maturity
[59:58] he saying I'm laboring to see the
[1:00:00] fullness of Christ manifested in your
[1:00:03] person I'm not questioning your
[1:00:05] salvation I'm not questioning your
[1:00:06] experience but I'm questioning your
[1:00:08] ability to go forward I'm questioning
[1:00:10] whether or not you have a hunger to go
[1:00:12] forward he says having begun in the
[1:00:14] spirit are you now made perfect by the
[1:00:15] flesh he says who has hindered you from
[1:00:18] going further in the grace of God what's
[1:00:20] kept you back what's restrained you he
[1:00:22] said I'm travailing as a parent to see
[1:00:25] you not just be born again but to see
[1:00:28] Christ formed in you amen remember John
[1:00:31] wrote in third his third letter verse
[1:00:33] four I have no Greater Joy than to hear
[1:00:36] that my children Walk In Truth again
[1:00:40] there's this uh role of a parent John
[1:00:43] who had this burden for those that he
[1:00:46] had brought to Christ he wanted to see
[1:00:47] them he had no Greater Joy than to know
[1:00:49] that his children were walking in truth
[1:00:51] Paul says uh my little children I I'm
[1:00:55] travailing laboring to see Christ be
[1:00:57] formed in you they're showing this is
[1:01:00] the attitude of a parent and not just
[1:01:04] a not just a natural parent but the
[1:01:06] heart of God as a father amen I have no
[1:01:09] Greater Joy than to hear that my
[1:01:10] children walk in truth that word walk
[1:01:13] means to make progress in amen it's not
[1:01:17] just being close to it associated with
[1:01:19] it but there's no Greater Joy than to
[1:01:21] know that your children are making
[1:01:23] progress in the truth that they're
[1:01:25] increasing inreasing in understanding
[1:01:27] that in their increase of understanding
[1:01:29] and the knowledge of Jesus Christ their
[1:01:30] exercise of of discernment and wisdom
[1:01:33] demonstrates that they're they're
[1:01:35] catching a hold and God is quickening to
[1:01:37] them the principles of the word of God
[1:01:39] Amen to walk in the light and watch more
[1:01:44] unfold so Paul was not just happy to see
[1:01:47] them start in the faith but he wanted to
[1:01:49] see them finish amen he wanted to see
[1:01:52] them make progress my little children I
[1:01:54] I I know that begun but but I want to
[1:01:57] see you finish this
[1:01:59] race in Ephesians chapter 5:1 Paul said
[1:02:02] it this way be therefore followers of
[1:02:04] God as dear children what an amazing
[1:02:07] statement telling them the children uh
[1:02:10] the the believer the Born Again follow
[1:02:12] God as dear children why because God is
[1:02:15] your father and what do children do they
[1:02:17] emulate they
[1:02:19] impersonate as a matter of fact I
[1:02:21] challenge anybody with young kids the
[1:02:23] next time you go to correct your child
[1:02:25] just stop for moment look at them and
[1:02:26] wonder and see whether or not you see
[1:02:29] yourself well I think I taught my kid
[1:02:31] that I think they're doing that because
[1:02:33] I do that and there there's nothing like
[1:02:36] a a example and demonstration to teach
[1:02:39] more than just what you say and so it's
[1:02:41] in that principle says be ye therefore
[1:02:43] catch that phrase be ye therefore
[1:02:45] followers of God as dear children this
[1:02:47] is the relationship that Paul's wanting
[1:02:49] to establish that we may grow into the
[1:02:52] image of God grow into the image of
[1:02:54] Christ because Jesus said in Matthew
[1:02:56] 5:48 be ye therefore perfect and notice
[1:02:59] that symmetry Paul is saying the same
[1:03:01] thing be therefore followers of God and
[1:03:04] Jesus say be ye therefore perfect even
[1:03:06] as your father which is in heaven is
[1:03:08] perfect right and that word there means
[1:03:10] mature full grown nothing can be added
[1:03:13] to God to make them more God he is God
[1:03:15] he's the fullness of God the maturity of
[1:03:17] God the thinking of God and Jesus be
[1:03:19] therefore perfect and how do we get
[1:03:21] there be therefore followers of God as
[1:03:24] dear children
[1:03:26] Jesus even said that the the disciple
[1:03:28] the one that is taught shall become as
[1:03:30] the
[1:03:31] teacher and that that's the goal of a
[1:03:33] teacher is to not always demonstrate to
[1:03:36] his pupils how much more he knows than
[1:03:38] them but to bring them up to a place to
[1:03:40] where they are as
[1:03:42] him and this is the this is the
[1:03:44] relationship that God has to his
[1:03:47] children Ephesians chapter 4 we're going
[1:03:50] to go ahead and read all the way from
[1:03:51] verse 7 to verse 16 and let's just walk
[1:03:54] through this I know we read this in the
[1:03:56] beginning now let's just look at this
[1:03:57] nature of God to where he doesn't want
[1:04:00] us just to be children so I haven't left
[1:04:02] my thought that God is not a grandpa I
[1:04:04] made that point to say that God is not a
[1:04:06] grandpa grandpa because he do and he and
[1:04:09] he can't be nor does he want to have
[1:04:11] grandchildren and it's because God is
[1:04:13] different than man he is hyperfocused
[1:04:17] and intent on developing you to your
[1:04:20] fullness I love that not just saying
[1:04:22] well you know what I'm just going to let
[1:04:23] them choose what they want to be and
[1:04:25] what they want to identify as and where
[1:04:27] they want to go and what they want to do
[1:04:28] God knows who you are he knows what's in
[1:04:31] you he knows the gold in you he knows
[1:04:33] the gifts he knows the the the the the
[1:04:35] benefits that you can bring to other
[1:04:37] people and God is focused on giving you
[1:04:39] all the resources you need as a child of
[1:04:42] God to become what you're called to be
[1:04:46] and if we think well that's only in a
[1:04:47] spiritual sense no it's even in the
[1:04:49] natural God in the beginning busied
[1:04:52] himself over his children that's the
[1:04:54] relationship he established in the
[1:04:55] beginning Adam and the woman as the
[1:04:57] children of God and God gave them
[1:04:58] everything they needed uh watched out
[1:05:00] over them busied himself with his
[1:05:01] children because he wanted them to
[1:05:04] succeed and that is that is the attitude
[1:05:07] of God to equip us and to teach us and
[1:05:09] to give us all the things and the tools
[1:05:11] that we need naturally and spiritually
[1:05:13] to be everything that we can be
[1:05:15] spiritually and naturally amen if you're
[1:05:18] an architect he wants you to be the best
[1:05:19] architect you can be if you're a
[1:05:21] stay-at-home mom he wants to equip you
[1:05:23] and encourage you to be the best
[1:05:25] stay-at-home mom you can be whatever it
[1:05:27] is that you might be God is interested
[1:05:29] in developing you to your full
[1:05:31] potential Ephesians chapter 4 verse 7
[1:05:34] but unto every one of us is given Grace
[1:05:36] notice that statement every one of us
[1:05:38] has received a gift of Grace according
[1:05:41] to the measure of the gift of Christ so
[1:05:45] we have been given Grace and it's
[1:05:48] according to this measure of the gift of
[1:05:50] Christ so there's some measurement
[1:05:53] there's some uh I don't want to say
[1:05:55] necessar limit but some fullness some
[1:05:57] extent to which we've been given this
[1:05:59] grace and then in the next few verses he
[1:06:02] shows how that he ascended up on high
[1:06:05] and led the Captivity captive and this
[1:06:07] is the releasing from Paradise that we
[1:06:08] read back in the gospels and then he
[1:06:11] gave gifts unto men now he's going to
[1:06:13] pick that back up in verse 11 but then
[1:06:15] he kind of inserts this parenthetical
[1:06:17] phrase and I could say this is Paul
[1:06:19] teaching some really awesome principles
[1:06:22] in the resurrection he says he that
[1:06:23] ascended he's the same one that
[1:06:25] descended first into hell and then uh
[1:06:28] and emptied out paradise he descended
[1:06:30] into lower parts of the earth and this
[1:06:32] same one descend that descended has also
[1:06:35] ascended far above all heavens and there
[1:06:39] he says seated at the right hand of the
[1:06:41] father on high and no that he might fill
[1:06:45] all things and I believe that he gives
[1:06:47] us this explanation or this
[1:06:51] demonstration of the Resurrection The
[1:06:53] dissension and then the Ascension of
[1:06:55] Christ again uh so that we could
[1:06:58] understand this grace that has been
[1:06:59] given us in this measure of the gift of
[1:07:01] Christ and it is and and the giving of
[1:07:04] gifts to men so that he can fill this is
[1:07:07] the purpose he can fill all things right
[1:07:10] the ascended Christ is to fill all
[1:07:12] things and notice how it's done he gave
[1:07:15] some Apostles and some prophets and some
[1:07:18] evangelist and some pastors and teachers
[1:07:22] I think it's interesting that he joins
[1:07:23] those two together because I believe
[1:07:24] that a pastor should have the ability to
[1:07:26] teach and sometimes the worst messes
[1:07:28] that are made is when pastors can't
[1:07:30] teach amen thankfully your pastor's a
[1:07:33] teacher amen but he gave some these
[1:07:36] gifts and why did he why does he give
[1:07:39] these five-fold gifts so these
[1:07:41] Ministries why are they placed in the
[1:07:42] body and in the church it's for the full
[1:07:45] the process of the full measure
[1:07:47] manifesting itself he gave gifts Christ
[1:07:50] gave gifts and there's a measure of the
[1:07:52] gift of Christ and he ascends on high
[1:07:54] and he gives gifts so he might fill all
[1:07:56] things through these gifts so there's
[1:07:58] gifts in the body Amen in Colossians
[1:08:01] 1:18 and he is the head of the body the
[1:08:03] church who is the beginning the
[1:08:05] firstborn from the dead that in all
[1:08:07] things he might have the preeminence
[1:08:10] this is that he might fill all things
[1:08:12] the measure of the gift of Christ he
[1:08:14] doesn't just want to deliver you from
[1:08:16] smoking and deliver you from drinking
[1:08:18] and depression he wants to fill every
[1:08:20] fiber of his be your being he wants to
[1:08:22] fill every fiber of his church he wants
[1:08:25] to have
[1:08:27] preeminence Paul said as I am fully
[1:08:29] known and possessed by God I want to
[1:08:32] apprehend him fully and completely I
[1:08:34] press toward the mark of
[1:08:36] perfection Ephesians chapter 1: 22 and
[1:08:40] 23 and have put all things under his
[1:08:42] feet and gave him to be the head over
[1:08:45] all things to the church which is his
[1:08:48] body the fullness of him that filth all
[1:08:51] in all so where is the fullness of
[1:08:53] Christ that filth all in all his body so
[1:08:56] what does Christ want to have
[1:08:58] preeminence in his church preeminence in
[1:09:01] his body and it's not the Catholic
[1:09:02] church it's not the Presbyterian Church
[1:09:04] it is the individuals who have been born
[1:09:07] again by an experience with Christ on
[1:09:09] their own not by a church experience not
[1:09:11] by sprinkling not by just a confession
[1:09:14] but they have been born again by the
[1:09:15] spirit of God that one Spirit baptizes
[1:09:18] you into the body of Christ and how is
[1:09:21] he going to have prence by all us
[1:09:24] yielding the entire Body of Christ each
[1:09:26] one yielding so that he can have and
[1:09:29] occupy that full measure of the gift of
[1:09:31] Christ that's been given to each one of
[1:09:33] us he is the head of the body that he
[1:09:36] might have preeminence in all things
[1:09:40] that he might be the head over all
[1:09:41] things to the church the fullness of him
[1:09:43] that filth all in all so he's given the
[1:09:46] gifts of Apostles and Prophets and
[1:09:48] evangelists teachers and pastors to do
[1:09:51] this verse 12 Ephesians 4:12 he's given
[1:09:55] these gifts for the perfecting of the
[1:09:58] Saints the maturing of the Saints for
[1:10:01] the the granting and the giving and the
[1:10:03] providing of anything that would lack
[1:10:05] for the resourcing of the individuals so
[1:10:07] that they can mature for the work of the
[1:10:09] ministry for the edifying of the body of
[1:10:11] Christ what is it the building up the
[1:10:12] promotion of its strength till we all
[1:10:15] come in the unity of the faith and of
[1:10:18] the knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[1:10:20] perfect man so it's not just that we
[1:10:23] would all be United in faith that we
[1:10:25] would all have the same knowledge of the
[1:10:26] Son of God but that we would all mature
[1:10:29] unto a perfect man that means a full age
[1:10:31] fully grown mature it means we are to go
[1:10:36] from babe from from childhood or from a
[1:10:38] babe to
[1:10:39] Childhood adolescence to
[1:10:42] adulthood unto a perfect man unto the
[1:10:45] measure of the stature of the fullness
[1:10:47] of Christ verse seven he's given unto
[1:10:49] one each one of us given Grace according
[1:10:51] to the measure of the gift of Christ and
[1:10:54] so there's gifts to bring out the full
[1:10:56] measure of this grace that has been
[1:10:57] given to us that is the measure of the
[1:11:00] stature of the fullness of Christ the
[1:11:02] stature of a perfect
[1:11:04] man so just as Christ grew and increased
[1:11:08] in wisdom and knowledge and stature and
[1:11:10] in favor with God and man the Bible says
[1:11:13] by obedience uh he learned obedience by
[1:11:16] the things which he suffered in being
[1:11:17] made perfect so it was the process of
[1:11:21] the father speaking and Jesus said I say
[1:11:23] only that which the father has spoken I
[1:11:25] do only that which the father has shown
[1:11:26] me to do so Jesus was demonstrating the
[1:11:29] role as a son who did only what the
[1:11:31] father told him to do perfect obedience
[1:11:34] and he was uh acting on the request and
[1:11:38] the command of God and he learned
[1:11:41] obedience uh by the things which he
[1:11:43] suffered and was made perfect he grew to
[1:11:46] that stature through obedience amen he
[1:11:49] he learned obedience he did the father's
[1:11:51] will it was the dynamic of the father
[1:11:53] teaching him right amen and therefore we
[1:11:56] see in the scripture in Ephesians 4 that
[1:11:58] God's word is to edify the body it's
[1:12:01] given to us until it can mature into the
[1:12:03] fullness of Christ a perfect man a full
[1:12:06] age adulthood mature
[1:12:09] amen and brother bradam teaches he says
[1:12:12] you can't expect a baby to be born again
[1:12:14] it's got to grow to it and we grow in
[1:12:17] Christ to the full stature not somebody
[1:12:20] get converted tonight tomorrow go preach
[1:12:22] the gospel we grow up into manhood into
[1:12:24] the sture of Christ this is what happens
[1:12:27] and it it's not to say that uh when you
[1:12:30] when you're you get converted tonight
[1:12:31] and then tomorrow uh you you're not
[1:12:33] allowed to testify you're not out of
[1:12:34] witness or that one wouldn't preach the
[1:12:36] gospel but he's saying that it's not
[1:12:38] just that everything's finished and
[1:12:40] complete and you're completely placed in
[1:12:41] your gift you're converted on Tuesday
[1:12:43] night you're completely fully placed in
[1:12:45] your gift the next day he says no we
[1:12:47] grow as a babe in Christ into the
[1:12:50] stature of Christ we grow into manhood I
[1:12:54] I hope to be min Min in to some some
[1:12:56] Grace to all of us some mature different
[1:12:57] SP paces and if we're made perfect
[1:13:00] through our suffering some of us have to
[1:13:01] suffer a little bit more than others and
[1:13:03] and there's certainly a time span that
[1:13:05] this goes through so I'm I'm wanting to
[1:13:06] minister Grace to Believers seasoned
[1:13:08] Believers and maybe just the newborn
[1:13:10] again Believers and those who've had ups
[1:13:12] and downs and difficulties that when you
[1:13:14] were born again you weren't a fully
[1:13:16] mature son and daughter of God and that
[1:13:18] explains why we've made the mistakes we
[1:13:20] have and why we've grown cold and why
[1:13:22] we've got discouraged and why we've
[1:13:23] backslid at times it's it's because you
[1:13:25] weren't fully mature at that time but
[1:13:27] maybe what you didn't do is engage in
[1:13:30] the process of
[1:13:32] growth must grow into
[1:13:34] manhood what are all these things for
[1:13:36] what are these gifts for for the
[1:13:38] perfecting of the Saints the edifying of
[1:13:40] the body so that they can grow into a
[1:13:41] perfect man verse 14 this is the exact
[1:13:46] emphasis of Paul that we henceforth be
[1:13:47] no more
[1:13:48] children amen be you dear followers of
[1:13:51] go be you therefore followers of God as
[1:13:53] dear children but not that we would
[1:13:55] always be children not that we would
[1:13:57] always just
[1:13:58] be in babbling behind God but that we
[1:14:01] become more
[1:14:03] Godlike that we're not just children
[1:14:05] anymore tossed to and fro and carried
[1:14:08] about with every wind childhood is
[1:14:11] marked by ups and downs the learning of
[1:14:13] bad habits the unlearning of bad habits
[1:14:15] the promotion of good things encouraged
[1:14:17] in the right matters discouraged in the
[1:14:18] wrong matters childhood's marked of up
[1:14:20] and down tossed carried literally
[1:14:23] carried literally tossed into the air
[1:14:25] over and over again there it's all about
[1:14:27] finding purpose and who am I and and
[1:14:30] learning what acceptance is and learning
[1:14:32] to deal with other people and have the
[1:14:33] right attitude and this is a great
[1:14:35] responsibility and a role for a parent
[1:14:37] then to make sure that they the child I
[1:14:40] is properly taught that they not always
[1:14:43] be
[1:14:44] children they not always be given to the
[1:14:46] whims of the flesh I want to eat it's 2
[1:14:48] o'clock in the morning I know where the
[1:14:49] food is I'm going to go do it but
[1:14:51] they're taught no you got to discipline
[1:14:53] yourself you want to be restrained and
[1:14:55] you want to learn good
[1:14:56] habits and I know that maybe sometimes
[1:14:58] the joke is that and people even said
[1:15:01] this to me that they you know they were
[1:15:03] in their kitchen eating a gallon of ice
[1:15:05] cream with the spoon and like this is
[1:15:07] the Privileges of growing up moving out
[1:15:11] right like this is it's like all right
[1:15:14] keep that up the reward for that is
[1:15:16] diabetes right there's a reason why you
[1:15:19] don't just live that way and there's a
[1:15:20] reason why you just don't eat whatever
[1:15:21] you want to eat so there's a real wisdom
[1:15:23] in being disciplined nutritiously and
[1:15:26] and dietarily and and your sleep habits
[1:15:28] and getting up in the morning making
[1:15:29] your bed and and washing your car and
[1:15:32] looking out everything yes making your
[1:15:34] bed young man yes Glory it's it's like
[1:15:37] this you do this amen the young man's
[1:15:39] over there going no
[1:15:44] no sometimes when when little boys are
[1:15:47] like that they get married and their
[1:15:49] wife becomes their mom
[1:15:55] that we do not be children anymore
[1:15:57] carried about by every wind of doctr by
[1:15:58] the slide of men the cunning craftiness
[1:15:59] whereby they lie and wait to deceive but
[1:16:02] speaking the truth and I want you to
[1:16:03] catch this phrase in
[1:16:05] love this is the love of a
[1:16:07] parent this is the love of a father this
[1:16:11] is the love that you have for your
[1:16:12] children love is corrective love uh May
[1:16:16] hide a matter but for the sake of
[1:16:18] promoting good and for the sake of
[1:16:20] correcting and the sake of
[1:16:22] restoring speaking the truth in love May
[1:16:25] grow up into him in all things so this
[1:16:28] Dynamic of love to grow up into him what
[1:16:31] is it telling us is this process of
[1:16:33] being born again and growing in up which
[1:16:36] is the head
[1:16:37] Christ which is the head even Christ we
[1:16:39] saw that in Colossians we saw it already
[1:16:41] in the first chapter from whom the whole
[1:16:43] body fitly joined together and compacted
[1:16:45] by that which every joint supplieth
[1:16:47] according to the effectual working in
[1:16:48] the measure of every part maketh
[1:16:50] increase to the body under the edifying
[1:16:52] of itself in love
[1:16:56] speaking the truth in love we grow up
[1:16:59] and then as the
[1:17:00] body coalesces together and is
[1:17:02] instructed in this G this grace that has
[1:17:05] been given according to the measure of
[1:17:07] the gift of Christ in each one of us it
[1:17:09] makes increase of the body as you grow
[1:17:12] and mature it helps others that's it and
[1:17:15] it promotes this effective coalescing
[1:17:18] and unity of the body of Christ under
[1:17:20] the edifying of itself Amen in love amen
[1:17:25] amen
[1:17:27] childhood has certain characteristics
[1:17:29] and distinct patterns that Paul is
[1:17:31] talking about but this there's a gift in
[1:17:34] you there's a measure of Grace in you
[1:17:36] there's a potential inside of you so the
[1:17:38] word of God is to cultivate that and to
[1:17:40] grow it and to feed it and to nurture it
[1:17:42] so that you can grow up and be
[1:17:44] spiritually mature Christians he told
[1:17:46] Timothy to flee youthful lusts why why
[1:17:50] is it youthful lust it's it's desires
[1:17:51] and instincts and inclinations of a
[1:17:53] particular age that you would expect a
[1:17:56] one of a teenager maybe to act out a
[1:17:58] certain way and you might expect one of
[1:18:00] a certain age to be more prone to risk
[1:18:02] taking and doing certain things they say
[1:18:05] that uh at 12 years old a child's uh the
[1:18:09] pleasure center of a child's brain is
[1:18:11] fully mature in other words they are the
[1:18:15] the part of them that likes to have fun
[1:18:17] and experience things will cannot get
[1:18:19] any more robust it's it it's fullness at
[1:18:24] by 12
[1:18:25] but the the risk assessment part of the
[1:18:27] brain the the part that can reason and
[1:18:30] and engage consequence doesn't mature
[1:18:32] till
[1:18:34] 21 and so that's the one of the reasons
[1:18:36] why you see people acting the way that
[1:18:38] they do during those that stages is it's
[1:18:40] not because they're evil but it's just
[1:18:42] they got one side that's fully activated
[1:18:43] like yeah let's do let's jump off this
[1:18:47] Cliff right and there's not this other
[1:18:49] part of the brain that says well you
[1:18:51] weigh about 180 do we know how deep that
[1:18:54] is
[1:18:55] you know do we know how tall we are has
[1:18:57] anybody else done this before and so
[1:18:59] that part that's more has the ability to
[1:19:01] reason and to think about things and
[1:19:03] work through things hasn't fully
[1:19:04] developed and Paul is saying hey as
[1:19:05] children that there's a process there's
[1:19:08] youthful lust there's things you might
[1:19:09] be engaging he says but flee them but
[1:19:11] follow F youthful lust but follow
[1:19:14] righteousness Faith charity peace with
[1:19:15] them that call on the Lord out of a pure
[1:19:16] heart lay aside all this malice and all
[1:19:19] these things of the Flesh and desire the
[1:19:21] sincere milk of the word that you may
[1:19:22] grow
[1:19:23] thereby and the sermon you must be born
[1:19:26] again brother bam said there are no
[1:19:27] shortcuts amen they want to come right
[1:19:29] quick they don't want to grow we grow in
[1:19:33] the Lord it takes growth and
[1:19:36] experience there's there's this idea
[1:19:38] that people don't they don't want any
[1:19:39] shortcuts and you want to know what's a
[1:19:41] really good shortcut is just speak in
[1:19:42] tongues and you've got it yeah you're
[1:19:44] you're good you spoke in tongues you got
[1:19:46] it it's a
[1:19:47] shortcut because all you got to do is
[1:19:49] just say something somebody can
[1:19:50] understand they say you got the Holy
[1:19:51] Ghost right there's no shortcuts they
[1:19:54] want to grow we grow in Lord it takes
[1:19:56] growth and experience tonight you're a
[1:19:57] sinner tomorrow you're a manifested Son
[1:19:59] of God he says nonsense where do you get
[1:20:02] that in the word babies are not born men
[1:20:05] right not born mature they're not born
[1:20:07] fully grown he says they're born babies
[1:20:09] and grow to men babies are not grown
[1:20:12] ladies but they're nurtured to ladyhood
[1:20:15] men uh boys are not uh born spiritually
[1:20:18] into adulthood and manhood but they're
[1:20:20] nurtured into it the same way that our
[1:20:22] children are amen but speaking the truth
[1:20:26] in love to the edifying of itself in
[1:20:28] love were to grow up from babes to
[1:20:30] adulthood to maturity right now this
[1:20:34] maturity as I mentioned before when Paul
[1:20:35] said my little children I travail in
[1:20:37] birth until Christ be formed in you he
[1:20:39] was dealing with the subject of adoption
[1:20:41] or we could say coming to maturity
[1:20:43] that's what adoption is connected with
[1:20:46] are we doing good on time all right okay
[1:20:48] good I'm just going to look at you when
[1:20:49] I asked that question you're the pastor
[1:20:50] if everybody else said no it doesn't
[1:20:51] matter you're the pastor okay good I
[1:20:54] just need to know what time our
[1:20:55] reservations are but Ephesians chapter
[1:20:57] 1: 3-6 blessed be the God and father of
[1:21:00] our Lord Jesus Christ who had blessed us
[1:21:02] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[1:21:04] places in Christ where we're already
[1:21:06] seated according to he has chosen Us in
[1:21:09] him before the foundation of the world
[1:21:10] that we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:21:13] before him in love amen but this phrase
[1:21:17] in some translation says that we should
[1:21:19] be holy and Without Blame before him and
[1:21:22] the in love is in verse 5 in love of
[1:21:25] having predestinated us unto the
[1:21:26] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[1:21:29] himself according to the good pleasure
[1:21:31] of his will to the praise of the glory
[1:21:33] of his grace where he ha made us
[1:21:34] accepted in the
[1:21:36] Beloved he has said something quite
[1:21:39] remarkable here he's writing to the
[1:21:41] Believers he's writing to those who've
[1:21:42] already been baptized by the spirit into
[1:21:44] the body of Christ he's writing to the
[1:21:46] Saints and who have been elected and by
[1:21:49] election there's a seed of God inside of
[1:21:52] you that brings you to a birth brings
[1:21:54] you to a uh uh to be a babe in Christ
[1:21:57] but the love of God does not want you to
[1:21:59] remain wrapped in swaddling clothes
[1:22:01] lying in a Manger the love of God does
[1:22:03] not want you to remain a baby completely
[1:22:06] entirely devoid of speech and
[1:22:10] understanding but in love in love he's
[1:22:14] predestinated you unto the adoption of
[1:22:16] children by Jesus Christ think of what
[1:22:19] that in love that adoption
[1:22:22] means amen
[1:22:26] thank you
[1:22:28] Lord I'm just getting a little weird
[1:22:31] weird mechanical sound there so just
[1:22:33] want to be sure it's not on my end but
[1:22:35] in love he's predestinated us election
[1:22:37] is speaks of your birth by for knowledge
[1:22:39] God ordained you to a birth the the
[1:22:41] elect can be quickened because there's a
[1:22:43] seed Gene inside born by The
[1:22:44] Incorruptible seed of the word of God
[1:22:46] but predestination isn't focused on the
[1:22:48] birth it's focused on the growth Amen in
[1:22:51] love the love of a father he is focused
[1:22:54] on
[1:22:55] Us by the the adoption of children or
[1:22:57] the maturing and the growth of children
[1:23:00] by Jesus Christ the word Christ didn't
[1:23:03] die on the cross that he could just have
[1:23:04] a daycare right he didn't die on the
[1:23:07] cross we just have a nursery full of
[1:23:08] babes and and and and in and Cribs but
[1:23:12] it's by Jesus Christ we are predestined
[1:23:14] unto adoption praise God and now when I
[1:23:18] say adoption I know that for uh a lot of
[1:23:20] people maybe we're only thinking in the
[1:23:22] human terms or more the modern invention
[1:23:24] of adoption but scripturally there is a
[1:23:27] law of adoption and there's an adoption
[1:23:30] in certain Antiquities or certain
[1:23:32] cultures uh in ancient times where the
[1:23:35] law of adoption is not as we would know
[1:23:37] it today where uh a two uh two parents
[1:23:41] would choose I keep saying a parent and
[1:23:43] it reminds me of do do we know when a
[1:23:45] joke becomes a dad
[1:23:47] joke when it becomes a
[1:23:52] parent you're a dad you shouldn't be
[1:23:54] shaking in your head you should be
[1:23:55] saying I want to write that down I'm
[1:23:56] going to use it within the next 12 hours
[1:23:58] I'm going to use
[1:24:00] it but this law of adoption isn't the
[1:24:02] process of taking a child that is not
[1:24:04] your own that you haven't birthed that
[1:24:06] has no relation to you which is how we
[1:24:08] understand adoption to work today you go
[1:24:10] through an adoption agency they find a
[1:24:12] child who needs adoption and you maybe
[1:24:14] give certain parameters or things that
[1:24:16] you want and it makes this connection of
[1:24:18] someone prior have you have not
[1:24:20] previously known have no relationship to
[1:24:23] now there can be a formal legal process
[1:24:24] where you take someone you're related to
[1:24:26] or someone that you have some close
[1:24:27] close connection to but you do not
[1:24:29] formally adopt a child that you have
[1:24:32] been given birth to or that you are
[1:24:33] legally and DNA actually related to as a
[1:24:37] parent so this law of adoption scripture
[1:24:40] is the process of raising a son which is
[1:24:42] your own into the image and the
[1:24:45] character nature of the father amen has
[1:24:48] it it's most understood in that uh in
[1:24:52] certain cultures and certain uh areas
[1:24:55] you would have a family business or
[1:24:57] you'd own a a kingdom you'd have a a
[1:24:59] business some land or farming and the
[1:25:02] even scripturally a son is in the Bible
[1:25:05] the word the Hebrew word for son is the
[1:25:06] builder of the family name so the father
[1:25:09] when he had a son he's building he's
[1:25:12] building the family name he's building
[1:25:13] the reputation of the family he's
[1:25:16] raising someone who's going to inherit
[1:25:17] his legacy and take over what he leaves
[1:25:20] to him and the Old Testament is just
[1:25:21] full of the law of inheritance and how
[1:25:23] land and things are passed down from
[1:25:25] generation to generation it's all based
[1:25:27] upon the sons that are born that bear
[1:25:29] the family name that are Builders of the
[1:25:31] family name so the goal was to raise a
[1:25:33] son who could be mature enough to take
[1:25:35] over and who could carry on the Legacy
[1:25:39] the right way so the goal of adoption or
[1:25:41] the idea of adoption is that a son's
[1:25:43] born into a family and he's taught he's
[1:25:44] encouraged he's resourced he's equipped
[1:25:47] and he's watched out over to see that he
[1:25:49] comes into the image of the father and
[1:25:51] has the same character the father so the
[1:25:53] father one day say son it's yours you
[1:25:55] run the business your name on the check
[1:25:57] is as good as mine maybe there's a time
[1:25:59] when the son would go into the fields
[1:26:01] and go to the shop and go different
[1:26:02] places says well my dad said or the boss
[1:26:05] said he said to do it this way but then
[1:26:06] there and he gives a check to the dad
[1:26:08] for him to sign but then there comes a
[1:26:10] time when he's adopted and the father
[1:26:12] says you have authority to sign the
[1:26:14] checks you don't have to say my dad said
[1:26:17] you can just tell the people what to do
[1:26:19] because you are a chip off the old block
[1:26:22] to do things the right way and I give
[1:26:23] you full Authority full power not just
[1:26:27] uh not just Power Authority but full
[1:26:30] power oh God is not a man we keep
[1:26:32] emphasizing that or hope you haven't
[1:26:33] forgotten that he doesn't adopt a child
[1:26:36] that's not his child
[1:26:37] already process of adoption be
[1:26:39] predestined the adoption of children is
[1:26:41] about maturity not
[1:26:43] relationship you're not adopted when
[1:26:45] you're born again you're you be by born
[1:26:48] again you you become a Son of God in
[1:26:50] that you manifest your sunship you
[1:26:52] manifest the fact that you were elected
[1:26:55] and because you are Sons he sends forth
[1:26:57] his spirit because you are elected to
[1:26:59] this birth he sends forth his Spirit by
[1:27:01] one Spirit you're baptized in the body
[1:27:03] of Christ you come forth as a babe in
[1:27:05] Christ that's not your adoption that's
[1:27:07] your birth because a scriptural adoption
[1:27:09] is not about relationship but about
[1:27:11] increasing to
[1:27:14] adulthood brother Brandon preached to
[1:27:16] siries on adoption and he said when the
[1:27:18] father in the Old Testament understood
[1:27:19] that his son was come of age and had
[1:27:22] been seasoned out to adoption come of
[1:27:26] age it's not just a when you turn 30
[1:27:29] you're going to be given it but have you
[1:27:31] matured do you have the mindset do you
[1:27:33] have the instincts do you have the
[1:27:34] Discipline Do you have the testimony he
[1:27:36] said they're born a child but they're a
[1:27:37] son they're a son right then but they'll
[1:27:40] never be no more than just a child or an
[1:27:42] ordinary son until they mature and show
[1:27:44] what they
[1:27:45] are and maturity is at the heart of this
[1:27:48] concept of adoption in the scripture on
[1:27:50] a certain day when this child had become
[1:27:52] matured or when the tutor would come
[1:27:53] back and say oh well he's well
[1:27:56] matured the son had to become tutored
[1:27:58] and trained and brought up getting more
[1:28:00] matured is is this teaching on adoption
[1:28:02] it has to do with maturity Galatians 4:
[1:28:06] 1:5 Paul says now I say that the heir as
[1:28:09] long as he is a child differ nothing
[1:28:11] from a servant though he be Lord of all
[1:28:14] so an heir as long as he is a child as
[1:28:16] long as he's immature as long as he's
[1:28:17] unlearned as long as he's unskilled he
[1:28:20] has has no difference than a servant he
[1:28:23] may be in entitled to be the heir but as
[1:28:26] long as he's immature he's no different
[1:28:27] than the servant he has to do what the
[1:28:29] father tells him to do sometimes they
[1:28:31] would work alongside the servants they
[1:28:33] would be tasked to do the same things
[1:28:35] and so he's learning he's learning
[1:28:36] processes he's learning to obey
[1:28:38] Authority he's learning to appreciate
[1:28:40] all aspects of the family and the family
[1:28:42] name and the family business so even
[1:28:44] though he may be the heir to ultimately
[1:28:46] be the one in full power and control he
[1:28:48] has no more Authority and position than
[1:28:51] a servant if he's still immature
[1:28:55] so verse two he's put under tutors and
[1:28:56] governors he's instructed he's taught
[1:28:58] he's trained until the time appointed of
[1:29:00] the
[1:29:01] father even so we when we were children
[1:29:04] and now he's relating specifically to
[1:29:06] the Jews were in bondage under the
[1:29:08] elements of the world but when the
[1:29:10] fullness of the time was
[1:29:12] come and I don't mean to get lost in
[1:29:14] this but the fullness of time that he's
[1:29:16] referring to is this end of a
[1:29:18] dispensation the end of the Jewish
[1:29:20] Church ages the end of the Jewish Church
[1:29:22] State and the Jewish Church law it was
[1:29:25] the end of their uh uh looking forward
[1:29:27] to the Messiah because in Romans 10:4 it
[1:29:29] says Christ is the end of the law so he
[1:29:32] was the end of that of the all things
[1:29:34] that relate to the aim and the purpose
[1:29:36] of the law he's the Fulfillment of it so
[1:29:38] he's talking about the Jews the Seed of
[1:29:41] Abraham who have now received their
[1:29:44] Messiah so when it came time for the
[1:29:46] Jews adoption those who had long been
[1:29:48] circumcised long believed the word of
[1:29:51] God and been faithful God sent forth his
[1:29:53] son made of a woman made under the law
[1:29:56] to redeem them that were under the law
[1:29:57] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:30:00] sons it was a fullness of time a time
[1:30:03] appointed by God he was to bring them
[1:30:07] Christ the Messiah comes to bring them
[1:30:09] to their dis their adoption at the end
[1:30:12] of their dispensation came into his own
[1:30:14] they looked to him they believed in him
[1:30:17] they had longed for him to come he comes
[1:30:19] and most if not almost all of them
[1:30:21] reject him and so they didn't go to to
[1:30:24] the upper room to receive the outpouring
[1:30:26] of the Holy Spirit to be baptized into
[1:30:27] the body of Christ which was the climax
[1:30:30] and the Pinnacle of those Jewish ages in
[1:30:32] the Old
[1:30:34] Testament and we don't have the time to
[1:30:36] get into it but we could see that the
[1:30:38] same pattern repeats itself in the
[1:30:40] Gentile dispensation the Gentiles are
[1:30:42] brought in by the baptism of the Holy
[1:30:44] Ghost they're born into the body of
[1:30:45] Christ they're babes in Christ they
[1:30:47] desire the sincere milk of the word God
[1:30:49] gives them gifts in the body to train
[1:30:51] them to bring them up to what Paul says
[1:30:54] option of children by Jesus Christ the
[1:30:57] word is given is the truth is spoken in
[1:30:59] love to mature us the truth is spoken in
[1:31:02] love to that we may grow up that we
[1:31:04] might be edify edify ourselves in love
[1:31:07] why because in love we've been
[1:31:09] predestined unto adoption that's the
[1:31:11] goal of
[1:31:12] love that that's the goal of a fatherly
[1:31:15] love the the fatherly love is and that's
[1:31:18] where love is so
[1:31:19] misunderstood there there's a parental
[1:31:21] love where you never want your children
[1:31:22] to suffer and what happens they never
[1:31:25] learn to persevere they never learn grit
[1:31:26] they never learn uh deter to be persever
[1:31:29] and determination because everything's
[1:31:30] just so easily provide you never want
[1:31:32] them to hurt you never want them to lose
[1:31:33] you never want them to experience
[1:31:34] sadness and so there's a way that
[1:31:37] sometimes there's a perversion of
[1:31:38] Parental love they withhold instruction
[1:31:40] they just want them to be themselves and
[1:31:42] that is a perverted love which is the
[1:31:43] worst thing for a
[1:31:47] child but the love of God is I want you
[1:31:50] to mature I want you to
[1:31:52] grow in and integrity and honesty and
[1:31:56] decency this isn't Dogma this isn't
[1:31:59] religion this is this is growing into
[1:32:01] the the heart of Christ where you know
[1:32:03] how to love others that are different
[1:32:04] than you you know how to have grace and
[1:32:06] patience for people and you can really
[1:32:08] be the heartbeat and the pulse of God
[1:32:11] that's what he
[1:32:12] desires so the Holy Ghost is in the
[1:32:15] church there's gifts in the church to
[1:32:18] teach to train to discipline and to grow
[1:32:21] the church
[1:32:24] those gifts are the voice of God giving
[1:32:26] Commandments the word is the voice of
[1:32:28] God giving Commandments teaching us
[1:32:30] instructing us what the word says what
[1:32:32] God's will is and we're to heed that
[1:32:35] voice amen so I want to ask the
[1:32:40] question and I I hope I'd like to finish
[1:32:43] I would like to finish this and I know
[1:32:45] an hour is a lengthy sermon already and
[1:32:47] we're we're pretty close to that but
[1:32:50] what happens if a child doesn't heed the
[1:32:52] voice of the parents
[1:32:54] what happens when we as babes in Christ
[1:32:56] aren't heeding and listening to the
[1:32:58] voice of God in 1st Samuel 15: 19 to 23
[1:33:03] start with verse 19 he says why didn't
[1:33:05] you obey the voice of the Lord here in
[1:33:08] chapter 15 Samuel had given the
[1:33:10] Commandment by the by the Lord to Saul
[1:33:12] kill all the amalekites leave nothing
[1:33:14] living man woman beast you name it let
[1:33:16] kill them all that's kind of harsh and
[1:33:18] maybe Saul uh wrestled with that but he
[1:33:20] was told to kill everything let nothing
[1:33:22] survive but Saul let
[1:33:24] he says in his own words the choice
[1:33:26] things the good things that could be
[1:33:27] offered a sacrifice we kept those and we
[1:33:30] killed anything perverse and not allowed
[1:33:32] by the law and he says and we offered
[1:33:35] sacrifice and offered worship and Paul
[1:33:37] says and and and he says it here I have
[1:33:40] obeyed the voice of the Lord fully I've
[1:33:42] obeyed you fully and Samuel's like then
[1:33:44] why do I hear
[1:33:46] sheep why do I hear the the voice of the
[1:33:48] the the livestock of the amalekites he
[1:33:50] said I've I've kept King AAG he says how
[1:33:53] could have you kept King and fully
[1:33:54] obeyed why did you not obey the voice of
[1:33:57] the Lord but did us fly upon the spoil
[1:33:59] and did evil in the sight of the Lord
[1:34:00] now that's what a child would do right
[1:34:03] whatever you do don't eat the cookies
[1:34:04] don't do it you're not supposed to eat
[1:34:06] it only do this only do that only
[1:34:08] halfway like give a kid a an iPad and
[1:34:11] say 15 minutes and when you're done you
[1:34:12] put it up now don't follow
[1:34:14] up right 15 minutes don't put any
[1:34:17] restrictions on it 15 minutes when the
[1:34:19] 15 minutes is up put it down two hours
[1:34:22] later
[1:34:24] and you're like has it been 15 minutes I
[1:34:27] don't know has it
[1:34:30] right and even if you set a timer they
[1:34:32] have this moment where they got to make
[1:34:34] this decision is anybody watching is
[1:34:37] anybody what's am I going to get caught
[1:34:39] is it it's it's in the nature of a child
[1:34:41] to push the
[1:34:42] limits to to find out what the barriers
[1:34:45] are and what the real boundaries
[1:34:47] are and he flew upon the spoil and did
[1:34:50] Evil Bible says woe unto you when your
[1:34:53] princes are
[1:34:55] children and here's a king who is a
[1:34:57] child and Saul said to S yay I I have
[1:35:00] obeyed the voice of the Lord and have
[1:35:01] gone the way which the Lord sent me and
[1:35:04] I brought AAG the came am he didn't even
[1:35:06] realize the inherent
[1:35:08] contradiction right he has sitting there
[1:35:10] and he's got brownie all over his face
[1:35:12] and Sam says did you eat the brownie
[1:35:13] he's like no didn't eat the brownie uhuh
[1:35:17] he I remember when I told the kids that
[1:35:19] we've got security cameras in our house
[1:35:21] and it's at that moment they realize
[1:35:22] what we never knew we didn't have
[1:35:24] Cameron but then you know stories start
[1:35:27] changing well in that case I am the one
[1:35:30] who stole the cookie from the cookie
[1:35:33] jar and so Saul is so lack so
[1:35:36] self-awareness I've obeyed and brought
[1:35:39] the king and have utterly destroyed
[1:35:41] which should have been utterly
[1:35:43] destroyed and and but the
[1:35:47] people took the Sheep the spoil of sheep
[1:35:50] and oxen the chief things which should
[1:35:51] which should have been utterly destroyed
[1:35:53] to sacrif I unto the Lord thy God in
[1:35:55] gilgal and then just how mature was this
[1:35:56] for him to blame everybody
[1:35:58] else and Samuel said hath the Lord as
[1:36:00] great Delight in burnt offerings I want
[1:36:02] you catch this and great offerings burnt
[1:36:04] offerings and sacrifice as in obeying
[1:36:06] the voice of the Lord behold to obey is
[1:36:09] better than sacrifice and to hearken
[1:36:12] than the fat of Rams for Rebellion is
[1:36:15] the sin of
[1:36:16] Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:36:18] iniquity and
[1:36:20] idolatry what a rebellion and
[1:36:22] stubbornness a mark of an unruly child a
[1:36:25] disobedient child scripturally Saul is
[1:36:28] Promised Paradise we know that when he
[1:36:32] seeks the prophet Samuel Samuel says
[1:36:34] you'll be with me in paradise and so
[1:36:36] it's not his salvation is in question
[1:36:38] but he lost the throne because of
[1:36:42] Disobedience and in the principle of
[1:36:44] adoption a son was always an ad ad a son
[1:36:47] but if the child was not obedient when
[1:36:49] it came to that age of maturity in the
[1:36:51] time that he ought to have matured then
[1:36:53] he was always a son but brother B said
[1:36:54] it loses something and Saul was always a
[1:36:58] son but he lost the throne and he lost
[1:37:01] the throne for his own son Jonathan he
[1:37:04] lost his
[1:37:05] inheritance and this is the process I
[1:37:08] want you to think of this rebellion and
[1:37:09] the stubbornness that was manifested in
[1:37:13] Saul these are marks of one who's never
[1:37:16] grown up remember when Saul was made
[1:37:18] King God had to give him another heart
[1:37:21] why because he wasn't
[1:37:22] mature well when the prophet said is not
[1:37:24] the whole desire of Israel upon you he
[1:37:27] goes what I'm from the smallest tribe
[1:37:29] and from the least of the families in
[1:37:30] the tribes he was immature he was
[1:37:33] insecure he was going to be anointed
[1:37:35] king they had to go find him God said he
[1:37:37] hideth among his
[1:37:38] stuff and he was he was afraid that to
[1:37:41] be rejected by the people he couldn't
[1:37:42] trust in God he wasn't willing to take
[1:37:44] that
[1:37:45] risk and be rejected by the people
[1:37:47] publicly Saul never matured his heart
[1:37:50] couldn't change like David's could and
[1:37:53] so we lost
[1:37:54] something in the law of inheritance in
[1:37:56] Deuteronomy chapter 21 I just want to
[1:37:58] read this quick and then we're going to
[1:37:59] be few more scriptures just to get
[1:38:01] through he said then it shall be when he
[1:38:04] maketh his sons to inherit he talk about
[1:38:05] a man who uh has two wives and different
[1:38:09] Sons by those wives if he maketh his son
[1:38:10] to inherit that which he hath that he
[1:38:12] may not make the son of the Beloved
[1:38:14] firstborn before the son of the hated
[1:38:17] which is indeed the firstborn in
[1:38:19] confusing language but if a man has put
[1:38:22] away his wife and hated her and he has a
[1:38:24] son who is indeed the firstborn but then
[1:38:27] has a son by another woman I'm not
[1:38:28] getting into the legalities of that and
[1:38:30] and how that would take place but it's
[1:38:32] just acknowledging the mess of humanity
[1:38:34] and how things like that happen he said
[1:38:35] there's one who is indeed the firstborn
[1:38:37] to whom the right of inheritance belongs
[1:38:39] but if he loves someone El that loves
[1:38:41] this woman better so he wants to favor
[1:38:44] that son there's a rule for this because
[1:38:47] there is indeed a firstborn he says but
[1:38:49] he shall acknowledge the son of the
[1:38:51] hated for the firstborn by giving giving
[1:38:53] him a double portion of all that he hath
[1:38:56] for he is the beginning of his strength
[1:38:58] and the right of the firstborn is his
[1:39:01] now I've studied on this subject for
[1:39:03] years and years and years and
[1:39:05] years and I
[1:39:07] have I I don't I don't well I I won't
[1:39:10] even say it but I'll just say this this
[1:39:13] is the law of adoption in the Old
[1:39:15] Testament give the firstborn a double
[1:39:18] portion now notice what it says
[1:39:20] immediately though after this if a man
[1:39:22] have a stubborn and your son which will
[1:39:25] not obey the voice of his father or the
[1:39:26] voice of his mother and that when they
[1:39:29] have chastened him will not hearken unto
[1:39:31] him now this is under the law and this
[1:39:33] is the harshness of the law thank God
[1:39:35] we're not under the law under the law if
[1:39:38] you didn't tithe you were
[1:39:40] cursed under law if you didn't give your
[1:39:43] offerings and your tithings you were
[1:39:44] cursed by God under the New Testament
[1:39:46] the grace of God you're not cursed if
[1:39:48] you don't you're just not blessed if you
[1:39:49] don't that's the beauty of the Covenant
[1:39:52] the beauty of the New Covenant the
[1:39:53] beauty of the grace of God it's not that
[1:39:54] you're threatened to be cursed if you
[1:39:56] don't pay your tithes and give your
[1:39:57] offerings it's just you're if you're not
[1:39:59] doing those things which God ask of you
[1:40:01] you're just not going to be
[1:40:03] blessed and so notice the stubbornness
[1:40:05] and rebellion of a son is exactly what
[1:40:08] Samuel calls out Rebellion is the sin of
[1:40:10] Witchcraft and stubbornness is as
[1:40:12] iniquity and idolatry and so a son who
[1:40:15] is stubborn and rebellious is one who
[1:40:17] has is has been deluded and has been
[1:40:21] deceived has been Bewitched
[1:40:23] one who is given to idolatry and
[1:40:25] iniquity rebellion and stubbornness
[1:40:27] these marks of a child who does not
[1:40:29] listen to his father and mother and
[1:40:31] cannot be corrected now this is again
[1:40:34] the the penalty of the law then shall
[1:40:35] his father and his mother lay hold to
[1:40:37] him on him bring him out under the
[1:40:39] Elders of the city and under the Gate of
[1:40:40] his place notice how different this is
[1:40:43] from the ceremony of adoption where the
[1:40:46] son who was obedient would be brought
[1:40:47] before the people and it would be
[1:40:49] acknowledged this son this day this is
[1:40:51] my beloved Son hear ye him
[1:40:53] he speaks for me he has all right and
[1:40:56] Authority he has my seal he has his own
[1:40:59] seal it is his own name he speaks for
[1:41:01] himself and there's a ceremony of
[1:41:03] adoption now it's the reverse before the
[1:41:05] Elders of the city they say this our son
[1:41:07] is stubborn and rebellious he will not
[1:41:09] obey our voice he is a glutton and a
[1:41:12] drunkard eating ice cream at 2 o'clock
[1:41:14] in the morning and all the men of the
[1:41:17] city doesn't make his bed and all the
[1:41:20] men of the city shall Stone him with
[1:41:22] stones that he died
[1:41:23] so shalt thou put evil away from among
[1:41:26] you and all Israel shall hear and
[1:41:29] fear there's your law what happens when
[1:41:32] a child doesn't listen to the voice of
[1:41:36] God what happens to a child of God when
[1:41:39] he isn't maturing and growing in the
[1:41:41] Lord God's not going to take you out and
[1:41:43] stone you he's not going to publicly
[1:41:44] castigate you for being a glutton and a
[1:41:48] drunkard but what happens God is not man
[1:41:52] who loves you at that baby stage just
[1:41:54] speaking in tongues and crying and
[1:41:56] shouting and dancing he do he doesn't
[1:41:59] he's not a man that wants you to always
[1:42:00] stay that way he wants you to mature
[1:42:03] because God is not a
[1:42:06] grandpa he is he is tased with seeing
[1:42:10] that you fully develop he's not
[1:42:12] sufficiently removed from the
[1:42:14] responsibilities of discipline and
[1:42:15] instruction and encouraging growth where
[1:42:17] he can just enjoy you in your
[1:42:19] Frolic he wants you to grow in 1
[1:42:22] Corinthians chap 3: 1:3 Brethren I speak
[1:42:25] I could not speak unto you as unto
[1:42:27] spiritual but as unto carnal even as
[1:42:29] unto babes in Christ this is what
[1:42:31] happens when you don't grow you don't
[1:42:33] listen you start making mistakes God
[1:42:34] corrects you you're babes in Christ I
[1:42:36] can't speak to a spiritual man and
[1:42:38] mature but I I speak to as babes he's
[1:42:41] not taking away their experience he's
[1:42:42] not taking away their Christianity he's
[1:42:44] not taking away their birth he's saiding
[1:42:45] you just haven't become more spiritual
[1:42:46] you haven't grown so I fed you with milk
[1:42:49] and not with meat I'd like to give you
[1:42:52] meat but you haven't developed a
[1:42:54] spiritual appetite for it you don't have
[1:42:55] the spiritual teeth you don't have the
[1:42:57] spiritual wisdom to just not throw a
[1:42:59] chunk of steak in your mouth and try to
[1:43:00] swallow
[1:43:01] it says I got to feed you with milk I
[1:43:04] got to see you make baby steps and grow
[1:43:06] and increase and learn so I speak you as
[1:43:09] babes and I feed you milk not meat
[1:43:11] hither to you were not able to Bear it
[1:43:12] neither now are you able he wants to
[1:43:15] give them meat but they hadn't matured
[1:43:16] enough says you're yet carnal for
[1:43:19] whereas there is among you envy and
[1:43:20] strife and divisions are you not carnal
[1:43:22] and walk as men there's your
[1:43:25] childishness there's your pettiness
[1:43:27] there's your jealousies there's your
[1:43:29] divisions we're not going to play with
[1:43:31] you we're going to take our ball and go
[1:43:32] home it's childish
[1:43:35] foolish I I spoke at a Men's Conference
[1:43:38] one time and it was a maybe around a
[1:43:40] hundred men gathered and I spoke the
[1:43:41] very opening session of the conference
[1:43:44] and I opened it by doing a demonstration
[1:43:46] and I had a ball with me and I found the
[1:43:48] two strongest men the youngest and
[1:43:50] strongest men in the whole conference to
[1:43:53] to come up at the front and I took a
[1:43:55] ball and I handed it to one young man
[1:43:58] and I told the other young man I said
[1:43:59] now get this ball from him they started
[1:44:04] wrestling up at the front of the
[1:44:06] conference this is how we open the
[1:44:07] conference
[1:44:08] fight fight and the guy finally kept it
[1:44:10] he St back and I said now I want to show
[1:44:14] you how to get the ball from him and
[1:44:16] this guy's like bring it he's like you
[1:44:19] think you can get this from me I said
[1:44:21] may I please have the ball and he goes
[1:44:24] goes I said there's your difference
[1:44:27] right there's your difference in Youth
[1:44:29] and enthusiasm and strength and you're
[1:44:31] going to do it your own and and a man
[1:44:33] self- serving right but and a man who
[1:44:35] just says may I please have it it's like
[1:44:37] oh you can have it that's how adults do
[1:44:40] things that's how mature people resolve
[1:44:42] things that's that's how you should go
[1:44:44] about something you don't use power and
[1:44:45] privilege and opportunity you use the
[1:44:47] word you use respect and dignity he says
[1:44:51] you guys are carnal envy and strife and
[1:44:53] divisions you're calling you walk as men
[1:44:55] you say oh men no
[1:44:58] children in Hebrews 5 he says it this
[1:45:00] way verses 10 to 14 he speaks of mzc
[1:45:03] he's called of God a high priest after
[1:45:04] the order of mzc Jesus Christ after this
[1:45:07] order of MZ and he says of whom we have
[1:45:09] many things to say and hard to be
[1:45:10] uttered in other words I'd love to teach
[1:45:12] who is this mezic I would love to break
[1:45:14] it down I'd love to say more but you're
[1:45:16] a doll of hearing I can't teach you the
[1:45:18] weigher matters of the law I can't teach
[1:45:20] you the meteor things in the word of God
[1:45:23] because you're dull of hearing he says
[1:45:24] for when you should be
[1:45:25] teachers you should have grown you
[1:45:27] should have matured you should have been
[1:45:28] so learned in the word of God that you
[1:45:30] could be the one teaching he says you've
[1:45:32] become children again and you need to be
[1:45:35] taught the first
[1:45:36] principles and you become such as have
[1:45:38] need of milk and not of strong meat
[1:45:39] you're still spiritually immature and
[1:45:41] you need milk to grow and you haven't
[1:45:43] matured to a place where I can give you
[1:45:45] meat and what is it the scripture saying
[1:45:47] that when you haven't matured God
[1:45:48] doesn't give up on you he corrects you
[1:45:51] and says you need to grow you need to
[1:45:53] grow up in the message you need to grow
[1:45:54] up in the word you can't always be aeed
[1:45:56] you can't always be prone to the same
[1:45:58] mistakes you can't always carry the same
[1:45:59] grudges and resentments and and the same
[1:46:02] habits you've got to keep growing and
[1:46:04] there's more in the word of God that you
[1:46:05] can enjoy and there's higher places you
[1:46:07] can Ascend to but you're only going to
[1:46:09] do it if you listen and heed the word of
[1:46:11] God and grow and mature he says you need
[1:46:14] to be taught the first
[1:46:16] principles because you're babes he says
[1:46:18] you are B he's saying you're babes you
[1:46:19] need to continually be taught you need
[1:46:21] milk and not strong meat says for
[1:46:23] everyone that uses milk is unskillful in
[1:46:25] the word of righteousness the ones that
[1:46:27] need milk are not skilled in the word
[1:46:29] for he is a babe but strong meat belongs
[1:46:31] to the
[1:46:33] mature strong meat belongs to them that
[1:46:35] are of full
[1:46:36] age verse 14 even those who by reason of
[1:46:40] use have their senses exercised to
[1:46:42] discern both good and evil there's your
[1:46:44] neuroplasticity by reason of use by
[1:46:48] learning the word of God by making
[1:46:49] application neural pathways are being
[1:46:51] formed in a spiritual sense you're
[1:46:52] increasing in the knowledge of the Lord
[1:46:54] Jesus Christ you're increasing in wisdom
[1:46:55] and understanding of the word of God and
[1:46:57] you're experienced in the word of God
[1:46:58] and so meat belongs to those who have as
[1:47:01] they have matured and exercised thems in
[1:47:03] the word they're able to handle
[1:47:10] it in Hebrews chapter 6 veres 1
[1:47:16] to3 the very next chapter he explains
[1:47:18] what he
[1:47:20] means they babes they haven't matured
[1:47:23] but this is what he wants therefore
[1:47:25] leaving the principles of the doctrine
[1:47:27] of Christ let us go on unto
[1:47:30] Perfection this is tootes the perfect
[1:47:32] one Christ the statue of a perfect man
[1:47:35] adulthood maturity not laying in the
[1:47:38] foundation of repentance from dead works
[1:47:40] and of Faith toward god of the doctrine
[1:47:42] of baptisms and laying on of hands and
[1:47:44] the resurrection of the dead and eternal
[1:47:46] judgment these are all the fundamental
[1:47:48] things that that this is the milk of the
[1:47:49] word these are the things that you enjoy
[1:47:51] you notice sometimes and and I want to
[1:47:54] be very very clear about this that when
[1:47:56] one has a genuine experience of the new
[1:47:59] birth there is a deep change brother
[1:48:01] said a birth is a mess and for some it
[1:48:04] can be shouting some it can be crying
[1:48:06] some it could be D there could be a way
[1:48:07] that that the experience can manifest
[1:48:09] itself in different ways and then in
[1:48:11] that youthful exuberance and enthusiasm
[1:48:13] what is characteristic of our youth when
[1:48:15] the spirit of God begins to move they
[1:48:17] manifest themselves physically and they
[1:48:19] really really enjoy it and if somebody
[1:48:21] as they age in the word of God and they
[1:48:23] grow in the trajectory of the word if
[1:48:25] they don't exhibit those same
[1:48:27] characteristics it's not because they've
[1:48:29] lost their experience they've just
[1:48:32] grown and so don't take that experience
[1:48:35] away from young people don't take that
[1:48:37] away from the youth let them enjoy it
[1:48:39] but make sure they're getting the word
[1:48:40] make sure they're getting the word birth
[1:48:41] and let them enjoy their youth but Paul
[1:48:43] is saying let us go on to the perfect
[1:48:47] one let us grow up from these baptisms
[1:48:50] whether it be water baptism the baptism
[1:48:52] of the Holy Ghost the laying on of hands
[1:48:53] and all these fundamental things we
[1:48:54] believe them we exercise them but we've
[1:48:57] got to grow
[1:48:58] up and he says this we will do if God
[1:49:00] permit God must allow us to come to
[1:49:02] perfect faith and that's what we're
[1:49:04] having to come to in this hour is
[1:49:06] perfection we have to come to perfect
[1:49:08] faith in order for the
[1:49:20] rapture we we invite the musicians to
[1:49:22] come we just close with a
[1:49:24] story I'm sure you're familiar with
[1:49:29] it brother brandom tells a story how I
[1:49:31] think he was in Canada and he was on a
[1:49:33] horseback he was hunting and he said he
[1:49:35] got to a ridge and he looked out and he
[1:49:36] saw these really tall trees that were
[1:49:38] dead it didn't have leaves and the wind
[1:49:41] be to blow and as the wind would blow
[1:49:43] and move the these old
[1:49:44] [Music]
[1:49:46] trees and it just he said it's just like
[1:49:48] they're moaning and groaning and the
[1:49:49] wind would blow and these uh gloomy dead
[1:49:53] trees just stiff in the wind and they're
[1:49:56] moaning and
[1:49:57] groaning and as he looked he noticed
[1:49:59] down below there was young
[1:50:01] trees and he said they were just
[1:50:05] frolicking frolicking in the wind
[1:50:08] frolicking enjoying themselves just
[1:50:10] this uh dancing and waving in the wind
[1:50:13] he said the same wind that was making
[1:50:14] the old on dead ones grown was same wind
[1:50:17] that was making these young ones green
[1:50:19] ones just enjoy themselves and he said
[1:50:21] he said it was the wind of the Holy
[1:50:22] spirit in typ said it's like the wind of
[1:50:24] the Holy Spirit these young trees green
[1:50:26] trees they had life in them so they were
[1:50:28] flexible and they were young just
[1:50:30] growing and they were shouting and they
[1:50:31] were rejoicing and he said this these
[1:50:34] old dead trees could no longer move
[1:50:35] anymore the life had left them but these
[1:50:39] green trees could enjoy the presence of
[1:50:41] the Lord they could enjoy they could
[1:50:42] wave and they could
[1:50:43] move and he said if I've ever seen a
[1:50:46] holy ghost meeting that was
[1:50:48] one because these young trees could be
[1:50:51] responsive
[1:50:53] but that young tree now some people
[1:50:55] might sayi want this tree to stay young
[1:50:58] forever but that's not the purpose of
[1:51:01] the
[1:51:01] tree it it's not to be a
[1:51:04] sapling it it it's to come to fruit it's
[1:51:07] to come to maturity it's to Bear seeds
[1:51:10] to bring forth more that's the goal the
[1:51:13] greenness the greenness in this respect
[1:51:15] was showing that there's life in it for
[1:51:17] it to grow and not that it would ever
[1:51:18] stop moving in the wind but it wasn't
[1:51:21] just to stay in that place nor do you
[1:51:23] want to be
[1:51:24] dead but the goal was not just Frolic
[1:51:27] but the goal was that wind was to Shake
[1:51:28] The Roots and get them to go down deeper
[1:51:30] to stabilize them so that they could
[1:51:32] what keep life in them and they could
[1:51:35] grow and they could mature brother
[1:51:37] brandham says and Christ has revealed in
[1:51:38] his own word he said that's what's the
[1:51:40] problem with the message today or that's
[1:51:42] the matter with the message today sorry
[1:51:44] those who obtain it the word the message
[1:51:47] in their hearts must lay in the presence
[1:51:49] of the sun to be ripened the scriptural
[1:51:52] word ripen is mature when the grapes are
[1:51:55] ripe matured in other words they can't
[1:51:57] there no no more time on the vine will
[1:52:01] make it more mature when something's
[1:52:03] ripe what happens if it stays on the
[1:52:04] vine begins to rot so it's like this is
[1:52:08] the perfect moment the climax where it's
[1:52:10] fully mature this is the moment where
[1:52:12] it's at its peak its best he says it has
[1:52:13] to lay in the presence of the ripen he
[1:52:16] says you can pick up the
[1:52:17] message then let the sun bake all the
[1:52:20] greenness out of you making matured
[1:52:24] Christians that's what we want God to do
[1:52:27] I want to be in the word of God I want
[1:52:28] to be in the presence of God I want to
[1:52:29] be in fellowship with the people of God
[1:52:31] I want to be obedient to the voice of
[1:52:33] God so that I can not just be this young
[1:52:36] whipper snapper tossed about by every
[1:52:38] wind and uh wrestling Here There and up
[1:52:41] and down and in and out but I want to
[1:52:42] grow and I want to increase and I want
[1:52:44] to become a mature
[1:52:46] Christian I said all that to say that
[1:52:48] God is not a
[1:52:49] grandpa in other words he doesn't love
[1:52:52] you at that little
[1:52:54] Stage 5 years old just cute as a button
[1:52:57] telling funny stories getting your
[1:52:59] saying mixed up he is a father who in
[1:53:03] love loves you at two loves you at three
[1:53:06] loves you at eight loves you at 13 right
[1:53:09] he doesn't have terrible twos right
[1:53:10] they're terrific twos he loves you loves
[1:53:13] you as a teenager loves you in that
[1:53:14] stage when maybe you're a little bit
[1:53:16] ashamed and don't want to sit at the
[1:53:17] same table with them he love he loves
[1:53:19] you through all of it and he's got a
[1:53:20] plan to bring you to maturity and he's
[1:53:22] not going to give up on you because in
[1:53:24] love he's Duty bound to bring you to
[1:53:27] this place of maturity and that's what
[1:53:29] it means that God is not a grandpa is he
[1:53:32] doesn't want he doesn't want you in a
[1:53:33] nursery doesn't want you in a crib
[1:53:35] doesn't want you in a
[1:53:36] daycare he wants you to grow up
[1:53:39] completely and if we're not careful
[1:53:41] there's voices and there's attitudes
[1:53:43] that want to keep us forever young here
[1:53:46] right and then we get it out of order
[1:53:48] because once we've reached our maturity
[1:53:50] there comes a point when this body of
[1:53:52] Christ can no longer remain in the
[1:53:55] presence of the Sun and get more ripe
[1:53:57] because Jesus said as soon as the
[1:53:58] Harvest is soon as it comes the Harvest
[1:54:01] has come the maturity has come it's at
[1:54:03] its peak the Rapture comes the Harvest
[1:54:06] comes and the sickle is brought forth
[1:54:09] and we'll go to meet him in the air and
[1:54:11] there there will be an eternal youth
[1:54:14] meeting in our youth but yet fully
[1:54:16] matured Sons and Daughters of God Amen
[1:54:20] God bless you thanks for your patience
[1:54:21] today that was a long one maybe for the
[1:54:22] visitors that was a really long one but
[1:54:24] God bless you let's
[1:54:27] stand brother John I don't I doubt you
[1:54:29] preached that long so I want the
[1:54:30] visitors to know this is maybe not a
[1:54:33] customary I'm the long-winded preacher
[1:54:35] from
[1:54:37] Arizona but God bless you I just I so
[1:54:39] grateful to I ministered things I
[1:54:41] ministered these things today that I
[1:54:42] think I mentioned Wednesday I've been
[1:54:43] studying on for quite some time haven't
[1:54:45] even ministered at our home church so
[1:54:46] it's nice to be in a place where you
[1:54:48] know you can have I have the Liberty
[1:54:50] just to teach these things in the word
[1:54:51] of God let's just bow our heads in a
[1:54:53] word of prayer before we turn it over to
[1:54:54] Brother
[1:54:56] John we know that one day there is going
[1:54:58] to be a meeting in the air and at that
[1:55:01] day we're going to be in our
[1:55:04] youth going to be in perfect bodies and
[1:55:06] perfect Minds never to be sick again but
[1:55:09] I say in the meantime Lord let it be our
[1:55:11] prayer that we
[1:55:13] grow and may we even as parents take a
[1:55:16] more active role in teaching our
[1:55:17] children the right things promoting the
[1:55:19] right virtues Desiring to see them have
[1:55:22] their own
[1:55:23] experience that we can be participants
[1:55:27] and co-workers with God to see that our
[1:55:30] children are growing in the grace of God
[1:55:32] and coming to maturity and let us Avail
[1:55:35] ourselves to God to the resources that
[1:55:38] he put in our lives of a of a pastor a
[1:55:40] gift of a pastor and Brother Bruce who
[1:55:42] ministers the word of God and the other
[1:55:43] gifts in the body of Christ may we just
[1:55:45] Avail ourselves to the body of Christ
[1:55:47] that it can edify Us in love make an
[1:55:50] increase of the gift that's in my life
[1:55:52] so that I could come to maturity
[1:55:54] Also let's pray heavenly father today
[1:55:57] Lord as we just in this part of the
[1:55:59] service we ask for Grace upon us I would
[1:56:02] say first and foremost Lord that through
[1:56:04] the the breadth of this sermon and just
[1:56:06] the sheer amount of scripture and
[1:56:07] principles that were shared made this
[1:56:09] simple thought and that that
[1:56:13] beautiful uh line that was just woven
[1:56:15] into this fabric of growing up yes and
[1:56:19] how that there is this tendency in this
[1:56:20] human sense to want to
[1:56:23] keep keep children of God as
[1:56:26] babes Lord even ministers sometimes in
[1:56:29] movements will try to keep the children
[1:56:30] of God as babes because they can tell
[1:56:32] them what to do they can manipulate them
[1:56:34] through Sensations and Fantastics and
[1:56:38] incentivize them to certain things by
[1:56:39] making promises
[1:56:41] and when they remain children they
[1:56:43] remain babes they can be manipulated
[1:56:45] they can be controlled they can be led
[1:56:46] astray and sometimes men maybe not even
[1:56:49] intentionally but they don't realize
[1:56:51] that what they're doing is their
[1:56:52] stunting the growth in the maturity of
[1:56:54] your
[1:56:55] children and Lord may we not take
[1:56:57] comfort in stages of adolescence and
[1:57:00] being a toddler even infants or babes
[1:57:02] but Lord may we desire to grow ourselves
[1:57:05] and may we seek out obedience to your
[1:57:08] word that we can mature and that we can
[1:57:09] grow and may may we be more active
[1:57:12] participants not just in our own growth
[1:57:14] but in the growth of others that we
[1:57:16] might mature and
[1:57:18] increase and father I pray help us with
[1:57:22] our discernment Lord in this hour we
[1:57:25] don't want uh our churches to be
[1:57:27] daycares we don't want our churches to
[1:57:29] be nurseries Lord we don't want as
[1:57:32] ministers to be babysitters and nor do
[1:57:34] we want our families just to be ruled
[1:57:36] with a rod of iron and constantly
[1:57:39] chastising and disciplining and never
[1:57:41] see
[1:57:42] growth but Lord give us the grace to
[1:57:44] know how to deal with stubbornness and
[1:57:46] Rebellion give us the grace to know how
[1:57:48] to deal with it in our own Hearts but
[1:57:51] Lord we do see in the word that when
[1:57:52] children are rebellious and stubborn you
[1:57:54] admonish them to grow to lay aside to
[1:57:59] persevere and to not be
[1:58:02] caught in Youth and in experience I
[1:58:06] commit everybody to you today pray that
[1:58:07] you bless them and strengthen them
[1:58:09] encourage them Father as they've been so
[1:58:11] attentive and they've listened so
[1:58:12] beautifully to your word Lord may you
[1:58:14] bless them I pray in the name of the
[1:58:16] Lord Jesus Christ we ask these things
[1:58:18] amen amen God bless you we love you very
[1:58:21] much brother John appreciate the
[1:58:23] privilege uh in letting me Minister and
[1:58:25] even just maybe do it in a more personal
[1:58:27] way and so may God bless you we love you
[1:58:33] [Applause]
[1:58:39] John oh
[1:58:43] my that that was
[1:58:46] everything that was a masterpiece it
[1:58:48] really
[1:58:49] was we needed that amen we needed
[1:58:55] that and
[1:58:58] we we need to follow through now right
[1:59:01] we need to follow through we can't be
[1:59:03] satisfied with just hearing the perfect
[1:59:05] word we've got to take this word home
[1:59:08] we're g to meditate on it and and and
[1:59:12] pray God help us in our
[1:59:15] home to begin to mature what you've
[1:59:18] called us to be amen because it's more
[1:59:21] than just the Badge of them in the
[1:59:23] message but it's the one thing that
[1:59:25] spoke so much to me is that if we are
[1:59:28] truly growing ourselves as
[1:59:31] individuals we can't but help to help
[1:59:34] others grow so if we're not trying to
[1:59:37] help somebody to grow it kind of
[1:59:39] shineing the light where what's
[1:59:40] happening inside of us our goal should
[1:59:43] be growth amen I just appreciated that
[1:59:47] message and how many want uh brother
[1:59:50] Aaron to take send the light screen
[1:59:52] gretings back to Arizona's believing
[1:59:54] church amen amen praise the Lord let's
[1:59:58] just sing I am so needy

[2:00:04] feel so needy
