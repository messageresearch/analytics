our heart lord with the thoughts that were spoken words that were spoken to brother branham that the angel of the lord like that song lord we come to you believing in your presence being here lord we're doubting our doubts we're doubting our fears we cast out all unbelief and we believe that you are in control lord come and take full possession of our thoughts and our heart and lord allow only faith in your word to exist here and we pray that you'd give us revelation of your word today lord what you would have for us you're able to take lord anything that's spoken and and help your people because that's the god that you are we just commit ourselves to you we pray that you close our mouth from saying anything that would be wrong lord even in the slightest way but lord let it let the words that be spoken be true may they be fruitful may they be helpful for our church as we grow lord we commit the service in you your hands now ask your blessings and the reading of the word in jesus precious name we pray amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of proverbs chapter 3. how many like proverbs chapter 3 a very very familiar set of scriptures we're going to read verses 1 through 12 and then we'll have you be seated the bible says my son forget not my law but let thy heart keep my commandments for length of days and long life and peace shall they add to thee let not mercy in truth forsake thee bind them upon thy neck and write them upon the table thine heart and so shall thou find favor and good understanding in the sight of god and man trust in the lord with all that heart and lean not unto thy own understanding how hard it is to do this in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths be not wise in your own eyes but fear the lord and depart from evil it shall be held to thy navel and marrow to thy bones unto the lord with thy substance with the first fruits of all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine my son despise not the chasing of the lord neither be weary of his correction god bless you may be seated for whom the lord loveth he corrected even as the father the son in whom he delighteth we want to take our text from verse number nine honor the lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thy increase i want to title this message honoring the lord with our substance and for a subject our monetary offering obligations we're going to be talking about money and cash today some believers want to come to church and honor the lord with praises with amens but we're supposed to honor the lord also with the first fruits of all our substance that's what happens from the course of the week uh whatever has been increased to you we need to honor the lord with the first fruit of it how many pays ties faithfully faithfully all right from you i need amens because this is not an enjoyable subject we haven't talked on ties and offerings for about two years but it's scriptural and needful and it helps pay the bills god loves a cheerful giver that's a giver who gives from his heart with joyful intentions the bible says we ought to bring an offering of praise when we come to church psalms 35 18 says i will give thanks in the great congregation i will praise thee among much people by him hebrews 13 15 says by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually that is the fruit of our lips giving thanks to his name so sometimes we can say amen and then sometimes we can say thank you lord for the lord praise you for that word we need that word lord amen coming to church without this offering would make our personal experience our personal ex spiritual experience come short of it what it's intended to be why because god inhabits the praises of his people we should never come to church without praise offerings he's done so much for us we need to enter his gates with thanksgiving his courts with what a big praise a big praise offering why he he saved our soul from eternal separation he delivered us from so many bad habits and evil things he literally saved us from ourselves he brought healings to our bodies so many times and just because we got sick again it doesn't mean he's still worthy to praise it for all the times he did heal us he's watched over us and he's kept us till this day coming here in our walk with the lord he has led us by the holy spirit and brought us into all truth and i i really love the the the revelation from last service the holy spirit is sent for our soul to come into god's nature that's the truth jesus said i am the way the truth and the life and the holy spirit is set to lead us and guide us into all truth well what is that truth that's the nature of god we're to be like him when he comes we can make god in the holy spirit for only certain things and we need to make them for the intention was to come and live in the church and to set it in order for the coming of the lord our heart should always be filled with praises when we enter the storehouse this is the storehouse it has done so much for us we should never come to church without praise offerings what else should we bring into god's house that was a question offerings of prayer and intercessions jesus says jesus said my house shall be called a house of prayer we need to bring prayers into the sanctuary [Music] what else should we bring into god's house monetary offerings as well brother ram said no service is complete without it so i'll say for you if you don't give an offering service is not you haven't made the service complete now this is going to be a teaching and this i'm speaking to everybody that's live streaming i am don't think because we're not here we don't got to worry about it this is something i want to plague you every service because we have an obligation that's the only reason we have an obligation the first monetary offering i want to talk about is what takes care of the needs of our church this is this is important one we haven't done this since we moved in i mean we just moved into church and presto were here and nothing said about it well i wanted us to just be home enjoy but it's time to get down to the nitty-gritty and talk about things now every one of us has monthly payments that need to be paid in our personal lives in order to live where we live to drive the car we drive to do the things that we do you don't you don't pay your electric bill it won't stay on forever now if you don't have that going that means you're a bum and you're soaking off of somebody else and if you're going to be a bum brother brandon said be the best bum you can so i'll just say here to you feel that way just bum as much as you want here you're welcome to be a bum but i want to ask you a question do you consider this church to be your home church i'm speaking to everybody the live stream answer the question from the from the bottom of your heart when someone asks you what church do you go to do you say i go to that send the light church there in fenton oh yeah our pastor his name is john martin is that what you feel so if we're identified with this church that we need to be identified with taking care of the church don't just be identified with the benefits of the church we need to be identified with the responsibilities of the church so i would like to put something up on the board right now it's maybe something that some of us have wanted to look at these are church expenses does that look like that's too much rent there's somebody that's paying attention how about anybody else got some more that's paying attention i just want to say this once and i never want it set again there's four over 485 000 that was put in here before we had our first service try getting a mortgage for that it's a very fair price and the church hasn't paid you know anything we need to make this a part of our our expense we have insurance that we have to pay these are monthly expenses our electrical our internet our heating and cooling sometimes we got like now lots of protein sometimes we're going to have uh the acs going now that doesn't include a lot of the the extras that we've had to do but we've got the snow in the grass the cleaning uh supplies the operating system it's quite uh low it's quite low to be honest with you um but we've got just over three thousand we divided by eight services and we have 385 dollars that we need in church offerings to pay for what we enjoy now this is just facts we may not want to look at it may not want to deal with it may think it's not fair may think this is not encouraging this is not what i've come for but these are facts somehow we have got to take responsibility for these expenses you may not like the responsibility of your personal bills but you still have to pay them no different than here we need to care enough about this 385 now listen even if you don't come to service if this is your home church you need to have a burden care about that offering even if you're not here because it still has to be paid whether you're here or not i say we need to take a personal spiritual ownership because it's our church it's our church unless you're a visitor and you're just going to visit forever [Laughter] we don't want to be a bum and we don't want to bum along someone has cared enough for us to have this let's ask the question do we care enough to maintain the bills that's it do we care enough to maintain it now we can ignore the reality of these bills and we can put our responsibility on somebody else who's being faithful who's being dedicated but we're going to learn that this is going to get us on the wrong side of god i appreciate each and every one of you but we have a monetary offering obligation here acts of kindness and love don't pay the bills spending an hour here spending an hour with it don't pay the bills it helps we need it but we need the bills paid too you all were thinking boy i wasn't praying for this when i was praying for the service it's overdue malachi chapter 3 verse 6 turn with me there malachi chapter 3 verse 6. the bible says for i am the lord i change not that's a real important verse i change not so we don't want to think god's different here therefore ye sons of jacob are not consumed god is the same yesterday today and forever even from the days of your fathers year gone away from my ordinances and have not kept them return unto me and i will return until you say it the lord of hosts but ye said wherein shall we return in other words i think i'm already with you lord will a man rob god and get away with it look what they they tried to do to this man that had a semi and people got killed they didn't want that man to get away with it will a man rob god and get away with it yet ye have yet he have robbed me but you say what what are you talking about god where have we robbed thee in tithes and offerings robbing god is not the way to find favor with god now in order to rob somebody you have to take something away from them without their consent as you just you go into their car and you grab something that's robbing them in other words you manipulate the other person to take what doesn't belong to you and this is what we're doing to god because believe it or not our tithes and offerings they belong to god whether you think it want to accept it believe it not it doesn't matter what you think or believe it is the truth god is saying tithe and offering belongs to him even though we work for our money with our with sweat and tears or the money is given to us either way the tithes and the offerings from it belong to him jesus said give the caesars what caesars give to god's with god we let caesar take taxes out of our check or at least most of us do we should be willing and cheerfully take out the money that belongs to god and give it to him i do not want you and i'm not asking you to give more than what god has told you to give but don't say god has not told me to give and that's why i don't give. i don't believe that i believe that's you saying what god wants when we don't give tithes and offerings to god we're robbing them he views it as robbing him no one would want to rob god we come to church asking god to bless us lord heal us lord direct us lord prosper us lord help us but god says wait a minute it's not one way straight here will a man rob god yet you robbed me but you say where where we wherein where i'm sorry where and have we robbed thee a lot of people don't realize this but they rob god the same guy that they're worshiping at church they also rob think about that statement they worship god and they rob them that's how how the enemy can deceive us someone sent me this said if the truth makes you uncomfortable don't blame the truth blame the lie that made you comfortable blame the lie that made you feel comfortable to begin with a lot of people don't realize that they're gonna not gonna make it until it's too late brother branham said over and over that uh people are gonna uh think the rapture is still happening it's already passed they're gonna come to the altar thinking they're getting saved and you they're they can't get saved it's too late so this realization of truth is not selective right amen like we think it is it's not how we think we need a hunger for how god thinks jesus said in matthew chapter 7 verse 22 many i say many will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied in your name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then why profess to them i never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity so this is the part that god puts more emphasis on is the iniquity where everybody else all the other believers put the emphasis on god using them or them working for god instead of the obedience because simply iniquity is simply not doing the right thing what we're talking about not robbing a bank it's not doing the right thing it's not paying ties and offerings it can be considered iniquity that's what i want to get to iniquity is abounding in the hour that we're living in believers are doing more and more what they want instead of doing what god commands i mean there's so many people that are stopping going to church now and they're using the pandemic as a as a way out but jesus said all the more as you see the day approaching but the church world is saying yeah i can just see the two spirits so when we work not to pay our tithes and offerings we're really working iniquity strong statements but it's the truth and second timothy chapter 2 verse 19 says nevertheless the foundation of god sure having this seal the lord knows them that belong to him right the lord knoweth them that he is and let everyone that says i belong to god depart from depart from not doing the things that you don't want to do that you should be doing depart from that and believe me we all got iniquities he was bruised for our iniquities but that doesn't mean stay in them geez paul said depart from them when we refuse to pay our tithes and offerings don't expect things to go right in your lives if i had a dollar for every time i heard a complaint about finances from someone who didn't pay their tithes and offerings i'd literally be a rich man but you know you just don't hear complaining from faithful givers i mean the bible says that his seed would not go baking bread because god supplies he takes care of his own and there's a lot of people that belong to god that refuse to follow through with tithes and offerings think about it they think that's their money it's not will a man rob god yet you have robbed me but ye said when we rob thee and tithes and offerings verse 9 he accursed with a curse you are cursed with a curse for you allowed me even this whole nation but we know this nation is cursed the world is cursed it's going down the coming of the lord is at hand they just don't know it yet we can't just rob god and expect a wonderful relationship with him you know we put off ties and offerings out of our mind because basically we just don't get a lot of money it's something we don't want to deal with but you can't do that right we our emphasis comes so much on relationship relationship well if the relationship says we have a responsibility to keep our to keep his commandments if you love me keep my commandments it's part of the it relationship matter how many times we've used the name of jesus to cast out a devil how many times we prophesied or spoke in tongues or i don't care how many wonderful things we've done for his kingdom god is looking for obedience to what he says he wants us to do and at the end god's going to have the final say so he's going to call he's going to allow certain individuals to go into rapture and certain ones are not he certainly ain't going to be looking for any wonderful works i did how many devils i cast out how many times i used his name he's got to be looking for something else john chapter 10 verse 7 then jesus said unto them again verily verily i say unto you i am the door of the sheep so he's the door to the rapture after okay he said all that ever came before me what are they thieves and robbers all that ever came before me you know i remember when i first came to the lord i was trying to steal i was not being honest with god i told the lord that i'd serve him if he'd give me cheryl trying to rob steal you you don't make deals with god but then all that ever came before him but the sheep did not hear him i am the door but by me if any man enter in he shall be saved and shall go in and out find pasture the thief came not but to steal and to kill and destroy i am come that they might have life and that they might have it more abundantly i believe we're going to see here you rob god you limit your blessings you increase your curses and yet understand there's no switzerland with god there's no neutral stand with the word you either believe it or you don't you either obey it or you don't and if we choose not to god promises a curse of some sort in our life does it really get into what the curse is but to me i want to stay away from all of them but if we choose to obey god's word god promises more blessings than we can handle we won't even better handle them and notice there's nothing in between really cursed or really blessed there's nothing in between amen verse 10 bring ye all the ties into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house your money has something to do with the revelation that god wants to give you i'm not saying god ain't going to give you a revelation without an offering i'm not saying that but you're only going to go so far you're only going to go so far bringing all your ties and destroys that there may be meat in my house and prove me now we're with saith the lord of hosts if i will not open the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it the ties are to come into the storehouse god's storehouse this is a very special place here this is god's place we don't take our tithes and give them to the salvation army we don't give them to the widow woman we don't give them to the family who's out of money that our tithes don't go there if the bible said we could then i would say amen to that way of thinking there's a reason we don't we want to give our money in other places and think it's a god told me and and this is where i'm putting my tithes there's a reason for that we'll get into that but the bible says bringing all your ties into the storehouse why that there may be meat in my house tithe for meat ties for meat ties obedience for revelation how you want to slice it he didn't say so the bills could be met offerings are for the bills come on tithes are for the ministry your tithes go to whoever your pastor is wherever your spiritual meat comes from that's where your ties go there are many curses but to me the greatest is god keeping our heart from seeing him that veil just can't see him clearly just can't get the victory just can't that that to me is the greatest curse to me what is hell it's eternal separation from god what are we trying to get closer to god if we could focus on how do i get more of god rather than i have so much of god look at me come on we're on the same boat trying to get more of god who cares if you got more than me we just both need more he said um god wants us to prove him prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open the windows of heaven and pour you out of blessing that you should not have room enough to receive it remember when we were younger we always used to say prove it prove it when we were in school prove it god wants us to prove him god wants us to prove him he has no problem why because he's got the goods he's got the blessings he can pour them out can you imagine getting to a place whoa lord that's too much i got too much joy i got too much love i love my guy that's too much i had so much money i don't know what to do with it he wants us to prove he'll follow through if we do our part most people are scared to pay their tithes they're going to pay their tithes if they get all their bills done and they go like two weeks and that's it they don't know how to not lean to their own understanding and lead to the word they gotta be in control but this is this whole this whole walk is god's in control psalms 37 verse 25 i have been young and now i'm old yet i have not seen the righteous forsaken nor a seed begging bread he is ever merciful and what does he do he lendeth and his seed is blessed wouldn't you rather be a lender than a bower come on god can make you a lender i never want to be in a spot honestly that i have to ask and if my my god owns everything i think he's quite capable of taking care of me now it's different when you just come to christ it's different because you don't know god in that measure and he doesn't expect that but when you're told he's he is my everything [Music] we need to start believing it and we need to start believing that he is the one that will supply our needs now we just can't sit home don't work don't do anything and expect god to bless us and meet all of our needs the bible says if a man don't work he shouldn't eat there is a part that we have to play and we're talking about the part that needs to be played here at the church did you ever ask yourself the question does god really need my money come on i see my money he owns everything heaven is just thrown earth's his footstool what will you build me what house will you build me he created the heavens and the earth so what does god need with my money come on we've all had thoughts like these mainly those that that don't give now i understand that there's givers here and god bless you for giving but i think god wants us to do more giving god has an expectation of us and that's our first fruits to give the first fruits he don't care how many guns we buy how many fishing poles we buy but he expects first fruits from every one of us the first part that belongs to him what you do you want to buy four wheels you you want to buy an extra house you want doesn't matter first fruits go to god it's it is clearly seen in the scripture seek ye first the kingdom and then all the things shall be added to you and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart god wants proof from our lives not just our lips that we're putting him first not second not third but first honor the lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out with new wine we don't want to envy people that god is blessed don't disagree with god's choices if god chooses to bless somebody praise god amen just learn to give like they give learn to obey the word like they obey the word learn to give like they give brother bam taught us if we do the very same thing that somebody else did god is obligated he's obligated he will bless us he's not going to let us suffer right i think a lot of our suffering is really a curse it's just in a mild format we don't really really realize it right i i think i can say these things i i don't i you know me anybody that knows me knows i don't beg for money i don't ask for money i don't tell you need to be given money why would i go two years i'm probably the only church that goes as long as we do without talking about this stuff seriously we don't pass the plate brother johnson really wanted to come tonight called want to come oh he just loves the church loves the spirit wanted to come he said well brother johnson we're we're just going to be talking about tithes and offerings okay well come on another i want to hear you preach he said it just is what it is despite the fact that god doesn't need our money his program on earth does and he has a definite expectation from us what belongs to him and that is the first fruits of all our increase god doesn't want the leftovers can you imagine going into a restaurant and they say well this is all i got i got the leftovers we would not eat there and god doesn't want someone's leftovers you you earn a hundred dollars that week you he expects 10 bucks in that in the back you give them a buck 85 or three bucks that's leftovers don't call it ties ties is not part you're still robbing god when you give your leftovers you may think you're giving god decision offerings but you're not right you're given your interpretation or your definition of what tithing offerings is we should give to the needs of our church it's your church you're part of the church every service is part of god's program like i said before even the services that were not here you know if if you don't not care about the church when you're not here i question where your heart is at the needs of the church are there whether we're there or not i don't know how many times if i had a five bucks for every time brother marty says would you not worry about the church and just go and enjoy your time with your wife he'd say that to me every time we went away over the years it is i can't comment just okay leaving it all here you you carry it and if you really really care about the expenses of the church you don't just don't think about it because it bothers you you pray you know we i've asked the song leaders to come up here and let's get serious about reminding the people about the needs of the church but now you know the needs of the church we need to pray with sincerity we need to give money when we come to churches it's our our obligation to god what more do we need i need more money to do it no you need more faith in the word to do it that's right what would you do with more money god loves the cheerful giver the church church offerings are taken up so we can function as a church so jesus comes we're just going to be paying these same bills and if we all decided hey we're not going to have church here we can just close it up we won't have to pay the electric anymore return off the gas and you know that'd be it but until jesus comes we're going to have to be fighting the snow how many enjoys having a warm church when it's freezing out there but somebody's got to pay for that every service we need to be aware conscious sincerely caring prayerful and joyful about giving don't give unless you want to keep your money i say keep your money if you don't want to give joyfully i feel glad that i've never ever had to ask somebody for something or feel manipulated to give somebody to give i've never taken a set don't plan on doing it by the grace of god but it's the will of god to do it we don't want to block it out of our mind we don't want to skip over we don't want to just hurry with the prayer we want to say god we need your help here because we don't have 385 dollars coming in that box every service we don't right but we need it well brother john i know what you're asking me i'm asking you to get serious about giving that's all that's all i'm asking god will take care of it but if we don't do our part that we either block it out with somebody else is doing it you know brother john he'll take care of it come on that that thought has been so real because of the faithfulness that's god's goodness it is grace to us but god wants us to grow up and we're go we're going to have more people coming and they got to be taught what's going to happen when i leave what's going to happen when i'm gone well i'll just step up and i'll preach brother john well that's good for you who's going to pay for it so it's not just being able to preach the word we've got to live the word there's more to it than just up here now we also have other offerings besides the church offerings and this is visiting ministers and this is not my visiting minister this is your visiting minister you want visiting ministers you want somebody besides that old brother john mixed up with somebody's got to pay for that man now remember when we have a visiting minister he gets an offering because jesus said the labor is worthy of his hire so he's got to get paid he's got also got travel expenses and and so i'll be honest with you some of these brother daryl a number of these brothers that we've had won't sleep in a home you got to give them a hotel you got to pay for their hotel their their planes easy easy spend two grand on heaven brother a brother here easy but we still got that 385 that has to be paid for the church at that same time so when you want a visiting minister it's even costing us more not the same it you know when you come to church you need to bring more than a praise offering more than a prayer offering more than thanksgiving you need to show it in that box now we're all thankful that we don't have to pass a plate and constantly be looked at by everybody else to make sure we put something in let's take it a step further and show god how much we really appreciate now that we know what's going on here there's church expenses visiting minister expenses and then there's missionary expenses that's another expense can you believe that when we come to church we usually don't see the missionaries we don't think about it we we hear as far as a request but this church believes in mission work brother branham said that every church ought to have a missionary program and it's always the will of god they're laboring for souls and they're in third world countries you think you don't got money you got a lot more money than they got so who's the church you are the church do you have a missionary program in your heart it takes time it takes money we must be a part of god's missionary program that's what's gathering the rest of our family together and when you give a dollar for the missionaries you're you're given a dollar to see your brother saved in heaven that's what's really happening and if you have no vision for your brother who's not saved people are going to perish so we need a vision for all these expenses these three expenses are the responsibility for every believer and literally we have to have faith for them these responsibilities are not for the rich and the well-off those who like to work extra that's not what the responsibility these responsibilities are for the believer too many people choose to believe differently rather than what the word teaches now imagine for a moment we could discuss every one of our personal situations and discover who has the most needs in our church who needs the money the most and we just take up an offering every service for the person who's got the greatest needs now that's the way a lot of people think why why people given to me why why ain't people helping me well there would be no end to that and can if we had enough money that would be wonderful but look at the need of the church what are we going to put that on back on god that's called robbing we're going to put that back on the pastor i wish we had enough money to just distribute to everybody hey in fact i'll pay you the tithes it'd be wonderful we have that kind of money coming in but we don't i believe god wants to pour out his blessings here i believe god wants to pour his blessings out upon his people but they've got to do their part tithes and offerings belong to him right amen they're to be brought into the storehouse a person who neglects their monetary church responsibility and finds more pleasure in giving to some individual isn't worthy of the church it's a strong statement i'm not saying i read it from anywhere i didn't that's just how i feel the church is not some government subsidiary it's not a social a socialist funding if you're part of the church then be a part of the responsibility to keep the bills paid that's all there is to it we're not like the secretary of state and get your driver's license to us this is where you come in you get fed you meet god you believe this is the place that god has you then be a part of the responsibility of it well brother john i i just i don't think about it very much we'll start thinking about it start carrying the burden with you bear one another's burden bear the burden of the church a churchgoer cannot only rob god of these blessings but they can easily rob god with their ties what i'm going to say here ties are the first 10 of what comes into your life i don't care if the government gives it to you i don't care if some buddy gives you a a gift a 50 starbucks card it's new to your life first fruits belong to god whether you work for it or it's given to you by a friend or it's from the government it just doesn't matter god views what comes into your life each week as an increase increase now you take that and give 10 to god now that's just the ties don't forget the offerings don't forget the offerings if you only had five dollars in your pocket and you spent it at tim hortons or starbucks you're left with nothing it's gone right then somebody comes along and gives you a five dollar bill because you didn't have anything or you choose to labor and wash somebody's car for five dollars either way that five dollars is in your hand and you oh god 10 percent ties and an offering out of it you don't say well i didn't work for that if i just do what i want no i'm sorry it's not it is it an increase to your life or not if it's an increase to your life then you're in god's business see we want to kick gods out of our monetary business true that's why we don't consider what we owe god we think as long as i i put two dollars in that offering plate i i cheerfully did it and everything's great how long we've been robbing god i wish everybody was here everybody's not here but this is for everybody that's listening not just for us that are here god help us to give what we owe him now the scriptures show us that ten percent which is called tithes belongs to god no one else not a man not a will woman not another need that you want to give it to just because you have a personal experience you don't take god's money and give it to them you don't you bring it into the storehouse we've got to learn to do what the bible says we don't give our tithes to whoever we want to and imagine that they're going to god i remember the prophet telling you read church order it's quite clear you don't take god's money and give it away he said there would be he spent twenty thousand he lost twenty thousand dollars by helping people who lied to him and tricked him about tires for their cars it was his own money it wasn't god's he never took god's money it was his own money and people took advantage of he was a prophet think about that but god will allow that he will allow that to pray for those that despitefully use you they'll pay for it in the end they will pay for it in the end but god's money belongs to god one hundred percent of them belong to god god wants his ties and his offerings brought into the storehouse not somebody else that you would like to give his money away to the brand says your tithes belong to the pastor the ministry that feeds you spiritually the one that's ordained to take us through now what the pastor does with that money well you know we just need to have a a separate meeting on that one but is it our business what he does with it but i can tell you what when we get on the other side you'll be so proud now every time tithe was paid in the bible it was 10 and it went to the ministry they didn't substitute their tithes and offerings and give it to the poor they were two separate offerings all together now unfortunately there are thousands of ministers who have taken advantage of people's money oh okay hey we got we got got more amens on that one get the church involved [Laughter] and it isn't right they literally have robbed the people to me it's the people's own fault for being under their ministry that's a god's truth why would somebody sit under a ministry that they're being robbed tai's have gotten a bad name because of it of how many ministers have abused their office but just because there are ministers that do this it doesn't make paying ties wrong we've heard of defunding the police right can you imagine if we just take all the police out of the country oh yes that would be so much more calm and and peaceful and look what they look what happened where they did defund the priests well they did take them out look at all the chaos that went on there's all the looting robbing but just because that's going on you don't defund the police oh brother john you don't you don't understand they're they're corrupt they take bribes they steal they rob they even kill black people because it doesn't matter if you kill the white ones right just talk about but they're so bad you know we just need to defund them just because there's corruption in the police department doesn't mean we should defund them just because there's ministers and ministries that are corrupt in the church it doesn't mean we should defund god's program of paying tithes either get the man out put a god-fearing man in or find another church but stay with god's program just because there's a lot of quack doctors out there doesn't mean we shouldn't pay any doctor right we've got dentists out i won't go to that dentist fire departments ambulances you can in every profession you're going to find some quack we just don't get rid of everybody because oh we happen to have a nurse that doesn't help us that doesn't care well let's get to fund all the nurses in the world you don't do that you don't think like that but satan has got so many people to stop paying tithes because of what garbage has happened with some ministries that have taken advantage of the people instead of just getting serious with god and finding out what god wants them to do i'll just take things in my own hands we don't defund the pastors just because there's a lot of quack teachers out there there's a lot more people robbing god of their ties than there are ministries of robbing the people think about it another way that certain believers have been robbing god is paying less than ten percent when you pay nine percent you haven't paid all your ties they've been deceived into thinking that paying ties is any amount that you want to give we call that ties that is so un you need to be taught to me that's a crooked thief in my book you don't give short of what god's saying and then say you did it right then you'll come to me and they say lord lord didn't we didn't we didn't we didn't we you came short in the book when you agree on paying a certain amount with somebody don't renege ever renege you don't like it when somebody reneges with you when they make a promise you on the follow through and when you don't even if you don't say something about it it bothers you but how does god feel well nobody ever told me i'm supposed to do this i'm telling you let it forever be settled i don't care if you leave the church i don't care what happens you've heard the truth if you're paying your tithes then pay all your tithes less than 10 percent if you're only paying 8 if you've only paid 8 percent then say i haven't never paid all my ties it's real easy at the end of the year you know how much you do you do your taxes or you have someone else do your taxes and you know how much money quite simple did you give ten percent of that to ties and how much of that percent did you give for offerings what about the visiting minister what about the missions right well brother john you are just asking too much i am not asking you to do a thing i'm just recording what the bible says it's a big difference you there's people in this message that say they're in the message and they don't pay tithes once a month the other three weeks if you're in the message you say you're in the message this is what the message believes if it's not come up here and tell me it's not brother ryan says okay bring your group bring your panel prove it's wrong we we we want god to bless us but we want to be it just to me i don't serve god for the blessings i don't give my tithes for the blessings to be honest with you i give so much more than my tithes it's not even funny but i don't do it for the blessings i don't even think of it i just want to help and when you give an offering it helps the church it helps the church wouldn't it be a blessing that before i leave that this church actually can function with tithes and offerings without anything extra coming in and then get to a place where you can get a surplus you can get visiting ministers in here this vision that we're holding before you it's of the lord i i know of of a couple churches after the pastor left just in shambles big churches everybody has their own ideas about how things should be right but you have to have things in order god's way in god leading it and i i believe that that god is calling us up higher if we only got seven percent of all of our increase to be paid then we haven't paid all of our tithes we still owe god now even though the new year has started don't expect god to forget what you owe them from last year i know i'm pulling some stuff out but here's the things we don't think about right just because you're not thinking about it doesn't mean god isn't the whole thing is we're in if where we robbed you lord they don't even know they're not even thinking about it but god's still staring at them you rob me so when we think about paying ties we're not thinking about what we're going to do next week let's think about what's happened in the past call it out have we been guilty of robbing god i know nobody wants wants to to deal with that but we need to god is able to make all grace abound to us he's also able to stop his grace he can bless us or he can put a curse on us he gives more grace to the humble two scriptures and we're closing proverbs 3 verse 7 let's read it be not wise in thine own eyes fear the lord and depart from evil i say just get rid of all your personal thinking fear the lord depart from that and it shall be how to the navel and marrow to thy bones honor the lord with a substance and with the first fruit of every thing that comes into your life if you don't have to work for it and it's a gift thank the lord for that but you still owe god his part and if you're faithful so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses they're just gonna burst out with new wine but we know what wine represents all right second corinthians chapter nine verse 5. we're going to end with this second corinthians chapter 9 verse 5. therefore i thought it necessary to exhort the brethren that they would be that they would go before you and make up beforehand your bounty whereof ye have had noticed before that the same might be ready as a matter of bounty not as of covetedness we're talking about giving amen but this i say he which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly and he that soweth bountifully shall also shall reap also bountifully what a promise every man according as he purposeth in his heart so that's why you got to think about it you just go okay always have the stand together it's just you know have a little prayer for the offering sit down what have you purposed in your heart you've got a purpose in your heart what you're going to give so let him give not grudgingly or of necessity oh i got to give because you know we got to come up with 385 every time we go to church for god loveth a cheerful giver and god is able to make all grace abound to you i just love that scripture notice where he's putting it in he's putting it in after our sacrifice god is able to make all grace abound to you that ye always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work isn't that wonderful that you have sufficiency to do everything that you want to do every good word god bless you let's stand together we have a monetary offering obligation each and every time we come to church every time the doors are open we don't want to just bring our praises anyone that would see me for the first time and hear this message would question coming to this church but anybody that knows me and wouldn't come to this church afterwards is turning down god's word this is how the prophet taught it this is how a church functions and god is calling us to pay tithes faithfully every week pay your tithes and every time you come to service pay your offerings and make sure you all know how much money you made last year right or if not you're going to be coming up with it for your taxes because the government will demand you to know um you know real quick did you pay that in ties yeah and how much did you pay in offerings just just get serious about it and and don't divide your ties to two or three different places choose your home church pay your tithes make make make your decision and move forward and come come with a burden you know we all can come into the prayer room before service and at least pray god meet the needs of our church the financial needs we pray for one another we should but this is also a need just because i don't come up here and i talk about it every time doesn't mean it's not there but but we have grown up we're mature now we're we're further along and we can take on more oh yeah yeah no you say it um so if you just put cash in there you know i can't record it as anything but a miscellaneous offering so if you want a tax receipt for anything you put in there please mark the envelope we also know how much money is coming in amen yeah it to some degree we don't want to let the right hand know what the left hand is doing we don't want to be given in front of everybody we understand all that but to a degree we we should take advantage of a tax advantage from from our government i mean we should i think i feel unless you got so much money it doesn't matter and that's what cheryl's saying there's no way that she can know how much you gave if you don't let us know it's you that's giving. did you have a testimony i thought you had a testimony you wanted to share when we came to the lord many years ago we were 19. you may sit down just a moment sorry i'm sorry oh that was me so we were young and john made five dollars an hour when we got married and you know we went to church and i would just say this for myself when i heard about this message when god called me he called me by my name he called me an inaudible voice and it changed my life forever never was the same and i was determined to follow him no matter what it took and when we started going to church we heard something we were 19. we just did it i was in i was all in made a decision lord i'm this is what i want this is what i'm gonna do for the rest of my life i didn't question things you know if i have to not cut my hair if i have to we have to pay ties and we make five bucks an hour we're gonna pay ties and we did it right from the get-go and so many times through the years we've gone through some really tough financial times having a business is hard and you know i remember the one time we i didn't even know if we were going to be able to keep our business in our house things were so bad we literally were paying our employees from our credit cards and our home equity we just didn't have work it was terrible it was a terrible time and we pay our taxes twice a year our property taxes and it was coming up it was february we had to have this money by the end of february and we paid our ties faithfully through it through everything we've always paid our ties and it was i had to have this money by friday and i needed five thousand dollars five thousand and some cents and i just knew that i knew that i knew the lord was gonna somehow i was gonna get five thousand dollars before friday and we weren't even taking a paycheck and this was my prayer i said lord i don't want to pay these taxes i don't want to it's not a want it's a need and you promise to supply all of our needs and i said lord i need five thousand dollars and 25 cents or whatever it is by friday and there was just something inside of me that just knew lord is gonna he's gonna do it i don't know how but he's god and he owns everything it's all his and i think it was wednesday it was two days before i got a check in the mail from the state of michigan for five thousand dollars and something they had made a mistake and there's the money that you know it's just like he's supernatural it doesn't matter that you don't have the money to pay your tithes that doesn't matter you still pay them anyways right we took we took that 10 out and then you know decided what else we could pay but you know what i i can testify today look at what the lord has given us and it's because just obeying his word it's hard it's not easy but if you obey it's like he said your barns will be overflowing our barn is overflowing today a lot of i got kicked out my house last year and i just had such peace you know that the lord's gonna provide i didn't know when apartment searching remember two years ago when brother john preached on tithes and offerings um because when i first came to the lord you know came back to the lord i thought you know you just give tithes whenever you know because i didn't know any better but when i was taught that i just like just took it and ran with it because i believed it and i can tell you paying your tithes offerings missionaries lord is going to bless you when i move into my apart before i move into my apartment i had everything i already needed i kid you not and the funny thing was i never asked for anything i would say hey i need this and that and that you know people knew i needed things i didn't have to even i didn't even tell them and i had a couch when i moved in had a dining room table when i moved in had a guest bed when i moved in had another dresser from my guest room and you know that's just the fact of the lord honors faithfulness he doesn't ask for much of you to be faithful be obedient so these ties and offerings they may seem like they're grievous but they're not it's the least we can do what the lord has done for us he literally died upon the cross for every sin that you commit from the day you were born to the day you die we go to go go to rapture so i can say from a testimony the lord will bless you your storehouse overflow like i just look at my department and i just realized how unworthy i am to have all these things it wasn't nothing that i did i just just honor what the lord said to do and i did it and he's going to bless you [Applause] can you come up here praise the lord sister kathleen and she and brother marty have been faithful faithful leaders tithes offerings from the beginning but that was the lord that gave us that revelation it's so the lord that you talked about this tonight because i talked to someone this week about the same thing and i had no idea you were going to talk about that but basically the same scriptures too you know but when i had a similar story sister cheryl said when we got baptized we literally came out of the water knowing we had to pay ties and um i was catholic we didn't pay ties and catholicism you know but when we had decided we were going to send our kids to christian school i was a stay-at-home mom we had a good size mortgage and marty had a good job thank god but our budget was tight and and then to start paying ties on top of it too but we we just made that decision just like brother john said it was the first bill that we paid always for 40 years now it's the first bill and i robbed peter to pay paul the rest of the time with whatever else we had needs of he has always provided but back in 2009 marty lost his job but gm a good job there he's had for many many years and you know our life was on track for retirement for getting our kids through college you know the whole nine yards so he just said called me at work and said i just lost my job i just got walked out the door after 38 years faithful faithful service high ratings the whole nine yards so i closed up my office and i told the girls i'm going home and then we got home and i just said well it doesn't matter we've been faithful god has been faithful and we've he's never let us down anytime so i said we got to sell the house we got to sell the house i don't care you know we'll god will take care of us so within five weeks he had the same job back through ibm you weren't even most you know he worked for gm he was on an account through the same account same people gave us the money gave us more money i mean it was just so the lord gave us better insurance but for five weeks you know we were just not knowing five weeks doesn't seem very very long but we got house payment to make and everything we didn't have our house paid for or anything you know so but you can't out give god you just cannot outgive him and we have been through many financial issues too it's not that you don't have them you will you always have them but god is faithful and he honors faithfulness regardless of what it is and like when brother john was talking about missions and special speakers and all these things you know it doesn't mean you have to pay half of the 360 dollars a month that that and we need you pay your portion everybody does their portion you know when you got more you give more you know that's just the way it is so i'm so grateful to god i was telling someone you know we have this trip coming up next week to florida which we're basically going to for to because of my health they really don't want me in the winter the worst part of the winter and so i can get away for a while that's will be safer for me there's no way we could have afforded to ghost florida for a month there's just no way you know that god probably what people would pay for a week is what we're paying for a whole month and that was just because god's been so faithful to us you know it was just it just worked out where we wouldn't be going so we're retired we live on a retirement budget you know and so um anyways i just wanted to give you that little testimony and encourage you don't let it get overwhelming to you because it doesn't have to be and he will pour out a blessing so much more spiritually too than you could ever think about getting otherwise so i praise the lord that we we did that too just like you guys we were young in the lord and the lord gave us that revelation and it it scared us but we did it you know and he honored it so anyways god bless you well [Applause] a lot of times the lord this is what i want you to do and you may not feel well the revelation is so great that that all the fear is gone that i'm sorry you still got to take the word of god and walk it up really appreciate her sister making mention about you don't got to give you know half of the 385 the thing is coming to church with knowing the need and then pray lord what would you have me to do um i think just too often we've we've honestly over the years we've just gotten so relaxed we just come in don't even think about it here's a little bit whatever but no let's start with praying let's just get concerned about it i know what it's like to be without money to be without a running car what else did we have a job i didn't have a job i know it's like to not have any of that have seven kids that pay your ties of course when you get that first 20 bucks from somewhere pay ties on that 20 bucks you don't wait to get all things caught up brother branham he made sure he owed money he made sure he took his ties out before he paid money on that rocker that's right that's true and he owed for a long time on that rocker you just put god first the first fruits and for some reason god just blesses you because you put him first he blesses you for that amen god bless you let's stand together and close on a word of prayer amen i'm going to ask our brother my brother ferguson amen to dismiss us in prayer yes lord amen yourself
