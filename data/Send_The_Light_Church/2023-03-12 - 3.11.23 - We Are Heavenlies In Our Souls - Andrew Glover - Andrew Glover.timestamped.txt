[37:44] their midst and Lord we're not gathered

[37:48] denomination we're not gathered here
[37:50] tonight in the name of a Creed or a
[37:52] Doctrine but oh God we're gathered here

[38:50] Lord may you bless this congregation
[38:52] here tonight in the name of the Lord
[38:54] Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[38:56] Believers says
[38:58] amen and amen God richly bless you if
[39:01] you have your Bibles this evening we
[39:03] want to turn to the book of Ephesians
[39:05] the first chapter we want to look here
[39:07] in the book of Ephesians the first
[39:08] chapter and I want to look here in the
[39:10] third verse
[39:11] of Ephesians 1 and 3 I I know this is a
[39:15] very familiar reading to you as
[39:17] Believers in the book of Ephesians the
[39:19] first chapter
[39:21] and then the third verse Paul here
[39:23] writing
[39:24] he says blessed be the God and father of
[39:27] our Lord Jesus Christ
[39:30] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[39:33] blessings in Heavenly places
[39:37] in Christ now I love uh the way Paul
[39:40] words this is it's not in the future and
[39:43] it's not just in the present but he said
[39:45] this has been done in the past so in
[39:47] other words you're in time catching up
[39:49] with what he'd done in eternity who hath
[39:52] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[39:55] in Heavenly places in Christ now I want
[39:58] to look at one other verse with you in
[40:00] the book of Hebrews the sixth chapter I
[40:02] know it's a very another very familiar
[40:04] reading to you and we believe as
[40:07] Believers that Paul wrote the book of
[40:09] Hebrews
[40:11] in Hebrews the sixth chapter we want to
[40:13] look here in the 19th verse of Hebrews 6
[40:16] Paul here writing
[40:18] speaking of Eternal hope he says which
[40:22] hope we have as an anchor of the Soul
[40:25] both sure and steadfast and which
[40:28] entereth into that within the veil which
[40:33] hope we have as an anchor of the Soul
[40:36] now Paul didn't say of the body or of
[40:39] the spirit but which hope we have as an
[40:41] anchor of the Soul both sure and
[40:44] steadfast and which entereth into that
[40:47] within the veil amen we ask the Lord
[40:49] this evening to add the blessing to the
[40:51] reading of his word as you can have your
[40:52] seats here this afternoon from those
[40:55] passages of scripture tonight I want to
[40:57] speak to you here and I want to maybe
[40:59] title this tonight that we are
[41:01] heavenlies in our souls we are
[41:04] heavenlies in our souls and I've just
[41:06] been uh studying here some things from
[41:09] the adoption series blood Ram preaches
[41:10] it in 1960 in adoption part one he says
[41:14] in Heavenly places now we're not just
[41:16] out anywhere but we're in Heavenly
[41:18] places see we are assembled in Heavenly
[41:20] it means that's the position of the
[41:24] believer amen the position edition of
[41:26] the believer is Heavenly places that if
[41:29] I'm prayed up and you're prayed up or
[41:31] the church is prayed up he says and
[41:33] we're ready for the message we have
[41:35] assembled ourselves together as Saints
[41:37] we are called out we are baptized with
[41:39] the Holy Ghost we are filled with God's
[41:41] blessings we are called we are elected
[41:44] set together in Heavenly places now he
[41:46] said we are heavenlies in our souls amen
[41:50] amen that's a very powerful statement to
[41:52] me we are heavenlies in our souls he
[41:56] said our Spirits has been brought us
[41:58] into a Heavenly atmosphere what could
[42:00] happen tonight if we would be sitting
[42:03] here in a Heavenly atmosphere the Holy
[42:05] Spirit moving over every heart that's
[42:07] been regenerated and we have become a
[42:10] new creature in Christ Jesus all sins
[42:12] are under the blood Amen in perfect
[42:14] worship with our hands up to God our
[42:17] hearts lifted setting in Heavenly places
[42:19] in Christ Jesus amen worshiping together
[42:22] in the Heavenly places did you did you
[42:24] ever sit in one wife said he said that I
[42:27] would Weep For Joy and say God never let
[42:30] me leave here just Heavenly places in
[42:32] Christ Jesus he said see then he's we're
[42:35] in Heavenly places but we're not just in
[42:37] Heavenly places but we're actually
[42:39] receiving spiritual blessings in those
[42:42] heavenly places he then turns in
[42:44] paragraph 94 and says blessing us with
[42:46] what with Divine Healing amen with
[42:49] foreknowledge and Revelation and visions
[42:51] and powers and tongues interpretation
[42:54] wisdom knowledge all the Heavenly
[42:56] blessings and joy unspeakable and full
[42:59] of Glory every heart is filled with the
[43:01] spirit walking together sitting together
[43:03] amen not one evil fault Among Us not one
[43:06] cigarette smoke not one short dress not
[43:08] one this that or the other amen not one
[43:11] evil fault nobody got anything against
[43:13] one another everybody's speaking in Love
[43:16] In Harmony everybody in One Accord in
[43:19] one place then suddenly there came from
[43:22] Heaven Amen to sound like a Russian
[43:24] Mighty Wind there you are amen he has
[43:26] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[43:29] amen so we now know that the position of
[43:32] the believer is in Heavenly places right
[43:34] amen that as Believers we're in Heavenly
[43:37] places and we are partaking of spiritual
[43:39] blessings now brother Brian list those
[43:41] spiritual blessings as for knowledge and
[43:43] Divine Healing amen visions and powers
[43:46] and tongues amen but tonight I wanna I
[43:49] just want to focus on one of those
[43:50] spiritual blessings and that is
[43:51] revelation amen one of the spiritual
[43:54] blessings to the believer in Heavenly
[43:56] places he said is revelation now when
[44:00] you start looking at this word
[44:01] heavenlies amen you find that the word
[44:03] Heavenly actually means to suggesting
[44:06] amen of the Blessed state of heaven so
[44:08] when you automatically think of the word
[44:10] heavenlies and your heavenlies in your
[44:12] soul amen then you're thinking well in
[44:14] order to be that I've got to go to
[44:16] heaven Amen to be Heavenly amen but I
[44:19] actually believe in the Father's prayer
[44:21] amen when he stood upon the Earth and he
[44:23] said father let thy kingdom come time he
[44:26] said let thy will be done Amen on Earth
[44:28] as it is in heaven Amen in other words
[44:31] he was praying that there would be a
[44:32] people on the Earth amen who would not
[44:35] just be manifesting Humanity amen but
[44:38] they would be manifest in deity amen
[44:40] From Another Dimension listen you're not
[44:42] just upon the Earth manifesting the
[44:44] humanity of 16 elements amen but you're
[44:47] here upon the Earth manifesting amen the
[44:50] deity of Jesus Christ by the baptism of
[44:53] the Holy Ghost in other words I believe
[44:55] amen there's a people on the Earth that
[44:57] does not have to go to heaven amen just
[45:00] to enjoy Heaven amen but they're
[45:02] actually enjoying Heaven on the earth
[45:04] amen by the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:06] listen amen whatever is in heaven is in
[45:09] your soul tonight amen whatever
[45:11] influences influence in your soul amen
[45:14] is the influence of Eternity myth and
[45:16] defend tonight in our souls amen we have
[45:19] passed from Death unto life
[45:21] in our souls we have passed from death
[45:24] and alive and we are heavenlies in our
[45:27] souls now 1961 the prophet has asked the
[45:29] question they say please explain the
[45:32] difference amen between the spirit and
[45:34] the Soul he said well now that's a hard
[45:36] one he said but the first thing is you
[45:38] are a Triune being just like amen father
[45:41] son Holy Ghost see amen there are three
[45:44] titles going to one person and that
[45:47] person is Jesus Christ amen your soul
[45:50] and your body and your spirit amen is
[45:53] going to one person now amen I can see
[45:55] brother John here tonight amen there's
[45:57] one person sitting there amen but
[45:59] there's three titles going to one person
[46:01] amen he's a father he's a husband he's a
[46:04] grandfather he's a pastor amen he's
[46:06] different titles but he's one person
[46:08] amen and he's got a body he's got a
[46:10] spirit and he's got a soul amen you
[46:13] cannot see his soul amen you cannot see
[46:15] his Spirit the only thing you can see is
[46:17] his body amen but if there was no soul
[46:19] there and no spirit amen then you're not
[46:21] seeing John Martin because he's a Triune
[46:24] being amen and listen friends amen don't
[46:26] let the devil water the god head down
[46:28] Amen to two Lords or three Gods amen
[46:31] there is one God and his name is the
[46:33] Lord Jesus Christ and he's the father of
[46:36] Eternity amen he's the mighty conqueror
[46:38] he's the Everlasting father he's the
[46:40] Prince of Peace he's the god which was
[46:43] the gun which he is and the god which
[46:44] shall always be and he's the same
[46:46] yesterday today and forever what he used
[46:49] to do he's still doing and what he's
[46:51] doing here tonight amen he will do it
[46:53] fair amen I feel like preaching here for
[46:55] a second my God is not dead my God is
[46:58] alive he's still a savior he's still a
[47:01] Healer he's still a deliverer he's still
[47:04] a revelation Giver he's still a devil
[47:07] defeater he's still a body changer he's
[47:10] God and he remains to be God listen he's
[47:13] God regardless of the condition of your
[47:15] life he's God regardless of what you're
[47:17] going through he remains God regardless
[47:20] of how hot you are how cold you are how
[47:23] indifferent you are how sick you are
[47:26] he's gone regardless of the condition
[47:28] amen see he is one God he is father son
[47:32] Holy Ghost he said now your soul body
[47:34] and spirit amen but it takes three to
[47:37] make you with just one of them you're
[47:38] not you see it takes three he said this
[47:41] is my hand this is my finger this is my
[47:43] nose this is my eye but who is me he
[47:46] said what's on the inside of me that's
[47:48] the intelligence see this eye this ham
[47:51] this body stands here amen my body could
[47:54] be here but me could be gone amen come
[47:56] on church you've been to enough funerals
[47:58] amen the body is there but the person is
[48:01] gone amen see because whoever I am
[48:04] inside me has gone on he said that's the
[48:07] part that is the spirit he said then the
[48:10] Soul is the nature of the spirit that
[48:12] when the Holy Spirit comes upon you it
[48:15] does not do nothing he said it changes
[48:18] or converts your spirit amen to a
[48:20] different soul amen and that soul is a
[48:23] different nature amen that's on the
[48:25] spirit amen so the the soul is the
[48:27] nature of your spirit listen as he was
[48:30] identifying the real you he was not
[48:32] identifying the real you from the
[48:34] outside in he was identifying the real
[48:37] you from the inside out amen the real
[48:39] you is not your body the real you is not
[48:42] your spirit amen the real you is your
[48:44] soul among church amen I tell you I
[48:47] might as well preach I'm here amen
[48:48] there's three kinds of Believers in
[48:50] every church right amen there's a
[48:52] make-believer there's the unbeliever and
[48:54] then there's the real genuine believer
[48:55] do you realize inside every one of you
[48:58] tonight amen there's three kinds of
[49:00] Believers amen your flesh is an
[49:02] unbeliever your flesh does not believed
[49:04] it will never believe your flesh
[49:06] disagrees with this message amen your
[49:08] flesh your flesh is a hybrid product
[49:10] amen then you go a step further and you
[49:13] got a spirit and that spirit is a
[49:15] make-believer if the music's rise and
[49:17] your favorite preacher's in town and
[49:19] there's no troubles or nothing man your
[49:21] spirit is sword in the heavenlies amen
[49:23] but wake up on Monday morning and
[49:25] receive a bad dream support amen and
[49:27] that Spirit can drop quicker amen than
[49:30] an airplane and a turbulence amen
[49:31] because that spirit is a make-believer
[49:33] amen but inside of that body and inside
[49:36] of that spirit amen there is a soul in
[49:39] there amen and that Soul believes the
[49:42] word amen regardless of the body
[49:44] regardless of the spirit listen you're
[49:46] not serving God by your flesh you're not
[49:48] serving God by your spirit amen you're
[49:51] serving God from your soul amen that's
[49:53] why you're still believing amen because
[49:55] you don't just have the Holy Ghost on
[49:57] your flesh and you don't just have the
[49:59] Holy Ghost in your spirit but the
[50:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost has taken
[50:04] residency in the soul of the believer
[50:06] and you're not just sealed to the next
[50:08] meeting you're not just sealed to the
[50:10] next Youth Camp you are sealed until the
[50:13] day of your Redemption
[50:14] [Applause]
[50:16] hallelujah hallelujah the soul is a
[50:19] different nature that's on the spirit
[50:21] the soul is the nature of your spirit he
[50:24] said first you is evil you is hatred you
[50:27] as mean you had malice in Strife amen
[50:30] but now you're loving now you're sweet
[50:33] and now you're kind he said it's your
[50:35] nature amen it's your soul oh that's
[50:38] been changed amen it's your soul thank
[50:40] you brother it's your soul that has been
[50:43] changed now people take this quote and
[50:44] say well there's two Souls I say they
[50:46] can't read
[50:48] because the prophet said amen the old
[50:51] soul died and the new Soul which is the
[50:54] new nature was born into you see your
[50:57] brain is not your intelligence your
[50:59] spirit that's in you is your
[51:01] intelligence amen your brain is a bunch
[51:03] of matter of sales and so forth it has
[51:05] no intelligence in itself if it did then
[51:08] as long as you laid out there whether
[51:10] you was dead or alive it would still
[51:12] operate but it's not your brain it's
[51:15] your spirit inside of you and your soul
[51:18] is the nature of that Spirit see it's
[51:20] the soul of the spirit that controls the
[51:23] spirit amen that controls the body amen
[51:26] listen the prophet of God said there's a
[51:28] control tower amen one in your flesh and
[51:30] one in your soul he said whichever one
[51:33] is on the control tower of your soul
[51:35] amen will send out a warning signal amen
[51:38] for the needs of the body listen if the
[51:40] devil is on the control tower of your
[51:43] soul then you're going to be mean you're
[51:45] going to be evil you're going to have
[51:46] malice you're going to fulfill strife
[51:48] amen but if Jesus Christ the son of God
[51:51] the person of the word amen is taken the
[51:54] residency of the preeminence of the
[51:56] control tower of your soul amen then
[51:58] it'll control that spirit and it will
[52:00] control that body I love to think how
[52:03] the prophet said amen that a Believer is
[52:05] actually a twofold being he said he is
[52:08] one of the earth to die he said but he
[52:11] is one of the heavenlies to live he said
[52:13] if you've got the holy spirit amen then
[52:15] you are a candidate for association with
[52:18] the Unseen World amen and the
[52:20] supernatural he said see when the Holy
[52:23] Spirit comes into the heart he said then
[52:25] quickly he becomes then a twofold being
[52:28] he is one of the earth to die but he is
[52:31] one of the Heavens to live in his body
[52:34] he is still subject to death but in his
[52:37] soul he is passed from Death unto life
[52:40] amen in his body he has Earthly contact
[52:43] with five senses but in his Spirit what
[52:45] is the spirit it is the nature amen of
[52:48] the Soul he said he has a contact with
[52:51] God through the Holy Ghost and the
[52:53] angels of God visits them and speaks
[52:56] with them and they are messengers sent
[52:58] from God Amen to reveal and to bring
[53:01] messages from God to this individual
[53:03] then there are two worlds right amen
[53:06] there are two worlds there is a scene
[53:08] world and there is an Unseen World amen
[53:11] there is a reverend priesthood twice
[53:12] looking at the Unseen he said there's a
[53:15] scene world there's an Unseen World he
[53:17] said in the things which are seen are
[53:19] temporary but the things which are not
[53:21] seen are Eternal listen if you've got
[53:24] the Holy Ghost Amen in your soul amen
[53:27] you're living on the earth but your
[53:29] fellowship and with Heaven amen you're
[53:31] living on the earth come on your body
[53:33] our bodies are getting weaker our hair
[53:35] is getting thinner or it's disappearing
[53:37] or it's getting grayer amen more
[53:39] wrinkles are appearing amen because in
[53:42] this body we are still subject to death
[53:44] but if the soul of a man has been
[53:47] regenerated it has brought a vision of
[53:50] the supernatural God who can change the
[53:52] body amen from mortality to immortality
[53:55] listen friends amen we need the Holy
[53:57] Ghost now more than we've ever needed it
[53:59] before they say well we write for
[54:01] message amen what do you think the
[54:03] message he is amen the message ain't
[54:05] about to fussing and fighting amen and
[54:07] arguing over quotes amen the message is
[54:09] none other than Jesus Christ and he is
[54:12] the same yesterday today and forever
[54:15] when you receive the Holy Ghost amen
[54:18] there's a contact with God through the
[54:20] Holy Ghost listen I said his pain as I
[54:23] know how we need the leadership of the
[54:25] Holy Ghost we need it more than just on
[54:28] our flesh we need it more than just in
[54:30] our spirit we need the Holy Ghost in our
[54:33] souls brother remember said it very
[54:34] plain he said you could have the baptism
[54:36] of the Holy Ghost every day of your life
[54:37] he said die and be lost and go to hell
[54:40] come on church amen I know that staggers
[54:43] Pentecostals amen but thank God we're
[54:45] not a bunch of suck here tonight amen
[54:47] we're seed who can take the meat of the
[54:49] word and can feed upon that meat and
[54:52] allow that meat to transform us amen
[54:54] from the Earth to Glory
[54:56] put the leadership of the Holy Ghost
[54:58] aside and the church is nothing amen but
[55:01] the world with God's name attached to it
[55:03] seek the world and the church are all of
[55:06] the same lump he said just like Jacob
[55:08] and Esau were amen of the same parents I
[55:11] love this brother but the spirit of God
[55:14] makes the difference
[55:16] the spirit of God makes the difference
[55:19] he said it doesn't matter if you call
[55:21] yourself a Christian anyone can do that
[55:24] amen the point is whether or not amen
[55:27] you have the spirit of God in you no
[55:30] this replacing this in you amen for
[55:32] without the spirit you are a reprobate
[55:35] and you are none of his amen without the
[55:38] spirit of the Holy Ghost you are a
[55:40] reprobate and you are none of his now
[55:42] think of this tonight because the
[55:44] prophet amen tells us that as Christians
[55:46] amen we're in a Warfare and we are
[55:48] actually in a spiritual warfare now the
[55:51] problem of God says it like this he said
[55:53] I'm not a preacher anybody knows that he
[55:55] said but I'm made up in a spiritual form
[55:58] amen of watching things and seeing
[56:01] things move and forewarning people of
[56:03] the things that's coming to pass he said
[56:06] that's my makeup he said I cannot help
[56:08] that no more than you can help yours he
[56:10] said God has put us each one in the body
[56:12] to do certain things he said so I watch
[56:15] every little move every objective every
[56:18] motive amen cause everything is governed
[56:21] by a spirit among everything is governed
[56:24] by a spirit he said that this church
[56:27] amen was put here for a purpose amen
[56:29] there is a spirit behind this church
[56:31] amen there is a spirit behind your home
[56:34] amen behind every building there is a
[56:37] spirit now if you know if you want to if
[56:38] you want to get deep in this for a
[56:39] second we can amen the prophet of God
[56:42] said you go in these Arenas out here and
[56:44] he said you've got to preach for about
[56:45] five nights Amen to finally get the
[56:47] atmosphere right amen because there's
[56:49] been all kinds of spirits in there and
[56:51] he said those Spirits are hanging around
[56:53] Amen in those dimensions in the
[56:56] atmosphere and he said in order to have
[56:58] a gospel meeting you've got to drive the
[57:00] spirits out Amen to welcome the Holy
[57:02] Spirit now come on we can go a little
[57:04] bit deeper can't we hey man how did
[57:06] those Spirits get in there amen those
[57:08] Spirits got in there amen by people who
[57:11] had the devil on the control tower of
[57:14] their soul and they were not looking for
[57:16] the gospel they were looking for a fight
[57:18] they were looking for a theater show
[57:20] they were looking for some filthy
[57:21] something amen and by the control tower
[57:24] being controlled by the devil amen they
[57:26] invited those demons into that building
[57:28] listen them doors couldn't invite them
[57:30] demons them walls couldn't invite them
[57:32] demons amen but Spirits contact spirits
[57:35] well we might as well preach and behind
[57:38] everything there is a spirit
[57:41] he said behind everything there's a
[57:44] spirit there is a motive and there is an
[57:46] objective behind everything there is a
[57:49] spirit there is a motive and there is an
[57:52] objective he said this church comes here
[57:54] Amen to greatly exalt some human system
[57:56] or something then its motive it's not
[57:58] right but if it's put here to try to
[58:01] achieve something for the kingdom of God
[58:03] then the motive and objective both is
[58:05] right if the motive is directed that way
[58:09] but if you can change the direction of
[58:13] the motive you will change the outcome
[58:15] of the situation if you can change the
[58:17] direction amen if the spirit that is
[58:20] governed amen can be changed come on
[58:22] Church it will it will change the whole
[58:24] thing now and then you all know amen
[58:27] that you get to preach on the pulpit and
[58:28] then he gets up and gets to preach him
[58:30] and I know how it is nowadays amen some
[58:32] asked me one time they said what'll kill
[58:34] them eating in about five seconds I said
[58:36] start preaching on sin and you'll lock
[58:38] that thing up tighter and I don't know
[58:39] what amen because we live in an age
[58:42] where nobody wants to be wrong because
[58:44] everybody's rights nothing's wrong
[58:46] anymore bro I mean everything's right
[58:48] you're right I'm right everything's
[58:50] right and what's amazing to me is a lot
[58:51] of times around the message amen
[58:53] everybody's right brother rhyme is wrong
[58:55] amen when I tell you what that is that's
[58:57] a devil amen it's a spirit of Pride I'll
[59:00] tell you what I believe I believe every
[59:01] preacher is wrong every church is wrong
[59:04] and this message is Right amen what a
[59:06] prophet said Israel I don't care what
[59:08] your name is I don't care how long
[59:10] you've been preaching how long you've
[59:11] been teaching if what you're saying is
[59:13] not lining up with what a prophet is
[59:15] already saying amen it's not welcome in
[59:18] the house of God we're not following
[59:20] Babylonian confusion we are following
[59:22] the saith of the Lord and it's
[59:24] Vindicated the saith the Lord It's a
[59:26] scriptural but saithful and it'll lead
[59:28] us out of time into eternity
[59:31] so let's go ahead and clarify this
[59:33] everything's wrong and the message is
[59:35] right
[59:38] the message is right now you say then
[59:40] why does the preacher get up there and
[59:42] preach against television well he ain't
[59:44] preaching against the person that's God
[59:45] and he's preaching against the thing
[59:46] that's motivating it
[59:48] come on Church well but I don't know why
[59:51] these preachers preach against skinny
[59:52] jeans we ain't preaching against the
[59:54] boys wearing them we're preaching
[59:55] against the spirit that Anointed The
[59:58] Pervert in Hollywood to design them to
[1:00:00] put them on our boys to make him look
[1:00:01] like sissies instead of men
[1:00:04] well I don't know why they're preaching
[1:00:06] against girls wearing makeup and then we
[1:00:08] ain't preaching against the girl wearing
[1:00:09] the makeup we're preaching against the
[1:00:11] spirit that God on an immoral woman amen
[1:00:14] through a sex spirit amen to anoint our
[1:00:16] young girls to look like Jezebels rather
[1:00:19] than Daughters of God come on it's still
[1:00:21] right or wrong friends and there's a
[1:00:23] standard and there's a spirit listen we
[1:00:25] don't want to be governed by the spirit
[1:00:26] of the world we want to be led by the
[1:00:29] spirit of Christ because we are
[1:00:31] motivated by a spirit everything we do
[1:00:34] is motivated by spirit
[1:00:37] I'm out every word we say is motivated
[1:00:42] by a spirit the prophet of God said
[1:00:44] whatever your spirit is is what moves
[1:00:46] you amen you are motivated by a spirit
[1:00:49] if the spirit of Jesus Christ is on the
[1:00:52] Christian the believer no wonder he's a
[1:00:55] peculiar person because there's
[1:00:57] something moving in him amen God is in
[1:01:00] him the spirit of Christ is motivating
[1:01:03] him and he has to move as the spirit
[1:01:06] moves him
[1:01:08] could you imagine John the Baptist walk
[1:01:11] down there and say oh well that's all
[1:01:13] right and this is all right amen as long
[1:01:15] as the spirit of Elijah was on him he
[1:01:18] acted like Elijah when you take these
[1:01:21] people that ghost now and starts off and
[1:01:22] says oh I'm going to be a Christian and
[1:01:25] they start off all right amen but the
[1:01:27] first thing in about six months they
[1:01:28] start going back and they start this way
[1:01:30] or that way you can tell right then that
[1:01:33] the anointing is leaving them
[1:01:35] you can tell right then that the
[1:01:38] anointing is leaving them for as long as
[1:01:40] the spirit of Christ is in you it'll
[1:01:43] make you Christ like amen can I say it
[1:01:46] like this amen we need the anointing
[1:01:49] we need Isaiah said the anointing will
[1:01:53] destroy the Yoke of the enemy because of
[1:01:55] the anointing the Yoke shall be
[1:01:57] destroyed amen but can I propose this to
[1:02:00] you amen we cannot just be around the
[1:02:02] anointing and we cannot just let the
[1:02:04] anointing be on us amen but we have got
[1:02:07] to get in the anointing and the
[1:02:09] anointing has got to get into US you say
[1:02:12] then what is the anointing amen Christ
[1:02:14] is the anointing the Bible said If any
[1:02:17] man be in Christ If any man be in the
[1:02:19] anointing he is a new creature all
[1:02:22] things are passed away and behold all
[1:02:24] things shall become new amen Paul says
[1:02:27] again in Colossians 1 whom God would
[1:02:29] make known what is the richest of the
[1:02:30] glory of this mystery among the Gentiles
[1:02:33] which is amen Christ in you the hope of
[1:02:36] glory we can say it like this the
[1:02:38] anointing in you is the hope of glory
[1:02:41] see then to think tonight amen that the
[1:02:44] anointing is Christ and you are the body
[1:02:46] that the headship of Christ has come
[1:02:49] upon he said it's Christ coming to his
[1:02:52] body we all know that the anointing is
[1:02:55] Christ that comes on the word amen that
[1:02:57] makes the word live see Christ is the
[1:03:02] anointing it's the spirit that comes up
[1:03:04] on the word amen that quickens the word
[1:03:07] to make it live now can I ask you this
[1:03:09] question where is the word according to
[1:03:12] a prophet amen the word is in your heart
[1:03:15] amen then what is the heart God in it
[1:03:17] it's got a little compartment amen
[1:03:20] that's called The Soul amen then the
[1:03:22] word is in the heart and the soul of a
[1:03:25] Believer if you believe in Divine
[1:03:27] Healing whatever more amen in Christ the
[1:03:30] anointing come into his body do you see
[1:03:32] the connection there it's just like a
[1:03:34] husband and a wife becoming one the
[1:03:37] church has got to get to the ministry
[1:03:39] until the church and Christ become one
[1:03:41] listen when the church and Christ become
[1:03:44] one he can anoint you amen for every
[1:03:48] blessing that's in the Bible when the
[1:03:50] church in Christ becomes one amen and a
[1:03:53] prophet stood on the earth and said the
[1:03:55] headship is here amen the head is home
[1:03:58] the body amen listen friends we are not
[1:04:01] looking for headship we are in Divine
[1:04:04] possession of the headship of Jesus
[1:04:06] Christ we are not looking for Direction
[1:04:08] when I might as well go and preach we're
[1:04:10] not a headless body we're not a headless
[1:04:13] group of people we are the Bride of
[1:04:15] Jesus Christ who has received the
[1:04:17] headship of Christ we're not following
[1:04:19] commonly devised fables we're not
[1:04:21] following stories and made up things

[1:04:39] I'll dance my shoes off with you I love
[1:04:41] to feel the Holy Ghost amen but I need
[1:04:44] the anointing amen I needed to do more
[1:04:46] than just make me shout I needed to do
[1:04:48] more than just make me speak in tongues

[1:05:37] mystery what does he break it down in a
[1:05:39] three-fold purpose he said the first
[1:05:41] fold is God reveals himself and he said
[1:05:44] the revelation of God is Christ right
[1:05:47] amen he said in the second fold is he
[1:05:49] will take preeminence in a body by the
[1:05:52] revelation of himself he said then the
[1:05:55] third fold is by the revelation of
[1:05:57] himself having preeminence in a body he
[1:06:01] will lead that body back to a Garden of

[1:13:16] crazy man I'm a I'm a witness of the
[1:13:19] presence of Jesus Christ
[1:13:21] he's here now I love the problem that
[1:13:23] God says it like this he said the whole
[1:13:25] secret was the revelation
[1:13:28] there's where the trouble is people
[1:13:30] don't understand that the whole Church
[1:13:32] of the Living God is built upon a
[1:13:35] spiritual revelation of Christ amen
[1:13:37] Matthew 16 right Upon This Rock I will
[1:13:41] build my church and the Gates of Hell
[1:13:43] will never Prevail against it and he
[1:13:45] said he is the word John 1 1 3 right
[1:13:47] John 1 14 and when that word comes into
[1:13:51] you
[1:13:52] now we're bringing it on are we when
[1:13:54] that word comes into you he said it's
[1:13:57] sharper than a two-edged sword it
[1:14:00] discerns the faults and the intents of
[1:14:02] the heart he said there's the word
[1:14:05] coming in there's the word coming in
[1:14:08] when the revelation of every word of God
[1:14:11] is true can I say that to you the way

[1:14:16] every word of God is true

[1:14:57] Revelation in other words the prophet is
[1:15:00] telling you the word of God coming in
[1:15:02] the church is not just in book form it's
[1:15:06] not just in letter form but what's
[1:15:08] coming into the church in the age you're
[1:15:10] living in is the revelation of the book

[1:15:15] of the scriptures you've been listen
[1:15:16] Church there's people carrying the same
[1:15:19] Bible you're carrying they're reading
[1:15:21] the same scriptures you're reading amen

[1:15:26] it destroyed them they're no longer
[1:15:28] serving God some of them are atheists

[1:15:34] Saturday afternoon amen with your hands
[1:15:37] raised to God with an amen in your soul
[1:15:39] and you're still believing the word you

[1:16:10] now we go into Hebrews 6 19 again and
[1:16:12] Paul says it very beautiful brother John
[1:16:14] I love how he says it he said which hope
[1:16:17] we have
[1:16:19] not which hope we're trying to get
[1:16:22] but which hope we have as an anchor of
[1:16:25] the Soul it's brochure and steadfast and
[1:16:29] which entereth into that within the veil
[1:16:31] now look at this word Soul it is the
[1:16:34] breath of life it is the vital force
[1:16:37] which animates the body and shows itself
[1:16:40] in breathing
[1:16:42] the soul it says the Breath of Life the
[1:16:45] vital force which animates the body and
[1:16:48] shows itself in breathing look at this
[1:16:50] next definition the soul is the seed of
[1:16:53] the feelings the desires the affections
[1:16:57] the aversions our heart our soul look at
[1:17:00] this next definition the soul the human
[1:17:02] soul and so far as it is constituted by
[1:17:05] that right use of the age offered it by
[1:17:08] God it can attain its highest end and
[1:17:12] can secure
[1:17:13] eternal blessedness
[1:17:16] amen your soul is the only thing that
[1:17:20] can attain the heights of God
[1:17:23] your soul is the only thing that can
[1:17:25] attain the depths of the love of God
[1:17:27] your soul is the only thing that can
[1:17:30] attain the things that God has to offer
[1:17:33] you as a human Amen to change your view
[1:17:35] to change your focus to change your life
[1:17:38] is the soul is the only thing that can
[1:17:40] receive it and when that Soul receives
[1:17:42] those things that is offered by God it
[1:17:44] will actually secure
[1:17:46] Eternal blessedness I love this one the
[1:17:49] soul as an Essence which differs from
[1:17:52] the body listen and is not dissolved by
[1:17:55] Death
[1:17:56] yeah
[1:17:58] the soul which is distinguished from the
[1:18:01] body amen and is not dissolved by death
[1:18:04] it is distinguished from other parts of
[1:18:07] the body
[1:18:08] glory to God come on Church your body
[1:18:11] amen listen your body can become
[1:18:14] paralyzed but your soul can't
[1:18:17] your body can get cancer but your soul
[1:18:19] can't come on Church your body can go
[1:18:22] blind your body can go deaf your body
[1:18:24] can go down let your soul can't amen
[1:18:27] because the soul amen has passed from
[1:18:29] the ability to be touched amen by the
[1:18:32] ailments of humanity into a dimension
[1:18:34] with God
[1:18:36] come on church if you got the holy ghost
[1:18:38] in your soul you'll ought to be the
[1:18:40] happiest person in Flint Michigan
[1:18:41] tonight if you've got the Holy Ghost and
[1:18:44] you know come on friend what are you
[1:18:46] feeling right now I'll tell you what
[1:18:47] you're feeling you feel a little tug in
[1:18:49] your heart can I tell you what that is
[1:18:51] that's not the personality of a Preacher
[1:18:53] that's not the words of your favorite
[1:18:55] preacher amen that is a witness from the
[1:18:58] Eternal Dimension that whatever is in
[1:19:00] heaven is in your soul by the baptism of
[1:19:03] the Holy Ghost then I can get on the
[1:19:05] page with William Branham tonight and
[1:19:07] say you can no more die than God can
[1:19:15] I think it's time to start eating these
[1:19:18] things I think it's time to start
[1:19:20] feeding on these Revelations it's the
[1:19:22] only anchor of the Soul
[1:19:24] it's distinguished from other parts of
[1:19:26] the body now amen I got to reading the
[1:19:28] other day studying and I come across
[1:19:30] Hebrews 6 19. I I normally don't study
[1:19:33] uh different translations of the Bible
[1:19:34] but this one really stood out to me from
[1:19:36] the Amplified Bible it says this hope
[1:19:39] this confidence Assurance which we have
[1:19:42] as an anchor of the soul I love this
[1:19:45] part it cannot slip and it cannot break
[1:19:48] down under whatever pressure Bears upon
[1:19:52] it
[1:19:54] this hope we have amen is a confident
[1:19:58] assurance
[1:20:02] and the confidence Assurance is the
[1:20:05] anchor of the Soul
[1:20:06] and it cannot slip
[1:20:08] and it cannot break down under whatever
[1:20:11] pressure Bears upon it it is a safe and
[1:20:15] steadfast hope that enters within the
[1:20:18] veil I love this one of the Heavenly
[1:20:21] Temple the most holy place in which the
[1:20:24] very presence of God dwells amen is
[1:20:28] where the anchor of the soul is hooked
[1:20:30] to then there's a connection between the
[1:20:33] soul the anchor and the presence of God
[1:20:35] listen friends the problem of God said a
[1:20:37] man under pressure is what he is when
[1:20:40] he's under pressure his real true
[1:20:42] characteristics will show when he's
[1:20:44] under pressure get him all riled up and
[1:20:47] all stirred up and then you'll see the
[1:20:49] real man come out if he's got a temper
[1:20:51] it'll show itself if he's Meek in gentle
[1:20:54] it'll sow itself amen but put him under
[1:20:56] pressure once and God puts all of his
[1:20:59] children in a test to see whether
[1:21:01] there's any flaws in them now can
[1:21:03] anybody agree with me that everybody is
[1:21:05] under pressure
[1:21:08] well six of you are there must be
[1:21:10] something good in the water up here
[1:21:12] we're gonna take some back home
[1:21:14] everybody's under pressure he said see
[1:21:17] it's a neurotic age everybody is all
[1:21:19] built up haven't got no time that builds
[1:21:22] up to a place amen that it breaks up
[1:21:23] things it causes people to have hard
[1:21:25] feelings when they snap off and say
[1:21:27] things they don't mean to say see
[1:21:29] everybody is guilty of it I'm guilty of
[1:21:31] it you're all guilty we do things under
[1:21:33] pressure that we wouldn't do otherwise
[1:21:36] he said see there's an excess pressure
[1:21:38] built up today and before I go any
[1:21:40] further I might say this I believe it's
[1:21:43] the enemy coming down and pressing he
[1:21:45] said I believe it's the devil he said
[1:21:48] because we know the coming of the Lord
[1:21:50] is at hand the Bible said in the last
[1:21:52] days the devil would go about like a
[1:21:54] roaring lion and if he now listen church
[1:21:56] if he could get you under pressure amen
[1:21:59] hurry and running amen over something
[1:22:01] you will make decisions you would make
[1:22:03] if you would sit down and think it over
[1:22:06] then let me ask you this
[1:22:08] oh according to Paul can receive as much
[1:22:11] pressure as you can put on it but it
[1:22:13] will never break down
[1:22:16] can I ask you this where is the pressure
[1:22:19] coming from that's coming upon your soul
[1:22:21] I'll tell you where it's coming from
[1:22:23] it's coming from your body and it's
[1:22:25] coming from your spirit your body and
[1:22:27] your spirit will actually join together
[1:22:28] and we'll put pressure upon the real you
[1:22:31] which is your soul you know why because
[1:22:33] pressure is an influencer come on Church
[1:22:36] you let pressure come into church it'll
[1:22:38] influence decisions it'll influence the
[1:22:40] way things are conducted amen pressure
[1:22:42] is an influencer and pressure from your
[1:22:45] body and pressure from your spirit amen
[1:22:48] will try to influence your soul but love
[1:22:50] I love what the prophet said he said
[1:22:52] listen the soul amen is anchored and
[1:22:55] it's not waved about with every Doctrine
[1:22:57] and everyone tossed about from one to
[1:22:59] another amen it don't take sides over
[1:23:01] here and take sides over there and don't
[1:23:04] know where it stands amen the soul is
[1:23:06] established the soul takes sides with
[1:23:09] the word
[1:23:11] the soul of a Believer takes sides with
[1:23:14] the word of God listen friends amen your
[1:23:16] body will take sides against you your
[1:23:18] spirit will take signs against you amen
[1:23:20] but your soul will take sides with the
[1:23:23] word
[1:23:26] now you know I'm telling you the truth
[1:23:27] your soul will take sides with the word
[1:23:30] you know what I'm talking about it's
[1:23:32] Saturday or maybe we'll go to a
[1:23:33] Wednesday okay amen cause it's always
[1:23:35] harder to get to church on Wednesdays
[1:23:37] ain't it I mean you know you have a good
[1:23:39] Monday good Tuesday if anything's going
[1:23:41] to fall apart it'll fall apart on
[1:23:42] Wednesday right amen now watch amen it's
[1:23:45] a devil trying to influence the real you
[1:23:48] because the real you take sides with
[1:23:51] Hebrews the 10th chapter and the 25th
[1:23:53] verse when the Bible said forsake not
[1:23:55] the assembling of yourselves together
[1:23:56] then listen friends it's not your body
[1:23:59] amen that believes that your body tells
[1:24:02] you you're too tired to go to church
[1:24:05] your body tells you you worked all day
[1:24:08] you're physically wore out and as soon
[1:24:10] as you go in there and you sit down amen
[1:24:13] that crazy song leader is going to get
[1:24:15] up and he's going to be all on fire and
[1:24:17] he's going to be singing the joys of God
[1:24:19] and he's going to say come on Church
[1:24:21] let's sing Come On Church raise your
[1:24:23] hands give God a hand clap of praise and
[1:24:26] you know your body's wore out and you
[1:24:28] just need to stay home and kick your
[1:24:30] feet up and get your cold iced tea and
[1:24:33] get you some ice cream and hopefully the
[1:24:35] live streaming Link Works
[1:24:39] that's your body that says that but your
[1:24:42] soul in there says without your feet I
[1:24:44] can't get there
[1:24:46] without your feet I can't without your
[1:24:49] hands to steer the car I can't get there
[1:24:51] and your soul says I'm going to church
[1:24:55] so your soul amen will actually bring
[1:24:58] your body under the influence of your
[1:25:00] soul and will say I'm going to church
[1:25:01] and your body will say okay I'll get you
[1:25:04] there but when you get in there you
[1:25:06] ain't using my feet to stand up on and
[1:25:08] you ain't use it come you know what I'm
[1:25:10] talking about brother John amen that
[1:25:11] body will say on Wednesday you ain't
[1:25:13] using my voice to preach you ain't using
[1:25:15] my eyes to read amen you ain't using my
[1:25:18] hands to study amen but you get in here
[1:25:21] amen and you and before long because
[1:25:23] your soul is already in the heavenlies
[1:25:26] amen those hands that wasn't going to
[1:25:28] raise they begin to raise and those
[1:25:31] hands that wasn't going to clap they
[1:25:33] begin to clap and those feet that wasn't
[1:25:35] going to stand up they begin to stand up
[1:25:37] you know what happened your soul amen
[1:25:40] brought your body and their subjection
[1:25:42] to the word and your soul took sides
[1:25:44] with the word and made your body obey
[1:25:48] now can we go a step further your spirit
[1:25:51] your body okay now you got your body
[1:25:54] moving but now your spirit says don't
[1:25:56] nobody love you down there to church
[1:25:59] if you didn't go tonight what nobody
[1:26:01] miss you they never call and check on
[1:26:03] you anyhow so you might as well stay
[1:26:05] home I mean what do you even why are you
[1:26:07] even trying to go for do you see how
[1:26:08] brother so-and-so looked at you did you
[1:26:10] see brother Dan preaching the other
[1:26:12] night did you see him look right at you
[1:26:13] can I just ask y'all a question where
[1:26:16] are preachers supposed to look
[1:26:18] okay
[1:26:20] come on well he looked at me well he
[1:26:22] looked where are where are we supposed
[1:26:24] to look for ceiling I'm in the floor we
[1:26:26] gotta look at peoples we're preaching to
[1:26:29] me but the devil will get in that spirit
[1:26:31] and through the five senses of the Elder
[1:26:33] and inner man he will begin to try to
[1:26:35] influence the service amen by your
[1:26:37] spirit amen but the problem of God said
[1:26:40] your soul will take signs with the word
[1:26:43] now listen to this he said Your Soul Is
[1:26:45] Anchored to Christ Jesus and you're born
[1:26:47] again the life of God is living in you
[1:26:49] and you know beyond any shadow of a
[1:26:52] doubt that you have passed from Death In
[1:26:54] The Life your whole hope is built Yonder
[1:26:56] and Calvary and the love of God pours
[1:26:59] through your heart
[1:27:02] you believe every word that God says is
[1:27:05] the truth he said now listen you're
[1:27:07] willing to die for any phase of it
[1:27:12] you're willing to die for any phase of
[1:27:15] it then let me ask you this what is the
[1:27:18] anchor of the soul the prophet said you
[1:27:20] sell out the world and the things of the
[1:27:22] world
[1:27:24] and everything that pertains to anything
[1:27:26] else to have this that's right put your
[1:27:29] whole anchor right on that it's the
[1:27:32] anchor now listen this is powerful it's
[1:27:35] the anchor of the soul to see his
[1:27:37] revelation of his word
[1:27:40] then the anchor of the soul is the
[1:27:43] ability to see the revelation of his
[1:27:45] word when you can see the revelation of
[1:27:48] his word you have received the anchor of
[1:27:50] the Soul come on church and what is the
[1:27:54] revelation of the age it's the personal
[1:27:56] presence of the Divine one in the midst
[1:27:59] of the church I say tonight hang your
[1:28:02] soul on any phase of the revelation of
[1:28:05] the word people say well we've got the
[1:28:07] Bible that's all we need amen and them
[1:28:10] same people will say we don't need to
[1:28:12] read brother Branham we've got our
[1:28:13] Bibles and them same guys will read Dr
[1:28:16] Dobson they'll read Max Lucado they'll
[1:28:18] quote Billy Graham they'll study Oral
[1:28:20] Roberts amen because there's no anchor
[1:28:22] in those words come on church I might as
[1:28:24] well preach we are not following a man
[1:28:27] we are following the tide ends foreign
[1:28:33] they say well I can tell you're one of
[1:28:36] them tapeworms and they actually mean it
[1:28:37] to me to be an offense but actually take
[1:28:40] it as a compliment
[1:28:42] they say I can see that you're on them
[1:28:44] tapeworms I remember one time I was
[1:28:45] preaching the guy coming up to me he
[1:28:46] said well all I can see is you read
[1:28:48] brother random I said well you actually
[1:28:49] can see pretty good
[1:28:53] I said because I'm reading a Vindicated
[1:28:56] voice well brother Andrew I think we
[1:28:58] need to go read Luther I think we need
[1:29:00] to go read Wesley do you not realize
[1:29:01] when you're reading this message you're
[1:29:03] reading Matthew Henry you're reading
[1:29:06] Clark you're reading come on Church
[1:29:08] you're reading Luther because a prophet
[1:29:10] is not the bringer of something new he
[1:29:13] is the revealer of the word and when a
[1:29:16] Prophet come in this age he sang through
[1:29:18] Matthew Henry oh can I preach can I
[1:29:21] preach he went through Clark he went
[1:29:24] through those commentaries and said this
[1:29:26] is truth and that's not then the message
[1:29:28] of the hour has filtered out everything
[1:29:31] that's not truth and has restored the
[1:29:33] truth from those voices Amen to the
[1:29:36] bride listen friends it's time to quit
[1:29:38] saying whatever denominational hiring is
[1:29:41] saying and say what the voice of
[1:29:43] Revelation is said in the AIDS that
[1:29:45] you're living in
[1:29:46] I remember one time I just feel good
[1:29:49] here right now I know one time brother
[1:29:51] guy told me he said well do you realize
[1:29:52] when you realize what he's kind of funny
[1:29:54] how I said he said Do You Realize one
[1:29:56] day you're going to realize that brother
[1:29:57] Brandon ran other men
[1:30:00] I said really he said yeah he said and
[1:30:03] you didn't know that I said actually I

[1:30:16] what brother Brandon I said you ain't
[1:30:17] did it's in Daniel 70 weeks his opening
[1:30:19] comments I've been reading through all
[1:30:21] these commentaries looking for Daniel 70
[1:30:23] weeks and he said I couldn't find it
[1:30:25] there
[1:30:27] come on he told us he studied amen
[1:30:30] listen friends this message is not some
[1:30:31] plagiarism I'll tell you who the
[1:30:33] plagiarizers are or the cowards just
[1:30:36] walked away from this truth and won't
[1:30:38] stand behind the pulpit and say they're
[1:30:39] still saying what a Vindicated Prophet
[1:30:41] said
[1:30:42] well it's the truth anyhow but we're
[1:30:45] going to hang our soul on the revelation
[1:30:47] of the word in the age we're living in
[1:30:49] listen friends when you hear his voice
[1:30:51] speak to you the prophet said hang your
[1:30:54] soul Amen on the voice of the word
[1:30:56] that's speaking to you he said I'm the
[1:30:58] Lord that healeth thee come on church I
[1:31:00] know that's a scripture in the Bible but
[1:31:02] we got 1100 books and tapes that breaks
[1:31:05] down every aspect of I am the Lord that
[1:31:08] healeth thee I'm the Lord that giveth
[1:31:10] the eternal life I love thee I Know Thee
[1:31:13] before the foundation of the world I put
[1:31:14] thy name upon the book Thou Art mine
[1:31:17] fear not it's me do not be afraid I am
[1:31:21] with you
[1:31:24] amen
[1:31:24] amen so we believe in the Bible being
[1:31:27] the full Revelation am I going too long
[1:31:30] the full revelation of Jesus Christ so
[1:31:34] we believe that the word this Bible is
[1:31:36] the word of God direct quote and
[1:31:38] therefore you can hang your soul upon
[1:31:41] any phase of it
[1:31:44] now what did Paul say I'm going to give
[1:31:46] you some scriptures here in first
[1:31:47] Thessalonians 5 23 he says the very God
[1:31:49] of Peace sanctify you holy I pray God
[1:31:52] your whole Spirit soul and body be
[1:31:54] preserved blameless unto the coming of
[1:31:57] our Lord Jesus Christ for faithful is he
[1:32:00] that calleth you who also will do it
[1:32:03] Romans 8 11 if the spirit of him that
[1:32:06] raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in
[1:32:08] you he that raised up Christ from the
[1:32:11] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[1:32:13] bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in
[1:32:15] you therefore brethren we are debtors
[1:32:18] amen not to the flesh to live after the
[1:32:21] flesh for if you live out the flesh you
[1:32:24] shall die but if ye through the spirit
[1:32:26] do mortify the Deeds of the body ye
[1:32:31] shall live if from your soul amen
[1:32:34] controls the spirit and from the spirit
[1:32:36] you mortify the Deeds of the body ye
[1:32:39] shall live what is he speaking of he is
[1:32:41] speaking of the quickening power the
[1:32:44] problem God said if Christ is raised
[1:32:46] Jesus from the dead and dwells in you it
[1:32:48] will Quicken make alive your mortal
[1:32:50] bodies because it's already life
[1:32:54] and when it comes into your body say
[1:32:57] somebody say with me when it comes into
[1:32:58] your body
[1:33:00] it brings your whole body subject to it
[1:33:03] he said subject to what amen the word of
[1:33:06] God when the quickening power which is
[1:33:09] the spirit of God by revelation of God
[1:33:12] comes into the soul of a Believer amen
[1:33:15] it will bring the whole body subject to
[1:33:17] it if it's in you listen friends he's
[1:33:20] the god that could create bread he's the
[1:33:22] god that created the winds and waves he
[1:33:24] is not just part God he is all God so
[1:33:27] let us remember I'm tying this together
[1:33:29] now okay he also created our bodies and
[1:33:33] won't our bodies have to obey him
[1:33:36] come on church if the creator of the
[1:33:39] body is on the control tower of the Soul
[1:33:42] amen then the body will have to control
[1:33:44] have to obey the control tower which is
[1:33:47] where the house of the Creator is he
[1:33:49] said you've got to surrender your
[1:33:50] thoughts you've got to surrender your
[1:33:52] life your faith to him and watch that
[1:33:54] body obey what he says if you're a
[1:33:57] drunkard and you can't quit drinking
[1:33:58] then surrender that life to him and
[1:34:02] you'll drink no more if you're a
[1:34:04] habitual smoker and you tried to give it
[1:34:06] up and you can't do it Just Surrender
[1:34:08] that to him and Watch What Happens he'll
[1:34:11] make that body come back in subjection
[1:34:14] to that word
[1:34:17] come on Church he'll make that body come
[1:34:21] back into subjection that word yes sir
[1:34:23] but you got to surrender it to him
[1:34:25] you've got to believe he made our bodies
[1:34:27] that obey his will also amen if you're a
[1:34:30] Christian you have to well you say but
[1:34:32] brother Bradham he makes our bodies obey
[1:34:34] oh I believe we have jurisdiction over
[1:34:37] that then you're not fully surrendered
[1:34:40] if you think you're still in control of
[1:34:42] your body then you're not fully
[1:34:45] surrendered
[1:34:47] I'm preaching to you to the Creator that
[1:34:50] controls your body by the voice of his
[1:34:52] word y'all remember the story I know I
[1:34:54] know some of you heard brother hibiscus
[1:34:56] testimony I heard it one time it really
[1:34:58] stood out to me but they had said like
[1:34:59] this she said we was out there hunting
[1:35:00] with brother Brandon one time he said
[1:35:02] while he was out there hunting he said
[1:35:04] there was a guy he said he was a ruffle
[1:35:05] Feller and he said he told us she said
[1:35:07] I'm gonna go down here over the over the
[1:35:09] bank down here he said a long ways away
[1:35:11] from Brother Bear and brother Ed he said
[1:35:13] I got down there or that guy got down
[1:35:15] there he said I was up here brother
[1:35:16] brother Branham he said and that guy got
[1:35:18] down there and the only reason he went
[1:35:19] down there was to smoke a cigarette
[1:35:22] so he went down there lit him up y'all
[1:35:24] heard it went down there lit him up a
[1:35:26] cigarette and brother Ed said brother
[1:35:28] ma'am hollered over there and said I
[1:35:29] can't remember the guy's name right now
[1:35:30] he he's what was it
[1:35:33] but but Suffolk that's right he said hey
[1:35:36] uh he said bud when did you quit smoking
[1:35:38] he said just now
[1:35:42] I'm on Church of prophet didn't see him
[1:35:44] life a cigarette I'll go a step further
[1:35:46] and say brother Ram didn't even smell
[1:35:48] the smoke amen but a word and a soul of
[1:35:50] a Believer is a discerner of what's
[1:35:53] going on around the camp come on church
[1:35:55] and when that word was spoken amen Bud's
[1:35:58] body had to come subject Amen to the
[1:36:00] word of God to rebuke that demon of
[1:36:02] nicotine what can I tell you this
[1:36:04] tonight in closing that same God is in
[1:36:07] this building tonight and he will bring
[1:36:09] your body under subjection to the same
[1:36:11] word
[1:36:13] oh yeah remember brother M talks about
[1:36:15] the Indian chief he said some time ago
[1:36:18] he told me said since me received the
[1:36:19] Holy Ghost there's been two dogs in me
[1:36:21] he said one of them's a black dog and
[1:36:23] one of them's a white dog they argue all
[1:36:25] the time they growl fight at one another
[1:36:27] said the white dog wants me to do good
[1:36:28] and the black dog wants me to do bad I
[1:36:31] said well Chief which one wins the fight
[1:36:33] he said well depends on which one Chief
[1:36:35] feeds the most so I think that's a good
[1:36:38] answer that's just depends on the
[1:36:40] warring of the body that's in you it
[1:36:42] depends on which one you cater to which
[1:36:45] nature you cater to the carnal nature
[1:36:47] after the things of the world or the
[1:36:50] spiritual nature after the things of God
[1:36:54] now we've all heard it said I know you
[1:36:57] preached it brother John that our bodies
[1:36:59] come subject to the word right amen I
[1:37:01] was praying the other day and while I
[1:37:03] was praying the Lord just began to deal
[1:37:04] with my heart and I asked the Lord a
[1:37:06] question I said Lord I said how do our
[1:37:08] bodies come subject to the word what
[1:37:12] what what is the formula what what is
[1:37:14] the what is the atmosphere that we get
[1:37:16] into you know is it when we get in a
[1:37:17] good meeting and man the music's going
[1:37:19] good and the words being preached man we
[1:37:21] feel the chart what what what do we do
[1:37:23] how does our bodies come substitute now
[1:37:26] I'm a firm believer that if you've got a
[1:37:28] question just keep listening to brother
[1:37:29] Branham and before long your question
[1:37:31] will turn into an answer and it did for
[1:37:33] me he said we are carnal and that part
[1:37:36] must perish the carnal part must perish
[1:37:38] but the inside we are a spirit man and
[1:37:42] the Soul inside he said that's faith in
[1:37:45] God's word
[1:37:46] okay then we bring our outside body
[1:37:49] under subjection to the word by faith
[1:37:54] by accepting what God Said
[1:38:01] pretty simple isn't it but it's a power
[1:38:04] packed revelation we bring our body
[1:38:07] under subjection to the word by Faith by
[1:38:10] accepting what God said listen if you're
[1:38:13] sick right now you can accept what God
[1:38:16] Said read it in the word by faith and
[1:38:18] your body will have to come subject
[1:38:22] your body will have to come subject amen
[1:38:25] just by you accepting what God Said
[1:38:27] now you all know the story it's a very
[1:38:29] it's a very powerful Story the prophet
[1:38:32] of God says it like this he said there
[1:38:33] was a little girl down there named
[1:38:35] Georgia Carter
[1:38:36] he said she now do you all know Georgia
[1:38:38] Carter how she got in that condition
[1:38:41] she got in that condition of
[1:38:42] tuberculosis as a little girl by an
[1:38:45] uncle who was taking her to piano
[1:38:46] lessons piano lessons and he raped her
[1:38:49] on the way to piano lessons and when he
[1:38:51] raped her amen he took advantage of the
[1:38:53] girl and it give her body TB so a little
[1:38:56] girl was a victim of a filthy uncle and
[1:38:59] she was laying in a bed for nine years
[1:39:01] and eight months and she didn't even do
[1:39:04] anything herself to put her in that
[1:39:06] condition
[1:39:08] you ever thought about that she had
[1:39:10] every reason to be angry she had every
[1:39:12] reason to be mad but she was in there
[1:39:15] and she was believing for a miracle
[1:39:18] now can we can we preach this she was
[1:39:20] believing for a miracle laying in a bed
[1:39:23] in a tuberculosis case with an uncle
[1:39:25] abusion or can I go a step further her
[1:39:28] home was not even a Heavenly atmosphere
[1:39:32] you say how can you prove that because
[1:39:34] according to the prophet when it was
[1:39:36] time for him to go by there her mother
[1:39:37] was over at the window praying that God
[1:39:40] would not let that imposter come by her
[1:39:42] house because she had already got her
[1:39:44] daughter all worked up so there was
[1:39:46] nobody in there singing songs with
[1:39:48] Georgia Carter to create an atmosphere
[1:39:51] Amen to welcome a miracle in the room
[1:39:53] but a prophet was out in the woods
[1:39:55] praying and while he was out there
[1:39:57] praying he heard behind in the back of a
[1:40:00] little sheep and that bass said go by
[1:40:03] the way of Carter's he said I got up and
[1:40:06] I took off running down there he said I
[1:40:08] ran right into the Carter's house now
[1:40:10] let me let me let me let me preach this
[1:40:12] to you because just as you are a Triune
[1:40:15] being Georgia Carter was a trying being
[1:40:17] she had a body she had a spirit and she
[1:40:20] had a soul her body was in a terrible
[1:40:22] condition her body was tuberculosis
[1:40:25] stricken her body was in that condition
[1:40:27] amen I don't think her body was in a
[1:40:29] strong condition she hadn't walked in
[1:40:31] nine years and eight months she hadn't
[1:40:33] been able to do what everybody else was
[1:40:34] doing her body was in a horrible
[1:40:36] condition can we go a step further her
[1:40:39] spirit no doubt was a roller coaster one
[1:40:41] day she was up one day she was down one
[1:40:44] day it's today I don't know if I'll ever
[1:40:46] get out of this bed her spirit was a
[1:40:48] make-believer amen but in her soul
[1:40:52] in her soul she believed the word of God
[1:40:55] and the prophet of God said it like this
[1:40:57] he said when you can when you can let
[1:41:00] your faith loose to God's spirit it will
[1:41:02] bring your body in subjection to God's
[1:41:06] Redemptive blessing to you
[1:41:10] you realize the prophet of God shows you
[1:41:12] that his ministry amen was not
[1:41:14] necessarily the ministry of land on of
[1:41:15] hands I'm not I've not left Georgia so
[1:41:17] stay with me
[1:41:18] his ministry he said was not necessarily
[1:41:21] the ministry of land on of hands he said
[1:41:23] that's a Jewish sign but you know Jairus
[1:41:26] said come lay your hands on my daughter
[1:41:27] shall live but for Roman Centurion said
[1:41:31] just speak the word
[1:41:34] he said see that's all the Gentiles just
[1:41:36] say the word so Jesus turned and said I
[1:41:39] have found Faith Like That not in Israel
[1:41:41] see just speak the word because what
[1:41:44] happened now bear this in mind the Roman
[1:41:48] knew that every sickness and disease was
[1:41:51] subject to his word
[1:41:54] the Roman Centurion brother knew that
[1:41:57] every disease every sickness was
[1:41:59] substitute his word now if you can
[1:42:01] realize the same it's all over see when
[1:42:05] you can realize the same that every
[1:42:07] demon somebody help me every demon
[1:42:10] every sickness every disease every
[1:42:14] Affliction is subject to the word of God
[1:42:18] every demon ever sickness every
[1:42:21] Affliction ever spirit is subject to the
[1:42:25] word of God he said see when the Roman
[1:42:27] Centurion recognized that his word was
[1:42:30] sufficient he said the demon that was
[1:42:32] over his child amen lost the effect over
[1:42:35] that child come on church and when
[1:42:37] William Branham walked in Georgia
[1:42:38] Carter's house he looked right at her
[1:42:41] her body was in a terrible condition her
[1:42:44] spirit was against her but her soul
[1:42:46] believed I'll get up out of this bed and
[1:42:48] I'll walk again and he said Georgia in
[1:42:51] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ rise
[1:42:53] up out of that bed and walk and a little
[1:42:55] girl who hadn't walked in nine years and
[1:42:57] eight months stood up on their feet and
[1:43:00] the prophet said she took off running
[1:43:03] are you hearing me I might as well
[1:43:05] preach it to you amen she took off
[1:43:07] running he said when she got out there
[1:43:09] he said she blessed the grass
[1:43:13] he said she blessed the trees
[1:43:16] you know what else I love he said she
[1:43:18] turned and went over and started playing
[1:43:20] the piano
[1:43:23] for nine years and eight months she had
[1:43:26] not had a piano lesson oh God she had
[1:43:30] not had a piano lesson in nine years and
[1:43:32] eight months but when the word okay when
[1:43:35] the word come under the influence of the
[1:43:38] anointing that was in her soul it
[1:43:40] released the ability to go over and play
[1:43:42] the piano again can I go a step further
[1:43:44] brother rammstead and today she's my
[1:43:47] piano player at the Milltown Baptist
[1:43:49] Church do you realize when Georgia
[1:43:51] Carter was healed the Milltown Baptist
[1:43:54] Church was shut down but when Georgia
[1:43:56] received her miracle that Miracle opened
[1:43:58] up an entire church amen by the
[1:44:01] manifestation of the anointing of the
[1:44:03] word I'm on church I come to tell you
[1:44:05] get up out of that bed it's time to walk
[1:44:08] again it's time to believe again it's
[1:44:11] time to pursue the things of God again
[1:44:14] hello that Roman Center and I'm gonna
[1:44:16] close with this that Roman Centurion
[1:44:18] knew the word
[1:44:20] he knew the word was true so he
[1:44:22] confessed I love this brother he
[1:44:24] confessed the word to the word
[1:44:31] he confessed the word to the word
[1:44:34] he said if you'll just speak the word
[1:44:37] my daughter will be healed
[1:44:40] if you'll just speak the word word if
[1:44:42] you'll just speak the word
[1:44:47] he was in the presence of the word
[1:44:50] but he had broke out of this Earthbound
[1:44:52] Dimension into that third pull anointing
[1:44:54] where the spoken word alone was in God
[1:44:57] but it now had come into the voice of a
[1:44:59] Roman Centurion he said just speak the
[1:45:01] word I love this that word confession
[1:45:03] he's the high priest of our confession
[1:45:05] you know what that means
[1:45:07] confession means to say the same thing
[1:45:11] so you say the same thing God said
[1:45:14] and that makes it right
[1:45:16] because you're just repeating God's word
[1:45:21] and when the inspiration of the holy
[1:45:23] spirit is here to inspire you
[1:45:25] remember God will make your body
[1:45:29] come into your confession
[1:45:35] God will make your body
[1:45:37] come into your confession if you say
[1:45:41] well I'm a drunkard and I want to drink
[1:45:42] don't worry you'll soon be one
[1:45:44] if you say I'm a sinner and you want to
[1:45:46] sin you'll be right into it
[1:45:48] but if you say you're a Christian
[1:45:51] and you believe it all along
[1:45:54] then your testimony will bring you right
[1:45:57] into it amen
[1:46:01] your testimony is the vehicle from the
[1:46:04] confession to the manifestation
[1:46:08] if you can confess it your testimony
[1:46:11] will ride you into the manifestation of
[1:46:13] it
[1:46:14] your testimony will bring you right into
[1:46:17] it
[1:46:18] what did the Bible say they overcame him
[1:46:20] by the blood of the Lamb and by the word
[1:46:23] of their testimony and they loved not
[1:46:26] their lives if you believe in healing
[1:46:28] believe God has healed you confess it
[1:46:30] and God will make your body obey your
[1:46:32] confession he's the high priest of your
[1:46:35] confession sitting at the right hand of
[1:46:36] the father now with his own blood to
[1:46:38] make intercession
[1:46:39] for any confession
[1:46:41] that he died for do you love him tonight
[1:46:42] amen
[1:46:44] he died to rid sin Church
[1:46:46] sickness is the result of sin he said
[1:46:49] but you go right I'm giving you some
[1:46:51] stuff right now you go right out of this
[1:46:53] building testifying that you're saved
[1:46:56] what if you got this bill and said well
[1:46:57] I don't know then you're not saved
[1:47:00] but God will make your body obey your
[1:47:03] confession
[1:47:04] see he's the high priest of our
[1:47:06] confession before you can be healed
[1:47:10] you have to confess it first
[1:47:14] before you can be healed you have to
[1:47:17] confess it first
[1:47:20] John Ryan was always healed but his eyes
[1:47:22] were still closed
[1:47:24] and the prophet of God said I love this
[1:47:26] brother the prophet God said I realized
[1:47:28] something I had to give him something to
[1:47:30] say Amen
[1:47:33] I had to give him something to say so I
[1:47:35] told John Ryan you go downtown
[1:47:37] and you sell them papers and say extra
[1:47:40] extra Read All About It God has healed
[1:47:44] my blinded eyes
[1:47:45] the morning he woke up he was as blind
[1:47:48] as it ever been but now he had something
[1:47:50] to say and one day he walked in the
[1:47:54] barbershop and sit down and every time
[1:47:57] he had been in there I just imagined
[1:47:59] brother the barber said you want your
[1:48:01] regular haircut and this time he said no
[1:48:03] give me number three up there
[1:48:07] [Applause]
[1:48:09] we're kind of chuckled and said yeah
[1:48:11] that's real funny you don't know what it
[1:48:12] is because you've never seen it he said
[1:48:14] well I see it right now
[1:48:15] it's like this on this side a little fan
[1:48:18] on this side a little bit
[1:48:21] what are you saying I'm saying
[1:48:23] confess the word
[1:48:25] from your soul
[1:48:27] get in your testimony
[1:48:29] confess it and ride it into the
[1:48:31] manifestation let our musicians come
[1:48:33] tonight
[1:48:35] the soul
[1:48:37] is the real you you say well I got the
[1:48:38] baptism holy spirit that still has
[1:48:40] nothing to do with it that's just a
[1:48:41] temporal gift for you he says the real
[1:48:43] gift is your soul down in there
[1:48:45] see that was born of God and that
[1:48:48] controls the whole thing to the word of
[1:48:50] God and the will of God
[1:48:54] well I'm a Pentecostal I belong that if
[1:48:57] you don't line with that word there's
[1:48:58] something wrong
[1:48:59] you see you're a real you're a real
[1:49:01] father ain't God because that real start
[1:49:04] in your soul before there even was a
[1:49:07] spirit it was your soul
[1:49:09] he said then that Soul didn't come from
[1:49:10] God then it wasn't the term of God to
[1:49:12] begin with you're deceived he said
[1:49:14] you're in a patch of wheat bearing the
[1:49:16] world's record of the weeds and coming
[1:49:17] forth acting like the world loving the
[1:49:19] world because the love of God is Not In
[1:49:23] You
[1:49:24] and God is
[1:49:27] love how many can say Lord let this
[1:49:30] quickening power
[1:49:31] bring my body subject
[1:49:34] to your word
[1:49:36] he said see you believe there is he said
[1:49:38] then you go acting like there is
[1:49:41] you believe there's a change he said you
[1:49:43] believe you become a Christian you come
[1:49:44] and confess Jesus Christ to be your
[1:49:46] savior you believe it then when you go
[1:49:47] outside and your critic friends they say
[1:49:49] I don't see no difference in you but you
[1:49:51] believe there is then you go acting like
[1:49:54] there is then after a while everybody
[1:49:56] knows there is
[1:50:00] isn't that powerful
[1:50:01] after a while everybody will see the
[1:50:03] manifestation of your confession
[1:50:07] you love him tonight
[1:50:09] friends I believe the anointing's in the
[1:50:10] body
[1:50:11] I believe that the bridegroom is acting
[1:50:13] through the bride once you stand to your
[1:50:15] feet with us
[1:50:16] I believe that word in your soul
[1:50:18] has come into you by the baptism
[1:50:21] has been quickened by the baptism of the
[1:50:23] Holy Ghost and the prophet said then
[1:50:24] from a little group of the true seed of
[1:50:26] the word of God
[1:50:27] of the word God will present Christ a
[1:50:29] beloved bride a virgin of his word and
[1:50:32] through them
[1:50:33] and by them will be fulfilled all that
[1:50:35] has been promised for his word in this
[1:50:37] virgin who knows no man-made creature
[1:50:39] doggies
[1:50:40] The Word of Promise in himself like it
[1:50:43] was in Mary see God himself made
[1:50:46] manifest now this brother brother John
[1:50:48] this one it's a powerful statement he
[1:50:51] will act himself
[1:50:53] by his own Word of Promise so to fulfill
[1:50:56] all that has been written of him as he
[1:50:59] did when he came from the Virgin womb
[1:51:03] in this bride he will manifest himself
[1:51:08] like he came from the Virgin womb
[1:51:12] how you say preacher what do you mean
[1:51:14] came from the Virgin womb well according
[1:51:16] to my Bible
[1:51:18] Mary knew no man
[1:51:21] had nothing to do with that
[1:51:23] it was of the Holy Ghost right according
[1:51:26] to my Bible she accepted the word
[1:51:29] she received the Word of Promise and
[1:51:32] confessed that word and when she
[1:51:34] confessed that word being unto me
[1:51:36] according to Thy word she became the
[1:51:39] womb to carry the manifestation of
[1:51:43] Genesis 3 15.
[1:51:45] of Zechariah 9 of Isaiah 7 of Isaiah
[1:51:48] listen friends it's all through the
[1:51:50] Bible we can't preach it one night
[1:51:53] you are
[1:51:55] the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and
[1:51:58] you're carrying in your soul the word of
[1:52:00] change
[1:52:01] listen I believe things can happen right
[1:52:03] here tonight
[1:52:05] do you realize right now while the
[1:52:06] word's going forth you may not feel
[1:52:08] nothing but your body is coming subject
[1:52:11] to that word
[1:52:14] feelings have nothing to do with it I
[1:52:16] love to feel him I want to feel him
[1:52:18] every day of my life but when I don't
[1:52:19] fail him brother Bill it don't change
[1:52:21] the word that's in my soul
[1:52:24] because in my soul we're in the
[1:52:25] heavenlies
[1:52:26] y'all just the other day we were out in
[1:52:28] some meetings I want to share this
[1:52:29] testimony with you and I'm done just the
[1:52:31] other day out in some meetings I just
[1:52:32] want to show you that just while the
[1:52:34] words being preached things are changing
[1:52:36] it was out in some meetings in Canada I
[1:52:38] was out there last year for the Youth
[1:52:40] Camp there at brother biscals and when I
[1:52:42] was out there I I met brother Murphy
[1:52:44] Wong so you've probably heard of brother
[1:52:45] Murphy and I met him out there and
[1:52:47] brother Murphy told me sperlander he
[1:52:48] said my daughter here just got married a
[1:52:50] few years ago and he said they've been
[1:52:51] trying to have a baby he said it's been
[1:52:52] I don't know how long they've been
[1:52:53] married he said you pray that God will
[1:52:55] just give him a child so they really
[1:52:57] want a child and I said yeah I said will
[1:52:58] he praying for that so I was preaching
[1:53:00] on that Wednesday night and I had no
[1:53:02] idea the condition or what was even
[1:53:04] happening or what what the doctor had
[1:53:06] even said and I began to preach on the
[1:53:08] third pool and I said see when Jesus
[1:53:10] Christ come down veiled in human flesh
[1:53:12] and said let there be a squirrel let
[1:53:14] there be a squirrel let there be a
[1:53:15] squirrel I said there was no squirrel
[1:53:17] DNA laying there
[1:53:19] brother Johnny didn't come down and say
[1:53:21] abracadabra abracadoo out of the
[1:53:24] squirrel residue I make a squirrel out
[1:53:25] of you
[1:53:26] there was no scroll guts laying there
[1:53:28] there was no squirrel DNA laying there
[1:53:31] it was a creative word spoken and
[1:53:34] brought something into creation and when
[1:53:36] I said that sister brother Murphy's
[1:53:38] daughter sitting back there she told me
[1:53:40] this year she told me her testimony she
[1:53:41] said brother Andrew she said last year
[1:53:43] when you said that she said in my soul I
[1:53:46] received that word she said two years
[1:53:48] before that she said brother Ron had
[1:53:49] been here brother Ron Spencer for a camp
[1:53:51] and when he was here he saw a vision
[1:53:53] that I would have a child and he said
[1:53:55] sis you're going to have that baby she
[1:53:57] said after that I went to the doctor and
[1:53:59] the doctor told me I was going to have
[1:54:00] to have a surgery a surgery in order to
[1:54:03] have the child she said so I began to
[1:54:05] think well brother Ron had that vision
[1:54:06] and the doctor will perform this surgeon
[1:54:09] I'll have the child she said because
[1:54:10] brother Andrew according to the doctor
[1:54:12] without the surgery I could never
[1:54:13] conceive a child she said but when you
[1:54:16] said that that Wednesday night she said
[1:54:18] I received that into my soul and she
[1:54:20] said Lord there's nothing there to
[1:54:21] conceive a child with but you're still a
[1:54:23] Creator she said brother Andrew she said
[1:54:25] the next morning I got up and she said I
[1:54:28] felt led to go in there and take a
[1:54:30] pregnancy test and she said I come to
[1:54:32] Camp last year amen with a positive
[1:54:35] pregnancy test she said look over there
[1:54:37] there's the child amen today
[1:54:40] she said my vision and the word of God
[1:54:44] we've got the child
[1:54:46] listen friends I still believe God can
[1:54:49] bypass doctors
[1:54:50] I thank God for doctors but I still
[1:54:52] believe God
[1:54:54] he can change things
[1:54:56] even when you don't feel that your
[1:54:58] body's coming subject to this word
[1:55:01] you love him tonight I want you bow your
[1:55:03] hearts with us here this evening
