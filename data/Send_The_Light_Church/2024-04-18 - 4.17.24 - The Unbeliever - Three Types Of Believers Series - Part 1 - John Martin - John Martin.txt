desire you've placed in our heart to be here Lord some have made great sacrifices to be here have worked hard set things aside things that needed to be done some have driven miles Lord some have spent

Lord the blessings that you have in store for us through your word would be extended to each and everyone amen Lord we commit the service in your hands just ask your blessings now Lord upon the reading of this word Lord upon our understanding upon our heart to receive it on good ground and Lord that we would uh that we would we would benefit and become real genuine Believers in your word father we give you the praise now for we ask it humbly in Jesus Christ's name amen turn with me if you would to the book of St John chapter 6 and we'll try to read through this uh quickly how many REM St John chapter 6 amen how many this is the first time you're reading it there's a lot that happens in uh St John chapter 6 um but we want to start here at verse uh number 52 and we want to get it well brother brandom uh read these scriptures mainly from 60 to 72 when he preached on three kinds of Believers and we just want to dive into one of those but we'll see these three types of Believers in these scriptures starting with verse number 52 and the Jews therefore strove among themselves saying how can this man give us his flesh to eat and then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except he eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you don't even have any life In You whosoever eateth My Flesh and drinketh my blood have eternal life and I will raise him up at the last day amen for my flesh is meat indeed my blood is drink indeed he that eateth my flesh and drinketh my blood dwelleth in me and I in him and as the living father sent me I live by the father so he that eateth me even he shall live by me this is the bread which came down from heaven not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead he that eateth of this bread shall live forever these things said in in the synagogue is he taught in cernium now many therefore of his disciples when they heard this said this is a hard saying who can hear it amen and when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them does this offend you you offended at the word that's being preached what and if ye shall see the son of man as sent up where he was before it is the spirit that Quicken it the flesh profit nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life but there are some of you that believe not where Jesus knew from the beginning who it was that would that believe not and he and who should be betray him so he's amen and he said therefore said I unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given of him of my father from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him then said Jesus unto the TW disciples will you also go away and then Simon Peter answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou H has the words of eternal life we we believe that we and are sure that thou art Christ the son of the Living God and Jesus answered have not I chosen you 12 and one of you is a devil he spake of Judas the scariot the son of Simon for it for he it is what for he it was that should betray him being one of the twel amen God bless you you may be seated I know that was kind of a lengthy lengthy reading there um and we'll probably get into this uh a little bit uh more in detail uh as we talk about the other believers but tonight we just want to talk about one of the three Believers and I just want to start out with this quote that brother brandom spoke of at the beginning of his message three kinds of Believers he said the the first is the believer the makeb believer and the unbeliever now there's this is quite a subject but as as sure as we are sit here tonight that group is always gathered together amen wherever the people are gathered we find this group and always have found them and we probably always will have them until the coming of the Lord amen and I want us tonight to picture ourselves as I speak on these three groups and see what group we're in amen whoa what group were in now brother Brandon preached this message in his home Church in Jeffersonville Indiana now you would think that that church was full of Believers and that he would just tell the church you're all believers but he didn't and he wanted his church to see which one they were betraying and and so this in itself is is a is a hard saying I I would imagine if you asked every one of them in the church are you a Believer and a Believer or M believer they would all say well we're Believers brother Bram we believe this messag amen but on the the contrary he was sending a message no we're not and he actually says this at the end of the message right before he prays he says look you're in one of these classes he says in your present state right now the present state of your mind right that you're here in the visible audience and you that are in The Invisible audience of this tape your Pres state of mind after listening to this tape proves to you what class you're in it tells you exactly where you are whether you're a believer in the word and stay with it or whether you'll walk out and shut the door and shut the tape off H that tells you what you've done you don't want to listen to it you shut it off I don't want to listen to that well that's that un believer see you won't stop to test it and see if it's the truth or not or just hanging around to trying to see some fault then you know what you are too it tells you see God help us to believe it stand with it be loyal to it obey the word for he is the word do you believe that he says let us pray let us pray this is in one sense it's a sobering subject but the reason that I really want to bring it is because the has convinced so many people who do not believe all the word that they are believers and just simply that is the reason that that is the purpose and the reason that I fell in my heart so as we take a look at these we want to just concentrate on the unbeliever today I want to ask this question is the devil a Believer or is he an unbeliever now now God is a Believer and he says only believe he told us to only believe he's he he that's the key is to to to believe now is the devil considered one of those who's telling us to believe and believe or or is he viewed at as an unbeliever he don't believe in serving God I'm just I'm just trying to stir us up in the thinking process James 2:19 says Thou believest that there is one God thou doest well the Devils also believe and tremble amen amen so the devil knows that there's one God and if the devil knows he's there's only one God why is he trying to exalt himself above the Throne of God and and and truly the answer to this this question shows the real characteristic of an unbeliever the devil quoted 99.97% of the word to Eve exactly but he refused to agree with it all and there is the dividing line between the believer and the unbeliever the devil believe yet he's identified as an unbeliever the unbeliever isn't just an Infidel that says there's no God but he's one that does not believe every word of God the unbeliever sits in the church but he refuses to unite his life with the word of God Amen and I know that's strong but we've got to come to grips with it brother brandom said in Satan's Eden he said there is a God of this world and I preached to you about last Sunday here he is today in deceit that treacherous hour that treacherous time that we're living in the most glorious time of Ages because we're facing the great Millennium again we're facing the Eden again but right at this age all the de heat and every tactic that he's ever used has been able to deceive with he's Gathering it all together and reinforce himself and come down like God and has put himself in the place of God Rel religious and can quote the scripture and can tell you the scripture just as Satan did to Eve in the garden but leave one leave out one spot of it amen is all he has to do is make a Gap a gap so let's listen to this definition of an unbeliever in a church it's some who's willing to leave out one word out of their life how often we are programmed with the aspect of well I go to church I do this I pay my ties I do this I I I don't do that but I'm still a Believer but are we but are we a Believer now I'm not saying we all have to be 100% perfect in living the word I want to make it clear I am not saying that but what I am saying is we should be striving to live all the word because if we have an attitude of it doesn't really matter if I do it all I'm still believer we're an unbeliever we do not realize it amen I know this is strong amen but if it helps us get to where we got to get to then it's worth it right now San job is to create a gap between our heart and the word of God Amen and he don't care if that Gap is this big or an Infidel as long as there's a gap because that Gap is what keeps us from going all the way with God that's right so we look at people who are really far away from God as an unbeliever and those who go to church and are living some of the word as a Believer but that's wrong we shouldn't do that uh it doesn't matter if they're they're professing to be a believer Satan's job will always be to bring a gap and and that Gap is by getting us to doubt you know doubt the word now brother brand gives examples of be Bel chazar Ahab Ahab they they were they thought they were Believers but they were unbelievers he said unbelievers they deny the whole word of God to be true he says he believes it but he denies it he says well so much uh so much of it is well he says but if it's not if it isn't right then that makes him an unbeliever it all has to be you've got to believe every T every jot everything that's said in there it's got to be true if you if you say now well you know I don't know I don't believe that he says then you're an unbeliever true so really what we're doing is we know an unbeliever somebody that doesn't want anything to do with God doesn't want to talk about it doesn't want to go to church doesn't want no we know he's an unbeliever right what we don't know is the person who's a 99 % believer but there's still something that he refuses to do that God told him to do he thinks he's a Believer true and as long as Satan can get that person to think that he's a Believer he won't try to do that other part that's good are you with me all right who's not with me the job of the Holy Ghost is to unite us with the word if it's s job to get us to have a gap between them it's God's job to get us to unite with it am we know in Deuteronomy 6 if you want to write it down 4 through 7 uh here oh Israel Lord our God is one Lord Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might amen and and and these words I commanded they got to be in your heart you got to teach them to your children right so the word has to be first a total commitment not 99% we talked about I believe uh last service that uh this is the message that we've heard from the beginning decare to you that God is light and in him is no Darkness at all if we say we have fellowship with him and walk in darkness we do not the truth we're we're lying so the whole idea is God is trying to get us to walk out of the darkness that we're in and to walk into more light what we're going to be doing is we're going to be creating more of a Oneness with God uh that that his whole desire is that we become just like him we'll see him as he is and and and there's no Gap amen and and and I know that the other churches are not going to be teaching this and that's okay I don't want to be part of that group that says well I I thought because I did this and did this and did that you know that I I made it right depart from me ye workers of iniquity what's iniquity not doing what you were told you knew you should do all right brother brother Ram said in the message Abraham and his seed after him just shown the importance now of separating from darkness and unbelief and now and then notice as soon as Abraham believed God by justification and in parentheses that means Believing on the Lord were Justified so as soon as he believed on God immediately God called Abraham to separate from all unbelief right yes and we and and and the the mentality is as soon as somebody gets Justified there a they're they're in they're they're they're sold out they're they're where they need to be and yet God said this is beginning since you've taken this step I want to let you know you got to separate from everything that disbelieves this word yes Amen in the message possessing all things brother see God when he called Abraham he called him to separate from every from himself from everything and that's what we have to do God calls us to totally separate from sin now he said what's sin sin is unbelief amen come out of her my people and be not partakers of her sin so in Genesis we see at the very beginning God separated the light from the darkness and brother bandam says in the message God's word calls for total separation from unbelief he says the spirit of God spoke out and said let there be light and he separated the light from darkness and he's been doing that ever since separating light from Darkness amen and that's what happens when we come to church it's why we love to come to church we want the spotlight of the word of God to shine on our life to shine out the darkness let us see where we're standing with God so Jesus speaking in St John 17 if you want to write it down just read the chapter there's so many different verses here but he spokes these words and he says I have given them Thy Word I have given them Thy word and he says sanctify them through thy truth Thy word is truth so when the word comes forth the word is being preached you read the word of God and that word is given to you for one reason it is to clean you from the inside out amen and he says neither pray I for these alone but I pray for them which also Shall Believe on me through their word so now the word is going to get to us not through the the 12 disciples but through the disciples Through the Ages right and they that they all may be one amen the purpose now is to send the word to bring sanctification is that they would be one father uh that thou that thou I'm sorry that they all may be one as thou father art in me and I in thee that they also may be one in US i i in them and thou in me that they may be perfect in one or that is complete Oneness in God there is no Darkness there is no unbelief and in us there is right we you know mentally we don't want to say there is any but as soon as that word's being preached and oh yeah that's right I I haven't I I haven't been doing that the word says I should be doing that that's calling it out right there and that's why I like you know brother brandom I don't think he's really I I can't speak for brother Brandon but I like the way that brother Brandon said that it's our state of mind we don't want to put somebody in a group you know this person is a a Believer this person is an unbeliever right you know we don't want to do that but at our state of mind at any time we come in the church it it it it's in one of those it's in one of those states do you believe that amen Amen brother BR said in the message God's eye God's eye he said be real reverent please if you will unbelief is one of the most horrible things that there is yes let me go any way but don't let me be a religious unbeliever unbelief is the only sin there is smoking drinking commit adultery cursing swearing that's not sin that's that's attributes of unbelief right he that believeth not uh he that believeth not is condemned already he's quoting Jesus and people who claim to be religious go to church Pious and still rank unbelievers Sinners Jesus said you're of your father of the devil and yet they will just as pious and religious as they could be the worst demon there is to deal with is a religious demon that's right he said they are five times more horrible than any other evil spirit think about that so you know we look at evil spirits as like whoa I mean they're just dark they're wearing the dark clothes they're just I mean oh but now he's talking about something a a demon that's much five times worse of that sits in the church right five times worse yes he's religious amen he uses part of the word amen we're taught by Jesus there's a Broadway and a narrow way the Broadway he said many go in there at we might might say it like this many unbelievers go in there at so one in the spectrum of the unbeliever is I don't believe in God I don't want to go to church I I don't want to talk about God and the other end of the spectrum is I believe in God I sincerely Tremble When I fearfully think about falling into the hands of God when I die because I know I'm not going to be where I should be amen that is still an unbeliever because he refuses to live by the every word of God Amen both our unbelievers the unbeliever that sits in church he still believes but only partially believes so it's important which part you know we sing that song Lord search me see if there be some Wicked way amen our hearts are deceitful who can know it it takes God to to to show us what's real really in there and you know I praise God for all that we believe in but the part that God is interested is in the part that we need to start believing in in our opening scripture there were 70 disciples that believed on the Lord and they followed the Lord but it says in John 666 the mark of the beast as John le Fontaine used to say from that time many of his disciples went back and walked no more with him so but he calls them Believers but they're not full Believers if you're not a full believer you are now an unbeliever if you're not a full believer you're an unbeliever that's right and it's just a matter of time before you stop John chapter 8 John chapter 8 very this is just a little bit further in in the chapter and uh starting with verse 29 in and St John chapter 8 uh and he that sent me is with me the father have not not left me alone for I for I do always those things that please him and he spake these word and as he spake these words many believed on him we could call them Believers right then Jesus said to the Jews which believed on him if you continue in my word then you're my disciples indeed now just remember the two chapters before there were his these Believers that believed on him but then they walked away and now he's telling hey look you got to continue in the word I'm going to be giving you word down the road right and this word you got to take it you got to run with it you got to you got to live it amen you got to continue in the word amen and then if you continue in the word he says you shall be my disciples indeed and he and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free yes well I'm already free that's the attitude that's the same attitude these religious I'm already free I'm already saved Lord help us to to catch the importance of believing all the word of God now I want to I want to mix a little bit of this um to show how how if we respond to the word the right way we become the word and we're proving with our life that we're a Believer are you with me turn with me to First Peter chapter 22 I mean chapter 1 verse 22 the the word when it's preached if we receive it into our hearts and we're doing everything we can to live it out it is what purifies our life it's what gets us ready how can a person say they're born again by the word of God to become the word of God and not believe part of the word of God it it just doesn't make sense if you say you're born again by the word then you're not going to deny the word that you've been born by because every seed comes brings forth of its own kind all right 1 Peter chapter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth is that what Jesus told us that word sanctifies us through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently amen being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever for all the flesh is grass all and all the glory of man is the flower of grass the grass wither the flower thereof falleth away but the word of the Lord endureth forever and this is the word which we W which by the gospel is preached onto you so the word is sent to purify our souls now it's one thing to go to church that all you do is believe in justification the blood just covers me that's all the blood the blood the blood Calvary that's all that's all that's it that's it what you're doing is you're taking away the rest of the word that's right you need all the word amen and this word is what purifies our souls when we obey it amen all right 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 6 1 Peter chapter 2 verse 6 through1 wherefore also it is contained in the scriptures behold I lay in Zion a chief Corner Stone elect precious and he that believeth on him shall not be confounded unto you therefore which believe now here's the believer unto you therefore which believe he is precious but unto them which be disobedient now these are the unbelievers the stone which the builders disallowed the same is made the head of the corner I know this is strong but if you're disobedient you're projecting yourself an unbeliever most people want to say look I I'm I'm still a believer I'm just being disobedient that's true I'm I'm just we trying to line up with the scriptures and what you know the the the Seer the prophet in this age he could see he went up he could see and came back down and and taught us all right then he says here in verse eight and a stone of stumbling a rock of offense even to them which stumble at the word being disobedient where unto also they were appointed they can't be a believer they're stumbling at the word stumbling to believe it if you don't believe it you're not going to obey it but then he says you're a chosen generation a royal prieser a holy nation A peculiar people that you should show forth the Praises of him that called you out of that Darkness right that that part where you don't you you you're just struggling and believing all the word now you you you believe all the word you came out of that Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past you were not a people but now you are the people of God which have not obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy the 70 disciples who left Jesus in Matthew or in St John chapter six are a perfect example of unbelievers even they an unbeliever many times believes part of the word but he doesn't believe all of it and eventually he will go and just do his own thing amen the children of Israel they stumbled at the word amen they became disobedient and they are another good example of an unbeliever in the message three kinds of Believers brother B says a real believer don't hear nothing but the word he said that's all he watches the word he ain't looking for no loopholes he ain't looking for no gimmicks he believes God and that settles it and he just keeps going on he there is a he said there is the believer amen the unbeliever fills up in a minute what's he referring to fills up it just comes to church fills up with the word and just a minute and he can't stay to listen 10 minutes of the message he's got to get up and walk out true this little guy that's filled up quick it jumps up and runs out at every little phase that he don't like you don't pay no attention to him he's just an un believer to begin with right see the difference between a Believer is just hungry wants the word give me more of the word and unbelievers you know that's too much that's too much I've had enough are you with me now these are not my words this is just what the prophet brought us it's helping us recognize you know brother man said this statement he says it's real easy to know where you're going where are you being drawn to yeah that's it where's your where's your desire where's your hunger yeah because we're all manifesting right it's manifesting time in the book of Jude turn with me if you would to the book of Jude take a look at this children of Israel uh maybe for a little bit uh we're making some good time and I'm I'm skipping a lot of stuff so I'm real happy about you know making good time the Lord Jude verse one says Jude the servant of Jesus Christ and the brother James to them that are number one these are San ified they're not only Justified they're Sanctified by God the father and preserved in Jesus Christ and called Mercy unto you and peace and love be multiplied beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints so the purpose of this letter that Jude is writing is to tell the Believers that are Sanctified and that are preserved in God that they need to just not sit around like a like like you would a can that's preserved right your spaghetti that's preserved or your beans or your peaches or your pears he says but you got to get up and you got to earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the Saints a different total mentality totally different mentality than I'm saved amen I'm Sanctified I'm preserved what there this wasn't just an idea that Jude had this was a burden on his heart I think God put on his heart to write it and he says when I gave all diligence it was needful for me to tell you about this important thing that you should earnestly content for the faith you got to make sure that you got it you got to make sure you're believing every word that's right that you're walking in it amen it's not an option the devil is not giving up on anybody I don't care if you're preserved or not Satan is sticking around seeking whom he may devour amen and the only way to combat Leo DEA is earnestly contend for the original Faith amen I believe that verse four for there are certain men who crept in unawares the church don't even know about it crept in unawares who were before of old ordained to this condemnation they're called ungodly men turning the grace of the Lord grace of our God into lasciviousness and denying the only Lord Lord God and our Lord Jesus Christ now it's important that we we try to understand what this verse is people who are turning the grace or or or or denying the Lord God no one's no one's ever going to say I deny that Jesus Christ I deny Jesus Christ they're not going to say that but but when they start entertaining doing their own will instead of God's will after they know what God's will is they're denying the only Lord because if he ain't Lord of everything he's not Lord at all so if we want to start going another way than God's way we're actually denying the word which is denying the only Lord God Amen now I know this is strong but we just we just we got to look at the importance of how important the Bible is to us that that that's the whole purpose of this to become in love with the word of God to become one with the word there are believers they were saved by the grace of God and then they began to walk after their own will they became self-willed walking without the fear of God they turned the grace of God into disgrace they're not afraid to want whatever they want they became irreverent impious they stopped showing respect reverence they became presumptuous oh it won't matter to God I'm sure it'll be okay now they were believers who God destroyed because of their unbelief so at one time they believe but God had to destroy them because they did not continue they didn't earnestly contend they didn't see a need to contend for the faith they had enough Faith are you with me that's what you said oh do you believe are you a Believer do you got faith yeah I'm a Believer I got faith that wasn't the mentality of Jude verse five I will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards he destroyed them that believed not now when they all came out of Egypt they all believed amen he even called them my people my people I heard the The Cry of my people I've come down so here these are his people they came down they actually had a Hallelujah rejoicing service after they crossed the Red Sea that's right and I tell you brother Ron they didn't have a hard time they didn't have a time they they were just set free from the task masker amen they were Believers amen but they did not contend for the original Faith which because the original Faith the original voice the re the original Revelation is I have a land for you just taking you out of here is just part of it but the the full promise is I got a land for you and they did not keep that original faith and so look yeah this message came to get us out of a denomination but that ain't all it did it was to take us into the word to the Manifest of the word of the hour and I think too many people are stopping they don't want to press into that amen that's why we got to earnestly contend verse six and the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own habitation has reserved in Everlasting chains in darkness unto the Judgment of that great day so he's given us another example that you got to stay on track with what you started right if Lucifer would have stayed on track and did his job in heaven there would be no evil we wouldn't you know of course we wouldn't be here and all that but but he's given the example they he left his first estate the the the children of Israel that came out of Egypt they left their first estate which is let's go into the promised land they were willing to go until the spies went over there realized that these guys are so big they came back and they gave gave an evil report right and their their hearts of the of the congregation just thought well you know I I I we can't do it we can't go it's you know it's easier to just believe than to believe something Joshua and Caleb had another Spirit had another Spirit they had a believing spirit amen they just said no we can do it he gave us the promise it isn't how big they are or how little we are that's right it's God who made the promise is able to make these Stones raised he's able to to annihilate these guys amen so two of them had faith in the word and the rest of them who were Believers start showing their colors as unbelievers are you with me and brother brandham says every one of these types of Believers is in every Church yeah every everyone it it's not our job to say who is and who isn't it is our job as brother brandham said to analyze am I believing every word am I shunning part of it am I kind of ignoring this part you read the message and brother bandam says something and something says ins say you got to start doing that I'm telling you you start doing that because if you don't you're really manifesting in you're an unbeliever amen when brother Bram says I want you as we go over these things I want you to see where you're at don't just say I'm a Believer because I've been going to your you know brandom Tabernacle for x amount of years but which part of the word this is a this is a relationship A Love Affair between you and God and God speaks to you whether he does it in the church or when you're on your knees praying or when you're listening to a tape or you're driving your car God speaks to you and that word you must believe that word if you choose not to believe it if you choose to just well I don't need I like well I believe but I'm not going to do it that is a devil that is a devil the devil believes and he trembles he doesn't submit to it we don't want to believe the word and not do it that's not good enough the whole earth is groaning waiting for the manifestation of us yes who fre more agency amen amen so I want to talk about these men that had crept in unawares so I just had of look that up unbelievers these are unbelievers that have settled in alongside of the believer so they Lodge with us secretly quietly they possess a form of godliness alongside of The Godly so the unbelievers lodge among the Believers and the mate Believers one of the signs that is common among the unbeliever is a spirit of settling for Less this is is an important one settling for Less when more light is presented to the unbeliever they're okay there's no big deal if they don't walk into it they're okay with where they're at a spirit of settling for Less a as Jesus talked about in the spirit of leoda is need of nothing settling for where they're at a spirit where the word has been shown sown among the Thorns now remember when the word fell on the four types of ground one of them was among Thorns so they had the word they rejoiced they said amen I'm a Believer yeah we want this let's get going but through the course of time when they weren't in that presence they entertained other things and those other things they took the seed in and eventually down the road they began to grow up and what do they do the Bible says Jesus said they choke out the word amen they were Believers and they became unbelievers amen sitting right amongst us don't ever let a spirit of settling with what you have be around you always be earnestly contending for more amen I want more I need more I don't know what I need but I know I need more it it's okay to say I'm not sure that's right but the but we need to be hungering there's something inside of us the the deep is calling out for the Deep there's got to be more there's got to be Victory there's got to be Joy there's got to be peace there's got to be living for others more there there's just got to be yes and and and that that love affair that's what all a sudden your intenance go up you're paying attention in in in in in the in the ministry of the word that word is for me you know how many people come in the church they come into church with a bad attitude and they wonder why they don't get anything out of it we've got to come into church like a Believer amen a Believer like God God is here yes God wants to bless me amen God wants to give me more of himself he wants to when I get more of the Holy Spirit I'm going to get more joy more peace more love amen that's what Believers believe yes we just can't come in with any old kind of attitude say I'm a Believer yeah I'm in the message so is the Devil he's really in the message you know how messed up this message is that's the and that ain't because that's because the devil's in the message you understand what I'm saying the devil wants to get a hold of any beautiful life and twist it up amen that's right the message is pure yes it is right on that's what God set for us to get ready but the devil wants to get in there and twist it just like he wants to get into our life and twist things up in the message three kinds of Believers brother Brandon says when the supernatural is displayed yes it produces three different types it did down in Egypt It produced the unbeliever the believer and the mate believer it did all three classes now what did he say he do this the supernatural yes the super the supernatural attracts it does but it doesn't make you a Believer it doesn't it just attracts you still who are you are that's right all right Hebrews chapter 3 verse 6 now we have to hurry because we were doing good with our time and we don't want to just all a sudden be behind again Hebrew chapter 3 verse 6 but Christ as a son over his own house Brother Bruce spoke on this a little bit in his message praise God who house we are If We Hold Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of Hope firm unto the End Amen so the children of Israel did not do that the 70 disciples that believed on Jesus in St John said they didn't do that they said look this is a hard saying I I who can who who can who can understand he didn't ask us to understand he asked us to believe it right understanding will come yes and then he goes on and he's trying to he's trying Paul or the the the writer here of Hebrews is trying to to take the the the situation that happened with with the children of Israel as a type of what happens in the believer's heart today he says wherefore as the Holy Ghost saith today if you will hear his voice Harden not your hearts as they did in the wilderness when your fathers tempted me prove me saw my Works 40 years wherefore I was grieved with that generation and said they do always air in their heart and they have not known my ways so there heart was didn't didn't want to believe they murmured they complained you know all the problems they had in there there was there was just murmuring and complaining about the church can you believe that yes sir they wanted to get rid of they wanted to get rid of the pastor they they wanted to get a different leader and go back you know Amen to Egypt I mean that just the truth of the matter amen because it was too hard for them just like these 70 disciples said this is too hard who can hear this and they went and they started do you know those 70 disciples they went and they started following somebody else yeah they left the leader of life to follow something that was easier for their flesh amen so I swear in my wrath that they shall not enter my rest verse 12 take heed Brethren take heed Brethren lest there be in any of you an evil heart of unbelief now he defines what unbelief is departing from the Living God it's okay to sit in a church that's dead that believes the same thing the same Creeds the same thing the same Dogma the same candle burning the same Rosary the same it's okay to do that but but don't believe in a living God true now a living God will speak to your heart amen because he's alive you're you're his son your daughter you're his bride he's speaking there's a relationship but he ain't going to speak to you through some worldly music some worldly television show some some worldly thing he speak speak to you through the word my sheep know my voice what's his voice it's his word so when the word is preached he's speaking that's a living God he's alive and well living in me to tell that's why we hunger for the living word amen amen if we go to the graveyard we're not going to see anyone that speak to us they're they're six feet under people will get get to a place where it's okay when God's not speaking to them about moving forward they're actually content with going to the church as long as they don't have to do nothing but you start having to you know do something well I'm feeling uncomfortable that is what it means depart from the Living God an evil heart of unbelief look at verse 13 but exort one another daily while is called day lest any of you be hardened through the deceitfulness of sin what is the deceitfulness of sin it's real easy Satan says you don't really have to do that he that knoweth to do good and doeth it not to him it is sin that's the deceitfulness of sin you can still feel okay with not doing all the word there ought to be something inside the believer's heart that's hungering to fulfill all the word of God in their life if if they're if they're connected to God they really want to be what God wants them to be then they're interested in every word of God because Jesus said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and Jesus said in St John chapter 12 he says uh he that doesn't believe in me it's it's okay I didn't come to judge anyone but but he that rejecteth me and the words that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day the word becomes important to the believer to the unbeliever is not that important are you with me because Satan has tricked them deceived them into thinking that what they do believe is good enough because they believe and they got baptized right he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved well why don't I need to believe anything else for then the deceitfulness of sin the real Believing on God is believing all the way God we just started the race so when God when God when Abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him for righteousness God called him to separate from the other unbelief right and this is the hardest thing I I think for us as as Believers in this message is that there's still a part that God is calling us to separate from if he had to do it from our father our our father of our faith why not the children of our father are you with me amen so we need to exhort one another daily that means I need you to tell me hey I need you to be living more the word that's what that means I I want to I want to get some phone calls I want to get some some taxes I want somebody to be caring about me and we need to care about one another we need to care about our spouses our children our parents we need to care one for another and not just well whatever it's really important now look at verse 14 for we are made partakers of Christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end we are not made partakers of Christ if we stop the 70 stopped they were no longer partakers the children of Israel they stopped they were no longer partakers Jesus said they're everyone dead they ate Mana yes they ate of that bread but they're everyone dead Jude tells us look after he saved them he destroyed them they weren't made part Aker so today we got to think about it's not about sitting in the church sitting in the message belonging to send the light that is not the answer that's right because brother bradam already said in every church is three types of Believers so we can't be looking at just being in the church is we're a Believer we've got to be looking am I lining up with all that God is speaking to me at the church amen amen and that takes a real honest to goodness sincere heart yes if my people which are called by my name amen shall humble themselves right it it takes a lord I got to know because there's a deceitfulness of sin that gets in there and the saint wants us to think that we're going to make the Rapture by just coming to church no we're going to make the Rapture by departing from all Darkness from departing from all Sin from becoming this word and believing be a believer that I can live more than I've been living I can become more of of of what Christ is I could literally have a desire to live for others and that's right you know these people were not made partakers of Christ we're not going to be joint heirs with Christ if we don't hold our confidence steadfast for the end so we've got to earnestly contend for the faith right all right verse 18:19 we got to hurry now cuz time is time is time is almost up I don't want to say time is up because I'll feel bad so I'll say time is almost up and to whom swear that he should that they should not enter into his rest they wouldn't be partakers of Christ but to them that believe not so we see then that they could not enter in because of unbelief they entertain that Spirit of just settling settling we don't have to go into the promised land we don't have to get serious about manifesting the Holy Ghost verse one of chapter 4 let us therefore fear lest a promise being left us of entering into his rest any of us should seem to come short of it for unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word that was preached did not profit them because it wasn't mixed with faith they didn't earnestly contend for it they were settling for what they did believe they settled for what they did believe instead of saying I need to believe more yes this is such a severe threshold I believe for every one of us as we stare we look we search our lives and we look God was there anything that you were trying to tell me that I just kind of pushed aside didn't think it was that big a deal that's right right because you know God is not obligated to give us more light more Revelation if we don't walk in the one that we did and and if he's trying to take us to a place and we're you know we're just trying to sidestep something and get there it's not going to work because you're making God a fool for thinking you don't you don't have to do something he's asked you to do and you're going to bypass it some other way we've got to go God's way let's stand together you promise me you'll do me something when you get home today tomorrow sometime this week read Hebrews chapter 10 verses 22 through 38 and you know maybe we'll maybe we'll touch into that when we start part part two but it talks continues to talk about the unbeliever and how we need to be a believer and not draw back but to continue pressing on amen that's what separates the believer from the unbeliever they're both sitting in church they're both believing part of the word but only the believer believes all the word and not you know if I could say it like this the devil believes more of the word than a lot of people but he he doesn't submit to it he doesn't obey it he just mentally believes it so I'm interested in living I'm in interested in In Living the word of God Amen let's let's look to him in in prayer before we we sing Heavenly Father we thank you for sending your Prophet to speak things Lord that we would just never ever be able to come up with never be able to understand Lord we would be in total darkness but you sent a prophet and he preached things to where Lord not only we could understand them but Lord that that through these things that he preached like these these three types of Believers we know now how to strive to be the believer you want us to be we thank you for that Lord continue to open our eyes continue you to show us what things that we must do Lord help us to take heed L there' be inside of any of us a a a heart of of of of unbelief and departing from that that living voice speaking to us personally a on a regular basis father meet with us uh in the mornings and and when we spend time at home praying meet with us Lord and and and show us as your bride how we can be more in line with a complete believer father amen Lord if there's any any questions on your people's heart concerning the things that were spoken pray that you would make them clear to them you can do that Lord make it clear to them Lord as they set it on the shelf and perhaps pray about it Lord maybe Ponder the things that were spoken the examples in the Bible Lord I pray that you'd make it clear to them because Lord you are not the author of confusion you are the god that separates Darkness from light Lord we thank you for bringing us into more light we love you we commit oursel to you commit this church to you commit the the the the the whole whole body of Christ into your hands that wherever we're at in our frame of mind bring us into that frame of mind of just completely believ in your word when you speak to us praise you thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God is so good to us we're g to make it we're going to make it by the SP Spirit of the Lord will make it through Jesus said he'd make a way if the spirit we obey we're going to make it all the way we're going to make it we're going to make it by the spirit of the Lord will'll make get through Jesus said he'd make a way if the spirit we oy we're going to make it all the way one of the few I am one of the few of the few yes I'm one of the few and by faith in God's word I can claim it though the way may seem long and the opposition strong for the bride there's a way provided if I plan to go through just to hope will not do I must be firmly decided to follow the Lord by obeying his word and believe that I'm one of the few I am one of the few yes I'm one of the few and by faith in God's word I can claim it though the way may seem long and the opposition strong for the bride there's a way provided if I plan to go through just to hope will not do I must be firmly decided to follow the Lord by obeying his word and believe that I'm one of the few
