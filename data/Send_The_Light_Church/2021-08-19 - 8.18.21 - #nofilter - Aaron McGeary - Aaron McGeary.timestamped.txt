[27:54] that brother aaron was going to be
[27:56] preaching
[27:57] i got more excited
[27:59] and i'm sorry that it wasn't announced
[28:01] but to be honest with you we just had
[28:03] had contact
[28:05] and
[28:06] i i
[28:07] heard that
[28:08] he didn't get a lot of breaks
[28:11] and i wasn't sure
[28:13] whether
[28:14] he'd be
[28:16] rather not minister and i didn't want to
[28:19] put any pressure didn't want to make
[28:20] announcement didn't want to say i
[28:22] already told the people
[28:23] i just kind of kept praying lord let it
[28:26] be lord let it be
[28:28] and
[28:29] i just want to say that the way that he
[28:31] expressed it
[28:33] that he wanted to just give me
[28:35] a break that just was like saying i love
[28:38] you
[28:39] in a you know in a real personal gospel
[28:42] way if i could say it like that and it
[28:44] just meant so much the way that he said
[28:47] it he said it's a given
[28:49] and
[28:51] i told him we need his ministry we we've
[28:54] we've missed it
[28:55] and
[28:57] i'm just thankful that he has a heart to
[28:59] want it to give and
[29:01] um
[29:03] to be a blessing to us so
[29:05] i i'm sure some of you been praying that
[29:08] it would happen
[29:09] and um let's just all get behind the
[29:12] word i know there's only a few of us
[29:13] here but i believe that there's so many
[29:16] they're going to be watching it
[29:18] and um
[29:20] let's just receive the living word amen
[29:23] uh tonight because i believe
[29:25] it's for us it's for our little group
[29:27] here
[29:28] amen let's sing only believes brother
[29:30] aaron comes to minister the word of life

[30:30] jesus is here
[30:34] all things are possible
[30:38] jesus
[30:39] is here
[30:42] praise the lord amen i believe that with
[30:45] all my heart jesus is here i'm going to
[30:47] be reading from
[30:48] romans chapter 12 in first corinthians
[30:51] chapter 12. so
[30:53] while you
[30:54] just kind of get you ready to turn to
[30:56] those places romans 12 and 1st
[30:58] corinthians 12. it's a blessing to be
[31:00] here this evening
[31:02] be together with you and see you out to
[31:04] the house the lord and it's nice to see
[31:06] um
[31:07] different ones stepping into positions
[31:09] and helping out and relieving others and
[31:11] assisting whether it be on the sound in
[31:13] the video or in song leading brother
[31:15] mark leading songs i think that's
[31:17] wonderful
[31:18] that god opens up those opportunities
[31:21] you know i thought about it if we all
[31:22] went to the same church just think of
[31:23] how many gifts
[31:25] would uh not be exercised and have
[31:26] opportunities to be used just because
[31:28] there's only so many different you know
[31:30] spots so many different places
[31:32] and so it's wonderful that god provides
[31:34] uh bodies of christ all around the world
[31:36] to use gifts
[31:37] and to cultivate them
[31:39] and we really meant it in our hearts we
[31:41] actually didn't even we didn't even
[31:42] bring a suit or anything like that
[31:44] because you know we were kind of
[31:45] thinking that maybe we would come
[31:47] and not be and not have to preach um but
[31:49] it really was in our hearts to give
[31:51] brother john the break we know he works
[31:53] um full-time over time just as a in his
[31:56] shop there and then also as a pastor he
[31:58] takes probably just about every single
[32:00] service so we wanted to it's been what
[32:02] we've been doing for over 20 years now
[32:03] as a matter of fact this past
[32:05] monday was it was the 20th anniversary
[32:07] of
[32:08] 21st and our 20th anniversary of meeting
[32:10] elizabeth that's the way i look at it
[32:12] and uh so we ended up preaching that
[32:14] night too but um we uh been coming for a
[32:17] long time a couple decades and we've
[32:18] always felt in the heart that we were
[32:20] happy to help people say oh great you're
[32:22] going on vacation i was like well i'm
[32:23] preaching every service while i'm gone
[32:25] but
[32:25] uh we were happy to do it even though
[32:27] now where we are we preach every service
[32:30] so we're like 100 services in a row or
[32:31] something like that
[32:32] but just the opportunity to preach here
[32:34] i consider it a a nice uh a break in
[32:36] itself and a great privilege to be here
[32:38] so we're really really happy to be here
[32:41] and to minister the lord really dealt
[32:42] uniquely with our hearts so we'll just
[32:43] share with what's in our in our hearts
[32:45] with you we'll read from romans chapter
[32:47] 12.
[32:48] i'd like to read verses 4 5 and 6.
[32:52] it says for as we have many members in
[32:54] one body and all members have not the
[32:56] same office
[32:57] so we being many are one body in christ
[33:00] and every one members one of another
[33:03] having then gifts differing according to
[33:05] the grace that is given to us it's all
[33:07] the same grace that's given to us but
[33:09] the gifts differ
[33:11] according to the grace that's been given
[33:12] whether prophecy let us prophesy
[33:14] according to the proportion of faith and
[33:17] then he continues on the different gifts
[33:19] but the idea is that we're all part of
[33:20] one body we've all received grace and
[33:23] different proportions of that depending
[33:25] on the gift and then
[33:27] first corinthians chapter 12
[33:31] verses 20 to 24 this is paul then
[33:34] looking at the body
[33:35] in a little bit different perspective
[33:38] romans chapter excuse me first
[33:40] corinthians chapter 12
[33:42] verses 20 to 24
[33:44] but now are they many members yet but
[33:47] one body
[33:48] and the eye cannot say unto the hand i
[33:50] have no need of thee nor again the head
[33:52] to the feet i have no need of you
[33:54] name much more of those members of the
[33:56] body which seem to be more feeble are
[33:58] necessary so he's talking about
[34:01] perception or judgment or value well it
[34:03] seems to be less more feeble or doesn't
[34:06] seem to be as strong as something else
[34:07] he says which seem to be more feeble are
[34:09] necessary and those members of the body
[34:11] which we think to be less honorable upon
[34:14] those we bestow mo bestow more abundant
[34:16] honor and our uncomely parts have more
[34:19] abundant comeliness for our comely parts
[34:21] have no need but god hath tempered the
[34:24] body together having given more abundant
[34:26] honor to the part
[34:28] that part which lacked amen let's just
[34:31] power heads in a word of prayer heavenly
[34:33] father we ask that you'd
[34:35] take these things that you've shared the
[34:36] burden that's been placed upon my heart
[34:38] and would you deliver it lord
[34:40] to the people that are gathered here
[34:42] those that stream
[34:43] having to take certain precautions or
[34:44] whatever the need may be
[34:46] that's kept them from being here lord
[34:48] we're grateful that they have an
[34:49] opportunity to stream or to archive
[34:51] we just pray that it would meet the
[34:53] target and that could only be done lord
[34:55] if we open up our hearts to receive from
[34:57] you and myself lord just open up my
[34:59] heart to be used by you
[35:01] and may each person now just take it
[35:03] upon themselves to pull
[35:05] to be attentive and to
[35:07] even strain lord
[35:09] and strive to hear your voice and to
[35:11] hear what you might be speaking to them
[35:13] we commit this to you in the name of the
[35:15] lord jesus christ amen
[35:17] amen you may be seated
[35:20] i have a a unique um
[35:22] title for tonight but as we were looking
[35:25] at paul in romans chapter 12 talking
[35:28] about the body and eat the body haven't
[35:31] been given um having different members
[35:33] and those members now having been given
[35:35] grace so every member is a recipient of
[35:37] grace but then they're being different
[35:39] ministries as that's been given out and
[35:40] he talks about different ministries that
[35:42] are within the body
[35:43] so you can all be a member within one
[35:45] body but have different roles and
[35:47] different
[35:48] different requirements and expectations
[35:49] of you
[35:50] and then in
[35:52] first corinthians chapter 12 he begins
[35:53] to talk about how there's some that seem
[35:55] to be more feeble within the body or
[35:58] some that we think to be less honorable
[35:59] or the uncomely parts and he's talking
[36:02] about our perception and how we perceive
[36:04] things and in doing he's talking about
[36:06] you know he's really addressing that um
[36:09] our perception and well you look at some
[36:11] to say well this is a weaker thing or
[36:13] this one and he's actually dealing with
[36:14] our value judgment like well this one's
[36:16] not as necessary as another part
[36:19] and in doing that he's talking about
[36:20] what we see and then the thought process
[36:22] we have behind it and so you know this
[36:25] might uh there might only be one person
[36:27] here who can even get my title and
[36:29] that's hashtag no filter and it might be
[36:30] brother marks i'm glad he's on the front
[36:32] row
[36:33] because i've i've noticed uh
[36:35] maybe i'll just share a little bit of my
[36:36] heart i've been ministering
[36:38] on
[36:38] a series over a number of weeks
[36:42] at the church in arizona and it was on
[36:44] in the beginning god created a family
[36:47] and it was took in the beginning god
[36:49] created and then a family we're looking
[36:51] at god's image of a family brother bam
[36:54] talked about a true family and he talks
[36:56] about how true family is everyone's in
[36:58] harmony and everything's in order and
[36:59] the husband and wife are on the same
[37:01] page and you read this picture he talks
[37:03] about this picture of god and how true
[37:05] family is a portrait of god
[37:07] and you you could read that immediately
[37:09] begin to think well i guess we'll never
[37:10] be a true family and you kind of start
[37:12] thinking well i guess it'll never work
[37:13] for us
[37:14] and a lot of times it's only because
[37:16] this pressure this expectation we begin
[37:18] to put on ourselves and i really
[37:20] sensed um just even people getting tense
[37:23] and getting nervous when you get begin
[37:24] to talk about certain issues you preach
[37:26] about holiness you know certain people
[37:27] start getting complexes or you you start
[37:29] talking about certain standards you
[37:30] preach about tithes and offerings and
[37:32] everybody starts getting really nervous
[37:33] and a lot of times it's just our
[37:34] perception of things it's how we view
[37:36] things it's kind of our what we think
[37:38] everybody else is thinking and the value
[37:40] system and god dealt with my heart to
[37:43] uh look at the subject of no filter from
[37:46] the standpoint of removing any filters
[37:49] or any any preconceived ideas that we
[37:51] might have
[37:52] that hinder
[37:54] us from seeing the true word of god and
[37:57] ultimately from being the true word of
[37:58] god from really just expressing the word
[38:00] as it ought to be expressed
[38:02] and so is our title is no filter we have
[38:04] this hashtag it's hashtag no filter and
[38:08] what i'm doing basically is utilizing a
[38:10] social media tool
[38:12] to address um our conception of church
[38:15] how we perceive church our concept of
[38:17] church and also our concept of family
[38:20] and even our personal testimony as we we
[38:22] test we believe in our hearts to be a
[38:24] christian we want to have this
[38:25] profession of being a christian and how
[38:27] sometimes we feel that we've got to
[38:28] present ourself in a certain way to
[38:30] maintain that testimony so the kind of
[38:32] pressure is to have a particular image
[38:34] or to line up with something that we've
[38:36] seen within an example before us or
[38:38] somebody else that we
[38:40] admire as a christian
[38:42] and a hashtag and we might say pound it
[38:44] might look like pound no filter but it's
[38:46] a hashtag
[38:47] um it's a label for content if you're
[38:49] posting something in a form or posting
[38:52] something uh
[38:53] on twitter or even instagram in
[38:55] different places and i'll probably deal
[38:56] with instagram more than others other
[38:58] platforms tonight but if you hashtag
[39:01] something it allows you to search for it
[39:03] more easily it can connect you to
[39:05] certain topics and so if you wanted to
[39:07] you wanted to tweet about how good your
[39:09] pizza was last night you might tweet and
[39:10] say you know hippos has got great pizza
[39:13] hashtag fenton
[39:15] hippos hashtag pizza or something like
[39:17] that and it gives people who want to
[39:19] follow those tags and follow those
[39:20] subjects it kind of brings it calls
[39:22] attention to it it's a way of organizing
[39:25] thoughts or promoting certain ideals so
[39:27] you begin to understand what a hashtag
[39:29] no filter might be
[39:31] and so in using uh what a hashtag might
[39:33] be and using this one no filter
[39:36] i i'm just i the way it was dealt with
[39:39] my heart was to address certain
[39:41] expectations and pressures that we have
[39:43] an expectation that we might have with
[39:45] respect to certain standards of pressure
[39:46] that we might feel
[39:48] and perceptions when it comes to what if
[39:50] what a family true family should look
[39:52] like and then also by extension just by
[39:55] the pressures and expectations our
[39:57] perception of what a church should look
[39:59] like how church should be operated what
[40:01] it should look like and what kind of
[40:03] building it should have or uh what kind
[40:05] of people it should have in it or how
[40:07] when it should have service and how long
[40:09] service service should be there's a lot
[40:10] of different ways that we have filter
[40:12] what we're seeing and even filter our
[40:14] perception of things and we kind of put
[40:16] this pressure on ourselves in doing it
[40:19] we say well a christian ought to be a
[40:20] certain way and so we feel like well if
[40:22] we don't line up to that we get
[40:24] complexes or we think well a christian
[40:26] ought to be a certain way and so we
[40:28] pretend to be that way
[40:29] so it's
[40:30] kind of addressing complexes and
[40:32] addressing pretense because
[40:34] we shouldn't just get in our mind what
[40:36] church should look like what a believer
[40:37] should look like and just pretend to be
[40:39] that and say well i want to look like a
[40:41] believer so i'm going to do this and i
[40:42] want to look like a christian so i'm
[40:44] going to do that
[40:45] and so
[40:46] this hashtag no filter
[40:49] that we're using here
[40:51] is uh
[40:52] it really became extremely popular it's
[40:55] very a very common hashtag but it came
[40:57] very very popular on instagram
[40:59] and it was used to kind of signal to the
[41:01] people who are viewing your post that
[41:03] the picture here hasn't been altered in
[41:05] any way like this is pure this is raw
[41:07] it's unedited there's no filter on it
[41:10] there's no visual enhancement we haven't
[41:12] put these different layers on it to make
[41:13] the sunset look more radiant we haven't
[41:15] made the sky look more blue uh we
[41:17] haven't done anything to this to uh you
[41:20] know i wish i had a filter on my body so
[41:22] that i looked slimmer in pictures
[41:25] especially when they choose to stand
[41:26] right by you at a table and they do the
[41:28] table shot you know don't be bold enough
[41:30] to say no go around go the other side
[41:32] because that's what i do now they're
[41:33] going to stand if i'm sitting here and
[41:35] they want me to be looking like this and
[41:36] the camera's going right here i know
[41:37] what i'm going to look like
[41:39] by forced perspective i'm looking
[41:40] exponentially larger than how big i
[41:42] already am so i'll say no no you go over
[41:44] there take it from over there i don't
[41:46] care who's sitting over there because i
[41:47] realize by this perception i could be
[41:49] perceived to be even bigger than i
[41:51] really am
[41:52] and so this is how people will take a
[41:54] picture and then it's not good enough
[41:57] just the way that it looks you have to
[41:58] add filters to it and change it and crop
[42:00] it and
[42:01] and photoshop it might be a word that we
[42:03] might be more familiar with in order for
[42:05] it to look more engaging and all of us
[42:07] on our phones now you take a picture
[42:09] what do you do you immediately go to
[42:10] edit and you choose enhance
[42:13] right you want a dynamic or cool or a
[42:17] hipster filter or something like that
[42:18] because you want it to you want it to
[42:20] look more engaging
[42:22] and so i want to talk about this concept
[42:24] and do so maybe just get us to think
[42:26] about certain things in our minds
[42:27] but my point really my burden behind it
[42:30] is just so that we could be honest with
[42:32] ourselves
[42:33] about how we all have struggles right
[42:35] true as as individuals we have struggles
[42:38] as families things aren't always in
[42:40] harmony as churches we go through
[42:41] difficult things and we have challenges
[42:43] and we have struggles and really just to
[42:45] be honest about the realities of life
[42:48] and in doing so we don't put pressure on
[42:50] ourselves we already have a very high
[42:51] standard that we're the holy ghost is
[42:52] leading us to and we put pressure on
[42:54] ourselves because we want to look the
[42:55] part we want to fit in we don't want to
[42:57] be ostracized and we're really putting a
[42:59] lot of pressure on ourselves or we can
[43:01] put pressure on other people
[43:03] and so really my goal in looking at this
[43:05] subject is to encourage you uh not
[43:08] discourage you but just to encourage you
[43:11] and to get us to consider how
[43:13] many times we're putting pressure on
[43:14] ourselves to conform to a carnal image
[43:18] that we hear something and we get this
[43:19] idea in our mind this is what it should
[43:20] look like and and really try to
[43:22] alleviate that pressure that we're
[43:24] putting ourselves so that we can just
[43:25] trust god more and just follow his
[43:27] inspiration follow his leading so kind
[43:29] of by using this hashtag
[43:32] no filter really inspiring you to be
[43:34] genuine
[43:35] inspiring you to be honest i did what
[43:37] this is me this is who i am i i feel
[43:39] like i can be myself and in being myself
[43:41] you know who i am you know where i'm at
[43:44] and it gives an opportunity for iron to
[43:45] sharpen iron it gives an opportunity to
[43:47] pray for one another and it gives us an
[43:49] opportunity to grow in christ
[43:51] and have testimonies
[43:53] uh people see a change in you and they
[43:55] see your attitude if you're always just
[43:56] playing the part and doing really good
[43:58] one day you want to testify so god did a
[44:00] great thing in my life i i used to be i
[44:03] used to be this way but you know god's
[44:04] changed me and i'm a real christian say
[44:06] well you really faked it good for 30
[44:08] years right because you're just putting
[44:10] on putting on an act but we want to
[44:11] inspire you to be genuine and honest
[44:13] but it also
[44:15] really inspire you to strive to be
[44:17] better as christians be better
[44:19] christians to be better as a family to
[44:20] be better as a church
[44:22] and i thought this might be a good place
[44:24] to start just to get us thinking about
[44:27] perception
[44:28] and this idea of no filter here you have
[44:30] i don't know if this
[44:31] yeah i don't think that would work but
[44:33] i'm so i'm close enough just
[44:34] to point
[44:37] but here's a family picture how many
[44:39] love family pictures
[44:41] really all the sisters saying amen
[44:42] brother oh brother marty likes family
[44:44] pictures you're blessed sister kathleen
[44:46] your husband loves family pictures
[44:48] that's a rarity you're a unicorn is what
[44:50] they'd call you it just doesn't come
[44:52] around often
[44:53] um elliot looks like he's got something
[44:54] on his chin i don't remember that in the
[44:55] original but
[44:57] um
[44:58] this looks it looks nice right i didn't
[45:00] plan the green gingham to match uh match
[45:03] the photos here but
[45:05] everything looks really nice and pretty
[45:07] but we've all done family pictures
[45:09] before
[45:10] it's chaos
[45:13] it's ear twisting it's bribing with
[45:15] candy
[45:16] it's weeks of shopping it's trying on
[45:18] this and trying on that and you hike up
[45:21] a mountain to find the perfect spot
[45:23] and everyone's all dusty and dirty and
[45:25] you're asking the photographer the whole
[45:27] time you can photoshop that out right
[45:28] you can photoshop that out
[45:30] and i thought they're going to do more
[45:32] with my head than make it a beacon of
[45:33] light there but
[45:35] i wanted a little bit more hair on top
[45:37] but this is what we get as far as the
[45:39] final picture but really this is what it
[45:41] looks like
[45:42] right
[45:43] jack has tried missed his nose and it's
[45:46] picking between his eyes preston's got
[45:48] something in his mouth eliza is about to
[45:50] bite her tongue off elliot is missing
[45:54] i'm looking at something with the weird
[45:55] look on my face face elizabeth does not
[45:58] look happy look how close the prickly
[45:59] pear is this is a dangerous situation
[46:02] and
[46:04] this is you know jack's picture perfect
[46:06] right all the time but you know all
[46:07] sorts of stuff going on here this one i
[46:10] really really like because i elliot must
[46:12] have said something that really really
[46:14] bothered me
[46:15] uh and elizabeth look at the look on her
[46:17] face preston's thinking about fishing
[46:20] um oh eliza is literally clutching
[46:22] pearls like oh how could you say that
[46:26] and uh
[46:27] and here we're eating and
[46:29] you know picking off cactus needles off
[46:31] of preston and this is what getting
[46:34] pictures looks like i mean this is the
[46:36] back what we see right
[46:39] is this
[46:40] this is what everybody gets in the
[46:41] christmas card but there's so much more
[46:43] going on
[46:44] there there's months of planning that
[46:46] goes into it by the wife
[46:48] there's hundreds of dollars that is
[46:50] spent on the outfits and and there's a
[46:52] lot of work put into it hundreds of
[46:53] dollars spent on the photographer and
[46:56] this is we go through all this dusty and
[46:58] dirty to come up with this
[47:01] so this is what everybody sees
[47:03] but if you've been through the process
[47:05] you know this is what's happening
[47:08] one picture is mailed out at the end of
[47:09] the in christmas time but there's a
[47:11] hundred that are taken
[47:13] and of the 100 sometimes the one that
[47:15] sent out i was like well i guess this
[47:16] will have to do because we're not doing
[47:17] this all over again
[47:18] it's not even the one you really want
[47:21] and that's just that's kind of what's in
[47:22] my mind when we think about
[47:25] no filter
[47:27] is that we think of a family we think of
[47:29] a church and we've got this
[47:30] picture-perfect idea in our minds of
[47:33] what something's supposed to look like
[47:34] and what it's supposed to be
[47:36] and we ought to consider that not we
[47:38] don't know the process behind what we're
[47:41] looking at right we don't know what it
[47:43] what goes into bringing forth that image
[47:45] even a true image we can look at and
[47:47] think oh well it should be this way it
[47:48] should be that way or oh my look at that
[47:50] i want to be that but we don't know the
[47:51] process that went into it to get there
[47:54] and if you want to take over the
[47:56] slideshow from there i think from there
[47:57] you might just be able to follow along
[47:59] or i might try to help a little bit if
[48:01] that conflicts it's not going to not not
[48:03] going to bother me at all
[48:05] but let me just continue just to dive
[48:07] into this i feel very comfortable just
[48:08] to go whichever direction the lord would
[48:10] lead
[48:11] but as we're talking about uh using this
[48:14] social media hashtag
[48:16] you know church and even teaching
[48:18] doctrine things that are taught here at
[48:20] the church and things that your pastor
[48:21] feels led in his heart to address and
[48:23] even difficult subjects and things that
[48:25] raise the standard and things that kind
[48:27] of allow that looking that uh microscope
[48:30] to come over our lives spiritually this
[48:31] holy spirit begins to examine certain
[48:33] things in our lives
[48:34] at church and chur relationships at
[48:37] church should never create the same
[48:39] negative dynamics that social media does
[48:42] and that social circles do
[48:44] and you may be able to recall when you
[48:46] were in high school or in school and you
[48:47] had certain clicks and you were part of
[48:49] a certain group and you know the peer
[48:50] pressure that came along with that and
[48:52] you know the social dynamics that work
[48:54] to kind of cause us to be a certain way
[48:56] and act a certain way if you're on the
[48:58] football team you need to fit in with
[48:59] the jocks if you're if if you find
[49:01] friends in this group you need to fit in
[49:02] with that and we know the pressures that
[49:04] come socially in social circles and
[49:07] there's a lot of negative nasty dynamics
[49:09] when it comes to social media
[49:12] and
[49:13] this whole idea of a hashtag no filter
[49:17] i began to spread on instagram because
[49:20] every single post on instagram is
[49:22] carefully curated
[49:24] even when they say oops didn't mean to
[49:25] take that picture
[49:27] they spent hours taking that picture
[49:30] everything is meticulously planned and
[49:32] every post is heavily edited um all on
[49:35] social media with the intent to really
[49:36] let's just be honest deceive right to
[49:39] make you think something is a certain
[49:41] way and it's perceived a certain way in
[49:43] and because people engage on this
[49:45] platform they begin to post pictures
[49:47] they want everyone to think that every
[49:48] meal is picture perfect and every
[49:50] vacation is just uh stunning and every
[49:53] day is beautiful and everything is
[49:55] instagramable instagram living in
[49:57] instagram life and what happens is it
[49:59] put puts pressure on the person
[50:02] uh who is posting to produce content
[50:05] like you always got to have a new post
[50:07] it's got to look good and it puts
[50:08] pressures on the followers to
[50:10] participate and say oh that's great and
[50:12] and respond and everyone begins to
[50:14] engage and really it creates a lot of
[50:16] pressure for the people who are
[50:17] following it creates a lot of pressure
[50:19] for the poster
[50:21] and the um
[50:23] am i am i lost here am i no longer in
[50:25] control
[50:26] i realize now that there could be some
[50:28] confusion
[50:30] instagram here we go
[50:32] i want to read to you some things that
[50:33] they say about instagram i read a book
[50:35] about instagram
[50:37] a couple years ago it was really really
[50:39] staggering they said that there was
[50:40] early design choices that led to a
[50:43] culture of perfection
[50:45] like this is if you're on the platform
[50:48] it creates this culture of perfection by
[50:50] signaling to users that to post on
[50:52] instagram is to enhance and in turn to
[50:55] deceive
[50:57] these are some ideas that they say that
[50:59] are in this whole uh within this
[51:01] platform instagram it gave users
[51:03] permission to present the reality as
[51:06] more beautiful than it actually was
[51:09] this is what's happening on uh uh when
[51:11] you people engage on this platform when
[51:13] they're posting pictures and they're
[51:15] posting content it says instagram
[51:18] isn't designed as a neutral technology
[51:20] it is a carefully crafted experience
[51:24] and interesting
[51:25] is it is designed to shape behavior and
[51:29] create emotional attachment
[51:31] this is this is kind of the genesis of
[51:34] instagram and this is kind of what the
[51:36] uh the pressure that came with it the
[51:38] idea behind the app and i know for some
[51:39] of you thinking oh my goodness don't
[51:41] even know what instagram is but
[51:44] i'm just introducing this concept in
[51:46] social media because i think there's
[51:47] things that uh bleed out into our
[51:49] everyday lives
[51:51] and these are they're capitalizing on
[51:52] human emotions and human desires and
[51:54] human biases and so this is the this is
[51:57] what this app was preying on this is
[51:59] what it was promoting a culture of
[52:00] perfection and and to enhance things and
[52:03] enhancing things you're deceiving and
[52:05] you're given permission
[52:07] to present a different reality
[52:09] to make it look more beautiful than it
[52:10] actually is and so it's not meant to be
[52:12] neutral it's meant for you to carefully
[52:15] create an image and then yourself become
[52:18] a part of it to where you almost feel
[52:19] like you're living a different kind of
[52:21] life
[52:22] and kevin systrom who was the co-founder
[52:24] of instagram he he made a pretty funny
[52:26] remark he said instagram is not for
[52:28] half-eaten sandwiches
[52:30] in other words it's it's it's instagram
[52:33] is built for that picture of the lobster
[52:35] roll that makes it look like i don't
[52:37] even like lobster but i want to bite
[52:39] into that yeah
[52:40] i don't even like those things and i
[52:42] want to eat that i don't even like spicy
[52:43] food but that looks beautiful and if
[52:45] anything you've noticed things nowadays
[52:47] are so out of control whether it be ice
[52:50] cream or milkshakes or whatever all to
[52:53] please the eye
[52:54] and you're looking like man that steak
[52:56] looks good you know but probably doesn't
[52:57] taste good at all
[52:59] right but it looks good right the char
[53:01] is there all the colors are there
[53:03] everything looks perfect and it's meant
[53:05] to be that way
[53:06] it's because it's meant to present
[53:08] something even when you think about it
[53:09] instagram is not for half eaten
[53:11] sandwiches
[53:12] the reality is it's only to present the
[53:14] idea of a really good sandwich but not
[53:17] to actually be really good enough to eat
[53:19] right
[53:21] and it's the bible talks about it it
[53:23] says in ecclesiastes chapter one verse
[53:25] eight all things are full of labor
[53:28] man cannot utter it notice this phrase
[53:30] the eye is not satisfied with seeing nor
[53:32] the ear filled with hearing
[53:35] this is why instagram can be so
[53:37] successful by creating this
[53:39] uh this culture of perfection and
[53:41] everything becoming
[53:42] in shaping our behavior and creating an
[53:45] emotional attachment is because by
[53:46] nature we constantly desire greater
[53:48] fulfillment right right it's true we
[53:51] constantly desire to be sensitized and
[53:53] to be
[53:54] thrilled and to be satisfied and and to
[53:57] feel i feel a sense of pleasure and this
[53:59] is exactly what the bible is saying by
[54:00] nature the eye once it sees isn't
[54:03] satisfied and seen it wants to see more
[54:05] the ear once it here is not satisfied
[54:07] with hearing it wants to hear more and
[54:09] so certain things become addictive
[54:12] certain things become insatiable or i
[54:14] need more i need more i need more i need
[54:15] more and that's just the nature of man
[54:17] right just his nature you can't just do
[54:19] something one time oh well that was fun
[54:21] there's certain things that become a
[54:23] culture and it kind of gets into an ear
[54:25] worm or whatever it might be and you
[54:26] want more and you want more
[54:28] and with just respect to instagram it
[54:31] says that instagram was in the uk public
[54:34] health united king of public health in
[54:36] 2017 named instagram the worst app for
[54:40] mental health of young people wow
[54:43] and the reason why is because mental
[54:45] health experts were identifying this
[54:47] concern of the harmful impact of
[54:49] unrealistic images that are being
[54:52] presented in the media
[54:53] because somebody does something like i
[54:55] wish i had that life i wish i could eat
[54:57] where they eat i wish i could vacation
[54:58] where they're at vacationing but what
[55:00] was happening is people are posting
[55:02] these filtered images they're they're
[55:04] actually posting edited versions of
[55:06] themselves right it's true i found that
[55:08] somebody is takes a picture of
[55:11] themselves and filters it and changes it
[55:13] so much that when they look at instagram
[55:15] like oh wow that looks beautiful but
[55:17] when they see themselves in the mirror
[55:18] like i don't look like i look on
[55:20] instagram and it actually creates low
[55:22] self-esteem
[55:23] creates anxiety it creates creates
[55:26] pressure and really maybe for a church
[55:28] like this that um is really strong in
[55:31] the word and has a tremendous foundation
[55:32] and good teaching we might find that
[55:34] these things don't exist among young
[55:37] people or within our church where you
[55:39] have a strong instagram presence and
[55:40] everybody's trying to taunt one another
[55:42] with their vacation plans this year and
[55:44] where they went and what they're eating
[55:46] that may not exist at all in in this
[55:48] church but the same dynamics work
[55:50] elsewhere
[55:52] where you see something you perceive
[55:53] something you want to be something and
[55:55] you want to meet a certain standard or
[55:57] fulfill a certain role and it creates
[55:59] anxiety and it creates pressure
[56:01] so we're just kind of looking at this
[56:02] example within social media that we
[56:04] might be able to identify with and
[56:05] realize it's taking over the world right
[56:08] i don't think you could hardly go
[56:09] anywhere in public anymore without
[56:10] seeing somebody doing something really
[56:12] weird like what are they doing they're
[56:13] tick-tocking
[56:15] right they got a camera sitting
[56:16] somewhere and they're doing some dance
[56:17] and doing something people say is cool
[56:19] and what you should be doing and
[56:20] everyone's playing to the camera
[56:22] everyone's playing to social media
[56:24] everyone's wanting to live a life and
[56:25] curate a life and experience that seems
[56:27] really really beautiful really really
[56:29] engaging but then in the reality of and
[56:31] what the person knows is this isn't life
[56:33] this isn't really
[56:34] how i'm living and it creates such a
[56:36] pressure and such a
[56:38] uh
[56:39] and it doesn't promote real happiness
[56:41] real joy and real liberty in proverbs
[56:45] chapter 31 verse 30 it says favor is
[56:47] deceitful and beauty is vain
[56:50] and then i love the the contrast to it a
[56:52] woman that feareth the lord she shall be
[56:54] praised
[56:55] so favor it means charm or acceptance
[56:58] charm or acceptance is deceitful means
[57:00] fraudulent
[57:02] fake
[57:02] favor is deceitful favor or charm or
[57:05] this acceptance is fake it leads in
[57:06] other words it leads to disappointment
[57:09] when it says beauty
[57:10] as is vain it beauty's talking about the
[57:12] elegance of shape the symmetry of one's
[57:14] features it's actually talking about
[57:16] someone who's they have they're very
[57:17] proportional in their face and they got
[57:19] a really nice jawline and
[57:21] even their body or their shape it says
[57:22] this beauty this proportion of parts
[57:25] is uh is is vain
[57:28] the bible's making this uh making this
[57:30] declaration beauty and favor give a
[57:32] false representation of the person
[57:34] favor is deceitful and beauty is vain it
[57:37] can it's this is a really tremendous
[57:39] statement in our proverbs that the
[57:41] symmetry and proportion of parts the
[57:43] natural or even artificial beauty uh it
[57:46] can is vain
[57:48] all right the beauty of something you
[57:49] may look wow that is beautiful but it's
[57:51] actually uh not it's deceitful or wow
[57:54] that they look strong or they look
[57:56] pretty or they they have a particular
[57:58] appearance they must be really happy
[58:00] they must be really successful they must
[58:01] be really healthy but that's not the
[58:03] case all the time right it's true
[58:05] even finding nature some of the things
[58:07] that seem to be the most beautiful or
[58:08] the things that are most harmful
[58:11] so the most poisonous plants can be the
[58:13] most beautiful
[58:15] some of the most venomous animals uh can
[58:17] be the most
[58:19] appealing to the eye wow that's a
[58:20] beautiful that's a beautiful snake i
[58:22] want to handle you or wow that's a
[58:23] beautiful plant i want to eat you and
[58:25] one could be very very detrimental to
[58:27] our health why because even in nature
[58:30] beauty is used to deceive
[58:33] that's right and in this sense as the
[58:35] writer is teaching us he's saying that
[58:37] external beauty as favors deceitful and
[58:40] beauty as vain is saying that external
[58:41] beauty can hide uh poor character
[58:44] external beauty and and a shapely body
[58:47] and nice features can hide an ill nature
[58:51] so in that way appearances are deceiving
[58:54] and so as we've spent a lot more time on
[58:57] this than we thought you might say well
[58:58] how does this relate to church
[59:01] how in the world how are we going to
[59:02] make this applicable brother aaron and
[59:04] how are you going to how are you going
[59:05] to make this applicable to family
[59:07] and i thought about that beforehand so
[59:09] we're all right we're not just going to
[59:10] sing ask for sister cheryl to get back
[59:12] in here real quick and sing take the
[59:14] name of jesus with us
[59:15] but uh we've this is this is just
[59:18] foundation for that thinking about this
[59:20] what does this have to do with church
[59:22] what does this have to do with your
[59:23] gathering as sin the light what does
[59:25] this have to do with your family and the
[59:27] way your family's arranged and the
[59:28] circumstances you've been through
[59:30] let me say this way as a church
[59:32] we don't strive for visual perfection
[59:34] amen it's true we're not striving for
[59:36] everything to look pretty for instagram
[59:38] and for everything to look just right on
[59:40] video and for everything to look just
[59:41] right in pictures if we were doing that
[59:43] church could be a lot shorter right yeah
[59:45] right because we just get everything
[59:47] lined up just right just to look just
[59:48] right and feel just right and snap just
[59:50] the perfect picture put a nice filter
[59:52] over it post it to send the light on
[59:54] instagram it's a hashtag great service
[59:57] this morning our pastor rocks and
[59:59] everybody looks like ah i wish we went
[1:00:01] to that church
[1:00:02] right
[1:00:04] we're not striving for visual perfection
[1:00:06] amen within our families we're not
[1:00:07] striving for everyone to look at us when
[1:00:09] we show up at church and everyone gets
[1:00:10] out wearing gingham shirts they'll be
[1:00:12] like isn't that family cute all
[1:00:14] everyone's nice and dressed well and
[1:00:15] everything looks good that's not what
[1:00:16] we're striving for
[1:00:18] teaching and even the doctrines that we
[1:00:19] hold precious to our hearts and if i say
[1:00:22] this way when we present a scriptural
[1:00:23] image when we teach things from the
[1:00:25] bible teach things from the word of god
[1:00:27] it's not an exercise of posting a
[1:00:30] filtered picture
[1:00:32] it's not an exercise of just trying to
[1:00:33] achieve a certain look or have a certain
[1:00:35] image
[1:00:36] and we can
[1:00:37] this is the way that i begin to ponder
[1:00:39] it and realize that it works on us is in
[1:00:41] our minds
[1:00:43] when something is preached we can create
[1:00:45] an expectation based upon what we
[1:00:47] perceive to be the desired result amen
[1:00:50] right
[1:00:51] brother bruce or brother john or any
[1:00:53] minister here can preach something and
[1:00:55] in preaching it uh we hear we hear the
[1:00:57] quote read or we hear the scripture and
[1:00:58] we hear the teaching and then as we're
[1:01:00] hearing it we're filtering it
[1:01:02] right it's true so we're putting a
[1:01:03] filter on it and we think oh well this
[1:01:05] is what it must look like or this is
[1:01:07] what it should be and and this is what
[1:01:09] i'm being told i need to become and we
[1:01:11] can just filter things as they come
[1:01:13] right true and so we create these
[1:01:14] unrealistic expectations based upon the
[1:01:17] filter that we're putting between the
[1:01:19] image and what's being preached we're
[1:01:21] actually the one putting up the filter
[1:01:23] and it creates an unreasonable
[1:01:24] expectation on our part or we could be
[1:01:26] creating
[1:01:27] unrealistic expectations based upon what
[1:01:30] we perceive to be the ideal christian
[1:01:33] right what we what we so we're filtering
[1:01:35] what we hear but then we also it's what
[1:01:37] we look at and what we're perceiving and
[1:01:39] we create these expectations based upon
[1:01:40] what we think to be the perfect family
[1:01:43] what we think to be the perfect church
[1:01:45] and there's a lot of things that people
[1:01:47] and i realize that saying this here
[1:01:50] i wouldn't say that it misses the mark
[1:01:51] but maybe i should at least get some
[1:01:52] real hearty amens there's a lot of
[1:01:54] people that choose their church based
[1:01:56] merely upon appearances right that's
[1:01:58] right
[1:01:59] oh i i want to go to church where
[1:02:01] there's a really dynamic youth group or
[1:02:02] i want to go to church where they've got
[1:02:04] a nice choir i want to go to church that
[1:02:06] looks like a church and they say these
[1:02:08] things because they think about what
[1:02:10] other people are going to see what is it
[1:02:11] going to look like and how people are
[1:02:13] going to perceive it and in some ways
[1:02:15] they're just using the pinterest idea of
[1:02:17] church they're using an instagram idea
[1:02:19] of church it's got to look good it's got
[1:02:21] to have a certain feel to it it's got to
[1:02:23] have a filter on it it needs to be
[1:02:25] hipster it needs to be vintage it needs
[1:02:27] to be shabby chic or whatever you want
[1:02:29] it to look good
[1:02:31] and so that's what you go that's what
[1:02:32] you put into church
[1:02:34] and these are things that we put
[1:02:35] pressures on ourselves
[1:02:38] and so we must be very careful
[1:02:40] about
[1:02:41] you know church ideation or family
[1:02:44] ideation where we have this certain uh
[1:02:46] image and we that things ought to be and
[1:02:48] we really need to be careful about uh
[1:02:50] idolizing certain churches that's true
[1:02:52] that's right you hear of a certain
[1:02:54] church you hear of a work a brother is
[1:02:55] doing or you see a ministry that has
[1:02:57] been successful for many many years and
[1:02:59] what it achieves and you look at it and
[1:03:00] say oh that's the way i want our church
[1:03:03] to be or you you look at one particular
[1:03:05] church like oh that's the church that's
[1:03:07] the model or you look at a particular
[1:03:09] family's oh if our family could just be
[1:03:11] like that we need to be really really
[1:03:12] careful about having these ideations or
[1:03:14] these idolizations of different churches
[1:03:16] different believers different ministries
[1:03:18] and different families amen that's right
[1:03:21] because the truth is we could i we could
[1:03:23] envy someone say oh man if i could just
[1:03:25] be like brother john
[1:03:27] we could really envy a situation man if
[1:03:29] i could just work there if i could just
[1:03:30] do this if i could just be able to go on
[1:03:32] vacation like they do or go do what
[1:03:34] they're doing but then have no idea of
[1:03:35] the reality of it
[1:03:37] right that's right i remember one time
[1:03:39] we were driving by a house uh we were on
[1:03:41] one road a road trip i know that's no
[1:03:42] surprise to you all that we'd be on the
[1:03:44] road
[1:03:46] and uh well i forgot to mention one
[1:03:48] thing i i would come here and i would
[1:03:49] get vacation from there was only one
[1:03:51] thing i'd get a vacation from how many
[1:03:53] remembers what it was
[1:03:55] elliot remembers shaving
[1:03:57] and i don't shave anymore
[1:03:59] so i don't even get that as a vacation
[1:04:02] once i came out from under certain ideas
[1:04:05] of pretense and pressures and certain
[1:04:07] things that you you get around and you
[1:04:08] fellowship around and you come in
[1:04:10] contact with or you feel these pressures
[1:04:11] i realized that probably the reason why
[1:04:13] i wasn't shaving is not because of what
[1:04:14] i wanted to do but what i thought
[1:04:16] everybody else would think and when i
[1:04:17] got here i felt comfortable well no
[1:04:19] one's going to judge me here i don't
[1:04:20] have to shave and i realize you know
[1:04:21] what i don't care what other people
[1:04:23] think
[1:04:24] when it comes to a beard or no beard and
[1:04:26] so hashtag beard
[1:04:29] hashtag no shaving i don't know how long
[1:04:31] it's been but it's been months now so i
[1:04:32] don't get any vacation anymore
[1:04:35] when i come to michigan because i don't
[1:04:37] shave anyways
[1:04:39] so we were driving on one of these road
[1:04:40] trips i got lost there for a moment
[1:04:42] and we drove by this beautiful beautiful
[1:04:45] scenery very bucolic and green and it
[1:04:47] was a white
[1:04:48] farmhouse and everything was just
[1:04:50] absolutely gorgeous and we drove by and
[1:04:52] i think it had the black shutters it was
[1:04:54] white and black and elizabeth says ah
[1:04:57] i would i would love to have that house
[1:04:59] or i'd love to something like that
[1:05:01] and uh
[1:05:02] and i just and i instinctively said
[1:05:05] do you want do you want the divorce that
[1:05:07] comes with it
[1:05:09] do you want the you know the you do you
[1:05:11] want the two income family do you want
[1:05:13] the the two more the double mortgages do
[1:05:15] you what do you what do you want like
[1:05:17] you want the house but you know what
[1:05:19] came what went into it
[1:05:21] do you know what it's mortgaged by do
[1:05:23] you know what's behind it do you know
[1:05:24] what it takes to have that house and we
[1:05:26] could be showing a picture and say do
[1:05:27] you want this and god can show it to say
[1:05:29] yes yes i want that go give it to me yes
[1:05:32] right when we see a picture of a
[1:05:33] hamburger on instagram it's like yes
[1:05:36] i'll take it whatever it takes i'll have
[1:05:37] it well
[1:05:38] you don't know what's behind it right
[1:05:40] it's true
[1:05:41] and we might we might actually desire i
[1:05:43] said okay fine you can have it but then
[1:05:45] we don't ask the question wait a minute
[1:05:46] what's going to cost me
[1:05:47] right what does it take to have that
[1:05:49] and sometimes we could desire a certain
[1:05:51] lifestyle or desire to have a certain uh
[1:05:53] possession that we see that somebody
[1:05:55] else has and we don't know the sacrifice
[1:05:56] that it took for that person to have it
[1:05:59] we don't know the suffering that people
[1:06:00] go through to achieve the things that
[1:06:02] they've achieved and it's easy i could
[1:06:03] say this as young christians or young
[1:06:05] ministers or different callings in life
[1:06:07] we begin to see something say well
[1:06:08] that's what i want to be or that's how i
[1:06:10] want i want uh to look or i want to have
[1:06:14] that and you don't realize the decades
[1:06:15] of faithfulness and the decades of
[1:06:17] perseverance and discipline that's gone
[1:06:19] into someone's life to achieve that
[1:06:21] right
[1:06:22] and as young men there's we can look at
[1:06:24] families oh that brother has this this
[1:06:25] brother has that and we want to have it
[1:06:27] but you have to look at the whole life
[1:06:29] what kind of faithfulness did they have
[1:06:30] what kind of suffering did they go
[1:06:31] through and so we're really challenging
[1:06:33] this notion that when you see something
[1:06:34] you say i want to be that but do you
[1:06:36] even know what goes into it
[1:06:38] even know what's behind it
[1:06:40] because the christian life this is
[1:06:42] something i know that i'm sure has been
[1:06:43] ministered here the christian life is
[1:06:46] not one of competition and comparison
[1:06:48] that's true mother john came and
[1:06:49] preached at a church that we were
[1:06:50] attending
[1:06:52] and he preached a sermon we were there
[1:06:53] when you went ministering preached on
[1:06:54] competition you're talking about just
[1:06:56] razor sharp discernment he came and
[1:06:58] preached on the subject competition that
[1:07:00] you know it's not you don't really hear
[1:07:01] it preached on but it was just very very
[1:07:02] perfect for the situation very very
[1:07:05] beautiful
[1:07:06] and very on point and so i know that
[1:07:08] even your pastor is very sensitive to
[1:07:10] these these issues that the christian
[1:07:12] life is not one of competition when it
[1:07:14] comes to being christians we're not
[1:07:15] competing with anybody
[1:07:18] this is a war this is a fight this is a
[1:07:19] battle we understand the engage and in
[1:07:21] conflict so there's conflict but it's no
[1:07:22] competition
[1:07:24] we're not engaged in comparison and this
[1:07:27] goes for every aspect of life it goes to
[1:07:29] with respect to your holiness with
[1:07:31] respect to family with respect to church
[1:07:32] and church order
[1:07:34] it says in first corinthians chapter 14
[1:07:36] verse 26 how is it off then brethren
[1:07:39] when you come together every one of you
[1:07:41] half the psalm half a doctor and half a
[1:07:43] half a tongue half the revelation half
[1:07:45] an interpretation so everyone has it's
[1:07:47] show-and-tell
[1:07:49] you know churches i can out-psalm you i
[1:07:51] can out-hem you i can out-tongue you i
[1:07:52] cannot interpret you he says let all
[1:07:55] things be done into edifying
[1:07:57] church isn't for making a show of talent
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] uh uh the christian life isn't a
[1:08:02] competitive thing
[1:08:03] we're not competing with one another
[1:08:04] when it comes to holiness we're not
[1:08:05] competing with one another in terms of
[1:08:07] how much we prayed and how well we know
[1:08:09] our bible and what we know about the
[1:08:10] message and we wouldn't want to create a
[1:08:12] culture where people feel like they
[1:08:14] should be listening to the message just
[1:08:15] in case they're going to get called on
[1:08:17] the carpet and not know what the third
[1:08:18] pool is
[1:08:20] or create a culture in church where
[1:08:21] people feel like they gotta meet a
[1:08:22] certain standard well did you did you
[1:08:24] read your bible at two o'clock did you
[1:08:25] do that you want to create the kind of
[1:08:27] life with christ where people are doing
[1:08:29] those things because they want to
[1:08:31] we don't come to church on a wednesday
[1:08:33] night because we know that if if we
[1:08:34] don't on sunday we're going to hear
[1:08:36] about it like where were you wednesday
[1:08:37] night that's not what the kind of
[1:08:38] culture right
[1:08:40] that you want to create with respect to
[1:08:41] church and paul is dealing with this
[1:08:43] idea of making a show of talent within
[1:08:45] the church
[1:08:47] and so it shows us when he talks about
[1:08:49] this everyone comes with different
[1:08:50] things he says let everything be done
[1:08:52] under edifying let it be done to help
[1:08:55] someone else to promote somebody else's
[1:08:57] virtue to encourage them to edify the
[1:08:59] body because we are not in competition
[1:09:02] with each other right
[1:09:03] we're not in competition with anybody
[1:09:06] for that matter that's right
[1:09:07] our goal is christ we have a singular
[1:09:09] goal
[1:09:11] at its foundation and really maybe the
[1:09:13] the real core of what i'm trying to
[1:09:15] share with you uh tonight is just this
[1:09:17] real simple component
[1:09:20] that
[1:09:21] a
[1:09:22] a church is one that puts the word first
[1:09:25] it's true amen a true church a true
[1:09:27] church is one that puts the word first a
[1:09:29] true family is one where god is first
[1:09:31] where christ has the preeminence and
[1:09:33] that's what we strive for i want christ
[1:09:34] to have premise in my life whatever that
[1:09:36] expression would be for me whatever
[1:09:37] gifts and callings that would amplify
[1:09:39] whatever place that would lead me
[1:09:41] whatever it would do in my life that's
[1:09:42] what i want to promote and that's what a
[1:09:44] church ought to promote amen
[1:09:46] i've been studying this week on the five
[1:09:48] definite identifications of the true
[1:09:51] church of the living god and i thought
[1:09:53] maybe i was going to minister it tonight
[1:09:54] i thought maybe i'd minister it on
[1:09:55] sunday i'm just not sure which way the
[1:09:57] lord would lead
[1:09:58] and you find that when brother braham
[1:10:00] identifies the true church
[1:10:02] it has nothing to do with this church
[1:10:05] send the light i say it has nothing to
[1:10:06] do with it he's not identifying send the
[1:10:08] light or word of life or or this church
[1:10:11] or that church it's not identifying any
[1:10:13] particular local church he's saying you
[1:10:15] have the true church
[1:10:17] that has definite identifications
[1:10:19] and when you recognize what the true
[1:10:21] church is
[1:10:22] who she is what she stands for when you
[1:10:24] recognize these definite identifications
[1:10:26] of the true church you realize that as
[1:10:27] if you're going to be a real local
[1:10:29] church then your function is to support
[1:10:32] the true church
[1:10:34] like you can't do anything as a as a
[1:10:36] local church that would be harmful
[1:10:37] detrimental to the true church
[1:10:40] how could you be a real genuine
[1:10:42] god-established god-led local church if
[1:10:44] you do something to the detriment of the
[1:10:46] true church that's right right and
[1:10:48] brother-in-law's kind of going through
[1:10:49] that that way of laying that thing those
[1:10:52] things out and this is
[1:10:54] what's important to realize even as a
[1:10:56] within a family is you're not trying to
[1:10:58] strive to just have order and raise your
[1:11:01] children to look a certain way and do a
[1:11:02] certain thing but you're wanting to
[1:11:03] promote virtue in their heart you want
[1:11:05] to develop character in their heart to
[1:11:06] where they can make decisions on their
[1:11:08] own for with integrity and honesty you
[1:11:10] want them to come to know the lord and
[1:11:12] be led of god and to stand for truth and
[1:11:14] there's certain things you're trying to
[1:11:15] cultivate and do within the family
[1:11:17] you're doing the same thing within a
[1:11:18] church
[1:11:19] that you want people to be led of god
[1:11:22] you want them to follow the leadership
[1:11:24] of the lord you want to have confidence
[1:11:25] that when they say brother john i feel
[1:11:27] led to do this that he sees that god is
[1:11:30] leading in your life and i believe that
[1:11:31] brother john is of the character that if
[1:11:33] you said well brother john i feel led to
[1:11:35] go do this he'd say okay if you're
[1:11:36] feeling led to go do it you ought to do
[1:11:38] it but if you had any caution in his
[1:11:39] heart he'd tell you
[1:11:41] but i want you to consider this you
[1:11:42] should think about that but he's never
[1:11:44] going to put his foot down and say well
[1:11:45] if you're part of the body of christ and
[1:11:47] you if you're going to serve god you can
[1:11:48] only serve them here
[1:11:50] because that runs against the very
[1:11:52] definition of a son of god they that are
[1:11:54] sons of god are led by the spirit of god
[1:11:57] so as a church you don't try to create a
[1:11:58] culture in an environment that restricts
[1:12:00] or restrains movement and leadership you
[1:12:03] promote it
[1:12:05] and you cultivate that because it's one
[1:12:07] of the most important things that a
[1:12:08] believer should have amen
[1:12:10] as we read here in romans chapter 12
[1:12:13] and i feel like i'm running out of time
[1:12:15] i didn't note the time that i started
[1:12:17] but as we read from here
[1:12:19] let me just read this as you have it
[1:12:21] have this
[1:12:22] uh you have the
[1:12:24] the king james version before you what
[1:12:25] paul is saying is be yourself
[1:12:29] say just be yourself every one of you
[1:12:30] have received grace so if we've all
[1:12:32] received grace we just all
[1:12:34] breathe the sigh of relief and look
[1:12:36] around say nobody's better than me
[1:12:37] that's right
[1:12:38] you ain't better than me that's why you
[1:12:39] got to say it or say you know you
[1:12:40] realize hey i
[1:12:42] we've all received grace
[1:12:44] and so and then we maybe we need to
[1:12:46] remind ourselves instead of saying you
[1:12:47] ain't better than me maybe we say i
[1:12:48] ain't better than anybody else
[1:12:50] i'm not better than anybody else here
[1:12:52] we're all the same and so we don't have
[1:12:53] this pressure where i think i'm better
[1:12:55] than you or you feel i feel like i'm
[1:12:56] less than you we've all received grace
[1:12:58] and paul said we've all received it just
[1:13:00] be yourself amen
[1:13:01] if somebody preaches that doesn't mean
[1:13:03] they've had more grace than you
[1:13:05] they've just got a different proportion
[1:13:06] of it if somebody if somebody does this
[1:13:07] that doesn't there's no competition
[1:13:09] there's no one better than anybody else
[1:13:11] is he as the companion to this he says
[1:13:13] we're all members and there's some
[1:13:15] members that we think are less honorable
[1:13:16] and if you think they're less than give
[1:13:17] them double
[1:13:19] amen if they're uncommonly they're more
[1:13:20] necessary if they seem feeble they're
[1:13:23] they're even more necessary because he's
[1:13:24] changing our attitude towards having
[1:13:26] these levels and these hierarchies and
[1:13:29] we perceive that if you do this whoa
[1:13:31] you're that's that that's awesome
[1:13:34] and i if you've traveled a lot you've
[1:13:36] been in any different kind of churches
[1:13:37] there's a dynamic where it's like well
[1:13:39] there's this attitude that comes
[1:13:40] sometimes i'm not picking on anybody
[1:13:42] here i don't think i think it's pretty
[1:13:43] safe to say here but there's sometimes
[1:13:45] this cockiness and this arrogance that
[1:13:47] comes with being a deacon
[1:13:48] you've probably seen it before but he
[1:13:50] won't admit to it he's too nice
[1:13:52] and and they carry themselves like
[1:13:53] they're better than everybody
[1:13:55] because they're a deacon and it becomes
[1:13:57] a point of personal pride and ownership
[1:13:59] of it and if the pastor was to go to him
[1:14:01] and say brother you've served well i
[1:14:02] want you to step down and let somebody
[1:14:04] else step in they'd probably leave the
[1:14:05] church
[1:14:07] because they they love the social they
[1:14:10] love the status they love the symbol
[1:14:12] they love the position they're not
[1:14:13] they're really to serve and be servants
[1:14:15] they're not really seeing the need and
[1:14:16] meeting the need they get so caught up
[1:14:18] in the image of it and they create this
[1:14:21] hierarchy in these levels and you've got
[1:14:22] the church board and you have the pastor
[1:14:24] up here and really a lot of churches
[1:14:26] have just succumbed to man worship yeah
[1:14:28] right where the pastor has the prime
[1:14:30] parking spot and everything's built
[1:14:31] around the man the man the man to where
[1:14:33] we get the point to where we don't say
[1:14:35] that we go to send the light we say we
[1:14:36] go to brother john's
[1:14:38] right
[1:14:39] where do you go to church oh brother
[1:14:41] john martins well
[1:14:42] it's brother john martin's it's brother
[1:14:43] mark cosby's it's brother ron clayton i
[1:14:45] mean it's right it's brother marty's
[1:14:48] you know brother john if he ever says my
[1:14:50] church he uses he says it in the same
[1:14:51] way that you could say it right yeah
[1:14:53] right because it's your church and it
[1:14:55] has a name it's not just identified with
[1:14:57] the man it's not just identified with
[1:14:59] the pastor it's and so when paul is
[1:15:01] saying here in this this is read i think
[1:15:03] this is from the amplified he says so
[1:15:04] since we find ourselves fashioned and
[1:15:07] all these excellently formed in
[1:15:09] marvelously functioning parts in
[1:15:10] christ's body
[1:15:12] let's just go ahead and be what we're
[1:15:14] made to be
[1:15:15] amen without enviously or pridefully
[1:15:18] comparing ourselves with each other and
[1:15:20] trying to be something we aren't
[1:15:23] this is this is what paul is saying even
[1:15:26] in first corinthians chapter 14 since
[1:15:27] god has made us this way we find
[1:15:30] ourselves fashioned all these
[1:15:31] excellently formed and marvelously
[1:15:33] functioning parts in christ's body let
[1:15:35] us just be what we're made to be amen
[1:15:39] as it says in second corinthians chapter
[1:15:40] 10 verse 12 he says for we dare not
[1:15:42] compare ourselves of the number or
[1:15:44] compare ourselves with something that
[1:15:46] commended themselves
[1:15:49] but they measuring themselves by
[1:15:51] themselves and comparing themselves
[1:15:52] among themselves are not wise
[1:15:56] he's addressing how we see ourselves and
[1:15:58] this is where it's not wise because how
[1:15:59] do we most often do it probably
[1:16:01] at least i'm not as bad off as they are
[1:16:04] right that's right that's true and so
[1:16:07] god's really challenging us
[1:16:08] to take a step higher to do something
[1:16:11] more be more constantly created to do
[1:16:13] something more for the kingdom of god
[1:16:14] and in the way that we kind of defuse
[1:16:16] the conviction says well at least i'm
[1:16:18] not like that guy when's the last time
[1:16:19] he paid his ties when's the last time he
[1:16:21] went to church or at least we're not
[1:16:23] like that at least we're not like like
[1:16:24] them and what we're doing is we're
[1:16:25] comparing ourselves
[1:16:27] and we're comparing measuring ourselves
[1:16:29] by ourselves comparing ourselves with
[1:16:30] ourselves and he's saying that that is
[1:16:32] not wise
[1:16:33] what's the same comparison is the thief
[1:16:35] of joy
[1:16:36] or the death of joy when you compare
[1:16:38] yourself you're robbing yourself for the
[1:16:40] joy you can have in the lord amen but
[1:16:42] it's human nature it's human nature to
[1:16:44] want to compare ourselves so when paul
[1:16:46] says this it's not like he's he's really
[1:16:48] getting to the root of human psyche and
[1:16:50] human behavior and behavioral economics
[1:16:52] it's human nature it's our instinct to
[1:16:54] compare ourselves
[1:16:56] it's instinct to compare our possessions
[1:16:58] when we when we get out our phone and
[1:17:00] we're answering the you know when the
[1:17:01] weather alert goes off and everybody's
[1:17:02] phone in the church goes off and you
[1:17:04] pull out your iphone 4 and then the
[1:17:06] brother next you pulls out his iphone
[1:17:08] pro 12 max right
[1:17:11] and you're like and immediately you got
[1:17:13] phone envy you're like oh my goodness
[1:17:14] let me look at my iphone 4 here it's
[1:17:16] slow it doesn't work and they're opening
[1:17:18] things with their eyes you know just
[1:17:19] blink three times to send a text message
[1:17:22] to your wife and they're doing all sorts
[1:17:24] of gestures and a hologram comes up and
[1:17:26] you're just over there like i'm gonna
[1:17:28] make a phone call over here with my flip
[1:17:29] phone and we get we can feel this we
[1:17:31] compare our possessions we compare our
[1:17:33] situation well i'm having to work a nine
[1:17:35] to five you only make so much and i
[1:17:37] don't have this and i don't have that
[1:17:40] and you're comparing yourselves
[1:17:41] and just to go back to what we were
[1:17:43] talking about a moment ago
[1:17:44] you could be looking at somebody
[1:17:46] and you're comparing your beginning to
[1:17:48] somebody else's middle right true you're
[1:17:51] all discouraged where you're at but
[1:17:53] you're comparing yourself to somebody
[1:17:54] else's end and well this is just where
[1:17:56] i'm at right now in life and oh i wish i
[1:17:57] could be there you're just starting
[1:17:59] don't be too hard on yourself that's
[1:18:01] right
[1:18:01] you're in a different time of life
[1:18:03] you're doing different things god called
[1:18:04] you to do something else and sometimes
[1:18:06] we get way down the road in life and
[1:18:08] we're doing certain things and we have a
[1:18:09] certain uh things have changed and we're
[1:18:11] in a particular role and we look back
[1:18:13] and we see the young whippersnapper
[1:18:14] coming up and he's doing all sorts of
[1:18:16] things like ah well you know bless god i
[1:18:18] i remember those days you start to get
[1:18:20] bitter and critical
[1:18:21] of the young guy it's like no let him be
[1:18:23] him
[1:18:24] he's in his beginning he's learning he's
[1:18:26] doing certain things god can use them
[1:18:27] differently be happy where you are you
[1:18:29] begin to compare it's the thief of joy
[1:18:31] right it's true
[1:18:33] i was at a minister's meeting
[1:18:35] do you archive these do these are these
[1:18:37] going live to the whole world oh great
[1:18:39] but i was at a minister's meeting they
[1:18:40] don't
[1:18:41] they don't record the minister's meeting
[1:18:42] but i'll i'll preserve it here for
[1:18:44] posterity
[1:18:45] the uh uh
[1:18:47] the uh the minister there was a they had
[1:18:50] a young minister speaking an older
[1:18:51] minister speak and they had the older
[1:18:52] minister speak first and he said
[1:18:55] i'm 80 years old and he said who would
[1:18:56] you rather hear speak some 80 year old
[1:18:58] man who's been through something and got
[1:19:00] something to say or some 50 year old
[1:19:02] ain't lived nothing yet
[1:19:03] and
[1:19:04] the next guy coming up was 50 years old
[1:19:06] you know it was kind of like wow that
[1:19:08] was really on point
[1:19:09] and but that's kind of the attitude he
[1:19:11] took and what was he he was being
[1:19:13] defensive
[1:19:14] because he realizes there's young men
[1:19:16] who uh who have it's 30 more years yet
[1:19:19] to be where he is and maybe he sees his
[1:19:21] he's coming to the twilight of his
[1:19:22] ministry and his time in his ministry
[1:19:24] and his influence is fading and he knows
[1:19:26] his days aren't very long and he looks
[1:19:28] back and he's like i've already blazed
[1:19:29] this trail i've already done these
[1:19:30] things he builds up a complex against
[1:19:32] young ministers
[1:19:34] builds up a complex because what
[1:19:35] comparing right
[1:19:37] comparing yourself
[1:19:39] what does it say in first samuel 16
[1:19:41] verses 6 to 7 when it came time to
[1:19:44] choose a king
[1:19:46] that's right when samuel saw eliot he
[1:19:48] said surely the lord's anointed is
[1:19:50] before him
[1:19:51] i tall
[1:19:53] the elder the strong shoulders back and
[1:19:55] he's like this is it this is it go no
[1:19:57] further this is somebody if you tweeted
[1:19:59] this
[1:20:00] this is the next king
[1:20:02] everybody would love it
[1:20:04] everybody would retweet it it would be
[1:20:06] great there wouldn't be a false news uh
[1:20:09] warning on that this would be like this
[1:20:11] is what everybody wants
[1:20:13] but the lord said to samuel look not on
[1:20:15] his countenance or on the height of a
[1:20:16] stature because i refused him
[1:20:19] for the lord seeth not as mansive for
[1:20:22] man looketh on the outward appearance
[1:20:24] but the lord looketh on the heart
[1:20:26] saul looked like a good king
[1:20:28] tall taller than everyone else he had
[1:20:30] the appearance he had that regal look he
[1:20:32] carried himself this man is a king and
[1:20:34] certainly samuel might have seen the
[1:20:36] same thing in eliot he's like there's a
[1:20:38] tall guy here's a strong man he's a he
[1:20:39] would be older he would be wired this is
[1:20:41] it don't wait no further this is the one
[1:20:44] we want this is the one we can go to we
[1:20:46] could anoint his king but god cautiously
[1:20:48] said no don't look on the outside
[1:20:49] because remember saul looked like a king
[1:20:52] on the outside but lacked the heart of a
[1:20:54] king on the inside even to the point
[1:20:56] where the bible says they had he had to
[1:20:57] give saul another heart
[1:21:01] and what happened when the anointing
[1:21:02] left him saul was left to his own
[1:21:03] devices but here's david who had a heart
[1:21:06] after god had a heart like unto god a
[1:21:09] heart a man after god's own heart that
[1:21:11] god could anoint him and then david with
[1:21:14] his heart even though he sinned worse it
[1:21:16] would seem
[1:21:17] than saul he humbled himself and he
[1:21:19] repented because he had the character on
[1:21:22] the inside to be the right kind of king
[1:21:24] and he was the kind of king that god
[1:21:26] constantly said that if you walk after
[1:21:28] my servant david if you live like david
[1:21:30] if you serve like david i'll preserve
[1:21:32] the throne forever and actually because
[1:21:34] of david's character god made a promise
[1:21:36] that he would never take the throne away
[1:21:38] from his family
[1:21:40] not because of what he looked like
[1:21:41] because when he finally came up before
[1:21:42] sam he's like this guy
[1:21:44] yeah ready small the youngest out in the
[1:21:47] field you know walk looking after the
[1:21:48] sheep they didn't think he was important
[1:21:49] enough to be there
[1:21:51] but god looked on the inside
[1:21:54] it says in galatians chapter six verses
[1:21:55] three to four for if a man think himself
[1:21:57] to be something when he's nothing he
[1:21:59] deceiveth himself
[1:22:01] but let every man prove his own work and
[1:22:04] then shall he have rejoicing in himself
[1:22:06] alone and not in another
[1:22:10] joy will come from god's work in you
[1:22:14] that's where real happiness doesn't come
[1:22:15] from is from god's work in you not by
[1:22:17] comparing yourself to someone else
[1:22:19] then when you see god doing something in
[1:22:21] you and you see him bringing something
[1:22:22] out of you and he's performing this work
[1:22:24] in you let every man prove his own work
[1:22:26] then he'll have rejoicing in himself
[1:22:28] alone and not in another man's work not
[1:22:30] on what god's done for somebody else
[1:22:32] says this is actually one of the
[1:22:34] translations let everyone be sure that
[1:22:36] he's doing his very best for then he'll
[1:22:38] have the personal satisfaction of work
[1:22:40] well done and won't need to compare
[1:22:42] himself with someone else
[1:22:45] if you did your best
[1:22:47] then you're satisfied i did what i could
[1:22:49] i did what i could with the resources i
[1:22:51] was given and then whatever the outcome
[1:22:53] is you've trusted it to the lord and
[1:22:54] said this is what i've done but if you
[1:22:56] begin to compare to someone else
[1:22:59] or if you didn't do your best and you
[1:23:00] see someone else then you'll start to
[1:23:01] justify make excuses or you'll condemn
[1:23:04] yourself
[1:23:05] and bring yourself down so just let
[1:23:06] everyone do their best
[1:23:09] do your best
[1:23:12] and you won't have need to compare
[1:23:13] yourself to someone else
[1:23:16] when i use this no filter i don't know
[1:23:18] if it's really i it
[1:23:20] makes sense to me but i kind of feel
[1:23:21] like in
[1:23:22] some of it may be getting lost in the
[1:23:24] delivery
[1:23:25] but we're conveying this idea that we
[1:23:27] should not create the carnal image of a
[1:23:29] christian right
[1:23:30] should not create this polished
[1:23:32] look of what a christian is or what a
[1:23:34] church should be and it has this image
[1:23:36] it has these things in place and it is
[1:23:38] supposed to have certain things and
[1:23:40] someone might say well you know how many
[1:23:41] deacons do you have and how many
[1:23:43] trustees do you have and how many board
[1:23:44] meetings do you have and how many
[1:23:46] special meetings do you have and when's
[1:23:47] your annual convention and how many
[1:23:48] people did you have and all sorts of
[1:23:50] metrics like god doesn't measure
[1:23:51] anything like that matter of fact when
[1:23:53] when they wanted to count how many were
[1:23:55] in the kingdom it was something that was
[1:23:56] it was not wise
[1:23:58] it wasn't wise to count it's not wise to
[1:24:00] try to put on the show and do all the
[1:24:02] pretense
[1:24:03] and so we can create i'm just kind of
[1:24:05] addressing this don't have a carnal
[1:24:07] image in our minds
[1:24:09] of what a church should be and what a
[1:24:11] church should look like don't have this
[1:24:12] carnal image in our minds of what family
[1:24:14] should be like and what a relationship
[1:24:16] could be like and and what my life
[1:24:17] should be like in the relationship to
[1:24:19] everyone else's
[1:24:20] brother branham and that quote we
[1:24:22] mentioned in the very beginning he said
[1:24:23] a true family is one that's in harmony
[1:24:25] and in love so we can paint a picture
[1:24:27] real quick oh this is what a true family
[1:24:28] is he said the beauty of a church is the
[1:24:32] character of the people oh this is what
[1:24:34] a church should look like and we get
[1:24:36] these images in our minds but what i'm
[1:24:37] saying is don't fabricate a
[1:24:39] representation of that image in your
[1:24:41] mind and try to meet it right that's
[1:24:43] true don't filter the word as it's
[1:24:45] preached and the word is being preached
[1:24:46] to you and then you're going to take the
[1:24:47] word and you're going to rearrange it to
[1:24:49] create a picture that's not the one
[1:24:50] that's being presented and say i want to
[1:24:52] be like that
[1:24:53] that's filtered or when you see somebody
[1:24:56] else's life and you see some other image
[1:24:58] you see something to be done you look at
[1:24:59] that and you look at this filter you
[1:25:01] filter towards like oh that's what it
[1:25:03] should be like that's what it must be
[1:25:04] like that's what i want to be like
[1:25:07] because when we fabricate this image of
[1:25:09] what a church should be what a christian
[1:25:10] should be what a family should be it
[1:25:12] creates pressure to achieve
[1:25:14] only visual perfection
[1:25:18] that's all we're trying to achieve is so
[1:25:19] that it looks good in the optics
[1:25:23] and so sometimes the
[1:25:30] what it should look like we pursue the
[1:25:31] wrong image
[1:25:33] or maybe worse we think that's what it
[1:25:36] looks like and we feel like we can never
[1:25:37] do it so it paralyzes us
[1:25:39] well i guess i can never be that i can
[1:25:41] never be a christian like brother john i
[1:25:42] could never pray like brother mark i
[1:25:44] could never do this like this person and
[1:25:46] it just stymies us and it makes us
[1:25:48] become stagnant
[1:25:53] should we take a vote on who wants to go
[1:25:55] home whether we should continue my kid
[1:25:56] my children aren't allowed to vote i
[1:25:59] have we'll have the pastor vote here's
[1:26:01] some examples
[1:26:03] with you to encourage you
[1:26:06] and first kings chapter 17 verse nine in
[1:26:08] this
[1:26:10] elijah
[1:26:12] is there's a famine in the land
[1:26:15] he's been fed by these ravens
[1:26:17] and after the ravens are done feeding
[1:26:19] him
[1:26:20] in the brook the brook dries up god says
[1:26:23] arise get to zerephath
[1:26:26] which belongeth to zidane and dwell
[1:26:28] there behold i've commanded a widow
[1:26:31] woman there to sustain thee
[1:26:33] so much that we could share in it but
[1:26:35] just think of it think of it this way
[1:26:37] just be honest with what the scripture
[1:26:39] is presenting
[1:26:40] a widow woman
[1:26:42] this is a single mother
[1:26:45] right
[1:26:46] and a single mother is not the image we
[1:26:48] would have
[1:26:49] of a true family
[1:26:51] a single mother is certainly not the
[1:26:53] image that we would have of a true
[1:26:54] church
[1:26:55] here's a single mother trying to raise a
[1:26:57] child on her own that's not the image
[1:26:59] that we would have that that who god
[1:27:01] would send the prophet to to be
[1:27:03] sustained by
[1:27:04] wouldn't god send the prophet to a
[1:27:06] family that's kind of put together you
[1:27:08] know where the wife is under the
[1:27:09] headship of the husband and everything's
[1:27:11] being ruled well and everything's
[1:27:13] perfect in an order and everything is
[1:27:15] really like this the kind of has like
[1:27:16] this is something we could post to
[1:27:18] instagram and elijah's in the front
[1:27:20] front of the house saying made it to my
[1:27:22] made it to my airbnb and xerapath
[1:27:25] right and he's posting a really neat
[1:27:27] selfie and he's doing the walkthrough
[1:27:29] wow
[1:27:30] look at this and how dramatic no no here
[1:27:32] here's the rawness of it hey get up from
[1:27:35] the brook the ravens are done feeding
[1:27:36] you the brook's dried up i've called you
[1:27:38] to zaraphath oh really really tell me
[1:27:40] about the place well it's a widow woman
[1:27:42] that's about to die there's a sign
[1:27:44] they're starving to death she's going
[1:27:45] out gonna get some oil and and a little
[1:27:47] flower together and make her last meal
[1:27:48] and die and i want you to stay there
[1:27:51] i think it's not the image that we would
[1:27:53] have of the place that elijah would come
[1:27:56] and be sustained but it's what god had
[1:27:58] appointed god had appointed that family
[1:28:01] if you want to use the woman as a type
[1:28:03] of a church god had appointed that
[1:28:05] church to preserve the prophet and his
[1:28:07] ministry and let me say this to you if
[1:28:09] there's been any stigma or reproach or
[1:28:12] in your mind any weakness to uh what
[1:28:15] this uh this church that's been here for
[1:28:18] 20 years if there's been any at all let
[1:28:20] all of it get washed away all the stigma
[1:28:23] all the reproach all the carnal things
[1:28:25] that you've tried to attach to it the
[1:28:27] devil's trying to attach to it god has
[1:28:29] called you even to the world maybe seen
[1:28:32] oh a single mother church and it doesn't
[1:28:35] have this and it doesn't have this it
[1:28:36] looks like that and it looks like that
[1:28:38] god has commanded this church to send
[1:28:40] the light around the world amen
[1:28:42] and it's probably done more in missions
[1:28:44] than 98 of any other church only
[1:28:45] probably more that might i don't know
[1:28:47] any other church that's done more
[1:28:49] in terms of the consistent giving and
[1:28:51] the labor for missions overseas and to
[1:28:53] see that people have bibles and even
[1:28:55] clothes and look after the needs of the
[1:28:56] people that's been a ministry you've
[1:28:58] been a part of
[1:29:00] god had appointed
[1:29:02] that church
[1:29:04] in zarephath
[1:29:06] to sustain to preserve the prophet to
[1:29:08] sustain his ministry and brother branham
[1:29:11] said she put god before her children
[1:29:14] she put god before anything else she
[1:29:16] took the kingdom of god first
[1:29:20] really that's all we can do
[1:29:22] i can't try to be like brother marty i
[1:29:23] can't try to be like brother john i
[1:29:25] can't try to be like this person or that
[1:29:27] person i could try to i'd like to fish
[1:29:28] like brother ron
[1:29:31] and we but we can't we can't be somebody
[1:29:34] else we can just do you
[1:29:37] it's all you can do
[1:29:38] and really all we can do is put god
[1:29:40] first
[1:29:41] it's all that we would ask of one
[1:29:43] another you put god first you put god
[1:29:45] first you put god first just if each one
[1:29:47] of us can put god first that's all we
[1:29:49] can do we can't be somebody else we
[1:29:51] can't take their part oh sister
[1:29:53] so-and-so gets to play the piano sister
[1:29:54] so-and-so gets to lead songs and this
[1:29:56] one gets to sing this or gets to uh dude
[1:29:59] sunday school and this and we look at
[1:30:00] all these i'm not advocating for women
[1:30:02] to lead songs i meant to say sunday
[1:30:03] school
[1:30:04] and you have all these different
[1:30:05] positions people is like well you can't
[1:30:07] do that and this person does that and
[1:30:08] this person just do your part do all
[1:30:10] that you can do offer right if you want
[1:30:13] to do something offer that's right
[1:30:15] that's right
[1:30:18] and it's so beautiful for this widow she
[1:30:20] couldn't change her past
[1:30:22] all she could do is just put the word
[1:30:24] before as her future
[1:30:27] god had appointed her
[1:30:30] this is maybe a little lengthy but i
[1:30:31] want to read it again because it just
[1:30:32] seems such a non tr i want to read
[1:30:34] through it because it's really it kind
[1:30:35] of confronts this image of what we have
[1:30:37] of a real message believer right this
[1:30:39] pedigree this legacy
[1:30:41] and i'm i'm a fourth generation message
[1:30:43] believer and you know my father and his
[1:30:46] father and his father you know they were
[1:30:48] all you know real died in the wool
[1:30:50] message believers you know born in the
[1:30:52] tabernacle
[1:30:53] and then we think oh wow if i could just
[1:30:56] go to the gravestone
[1:30:58] and you know it's like we have these
[1:30:59] ideas of what really makes a real
[1:31:00] message believer
[1:31:02] but notice this in acts chapter 16
[1:31:04] verses 1 to 5 then came he to derby into
[1:31:07] lystra and behold a certain disciple was
[1:31:09] there named timotheus the son of a
[1:31:12] certain woman which was a jews and
[1:31:14] believed and then but his father was a
[1:31:17] greek
[1:31:18] kind of signaling to us right
[1:31:20] here's a man who was a disciple
[1:31:23] his mom was a jew but his dad's an
[1:31:24] unbeliever they're letting us know that
[1:31:27] which was well reported about by the
[1:31:29] brethren that were at leicester and i
[1:31:30] come said a good testimony good report
[1:31:32] him would paul have to go forth with him
[1:31:35] paul chose this one
[1:31:36] who was the son of a certain woman who
[1:31:38] was a jew
[1:31:39] and believed was now converted to
[1:31:41] christianity but his father is an
[1:31:42] unbeliever this is the one that paul
[1:31:44] chooses to go with him and took and
[1:31:46] circumcised him because of the jews
[1:31:48] which were in those quarters for they
[1:31:49] knew all
[1:31:51] that his father was a greek not a
[1:31:52] believer not a christian not a jew not
[1:31:54] even a christian and as they went
[1:31:56] through the cities they delivered them
[1:31:58] the decrees for to keep that were
[1:31:59] ordained of the apostles and elders
[1:32:01] which are at jerusalem and so were the
[1:32:03] churches established in the faith and
[1:32:06] increased in number daily
[1:32:09] think about timothy is called the labor
[1:32:11] side by side with paul and is part of
[1:32:13] this great uh
[1:32:15] ministry to the church establishing
[1:32:17] churches in the faith and increasing in
[1:32:18] number daily and fam timothy's family
[1:32:21] has a very unique mixture very unique
[1:32:23] structure
[1:32:24] the scripture is telling us that he's of
[1:32:26] a mixed marriage between a jew and a
[1:32:27] gentile
[1:32:29] and timothy himself by the scripture is
[1:32:31] not raised a jew
[1:32:33] so he comes from this un you know kind
[1:32:34] of a mixed marriage you have a jew you
[1:32:37] have a greek you have a gentile married
[1:32:38] to a jew you have a son that's born to
[1:32:40] the a jewish mother into a greek father
[1:32:42] he's not raised in the jewish faith he's
[1:32:44] a he's raised as a gentile now you're
[1:32:46] going to bring the word to jews and you
[1:32:48] want to establish the faith and paul is
[1:32:50] saying well let's circumcise you since
[1:32:51] we're going to be going to the jews he's
[1:32:53] got a really unique family situation
[1:32:56] from his background but notice what he
[1:32:57] says to timothy in second timothy
[1:33:00] chapter one verse five
[1:33:02] he says well when i call to remembrance
[1:33:05] the unfeigned faith that is in thee
[1:33:07] remember he had a good report timothy
[1:33:09] did
[1:33:10] he says which first dwelt and thy
[1:33:11] grandmother lois
[1:33:14] and thy mother eunice
[1:33:15] and i'm persuaded that is in thee also
[1:33:18] amen paul passes over the father because
[1:33:20] he was suggesting that he remained an
[1:33:22] unbeliever
[1:33:24] but he said it's your grandma that
[1:33:25] became a christian
[1:33:27] and when your grandmother became a
[1:33:28] christian it's through her example and
[1:33:29] her witness that your the daughter your
[1:33:32] mother became converted to christianity
[1:33:34] and now timothy you
[1:33:36] because of your grandma's faithfulness
[1:33:38] because of your mother's faithfulness
[1:33:40] now you are faithful
[1:33:42] and the husbands in this are never even
[1:33:43] mentioned
[1:33:45] could you imagine this is the story you
[1:33:46] have a woman that believes the message
[1:33:48] name lois
[1:33:49] husband doesn't ever believe but her
[1:33:51] daughter comes to know the truth of her
[1:33:53] example
[1:33:54] husband never believes the son's not
[1:33:55] even raised in the faith
[1:33:57] not even raised to believe even what the
[1:33:59] mother believed the one true god but
[1:34:01] then she converts to christianity and
[1:34:03] then one day god gets a hold of her son
[1:34:06] two generations mixed believing nobody's
[1:34:08] it's not this perfect uh lineage and man
[1:34:11] the man was in his place and fully
[1:34:13] functioning family everyone under
[1:34:14] subjection everything the token applied
[1:34:16] and that's what produced a timothy no
[1:34:18] very unique structure in timothy's
[1:34:20] family
[1:34:21] but god took the son of this mixed
[1:34:23] marriage and made him a leader in the
[1:34:24] new testament church
[1:34:26] was it poe buddies nerfed
[1:34:29] right
[1:34:31] you get it
[1:34:32] po buddy's nerfed nobody's perfect
[1:34:36] not even timothy that was gonna be the
[1:34:39] title of my sermon i think i
[1:34:40] it fell more flat than my hashtag no
[1:34:43] filter
[1:34:46] god can use dysfunction for his glory if
[1:34:48] we just yield it to him
[1:34:50] whatever the mess
[1:34:52] god can use it praise god if our if our
[1:34:54] bait casting reel has got a huge bird's
[1:34:56] nest and the lion's all tangled we can't
[1:34:58] seem to give it just hand it over to god
[1:35:01] he can use it amen
[1:35:04] god in the bible think about it
[1:35:07] the bible the bible gives us an
[1:35:08] unfiltered picture of redemption
[1:35:12] the bible gives us the unfiltered story
[1:35:14] man that's a better way to put it god
[1:35:15] gives us the unfiltered story of
[1:35:17] redemption
[1:35:18] when we look at the bible we don't even
[1:35:19] have a perfect narrative
[1:35:23] you understand what i mean it's not it's
[1:35:25] not just done in a way to where it just
[1:35:26] seems like everything's perfect and
[1:35:28] everything's clean and everything's neat
[1:35:30] god preserves the mistakes
[1:35:32] god preserves the blemishes and the
[1:35:34] failures of his people he includes them
[1:35:36] all in there and he doesn't make
[1:35:37] anything to be something that it's not
[1:35:38] and he does it all for edification
[1:35:42] and why does god allow this word even in
[1:35:44] the way that he presents it it's perfect
[1:35:47] but maybe not perfect in the way that we
[1:35:48] think perfection is
[1:35:50] it's perfect just the way he's preserved
[1:35:52] it it's perfect just the way that he's
[1:35:53] delivered it to us but when we read it
[1:35:54] we can read of mistakes we can read of
[1:35:56] blemishes we could read things and say
[1:35:58] well it says this here and it says that
[1:35:59] there but god has preserved it for our
[1:36:01] edification
[1:36:03] what does it teach us that regardless of
[1:36:04] our situation god can take our
[1:36:06] brokenness god can take our uniqueness
[1:36:08] god can take our family situation which
[1:36:10] isn't ideal god could take a situation
[1:36:12] that doesn't seem to be pure god could
[1:36:14] take a situation that seems to be
[1:36:16] hopeless and he can use it for something
[1:36:18] beautiful
[1:36:20] praise god
[1:36:21] i just i mean think about it
[1:36:23] relationships
[1:36:25] relationships are messy
[1:36:28] family dynamics can be very very
[1:36:29] complicated
[1:36:31] can be unique and challenging we can be
[1:36:33] estranged from our family we could find
[1:36:34] that church alone is our family we could
[1:36:37] find that there's
[1:36:38] people coming together and learning to
[1:36:40] respect one another and work together
[1:36:41] those things are very difficult whether
[1:36:43] you see it professionally in business
[1:36:45] and running a running a business you
[1:36:46] have different personalities and
[1:36:48] different gifts and different different
[1:36:49] abilities and ambitions
[1:36:51] and it's very difficult to harmonize
[1:36:52] that harmonize those things with a
[1:36:54] vision that you might have in business
[1:36:56] and and even with the family of
[1:36:57] different degrees of learning and
[1:36:59] different degrees of perception and
[1:37:00] different ways of disciplining you learn
[1:37:02] that you can
[1:37:03] there's ways that you would address one
[1:37:05] child that you can't address the other
[1:37:06] child the same way
[1:37:08] and it's that way in the church
[1:37:10] that's right so we can only be who we
[1:37:12] are let god deal with that person in the
[1:37:14] way that they are let god deal with that
[1:37:15] person the way that they are but then we
[1:37:17] all are just yielding saying hey i'm on
[1:37:19] my will god you're forming me you're
[1:37:21] you're doing something to me and you
[1:37:22] rejoice you see brother mark on his will
[1:37:24] you've got however god wants to mold you
[1:37:25] brother i'm with you i support you and
[1:37:28] we can support one another when we're
[1:37:29] being torn down and we're being worked
[1:37:31] over and really going through something
[1:37:32] we can kind of all experience it
[1:37:34] together but it's our experience that we
[1:37:37] were conscious of that we're yielding to
[1:37:40] and we're expecting god to do something
[1:37:41] beautiful in america
[1:37:46] so what is this
[1:37:48] i'm trying to bring this to a close i
[1:37:49] think i just have a couple more
[1:37:50] scriptures here
[1:37:52] let me just leave you with some thoughts
[1:37:53] when we say no filter it means no
[1:37:55] judgment
[1:37:57] when you say no filter means no pretense
[1:38:00] no competition no comparison amen
[1:38:03] no personal pressure on ourselves i'm
[1:38:05] not gonna pressure myself to be a
[1:38:06] certain way no political pressure to
[1:38:08] achieve change within our church no
[1:38:10] political pressure to achieve uh change
[1:38:12] within our families amen because the
[1:38:15] purpose of church the purpose of lifting
[1:38:17] up the word the purpose of teaching true
[1:38:19] teaching is not to paint the picture of
[1:38:22] the perfect family not to paint the
[1:38:23] picture of the perfect church but just
[1:38:25] to lift up scriptural promises that's
[1:38:27] right
[1:38:28] lift up scriptural truths that we can
[1:38:30] place our faith in that's right
[1:38:33] that when when divine healing is
[1:38:34] preached
[1:38:36] it's not to make the person that's sick
[1:38:38] and not healed feel bad because they
[1:38:39] haven't been healed
[1:38:41] say god by your stripes he's healed and
[1:38:43] god he paid the price for that sickness
[1:38:46] on calvary 2 000 years ago and that's
[1:38:48] not preached so the person over there
[1:38:50] who's been suffering with an affliction
[1:38:51] for many many years is like well i guess
[1:38:53] i don't have enough faith no it's
[1:38:54] continuing to lift up the truth so that
[1:38:56] that's what you put your faith in amen
[1:38:58] because in reality you're constantly
[1:38:59] being reminded by your doctor how sick
[1:39:01] you are you're constantly being reminded
[1:39:02] by by your symptoms how much pain you're
[1:39:04] in you're constantly reminded by family
[1:39:06] history everyone in your family died 62
[1:39:08] years old with a heart attack or you
[1:39:10] have diabetes you have this and you're
[1:39:11] constantly be reminded by all the
[1:39:13] negative
[1:39:14] right and so the preach of the word is
[1:39:16] not to condemn you but to preach in
[1:39:17] divine healing preaching that by your
[1:39:19] strife by his stripes you're healed is
[1:39:21] not to make you feel bad because you
[1:39:23] haven't been but to persuade you to put
[1:39:26] all your faith in that
[1:39:30] that's right
[1:39:31] it's the word giving us a path to walk
[1:39:33] in amen
[1:39:35] even a place to walk towards
[1:39:37] the preach of the word gives us a goal
[1:39:39] that we're walking towards but then is
[1:39:40] creating the path that we can walk in
[1:39:42] and remember it's always a work in
[1:39:44] progress
[1:39:46] right when we went through these family
[1:39:47] pictures
[1:39:49] try to get back there
[1:39:54] this is what it looked like right
[1:39:56] but it was always a work in progress
[1:40:00] right that's right our lives sometimes
[1:40:02] this is all we're ever seeing right
[1:40:04] like this is this is a family this is
[1:40:06] everyday life and it may never look like
[1:40:09] this
[1:40:11] we can do this for family pictures but
[1:40:12] as far as our life is concerned this may
[1:40:14] be what our life always looks like
[1:40:17] always always this
[1:40:19] never the never the image that we're
[1:40:20] striving for never what exactly what we
[1:40:22] think it should be but that's not our
[1:40:24] goal
[1:40:25] our goal at the end of the day isn't to
[1:40:26] achieve some perfect picture it's always
[1:40:28] a work in progress
[1:40:34] man i went through a lot tonight let me
[1:40:36] just get to where hey don't laugh too
[1:40:38] heartily you might get a complex
[1:40:46] we should make it our ambition to please
[1:40:48] god amen amen say our family ambition is
[1:40:51] to please god not man
[1:40:53] our church and our ambition as a church
[1:40:55] is to guide to serve not control
[1:40:58] i always appreciate it as i started a
[1:41:00] church last year as you know and the
[1:41:03] people have just been absolutely amazing
[1:41:04] i kind of feel like
[1:41:06] um
[1:41:07] god's done it maybe for my my family and
[1:41:10] my children my wife especially because i
[1:41:12] certainly haven't deserved such a
[1:41:13] wonderful group of people that have come
[1:41:14] together so beautifully and they
[1:41:16] communicate brother aaron we're not
[1:41:17] going to be there and in the beginning
[1:41:19] people are coming so frequently if they
[1:41:20] couldn't make it to church i just said
[1:41:22] hey we're here to serve not take
[1:41:23] attendance
[1:41:25] i said always love to know when you're
[1:41:26] not going to be here i think that helps
[1:41:27] me especially if you're going to do
[1:41:28] something we're expecting to be there
[1:41:30] just always give us a heads up that's
[1:41:32] great but i don't want you to do it
[1:41:33] because we're taking attendance
[1:41:36] we're just here to serve that's what a
[1:41:37] church is here to do the church is here
[1:41:39] to serve and to guide not to control so
[1:41:42] a church has an ambition and a vision to
[1:41:43] see that you succeed spiritually not
[1:41:45] that the church succeeds naturally
[1:41:49] a family has an ambition to please god
[1:41:51] paul says for do i now persuade men or
[1:41:54] god galatians 1 10 or do i seek to
[1:41:56] please men
[1:41:57] for if i yet pleased men i should not be
[1:42:01] the servant of christ
[1:42:03] he said am i preaching to get followers
[1:42:06] am i preaching just to please men
[1:42:10] he said if i if i did that if i did that
[1:42:13] just to please men if i did that just to
[1:42:15] have followers i
[1:42:17] by appearance sake it may look like
[1:42:19] i've preached and i've gained this
[1:42:21] following but really saying i'm a
[1:42:22] servant to my followers
[1:42:24] amen
[1:42:25] i've become a servant to the crowd that
[1:42:26] i've gathered around me i become a
[1:42:27] servant to the people that i brought
[1:42:29] under my ministry in my orbit and under
[1:42:32] my influence i become i it looks like
[1:42:35] i'm their head it looks like they're my
[1:42:36] slaves it looks like they're my subject
[1:42:38] but in reality you've become a slave to
[1:42:40] your crowd you become a slave to your
[1:42:42] followers and that's what happens to
[1:42:44] these influencers and their whole lives
[1:42:46] are now living they're called
[1:42:47] influencers on instagram and tick tock
[1:42:49] and these social media platforms but
[1:42:51] really who are they influenced by their
[1:42:53] followers because they've now gotta
[1:42:55] cater to the crowd they've got to grow
[1:42:56] their numbers they've got to increase
[1:42:57] their membership and paul is saying do i
[1:42:59] persuade men do i seek to please men if
[1:43:01] i did that i'm not a servant of christ
[1:43:04] so i believe that we ought to strive for
[1:43:06] scriptural perfection
[1:43:08] i believe that we ought to strive to be
[1:43:09] perfect in our lives and our families
[1:43:11] and in our church but not to impress
[1:43:13] people but to please god amen
[1:43:16] if we make decisions within our family
[1:43:17] within our relationships and our
[1:43:18] personal life if we make decisions and
[1:43:20] do things as a church to promote whether
[1:43:22] it be to promote standards or even
[1:43:24] adhere to standards for the eyes of men
[1:43:27] then we become the servant of man
[1:43:31] but our goal must be our goal is harmony
[1:43:33] harmony with the word of god
[1:43:36] that's what we want within a family
[1:43:37] harmony with the word of god love among
[1:43:38] each other what we want within a church
[1:43:40] harmony with the word of god love among
[1:43:42] each other
[1:43:43] from where from the inside amen not the
[1:43:46] outside praise god peter writes in 1st
[1:43:48] peter chapter 3 verses 3 and 4
[1:43:51] whose adorning
[1:43:53] let it not be in that outward adorning
[1:43:55] of plaiting the hair and of wearing of
[1:43:57] gold or putting on of apparel it's about
[1:43:59] the woman
[1:44:00] it can certainly be used in type of the
[1:44:02] church the the local church
[1:44:05] let's not let all of her labor and her
[1:44:07] appearance and everything just be the
[1:44:09] the plotting of the hair the wearing of
[1:44:10] gold the putting off a pair of what he
[1:44:12] is doing
[1:44:13] is he's cautioning against being
[1:44:15] consumed by what the outside looks like
[1:44:19] says but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:44:21] heart
[1:44:22] in that which is not corruptable even
[1:44:24] the ornament now
[1:44:25] from the inside the ornament of a meek
[1:44:27] and quiet spirit which in the sight of
[1:44:29] god not the perception of men not the
[1:44:31] filter man not on the instagram or
[1:44:32] pinterest but in the sight of god of
[1:44:34] great price
[1:44:36] praise god
[1:44:38] that's where you have a vision
[1:44:40] not not the filtered one but with no
[1:44:42] filter you have a vision to please god
[1:44:44] amen
[1:44:45] and i say this to you as a church today
[1:44:48] i commend you on your over 20 years now

[1:45:20] it's genuine it's authentic it's real
[1:45:23] and
[1:45:24] in re when you see it for what it is
[1:45:27] nothing else
[1:45:28] compares because it's real
[1:45:31] and i say for each of you whatever your
[1:45:33] situation has been in your families and
[1:45:34] in your life and what you're going

[1:45:38] this church has endured whatever you've
[1:45:39] gone through personally whatever hurts
[1:45:41] and pains and whatever things may look
[1:45:43] at
[1:45:44] you just take
[1:45:46] your picture
[1:45:48] the one that god has of you the one
[1:45:49] that's perfect the one that's complete
[1:45:51] the one that's whole and walk towards it
[1:45:53] by faith
[1:45:55] if you're the widow of zarephath
[1:45:57] keep walking into that ministry god's
[1:45:58] called you to keep walking forward to
[1:46:00] what god's called you to if you're a
[1:46:01] timothy you just keep walking in the
[1:46:03] things that god's called you to because
[1:46:05] it's not we're not being judged by
[1:46:07] worldly things or worldly metrics we're
[1:46:09] judging ourselves by the word of
[1:46:10] god bless you let's stand i'd like just
[1:46:13] to pray with you and turn it over to
[1:46:14] brother john
[1:46:21] if we could maybe we'll just
[1:46:24] ask the lord to help us now
[1:46:28] help
[1:46:29] lord remove all the filters our gracious
[1:46:31] heavenly father tonight as we stand in
[1:46:34] your divine presence just by this act of
[1:46:37] bowing our heads and
[1:46:39] lifting up our voice to you lord we
[1:46:41] desire that there be any
[1:46:43] filter
[1:46:45] that we've put on the word lord may it
[1:46:47] be removed
[1:46:49] lord we're even taught that the word
[1:46:51] should be our filter
[1:46:53] that there's got to be we've got to have
[1:46:55] this
[1:46:55] discipline that the word itself keeps
[1:46:58] out things that aren't pure and
[1:47:00] keeps things away from us that's harmful
[1:47:04] lord if we've used any kind of carnal
[1:47:05] filter to create an image of christ
[1:47:08] that is not true lord we pray that you
[1:47:10] take it away
[1:47:12] we've caused we've used any kind of
[1:47:14] filter man-made filter to produce the
[1:47:16] image of a christian that is not true
[1:47:19] lord we ask that you take away the
[1:47:20] filter
[1:47:21] lord if we filtered the preaching and
[1:47:23] the teaching of this church to
[1:47:25] be pointing to an image that's not
[1:47:27] accurate lord if we've if we've done it
[1:47:29] of our own doing our own accord lord
[1:47:31] remove the filter
[1:47:32] lord if we viewed other people's lives
[1:47:34] as being a desirable and what we want to
[1:47:37] achieve and we're trying to achieve that
[1:47:39] image or maybe we even remove that
[1:47:40] filter
[1:47:42] lord certainly if we filtered our lives
[1:47:44] to try to present to others that were
[1:47:45] put together and things are good and
[1:47:47] everything's fine and we've done it for
[1:47:49] pretense and for politics lord remove
[1:47:52] the filter

[1:48:01] maybe more with my personality lord i
[1:48:04] pray that it would be effective for your
[1:48:05] people
[1:48:07] may it encourage them to see that where
[1:48:09] this church stands today and what it's
[1:48:11] done and what it's labored for is never
[1:48:14] in god's eyes measured
[1:48:16] by instagram followers and
[1:48:18] pins on pinterest and circles on
[1:48:22] in social media
[1:48:24] subscribers and views
[1:48:27] or even members
[1:48:30] it's judged by whether or not we've done
[1:48:31] what we're asked to do
[1:48:34] judged by whether or not we're we're
[1:48:36] being what you've called us to be may
[1:48:38] that be our ambition as a church maybe
[1:48:39] our ambition as a family just to do us
[1:48:42] do what we're called to do be what we're
[1:48:43] called to be
[1:48:45] and not take another man's place
