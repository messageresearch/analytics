[1:28] amen
[1:30] you did you come here to receive of the
[1:32] lord this morning
[1:33] so good to see everyone's shining faces
[1:36] it's been a while since we've been able
[1:38] to preach for you and uh we're so glad
[1:40] to be able to assist brother john as
[1:42] he's enjoying i'm sure what's some much
[1:45] needed and well-deserved rest
[1:48] so we're happy to be here with you it's
[1:50] uh i think last time we were here we
[1:52] weren't here but we were in the old
[1:54] building and so now we see what the lord
[1:56] has blessed you with we've heard of it
[1:58] being the work in progress for so long
[2:00] and now we can see what the people of
[2:02] the lord have done for their god and for
[2:04] one another
[2:05] and it's just such a beautiful place so
[2:08] we were so disappointed that when the
[2:11] call came out for the dedication
[2:13] services came we had already committed
[2:15] ourselves for that date
[2:16] and another way so we're happy to be
[2:18] here and this is our first service in
[2:21] the new tabernacle with you
[2:23] so i hope that that same kind of
[2:26] sense when you had the first service we
[2:27] could have again together today and you
[2:30] just pull on the word and we'll have a
[2:31] good time together all right
[2:34] let's go ahead and go before the lord
[2:36] dear precious heavenly father we just
[2:37] come before you lord
[2:39] just desiring to be faithful to
[2:42] what you've given us lord and your word
[2:44] father me to preach it lord and all of
[2:46] us to receive it as we open your book
[2:49] lord i pray that you would
[2:50] open your heart to your people lord and
[2:53] may they open their hearts to you father
[2:56] grant it lord we pray and may you
[2:59] rule and reign the day into our hearts
[3:01] in jesus christ's name
[3:03] praise the lord if you would go ahead
[3:06] and turn over with me and we'll go
[3:07] straight into the word uh we'll go to um
[3:11] start in james chapter 1 and also on
[3:14] song of solomon
[3:16] chapter 2.
[3:19] and when you've got james one there you
[3:20] just go ahead and say amen if you would
[3:28] praise the lord
[3:30] just uh i wanted to approach the
[3:32] scripture in a little bit of a different
[3:33] way than i have in the past
[3:35] just on the plane flight last sunday and
[3:37] we just felt the lord
[3:39] dropped this thought into our heart we
[3:40] want to be faithful to what the lord's
[3:42] given us
[3:43] ever everyone have james 1.
[3:45] all right
[3:46] in james 1 it says every man is tempted
[3:49] when he is drawn away of his
[3:52] own lust
[3:53] and enticed
[3:54] and when that lust has conceived
[3:58] it brings forth sin and sin
[4:01] when it's finished brings forth death
[4:05] over in
[4:07] song of psalm solomon chapter 2
[4:10] verse 15 we have a much different
[4:12] picture where this ends on death song of
[4:16] solomon's picks up in life
[4:18] and we'll
[4:20] actually take it back to verse
[4:22] 10 for some context here song of solomon
[4:25] verse 10.
[4:28] i'm just enjoying the spring weather
[4:30] here today
[4:33] i think this song beckons to that time
[4:36] he says
[4:38] i'm sorry song two uh verse 10.
[4:46] and the bride and the bridegum are
[4:50] singing back and forth to each other
[4:51] here and she says my beloved spay can
[4:54] said unto me rise up my love my fair one
[4:58] and come away for lol the winter is past
[5:02] and the rain is over and gone
[5:06] the flowers appear on the earth and the
[5:08] time of the singing of the birds has
[5:10] come
[5:11] i i just walked outside my house this
[5:14] morning i heard those birds singing
[5:17] we're in that time aren't we we can kind
[5:19] of
[5:20] feel sympathetic towards these two
[5:22] lovers here the flowers appear the sign
[5:25] the time of the sing of the birds come
[5:26] in the voice the turtle is heard in our
[5:28] land the fig tree put forth her green
[5:31] figs and the vines with the tender grape
[5:33] give a good smell arise my love my fair
[5:36] one and come away o my dove thou art in
[5:39] the clefs the rock and the secret places
[5:41] of the stairs
[5:42] let me see thy countenance is that your
[5:45] desire this morning amen let me see thy
[5:47] countenance oh lord let me hear thy
[5:50] voice so for sweet is thy voice and thy
[5:53] countenance is comely
[5:55] take us the foxes here's the verse i'd
[5:58] like to focus on
[5:59] take us the foxes the little foxes that
[6:03] spoil the vines for our vines have
[6:06] tender grapes
[6:08] may the lord bless the reading of his
[6:10] word he may be seated
[6:12] i like to preach on little foxes and
[6:15] tender grapes this morning
[6:17] little foxes and tender grapes now just
[6:20] to give a little bit of context what
[6:22] foxes have to do with grapes because
[6:25] you're probably thinking when you read
[6:26] this first like i was that you know
[6:29] foxes they
[6:30] they eat
[6:31] live things don't they eat meat and
[6:33] they're predators what are they doing
[6:34] with little grapes but it turns out that
[6:36] foxes like to mess around with things
[6:39] they'd like to get in things they
[6:40] shouldn't and mess with things they
[6:42] shouldn't and they they gnaw on the
[6:44] little um great barbers and it causes
[6:47] the life of the grapes to fall out and
[6:49] they they dig little holes all around
[6:51] they dig up their roots with their
[6:52] little paws
[6:54] and all those naughty things that little
[6:56] foxes ought not to be doing they have a
[6:59] terrible detrimental impact
[7:02] to those tender grapes that the
[7:05] bridegroom and the bride are looking to
[7:08] share together in this season of life
[7:10] she says over here rise up
[7:13] look these tender grapes are giving
[7:15] forth a good smell arise my love my fair
[7:18] one come away
[7:20] so they're looking forward to enjoying
[7:22] these tender grapes between themselves
[7:24] but if they're not careful these little
[7:26] foxes are going to come in
[7:28] so i i think that the the heart of the
[7:31] bride today would be the same lord i
[7:33] want to enjoy your tender grapes i want
[7:36] to enjoy your sweet mercies i want to
[7:38] enjoy your sweet countenance i want to
[7:41] sit down and have as it wore a picnic
[7:43] with my god
[7:45] can you imagine a picnic with the
[7:47] creator of heaven and earth
[7:49] that's what he's placing himself in
[7:52] why else would song of solomon be there
[7:54] except it's to show us the type of a
[7:56] relationship between christ and his
[7:59] bride paul said later on i speak to you
[8:01] a great mystery
[8:03] that the church
[8:05] is like a type of the bride to christ
[8:08] and so here we see that
[8:10] god and christ and his bridegroom as it
[8:13] were are looking to enjoy a picnic
[8:16] together they've been working to bring
[8:18] forth all these grapes and no doubt
[8:20] there was a lot of work in the fall to
[8:22] clean out all the leaves and all the
[8:24] garbage and get it ready for the spring
[8:26] sunshine so that when that came they
[8:29] could enjoy the fruit of their labor and
[8:32] sit down and have rest together
[8:35] oh i believe that's what the holy ghost
[8:36] is calling us to is a rest in the holy
[8:39] ghost with christ amen oh that's what i
[8:42] want but then there's something that
[8:44] wants to come along and disturb the rest
[8:46] because it's it's really hard to rest
[8:48] when you're hungry
[8:49] it's really hard to rest when the thing
[8:51] that you wanted to eat together you
[8:53] don't get to enjoy
[8:54] and so there's tender grapes between
[8:57] christ and his bridegroom that he wants
[9:00] us to be able to enjoy
[9:01] think of the fruits of the spirit
[9:04] love and gentleness and gooliness and
[9:06] kindness and longsuffering
[9:06] long-suffering
[9:08] something that
[9:09] he's looking to bring out a character
[9:11] within us
[9:12] a character that levels us up to his
[9:14] character so that we can enjoy true
[9:16] fellowship one with another
[9:19] but then we have
[9:20] these little foxes
[9:23] and i love it that they call them little
[9:25] foxes because it seems like the thing
[9:27] that man thinks is the littlest is
[9:30] oftentimes the thing that causes the
[9:33] most destruction
[9:35] we look over here in the scripture and
[9:37] coming back to to james that he says
[9:39] that every man is tempted when he is
[9:40] drawn away of his own
[9:43] lust
[9:44] and enticed and then that lust conceives
[9:47] and it brings forth sin and sin
[9:49] conceives and it brings forth finally
[9:51] death
[9:52] so what we thought was just maybe a
[9:54] little lost maybe just a little sin
[9:57] finally ends in death
[10:00] now i want to be very careful here
[10:01] because i believe that the believer who
[10:03] has received the gift of the holy ghost
[10:05] who's been baptized into the body of
[10:07] christ by receiving the divine nature of
[10:10] christ he has passed from death unto
[10:12] life
[10:13] that he comes no longer into the
[10:15] judgment amen but yet our actions are
[10:18] such that
[10:19] if we allow sin to reign in our mortal
[10:21] bodies there's still a law of sin and
[10:24] death which must be complete
[10:26] you look at david and even though he was
[10:28] the anointed of god
[10:30] yet when he sinned with bathsheba
[10:33] not only did he cause the death of
[10:35] of bathsheba's husband but when judgment
[10:38] was visited upon his house it was his
[10:40] own son
[10:41] that death came upon
[10:43] though he was god's anointed though he
[10:45] deserved to be the one that was slain
[10:48] god passed over him
[10:50] but death still had
[10:52] to have its way because there's a law of
[10:54] sin
[10:55] that has to end in death
[10:59] we look out for the scripture and i
[11:00] think we can begin to instruct ourselves
[11:02] that when we approach this this sin
[11:05] question
[11:07] this
[11:08] temptation
[11:10] always it seems
[11:12] it starts with just a small step
[11:15] it's just a little fox
[11:18] maybe we can just let it run around a
[11:19] little bit it's got it's so cute and
[11:21] it's got these cute little kits that
[11:23] it's little babies and i i think it
[11:26] won't do too much harm i kind of enjoy
[11:29] seeing the nature of the little animal
[11:31] and
[11:32] we just kind of let it run its course
[11:34] for a while
[11:35] i wonder if that's maybe what eve
[11:37] thought when she was watching this
[11:39] serpent he's he's he's not such a bad
[11:41] guy he's just a little fox he's just a
[11:44] little foxy he's he's a little naughty
[11:47] and he ought not to do some of the
[11:48] things that he does and he ought not to
[11:50] speak to me about
[11:52] eating that fruit and eating that tree
[11:55] like he does
[11:56] but you know god gave me all these trees
[11:59] in the garden i'm eating
[12:01] 999 trees
[12:03] maybe
[12:05] what's one more
[12:07] what's what's one more tree is it really
[12:09] that bad
[12:12] and then you see that she was began to
[12:14] be drawn away of her own lust right when
[12:17] he began to reason with her and he said
[12:19] well now wait a second you could if you
[12:21] eat of this tree you could be as gods
[12:24] oh you mean god's withholding something
[12:26] from me
[12:27] there's something more that i can have
[12:30] there there's something that god hasn't
[12:32] provided to me yet and i could provide
[12:34] it to myself
[12:37] oh my
[12:38] now it's just a little fox it's just one
[12:40] tree i haven't eaten of why don't i just
[12:42] go ahead and grab a hold of that fruit
[12:46] and you see that from that sin came
[12:48] every death
[12:50] came every death from a child every
[12:53] every war that's ravaging the world
[12:56] right now and has ravaged the world
[12:58] through time
[12:59] every every every wrong sin every ever
[13:04] everything that's ever gone wrong every
[13:06] drug addict every drunkard has come from
[13:08] that one decision of eve because she
[13:11] thought it was a little sin
[13:14] sin has consequences
[13:17] and it starts with a lust it starts with
[13:19] something that i want and i don't have
[13:22] it yet
[13:25] i wonder if nathan and coral when they
[13:27] began to talk about moses and the camp
[13:29] of the israelites if they thought
[13:31] perhaps speaking against moses was that
[13:34] big of a deal when they grabbed 250 some
[13:38] odd princes among the house of israel
[13:40] and approached moses and said moses
[13:42] you're not so holy we're all holy in
[13:45] this camp and why do you set yourself up
[13:48] above all of us and make us as a god or
[13:51] make yourself as a god to us and he
[13:54] began to
[13:55] speak against god's man
[13:59] and he
[14:00] no doubt said well it's just another man
[14:02] it's not a big deal i'm i'm just going
[14:04] to give myself permissions
[14:06] because i want maybe his lust was that
[14:08] he wanted some position or some power he
[14:12] did he was jealous perhaps of of moses
[14:17] but what came of that
[14:20] his whole family his little children all
[14:22] of his tents his wife his his nephews
[14:25] his cousins all of his family his
[14:27] extended relatives all of it was
[14:30] swallowed up within the ground and their
[14:32] ground closed back on him again
[14:35] because he started with a little fox and
[14:38] let it carry his whole family over the
[14:41] precipice of death
[14:44] he didn't think the first time that he
[14:46] sat down in his tent
[14:48] this little conversation between him and
[14:50] his wife was gonna grow to such a place
[14:52] that bitterness would arise in her heart
[14:55] and she'd speak back to him and he'd
[14:57] speak back to her and they'd start
[14:58] squabbling about how moses was doing
[15:01] things that they didn't like and then
[15:02] they had to go and talk to their
[15:04] neighbor about it and before they knew
[15:06] it they had this whole emotion that was
[15:08] now out of control right it was just
[15:10] something that he wanted to maybe share
[15:12] with his wife to start with but now it
[15:14] grows in this whole whirlwind of emotion
[15:18] this whole whirlwind of actions that
[15:20] finally takes all of their lives
[15:24] but it was just a little fox it was just
[15:26] a little decision
[15:29] he spoke against god's man maybe just
[15:31] between him and his wife to start with
[15:33] but he allowed it to grow
[15:36] allowed it to carry him over
[15:38] i wonder what about those little
[15:40] children that when they met elisha on
[15:43] the way and they they said go on up thou
[15:45] bald head they they teased him about
[15:47] being bald and they showed disrespect to
[15:49] god's prophet
[15:52] i wonder about their parents
[15:54] what was it in those children's hearts
[15:56] that would disrespect the man of god so
[15:59] much
[16:00] were there some decisions at home
[16:02] that led to the death of those children
[16:05] as a she-bear came out and swallowed
[16:07] them all up right
[16:09] was there a decision on the part of the
[16:11] parents
[16:12] i'm speaking to you mom i'm speaking to
[16:14] you dad
[16:15] was there a decision at home somewhere
[16:17] around the dinner table
[16:19] they heard what mom and dad
[16:21] said
[16:22] about the prophet
[16:24] criticized him
[16:26] maybe tore down what the preacher said
[16:27] that day at church said i think he's
[16:30] just
[16:31] kind of
[16:32] making a little bit too much of himself
[16:34] getting up on his soapbox a little bit
[16:36] today
[16:38] or maybe it wasn't what they heard at a
[16:39] dinner table maybe it was what they saw
[16:42] around the
[16:43] family movie screen
[16:46] or whatever they had back then
[16:48] that that showed what the hearts of
[16:50] their parents really were they went to
[16:53] church every day but when they came home
[16:55] and saw what the parents
[16:57] watched on the movies they realized that
[17:00] their parents really didn't believe all
[17:02] this
[17:03] maybe they believed a part of it they
[17:05] believed in the healings the miracles of
[17:06] elisha but they didn't believe obviously
[17:09] they didn't believe what elisha taught
[17:11] because
[17:12] their life didn't line up to the
[17:13] teachings of the prophet
[17:15] and so when they finally met that
[17:17] prophet on a road they didn't have any
[17:19] problem
[17:20] showing him disrespect
[17:23] because the lives their parents had
[17:24] already displayed that disrespect
[17:27] on their behalf
[17:29] and they just being kids well you know
[17:32] you know what kids do
[17:35] if you say it at home or you live it at
[17:37] home
[17:38] they kind of what you say in the in your
[17:40] bed chambers they call out on the
[17:42] streets
[17:43] embarrass you sometimes but it's more
[17:46] than just little
[17:48] childless embarrassments here
[17:51] they lost their lives
[17:54] the curse was on the parents because
[17:56] their parents had done something at home
[17:59] that caused this disrespect
[18:02] i don't think that they had ever
[18:04] imagined
[18:05] that whatever that decision at the home
[18:07] front was
[18:08] would carry itself all the way
[18:11] until conceived itself in the death of
[18:13] their children
[18:15] but it did
[18:18] i wonder about ananias and sapphira in
[18:20] the new testament
[18:22] they thought it was just a little thing
[18:24] to lie to paul
[18:25] they didn't discern the lord's body they
[18:28] didn't discern they weren't just lying
[18:30] to the apostle paul but they were lying
[18:32] to the holy ghost
[18:35] and and i asked that they didn't think
[18:36] he wouldn't see his wife again
[18:38] didn't think that she would join him in
[18:40] death later that afternoon
[18:42] but death is what came of that decision
[18:50] so there's an effect to sin it's not
[18:52] just that our sin is just
[18:54] little and tiny
[18:56] but it leads somewhere
[18:59] i think about the the sermon from that
[19:02] time that brother branham preaches he he
[19:04] talks about this man that's a a chronic
[19:06] liar and he sits down with a man and
[19:08] says you know nobody believes your
[19:09] stories
[19:11] why do you do that
[19:12] why do you tell all these stories like
[19:14] you do and the man could go back and say
[19:17] well i remember
[19:18] back when i was a little boy
[19:20] and i was
[19:21] smoking some corn silk cigarettes
[19:24] behind the barn and i wouldn't let my
[19:26] mom know about it so to hide it i would
[19:29] i would eat on some some coffee grounds
[19:31] my mom caught me one day he said and she
[19:34] smelled the coffee on my breath and said
[19:35] you've been trying to hide something
[19:37] what have been you've been doing
[19:39] you've been smoking cigarettes she asked
[19:41] him point blank and he said there was
[19:42] something in me at that time
[19:45] that said tell the truth
[19:47] tell the truth
[19:49] and he overrode his consciousness he
[19:52] said i chose
[19:54] to tell a lie
[19:55] i looked at my mom straight in the face
[19:57] he said i said no ma'am i did not
[20:00] smoke those cigarettes he said from that
[20:02] time
[20:04] and what it began as a perversion of his
[20:06] character until now he was in the side
[20:08] streets and the highways and the byways
[20:10] not even being able to hold down a job
[20:14] from that time
[20:16] so there's there's an effect to our sin
[20:18] friends there's effect to our decisions
[20:20] there's an effect to these little foxes
[20:24] and i think the greatest effect for the
[20:26] believer
[20:28] is that it affects our relationship with
[20:30] jesus christ
[20:32] but the moment we choose to indulge
[20:36] these little lusts
[20:39] the pride of life
[20:40] the lust of the flesh
[20:42] the lust of the eye
[20:44] these little lusts
[20:46] cause us to break fellowship with christ
[20:49] because light can have no fellowship of
[20:51] darkness
[20:54] and holiness
[20:56] can have no fellowship with that which
[20:58] is defiled amen
[21:01] that's why god calls his people to be
[21:03] holy
[21:04] because he wants her to be made of the
[21:06] same fabric that he's made of
[21:08] of the same character of the same nature
[21:11] that's why he gives us his holy spirit
[21:14] so it's not just that we grieve the holy
[21:16] ghost it's that we lose fellowship with
[21:18] god
[21:20] when we
[21:21] indulge the lusts of the flesh
[21:25] now i want to separate this because this
[21:27] is not the lust of of a born-again
[21:29] believer this is not the lust of the
[21:31] soul this is the lust of your flesh it's
[21:34] unredeemed it's you're only going to
[21:36] shake it off you when you leave this
[21:38] flesh
[21:39] when this blessed goes into the earth
[21:41] it will fulfill the law of sin and death
[21:45] this flesh was born in sin
[21:48] shaped in iniquity and it cannot escape
[21:50] death
[21:52] but but if you're born in christ this
[21:55] morning
[21:57] where it whereas the flesh was born in
[21:59] sin and it goes back to sin it goes back
[22:01] and fulfills the law of sin and death he
[22:04] who is born in christ
[22:06] must go back to god
[22:08] there's no way around it
[22:10] but in the meantime
[22:12] are you going to let sin reign within
[22:14] your mortal members
[22:16] or are you going to allow god
[22:18] to baptize you and keep you in his
[22:21] presence keep you in his holy spirit
[22:24] and shoo out all those little foxes
[22:27] well i i want to do a little bit of fox
[22:29] hunting this this morning
[22:32] yeah you ever watch a fox hunt you kind
[22:34] of circle around the horses and
[22:36] everybody gets on with the red coats and
[22:38] it's it's quite an event to do a fox
[22:40] hunt
[22:42] everybody gets out their dogs and they
[22:44] they all go howling and they they blow
[22:46] the big bugle horn
[22:48] well
[22:49] let's just go ahead and blow the bugle
[22:51] horn of god's word a little while
[22:53] let's pick up god's word and and shoot
[22:55] at some fox this morning let's let's get
[22:58] a little bit more specific
[23:00] because
[23:02] we have if if there's sin that's
[23:04] reigning in our lives if there's
[23:05] something that's bringing forth death in
[23:07] our families
[23:08] i don't want that to continue do you
[23:11] if there's something where i look at my
[23:13] family life and i'm saying it's not what
[23:15] it ought to be there's there should be
[23:17] more life happening there there should
[23:19] be more growth happening
[23:21] there should be some continuation of
[23:23] christ that's as i look into christ i'm
[23:25] changed from glory into glory and if i'm
[23:28] not seeing that in my family if i'm not
[23:30] seeing that in my children there's
[23:32] something wrong and i want to find out
[23:34] what it is and then maybe it's not
[23:37] totally off the rails but i want i want
[23:40] my vineyard to be a hundred percent free
[23:42] of the foxes i don't want any sin within
[23:45] me having rain or dominion
[23:49] so let's the first step then is before
[23:52] we get to sin let's recognize what it is
[23:55] that takes us there right it's the lust
[23:58] that's within our bodies within our
[24:00] members the lust of the eye the lust the
[24:03] flesh the pride of life what is that
[24:06] you've got to recognize what it is the
[24:08] lust of the flesh is it's not just
[24:10] clicking around on the internet
[24:12] there is that but
[24:14] the lust of the flesh is anything that
[24:15] has to do with the sensual the the taste
[24:18] the touch the feel
[24:20] the the things that i i just want to
[24:22] have these experiences
[24:24] i i i want that nice
[24:27] maybe that nice
[24:29] car thank you brother i appreciate it
[24:32] maybe i want that nice car because
[24:35] that that would just gratify me
[24:37] that's what i need and we set it up as
[24:42] the end-all and the be-all
[24:45] it becomes a lust to us
[24:47] see so many times we think about
[24:49] lust is as as um
[24:53] as binary
[24:55] it's either forbidden or it's not
[24:57] forbidden that's how we've been taught
[24:59] right that lust is the desire for the
[25:01] forbidden
[25:03] it's either forbidden or it's not
[25:04] forbidden but lust isn't just binary
[25:07] like that
[25:08] lust is
[25:09] about
[25:10] are you
[25:11] going to such an extent that you're
[25:13] going past god's providence for you
[25:17] so for example
[25:20] you can take
[25:21] food we'll take for example
[25:25] god provides our food david said in the
[25:28] psalms i've not seen the righteous
[25:30] forsaken nor his seed begging for bread
[25:33] god provides that food for us
[25:36] but yet we could extend it so much be
[25:38] that it becomes a lust to us that
[25:42] becomes as the sin of gluttony
[25:44] that
[25:45] it's our only satisfaction
[25:47] it's the only thing that we care about
[25:50] or
[25:51] maybe not the only i'll cut you a little
[25:52] bit of slack but maybe it's the
[25:54] principle thing
[25:56] it's the thing that we set our
[25:58] affections on
[26:00] that when we've got a little bit of down
[26:02] time and
[26:03] we're tired or we're
[26:05] maybe a little bit down and depressed
[26:07] it's it's the thing that we turn to
[26:11] i'm going to use gluttony in here as a
[26:13] placeholder for
[26:15] maybe what your lust is
[26:17] but i'm just going to ask that the holy
[26:19] spirit deals with each one this morning
[26:21] and
[26:22] fills in that placeholder
[26:24] and deals with your heart specifically
[26:28] but whereas there are some things that
[26:30] are a necessity like food
[26:32] god provides it but it becomes a lust to
[26:34] us when we exceed god's bounds for it
[26:38] and now we're beginning to forsake what
[26:41] was the natural appetite for food
[26:44] what was the natural
[26:47] appetite for what god had provided to us
[26:50] and now we make it the end-all and the
[26:52] be-all
[26:54] so that now
[26:55] it becomes to even become a perversion
[26:58] to us
[27:04] for example
[27:06] if you have a lust for food
[27:10] now
[27:11] the only thing that you care about
[27:12] eventually is maybe just your sugar
[27:15] foods
[27:16] and you go so far that now the natural
[27:19] appetite
[27:20] is not only exceeded
[27:22] but it's become twisted
[27:25] so that now you're only desiring that
[27:27] sugary sweet thing that gives you that
[27:29] instant high
[27:30] you're not filling your belly like god
[27:32] meant for you to be filled
[27:35] and if you're discerning you can see
[27:37] where
[27:38] this principle that i'm preaching
[27:39] through food
[27:40] can touch many different kinds of lusts
[27:45] and i want the adults in the room to be
[27:46] discerning
[27:50] so there's the natural appetites but we
[27:52] major then on what a minor is by making
[27:56] it our focus in our lives
[27:59] men we can even do this with our own
[28:01] wives
[28:02] you can major on a minor until the only
[28:05] time
[28:06] your focus with your wife
[28:09] isn't the beautiful relationship that
[28:11] god had for you
[28:13] but now it's focused
[28:15] on the evenings and the nights
[28:18] whereas god had this beautiful idea of a
[28:20] marital union
[28:22] this 24 7 and had beautiful grapes of
[28:26] tenderness and care and
[28:28] and and loving relationship to one
[28:30] another and holding each other's hands
[28:33] through life and building one another up
[28:35] and encouraging one another and being a
[28:38] faithful co-partner in life
[28:41] yet if we take one component of god's
[28:43] providence within that
[28:45] and they in in major on that minor
[28:49] now
[28:50] it becomes a lust to us even within the
[28:53] marriage union
[28:55] and pursuing that to its end
[28:58] it becomes a perversion right just like
[29:00] food would be right it's true where
[29:03] you had maybe you started out just
[29:05] really enjoying your steak
[29:07] but as you enjoyed your food more and
[29:10] more and made that your end-all be-all
[29:13] now the only food that you like is maybe
[29:15] your sweet treats and you keep pursuing
[29:17] this to your own detriment
[29:20] until what happens
[29:23] begin to fill out
[29:25] our hearts begin to corrode over because
[29:27] we're not eating the right kind of foods
[29:29] we're taking in the sweets and the fats
[29:31] and and going with an imbalanced diet
[29:37] that's what lust will do to you
[29:39] so lust is not binary it's not satisfied
[29:42] with just
[29:45] convincing you to grab a hold of that
[29:47] which is forbidden at the outset
[29:51] but lust is perfectly pleased to get you
[29:54] to take that which god provides
[29:57] and focus on it so much
[30:00] until it goes beyond what god's
[30:02] providence would be for it
[30:10] you can take this with many different
[30:11] types of loss we talked about the lust
[30:13] the flesh and
[30:14] but what about the lust of the eye
[30:16] right what about
[30:18] the things that we like to place our
[30:20] eyes upon
[30:21] that which brings us joy and
[30:23] entertainment
[30:25] the eye is the the window to the soul
[30:27] they say it's it's it you would say well
[30:29] the lust the eye why is why is it not a
[30:31] subset of the lust of the flesh
[30:34] well because the eye is its own special
[30:36] thing because what the eyes see ignites
[30:38] the imagination
[30:40] and it goes straight into the spirit of
[30:42] man
[30:43] so now we we can talk about the lust of
[30:45] the eye and
[30:46] not only
[30:48] maybe the loss of the flesh but what do
[30:49] we enjoy watching what kind of movies
[30:52] are we watching at home
[30:55] is it within the bounds of god's
[30:57] providence
[31:00] or is it going beyond what god would
[31:02] provide is it going into the perverted
[31:05] side of things
[31:07] where now we're
[31:09] allowing ourselves to
[31:11] let in little foxes through our movie
[31:13] entertainment like
[31:15] horror movies and night of the living
[31:17] dead and
[31:19] swear words and
[31:22] man's ideas of what life looks like
[31:25] right
[31:26] through their portrayal of life through
[31:28] the eyes of hollywood
[31:30] and that comes down on our on not only
[31:32] us
[31:33] but it comes down upon our kids and our
[31:35] families
[31:36] and the subtleties that we don't pick up
[31:38] in the disney movies maybe or in the
[31:40] cartoons our kids are picking up
[31:44] and so the question i have for you
[31:46] is your choice of entertainment within
[31:49] god's providence
[31:52] or is it exceeding it such that lust is
[31:54] being enjoined
[31:56] where now this is what your family is
[31:58] defaulting to that it's no longer the
[32:00] family altar that that's been replaced
[32:02] somehow and your family has gone out of
[32:04] balance
[32:06] and that what you default to when you
[32:07] don't have any plans in the evening is
[32:10] just grab a hold of the remote
[32:13] i'm warning you friends
[32:15] this is what we want to steer away from
[32:17] amen
[32:20] i'm not saying that you're not
[32:21] christians
[32:23] because my wife and i have the same
[32:24] conversation in our home
[32:26] is there too many movies are are we
[32:28] watching the right kind of movies do we
[32:29] need to make a course correction
[32:32] it's the world that we live in
[32:35] it's the world that our children live in
[32:37] the world that our grandchildren live in
[32:38] as we're talking with brother keith this
[32:40] is the world that we're
[32:42] growing up in
[32:44] this is the world that our family is
[32:46] growing up in
[32:48] we have to have a little checkpoint
[32:50] sometimes and say you know what i've
[32:52] really been enjoying the grapes in my
[32:53] garden but is there another part of my
[32:55] garden that's not thriving how about how
[32:58] about we just walk around our garden in
[33:00] our hearts this morning and let the holy
[33:02] ghost grab a hold of your hand
[33:04] and maybe walk you through the different
[33:06] rooms in your family and the different
[33:08] times of day that your family would have
[33:10] and
[33:11] what your family practices and habits
[33:13] are
[33:14] and ask yourselves
[33:17] is everything okay here i mean
[33:20] we're waiting for the coming of the lord
[33:22] i i i don't want to be found out of
[33:25] fellowship with him i don't want to be
[33:26] found that i let some of the tender
[33:29] grapes that he prepared for me in this
[33:31] end time message i i let them rot on the
[33:33] vine i let them get spoiled
[33:37] is there something that
[33:38] i need to address
[33:42] because i want to have that relationship
[33:44] with christ amen i i want to have a
[33:46] picnic with my lord
[33:48] and i i i don't want to offer up fruits
[33:51] in that picnic that say well
[33:53] this is all i could find on my great
[33:55] barber this morning
[33:56] everything else was spoiled
[33:59] i'm sorry we'll have to have our our
[34:01] picnic together our our quiet time
[34:03] together another time because
[34:06] i still feel bad about the movie that my
[34:07] family watched last night i just feel so
[34:10] grieved in my spirit i'm not i'm not
[34:12] feeling in oneness with you lord and
[34:14] or or or maybe it's gone so long that
[34:16] you you can't you can say
[34:18] i i just feel like something's off
[34:21] and i can't quite put my finger on it
[34:24] but i just can't seem to have confidence
[34:26] towards my lord like i used to
[34:29] have you ever come to that kind of place
[34:32] i'm just offering up the word to you
[34:34] this morning that you can go back to
[34:37] that place maybe where
[34:40] you left off
[34:41] from the presence of god
[34:43] and pick it back up again friends
[34:48] the lust of the eyes that excite the
[34:50] imagination what we allow ourselves to
[34:53] see
[34:54] what we
[34:55] through entertainment and movies and
[34:57] what we allow ourselves to hear through
[34:59] that right about what we allow ourselves
[35:02] to see on our phones
[35:05] the instagram and the facebook and the
[35:07] twitter and the now they've got the uh
[35:12] all the movie thing that they do help me
[35:14] out here honey
[35:16] yeah the youtubes is another one and the
[35:18] ones where they make the
[35:22] tick tock thank you brother these guys
[35:24] know it
[35:26] i'll tell you what some of the dirtiest
[35:28] things are right on there on tick-tock
[35:30] you just start clicking around enough
[35:31] and you think your kid was watching
[35:33] something cute and they were but all of
[35:35] a sudden
[35:36] something else comes up
[35:41] be careful friends
[35:42] be careful what we allow in our homes in
[35:44] this last day amen because the enemy is
[35:47] foxy
[35:49] he is wily
[35:51] he is he is conniving
[35:53] and he wants to seek kill and destroy
[35:56] if he can't get at you he'll get under
[35:57] you
[35:58] if you're the fence he's going to find a
[36:00] way to dig under that fence
[36:03] if he can't break down the fence and you
[36:05] say i'm strong watch your back because
[36:08] if you're that strong that's fine he's
[36:10] going to find a way to dig under you
[36:13] try to get at your children try to get
[36:14] out those olive plants as the bible says
[36:16] that are trying to grow up around our
[36:18] table
[36:19] be careful amen stay circumspect in this
[36:22] age amen it's your job it's your duty as
[36:25] a parent to be their holy ghost for them
[36:27] until they receive the holy ghost
[36:30] so when we're done watching our own
[36:31] lives make sure that we're watching
[36:33] what's happening with our families amen
[36:39] so we look at the lust of the eyes and
[36:42] what we're looking at
[36:43] but then as as you look at instagram one
[36:45] thing that that amazes me about that is
[36:47] it doesn't just stop with what our eyes
[36:49] set upon it it begins to go into the
[36:51] pride of life
[36:53] right we see what the joneses have and
[36:56] we see their cool car that they've just
[36:58] gotten their nice vacation they just
[37:00] have and
[37:02] if we're not careful
[37:04] what we're setting our eyes upon
[37:07] plays with our imagination until the
[37:08] pride of life starts to enter in
[37:10] well i i want that
[37:13] my they they seem like they're being
[37:15] held in esteem in the church or
[37:18] they're
[37:19] everybody kind of respects them i i want
[37:21] that
[37:22] that's what dathan wanted when he
[37:24] started talking to his wife well that
[37:26] moses he makes himself so holy and so
[37:28] pious and so pontius and i i i think i
[37:32] could be like that too
[37:34] be careful friends
[37:37] i believe it was uh john wesley when he
[37:39] was
[37:40] writing his notes on the pride of life
[37:42] he said that it pertains to that which
[37:44] in the world is held in honor or esteem
[37:48] and that's the same thing that the that
[37:50] was the original sin of satan he got
[37:52] himself lifted up in pride
[37:55] he he wanted to be as the most high
[37:59] be careful what you desire to be
[38:02] be careful what you desire to become
[38:06] be careful what you desire others to see
[38:08] you as
[38:12] our desire should become to be simply
[38:14] become
[38:15] christ
[38:17] not the greatest preacher
[38:19] not the greatest deacon
[38:22] we should
[38:23] want to exercise our jobs well but if
[38:25] our desire starts to become well i want
[38:27] them to hold me in esteem
[38:30] this is where i feel like paul's
[38:32] sentiment oh wretched man that i am
[38:36] who shall save me from this sin
[38:38] condition
[38:39] because i i'll be honest with you i
[38:41] can't hardly buy something nice and let
[38:43] somebody else see it it's just here's
[38:45] what god blessed me with but there's a
[38:47] little trigger in my heart that says
[38:50] i just got this really nice truck
[38:53] i just got this really nice
[38:55] book or this really nice thing and and
[38:57] they're seeing what and how nice it is
[38:58] and
[38:59] there's just something that comes in
[39:01] there
[39:04] this is teaching now that's your flesh
[39:07] that's all right you're not going to get
[39:09] away from it until you bury this thing
[39:11] in the earth
[39:12] and go into the next dimension
[39:15] so don't feel wrong about that paul was
[39:17] saying
[39:18] wretched man that i am who shall save me
[39:21] i thank god through jesus christ his son
[39:25] so we have christ we're born anew so
[39:28] that now there's a law that's now
[39:30] working within our members a law of sin
[39:32] but there's another law
[39:34] the law
[39:35] of christ and eternal life
[39:39] what we have to be careful of with the
[39:40] pride of life is that when that little
[39:43] lust comes up we don't grab it and pet
[39:46] that little fox
[39:48] we don't entertain that pride of life
[39:51] we don't start
[39:53] switching our focus from just enjoying
[39:55] god's blessings to trying to prop
[39:58] ourselves up
[40:02] you see where the difference is
[40:05] you're given an opportunity and a choice
[40:07] at each stage am i going to choose lust
[40:09] and follow it
[40:11] or am i going to just stay humble and
[40:12] meek before god
[40:14] and keep following him as a christian
[40:19] amen
[40:21] another thing about lust is when we
[40:23] think about how that it takes us beyond
[40:27] our natural desires
[40:29] beyond god's providence
[40:33] i want to i want to focus on that just a
[40:35] little bit more
[40:36] because if we go back to the original
[40:38] sin that happened in the garden
[40:40] you have to ask yourself
[40:42] what was eve's deal
[40:44] like
[40:45] what was her problem
[40:47] she had all the trees in the garden that
[40:49] she could eat from
[40:50] she had all the fruits that she could
[40:52] eat from those trees
[40:54] she she she had a husband
[40:57] she
[40:58] had a perfect life she had had she had
[41:00] the garden of eden that we're trying to
[41:02] get back to
[41:03] god's providence was enough
[41:07] lust entered in the picture
[41:09] only
[41:10] when she was convinced otherwise
[41:14] so friends i want to give you a key that
[41:16] if you see lost in your life
[41:20] it's a sign that somewhere along the way
[41:23] you've been hoodwinked
[41:26] that somewhere along the way
[41:28] satan has convinced you
[41:31] in a lie
[41:33] and the greatest freedom that i can
[41:35] provide to you from the word
[41:37] is to show you the lie
[41:40] i could pray over you today
[41:41] and sometimes god will supernaturally
[41:44] deliver a person from their lust if
[41:45] they're trapped in that but oftentimes
[41:48] god wants to lead us out of lust
[41:52] it's a journey back to god
[41:55] and the best way to start that journey
[41:57] is by recognizing the lie that you're
[42:00] in a man that set up his entire life and
[42:04] has to look back and said yes i've set
[42:06] up my entire life trying to acquire
[42:09] riches and lands and wealth and because
[42:12] it's the pride of life
[42:14] he would have to be honest with himself
[42:16] no matter how old he is
[42:18] and look back and said yes my life
[42:20] decisions
[42:22] up to this point have been directed by a
[42:24] pride of life
[42:25] and i am wrong
[42:27] and i repent of it and god help me to
[42:30] make all of my decisions such that i can
[42:32] turn away from that
[42:34] and be humble before you again amen
[42:37] he would have to recognize that all
[42:38] those years of his life
[42:40] were a lie
[42:43] demand is trapped in sexual sin
[42:45] has to recognize that some point
[42:49] that satan's fed a lie to him that
[42:51] there's
[42:52] no satisfaction in that right
[42:56] the man that that that is trapped in and
[42:58] wanting the next big thing the next toy
[43:01] the next the next
[43:03] truck that comes out i'm i'm talking
[43:04] about a truck because my wife's smiling
[43:06] back there because i'm i'm getting a
[43:07] truck we've been
[43:09] i've worked for nine nine years on a
[43:11] toyota truck project and we finally
[43:13] released it and
[43:15] i'm getting it sometime as soon as they
[43:17] can build it for me
[43:19] but if if we make that let's say our
[43:21] end-all deal
[43:22] some some lust of the flesh some desire
[43:25] for acquisition of things because it
[43:27] makes our life nicer and more
[43:29] comfortable and that's what we think we
[43:31] need just a nicer house and a nicer that
[43:34] or a nicer list and maybe you don't have
[43:36] it yet so you can't say well brother
[43:37] jose i'm poor as dirt i don't know what
[43:39] you're talking about
[43:41] but if you're as poor as dirt but your
[43:43] mind is still focused on those things
[43:46] you're poorer than dirt friends
[43:48] god wants to give you his riches and his
[43:50] tender grapes but if you're so focused
[43:53] on what everybody else has on your and
[43:55] you're trying to connive ways to get a
[43:56] hold of it so your life can be that much
[43:59] better if i can just get the new big
[44:00] screen tv and the new big truck and the
[44:02] new big house and the big this and the
[44:04] big vat like our american lifestyle
[44:06] wants us to get you've been fed a lie
[44:12] if there's any lust in your life if
[44:14] there's any little fox that's allowed to
[44:16] run rampant in your life
[44:18] it's a symbol that there's a lie
[44:22] if your family is consuming
[44:24] more entertainment than the word of god
[44:27] you've been fed a lie
[44:29] that
[44:31] that entertainment
[44:32] is more interesting than god's word
[44:36] and no doubt you've reinforced the lie
[44:38] because we try to sit down with a family
[44:40] altar and it doesn't work or it's boring
[44:42] or we fall asleep
[44:44] and we're like well that didn't work
[44:48] i'm telling you
[44:52] yes in the flesh
[44:54] it is more boring
[44:55] but let not lust reign in your mortal
[44:58] members
[44:59] give yourself time to re-learn
[45:02] how to lean back on the spirit man
[45:05] and walk with christ
[45:07] until you relearn those steps with god
[45:10] you might be able to say this morning i
[45:11] i remember the time where i had
[45:13] deep devotion with god and deep times of
[45:16] consecration and prayer and i i remember
[45:19] his spirit but that's long gone
[45:21] and in its place is all the
[45:23] entertainments and perversions of this
[45:24] world and it just and and i'm so busy
[45:27] there's another lie i'm so busy
[45:30] right
[45:31] friends
[45:34] just drop it all
[45:36] believe the word of the lord that you're
[45:38] called for this
[45:40] he's saying to you this morning come
[45:41] away my love my fair one my dove
[45:45] you're hidden in the cliff and the rocks
[45:47] and in the in the secret place the
[45:49] stairs come out
[45:51] come out and enjoy my presence this
[45:53] morning
[45:57] lusts makes a pursuit after that which
[46:00] cannot be satisfied
[46:03] that's what lust does
[46:04] you achieve one thing you get there
[46:08] and it was just a mirage
[46:10] it was just a a carrot on a stick in
[46:12] front of a donkey and you let yourself
[46:14] be the donkey
[46:16] don't be the donkey friends be a child
[46:18] of god this morning
[46:20] god doesn't put carrots on a stick for
[46:22] his people he puts promises in his word
[46:25] which he is faithful and just to fulfill
[46:28] i'm looking at testimonies of god's
[46:30] fulfilling his promise of those that
[46:32] would repent and be baptized in the name
[46:34] of jesus christ would receive the gift
[46:36] of the holy ghost
[46:37] where you started in earnest don't
[46:39] continue in vain friends grab a hold of
[46:42] god
[46:43] trust that
[46:44] he which began a good work in you is
[46:46] faithful and just to complete it
[46:48] he who who gave you that great holy
[46:50] ghost experience has more experiences to
[46:53] share
[46:54] that he would satisfy your heart at one
[46:56] time can satisfy it again
[46:59] and maybe you say oh brother josiah my
[47:01] heart is so polluted you don't
[47:03] understand
[47:04] god says confess your faults to him
[47:08] and he is faithful and just to forgive
[47:11] us of our sins
[47:14] god wants to have fellowship with you
[47:15] friends
[47:16] and god is a professional cleaner upper
[47:18] of all hearts
[47:20] my god has an amazing track record
[47:23] i can show you the dirtiest man
[47:25] some of the dirtiest men that you're
[47:27] you're singing the songs today of some
[47:28] of the dirtiest man that ever lived
[47:30] amazing grace a slave trader
[47:32] where they would stack human beings five
[47:34] crates high and they would ship them
[47:36] over this seas and they would just have
[47:38] their slot fall out to each other one
[47:40] down the other along the crate stack
[47:42] until they got to the bottom they'd slap
[47:44] it off the side and he treated humans
[47:46] that way and sold them into slavery in
[47:48] shackles and yet god came to him and
[47:51] said i'll deliver you from your shackles
[47:54] until that man could write a song
[47:56] amazing grace how sweet the song
[47:59] if god could do that for an old slave
[48:01] trader
[48:02] don't you think that god can still save
[48:04] you from your lusts and your your your
[48:06] blindness amen you might be able to turn
[48:08] your life on your your eyes on your life
[48:10] and say yes brother josiah i've been
[48:12] blind but i don't know how to get out of
[48:14] it you don't have to get out of it this
[48:16] morning god wants to slay those foxes
[48:19] for you he's just asking you stop
[48:21] petting the fox stop feeding the fox
[48:24] let's take us the foxes the scripture
[48:27] says not take you the foxes not take you
[48:30] the foxes he says god almighty god is
[48:34] present here this morning he says let's
[48:36] take us the foxes
[48:38] he's enjoining himself with you he's
[48:40] saying let me step down the creator of
[48:43] all life
[48:45] and let's take us to foxes let's throw
[48:47] them out together
[48:50] i wonder if
[48:51] you're hearing god's voice to your heart
[48:53] this morning if you would just say to
[48:54] them yes lord
[48:56] yes lord let's let's take us to foxes
[49:00] let's get it out of our lives let's
[49:02] restore the family altar in our home
[49:04] let's restore the quiet place in the
[49:06] mornings where i just have sweet
[49:08] communion with you lord
[49:10] and whatever has to get thrown out
[49:13] that's keeping me from that sweet
[49:15] communion that's keeping my family from
[49:17] that family altar
[49:19] let's deal with it let us take the foxes
[49:22] lord amen
[49:24] the bible says this beautifully
[49:26] and god's desire to satisfy his people
[49:29] in first timothy
[49:30] it says godliness
[49:32] with contentment is great gain
[49:34] for we brought nothing into this world
[49:36] and is certain we can carry nothing out
[49:39] and having food and arraignment
[49:42] let us therewith be content let us not
[49:44] divulge into gluttony i i think we could
[49:47] put the scripture this way having god's
[49:49] providence
[49:51] let us therewith be content
[49:53] knowing that god has given us exactly
[49:55] what we need
[49:56] he is jehovah jireh he is the great
[49:59] provider let's not look for anything
[50:02] else
[50:02] but let's say lord let me just come down
[50:05] and enjoy your picnic with you this
[50:06] morning
[50:08] having food in raiment be content
[50:11] says they that fall until
[50:13] be rich fall into temptations snare and
[50:16] many foolish and hurtful lusts which
[50:20] drown men in destruction and perdition
[50:24] says the love of money is the root of
[50:25] all evil
[50:27] and
[50:28] reading in an amplified way i believe
[50:30] you could say that the love of money is
[50:32] the root of many evils but you could say
[50:34] the love of other things as food as many
[50:36] evils our lives do the love of food the
[50:40] love of man's esteem the the love of
[50:42] sensual experiences
[50:44] is the root of many evils
[50:46] which while having some coveted after
[50:49] they've aired from the faith
[50:51] and pierced themselves through with many
[50:53] sorrows
[50:56] but thou
[50:58] o man of god
[50:59] maybe you're maybe you're here maybe
[51:01] you're maybe you're one of those maybe
[51:03] you're one that's pierced through with
[51:04] many sorrows by your own hurtful loss
[51:07] this morning
[51:08] what does the apostle paul offer up
[51:13] he says thou man of god
[51:15] flee these things
[51:16] he doesn't say get prayed for and
[51:18] anointed with oil and
[51:21] just say
[51:22] hold on all night prayer meeting an
[51:24] altar if that's what it takes for you to
[51:26] flee these things then go ahead and do
[51:28] that
[51:29] but he says flee them
[51:31] flee is
[51:33] not one step
[51:34] it's many steps
[51:37] it's an urgent
[51:39] succession of steps fleeing it says
[51:41] follow after
[51:43] here's what here's your instructions
[51:45] if you're wanting to hunt down any foxes
[51:48] in your life here's your instructions
[51:50] from not from brother josiah from from
[51:52] apostle paul it's worked for believers
[51:55] throughout the ages flee
[51:57] and then follow after righteousness
[52:00] godliness
[52:01] faith
[52:02] patience meekness
[52:04] he says fight the good fight of faith
[52:06] lay hold on eternal life
[52:10] what is your earnest of eternal life
[52:12] this morning it's the holy ghost
[52:14] lay hold on the eternal the eternal life
[52:16] of the holy ghost lay hold on his
[52:18] presence lay hold on his promises for
[52:20] you flee the youthful lost flee the
[52:23] little foxes don't let them have their
[52:25] way in your garden but follow after
[52:28] righteousness
[52:30] recognize the lies of what lust is
[52:34] and to pursue truth in christ
[52:37] that his providence is enough for you
[52:39] this morning
[52:41] that within god's providence
[52:44] he has many beautiful things for you
[52:48] you know that's where lost really
[52:50] breaks down is when we
[52:51] buy
[52:53] the idea
[52:54] that lust can carry us to a place
[52:57] that gets us something that's better
[52:59] than what god has
[53:02] not that what god has wasn't enough
[53:05] maybe i had enough food
[53:08] but this food over here tasted better
[53:11] so i was yes god is the great satisfier
[53:14] but i just think that maybe i can
[53:16] satisfy myself a little bit more if i
[53:20] just step over here
[53:22] and so i eat from this plate
[53:24] but what we find is that when you're
[53:26] eating from lust's provisions
[53:30] it never fills the belly
[53:32] it tastes good in the mouth
[53:34] but it's empty in the belly and you have
[53:37] to go from one plate to another plate to
[53:40] another plate
[53:41] when if you had just stayed over here
[53:44] and cultivated the vineyard of god
[53:47] cultivated what god gave to you
[53:50] cultivated the home that god gave to you
[53:52] the family that god gave to you the wife
[53:54] that god gave to you the time that god
[53:56] gave to you and made the most of what
[53:58] god gave to you
[54:00] it would have
[54:02] bore forth the fruit that you were
[54:04] looking for the whole time amen
[54:06] it would have bore forth the sweet and
[54:09] tender grapes beyond your wildest
[54:12] imaginations
[54:15] god's way
[54:17] takes a little bit of vine dressing it's
[54:20] true
[54:21] you have to work at it you have to tend
[54:23] to the vineyard
[54:26] but the promise is
[54:27] that at the end of the day
[54:29] it bears a fruit it's more than just
[54:32] satisfying
[54:33] they're tender grapes they're delightful
[54:35] to enjoy
[54:37] and what's more
[54:39] is they don't leave you barren forsaken
[54:42] and feeling like
[54:43] you're a prisoner to something
[54:46] prisoner to your phone prisoner to your
[54:48] computer screen
[54:49] prisoner to some trashy novel
[54:53] that your time is wasted in prison
[54:57] but you're left with a sense of
[54:59] wholeness
[55:01] and that's what god wants for his people
[55:08] i'll leave with this scripture
[55:11] as we would stand this morning
[55:17] god offers you you and your family
[55:19] friends his tender grapes and the
[55:22] scripture says that the kingdom of god
[55:24] is this
[55:25] it's not meat
[55:26] it's not drink amen
[55:28] it's not in gluttony it's not in lust
[55:30] amen but it's in righteousness
[55:33] and peace
[55:35] and joy in the holy ghost
[55:38] he that have these things serve with
[55:39] christ
[55:41] and he's an acceptable unto god
[55:43] and approved of men
[55:46] let us therefore follow after
[55:49] and that's what i'll leave you with this
[55:50] morning if you could make a decision
[55:54] follow after the things that make for
[55:55] peace
[55:56] and edify one another
[55:59] you can't say that of your life right
[56:01] now that it makes for peace that leaves
[56:03] you feeling whole and that peace with
[56:04] god in man
[56:06] that your life edifies your family that
[56:08] edifies yourself that edifies your
[56:10] church
[56:11] the things that you're doing
[56:13] don't meet that qualification
[56:15] then that's not part of god's kingdom
[56:18] and you need to shuck it off
[56:22] and follow god into his kingdom
[56:25] into eternal life
[56:26] and believe believe god's truth
[56:29] over satan's lie that he has enough for
[56:32] you
[56:33] let's pray
[56:36] dear lord jesus
[56:38] we just come before you this morning
[56:40] lord
[56:46] i will admit lord that this world in all
[56:49] of its perversions
[56:50] and its many voices
[56:53] have a way to confuse the mind of even
[56:55] the believer
[56:58] what we look at what we search for and
[57:00] what we seek after
[57:03] but i thank you lord that though this
[57:05] world tends towards a confused mind
[57:08] there's still power within your word
[57:11] to renew our minds
[57:12] in christ jesus
[57:15] i pray that your word would go to each
[57:17] heart this morning lord
[57:20] and begin that renewal process lord
[57:23] they would walk out of this building and
[57:25] if they could recognize some lusts
[57:28] running rampant
[57:30] foxes spoiling their tender grapes
[57:33] at first they would be desirous of those
[57:35] tender graves see them as something
[57:36] that's worth protecting lord
[57:40] and recognize that if they would allow
[57:42] this to continue on it only ends in sin
[57:45] and death
[57:47] and lord may they just
[57:49] have that desire within them lord to
[57:50] reach out
[57:53] and speak to you lord say let us
[57:56] take the foxes today lord
[57:58] let me turn away from sin flee youthful
[58:01] lusts
[58:03] and follow after joy and righteousness
[58:06] and peace in the holy ghost
[58:08] and i'll trust you lord that those
[58:10] vendors those tender grapes will come
[58:13] back
[58:14] granted lord we pray in jesus christ's
[58:17] name
[58:20] amen bless you saints
[58:36] it was such a beautiful word this
[58:38] morning there's any foxes like your
[58:40] brother said in your in your vineyard
[58:43] don't let them run rampant the little
[58:45] things little 11 11 the whole lump so
[58:47] let's do an inventory check today and
[58:49] just measure yourself with god's word
[58:51] not with one another but god's word
[58:53] that's what he's called us to it's a
[58:54] walk between your biggest
