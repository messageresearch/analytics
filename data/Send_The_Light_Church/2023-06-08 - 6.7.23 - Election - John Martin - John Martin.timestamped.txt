[33:33] of the same faith
[33:36] amen and I'll tell you that's important
[33:40] amen because there's only one faith
[33:43] only one Faith well God bless you today
[33:47] if you would turn with me to our opening
[33:49] scripture in the Book of Romans chapter
[33:51] 9 I'm going to start with verse number
[33:53] six
[33:59] good to have brother Mark back
[34:02] amen we've missed you brother Mark
[34:04] as I've
[34:06] repeatedly told you
[34:09] amen
[34:11] amen we want to talk about election
[34:17] and maybe do a couple services on it
[34:19] it's a very
[34:21] a very delicate subject in fact the
[34:25] prophet told us
[34:27] uh that he warned the ministers to stay
[34:30] away
[34:31] from
[34:32] that word predestination
[34:36] and so
[34:38] um but I feel that it's important
[34:41] because the enemy is the author of
[34:44] confusion and he he wants to get in
[34:47] there so I just I Believe by the grace
[34:50] of God we can we can help the elect
[34:54] amen amen so before we begin reading
[34:57] let's approach our heavenly father
[35:00] dear God we're not uh equipped or
[35:05] uh
[35:07] where we don't have what it takes Lord
[35:11] to bring this great subject and we
[35:14] approach you with fear and trembling
[35:19] just knowing what your Prophet had said
[35:22] and how easily these things can be taken
[35:25] by the enemy and bring a confusion into
[35:30] people's mind
[35:33] but Lord you're able by the Holy Spirit
[35:35] to
[35:37] take Thy word and rightly divide
[35:41] this great subject and we pray that you
[35:44] would come and put your blessings upon
[35:49] this
[35:51] this series Lord and we pray that you
[35:55] would give us a a clear
[35:59] understanding Lord of what you would
[36:02] have us as your elect to do to get ready
[36:06] for a Rapture because that's what it's
[36:08] all about father bless the reading of
[36:12] your word now and your quotes and all
[36:15] the things that would be said I pray
[36:16] that you would bless the hearers Lord
[36:19] those that would be
[36:22] hear this this evening and those that
[36:25] would be watching on the live stream and
[36:28] those that would perhaps go back to the
[36:30] archives I just pray that you would
[36:33] bless the hearers of the word father we
[36:36] thank you for these things now we give
[36:38] you praise in advance in Jesus Christ's
[36:40] name amen
[36:42] amen Romans chapter 9 starting with
[36:46] verse 6 and I like what Schofield said
[36:49] here right before verse 6 he says it's
[36:51] the distinction between Jews who are
[36:54] mere natural descendants from Abraham
[36:56] and Jews who are also of the spiritual
[37:00] seed
[37:01] and the word says starting with verse
[37:03] number six not as though the word of God
[37:06] had taken unto the fact for they are not
[37:09] all Israel which are Israel
[37:13] neither because our uh they are the Seed
[37:17] of Abraham are they all children
[37:22] but in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[37:26] that is they which are the children of
[37:30] the flesh
[37:32] these are not the children of God
[37:37] but the children of the promise are
[37:39] counted for the seed for This Is The
[37:43] Word of Promise at that
[37:45] at this time will I come and Sarah shall
[37:48] have a son and not only this but when
[37:51] Rebecca also had conceived by one
[37:54] even by Our Father Isaac for the
[37:58] children being not yet born neither
[38:00] having done any good or evil that the
[38:02] purpose of God according to election
[38:03] might stand out of works but of him that
[38:06] calleth
[38:07] it was said unto her
[38:09] the Elder Shall Serve the younger
[38:14] as it is written Jacob have I loved and
[38:17] Esau have I hated
[38:20] amen God bless you may be seated now
[38:22] these are some pretty
[38:24] we think of God as being a
[38:27] a fair
[38:29] loving God which only does good
[38:33] and there's all true statement
[38:36] but how could that same God say I hated
[38:40] Esau
[38:41] and how could he say that
[38:45] um some of the children of Abraham were
[38:49] were not uh uh uh uh uh of of of of the
[38:55] seed and and and he also makes the
[38:58] statement that they which are the
[39:01] children of the flesh are not the
[39:03] children of God
[39:04] so these are like really strong
[39:06] statements
[39:09] brother Branham says in the message why
[39:11] he says my sheep hear my voice and a
[39:14] stranger they don't follow it depends on
[39:17] what's the on the inside of you drawing
[39:20] moving it's the elect always that God
[39:23] speaks to and sends his message to so we
[39:27] can see that when God is bringing forth
[39:29] his word he is speaking to the elect
[39:33] right and the elect will catch it I want
[39:37] us to all of us ask this question today
[39:40] how do we know we are elected
[39:44] how do we know
[39:46] is it because we are in a message church
[39:49] we feel that we've
[39:51] we're elected because we heard the
[39:53] message and we believe the message is
[39:55] true does that make us elected
[39:57] and so
[40:02] that's what this
[40:04] series is going to be for it's going to
[40:07] if not all Jews are Jews not all
[40:10] believers are are Christians
[40:13] and not all that are in the message are
[40:17] elected and so what determines that
[40:21] there are certain things that
[40:24] that we all understand like this there
[40:27] are certain things that the Bible tells
[40:29] us that the elect will do
[40:33] and it's by that that we know whether
[40:36] we're elected
[40:38] that's it forget about how you feel
[40:41] right forget about what you think
[40:43] forget about how God is used you none of
[40:46] that matters
[40:47] what matters is our is our life lining
[40:50] up with the word right
[40:52] first John 5 13 says these things have I
[40:55] written unto you that believe on the
[40:57] name of the son of God that ye may know
[41:00] that you have eternal life
[41:02] and that ye may believe in the name of
[41:04] the son of God so the things that are
[41:06] written in the Bible lets us know
[41:09] whether we have eternal life or not and
[41:10] I believe it's the same way for the
[41:13] elect to whether we know that we're
[41:15] elected
[41:17] because there is a false sense of
[41:19] security about feeling elected
[41:23] so Jesus told us in John 5 39 search the
[41:26] scriptures friend them you think you
[41:27] have eternal life but they are they that
[41:30] testify of me and again the scriptures
[41:32] that we're going to get into are going
[41:34] to tell us whether we're elected or not
[41:37] now we here's the here's the the
[41:40] terrible thing about our feelings
[41:45] our feelings tells us that we're elected
[41:48] no matter what
[41:50] but the scriptures don't say that the
[41:52] scripture says this is what the elect
[41:54] will do this is what the elect won't do
[41:57] right and that's more important than how
[41:59] I feel about myself
[42:03] well the first thing I want to say is we
[42:05] have nothing to do with being elected
[42:09] by God
[42:11] or the elected of God or the chosen of
[42:13] God we have nothing to do with it not
[42:16] one single thing
[42:18] Jesus said you have not chosen me but I
[42:21] have chosen you
[42:23] it has nothing to do with our works but
[42:26] it has everything to do with God
[42:30] First Peter chapter 1 verse 1.
[42:34] First Peter chapter 1 verse one we're
[42:36] just going to try to a little Foundation
[42:37] here Peter an apostle of Jesus Christ to
[42:42] The Strangers
[42:44] scattered throughout pontus galatia
[42:46] caspadonia Asia berthania
[42:50] now
[42:52] he says elect according to the
[42:54] foreknowledge of God the father so these
[42:57] strangers this the elective God is
[43:00] scattered they're just scattered all
[43:03] over the world
[43:05] and he's speaking to them Peter is
[43:08] speaking to the elect that are scattered
[43:13] according to the foreknowledge of God in
[43:15] other words God knows them
[43:20] now look there are electrical in the
[43:22] foreknowledge of God the Father through
[43:25] sanctification of the spirit
[43:28] the elect go through a process of
[43:32] sanctification that's all there is to it
[43:35] unto what does it take them to that that
[43:39] sanctification takes him to the
[43:41] obedience
[43:43] and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus
[43:45] Christ Grace unto you and peace be
[43:47] multiplied
[43:48] oh I just love these scriptures
[43:54] and um we we God knows whose or his
[43:59] we sit there and we question who's who
[44:03] but God knows
[44:06] and they're scattered throughout the
[44:08] world and God has called you and he's
[44:11] called me to go hunt them down
[44:16] now we can't go up to somebody and say
[44:19] you're elect you're not you're like
[44:21] you're not
[44:22] we don't know
[44:24] but he's called us to bring them the
[44:27] gospel if they are left they will
[44:29] receive the Gospel and they will come
[44:31] out of whatever they're in I'll
[44:34] and they will walk in the light of the
[44:36] word that's just it that's what the
[44:37] elect does
[44:39] they continue to walk in the light as he
[44:41] is in the light
[44:43] he says if you uh uh I know you believe
[44:46] but if you if you you want to be my
[44:48] disciple you got to continue to walk in
[44:50] the word
[44:54] Ephesians 1 verse 4 and 5 here Ephesians
[44:57] verse 1 4 and 5 according as he has
[45:01] chosen Us in him when did this happen
[45:05] before the foundation of the world so
[45:08] way before Adam and Eve way before the
[45:13] world was created that we are we we have
[45:18] been chosen that we should be holy
[45:21] and Without Blame before him in love
[45:25] see how the elect we know what the elect
[45:28] will end up being
[45:30] because that's it just we're
[45:32] predestinated to it
[45:35] having predestinated us onto the
[45:39] adoption of children by Jesus Christ
[45:41] according to the good pleasure of his
[45:44] will
[45:45] now God is going to see his elect
[45:49] through somehow or some way they're
[45:51] predestinated
[45:54] the elect has been predestined to be
[45:56] without spot or wrinkle or any such
[46:00] thing
[46:02] now the point I want to bring here and
[46:03] this is to me a powerful point
[46:07] there will be many things that God will
[46:09] do that only he can do
[46:12] for his elect in other words you can't
[46:14] do it
[46:16] [Music]
[46:17] but he will do that for you because you
[46:20] are his elect
[46:22] and I'm talking about Mighty things he
[46:25] will deliver you out of things because
[46:27] you can't do it
[46:30] I just think that is so beautiful that
[46:33] our God loves us that much to pick us up
[46:36] through the sands of time and take us
[46:38] through situations to deliver us
[46:41] yeah
[46:42] as amazing grace goes through many
[46:45] dangers and tolls and stairs I've
[46:47] already come his grace have brought me
[46:49] safe this far and Grace will lead me
[46:51] home
[46:53] the scripture says he's going to shorten
[46:55] the days
[46:57] or or or
[46:58] we wouldn't make it so another thing
[47:02] that God is going to do that we couldn't
[47:04] do
[47:05] just for us he's doing it just for the
[47:08] elect
[47:09] now there are many things that you will
[47:12] have to do that only you can do and he
[47:15] won't do them for you
[47:21] and just because we're elected doesn't
[47:23] mean we don't have to do them
[47:27] because without us doing those things we
[47:31] can't make it
[47:33] this is how serious it is
[47:36] I'm going to give you an example here II
[47:38] Timothy 2 18. and 219 second Timothy 2
[47:42] 18 19.
[47:44] who concerning the truth have aired
[47:48] saying that the resurrection is passed
[47:51] already and overthrowing the faith of
[47:55] some so we see here that you know Paul
[47:58] is trying to tell Timothy to avoid uh
[48:01] vain babbling and and things that that
[48:04] are not edifying because they take you
[48:07] away from the truth and there was a
[48:10] couple people who were trying to bring
[48:12] some things that were not true and it
[48:16] overthrew the faith of some now think
[48:19] about that they it overthrew the faith
[48:22] of something in other words they have
[48:23] faith at one time following but then
[48:26] they got listening to the wrong things
[48:28] and they got off path
[48:30] now look at verse 19. nevertheless the
[48:33] foundation of God it stands sure
[48:39] has this seal
[48:41] the Lord knoweth them that are his
[48:44] now here's the part we have to do or we
[48:46] can't make it and let everyone that
[48:49] nameth the name of Christ depart from
[48:50] iniquity
[48:56] you know there are certain things that
[48:58] God will do for you because you just
[49:00] can't do it but there are certain things
[49:02] he expects his elect to do and we have
[49:05] to do it and this is just one of them
[49:09] our opening scripture we talked about
[49:11] the elect go through the process uh or
[49:15] one of the scriptures that opening
[49:16] scriptures but go through the process of
[49:18] the sanctification of the spirit unto
[49:20] obedience that is something that we have
[49:23] to do God won't do that for us
[49:26] we have to be willing to do what he
[49:28] tells us to do
[49:34] God ain't going to go through that
[49:36] process for us
[49:39] we have to go through it
[49:42] now the devil makes people think they're
[49:44] saved when they're really not
[49:47] there's a lot of people he said many
[49:49] will come to me in that day
[49:53] he makes people think they got the Holy
[49:55] Ghost when they don't
[49:58] he makes people think they're elected
[50:00] regardless of the life that they're
[50:01] living
[50:03] in other words you've heard the whole
[50:05] thing I don't care if I'm wrong or not
[50:07] I'm I still believe what I believe
[50:12] you know they'll do whatever they have
[50:15] to do defend their religion
[50:19] and we're not about defending whether
[50:21] we're in the message or not in the
[50:22] message or the lect or not we're about
[50:25] finding out is my life lining up with
[50:28] the word
[50:29] that's what's important for the bride
[50:31] that's what's important for the elect
[50:33] they're concerned about where they're
[50:36] standing with God you know sometimes we
[50:39] can have the spirit of of uh you know
[50:41] we're unwilling to be
[50:44] um
[50:45] unwilling to be challenged by anybody
[50:51] and a person that's unwilling to be
[50:53] challenged by another person to me is a
[50:56] person who who who doesn't even not
[51:00] willing to take a good look into the
[51:02] word to make sure that he's lining up
[51:04] correctly that's how I feel about that
[51:07] subject
[51:08] because you never know when God is is is
[51:11] using somebody to speak to you
[51:15] now brother Brian said in the message
[51:17] thy loving kindness he says oh what a
[51:19] miserable thing it is the devil perverts
[51:21] those things he makes you think you're
[51:23] living when you're dead
[51:27] and the scripture talks about it but
[51:29] he's saying here the devil makes people
[51:31] feel and think certain things and it's
[51:35] up to us to take a look at the reality
[51:38] is is my life is it is it paralleling
[51:42] with that word says I what the elect
[51:44] should be doing
[51:47] and these services are going to be
[51:49] dedicated to helping us see and Inspire
[51:51] us to follow the word of what the
[51:55] elector going to do instead of just
[51:57] being comfortable with just saying I'm
[51:59] alive uh you know because you can go on
[52:01] that path for so long that you don't
[52:02] even care about anything else
[52:05] in the message the invisible Union of
[52:08] the Bride brother Branham says this Miss
[52:11] Grace I'm going to talk about you know
[52:13] the Bible declares said to the elect
[52:16] lady
[52:17] that if you notice elect it comes from
[52:21] the word elected lady
[52:24] one lady amongst all the other ladies
[52:27] was elected and that's what I just want
[52:30] to say to me if I'm truly elected if I
[52:34] am the bride I ought to be the most
[52:36] grateful person in the world because I
[52:40] had nothing to do with it
[52:42] it was him that chose me and it should
[52:45] put me in such a space as a place that
[52:48] I'll do whatever you want me to do Lord
[52:52] so trying to really decipher whether
[52:55] we're elected or not can be confusing
[52:58] have has anybody ever battled that
[53:00] before absolutely
[53:04] you can know if you're elected
[53:07] by faith only
[53:12] it's by faith
[53:15] what brother John you just got done
[53:17] telling me that my my life has to line
[53:19] up with that word that's exactly it you
[53:22] have to believe that that word is really
[53:25] requiring you to live that life
[53:28] It Is by faith it's the only you have to
[53:31] believe so much that you bring your body
[53:33] under subjection to what that word says
[53:39] first Thessalonians 1 4 says knowing
[53:41] brother beloved your election of God
[53:46] knowing Brethren beloved your election
[53:50] of God I believe you can know
[53:52] I believe you can really really know not
[53:55] just feel not just say but really really
[53:57] know
[53:59] Galatians 3 7 says know ye therefore
[54:03] that they which are of Faith the same
[54:07] are the children of Abraham
[54:11] so here it is you're a Seed of Abraham
[54:14] through faith because that is the seed
[54:19] it it wasn't well we'll get into it but
[54:22] it wasn't of uh the efforts that Sarah
[54:25] and Abraham made you know to get a son
[54:28] and and and that was going to be the
[54:31] seed because that wasn't of I believe
[54:33] what your word says Lord I believe that
[54:36] your promise said this that was the seed
[54:40] are you with me
[54:43] second Peter chapter 1 verse 10
[54:45] wherefore the rather Brethren give
[54:47] diligence to make your calling and your
[54:51] election sure
[54:54] for if you do these things ye shall
[54:57] never fall
[54:58] but if you don't do them
[55:00] what's going to happen
[55:03] what do you tell Cain what God tell Cain
[55:07] hey if you do good you'll be accepted
[55:11] but if you don't sin lies at the door
[55:15] not all that are called Jews are Jews
[55:18] not all Israel is Israel not all
[55:20] Christians are Christians and not all
[55:22] that call themselves bride are the elect
[55:24] of God
[55:26] truth
[55:27] all right let's go to our opening
[55:29] scripture now and then we're gonna I
[55:31] just want to take my time with this if I
[55:34] could
[55:36] Romans 9 verse 7 neither because they
[55:39] are the Seed of Abraham are they all
[55:42] children
[55:44] but in Isaac shall thy seed be called
[55:53] hmm
[55:55] hmm
[55:57] it's called John chapter 8 verse 31.
[56:01] Jesus is is telling the Jews which had
[56:04] believed on Jesus to a point but not all
[56:07] the way but to a point he said if you
[56:11] continue in my word then are you my
[56:13] disciples indeed
[56:16] and you shall know the truth and the
[56:18] truth shall make you free and look what
[56:20] they said here they they answered him we
[56:23] be Abraham's seed
[56:26] and we're never in bondage to any man
[56:30] how says Thou ye shall be made free see
[56:34] they didn't even realize that their own
[56:37] lustful desires inside of them they were
[56:41] a prisoner to their their own nature
[56:45] right true
[56:49] and Jesus answered them verily I say
[56:51] unto you whosoever committed sin is the
[56:53] servant of sin and the servant abideth
[56:55] not in the house forever but the son to
[56:57] buy it for forever if the son therefore
[56:59] shall make you free shall be free indeed
[57:01] verse 37 I know he says I know you're
[57:05] Abraham seed
[57:07] but you seek to kill me
[57:10] because my word have no place in you so
[57:15] he's he's responding to them that are
[57:18] saying we are Abraham's seed and he said
[57:20] yes I know you're Abraham seed but you
[57:23] seek to kill me
[57:25] so now he's going to get into rightly
[57:27] dividing
[57:29] which CD is
[57:31] of the flesh or of the spirit
[57:34] he says I speak that which I have seen
[57:36] with my father and you do that which you
[57:38] have seen with your father
[57:41] and of course they weren't you know
[57:44] they were they were not thinking
[57:47] they were they were still thinking
[57:49] Abraham they answered and said unto him
[57:51] Abraham is Our Father and Jesus saith on
[57:54] him if Abraham if you were Abraham's
[57:56] children you would do the works of
[57:58] Abraham
[58:01] so I can see where these these Jews were
[58:05] literally just going more confused and
[58:07] more confused as the message was going
[58:09] on
[58:09] [Music]
[58:12] because they they they they already
[58:15] claimed they were Abraham's seed
[58:17] Jesus already said yes you're Abraham
[58:20] seed
[58:22] um uh and and now Jesus is is is
[58:25] speaking about uh uh who who their
[58:30] father is
[58:32] it's almost like when if it was just
[58:34] like this when when Jesus uh when God
[58:38] was speaking
[58:39] to uh the the the these the serpent
[58:45] about
[58:47] um his seed
[58:49] and the and uh the the natural seed uh
[58:54] that that that he laid inside of of of
[58:58] Eve and the other seed that was inside
[59:02] and it talked about those two seeds
[59:04] having enmity with one another and you
[59:06] can see that
[59:08] the natural seed is always fighting
[59:11] against the spiritual seed always
[59:13] there's there's there's just like
[59:16] nothing in them to have peace
[59:22] they answered and said unto him Abraham
[59:25] is our father Jesus said If Abraham uh
[59:28] if he were Abraham's children you would
[59:30] do the works of Abraham but now you seek
[59:34] to kill me a man that have told you the
[59:36] truth which I have heard of God this did
[59:40] not Abraham
[59:43] so now he's he's making it clear
[59:47] this this the natural Seed of Abraham
[59:53] just like the the the the 12 uh
[59:57] Patriarchs
[1:00:00] the the the the the the the the the the
[1:00:03] children of
[1:00:06] um Ishmael if I could say it like that
[1:00:08] are constantly fighting against Israel
[1:00:15] and it's no different today when we're
[1:00:17] in the flesh we know this if we're not
[1:00:19] in the spirit we'll get end up getting a
[1:00:21] little snippy at somebody
[1:00:25] true
[1:00:26] you you don't see somebody that's in the
[1:00:29] spirit wanting to get down on somebody
[1:00:31] it just don't don't don't happen
[1:00:35] so Abraham he carried two seeds with
[1:00:38] inside him the scripture says one father
[1:00:41] and it was Isaac and Ishmael
[1:00:44] one was conceived through the desire of
[1:00:47] the flesh
[1:00:49] you might say we talked about permissive
[1:00:52] and perfect will of God in our men's
[1:00:54] meeting
[1:00:55] we might say Well they're they're
[1:00:58] intention was to bring forth the promise
[1:01:01] of God
[1:01:03] but yet it was the permissible God and
[1:01:07] it it took their flesh their desire of
[1:01:10] their flesh to bring it to pass where is
[1:01:12] the the promise of God just like we're
[1:01:15] chosen we're elected we don't have
[1:01:17] nothing to do with it God's going to
[1:01:18] bring forth uh Isaac and we don't have
[1:01:22] nothing to do with it God just told
[1:01:24] Abraham he says I'm going to visit Sarah
[1:01:27] about a year from now or however that
[1:01:29] scripture went I'm going to do it I'm
[1:01:31] going to visit her at the time appointed
[1:01:33] and she's going to have all Abraham dad
[1:01:36] to do was keep believing keep believing
[1:01:38] keep believing that's all we got to do
[1:01:40] is elect keep believing keep believing
[1:01:44] amen
[1:01:46] so the other was conceived to believing
[1:01:49] the promise of God
[1:01:53] now even though God did greatly bless
[1:01:56] Ishmael naturally he was never the
[1:01:59] predestinated seed of God
[1:02:03] he was never the predestinated child of
[1:02:06] God
[1:02:07] think about that God greatly blessed
[1:02:10] Ishmael naturally
[1:02:13] just bless them they had they their
[1:02:16] descendants to this day have so much
[1:02:19] money
[1:02:21] have so many nations have so much so
[1:02:24] much naturally
[1:02:26] but yet he was never a predestinated
[1:02:29] child of God
[1:02:31] that's why we can never look at whether
[1:02:34] we're in God's favor because we're being
[1:02:37] blessed or not
[1:02:39] it has nothing to do with it
[1:02:45] Isaac was the elected child of God
[1:02:49] now if you think about it
[1:02:54] Israel suffered a lot more
[1:02:57] than any of those Nations
[1:03:00] and they're the elect of God
[1:03:04] so I think you're probably going to be
[1:03:06] in God's favor more
[1:03:08] if you're suffering for the right
[1:03:10] reasons
[1:03:13] Romans 9 verse 8.
[1:03:17] that is they which are the children of
[1:03:20] the flesh these are not the children of
[1:03:25] God
[1:03:26] but the children of the promise are
[1:03:28] counted for the seed so I want to say
[1:03:30] this with this statement here
[1:03:34] laughs
[1:03:35] if you're comfortable being in the flesh
[1:03:38] take a look at this scripture
[1:03:40] let it provoke you let it inspire you
[1:03:43] let it let it
[1:03:46] get you out of the flesh
[1:03:48] let it get you to start praying more get
[1:03:50] in the spirit more because the promise
[1:03:53] is not to the children of Flesh and
[1:03:55] here's the probably the biggest
[1:03:57] trick that the devil plays on people
[1:04:02] is I'm still alive no matter if I walk
[1:04:06] in the flesh or not
[1:04:11] we can't please God
[1:04:15] so somewhere down the line we've we've
[1:04:18] we've we must take this word more
[1:04:21] serious
[1:04:23] and not be looking for a preacher that's
[1:04:26] going to make us feel elected regardless
[1:04:29] of the life we're living
[1:04:33] uh teachers with engineers and just
[1:04:35] wanting our favorite type of of ministry
[1:04:38] that makes us feel what about just Lord
[1:04:41] lay it on me the way it is
[1:04:46] for this verse 9 for This Is The Word of
[1:04:50] Promise at this time will I come and
[1:04:53] Sarah shall have a son
[1:04:57] Isaac came into existence by the perfect
[1:04:59] will of God through the spoken word of
[1:05:01] God
[1:05:03] Ishmael came into existence by the will
[1:05:06] of the flesh through the works of the
[1:05:08] flesh
[1:05:10] it was not the perfect will of God
[1:05:14] allowed it
[1:05:16] but you talk about all the problems that
[1:05:18] it caused
[1:05:20] and to this day they're being caused
[1:05:25] right so the will of the flesh is
[1:05:27] absolutely the worst thing for us
[1:05:31] they which are the children of the flesh
[1:05:33] are not the children of God
[1:05:36] so we can be a child of God and walk in
[1:05:38] the flesh
[1:05:40] but I'll say it like this the Holy Ghost
[1:05:41] is going to straighten you out
[1:05:44] because that's the job of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:46] he's leading guide you into all truth
[1:05:49] he's not going to sit there and Pat you
[1:05:50] on the back and say well you don't have
[1:05:52] to worry about that until next service
[1:05:55] no he's he's wanting us to come into the
[1:06:00] maturity of what the seed or the elected
[1:06:02] are supposed to be they are going to be
[1:06:04] without spot or wrinkle
[1:06:06] we're going to be just like him when he
[1:06:08] comes
[1:06:09] all right Romans chapter 8 verse 5.
[1:06:18] Romans 8. verse 5 says for they that are
[1:06:22] after the flesh
[1:06:24] they do mind the things of the flesh
[1:06:28] so their mind is just on what they want
[1:06:33] but they that are after the spirit
[1:06:36] the things of the spirit so just think
[1:06:38] about your your mind where your mind has
[1:06:41] been where's your mind been
[1:06:45] are you looking to manifest more Christ
[1:06:47] are you just kind of like hoping that
[1:06:50] somehow going to church is going to
[1:06:52] somehow do that for you
[1:06:54] it's nothing about church attendance
[1:06:56] making you what you ought to be it's
[1:06:59] talking about where your mind is at on a
[1:07:00] regular basis and I I understand that we
[1:07:03] all go through tremendous trials all of
[1:07:06] us do
[1:07:07] and we got so many things to bother us
[1:07:10] to distract us we got so many things
[1:07:12] trying to to get us to make goals
[1:07:16] but you know
[1:07:18] if you don't make your a number one goal
[1:07:20] with God I want you to make me the
[1:07:23] manifested bride of Christ I want you to
[1:07:26] make make sure that I know that I'm
[1:07:28] doing everything I can to be ready in
[1:07:30] that hour if that is not your main goal
[1:07:34] you're easily going to be distracted
[1:07:37] from our purpose
[1:07:41] and what we've been predestinated to
[1:07:45] for to be calmly minded is going to end
[1:07:48] up in death
[1:07:51] but to be spiritually minded is what
[1:07:53] life
[1:07:54] and peace
[1:07:56] and peace
[1:08:00] it was not
[1:08:03] able
[1:08:06] that killed Cain
[1:08:08] Abel was a man of peace
[1:08:12] Isaac was a man of peace
[1:08:16] it was those that were in the flesh
[1:08:19] they were the ones that didn't mind
[1:08:22] like these Jews these Jews didn't mine
[1:08:25] hey let's kill Jesus he don't agree with
[1:08:28] us
[1:08:31] all right because the carnal mind is
[1:08:35] enmity against God for it is not subject
[1:08:37] to the law of God indeed neither indeed
[1:08:40] can be the carnal mind is enmity against
[1:08:45] God I wonder why that is
[1:08:48] because I don't believe the kernel mind
[1:08:50] has the ability to trust God
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:54] I don't believe it has the ability to
[1:08:57] trust God it has its limits I'll Trust
[1:08:59] You Lord as long as I see this
[1:09:03] but as soon as I don't see this
[1:09:07] for it is not subject to the word
[1:09:10] neither indeed can it be oh my that is
[1:09:18] so
[1:09:19] scary
[1:09:22] we must come subject to the word amen
[1:09:26] so then they that are in the flesh
[1:09:31] they can't plea can they cannot please
[1:09:33] God we might say this Brothers they
[1:09:35] can't be in the perfect will of God
[1:09:37] can't be in the perfect will of God
[1:09:40] it's permissible of God but not the
[1:09:42] perfect
[1:09:44] but ye are not in the flesh but in the
[1:09:47] spirit if so be that the spirit of God
[1:09:51] dwelleth in you
[1:09:57] now if any man have not the spirit of
[1:09:59] Christ he is none of his
[1:10:02] no I wanted no we all know we all feel
[1:10:06] that I have God's holy spirit is that
[1:10:09] true
[1:10:12] so as long as we feel that we have God's
[1:10:16] holy spirit this verse
[1:10:19] doesn't concern us
[1:10:23] right
[1:10:26] I mean that that's that feeling well I
[1:10:28] got the holy spirit because you can you
[1:10:31] can
[1:10:32] be the elect
[1:10:35] and be in the flesh
[1:10:39] and that can get kind of comfortable
[1:10:42] but the thing is you know brother
[1:10:44] Brandon talked about that Spirit can he
[1:10:46] kind of leave you because you can grieve
[1:10:47] it
[1:10:49] and then you're just there left still
[1:10:51] elect
[1:10:55] so
[1:10:57] I like to say it like this if if I see
[1:11:00] that the the the fruit of the spirit is
[1:11:03] just bubbling out of me
[1:11:05] then I can have confidence on his
[1:11:09] but if I don't see that happening and I
[1:11:12] just whatever my flesh wants to do but
[1:11:15] I'm still going to be claiming on the
[1:11:17] elect
[1:11:19] all I'm doing is deceiving myself the
[1:11:21] scripture says he that reads the word
[1:11:24] knows the word chooses not to do it
[1:11:26] deceives himself
[1:11:28] right that's the scripture
[1:11:31] and if Christ be in you now I like this
[1:11:34] here's the evidence if Christ be in you
[1:11:36] the body is dead because of sin and the
[1:11:40] spirit is life because of righteousness
[1:11:42] so there is something inside you that's
[1:11:45] dead
[1:11:46] and I and it wouldn't be like somebody
[1:11:49] that you would see in a coffin not that
[1:11:51] kind of dead
[1:11:52] right so there's something else that has
[1:11:55] to be dead inside of us
[1:11:57] it would have to be our will
[1:12:00] our will would have to be dead
[1:12:03] and Jesus the way he explained it to us
[1:12:06] he said that we have to actually deny
[1:12:10] ourselves daily
[1:12:12] it's not a One-Shot deal
[1:12:15] so if we don't do it that day we're
[1:12:17] alive
[1:12:19] the flesh speaking of are you with me
[1:12:23] all right
[1:12:24] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:12:27] Jesus from the dead dwells in you he
[1:12:28] that raised up Christ from the dead he
[1:12:30] should also Quicken your mortal bodies
[1:12:32] by the spirit that dwelleth in you
[1:12:33] therefore brethren we are debtors
[1:12:36] not to the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:12:39] for if you live after the flesh you
[1:12:41] shall die but if you through the spirit
[1:12:45] do mortify the Deeds of them the body ye
[1:12:49] shall live now they're remember the
[1:12:51] scripture there that we go through a
[1:12:53] process of sanctification
[1:12:56] we have to choose to crucify our flesh
[1:13:00] that can't that can't that can't be oh I
[1:13:04] you know I'm just going to do what I
[1:13:05] want until you know the I go to church
[1:13:08] and and and and and the preacher looks
[1:13:11] right at me points his finger at me and
[1:13:13] says you're doing wrong
[1:13:15] [Music]
[1:13:16] and then I'll try harder that's not
[1:13:19] dying out daily
[1:13:23] so something that we we need to do now
[1:13:27] I'm going to say this is how the Holy
[1:13:28] Spirit leads every one of us verse 14.
[1:13:31] as for as many as are led by the spirit
[1:13:33] of God they are the sons of God
[1:13:35] I believe the Holy Ghost leads us to
[1:13:39] crucify our flesh
[1:13:41] leads us to die out so that Christ can
[1:13:45] live through us
[1:13:49] now not only did Abraham carry two
[1:13:53] different seeds
[1:13:54] but also his son Isaac carried two
[1:13:58] different seeds
[1:14:00] one was God's seed and one was of his
[1:14:06] flesh
[1:14:08] Romans 9 10 not only this Romans 9 10
[1:14:13] not only this but when
[1:14:17] Rebecca also had conceived by what by
[1:14:22] one
[1:14:23] even by Our Father Isaac
[1:14:27] for the children
[1:14:29] being
[1:14:31] not yet born
[1:14:34] neither having done good or evil
[1:14:37] that the purpose of God according to
[1:14:41] election might stand not of works but of
[1:14:45] him that calleth
[1:14:48] I'll tell you
[1:14:49] if you heard God called you you're my
[1:14:52] elect
[1:14:53] we ought to be the happiest people in
[1:14:55] the whole world
[1:14:59] brother Brandon said in the message
[1:15:00] Ephesians Church age he said again there
[1:15:03] were two children from the Flesh of the
[1:15:05] same parents
[1:15:07] there were twins of Isaac and Rebecca
[1:15:11] and one of the elect and one was the
[1:15:13] elective God and the other was a
[1:15:15] reprobate
[1:15:18] both worship God
[1:15:20] in every single case there was worship
[1:15:24] of God involved in every single case
[1:15:27] the evil hated the righteous and
[1:15:31] persecuted the righteous
[1:15:33] in some cases the evil destroyed the
[1:15:36] righteous but notice they were planted
[1:15:40] together they lived together they both
[1:15:43] made claims upon God and worshiped God
[1:15:49] I mean what more could we do than to
[1:15:52] stand and say
[1:15:53] yes God saved me I'm the elect of God I
[1:15:58] and worship there's got to be something
[1:16:01] that makes us different
[1:16:05] and I'm so glad God sent a message
[1:16:09] in this hour
[1:16:11] to help us rightly Define
[1:16:15] because throughout brother Bynum's
[1:16:17] Ministry he would talk about those two
[1:16:19] seeds that they were both religious they
[1:16:23] both went to church
[1:16:25] so we can't look and just look at one
[1:16:28] another and say Well they're the
[1:16:30] religious
[1:16:32] I can't look at myself and say I'm
[1:16:34] religious
[1:16:35] I I need to I need to look at what
[1:16:39] at the part of my life
[1:16:41] is it lining up with the word that the
[1:16:44] Alexa they will do
[1:16:46] that's what's important
[1:16:49] so it was said
[1:16:51] it was said verse 12. now it was said of
[1:16:53] Unto her the Elder Shall Serve the
[1:16:56] younger as it is written Jacob have I
[1:16:59] loved and Esau
[1:17:01] have I hated
[1:17:05] God knew
[1:17:06] God knew
[1:17:08] who
[1:17:12] who was going to serve them
[1:17:15] God knows everybody who's going to serve
[1:17:17] them or not I think God is the only one
[1:17:19] who could say uh so and so I loved and
[1:17:23] and so and so I hated
[1:17:29] Jacob and Esau are a perfect type
[1:17:34] of every spiritual believer today
[1:17:38] who is first born in the flesh by the
[1:17:41] will of the Flesh of a mother and a
[1:17:43] father
[1:17:46] who then must be born again the second
[1:17:48] time by the will of God to do the will
[1:17:51] of God
[1:17:52] and that's the type because Esau was
[1:17:55] born first he had the birthright he was
[1:17:59] supposed to get it
[1:18:01] but Jacob
[1:18:04] the supplanter did some deceiving
[1:18:07] with some help with his mother who knew
[1:18:12] and
[1:18:14] and stole the birthright and that's what
[1:18:16] we have to do
[1:18:18] the natural man
[1:18:20] the natural man ends up
[1:18:23] serving the spiritual man in every one
[1:18:26] of us
[1:18:28] when we die out we're no longer serving
[1:18:32] the flesh
[1:18:34] but we make brother bam says the spirit
[1:18:37] inside you makes your body obey
[1:18:41] so I'll just say like this the older man
[1:18:46] serves the younger
[1:18:49] right because he was born first at our
[1:18:51] birthday and then whenever we were born
[1:18:54] again
[1:18:55] praise God
[1:18:59] so in other words
[1:19:01] we were in bondage to our flesh at one
[1:19:04] time serving our own lustful desires
[1:19:07] and when the new birth started then the
[1:19:11] flesh had to start serving and obeying
[1:19:14] the will of God or what we said
[1:19:17] because remember it has to go through
[1:19:18] free Miller agency
[1:19:20] so the Elder nature serves the younger
[1:19:24] the firstborn ends up dying out the body
[1:19:27] which is used to serve sin now ends up
[1:19:30] serving the second nature which is God
[1:19:32] thus giving way to receive the
[1:19:35] birthright blessings for the firstborn
[1:19:39] and that's eternal life
[1:19:41] all right so let's just kind of go
[1:19:43] through this in Romans chapter six I
[1:19:45] told you I'm really taking my time
[1:19:49] because there's just so many good types
[1:19:51] and and things in here
[1:19:54] Romans 6 verse 15.
[1:19:59] What then shall we sin because we are
[1:20:02] not under the law but under grace God
[1:20:04] forbid know ye not to whom
[1:20:07] uh know you not that to whom you yield
[1:20:10] yourself servants to obey his servant
[1:20:13] you are to whom you obey whether a sin
[1:20:15] unto death or obedience unto
[1:20:17] righteousness but God be thanked that ye
[1:20:20] were the Servants of sin
[1:20:23] we were all
[1:20:25] Esau's but ye have obeyed from the heart
[1:20:30] oh I love that you have obeyed from the
[1:20:34] heart that form of Doctrine which was
[1:20:37] delivered you
[1:20:41] being then made free from sin
[1:20:44] he became Servants of righteousness
[1:20:49] servants now we instead of us just
[1:20:52] wanting others to do things for us we
[1:20:55] now start doing things for others
[1:20:58] I speak after the manner of men because
[1:21:01] of the infirmity of your flesh for as ye
[1:21:05] have you did your members servants to
[1:21:08] uncleanness
[1:21:10] uh and to iniquity unto iniquity even so
[1:21:15] now yield your members servants to
[1:21:18] righteousness unto holiness
[1:21:21] so I see the elect of God they see that
[1:21:24] and they say that is what I need to do
[1:21:28] and you know I'll say uh
[1:21:31] let me just try to word this different
[1:21:33] the elect read that and they say I have
[1:21:35] to do that
[1:21:37] there's something in them
[1:21:39] that's calling there's a deep calling
[1:21:43] the word is calling them to fulfill the
[1:21:45] word they there's no longer a choice
[1:21:48] that's the thing about the elect of God
[1:21:51] they don't have a choice in the matter
[1:21:53] they will manifest the word
[1:21:56] they just know they just believe it to
[1:21:59] do it
[1:22:00] all right so he says here for when ye
[1:22:02] were Servants of sin ye were free from
[1:22:05] righteousness you could basically just
[1:22:07] do whatever you want to do what fruit
[1:22:08] had ye then and those things were of ye
[1:22:11] are now ashamed
[1:22:13] for the end of those things is death but
[1:22:15] now being made free from sin ye became
[1:22:19] servants to God ye have your fruit unto
[1:22:23] holiness
[1:22:24] and the end everlasting life for the
[1:22:27] wages of sin is death but the gift of
[1:22:30] God is eternal life through Jesus Christ
[1:22:32] Our Lord I just love this set of
[1:22:34] scriptures here in Romans because it
[1:22:36] really shows how the uh Elder serves the
[1:22:41] younger
[1:22:43] and and I I brother Marty was sharing
[1:22:47] about how his dad at one time
[1:22:50] used to uh drink and and do the things
[1:22:53] uh of the world and God got a hold of
[1:22:56] his heart and um it just changed his
[1:23:00] life completely now as that change was
[1:23:02] going forth uh Marty being younger than
[1:23:05] his dad of course he looked at him he
[1:23:07] says you know Dad just doesn't seem to
[1:23:09] be fun anymore
[1:23:11] just doesn't seem to be fun anymore
[1:23:14] because a change had happened
[1:23:18] and now instead of just yielding to do
[1:23:20] whatever you wanted to do the new nature
[1:23:23] was taking over and he was he was in
[1:23:27] control if I could say it like this
[1:23:29] because we have a chance to obey God if
[1:23:32] we want
[1:23:34] and he decided I'm gonna I'm gonna start
[1:23:36] doing the things that I should do and
[1:23:38] and and and and brother Marty his
[1:23:41] testimony of his dad was he was a
[1:23:43] changed man is a wonderful man he is a
[1:23:45] good man he he did
[1:23:48] uh become
[1:23:51] so much better than what he was same
[1:23:54] body
[1:23:55] the same body that he was born with
[1:23:59] but the nature had changed
[1:24:03] all right I just want to read some
[1:24:04] quotes here because I believe that
[1:24:06] brother Branham
[1:24:07] was not only the messenger to the
[1:24:09] laodicean church age not just to call
[1:24:11] people out of denominations
[1:24:17] but he was the prophet to the elect
[1:24:22] to me that's like a step
[1:24:25] a step higher and that you know brother
[1:24:27] Branham talked to us about the voice
[1:24:29] that was in The Voice
[1:24:32] and I believe that there's a voice in
[1:24:34] this message just to the elect
[1:24:37] so brother brother Brian said in
[1:24:39] Ephesians Church age he says even some
[1:24:41] true ministers will misunderstand the
[1:24:45] messenger
[1:24:47] because so much has been called God's
[1:24:51] truth by deceivers
[1:24:56] um
[1:24:57] he will do this for even as John was the
[1:25:00] messenger of Truth to the elect so is
[1:25:03] this one the last Messenger to the elect
[1:25:07] and word born bride isn't that beautiful
[1:25:12] in the message Oneness brother Brandon
[1:25:15] says oh my what is it he's got his
[1:25:19] Oneness his two his two his true Oneness
[1:25:24] showing himself among them out of every
[1:25:27] denomination bringing his elect together
[1:25:29] from all kinds of churches from
[1:25:31] everywhere bringing out his children
[1:25:33] falling right in line with his word
[1:25:38] not just coming out of a denomination
[1:25:40] and getting together and saying the
[1:25:42] denominations are wrong
[1:25:44] but coming together and lining up with
[1:25:47] the word the purpose of coming out of
[1:25:49] the churches was to get in line with the
[1:25:52] word
[1:25:53] not just to say the churches were wrong
[1:25:58] now the coming of the Lord Jesus is so
[1:26:01] imminent
[1:26:03] the coming of judgment he's calling he's
[1:26:06] elected together in Oneness with himself
[1:26:09] now this is this is a beautiful quote
[1:26:11] all you got to do is just where you you
[1:26:14] are the Elite where do you put yourself
[1:26:16] with this quote
[1:26:18] he's calling his elect together in
[1:26:20] Oneness with himself the same kind of a
[1:26:23] Ministry he had you know how I sh how I
[1:26:27] sharped
[1:26:29] nope shaped in the church ages here not
[1:26:32] long ago and the big tower that was
[1:26:35] built called The Pyramid but the
[1:26:37] headstone was never put on it remember
[1:26:39] how the lutherans came the westlings
[1:26:41] came in the minority and then down to
[1:26:44] the Pentecost and now what is he doing
[1:26:47] he's calling from that what did he do he
[1:26:52] called out the elect
[1:26:55] to make the lutherans he called out of
[1:26:57] the elect out of the lutherans
[1:27:00] I like that he called out the elect to
[1:27:02] make the Lutheran no he called out the
[1:27:04] elect out of the lutherans to make the
[1:27:07] Le to make their wesleyans he called out
[1:27:10] of the elect out of that to make the
[1:27:12] Pentecostals now he's calling the elect
[1:27:15] out of the pentecologist out to make the
[1:27:18] headstone to come into it
[1:27:22] a very same kind of ministry dropping in
[1:27:25] right a right in on it calling his
[1:27:28] children from all denominations and all
[1:27:30] walks of life so notice with the calling
[1:27:33] of the Pentecostal says do it's to come
[1:27:36] to the Capstone
[1:27:39] Capstone which we know us we know is
[1:27:42] perfect love
[1:27:44] what has he done he has placed with them
[1:27:47] a true teachers true prophets who stay
[1:27:50] with his word the Bible says my sheep
[1:27:54] hear my voice Jesus said if that was his
[1:27:57] voice then it's his voice now and
[1:28:00] anything contrary to that voice it's not
[1:28:03] sheep food
[1:28:06] and the Sheep won't fall what he said
[1:28:08] they won't follow it
[1:28:10] all right I got one quick quote
[1:28:14] and then we're closing
[1:28:16] because this is something hard that you
[1:28:18] just can't
[1:28:19] spend
[1:28:21] a lot of time if you're not
[1:28:23] you know well rested and really into it
[1:28:27] this isn't a Thai Italian Church age
[1:28:28] brother Brian says they received from
[1:28:30] him
[1:28:32] the revelation of the word for each
[1:28:35] period this word revelation brings
[1:28:40] the elect of God out of the world and
[1:28:44] into full Union with Jesus Christ
[1:28:49] so how is the devil deceived so many
[1:28:51] people
[1:28:53] he's got them to think I've come out of
[1:28:56] the world I've come out of the the
[1:28:59] denomination
[1:29:00] I must be elect no
[1:29:04] no Brother Band says there was they came
[1:29:07] out a mixed multitude
[1:29:09] [Music]
[1:29:10] but there was only two elect
[1:29:15] two million came out of Egypt only to
[1:29:17] elect
[1:29:19] so the most important part to me of this
[1:29:21] is we have to come into a full Union
[1:29:24] with Jesus Christ
[1:29:26] and Joshua and Kayla they were of
[1:29:28] another spirit
[1:29:30] they were the only ones that were
[1:29:32] willing to stay with the promise we're
[1:29:34] more than able to take the land we're
[1:29:36] the others they just they went to church
[1:29:38] and they murmured and they complained
[1:29:40] and this was a problem and that's a
[1:29:42] problem everything they went through
[1:29:43] they never seemed to have faith to just
[1:29:45] believe
[1:29:49] even talking about you know I'd be
[1:29:51] better off I was back in the world
[1:29:56] Stand Together
[1:30:00] are you getting something out of this
[1:30:06] this definitely
[1:30:12] I'm trying to provoke us
[1:30:15] and I honestly wish we could take like
[1:30:17] an hour break and come back because
[1:30:20] there's some breaking up the the ground
[1:30:25] of maybe getting real comfortable about
[1:30:28] just feeling that we're alike because
[1:30:29] what we're going to get into next is
[1:30:32] that if a person is elected of God
[1:30:35] there's certain criteria that will take
[1:30:37] place in that person's life
[1:30:40] and and that's what we all need to be
[1:30:43] you know measuring up to see not so much
[1:30:46] how the preacher's making me feel or how
[1:30:49] I'm feeling that day
[1:30:51] but just taking an honest look because
[1:30:54] they're not they're not real
[1:30:57] uh
[1:30:59] hard to figure out things
[1:31:01] they're they're they're they're simple
[1:31:03] things but the the elect they will be
[1:31:06] doing it
[1:31:07] they will be doing it amen let's let's
[1:31:11] just bow before we sing some choruses
[1:31:16] our heavenly father we come to you Lord
[1:31:19] just asking you to come
[1:31:23] and reveal these beautiful truths
[1:31:28] to our heart Lord we don't want you to
[1:31:33] uh
[1:31:36] two
[1:31:37] two
[1:31:39] do anything but help us Lord help us

[1:31:45] exactly where we need to be
[1:31:48] Lord we just want to thank you for that
[1:31:51] Grace today we'll need it tomorrow
[1:31:55] Lord if there's certain areas that we
[1:31:58] just haven't been paying attention to
[1:32:00] remembering when your Prophet had that
[1:32:02] vision
[1:32:04] and he saw the
[1:32:06] a lot the Bride come out of this age
[1:32:10] when some would get out of line he would
[1:32:13] just scream back get back in line
[1:32:17] Lord I pray that as we go through these
[1:32:20] scriptures coming
[1:32:23] Lord that you would help us to hear that
[1:32:26] scream
[1:32:28] that that scream personally to us to get
[1:32:31] back in line
[1:32:32] Lord we just we want to become one with
[1:32:36] you
[1:32:38] just in every aspect we want our life to
[1:32:41] to line up we want this beautiful Union
[1:32:46] and Lord we know that it must go beyond
[1:32:49] our feelings but Glory just we must live
[1:32:52] a totally dedicated life to you help us
[1:32:55] Lord we we stand in need of your grace
[1:32:59] and of your help
[1:33:03] Lord we thank you for putting within us
[1:33:05] your elect
[1:33:07] to make it
[1:33:10] and we also thank you for putting within

[1:33:38] distractions and all the the weird
[1:33:41] things that are happening in this
