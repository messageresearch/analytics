[45:33] Lord your eyes is wider than these

[46:44] in Jesus name
[46:46] amen amen praise the Lord just before we
[46:50] take our seats
[46:52] let's read the scripture
[46:58] Hallelujah
[47:04] I want to read from the book of First
[47:07] Corinthians chapter number four
[47:14] First Corinthians chapter number four
[47:22] I believe you have your Bibles
[47:31] First Corinthians chapter four
[47:35] by the grace of God
[47:40] amen verse 1.
[47:45] let a man sow account of us as of the
[47:50] Ministers of Christ and stewards of the
[47:54] mysteries of God Heavenly Father we pray
[47:58] that you will bless your word
[48:01] this afternoon
[48:02] into our hearts in Jesus Christ's name
[48:05] please be seated
[48:09] God bless you
[48:13] I want to thank Pastor John for the
[48:16] opportunity he has given me to come
[48:20] and to thank the Lord for all that God
[48:23] is using you to do in this place
[48:28] and of course the entire world Amen
[48:32] and celebrating this morning I want to
[48:34] speak on a topic I just we take from
[48:39] that
[48:40] First Corinthians chapter number four
[48:43] verse 1.
[48:45] I call it the steward of the mysteries
[48:49] of God Amen amen
[48:52] these two words of the mysteries of God
[48:59] and I want to believe that there is no
[49:02] message that can be preached that have
[49:04] not been preached before
[49:07] is that right
[49:09] amen what we do is to remind one another
[49:14] of these things
[49:16] because Paul said
[49:18] I believe is Paul he said that you do
[49:21] good
[49:22] if we remind one another of these things
[49:26] Hallelujah
[49:28] and so I have not come to preach
[49:30] anything new
[49:33] I have come to remind you what you know
[49:36] and I want to just do it in a manner by
[49:40] the special grace of God that your faith
[49:43] will come alive again
[49:45] that that heart that is getting weak
[49:48] will be weak no more
[49:50] Hallelujah
[49:52] that's why we are children of God
[49:56] right
[49:58] the servant of the most high told us
[50:01] that he by the special grace of God has
[50:04] taught for us the food
[50:07] for the season
[50:09] Hallelujah and so you see I regretting
[50:12] about this food is it doesn't sour
[50:16] Hallelujah
[50:17] it does not sour any time you take that
[50:20] food you eat it you love to eat it again
[50:23] and again
[50:24] hallelujah praise God anytime you come
[50:29] in contact with this menu
[50:32] it gives you all the nutrients you want
[50:34] amen now you might say physical
[50:36] nutrients is included oh yes because the
[50:41] things of the spirit determines what
[50:44] happens in the physical
[50:46] when you are fed spiritually you will be
[50:50] fed physically
[50:52] because Jesus said when Satan took him
[50:55] up to the Mount to test him
[50:58] to try him he said to him that man does
[51:01] not live by bread alone but by every
[51:05] word every word everyone everyone that
[51:10] proceeded from the mouth of the Lord is
[51:12] the food
[51:14] Glory
[51:17] every what
[51:21] you eat the word
[51:23] it will give you all you need
[51:26] now the Bible said that God has given us
[51:29] all things that pertained to life and
[51:31] godliness is that right
[51:33] all things that pertaining to life and
[51:36] godliness
[51:38] therefore you see
[51:41] the word of God
[51:45] gives us
[51:47] life
[51:49] in the spirit and gives us life in the
[51:53] physical
[51:58] and that's why we don't joke with the
[52:00] word
[52:03] the Bible Paul was speaking he said that
[52:09] it is only day that are dying
[52:13] that are going into darkness that cause
[52:16] the word of God foolish
[52:20] but to us
[52:22] who are saved it is the power of God
[52:25] unto salvation
[52:28] so the Jews and to the Gentiles to every
[52:32] man to the black to the white to the
[52:35] green I don't care the color that word
[52:38] of God is life to us it is the power of
[52:43] God
[52:47] it is
[52:49] we've got no other power
[52:51] accept the word of God
[52:59] not himself say man
[53:03] more than the word that's right yes
[53:07] I have tested these things a little
[53:10] years now
[53:12] and I have found out that it is true
[53:16] amen at every application of the word of
[53:19] God
[53:20] the power of God goes with the word
[53:25] amen
[53:27] so this morning
[53:29] we want to consider what I just title
[53:32] like I said the stewards or the
[53:34] mysteries of God Paul wants us to know
[53:41] right that's
[53:44] we all are stewards of the mysteries of
[53:49] God now you you you want you want to you
[53:52] you want to go down that scripture very
[53:54] well you will find out that Paul was
[53:57] speaking concerning the ministers
[54:03] Hallelujah because when he started
[54:06] speaking when you go to the next verse
[54:08] he spoke of himself
[54:11] all right but you see
[54:14] the word ministers is not limited today
[54:18] that stand at the pulpits oh God praise
[54:21] God
[54:22] he talks of everyone that believes
[54:26] for everyone that believes is giving the
[54:29] power to become amen oh man the Bible
[54:33] said the Book of John
[54:34] chapter 1 verse 12 as many that believe
[54:37] he gave them power to become the sons of
[54:41] God and as a Son of God you are a
[54:45] minister
[54:47] there is something you've got to give
[54:52] so the word here is talking to everybody
[54:58] as many that believe him
[55:01] to you to me
[55:04] to that little boy to that little girl
[55:07] the word is saying that we are still
[55:10] words of the mysteries of God
[55:14] oh glory be to the name of the Lord
[55:17] amen
[55:19] and so
[55:21] it is important for us to define or
[55:26] do it
[55:29] because if you get the concepts
[55:33] then the text will be easier for you
[55:38] praise the Lord amen praise the Lord
[55:41] he said
[55:43] additional meaning here we tell us that
[55:46] are these two words
[55:49] if you want to describe this two word as
[55:51] a noun he said that a steward is a
[55:54] person
[55:55] appointed to manage
[55:57] or to supervise a property
[56:01] or an event
[56:05] anybody appointed to supervise
[56:09] a property or an event
[56:12] the person is a steward
[56:16] right
[56:18] that means he takes charge
[56:21] of the property that is committed unto
[56:24] his hand amen
[56:27] amen he oversees it he makes sure that
[56:31] what the honor of the property has there
[56:34] does not rot
[56:37] he showcases
[56:39] to the whole world to cleanse the
[56:43] property that have been given unto him
[56:45] Hallelujah now I want you to trickle it
[56:48] down to the word of God Paul is saying
[56:52] here that we the Believers are
[56:57] the ones that have been appointed to
[57:01] manage to Showcase Hallelujah the
[57:05] mysteries of God oh my and you know that
[57:10] the mysteries of God
[57:12] are all encapsulated in one mystery
[57:19] the entire mysteries of God
[57:22] is in one mystery
[57:24] that one mystery is Jesus Christ
[57:28] Hallelujah and everything Jesus carries
[57:32] amen because brother and told us in a
[57:35] message called the mystery of Christ is
[57:39] the mystery of God revealed he said that
[57:42] God has a property in him
[57:47] Hallelujah God wanted to do something
[57:51] and that is a mystery to the world
[57:55] right and he came by getting this
[57:58] mystery to you and me by Jesus Christ
[58:02] when God
[58:04] came as a man
[58:07] and then we call him the Son of God or
[58:10] the son of man whichever one applies to
[58:13] you there Hallelujah but you know Christ
[58:16] is came as a son of man a Son of God and
[58:21] the son of David
[58:23] is that right Hallelujah right now he is
[58:28] in the office of the son of God
[58:34] amen Hallelujah he's going to come as
[58:37] the son of David
[58:39] in a millennium he's going to come as
[58:41] the son of David
[58:43] and we are going to rule with him
[58:47] Hallelujah
[58:48] so
[58:49] you see
[58:51] God the almighty God
[58:55] has given his children
[58:58] the power to manage
[59:01] the Mysteries
[59:04] of God
[59:07] the power
[59:09] to show the world
[59:13] the word of God
[59:15] to demonstrate the power of the Holy
[59:18] Ghost
[59:22] that is what this Bible is telling you
[59:24] and me that's what the scripture is
[59:27] trying to bring forward to us
[59:30] that we
[59:33] have gotten these things as a commitment
[59:38] from God
[59:43] amen
[59:46] and when we when I said that the entire
[59:49] mysteries of God is encapsulated in one
[59:54] mystery
[59:55] which I now told you is Jesus Christ
[59:58] amen I am talking of the word of God and
[1:00:02] the Revelation therein
[1:00:06] because in the Book of John chapter 1
[1:00:10] the scripture says that in the beginning
[1:00:12] was the word and the Word was with God
[1:00:15] Amen and the Word was God and the Word
[1:00:19] was made manifest
[1:00:21] the Bible said he became a man he became
[1:00:24] he came in the flesh and he is called
[1:00:27] Emmanuel God With Us Hallelujah so the
[1:00:32] mystery of God is the word of God Amen
[1:00:39] so what have been committed to the hands
[1:00:41] of the Believers
[1:00:43] the Believers the True Church of God
[1:00:46] Hallelujah is nothing but the word of
[1:00:51] God the revelational power of the word
[1:00:54] of God that is what I've been committed
[1:00:57] into our hands
[1:00:59] and so it will be a shame
[1:01:02] for us
[1:01:03] if we cannot showcase this mystery
[1:01:07] that's right
[1:01:09] it will be a shame to the church
[1:01:12] to the bride of Christ
[1:01:14] if we cannot
[1:01:17] manage
[1:01:19] this property
[1:01:21] that God has given to us
[1:01:25] amen
[1:01:27] amen hallelujah
[1:01:32] God began to speak to us in the Book of
[1:01:34] Matthew chapter 25. if we begin to read
[1:01:38] it from verse 1.
[1:01:41] amen
[1:01:44] the scripture talked about
[1:01:47] God likening the kingdom
[1:01:51] foreign
[1:01:54] a lord
[1:01:56] who has many things and servants but one
[1:02:01] day he choose to go somewhere
[1:02:03] and he called his servants destroyed
[1:02:07] and said you take this beat
[1:02:10] this one five talents the other one two
[1:02:13] talents the other one one talent and
[1:02:15] said you manage you occupy see like come
[1:02:19] oh my I love that language
[1:02:23] occupied till I come
[1:02:27] you get that so it's it's not saying
[1:02:31] keep it until I come it means manage it
[1:02:35] live by it
[1:02:37] develop it right make it bigger
[1:02:41] until I come
[1:02:43] because he is a businessman do you know
[1:02:46] that God is a businessman Jesus Christ
[1:02:49] is a businessman he said in his word I
[1:02:52] go about my father's business Hallelujah
[1:02:55] so if he goes by the business of his
[1:02:58] father it means he's a businessman of
[1:03:01] course what is business business is to
[1:03:04] make gain of what you have been given
[1:03:06] and the Salvation has been given to him
[1:03:11] right he has to make Gain of it and you
[1:03:14] see where did where it where it concerns
[1:03:17] us is that the scripture said that Jesus
[1:03:20] why he was going away he didn't go with
[1:03:23] the salvation
[1:03:25] he left it for us
[1:03:27] he said as my father sent me so I send
[1:03:32] you he said the words I do you shall do
[1:03:36] and greater what shall you do because I
[1:03:39] go to my father Oh Glory
[1:03:43] ah what a wonderful word
[1:03:47] amen I'm feeling happy hearing it again
[1:03:50] because you know I'm not preaching to
[1:03:52] you alone
[1:03:53] I'm preaching to myself
[1:03:59] Hallelujah
[1:04:00] he said
[1:04:02] you occupy till I come
[1:04:07] right
[1:04:08] and so it is his Mysteries that he has
[1:04:12] given to his church to occupy
[1:04:16] until he comes back
[1:04:18] right
[1:04:21] yes
[1:04:25] so you see
[1:04:27] when he liking that
[1:04:30] when the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:04:33] like in the Kingdom
[1:04:36] of God
[1:04:37] in that manner
[1:04:39] he said to the first person take these
[1:04:42] five talents
[1:04:43] the second person two talents the other
[1:04:45] one one Talent
[1:04:46] and the Bible tells us that when he came
[1:04:50] back when the master came back
[1:04:52] he demanded for each and every one of
[1:04:55] them to render his accounts
[1:04:58] all right
[1:04:59] yes because you know
[1:05:02] Hallelujah
[1:05:03] every business at the end of the year
[1:05:06] they organize what we call a
[1:05:09] shareholders meeting
[1:05:11] is that correct yes yes at the end of
[1:05:14] the year you must come together the
[1:05:17] chairman the managing director and every
[1:05:19] stakeholder we call it annual general
[1:05:22] meeting of the stakeholders is that
[1:05:25] right and then the stakeholders will sit
[1:05:28] down and ask the managers of the company
[1:05:32] he said what have you done this year
[1:05:35] give us the balance sheet of this
[1:05:38] company
[1:05:40] let's know how much gain you have made
[1:05:43] yeah
[1:05:46] yeah see
[1:05:47] spiritual physical things type spiritual
[1:05:53] is that correct
[1:05:55] I saw when they said they will ask and
[1:05:59] the words of this word of that it's okay
[1:06:02] we traded 27
[1:06:05] million tons of Social and so materials
[1:06:08] and we made so so again and then this
[1:06:10] and this is this we have spent this on
[1:06:13] this and this is the balance and the
[1:06:15] Bible the the we know that when that is
[1:06:18] done the shareholders received their
[1:06:21] dividend
[1:06:22] Jesus is looking for a dividend from
[1:06:24] every one of us
[1:06:26] oh yeah
[1:06:28] if we cannot give the dividends of these
[1:06:31] Mysteries then we have put him to shame
[1:06:36] but God forbid
[1:06:40] God forbid
[1:06:43] amen
[1:06:45] we cannot afford
[1:06:47] to miss it
[1:06:50] we cannot afford no it is not possible
[1:06:54] the Church of God cannot afford to fail
[1:06:57] Jesus Christ
[1:06:58] because he told us that when he came
[1:07:02] back the other one with one Talent told
[1:07:04] him Master here is your talent
[1:07:08] I know whom you are I have kept it for
[1:07:11] you
[1:07:12] and he said he called him what a wicked
[1:07:15] steward
[1:07:17] and I pray for every one of us here that
[1:07:20] God will not call you a wicked steward
[1:07:25] we shall not be found in that level
[1:07:28] we want to be praised like the one with
[1:07:31] the five talents
[1:07:33] like the one with the two talents
[1:07:35] the Bible said that he called them and
[1:07:38] praised them because they made double of
[1:07:41] what had been given to them
[1:07:45] now I want you to think
[1:07:48] what prophet have you made of these
[1:07:50] Mysteries that have been committed into
[1:07:52] your hand
[1:07:56] what prophet
[1:07:59] every one of us from the puppy to the
[1:08:01] people
[1:08:03] what prophet have you made
[1:08:06] over these things
[1:08:09] that the Lord has given to us
[1:08:12] as his children to trade with
[1:08:16] all glory be to the name of the Lord
[1:08:19] you see you have to understand whom you
[1:08:22] are
[1:08:25] the understanding of whom you are
[1:08:27] helps you to express yourself better
[1:08:31] yes
[1:08:32] yeah amen
[1:08:35] in second Corinthians chapter five if
[1:08:37] you begin to read from Verse 18 to 20.
[1:08:44] can we have it
[1:08:46] can we have it on the boat
[1:08:51] and all things
[1:08:54] are of God
[1:08:57] who are the reconcile us to himself by
[1:09:01] Jesus Christ and has given to us the
[1:09:05] ministry of reconciliation he has given
[1:09:10] to us
[1:09:11] so we had become the stewards of the
[1:09:14] ministry of reconciliation
[1:09:19] he has given us that to ensure that we
[1:09:24] reconcile the world to Jesus Christ amen
[1:09:33] because you want to know that in the
[1:09:35] beginning the Bible said God made Adam
[1:09:39] and Eve and he gave them Dominion
[1:09:42] do you know that
[1:09:44] he gave them Dominion
[1:09:46] to rule over this world he said to them
[1:09:49] also that thou shall occupy
[1:09:53] increase
[1:09:56] command
[1:10:00] but along the way
[1:10:03] man threw it away
[1:10:06] but God has a program
[1:10:09] because God cannot let his property to
[1:10:13] get rot away
[1:10:15] and so he began the process
[1:10:18] amen he started the process
[1:10:21] even before the foundation of the world
[1:10:23] Amen because the Bible said that Christ
[1:10:26] was slain
[1:10:27] before the foundation of the world
[1:10:30] and that's why we are not here by
[1:10:33] accident
[1:10:35] oh I am not here by accident my name has
[1:10:38] been written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:10:42] before the foundation of the world
[1:10:49] for this purpose
[1:10:52] was the son of man made manifest
[1:10:55] that he might destroy
[1:10:57] The Works of unbelief as it occurred in
[1:11:01] the Garden of Eden
[1:11:05] let's see let's see half the scripture
[1:11:09] second Corinthians chapter five
[1:11:11] so to us he committed unto us the word
[1:11:14] of reconciliation this is a big word
[1:11:19] is a very big word the word of
[1:11:21] reconciliation it looks simple
[1:11:24] but it is too wide because when you want
[1:11:28] to reconcile a people
[1:11:31] there are many things that goes around
[1:11:33] it that's the truth is that right
[1:11:36] reconciliation does not just go by only
[1:11:39] discussing please can you forgive him
[1:11:42] can you do this no it's part of it
[1:11:46] all right it's part of it but when you
[1:11:49] want to reconcile a people
[1:11:51] right there could be something like okay
[1:11:54] I give you this
[1:11:58] all right and you you try everything you
[1:12:01] can do to get the heart of the people
[1:12:03] together once again that's the concept
[1:12:07] of reconciliation
[1:12:09] amen right now in the next verse can we
[1:12:13] see the next verse verse 20.
[1:12:16] okay verse okay
[1:12:19] have we done verse 19
[1:12:22] have I read it
[1:12:24] to which that God was in Christ
[1:12:29] reconciling the world
[1:12:31] unto himself not in putting their
[1:12:35] trespasses
[1:12:37] unto them
[1:12:38] and has committed unto us the word of
[1:12:42] reconciliation next one
[1:12:45] now and then
[1:12:46] I like that
[1:12:49] can we Echo it now and then
[1:12:51] let's read it let's let's enjoy the the
[1:12:54] scripture he said now then we are
[1:12:59] ambassadors of Christ
[1:13:00] [Laughter]
[1:13:03] we are ambassadors of Christ as though
[1:13:06] God did beseech You by us
[1:13:10] we pray you in Christ State be ye
[1:13:13] reconciled to God but my the point I
[1:13:19] want to make there is that we are
[1:13:21] ambassadors
[1:13:23] that means amen
[1:13:26] what heaven Curry
[1:13:29] the bride carries it
[1:13:32] now the ambassador of America to Nigeria
[1:13:37] right it's like the president of America
[1:13:40] in my country
[1:13:42] is that right
[1:13:44] what he says is what America is saying
[1:13:49] isn't that
[1:13:51] if he doesn't issue me a Visa here I
[1:13:54] will not be here
[1:13:56] I don't have to call on uh Biden to
[1:14:00] issue me a Visa I'll go to his
[1:14:03] Ambassador isn't that I said I need a
[1:14:05] visa to visit United States can you give
[1:14:08] me a Visa
[1:14:09] then he gives me a Visa
[1:14:12] and when I come to the Port of Entry
[1:14:14] nobody will deny me entry because
[1:14:18] the ambassador of your country has given
[1:14:20] me the Visa having satisfied me worthy
[1:14:24] to have it
[1:14:25] amen is that right now that is the
[1:14:29] position of Christians yes
[1:14:31] that is the position of the bride of
[1:14:33] Christ in this age we are to show the
[1:14:36] world
[1:14:36] the word of God
[1:14:38] amen nothing less nothing more amen
[1:14:43] so we are ambassadors of Christ
[1:14:49] we are the stewards of the Mysteries
[1:14:53] of God
[1:14:56] praise the name of the Lord
[1:15:00] so brethren
[1:15:02] you want to consider
[1:15:04] in First Peter chapter 2 verse 9.
[1:15:07] we can still have it
[1:15:09] because I want us to understand where
[1:15:12] I'm going
[1:15:13] so that by the time
[1:15:15] we are winding down on this message
[1:15:19] you will know your position
[1:15:23] and that will help us a lot can we see
[1:15:25] it
[1:15:29] first Peter
[1:15:31] chapter 2 verse 9 he said boy ye are a
[1:15:35] chosen generation
[1:15:38] a royal priesthood
[1:15:40] and holy nation A peculiar people that
[1:15:45] you should know what show forth the
[1:15:48] Praises of him
[1:15:50] who has called you out of Darkness until
[1:15:54] His Marvelous Light
[1:16:03] now what interests me that most is this
[1:16:06] to show fault
[1:16:09] the Praises
[1:16:11] of God that's the greatest one that
[1:16:14] interests me that
[1:16:16] because it makes no sense that you are a
[1:16:19] royal priesthood
[1:16:22] you are a prince
[1:16:24] you are a holy nation you have all these
[1:16:27] things with you and you don't show it
[1:16:29] amen and then you put it in your bag
[1:16:33] who knows what you are carrying in the
[1:16:35] bag
[1:16:36] nobody knows what is in your bag until
[1:16:39] you open it up you've got to show it to
[1:16:41] the world and then they will believe
[1:16:43] what you are talking about they will
[1:16:45] know whom you are
[1:16:51] if you can't show it you don't have it
[1:16:54] oh yes
[1:16:56] you don't have it
[1:16:58] the evidence that you have it is that
[1:17:00] you are able to show it fault
[1:17:03] hallelujah how do you get the word known
[1:17:07] that we are in the end time
[1:17:13] you've got to show them
[1:17:17] how do you get the word know that Jesus
[1:17:20] Christ
[1:17:21] is the almighty God you have to
[1:17:24] demonstrate it
[1:17:30] how do you show the world
[1:17:33] that you
[1:17:35] ah a custodian of the mysteries of God
[1:17:40] you've got to show the world the
[1:17:43] mysteries of God
[1:17:45] if they can't see it then you don't have
[1:17:48] it you better shut up and walk away
[1:17:54] amen but the bride is not meant to shut
[1:17:57] up
[1:17:58] we are to speak we are to demonstrate we
[1:18:01] are to show the world
[1:18:04] because he has given us the power to do
[1:18:07] it
[1:18:08] how
[1:18:10] Jesus said in the book of uh Paul was
[1:18:13] speaking in the Book of Romans
[1:18:15] in chapter 8 verse 11 he said if this
[1:18:19] power
[1:18:21] that brought Jesus Christ out from the
[1:18:25] grave lives in you
[1:18:27] if he does what lives in you
[1:18:31] if he lives in you he shall Quicken you
[1:18:35] up
[1:18:37] he shall Quicken both your mother and
[1:18:41] physical body
[1:18:43] and their spiritual body
[1:18:49] the quickening power is not only there
[1:18:51] for our Rapture Oh Glory
[1:18:54] you know that it's not there only for
[1:18:57] the Rapture Day
[1:18:59] it is there for now
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:05] God has given us all everything
[1:19:10] Hallelujah
[1:19:12] I feel happy
[1:19:14] always knowing that
[1:19:17] I am one of them
[1:19:22] oh yes that's that's one great happiness
[1:19:25] I have I don't care what is happening
[1:19:28] but anytime I remember that I am one of
[1:19:32] them
[1:19:34] I can look at the face of cancer
[1:19:38] and tell him shut up
[1:19:41] you have no power over me
[1:19:45] I can look at any situation of life I
[1:19:48] said shut up you have no power over me
[1:19:52] because he that is in me
[1:19:56] is greater than he that is in the world
[1:20:00] is that right
[1:20:01] that's the position of the church
[1:20:05] fortunately enough
[1:20:08] it does not die down
[1:20:10] amen and that's why sometimes I look at
[1:20:13] us
[1:20:14] we speak of William arumbraham every day
[1:20:19] we speak of the past of God in William
[1:20:22] Braham
[1:20:25] but we don't manifest the power in our
[1:20:27] own time
[1:20:32] amen
[1:20:34] Hallelujah
[1:20:36] it is not the messenger that matters
[1:20:39] most it is the message of the messenger
[1:20:44] come on Church
[1:20:47] as much as we glorify our all we thank
[1:20:50] the Lord for the messenger
[1:20:53] the Messenger will mean nothing if the
[1:20:55] message of the messenger does not go
[1:20:57] into our lives
[1:20:59] [Music]
[1:21:03] that's where
[1:21:05] the the bride in this hour is failing it
[1:21:09] we are becoming philosophers
[1:21:11] great writers and great lawyers
[1:21:15] argumentators we keep arguing brother
[1:21:19] Abraham said brother Abraham said his
[1:21:22] brother Abraham going to come back again
[1:21:24] is he going to ride on the trail again
[1:21:26] and all this that does not matter most
[1:21:31] Hallelujah amen and you know what amen
[1:21:35] the consolation of the angels that form
[1:21:38] the cloud amen the face of he that was
[1:21:42] in it was not William Brown whose face
[1:21:46] was in it
[1:21:48] the face of Jesus Christ I saw Jesus
[1:21:51] Christ we transcend all because the
[1:21:54] Bible said the bride and the bridegroom
[1:21:56] has become one amen so the headship of
[1:22:00] Christ
[1:22:01] has come unto the body amen
[1:22:09] amen the power of God is in the church
[1:22:11] today
[1:22:15] that is the mystery
[1:22:18] that is part of the Mysteries that we
[1:22:21] are holding
[1:22:22] we must be merchandise of this
[1:22:25] Mysteries
[1:22:28] we must make merchandise our faith not
[1:22:31] for gain in our apostles
[1:22:33] but to gain The Souls of men for the
[1:22:37] kingdom
[1:22:41] that's what he stands for
[1:22:43] you oh praise the name of the Lord
[1:22:45] you love the Lord today
[1:22:47] you love him
[1:22:49] you see the problem with the church is
[1:22:51] that
[1:22:52] the church has gone into what Abraham
[1:22:56] has preached to us about spiritual
[1:22:58] ammunition
[1:22:59] Hallelujah
[1:23:03] we have lost it
[1:23:06] but I believe amen
[1:23:09] the remnants
[1:23:11] must always be there it doesn't matter
[1:23:15] what is happening
[1:23:16] amen
[1:23:18] that disease that Affliction cause
[1:23:21] spiritual Amnesia cannot catch up with
[1:23:24] everyone
[1:23:26] and you are one of them that it will not
[1:23:28] come around can you say Amen to it
[1:23:32] it shall not affect you
[1:23:36] because
[1:23:38] what is this spiritual Amnesia the Bible
[1:23:40] the program told us that it is a state
[1:23:44] in which a man
[1:23:46] or anybody or whoever
[1:23:49] cannot identify himself again
[1:23:52] you don't know whom you are
[1:23:55] you've lost your senses
[1:23:59] yeah it's true you don't even know that
[1:24:01] this is their mother
[1:24:03] you don't even know that this is your
[1:24:04] father you can't even identify a wife
[1:24:06] because you don't know whom you are
[1:24:13] and told us that the cause of this is
[1:24:17] shock
[1:24:19] one of the things that brought spiritual
[1:24:22] ammunition
[1:24:23] or ammunition as it is generally is when
[1:24:26] you have a shock
[1:24:29] when you are shocked assuming you have
[1:24:32] an electric shock for instance right
[1:24:34] right you don't get balance isn't that
[1:24:37] you lose your senses
[1:24:39] what we have what the church is
[1:24:41] suffering today
[1:24:43] is a shock
[1:24:51] but I am telling somebody today
[1:24:54] we've got the power to reverse it
[1:24:58] if God can return never never charges
[1:25:03] whom he made a beast at a certain point
[1:25:05] because he he thought he has gotten the
[1:25:08] entire world
[1:25:10] right if God can bring him back
[1:25:13] from the mind of an animal back to that
[1:25:16] of a human being how much more will God
[1:25:18] make his bride greater
[1:25:22] praise the Lord
[1:25:25] so today is our day
[1:25:27] [Applause]
[1:25:28] today is our day I believe it I know
[1:25:32] that God is doing something in our life
[1:25:35] amen
[1:25:38] I just want to preach on a little bit
[1:25:40] and I will stop
[1:25:42] you give me a little more time
[1:25:46] if you are conversant with that message
[1:25:49] Abraham preached
[1:25:51] he says something
[1:25:54] amen
[1:25:55] he he told us the causes of this loss of
[1:26:00] identity
[1:26:02] like I said one is shock
[1:26:06] the second one is
[1:26:09] you know
[1:26:10] our reasoning being
[1:26:13] of two opinions
[1:26:17] when you have two opinions
[1:26:20] you don't know
[1:26:22] whether you have to follow your left or
[1:26:24] your right
[1:26:27] you've lost your senses
[1:26:29] it's like a man driving on the way and
[1:26:31] he's approaching an exit
[1:26:33] and it's looking at the exit he doesn't
[1:26:35] know do I take an exit or do I go on the
[1:26:37] highway
[1:26:41] what do you think will happen to that
[1:26:42] person
[1:26:44] if I just entered anywhere I'll get
[1:26:46] himself in the bush
[1:26:48] because he doesn't know the road to
[1:26:49] follow
[1:26:54] that's it and that is what has happened
[1:26:56] to the church yes
[1:26:59] but
[1:27:01] I want I I know I'm speaking to the
[1:27:04] saints of God
[1:27:05] who today cannot suffer that fit
[1:27:09] praise the lord we cannot suffer it
[1:27:13] we are not meant to suffer it
[1:27:16] it is the devil that should suffer it
[1:27:19] amen
[1:27:20] amen the devil lost his sense in heaven
[1:27:24] and he began to think that maybe he's
[1:27:27] not God
[1:27:28] and the Bible said there was war in
[1:27:30] heaven
[1:27:33] a battle ranged on
[1:27:35] and God told him you cannot share this
[1:27:39] my glory that's right because I can
[1:27:41] share my glory with anybody so you gotta
[1:27:43] kick him out amen amen if God kicked him
[1:27:47] out from Heaven you've got to kick him
[1:27:49] out of your life
[1:27:52] Hallelujah he's the only confused person
[1:27:55] we've got to kick him out of the church
[1:27:58] we have to tell him you have no power
[1:28:01] over any child of God
[1:28:03] we are in control for the mysteries of
[1:28:07] God that has been committed unto our
[1:28:08] hands no man can take this
[1:28:11] no I can't give it up it's the property
[1:28:15] of my father and I know nobody wants to
[1:28:17] give up the property of his father
[1:28:18] easily before any man can take the
[1:28:21] property of their father from your hand
[1:28:23] he must give you a great fight
[1:28:25] in fact sometimes you will swear and we
[1:28:27] want to die without property
[1:28:30] if we can do it in the physical terms
[1:28:33] can't we do it with the spiritual things
[1:28:37] right yeah we can
[1:28:40] I believe we can
[1:28:43] for the power reside with us
[1:28:47] and so
[1:28:48] problem said in that message is I can't
[1:28:51] read it right now but I just want to
[1:28:53] paraphrase it
[1:28:54] because of time he said that he's an
[1:28:57] American
[1:28:58] and so whatever America was
[1:29:02] I am
[1:29:04] whatever America is now I am whatever
[1:29:08] America will be tomorrow I am because I
[1:29:11] am identified with America as a citizen
[1:29:16] that's what Abraham said and we are not
[1:29:19] citizens of this world we are citizens
[1:29:22] of heaven and so what happens is is what
[1:29:25] we are what heaven was is what we are
[1:29:28] what heaven will be tomorrow is what we
[1:29:31] will be tomorrow because we are
[1:29:34] identified with Heaven amen we are of
[1:29:38] him amen
[1:29:40] amen amen the Bible said in the Book of
[1:29:42] Revelation chapter 22 verse 17 he said
[1:29:46] the bride
[1:29:49] the bride and cry and the groom they are
[1:29:52] one and they say come yes
[1:29:55] Oh Glory
[1:29:58] amen yes that's who we are
[1:30:02] we can't suffer that
[1:30:04] amen
[1:30:05] preaching in a message he called a man
[1:30:09] running away from the presence of God
[1:30:11] Abraham said that we have got
[1:30:14] responsibilities
[1:30:19] all of us as bride of Christ we got
[1:30:22] responsibilities
[1:30:25] we are responsible
[1:30:28] for preaching the truth of God's word
[1:30:34] we cannot shy away from it we are
[1:30:37] responsible for making sick people to
[1:30:40] beware amen
[1:30:43] praise God Amen
[1:30:46] because he said we cannot join the train
[1:30:51] the ship to tashish
[1:30:53] and what is touches denominations
[1:30:58] John had joined the ship going to
[1:31:00] touches
[1:31:02] instead of going to Nineveh where he was
[1:31:04] sent
[1:31:05] he left his responsibility
[1:31:08] and followed another way thinking that
[1:31:10] there is a way but the truth is that
[1:31:12] God's program can never be thwarted
[1:31:15] amen no way you cannot you can run but
[1:31:17] you cannot hide
[1:31:19] Hallelujah he run but God brought him
[1:31:22] back to Nineveh and he have got to
[1:31:25] preach that message and he preached that
[1:31:28] message therefore my brethren you cannot
[1:31:31] run
[1:31:32] you cannot hide
[1:31:34] you have got to come out and uphold the
[1:31:37] mysteries of God for we are the stewards
[1:31:41] of God hallelujah
[1:31:43] we must pray for the sick
[1:31:47] right
[1:31:49] the prosperity
[1:31:51] Of The World Is Ours
[1:31:56] both financially
[1:31:58] are you afraid to say it
[1:32:01] are you careful to say it
[1:32:03] the finances of the world belongs to
[1:32:05] Christians
[1:32:07] I'm sure I'm not bringing a new doctrine
[1:32:10] to you
[1:32:10] everything that God got
[1:32:14] the bride got it is ours amen
[1:32:19] we cannot hide from these things
[1:32:23] Hallelujah now the Lord said that amen
[1:32:28] amen
[1:32:30] that the church is Anointed
[1:32:37] I'm coming to that now
[1:32:39] and I want you to get get that
[1:32:42] into your mind
[1:32:48] the mystical Body of Christ
[1:32:51] is greatly anointed
[1:32:53] right
[1:32:55] and we are anointed with the word
[1:32:59] we are anointed with the revelation
[1:33:01] we are anointed with the holy spirit of
[1:33:04] God
[1:33:07] and so
[1:33:08] we must exercise the powers of the Holy
[1:33:11] Ghost
[1:33:15] what's his name Samson was not a huge
[1:33:18] man Abraham told us that is that right
[1:33:21] it was such a small man
[1:33:25] as small as
[1:33:28] not being able to lift this maybe
[1:33:31] but when the spirit of God Came Upon him
[1:33:34] the gates of gods have made no sense
[1:33:38] he took the gates of Gaza put it on his
[1:33:40] shoulder and went upstairs
[1:33:43] I love that
[1:33:45] amen
[1:33:46] and so that is what God has given the
[1:33:50] church
[1:33:51] for all that was in God he poured into
[1:33:54] Jesus Christ and all that was in Christ
[1:33:57] has been poured into the church into the
[1:34:01] bride
[1:34:02] and so we must exercise the power of God
[1:34:09] we must live
[1:34:11] a life
[1:34:12] that is worthy of the scripture amen
[1:34:18] yes
[1:34:19] we must live their life
[1:34:22] if our life cannot be Tracy upon Paul
[1:34:25] said we are the Epistles of God
[1:34:31] we are the written Epistles of God
[1:34:35] people today don't have the patience to
[1:34:37] read the Bible do you know that no
[1:34:42] there's no time
[1:34:44] you got your hours at work
[1:34:47] you want to go to work
[1:34:49] 10 hours here
[1:34:51] eight hours the other way now tell me
[1:34:54] the time you got to open your Bible
[1:34:58] how much more an unbeliever
[1:35:02] he got no time to look at the scripture
[1:35:04] but it's looking at the people
[1:35:09] he's looking at the person that said
[1:35:11] he's a Christian
[1:35:13] and if he cannot see Jesus in that
[1:35:16] person
[1:35:17] he will never know Christ
[1:35:21] that's why it is important for you to
[1:35:24] understand
[1:35:25] that you are
[1:35:26] holding the mysteries of God in trust
[1:35:30] for him
[1:35:34] if you can't act it
[1:35:36] you don't have it
[1:35:41] you don't have it sir
[1:35:43] Ma you don't have it
[1:35:46] to be a great pity
[1:35:49] said the church is Anointed
[1:35:54] let's read this scripture Isaiah 11 1-5
[1:36:07] show it off the book of Isaiah
[1:36:16] Isaiah's
[1:36:18] chapter number 11 verse 1 to 5 I want it
[1:36:22] on the ball on the screen
[1:36:24] because I want us to read it together
[1:36:26] good and they shall come forth a rod out
[1:36:30] of the this time of Jesus
[1:36:32] and the branch shall grow out of his
[1:36:35] roots
[1:36:37] is that right let's read out now
[1:36:40] and the spirit of the Lord shall rest
[1:36:44] upon him the spirit of wisdom and
[1:36:47] understanding the spirit of counsel and
[1:36:50] might
[1:36:52] the spirit of knowledge and the fear of
[1:36:55] God
[1:36:57] read on
[1:36:59] and shall make him of a quick
[1:37:01] understanding in the fear of the Lord
[1:37:04] and he shall not judge after the sight
[1:37:08] of his eyes neither reprove after the
[1:37:11] hearing of his ears
[1:37:15] because of the spirit of God that will
[1:37:19] be upon him and he is prophesying about
[1:37:23] Christ
[1:37:24] prophesying about you and him have you
[1:37:28] ever seen
[1:37:29] a place where only the head is moving
[1:37:33] can you imagine that no I mean only the
[1:37:37] head a cut off my head and my head is
[1:37:40] walking
[1:37:44] can you imagine that
[1:37:46] no I you see if we are not practical if
[1:37:50] we are not practical with the things we
[1:37:51] do we will not understand the scriptures
[1:37:53] why
[1:37:54] let's cut off this head and tell the
[1:37:57] head to move on and let's see whether he
[1:38:00] can move
[1:38:02] the head requires the body
[1:38:04] Jesus Christ is the head of the church
[1:38:07] requiring the body so the anointing on
[1:38:10] the head flows into the body that is the
[1:38:14] church this is the prophecy of the
[1:38:16] church right
[1:38:18] amen amen yes sir
[1:38:21] the church is being prophesied about
[1:38:23] here yeah
[1:38:25] amen
[1:38:28] we will come down with the spirit of
[1:38:30] wisdom
[1:38:31] we will come down with the spirit of
[1:38:34] understanding and of cancer
[1:38:36] a spirit that will make us to fear the
[1:38:39] lord
[1:38:42] that is what the Lord has given us
[1:38:44] to be able
[1:38:46] to carry on with the Mysteries that have
[1:38:49] been committed unto us
[1:38:51] Hallelujah in Isaiah chapter 10 verse 27
[1:38:54] let's read it
[1:39:03] Isaiah 10
[1:39:05] 27.
[1:39:07] I like that again
[1:39:09] what a great scripture he said and it
[1:39:13] shall come to pass in that day
[1:39:16] that his burden
[1:39:18] shall be taken away from all thy
[1:39:22] shoulders
[1:39:23] and his yoke from off thy neck
[1:39:28] and the York shall be destroyed because
[1:39:32] of the anointing
[1:39:40] you know this story very wise we was
[1:39:42] talking about the time that they are
[1:39:44] syrians we are we are we are tormenting
[1:39:46] the the the the the the the the the the
[1:39:48] Israelites
[1:39:52] that was what was going on here
[1:39:55] they place a lot of yoke on the
[1:39:57] Israelites but God through this Prophet
[1:40:01] said wait on my brethren my sons and
[1:40:03] daughters
[1:40:04] I am going to anoint you
[1:40:07] and when I anoint you
[1:40:10] amen the burdens of the serious and the
[1:40:13] syrians shall not be upon your head any
[1:40:15] longer
[1:40:16] [Music]
[1:40:19] what we break that yoke
[1:40:22] is the anointing
[1:40:26] and in the book of Acts chapter 2 God
[1:40:28] poured out the anointing
[1:40:30] that's right the holy ghosts
[1:40:34] he said and thou shaltari in Jerusalem
[1:40:37] and wait for me there go nowhere until
[1:40:40] you be endured with power from our high
[1:40:43] and the Bible said that on that day as
[1:40:45] they were praying at the upper room
[1:40:48] the power came in
[1:40:51] rights like a Russian might win
[1:40:54] and settled upon each and every one of
[1:40:57] them like a clothing tongue of Fire
[1:41:00] and that is how it is cycling upon every
[1:41:02] bride yes every one of us sitting down
[1:41:05] here
[1:41:06] I want you to feel it we are not talking
[1:41:09] Theory we are talking of practical
[1:41:11] things
[1:41:13] have you received the Holy Ghost
[1:41:16] since you believed
[1:41:20] can you put down a history
[1:41:23] of how the Holy Spirit Come Came Upon
[1:41:26] you can you remember it
[1:41:30] if you can
[1:41:31] then you are a steward of the mysteries
[1:41:35] of God and you cannot fail
[1:41:38] amen
[1:41:40] amen you cannot fear
[1:41:42] if Jesus did not fail you can not fail
[1:41:47] amen I say it one more time if Jesus
[1:41:50] couldn't fail you cannot fail if the
[1:41:54] spirit of God never disappointed you
[1:41:57] cannot disappoint
[1:42:01] he settled upon each and every one of
[1:42:03] them
[1:42:06] anywhere I go I always tell the people
[1:42:09] I have a history of when I receive the
[1:42:11] Holy Ghost
[1:42:13] it's a story I don't forget
[1:42:16] I receive the Holy Spirit on the 26th of
[1:42:19] February
[1:42:20] 1999.
[1:42:22] yes
[1:42:24] I can tell you all that happened that
[1:42:26] day
[1:42:28] you cannot win a prize and not remember
[1:42:30] the day the award was
[1:42:36] that's the price that we won at Calvary
[1:42:40] the Bible said at Calvary
[1:42:44] he won us all is that right that that
[1:42:49] man of calvary
[1:42:51] has won my hands for himself
[1:42:55] you remember it you remember the day
[1:42:59] then I can tell you that the mystery of
[1:43:02] God is with you
[1:43:04] and so there is no chance
[1:43:07] I said to this church there is no chance
[1:43:10] that man that is sick today you will be
[1:43:12] healed
[1:43:15] somebody did not hear me very well you
[1:43:17] didn't get it I said that sick man or
[1:43:20] sick woman today you'll be healed
[1:43:22] [Music]
[1:43:23] amen
[1:43:24] the impossibilities of your life will be
[1:43:27] set off today
[1:43:28] for the Lord is with us here
[1:43:31] do you know
[1:43:33] there is no age
[1:43:37] of the Gentiles that the Lord identified
[1:43:39] himself with a pair of Fire
[1:43:41] and the prayer the cloud
[1:43:45] but he did with this age yes amen
[1:43:48] and a pair of fire was that spirit that
[1:43:51] led them
[1:43:53] amen and if he led them and they got
[1:43:56] victory
[1:43:57] he will lead us and we will get victims
[1:44:00] amen
[1:44:03] he's leading us today
[1:44:05] and we are getting Victory that's why
[1:44:08] I'm confident to tell you by the time we
[1:44:11] finish today
[1:44:13] the situation of your life
[1:44:17] we get out of you
[1:44:20] I want somebody that can believe Jesus
[1:44:24] hear me
[1:44:26] hear me this power is given to both the
[1:44:28] Jews and the Gentiles
[1:44:30] for Christ is not a respect of any man
[1:44:35] Peter said so when he came to the house
[1:44:37] of Cornelius
[1:44:39] he said I can perceive that God is not a
[1:44:41] respect of any man
[1:44:45] that's why I tell you
[1:44:48] we cannot continue to talk about Abraham
[1:44:51] and not do what Abraham did
[1:44:56] Ibraham loved
[1:44:58] we are bound to love that's right
[1:45:01] amen
[1:45:02] if he died at the altar
[1:45:05] to love somebody Hallelujah we must die
[1:45:08] at the altar to love one another
[1:45:13] if he stood with the Holy Spirit to
[1:45:15] Proclaim healing upon anybody we can
[1:45:19] still stand with the holy spirit amen
[1:45:21] and Proclaim healing to everyone that is
[1:45:23] seek here
[1:45:24] therefore diabetes is not for you

[1:45:59] with all my heart you are not living
[1:46:01] this home the way you came in
[1:46:04] you're going to leave this Hall better
[1:46:06] than you can
[1:46:09] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday to
[1:46:11] them forever amen I believe it
[1:46:15] Hallelujah Church
[1:46:17] we are the anointed bride of Christ
[1:46:22] and as anointed as we are
[1:46:26] we must show forth this anointing
[1:46:29] yes
[1:46:32] oh yes
[1:46:34] amen
[1:46:38] where Abraham told us in the message he
[1:46:41] called that I just quoted that is the
[1:46:43] Christ the mystery of God revealed
[1:46:46] he said that the anointed one
[1:46:50] is upon the anointed people
[1:46:55] the anointed one
[1:46:57] is now
[1:46:59] not just upon but in
[1:47:01] the anointed people
[1:47:05] so
[1:47:06] the one God
[1:47:08] is now in many gods
[1:47:12] you understand what I'm saying that one
[1:47:15] God is known in Gods
[1:47:20] know you not the Bible said that them
[1:47:22] that the word of God came to they are
[1:47:25] called Gods amen
[1:47:27] and the word of God Has Come to Us
[1:47:29] therefore we are gods
[1:47:31] yeah we are little girls
[1:47:35] praise the name of the Lord
[1:47:37] God is with us here we cannot fail
[1:47:40] I will not wish our time any longer
[1:47:43] because I know the peculiarities of this
[1:47:46] country
[1:47:47] Hallelujah
[1:47:49] amen
[1:47:50] I want to tell you today Moses
[1:47:55] was the steward of God
[1:48:00] and in the Book of Numbers Chapter 20.
[1:48:03] the Bible said and God spoke to Moses
[1:48:06] and Aaron
[1:48:07] he said to Moses you go down to the Rock
[1:48:12] and speak to the Rock
[1:48:14] and The Rock will give water
[1:48:18] and you and I know that the water was
[1:48:22] not a cup of water
[1:48:25] for there we are up to 2 million or more
[1:48:28] right and so it is wasn't a little
[1:48:30] stream
[1:48:33] it was the Fountain of water
[1:48:36] the living Fountain and Jesus came and
[1:48:39] identified himself as a fountain of the
[1:48:42] Living Water
[1:48:43] Hallelujah whosoever drilled the water
[1:48:47] shall not die but he shall live
[1:48:51] Moses held that mystery
[1:48:54] and he spoke to the Rock
[1:48:57] even though yeah he spoke to the Rock
[1:49:00] and the water came out
[1:49:03] Hallelujah
[1:49:05] the same Moses
[1:49:07] as a custodian of the mysteries of God
[1:49:10] made a brass serpent
[1:49:14] Abraham taught us
[1:49:16] that is the judged
[1:49:18] judged sin yeah amen
[1:49:22] hang it on a tree
[1:49:25] and said whosoever look at
[1:49:27] shall not die but leave
[1:49:30] and Jesus gave me the Book of John
[1:49:31] chapter 3 and he said as Moses lifted up
[1:49:36] that brass serpent so shall the son of
[1:49:38] man be lifted up and whosoever look at
[1:49:42] shall not die but leave
[1:49:44] so I want to tell somebody here today
[1:49:46] look and live amen amen
[1:49:50] we are going to demonstrate the
[1:49:52] mysteries of God
[1:49:53] it is with us
[1:49:56] amen it is here
[1:50:00] we have got to show it
[1:50:05] we are not going to baby it we are going
[1:50:07] to show it to the world
[1:50:11] the realization of whom you are
[1:50:14] is important
[1:50:17] Moses did it
[1:50:19] you can speak again
[1:50:21] remember Moses went with his rod in his
[1:50:24] hand is that right
[1:50:26] amen
[1:50:28] he went with the rod
[1:50:31] and the road signifies the judgment
[1:50:36] therefore we are with the rod
[1:50:39] the rod is the word
[1:50:43] for in the book of Psalm he said for
[1:50:45] thou he said the Lord is my shepherd I
[1:50:47] shall not want isn't that correct
[1:50:52] amen he said though I walk through the
[1:50:54] valley of the Shadows of death I shall
[1:50:56] fear no evil amen
[1:50:59] for their rods and their words they do
[1:51:02] what they comfort me
[1:51:04] the rod of God is here
[1:51:07] somebody will be comforted here today
[1:51:11] do you believe that
[1:51:13] yes
[1:51:15] somebody must be comforted because that
[1:51:18] road is within
[1:51:21] it doesn't matter the value of the
[1:51:23] shadow of death you are passing through
[1:51:27] in Psalms
[1:51:29] chapter 23.
[1:51:31] Jesus Christ is here amen
[1:51:34] I am glad because he said something in
[1:51:36] Malachi chapter 3 verse 17.
[1:51:39] he said on that day I will do something
[1:51:43] that the world we know there that
[1:51:45] surveyed me and there that served me not
[1:51:49] there must be a demarcation line
[1:51:53] something must show that you serve him
[1:51:58] something must show because you have the
[1:52:02] mysteries of God
[1:52:05] do you believe that
[1:52:07] do you believe that
[1:52:10] I want you to feel it I'm not just
[1:52:12] speaking to entertain anybody
[1:52:17] I'm not here to entertain you
[1:52:20] amen I am here
[1:52:22] to bring down the Mysteries
[1:52:26] and remind you that you are a custodian
[1:52:28] of it

[1:54:00] we are a child of the the top pool
[1:54:04] of William arambraham
[1:54:06] the word ministry all is encapsulated in
[1:54:10] US
[1:54:11] think about it
[1:54:15] think about it
[1:54:20] what stood against us
[1:54:23] is less than what is standing with us
[1:54:26] do you know
[1:54:27] the book of First John chapter the Bible
[1:54:30] says and then in chapter 4 verse 17 he
[1:54:33] said that as God is so shall we be
[1:54:39] and he also said in first John I think
[1:54:41] two or three numbers one he said we
[1:54:45] don't know yet whom we shall be like but
[1:54:47] we know that when he shall come we will
[1:54:50] be like him right amen
[1:54:54] amen amen
[1:54:55] so everything about God is with us
[1:54:59] could you just rise on your feet
[1:55:09] he paid it up
[1:55:14] I could not pay
[1:55:16] I old adapt
[1:55:18] I could not pay
[1:55:21] I need that someone
[1:55:24] to wash my sins away
[1:55:30] and now I say a brand new song
[1:55:35] I'm Amazing Grace
[1:55:39] all the Lord
[1:55:41] by Jesus Faith adapts that I could never
[1:55:49] pay
[1:55:51] that man of God
[1:56:00] as one my heart from me
[1:56:09] and I to set me free
[1:56:17] flashlight
[1:56:25] [Music]
[1:56:28] I want you to
[1:56:30] look at that situation around you
[1:56:35] I want to tell you
[1:56:37] cancer can be taken away from your body
[1:56:41] or the body of your loved ones at this
[1:56:43] hour
[1:56:44] for the Bible said that he sent his word
[1:56:48] and this word healed them
[1:56:50] and delivered them
[1:56:52] he has sent his word again this morning
[1:56:56] his word is able to deliver you
[1:57:00] I got a friend I was telling my brother
[1:57:04] two days ago
[1:57:07] I got a friend that lives in London
[1:57:10] a sister
[1:57:12] that was afflicted
[1:57:14] with the cancer of the breasts and she
[1:57:17] started going for chemotherapy
[1:57:21] but one day
[1:57:23] on his schedule day for another
[1:57:24] chemotherapy
[1:57:26] the doctors took him in and there was no
[1:57:28] reaction again
[1:57:30] after we have prayed
[1:57:33] just a night before them
[1:57:36] amen and they said what is happening we
[1:57:39] have not seen this type before where is
[1:57:41] the cancer
[1:57:42] a cancer that I've taken over all the
[1:57:44] breasts disappeared
[1:57:48] oh Jesus Christ
[1:57:53] and then insisted that he should go for
[1:57:55] radiograph radiography or what I'm not a
[1:57:58] medical person
[1:58:01] to confirm and she went and they
[1:58:05] couldn't find any trace of cancer
[1:58:07] that same God is here today
[1:58:11] look unto Jesus Christ
[1:58:15] the author and the finish of our faith
[1:58:18] begin to look at him at this hour
[1:58:22] and I asked our sister the keyboards
[1:58:24] just give us any song
[1:58:28] as we pray
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:42] I want you to think about it
[1:58:49] God's gift is for them that love him
[1:58:55] do you love him
[1:58:59] God's special things Heritage are for
[1:59:02] there
[1:59:03] that love him
[1:59:07] if you have not submitted to serving God
[1:59:10] today is your day
[1:59:12] I want to tell you there is no tomorrow
[1:59:16] we don't know this might just be the
[1:59:18] last meeting we will have on Earth
[1:59:21] there might be no opportunity for
[1:59:23] anybody again
[1:59:27] so I want you to
[1:59:29] hand it over to him and tell him Lord
[1:59:32] take over my life
[1:59:35] for I know nothing
[1:59:38] take over my spirit let it be yours
[1:59:42] fill me up this morning
[1:59:45] teach me Lord to wait
