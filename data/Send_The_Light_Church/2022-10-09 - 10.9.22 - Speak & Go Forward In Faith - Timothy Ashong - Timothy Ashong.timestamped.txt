[17:07] if you're going to have your kids
[17:08] running outside just make sure that
[17:10] you're with them so there's no accident

[49:00] life yeah
[49:02] same minute
[49:04] so let him
[49:06] choose for you and let him lead you
[49:13] yes and the Bible tells us
[49:15] when he brought the children of Israel
[49:18] out of Egypt he let them
[49:21] by day and by night yes

[49:34] it never took it away from them
[49:40] so let him lead you
[49:45] it might say to you oh what is he where
[49:48] is this but he knows the way
[49:54] it might not be clear to you but follow
[49:57] the leadership
[50:01] and the prophet of God said
[50:04] the leadership of God today
[50:07] is to follow the Vindicated message of
[50:10] the hour by the Holy Ghost
[50:14] the leadership of God today is to follow
[50:17] the Vindicated message of the hour by
[50:21] the Holy Ghost
[50:25] Hallelujah
[50:27] not you don't need you don't need your
[50:30] thoughts

[50:35] we need thus say yes the Lord amen
[50:39] amen we need his mind amen
[50:44] amen so young man
[50:47] young woman
[50:49] parents loved ones young and old let him
[50:53] lead us yeah
[50:58] Hallelujah
[51:02] that's why we need the mind of Christ
[51:06] we must tie to our own thoughts
[51:10] to our own ideas
[51:14] oh Hallelujah
[51:17] the prophet of God preached on the guide
[51:19] right and he said the guide must know
[51:22] the way
[51:24] and he said you don't argue with the
[51:27] guide right
[51:30] because the God is afraid
[51:33] to take you through
[51:38] he knows how to survive
[51:42] and so no matter what it will be
[51:46] guide he
[51:52] so he sent us the guide the Holy Ghost
[51:55] to guide us
[52:01] he brought him out of Egypt
[52:04] and he told Moses
[52:08] where to pass
[52:13] he told the leader because God's will
[52:17] always comes to his messenger
[52:22] surely
[52:23] the Lord God will do nothing right
[52:26] but Revenge
[52:28] is unto his servants the prophets
[52:33] the prophet he might not qualify to you
[52:37] as a prophet right but God chooses him
[52:41] that this is my prophet
[52:44] he may not quality to you but he is
[52:48] qualified to God
[52:49] chooses God a day God selects
[52:55] he may not be your likening
[53:01] but he said no no it's not qualified
[53:03] somebody can do it better yes somebody
[53:06] can do it better but God chooses this
[53:08] one to do it
[53:11] do your opinion somebody might do it
[53:14] better but God knows who can do it well
[53:18] God knows who can please him
[53:23] and so the scripture says
[53:26] know your calling
[53:28] not many Nobles
[53:31] not many mighty men but God has chosen
[53:35] the best things of this life to confound
[53:39] the mighty
[53:43] that is God's to see
[53:45] so Jesus said you have not chosen me but
[53:49] I have chosen you
[53:52] oh yes we might not qualify in the sight
[53:55] of people
[53:57] not qualified to be a Christian
[54:00] nobody had this one too and that one too
[54:02] but he choose us yeah
[54:06] we are his choice
[54:09] somebody say praise the Lord

[54:14] God that he did not search for any man's
[54:17] opinion

[54:25] if he has such somebody's opinion am I
[54:29] not qualified
[54:30] that's right oh no not this one no don't
[54:33] choose him because he has done this and
[54:34] done that
[54:35] because it's like this and it's like
[54:37] that amen but thank God he did not serve
[54:40] any man's opinion he made that decision
[54:44] he made that choice yes and he decided
[54:47] that I am going to save you
[54:50] I am going to save this one I'm going to
[54:53] save this one and the Bible said he for
[54:56] new US amen before the foundation of the
[55:00] world
[55:02] he choose us in Christ yes
[55:06] he choose you
[55:09] and
[55:12] he wrote our names
[55:15] in the last book of life
[55:17] before the foundation of the word
[55:23] before and anything was formed right
[55:26] he purpose in himself
[55:31] with that consultation
[55:34] he didn't consult nobody that's right
[55:37] he did not construct he didn't even
[55:39] consult you
[55:42] didn't ask your mind
[55:44] he didn't ask your thoughts he didn't
[55:47] ask your idea he didn't ask whether you
[55:50] want to be saved or you don't want to be
[55:52] saved he decided I will save this one
[55:56] somebody said prison life
[56:00] all glory to God so he decided the time
[56:05] you should come in that's right
[56:07] the hour you should come in right right
[56:09] well you should come here he decided yes
[56:16] the prophet of God said amen
[56:20] it is God's choice right for you to be a
[56:22] Christian amen right
[56:26] hallelujah it's his choice yeah

[57:11] go by the way of the Wilderness go by
[57:13] the way of this place pass through the
[57:15] rest go here and pharaoh
[57:18] we think that you are stranded in the
[57:21] wilderness
[57:23] and it will come after you
[57:27] so before Pharaoh taught anything God
[57:30] knew his thoughts
[57:33] what you will be thinking
[57:35] amen and he knows our thoughts too amen
[57:38] amen the Bible says
[57:40] he see our thoughts are far off
[57:46] in the prophet of God said
[57:49] your thoughts
[57:51] and my thoughts
[57:52] sounds so loud
[57:55] in his presence than what we say
[57:59] whatever we think about
[58:02] he hears it he sees it may God help us
[58:06] that our thoughts will be his word
[58:10] and if there's any wrong thoughts may he
[58:13] take it out
[58:17] so that we have the mind of Christ amen
[58:23] like I've always said and I said to
[58:25] people
[58:26] to serve God
[58:29] you have to lose your mind
[58:35] lose your mind then you have the mind of
[58:39] Christ
[58:43] you can never serve God you can never
[58:46] please God
[58:51] amen so we need to lose our mind
[58:54] your reasons
[58:57] your feelings and your opinions
[59:00] lose it and get the mind of Christ
[59:04] because that is the only way we can
[59:07] please God by the mind of Christ amen
[59:14] amen hallelujah
[59:18] what a wonderful savior we are saving
[59:22] may God help us
[59:25] to surrender our way to him
[59:29] our choice to him
[59:31] our desire to heal
[59:34] Lord not my will right right
[59:39] not the way I want to live right
[59:43] what I want to do
[59:45] look how I want to do it
[59:49] right not where I want to work tomorrow
[59:52] and how I want to live but where you
[59:55] want me to go yes
[59:57] what you want me to do amen
[1:00:00] how you want it to be done
[1:00:04] let me die to my ideas and my thoughts
[1:00:08] right
[1:00:09] so that I will have the mind of Christ
[1:00:11] amen
[1:00:13] that's what the Bible told us
[1:00:18] by revelation
[1:00:20] offer them to God a more excellent
[1:00:24] sacrifice than came
[1:00:28] the Bible said
[1:00:30] God took him
[1:00:32] hey can't you see whatever has done
[1:00:37] if you want to be accepted do whatever
[1:00:40] has done amen
[1:00:42] brother Branham said
[1:00:44] but kid was too proud
[1:00:47] to Humble his pride
[1:00:51] too proud amen
[1:00:53] amen don't be too proud and
[1:00:56] forsake your way
[1:00:58] and Camp he's provided way
[1:01:03] because
[1:01:05] the race
[1:01:07] provide that way in everything yes sir
[1:01:10] that's right
[1:01:12] and the Bible says amen ask for God his
[1:01:16] ways are perfect yes right amen
[1:01:26] so we are asked to forsake our own ways
[1:01:31] and take his way that is why he says a
[1:01:35] prophet and the mind of God comes to the
[1:01:38] prophet and the prophet preaches the
[1:01:40] word of the Lord and he tells us he
[1:01:43] receives from God and then he declares
[1:01:45] the mind of God Amen he receives from
[1:01:48] God and he declares the mind of God
[1:01:51] because a prophet is raised up above an
[1:01:56] ego yes the flash so I
[1:02:00] and this is far and
[1:02:03] amen that's why the rich the Watchman on
[1:02:06] the tower amen watch man what of the
[1:02:09] night yes yes I said a Watchman has to
[1:02:12] have good sight yes
[1:02:15] amen
[1:02:18] so they get somebody that is good
[1:02:21] and so God's prophets are eagles
[1:02:24] so the gospel and they go into God
[1:02:29] and they kept the thoughts the mind of
[1:02:31] God and they bring it out
[1:02:35] hey my sons my daughters this is the way
[1:02:39] I want you to live
[1:02:41] God makes his mind know
[1:02:44] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[1:02:46] reveal it his Secrets unto himself and
[1:02:49] the prophets
[1:02:50] amen so he sent us a prophet in our day
[1:02:52] he has done it through all generations
[1:02:56] and in our day he has done it again and
[1:03:00] he said a prophet to bring us the mind
[1:03:02] of God Amen
[1:03:05] brother Branham said
[1:03:07] I don't say these things of my own
[1:03:10] that's right I am just a voice that's
[1:03:14] right man it is what I surrendered
[1:03:16] myself to yes
[1:03:20] may God help us yes
[1:03:23] amen
[1:03:26] and when he brought him out
[1:03:30] it seems
[1:03:32] they were led into a trap
[1:03:35] it seems but it was not
[1:03:37] it was the enemies that was brought into
[1:03:39] a trap
[1:03:42] amen because when they came
[1:03:44] they came rushing
[1:03:49] and right behind them their enemies were
[1:03:53] coming yeah
[1:03:55] yeah and they begin to accuse the leader
[1:04:03] oh in the evening lost confidence in
[1:04:06] their leader they said let's make
[1:04:08] another leader and go back
[1:04:10] foreign
[1:04:12] let's go back
[1:04:14] just like today some of our breeding are
[1:04:16] going back right
[1:04:18] right they want to come back they take
[1:04:20] the leader has made a mistake
[1:04:23] the leader is not good enough
[1:04:31] but God was the one that choose that
[1:04:34] leader to lead them
[1:04:40] it was his mother's choice
[1:04:44] it was God's choice
[1:04:48] and so it wasn't brother Brandon's
[1:04:50] choice
[1:04:51] amen it was God's choice
[1:04:54] it wasn't Isaiah's Choice it was God's
[1:04:57] choice
[1:05:00] and it is not your choice it is God's
[1:05:03] choice
[1:05:08] hallelujah praise the Lord
[1:05:11] anyway don't think me to be crazy but if
[1:05:13] you think me to be crazy that's why hey
[1:05:16] because I have already told you you need
[1:05:18] to lose your mind amen amen
[1:05:25] praise the name of the Lord
[1:05:27] Hallelujah
[1:05:29] now
[1:05:32] the prophet of God said
[1:05:38] my if anytime it ever look
[1:05:42] like they ought to retreat
[1:05:45] was then
[1:05:46] but God has no retreat
[1:05:51] there is no place to retreat in God
[1:05:57] go forward
[1:05:58] [Music]
[1:06:00] the doctor says it is cancer go forward
[1:06:04] if he says it is
[1:06:06] go forward
[1:06:08] if the devil says you can't give up this
[1:06:10] go forward
[1:06:13] if your home says
[1:06:15] you are going to be a fanatic go forward
[1:06:18] yes the church takes you out go forward
[1:06:23] there is no retreating back
[1:06:26] go forward
[1:06:29] and go forward
[1:06:31] what
[1:06:32] his word and go forward thus saying the
[1:06:35] Lord and move on
[1:06:43] God brought him out of Egypt
[1:06:46] and they see they were brought into a
[1:06:48] trap but the prophet said God like to do
[1:06:52] things that way yes to give you a fire
[1:07:03] he said
[1:07:06] and as soon as they came out of Egypt
[1:07:09] God we found LED them right into a trap
[1:07:13] yes
[1:07:15] where Pharaohs Army behind them
[1:07:18] the rest see on either side
[1:07:22] and God put them to test
[1:07:26] and they got scared
[1:07:30] and it provoked God
[1:07:33] and said why do you cry to me
[1:07:37] just speak and go
[1:07:41] and God I like that
[1:07:50] notice
[1:07:52] they came to the Wilderness of sin
[1:07:56] where the waters were bitter matter
[1:08:01] why did God lead them to Bitter Waters
[1:08:05] why did God let the people to Peter what
[1:08:09] is
[1:08:11] it looks like he didn't have led them to
[1:08:14] good Waters
[1:08:16] but he led them to Bitter Waters
[1:08:20] so he could proved their faith
[1:08:24] he likes to do it
[1:08:27] amen
[1:08:29] he likes to let tribulation come to you
[1:08:34] to show he can to show he can show you
[1:08:39] his love and his power amen
[1:08:43] yes
[1:08:46] God brought them right there
[1:08:48] to give them a test
[1:08:50] to give it a trial
[1:08:55] and remember
[1:08:57] eating every one of us right has to be
[1:09:00] tested and tried yes amen
[1:09:05] none of us is with that fire right
[1:09:12] the Bible says us
[1:09:14] intestinesis he prays amen he tries amen
[1:09:20] heck he will do it
[1:09:22] but remember in
[1:09:24] my prayer will be different from your
[1:09:26] trial that's right amen
[1:09:28] amen your trial may be different from
[1:09:30] man
[1:09:32] so
[1:09:33] it is not wise to compare yourself to
[1:09:37] anybody
[1:09:39] it's not a wise thing to do
[1:09:42] and a spiritual person will never do
[1:09:44] that
[1:09:46] and you look at oh look at this one
[1:09:48] everything is fine for her everything is
[1:09:50] fine for this one that's what you are
[1:09:52] thinking it's just your thoughts right
[1:09:53] yeah
[1:09:56] at the Sun
[1:09:57] a child of God
[1:09:59] will be tried
[1:10:03] and brother Branham said
[1:10:05] the Christian Life
[1:10:08] if one is not absolutely centered on the
[1:10:12] word of the Lord right
[1:10:14] the Christian Life
[1:10:16] if one is not absolutely centered on the
[1:10:19] word of the Lord
[1:10:21] the Christian life holds a lot of
[1:10:24] disappointment
[1:10:25] amen
[1:10:27] amen
[1:10:30] it seems like that
[1:10:33] but he said
[1:10:36] just disappointments
[1:10:39] are guns with happening to us yes
[1:10:46] he said it might not look like that but
[1:10:48] it is amen
[1:10:53] so
[1:10:54] don't blame anybody that's right
[1:10:58] and don't condemn yourself
[1:11:03] why me
[1:11:05] why don't you
[1:11:08] why don't you
[1:11:12] think yourself to be oh you are
[1:11:16] why you should not be tested that's good
[1:11:19] that's good why you should not have
[1:11:21] challenges
[1:11:23] why you should not have challenges
[1:11:26] will I get sick why shouldn't you get

[1:11:29] that's right
[1:11:30] why shouldn't I get this easy why should
[1:11:32] you look at this easy
[1:11:34] and the prophet said The more lawyer you
[1:11:37] are the more they tested right
[1:11:40] and he said if you have a trial you find
[1:11:44] favor with God that's right amen and he
[1:11:47] said because God has confidence in you
[1:11:50] amen
[1:11:52] amen and he knows you will stand the
[1:11:53] trial amen
[1:11:56] as he had confidence in you
[1:12:00] we read about them in the scriptures
[1:12:03] we'll read about job we learn about
[1:12:05] different one of them amen
[1:12:07] amen they were men of like passing as we
[1:12:10] are amen
[1:12:11] they trusted in God
[1:12:14] so why shouldn't we trust in God
[1:12:19] if the Bible days are still here with us
[1:12:23] right the Bible is still alive amen amen
[1:12:26] God is still calling amen God is still

[1:12:42] he will make a way for you yes
[1:12:47] if you look back don't just go
[1:12:51] when he said go go
[1:12:57] and the children of Israel in this
[1:12:59] difficult hour
[1:13:01] God said to Moses tell the children of
[1:13:03] Israel to go forward
[1:13:10] and if he's here today with Timothy tell
[1:13:12] them to go forward right

[1:13:36] right
[1:13:37] right speak and go forward in faith
[1:13:39] and the Lord will make a way
[1:13:44] because God will never apologize
[1:13:48] for anything that he says
[1:13:53] the prophet said God is true to his
[1:13:56] promise no matter what
[1:13:59] he has to do
[1:14:02] no matter what it has to do he is true
[1:14:05] to his promise
[1:14:06] but brother

[2:03:33] we go through trials
[2:03:36] in the children of Israel they went
[2:03:38] through a lot of Trials
[2:03:41] did you know I believe Joshua and Kayla
[2:03:44] went through more
[2:03:47] they went through more
[2:03:50] no the children of Israel they complain
[2:03:52] and murmur through their trials that
[2:03:54] seemed like they were going through too
[2:03:55] many
[2:03:57] but Joshua and Caleb they were faithful
[2:04:00] they had to remain in the church for 45
[2:04:03] years
[2:04:04] right amongst murmuring and complaining
[2:04:10] and
[2:04:11] they all quit didn't make it or died
[2:04:16] but Joshua and Caleb they had to go
[2:04:18] through all that
[2:04:21] to take the land so if you got more
[2:04:23] trials than it seemed than you should
[2:04:24] that's okay

[2:23:28] amen
[2:23:30] and I do believe that God is leading us
[2:23:35] to remember one another in prayer
[2:23:38] there's times we all feel alone right
[2:23:41] and we we know despite
[2:23:44] our feelings the word says we're not
[2:23:46] alone but we still feel it
[2:23:49] we just need to remember to pray one for
[2:23:51] another
[2:23:52] pray one for another you know and I tell
[2:23:55] you sometimes it's just hard to enter in
[2:23:56] I know praise is one way
[2:23:59] and and sometimes we're we're so clouded
[2:24:02] with our situations but if you begin to
[2:24:04] pray for some for for others all of a
[2:24:07] sudden you feel his presence come and
[2:24:10] happening there is that you're touching
[2:24:12] the heart of God by seeking first the
[2:24:15] kingdom
[2:24:16] amen and so may you may we just continue
[2:24:20] to pray one for another how many once uh
