to do we'll be free totally free what a day that'll be i honestly thought we'd never ever go through what we're going through right now but i think it's it's going to get worse prophet said there's a squeeze coming somehow it's got to come it's good to see everyone i just want to read the scriptures and pray and then have you be seated and just share a couple things but if you would turn with me to the book of chapter 12 for opening scripture amen it's good to be with you all today i want to say it's been a while since we've been here thank you for inviting me back amen let's look to the lord in prayer and then we'll read a couple verses heavenly father we want to thank you for the privilege that we have today to be a christian lord that you've placed a desire in our heart to want to serve you you also placed a seed there that connected with your word that lord when we hear the truth something inside of us responds with amen so be it and today lord we're inviting you to come in the revealing of your word we thank you for this time of worship but lord unless you would reveal yourself down deep inside lord there's not a chance of a change that would be everlasting and lord we've come here to be changed i've come here to become more like you and i pray that you would grant it lord today as we look into these scriptures looking for encouragement looking for comfort looking for strength lord we know that inside of you are all these things and we just pray that you come now and have your way with our hearts lift us up into heavenly places we love you we thank you for these things trust you now in jesus christ's name amen amen hebrews chapter 12 very very familiar scriptures we've taken them a number of times but we just want to take a little thought different today chapter 12 verse number one we're foreseen we also are compassed about what's so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and the sin which just so easily beset us let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto jesus the author and finish of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross despising the shame and is set down at the right hand of the throne of god amen amen god bless you may be seated amen it is good to be with you i want to say i want to thank you for all your prayers for us um we appreciate them very very much we had a wonderful time of unwinding i would say of all the times that we went on vacation this time was probably the truest that i could see was a vacation for us we've done a lot of things when we went to savannah in the past and doing tours and and there's a lot of things to do still a lot of things we've never seen but we didn't do that um much of that this time and we i don't think we did much the last few years that we had gone there but uh i totally vacationed i you know brother mars been saying that to me for years for years but i how many times have you heard me brother mike you just can't you just you don't leave the burden come back to it you you carry it with you it's just wherever you go it's just and it's it's just been hard but i'll say it it was it was the grace of god to be able to just not think about things and uh we've heard this first time we ever able to like listen in on the services while we were gone and that was such a huge blessing because never really got to do that um and just just to know the word has been so good the word was good when we were gone just a wonderful word amen really really appreciate the word um and then work you know we've been working on a big project for about a year and a half and it was the last month and they the majority of that was done and uh under control we didn't have to worry about work and to worry about church and it was totally just i i didn't study for a while i'll be honest with you hang me if you want but it's a i've been doing it daily for i don't know how many years and just to know that i didn't have to preach that next sermon that i didn't have to study for that next sermon so that when i and then as soon as i did read my bible as soon as i did begin to pray as soon as i did begin to listen to a tape boom it's that brother bruce knows this that that gift just begins to go start again and uh and you you i i didn't realize um how bad i needed to vacation i just i've never been i never really experienced it honestly like i did it just with so many things and i'm i'm geared up to to start over again and uh but i'm so thankful to the lord for the time my wife is and is she drew closer to the lord she took this time her testimony was that she just dropped so closer to the lord and it's just wonderful all the way around it's very thankful for the word that we had that that message uh we had a lot of wonderful messages uh and i like this this last message we had sunday by brother bruce uh about being certain of god we're we're in a world of so much uncertainty and we know that we can be certain that god is true god's word is true he cannot lie we're so certain of that but you know what is the issue the the issue really is are we certain of our relationship with god amen that's really where it is because god is not a liar he's not going to change but the problem is is satan tries to get the world thinking they're certain man you'll come to me in that day and say lord lord did not die they were so certain they were gonna make it to the rapture so there's a false sense of certainty so it's when jesus said be ready what was he really saying we we know that god is certain amen and we know the word is the world is not certain but we need to be certain of our relationship with god that's what we need to be certain about that's why we come to church is is to that's how we get ready that's how we become certain with god our relationship with god i got to exercise when i was there i also found out when i got back on the scale that i gained weight and that's why i'm never going to exercise again i knew that was a culprit well i tell you when i first started i i walked the beach and then came back and i'll tell you it was it was hard walking in that sand not being used to it and i thought well this is the time i'm not gonna i'm not doing anything else i might as well take care of myself and so i began to walk more and i began to jog and i could oh man i was so out of breath i didn't think i'd be able to i was like embarrassed to you know you go out there and you see people jog in there it's like you're like no problem i can't hardly make it you know 300 feet so i went bought some running bought this half exercise ball i was there had it shipped to be there so i'm laying on trying to do these sit-ups and the point i'm saying all this to bring you with me is when i first started out i could hardly do anything but by the time i was done i was able to run four miles without stopping that's how our faith is our faith maybe can't do a whole lot what we'd like it's about to do now but if you just keep exercising a little bit and it's hard it is hard to exercise your faith because you gotta let go and trust god gotta let go of situations and trust god it's not easy but if you continue to exercise you will grow in christ so we spent some time uh exercising our body and i will just tell you what the scripture says that prophet little anything that you do to exercise this life and make it more comfortable it profits very little but we come this morning to exercise godliness amen to grow in christ this morning we want to entitle this message focusing on the lord and for a subject remembering to focus more on the lord remembering it's something that it's so easy not to remember and the more we can remember to focus on the lord the more we're going to see the lord in this late hour we're living in it's really hard to focus on the lord just about every text i'm getting from overseas from a lot of them i'll just say it like this a lot of the news that we hear a lot of the pop-ups on the phone it's about colvin there are so many things to grab our attention to steal our attention covet is one of them how fast the world has changed in the last year sickness leaving behind mandatory mass to function in society mysterious vaccines that only time is going to tell what's happening a questionable economy fraud government corruption hijacking our constitution human trafficking unprecedented expansion of gays not just the rights i'm talking about the gays and i've never seen such an explosion before in life of something new than the transgenders that thing is an explosion it putting gay right and so far in the dust that thing took uh i don't know have 50 years to come about but this transgender in just years boom it's it's going to surpass the gays it is horrible yeah before we were talking about coming out of the closet and now they're telling a children or making it clear that children that are in grade school it's okay for them to make a decision of who they really are corrupted news that we can't trust no matter what you read you want to believe it but you can't tv corrupting everybody there's very few people that want to work anymore unless people want to work everywhere we went down there signs everywhere help wanted help wanted help wanting they they they kept telling us that they don't want to work because they're getting free money that's what i heard it's no longer the land of opportunity work for what you want no sir here comes another seamless check unemployment extensions socialism doesn't give people a reason to want to get ahead satan the author of confusion the master of deception has made it very difficult for all of us to focus on what's really important which is the lord if we're not careful the enemy can even use us to grab attention from the lord so we'll want to get people to look at us because we feel like we have something that they don't when really we ought to be pointing people to the lord we don't want to deflect any attention away from the lord in fact we want to get people to look to the lord that's what reaching out is all about there's a lot of attention grabbers out there work can be a huge grabber of our attention finances bills house projects vacations car problems all the miscellaneous things that pop up but regardless of what's transpiring in the world or in our lives it's our personal responsibility to keep our focus on the lord we can't expect church to do it and we can't expect there to be no financial problems and we can't expect there to be no health problems and we can't expect everything to be just picture perfect for us to say okay i love you jesus i'm gonna spend some time with you we can make work our excuse we can make those things our excuses but in god's sight they will never be an excuse for us we and we alone have the responsibility of focusing not only on the author but the finisher of our faith we started him with christ and we need to continue on with so many things to divert our attention we need to help keep our eyes on jesus we need things to assist us to help us and i wrote down three things here i like that service that our brother josiah brought about three things but every single one of these three things i'm going to share with you takes discipline disciples of christ discipline themselves you don't ever find a christian who's not disciplined coming to church is number one it will help you keep your eyes on jesus coming to church preparing your heart and truly subjecting yourself to the living word will always improve your focus i'm talking about just coming to church and being a pew warmer talking about really subjecting yourself to the word brother branham said it's where we come to know where we're standing with the lord god could use the latest news he could use your best friend he could use your favorite song but he chose to use the office of the sanctuary to deal with our lives and to show us playing there where we stand in our relationship with god and i know we don't want anybody telling us where we stand in our relationship with god and i am not here to tell you where you stand with your relationship with god because i don't know but i know the word does amen and if you separate the man who's speaking from that word then god's got a chance to deal with your relationship but if it's all about brother john and me well it's going to be easy to turn the button off turn a deaf ear be have a hard heart god loves you god loves us but guaranteed we can't go in the rapture the way we are he's taking us somewhere and so coming here to hear the word is will help us to stay focused on him i think it was god who told moses and there i will meet with thee and i will commune with thee from above the mercy seat of all things which i give thee in commandment now that's referring to your heart what's really happening in there it's not referring to the things that happen during the day it isn't about you know we want answers for this this this and this this god is communion with the things that he's commanding you to do brother branham said in the message uh uh the mercy seat of christ no the mercy seat of christ god rich in mercy god rich in mercy he said there's two parts to redemption one is coming out and one is going in right amen and we know when we all came to christ it was total god's mercy we weren't looking for him we didn't do nothing to deserve them it was god's mercy but he makes this statement a few times in this message he says that you cannot receive mercy without doing what he tells you to do so after you come to him that was mercy god rich in mercy no doubt about it but as you continue your walk you got to do what he tells you to do now why didn't the children of israel go into the promised land why didn't they receive that holy ghost that that promise of god they did not continue to walk in what god said they did not get the mercies of god they didn't continue to receive the mercies of god so it's really really important of what god speaks to us when we go to church because that's what he's wanting us to carry out he says we've got to carry out what god told us to do if we expect to have mercy from god it's very strong nothing can take the place of church nothing and i'll say it like this all the morse we see the day approaching and we see the enemy just trying to lay so many things that it's not a big deal i can live stream or i can just catch up right i got this going and god understands friends that's you just what you're doing is you're speaking things that are not in the message you're speaking things that are not in the bible you're speaking thoughts that are not coming from the holy ghost number two brother brandon says if you pray sincerely and read your bible you'll become more spiritual the problem is we it gets out of balance too much reading and none of praying amen do you know what that will result in i've seen it many times a religious spirit a religious spirit because you've got so much word which brother branham didn't say you can't read too much he said you can't pray too much if you want to get out of balance pray too much if you think if you think you're leaning towards i don't want to be out of bounds just pray a whole bunch but to go ahead and and say lord bless the word i'm going to read today read for a half hour no pray as much as you read keep the balance because you'll keep the right spirit the devil don't mind if you get religious he just doesn't want you living the life he doesn't want you selling out to spend more time to win a soul for jesus become puffed up religious and and no more and feel you got something right prayer will put you it'll put you in the driver's seat with god number three brother brahms said that faith that we need to make this rapture lies within the tapes did not he say that but just listening to the message won't bring that faith it needs to become real to you it needs to become personal to you if god speaks to you it may not be enough you've got to respond with a course of action you've got to god is never ever you look when he called all his disciples he he called paul he called all his disciples he said come and i'll make you fishers of men there was something to do from the gate right yeah you may go through a a period of training and learning and walking close with the lord but pretty soon you're going to get kicked out of the nest and he's going to tell you to go and do what i've called you to do now all three of these things require discipline to do them properly or else you'll read your bible without praying which we're all guilty of we'll listen to tapes while we're doing something else simultaneously it's the truth and though well at least where i'm getting some word well that's fine but you need that's not how you get rapturing faith friends well i got something out of it it made me it you know it just confirm that's wonderful but that's you need to get into that and be searching for what you need to do what god's called you to do if you're not careful you can come to church haphazardly but if we do things properly it'll help us to keep our eyes focused on the lord once we focus on the lord clearly we got the 20 20 vision the result will be we'll be working according to the purpose of god because we've been predestinated to his ministry to carry it out he he's gone and he left his disciples to carry it out he didn't give him something new to do and now it's our turn if we lived with the times of jesus we would have been in the upper room and we would have been uh persecuted and been scattered to another if we would have been the 13th or the 14th disciple we would have been out going to another country doing something but now we're living in this time and his purpose is the same we like to think things have changed but they're not because god's goal is to get his family together amen there's another thing that we can do to help keep focused but it requires discipline i want you turn with me to psalms 103 verse 1. are you with me today i want you to benefit from the lord today psalms 103 verse 1 is psalm of david bless the lord o my soul and all that's within me bless his holy name bless the lord all my soul and forget not all his benefits amen forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who he with all thy diseases who redeemeth thy life from destruction who crown of thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies who satisfyeth thy mouth with good things so that the youth is renewed like the eagles i think when i first met the lord or he came to me showed himself to me i didn't realize i realized i was bad i'm going to be honest with you that was a bad boy but i didn't realize how bad i was my life was headed for disaster but he redeemed my life from destruction can you imagine where we had been if we hadn't taken heed to the lord when we did amen i was a bad guy and i don't want to get into how bad it is just a bunch of time we heard it so many times i'll take a flip side here with another man his name was paul saul at the time now when he met the lord he was in a much better condition than i was he was a religious fanatic he was an extremist he believed in god so much he was willing to kill for it he had extreme confidence in his flesh we are told that he was circumcised the eighth day the stock of israel the tribe of benjamin a hebrew of the hebrews is touching law a pharisee concerning zeal he persecuted the church touching righteousness which is in the law he was blameless so if i stood next to saul i would be looking up to him and saying well i'm a bad guy amen because religiously he had it together and i wasn't religious so whether you're today halfway bad all the way bad or perfectly self-righteous know it all in your own eyes paul said it straight when he said in ephesians chapter 2 verse 3 among whom also we all had our conversations in times past in the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of our flesh and our mind and we're by nature the very nature we were born with the children of wrath even as others but god who was rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in our sins for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son for you and i where would we be without god sharing his life with us god blessed and saved us amen he redeemed our life from destruction he forgave all of my sins all of my iniquities all of my transgressions he crowned me with loving kindness and tender mercies he has blessed my soul with freedom amen but at the same time it's made me feel in debt to him ever since i guess it doesn't make everyone feel that same way but people can forget that christ what christ has already done for them becomes something of the past peter talking about the importance of continuing to build your life in god's character he said that if the seven fruits of grace be inside of you they'll make you continue to be fruitful in christ did not he say that but ii peter chapter 1 verse 9 says but he that lacks these things is barren and is blind and cannot see afar off and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins think about that state cannot see afar off in other words it's not really worth suffering for to try to help somebody right now because i ain't going to get nothing out of it can't see a far off can't see the benefit of how that's going to help that person can only see what's happening right here what i can get out of this right now i want to feel good right now i want to feel praised right now can't see you far off can't see eternal things all i can see is living for myself and have forgotten that he was purged from his old sins oh yes that's that's just old news i know that already he did that for me a long time it's done what do we need to keep you know going over that for it's in the past done forgotten why are those nail prints still there when we get to heaven he doesn't want us to forget it takes discipline on our end to keep him ever before us i think it was david it says i hide thy word in my heart that it not sin against thee today i feel more in debt to god than ever today you know how in debt you felt when you first got saved you're so happy you want to tell everybody you're excited you're a different person even though you were no different at that second you told everybody you're a changed person that's how excited you were about it amen but you began to change that was the day that you began to change and god molded us into something that we never thought we'd become even though he paid my debt and set me free i now am in debt to god and become a prisoner to christ think about those thoughts so am i free am i free in my flesh to do what i want to do or am i free from my flesh people get so mixed up about why i can do what i want to do now because jesus set me free i can live my own life i can do my nobody's going to tell me that's why you can get those spirits on you when god's trying to tell you something i don't have to listen and i'm free jesus set me free we're not free right he bought us with a price we belong to him amen we're indebted to him he wants to remind us what he did for us i hung for you he doesn't want us to feel bondage but he he wants to remind us that we're not free in our flesh how can we be free in our flesh when we're supposed to mortify the deeds of our body every day and die daily and and and give up the the lust of the flesh so we're free to serve god freed from the flesh to serve god in the spirit to serve one another to reach out for souls it's not about just i've forgotten that he went to calvary for me romans 8 verse 12 says therefore brethren we are debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh come on can you say amen to the word i just just i just just spoke the word there second corinthians chapter 5 verse 15 and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again we remember calvary it isn't that we've forgotten calvary it isn't that we've that it hasn't had an effect on our life but sometimes we can forget the freshness of calvary in our lives the the realness today the impact today it needs to be more meaningful to us with all these distractions we need to keep focused on the lord sometimes we can forget the power of calvary that it has that it can continue to impact our life every day our faith can begin to dwindle because of the world you think about it the world invades our mind constantly we come to church and we hear the word a little bit we read a little bit listen to tapes a little bit but the devil's got us a lot more and so what is really needed is we need to discipline our thoughts when we're away from the lord when we're away from church when we're away from the bible in other words we need to be living what we're hearing during those times putting them into action we need to be remembering the lord sometimes i feel that we've forgotten that we owe god our lives on a daily basis we get to where we just feel like we owe my attendance at church we can feel free sometimes and forget that we've been bought with a price that we're no longer our own i think that's the reason a lot of people don't want to give their heart to the lord because they won't be able to do what they want to do and then there's a lot of people who who baptize and say i'm going to start with the lord but afterwards decide to swim back out into the world it's it's not for everybody and there's no way who is going to have a garden this year let me see your hands okay you're going to plant some tomato plants there's no way you can plant a tomato plant and expect cucumbers to come out i mean cucumbers will not come up because it's a tomato seed to begin with it will come forth as a tomato seed we don't know who's who we shouldn't be disappointed we we just need to be getting the word out to all as many as we can that's our job is as much i mean i cheryl says man you're looking dark i'm think she's um some i look like brother mark when i'm done and no matter what i do i can't be brother mark amen amen we just need to identify ourselves with the lord become the lord become his wife on a daily basis sometimes we can forget to bless the lord with our soul just use our lips just over this that i hope they do my favorite song what about just bless the lord with your soul amen bless him for what he's done for you sometimes we can forget all the benefits that he has for us we have a sign hanging in the office in the back this is working for the lord doesn't pay much but the benefits are out of this world it's true there's a a lot of benefits that are coming in the life but there are so many benefits here that we could have with the lord just want to take a look at those for a moment bless the lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits think about the benefits of the lord think about how he treats you on a daily basis how he serves you how he supplies your needs how he provides for us god is so good think about the all the benefits god doesn't want us to forget sometimes we get so caught up and i need i need i want lord help with this and we forget the benefits that we have god doesn't want us to visualize him as an errand boy but he wants us to take time to count our blessings to name them one by to trust him when we have a need because the benefit of serving the lord is that he is a present help in a time of trouble a present help what a benefit to have a present help with you wouldn't you like to have enough money that you don't matter if your car blew up if the furnace just went on the air conditioning today you'll be happy to have air conditioning in your car in your home but it'll be nice to have enough money that no matter what happened absolutely we had a prophet came and told us that god has handed his bride the checkbook the benefits of being associated and attached to your husband who owns a cattle on a thousand hills the benefits amen forget not all his benefits that's a lot of benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities god promised to forgive all our iniquities do you believe that the bible says the father smote his sinless son at calvary surely had borne our griefs and carried our sorrows surely he was wounded for our transgression surely he was bruised for our iniquities it was paul told the romans in chapter 4 verse 7 blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven whose sins are covered god's love cover a multitude of sin that's right don't you think for a moment that yours are too great amen are too dirty are too bad shouldn't have happened do not be little demoralize or water down god's blood there's still power in the blood today think about all the benefits that we have today don't forget them saint wants you to forget that benefit because he wants to blow up and magnify your problem your sin your mistake or you're outright i got upset and angry and i don't care who knows about it don't matter he wants you to magnify it you just gotta remember the benefit of the lord [Applause] there'll be nobody nobody that will be able to prove to god on the day of judgment that his blood wasn't great enough to handle any sin blessed is the man who god will not impute sin amen we're blessed today amen bless the lord o my soul and for you know his benefits let the soul bless the lord amen not the flesh not the carnality let go and let god have his wonderful way there in a person here that can take your sin away and a person here that can take your iniquity away it doesn't matter if you uh sinned against somebody and you say you're sorry and or they say they're sorry to you that's okay that's that's wonderful but that sin can't be taken away outside of jesus christ what a benefit we have today for that reason and i'll tell you look it i'm still causing iniquity i'm still transgressing i'm still falling and falling and falling 100 times a day today he forgiveth all our iniquities not just our past but the ones that are happening that's a reason to remember to bless the lord all my soul he wants us to remember him why so we praise him so we give him the praise that he's worthy of amen he forgiveth all our iniquities all of them that means the ones that will transpire next week remember there's a blood we're still transgressing but bless his name he's still forgiving keep focused on the finisher of our faith not just the author but the finisher he's taken us through he that have begun a good work and he's going to finish it he's going to complete he's going to perform it until the day of jesus christ i say bless the lord o bride of jesus christ with all your soul bless the lord give him the praise as if you are bride don't don't worship the lord as if you're some half by somewhat think i'm trying my best to worship the lord as his bride hang on his arm like his wife show off to everybody he's he's my husband let your soul rejoice the benefits that your husband gives you there's so many benefits to serving the lord don't forget any of his benefits he's continuing to redeem our lives from a world of destruction today this terrible world that we're living in the world is really going insane it's really going insane i remember years ago brother bill making a statement he said we're blessed just to have a sound mind in other words about a look at a situation and discern right and wrong because the world don't know who they are what they are they're just all right yeah whatever but he's continuing he's a present god he is still the i am amen not that i was the i am the remember what i'm doing for you what i did at calvary was for what happened yesterday hey man what i did at calvary what's gonna be for you tomorrow he's presently crowning the bride of christ with his loving kindness he's blessing her with his tender mercies think about the times he speaks to you no matter how strong it is no matter what how much correction how bad it was you can still feel his loving kindness and his correction he's still shown that way of escape he's still showing you he's crowning our lives with love he's covering a multitude of sin in our lives we're still his bride regardless he satisfies us with good things good things you know what it means to be real real hot to get that water just satisfies you while you get done running four miles and you find got to run anymore he satisfies us with good things regardless of what's happening in the world get in with jesus get in that little cove with jesus that little harbor with jesus he satisfies us he provides us with faith confidence with promises all the promises of god should should satisfy us today he renews our strength to keep us pressing the battle let's not forget this benefit he presents help to us anytime that we need it anytime we're in trouble that's a benefit now of course if you can't believe he's presently going to help you he won't so your faith activates the benefits now if you were all in the world never knew christ my message to you would be salvation but you're saved today you came out of egypt today that's not the message our message today is conforming into the image of christ is is following through there are benefits that god has for us so whatever else that's going through in our life we've got to believe that he is a present help in our time of trouble and it takes faith to activate that if we're back in egypt well then we just follow you know get pushed out it was basically god pushed him out but today we've got to believe believe that god's going to help us god's going to meet our needs amen god is leading us into a catching away amen he's leading us into a perfect love he's leading us into a perfect faith think of the benefits of the lord he is leading us we need to keep focused on that do you realize the benefit of being able just to use the name of jesus just using his name devils devils have to leave you you can command them out of your home out of your body out of your relationships just by the name of jesus our hearts are mended things are restored unity is fortified our church is blessed our church can overcome in the name of jesus it can grow it can even thrive in the name of jesus i've quoted this before but jfk he once said don't ask what this country can do for you ask what you can do for this country and a lot of times we can become so selfish in our thoughts asking what this church can do for me to make me feel better what you should be doing is asking lord what can i do for the church to help it amen we're far enough along it ain't we're not new comers anymore we have a responsibility most everything that i've done i haven't been able i haven't been asked by another person but i've taken time to say with my heart lord what would you have me to do and when you hear a prophet say put the shell on the gun pull the trigger if it don't hit the target stick another one in don't you wait for somebody to ask you what to do your relationship with god should be greater than that don't wait for somebody to say stand up here and preach there's much more to church than preaching and if you want to preach get a mirror i'm so thankful for brother bruce in the ministry that we have here i i honestly can say this with all my heart i have seen such beauty develop in brother bruce and his ministry it's just been beautiful but i'm saying there's more to church than being behind here for an hour it's what you're doing the other 23 hours of that day where is your heart for the church just take the time to say lord what would you have me do and i know this if you mean it from your heart god will show you what to do bringing one soul to christ is worth more than a million sermons worth more than all the sermons that we can preach it's not the ability to preach is letting god use your body to bring someone to jesus the value of that is so mighty did not he say that one leaving the lord is worth he'll he'll leave the 99 to go after that one amen god's heart is reaching out for those who are out of the way i want to ask you this question you've seen other people sitting in this church that you haven't seen in a while my question to you my brother my sister is why haven't you done anything about it well nobody told me i'm not their friend i thought you were their brother and sister see our lives can become just about us and our family but this church is not about us and our family amen it's about us and our family [Laughter] we're all the same family those are not my notes john 14 13 thinking about the name of jesus now whatsoever you ask in my name that will i do think of that benefit whatever you ask in my name that will i do that the father may be glorified in the son if you ask anything in my name i will do it the benefit of the name of jesus what a benefit that name amen sometimes we just bow our heads okay i gotta pray sometimes we get at the table and it's time to pray and everybody's going you pray i prayed last time you pray what a benefit amen to use the name of jesus to lift up the name of jesus bless the lord church for getting out his benefits did you know that god sends the holy ghost to you to your heart in his name it's through the name of jesus that's what the scripture says john 14 verse 26 but the comforter which is the holy ghost whom the father will send in my name yes he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remains whatsoever i have said unto you amen the name of jesus will bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever i've told i don't think god wants us to forget god wants us to remember the benefits that we have amen in my name they shall lay hands on the sick and they shall recover what a benefit we don't want to forget it sometimes we just go home sick you know i've already tried it it didn't work well if i go up again i'm not supposed to go for prayer every time that's right you're not supposed to you're supposed to get serious with god spend more time with him in prayer and when you're serious about believing it with all your heart no matter what then you come up for prayer amen the scripture says let the elders uh anoint you with oil and lay hands on you that is scripture that's a benefit in serving the lord amen god doesn't want us to forget that but we can't be haphazard about it amen bless the lord oh my soul and forget not all his benefits who forgiveth all thy knickers who heal with all thy diseases let's believe it no matter how we feel the bible says the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we were healed it is true that jesus bore those stripes upon his back for our healing but today we have to use the name of jesus amen when peter and james was that saw a lame man asking for alms at the gate called beautiful in acts chapter 3 verse 6 peter said silver and gold have i none but such as i have i give thee in the name of jesus christ of nazareth rise up and walk amen the benefit of the name of jesus that we just don't put enough emphasis that we we forget about it god wants us to remember it amen look at verse 16 the same chapter and his name and his name through faith in his name have made this man strong the name of jesus let's use it amen amen greet one another in the name of the lord amen praise him in his name i happen to be watching a little red ring hockey game and during the intermission they were brought up a meeting they have i think four years into their unity of announcing the red ring games and they were with ellis cooper showed a picture of ellis cooper goodness when i was in the world that's what i thought was goodness when i went there but i thought to myself as they were talking about this anniversary or this time that they were so much lifting up the name of alice cooper in the in in praise i'll tell you we need to lift up the name of jesus not make him a backside well church yeah yeah we pray yeah we'll spend a little time with him yeah no everywhere in everything the more you can talk about the name of jesus the less trouble we're going to get into less distractions you know brother brandon had that cross there hanging yes was that a distraction no that was to keep him from being distracted he wants us to remember him the benefits that we have in the name of jesus in my name they shall cast out devils sickness has to leave the benefit of remembering the lord how many times you've been what do i do what do i do remember the lord remember the lord amen he's got everything under control remember lord wonderful message on patience we heard being patient this is a long race we're going to be running it till we're out of here amen forget not all the benefits of the name of jesus mark chapter 9 verse 41 for whosoever shall give you a cup give you a cup of water to drink in my name because you belong to christ verily i say unto you he shall not lose his reward the very you know you can just help somebody out but if you do it in the name of the lord there's the difference i do this in christ lydia baxter said take the name of jesus with you child of sorrow and of woe it will joy and comfort give you take it then wherever you go take the name of jesus ever as a shield from every snare if temptations round you gather breathe that holy name in prayer precious name oh how sweet hope of earth and joy of heaven god has given us his name he's given us his word don't forget it he's promised to give us wisdom if we only believe that we'll have it when we ask for it think about that he promised to give us more of him more of the holy spirit if we just keep asking and seeking and knocking we'll receive more he promised to never leave us nor forsake us what a benefit we have in the lord to just believe it how many times you where's the lord i don't feel he's with me it's because we're questioning it amen don't question it when you feel it just speak it regardless of what you feel amen since when is your feelings going to govern you govern your feelings with faith he holds us in the palm of his hand that's right amen he promised not to withhold anything from them that walk up ready what a benefit you can go and do your absolutely best job at work you can candy and harley get a thank you from your boss they still pick and find something you did wrong [Music] think about it but god said he'd not withhold anything from them who do a good job with him not beautiful we have the benefit of god's reward if we diligently seek him what greater reward could we have than more of the lord amen well i've spent some time praying i've spent some time i listened to this tape but i haven't got my answer what what's your question when are we going to just go through the course of the week and say lord i just want more of you [Music] when is it going to be about relationship that's what it should be about god will continue to show you his benefits the bible says an entrance to receiving more of god is ministered to us every time we come to church did you know that ii peter chapter 1 verse 10 wherefore the rather brethren give diligence to make your calling and your election sure you talk about being certain of god here's good direction for us for if you do these things ye shall never fall for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the everlasting kingdom of our lord and savior jesus christ think about what happens every time you come to church an entrance is being ministered to you how to get closer to god but you gotta walk through that entrance you've got to say amen so be it for me right amen that's you entering into the word amen and that day you'll know that i'm in you and you and me if my word if you if if my word if you abide in me and i in you ask what you will and it shall be done we've got to abide in the word and the words got to abide in us wherefore i will not be negligent to put you look at this word always in remembrance of these things though you know them and be established in the present truth so just because the preacher saying something you already heard 20 years ago doesn't mean he's off beat today god wants to put this in remembrance because he's trying to speak to us about something amen bless the lord all my soul and all that's within me bless his holy name and forget not all his benefits amen let's stand together we need to focus more on the lord he's not just the author but he's finishing it he's taken us through it's okay to come to church and hear a simple message that god wants us just to bless him and let those worship not just come from our thoughts but let it be so deep from our heart a worship of appreciation i when we were in savannah i don't know what it is but my wife and my daughter always expected me to cook and uh and um i don't i can't even remember why i was going to say that now oh i i remember now but i can't imagine i i know when i did the cooking i i sit there and i dress it all up we'd be taking pictures of the dinner and you're sitting there anybody there's a cook knows this you're sitting there you're eating you're waiting for somebody to take their first bite and you you want to hear them say something that's good you don't want to hear them say okay it's okay it's good they make fun of me because when something is different i say that's unique they interpret that as it's bad can't say that no more the lord is constantly preparing for us so many benefits he does for us on a daily basis we forget to take time to say thank you lord to where we just expect him to just to keep doing that's his job it's not his job that's his love it's his love towards us he just we can't build him a house heaven is home the earth is his footstool he's only wanting us to bless him to praise him to thank him for his blessings that he has blessed us with a very small token but in that is alone enough to where he said i will inhabit you i will inhabit you i would inhabit your praises it's not wanting to have it some thing that we build some perfect little church with a perfect altar a perfect bookcase you want perfect praise and praise can be perfected in a babe you got to be serving the lord hardly at all all you have to do is be so grateful and thankful for what god has done for you and don't lose it please that's what this message was about don't forget to praise the lord don't forget his benefits we ought to come to church with such an excitement i can't wait to get to the house of the lord i can't wait to praise him i can't wait to express my love back to him with my brothers and sisters this is the place that god chose to meet you well i like meeting god in my own house in my own car my own spot melon little cubby on my own cave my own little that's wonderful that's wonderful you keep doing that but god promised to meet you here well brother john he's with me forever ago he said never leave me never forsake me he's always with me praise him then as if he's with you if he's with you praise him i think i'm not mistaken and i need to be corrected here maybe ann can correct me or brother bruce grant but i think brother bruce made a statement says we don't praise him because we don't believe he's here that was a statement that he made we need to praise him like we believe he's here because let's say he's not here for a moment for a moment let's say he's not here your praise will draw him either way we need to praise him don't be satisfied i'm not coming till i feel him don't go there don't go don't have that really you're his bride the bride believes regardless of what they feel amen let's sing that little course bless the lord o my soul sing it with me bless the
