reach out and touch him to say that we love him open our ears Lord L and help us to [Music] listen open our eyes Lord we want to see [Music] Jesus hey amen let's just bow in a word of prayer our heavenly father this morning Lord were asking for your grace that you would open our eyes to see you to see you to see you clearly to see you high and lifted up to see you in your character to see you inside of us to see your desire for our lives Lord that we might pursue the right path that we might be seeking the right thing we pray that you come and be in every one of our hearts whatever ages would be Lord God we we need you to to bring us closer to you we we we don't know we can't we can't find the way to you unless you open our eyes to show us what we need to do so we humbly submit oursel to you this morning for our hearts prepared ready to receive you Lord may you come now and break the bread of life to us and we'll be careful to appreciate you well after the service today for we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen turn with me if you would to 1 Corinthians chapter 2en 1 Corinthians chapter 2 and we've read this scripture not too long ago but we want to title the message The Secret of seeing the secet secret of seeing and for a subject loving Christ is the secret to seen amen 1 Corinthians chapter 2 verse number nine but as it is written I have not seen nor ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things which God have prepared for them that love him but God have revealed them them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things ye the Deep things of God Amen God bless you you may be seated without spiritual eyes we simply cannot see reality Jesus said it like this you'll see but you do not understand so in other words you can't see with accuracy everybody's got an opinion when they said who do men say that I am they all had an opinion they weren't lacking opinion but they they didn't have eyes to see therefore they they weren't seen with accuracy they didn't understand and it really takes God's holy spirit to open our eyes so we can see correctly I think the most important thing I believe for a Believer is to know really who Jesus is because the Bible says when he comes we're going to be just like him so if our vision of Jesus is something less than what he is then we'll just become what we what we view him as if we just think he's someone that just daddy old grandfather or or Santa Claus then he just there to supply our needs then that's all he's going to be if he's just going to be out there to to be a Healer then it's always going to be but the Bible teaches us who Jesus Christ really is and it's from cover to cover and he's a lot more than what we visualize him being and I think it's just important for us to always be praying Lord open my eyes that I can see you plainly one time Elisha's servant gesley he looked through carnal eyes when he saw that he was surrounded by the enemy and Elijah prayed that God would open his eyes so that he could see the hills were full of horses and Chariots of Fire from Heaven Elijah said fear not for they that be with us are more than they that be with them and this morning if we could look into that Dimension we would see that there would be Angels camped round about us today they're here brother B said the angel of the Lord that God is represented here where the message is being preached and so though we came can't see it we believe it 2 Kings 6:18 says and when the enemy came down to them Elisha prayed unto the Lord and said Smite this people I pray thee with blindness and he smoke them with blindness according to the word of Elisha so here God purposely blinds people and purposely opens the eyes oh what we want to do is find out what makes it go either way we want to find how we can get on the side of making sure that God is opening our eyes amen this man of God had a love relationship with God and through prayer his eyes were open I'll say that is the secret for us we're never ever going to know God without a love relationship it is impossible because that is the the first criteria love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all th might with everything that you have Amen brother Bram says I'd rather just spend five minutes with him in his presence than to spend five years in some Seminary learning about God his presence and that takes a love to get into his presence because the flesh just doesn't want to Matthew 11:20 then began he to upgrade the cities wherein most of his mighty Works were done because they repented not so in other words Jesus was really helping the people and showing that God was alive among them and they didn't believe the words that he was speaking we have a lot to learn just by that statement there he says woe unto thee coren woe unto thee Bethesda for if the mighty Works had been done in you that had been done in tyri and sidon they would be they were repented long ago in sackcloth and Ashes so here Works were done among them and and they didn't repent but if the same Works would have been done in another place they would have repented it's shown that there's a greater judgment coming but I say to you it shall be more tolerable for Tyrie and siden at the day of judgment than for you do you know there's more truth given in this hour than any other hour we'll be held accountable more amen there's a lot more to repent for amen but thou cernium which are exalted unto heaven shall be brought down to hell for if the mighty Works which had been done in thee had been done in Sodom it would have remained unto this day think about that statement because we know how Wicked Sodom was all the perversion just burned and and Lot's wife turned into salt and here Jesus is saying that if if the works that the people experienced when Jesus was there had been done at that time it would remain to this day and what what what would have changed it one thing repentance repentance turn it around for I say to you that it shall be more tolerable for the land of Sodom in the day of judgment than for thee wow and they they didn't see the the thing was to hear Jesus is saying it but they didn't think that right their eyes were blind and so he says here in his prayer the very next verse ver at that time at that particular time Jesus answered the situation and said I thank the oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth because thou has hid these things from the wise and The Prudent a group of people that were wise and prudent in their own eyes and is revealed them unto babes which babes don't think they got it all together and he said even so father for it seemed good in thy sight and all things are delivered unto me of the father and no man knoweth the son but the father neither knoweth any man the father Sav the son and he to who soever the son will reveal him we are at the mercies of Jesus Christ today opening our eyes to see him we could sit here and we could try to understand the scriptures that are being said intellectually make sense put them together logically look at them but unless God opens them to us we really can't see there's a secret to all the truth and it's right here that God would reveal himself to us to become like a babe be humble a babe babe is always dependent I mean if we we let amariah just here we say find your own way home it's just not going to happen but we that are older are old enough to know how to get home but a babe is dependent dependent on on clothes what we going to eat and just to a rough over my head amen and this is the type of a Christian that God reveals himself to one that is dependent on him amen don't be a old all don't talk like you got it all figured out don't talk like you know everything be meek Jesus said take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I am meek and low in heart and you shall find rest unto your souls Jesus said learn of me I he identifies himself with meekness he wasn't worried about his reput utation he took upon himself the form of a servant he humbled himself he was Meek God is Meek if God is Meek it'll take meekness to learn who God is you're not going to find out how Meek God is through some arrogancy or Pride if God is lowly in heart it will take a lowly heart to find rest for our souls about the very fact when we first gave our heart to God where worry we were broken we were needy we were we knew we had a revelation that we were lost without Jesus Christ amen and in that condition God came down because you were lowly he dwells with them of a humble and contrite heart and he lifted you up set you free the way that God does things hasn't changed since that day friends he is the same yesterday today and forever he still dwells on among the the lowly that's who he is he does not feel comfortable with Satan no th those those demons got kicked out evil spirits you don't feel comfortable with evil spirits you you you got to get serious with them because they'll do you damage now God hides himself from the wise and The Prudent prudent is someone who can mentally he able to put things together to make them sound the way they should be Proverbs 3:7 says be not wise in thine own eyes but fear the lord and depart from Evil is literally evil to be wise in your own eyes Isaiah 5:21 woe unto them that are wise in thine own eyes and prudent in their own sight whoa God will keep him self from those who are wise and and and prudent in their own eyes that's why it's important for you not to look at yourself as something even in the slightest little way and here the way to do it is don't look at somebody who is in worse condition than you that'll help you if you look at somebody that you want to be like right I want to be like Paul I want to be like Jesus well that'll help you to stay humble amen there's a secret to seeing all the truth and the secret is getting humble enough that God will reveal the treasures of his character to you because that's all he's coming back for he's not coming back for our money he's not coming back for our successes he's not coming back for a list of achievements he's coming back to marry a bride with his character and that's it he's looking for character brother that's the only thing we're taking with this woman believe what what is character character is Jesus Christ in your flesh that's what character is power without it is satanic he to whomsoever the son will reveal him don't you want to be the one that God reveals Amen brother Braham said pray for Revelation it's the most important thing that we could pray for but if you don't humble yourself you're not going to get Revelation because we've been told he hides from the wise and prudent he hides himself from the proud and the Arrogant he resists them so yes we got to pray for Revelation but we must pray with humility with with humbleness and loneliness and in a need the the time that you think you don't need anymore is the time you need to get to the altar get right with God because the spirit is wrong Paul said 2 Corinthians 4 but if our gospel be hid it is hid to them that are lost not hid to them that are saved that's why we should have this expectation that God wants to reveal all himself to us but if her if in whom the God of this world have blinded the minds of them which believe not lest the light of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is in the image of God should shine upon them blindness sets in when a person doesn't believe the truth and I don't care who's telling it to you I don't care if it's a 4-year-old an 8-year-old a 12y old a 100y old if the truth is being spoken to you if you do not receive that truth and walk in blindness is automatically going to set in your life amen we're told that blindness sets in when a spirit of hate gets on any one of us automatically blindness sets in because when you start to love less or give respect to persons to anybody God says that's a no no that's not my spirit that is the spirit of the devil blindness sets in when we are satisfied with just hearing the word right just satisfi what hearing I don't really need to like put this into practice so you you you here's some ammonition to get blind that's what I just gave you it's it isn't somebody coming to you and preaching to you some false Doctrine no you can see that thing on my all way but this Spirit of I don't have to because you know who's going to be in heaven brother BR says it's those that want to be there those that are are hungering to be like God thirsting to be like God God is more eager this morning to reveal himself to us than we are to have him now I not I'm just I'm talking spiritually now because we know that the seminaries and the colleges and all these places are filled with people who give money to go to them to learn about God build they have that desire but unwilling to Humble themselves to get some neology instead of some theology you understand I'm saying if you get Ser if you really want to know God get in that prayer room just spend five minutes get in his presence spend five minutes and I'm going to tell you you're going to feel a lot better you just can't go in there and pray you got to break through you got to pray through until the Holy Ghost comes you got to meet God I wish I could just say every time you pray you met God David said if I make my bed in hell God is there yes God is everywhere he knows everything but you know what I want to be I want to be lifted up into his presence I want to be caught up into Heavenly places with Jesus Christ that means I got to get out of the the carnality of of of Just My Flesh blessed are they that hunger and thirst after righteousness blessed are the meat for they shall inherit the earth blessed are your eyes for they see God is more eager to reveal himself to us than we want I think we just need to increase our hunger and thirst Jesus said blessed are thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not revealed the secrets unto you but my Father which is in heaven Upon This Rock The Rock of whom God reveals truth to which is Jesus Christ he's the only truth upon the revealing of who Jesus is is The Rock in which he builds his church in other words he's building Jesus Christ in you you are the tab of God it's not about claiming I I'm in the message I've been there five years it's not claiming that it's when you can get up in the morning look in the mirror and say I'm so sick of you I don't want I want Jesus Christ to be I want to look at Jesus Christ I want people to see Christ in me I want them to see the character in me I want better to handle things the way that Jesus handles them with the the right character the right the right spirit because the Pharisees could put us to shame they just didn't have the right Spirit Jesus said I will build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it this is the secret the secret to receiving truth Nicodemus was I'll say a top-notch Pharisee he was a ruler of the Jews the Bible says in other words he taught others yet when he came to church Jesus was preaching his spiritual eyes could not understand what the new birth meant he couldn't understand what it means to be born again by God's word he automatically went to Natural thinking when the word was being preached just being natural natural and God was speaking in the spiritual he knew the Bible but he didn't know God I mean think about it Satan knows the Bible better than anybody but he's not walking he's not born again so it's not about knowing knowing the word the letter of the word but knowing the Spirit of the word that's what's important the spirit Jesus said art thou a master of Israel a master and knowest not these things see there's a secret to knowing the truth I I don't want to go through all my life trying learning and not knowing him it's scary 1 Peter 1 verse 22 says seen ye have purified your souls this is how you do it you want your soul purified how many wants your soul purified listen to this scripture seeing you purified your souls how in obeying the word you simply take Serious the word that's preached to you and you say I want to do that and you start doing it amen and you don't know where to start but you go home and you dedicate yourself to spending 20 minutes a day in prayer just start with that open your Bible and say God open my eyes to see you because obviously I'm not seeing you the way I need to and when God says something to you start obeying it and automatically your soul will become more purified through the Holy Spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren see that you love one another with a pure heart I don't want anybody loving me with an unpure heart you know it just feels ugly but a pure heart fervently being born again not of a corruptible seed but Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever it's the only thing that can change I mean the word is going to be there when the dust all settles Revelation Armageddon is all over with who's going to be standing there the word of God is going to be standing there that's why they said to brother Brandon when the bombs fa fall where do you want to be would you want to be in the bomb shelter you want to be in heaven he says no no no I want to be in a bomb shelter and I only want to be in heaven because heaven and Earth's going to pass away say I want to be in the word I want to be clothed with the word I want to be the word that don't happen unless there's a love relationship God is not going to force himself he's not going to force the word in us we've got to develop a love for the word and in order for that to De you've got to deny the flesh who doesn't love the word amen there's the battle Paul was taught the things of God by Gia who is one of the most noble teachers of his day right amen I'm told that he was the first Paul was the first designated uh Rabin a title that indicated greater knowledge of the scriptures than a rabbi so he was up there he he was up there but this is what Paul said you know I usually don't get um you know warm you know what that means Philippians 3:5 so he was way up there but this is what and he's given his credentials some of his credentials here he was circumcised the eth day the stock of Israel The Tribe of Benjamin a Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the law of Pharisee concerning Zeal he persecuted the church touching the righteousness which was in the law he was blameless When anybody looked at this man they said yes he's going to be our next president we want him to lead us he's the one that we know he knows the way to God and he was talking to King Agrippa in Acts chapter 26:5 and they which knew Paul from the beginning could testify that after the most strictest sect of religion he lived a Pharisee and many of the Saints did he said I shut up in the prison you talk about the doors closing somebody coming in here Paul was one of those guys who went into the church dragged him out killed them that's the truth many of the saints that I shut up in prisons having received Authority from the chief priest and when they were put to death I gave my voice against them he he was guilty of killing the Christians and I punish them often in the synagogues and compel them to blaspheme trying to get them to say something against God against the Holy Ghost and be can you imagine can you imagine anybody trying to do good and somebody comes by and says that's not really necessary you know they don't have to take a you know Pitchfork or a gun but just Ah that's not necessary you know that's the same thing as a gun it's the same Spirit compel them to blaspheming being exceeding mad against them I persecuted them even unto strange cities all this happened because Paul was blind even though he was taught by the best amen given papers go carry out this great thing for your religion he was literally blind from knowing god but he could tell you everything that happened with the children of Israel when they came out when they came out of Egypt he could tell you what happened but he was blind to spiritually what was happening yes spiritually blind to seeing all the truth it was wasn't until Paul met Jesus Christ in the spiritual realm yes what's important here is you're you're hearing words spoken you're hearing the the Bible preached but until you get into that spiritual realm where you hear from God the eyes are not going to come open naturally I'm sorry you can't go to a seminary you can't go to a a teaching you can't even put on a tape and intellectually try to receive from God it just doesn't work you've got to enter into the spiritual realm because God is a spirit and they that worship me must worship me in spirit and in truth that's where you're going to meet God right it wasn't until Paul had a supernatural experience where did he have that experience brother around he had it in his heart yes we look at it yeah he got kicked off his high horse there was a light came he fell down he became blind that all happened but you know what that could have happened and could have got on his horse like all the other men did that didn't change right the natural thing happened but what really happened to Paul is something happened inside of his heart amen that made him say who art thou Lord in other words I thought I knew you but I really didn't and and Jesus said I'm Jesus who you persecuted why you doing what you're doing why aren't you trying to do the right thing I'm telling you over and over and over what's it going to take for you to get your heart right Paul tapped into the secret to seen what did he do he humbled himself the time to humble yourself is when really all time is a good time to humble yourself but I'm telling you when God got your attention and you got kicked off your horse that is the time to submit to God humble yourself he was no more wise and prudent in his own eyes his spiritual eyes came open and he saw Jesus Christ for the first time now he didn't see him with these eyes like the other Apostles he saw he saw Jesus with these eyes right here and I believe this morning we can see Jes Jesus with those same eyes because he's here he's here you brought him he's the word declares that he's here he said I'll never leave you I'll never forsake you I'll be with you even in you to the end we can't deny that God is here but what we need to do is humble ourselves to him there was no doubt about his experience in Philippians chapter 3:8 he says yay doubtless there's no more doubt I and I count all things but loss for the Excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've suffered the loss of all things and I do count them but dung that I might win Christ now this to me is really the example for every Christian Paul counted the cost what it would take for him to finish his course that he couldn't really find Christ if he hung on to some of the things that the devil gave him you know the devil he loves to fill your head with knowledge he wants to Puff you up with knowledge and he actually had to get rid of all of it amen in order to win Christ to win everything this is the secret to seeing all that Christ is in US is count all things lost be willing to look at your life and say is there things that I'm hanging on to that I need to give up amen I'm going start amen I'm going to start Amen in my own word count everything in your life as useless just to get Christ remember that you can't get Christ with only given part of your heart if there's a revelation that we could really use in this Century that we're in is that one we need to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt Us in due season and that's exactly what God did to Paul he got his attention but he had to make the choice free more agency in his heart to Humble himself under the mighty hand of God and then he exalted him in due season it's truly the example for every one of us every day in our life amen Luke 14: 28 Jesus speaking here in Luke 14:28 he says for which of you intend to build a tower sth not down first and cth the cost whether he have sufficient to finish it less happily after he had laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it began to what mock him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish when I was a boy I lived on a Norway Drive no Birch no Norway Drive I'm sorry I lived in Norway I had to turn on Birch to get to Norway Drive and there was a house right on the corner of M59 and Birch Road that a man had built and for all the time that I was going through school it just seemed like the the thing never got built you know like he started it but he couldn't finish it and I never got any good thoughts about it I never got any good thoughts like well that's wonderful what a good job he finished no my thoughts were he wasn't able to finish amen it's all the same thing here on us23 just passed ter Road up there for a long time a house just left you look at somebody who does isn't committed to Christ and they're not willing to finish their building too many people start out and say I want to be saved but they don't sit down first and seriously consider the cost are they they willing to walk with Christ the rest of their life or they just have this somehow mentality if I Repent I get baptized I'm saved and you know once saved always saved and that's really all that matters with my life God is not going to look at you like that that's why it's important to really know who God is you know too many people are just they've laid the foundation of repentance baptism but they don't have sufficient love to finish the course to get the character of Jesus Christ inside of them am to come to the Statue of a perfect man amen the cost is all your heart love the Lord thy God with all th heart not 5% not even [Music] 90% it's a serious thing the Bible talks about to stand before that Pillar of Fire it's a how's the scripture say it's a our God is a consuming fire it's a fearful thing we got to give an account one day I'll take a look at our how how is anybody here under 13 two do you know um right now uh you you two have made a lot of mistakes I put you in the same category as Emma and uh amariah they've made a lot of mistakes they they I'm sure that your parents at one time or another have not been happy with you so as a child we do things that we shouldn't do but yet God looks at us as it's okay because they're not at the age of accountability but soon as we turn whatever that age is it's not exactly 1 I'm just going to say that for now but maybe it is every I think it might be different a little bit for everybody but there comes a time where god holds us accountable for the things that we did amen we got to make sure that we're willing to give our All to Jesus Paul had to sell out everything to win Christ and if he had to we have to too many people who confess Christ only want to give as little as possible Right amen but think about this that person really is not saying I want a love AFF with you because A Love Affair means if God asks you to sell out you will sell out but if you don't want to sell out what you're really saying is I don't want this strong love affair with you and I'm telling you that is the secret to knowing god is a love affair with him now I remember when I was in the world I remember being your ages you young ones I remember the terrible things I did see your memory can also be used for the bad brother Marty I I I remember the songs that we used to listen to that we used to dance to that we used to smoke to that we used to drink to there came a time a a decision had to be made in my life when God called me and I remember the battle going on it was a fearful thing I wasn't brought up in the truth I was brought up in Catholicism which you know pretty much you could do whatever you want and you're still saved live any kind of life you want I went to a funeral my neighbor funeral one time oh they they dressed them up in a suit he cussed swear did everything that had a cigar in his mouth I mean people are thinking a certain way as it's truth but it's not they can't see clearly you just have to make the decision to be all in for Christ you make that decision you don't have to sit there and make a decision every time about doing it you just do it once and you're it's over it's done you just serve the Lord every thought that comes in your head you you you put it towards serving God too many people who confess Christ only they want to get very little you've got to give everything to God you got to have sufficient love sufficient oil you got to have a sufficiency to make it remember the five foolish virgins they didn't have sufficient oil they had an attitude well I can make it without it or I have enough you can't you need all of God I believe God sent the message in this hour to get us more filled up amen we can't not make it without this message in this hour people don't like hearing that because they're they're they're they're living in a past age right they're living in a a past age but to whom much is given much is required and if God sent a message in this hour we got to walk in the light as he's in the light and all that God has just given us opportunity people that want to believe that that's fine that's up to them but for me in my house I'll serve the Lord but it's important for you your vessel you're the house of God you get a people in your own home you know Jesus said people of your own household will be your enemy that's exactly what he said but you know you can still stand and say for me in my house I'll serve the Lord amen we all want to wish everybody's going to be saved and everybody's going to come in and everybody's going to serve we and everybody's going to go on the Rapture but you know we'd have to throw out part of the message we'd have to throw out the other two Believers we'd have to throw up part of the Bible we'd have to throw up the parable of the 10 virgins and the reality is this message this ministry is to get a bride ready from this church that's what it's for it's not for anything else it's not it's not for anything else brother brandham said in time tested Memorials of God he says when you come to Christ if you can't absolutely sell out Lock Stock and Barrel and come to Christ he said don't come at all he's saying it like it is but when you really want to be a Christian Stand Out make it real that's what God wants you to be he says that will prove your Works will prove what your character is I want think about that your Works how you live how you act is going to prove what spirit is inside of you what character you have you know God's coming back for character right he says your character is known by The Works that you do not by the words that you say not by what you confess with your mouth amen it's easy for me to say I love you brother the Ron and hate you in my heart it's easy to do that because I'm I'm good at saying I love you as long as I say it how about don't say it but show it how about that there's that's what Jesus had for us he didn't just say it he lived it amen your character is known by how much you love God his word god hides himself from certain individuals who refuse to deny their own Pride look at all the other men that were with Paul they were all they all fell off their high horse they all heard a voice but saw no man the Bible says right but they weren't standing with Paul it was only Paul that was before King agria there lays the secret to possessing all the truth is humble yourself before the Lord Philippians 3:9 and be found in him not having my own righteousness which is of the law but that which is which is through the Faith of Christ that's God revealing himself to you remember Paul said I uh I Live Now by the faith of the son of man it's not living by our faith but he speaks the word to us that's the Faith of Christ through the Faith of Christ the righteousness which is of god by faith that I might know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death see here's Paul 33 years later after that experience on the road to Damascus when he gave his heart to God he's still acting like a babe he's still saying oh that I might know you Lord I don't know you yeah most people I wrote WR 14 books of the Bible and I know so much and you better listen to me now he didn't have that Spirit he had the spirit of oh that I might know him and he goes as far as saying this I'm going to know God in the power of his resurrection then I'm going to have to come to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings he had to be willing to Humble himself to suffer to put him down put himself so low that God could be exalted in him that's the key amen you know people want a gospel we could just come and we hear the word and that should be good enough they don't want to get underneath the word amen you got to get underneath the word Lord pour it in my heart it's the secret to knowing Christ die out to self if by any means I might attain unto the resurrection C of the Dead look at the secret to see seeing more of God here verse 12 not as though I already attained he he wasn't a know at all either were already perfect in other words he wasn't saying that he was better than others he says but I follow after if I may apprehend that which also I'm apprehended of Jesus Christ Brethren I count not myself to have apprehended but this one thing I do I do it I do it I live it I don't think it I live it forget those things which are behind and reach forth unto those things which are before I want to become more like Jesus he said I press towards the mark there's a prize of the High Calling God is calling us higher than anybody else we've been chosen to be his bride not servants not foolish virgins but a bride amen I'll tell you if there's anything that we need to believe of oursel we need to believe that we're the bride and hold ourselves accountable to the message that God sent for his bride amen because he didn't send that message for the foolish virgin he did not send it for the foolish virgin is it get us ready I press towards the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus you see I got notes Here Right got lots of notes I'm just trying to like forar you this could be I'm glad today Sunday turn with me if you would to Luke chapter 24 just kind of follow along with me I'll try to go througho fast here's two disciples that were walking with Jesus Jesus was right next to them the reason I want to get into this is I think a lot of times we don't recognize that Jesus is right here next to us in church verse 15 says and it came to pass that while they communed together and reason Jesus himself Drew near and went with them I believe that Jesus is here I think I believe that Jesus Jesus is happy that we're that we're wanting to lift him up and wanting he that that words are being spoken to his bride the secrets to knowing more about God like he wants we we hear the statement that brother Bri want brother bran said that God wants to give us the the Holy Ghost more than what we want so much that if you put pressure in in a at a tube one mile high foreign diameter there' be so much pressure at the bottom of it that is nothing compared to all the pressure that God wants to give us the Holy Ghost right but do we want it enough so I believe that what God is really looking for in the response to the word that's being ministered today is that he's looking for a hunger for to to want to know him more verse 16 but their eyes were Holden that they should not know him notice that their eyes were Holden I wonder why I wonder why eyes are Holden and he said unto them what manner of communications are these that one that you have one with another as as you walk and are sad remember he came to uh God came to um um Adam and Eve had two sons Cain and Abel so Cain God came to Cain and his countenance was sad as well and he tried to minister to him why you sad you you shouldn't be in this condition you have a free mow agency you have a choice to make you do the right thing and you're you're in you do the wrong thing sin lies at the door after that is death right we all have that same choice so Jesus was walking with two of his disciples and they didn't even know Jesus was with them wow what a paradox and Copus asked Jesus art thou only a stranger in Jerusalem and has not known the things which are come to pass in these days and he said what things and they said unto him concerning Jesus of Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty in deed and word before God and all the people and how the chief priest and the rulers delivered him to be condemned to death and have crucified him but we trusted but we trusted in other words it wasn't we trust it's I we trusted passed we trusted that it had been he which should have redeemed Israel and besides all this today is the third day since these things have done and certain women also the company made were uh made us astonished uh which were early at the septier and when they found not his body they came saying they had also seen a vision of angels which said unto him he's alive and certain of them which were with us went to the septier and found it was as the women had said but him they saw not and after they got done explaining all this you would think that Jesus would just want to go to them and put his arms around them and say come on boys hey come on you know kind of comfort them console them encourage them no he said oh fools he called his own disciples fools th this is like wow oh fools and slow of heart to believe the message of the hour all that the prophets spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter his glory of course because Jesus had told him how many times I'm going to suffer I'm going to raise again the third day he already told them but they did not believe right amen and at the beginning and beginning at Moses and all the prophets he has founded unto them in all the scriptures of the things concerning himself and they drew nine to the Village whether they went and he made as though he was just going to keep on going further but the two disciples had constrained him saying abide with us for it is towards evening and the day is far spent and he went and he carried with them there was just something inside these men that when they heard the word it sounded so much like what they heard before just the way that Jesus had spoke to them and it came to pass as he sat at meat with them he took bread and he blessed it and break it and gave it to them and their eyes were opened and they knew him and immediately he vanished out of their sight how important it is for personally Jesus to break the word to you personally to take this big bread break it off and say Gabe this is for you this is for you Jonathan this is for you Aurora this is for you how important is it for you to be looking God break a piece of bread off for me if not we're just sitting as bystanders church is going on not really recognizing what's happening in the spiritual realm The Secret of seeing is when God breaks the bread of life to you personally personally Upon This Rock I'll build my church in the gates of hell when not Prevail against it we need to become so strong that the devil can't come against us he can't break our life he can't break our home he can't break our church he can't break us because Christ we're built upon the solid rock of Revelation and that isn't going to come just because your name is John Martin you got to hunger you got to thirst you got to get on your knees and say God I need more of you in my life amen John 9:39 Jesus speaking he said for judgment I am come into the world that they which see not might see and they which see might be made blind and some of the Pharisees which were with him heard these words and said unto him are we blind also they were offended at the truth that God had spoke to them and they were just being sarcastic they were being sarcastic they didn't think they were blind they thought they saw just fine it was Jesus that had the problem are we blind also and Jesus said if you were blind you should have no sin but now you say we see Therefore your sin remainest see it's your attitude your attitude is I need more of God praise God your eyes are coming open you say well I don't you know today I'm I'm pretty good you know I'm just going to go home then your sin remain it that's what Jesus is saying brother Braham says we never leave church the same way can you imagine someone getting so far from God that they end up stop coming to church I mean this happens right amen so people end up coming to church they leave church further away from God but they don't realize it they're they're blind to that but eventually they say what why do I even go I don't get nothing out of it where the bride said I can't wait to get there I can't wait for the word there's there's something there's a Jesus is truly going to break a piece of bread off for me this age that we're living in now just so you know I started a little bit later today because I had to you know had to thank everybody I had to sing that one song but we're really not behind schedule I just want you to know that in this age there's a a hideous spirit in leoa and it's a it's an arrogant spirit it's an I don't need you got to say and Jesus says that spirit is identified as being blind they don't even know it amen they're blind and he tells them what your antidote is what the answer is what the secret to being able to see is come by of me gold which we know is only God God is the only gold is the only deity we have to buy God now we can't put money in the back and buy God we can't do a bunch of Works in by God but we can give our heart and soul to him yes right you can give yourself let them come in your heart and put gold in there amen put gold on the outside put gold everywhere and he says that that the uh oil the anointing that comes from me from the deity the oil that comes will anoint your eyes that you may see if we want to see we've got to humble oursel and say God I need you now remember I'm not we're not in a denomination or church that we can identify oh yeah they're in leoa I think there's a lot of message Believers in leod DEA I think there's a lot of people that go to message churches in leod deia they heard a a natural Voice come out and they all they heard was the the the the the leoan church was some denomination but brother Brandon was really saying that was the spirit you got to come out of the spirit amen come out of the spirit of lukewarmness be clothed with deity that the shame of your first nature does not appear this shame of your nakedness the the the the shame of your worldly nature does not appear that needs to be covered we need to be that needs to be gone we need the nature of God God will not accept anything but himself we need the character of God it's the only thing that we're taking with us when we leave do you believe that God hides things God hasn't even told the Angels when he's coming right God had hid from the Devil the deepness of his love to Satan he didn't know he didn't know he knew the law but he didn't know the deepness he didn't know the the fullness of the law he didn't know the deepness think about this Lucifer looked at God as being a god of love because that's what the word identifies him as God is love but the thing is God was able to hide from Satan Calvary he didn't know that when Calvary happened that he was going to lose all those Souls all his hard work that he put in he was going because you know Jesus is just coming back for his own right he's not coming back for anything else amen God has the ability to hide the Deep things but he's revealed them unto us and when his love comes into our heart and swells up that we're able to to to love the way that he loved right to lay down our life the way that he laid down his life to do the end of the of the royal law fulfill the scriptures that when somebody else can't make it your love Picks Them Up and makes it for them that's what Christ did for us that's what the bride does for everybody else amen and that's what he's called us to this is the secret amen of seeing God let's Stand Together God bless you the secret of seeing God is to fall in love with him with all your heart maybe we could sing that same chorus that we were singing before open my eyes Lord amen just let it be your prayer open our eyes Lord we want to see [Music] Jesus to reach out and touch him to say that we love him
