want to thank each and every one of you that's been praying for the new church it uh hasn't been easy and now that we got a deadline and we're going to we've got our services set uh next month for our dedication and um some of you may not know but we're having dedication services next month for maybe three services right brother daryl ward come and we're just gonna dedicate the church dedicate our lives and uh get get uh on the track of the new church amen um but uh through uh the the process we we got rejected in uh one of our our plumbing inspections and uh we did a lot of changes that they asked us to do but one change we didn't do and that was the outside wall that's been existing there it was just a little bit too far from the toilet and so we thought you know it would let go i thought it was enough but i missed it and uh so we're we're building adding on to that wall getting it closer so we can pass inspection and brother stan's been a real trooper uh he made the thing look perfect the hand bars were on everything and then we got to cover it all up took the hand bars off we're gonna cover it up but he's been a real trooper worked with we had a couple hard days yesterday and it's coming along so appreciate your prayers for the new church amen um brother timothy ashong sends his greetings to each of you and a lord willing he'd like to come this year by the end of the year it'd be nice to have a missionary back in the in the u.s amen brother george smith is going to be with us this wednesday and a week from today so let's be in prayer for those services amen we're grateful for what the lord is doing amen let's look to him in a word of prayer before we read his word heavenly father we want to thank you today for grace lord we're all here because of your grace in any facet that we look at it lord whether it's we're alive whether it's our health whether it's the desire to be here lord it's all because of your grace we thank you for grace today lord we pray that you would take our lives at this time and cleanse us and wash us from anything that is unpure that we lower that we not miss anything that you would be speaking to our hearts lord lord did take us out of a carnal mindset and bring us into a spiritual mind to catch your mind catch your thoughts and strengthen us in the inner man lord we commit this service into your hands we commit our our souls into your hands and lord we pray that you would give us now revelation as we look into your precious word and we ask all these things in jesus christ's name amen amen first thessalonians chapter 5 we're just going to read one verse verse 23 and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ amen you may be seated may god bless his precious word to our hearts we want to entitle this the hidden man and it's for a subject talk about preserving the inner man amen now we're taught that man is a triune being whether he's a sinner or a saint he has a body he has a spirit and he has a soul when i was a sinner practicing sin i did my own will it doesn't matter what we did we all had our conversations and times fast and the lust of the flesh the bible says fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and where by nature the children of wrath even as others it doesn't matter what we did we all had one thing in common we did our own will the reason why we need to become born again is because we have a worldly nature that wants to do its own will it isn't because well we smoke joints and did a lot of bad things those are simply attributes of doing her own will and you know brother branham taught us that back in the day they preached staying out of the movie houses and he says the devil pulled a fast one on us and put the movie house right into our home well we that were so against tvs he pulled a fast one on us and put the computer in her home but i'll say it like this he's pulled a fast one upon the church to get the church to believe that they're okay and sit in church hear the word and still do their own will we need to be born again we didn't think much about our own spirit and our own soul at that time when we were in the world what we mostly thought about was how we looked at the outside of one another we call this the body and even though our focus was on our bodies we really were living by the nature of the spirit that was inside of us the lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind that's really what our drive was whenever we whatever we saw with our eyes it just it opened the door for our wanting whatever we uh touched with our hands and opened the door for wanting whatever we heard whatever music we heard it opened the door for us wanting because we functioned by the nature of the spirit that we were born with we were not taught any of those things that's right that's right everyone was like this we thought it was normal we thought we weren't bad and all we had to do to prove it was to look at somebody who did worse things than us and that was our proof that we weren't bad we never knew that all people were bad right jesus said ross all sinners there wasn't one righteous the one thing that was in common we did our own will amen simply no one was interested in forfeiting their will to do god's when that ever came across our life we just said no thank you weren't interested until one day god sent somebody our way to tell us what it meant to be born again amen what it meant to be born again and if that person spent some time seeking what it really meant that when a man is born again he has been born to do the will of god not just stop doing these things not just start going to a church not just say he's in the message but to stop doing his will and to do the will of god therefore he must live by the will of god in his body and in his spirit and in his soul and when we're in one another's presence we often view one another by the shell by the body you know we think about somebody what they look like and you know maybe how they they they look outwardly yeah we we don't pay attention too much to the spirit unless it's greatly uh extreme right and then we begin to question what was that we're really not bodies that have a in spirit inside of us we're really as it were spirits that live inside of a body and we kind of we need to look at the inside of one another brother branham when he asked this question he said what are you he said you are a soul [Music] so we're not a body we're a soul living inside of a body that's the hidden man this is the man that we should be more concerned about the hidden man or the inner man inside amen i want to talk about this man today and we want to try to encourage this man because we're living in such a sinful world or commanded by jesus to be ready in the very hour that we're living at turn with me if you would to matthew 24. the inner man must take heed to the hour that we're living him matthew 24 i'm going to start with 40 42 matthew 24 verse 42 watch therefore for ye know not what our the your lord dot come your lord i like that but know this that if the good man the house had known what watched the thief were to come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you don't think the son of man is coming who then is a faithful and a wise servant whom his lord have made and rule over his household to give him meat in due season that's our responsibility to feed the inner man it's our responsibility to feed the inner man it is not the preachers it's true amen we ain't gonna make it by one or two services a week or a month or how often we come we've got to feed the inner man on a daily basis [Music] blessed is that servant whom his lord when he cometh shall find so doing verily i say unto you that he shall make him ruler over his house of good all his goods but if that evil servant shall see in his heart my lord goliath is coming now we're really not even going to say those words but all we're going to do is believe the thought in other words i don't really think he's coming tomorrow so don't worry about it god looks at a person like that as an evil servant and shall begin to smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with the drunken now i want to take it like this nobody's going to hit one another but i tell you what we are going to do is ignore to wash one another's feet that's the same thing ignore to help somebody and just to eat and drink this is kind of what they did in the days of no one the days of a lot just eating and drinking just going on with life the lord of that servant shall come in a day when he look looketh not for him in an hour that he is not aware of him and shall cut him asunder with and appoint him his portion with the hypocrites this will be weeping and esching of teeth imagine that this person who's not getting ready gets placed right next to the hypocrite they're like twins when it comes to god think about what i'm saying how important it is to recognize the hour we're living in and to get ready for his coming year it's back up to verse 36 now but of that day in that hour it knoweth no man no not even the angels of heaven but my father only but as the days of noah were so shall the coming of the son of man be for as in for as in the days that were before the flood they were eating and drinking and marrying and given into marriage until the day that noah entered into the ark and they knew not until the flood came and took them all away so shall be also the co uh so shall also the coming of the son of man be see the same type of scenario is going on they're just going on with life ignoring the signs of the time yes sir that's right then shall two be now this one i want to get to there shall be two in the field there shall be two in the field and one shall be taken and the other left the two women shall be grinding at the mill and one shall be taken the other left so you've got two outside bodies they look identical they're working going on with life but one is taken one is not because one of the souls was ready to go took heed to what was being said now the outside they still had the work they sort of take still to fix the tires still to paint the house still did what they did but the inside man if that man is ready he's going that's the man we're interested in on the outside both are church goers the believer and the doubter see the doubter believed that god is real that he is god but he didn't believe he was coming soon so there was not a need to spend time getting ready they were working together the believer that believes he could come any minute and believes it so much that he gets ready where the doubter that believes that he could come any moment but doesn't believe it enough to get ready catch that ask anybody you think god could come in oh yeah yeah do you believe it enough to get ready there's the doubter the doubter believes like the devil believes the devil of the devil believes enough to know it's true but not enough to repent and submit [Music] but the believer believes it enough and stays zealous enough to keep submitting to the word as is being preached over the pulpit because it's that word that's getting them ready it's not we're not here to preach the same message we heard 10 20 30 years ago that you know jesus is our savior and if you believe in him you're going to go on the rapture i'm sorry that's not the message we've been hearing all along what god wants us to do to get ready if we miss it it's because we never believed it enough to be serious enough to start doing it that's right amen god is looking for faithfulness if you notice that's the truth that's what we need to do here in this church is be zealous with the word that's being preached submit to it so both outside men do the same thing right you can't tell them apart on the outside but god is looking at the hidden man he's looking at the hidden man as the taste buds of a person's mouth are all different so are the taste buds of the hidden man right we all sit down well go to the restaurant we're all going to order now everybody's going to order somebody different there will be some people that order the things that are like i ordered the good things that are our hidden man they feed just like our taste buds right since everybody's got different taste buds if our hidden man feeds on the same things that the doubters feed upon it will weaken herself when the state of mind of the hidden man is weakened to doubting he's always looking for proof to substantiate his doubts and to justify the way that he's thinking people are always trying to prove how right they are instead of seriously being ready about his coming yes like who cares about how right we are let's care about getting ready that's one thing we should all agree on i don't really care if everybody's greater than me i don't care it just doesn't do anything for me but if i can help somebody get ready oh wow i just love the lord that much that i want to help somebody now if our hidden man feeds on the things of this world we will become full of anxiety and fear and that fear will weaken us it will weaken our faith and weaken the inside of us the hidden man needs to be aware of what the devil is doing and fight with faith in the word of god turn with me if you went to luke chapter 21 i don't think there's ever been a time on the planet that there has been so much anxiety fear on the world that there is today we are all hoping that this thing would just come and pass and that we would go on with our life luke 21 verse 25 and there shall be signs in the sun and in the moon and the stars and upon the earth distress of nation distress of nation with perplexity that's uncertainty the seas and the waves roaring tell you there's been lots of hurricanes isn't there distress of nations now what that means is great pain anxiety sorrow acute physical or mental suffering tell me the nations are not feeling that it means affliction in trouble it's a state of extreme necessity or misfortune never a time on the planet as today and look what it's causing verse 26 man's hearts are failing them for fear the inner man is failing because of fear why for looking and for looking after those things which are yet to come on the earth that's what's bringing more anxiety and more fear this thing doesn't seem to be passing mutate mutate mutate mutate the bible says for the powers of heaven shall be shaken god is in control regardless regardless he's in control and then shall they say the son eventually they see the son of man come in a cloud with power and great glory and these things when these things shall begin to come to pass then look up that's our job to look up lift up your heads for your redemption draweth nigh i've never witnessed before in any time of my life nor reading history where the whole world has so much pressure as it does today the more that people look after the things which are coming upon the earth the more that their hearts are failing for fear where if they kept their eyes on the word they kept their eyes on the promise they kept their eyes on the message they kept their eyes on jesus god would keep them in perfect peace because their heart is stayed on the lord matthew chapter 10 verse 28 matthew chapter 10 verse 28 and fear not them which kill the body that's the outer man but they're not able to kill the soul that's the hidden man but rather fear him you've still got to fear but rather fear him which is able to destroy both soul and body in hell we have to fear we're going to fear you're going to fear wondering that every single person in here is going to fear one or the other i mean i used to fear getting a for my daddy because when he gave me one you know you got one luke chapter 21 verse 34 luke 21 34 and take heed to yourselves take heed to yourselves lest any time your hearts be overcharged with surfeiting and drunkenness and the cares of this life and so that they come upon you unaware don't get sucked up in such a busy life that you become overcharged overcharged like there's no control right you lose control of your yourself your soul your inner man you may you may be trying to keep control the outer man but anything to do with this outer life it doesn't matter it's going down no matter how much you try to preserve it it's the inner man for as a snare shall it come upon all them that dwell upon the face of the earth tell me we're not in the middle of this it's a snare no one expected this thing and it just keeps going deeper and deeper you just see the claws of satan digging into humanity and trying to bring more confusion more destruction more fear he's just feasting and bringing fear to the people watching therefore and pray always that you may be accounted worthy to escape all these things that shall come to pass and stand before the son of man jesus said that prayer opens the door to escaping all things prayer so don't cut pear out do not cut it out start doubling it amen amen that's right don't think the devil is going to tell you got this don't worry you don't have to pray that's a lie pray without ceasing pray with all perseverance ask seek not pray always it's true prayer that the hidden man doesn't faint right they that wait upon the lord they shall renew their strength now god doesn't want us to fall into this trap of fear now one iota fear is of the devil now there are two types of fear one is reverence and respect to god the other is to be manipulated into believing something frightening or horrifying that's the john martin version the dictionary tells us that fear is a distressing emotion think about this think about what the devil's doing a distressing emotion around aroused by impeding danger or evil or pain every time we get some sort of pain we got a cancerous tumor every time we look something up on google it's telling us the worst condition that we got fear just wants to set in a distressing emotion that arises when there's danger he says now the dictionary says whether the threat is real or imagined it is a feeling or condition of being afraid god does not want us afraid you have no right to be afraid to fear the lord is to respect him to reverence his word when he gives it to you and it's by freemore agency that you humbly submit to it now that's what the fear of the lord is we're taught that it's the beginning of all wisdom now to fear the devil is to show respect to what the devil tells us oh really wow that's you fearing the devil that's you respecting the devil now can you imagine we respect the devil we do it's true we do soon as fear capsizes you you're listening to what the devil says you're giving audience you're giving attention you're given respect as if he's got something good to say he's a liar i don't care what proof he's got he's still a liar he always will be a liar amen to fear the devil is to show respect to what the devil tells us and to allow ourselves to become manipulated or aroused by an impeding danger he loves shona's danger the whole world feeds on news that's bad put on any station you want hey we got this good thing oh nobody wants to hear that go over here to this other town and talk about something bad that's happening there people want to hear about that when we show respect to what the devil tells us we're lacking love for what god says yep is it true i'm saying to you when we pay attention to what the devil is saying it is the beginning of worldly wisdom it's where strife confusion all begins is when you listen to the devil and it is the beginning of worldly wisdom and you got to handle everything yourself don't respect what the devil tells you don't listen to what the devil tells you well i think it's god he's warning me god's telling you to get in his word and believe his word that's what he's telling you we might say as brother marty says we're actually insulting god in his ability to see us through a situation the devil is allowed to talk to us but remember we have a choice in if we're going to listen or respect what he's got to say god is not going to take the devil but we got to take sides who we're going to respect we're going to listen and respect one or the other luke chapter 12 verse 4 luke chapter 12 verse 4 and i say unto you my friends jesus is always talking to his friends here he said be not afraid of them that kill the body and after have no more that they can do nothing don't fear he says friend don't fear them so i say don't listen to that news but there's proof my neighbor said this don't respect them i mean i understand it's good to know colvin's out there i understand that you know we need to be careful and that we need to be extremely prayerful about what we do but there ain't one other person out there that you can listen to and they tell you exactly all the facts that is gospel but everybody wants to say what they think it is i just say we know enough to be prayerful but we need to start putting our attention onto god god you know the devil wants everybody to be prophesying tell when the end of the world is and to tell what's going to happen before it happens and what day it's going to happen but make it clear jesus said not even the angels in heaven no don't figure it out focus on getting ready and staying ready on a daily basis you know somebody can come to the altar and get serious with god three days later they even forget what they did over here at the altar it's about remaining ready day after day service after service week after week a christian is not what we think it is it is what it is we need to find that out verse 5 but i will forewarn you whom you shall fear he wants you to fear one or the other and he's telling us who we need to fear fear him which is able ah which after he have killed have power to cast into hell yeah i'll say unto you fear him and there's only one that can do that that's jesus christ he holds the keys of hell death and the grave amen that's the one we need to fear we need to pay attention to what he wants yes so take half of your time that you spend thinking about the things of this world and start spending it i'm thinking about this word and what god's trying to say to us just 50 let's start with that [Music] i don't guarantee that your your hearts will be in perfect peace at that time i don't because that's not scripture the scripture says he'll keep the imperfect peace whose mind is stayed one hundred percent on the lord but i'll tell you you can't get there you know overnight right so start with fifty percent still look at that news 100 get 50 get in that word god does not want us to fear or be tormented by anything that's happening in our lives not just around us but in our lives god is still in control he's still on the throne he's still got the final say-so everything is working out for our good i believe he's going to see the bride through all we got to do is trust we are the bride amen and then stay with that jesus said in luke 12 32 fear not little flock for it is your father's good pleasure to give you the fullness of the holy ghost it's what the kingdom is fear not i'll tell you if if you've got god inside of you you know god is not worried about what's going on he's not grabbing his archangels and say we need to have a meeting here he knew all this was going to happen before man was ever created god is providing a way for his bride and it will not be outside of the word it won't be in our own thinking and the way we figure things out in our special place to get the information and what's going on in our homes i'm sorry it'll be according to his word his word means everything to the pride that's why when we come to the house of god there needs to be such a hunger for the living word don't fear don't let fear in the door of your heart don't let fear in the hidden man it's allowed to come in it's allowed to do that but it stops here i'm not opening to it i don't care what the devil says i don't care what anybody's going to say about me i don't care i'm going to be like jonah i'm not going to sit there no matter how real it is and observe live vanities i don't want to forsake my own mercies god's going to keep us amen sometimes we can become so carnal that we miss the hidden man not paying attention to the inside the devil can get us so caught up on external things that we don't even think about the inside because the devil we've we've taken that lure that uh laodicea lukewarm lure that says you're okay because you're okay because well if you're okay because then what do we need to be doing anything else for the only way that we're okay is by the grace of god that's the only way we could be okay but i still have to fear the lord i still have to respect his word i still have to be zealous and repent and get prepared and stay prepared and keep praying and praying and seeking more of the holy ghost that's what it means to fear the lord if we're not careful we can bite and devour one another we can fight for our reputation who's the greatest among us and i'm better because of this we can allow envying and strife and divisions and paul said are ye not carnal not thinking about the inner man just worried about the outside man are you not carnal and walk as men when we don't get what we want it's easy to distrust the lord it's easy to lose your trust in god when you don't get what you want and fear opens the door to be carnal and try to manipulate situations and manipulate people and and manipulate so you can control and get what you want but our hidden man needs to trust the lord when our outer men don't get what it wants turn with me the first peter chapter 3 do not open the door to fear first peter chapter 3 verse 1. now likewise your wife's i just want to say this is for all the men here because i want you to think spiritually likewise you wise be subject to your own husband men who is your husband christ church who is your husband jesus christ just go with me with this and if any obey not the word they also may without the word be won by the conversation of the wives we don't have to preach to win a soul we don't have to preach to be an influence it's the hidden man that does all the work the flesh is out of the picture verse 2 while they behold your chaste behavior coupled with fear not the fear of the world right right not what's oh not that but i trust him they behold that they behold that i could be wrong about the way that i see things the will of god be done oh glory to god i know that he's going to see us through god has never failed us one time his word is true he's never lied his promises are yea and amen and that's what the bride's behavior should be her conversation should be amen who's adorning let it not be the outward man the adorning of the plane the hair and the wearing of gold and the putting on of apparel notice it's not about your outside it's not about you making this thing of how great you are not just dressing or putting your hair in such a way of how great you are but it's the inner man it's the inner man that in any moment time is displaying her trust in it god doesn't matter the outside doesn't matter the quicker we can lose our reputation the closer you're going to get to god jesus made himself of no reputation if he didn't who are we to who are we to even care about it so forget about oh look at me listen to what i got to say what i have to say is more important than you we get stuck in that that's true right the outside man what about the inner man what about being able to go through a test or a trial to have somebody slap you on the face and you just stand there turn the other cheek what about that that's the inner man that's what attracts people my wisdom don't attract people my knowledge don't attract people my abilities don't attract people i'm talking about to give their hearts to jesus christ carnal attracts carnal flesh attracts flesh but it takes the spiritual that attracts the spiritual and i'm saying spiritual i mean in christ amen but let it be the hidden man of the heart i love that verse four here we are saints but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptable even the ornament of a meek and quiet spirit which is in the sight of god of great price out of our hearts hangs a spirit it's like an ornament like you would put on a christmas tree an ornament it hangs there and your spirit is hanging there but sometimes it's just loud it wants to be first it wants to it wants to be carnal true that's right and i'm telling you that ornament is either shining a light that i trust him or shining a darkness that i'm afraid and i'm respecting what the devil has got to say to me [Music] and because i fear this this is what i think we should do because obviously i just don't feel god's got control right now it's the hidden man of the heart we need to make sure that our spirit is christlike that what's coming out of us is christ-light it's mild it's gentle it's humble that's the ornament that we need to have jesus said learn of me he wasn't just talking to the women learning me from me i'm humble unlowly and he dwells with the same for after this manner in the old time the holy women also notice who trusted in god they feared god they didn't fear what was happening they trusted god they adorned themselves being in subjection onto their own husband no doubt if we can't be subject to our husband we can't be subject to god but a woman we've been taught in the bible always represents the church now church we need to trust our heavenly father and you do that by being subject to the word fearing the word that's being preached to you reverencing listening to it wanting to hear too no not the way i see things don't deviate from it believe it obey it start following it mourn hold on every word you song hold to god's unchanging hand that's his word that's how you hang on to god you hang on his word come to church to hear from god amen not to hear what you what brother john's got to say about god it's not a denomination the word the word brother man said the pastor's ordained lead g3 i'm going to say this the word is ordained to see you through it's the word it needs to be our life we need to fear that word reverence that word god's speaking to me to fear him today to reverence him today to not listen anymore to what the devil is saying amen amen because you can't go in both directions you can't serve both even as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord whose daughters ye are and i said there's a period there but there's not there's a comma as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement think about that the big two letters ah as long as you do well and not afraid with any amazement can you imagine sarah for 25 years beating up abraham say if god was really with you we would have had a baby a long time ago she couldn't explain it no more than he could but she trusted she trusted church we have to trust we're children of abraham we are the sarah to our uh to our father in the faith jesus christ trust him amen god doesn't want us to be wishy-washy fear the lord and you'll prosper in god don't allow impeding danger evil or pain to distress you amen it's true don't allow the news to arouse your emotions whether they're a threat or real or imagined don't allow your feelings to stay afraid take your eyes off of jesus or take your eyes off the devil and put them on jesus look to the author look to the finisher of your faith that's her job verse 7 likewise your husbands dwell with them according to knowledge giving honor unto the wife is unto the weaker vessel and as being heirs together the grace of life that your prayers be not hindered if you ever feel brothers that your your prayers are being hindered i say this honor your wife more come on i want to hear an amen it's a truth amen god wants us to honor our wives i'll say like this more than we do live and dwell with them according to more wisdom and more knowledge i believe that jesus christ honors his wife he honors us he would not withhold any good thing amen his promises are in amen he honors her he said with life with mercy his mercies are new every day we need to honor our wives as christ honors his wife amen amen now we're in a battle fear and faith a raging war one against another we're in the greatest man of our fault we've learned that we need to invert our thinking invert always invert think differently about what's happening in the battle that it's really all this thing's working out for our good now we're going to be in this battle till we get out of here bottom line is we need to overcome the battle because that's where we get the character and it is god's business if he wants to see character we're going to need character if we're going to reign with him that's all there is to it well i'm not interested in that brother john i just want to make sure that i'm saved that i'm there we got to be fit to rule if i can't rule my soul if i can't rule my home if i can't help my brother and sister and wash their feet how am i going to be fit to rule with him well somehow he just you know i don't believe in magic character comes as a gift i believe right here when we're going through the battle is what we prove what we have now faith fights fear fear fights faith and the devil is using this world to fight our faith we're not getting away from this battle and one of these is going to win every human being first thessalonians chapter 6 no first timothy chapter 6 verse 9. first timothy chapter 6 verse 9 you know when i say that i expect you know pages just start flipping and there's like dead quiet i'm thinking did i miss something but they that be will be rich they that will be rich in other words they're not rich but they want to be rich fall into temptation and a snare and into many foolish and hurtful desires and what happens to them which drown men in destruction and perdition now i'm telling you this is the inner man in other words the outer man can be so full of want and work so hard for for the outside that the inner man just this doesn't exist no joy no pull no desire no i can't wait to get the church it says i can't wait to church is over amen for the love of money it's the very thing that you don't see right it's the root of all evil you don't even see it it's not out here because it's in the root for the level of money is the root of all evil which while some covet after they have aired what they air from the faith they've erred from the faith and pierced themselves through not with a little bitty thing but with many sorrows yes sir because my want is never satisfied amen i got a million i want two if i got two i want three i got three i want five hey let's not why don't we just go for ten right it just doesn't stop it's never satisfied with seeing never satisfied with hearing it's just not satisfied you can't satisfy this thing amen lucifer who is the cream of the crop of lust yes and getting what he wants has power over everything except god and he's still not satisfied amen and he's trying to get us to get just a little bit more and after i get this it'll be it i'll be satisfied but thou o man of god flee these things don't get your don't get a taste of it flee it and follow after righteousness godliness faith love patience okay so i don't get to this jesus said impatience possess ye your soul you take possession of that inner man amen through patience meekness fight the good fight of faith lay hold on eternal life wherein to thou call it and have professed a great possession profession before many witnesses so i don't know what it means to you but too many people think they've won the fight no need to fight for anything more than what they got and their faith is dwindling it's shrinking because they stopped fighting church we've been called to this battle put on the whole armor of god stand there pray with all perseverance and fight the good fight of faith we should have i'll just say it like this john martin you should have more what than what you possess right now with that being said causes me to fight i say church you should have more than what you have right now and that should cause you to fight laodicean says you're in need of nothing let's just feel good before we leave saddle in lukewarmness every place that the soul of your feet shall tread upon shall be yours if you fight but if you feel god's going to bring it to you on a silver platter he's not going to do that character is not a gift you want the character of jesus christ go after it you're satisfied with just the outward adorning looking right a form of godliness but denying the power of the holy ghost on the inside joshua chapter 1 verse 7 only be thou strong and very courageous that thou mayest observe to do according to say the next word with me ah the law which moses my servant commanded thee turn not from it to the right hand or to the left that thou mayest deserve that thou mayest prosper whether so ever thou goest so if you're going to go to the left you're going to go to the right do all the word keep all the law keep this message in your heart keep this word hidden in your heart keep it with you not just well the main thing you know jesus died for my sins if that's it we're beyond that you need to hear the message that god sent in malachi 4 5. god has more for us verse 8 this book of the law shall not depart out of your mouth but you shall meditate therein day and night if you've ever been come to the church when brother stands there you will not come there without hearing him listen to a message and his testimony to me yesterday was i just feel so much better since i've been listening to the prophet not the things of the world not the news of the world that's what he said that's what his testimony was i'm not making it up he'll tell you the same thing gotta meditate there in day and night find a way to do it that thou mayest observed now here's the reason that you may carry out all that is written therein for them thou shall make thy way prosperous and then now shall have good success have not had commanded you be strong be of good courage be not afraid neither be thou dismayed for the lord thy god is with you whithersoever thou goest it doesn't matter what's happening in the world i'm not going to fear what man shall do unto me not going to do it jude chapter 1 verse 18 time is slipping how that they told you that there should be mockers in the last day who shall walk after their own desires their first nature these be they who separate themselves central having not the spirit remember john said they left us because they were not of us bind us together lord bind us together the devil will love nothing to do than to separate you from the body but ye beloved building up yourselves on the most holy faith praying in the holy ghost that's what we need for this battle is to build ourselves up in the most holy faith now i'll tell you when i was building yesterday with brother stan and the day before we were sweating and it was hard we didn't come in there into the church and sit down and say build my faith i want my faith increased if you're going to build something you got to work now what you usually got to work at is getting rid of all the carnality all the doubt all of your worldly nature because they can't coexist effectively effectively there's going to be people who mock you who walk after their first nature who don't have the spirit and they want to separate themselves but i'll say it like this keep building yourself up in the most holy faith keep building keep praying in the holy ghost come to church with a purpose i'm not just going to pray before service right because it's church order i come to church i got to get in the spirit amen hold yourself to a higher standard let this word be your light the word of god wherever you're at climb higher wherever you're at fight for more take greater possession put on the whole armor don't be satisfied in laodicea verse 21 keep yourselves in the love of god i can't do that for you i can't keep you in love with god i can't go to your house during the day and tell you what to do with your time all i know is if you feed on the outer man you're going to get discouraged and you're going to expect somebody else to do all the work to pick you up i thought god has called his bride to help others yes you call yourself the bride right you you call yourself spiritual oh you not to be helping somebody come on you've got to keep yourselves in love in love with god it is what preserves the inner man it will preserve you inside if you stay in love if you lose that love relationship you become outside trying to be well this is what i think this is how i feel this is the way i see it this is what i believe it just doesn't matter what matters is is is the love of god pulsating out of you are you laying down your life for others are you winning souls because that's what matters that's right look at verse 22 and some have compassion what do they do with their compassion they make a difference if you're not making a difference i say get more love brother john i just i don't hardly have time can you imagine on the day when we're on the other side we're in front of the lord you know i would have did more but i had this company a trusted tool and you know i had to stay busy over there and you know that's just telling brother stan it seemed like uh when it rains it pours my son went on vacation which he doesn't get the vacation very much and so i was really happy about that and it seemed like things were in order and not much time would be needed for me at the shop but little did i know uh we had kind of like an emergency coming from our customer and here we are we don't have all the cad we don't know if we got all the material have to find ways to get it done so you're putting all this time and effort into getting something ready over the holiday weekend it's gonna happen but there's not an excuse right that's true there's not an excuse i got to get up got to spend time with god got to get ready god got to give got to stay in love with god got to make a difference and others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garment spotted by the flesh let me ask you a question how many hates when you spot your garment as as i get older i spot my garments more what'd you put on your what what's that did you did you did you have something red i tell you when we do something that's not right we've got to hate it so much that we go get clean under the blood and get it behind us amen that's right stay in love with god stay building keep building your faith faith fights fear when timothy was pondering the difficulties of being a real christian he began to question and there was a war raging inside of him timothy was witnessing paul when he was in a dark damp prison and he thought man i don't know if i really want to do this this to me doesn't seem like christianity in second timothy chapter 1 verse 5 this is the time that paul wrote what they think was his last epistle that he ever wrote and he's writing it to timothy before his death he's trying to get timothy to stir up his faith because we have control here to stir our own faith up it's not the preacher i mean the preacher can preach i'm telling you we've had some preachers here to me what i thought preached a perfect message like whoa can anything be preached anything greater or better than that i don't know how many times i've thought that when a minister has come but that in itself is not going to profit me unless i believe it remember the word preached them did not profit them not being mixed with faith i've got to stir my faith and this is what paul was doing from his prison he's got he's trying to help timothy you've got to break through this carnality of just wanting to stay in a lukewarm position in a position of of comfort second timothy chapter one verse five when i call to remembrance look what he does the un he starts talking about the unfeigned faith that is in thee which dwelt first in my grandmother laws and thy mother eunice and i'm persuaded that it's in you also he didn't he wasn't thinking that he was thinking you know what this affliction stuff isn't for me i think i'm just going to take it easy he says worthwhile put you in remembrance that thou stir up the gift of god which is in thee by the putting of on of my hands for god has not given us the spirit of fear but a power and of love and of a sound mind that stuff that you feel when you listen to a bad report remember this it doesn't come from god shut the door and get your mind on something else if you keep the door open fear is going to come in whether it's true whether it's imaginary it don't matter at this point what matters is a manipulated fear from the devil he said be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of the lord nor me and prisoner but be thou a partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of god so here was this wasn't even the bad news of the world this is the bad news that you're gonna you're gonna suffer afflictions if you take a stand for the gospel and it was bothering him he didn't want to partake of that he wanted to be in some administration position you know tell the other apostles to get out there and do the dirty work paul said all that live godly in christ jesus they're going to suffer this it don't matter if you're on the front line or the back line if you're going to live godly somewhere you're going to suffer for because the devil don't like you living godly weren't you i am appointed a preacher an apostle and a teacher of the gentiles now you may not be a preacher an apostle and a teacher but you can be a lot of things for christ you can be a lot of things for christ for the which cause you're going to suffer things i also suffer these things nevertheless i'm not ashamed i'm not ashamed of it for i know whom i have believed and then persuaded that he is able to keep that which i've committed unto him against that day now what did he commit unto him the inner man his soul he committed his soul to him the body hey if i'm going to suffer if i'm going to get mocked if i'm going to get made fun of it doesn't matter he's able to keep my soul amen against that day hold fast the form of sound words which thou has heard from the bible in faith and in and love which is in christ jesus hold fast the form of sound worth can you do that i wonder if we've let things slip like oh it's not a big deal or if you would have held on to it maybe we would have a victory over the devil even the holy ghost was telling paul and bearing witness that bonds and afflictions were going to abide with him in acts chapter 20 verse 24 you don't have to turn there but none of these things move me neither count i my life dear unto myself so that i might finish my course with joy and the ministry which i have received to the lord to testify the gospel of the grace of god now you all got a ministry you all have a ministry how's your ministry going tell me how is it affecting the people do bonds and afflictions are they with you are you being moved uh are you kind of shying away because your life is dear to you why wasn't paul moved because the inside man was full of god and god can't be moved colossians chapter 3 verse 1 if you then be risen with christ how many is risen with christ okay homie's not risen with christ how many is in switzerland you don't think you have to vote if you then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god seek it may start with playing the tape it may start with reading the bible it may start on your knees but you've got to seek the lord amen that's what christians do set your affections on things above and not on things on the earth now there's good instructions for us in this hour when fear is just just multiplying seems by the week by the day in the world for you are dead and your life is hid with christ in god and i want to say this the only way you're going to get your life more hid with christ is to become more dead when christ who is our life shall appear then shall you also appear with him in glory look at here's the instructions how to get hid mortified therefore the members which are upon the earth fornication uncleanness inordinate affection evil concupiscence and covetedness which is idolatry for which things sake the wrath of god cometh upon the children of disobedience now when you begin to mortify or kill off the outer man who just i'm going to be honest with you flesh and blood and inheriting the kingdom it's always going to want oh what was that that came up on my screen let me just look into it mortify it for which things take the wrath of god cometh upon the children of disobedience unwilling to fight the good fight of faith in the which he also walked sometimes and lived in them but now he also put off these things anger wrath malice blasphemy filthy communication out of your mouth in other words preserve the inner man through sanctification amen that's our opening scripture psalms 91 we have to hurry psalms 91 we're almost done oh my i can't believe how time has gone by but this is a good psalms for us to read amen nobody's got to go to work today do you okay psalms 91 verse 1 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty i will say of the lord he is my refuge in my fortress my god in him i'm going to fear i'm going to fear him because i'm dwelling in christ surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the follower from the noise and pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wings shall thou trust his truth his word shall be thy shield and thy buckler thou shall not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyeth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasted that noon day a thousand shall fall if they say outside and ten thousand at their right hand but it shall not come nigh thee only with thine eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked because you have made the lord which is your refuge even the most high your habitation there shall no evil befall thee amen neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all their ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou dash thy foot against the stone now i know you got many reasons to to not trust this scripture but i'm telling you i don't care what you're thinking god has never lied amen well explain this explain this i don't have to explain it i just have to believe it amen thou shall tread upon the lion and out of the young lion and the dragon shall thou under under feet because he has set his love upon me therefore i deliver him set your love upon the lord amen don't be satisfied with where you're at set more on him set your affections on him because if you do the scripture says i will deliver him what will there be to fear i will set them on high because you have known my name amen one more scripture first john chapter 4 verse 16. first john chapter 4 verse 16 and we have known and believed in the love of god in the love god hath to us we have known and we believed the love that god have towards us god is love and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him now can you imagine how many is dwelling in god's love how many believes that you are so full of god's love that's the only thing that comes out of you so how many believes you have just a little bit of love but a lot of times other stuff comes out amen okay so this is where i say this this is where we dig into the love of god this is the reason we seek more of the love of god because there's more for us herein is our love made complete that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this evil world we can be just like him be it onto your faith well brother john i'm not going to believe this scripture until i see you walking perfectly it'll be to your doom it'll be to your danger it's not about me it's about you believing it beyond me there is no fear in love but perfect love it just cast out fear amen because fear has torment remember our definition he that feareth is not made perfect in love our goal is to get more in love with god it will cast out anything the devil throws at us now we love him because he loved us first now god so loved the world but the world does not love god so the love here that he loved us is that we recognize this love we're filled with it the only way i can know god's love is to be filled with it the only way i can know god is to be filled with him i can't know him through human understanding it has to be him inside come on now let's stand together hold fast the form of sound words in faith and love which is in christ jesus hold fast press in the battle to preserve the inner man it won't be preserved on his own the devil is out there trying constantly to get people to leave this word to leave this message to leave the church to leave it's up to you to fight the good fight of faith to lay hold of this word and let god use you to help somebody in the church you know if you spend time helping somebody you won't be so judgmental you really spend your time focusing on helping you'll feel good build yourself up in the most holy faith preserve yourself inside by fighting the good fight of faith don't allow the world to bring you down amen how many desires desires is for your life amen let's look to him in prayer heavenly father we thank you for the holy ghost the real true preserver of our souls lord all of us have been knocked around beaten up and bothered by the news of the world thoughts from the
