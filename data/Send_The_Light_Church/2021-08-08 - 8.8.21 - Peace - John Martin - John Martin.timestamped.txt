[32:19] the fruit of our labors don't come for a
[32:22] while
[32:24] but we just keep pressing on
[32:27] and i just want to say thank you from
[32:28] the bottom of my heart i just feel
[32:31] so incapable of being able to fulfill
[32:34] the will of god
[32:36] for his bride here i've always felt that
[32:39] way
[32:40] and by you praying it just
[32:43] really increases encourages us and gives
[32:46] us faith
[32:48] to believe that god will take what
[32:49] little we have and just meet the needs
[32:52] that would be amongst us
[32:54] amen god bless you turn with me if you
[32:55] would to the book of saint matthew
[32:58] chapter seven
[32:59] we'll have three scripture readings
[33:01] today matthew chapter seven
[33:03] jeremiah chapter 29
[33:06] in psalms 85.
[33:10] you know it's a privilege to hear the
[33:14] gospel
[33:16] brother branham says no man has the
[33:18] right to hear the gospel twice
[33:20] if everyone hasn't heard it once and
[33:23] just think about how many times we've
[33:24] heard the gospel
[33:27] in other words we have a responsibility
[33:31] our candles lit to go light somebody
[33:33] else's
[33:35] and it's the same thing with
[33:40] uh when we get a revelation
[33:43] as mrs bigglesworth said that we have a
[33:45] responsibility with every revelation
[33:48] i think everything that god gives us we
[33:51] now have a revelation
[33:53] we have a responsibility with what god
[33:55] gives us just like the prophet taught us
[33:57] that
[33:57] the gift that god has given us is not
[33:59] for ourselves it's for others
[34:01] and so god is constantly giving us
[34:03] things and that now
[34:05] yes it's to help dress us and get us
[34:07] ready but we also know the obligation
[34:09] to go share that with others and this
[34:11] morning we want to talk about peace and
[34:12] as god gives us peace i believe we have
[34:14] a responsibility
[34:16] to give peace to others to build peace
[34:19] with others
[34:20] to share peace with others and of course
[34:22] it's not ours
[34:24] it's god's to start with right yes amen
[34:28] let's bow in a word of prayer heavenly
[34:30] father we thank you for the
[34:32] this wonderful privilege to be in your
[34:34] presence today and we're still praying
[34:36] for more of your presence that you'd

[34:40] to have a one of our hearts and warm our
[34:42] hearts with your
[34:44] love and your goodness to us lord we're
[34:46] so in debt to you
[34:49] lord we're so needy of you lord we can't
[34:52] minister your word we can't hear your
[34:54] word we can't live your word without you
[34:56] and we pray that
[34:57] you would come and do it all this
[35:00] morning lord as we're looking to the
[35:01] holy
[35:02] ghost lord we pray for your your spirit
[35:05] lord we also pray that lord you'd be
[35:06] with those that are not here this
[35:08] morning
[35:09] for various reasons we asked lord that
[35:11] you'd come
[35:12] to their homes go to their homes go to
[35:14] their places go to their work wherever
[35:16] they would be
[35:17] lord and just mend the bodies mend the
[35:20] minds mend the spirits and
[35:22] lord just encourage and help each one of
[35:24] them we pray
[35:26] lord we ask that you be with those that
[35:27] would be live streaming today lord
[35:30] lord that you would be in their homes
[35:32] and father that the word would become
[35:34] just as real to them
[35:35] there as it is to us here we thank you
[35:38] for this lord now we commit all these
[35:40] things into your hands and ask your
[35:42] blessings
[35:43] on your word today in jesus precious
[35:45] thing we ask
[35:46] amen amen
[35:49] matthew chapter 7 and we're going to
[35:52] read just two verses there verses 22
[35:54] and 23 many will
[35:58] say to me in that day lord lord
[36:01] have we not prophesied in thy name and
[36:04] in thy name cast out devils and in thy
[36:06] name
[36:06] done many wonderful works and then will
[36:09] i profess unto them i never
[36:11] knew you depart from me ye
[36:14] that work iniquity
[36:17] now this group didn't
[36:22] get what they expected
[36:25] they didn't get an expected end they
[36:26] didn't get what they thought they were
[36:28] going to
[36:29] get all because they
[36:32] never knew the true nature of god amen
[36:36] they thought they knew enough but they
[36:38] never knew the true nature
[36:40] of god and how important it is to know
[36:41] more of god that's why we come to church
[36:42] right
[36:43] amen jeremiah chapter 29
[36:48] now this group gets an expected end for
[36:52] verse 11 jeremiah 29 verse 11 for i know
[36:55] the thoughts i think towards you saith
[36:56] the lord thoughts of peace and not of
[36:58] evil
[36:59] to give you an expected end
[37:02] this group knows the true nature of god
[37:05] that's the only way we can get an
[37:06] expected in amen
[37:08] amen and for us this morning this is
[37:10] where we're going to be at in psalms
[37:12] 85 verse 8 psalms 85
[37:16] verse 8.
[37:21] the bible says i will hear what god the
[37:24] lord will speak
[37:26] for he will speak peace unto his people
[37:30] and to his saints but let them not
[37:33] turn again to folly
[37:36] amen god bless you you may be seated
[37:40] wonderful word god has always had
[37:44] thoughts of peace
[37:46] he is the prince of peace we can
[37:49] conclude that a
[37:50] uh a peaceful prince is always looking
[37:54] to make peace with with others
[37:57] and to to maintain it we could say that
[37:59] his his makeup and his
[38:01] nature is peaceful his motives and his
[38:04] objectives
[38:05] are peaceful we could say his end game
[38:08] would be one of peace it's
[38:11] understandable that his thoughts
[38:13] would be thoughts of peace and not of
[38:15] evil and to have a
[38:17] peaceful outcome and that's
[38:20] what god has amen you know a lot of
[38:24] people want peace and they want the
[38:25] benefits of peace but they don't have
[38:28] the nature their nature isn't peaceful
[38:33] think about the whole world wants peace
[38:35] because
[38:36] so many stickers on the back of their
[38:38] cars are talking about
[38:40] world peace and peace and get along with
[38:43] everybody
[38:44] but their own nature isn't peaceful
[38:49] they would like peace but they don't
[38:52] know spiritually how
[38:53] to make peace themselves
[38:57] currently a lot of people make peace by
[39:00] just separating themselves
[39:02] from somebody all right amen can you
[39:05] imagine where we would be
[39:07] today if that's the way that god made
[39:10] peace
[39:12] by separating himself from everyone that
[39:14] disagreed with him
[39:16] amen can you imagine he would not have a
[39:20] bride today without spot or wrinkle
[39:24] he would not even be able to take a
[39:25] bride out of the gentiles
[39:28] right just because they disagreed with
[39:31] him
[39:32] every single person that god saved
[39:34] disagreed with god
[39:37] their nature was so selfish they didn't
[39:40] want to give their will over to god
[39:44] but that isn't god's nature to separate
[39:46] amen
[39:47] i think that anytime we have thoughts
[39:49] about separating from someone because we
[39:51] don't get along with them
[39:52] those thoughts are not spiritual
[39:54] thoughts
[39:56] they're carnal thoughts they're not
[39:58] god's thoughts
[40:01] god is a peacemaker he makes peace
[40:05] where there is no peace he takes trouble
[40:08] and calms the storms of life he takes
[40:11] sickness
[40:11] and illness and he brings healing he
[40:14] takes confusion and brings clarity and
[40:17] understanding
[40:18] he takes doubts and worries and he
[40:20] dissolves them
[40:21] he's a waymaker he takes someone who's
[40:24] lost
[40:24] and he points them in the right way he
[40:27] leads them to truth and eventually sets
[40:29] them free
[40:31] god is a peacemaker
[40:34] and he doesn't do it by separating
[40:36] himself from others
[40:39] in fact he kneels down he gets his hands
[40:42] dirty
[40:43] and he washes feet now to me we all know
[40:47] the story we all know about
[40:48] but how many is practicing it you know
[40:51] there
[40:52] are so many needs that we could just be
[40:54] running to to help somebody
[40:56] but we're just too busy
[41:04] now god in the garden he had
[41:07] to separate himself from
[41:12] adam and eve and he put flaming swords
[41:14] there because he's a holy god
[41:17] and he didn't want them to partake of
[41:18] the tree of life in that condition
[41:21] but even at that time that god had
[41:23] thoughts of peace
[41:26] to make a way where there just seemed to
[41:27] be no way
[41:30] he had an expected end for adam and eve
[41:34] he certainly did and it was not of evil
[41:37] but of peace
[41:42] god loves man he created man
[41:46] to love god back he doesn't take
[41:49] pleasure in the death of the wicked or
[41:51] his enemies
[41:53] he tries to make friends out of all his
[41:55] enemies
[41:57] every man was his enemy
[42:01] and he made a way for every man to come
[42:04] back to him
[42:05] amen god is omnipotent he knows
[42:09] everything before it happens he knew
[42:11] that
[42:12] man would fall to his own will
[42:15] because he didn't want to obey god's
[42:18] will
[42:18] right think about it he fell to his own
[42:21] will
[42:22] that's how terrible our will is
[42:26] but he provided a way in his thoughts
[42:28] and he had thoughts of peace
[42:31] to give an expected end though and those
[42:33] thoughts became expressed in
[42:35] in words and and those words will not
[42:38] return void that god spoke
[42:40] amen so it's going to happen turn with
[42:44] me if you would to first peter chapter 1
[42:46] verse 18.
[42:48] for as much as you know that ye were not
[42:51] redeemed with corruptable things as
[42:53] silver and of gold
[42:55] from your vain conversations received by
[42:58] the tradition of your fathers but with
[42:59] the precious blood of the lamb
[43:00] without blemish and without spot who
[43:03] verily was
[43:04] for ordained before the foundation of
[43:06] the world
[43:07] but was manifest in these last times for
[43:10] you
[43:11] so in the beginning the foundation of
[43:13] the world god had
[43:15] thoughts to bring a peace and a remedy
[43:17] for you and i
[43:18] amen who by him we do do
[43:22] uh i'm sorry who by him do believe in
[43:24] god that raised him from the dead and
[43:26] gave him glory
[43:27] that your faith and hope might be in god
[43:30] seeing
[43:30] ye have purified your souls how do you
[43:34] do that
[43:35] in obeying what you hear at church when
[43:38] you read the bible when you listen to
[43:40] the tapes
[43:41] it isn't just a word to listen to you
[43:44] obey the truth through the spirit unto
[43:46] unfraimed
[43:47] unfriend love of the brethren
[43:50] see that you love one another with a
[43:54] pure heart servantly amen
[43:57] it's a lot different than fake amen
[44:00] that's really good being born again now
[44:04] here it is
[44:05] being born again not of a corruptable
[44:07] seed
[44:09] but incorruptible by the word of god
[44:12] which liveth
[44:13] and abideth forever that's what's
[44:17] happening to
[44:17] us when we hear the word and we say
[44:20] amen that's a living word when the holy
[44:23] spirit inside of you
[44:25] makes it real you become the word amen
[44:28] amen
[44:29] it's through faith he broke down
[44:33] the middle wall of partition he went and
[44:36] offered
[44:37] himself in the flesh for you and i and
[44:40] calvary became
[44:42] our way of peace back to god amen
[44:45] ephesians chapter 2 verse 12 says that
[44:47] at that time
[44:49] ye were without christ having no hope
[44:53] and without god in the world
[44:57] that's where we were just totally
[44:59] separated from god
[45:02] verse 13 but now in christ jesus ye were
[45:04] some
[45:05] ye who were sometimes far off are made
[45:07] nigh by the blood of christ
[45:09] i can say this that that god drew a
[45:12] bigger circle
[45:15] he drew a bigger circle that's what he
[45:17] did amen
[45:21] for he is our peace
[45:25] who have made both one and have broken
[45:27] down the middle wall partition between
[45:29] us
[45:31] having abolished in his flesh the enmity
[45:34] even the law of commandments contained
[45:36] in the ordinances for us to make
[45:38] in himself of twain
[45:42] one new man so making
[45:45] peace god didn't want to be alone
[45:50] he didn't want to be separated and a
[45:53] part of him
[45:54] was separated out in the world that was
[45:56] his wife
[45:58] and he made a way for his wife to come
[46:00] back
[46:02] she was lost she was undone she didn't
[46:04] have the knowledge of even
[46:07] her condition but he showed her her
[46:10] condition
[46:11] and he made a way for her to come back
[46:14] he drew that bigger circle
[46:16] so they could take twain could be one
[46:20] god's interest is making us one with him
[46:23] and to have
[46:24] an expected end
[46:31] that he might reconcile both unto god in
[46:34] one
[46:35] body by the cross having slain the
[46:38] enmity
[46:39] thereof god comes
[46:42] in a human body he speaks the word
[46:46] a virgin shall conceive the word is
[46:49] spoken
[46:50] it comes to pass and he comes and he
[46:52] offers himself
[46:54] that he might become one with his bride
[46:57] again
[46:58] because she's been lost she's been
[47:01] separated
[47:02] and i just want to touch on this oneness
[47:04] here because
[47:06] the end game is the same game that god
[47:09] had at the beginning
[47:11] john chapter 17 verse 20 he says neither
[47:13] pray i for these alone
[47:15] but for them also which shall come shall
[47:18] believe on me through their word
[47:21] that's right so he's getting ready to
[47:22] know he's praying for his disciples
[47:25] the most important thing and he says
[47:27] that they all may be
[47:28] one as thou father and me and i in thee
[47:32] that they also may be one in us that the
[47:34] world may believe that thou
[47:36] sent me so notice
[47:40] what's on the mind of god
[47:43] in jesus prayer is to be won this is the
[47:47] expected end
[47:48] that there would be a oneness between us
[47:50] and god
[47:51] now this should be our focus our main
[47:54] focus in life
[47:55] nothing else not just um not just saying
[47:58] we're in the message
[47:59] in the bride going to message church um
[48:03] is a oneness with god amen these things
[48:06] bring us to
[48:07] such a oneness with god that nothing
[48:10] matters to us except oneness with god
[48:14] and when we're truly one with god we're
[48:16] one with his people
[48:18] you remember that it is impossible to be
[48:21] one with god
[48:22] and not to be one with his people it is
[48:25] impossible
[48:26] that's what a denomination is
[48:31] can you imagine being in heaven i'm with
[48:34] jesus i don't know where all those guys
[48:35] are at
[48:39] we just got to get a oneness spirit by
[48:42] one spirit
[48:44] we're all baptized into the body that
[48:45] one spirit not five different spirits
[48:51] and the glory which thou gavest me i
[48:54] have given them
[48:55] that they may be one even as we are one
[48:58] again repeating the word
[49:00] one i in them and thou and me
[49:04] that they may be made perfect in
[49:08] one he doesn't even want us one but
[49:12] kind of one he wants us perfect in one
[49:16] and that the world may know that thou
[49:18] sent me
[49:20] and has loved them as thou has
[49:23] loved me right amen you become
[49:27] one with god by the word
[49:30] when you receive the living
[49:33] word not the dead letter but the word
[49:37] becomes
[49:37] so real to you that you actually unite
[49:41] with the word
[49:42] and say so be it in my life
[49:45] so be it let me let me live this
[49:48] life that you're saying my words are
[49:51] spirit
[49:51] and their life they are manifested in
[49:54] the flesh that's what's supposed to
[49:55] happen in this hour
[49:56] and is happening to the believer to the
[49:59] bride who believes
[50:01] god is daring us to believe to become
[50:03] one with his word
[50:09] for by one spirit
[50:12] the bible says in first corinthians
[50:14] chapter 12 verse 12 4 as the body is one
[50:17] and have many members yes and all the
[50:20] members of that
[50:21] one body remember our one
[50:25] body so also is christ showing us the
[50:28] same thing so it
[50:31] we we should be so in love with one
[50:34] another
[50:36] for by one spirit are we all baptized
[50:38] into one body whether we be jews or
[50:40] gentiles we've
[50:41] bonded or free and have been all made to
[50:44] drink into one spirit now i just want to
[50:46] say this
[50:47] there should be no difference between me
[50:50] hugging
[50:51] any brother in this church the feeling
[50:55] should be
[50:56] the same
[51:04] now when our flesh it's no i got
[51:07] favorites
[51:11] it's a real thing but we need to really
[51:14] get out of it
[51:17] now i understand that there's certain
[51:18] callings and
[51:20] jesus took peter and james and they went
[51:22] up a little further to pray i understand
[51:24] all that
[51:25] that's god's business that's not our
[51:28] business
[51:33] our subject peace let's get back to
[51:35] ephesians chapter 2
[51:36] verse 16 and that he might reconcile
[51:39] both
[51:40] unto god in one body by the cross having
[51:42] slain the
[51:43] entity thereby amen now what is the
[51:46] enmity
[51:47] it is the power of satan over
[51:50] your nature
[51:54] that's the enemy
[51:57] without the holy ghost
[52:02] our will is always going to prevail
[52:04] right amen
[52:06] it takes the holy spirit inside of us
[52:10] to carry out his will
[52:13] and came and god
[52:16] drew a bigger circle and preached peace
[52:19] unto you
[52:20] which were afar off and to them that
[52:22] were nigh
[52:24] for through him through christ we both
[52:26] have access by one spirit unto the
[52:28] father
[52:30] now there are four ye are no more
[52:32] strangers and foreigners
[52:34] no more you're a fellow citizen with the
[52:38] saints
[52:38] and of the household of god amen isn't
[52:41] it a wonderful thing when
[52:43] you first come into christ and you kind
[52:44] of feel like well this is strange
[52:46] everybody's
[52:47] you know acting like this and saying
[52:49] amen and loving praying out loud and
[52:51] they just love everybody and you kind of
[52:52] feel
[52:53] kind of like like out of place we've all
[52:56] felt that
[52:58] but then when we realize who we belong
[53:01] to
[53:02] that we're part of the same family amen
[53:05] we're fellow
[53:06] citizens with the saints and of the
[53:08] household of god and are built
[53:10] upon the foundation of the apostles and
[53:13] prophets
[53:14] jesus christ himself being the chief
[53:16] cornerstone
[53:17] amen in whom though all the
[53:20] building fitly framed together growth
[53:23] unto a holy temple unto the lord
[53:25] in whom he also built it together for a
[53:27] habitation
[53:28] of god through the spirit
[53:33] god doesn't want any leaky windows
[53:37] he doesn't want any places where the
[53:39] wind's blowing through and the snow was
[53:42] coming through
[53:43] he wants us kind of framed together
[53:46] knitted together
[53:47] helping one another taking care of the
[53:49] needs in
[53:50] the house amen
[53:57] every one of you that has a house
[54:01] both you and your wife feel that's your
[54:03] house
[54:06] even the children feel this is
[54:10] our home this is where we live so each
[54:13] one of you feel a responsibility
[54:16] when there's something wrong in that
[54:17] house that it needs to get taken care of
[54:22] tree falls on the house and messes
[54:24] something up
[54:27] it's not just one person that feels oh
[54:34] because this is god's
[54:37] house and we're all responsible for
[54:41] god's house
[54:42] you know brother branham brother branham
[54:43] said it like this he said
[54:45] when he preached in church ordered he
[54:47] said everything
[54:49] is fine and dandy as everything's going
[54:51] real good he says but remember
[54:54] and he's repeating what paul said there
[54:56] in the book of acts
[54:58] that when he was going to leave
[55:01] that grievous wolves were going to come
[55:03] in other words he said
[55:04] satan would not leave you that way even
[55:07] though everything's going good
[55:10] he's still working on something it may
[55:12] take him months to do
[55:14] but he's working on something but what
[55:17] did he tell us to do
[55:18] he said you just come together that much
[55:20] stronger that much
[55:21] tighter because we're a house
[55:25] we're the house of god amen
[55:29] if you don't stand for for for god how
[55:32] is he going to stand for you
[55:38] it's not our brother not our sister
[55:41] it's the devil trying to get through
[55:43] amen
[55:46] and it's you know the devil's not gone
[55:51] he's still causing trouble all you got
[55:54] to do is look what happened yesterday in
[55:55] your life
[55:58] so he can't get through today he'll try
[56:00] next week he can't get through next week
[56:02] he'll try
[56:03] next month but we stay fortified in
[56:07] christ
[56:08] we're a family the family of god
[56:11] amen now god had thoughts for us
[56:15] from the beginning to give us an
[56:16] expected in
[56:19] he made a way for us to become one with
[56:22] him
[56:24] he became us that we might become him we
[56:27] could say like this we're a chip
[56:29] off the old block
[56:32] and god not only identifies his children
[56:36] as children that can love everyone
[56:39] but also children that make peace
[56:43] that's right in the beatitudes matthew
[56:45] chapter 5 verse 9
[56:46] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[56:49] shall be
[56:49] called the children of god
[56:53] he identifies his own children as
[56:56] someone that
[56:57] makes peace he identifies his children
[57:01] as being a chip off the old block
[57:05] god's children are peacemakers their
[57:08] thoughts are thoughts of peace as well
[57:11] their makeup and their nature is
[57:14] peaceful their objectives and their
[57:18] their motives are peaceful yes
[57:21] their end game is one to bring
[57:24] peace they lay hands on the sick
[57:29] and they recover that's bringing peace
[57:32] to the body
[57:34] they condensate to men of low estate
[57:37] why to help them
[57:41] not to not to separate them but to help
[57:44] them
[57:44] amen they pray for god's spiritual
[57:48] blessings on others in fact the bible
[57:50] says they're always
[57:51] praying supplication with perseverance
[57:55] in the spirit for all saints
[57:58] i believe they pray they support the
[58:00] ministry
[58:01] amen they restore others who are
[58:04] overtaken in faults and they
[58:06] they do it with the spirit of meekness
[58:10] they draw the bigger circle they don't
[58:13] run and go
[58:13] talk behind their back
[58:17] i'm telling you that is as far as away
[58:20] from the peacemakers i
[58:21] know could be they bear one another's
[58:25] burdens
[58:26] they wash one another's feet they lay
[58:29] down their lives for the brethren
[58:31] amen they go to their brother and their
[58:33] sister you know what they do
[58:34] they make peace with them they practice
[58:38] forgiving
[58:39] seven times 70 because
[58:43] they really are peacemakers just like
[58:45] their heavenly father
[58:47] their father hasn't our father has not
[58:50] ordained us
[58:58] to start proving who's right who's wrong
[59:00] right it's true
[59:03] he has our dangerous children to
[59:05] recompense
[59:06] evil for evil
[59:12] in fact he teaches them vengeance
[59:13] doesn't belong to the children he said
[59:15] vengeance belongs
[59:16] to me i will repay it's not our job to
[59:20] do that
[59:21] amen the fathers are dangerous children
[59:25] to live
[59:25] peaceably with all men he orders the
[59:28] steps of a good man
[59:30] his children walk with their feet shod
[59:32] with the preparation of the gospel of
[59:34] peace
[59:35] amen he leads his sheep besides still
[59:38] peaceable waters amen he prepares a
[59:41] table for his
[59:42] uh he protects the table for us in the
[59:45] presence of our enemies if our enemy
[59:47] wants to stay here fine
[59:51] judas you want to stay here fine
[59:55] doesn't matter god's a god of peace
[59:59] there's no fussing there's no fighting
[1:00:01] there's no arguing
[1:00:03] they don't bite and devour one another
[1:00:06] in fact if their enemy is hungry they
[1:00:08] just feed them
[1:00:10] if they want the word give them the word
[1:00:12] they want love give them love they want
[1:00:14] encouragement give them encouragement
[1:00:18] they want christ give them christ amen
[1:00:21] blessed are the peacemakers for they
[1:00:24] shall be called
[1:00:25] the children of god wow something we
[1:00:28] don't think about very much do we
[1:00:31] we'll stand as i'm a child of god but we
[1:00:34] won't give two seconds to think about
[1:00:36] making peace
[1:00:37] now that just doesn't make sense to me
[1:00:43] it's it's it's so denominational
[1:00:46] thinking
[1:00:49] you know i mean this is how we believe
[1:00:51] if you believe like this you're in
[1:00:54] i just want to believe the word does the
[1:00:57] word
[1:00:58] am i believing the word or am i
[1:01:00] believing what i want to believe
[1:01:04] i don't want to call myself a child of
[1:01:07] god and not be a peacemaker that is such
[1:01:09] a lie
[1:01:12] every man's a liar
[1:01:15] but if i'm a peacemaker i don't have to
[1:01:17] call myself a child of god
[1:01:19] i'm living i'm a child of god
[1:01:24] we know that god is not a respecter
[1:01:26] person
[1:01:27] we know that he's not a god of confusion
[1:01:29] amen
[1:01:30] and when i see either of these two being
[1:01:32] manifested i do not
[1:01:34] feel a peaceable spirit of christ
[1:01:41] just as god has made peace with us when
[1:01:44] we didn't care
[1:01:45] we should be making peace with others
[1:01:48] when they don't care
[1:01:50] that's what that means
[1:01:53] well they don't want to they don't
[1:01:55] listen well aren't you glad god didn't
[1:01:57] have that
[1:01:58] opinion about you when he came to you
[1:02:02] do you have the mind of christ we need
[1:02:06] to bridge the gap
[1:02:07] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:02:10] and forever in his bride
[1:02:13] ephesians chapter 4 verse 1 i therefore
[1:02:16] the prisoner of the lord
[1:02:18] i beseech you that you walk worthy
[1:02:22] in other words walk as children of god
[1:02:25] amen with all lowliness
[1:02:30] and meekness with long
[1:02:33] suffering for bearing one another
[1:02:37] and i want to know the last time you did
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:43] i want to know the last time you did
[1:02:45] that i want to know the last time you
[1:02:46] did that
[1:02:47] for somebody you didn't like somebody
[1:02:50] you got a problem with
[1:02:53] now you can tell me pretty quickly
[1:02:56] the last time you separated from
[1:02:58] somebody you didn't agree with
[1:02:59] but that's not what the scripture is
[1:03:01] saying you got to walk with them
[1:03:04] forbearance include them draw that
[1:03:07] bigger circle
[1:03:08] amen be a children of god
[1:03:14] endeavoring working hard to keep the
[1:03:16] unity of the spirit
[1:03:17] in the bond to peace oh
[1:03:21] my endeavoring you know that's work
[1:03:24] that means work that means if i got a
[1:03:27] problem with my brother
[1:03:30] and he's being a little standoffish
[1:03:35] not try to draw a circle and include him
[1:03:38] in
[1:03:39] and he just kind of steps out of that
[1:03:40] circle
[1:03:42] that means i got to work again endeavor
[1:03:46] not try once and stop not try twice
[1:03:49] but endeavor just keep working at it
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:56] i want to live the word i'm not living
[1:03:59] all the word i want to live all the word
[1:04:02] amen and i'll tell you there's
[1:04:05] like the more and more i'm honest with
[1:04:08] myself the more and more i see that i'm
[1:04:09] not living this word
[1:04:12] it's by the grace of god that we're here
[1:04:14] today that our eyes are open that we
[1:04:15] have a chance
[1:04:18] it's not about knowing it's about living
[1:04:24] amen and the only way you're going to
[1:04:26] live it
[1:04:27] is getting some hot water get a chance
[1:04:30] to prove yes there is one body
[1:04:34] one spirit even as you're called into
[1:04:36] one hope of your calling so we got to
[1:04:39] endeavor to keep the unity of the one
[1:04:42] body of christ you know what the problem
[1:04:44] is
[1:04:46] the problem is in our thoughts we don't
[1:04:48] think this person's in the body so we
[1:04:50] won't try
[1:04:54] you tell me if that's the spirit of
[1:04:56] christ
[1:04:59] i should have to do that
[1:05:07] i just you know all the only thing i
[1:05:08] want to see is the spirit of christ
[1:05:11] living in you amen i don't care how long
[1:05:14] you've been in the message
[1:05:16] i don't care what you know
[1:05:19] i want to see you loving one another i
[1:05:21] want to see you laying down your life
[1:05:22] for one another
[1:05:23] i want to see you standing in the gap
[1:05:26] and drawing a bigger circle
[1:05:27] even around me
[1:05:37] not carnally separating right
[1:05:44] be a peacemaker
[1:05:48] every one of us were enemies with god
[1:05:51] and he made peace with us
[1:05:55] yeah he paid the price but he still
[1:05:57] tugged on her heart he still showed us
[1:05:59] he loved us
[1:06:00] and he wooed us what are we doing with
[1:06:03] others i don't that's not my job that's
[1:06:05] got that's
[1:06:06] you know if it wasn't for somebody else
[1:06:08] you wouldn't be here today
[1:06:09] god used somebody to bring you here
[1:06:11] today to bring you to him
[1:06:17] we're in debt blessed are the
[1:06:20] peacemakers
[1:06:22] for they shall be called the children of
[1:06:24] god amen
[1:06:25] the children of god have thoughts of
[1:06:28] peace
[1:06:29] their thoughts are peace just like their
[1:06:31] heavenly father
[1:06:33] their thoughts are are to see an
[1:06:35] expected end
[1:06:36] with the brother or the sister they got
[1:06:38] a problem with
[1:06:41] they they expect an end right
[1:06:45] not
[1:06:48] they have a humble mind about it the
[1:06:50] mind of christ
[1:06:52] they have a servant mentality i need to
[1:06:54] reach out to them they
[1:06:56] they esteem them better than themselves
[1:07:00] they don't think evil they don't think
[1:07:03] ill of their neighbor
[1:07:05] deuteronomy 27 says verse 24
[1:07:08] curse it is he that strikes at his
[1:07:12] neighbor secretly
[1:07:17] they don't judge others in their
[1:07:19] thoughts
[1:07:21] but rather they prefer one another over
[1:07:23] themselves
[1:07:26] sometimes we end up judging others and
[1:07:28] we don't even realize we're doing it at
[1:07:30] the time
[1:07:32] and kind of be carnal like that can't we
[1:07:37] we as god's children ought to be better
[1:07:39] peacemakers by now
[1:07:42] we need to learn to to try the spirits
[1:07:44] more but you know what spirit we need to
[1:07:46] be trying is our spirit
[1:07:48] we need to have regular checkups about
[1:07:50] our motives and our objectives
[1:07:51] the prophet taught us that are we trying
[1:07:54] to make peace with others are we trying
[1:07:56] to prove that we're right
[1:07:57] or trying to prove they're wrong or
[1:07:58] trying to prove something else
[1:08:00] where is the motive where is the
[1:08:02] objective right amen
[1:08:04] try the spirit
[1:08:07] are we being critical are we tearing
[1:08:11] someone else down
[1:08:13] or are we building are we trying to make
[1:08:16] peace well brother john
[1:08:20] i just i don't want nothing to do with
[1:08:22] them
[1:08:24] that's your prerogative that ain't god's
[1:08:28] and that ain't the children of god
[1:08:30] that's all i'm saying
[1:08:32] you take it as it is
[1:08:37] i'd rather say with the word
[1:08:40] i'd rather draw a bigger circle i'd
[1:08:43] rather try to line up with the word than
[1:08:45] my feelings
[1:08:46] try to make the the message line up with
[1:08:50] me
[1:08:52] i'd rather not lean to my own
[1:08:53] understanding i want the understanding
[1:08:55] of god
[1:08:56] amen
[1:09:00] usually when someone is acting critical
[1:09:02] they're not very good
[1:09:04] at helping find solutions
[1:09:08] they're all too they're all together two
[1:09:11] totally different
[1:09:12] spirits one trying to make peace and and
[1:09:15] and one just being critical of a
[1:09:17] situation
[1:09:18] one spirit souls discord and the other
[1:09:21] soul is peace
[1:09:23] you get done one there's going to be
[1:09:24] more of a separation one there's going
[1:09:26] to be more of peace
[1:09:29] one spirit doesn't really care enough to
[1:09:32] help
[1:09:34] while the other spirit cares enough to
[1:09:37] lay down their own
[1:09:39] will because that's what you got to do
[1:09:41] to help somebody
[1:09:42] is get your will out of the way lay down
[1:09:43] your will
[1:09:46] one spirit is an expression of
[1:09:48] negativity
[1:09:49] while the other spirit is an expression
[1:09:51] of faith
[1:09:52] when god said that he has an expected
[1:09:55] end for us
[1:09:55] he knows that no matter what adam and
[1:09:57] eve go through no matter what we went
[1:09:59] through
[1:09:59] he has an expected end for us he
[1:10:01] believes
[1:10:05] but the problem is satan tries to get in
[1:10:08] our mind and doesn't get us to believe
[1:10:10] for our brother and her sister
[1:10:13] doesn't get us to believe for an
[1:10:14] expected end for them
[1:10:19] a negative spirit operates from thoughts
[1:10:22] of doubt and hopelessness
[1:10:24] what's the use nobody can help them
[1:10:29] they don't know what they're doing
[1:10:32] there you know every single person in
[1:10:34] here
[1:10:35] can help me if you wanted to amen
[1:10:40] to help me be a better christian
[1:10:43] to live this word to if you wanted to
[1:10:46] help me
[1:10:47] you could that's right
[1:10:50] every single one of you
[1:10:55] you just gotta want to it's only going
[1:10:58] to make
[1:11:00] the body better
[1:11:06] but you need an attitude of helping
[1:11:11] a positive spirit operates from thoughts
[1:11:13] of faith
[1:11:14] confidence hope and a peaceful solution
[1:11:18] i believe i can help my brother and
[1:11:20] sister i i want to reach out to them i'm
[1:11:23] going to start with prayer
[1:11:24] and i'm going to move forward now this
[1:11:27] is the right spirit
[1:11:30] but trying to accomplish it without the
[1:11:32] right spirit is just fruitless
[1:11:39] we have to have a spirit of faith
[1:11:44] it's a beautiful spirit that god
[1:11:46] operates from
[1:11:48] for he is the prince of peace he will
[1:11:51] bring peaceful outcomes through each one
[1:11:54] of us if we just
[1:11:55] yield our vessel to him
[1:11:59] that's what i'm trying to say god can
[1:12:01] use every one of you to help me
[1:12:04] so it's not a matter of me being wrong
[1:12:06] it's not a matter of your brother and
[1:12:07] sister being wrong
[1:12:08] it's we're all wrong we only got to
[1:12:11] spend five minutes with somebody we'll
[1:12:12] find a lot of things wrong with that
[1:12:14] person
[1:12:15] come on that's the truth but how many
[1:12:18] wants to take a minute and help that
[1:12:20] person
[1:12:21] homie's got enough faith to do that
[1:12:24] somebody's got enough holy ghost to do
[1:12:26] that
[1:12:27] i mean he's got a a new creation
[1:12:30] enough to do that
[1:12:35] he cares do you care
[1:12:38] [Music]
[1:12:42] i think as god's children we need to
[1:12:44] focus more on growing up
[1:12:46] amen we're at the end
[1:12:50] it's it's time to start you know when
[1:12:52] you're running a long race
[1:12:55] you don't come out of the gate sprinting
[1:12:57] hard
[1:12:59] because it's a you got to run the race
[1:13:01] with patience the bible says
[1:13:03] but we're getting right down to the end
[1:13:05] we only have a little bit more time left
[1:13:07] and we need to start as every runner
[1:13:10] raises at the end he picks up his speed
[1:13:14] we need to start getting serious about
[1:13:15] this word amen
[1:13:17] ephesians chapter 4 verse 15 speaking
[1:13:20] the truth in love
[1:13:25] wow it will get further along if we use
[1:13:30] love
[1:13:32] brother john love is corrective yes i
[1:13:34] know love is corrective
[1:13:37] but love is not hateful
[1:13:40] there's a big difference
[1:13:44] speaking the truth in love may grow
[1:13:48] up
[1:13:51] into him in all things
[1:13:55] that's what i'm saying the more we come
[1:13:57] to church the more we read the word the
[1:13:59] more we listen
[1:14:00] the more i see i need to grow up
[1:14:04] the thing is do i want to grow up or do
[1:14:07] i want to stay a baby
[1:14:10] to grow up in him and all things which
[1:14:13] is the head even christ
[1:14:14] amen
[1:14:18] you know we all need to grow up but some
[1:14:19] of us are still acting like babies
[1:14:21] way too much causing contentions
[1:14:25] divisions
[1:14:26] trying to prove who's right and wrong
[1:14:30] sowing seeds of discord among the
[1:14:32] brethren that will eventually manifest
[1:14:35] james said in chapter 3 verse 5 even
[1:14:38] soul the tongue
[1:14:40] is a little member boasteth great things
[1:14:43] behold how great a matter just a little
[1:14:46] fire kindleth
[1:14:48] and the tongue is a fire a world of
[1:14:50] iniquity so was the tongue among our
[1:14:52] members
[1:14:53] right that it defiled the whole body
[1:14:57] and set it on fire the course of nature
[1:15:00] and is set on fire of hell you ever get
[1:15:02] in just a
[1:15:03] real outright yelling match
[1:15:07] before you know it you're saying things
[1:15:09] you haven't said in years
[1:15:11] it's true that is the truth like where
[1:15:13] in the world did that come from
[1:15:16] because that little tongue that can set
[1:15:19] a fire at a blaze and
[1:15:21] make the blazes of fires in california
[1:15:23] seem like nothing
[1:15:26] that's what a little tongue can do
[1:15:30] lord help us it's time to put away
[1:15:33] our childish thinking amen and learn to
[1:15:36] become
[1:15:36] spiritual peacemakers
[1:15:39] spiritual peacemakers god is an expected
[1:15:43] end for us thoughts of peace
[1:15:45] first corinthians 13 11 says when as a
[1:15:47] child i spake as a child
[1:15:49] understood as a child i thought as a
[1:15:52] child
[1:15:54] but when i became mature
[1:15:57] i put away childish thinking
[1:16:02] it's time to be thinking like a chip off
[1:16:04] the old block
[1:16:07] how god thinks god thinks about
[1:16:10] peace not just towards us but towards
[1:16:13] your brother and sister
[1:16:14] amen he has the same desires for them as
[1:16:16] he does for you
[1:16:18] he doesn't love you more than them why
[1:16:20] do you think that
[1:16:22] why do you think that why do you think
[1:16:24] you're so special
[1:16:26] because satan has gotten in your heart
[1:16:28] and mine
[1:16:33] you're not more special than anybody
[1:16:38] and we need to start acting
[1:16:42] like in fact you want to act like
[1:16:44] somebody's
[1:16:45] that there's some sort of separation
[1:16:47] between you and somebody
[1:16:50] i got scripture for you
[1:16:53] you need to esteem somebody else better
[1:16:55] than you
[1:17:00] you want to bring a separation use that
[1:17:01] one esteem somebody else better than you
[1:17:06] in your thoughts in your thoughts in
[1:17:09] your heart
[1:17:10] your mind and expected in i see
[1:17:13] that brother in that condition that
[1:17:15] sister in that condition
[1:17:16] that fallen state i see them in a better
[1:17:19] place
[1:17:24] instead of well i don't know i've been
[1:17:25] praying for them there's nothing seems
[1:17:27] to be
[1:17:28] why don't you try loving them just try
[1:17:30] having compassion
[1:17:31] while you stay there until you your
[1:17:33] tears come out of your
[1:17:34] your eyes that are full of compassion
[1:17:37] your heart just
[1:17:38] swells up and is enlarged for that
[1:17:40] person something will happen
[1:17:44] being spirituality what you know they
[1:17:46] what
[1:17:47] where you came from
[1:17:51] hey whatever you think it's about living
[1:17:54] this word
[1:17:57] we need to hunger
[1:18:03] god's holy spirit will lead his wife
[1:18:07] which is us to peaceful solutions
[1:18:10] with everyone
[1:18:14] everyone in this church should have said
[1:18:15] amen to that one
[1:18:21] he's going to lead us to draw a bigger
[1:18:24] circle god's holy spirit has an expected
[1:18:28] end of peace for those who are around
[1:18:30] you in your life
[1:18:31] it could be your work your home your
[1:18:33] family your church
[1:18:36] hebrews chapter 12 verse 14 says follow
[1:18:39] peace with all men
[1:18:42] follow peace with all men and holiness
[1:18:46] without which no man shall see the lord
[1:18:50] looking diligently
[1:18:54] you ever come up to a four-way or a
[1:18:58] crossroad and you just kind of quick
[1:18:59] look and go oh i didn't see them
[1:19:04] looking diligently looking diligently
[1:19:07] lest
[1:19:08] any man fail of the grace of god
[1:19:11] lest any root of bitterness spring up
[1:19:14] trouble you
[1:19:15] and thereby many be
[1:19:19] defiled one little
[1:19:23] root yes can eventually grow into such a
[1:19:28] powerful weapon that actually many
[1:19:31] people get defiled
[1:19:34] many and your root of bitterness isn't
[1:19:37] towards many
[1:19:38] it's usually towards one right amen but
[1:19:41] that could affect
[1:19:42] many yes right because
[1:19:45] of what it is it's it's a root of the
[1:19:47] devil
[1:19:48] amen it's a root of the first nature
[1:19:52] that we were born with
[1:19:54] right so i say this look
[1:19:58] for any root inside of you
[1:20:02] that could be better and get it pulled
[1:20:05] out quick
[1:20:05] because you don't want it coming out two
[1:20:07] years from now
[1:20:09] i'm serious it'll stay there it'll wait
[1:20:12] for the time
[1:20:12] and it'll defile many we need to get
[1:20:15] steered this is for the bride this is
[1:20:17] not for the foolish virgin
[1:20:19] this is for the bride because the bride
[1:20:22] has to deal with this we can't say i'm
[1:20:24] brian i don't have
[1:20:25] don't you be telling me i don't get no
[1:20:30] roots
[1:20:32] we're all supposed to be following
[1:20:33] christ
[1:20:36] christ came to every one of us at some
[1:20:38] time and said follow me
[1:20:40] amen we heard that that's right he is
[1:20:42] our example
[1:20:44] paul said follow me as i follow christ
[1:20:48] he says but if i preach anything that
[1:20:50] i've already preached don't follow me
[1:20:52] he said let me be a curse let's just
[1:20:53] follow paul for a moment in first peter
[1:20:57] or i'm going to read first peter chapter
[1:21:00] 2 verse 20.
[1:21:02] but we're going to follow that example i
[1:21:04] should say
[1:21:05] because we're allowed to follow anybody
[1:21:07] as long as we're following christ
[1:21:14] first peter chapter 2 verse 20 so here
[1:21:17] is peter
[1:21:17] talking about following christ
[1:21:20] for what glory is that when you're
[1:21:22] buffeted for your fault you shall take
[1:21:24] it patiently
[1:21:24] but when you do well and suffer for it
[1:21:27] you take it patiently
[1:21:28] this is acceptable with god it's hard to
[1:21:31] do that wouldn't you say that
[1:21:33] but god is saying i don't have babies
[1:21:36] don't don't remain a baby it's just
[1:21:40] it's time to grow up
[1:21:44] for even here and too where you call it
[1:21:46] even because christ
[1:21:48] also suffered for us leaving us an
[1:21:50] example that we should follow his steps
[1:21:54] who did no sin neither was guile found
[1:21:56] in his mouth
[1:21:57] who when he was reviled he reviled not
[1:22:00] again
[1:22:01] when he suffered he threatened not but
[1:22:03] committed himself to him that judge's
[1:22:04] righteous what was he doing
[1:22:08] he was making peace he was drawing a
[1:22:11] bigger circle
[1:22:13] he was not being contentious and i'm an
[1:22:16] eye for an eye and a tooth i'm going to
[1:22:17] prove the wrong
[1:22:18] it's two totally different spirits
[1:22:23] who his own self his own self bear our
[1:22:26] sins
[1:22:27] in his own body on the tree now i want
[1:22:29] to ask you a question was the last time
[1:22:31] you bore somebody else's burden
[1:22:34] that's exactly what christ did there
[1:22:37] when is the last time you bore
[1:22:39] somebody else's burden
[1:22:46] christ bore our sins but we're too busy
[1:22:50] to help somebody else with their sin
[1:22:52] amen
[1:22:54] they're too low they're too out of this
[1:22:58] they're i don't like that there's a root
[1:22:59] of bitterness
[1:23:02] how brother sister you may not like me
[1:23:05] you may not like this message but this
[1:23:06] is the truth
[1:23:08] this is for the bride
[1:23:12] it's about growing up anybody can talk
[1:23:15] the talk
[1:23:17] but when you can start getting some
[1:23:22] holes in your knees because you've been
[1:23:23] spending so much time trying to help
[1:23:25] somebody
[1:23:26] amen and you know what everybody's going
[1:23:28] to see it
[1:23:31] everybody's going to see it
[1:23:35] what a glorious time it'll be you know
[1:23:37] when you get to heaven with the bride
[1:23:39] they will be manifest they manifested
[1:23:41] all this
[1:23:42] that's right brother branson without
[1:23:44] perfect love you can't enter in
[1:23:46] somebody is going to get serious about
[1:23:48] it there's many going to come to me oh
[1:23:50] lord i did this i did this i did
[1:23:51] but they didn't get an expected in
[1:23:56] because they didn't think they needed
[1:23:59] the nature of
[1:24:00] god and the nature of god is to do his
[1:24:04] will
[1:24:07] not our own amen we can't do our will
[1:24:11] and god's will because that's what they
[1:24:14] did
[1:24:15] there's only god's will god's nature
[1:24:18] born again
[1:24:19] not a corruptible seed but incorruptable
[1:24:21] by the word of god
[1:24:23] that liveth and abideth forever
[1:24:26] we should be excited about god give me
[1:24:28] one chance this week
[1:24:30] to live this
[1:24:34] help me to start building start learning
[1:24:36] how to make peace
[1:24:40] starts in your heart with god when you
[1:24:42] got peace with god i'm telling you
[1:24:44] you'll know how to be peaceful with
[1:24:46] others but i'll tell you
[1:24:47] it's hard to make peace with others when
[1:24:49] you don't got peace with god
[1:25:02] who his own self bear sins in his own
[1:25:05] body on the tree that we
[1:25:06] being dead to sins should live unto
[1:25:10] righteousness
[1:25:11] amen whose stripes were healed for he
[1:25:13] were as sheep gone astray but now a
[1:25:15] return
[1:25:16] unto the shepherd and the bishop of your
[1:25:17] souls why because god drew a bigger
[1:25:19] circle
[1:25:21] and this is how we lead others
[1:25:25] back to christ who've gone astray we do
[1:25:27] the same thing
[1:25:28] yes god uses us god used somebody to get
[1:25:32] us
[1:25:33] god used us to get somebody well they're
[1:25:36] already in
[1:25:37] they've already rejected me how many
[1:25:39] times have you rejected christ this week
[1:25:42] and you're going to give me that excuse
[1:25:45] come on
[1:25:49] jesus said learn of me for i'm meek and
[1:25:52] lowly
[1:25:54] learned of me why did he want us to
[1:25:56] learn
[1:25:58] well he knew we needed rest for our
[1:26:01] souls
[1:26:03] and the only way we could get rest for
[1:26:05] our souls is learn of him and
[1:26:07] do what he tells us to do but the other
[1:26:10] reason
[1:26:11] he wanted us to learn of him is so we
[1:26:13] would know how
[1:26:15] to bring rest to somebody else to bring
[1:26:18] peace
[1:26:19] to somebody else to bring christ to
[1:26:21] somebody else
[1:26:25] how many people go to college seminars
[1:26:29] some sort of teaching on religion and
[1:26:31] try to find god
[1:26:33] and they're further away from god than
[1:26:34] when they started
[1:26:36] the only way that people are going to
[1:26:37] see god today is it being lived
[1:26:40] is it being lived in the bride and she's
[1:26:43] the only one that
[1:26:44] can live at this high amen as the world
[1:26:47] is growing darker
[1:26:48] our light should be getting lighter
[1:26:51] despite what's happening in the world
[1:26:54] despite what's happening in our life
[1:26:56] despite the troubles the problems the
[1:26:58] things we're going through
[1:26:59] our light should be beaming it's all
[1:27:02] that matters
[1:27:04] time is fading if we don't get
[1:27:07] interested in god
[1:27:10] i'm telling you god is moving forward
[1:27:12] amen
[1:27:16] first john chapter 3 verse 15
[1:27:19] whosoever hateth his brother is a murder
[1:27:23] now
[1:27:23] i just want to say we do not have
[1:27:26] anybody
[1:27:29] who says i hate them
[1:27:35] but this hatred is i love
[1:27:39] less
[1:27:43] than the body of christ that's what i'm
[1:27:46] saying
[1:27:47] i love less than the body of christ
[1:27:49] because
[1:27:50] see the body of christ is one
[1:27:54] and when you love less than that you're
[1:27:58] separating
[1:28:00] so whosoever hateth his brother is a
[1:28:01] murderer and
[1:28:04] you know that no murderers have eternal
[1:28:05] life abiding in them so
[1:28:07] if that spirit is there just rebuke it
[1:28:09] understand i'm saying just rebuke that
[1:28:11] spirit
[1:28:12] get it out of there real quick
[1:28:15] hereby perceive we the love of god
[1:28:18] because he laid down his life for you
[1:28:20] and i
[1:28:22] look we ought to be laying down our
[1:28:24] lives for the brethren
[1:28:27] real clear real clear don't make any
[1:28:29] sense why it's not happening
[1:28:31] just do it if we don't learn
[1:28:34] christ if we don't have the right
[1:28:37] understanding
[1:28:38] the right nature we could end up using
[1:28:40] our
[1:28:41] sword to actually cut
[1:28:45] somebody out
[1:28:50] we've seen it i'm going to straighten
[1:28:53] them out
[1:28:54] i'm going to tell them like it is i'm
[1:28:57] going to make them look bad feel bad
[1:28:58] because they are bad to the bone
[1:29:05] wow that's not what the sword's for
[1:29:09] the sword is not for that
[1:29:14] look paul said in second corinthians
[1:29:16] chapter six verse three giving no
[1:29:18] offense in anything that the ministry be
[1:29:21] not blamed
[1:29:27] we're going to show you what the sword
[1:29:29] is for in a little bit
[1:29:31] but in all things approving ourselves as
[1:29:33] ministers of god
[1:29:34] in much patience in afflictions and
[1:29:36] necessities and distresses and stripes
[1:29:38] and prisoners
[1:29:39] and turmoils laborers and watchings and
[1:29:40] fastings there is where you prove your
[1:29:43] real minister not behind the pulpit
[1:29:46] not by you talking to somebody
[1:29:48] one-on-one
[1:29:51] not through the taxing no
[1:29:55] it's when you're in these situations
[1:29:59] that you prove you're a minister
[1:30:03] by how you handle what you're going
[1:30:04] through
[1:30:08] you do it by pureness by knowledge by
[1:30:10] long suffering by kindness by the holy
[1:30:11] ghost by love and
[1:30:12] friend untrained by the word of truth
[1:30:16] by the power of god by the arm of
[1:30:17] righteousness on the right hand on the
[1:30:19] left by honor and dishonored by evil
[1:30:21] report and good report
[1:30:24] as deceivers you ever been called a
[1:30:26] deceiver
[1:30:27] yet true as unknown
[1:30:31] and yet you're well known by god as
[1:30:34] dying
[1:30:36] behold we live we're chastised but we're
[1:30:40] not killed
[1:30:42] as sorrowful yet we're always rejoicing
[1:30:45] as poor yes yet making many rich
[1:30:50] i had one brother call me he wanted to
[1:30:52] tell me what the need was back there
[1:30:54] and he said god rich you bless you at
[1:30:56] the end of his message and he says well
[1:30:58] god is going to have to bless me richly
[1:31:00] if he wants me to give
[1:31:01] to give you all that you're asking for
[1:31:03] and i said i'm a little wink
[1:31:08] which
[1:31:11] poor making many rich but we do that
[1:31:14] with the word of god
[1:31:16] amen amen not money as having nothing
[1:31:18] yet possessing all things
[1:31:21] oh ye corinthians our mouth is open unto
[1:31:24] you
[1:31:24] and our heart is enlarged
[1:31:28] paul's heart was so full of love and
[1:31:30] peace
[1:31:31] that he didn't believe in bringing
[1:31:33] offense to anybody
[1:31:37] that's why he was able to suffer so much
[1:31:40] because he was following the example
[1:31:43] that jesus gave he was following his
[1:31:45] footsteps yes
[1:31:47] to the t to the t look at
[1:31:51] the very announcement of the coming of
[1:31:53] christ
[1:31:54] in luke chapter 2
[1:31:57] the angel said unto them
[1:32:00] fear not for behold i bring you good
[1:32:04] tidings of joy which shall be
[1:32:05] to all people for unto you is born this
[1:32:08] day in the city of david
[1:32:10] a savior which is christ the lord and he
[1:32:12] shall
[1:32:13] and this shall be assigned unto you he
[1:32:16] shall find the babe
[1:32:18] wrapped in swallowing clothes laying
[1:32:20] there in a manger and
[1:32:21] suddenly there was with
[1:32:24] the angel a multitude of hosts
[1:32:28] they were praising god and look what
[1:32:29] they were saying glory to god in the
[1:32:31] highest
[1:32:31] and on earth peace
[1:32:36] peace good will toward men
[1:32:40] now isaiah called jesus the prince of
[1:32:44] peace
[1:32:45] and here the angels this
[1:32:49] announcement peace
[1:32:54] people without enough spirit of god tend
[1:32:56] to see god
[1:32:57] in more of a judgmental way
[1:33:01] like jesus going into the temple and
[1:33:03] cleaning up all their selfishness with
[1:33:05] the whip
[1:33:09] you know god can do that because
[1:33:12] vengeance belongs to him
[1:33:17] but we don't have whips in here
[1:33:21] we don't act do that we let jesus do
[1:33:24] that through the word
[1:33:25] amen
[1:33:31] but we don't have any part of that we
[1:33:33] don't hold the whip
[1:33:35] we don't nothing no thoughts
[1:33:39] it's all gods all through the working of
[1:33:41] the holy ghost
[1:33:42] he keeps the church clean
[1:33:48] i've watched it many times people will
[1:33:50] use the sword to actually hurt others
[1:33:52] to prove they're right or something like
[1:33:54] that
[1:33:55] it's sad but we should never ever do
[1:34:02] that
[1:34:04] in matthew chapter 10 verse 33
[1:34:10] i just want to show a balance in this
[1:34:13] right now
[1:34:15] jesus said but whosoever shall deny me
[1:34:18] before men
[1:34:21] him i also denied before my father in
[1:34:23] heaven
[1:34:24] think not that i come to send peace on
[1:34:26] the earth
[1:34:28] but i came i came not to send peace
[1:34:32] but a sword now what's jesus referring
[1:34:36] to here
[1:34:37] i came not to send peace but a sword
[1:34:39] here's the
[1:34:40] the prince of peace and he has come with
[1:34:43] a sword
[1:34:46] but this sword is to separate all those
[1:34:51] who will not believe him
[1:34:56] that's what he came to do to separate
[1:34:58] all those
[1:34:59] who don't care about following
[1:35:02] his word now he gives everybody a chance
[1:35:06] that's why the gospel has to be preached
[1:35:08] in all the world
[1:35:10] but he separates those
[1:35:16] who will not unite with him
[1:35:19] he doesn't take someone who doesn't want
[1:35:22] the word and swords them up
[1:35:27] and kills them
[1:35:30] the sword is against anyone who openly
[1:35:32] and willingly denies christ the word
[1:35:36] the word is what does this separate the
[1:35:38] sword is what does the separating
[1:35:40] amen but he didn't come
[1:35:45] to to bring peace
[1:35:49] to everybody even if they
[1:35:52] don't separate from the world
[1:35:57] you understand what i'm saying but the
[1:35:59] world wants a preaching like that
[1:36:02] peace to the world peace to everybody
[1:36:04] that's not the peace
[1:36:07] the only peace we have is in the word in
[1:36:09] christ he is our peace
[1:36:14] so the sword separates
[1:36:17] now verse 35 for him come
[1:36:20] to set a man at variance against his
[1:36:22] father and his daughter against his
[1:36:23] mother and his daughter-in-law against
[1:36:24] his mother-in-law
[1:36:26] and a man's full shall be of his own
[1:36:28] household
[1:36:30] and he that loveth father and mother
[1:36:31] more than me is not worthy of me
[1:36:33] he that loveth son and daughter more
[1:36:34] than me is not worthy of me
[1:36:36] he that taketh not up his cross and
[1:36:38] followed after me is not worthy of me
[1:36:41] he that findeth his life shall lose it
[1:36:44] and he that loseth his life for my sake
[1:36:46] shall find it so what god is saying here
[1:36:49] the sword that god has sent is his word
[1:36:53] and the sword will will separate all
[1:36:55] that don't
[1:36:56] believe him to be number one in their
[1:36:59] life
[1:37:02] even their own will their own will their
[1:37:04] own family
[1:37:08] you have to put god first
[1:37:12] and what that means is when you hear to
[1:37:14] be a peacemaker
[1:37:16] that's putting god first and you follow
[1:37:18] that
[1:37:23] follow peace with all men amen
[1:37:27] only people who love god first
[1:37:31] are going to be there in heaven that's
[1:37:33] what brother bryan meant when he said
[1:37:34] only perfect love shall enter in
[1:37:36] perfect love is complete love for god
[1:37:39] only god
[1:37:40] he's there's no room for me
[1:37:46] amen
[1:37:47] there is room to love everyone in his
[1:37:49] kingdom
[1:37:51] because jesus said the second
[1:37:54] commandment is like the first love your
[1:37:55] neighbor as yourself
[1:37:58] right the whole the whole law is in
[1:38:00] these two commandments
[1:38:05] god has to be first amen
[1:38:09] we're not called to sword anyone
[1:38:14] the sword is for us to cut away
[1:38:17] all unbelief all doubts all fears all
[1:38:21] arrogancy all pride
[1:38:23] all of our first nature that's what the
[1:38:25] sword is for
[1:38:27] it's to cut all the world away
[1:38:30] from us that's what the sword is for
[1:38:34] amen
[1:38:38] god does all the sword work
[1:38:42] not us he uses a five-fold ministry the
[1:38:45] voice of many waters brother brahm said
[1:38:47] in the patna's vision the voice of many
[1:38:50] waters
[1:38:51] what does waters represent if you want
[1:38:53] to mark it down
[1:38:54] turn to revelation 17 15 and you'll find
[1:38:57] that
[1:38:58] the bible said the waters that thou saw
[1:39:01] is thickness multitudes and people and
[1:39:04] tongues all right voice
[1:39:05] what a horrible thing for a drifting
[1:39:08] soul
[1:39:09] on the sea of life no pilot to guide him
[1:39:13] loose floating with the tides
[1:39:16] to hear the roar of the great cataracts
[1:39:20] the falls what a horrible thing it would
[1:39:23] be
[1:39:24] to a soul drifting the voice
[1:39:27] of many waters what is his
[1:39:30] voice it's the judgment
[1:39:36] the voice of the ministers through the
[1:39:39] holy
[1:39:40] spirit that's cried out to the people
[1:39:43] in every age standing there
[1:39:50] i don't know about you but we see it
[1:39:52] every time we come to church
[1:39:55] we see god screaming out
[1:39:59] to his ministers that's how real and how
[1:40:02] much god's here
[1:40:06] that sword god
[1:40:09] uses the word to cut away the world out
[1:40:12] of our life
[1:40:15] he's not interested in cutting us away
[1:40:18] from the body
[1:40:20] he's interested in cutting the world
[1:40:22] away from us to be in the body
[1:40:24] that's the nature of god that's what we
[1:40:27] should be doing
[1:40:28] seven times seventy
[1:40:33] i've tried i've tried i've tried you
[1:40:35] haven't tried you don't even know what
[1:40:37] trying is
[1:40:39] that is right you need to work like god
[1:40:42] works
[1:40:43] you need to bend his knees as much you
[1:40:46] need to bend your knees as much as he
[1:40:47] bends his
[1:40:50] you need to lay down your life as much
[1:40:52] as he did
[1:40:55] he gave his all amen
[1:40:58] too much were respected persons i like
[1:41:00] this person because i don't like this
[1:41:02] person because that's right
[1:41:04] that's not the children of god amen
[1:41:06] that's you know what you're saying
[1:41:08] my church is a denomination i'm the
[1:41:10] denomination of john martin
[1:41:12] that's right that's what you're saying
[1:41:15] but the children of god are peacemakers
[1:41:21] john chapter 12 verse 46.
[1:41:26] when we come to church we are literally
[1:41:28] standing
[1:41:30] at god's judgment that's what brother
[1:41:33] brandon said we
[1:41:33] met we come to find out where we're at
[1:41:35] with god
[1:41:37] but god is not
[1:41:40] judging everybody
[1:41:44] no he's given time
[1:41:47] for them to make a decision amen the
[1:41:50] judgment comes at the end
[1:41:52] we gladly come to church bow our knees
[1:41:55] worship the lord
[1:41:56] say thy will be done lord so be it right
[1:41:59] but to the world their judgment's coming
[1:42:01] at the end
[1:42:02] right john chapter 12 verse 46 i am come
[1:42:06] to light into the world
[1:42:08] that whosoever believeth on me should
[1:42:09] not abide in darkness
[1:42:11] that's why he's come that we would not
[1:42:13] abide in darkness
[1:42:15] and if any man hear my words and believe
[1:42:17] not i judge him not
[1:42:19] isn't that isn't that kind for i came
[1:42:22] not to judge the world
[1:42:23] but to save the world amen peace on
[1:42:27] earth
[1:42:27] good will towards men but he that
[1:42:31] rejecteth me
[1:42:32] and receiveth not my words have one that
[1:42:36] judgeth him
[1:42:38] the word that i have spoken the same
[1:42:41] shall judge him in the last day
[1:42:43] there is the sword vengeance is mine
[1:42:46] saith the lord i will repay
[1:42:48] it is god's word god's judgment amen
[1:42:53] but to us who received the word he is
[1:42:55] our peace
[1:42:57] amen the prince of peace
[1:43:02] amen if i could say today for the bride
[1:43:04] shalom
[1:43:08] for those who give their all to god
[1:43:10] there is an expected end
[1:43:12] a peace for her amen but for those who
[1:43:16] give only
[1:43:17] part of their will this is important
[1:43:24] like we read at the beginning many will
[1:43:25] come to me on that day
[1:43:28] will not get that expected in in fact he
[1:43:31] has promised
[1:43:32] tribulation
[1:43:36] now the these are church-going people
[1:43:38] they were virgins
[1:43:40] yes it's a scary thing that's what
[1:43:43] brother bran is the scary thing to
[1:43:45] to to to to be there listening to the
[1:43:47] word of god and not letting it penetrate
[1:43:50] you
[1:43:52] you know because satan knows how to
[1:43:54] harden our hearts
[1:43:56] he knows how to get our will to prevail
[1:43:58] against what's being preached
[1:44:02] soften my heart oh god soften my heart
[1:44:08] don't let satan deceive you in thinking
[1:44:10] that you own
[1:44:11] that you've given enough don't do that
[1:44:18] amen
[1:44:21] you know i have about five pages that i
[1:44:24] have to just
[1:44:27] let go
[1:44:31] so just pray for me that i want to wrap
[1:44:32] this up
[1:44:40] the bride is offering peace and
[1:44:43] salvation
[1:44:44] to those that are around her she's the
[1:44:48] only one
[1:44:48] amen amen
[1:44:53] the other church goers will not do that
[1:44:58] isaiah 52 verse 7 can will you let me go
[1:45:01] just a little bit
[1:45:02] how beautiful upon the mountains are the
[1:45:04] feet of him that bring good tidings
[1:45:07] that publish peace that bring good
[1:45:10] tidings
[1:45:10] of good and publish salvation
[1:45:14] that saith unto zion thy god reigneth
[1:45:19] god's nature is the same today
[1:45:24] it hasn't changed god inside of you will
[1:45:26] continue
[1:45:27] to draw the bigger circle
[1:45:30] god would have all men to be saved come
[1:45:33] to the knowledge
[1:45:34] of the truth right amen there's no way
[1:45:36] the prophet would have taught us
[1:45:38] to draw a bigger circle around someone
[1:45:41] who separates from us if it wasn't god's
[1:45:43] nature
[1:45:45] amen right so it is god's nature we need
[1:45:49] to practice it
[1:45:50] not be afraid not be afraid of turn down
[1:45:53] reject that has nothing to do with it
[1:45:55] draw the circle
[1:45:57] love the unlovable
[1:46:00] show them you're one with them
[1:46:05] there's a reward for those that draw a
[1:46:07] bigger circle
[1:46:11] you know the bible says all the paths
[1:46:14] that wisdom
[1:46:14] take are peaceful
[1:46:17] that's proverbs 3 17 if you want to
[1:46:19] write it down
[1:46:20] james 3 17 says but the wisdom that is
[1:46:23] from above
[1:46:24] is first pure and then what next
[1:46:28] peaceable it's gentle it's easy to be
[1:46:31] entreated it's full of mercy
[1:46:33] no judgment full of mercy good fruits
[1:46:36] without partiality right no respect to
[1:46:39] persons
[1:46:40] without hypocrisy it's just genuine
[1:46:44] amen and the fruit of righteousness
[1:46:47] is sown in peace of them that make peace
[1:46:51] we've got to get serious about making
[1:46:53] peace don't
[1:46:54] don't walk around acting like you're at
[1:46:56] peace with everybody
[1:46:58] don't act like it be it amen
[1:47:02] be it make it don't assume
[1:47:06] you're going to assume assume you need
[1:47:08] to draw a circle
[1:47:15] there's a reward for drawing a bigger
[1:47:17] circle isaiah 32
[1:47:19] 17 and the work of righteousness shall
[1:47:21] be peace and the effect of righteousness
[1:47:24] quietness and assurance forever and my
[1:47:27] people shall dwell
[1:47:28] in a peaceable habitation and
[1:47:31] ensure dwellings and quiet resting
[1:47:34] places
[1:47:36] how many times have you just wish you
[1:47:37] had peace
[1:47:41] all right just keep drawing circles when
[1:47:43] you're alone
[1:47:44] you know and the devil puts a thought in
[1:47:45] your head about somebody pray for them
[1:47:47] immediately
[1:47:48] because satan will take that as an idle
[1:47:52] mind and
[1:47:52] idle time and say something negative to
[1:47:54] you as soon as you do that
[1:47:57] as soon as you do that what you're doing
[1:48:00] is you're cutting off having a peaceable
[1:48:01] habitation after you're done thinking
[1:48:03] that
[1:48:04] amen
[1:48:09] first corinthians chapter 2 verse 9.
[1:48:12] talk about an expectation the bible says
[1:48:14] i have not seen ear have not heard
[1:48:16] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:48:18] man the things that god had prepared for
[1:48:20] them that love him
[1:48:21] that's right amen now do you love him
[1:48:25] enough to draw a bigger circle
[1:48:27] amen
[1:48:30] i believe the more you give of yourself
[1:48:34] the more of heaven is prepared for you
[1:48:40] he rewards according to works
[1:48:45] it's a love affair jesus couldn't
[1:48:48] say it's not up to me you know who's
[1:48:50] going to sit on my right hand and who's
[1:48:51] going to sit on my left
[1:48:56] but i believe god's nature
[1:49:00] he wants to reward those
[1:49:04] who give their all to him amen
[1:49:08] romans 8 verse 18 for i reckon that the
[1:49:11] sufferings of this present time
[1:49:12] they're not worthy to be compared with
[1:49:14] the glory that shall be revealed in us
[1:49:16] so
[1:49:16] it doesn't matter how much you're
[1:49:18] suffering to draw the circle
[1:49:20] right sure draw in a circle of suffering
[1:49:22] obviously
[1:49:27] but it's not worthy to be compared what
[1:49:29] you're going to get from it
[1:49:32] the lion is going to lay down with the
[1:49:33] lamb isaiah chapter 2 verse 4
[1:49:36] and he shall judge among the nations
[1:49:39] shall
[1:49:39] rebuke many people and they shall beat
[1:49:42] their swords into
[1:49:43] plowshares and their spears into pruning
[1:49:46] hooks
[1:49:47] nations shall not lift up sword against
[1:49:50] nation
[1:49:51] neither shall they learn war anymore
[1:49:55] o house of jacob come ye and let us walk
[1:49:58] in the light of the lord there will be a
[1:50:01] time of peace
[1:50:03] but god has left this peace today and i
[1:50:04] want to end with this little thought
[1:50:07] god has left us with peace today john 14
[1:50:10] 26
[1:50:11] but the comforter which is the holy
[1:50:13] ghost whom the father will send
[1:50:14] in my name he shall teach you all things
[1:50:18] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:50:19] whatsoever
[1:50:20] i've said unto you he said peace i
[1:50:23] leave with you
[1:50:27] my peace that's the only peace i really
[1:50:29] want
[1:50:30] god's peace my peace i give unto you not
[1:50:33] as the world gives
[1:50:36] right you go along with the world
[1:50:38] everything's okay
[1:50:40] and the pressure that the world is
[1:50:42] putting on us
[1:50:43] we have a brother that's uh in in the in
[1:50:46] this message
[1:50:47] he's a doctor and he just got a report
[1:50:53] sent down from the asa or something like
[1:50:56] that
[1:50:57] that said he is not allowed to put on
[1:50:59] his birth certificates anymore
[1:51:03] whether they're male or female
[1:51:09] this world is falling apart
[1:51:16] what pressure is coming upon people who
[1:51:18] have
[1:51:20] different beliefs and standards
[1:51:24] but jesus said peace i leave with you my
[1:51:26] peace i give unto you
[1:51:27] not as the world giveth give i unto you
[1:51:29] let not your heart be troubled
[1:51:31] neither let it be afraid you have heard
[1:51:33] i said unto you i go away and i
[1:51:35] and i come again unto you if i if you
[1:51:37] love me you would rejoice
[1:51:40] think about our our brother tim pruitt's
[1:51:43] wife
[1:51:45] to rejoice for her it's
[1:51:48] sad for those are left behind
[1:51:52] because i said this i go to my father
[1:51:54] for for my father is greater than i
[1:51:58] and now i have told you before it come
[1:52:00] to pass that that when it come to pass
[1:52:02] you might believe
[1:52:05] jesus answered he says do
[1:52:08] you now believe
[1:52:12] do you now believe he said behold the
[1:52:15] hours come
[1:52:16] yea has now come that ye shall be
[1:52:18] scattered every man to his own
[1:52:20] and shall leave me alone and yet i'm not
[1:52:22] alone because the father is with me
[1:52:25] these things have i spoken unto you that
[1:52:27] you might have peace
[1:52:28] in the world you shall have tribulation
[1:52:32] but be of good cheer
[1:52:32] overcome the world
[1:52:36] be of good cheer
[1:52:39] if god is living in you you have peace
[1:52:42] it is easy to draw a circle around
[1:52:45] somebody
[1:52:46] if god's in you it's harder than
[1:52:49] pushing a mountain if god's spirit isn't
[1:52:52] in you to draw a circle
[1:52:53] around somebody you got every reason in
[1:52:56] the world
[1:52:57] not to do it but if god is in you you
[1:53:00] can't stop
[1:53:03] that's what peacemakers do they shall be
[1:53:06] called the children of god
[1:53:08] so i'm saying to the bride shalom
[1:53:12] i'm going to end with this philippians
[1:53:14] chapter 4 verse 7. thank you for your
[1:53:16] patience
[1:53:19] and the peace of god which passeth all
[1:53:22] understanding
[1:53:23] shall keep your hearts and minds through
[1:53:25] christ jesus
[1:53:26] finally brother whatsoever things are
[1:53:28] true and honest
[1:53:30] and just and pure and lovely and of a
[1:53:33] good report
[1:53:34] if there's any virtue if there's any
[1:53:36] praise
[1:53:37] think on these things
[1:53:41] those things which you both learn and
[1:53:42] receive and heard and seen in me do
[1:53:45] and the god of peace shall be with you
[1:53:49] praise the lord i want the god of peace
[1:53:53] to be with me
[1:53:54] it starts in our mind don't let the
[1:53:58] devil use your mind don't let him use
[1:53:59] your thoughts
[1:54:01] think on these things but john they're
[1:54:04] true they're john what the devil's
[1:54:05] telling me they're true about that
[1:54:06] they're true what that sister did
[1:54:08] doesn't matter it's not a right report
[1:54:12] it's not pure it's not lovely
[1:54:19] i want you to draw a bigger circle go
[1:54:22] help them
[1:54:23] wouldn't it be victorious for you to sit
[1:54:25] back at the end of the day
[1:54:26] and say my brother my sister had this
[1:54:28] problem but i
[1:54:29] but i went and i helped them
[1:54:33] what glory do you get if you're only
[1:54:34] buffing it for your own mistakes
[1:54:39] go in there and get buffeted try to help
[1:54:42] somebody get buffeted
[1:54:44] but help them help them you'll win them
[1:54:50] try know the thoughts i think towards
[1:54:51] you saith the lord thoughts of peace
[1:54:53] and not of evil to give you an expected
[1:54:56] end
[1:54:58] i will hear what god will speak
[1:55:01] for he will speak peace unto his people
[1:55:04] and his saints
