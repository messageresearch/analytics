you can hear the songs of angels and a breeze from heaven Heaven send your spirit [Music] soing but in the valley once more will Jesus still be Lord that's the [Music] question cuz believing when believing isn't easy that is the testing I need faith for the days when trouble comes my way and I just don't understand what it means that's when nothing else will do faith alone will get me through and believing becomes my victory it's not hard to believe when things are going well and skies are sunny when you feel you're making progress doing good living in a time of Plenty but if all of that should change would you still will keep the faith that's the question cuz believing when believing isn't easy that is the testing I need faith for the times when the sun does not shine and the Mountaintop is is just a memory when there's no sign to be seen and I don't feel a thing to the word of God alone I must cling I need faith for the days when trouble comes my way and I just don't understand what it means that's when nothing else will do faith alone will get me through and believing becomes my victory I need faith for the times when the sun does not shine and the mountain top is just a memory when there's no sign to be seen and I don't feel a thing to the word of God alone I must cling I need faith for the days when trouble comes my way and I just don't understand what it means that's when nothing else will do faith alone will get me through and believing becomes my [Music] [Applause] victory amen whatever say situation like she said faith will get you through amen

proper place in our lips in our minds and in our hearts and we lift you up Lord today amen Lord we don't want this service to go by with out putting you in your proper place and father now as we

manifest in each of Our Lives father we pray that you would remember remember all the needs that would be represented here today and amongst your people Lord we know that you're here to do exceedingly above all that we would ask or even think you're mindful of us Lord and we just pray that you would meet every need according to your riches and glory and father now as we approach your word we ask that you would open our eyes and give us revelation of just the Simplicity that's in contained in these scriptures today help us not to miss it Lord remember your Prophet saying that you're hid in Simplicity amen help us to recognize it today in the opening of the word we commit the service now into your hands with every need we pray give you the glory in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of Jude for three scriptures of reading or uh I should say two verses and then have you be seated good to see sister uh Amanda I saw her uh good to see them back amen amen Jude um I always say chapter one is just not used to just saying Jude but verse number three and verse number 20 Jude speaking here beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the face that was once delivered unto the Saints amen amen then verse number 20 but ye beloved building up yourselves on the Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Holy Ghost amen amen and God bless you you may be seated um uh this is a very uh of course we've faith is something that we need to constantly be activated in our lives and to grow in because it is the key to get us to where we want to get to we in fact the prophet taught us that we'll need a perfect Faith to make it into the Rapture amen I want to entitle this message said struggling for Faith struggling uh for Faith and um as a first subject that faithfulness actually builds Faith amen I think one of the greatest reasons that people struggle to have faith in their life is that they're they're spiritually lazy I think it's one of the biggest reasons we we'll get into that but you know people just don't want to work for it right it's true and um uh there's this is a very not only a simplistic message but um as brother Marty would say he likes to see um practical things brought about things that you can put into practice to actually get to the the what we're looking for and um Jude said when I gave all diligence to write unto you in the common salvation it was needful there was a need there to write unto you and exhort you or to call you that you should ear earnestly contend that word contend means struggle for the faith that was once delivered unto the Saints and if we look at verse 5 there it says I will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt afterwards he destroyed them that believed not amen so there was something that was forgotten along the way he saved them they forgot something and then they got destroyed in 1 Corinthians 15:1 I'm just just going to read it you can write it down more over brother I declare unto you that uh the gospel which I preached unto you which also you have received wherein you stand by which you're also saved if if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you have believed in vain and this is what happened to the children of Israel they believed for a period but then they did not keep the faith the original faith is we're leading here and we're going into a Promised Land amen amen well most everybody wants to be saved true but the the the dividing line is of the requirements that God has to go into the promised land there's a relationship that's needed a a giving of your heart to God a keeping of his Commandments amen and God is looking more than just to save us right amen he wants a relationship amen that's right it's the now these the children of Israel that came out of Egypt they didn't make it right 1.8 million Jesus said your fathers did eat men in the wilderness and are dead of course we look up that word we know that means eternally separated so God wants us to earn ly contend for the original faith that we had when we first gave our heart to God we were just set free we were happy he took our sins away we made vows declarations I'm going to serve God all the days of my life amen and then to a period of time the devil got in there and uh things began to happen that that all of a sudden we find oursel in a place we're struggling to have faith amen verse 17 of Jude Jude verse 17 but beloved remember ye The Words which were spoken before of the Apostle of our Lord Jesus Christ before the Apostles of our Lord Jesus Christ how that they told you that there should be mockers talking about the age Rel living and how hard it is to have faith that there should be mockers in the last times who should walk after their themselves after their own lust and they even call it ungodly lust but all lust is wrong but they're they're mockers and and and Peter uses the same word when he said that in the last days scoffers shall come walking after their own lust so that word mockers and scoffers if you look it up is the exact same word amen questioning the promise of his coming CU things just seem the same you know nothing seems to change every every time the word is being preached Believers are not recognizing the coming of the Lord because in their mind they're just thinking about the the the coming that the Rapture morning it's like the only coming that they're thinking of and God is here God is in his word and he's unveiling himself in his word and we don't want to scof that we don't want to mock that we want to recognize God in his word amen amen oh he talks about these Believers in verse 19 these be they who separate themselves that word separate means disjoin they disjoin them themselves these scoffers these mockers Central that means and just a a lower nature a natural believer having not the spirit operating in their lives but you beloved build building up yourself building up yourself now here is the key right here to build yourself on your Most Holy Faith amen yours you already got it it's already inside of you amen praying in the Holy Ghost amen keep yourself in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ onto eternal life now don't try to have faith without the love of God Amen it won't do you any good in the long run you can have faith to remove mountains and not have the love of God and it's going to end up with nothing we want the love that the faith that worketh by love amen the the motive is I want to please you Lord Jesus amen let's be honest for just a minute before we start how many strugg struggles with happy Faith let me see your hands all right now let's see your hands who who's not being honest today we're in church we got to be honest we're living in the darkest hour where people don't even care enough to even want more faith we're living in the most deceptive age where people think they're in need of nothing they're so deceived they don't need we're living in Leo DEA where people are fighting fting more for their rights than they are fighting for Faith I'm going to fight for what's mine for what's yeah this is what I deserve and they're not even putting any attention to fighting for their faith right Jesus asked the question nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth real genuine faith is becoming less and less the truth we're seeing it less and less it's a struggle living by faith in these perilous times there's so many spirits attacking our faith on a daily basis pressures from every side Believers bringing worldly Spirits right into the church come on right true how are you going to create the right atmosphere for men shall be lovers of them own self coveted bolsters proud unthankful Unholy without affection truth Breakers had some sort of commitment but just break it false accusers incontinent that's no self-control Fierce angry despisers of those that are good just negative traitors heavy high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God now these are spirits that creep into the church because they creep into our life right amen amen what a a description of the spirits and what are they doing they're attacking our faith that's the truth amen they're attacking our faith Believers have gotten satisfied with a form of godliness they're okay not having the power I mean we should look at our life and say if we don't got power in our life we should be doing something about it amen but but Believers have gotten satisfied with just a form of godliness but Paul told Timothy turn away from such a spirit like that it'll take you [Applause] down I don't want to be resorted to just dressing in a form of of of godliness I don't want to just be acting like I living by faith right I don't want to just present myself as Godly I want to have the goods I don't want to just act like I'm spiritual I want to to be spiritual right amen amen we see that people are struggling to overcome there's there's no power in their lives to overcome and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith we need faith in our life am there is no other option God is not going to look at us and say you know what you're okay you're going to make it even without faith no power to lay down their lives for Christ no power to be faithful no power to press towards their Mark no power to love their enemies people are giving a new meaning to the word faithful we need a revelation you know what we need a revelation of this message we need a revelation of the word faithful amen amen we can honestly say that it's a real struggle trying to live by the faith of the son of man in this age so instead of struggling because our our faith is weak we need to be struggling to exercise the faith that we already have amen we need to struggle contend Jude said that we should earnestly contend or earnestly struggle for the faith that was once delivered now how many has received Faith amen all right we're going to go in and out of this this question because we want to provoke and stir up what's inside amen faith is a necessary substance for the believer amen yes sir Bible says for without it we can't we can't even please God Amen I mean think about it he that cometh to God must believe that he is and is a rewarder to them that diligently seek and when we approach God we need to have confidence when we're approaching him right amen because if we don't have confidence we're not going to get what we need need that's the truth amen now let me ask you a question how are you going to have confidence in approaching God when you haven't done what he's asked you to do right see then we find ourselves struggling why don't we have faith what's going on it's because we're not exercising what we should be exercising right amen now how do I exercise the faith I have when you know that you know that you know that you know that you know God told you something then be faithful to it amen amen yes sir amen because God is not obligated to give us anything else if we haven't done what he's already asked us to do and we're talking about building our faith God's goal for us is to have faith for all of our life amen amen not just for part his desire is that every believer has faith in him because without it we can't make him happy so I want you to think of your personal life God expects you to have faith in your personal life amen whatever is going on whatever the need is God does never put a a human being in a place that he stuck and didn't make a way of Escape our God is faithful amen amen often we remember the words that Jesus spoke to the people that had needs he says do you believe do you believe now these are people that are in desperation for God's help and and they come to Jesus in this desperation and Jesus is pausing this whole situation for a moment and he's asking for what he requires the same thing he requires of us amen do you believe many times we hear God speak through his Prophet when we listen to the tapes on the platform they come through and he would say Do you believe believe do you believe it's the requirement to getting anywhere with God is to believe did you know you could sit here in church hear the word of God being preached and never show your faith in God right that is the truth you could sit here hear the word of God and never have to show your faith but try approaching God in prayer and asking for him to meet a need and that if you don't have fa Faith so we don't want to sit here in church hear the word of God without faith to believe the word of God Amen we want to be activated I believe I believe I believe amen amen amen am without it we'll never get what we want that's true faith is the vehicle that gets us from point A to point B faith is what moves God it activates if I could say it like this it activates his end of the relationship amen you have a relationship with God you want God to do ABC and all these different things in your life Faith is what activates his end of the relationship to do it amen so if you don't do your part he won't do his part even though he loves you even though he cares if we don't have faith on our end we're not pleasing him to move on his end so there are many things that war against our faith that eat away our faith right we've heard of money being a necessary evil the love of money is the root of all evil yet we need money to live in this world right and I'll tell you if you're not living by your money you're living by somebody else's cuz you need money to Sur survive that's true without money you can't function yet to love it it's evil so we're showing that there's a a line that you and I are constantly have to come up to because you got to work to get money but you can't want it so much that you cross over amen that's right amen so to be motivated by a strong desire for money is the root of all evil all evil because money gets you what you want yet I see believers who don't seem to be motivated by a strong desire of Faith a strong desire to get Faith a strong desire to build Faith we'll put so much time into getting something that is natural true and will neglect or just expect to sit in church listen to a tape once in a while pray once in a while and and expect to get Faith to me that's laziness amen true it's not going to happen amen faith is the foundation of your relationship with God and we need to be building it because there's things that eat away our faith faith is necessary amen 1 Timothy 6:9 1 Timothy 6:9 but they that will be rich in other words who are determined to get something more will fall into temptation and a snare you know you come up to that line instead of just trusting God you you push yes and into many foolish and hurtful lust which drown men into destruction and predition amen for the love of money is the root of all evil which while some coveted after they go after it what happens they have aired from the faith they've aired from it they've gotten away from it and they've even pierced themselves with many Sorrows who in the world would want to take something and but they don't think about it see we don't think about that when the devil says oh you could have that you could have that money and faith can actually work against one another if you desire money too much the scripture tells you that you will Air from the faith amen the truth you'll end up piercing yourself with many Sorrows now another things that war against the flesh worldliness will eat away at your faith TV amen phones amen gossip amen focusing on constantly pleasing yourself getting what you want that's worldliness it will war against your faith carnality will eat away at your faith what do you mean carnality I mean just yielding to issues that you have in your life that you don't deal with anger issues thinking you're better than someone else isms and schisms having respect to persons wrong attitudes entitlement issues I deserve this will eat away at your faith a lack of feeding your faith is just a default that will eat away at your faith not reading the word with an open an honest heart like God show me what you want me to do not just having having someone to just beat it over your head because you're not Desiring it yourself not preparing our hearts with sincerity right you know I'm me to church that's better than I've been doing not preparing our hearts with sincerity not praying through until we get in touch or contact with the Holy Ghost amen God is a Spirit they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and truth so these things just by default start to eat away your faith and it just becomes a form of godliness how can we live by faith if we don't build our faith the scripture says that Paul was living by the faith of the son of man he lived by it now we we've all testified that I struggle having faith okay I'm okay with that I really am I'm not okay with not building am I'm not okay with not doing something to help ourselves build because we got to get to the place that we could live by the faith of the son of man live our lives our problems in our home on our jobs in our church and live by faith because that's what it's for amen the just shall live by faith we don't want Faith just when we need it right you know what I'm what I'm saying from disaster to disaster from turmoil to turmoil right we just got to live by faith amen be desperate for God all the time amen desire to please him all the time amen every day learning to live by faith may seem unattainable I want to say this it's easier than we think amen amen it is easier than we think and we're going to go through some practical things it's it's really just one thing that can be applied to so many areas of your life but there is Faith already in our heart we know that faith comes from God he's given all of us a measure now we can't manufacture faith is that right amen so when God ask do you believe he's not asking you to manufacture something you don't have he's asking you to believe what you already have inside of you to activate the faith that's already inside of you see Faith we're taught by Jesus that it's a real small it's very small and he typed it with the smallest of hers but yet it grows so big that the birds come in and they land there and they Lodge there so our faith no matter how small it may seem in our lives it can grow if we activate it if we start to put into practice what we need amen you can't sit here in church and just expect to see something see something that's going to activate you and feel like you want to believe more it don't work like that it didn't work like that for the children of Israel right they saw tons of Miracles more than I ever seen right it didn't get him through right amen if thou can't believe not if thou can't see get away from seeing seeing is in your heart Thomas is the one that you know I we can relate to Thomas I got to see it if I see it I'll have more faith with God's doing in the church come on what is wrong with you we should be further along than that no wonder we don't have faith in our own homes and our own lives too often we're looking for God to do something that's already inside of us wow it's already inside of us we've listened to the devil too much telling us that you don't have faith you don't have faith we've let too many things eat away at the strength of our faith how many here can say that God has spoken to me at one time or another amen come on okay who now how come the rest of you don't want to participate in this class how many can say now that God has spoken to you on multiple occasions let me see your hands okay now how many can say God speaks to your heart quite often think about this now when we hear God speak to us it produces a faith amen the Bible says so Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God not you reading the Bible or somebody reading the Bible to you but when God speaks it person to you that gives faith our own testimony is that we have faith but what happens is we're not activating it we're not exercising it we're not contending for it we're not using it to build the full potential in our lives we're really not taking Faith that's already inside of us and applying it every day in every issue we're not building off of it we're not building ourselves in the Most Holy Faith the building part the exercising the contending the using it we're lazy true we want to sit here and we want God to do some miracle in front of us that's going to make us shout and scream and and make us say oh yeah I believe God's here in the church or we want God to do something reckless in our home for us to say oh yeah God's in my home we're lazy amen faith is meant to be used in our lives on a regular basis not just when we get horrible situations hey we got to really pray for this I think we forget how important Faith really is amen God wants to see Faith used in their lives he wants want to see an operation to put to good use not left doormat right not left in the past God doesn't want to be identified as a god of the past he wants to be identified as a as the I am I am a present help in a time of trouble I am the way I am the truth I am the door I am I am the same yesterday today and forever so in order for that happen we've got to activate faith on a regular basis in our life well how do I do that doesn't seem I can I can ever attain anything well there are things in your life that you can be doing if you were just faithful to them why are we being faithful to those things now know there's not a person in this room but what is able to start living more by faith amen how many been born [Music] again every hand should go up then you have the ability to believe yes you have the ability to have faith you have the ability to exercise Faith muscles amen one time Jesus asked the question he says do you now believe do you now now believe there was a time in our life that we didn't believe why we were born with an unbelieving nature we were born in the Sin of unbelief Jesus said for if you believe not that I am he you shall die in your unbelief in your sin doubt is sin amen amen and we need to be born again to believe all the word amen now God had to do something to get our attention right he sent a prophet we got a hold of a book amen and we seen that we were attracted to this Prophet God sent them with gifts got our attention seen something that we never seen before and what did that Prophet do that prophet led us to the supernatural word amen he led us to the supernatural word and you know what most people did they got off the majority of them got off because people are attracted to gifts and not the word Jesus told of a certain rich man man who had died went to hell and was tormented there in the flames and he wanted Lazarus to give him a few drops of of water on his tongue you know the story but he couldn't because there was a great golf fixed between the two and so after he realized that he couldn't get any relief all a sudden he got a burden for his his brothers that were still uh a living and who still had a a chance to bypass hell and let's pick it up here Luke 16: 27 and then he said I pray thee therefore father that thou wouldest send him to my father's house for I have five brothers that they may testify that he that Lazarus would testify unto them lest they also come into this place of torment and Abraham saith unto him they have Moses and the prophets let them hear them in other words it should get the job done for salvation when you hear the word amen amen and look at this and he said no Abraham you're wrong but if one went unto them from the dead they will repent in other words they said if if they can see with their eyes the observation it will change them no I'm telling you that is is just the bait on the hook right amen it's not enough to change your nature you actually have to beli amen God requires belief and he said unto them if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will they be persuaded the one rose from the dead I've talked to people who have seen Miracles like this and believed for a portion but then fell away it does attract your attention there's no doubt about it people make some great things oh yeah I seen this but they fall away because faith is something meant to be built amen God didn't give you Faith to leave it a small mustard grain seed right he he expects it to grow our genuine faith has nothing to do with what we observe from our eyes we would think the a Believer we would think we would believe more if we saw more but it's not the case it's all about faith we're not going to be more spiritual if we see more miracles in our church right we're going to be more spiritual if we start believing what God has told us to do if we believe what would Jesus say I come here to do do my father's work what are the works of God that you believe on him who sent me we've got to believe the word that he has spoken to us I don't care if he's told you you need you need to do this one thing then you need to do that if he told you you need to pray faithful you need to start praying faithful if he told you to come to church faithful you need to start activating and coming to church Faithfully you think it don't have anything to do with the faith that you want for God to move this mountain out of your life but it does God is looking to see if you're going to be faithful with what he told you to do you've got to build that Faith you don't build that Faith by looking at some Mountain you look at the mountain you say oh my how am I going to get through that thing but when he says I want you just to start spending more time with me in in prayer well you can do that amen You' got faith to do that and it's being faithful to the things that you can do literally build your faith for the things you can't do that's how you build your faith that is practical that is something that's put in your hands that you can do amen we want something Supernatural to happen out here that that that we observe that we see that we think that we that we feel and God's given us his word amen when he speaks to you he gives you his word and he expects you to walk in it and if you're too lazy to walk in that don't expect God to meet every need in your life now I know you don't want to hear that but it's the truth we want to see God move in our lives we want to see God move in our church well we got to start being spiritual Believers and working with the work that he has told us to do amen m Miracles are only the bait that grab our attention did you know you all went fishing you know there's some fish out there they know how to get the bait off the hook and not get caught right you're reeled in and you say that little guy got my bait and there are believers who know how to just hang around right amen enjoy all the outside and not get hooked do you know the majority of the Believers followed Jesus for the Loaves and the fishes that's the truth right the majority of them selfish reasons in other words brother Braham said eventually they will fall away amen the word is what holds a person that's right the word not your word not the word of John Martin or some preacher it's the word of God that's what holds the believer Faith's final resting place is in the word now when he speaks to you that's the word amen it ain't no different he's alive you know the prophet taught us we just got to make sure that what he speaks to us lines up with what he's already spoken amen amen too often people just say well God spoke to me you know God told me this God told me that I'm this is going to happen and that's going to happen well my Bible tells me that I'm evil if I'm going to say this is what I'm going to do and that's where I'm going to go and this is what's going to happen Bible calls me evil amen he said I should the Lord willing this is going to happen this is going to that's going to happen so we've got to have our exercising line up with the word amen let's get hooked on the word amen I know it's boring doing the little things he asked you to do but the brand said the Christian reads his Bible and prays every day amen I know it's hard to get in the prayer closet and really pray through just seems like well there's so many distractions things are in my mind and problems of the day you know what start dealing with what you can do in your life amen because we're not going to bypass we're not going to bypass God God is brings us right down to the basics amen Jesus said everyone that is of Truth heareth my voice my sheep hear my voice and what do they do they follow the word they don't just say well yeah I believe it don't follow it right come on they just don't say Amen don't follow it that's a form of godliness you got to follow the word genuine belief must be on the word we must follow that word one reason we struggle with faith is that we're looking for big things to happen right if that big thing happens that'll energize my faith and I do believe that there's nothing too hard for God but but we need to believe for not just the big things but the little things it's easy to see discouragement take place on people's hearts when things aren't going right in their lives but Jesus makes this statement he that is faithful in little is going to be faithful in much amen so faithfulness here is being described as a character I want you to think about this faithfulness is the character is is a character that's molded by your choice faithfulness is not a gift you're not born with it well look at that person he's faithful oh God must have made him special I'm sorry that didn't happen well look at that person he's so lazy he couldn't do anything well God didn't make him that way you have a choice Amen to follow God's God's will or your own faithfulness is is a character molded by The Power of Choice it's you learning to make the tough decisions right that you know I I need to I you know prayer is more important than necessary sleep amen that's a it's a choice amen how much time have you been spending in the word saying God the reason I'm reading this word is because I need you to show me how to live better for you wow I want to know the last time you picked up the Bible with that you know we pick up the Bible looking for answers that God would direct me with this one situation well that's fine but God wants a relationship we need to be interested in following him amen am yes sir amen because that's all that's going to matter trth you got to choose to be faithful with the little things in your life we can do that there's not a person in here I don't care your age I don't care how young or How old if you get back because see the Bible says because iniquity abound the love of many would wax cold in the last days well the prophet taught us what iniquity was it's not doing the right things that you know you should be doing amen oh I don't need to do that it's not a big deal you know as long as I just make it to church that's all that matters that's iniquity that's coming to church with iniquity in the Bible identified Lucifer as one that filled the sanctuaries with iniquity convinced the people in the churches that they didn't have to follow the word and still go to church right well brother John this seems to be some pretty pretty strong preaching okay well look the devil preaches to us all day true all the time every time you choose to remain faithful to one of God's words you are manifesting a faith wow you may not think it is you may you know think it's a do a don't uh uh a have to a rule a regulation that it doesn't mean anything and it's not helping you with the overall picture that you're looking at but you're when you manifest Faith you're building faith and it's those little building blocks if you notice in that statue of a perfect man which we don't have in here but you've seen it out there faith is at the bottom and everything is built off of that so if Satan can deter at our faith we don't have much of a Christian walk amen so stop looking for the big things to happen in your life to say you believe right amen call the devil out and say I'm a believer I'm faithful to what he's given me to do you know Jesus said Can anyone condemn me of unbelief he did right who can condemn me of sin he believed the word amen H if you want to see God big time in your life learn to be faithful with the little things he's asked you to do activate faith in the things that you can do yes sir you may not better to raise the dead but you can raise your hands and praise the Lord amen you may not be able to speak to thousands of people but you can go speak to one person about Christen you may not be able to read the Bible to thousands of Believers but you can read it more to your family amen come on there's things that you can be doing that activate faith and you know what happens when you begin to be more faithful with the things that you can do your faith increases it does hey I am sorry the children of Israel I know some of you are wrestling with this thing and I don't know why the children of Israel when they came up to the promised land Joshua didn't perform a bunch of miracles in front of them it's true to try to get them to believe or I should say Moses at that time he didn't they seen enough Miracles they seen what every time you're reading about this incident Old Testament or new testament God is saying I they proved my works these many years and these 10 times and they proved me they proved me I was faithful to them I showed them I had power to to give them food to give them water to to heal their sick bodies I prove to them that I am God am now believe me to take the land and they wouldn't do it they perished in their unbelief look God we've got to believe for the rest of our journey amen we've already been attracted we've he's already got our attention we already believe the message we already know where we stand now start walking forward tell the children of Israel to go forward amen believe be faithful with what you can do you don't think it's important to be faithful to church but it is am yes sir you don't think it's Faith it's important to to pray continuously without ceasing to make sure you're praying in the spirit but it is important to God how do you expect God to give you what you want when you won't give him what you can wow God don't want to be used come on I'm going to have a relationship with you with Brother Mark pick on you and I'm going to ask Mark to do this for me do that for me give me this let me borrow that let me have your C don't give it back and he asked me hey can I and I say no way I'm too busy I got too many problems going on in my life oh I'm going to tell you just naturally you or Mark isn't going to want to have a relationship with me how do we expect God who we know loves his enemies right perfect in nature but say yeah I want to be married to somebody like that he doesn't right right he did he he did he didn't he didn't marry 1.8 million people that came out of Egypt right even though he loved them even though he said they're my people even though he he blessed them for 40 years your shoes didn't wear out and so many great things happen right look God has the final say so he requires you to believe all the word we got to start activating the faith that we know start being faithful to the things that we can do amen so we can believe for the things that seem to be mountains in our life God is looking for character amen so only that we're taking with us God is looking for us to have faith in the little things that we often Overlook things like that that seem that are not necessary as I've spoken before Small Things unseen things by others the things that seems that sometimes we just we don't even want to do things like prayer when the scripture says that men always ought to pray and Fain you ever wonder why you're weak try thinking big probably a big reason is you haven't been praying right that's true build yourself up in the Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost prayer is usually the very cause of it things like esteeming others better than yourself amen things like loving others and living for others amen things like self-denial yes these are things that you can do things like having our hearts more prepared before we come into the sanctuary it's a little sacrifice don't you think Amen brother Mark are you agreeing with me on that amen yes sir amen things like being faithful to church order amen you've been taught things like paying your tithes amen things like searching the scriptures to know how to please God better amen things like a good attitude amen that's a it's a you know that is such a small thing a good attitude a right attitude it's a small thing that makes a big difference it makes such a big difference that brother B makes a statement that the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass that yet we put such little emphasis on it it doesn't matter what attitude I have toward you well you know the attit atude you have towards me don't you rem don't ever forget this it's the same attitude you have towards God Amen that's right that's the truth your thoughts speak louder in heaven than your words do down here look these are small things that make a big difference to your faith amen Satan has got the so many people to deteriorate their own faith inside of them but they can't get away from the message they know the message is right but I I I think this message needs to be vibrant in our life I I think we should just be happy living for one another amen amen happy loving one another encouraging one another looking for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ beloved when I gave all diligence to write unto you of the Comm salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and to exhort you that you should earnestly contend for the faith that was once delivered and says I want to ask this question do you think do you think that 1.8 million that came out of Egypt do you think they thought they were going to hell no no so we can't go by well I know I'm going to have that's right and I'm not trying to challenge your salvation what I am trying to do is get you to act like Joshua and Caleb believe for the rest of the promise [Music] amen the rest of the promise you know this thing about the promised land being the Holy Ghost the promised land is the Holy Ghost but I want to I want to go a step further it's entering into the holiest of holies it's where God is in you because that the holy ghost coming in you and you're into the holiest of holies where God has total possession of your life you're living by the faith of the son of man now you're not living by your faith anymore that's what we should be striving to get to faith gets us into the promised land amen the children of Israel were scared they were filled with fear do you know what that fear did it led them to murmur complain be bothered be slothful be lazy uh I should have just you know we should have just stayed back in the world that was all because they feared now what Joshua and Caleb they didn't fear they believed in God for a person to say we're more than able to take this land when naturally it couldn't be done naturally it couldn't be done just grasshoppers they had to look to the God who was able to make it happen right amen yes sir amen just like job had to look to to the God who he was in love with though he slay me yet why trust him no fear no fear right perfect love casteth out all fear now the perfect love is your relationship with God I don't care how small the an insignificant this may seem this message this is a building block to grow your faith amen I want you to look at your life I want you to think about the things God has asked you to do that you thought was not that big a deal it may be just as simple as where your heart is at when you're at in the sanctuary be faithful and God will do the rest am amen exercise your faith exercise your faith be faithful to small things if we're not faithful to those small things we're showing God that we're not exercising we're lazy you know we're you know how how's the Bible say there in Galatians H have you started out in the you started out by believing how you now made perfect without Believing by works we got to keep exercising Faith you know it you know you you may just feel bad and down and had a bad day and after church you need to go up to some and say praise the Lord God bless you my brother I love you exercise your faith amen there's so many things you can do to exercise your faith that are in your power don't be lazy start doing them amen you know you've heard the story how many times have you done something for somebody and it made you feel that you feel good that you did it for them just the fact that you did something for somebody and it made you feel good well when you do something for somebody it's actually the will of God you're living for others well God's going to build your faith with that it might be only be you can't live off of that no but it is something it's just an example to show you did anybody pray for uh 45 minutes and just worship God in your prayer and got done after 45 minutes and said you know that was a waste a time never no you don't but if you pray about 8 minutes and you don't worship you don't get into his presence you may get up and say well I'm glad that's over with I'm going on with the day see but if you do if you lay neighbor for 45 minutes and you still don't get your answer you feel better because you know you did the will of God and these little things that we think are not important they're important to God they're really important to God I'd like to see us Prosper oh this is so far off my notes but let's go to Psalms 1 yes Psalms 1 I mean faith will get us to Prosperity now I don't mean natural Prosperity right blessed is the man that walketh not in the councel of the wrong way nor standeth in the same place that Sinners stand in nor sth in the seat of just being negative right man I don't want to sit in that seat but his Delight is in the law of the Lord this word is where his Delight is at and in this word doth he meditate day and night and he shall be like a tree Hallelujah planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit in his season and his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper now I didn't know this but uh George Washington this was his favorite Psalms and he had it at his eration and just in a many different of his ceremonies he had this Psalms read and they asked him and says well why do you like this Psalm so much and he said because of the promise the promise the promise if you're faithful in little you'll be faithful in much amen if you have faith to believe in the things that you can do I will give you faith faith for the things that you can't do right now and you know it's going to be that same Faith just built bigger see the faith is already inside of you amen amen but if we don't tap into that building of the faith build up yourself in the Most Holy Faith let's Stand Together God bless you so instead of struggling to have faith let's struggle to build our faith amen through being faithful press in to be more faithful take heed to the things that God has spoken to you don't let them slip don't just pray more practice to pray in the Holy Ghost yes sir amen contend for the faith earnestly fight for the Holy Ghost struggle to enter in now want you're there ask God God what would you have me to do amen let's sing that little course have faith in God have faith in God have faith in God have faith in God for for the answer have faith in God have faith in God have faith in God have faith in God for the answer have faith in God have faith in God have faith in God have faith in God for the answer have faith in God one more time have faith in God have faith in God have faith in God for the answer have faith in God Amen if you would continue to play that real quietly if I could get everyone to just bow your your heads and close your eyes just for a moment I'm sure we all have unanswered prayers and needs that we would like to see God meet but my question to each of us today this question goes to to me as well are there things in your life that God has asked you to do but you have let them slip to the side and haven't been putting much emphasis on things and God has reminded you of that today the importance of taking care of those things you want strength to do the small things in your life lift up your hands and I'm I'm going to unite in prayer with you God bless all these hands amen just almost anonimous in this room amen hallelujah let's believe now as we approach him in prayer with faith Heavenly Father we thank you for calling us to be like you are faithful when you addressed all those that you had given gifts to in that Parable the ones that exercised what they had to make more you said Well Done thou good and faithful servant Lord we know your bride will be faithful and Lord you're calling us as your bride to be more faithful with the things that you've given us to do and Lord as we stand here as a group Lord as a body of Believers we ask that you would forgive us for not being faithful more faithful to the things that we could have been taking care of all along forgive us for getting discouraged because of our our situations Lord forgive us for letting the wrong things into our life and and eating away at our Faith forgive us Lord for expecting other people and other things to increase our faith when Lord you've already given us that Faith you've already given us that seat of Faith inside of us and now Lord I pray for your people that when they leave here with the mindset of being more faithful to the little things that you've told them to do no matter how much they may think it don't make a difference may may they tell the Devil he's a liar may they know that it is important to you to do those small things and I pray father that as we do those things Lord that our faith muscles would increase to believe for even greater things in our life father because I believe Lord that you want to use every one of us to build your kingdom to help others that don't have what we have and I pray God that you would multiply increase Lord the strength inside of us for your word says they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up as as as as eagles they shall be they they they'll be strong and be able to to Fly Above these things that are holding so many people down God we thank you for the Simplicity of your word we thank you Lord that we have found you in the Simplicity of your word this morning and father now we're trusting to find you when we leave the building today Lord that we'll find you in the days before us when we have when you when you bring to our remembrance Lord something you you want us to do help us Lord just to be to make that choice to be faithful to it and to walk in it and God I pray that you would just Blossom every believer strengthen every believer May there come forth testimonies in their own family of the things that you're doing because they're walking more faithful to you Lord thank you for these things we love you and give you the praise and the honor for them all for we ask it in Jesus Christ precious name thank you Lord Jesus amen let's just thank the Lord for it thank you Lord Jesus amen I believe in prayer the Bible says when two agree on touching any one thing it will be established amen I want to sing this song My Faith looks up to thee my faithless looks up to thee now lamb of calary Savior Divine now hear me while I pray take all my guilt away oh let me from this day be holy th May thy Rich Grace impart strength to my fainting heart my Zeal in Sp as thou has died for me oh May My Love To Thee pure warm and changes be a living FL while lies dark maze I tread and greas all around me spread be thou my God be Darkness turned today wi s Rose tears away nor let me ever stray from the aide when ends life Tren a dream when death's cold soul and stream shall or me roll bless savior then in love fear and distrust remove oh bear me save Above All grandom Soul
