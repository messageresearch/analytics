[35:59] uh ron had said we want to welcome all
[36:02] of our
[36:03] our our visitors and um
[36:07] so good to have brother marty and sister
[36:09] kathleen
[36:10] back not they've been with us
[36:13] every time in spirit
[36:17] but to have them with us it's a
[36:21] great blessing it's a great blessing for
[36:24] me
[36:26] they've been so faithful to pray for the
[36:29] ministry here for so many years
[36:33] and you can just count on them just
[36:36] and it has been
[36:39] an encouragement to me when i've been
[36:43] discouraged brother john you've been
[36:45] discouraged
[36:49] well for me to stand here and say that i
[36:51] am not mortal
[36:53] why would you even want to listen to me
[36:58] so we appreciate them very much
[37:01] well i don't know if you got the
[37:03] announcement but there's going to be a
[37:04] baptism
[37:06] and let me say there's going to be a
[37:07] number of baptisms
[37:10] next sunday at at least three
[37:14] amen but there may be more
[37:18] so let's pray amen that'll be at the
[37:22] pond
[37:25] at three o'clock give your time to eat
[37:28] praise god brother stan
[37:29] so good to see you amen
[37:33] amen that's what brother brown always
[37:35] says good to be seen
[37:38] while the one prerequisite for baptism
[37:41] is what
[37:43] repentance very important remember
[37:46] baptism does not put away the filth of
[37:49] our flesh
[37:51] it's an outward expression of really
[37:54] what's transpiring on the inside of the
[37:56] heart
[37:58] so repentance really has to do with the
[38:00] heart
[38:01] not the brain not what you think not
[38:04] what you're wearing
[38:06] but what's happening on the inside
[38:10] the heart tells the brain i want to
[38:13] start having
[38:13] a real relationship with god
[38:18] repentance is from the heart because god
[38:20] has been working on the heart
[38:21] and showing us to turn around turn our
[38:24] lives
[38:25] around so i want to say for those that
[38:28] are getting baptized
[38:30] ponder and pray about the things that
[38:34] are in your heart
[38:36] it will go a long ways in preparing the
[38:40] heart
[38:42] and that is it is so important so
[38:44] important because
[38:45] everybody that's been baptized looks
[38:47] back to the day that they were baptized
[38:50] many many many times
[38:54] it's like a steak and it's
[38:57] it's uh you know that you did it and you
[39:00] meant it with all your heart
[39:02] that's right amen
[39:05] our subject this morning is wisdom
[39:10] most all people have some wisdom
[39:15] but as we've learned we need more
[39:21] and most of us have come to church
[39:27] with our with our wisdom
[39:32] today we want to talk about a couple of
[39:34] different wisdoms
[39:38] unfortunately the wisdom that most
[39:39] people operate by automatically comes
[39:41] from an
[39:42] evil nature that we're born with and
[39:44] it's with us
[39:46] until we're out of here
[39:50] to see wisdom in action all the time
[39:54] people
[39:59] we we want to see wisdom
[40:02] we we we want to see it in action
[40:06] and from time to time we have seen
[40:09] people use wisdom but more often
[40:13] than that we've seen people not use
[40:16] wisdom
[40:18] [Music]
[40:20] i remember brother bruce young
[40:23] in the lord and we were in bible
[40:25] tabernacle downstairs and i
[40:29] i'll never forget watching brother
[40:31] johnson dealing with a very difficult
[40:33] person
[40:37] and uh this person was being fearful and
[40:42] and and uh not just the right
[40:45] spirit and and the wisdom of god was in
[40:48] demonstration before me
[40:51] and i don't know who seen it who didn't
[40:53] but i saw it
[40:55] and at that moment i thought to myself
[40:59] if i could just have 10 percent of the
[41:02] wisdom that this man has
[41:04] i will be ever grateful for it amen
[41:11] the wisdom of this world
[41:14] and the wisdom that we operate by a lot
[41:17] it's a natural wisdom
[41:19] it manipulates it's very deceptive
[41:24] it's crafty it's cunning
[41:27] it's always trying to work schemes
[41:31] basically the wisdom of that we're born
[41:34] with it lacks
[41:35] character people
[41:38] use it to get ahead in business
[41:43] often used on family members to
[41:46] to get what you want out of something
[41:49] we've all seen it used on tv shows
[41:52] this wisdom well if we do this and do
[41:54] this we can manipulate the situation
[41:55] this way that person will do that and
[41:57] we'll get what we want and i'll say i
[41:59] have seen
[41:59] this wisdom you so much in the church
[42:02] and people don't even realize it
[42:04] that they're using it they think it's
[42:06] god
[42:11] it's a dog eat dog mentality climb
[42:14] over others use them manipulate them
[42:17] but the end game is to get what you want
[42:20] that's with the wisdom
[42:21] that this world gives you worldly wisdom
[42:24] is the power to manipulate without the
[42:28] character
[42:29] to truly trust god to take care of it
[42:34] that's the john martin definition
[42:37] remember cain used worldly wisdom
[42:41] to get rid of abel so that god would
[42:44] have to accept him
[42:48] if you call yourself a christian then
[42:50] you need
[42:53] to serve me how many times we've seen
[42:55] that people
[42:57] know that christians are supposed to
[42:58] serve everybody
[43:01] so they come and they manipulate you
[43:04] that you have to do something for them
[43:07] to hold up to your end of the the the
[43:10] the deal of you being what you call
[43:12] yourself a christian then
[43:14] you need to serve me you need to give
[43:16] this to me you need to
[43:17] do things for me
[43:21] that is worldly wisdom
[43:26] instead of holding themselves
[43:28] accountable to the word
[43:31] right the word says if you just seek
[43:33] first the kingdom everything else will
[43:34] be added but since you can't trust the
[43:36] lord
[43:37] since you're not putting him first then
[43:38] you begin to manipulate with your
[43:40] worldly wisdom
[43:41] [Music]
[43:43] a lot of times people don't have a close
[43:45] enough relationship with god to trust
[43:47] them
[43:48] so they use others to get their knees
[43:50] met
[43:52] it's nothing but worldly wisdom
[43:57] often times religious leaders and
[44:00] lawyers
[44:01] in the in the scriptures would use
[44:03] worldly wisdom
[44:04] to try and manipulate jesus
[44:08] amen many many times never to any veil
[44:12] right you can't pull a fast one by god
[44:18] first corinthians chapter 3 verse 18.
[44:21] let no man deceive himself
[44:26] if any man among you seem to be wise
[44:29] in this world let him become a fool
[44:32] that he may be wise for the wisdom of
[44:35] this world
[44:36] is foolishness with god for it is
[44:39] written he taketh the wise
[44:41] in their own craftiness and again the
[44:44] lord knoweth the thoughts of the wise
[44:47] that they are vain
[44:50] so the wisdom that comes from our first
[44:53] nature is really nothing to brag about
[44:57] let's take paul's advice and become a
[45:00] fool
[45:02] that we may be wise
[45:06] one time bailout he was the king of the
[45:09] moabites
[45:11] he was really stressed out honey has
[45:13] ever been stressed out before
[45:14] well then you can relate to bala
[45:18] he feared israel was going to take over
[45:21] and he
[45:21] was going to be out of control so in a
[45:24] desperate
[45:24] intent to regain control you ever been
[45:26] desperate to regain control of the
[45:28] situation
[45:29] he sends messengers to balaam to bail
[45:31] him out
[45:33] now balaam had a gift in his life like
[45:36] we all do
[45:38] we have all have some sort of gifts in
[45:40] our life
[45:42] like lucifer the problem with balaam was
[45:45] he wanted to make a market
[45:47] for his gift he wanted to benefit
[45:51] from the gift that god had given him
[45:54] the old nature likes using the gift that
[45:58] god has given them
[46:00] for their own fleshly benefits their own
[46:02] personal gain
[46:04] what god gave you is not
[46:08] to be shared with your glory
[46:11] it is for god's glory it's between
[46:15] you and god to be used for god you might
[46:17] also forget about
[46:19] all the attention being about yourself
[46:21] with the gift that god's given you it
[46:23] was never meant for that
[46:25] now when you've got time there's going
[46:27] to be about five scriptures that i'm
[46:29] going to give you to read because we
[46:31] just do not have time to go into them
[46:33] but
[46:33] you can read about this story in numbers
[46:36] 22
[46:37] right and you may want to read a couple
[46:40] chapters after that but balaam he wanted
[46:43] the permissive
[46:44] will of god
[46:49] because god gave him a straight up
[46:51] answer
[46:52] to not go
[47:00] he was he could not trust the lord
[47:04] so his his whole ability was being able
[47:07] to control the situation through worldly
[47:10] wisdom
[47:12] so he offered
[47:16] a reward
[47:20] and you know you'll be my friend if you
[47:22] just like me
[47:24] a reward he offered a reward
[47:28] to get
[47:31] what he wanted which was control
[47:34] might be money it can be a lot of things
[47:37] that we can
[47:38] the devil would like to offer to gain
[47:41] control
[47:42] see the devil does not want god and
[47:44] control this church
[47:47] no sir laodicea they kicked out god
[47:50] man is in control of the worldly church
[47:53] today
[47:56] they're in need of nothing attitude
[48:01] but each time that balaam spoke
[48:04] against israel he never could speak
[48:08] against israel he could only bless
[48:12] how can you curse what god has blessed
[48:15] and this
[48:16] affiliated balak and he just all the
[48:19] more
[48:22] was angry and frustrated with the
[48:24] situation because he didn't have control
[48:26] and he's
[48:27] let no i'll give you everything i'll
[48:28] give you honor i'll let you be the main
[48:30] cheese
[48:33] so he's handed everything that he could
[48:37] and balaam wanted honor so bad
[48:42] he wanted others to look up at him so
[48:44] bad
[48:45] that he used his own worldly wisdom
[48:48] to get it instead of god's wisdom
[48:53] he taught and counseled others
[48:56] what to do in order to get what he
[48:58] wanted
[49:01] he taught others how to get what they
[49:04] want
[49:06] god was out of the picture
[49:10] completely they were both united
[49:14] together in scrutinizing to get what
[49:16] they wanted
[49:17] and each what they wanted was not what
[49:20] god wanted
[49:23] they were missing an important
[49:24] ingredient it is the fear of the lord
[49:26] today
[49:28] that's what they were missing
[49:34] turn with me if you would to james
[49:36] chapter 3
[49:37] verse 13. we want to talk a little bit
[49:40] about the difference between natural
[49:41] wisdom and godly wisdom
[49:44] we want about to see clearly because we
[49:46] think
[49:47] wisdom is just wisdom
[49:54] every parent how many every every parent
[49:57] has said this at one time or another if
[49:58] they've had children
[50:00] of course parents have children so that
[50:02] was kind of silly thing to say
[50:06] i went by and i seen this sign the other
[50:09] day and the sign said
[50:11] estate sale by owner
[50:16] and i thought well i don't like those as
[50:18] much i like the estate sales that are
[50:20] not by the owners you get better deals
[50:26] i was also driving just two days ago i
[50:29] looked at my rear view mirror
[50:31] and everyone the family inside the car
[50:34] every one of them had masks on
[50:36] and it was so thankful that i was in my
[50:38] car because
[50:39] i wouldn't want to be in that car
[50:45] james chapter 3 verse 13 who is a wise
[50:49] man and endued with knowledge among you
[50:53] well we'd all want to stand up and say
[50:55] brother john
[50:56] that is me
[51:00] well look what you got to do to do that
[51:02] to claim that
[51:03] let him show out of a good conversation
[51:06] his
[51:07] works with meekness of wisdom
[51:12] but if ye have bitter envion
[51:17] strife in your hearts glory not
[51:21] and lie not against the truth
[51:25] this wisdom descendeth not from above
[51:29] but is earthly worldly central
[51:32] natural devilish for where
[51:36] envion and strife is there is confusion
[51:40] and every evil work
[51:45] any type of jealousy any type of
[51:48] negativity
[51:50] having to talk bad about someone
[51:53] thinking wrong thoughts about someone
[51:56] natural worldly wisdom is filled with
[52:00] drama
[52:03] how can i rearrange this situation
[52:06] to get what i'm looking for
[52:10] even if what you're looking for
[52:13] is better than what is happening
[52:19] you don't want to use worldly wisdom to
[52:21] get it
[52:24] you want the wisdom from above yes
[52:29] the wisdom that's from above is first
[52:32] pure then peaceable
[52:36] it's gentle easy to be treated full of
[52:39] mercy and good fruits without partiality
[52:41] without hypocrisy
[52:43] and the fruit of righteousness is sown
[52:45] of them that make peace
[52:49] the natural wisdom of this world
[52:51] manipulates
[52:52] and is often associated with confusion
[52:56] but godly wisdom is first pure
[53:00] in other words it doesn't have any mixed
[53:02] motives
[53:04] it's purely simple it's simply pure
[53:08] if i could say it like that i mean if
[53:11] you want a glass of water
[53:13] and you're hot and thirsty and but you
[53:16] don't want it
[53:18] mixed with something you just want pure
[53:20] water
[53:22] and if you have a chance to get pure
[53:25] water
[53:27] or something that's just kind of been
[53:31] sitting out for a long time what are you
[53:32] going to grab
[53:37] so you don't want to mix
[53:44] you don't want to have mixed motives you
[53:46] don't want to mix
[53:47] the wisdom of god with your wisdom you
[53:49] don't want to have both of them
[53:51] try to simultaneously working together
[53:54] because they won't god just separate
[53:56] from it
[53:57] brother branham told us to always check
[54:00] our motive to make sure we want to make
[54:04] sure it's not mixed
[54:06] because a lot of the times we can look
[54:08] at our our situation and we
[54:10] we look at our heart and our motives and
[54:12] we say well i know my my heart's right
[54:14] my my mother's right i can just
[54:15] because this is why i'm doing it but
[54:17] you're not being you're not being honest
[54:20] and careful enough to look at the rest
[54:21] of your heart and the rest of your
[54:23] motives
[54:25] how many times you talk to somebody is
[54:26] that
[54:28] i'm usually picking on for the mark but
[54:31] you go to someone and you say yeah i
[54:33] really
[54:33] you know like that shirt and you know
[54:35] you're doing good with this and that but
[54:37] you know the real reason i'm trying to
[54:38] talk to you is because i want to get
[54:39] something out of you
[54:42] so you see part of your motive is good
[54:44] i'm trying to be nice i'm i'm saying
[54:47] something i'm trying to
[54:48] make it connect but then there's
[54:50] something else involved
[54:52] there so it's not pure
[54:56] think about this we operate by worldly
[54:58] wisdom
[54:59] so much more than godly wisdom
[55:04] and what's important about this is
[55:06] you've got to get rid of the one
[55:07] amen amen godly wisdom is always
[55:12] peaceable it's always
[55:14] making peace
[55:17] there's no hidden agenda it's never
[55:20] trying to
[55:21] manipulate the situation it's just
[55:24] peaceable
[55:26] you don't feel attacked or uncomfortable
[55:30] around godly wisdom it's gentle
[55:34] it's easy to be entreated instead of
[55:37] judging others with our natural worldly
[55:40] wisdom godly wisdom is full of mercy
[55:43] full of good fruits instead of
[55:47] singling out somebody godly wisdom is
[55:49] without partiality
[55:52] no respect to persons no no hypocrisy
[55:59] godly wisdom is from heaven
[56:04] and you cannot mix it
[56:07] with your wisdom as soon as you do
[56:10] you pollute it
[56:16] worldly wisdom is not just going to get
[56:18] rid of
[56:19] your wisdom
[56:23] god says you got to get rid of your
[56:24] worldly wisdom first and then i'll fill
[56:26] you
[56:28] yes god god needs you
[56:32] wants you expects you to choose him
[56:35] first amen
[56:39] the only wisdom that we're born with is
[56:41] a sneaky
[56:42] conniving devilish wisdom that we use to
[56:45] deceive others
[56:48] i cannot recall the first time that i
[56:51] deceived my parents
[56:56] i was so young when it happened
[57:00] the strange thing is that my parents did
[57:02] not send me to schooling to know how to
[57:04] do this
[57:07] and they didn't set me down and say
[57:10] this is how i'm going to deceive you
[57:17] but they would say
[57:21] if you do your chores i'll let you stay
[57:25] up an extra half hour
[57:30] that was we used worldly wisdom to try
[57:33] to make it in this life
[57:37] it's not always pure
[57:41] well i'm brother mark just be for a
[57:45] moment pretend you're my child for a
[57:47] second
[57:49] you did wrong and i'm gonna spank you
[57:52] i'm so
[57:53] mad at you wait
[57:57] you shouldn't spank me be out of
[58:00] anger i'm not i'm spanking you because
[58:03] you did wrong
[58:05] but really i'm still mad on the inside
[58:10] see mixed motive mixed wisdom
[58:14] as it were confusion
[58:17] child should not be confused about
[58:19] correction
[58:21] the church should not be confused about
[58:23] correction
[58:25] [Applause]
[58:28] the yeah the naya's name i'll tell you
[58:30] what brings confusion
[58:31] is wrongly wisdom why is it so hard to
[58:35] leave here
[58:36] and take the word of god with you why do
[58:38] we sit here and debate well i don't know
[58:40] if i should have to do that that's just
[58:42] john's opinion
[58:43] that's confusion that's real worldly
[58:46] wisdom
[58:47] we're missing the fear of the lord amen
[58:52] i want to say this morning even though
[58:54] we were born with that wisdom
[58:56] the good news is that god has some godly
[58:59] wisdom for us this morning
[59:01] it's from above it's not partial about
[59:04] sharing with anyone there's no respect
[59:06] to persons
[59:07] the bible says annie turn with me to
[59:10] james chapter one verse five if
[59:12] any of you lack wisdom is lacking wisdom
[59:15] maybe see your hands
[59:22] if any of you lack wisdom let him ask of
[59:26] god that giveth to all
[59:29] men liberally and upbraideth not and it
[59:34] shall be given
[59:35] him now there's the promise you don't
[59:37] have to be going to this church
[59:40] to get wisdom
[59:44] not sure many churches will teach what
[59:46] true wisdom is
[59:48] but know for sure that if you're lacking
[59:52] wisdom and you want it
[59:54] god will hand it out
[1:00:00] one important criteria about receiving
[1:00:03] godly wisdom
[1:00:05] is stated in verse six
[1:00:08] we need to stay the course of our
[1:00:11] pursuit for
[1:00:12] but let him ask in faith not wavering
[1:00:16] for he that wavereth is like a wave of
[1:00:19] the sea
[1:00:20] driven with the wind and tossed for let
[1:00:22] not that man think that he shall receive
[1:00:24] anything of lord not just wisdom but
[1:00:27] anything
[1:00:28] of the lord for a double-minded man
[1:00:31] is unstable in every single
[1:00:34] thing
[1:00:38] so we've got to have confidence that god
[1:00:41] wants you
[1:00:42] to have it you can't be
[1:00:45] questioned at times whether you're going
[1:00:46] to get it or not because
[1:00:48] you failed or messed up or this thing
[1:00:51] happened
[1:00:51] or you're not good enough
[1:00:55] none of us are good enough
[1:00:58] none of us are worthy enough
[1:01:02] none of us have passed some sort of test
[1:01:05] whereby we can
[1:01:07] be acceptable to god
[1:01:17] you've got to not only ask in faith
[1:01:20] but you can't waver back and forth after
[1:01:23] you've asked for it
[1:01:25] you've got to stay the course you've got
[1:01:27] to remember your prayer
[1:01:30] remember your pursuit wisdom will come
[1:01:33] if you want it bad enough
[1:01:36] but if you don't want it bad enough or
[1:01:39] if you
[1:01:40] think you know a pretty good guy i think
[1:01:42] i can i got pretty good wisdom right now
[1:01:47] the devil will never pursue
[1:01:50] god's wisdom
[1:01:54] why are you saying that because the
[1:01:56] wisdom
[1:01:58] that's inside of us that we were born
[1:02:00] with
[1:02:02] isn't that interested in
[1:02:05] god's wisdom it thinks it can handle
[1:02:09] life
[1:02:10] good enough the devil's wisdom
[1:02:14] is proud forward arrogant
[1:02:17] and while god's wisdom is humble it's
[1:02:20] sweet
[1:02:21] it's gentle the devil's wisdom
[1:02:26] started the whole mess in the garden
[1:02:29] when he told
[1:02:32] eve what she could get out of the
[1:02:35] situation
[1:02:36] if she just followed
[1:02:40] the nature of worldly wisdom
[1:02:45] instead of god's wisdom
[1:02:52] worldly wisdom has gotten all of us
[1:02:55] here in this room in so much trouble in
[1:02:57] the past
[1:03:01] worldly wisdom tells the church world
[1:03:04] that they can make it
[1:03:05] to heaven without following all the word
[1:03:10] as long as they do this and this and
[1:03:12] this then they're saved
[1:03:16] worldly wisdom will make a man leave
[1:03:19] church
[1:03:19] critical arrogant
[1:03:24] bothered who is he to tell me
[1:03:27] look the way he made me feel he can't be
[1:03:29] a
[1:03:30] right that's worldly wisdom
[1:03:35] worldly wisdom will make a man think
[1:03:38] he's better than somebody else
[1:03:43] remember the two men that went into the
[1:03:45] prayer room together to pray
[1:03:50] one was just thanking god that he was
[1:03:51] not like the other
[1:03:56] that he could prove by his life
[1:04:00] that he was better amen
[1:04:04] but that was just a worldly wisdom
[1:04:08] the other one knew he was just
[1:04:11] unworthy without god he was nothing amen
[1:04:15] now that's the wisdom from above amen
[1:04:20] the devil's wisdom is as we've heard
[1:04:22] before
[1:04:23] prouder than a peacock
[1:04:27] the wisdom of god is so humble that most
[1:04:29] people miss it
[1:04:32] it's hidden simplicity and there's a
[1:04:36] great battle
[1:04:38] when we come to church
[1:04:41] it's the two wisdoms that are going
[1:04:43] inside of every one of us
[1:04:47] we maybe come in
[1:04:50] with oh i'm so much i want the word i'm
[1:04:53] just so
[1:04:54] geared up i'm i'm just going to praise
[1:04:56] the lord i'm so happy about church i'm
[1:04:57] going to come in
[1:04:58] and we hear the word and it kind of like
[1:05:02] deals with your heart
[1:05:08] and all sudden worldly wisdom pops its
[1:05:11] head up and says
[1:05:12] yes and then also there's that battle
[1:05:21] and one way to get rid of it is just
[1:05:23] pitch it off pitch it off on somebody
[1:05:25] else
[1:05:27] sorry christine pitch it off and
[1:05:29] somebody else
[1:05:30] mark can take my pitching
[1:05:38] the wisdom of god is always trying to
[1:05:41] get
[1:05:41] each one of us to humble ourselves to
[1:05:44] believe the word
[1:05:48] our natural wisdom can act haughty
[1:05:52] and arrogant and proud because it don't
[1:05:56] need to receive what's being said
[1:06:00] that i don't even need to be here
[1:06:07] you're blessed just because of my
[1:06:08] presence
[1:06:15] our natural wisdom has to understand
[1:06:18] it and agree with something before we'll
[1:06:21] believe it
[1:06:22] [Applause]
[1:06:26] in other words it leans to its own
[1:06:30] understanding
[1:06:32] when you get time read matthew chapter
[1:06:34] four
[1:06:36] and see these two wisdoms battled
[1:06:39] together as jesus and the devil
[1:06:41] the devil's wisdom reasons
[1:06:45] with natural feelings
[1:06:48] that's what he tried to do he tried to
[1:06:50] get jesus to
[1:06:52] to to to look at his feelings
[1:06:56] how he was feeling hungry or to reason
[1:07:00] with the word to get
[1:07:03] what he wanted while godly wisdom stays
[1:07:07] with the word it believes the word in
[1:07:09] order to get what god wants see
[1:07:11] your feelings will lean to your own
[1:07:14] understanding
[1:07:17] it will lean worldly wisdom wants you to
[1:07:20] lean
[1:07:20] towards natural feelings and
[1:07:22] understandings for what reason
[1:07:23] to get what you want
[1:07:28] and god wants you to look to the word
[1:07:31] trust him believe him
[1:07:34] to get what god wants
[1:07:38] one is what what we want and two is the
[1:07:40] other is what god wants
[1:07:44] it is the devil's wisdom
[1:07:48] versus the faith in god
[1:07:52] another place you can read is in second
[1:07:54] kings chapter five write that down
[1:07:57] with naaman naaman was using
[1:08:00] his wisdom i thought god would come and
[1:08:02] do this and do it this way and
[1:08:04] if i really have to do any why can't i
[1:08:07] go to the clean waters
[1:08:09] his own understanding but then he had a
[1:08:13] servant
[1:08:14] that was so humble he was a servant
[1:08:17] servants are humble that's why they
[1:08:19] serve
[1:08:21] and he had the wisdom that's from above
[1:08:24] wouldn't it be better just to believe
[1:08:26] the word
[1:08:29] just follow what the word says yes
[1:08:33] and when you do it'll bring the desired
[1:08:38] results
[1:08:39] wisdom will always lead you where you
[1:08:41] need to go
[1:08:43] in our pursuit for the wisdom that comes
[1:08:46] from above
[1:08:47] god requires a complete surrender
[1:08:55] get rid of it moses was filled with the
[1:08:59] wisdom of the world
[1:09:01] but god required a complete surrender
[1:09:04] before he would use him
[1:09:08] had to get rid of it put him through so
[1:09:11] much
[1:09:11] to he was nothing
[1:09:14] so i'll say it like today the wisdom
[1:09:16] that you got
[1:09:19] get rid of it make room for god's wisdom
[1:09:24] well i am not brother john you asking me
[1:09:27] to get rid of the wisdom
[1:09:29] to to to fix a flat tire
[1:09:32] no i'm talking like that
[1:09:36] i'm talking about your canadian ways of
[1:09:38] being able to figure something out
[1:09:41] when you really don't even know what
[1:09:42] you're talking about
[1:09:45] that's what i'm talking about amen
[1:09:48] a lot of times we talk as if we know
[1:09:50] something
[1:09:53] that's not the wisdom from above
[1:09:57] you can read about moses there in exodus
[1:09:58] chapter 2 and chapter 3.
[1:10:03] so brother john how does a person know
[1:10:06] they're on the right track to getting
[1:10:08] wisdom
[1:10:12] he wants to know amen
[1:10:15] we can find the answer plainly in
[1:10:17] proverbs
[1:10:18] but before we go there i want to give
[1:10:20] you a little background about solomon
[1:10:24] solomon
[1:10:28] was just a boy right around 15 years old
[1:10:34] when he became king
[1:10:37] and you know how most 15 year old boys
[1:10:39] are
[1:10:41] they are not fit to be just tied and
[1:10:44] tied to a tree and stay there till they
[1:10:46] reach a better age
[1:10:53] you know they know more than their
[1:10:55] parents
[1:10:56] they're saying things like i can't wait
[1:10:58] to mold enough i'm out of here
[1:11:10] he was sure lacking wisdom
[1:11:14] and god appeared to the boy in a dream
[1:11:17] and asked what will i give thee god
[1:11:20] appeared to solomon just ask the
[1:11:22] question what will i give thee
[1:11:25] and i'm sure he had crossed his mind
[1:11:27] more than once
[1:11:29] that he was going to become king and he
[1:11:31] was going to be in charge and be able to
[1:11:32] tell people what to do
[1:11:33] and maybe
[1:11:37] get rich and get all his video games and
[1:11:43] pursue his boy dreams
[1:11:51] most young boys
[1:11:54] would probably waste everything that's
[1:11:57] given to them
[1:12:00] but he took this situation serious amen
[1:12:04] the hour that he was living in the task
[1:12:06] that god
[1:12:07] gave him to be king he took it seriously
[1:12:12] and the boy solomon realized that he
[1:12:15] didn't have
[1:12:16] what got what he needed to do what god
[1:12:18] asked him to do
[1:12:20] think about this god called him to be
[1:12:24] king but he didn't have what it took to
[1:12:27] be
[1:12:27] king that's just the way god is
[1:12:31] he calls you to be a parent when you've
[1:12:33] never been a parent before
[1:12:36] he calls you to drive a car when you've
[1:12:39] never driven a car before
[1:12:42] and so what it is is you have to learn
[1:12:44] along the way
[1:12:48] so solomon
[1:12:52] he was concerned about not having what
[1:12:54] he needed
[1:12:55] to do what god wanted to do
[1:12:58] a lot of times we try to do something
[1:13:00] for god and we think we got it all right
[1:13:04] i'm so good i'm so you know what i can't
[1:13:06] wait till they hear me
[1:13:11] you know when i go i'm gonna i'm gonna
[1:13:13] talk to them and i'm gonna just
[1:13:15] win them to the lord and
[1:13:20] and they don't like me anymore
[1:13:24] that is the truth
[1:13:29] he didn't arguably think he could just
[1:13:32] handle with his own ability
[1:13:35] the same when being called to be a
[1:13:38] deacon
[1:13:43] you certainly don't want to choose
[1:13:46] somebody who's just anxious at the idea
[1:13:49] of being a deacon when you don't have
[1:13:53] the right
[1:13:58] spirit
[1:14:01] has nothing to do with age has to do
[1:14:04] with maturity of spirit
[1:14:09] even the bible tells us you don't want
[1:14:10] to choose a novice
[1:14:14] because he can get caught up in thinking
[1:14:15] that he's something and take advantage
[1:14:17] of the opportunity when he gets behind
[1:14:19] the pulpit
[1:14:20] to express himself
[1:14:23] instead of leaving this
[1:14:27] an honor to help people get to christ
[1:14:30] to look to jesus and not to look to self
[1:14:39] so what did solomon do in his
[1:14:40] predicament
[1:14:47] he asked god for wisdom
[1:14:51] that he might know how to go in and out
[1:14:53] so great of people
[1:14:55] i wonder how many times that we ask for
[1:14:57] wisdom
[1:14:59] to help one another in the church
[1:15:05] instead of i'm just gonna you know what
[1:15:07] i'm just gonna
[1:15:12] being a king he could have asked god for
[1:15:15] anything
[1:15:16] but he only asked god for what he needed
[1:15:19] to carry out what god called him to do
[1:15:22] as a right spear turn with me to first
[1:15:24] kings chapter 3.
[1:15:26] first kings chapter 3 verse 6 and
[1:15:29] solomon said
[1:15:31] thou has showed unto thy servant david
[1:15:34] so he's responding back to the question
[1:15:36] now
[1:15:37] my father great mercy according as he
[1:15:40] has walked
[1:15:41] before thee in truth and in
[1:15:43] righteousness and a brightness of heart
[1:15:45] with thee
[1:15:45] and thou has kept for him this great
[1:15:48] kindness
[1:15:49] and thou has given him a son to sit on
[1:15:51] the throne
[1:15:53] as it is this day and now o
[1:15:56] lord my god thou has made thy servant
[1:15:59] king instead of david my father and i am
[1:16:02] a
[1:16:02] little child and i know not how to go
[1:16:06] out or to come in
[1:16:09] and thy servant is in the midst of thy
[1:16:12] people which
[1:16:13] thou has chosen are great people that
[1:16:16] cannot be
[1:16:17] numbered nor accounted for multitude
[1:16:20] give therefore thy servant an
[1:16:22] understanding heart
[1:16:24] to judge thy people an
[1:16:27] understanding heart yes amen
[1:16:30] now it's not the judgment that you're
[1:16:32] thinking
[1:16:34] not the judgment where i'm going to put
[1:16:36] you in your place
[1:16:37] not that judgment
[1:16:47] that i may discern between good and bad
[1:16:51] for who is able to judge this thy so
[1:16:55] great a people
[1:16:57] and i love this verse and the speech
[1:17:00] pleased
[1:17:01] the lord that solomon had asked
[1:17:05] this thing
[1:17:10] you want you want to find favor you want
[1:17:12] to
[1:17:13] please the lord think of the last thing
[1:17:16] that god asked you to do
[1:17:20] and then ask him for what you need
[1:17:23] to accomplish it amen
[1:17:27] and you'll find favor with the lord
[1:17:32] amen and god said unto him because thou
[1:17:36] has asked this thing and has not asked
[1:17:39] for thyself
[1:17:40] long life neither has asked riches for
[1:17:42] thyself
[1:17:43] nor has asked life of thine enemies
[1:17:47] that's the worldly wisdom
[1:17:49] [Applause]
[1:17:51] i'm going to show him i'm going to show
[1:17:54] her
[1:17:57] but has asked for thy self-understanding
[1:18:01] to discern
[1:18:02] judgment that is so beautiful behold
[1:18:05] i have done according to thy words
[1:18:10] oh my once you want god to do something
[1:18:13] according to your words
[1:18:15] well you have not because you ask not
[1:18:18] right
[1:18:19] but when you do ask make sure you ask
[1:18:21] what he's wanting you to ask
[1:18:23] of course it could be a mess
[1:18:29] and lo i have given thee a wise and
[1:18:31] understanding heart so that there is
[1:18:33] none like
[1:18:34] the before thee neither after thee shall
[1:18:37] they
[1:18:37] arise like unto thee and i have also
[1:18:40] given thee that which
[1:18:41] does not ask seek ye first the kingdom
[1:18:44] and all other things shall be added unto
[1:18:46] you amen
[1:18:48] both riches and honor so that they shall
[1:18:50] not be
[1:18:51] any among the kings like unto thee all
[1:18:53] thy days and if thou
[1:18:55] will walk in my ways to keep my statutes
[1:18:58] and my commandments as thy father did
[1:19:00] then i will lengthen thy days now keep
[1:19:02] this in mind
[1:19:03] he god spoke the word but he still
[1:19:07] left the door open for solomon's choices
[1:19:11] along the way
[1:19:14] we just think it's a done deal well i'm
[1:19:16] pretty sure the son of god i'm going
[1:19:18] you know that that spirit will get you
[1:19:20] into trouble that is
[1:19:22] not the spirit that is not the true
[1:19:24] spirit of predestination
[1:19:27] that's the wisdom that comes from down
[1:19:30] here
[1:19:31] it's a it's a earthly mindset
[1:19:36] of a spiritual thing proverbs chapter 1
[1:19:39] verse 1
[1:19:40] the proverb of solomon the son of david
[1:19:42] king of israel
[1:19:45] all right what are proverbs to know
[1:19:47] wisdom
[1:19:48] and instruction to perceive the words of
[1:19:52] understanding
[1:19:53] to receive the instruction of wisdom
[1:19:55] justice judgment and equity
[1:19:58] to give subpility to the simple to the
[1:20:01] young man knowledge and discretion
[1:20:04] a wise man will hear praise god
[1:20:07] and will increase in learning amen and a
[1:20:10] man of understanding shall attain
[1:20:12] unto wise counsels how many times have
[1:20:15] you tried talking to somebody you told
[1:20:17] me exactly
[1:20:19] this is it and they said
[1:20:24] yeah i'll leave it go with that
[1:20:30] you don't understand brother john
[1:20:35] that might have worked for you but that
[1:20:36] won't work for me my situation is
[1:20:39] different
[1:20:43] i tried the lord before it didn't work
[1:20:46] i watched some christian they were a
[1:20:48] hypocrite well who isn't
[1:20:50] right who hasn't failed
[1:20:53] who can say i have not sinned i have not
[1:20:55] yelled i have not got upset
[1:20:57] i have not just wanted to quit
[1:21:06] we've all tried to help somebody and
[1:21:08] they didn't want to listen
[1:21:11] they didn't want to learn
[1:21:15] but a wise man will hear and increase
[1:21:17] learning a man of understanding shall
[1:21:18] attain
[1:21:19] unto wise counsels to understand a
[1:21:21] proverb in the interpretation
[1:21:24] the words of the wise and their dark
[1:21:26] saiyans the fear of the
[1:21:28] lord is the beginning of knowledge
[1:21:33] but fools despise wisdom
[1:21:36] and instruction
[1:21:40] and we thought it was just our kids who
[1:21:42] didn't want to listen to us
[1:21:46] but in reality since we got kids and
[1:21:50] we're
[1:21:50] how many times when you were trying to
[1:21:52] help your kid something bro
[1:21:54] came back to your memory you used to be
[1:21:56] the same way when
[1:21:58] when you were younger
[1:22:02] what is just so you have a clear
[1:22:04] understanding of this
[1:22:07] our old nature is still there amen and
[1:22:09] it can pop up anytime
[1:22:11] and act the same way amen
[1:22:16] it may not do it so much to our
[1:22:19] earthly fathers anymore
[1:22:22] but it can act that way towards our
[1:22:24] heavenly father
[1:22:27] when he tries to give us his word
[1:22:29] [Applause]
[1:22:31] and we begin to get a little rebellious
[1:22:33] or i want to do it my way
[1:22:36] so there's a great battle that goes on
[1:22:39] not only in our church
[1:22:41] but in our lives proverbs chapter 9
[1:22:44] verse 10 the fear of the lord
[1:22:46] is the beginning of wisdom
[1:22:51] and the knowledge of the holy is
[1:22:53] understanding
[1:22:56] for by me that is by wisdom
[1:23:01] thy day shall be multiplied and the
[1:23:04] years of thy life shall be increased and
[1:23:06] that's the same thing that he told
[1:23:07] solomon
[1:23:10] you asked for the right thing i'm going
[1:23:11] to give you wisdom and you know what's
[1:23:12] going to come
[1:23:13] length of days yes
[1:23:18] the fear of the lord when we are in
[1:23:21] pursuit
[1:23:21] for wisdom head directly for the fear of
[1:23:25] the lord
[1:23:27] do not look at the fear of the lord as
[1:23:29] an object
[1:23:30] as a thing as a person as a place
[1:23:35] as some sort of thing that
[1:23:38] is tangent that you're going after
[1:23:43] the fear of the lord is simply the
[1:23:46] condition
[1:23:47] of your heart and editor
[1:23:50] it's awful quiet the fear of the lord
[1:23:55] is the beginning of wisdom so the
[1:23:57] condition of your heart is what is
[1:23:59] necessary to get what you're looking for
[1:24:03] don't be looking out here and hoping to
[1:24:05] get some wisdom when we go to church
[1:24:08] or when we read this this bible or we we
[1:24:11] listen to a tape or we talk to this
[1:24:14] counselor
[1:24:18] the fear of the lord is the condition
[1:24:22] of your heart yes
[1:24:25] so it's about pursuing a proper
[1:24:27] condition here
[1:24:32] it's a choice that you make to humble
[1:24:35] yourself
[1:24:36] to choose the harder way that you really
[1:24:40] don't
[1:24:40] know amen that you really
[1:24:44] don't know
[1:24:47] or well if it be the will of the lord
[1:24:51] and you mean it from your heart
[1:24:53] not well i'm going there the lord
[1:24:55] willing and you go no matter what
[1:24:58] i'm just going to use these words
[1:25:00] because they're
[1:25:02] message words spiritual
[1:25:06] they're my christian front but it's
[1:25:09] we're talking about a condition of a
[1:25:11] heart yes
[1:25:15] brother says i could be wrong about this
[1:25:19] that's what fear of the lord is right
[1:25:23] well i better not lean to my own
[1:25:25] understanding it looks like this but i
[1:25:27] better not lean towards it
[1:25:29] that's the fear of the lord that is the
[1:25:31] condition of your heart
[1:25:33] it's a humble heart
[1:25:37] now after you've chosen to believe that
[1:25:40] you're going to receive wisdom right
[1:25:42] that's what we
[1:25:42] read at the we got to first believe
[1:25:46] well after we've chosen to believe
[1:25:49] then we simply have to humble ourself
[1:25:54] if that don't happen you won't get it
[1:25:56] first peter
[1:25:58] i believe it's peter first peter chapter
[1:26:00] 5 verse 5
[1:26:03] and be clothed with humility just put
[1:26:06] to be close with it now
[1:26:13] we're all clothed on the outside
[1:26:16] but you don't clothe the outside
[1:26:19] of yourself with humility
[1:26:28] the pharisees tried
[1:26:32] they act a certain way but inside
[1:26:36] they were so proud no one could tell
[1:26:39] them anything
[1:26:42] they weren't clothed with humility
[1:26:46] for god resist the
[1:26:50] wisdom of this world yes
[1:26:53] proud but he gives grace
[1:26:56] to the humble yes humble yourselves
[1:27:00] therefore under the mighty hand of god
[1:27:03] that he may
[1:27:05] show you the way yes that's why we want
[1:27:08] wisdom isn't it
[1:27:10] to know what to do to know how to handle
[1:27:12] a situation
[1:27:13] to take care of something is that not
[1:27:15] what the wisdom of god is for
[1:27:20] james said the same thing god resists
[1:27:22] the proud and giveth
[1:27:23] more grace to the humble james chapter 4
[1:27:26] verse 7
[1:27:27] submit yourselves therefore to god
[1:27:30] resist the devil right
[1:27:34] amen resist the devil
[1:27:38] and he will flee from you
[1:27:42] resist the devil in other words feeding
[1:27:46] your
[1:27:46] mind with i already know
[1:27:49] what to do i mean some people have so
[1:27:53] much pride
[1:27:55] the armor is so thick it is so
[1:27:58] shiny it is so glittery
[1:28:02] you can see it a mile away
[1:28:10] you know what i like about this message
[1:28:13] today is that i have not made mention of
[1:28:17] any names
[1:28:23] but every one of us
[1:28:26] battle it and also
[1:28:29] today i just want to expose
[1:28:33] worldly wisdom
[1:28:36] and if we could just pursue
[1:28:39] a condition in our heart
[1:28:43] then we'll receive from the lord the
[1:28:46] direction that we're supposed to go
[1:28:48] because remember the fear of the lord is
[1:28:51] the beginning of wisdom
[1:28:53] in other words wisdom will not come
[1:28:56] without the right condition
[1:28:57] of your heart amen
[1:29:01] amen verse 8 draw an eye to god and
[1:29:05] he'll draw an eye to you
[1:29:06] cleanse your hands ye sinners and purify
[1:29:08] your hearts what ye
[1:29:10] double-minded remember a double-minded
[1:29:13] man is not going to receive anything of
[1:29:15] the lord no wisdom
[1:29:17] so you got to get rid of this
[1:29:18] double-mindedness
[1:29:20] sometimes pursuing and leaning on your
[1:29:22] own wisdom sometimes saying oh again i
[1:29:24] gotta
[1:29:24] lean on god no you've got to make a
[1:29:26] decision i'm staying with the word i'm
[1:29:28] believing the word
[1:29:30] i'm forsaking my own understanding
[1:29:33] you've got to make clear-cut decisions
[1:29:36] about
[1:29:36] the the spirit inside of you
[1:29:41] is it humble and don't really know or is
[1:29:44] it proud and thinks it knows
[1:29:48] be afflicted and mourn
[1:29:52] weep let your laughter return into
[1:29:55] mourning
[1:29:56] and your joy into heaviness in other
[1:29:59] words
[1:30:00] this is the way to condition your heart
[1:30:03] to get wisdom to find favor with god
[1:30:10] amen brother john i'll say amendment
[1:30:13] i believe somebody else is saying i'd be
[1:30:15] saying amen to it you know i'm not
[1:30:17] a mentor to my own word but i do amen
[1:30:19] the word
[1:30:21] humble yourselves in the sight of the
[1:30:23] lord and he
[1:30:25] shall lift you up no god loves me he's
[1:30:28] still going to lift me up anyways i'm
[1:30:29] his
[1:30:33] speak not evil one of another brother
[1:30:38] he that speaketh evil of his brother and
[1:30:41] judgeth his brother
[1:30:42] speaketh evil of the law and judgeth the
[1:30:44] law for if thou judge the law thou are
[1:30:46] not a jew or the law but a judge
[1:30:48] in other words god will never lift you
[1:30:50] up when you're pointing a finger
[1:30:52] [Applause]
[1:30:55] amen when you say something to hurt
[1:30:58] somebody's
[1:30:58] influence a little bit
[1:31:03] that's worldly wisdom
[1:31:07] god will leave you right there in a time
[1:31:11] of need
[1:31:14] well i thought you had it figured out
[1:31:15] back then when you were acting like that
[1:31:17] what do you need me for now
[1:31:20] we've got to humble ourselves in the
[1:31:23] sight of the lord well how do i do that
[1:31:26] now i can't just humble myself in in in
[1:31:30] in in the sight of brother stan
[1:31:33] i gotta do it this side of the lord
[1:31:36] well he's the only one that sees my
[1:31:38] heart
[1:31:42] but i'll say this when you're clothed
[1:31:44] with humility
[1:31:45] everyone sees it
[1:31:51] because it's christ he dwells
[1:31:55] with the humble with the lowly
[1:31:59] with the contrite you know what he's
[1:32:02] there for
[1:32:04] to revive to lift up to strengthen
[1:32:09] to give us what wisdom is supposed to do
[1:32:11] for us proverbs chapter 8 verse 13
[1:32:14] the fear of the lord is to hate evil
[1:32:20] not the evil that's in your brother and
[1:32:22] sister
[1:32:25] the evil that's inside of you
[1:32:29] because that's where the fear of the
[1:32:30] lord is it's easy for me to hate
[1:32:33] all those people that are killing and
[1:32:37] you know all these people making me do
[1:32:39] these things and
[1:32:40] quarantine me out
[1:32:44] but to hate the evil that's inside of me
[1:32:46] amen
[1:32:49] that's the fear of the lord there's no
[1:32:52] fear of the lord looking at this brother
[1:32:54] and saying
[1:32:55] you know every single time you
[1:32:59] do the same thing to me and make me look
[1:33:00] bad in front of everybody
[1:33:05] it's easy to hate that
[1:33:09] but to hate when my flesh tries to rise
[1:33:13] up
[1:33:15] amen oh no we protect that we think
[1:33:18] that's okay
[1:33:19] that's just normal that's just uh you
[1:33:21] know i live with that and that's okay
[1:33:23] that is not okay
[1:33:26] that's really wisdom
[1:33:30] for the fear of the lord is to hate evil
[1:33:32] pride and
[1:33:34] arrogancy the evil way
[1:33:37] and the fallen mouth do i hate
[1:33:41] wisdom hates that the wisdom of god
[1:33:44] hates that
[1:33:45] proverbs chapter 15 verse 33 for the
[1:33:47] fear of the lord
[1:33:49] is the instruction of wisdom
[1:33:53] and before honor is humility
[1:33:56] yes i'm just going to say it like this
[1:33:58] before wisdom can be executed
[1:34:00] there needs to be a spirit of i could be
[1:34:03] wrong
[1:34:05] amen the wisdom of the lord is simply
[1:34:10] walking around
[1:34:11] believing you don't know
[1:34:15] what to do
[1:34:20] it's walking around with that spirit
[1:34:22] it's possessing this
[1:34:24] it's not just once in a while you know
[1:34:25] i'm gonna let show that little badge
[1:34:28] right yeah i'll just stand i don't know
[1:34:30] put it back in my pocket and
[1:34:32] act like i know
[1:34:38] well i'm just going to be honest right
[1:34:40] now in front of everybody you know i
[1:34:42] really don't know what to do but
[1:34:43] 90 of the time walking around with the
[1:34:46] spirit of i know what
[1:34:48] to do i know how to handle life
[1:34:52] and you call that the wisdom of god
[1:34:55] number one the wisdom of god don't act
[1:34:57] like that
[1:34:58] amen amen
[1:35:04] it's a condition of your heart that you
[1:35:07] don't just get it and say
[1:35:09] well i got it and i'll pull it out when
[1:35:10] i need it
[1:35:12] it's something that you walk around with
[1:35:14] so every time somebody sees you
[1:35:16] they're not seeing some know it all
[1:35:18] right some person that thinks they
[1:35:20] look god told me this and not doing this
[1:35:22] and this is this and that and
[1:35:24] you know what i don't even listen to
[1:35:25] that scripture the lord willing
[1:35:28] because i already know
[1:35:34] the joy of the lord what do you know
[1:35:38] worldly wisdom knows everything
[1:35:45] the wisdom of god knows nothing
[1:35:48] except i fear the lord i trust him
[1:35:51] he's going to work out this situation
[1:35:53] he's going to put words in my mouth he's
[1:35:55] going to tell me what to say
[1:35:57] he's going to show me what to do it's
[1:35:59] going to bring the results he wants and
[1:36:01] not what i want
[1:36:02] because i believe in the wisdom of god
[1:36:10] a different spirit
[1:36:13] where natural carnal worldly wisdom is
[1:36:16] walking around
[1:36:17] believing you're right 90
[1:36:22] of the time
[1:36:26] where did you read that brother john i
[1:36:28] didn't i got it this morning
[1:36:33] ninety percent of the time i know hi
[1:36:35] this is what i know
[1:36:36] that's worldly wisdom
[1:36:40] that's why it's associated with debate
[1:36:43] drama envy because you're believing
[1:36:46] you're always right and you're going to
[1:36:47] prove you're right you're going to do
[1:36:49] this to prove you're right
[1:36:51] it's worldly wisdom you
[1:36:54] respect your persons we're acting
[1:36:58] hypocritically with godly wisdom
[1:37:02] there's no drama there's no strife
[1:37:05] because you know you could be wrong the
[1:37:08] way you're looking at the situation
[1:37:11] therefore you're sowing peace it's full
[1:37:14] you're full of mercy and you're full of
[1:37:16] good fruits because you really don't
[1:37:18] know
[1:37:20] not like i know
[1:37:24] you catch what i'm saying it's a spirit
[1:37:28] it's a spirit that you have and not
[1:37:31] about knowledge about
[1:37:32] what's right or wrong
[1:37:35] it's about how you act
[1:37:41] true spirit of
[1:37:44] god inside of a human being
[1:37:48] doesn't walk around knowing
[1:37:57] how did god let the prophet walk around
[1:38:00] so long
[1:38:05] believing certain things
[1:38:08] when it didn't happen
[1:38:14] believing the seals meant this
[1:38:17] that i should go here didn't it
[1:38:21] why wouldn't god tell him that why he's
[1:38:24] walking down the street don't even know
[1:38:25] where he's going same thing
[1:38:28] abraham happened go leave didn't even
[1:38:30] know where he was going he just followed
[1:38:32] the lord
[1:38:33] we god doesn't tell us everything why do
[1:38:35] we act like we know everything
[1:38:39] you got to get rid of that get rid of it
[1:38:41] get rid of it
[1:38:44] don't think that nobody sees it
[1:38:48] it's been seen for a long time
[1:38:54] walk around i really don't know brother
[1:38:57] i'm just trusting the lord
[1:38:59] the lord's going to work that situation
[1:39:01] out amen
[1:39:03] lord's going to just deal with those
[1:39:04] hearts
[1:39:06] god's going to move by his spirit i'm
[1:39:09] trusting in the almighty
[1:39:10] amen i'm not leading to my own
[1:39:12] understanding
[1:39:16] god shall prevail that's the wisdom
[1:39:20] of the lord it's the beginning
[1:39:25] of what will come about when the
[1:39:28] condition
[1:39:29] of your heart is i could be wrong
[1:39:33] you're fearing the lord you're
[1:39:35] respecting
[1:39:37] not hey god me and you're on the same
[1:39:39] page man we got this thing
[1:39:40] all figured out god
[1:39:44] even if god did tell you right he would
[1:39:47] you would never act like that
[1:39:52] you'd probably just
[1:39:55] just praying with your brother just
[1:39:57] praying with your sister
[1:40:01] choose stand with me choose to seek
[1:40:04] after the wisdom from above
[1:40:07] i said stand with me didn't you hear
[1:40:08] that are you listening to me you're
[1:40:09] listening anything i'm saying
[1:40:17] i mean i i got some other scriptures if
[1:40:19] you want to go through them
[1:40:23] you have to make a choice to seek after
[1:40:25] the wisdom from above
[1:40:27] choose to walk around with the spirit
[1:40:31] that you could be wrong you may not be
[1:40:33] used to it
[1:40:35] and i'm not saying anything negative by
[1:40:36] that
[1:40:38] if you feel uncomfortable in that
[1:40:42] nature god will bless you for it
[1:40:48] amen
[1:40:50] but you got to take that first step
[1:40:51] forward into get rid of your wisdom
[1:40:55] walk around with that spirit just don't
[1:40:57] show it once in a while
[1:41:00] walk with it it is the beginning of
[1:41:03] wisdom
[1:41:04] it is the beginning of where wisdom
[1:41:06] wants to take us
[1:41:08] a lot of times when we're praying for
[1:41:10] wisdom is how to talk to somebody
[1:41:12] how to deal with a certain situation
[1:41:16] how to work this little thing out that's
[1:41:18] what we're all praying for wisdom about
[1:41:21] lord show me we want that end result
[1:41:25] god says don't worry about that end
[1:41:27] result you worry
[1:41:29] about fearing me
[1:41:34] humble yourself walk in humility
[1:41:39] that's trust in the lord by the way
[1:41:44] and god would just put words in your
[1:41:47] mouth he'll lead you what to do
[1:41:50] we've all seen the wisdom of god in our
[1:41:52] life just happened we stand back you
[1:41:54] think oh
[1:41:57] you didn't even have anything to do with
[1:41:59] it it was all god
[1:42:02] and then we've all stepped back to
[1:42:04] something that we try to do in our foots
[1:42:06] in our mouth and this didn't happen and
[1:42:07] it caused this separation
[1:42:08] confusion strife come on
[1:42:12] look at there's a difference
[1:42:16] we got to pursue it
[1:42:19] two scriptures proverbs chapter 22 verse
[1:42:22] 4 by humility
[1:42:24] and the fear of the lord our riches
[1:42:27] in honor and life amen

[1:42:39] fountain of life aren't we want to be
[1:42:42] young again
[1:42:45] the fear of the lord praise the lord
[1:42:48] bow your hearts with me amen
[1:42:52] with every heart bowed maybe there's
[1:42:55] someone today
[1:43:00] that's willing to let your wisdom go
[1:43:04] the way that you've been looking at
[1:43:08] handling situations with your own
[1:43:10] abilities
[1:43:12] you want to let that go
[1:43:15] praise god bless these hands these
[1:43:17] hearts wow
[1:43:18] god sees sees
[1:43:22] that humble heart that's so beautiful
[1:43:29] i'm believing with you god does not
[1:43:31] bring a word
[1:43:32] to fall to the ground god brings a word
[1:43:35] to fall in the hearts of his people
[1:43:38] heavenly father we come to you
[1:43:42] lord one thing that we all could save
[1:43:44] assuredly that we need
[1:43:46] more wisdom from above
[1:43:52] but lord we know that though you
[1:43:55] are willing to give it to everyone that
[1:43:58] would ask
[1:44:02] you've reserved it for those who will
[1:44:04] humble themselves before you
[1:44:08] and i pray for every hand that was
[1:44:10] lifted lord
[1:44:12] as we leave here as we go our ways as we
[1:44:16] travel on our jobs and
[1:44:19] do the things that we're going to be
[1:44:22] doing
[1:44:22] in our homes and
[1:44:26] lord we know that we're going to face
[1:44:29] situations
[1:44:30] that we really don't know how to handle
[1:44:33] we really don't know
[1:44:35] what to do
[1:44:38] and our first test
[1:44:43] will be
[1:44:46] to humble ourselves before you
[1:44:52] lord give each hand that was raised
[1:44:55] that spirit bring to their
[1:44:59] remembrance at that moment no matter how
[1:45:02] frustrated they are
[1:45:06] how bothered how angry how hopeless it
[1:45:10] may seem
