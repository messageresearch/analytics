oh I just I don't know what we would do without the Lord in our lives amen amen well it's also a privilege to have brother George Smith with us if I'm not mistaken if if A's correct it's been about 2 and A2 years is that right if we've been we've been wanting him uh but it hasn't been the will of the Lord for him to come any sooner but God willing he may come in the in the summer so we're looking forward to that as well but we're grateful for the work of the Lord that he's doing all over the world Amen and all the all the brothers that he helps he's on the phone helping people constantly and we're just grateful that there is the elect bride that he can help and he's just been a blessing to us that we had about 11 people in the men's meeting and that was he blessed us there with direction to to help us um to become just more solid more balanced and how we can just keep where we need to be with the Lord amen so let's just stand and sing only believe as our brother comes to give us the bread of life today oh only believe only believe all things are possible only [Music] I believe all things are possible Lord I believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible Lord I believe amen it's good to be back in the cold country again where I live it's not quite like this but um God has people everywhere he's got you here and and I'm here and so it's good to be back and brother John has always been very uh kind and um he's uh well he's just brother John we appreciate him and uh this evening let's open our Bibles into the book of First John um 1 John Chapter 2 we going see what God has for us today there be something here for everybody come believing you come you know expecting you'll get what you expect if you come to criticize well there's plenty to criticize start with me but uh if we look in the book of 1 John Chapter 2 and verse one my little children these things right I unto you that ye sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father see here um Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the propitiation for our sins and not for our sins only but also for the sins of the world verse three and hereby do we know that we know him if we keep his commandments so that's very simple math keep his Commandments we know him okay go down to verse 28 down at the bottom of the chapter and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doeth righteousness is is born of him that's right and then on to chapter three behold what manner of love the father hath bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not amen beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him amen for we shall seek him as he is and every man that hath this hope in him purifieth himself even as he is pure let's pray Heavenly Father we thank you for this uh portion of your word that you've given us here tonight and Lord we just pray that you would bless each one that's come out and made the sacrifice only you can reward that sacrifice but Lord bless the word to each one maybe those that are watching on the screen bless them at home that something may be said that would perk them up that would bring them into reality and give us the uh courage and the strength that we need to move on help us now in Jesus name amen you may be seated so our title tonight our journey the hope of the Resurrection we're not just another church down the road we are God's people and he has been kind to us he's given us uh word to believe word to live by and uh our Elijah said God's big clo clock ticks perfect you don't have to worry about whether things are on time things are are right on time won't be one minute fast or when it be behind it'll be just exactly on time on schedule and perfectly balanced or his words now just so happened the way brother John built this Pulpit there's nowhere to put this level so we're going to put it over here and assume that this is also a level over here because the level is for you to focus on we got to be balanced if you're not balanced those nice cars won't go down the road too well you got to be balanced and your machine shop things are perfectly balanced probably got a real nicer level over there right and so all through scripture we find in the year of or in the year that a certain King died in the month in the year and sometimes very specific dates you know throughout scripture and so I'm only here to remind REM you of what has been spoken I'm not here to bring you any shortcuts any you know magic words no a minister only says what has been spoken at the right time and so in this earth we live by the calendar we live by the clock this just the way we're built but everything that has been everything that is everything that will be is governed by the word of God Amen by prophecy whether you believe it or not or like it or not God is in control of every detail that's right that's why you're sitting where you're sitting tonight that's why you wore a blue shirt brother Ron God knows the details okay and so the scripture is our road map okay uh it's our book of directions and God has sent a Vindicated Prophet to make it clear now if you don't think it's Vindicated well then you haven't read far enough you haven't listened far enough you don't know your Bible amen God has sent us a indicated profit and if I seem a little rough well it's because I got two and a half years to make up with you know now the reason I haven't been here for those two and a half years I've been busy I wasn't sitting over at the house I wasn't at the beach right just in the last 6 months I've been to Africa to uh two different countries and I've been to South America and I've been to Mexico and these people are in need just like you're in need they're baptized Believers and they want to hear and so we go and we you know tell them the truth so all the modern events that we see today have already been made clear by prophecy these things have been predicted and you lived long enough to see the Vindication so here we are in uh what was it February of 25 we can't go back the way it used to be we can't go to either side we can only go forward okay so the clop keeps ticking keeps ticking and everything we deal with is time sensitive so as time uh is ticking we need to make serious preparations for the catching away of the Bride we don't have to worry about the Fulfillment of the prophecies God will take the prophecies and bring them at the right time he doesn't need our help he tells us in the word be still I'm God I got to figure it out don't need your opinions see and so our only real concern today is to be ready for the resurrection because that's coming quick then the Rapture you see so making preparations for the catching away the Bible says in Revelations 19:7 his wife ha made herself ready okay how do we make ready stay in the word he's given us the word he's given us a Vindicated Prophet we have no excuse okay so in the getting ready there's four things to keep in mind and to put in practice every day we went over those with the men now it's time for you ladies to make uh some notes also to stay balanced and to get ready for the Rapture you um will read at least one chapter out of your Bible now this is every day starting today not next week starting today you read at least one chapter out of your Bible you read at least one page out of your church age book you listen to at least 20 minutes of God's Prophet it's on every telephone on the planet no excuse and you pray at all times whether it's quietly or whatever so as you're driving down the road and stay away from the crazy people yeah cuz they they they drive worse than I do and so you you can pray you can listen to God's prophet and brother Brown says Prayer Changes Things prayer changes death to life it it's it's the greatest tool we have he says prayer changes sickness to health changes Sinners to Saints it is prayer you may laugh too much you may shout too much you may eat too much oh why do you put that in there but you will never pray too much okay Paul says over in 1 Timothy I will that every I will therefore that every man pray everywhere lifting up holy hands without wrath or doubting amen so we can never pray too much okay and prayer isn't God I need I need you know like a little CH child waiting for Christmas no prayer is to enter into the atmosphere of God's word and he will take care of the details so as you put these four steps together and put them in your life uh you'll have peace in your home and you'll be in contact with your heavenly father and you'll be preparing for the Rapture okay so there's a reason for those things and uh if they don't work we sure and call me let me know but you see today every one of us is on a journey and um we're on a journey to the Gate of Heaven okay and there are many distractions along the way many things that would distract us and so how do we remain focused on the goal and not wander off on the side roads well we have a voice on the dash of our car or the phone it's called GPS right and in the spiritual journey we have a GPS God's positioning system it's magnetic and it pulls us towards the word of God Amen we have our Hope on the resurrection other churches don't you know people out there they're just wandering they don't have the focus we have now the resurrection is the Cornerstone of our entire message believe it or not our Prophet said it's the Cardinal resting place of the Gospel no matter what he did if he did not raise again from the dead then all of it was in vain it proves to me that he was God and I I think it's the great coronation of the Full Gospel is the resurrection and its Divine promises amen so to my opinion the resurrection is the greatest of all the promises and the things of the scripture and uh Paul says over in 1 Corinthians if in this life only we have hope in Christ we're of all men most miserable see but there is a resurrection for those that have surrendered their entire being to Jesus Christ and can say Amen to all the word of God not just just the favorite Parts you see anybody can repeat but only the few can live and take it serious all the others will continue to play Church the day after the resurrection that's when the church will be full after the resurrection after we're gone they'll be crowding into the church oh Lord please just like all the people in the days of Noah once the door was closed anybody know how many days passed seven days and then the rain came amen now in those seven days they were throwing eggs and tomatoes but when the rain started oh hey I'm sorry let us in too late God is on schedu Amen okay so we're on this journey and as Believers in God's word we come from a long line of Travelers okay remember our title Journey to the resurrection so the children of Israel traveled for 40 years enjoying many blessings of God and daily provisions and they enjoyed healing but their Journey was UN was characterized by unbelief God's people yeah all that Journey was characterized by unbelief Abraham traveled about 500 miles from haran to Hebron and his trip was characterized by faith elezar retraced those same 500 miles to go find a bride for his master son and he was accompanied by an Angel remember yes his his journey was characterized by success amen then we have our friends Mary and Joseph they traveled about 90 miles from Nazareth down to Bethlehem obeying the law they didn't ask for a pass oh she was very pregnant oh you got to go so under very difficult circumstances you know and so they were traveling uh a long way at that time on a donkey maybe walking so God's clock is ticking okay there's no shortcuts no excuses and there's many more that we could go through the Bible but uh the most difficult Journey was taken by Jesus Christ Our Lord and when he went to the northernmost part of Israel called cesare Philippi it was the northernmost point of his journeys and then he started traveling south and so his travels are in Matthew 16 and so he's walking you know it's about 140 miles down to Jerusalem you can go check it out but then once he got down there from the temple across the Kidron Valley to Gethsemane with his disciples it's about 600 yards then back over to Jerusalem as a prisoner to the private cell in the house of the high priest caus about 700 yards then out to Pilot's judgment Hall condemned without a proper trial about 500 yard and out to Cal calary as a convict another 700 yard total of about a mile and a half the most difficult Journey okay and there at Calvary They Crucified him amen it was all done according to the words of prophets we might want to condemn those people that they were in their line of duty doing what was prophesied you see so um the predestinated seed of God throughout Seven Ages that's you and me were traveling see we're traveling and our journey today is from right here in dark Le DEA to the gate of the Resurrection how far closer than you could think it's very close and so uh a long time ago brother brand was preaching in the um islands of the Caribbean and he had some American people with him and one of the brothers said that he had a interview with brother brandom one of those days down there in uh 1959 and he asked brother brandom in the long time they talked why do you speak about 77 and brother Bram said well it's because when I was looking through the stream of time so he's seing numbers stream of time he said when it got to 77 it was so dark I didn't see how any believer could live in such Darkness okay you don't have to make me a math genius to know they were a long way from 77 right 40 years plus and so it's much darker much closer to the Rapture and we need to stay ready amen so when you're darkening when we're experiencing the darkness of Lea remember the words of Jesus over in John 17:20 and if I was a real smart person I could know all this by heart but that's not me so in John 17:20 we have where he says here um his words to the disciples he's in prayer here and he says neither pray I for these alone these 12 I've got right here but for them also which Shall Believe on me through their word and that's what we have here the word of witnesses you see okay so you were in the mind of God before he ever went to the Cross brother brandom says over here now we're going to talk about a journey how that God brought his people out of Egypt into the promised land a perfect type of leaving sin coming into the Spirit land now there are three stages of this journey Israel in Egypt Israel in the journey and Israel in Palestine he says which are all a perfect type of justification by faith coming out of you know good people in sin coming out two sanctification as they pass through the blood you know in our journey and baptism of the Holy Ghost entering into rest is perfectly the stages of the church that is where the church is stag now now he's speaking this over 70 years ago but we're still in that same time zone you see so the church this one and all the rest they're like a hospital there's nobody at the door asking for your credit card you're welcome come in and so some today are in the journey they're coming out of they're passing through justification others are going through the blood through the process of redemption sanctification and others are resting in the Holy Ghost okay all forming the Church of Jesus Christ in this journey to the resurrection any questions so far good so um we're marching forward we are making progress sometimes it doesn't look like it but we are making progress amen so the prophet says and I'm I'm quoting a bit quite a bit from the prophet because he was the Vindicated mouth of God and got some great material he says now we're moved by the holy spirit in going into the Promised Land In My Father's House of many mansions if it were not true I would have told you I'll go there and prepare a place for you is that right now we have a promised land that we're going to John 14 you know we have a destination each day marks a milestone okay it's like the river out here water's gone this is new water you ever wonder where all that water comes from I mean the Ohio River down there it just keeps flowing it's huge it's a mile wide but anyway um he says here um and there's a big Dark Shadow set setting out yonder before us it's called death and every time our heart beats we move one step closer to that one of these days it's going to take its last beat and we're going in okay I want to be at my I want to be at my time they see people in other countries have no clue what he's talking about well that's Kentucky English for be ready as I hope each one of you is tonight be ready at your time when I know that it's is when I know that it is lying before me and I have to meet it I don't want to be a coward I want to wrap myself in the robe of his righteousness walking into it knowing this that I'm sure that I know in the power that I know him in the power of his resurrection and when he calls from the dead I'll be called out with them that's living God is a god of the living it's not a god of the Dead like the Catholic church with all the PE you know Saints and all that no that's that's not true in another place he says I imagine when the ages roll on he will just still be better all the time when we look back and see what God has brought us out of brought us through and brought us into the Christian life is a journey this here is a pilgrimage and we are just passing through this land we're not going to stay here no many times we build a house and we say well the family and I anchor down here but for how long you don't know that's right and we always would like to get to a place where we could say this is ours for good but it isn't here on Earth no we don't have such a place here on Earth but there is something in you that calls out for such a place and before there could be anything uh in you calling out for that place that place had to be in existence or there would be nothing here to call for that's right the Deep cannot call unless the deep is there to respond to it so there has to be a place first to make this deep call out so he he drops these you know nuggets everywhere to help us in uh tape called communion 62 we want to keep out of the blood at all times but we don't know just what might happen so you have none of us have a guarantee of the sunshine tomorrow no so we got to stay ready doesn't matter how doesn't matter how much broccoli you eat how much ice cream you refuse there's a line in the road and you don't know where it is so stay ready um all things are about wound up we feel Lord that the coming of the Lord is at hand so he's praying here and we are fixing to take a journey and as we think of a journey we might think of suitcases and extra clothing extra shoes but how different is this journey it's not packing up it's unpacking laying aside that's as your great servant Paul said in the book of Hebrews 12th chapter we lay aside every weight and the unbelief that so easily besets us that we might run with patience the race that is set before us Amen on this journey we have three kinds of Believers now I didn't write the book I didn't tell brother BR what to say but he said in every group there's three kinds of Believers amen so take his word for it and the word is preached to all equally we don't discriminate and the church is like a hospital there's the unbeliever the makeb believer they're just along temporarily they're just here for a while okay and they're kind of enjoying the free ride because they have very little invested see the make believer and unbeliever they don't pay tithes they don't get involved they got very little invested so they'll soon have to jump off because they can't handle the pressure or the responsibility of the preaching of the word okay and they look like Believers and they do a good job you they might look better than of us sometimes but they're impersonators they can quote but they can't live it 100% amen so don't waste your time judging them okay it's a waste of time God knows who they are he knows who are his and he'll take care of the separating at the right time see um and he's in charge of giving out the rewards so he knows he doesn't need our Canary brain to help him out okay but the True Believer feeds on the word of God every day and he enjoys the four steps read scripture read the prophet listen to the prophet and pray don't forget those so um he feeds on the word of God it's his life Source along the way he stays true he stays in step in the correct atmosphere and he stays balanced the scripture says in Romans 3:23 all have sinned all the Martin children all the Smiths all the randoms they all Sinn and come short of the glory of God we can't can't reach it on our own none of us were born angels I know I I've had beautiful little children but they're Little Liars you learn that pretty soon they they just come wired that way you know amen so they're beautiful but uh just Sinners born in sin and come to the world speaking lies St John 3 we begin to get a glimpse of the three kinds of Believers now the the pope of Rome loves you know part of the scripture and um you know God so loved the world well that's nice well it sounds like everybody's going wait a minute for he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth oh there's something involved yeah believeth should not perish but have everlasting life for God had not sent his son s into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be saved now we didn't make that up he that believeth on him is not condemned but he that believeth not is condemned already because he hath not believed in the name of the only begotten Son of God Amen so people come into the world certain ways you believe you're here okay so God knows whose are his and um he knows what's going on so there's definitely hope for the believer those who make the right choice so to get to an unfamiliar place like I did the other day coming over here um we used to study the road map now you older people remember the big road map we had but do you remember it's an alphabetic order if you're going from Michigan to Wisconsin it's not the next page it's way back there you know and so but now we have the electronic map that's right there on your dash or it's on your phone uhhuh you have a voice to guides you every step if there's a driveway she'll say the second right they they got it all figured out they can see amen they see through the snow and through the dark it's amazing you know amen so in this journey God has drawn the lines he's highlighted certain points of interest you know certain verses and the promises for each age for his children to arrive at the resurrection amen you simply have to study the map yes and it doesn't come by osmosis you have to get in there and read it like we used to do in school you had to read right and so um and that way you know the promises for your day you'll never be lost you'll simply recognize the plan of God and you'll recognize the sign oh that's what he said yeah it's right there all these things are happening he's already been telling us that's right amen you know so he'll Quicken the truth to you and God has even provided a voice to remind us and you will be finding the shortest route now if you get off you know that other sound comes on you turn you turn it warns you you know so along the way we all have certain regrets and we can't change the past wish we could would you make some changes absolutely yeah me too so the only thing we can do is repent ask for the blood of Jesus Christ to cleanse us from unrighteousness correct our attitud ude and we can uh March together as we read the scriptures now this isn't going to be long but we'll try to say things that going to help you things maybe you haven't thought about so as for the present God gives us breath today in order to live and make decisions that will affect our future we already know what mistakes we made we don't need to be reminded of that but this was a learning process and we came through some things it's a learning process and uh we we you know try not to make the same mistakes twice mistake is one thing but if it continues it's a bad habit which alerts you to the fact that you're Anointed with an evil spirit and you have a besetting sin it's in scripture so you need to genuinely repent ask for prayer get yourself under the influence and the anointing of God's word that's why the four steps don't forget them and into a correct spiritual atmosphere God's R God's bride makes yourself ready all the others don't care you see so in today's lesson we're simply attempting to remind you of the truth we're not here to condemn but come face to face with the truth you see brother Ram said simply you've got tapes on that you've got tapes on what we believe it's on every cell phone yes sir you don't have to go buy anything it's right there see so as a as bride that we're on this journey in 2025 um we need to take advantage of the four steps daily that way we stay in tune we stay in in in step with God's program now according to Philippians 4:7 we can actually have the peace that goes beyond all understanding see all I know is that John is a good man and has a shop over there I don't understand what they do he understands that now the peace that God gives me goes beyond what I understand you see and it goes beyond all criticizm M all religious fanaticism legalism and only that God can keep you in peace in your heart and in your mind through Jesus Christ not through reciting something no through Jesus Christ Paul also wrote to the early Church in Rome in Romans 8 the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if we are children then we are HS HS of God joint HS with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also will be glorified together for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to even be compared with the glory that shall be revealed in us see so not only in Christ will the glory be revealed not only in the prophet of this age will the word be made alive but in Us in Flesh and Blood Believers just like me and you Hebrews 13:8 is true today Jesus Christ isn't wasn't just the same yesterday today 1965 and then forever sometime no today hey we are part of the picture so as we make this journey we have ups and downs we have rejoicings we got sufferings we got setbacks we got victories and it is The Minister's duty to encourage and remind us and keep the people focused on the present truth we don't need a minister to tell us what Trump said no the newspapers are full of that it's it's on every phone all that's going to it's just going to roll on right now for you people that think that that he's the Great white uh hope no all he's doing is resetting the thermostat a little bit temporarily it's still going to burn there's no making it great again it's going to burn you know so um we want to stay focused on the scriptures that pertain to the truth of the day that we're living in amen great tape that you could listen to in your spare time discernment of spirit 1960 here he is praying and we are here this morning Father gathered for no other purpose but to know and to study to know rather the will of God and what we must do to make Christ real to the people of this generation yes there's The Minister's job right there make Christ real to the people of this generation I've been living for a long time I'll be 80 and did I say August so I've seen some generational changes and so he says knowing surely that in the day of the Judgment we will be brought face to face with this generation and being ministers we will be judges and those people to which we have spoken to and their attitude towards the word that we bring them will determine their Eternal destination all about attitude therefore Lord in that day we will be a judge for or against the generation that we preach to so when we travel we got to make preparations now I've been in the airport and I've seen people that did not make preparations they didn't comb their hair they didn't even get out of their pajamas amazing we have to check the schedules we got to plan ahead and our God is not an author of confusion amen you see he's very organized he's very much on schedule the prophet says God in his great and wise Providence moves every Cog just to hit at the right time and that gives us Faith sometimes when we think oh everything's just Topsy turby there is no way out don't think that God is making it all work together exactly to his time program it's on time he he he can see the whole picture you see he's the master he knows the schedule so we have Moses and if you read your Bible you'll see where Moses was 40 years in Egypt okay and so he was one step from the throne he was the man he was right he was right there he was Pharaoh's daughter's son you know she you realize he's got that name Moses because a pagan princess gave him the name yeah amen you think God might have been in charge of all that amen that's right yeah so but he was on a journey okay he had all the servants there he had he lived a life of luxury but Prophet says now Moses after taking the situation in his own hand what' he do oh if I'm the deliver I'll just kill all these sorry people and then we'll be in charge that's not the way it works no he found out that he was a total failure and he ran from the presence of pharaoh ran from the presence of God and was a stranger for 40 years out there and he married an Ethiopian girl and before you get too excited they were all pretty much the same color back then so don't get too excited about that and so she had a lot of temper oh and Moses had a lot of temper oh sound like a problem that was his trouble I would just imagine things weren't so peaceful back there on the back side of the desert at times in other words it was tough you know wasn't always pleasant but it was God's program so he says if you think you married a woman that has a little temper maybe God is trying to tame you down a little and vice versa and then out there what was God doing he was schooling into the man's mind what the program of God was now why didn't Moses just pay attention the first time because he was human just like us amen that's right so here's Moses out there desert he's he's he's watching the Sheep he's hurting these sheep out there so they're going out there now uh Zapora his wife they have they probably had a nice tent probably was no twom man tent was probably a nice tent but it wasn't house out on the desert the Sand's blowing all the time so she had a big job keeping that tent clean okay got the picture and so here comes Moses he's been out with these sheep all day long now sheep have a lovely nature yes nice nature but they stink and so Moses been with the Sheep all day long he comes home and um and the first thing he hears Moses shoes trying to keep this place clean please nobody at the palace treated him like that back then he just had to stand there and they dress him you know he had it made but out here on the desert with with Zapora she's trying to keep the tent clean so he's got to take his shoes up every day the same old story you know so um then one day he's out there with the sheep and he sees this bush on fire well that's weird and so he gets over there and the first thing Mo God said Moses yeah yes sir shoes see God Was preparing him back there at the tent for when God would speak to him you already had heard that before so God was using a high-tempered woman to speak some sense into his mighty Prophet Moses and all the prophets are humans so Moses back there waiting hurting sheep out in the desert perfect picture of us here tonight a Believer out of fellowship with God there he was no Fellowship not one thing in 40 years that God spoke or did for him any Supernatural he was out of fellowship and when the church gets out of fellowship with God Miracles cease signs and wonders cease Revival cease God just moves right on when you get out of Fellowship the thing to do you to remedy prevent this is to keep the love of God in your heart am keep fellowship with him and he will add these other things as we mature amen and there's where we as humans 21st century everybody with a you know a nice expensive phone we want to get ahead we want to help God we want to help push the cart no as we mature he'll give us what we need that's right you see so Moses out of Fellowship no Fellowship out there in strange country among strangers not his own people she was Ethiopian he was a Jew and they're completely out of the reach of God seemingly and God all the time knowing that no matter how much of a mess that man makes out of the program of God God is going to straighten it out so there is hope you see so in traveling we got to be aware of the dress code I know it's foreign language to a lot of people used to be a difference between men and women traveling now in every airport that I've been in there's a little sign one's got a dress other's got pants well if they want to get serious all the people with pants go here all the ones dresses go over there now if they don't know which the one they are I guess they can go outside you know but they're used to be a dress Co people used to dress up a little bit not now you know hairstyles Etc and so Prophet says here and usually Prosperity causes sin yes many people look on Prosperity as blessings it would be if we could handle it right but it usually leads to sin dishonoring God you know selfish arrogant and how Israel had drifted off into terrible sin got away from God got away from his uh Commandments his precepts and they went off on another tantrum the women walked in the streets in their fine immodest clothes I mean he Nails these things and this is 1963 long time ago some of you wern't even born you know and so um there fine in modest clothes you see God made you the way you are ladies and gentlemen but Satan is the one that designs the clothing so you got to be careful don't let it get to you so he says the men were went about gambling and drinking the road houses we call it today strip clubs and um places of amusement wide open in the city sin was disregarded by the ministry just laying wide open sin was not rebuked from any Pulpit anymore it was on the loose way of a true Prophet you see one thing that Satan has accomplished here in Lea better than any time in history he has blurred the lines between right and wrong he's blurred the lines of distinction between men and women it's we're all the same no we're not the same did you watch the president's inauguration oh there's men and there's women get it straight so it's going to it's going to get ugly here in a little bit you know so um brother brand had words for such stuff like that he said Tommy rot perversion sodomites and we're living in the middle of insanity I don't know if you realize 1964 brother BM said if this goes on the way it is now so whatever he was focused on he said if this goes on the way it is now in 50 years there'll be Total Insanity and that Circle was closed in 2014 so we've been 11 years total insan that's why it's the way it is so be careful how we throw rocks at the churches and the L SE and system when we permit our children to dress the way they do children must live your convictions until they have their own bible-based convictions okay now great message anointed once at the end time I was sitting from here to the piano watching him preach this message he said well whether we are Baptist Methodist Presby and Pentecostal we're all the same we are not the same you are a separated people holy unto the Lord dedicated to the word of God and the spirit of God to bear fruit of his promise in this day and you are not one of them I know that's awful strong but it's the truth just the same you are dedicated to a service in this last day come out from amongst it I don't care how real it sounds how much they try to impersonate it's a lie if it's contrary to God's word of this hour black and white I don't care what it is if it's contrary to the word if it's contrary to the written word of God for this hour it's a lie God will have nothing to do with it no matter how sincere how educated how smart how true it sounds how reasonable it sounds if it's contrary to the word of this hour so according to St Paul the ministry must be properly equipped okay for the journey we have 2 Timothy 3:16 And1 17 and we we have um Church age book chapter 4 verse 189 Faithfully taught you got to be properly equipped and in this journey we have to have proper papers now everybody has a birth certificate you know can't leave the hospital without it proving that you were born where and when and some actually go on to get a passport okay and you can travel to many countries but to travel to certain difficult places you got to have a Visa stamp in your passport so again natural birth birth certificate born again is your passport and baptism of the Holy Ghost is your visa and so one of my favorite subject is beyond the curtain of time where he says he says now I Heard a Voice then that spoke to me and it was in the room and said this is what you preached was the Holy Ghost this is perfect love and if you haven't heard those things it's in rejected King uh May 15th of 1960 this is perfect love nothing can enter here without it it's what the angel told him and I am more determined than ever in my life that it takes perfect love to enter there my precious friends my beloved my darlings of the Gospel my begotten children unto God listen to me your pastor I wish there was some way I could explain it to you there are no words I cannot find them anywhere but just beyond this last breath is the most glorious thing there's no way to explain it there's no way I just cannot do it but friends whatever you do lay aside everything else till you get perfect love get to a spot that you can love everybody every enemy everything else that one visit there has made me a different man I can never never never be the same brother Brandon because he saw what it really was am uh a few months later just remember I'll say this with the faith that I have in that Vision whatever it was and I'll speak it in the name of the Lord except except you have that perfect love you will never be there because nothing could ever be there without it your spirit would be out of place my friends you old people you young people you don't know what time you're going to leave we don't know that but let me persuade you as a Christian brother one that loves you except you're born again and the spirit of God love comes into your heart you will certainly miss that place so we have every opportunity so we might we've got to make our preparations we have to have dress code equipped with proper papers and so forth and one more thing when you travel Anita back there you got to be flexible sometimes things happen got to be flexible and there's a precise schedule only God knows the details we get zealous he come up we come up with private ideas and interpretations why can't I park here I'm so and so no garage is over there you no so you got to obey the law so we figure out we make plans and you can count on for one thing for sure God will uh only be subject to his word you see that's right he'll fulfill his word on schedule no room for Fanatics or legalists along the journey you're going to face Temptations trials pitfalls but the scripture promises that we have a high priest that we can he can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities because he was tempted in all points just like us but without sin okay his mercy and understanding extends to all the trip because the word of God tells us the mercy of God is to all generations when we're tempted we have an advocate we can come boldly into his presence and seek his Mercy it is like an oasis a refreshing that's why we have prayer meetings that's why we have private time in prayer that's why you you get into the word that's where you find a refresh in in your strength see we're not victims we're Overcomers we're more than conquerors in Jesus Christ Our Captain Revelations 12:11 says they overcame him by the blood of the lamb and the word of their testimony balance see this cross down here the long part of the Cross is your prayer life you you do your part and stay in prayer God will take care of the horizontal okay in our journey we become Restless we've seen a lot of that haven't we we develop a bad attitude when we get Restless like when you're traveling and you want to eat but it's still 30 minutes away started angry you know where's the promise of it coming all things continue the same I'm getting tired of the pastor always preaching right at me griping complaining yeah it happens we get bored too much free time but if we'd spend that same free time and energy reading the word you'd be surprised I can calm you down you can start anywhere it doesn't matter you see anywhere you open the Bible you got you got two pages they can make a full movie out of those two pages wherever you start true so just go in there true you know when a preacher tells me ran out of things to preach he's not reading his Bible that's for sure because anywhere you open your Bible there's something there that you can latch on to okay so read the word pray for others and the journey will seem a lot shorter you see and our attitude will improve in direct proportion you see from the by the verses that we read back here in first John where it said and now little children abide in him that when he shall appear we may have confidence and not be ashamed before him at his coming if you know that he is righteous you know that everyone that doth righteousness is born of him so along the way we see signs telling us that we're getting closer you know to Detroit or wherever we're going and um so we make adjustments you know getting closer and it's time to get serious the holy spirit is not shortsighted like we are okay our God can see the entire Journey you can see the end from the beginning and he can see through time and space he knows all about the fusses you had this week he he knows all about the people that short changed you at the coffee shop or whatever and um uh he knows what your attitude's going to be when you get home and try to go to sleep and you were critical about what was said tonight God can see all that amen that when brother John's preaching wsh just zip it God brought you here he wants you to hear something you know so he's not shortsighted um and um now we can hide things from one another oh we come in here smile soon as we get in the car did you see what she was wearing you know but we can't hide from God he sees all he knows all you see and the devil has traps set be careful because leosa is a landmine yeah it's a Minefield and our attitude towards God's word and God's Messengers will determine our destination I just read it to you so character is not a gift it's a victory a victory you have to fight for something you know things you have to overcome to obtain the character Peter was rough Mary was mild but both had things to overcome Peter was Peter and Mary you know they both had to go to the upper room so character is not a gift no matter what your name is right you can be John's favorite child or whatever you know no that doesn't matter everybody has to go through stuff so we're on a journey we have expectations of the reunion is going to take place when we arrive we'll see our loved ones we haven't seen for years those days are coming brother Bram told one brother he said in one of these days you're going to be in the house taking care of things and you're going to hear a knock on the door and you go open the door true there's Rebecca there's your mother whatever you know he's planned it so well that he's got it he's got it figured out he brings our loved ones to us right at the end of the trip we've been instructed that you know just before the going away there'll be a period a month or so now the Bible says over here in Acts chapter 1 where's it at um in Acts chapter 1 it says here he showed himself alive after his Passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them 40 days that's a month or so case you Haven figured it out that's right speaking of things pertaining to the kingdom brother brandom said right here in Wisconsin he said right at the end there will be the resurrection and we'll be together a month or so and then we'll go yes so we'll have time to take care of the greetings and the fellowship and so forth when he takes us to his house all the attention will be on him not worried about who made it who didn't make it you see he is a jealous God if you haven't read that part jealous is one of his names so we'll know that the resurrection is on when you see your dad or your grandma you'll know something's up um I don't know if I told you this before but Bears repeating uh a friend of mine he God deals with him in dreams and so he in one of his dreams he said he was in heaven uh but it's other dream he was like a fly on the wall he could see brother brandom's living room and he could see brother Neville and sister brandham sitting in chairs and me and Rebecca were sitting over by the fireplace in this dream and so then they were talking and so then brother Neville got up to leave well he left in March of 1974 and so then sister Rena went over to the door to see came out and she left in May of ' 81 so they're over by the door and so then they said to Rebecca come over here so she comes over and she left in November of 06 so they're by the door and I'm still sitting by the fireplace and so they look back at me and they said you keep doing what you're doing amen and that's why I'm here tonight amen keep doing what you're doing thank you so some of us have been on this journey longer than others you see and we have much more to be accountable for we have a great responsibility you realize that I'm one of the last living witnesses that new William brandom there there's hardly anybody left so I've got to get great responsibility we've seen many signs it all depend it's pointing that we're almost home so I realize we have Christians of all ages here but you see we're on a journey together yes and I just want to see you on the other side yes when you get there whatever it is look around you'll see me I'll have some dark hair might not have mustache I don't know but I just invite you to make Christ the main Center of your life get serious and don't let another day go by without applying the four steps may God bless you [Applause] Lord job amen love that word an encouragement to us to keep on the journey there's there's always going to be distractions you you get up how many's how how often has this happen I'm GNA get up this is what I'm going to do I'm going to do this I'm gonna do this and it never happens I have heard this many times at work my son will come in he'll make a list of things that he needs to get done and he'll 6 hours later I I only got I sometimes I didn't get one thing done so one is we got distractions and the other is we don't always know what our footsteps are ordained to do and we just have to trust the Lord I believe we've been encouraged today what we need to do to make sure that we're staying focused on our journey we don't get distracted and if we could just humbly apply these I believe that we're going to see our brother on the other side we'll find out whether he's got that mustache or not and um and the Bible says forever be with the Lord amen let's stand together forever be with the Lord amen let just bow our heart in a word of prayer and go before him our heavenly father as we come before you today we're so thankful that you've given us your word we thank you for your servant Lord that not only that you sent him here but Lord the testimony of keeping them right in the middle of your truth not going to the left not going to the right but you've kept him here for a purpose Lord to help your people in this late late hour where truly it is a dark a Darkness the world is insane and Lord you are the only light that we have and we just thank you for the word you've given us today Lord that we're still on the journey I pray heavenly father that this word that we heard today would remain in a heart remain in our minds that you'd bring it to our remembrance Lord when we would get distracted Lord I pray that You' bless each and every one of us here Lord that that not be one that would miss it but that we might all be there in that the hour of the Resurrection that's just before us bless bless us now Lord as we take your word we claim it We Trust You Lord that you just continue to guide our steps Lord when we do get out of the way Lord that you just show us the way bless each heart bless each life may you bind us together in that Christian love the love that's from above oh God we need you to fill us so full help us to do our part to lay aside everything until we do get it may it become our priority may we grow in your love may we manifest your love may we be able to share it with others that others may see that there's more for them Lord we love you we commit ourselves to you bless your servant Lord as he travels uh tomorrow Lord to the different uh his next place and Lord to the different places he would go be with him and use him keep him keep his health Lord we thank you love you in Jesus Christ's name
