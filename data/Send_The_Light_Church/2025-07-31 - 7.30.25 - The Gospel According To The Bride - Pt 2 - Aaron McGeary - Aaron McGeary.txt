TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] At last and did my Savior bleed, and did my sovereign die. Could he devote that sacred head for such a worm as I? At the cross, at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away. Hallelujah. It was there by faith I received my sight. And now I am happy all the day. For if for crimes that I have done, he grown up on the tree. Amazing pity, grace unknown, and love beyond a degree. The cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden on my heart rolled away. It was there by faith. I receive my sight. And now I am happy all the day. Well might the son in darkness hide and shut his glories in. When Christ the mighty maker died for man the creature sin. At the cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away. Hallelujah. It was there by faith I received my sight and now I am happy all the day. But drops of grief can naray the debt of love I owe. Here Lord I give myself away. is all that I can do. Just give yourself away. The cross at the cross where I first saw the light and the burden of my heart rolled away. It was there by faith. I received my sight. And now I am happy all the day. At the cross.

Bring them in. Bring them in from the fields of sin. Bring them in. Bring them in. Bring the wandering ones to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [Music] I am happy. &gt;&gt; What's going on? &gt;&gt; Heavenly voices. I don't know what to say. &gt;&gt; Well, in order to bring them in, we got to have the Holy Spirit. So, burn, burn, Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; How many got that desire tonight? &gt;&gt; Burn, burn, Holy Spirit. Burn in me. Set my sword on fire.

More than a coner. That's what I am. I'm a new creation. I'm a brand new man. Hallelujah. Amen. It's all because he touched me. Amen. Hallelujah. Shackled by a heavy burden neath the load of guilt and shame. [Music] Then the hand of Jesus touched me and now I'm no longer the same. Hallelujah. He touched me. Oh, he touched me. And oh the joy that floods my soul. Something happened. And now I know he touched me and made me whole. Since I met this blessed savior, since he cleansed and made me whole, I shall never cease to praise him. I'll shout it while eternity rolls. [Music] He touched me. Oh, he touched me. And oh, that joy that floods my soul. Something happened. And now I know. He touched me and made me whole. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I pray that he touched you and he's still touching you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, I just like to change your order of service. Amen. And he's as he's touched us, he can touch these requests. Amen. So, we'll just uh Amen. just keep them in in our hearts. Amen. Amen. Let's uh Brother John has request for Dave uh Ralph's grandson was in a terrible car automobile accident and is in U of M hospital. Please remember him in your prayer. Amen. Uh also let's please hold up our brother Bill Bailey in prayers. I know he's uh dealing with this cancer and uh I believe it's bleeding. So, let's just be in ever mindful in prayer for that. Amen. He's an a soldier of the cross. Amen. Let's also remember our sister Cheryl's father. Uh he is a colon cancer and I believe you guys are going up pretty soon to go see him. So, let's pray for traveling mercies for that and for wisdom for the doctors and uh uh peace for the family. Amen. Amen. Uh, also if you could just remember my neighbor Bob, he is 90 had a one of many, but he had a fell off his tractor today while he was mowing his grass. And uh, me and Sister Lori had to go over there and pick him up. and um they just want to give up on life, which he needs the Lord's wisdom on. Um just letting go and let people help him though because he wants to do it all by himself. And uh um he did so do so good. So just pray for him and to accept the Lord too. Uh we've been talking to him about that. You know, you can live 90 years, but it's all gone once you die. &gt;&gt; Or you can live eternally. It's a choice. &gt;&gt; But it's a free choice. &gt;&gt; So, we pray that all those accept Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Also, we have just a few uh announcements. Uh, Friday on August 8th at 6:30, we will have a a special service for the parents only. Dinner will be provided. And also join us after service for cake and celebrating Aurora and Joy's birthday. So, happy birthday. Amen. So, let's just stand. Amen. If there's something that the Lord put on your heart, we pray that you know that it's him and it's there's a reason behind it. Let's just go to the Lord. I want to chore today. Dear heavenly father, Lord, as we come to before your mighty throne, Lord, we know Lord, we fall so short, Lord. But Lord, we serve a God that is a mighty hand. That you're reaches beyond anything that we could imagine. for it came down one day and it rescued us. So Lord, as we take these requests up for for Cheryl's dad, Lord, for brother Bill, for all those that are suffer, sister Elizabeth is suffering from cancer, for for this uh my neighbor Bob, Lord, to accept you and for his health, Lord, for all so many more, Lord. I know they'd be upon our hearts, Lord. We just laid at your feet, Lord God, because you are the author and finish of our faith, Lord. You are the alpha and omega, Lord. For w without you there was nothing, all things created by you, Lord. So you know every ill, everything that would be going on, every hair on our heads, Lord Jesus. Lord, so we rested at your feet today by faith, Lord God. Faith in you that call us on that day, Lord God.

We pray for him, Lord God. Lord, we pray for each other, Lord, as we come and approach your throne, Lord God, that you would just bring revelation, Lord, that we might draw closer to you, Lord. And Lord that we could say at the end of the day it was good to walk amongst us Lord Jesus. Oh Lord bless our brother Aaron Lord as he would prepare. And Lord bless us the remainder of the service Lord in Jesus name we pray these things. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Amen.

Thank you Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise you Jesus. &gt;&gt; I don't think it's going to be this quiet in heaven guys. just to kind of a let you know &gt;&gt; this is a practice place. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. Well, let's just uh we're going to change order of service a little. Brother Jonathan, can you lead us in tithes and offerings? Amen. Amen. You may be seated. Amen. Brother John, you want to come up? So good to be in the house of the Lord. &gt;&gt; That you brought your sacrifice of praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. I believe we can we can help the ministry as the brother comes forth. I believe there's something for every one of us. &gt;&gt; Uh we all may be going through different things and have different trials and have different questions. Um, but I believe the Lord uh has something for us to help us with what we have need of. &gt;&gt; And I also believe that God has something for us that we're not asking. &gt;&gt; It's what that's on his mind. &gt;&gt; And uh so we want to just be prepared. Let's stand and sing that that little course. Um Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary. As brother Aaron comes, we just appreciate Brother Aaron in many different ways and for many different things. He's such a precious, precious brother. Lord, prepare me to be a sanctuary, [Applause] [Music] pure and holy, tried and true with thanksgiving. I'll be a living sanctuary for you. Lord, prepare me. With thanksgiving, I'll be a living sanctuary for you. Sing it again. Oh Lord, prepare me a sanctuary, pure and holy, light and true. With thanksgiving, I'll be a living Amen. Praise the Lord. Wonderful. If you could just take your Bibles. We'll be reading from Matthew chapter 5. Just a few verses there. It's wonderful to be in the house of the Lord again. &gt;&gt; I hope that this week I look more tanned and rested than I did last Wednesday as we enjoyed this past Sunday off. and really enjoyed the service on Sunday. Really love the fellowship here and everyone. It just always feels like home when we come here and so it's nice just to set participate in service with you join Gideon's ministry and on a Wednesday night it's nice to see all the people are here on Sunday back on a Wednesday night. I think that speaks well of the church when you have a core that's always there always faithful. Uh some churches that are much larger than this one have smaller crowds than this even on a Wednesday night. So, I think it's a real testimony to your love of the Lord. I'm sure you've heard it before. I've probably mentioned it before that if you come on to church on Sunday morning, you love um you love church. If you come on Sunday evening, you love the pastor. If you come on Wednesday night, you love the word. &gt;&gt; Kind of self- serving on a Wednesday night. And so, I joke that that's why we don't have a Sunday evening service at our church. But we love you. We're going to be leaving tomorrow to go back to Arizona. And just been a real privilege to be here. We'll be praying for all of you, especially sister Cheryl and her dad and brother John as he's going to be driving up too. And I think Ann's already gone up to see their grandpa. So let's just remember them in prayer that God would be merciful. Matthew chapter 5 verse 14 to verse 16. You are the light of the world. A city that is set on the hill cannot be hidden. Neither do men light a candle and put under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. If &gt;&gt; we could bow our heads in prayer. Heavenly Father, as we have read this word, we believe it to be eternal. We believe that in each one of these verses, there is a mystery of Christ to be revealed to us, for us to see. And also Lord, not just you only, but see ourselves as looking into a mirror. For we are a part of that word. We are part of the body of Christ. So speak to us today by revelation. That's in a manner that only you can. So we submit ourselves to you and this service to you. We ask that you take control of it for your glory. In the name of Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can be seated. My title is the gospel according to the bride part two. And so I hope that brother Gideon if he finds out about this doesn't take offense. They say uh mimic or imitation is this most sincere form of flattery or the highest form of flattery. And so I'm not going to try to repreach it but so inspired by it and blessed by it. I thought well I can't think of a better title for what I want to minister. Felt led to minister tonight other than the gospel according to the bride part two. So brother Giddy and I just preach in a little mini meeting together a miniseries. you want to look at your text and trust that you could just stay focused. I think most of you here are familiar with the way that I minister and so uh maybe it could be laborious but just uh if you just pay attention I believe it'll be a blessing to you. Matthew chapter 5 we'll just start again with verse 14. It says ye are the light of the world. So the bride is the Lord's light. So there speaks of you are the light that's a brightness that's a lamp. You are an emitter of light. So you give light. That's what you are. You're one that shines. And so light here, it speaks of truth and knowledge. And it even symbolizes uh moral and spiritual truth, moral purity. And that's what uh you represent. You represent light. You are to be light. And then it says a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. So if you're light, now Jesus begins to expand upon. Now if you're light, what are we going to do with that light? Says a city that is set on a hill cannot be hid. Neither do men light a candle and put it under a bushel, but on a candlestick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the house. So you must be put uh be you must be in plain view publicly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That if you are the light of the world, if the bride is the light of the world, then you must be in view publicly. That's why anything that tries to get too cultish or too clanish, try to hide itself from view, hide itself from the public, withdraw itself from being servants in the community or whatever it might be, even just being good citizens, then you see that that that's not what the verse is. That's a anti-word. But the gospel so the gospel is not intended to be a secret. &gt;&gt; Now, as it's revealed to you, the revelation of it is for you personally. The mystery of it is for the bride. But the gospel is not to be a secret. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I think there's a lot of layers to that, but I trust you can uh kind of process that in the way that I mean it. So he says, "Let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This glorifying your father which is in heaven. There is a there there's such a a deep meaning in this. I want you to really think about that. that you're going to as light, let your light so shine before men that as you display this light, others will see the light, see your good works, and then glorify your father which is in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Ephesians 5:es 8 to10, it says, "For ye were sometimes darkness, but now are you light in the Lord." I want you to amplify this. Ye are light in the world, and so let your light so shine. He says, uh, that you are now light in the Lord. Now that you're light in the Lord, he says, "Walk as children of the light." So you are children of the light. If light has children, what would it have? Lights. &gt;&gt; Dogs have dogs. Cats have cats. God had children, they'd be gods, right? If you're a child of the light, then you are light, too. So the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness and righteousness and truth, proving what is acceptable unto the Lord. So now that you are light, you are emitters of truth. Now that there's a shining that you're doing and in your life, you're to walk as children of the light. And then he kind of gives this for the fruit of the spirit is in all goodness a and and righteousness. And so these good works, as Jesus refers to it, let your uh light shine that they may see your good works. Good works are characterized as a shining light. What is that shining light? Fruit of the spirit on display. That fruit of goodness and righteousness. a life that is proving what is that perfect and acceptable will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 6 verse 5, he says, "And when thou prayest because kind of thinking in terms of a light, let your light so shine." What does that mean? It kind of it has if you read it one way, it kind of seems showy, right? Like it's this is kind of a a broadcasting or a display. But he says, "When thou prayest, thou shalt not be as the hypocrite are, for they love to pray standing in the synagogues and in the corner of the street, that they may be seen of men. Verily, I say unto you, they have their reward." When it says, "Let your light shine," and there's to be this broadcasting. There's this emmission of light. It is this attention catching brilliance. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That the bride has some attention catching brilliance, but it's not showy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not self-s serving. It's not well we're just going to kind of put on the heirs and we're going to make broad our felactories and we're going to have certain wear certain clothing and certain garments with people look and say whoa they're different they're really different. It's not to be self-s serving. Mark 8:es 34 and 35 it says when he had called the people unto him with the disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it, but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels, the same shall save it. So there's things that we do for the sake of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's an obedience that we do for the gospel's sake, for the sake of Christ, not for our own sake. He says, "Ye are the light of the world." We're not saying, "Oh, this is my moment. This is my 15 minutes of fame and this is everybody's going to know that I'm famous. I'm going to I'm about to go viral." Uh that's not what it's implying that clout or popularity or RZ or aura or any of those things that we so desperately want in these days. It's about having a life that speaks of the fruit of the spirit of goodness and righteousness. &gt;&gt; Now think of this as we look at these scriptures in more detail and just add scripture upon scripture upon scripture. In Colossians chapter 4:5, walk in wisdom toward them that are without redeeming the time. The lot that uh is behind that phrase, redeeming the time. But you're to walk in wisdom. Walk in uh the wisdom of God. Walk in righteousness. Walk in goodness. Walk in the mind of Christ. To walk in wisdom here is not the wisdom of this world, but it's the wisdom of God. To walk in wisdom towards them that are without. So we are to live the gospel for the benefit of others. &gt;&gt; Walk in wisdom toward them or as an example to them that are without wisdom. &gt;&gt; We are to live the gospel for the benefit of those who have not heard the gospel or who do not presently believe the gospel. &gt;&gt; Really think this is what the gospel is. &gt;&gt; That if you believe the gospel, the preaching of the gospel isn't to reinforce that you're right. &gt;&gt; Baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is right. By God, I I was baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ, so I'm right. Holiness unto the Lord is right, and we're holy, so we're right. No, it's not to convince yourselves and everybody else who believes it, but rather the gospel being preached, there's this element that it's for those who've never heard it, &gt;&gt; for those who do not yet believe it, &gt;&gt; to walk in wisdom towards them that are without the body, outside of the body of Christ, to those that are without wisdom. Ephesians 5:es 15, 16, and 17 speaks of the same thing. So see then that you walk circumspectly. That means perfectly, not as fools, but as wise. Again, there's that walk in wisdom. Walk wisely. Walk as the wise, redeeming the time. So that gives you another parallel to Colossians 4. Because the days are evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then us living in the darkest day there's ever been, the most evil day age there has ever been, then this is never more appropriate and applicable that we're to walk circumspectly. We're not to walk foolishly. We're to walk wisely. were to redeem the time because the present age and the evil. It says, "Wherefore, be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the Lord is." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These are scriptures telling us that we are to know God's will. And in knowing God's will, we will obey the will of God. That's wisdom to obey. Walking circumspectly because the days are evil. Paul said that we're to walk in this wisdom redeem the time toward them that are without. So Jesus said, "Let your light so shine before men." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; There's that this brilliance. It's eye-catching brilliance. This light emitter, especially in the darkest age has ever been because the days are evil and an evil day, someone that walks circumspectly is going to stand out. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Any more honestly is is it shocks people, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You go to pay for you go to pay for just a pack of bubble gum and and um you give them a $5 bill and they give you back change for a hundred and you're kind of like, I gave you $5. you just gave me $97 back in change. And and they're like, "Oh my goodness, thank you for being so honest." You're thinking, &gt;&gt; you know, you know, how do people sleep at night? And they say, very good because I sleep on it. What is it? A, you know, serta or something, a mattress, some kind of really expensive mattress. I sleep all night long is what they say. But it's there's this lack of consciousness anymore. So that when you're honest and you're just doing what's decent, people take notice like, wow, that guy put his grocery cart back. &gt;&gt; It's got an upstanding citizen. So in the days of darkness and the days of evil, our right behavior stands out as light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But it says that we are to let our light shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And this this is a scripture that really opened up to me recently. It may be at some time in my mind I thought, well, I I'm going to do good and when I do good, people are going to see that I'm doing good and like, you know what, this son of God is just so awesome. I'm really this guy this guy's figured it out. And they'll give God credit. God, thank you so much for brother Aaron. He's such a good Christian. But there's more that is meant to this in that if you look at it especially in light of these other scriptures and I've got so many much many more that I want to share this with you because I'm wanting you to see this aspect of the gospel according to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The gospel according to the bride is not history. &gt;&gt; The gospel according to the bride is not self-indicating. The gospel according to the bride isn't about her. Even if the Jesus said the spirit of truth will come. He won't speak of himself or testify of himself but he'll show you things to come. Then our gospel has to be pointing to God. It has to be pointing to Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; So there there's not this selfishness involved, but this glorification of God. It means that as you let your light shine that other hearts will be enlightened by your example, &gt;&gt; your honesty, your decency, your holiness, and that in seeing your example, it leads to conviction in their hearts. And following that conviction, they come to know the Lord as you have known them, and they are converted. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let your light so shine before men. Let the gospel be broadcast so that when people would see your good works, it would draw them as salt does. In the prior verses to this, Jesus says, "If the salt loses its flavor, if it loses its power, what is it good for?" &gt;&gt; So when you're salty and you live a certain way, people just don't say, "That's salty. That's that added flavor to my life." No, it makes them thirsty and they want to know where did this come from? Where does where's this truth? Where's this righteousness? Where is this keep in your head while everyone else is losing theirs? You say, "I know I know one who's my peace." &gt;&gt; I found a love that pardons and you begin to testify and witness. &gt;&gt; And so when you are that example, that light that is emitted shines into their hearts. It leads them to conviction and ultimately their conversion. And what happens when they're converted? They glorify God. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is let your light so shine before men that your good works would cause one to be led to God. I realize that uh that the way that I used to view it in a sense was really I mean hardly ever do people see you do good and give God glory for it. &gt;&gt; But the real glory to God is when the heart itself sees God. &gt;&gt; Says this in Ephesians chapter 2 10. I hope this kind of amplifies that that angle I'm looking at tonight. For we are his workmanship. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Workmanship is that which has been made like a work of art created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath before ordained that we should walk in them. Well, think of it this way that if we are to let our light so shine before men that men would see your good works, we're ordained to good works. We're we've been created in Christ Jesus. We are his workmanship for the purpose of good works. And Jesus said it's these good works that'll be a light that shines to others that when they see could potent could come to a place to where they glorify God as well. Paul said now you are light where the fruit of the spirit is all goodness and righteousness and that we are to walk in this light for them are who are without the light. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says we are his workmanship, that which has been made. And if we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus, think of it this way. The artwork that is created, if you're an artist, how many artists do we have here? Just selfidentify today. Anybody? Nobody's Okay, finally. We got one, two, two artists. Well, then they they they could uh well can appreciate this. And I haven't asked for any favors. Uh um but you can subscribe to my Patreon later. But artwork does not the artwork does not receive the honor. &gt;&gt; When somebody paints a painting, they're not looking at the paint and say, "Oh, Monaise. You're so wonderful. You're so beautiful." But when they see the artwork, the one who created the art is the one that's praised. Right. &gt;&gt; You look at a piece of art and I maybe an example that had come to mind recently as well is that you could it's not until you really begin to understand the artist and the context of the art that you can really begin to fully appreciate it. You might just look at something say well that was nice like well that was painted in the 1600s before they had all the colors we have today before there was graphic artist before there was ability to trace and all these things that was painted with using these materials was painted over this period of time. This is what it represents. This is the artist that painted it. this is how old they were and you begin to get more context and all of a sudden the painting comes alive like wow I really appreciate that &gt;&gt; there could be something you look at and like ah that's that's nothing that just looks like cartoon that looks like graffiti and somebody says well that's an original banky all like whoa that thing's beautiful uh uh that is a real that's cultural cultural history and that's a real heritage to the community and it's like so knowing the artist gives us insight into the piece of art itself &gt;&gt; and so when we see a work here. It says, "We are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus by God, new creatures in Christ. We are God's workmanship. Therefore, we are to be pieces of art set on display, not that we would receive glory." That's right. &gt;&gt; But that the artist would receive the glory. &gt;&gt; And so God's purpose for placing light, you are the light of the world. &gt;&gt; A city set on the hill cannot be hid. You're to be in public view. Neither does a man light a candle and put under a bushel, but on a candlestick so that it can give life light to all that are therein. God's purpose for placing light is to give light to others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The city set on a hill is there for one traveling to the city, for one to know that the confines of that city are nearby. That it's it's set on a hill to guide people to to know which way to go. The light is put on a candlestick in a dark room. It says to give light to those to all that are in the house. &gt;&gt; God places you as a light. You are light. You are the light of the world. Now you are light in the Lord. He places you as light so that you can give light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Set on a hill. Put on a candlestick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To give light to others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The gospel according to the bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have a gospel for others to enjoy. the goodness and righteousness and the truth of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Deuteronomy chapter 4:es 5-9 there. I' I've I've laid out what my thought is. Now I want just to give you some ways that what this looks like in scripture, maybe some examples. I failed to look at what time I got up here. So, Brother John, you just tell me when to stop. If there's more than one brother John here, I may be in trouble. Deuteronomy 4:es 5-9. Behold, I have taught you statutes and judgments, even as the Lord my God commanded me, that ye should do so in the land whether you go to possess it. So these commandments have been given to them. You should observe them. You should live by them. You should apply them. Keep therefore and do them. For this is your wisdom and your understanding. Notice in the sight of the nations. Think of this and make application to the word which we have received as the bride. We have a message. We have a word. We have a new testament. It's a lot of things that we could claim to possess and have of our own. Now God as he's given statutes and judgments to Israel when they go to possess their land. He's saying do it because this is your wisdom and your understanding not just to impress one another but in the sight of the Gentiles in the sight of the other nations which shall hear of all these statutes and say surely this is a great nation. This great nation is a wise and understanding people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice what he's saying. that if they were to do what God told them to do, it would be a witness to all their nations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Their wisdom, their understanding, the way that they treat one another, the way that they take care of the poor, the way that they look after one another, the way that they uh take care of their worship and the service to their God. For what nation is there so great? Who hath God so nigh unto them as the Lord our God is in all things that we call upon him for? &gt;&gt; Amen. And what nation is there so great that hath statutes and judgments so righteous as all this law which I set before you this day? Only take heed to thyself and keep thy soul diligently, lest thou forget the things which thine eyes have seen, and lest they depart from thy heart all the days of thy life, but teach them thy sons and thy son's sons. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What are these statutes and judgments? It's the law. These divine instructions that God here is saying contain wisdom and understanding of God. That your wisdom and understanding will be seen in light of all the nations. And this learning and keeping of the law, this wisdom and understanding demonstrates wisdom. It demonstrates the understanding of God. And he says, "Keep these things. Teach these things so that you can continue to demonstrate this wisdom through your obedience." And when it says that other nations will see it, I know in our minds we think, "Oh, everybody's going to agree. Everybody's going to see it." Not everybody does. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that I I I can't make you believe it. And and maybe just paraphrase a little bit. He says, "It's not my responsibility to make you believe." All I I'm just required and I'm responsible to preach it. &gt;&gt; So you're not responsible to get everybody to agree with the gospel or say, "I like that. That's good." Or give God glory. But you're responsible for sharing it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Responsible for living it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when it says that these other nations would see your wisdom and understanding and say, "Wow, what a great nation these people are. Who has a God like this?" He's saying that the Gentiles would be influenced to reject idol worship. &gt;&gt; And serve the one true God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he's saying Israel was to be an example. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they were witnessing by their works, not by their words. &gt;&gt; Right? They they weren't going to uh you know the gentile markets and the gentile places and preaching on the street corner necessarily. They weren't telling you you circumcised heathens, right? They they lived they treated the stranger well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They treated one another well. And and as they as they lived and conducted themselves, people say, "You know what? There's something different about this people &gt;&gt; and this God they serve. &gt;&gt; I want to know this God. I want to be a part of this." &gt;&gt; Amen. We know that their religion was by by their government. It was their religion was their way of life. And there was a lot that was there. So if one was going to be converted, they'd be converting to Judaism. But it's a shadow of Christianity. In 1 Peter 2 11 and 12, it says, "Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles. Just as it was spoken to Israel, that their wisdom and understanding could be displayed in the sight of the Gentiles, which are the nations, the people. He says, "Have your conversation honest among the Gentiles, that whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may be they may by your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A lot that's being mentioned here &gt;&gt; that there is something in your heart that is honest. And you have this honest conversation among the Gentiles. And he says that they may speak evil against you as evildoers, but they may by your good works. If you do something wrong and they say something wrong about you, you earned that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If if you misbehave, if you're dishonest, if you hurt, if you pain somebody, if they they speak against you as an evildoer, you you've asked for it. But but they may by your good works which they shall behold, they'll see it glorify God in the day of visitation. that there's a time even a time when God visits them or there's this time going to be why would they glorify God in the day of visitation if it hadn't been your good works &gt;&gt; that gave him a place of safety and refuge in that day of visitation &gt;&gt; in 2 Kings 5:es 1 to18 it's been a while since we've heard this story and and this is what really inspired me and I just felt the Lord linked some things together and I just felt this open door to minister on this subject but Sunday brother Gideon preached on the gospel according to the bride. His text was here and he ended in this story. And so I I'm I'm not going to try to bring out all the things that he brought out because I think it was just perfect and I wouldn't want to add anything to it. But with the benefit of that, let's just look at it again because we've had this so recently in our hearts &gt;&gt; and and brother Justin, I don't know if you need to go get it on the archive, but you're familiar with the story in 2 Kings 5:es 1-8. says, "Now non captain of the host of the king of Syria was a great man with his master and honorable because by him the Lord had given deliverance unto Syria. He was also a mighty man in valor, but he was a leper." What a de speaking of this captain non this captain to the king of Syria and he's a mighty man and God had actually given a deliverance to Syria because of this honorable man but he's a leper and he's categorized now in one of the worst classes of people and the Syrians had gone out by companies and had brought away captive out of the land of Israel a little maid and she waited on non's wife so now you can see these degrees of separation you have the the girl little Israelite girl who's been captured She's a servant to Non's wife. So here's the wife. Then there's non. There's the king. So she's she's a few ways down. And she said unto her mistress, "Would God, my lord, where were with the prophet? Would God, my lord, non were with the prophet that is in Samaria, for he would recover him of his leprosy." So here is this maid who's testifying. I know the word of God is powerful enough. I know there's a power present to heal a man even of his leprosy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Perhaps non's wife was lamenting, "My husband's a leper. We've been ostracized from social gatherings. He's should be this honorable man above what he has given and is uh this privilege that he would have." He says, "Uh uh we're we're just in this category of people that are rejected and there's so much sorrow." Maybe she's lamenting and and the mistress just testifies, "I just wish that my Lord I just wish Non could be in the presence of this prophet in Samaria and I know God could heal him." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Reminds me of even said, "Oh Jesus, if you had been here, my brother hadn't died." &gt;&gt; And all these things that just have so much confidence in in God in this way. And one went in and told his Lord, saying, "Thus and thus," said the maid that is in the land of Israel. I like how it just kind of says thus and thus, &gt;&gt; right? So it's like thus and thus. Now we we have scriptural reason to say well what did they say? Not thus and thus. But we read it said she said you know that I just wish that my my master naming could be in the presence of the prophet. He'd be cured of his leprosy. But the word gets to uh uh the Lord. And then the king of Syria said uh go to go and I will send a letter to the king of Israel. And he departed and took with him 10 talents of silver and 6,000 pieces of gold and 10 changes of raignment. He brought the letter to the king of Israel, saying,"Now when this letter has come unto thee, behold, I have therew with sent name in my servant to thee, that thou mayest recover him of his leprosy." There was a little bit of a misunderstanding. The thus and thus didn't convey that it was a prophet in Samaria, not a king, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But yet there, this is what they're seeking. And it came to pass when the king of Israel read the letter, he rent his clothes and said, "Am I God to kill and to make alive that this man doth send unto me to recover a man of his leprosy? Wherefore consider I pray you and see how he maketh the quarrel against me. So there's where even it's now it's misunderstood. &gt;&gt; There's just a little bit of a testifying. Someone hears it says, "Oh, we need to go to Israel because there's a king there and he'll be able to recover non of his leprosy." And now the king of Israel thinks this is mischief. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is doing this because he knows I can't heal this man of leprosy. and I am now tested and tempted to take gold in these things or if I try anything and it doesn't work I'm going to be blamed he means mischief. But then it says and it was so when Elisha the man of God had heard that the king of Israel had rent his clothes that he sent to the king saying wherefore hast thou rent thy clothes. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So there's a lot that's being communicated in this. There's a lot of thus and thus that's being conveyed around and they did this without the benefit of X Twitter. the old folks. &gt;&gt; There wasn't Elisha wasn't in the snap group &gt;&gt; with uh with all these people and realizing something's going wrong at the palace there. This is word is getting around. And so it says that Elisha hears and he says uh let him come to me and he shall know that there is a prophet in Israel. Amen. &gt;&gt; So non came with his horses and with his chariot and stood at the door of the house of Elijah. And Elijah sent a messenger unto him, saying, "Go and wash in Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean." &gt;&gt; Now, this is the word of God uh through the messenger. So you have Elisha who has sends the message through his messenger. And this messenger is faithful to it. And the response initially isn't good. Non's angry. and he went away and said, "Behold, I thought he will surely come out to me." So maybe some pretense. I'm an honorable man. Surely that the prophet, if it was important for me to hear, he would have delivered it to me face to face. He needs to be in my I need to be in his presence. He would stand and call on the name of the Lord with his God and strike his hand over the place and recover the leper. So what do you want? Something fantastic. Maybe a prayer line, right? Maybe that's that's what we need. We need a prayer line. We need some excitement. Get the music going, right? Set the atmosphere. Put it on a stage and a platform so everybody can see. Make sure this hits the stream. make sure this goes viral. And so there's a he's wanting this to be very uh maybe ceremonial. And Elisha sent a message to him saying, "Go and wash in the Jordan seven times, and thy flesh shall come again to thee, and thou shalt be clean." But non was wroth and went away and said, "Behold, I thought he will surely come to me and stand and call in the name of his God, and strike his hand over the place, and and recover the leper. Are not Avana and Farfar rivers of Damascus better than all the waters of Israel? May I not wash in them and be clean? So he turned and went away in a rage. And his servants came near and spake unto him and said,"My father," this is just uh beautiful. These things set in motion by a maid. One comment by a maid, "These things that are set, my father, if the prophet had bid thee to do some great thing, wouldest thou not have done it? How much rather than when he saith unto thee, wash and be clean?" Now what a striking statement. Hey, you wish he would have had you do something great. &gt;&gt; You wish he would have had you travel all the way back to these clean rivers. You wish that he would have come and had some sort of ceremony. You you're wishing that there was more to it. He's just saying, "Wash and be clean." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just believe. And it and it's such a simple simple gospel, a simple message, and it struck non's heart. Then went he down and dipped himself seven times in Jordan, according to the saying of the man of God, and his flesh came again like unto the flesh of a little child, and he was clean. &gt;&gt; All by the testimony of this maid &gt;&gt; who knew the truth, &gt;&gt; who spoke a word. Oh, I just wish he could get in the presence of that prophet. Prophet maybe even demonstrated. It doesn't need to be in the presence of the prophet. It's obedience to the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. But it says in verse 15, he returned to the man of God. He and all his company had came and he stood before him and said, "Behold now I know that there is no God in all earth but in Israel." Now notice where who he's glorifying. &gt;&gt; Not glorifying the king of Israel. &gt;&gt; Not glorifying his own king. Not glorifying the prophet. Not glorifying the maid. Not glorifying his friends who said, "Whoa, slow down. Why don't you just go do it?" He glorifies God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's no God in all the earth. Remember how God said, "If you keep my commandments, if you live in wisdom and understanding that all nations will will say there's no other God like thee." Here's an example where one says there's no god in all the earth but in Israel like this. &gt;&gt; Now therefore I pray thee take a blessing of thy servant. But he said as the Lord liveth before whom I stand I will receive none. And he urged him to take it but he refused. And non said shall there shall there not then I pray thee be given to thy servant two mules burden of earth. Notice this. It's just really really uh uh striking. Give to me calls himself a servant. two mules burden of earth. For thy servant will henceforth offer neither burnt offering nor sacrifice unto other gods but unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The healing was wonderful. &gt;&gt; That's part of the atonement. &gt;&gt; Divine healing. But what's the other part? Salvation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The bride's gospel has divine healing in it. The bride's gospel has salvation. Healing of the soul. And notice through this great miracle and this work of witnessing, he wants to take earth from Israel. And he says,"I will not offer any other sacrifice to any other gods except in the Lord. In this thing the Lord pardon thy servant, that when my master goeth into the house of Rimman to worship thee, and he leanth on my hand, and I bow myself in the house of Rimman, when I bowed myself in the house of Reman, the Lord pardoned thy servant in this thing." Now he's repenting. Amen. &gt;&gt; Of his idol worship. &gt;&gt; He's repenting of the false gods. He's repenting of the ideology and idolatry and all this spiritual fornication in his life. In this thing, Lord, forgive me when I have worshiped in the house of the false god. Let me now take and it's maybe some fanaticism. Let me take earth from Israel and bring it to where I am in Syria so that I can build an altar on dirt from uh Israel where God lives and God dwells. And there I will praise God. and there I will glorify God on dirt from Israel because there's only one true God and it's the God that's with Israel. &gt;&gt; He says, "Forgive me in this idol worship." I know it speaks in uh maybe future tense, but as I wrestled with this and just really wanted to understand it myself, there could be this pre-adventure. If I ever worship a false idol again, Lord, forgive me in that thing. &gt;&gt; If it be by peer pre peer pressure, a mistake or just memory, Lord, forgive me. But there's this repentance that's being done. If I have bowed where I have bowed myself to this false god, forgive me for my idolatry, I believe now in the one true God. &gt;&gt; What we see in this maid's story is her faith testified of a God who could heal her master's husband or spouse of leprosy. And it set in motion a chain of events that led to this honorable man who was a mighty man in valor that God had seen something in him. And God had ordained captivity, poor circumstances, you name it, to where there's one witness, one testimony, and it leads to now this great man saying, "I will from henceforth forever serve the one true God." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The gospel according to the bride, that's you demonstrating truth for Christ's sake. for Christ's glory and for someone else's benefit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we have a message, if we have a gospel, if we are the final voice to the final age, if if we've got thus sayith the Lord or keep still, if we have the mind of Christ to know what he wants done with the word, then God has a purpose in it. There's something that he wants to accomplish by it. And I'm not trying to give you the whole gospel or every aspect of it and what it can accomplish. But the gospel is given to you and you have good news. You have a gospel to share to give glory to Christ. and to benefit someone else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice what the scripture says in 1 Peter chapter 3:es 1-2. Likewise, ye wives, be in subjection to your own husbands. I pause for all the husbands to say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can keep going. I'm behind in my water consumption today. I got to get 64 ounces while I preach and I'm not stopping until I get all 64. Maybe there'll be a part three. 1 Peter chapter 3:es 1 and 2. Likewise, you wives be in subjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the word, they also may without the word be one by the conversation of the wives. &gt;&gt; We understand what the scripture is saying. wives, believing wives, be in subjection to your own husbands, that if any of them do not believe the gospel, if they won't obey the word, they also may without the word, without believing would be one to the gospel by the life, the conduct and character of the wives, while they behold your chasteed conversation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Coupled with fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The chasteed conversation. &gt;&gt; Amen. is that holiness, that sanctity, that faithfulness in life coupled with fear. That's not just the fear of God, even reverence and respect for the husband. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's a lot that um I'm pointing to in this in terms of the teaching of the the wife and the husband and those relationships. I know there's a lot in that, but just take it into our mind what's taught about the role of these spouses and here speaking specifically of a believing wife who has an unbelieving husband is saying that the wisdom of the word is demonstrated without speaking by obedience to the word. &gt;&gt; She doesn't have to be like, well, Christian wouldn't do that and you're not supposed to do that on and on and on nagging about what the Bible says. You know what the Bible says about that, right? That's probably not going to work. But it's saying that if you will serve your husband as a believer ought to serve their husband. Your obedience to the word will begin to work in the heart of the husband that he might be one. That means to gain one to faith in Christ. One who before was faithless that they may be one to Christ by what? By seeing this reverential fear of God, reverence, respect for their husband and holy life. &gt;&gt; Amen. to be one through your gospel lived the testimony. It's not being able to sit down and say, "Husband, I got something to show you here. You believe in trinitarian baptism, but let me show you something right here. If you want to turn to your Bibles right now, I want you to show you in the Bible where the trinitarian baptism is wrong." Okay. All right. You know, you explained it really, really well. So maybe that's true. And you said, "Well, the Bible says this and the Bible says it's a sh sin to do this and it's a shame to do that." He's like, "Well, I guess I'm ashamed. &gt;&gt; Guess I'm a sinner." It's in that you could live the word of God in such a way to where it pricks the heart of the the husband, &gt;&gt; the heart of that spouse, &gt;&gt; and he begins to get thirsty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it wins him. &gt;&gt; Amen. If &gt;&gt; I could put it this way, the gospel is muted by a believing wife who's not subject to her unbelieving husband. The Bible's saying that if you are not if a believing wife and I'm not trying to I'm not trying to move into these areas and I'm not using it to make a point to situations here. I'm clueless. I just like to fish with brother Ron. So if I want to talk about fishing and things like that if you want to say what do we know about this church? Well, I know we like to fish, right? It's all the socializing I've done in this church. So I'm not trying to make a point about anything. I'm just showing you an example in the scripture &gt;&gt; wherein the believing spouse makes an impact on the unbelieving and wins them to Christ. &gt;&gt; So what happens when we don't obey the gospel? What is he saying here that if a believing wife is disrespectful a and mistreats her husband? It mutes the power of the gospel. Second Peter chapter 2:2 and many shall follow their pernitious ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of. And if you look in the context of this, he's saying Christianity is going to be blamed for your bad behavior. &gt;&gt; Those that profess to believe the truth, who act peritiously, those who profess to be message believers, those that profess to be Christians, those that profess to be men of God, who abuse the people, who live unfaithfully, who live double lives, who live hypocritically, who fleece the people. I saw something today where God spoke to a pastor in Denver to tell everybody to invest in his crypto exchange that he created, heaven's exchange or something like that and got like $1.5 million and spend it all on himself and his wife. He said the Lord told him to do it. He said, "I was just doing it believing that God would reward them for their faithfulness and their giving and I've obeyed the Lord and I'm going to suffer this trial. This is an evil assignment against my life." Why is he just he's just a frost? He's just a con man. &gt;&gt; What happens? Of course. What do the publications say? Of course he was a pastor. Of course he was a Christian. That's what these Christians do. &gt;&gt; And it's a shame that that is the case anymore. That Christians have some of the worst testimonies. &gt;&gt; They're right up there with lawyers when it comes to really, really bad reputation. But professing believers who act unwise or dishonestly or disobedient or do not honor the word are a reproach to the gospel, the very thing that they are called to preach. In Acts 4:13, it says this, "And when they had saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceiving that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marveled and they took knowledge of them that they had been with Jesus." Notice now how their lives, how they lived. They saw their boldness, their manner, their character, the way they conducted themselves and they marveled and they took note that they had been with Jesus. In other words, they were reflecting the life and the teaching of the one they followed. &gt;&gt; It says they'd been with Jesus. They didn't notice that they had the wristband from having been at the sermon on the mount. Didn't mean that they had had got the stamp and their passport for being on the boat uh when they crossed the the sea. No, they looked at it. It says, "These are people that we identify with the kind of nature and character, the teaching of the one they professed to follow." &gt;&gt; It says in Actsap 11 26, "And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. It came to pass at a whole year they assembled themselves with the church and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch." Christian, that's Cristianos, a follower of Christ, &gt;&gt; right? because they were a follower of Christ. They were they obeyed the teachings of Christ. They were Cristiano is speaking that they were im they they imitated Christ. &gt;&gt; And notice it's not that the Christians it took them a year to come up with a name for themselves. They gathered together for a year and they they they kind of broke out and they had these these uh spitball sessions and these uh name building groups and got these committees and they took a whole year and they put it up for boat uh vote and it wasn't Christian mcch Christian or whatever it is. Bodie McBod face or whatever. That's not what was voted in. Nobody voted on it. The people said the people said these are Christians. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They might have used it as a term of derision. They might have used it to try to make fun of them, but at least they were faithfully reflecting the one they claimed to follow. &gt;&gt; They were followers of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham in the sermon, God's chosen place of worship says in his promised word, you won't have to interpret it. He will interpret it &gt;&gt; through you. &gt;&gt; Yes, &gt;&gt; man. Okay. I thought I got out of that. &gt;&gt; Thought he would just use the prophet to interpret it. He's the divine interpreter of the word always, right? We just say it's the prophet so I don't have to interpret it. Well, you can misinterpret it then by the way you live, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; I'm not an interpreter of the message. I don't interpret the message. I just say what the tapes say and then live contrary to the tapes. Yeah. You're not an interpreter of the message. You're a misinterpreter of the message. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; If you don't live what the word says because he says he will interpret it through you what you're doing what he promised to do. The church that follows him will be so much like him until the people will know. &gt;&gt; That's what we want. &gt;&gt; I don't want to have to interpret it. I want him to interpret it through me. &gt;&gt; A life lived by the word will be the word expressed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; First Peter chapter 3 13-1 17. And who is he that will harm you if you be followers of that which is good? Listen to this. He's expounding upon this, but just want you to catch these narrow principles in this. But and if you but and if you suffer for righteousness sake, happy are ye. And be not afraid of their terror, neither be you troubled. But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts, and be ready always to give an answer to every man that askketh you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear. &gt;&gt; We ought to sanctify God in our hearts and be ready to answer when they have a question. ready to answer anybody who asks you a reason of the hope that is in you with meekness and fear. &gt;&gt; So there's a certain uh disposition and character you want to have in answering. But why are they even going to ask you the question? If the whole world is doing something and you're doing along with them, nobody's going to say, "Well, what's your how do you have so much hope?" You're you're going along with the masses. &gt;&gt; You're dressing like them, acting like them, doing all the things that they do. They're not going to ask you. But when your life is lived in such a way to where it's it's counterculture, not because you're trying to be a hipster, &gt;&gt; not because you're trying to be different, not because you're trying to get clicks, but you're different because you obey the word of God, then they're going to ask you, "Where's your hope?" It says, "Having a good conscience that whereas they speak evil of you as evildoers, they may be ashamed that falsely accuse your good conversation in Christ. For it is better if the will of God be so that you suffer for welloing than for evildoing. &gt;&gt; There's a there's a there's a messaging in the way that you live, the way you treat people, &gt;&gt; the way you treat them when you're checking out at the gas station &gt;&gt; or the grocery store, the way you treat people when you come into contact with them. Whether it be in hospitality situations or it be in uh point of sale transactions, whatever, there's a way that you're you're you're messaging. You're sharing something. &gt;&gt; The way that we treat other people. &gt;&gt; I had a I saw a tweet one time. I saved it. It's been a number of years now, maybe five or six years since I've seen it. I don't know that I've used it here ever, but uh preaching here for 24 years, so I've already preached everything I know already. This is just a reheat from maybe 2006. I don't know. But there's a tweet said something like and it was a server is and if you ever worked in the restaurant industry I think you have and they say that there's nothing worse than seeing a church crowd come on Sunday. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's the truth &gt;&gt; because they treat the staff the worst. They don't tip. They act entitled. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; And this is the this is what's representing Christianity. &gt;&gt; And who wants to go to your church, &gt;&gt; right? If that's the way you treat people when you get out of church. &gt;&gt; They should be ashamed to falsely accuse you. They'll they'll lie about you. They'll say all sorts of things about you. But when they they'll be ashamed if it's false, but it's better if the will of God be so that you suffer for welloing than for evildoing. &gt;&gt; Get kicked out of a restaurant because you're rude. Don't say it's because you're a Christian, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Don't say it's because they didn't like your long hair. They said because they know this and they know that. If you're rude, if you're not Christlike, then you're you're you're be you're you're suffering for evildoing. Amen. &gt;&gt; 1 Thessalonians chapter 4:12. That you may walk honestly toward them that are without &gt;&gt; and that you may have lack of nothing. Chew on that. &gt;&gt; We're to walk honestly with integrity and righteously towards them that are what? Without honesty, without the gospel, without truth. Those that are without the body of Christ. So this is you are to be honest towards them that are not Christians. Right? &gt;&gt; Why is it we think sometimes that if they're not a brother, they're not a message believer, they don't believe in the prophet, that we can just treat him however we want. &gt;&gt; Well, my neighbor, he's just a rank heathen. I'm going to drive on his lawn. I'm not going to obey him. He told me to do this. I'm not do you're not a Christian. We can just treat people any way we want if they don't believe the message. I said, "Well, you know, he's a believer." Oh, excuse me. I'm so sorry. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; I had one one guy one time, he was a Christian. He was in theological school there in Fort Worth and they were doing he's part of a group that did a lot of investing in houses. And as an attorney, I was doing some work for him and he said, we were talking about the feed. He goes, and you know what? I'm I'm a Christian. So, what do you want? He wanted the brother deal, right? And I just said, oh, man. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; I said, I just And it said it just like this. I said, I I just can't believe it. I said, I'm I'm just so happy to finally have a client who, because I'm a Christian, is willing to pay me more for what I do. &gt;&gt; Love it. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Oh, no. I was actually thinking the other way around. But that's all I needed to say, right? Before you realize, why would I want to defraud my brother? &gt;&gt; He's a Christian. Why would I want to pay him less, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Anybody needs some legal work? I think I've kind of established some expectations. &gt;&gt; But this it's when we mistreat others, then we're not walking honestly towards them that are without. And then it says that ye may lack of nothing. Could it be where we lack be directly attributable to our attitude towards others? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Walk honestly towards them that are not Christians, those that are without wisdom, though that those are without the gospel, those that don't believe. So that you won't whack for anything, God is even promising them that if you could walk uprightly, if you can be faithful to the gospel, if you could faithfully, the gospel according to the bride can truly be light emmitting, saying, "I'll take care of you." says in Galatians chapter 6:es 9 and 10, "And let us not be weary and welloing, for in due season we shall reap if we faint not. As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, especially unto them who are of the household of faith." In other words, pay your lawyer a little bit more if he's a believer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But he says we should do good unto all men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know we like the especially unto them of the household of faith because we have a very specific duty to those within the household. We're to look out after one another. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; You realize if we as believers did our duty, I'm just gonna go ahead and maybe I can start evangelizing. Brother Kyre ever preached here? &gt;&gt; No. If this room could handle him, I might just start like a hound dog start sniffing something out. &gt;&gt; But if believers would just do their responsibility, &gt;&gt; it would it would unbburden so many other people who end up doing everything. Did you know that if you just paid your tithe like you're supposed to, &gt;&gt; the church would never lack for anything, &gt;&gt; nor would the ministry. &gt;&gt; Pay your tithes like you should, give your offers like you should, support missions like you should, and everything's going to be taken care of. &gt;&gt; And the Bible teaches that families are to take care of their family. &gt;&gt; And that's why that's why when you lose the the bedrock of Christianity, that's why you need nursing homes. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the Bible taught you take care of your parents. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not the responsibility of the church. It was a responsibility of the family to take care of the widow. &gt;&gt; And then if she didn't if she lacked family and there wasn't, then the church is there to take care of them. &gt;&gt; There's so much that's missed out on in the gospel when we're not doing right. &gt;&gt; But don't be weary and welloing, but let us do good unto all men. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 17:19, "And for their sakes I sanctify myself, sacrifice for the sake of others." The gospel according to the bride isn't the gospel of the bride. It's not the gospel for the bride. It's the gospel according to the bride. &gt;&gt; And what is her message? What is her good news? We've read enough already in this that the lives we live even in our particular absences, the things we don't do as believers and the things we will do as believers isn't so much just to identify ourselves to other believers, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But to identify Christ to those who aren't believers. &gt;&gt; And they may look at it and not want it. They may hear it and not believe in it. That's just what they're going to do. But could it be that there's one who can see your chasteed conversation and in the heart and say that looks like something that's real? &gt;&gt; He sanctified themselves for their sakes that they might be sanctified through the truth. It wasn't just sanctification for himself and also for the example but that by that example they too could be sanctified through truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to close on an example of three four believers. I want to use the example of Daniel, Haniah, Aariah, and Misha. You may know them as Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. But I'm sure you're familiar with the story and most if not all look out, everybody here is well taught. And I'm sure even within your homes, you do your devotions. You read your Bible and pray and these are things you understand. But Daniel, Haniah, Azariah, Michelle, they're part of a larger group of princes and wise young men are uh born of royalty, good bloodline that are kidnapped and they're now exiled in a Calaldian uh nation, Calaldian culture in Babylon. And they attempt to brainwash them. They attempt to teach them the language to eat the food. And they're trying in every way they can to break them. It's kind of like uh Babylon boot camp &gt;&gt; so that they would just obey and become these models of Calaldanss. But it says in Daniel 1:8, "Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the king's meat, nor with the wine which he drank. Therefore, he requested the prince of the Unix that he might not defile himself." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just trying to see how many There's only eight ounces. I need eight more of these. You would think with humid as is here, I could just breathe and get enough water. But he purposes in his heart that he not defile himself with the king's meat, the wine, and he says, and he asked for what? Water and vegetables. What was this by Daniel? A deliberate decision to not violate God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was going to take the time tonight. I could show you exactly where the commandment to not drink wine pertain to him, to princes. It pertain to those who are of a good bloodline and and royal royal family. I can show you in the word of God that he could not he was to abstain from eating meat sacrificed to idols. So Daniel wasn't a vegan. No offense to our vegans here. Sorry granola crowd. But he was standing for the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's what he was standing for. He said, "No, the word of God says and that's what I'm going to do. I'm going to obey the word of God." So he chose not to violate what? God's statutes and God's judgments &gt;&gt; in the face of pressure. &gt;&gt; This is where we really need to understand. There's a lot of times that Christians want to be activist and and they want to be radical about it and they want to they want to revolt. &gt;&gt; The word of God does not call us. Our obedience to the word of God does not require us to be revolutionary. &gt;&gt; Doesn't even require us to overthrow ungodly rulers. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; The the religion does not command our religion does not command us to do that. maybe one of the few religions that's not advocating for violence in the face of oppression, but say take it patiently. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; And so in the face of pressure though, we can't violate God's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, I will not violate God's word. So it says in verse 16, thus Melar took away the portion of their meat and the wine that they should drink and gave them pulse vegetables. As for these four children, God gave them knowledge and skill and all learning and wisdom. And Daniel had understanding in all visions and dreams. &gt;&gt; God told them, he promised them, "If you'll keep these statutes and these judgments, the Gentiles, the heathens will look at you and say, "What wisdom is there?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What understanding, what laws, what judgments? And God is giving them according to his word. Now, at the end of the days, the king had said he was should bring them in. Then the prince of Enix brought them in before Nebuchadnezzar. And the king communed with them and among all them all and among them all was found none like Daniel, Henaniah, Misha and Azariah. Therefore stood they before the king. In other words, they he singled them out as being wise and knowledgeable. &gt;&gt; And in all matters of wisdom and understanding, the king inquired them. He found them 10 times better than all the magicians and astrologers that were in all his realm. &gt;&gt; Listen, young people, you don't have to resort to the things of this world to get ahead. the the the magicians, the astrologers, all the gimmicks and the get-richqu things and all the hustling and everything the world may try to get you to do. You don't need to do that. Honor God's word. &gt;&gt; That that's your secret to success. That's how you're going to stand above the rest. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; So, here we see in this chapter one example that they make this stand for the word of God and God singles them out and blesses them. And we understand that in the next chapter the the he's his dream is unable to be interpreted. Daniel interprets the dream and the king is so uh moved by that that he commands an image of Daniel to be erected &gt;&gt; and that everyone at the sound of the music is to bow down and worship this image of Daniel. And so maybe to Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego that might have been like their hero. That could have been the guy they looked up to. But they're maybe looking at us like this is our buddy. This is our brother. Uh but yet they were under the threat of death to worship this image. That would have been a violation of God's word. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; And if you are curious about Brother Bam teaches that that image was Daniel. &gt;&gt; If you want to take exception to that, then just explain to me why Daniel wasn't thrown in the lion's den. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because then if he you would either be assuming one thing that he worshiped and that's why he wasn't subject to punishment. &gt;&gt; But we know that's not true. &gt;&gt; But the other thing would be if it's an image of himself, he wouldn't be required to worship it. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's &gt;&gt; right there in the word of God. And so after they have been cast into the lion's den and they have been preserved or excuse me after they've been cast into the fiery furnace for they refused to bow down. It says in Daniel 3:es 28 and 30, then Nebuchadnezzar spake and said, "Blessed be the God of Shadrach, Meshach, and Abedneo, who has sent his angel and delivered his servants that trusted him and have changed the king's word and yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own god." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is now this is a king recognizing that this is more than just a a an aversion to red meat. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is more than an allergy with wine, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; This is more than just a healthy lifestyle and a nutritional mindset where they want to drink water and eat vegetables and they this is not just genetics where they excelled from everybody but they have this core conviction that will not allow them to violate God's word. And they stood there says we will not bow down to worship the image and and our God is able to save us. They evoked Elohim. They evoked Yahweh. They evoked the one true God. No other god. They said, "But even if he doesn't save us, we're still not going to violate his word." &gt;&gt; So it moved Nebuchadnezzar, my blessed be the God of them. It says in Daniel 4:es 1:3, Nebuchadnezzar the king unto all people, nations, and languages that dwell in all the earth, peace be multiplied unto you. I thought it good to show the signs and wonders that the high God hath wrought toward me. How great are his signs. How mighty are his wonders. &gt;&gt; Right? His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom and his dominion is from generation to generation. &gt;&gt; He's saying things that Jews hadn't said in the Bible. &gt;&gt; He is prophesying. He is glorifying the Lord. This is a gentile king. How great is his signs. We sing these words. &gt;&gt; These are the words of a a heathen king who says, "Mighty are his wonders. His kingdom is an everlasting kingdom. And his kingdom shall know no end." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And his glory shall know no bounds. from generation to generation. How great is this God? Mighty are his wonders. &gt;&gt; Begins to praise the Lord. Then notice here in verse 28 of that chapter, and all this came upon King Nebuchadnezzar at the end of 12 months. He walked in the palace of the kingdom of Babylon. King spake and said, because God's blessing him, he's he's giving honor to the one true God. Is it not is not this king great Babylon that I have built for the house of the kingdom by the might of my power and for the honor of my majesty while the word was in the king's mouth there fell a voice from heaven saying oh king Nebuchadnezzar to thee it is spoken the kingdom is departed from thee and they shall drive thee from men and thy dwelling shall be with the beast of the field &gt;&gt; it shall make thee to eat grasses oxen and seven times shall pass over thee until thou know that the Most High ruleth in the kingdom of men and giveth it to whomsoever he will. I want you to recognize this. I want to read in uh chapter five. Come back to chapter four. Just I want to read a little bit more in five and four. I think we're doing good on time, I think. So, I want to finish the story of Nebuchadnezzar, but I want to pause here and make this point. God is dealing with Nebuchadnezzar as a son. &gt;&gt; He's not dealing with him as a heathen king and just ripping it away and tearing him up. He's saying, "I'm I'm going to deal with you until you will come to your senses and say that God rules the kingdom of men." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That he gives to whomsoever he will. The same hour was the thing fulfilled upon Nebuchadnezzar, and he was driven from men and did eat grass and ox. His body was wet with the dew of heaven till his hairs were grown like eagle's feathers and his nails like bird's claws. Madness came over. Daniel chapter 5 17 to 24 says then then Daniel answered and said before the king let thy gifts be to thyself give thy rewards to another yet I will read the writing of the king make known to him the interpretation so now we see maybe I should I don't know if I need to read more but we know where we are in the scripture says oh thou king the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory glory and honor. So, Belshazzar in his feast and in his feasting, is everybody familiar with the story? I don't know if I need to go through this more. I'm just realizing maybe now I'm assuming too much in terms of what the scripture speaks of, but Nebuchadnezzar is no longer king. This is in the next chapter. And he's throwing a feast and he's feasting after the false gods and he's worshiping false gods. And in doing so, there's writing on the wall and he's being judged. God's going to judge him. And this is the this is what the David Daniel says. Oh thou king, the most high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom and majesty and glory and honor. Please just stay with me. If I'm fumbling around, I apologize. And for the majesty that he gave him, all people, nations, and languages trembled and feared before him, whom he would would sue, and whom he would kept alive, and whom he would set up, and whom he would put down. But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was disposed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him. And he was driven from the sons of men, and his heart was made like the beast, as dwelling as with was with the wild asses. They fed him with grass like oxen and his body was wet with the dew of heaven till he knew that the most high God ruled in the kingdom of men and that he appointed over it whomsoever he will. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So what God said would happen in Daniel 4 happens to Nebuchadnezzar and he remains in that condition until he knows and he realizes the error of his ways and he says God rules in the kingdom of men. So look what had been done in the eyes of Belshazzar his father. It says Nebuchadnezzar thy father had a kingdom that God had given him. So let's go back to verse 34 in Daniel chapter 4. And at the end of the days I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes unto heaven. So it says that he did eat grass as oxen. His body was wet with the dew. His hairs were like eagle's feathers. His nails like bird claws. He'd completely given over to madness and and to act amalistic. But now at the end of the days says, I Nebuchadnezzar lifted up mine eyes into heaven and my understanding returned unto me and I blessed the most high. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I praised and honored him that liveth forever whose dominion is an everlasting dominion and his kingdom is from generation to generation. He's come back to his conviction again. Come back to that utterance he gave when he saw the power of God and the glory. That moment when I could say his heart turned to the Lord. Away from making images of the prophet, away from making images to false gods. He said, "There's the one true God. Let us give him honor, let him give his glory." And he comes back to that core revelation. His kingdom is forever. &gt;&gt; And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing. And he doeth according to his will in the army of heaven and among the inhabitants of the earth. And none can stay his hand or say him, "What doest thou?" At the same time, my reason returned me. This is his testimony. And for the glory of my kingdom, my honor and brightness returned unto me, and my counselss and my lords sought unto me. And I was established in my kingdom, and excellent majesty was added unto me. Now I, Nebuchadnezzar, praise and extol and honor the king of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All whose works are truth, and his ways judgment, and those that walk in pride, he is able to abase. &gt;&gt; There may be times when our gospel is muted. There may be things we do and we make our mistakes. We get lifted up in pride, we fall. Maybe we find ourselves wandering a little bit, but we've got to come back to this revelation and this gospel and declaration. It's not about excusing me myself, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; Well, I just wanted to go undercover like a madman and I this is the God doing this. This is the evil things. This is the government. This is this is no, he acknowledged that his judgments were because of his own pride. &gt;&gt; But he came back to that great exaltation of God. Bless the most high. Now I praise and extol and honor the king of heaven. Amen. &gt;&gt; All whose works are truth and his ways judgment. What he does is just. What he says is truth. He says there's no arguing with him. And those that walk in pride as I did, he is able and he will obease. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God dealt with him as a son. He came back to his mind. And this is his gospel. And this is the example that Daniel is saying. The most high God gave your father majesty, glory, and honor. And what did Nebuchadnezzar? What was his witness in testament? not all his majesty, glory, and honor, but it went to the king. So Daniel continues in verse 22, "And thou," verse chapter 5, "And thou his son, and thou his son, oh Bazar, hast not humbled thine heart, though thou kneest all this." &gt;&gt; What did he know? There was a good God. &gt;&gt; What do you know? There was a God of truth and a God of righteousness. What do you know? There was one true God, the King of heaven. &gt;&gt; One who set the affairs of man that no one no one should trifle with. says, "You knew all this, but hast lifted up thyself against the Lord of heaven, and they have brought the vessels of his house before thee, and thou, and thy lords, thy wives, and thy concubines, and have drunk wine in them. Thou has praised the gods of silver, and of gold, and of brass, of iron, wood, and stone, which see not, nor hear nor know, and the God in whose hand thy breath is, and whose are all thy ways hast thou not glorified." &gt;&gt; And he says, "You knew better." How do you know better? His dad did. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His dad glorified him. Had he been raised in a heathen nation, had he not seen the example, had there not been a witness in Babylon that the king had received, then this judgment wouldn't be written this way. But he knew better. &gt;&gt; Then was the part of the hand sent from him and this writing was written because you rejected the gospel that was witnessed to you. &gt;&gt; How was it witnessed? Did Belshazzar have to go to a temple? Did he have to go to school? Did he have to be taught in it? No. He saw it lived, &gt;&gt; right? He saw the example of it. And they took all these vessels and they worshiped drunkenly worshiped silver, gold, brass, iron, wood, stone, and did not glorify God. And the example they saw was the gospel according to Nebuchadnezzar who could testify the goodness of God. Not everyone will listen. Not all will take heed. But I I I I'm not a king. I never have a kingdom like Nebuchadnezzar's. But I want to be the type that if I fall, if I make a mistake, if I go, if I begin to act out of character, Lord, let me come back &gt;&gt; to recognize what pride can do to the gospel, what it can do to my witness, what it can do to my testimony. And the only way to restore it is to not make excuses, but come back and say, "I've I repent." Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I've made a mistake. The gospel according to the bride is the voice of God to the world. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's for the lost, for the hurting. It's for the the unsaved, the unbelieving. It's not for ourselves, but it's for the glory of Christ. &gt;&gt; We ought to live it that way, &gt;&gt; unselfishly. And as much as you may know that you're to be a witness and and and know that that's part of the working out of the third pool in our lives is how we witness to others. But the best thing we could do is live the witness &gt;&gt; and live the life. &gt;&gt; Because if you're not living the life and you try to sit down with the family member and kind of explain to them where they're wrong in their religion, they may look at you and be like, &gt;&gt; "Child, seriously, &gt;&gt; I'm more faithful to my wife. &gt;&gt; I pay my taxes. &gt;&gt; I I I I do good to others." And you're going to tell me I'm a trin because I'm a trinitarian. I'm worshiping the devil. It's lost. &gt;&gt; The gospel's muted when we don't live it. &gt;&gt; Challenge you tonight. You'll be glad that I'm leaving, I guess, tomorrow. Challenge you tonight to live this truth. It's a beautiful truth. &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Sister Cheryl, if you could come to your instrument, sister Trisha, you just the ones that are playing, just come. Let's just bow our heads in a word of prayer and we'll just turn it over to your pastor. your gracious heavenly father tonight. Maybe we've taken a lot of time, but I trust that it's been engaging in a positive way for everyone. &gt;&gt; What I ask tonight as we consider these things that is certainly with the foundation of what brother Gideon preached because Lord, this is not this is just not repeating the gospels. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not just trying to read the red letter and pretend uh you know that or just to remark that Jesus is alive and he died for our sins, but this is a living word. This is a living truth. &gt;&gt; A truth that's been restored, a truth that's been revealed in this hour. &gt;&gt; We're talking about a God that is present, that has declared himself alive and well, still confirms through signs and wonders his word. So Lord, this witness that we have, this gospel that we preach is is not history. It's not fortuneelling, but it's Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever. And Lord, we are to convict the sinner, make whole the broken, to save the lost, heal the sick, and use words if necessary. For truly, Lord, our lives can live the gospel. &gt;&gt; And in living it first, give more weight if we have to use our words. May we have the heart of a witness to reach the ear and the heart of the one who hears so that we can be faithful works. that as we are rendered and set on display, the glory does not go to the church. It does not go to the pastor. It does not go to me, the person, the the viewer, the frame. It doesn't go to the painting or the work. It goes to you. &gt;&gt; And I pray Lord that in this church there will be souls saved &gt;&gt; because the lives that are lived &gt;&gt; by the members here. May it be Lord that the next time we have this precious opportunity to be together, we will witness souls will hear the testimony of those who've been baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ and it'll be because the light shined unto them. &gt;&gt; It convicted their heart and they're converted and now they glorify you. Lord, may there not be a Belshazzar who's now accountable because the gospel has been lived before them. And they knew better, but they did not glorify you. Lord, think about it. Bible says that when they knew God, they glorified him not as God. Leads me to believe that they know, but they choose to deny him. Lord, let us not ever get lifted up in pride. May we give you the glory. May we recognize your goodness to us. We give you the praise. We give you the honor. We repeat these words of the king. Your kingdom shall know no end. &gt;&gt; Your dominion is everlasting from generation to generation. Thou art the king of heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we want to give you the praise that's due your name. We lift you up. We exalt you. We glorify you. Lord, now glorify us, Lord. We want to walk honestly towards those that are without. We want to walk in wisdom to those that without. &gt;&gt; For we recognize that in doing so, we faithfully represent your heart and your character and we give you the glory, not ourselves, &gt;&gt; but yet it's a benefit for somebody else. And Father, you said that if we do that, we won't lack for anything. &gt;&gt; May we acknowledge today that perhaps it's our failure to be an accurate witness that has resulted in what we lack. We commit all things to you tonight, Lord. I pray that this is received as coming from a sincere heart, Lord, with no nothing intended, not meddling in anything, Lord, just trying to preach the gospel. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Bless this church. Bless its pastor and its family, those that labor and serve here. &gt;&gt; Lord, I see many familiar faces that are just be faithful here now coming for the word of God. May you increase L or increase them not so much in numbers Lord
