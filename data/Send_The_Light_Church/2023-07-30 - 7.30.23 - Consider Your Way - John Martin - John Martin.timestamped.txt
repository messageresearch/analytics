[19:14] we've been we've had many troubles over
[19:18] the years
[19:20] but we always came back
[19:26] amen I was thinking yesterday I thought
[19:31] that when I get into the scriptures and
[19:34] I read about humans
[19:36] I
[19:38] I dare to enter into little things in
[19:42] the spirit of God amen I feel I'm right
[19:46] here amen you know
[19:49] you know we drop into that channel
[19:51] that's right that you can do it yeah
[19:56] when you read screen scriptures get in
[19:59] there
[20:00] spirit of God is upon him it's his word
[20:04] get close to it make it real in your
[20:07] life amen like you're actually going

[20:55] I
[20:59] love you
[21:07] Flawless enter into the spirit of the
[21:11] word even as our brother said in Hague
[21:13] chapter one hey guy chapter one
[21:17] if you're turning there this morning
[21:19] because I know you're turning there you
[21:21] brought your Bible right amen
[21:25] um brother Jason Demars is traveling to
[21:27] Egypt today for a mission trip he covets
[21:31] our prayers and then afterwards he's
[21:32] going to Israel
[21:34] so he specifically contacted us for the
[21:37] church to be praying for his trip there
[21:40] let's let's pray that God prospers it
[21:44] amen amen
[21:48] and before we begin reading let's look
[21:50] too little
[21:51] Lord in a word of prayer Heavenly Father
[21:54] we thank you
[21:56] for your family
[21:59] we thank you for your spirit that makes
[22:02] us
[22:03] Brothers and Sisters in Christ and that
[22:06] brings us into the family of God
[22:09] and father we thank you
[22:11] for
[22:13] the work that you started in us that
[22:16] you're you're never going to give up
[22:18] you're never going to leave us you're
[22:19] never going to forsake us you promise to
[22:21] be with us to the end and we just
[22:23] we thank you for this example Lord that
[22:27] you have sent even in
[22:29] in brother and sister Beckman being
[22:31] together these many years Lord
[22:34] and followed as our brother had said
[22:37] when he reads the scriptures he wants to
[22:39] enter into the spirit of the scriptures
[22:42] and now Lord we're asking before we read
[22:44] these that your spirit would be upon
[22:47] each one of us
[22:48] Lord we know that we're all perhaps
[22:51] indifferent uh areas with you you're
[22:55] dealing with us about different things
[22:57] but you're able to take
[22:59] the word of God this morning
[23:01] and help us along our journey we just
[23:04] pray that you would anoint each in every
[23:07] ear and each and every heart in each and
[23:09] every spirit
[23:11] Lord we pray that you anoint our lips
[23:14] learn how hard to to speak only those
[23:17] things Lord that you have spoken today
[23:19] and we'll give you the praise the honor
[23:22] for Lord as you give Glory through each
[23:25] and every one of our Lives now in Jesus
[23:27] Christ and we pray amen amen amen
[23:31] chapter 1 verse 1 in the second year of
[23:35] Darius
[23:37] King in the sixth month and the first
[23:40] day of the month came the word of the
[23:42] Lord by hagiah the prophet anchaz Kia
[23:47] governor of Judah and Joshua the son of
[23:50] Josh deck the high priest saying thus
[23:53] saith the Lord host
[23:55] the Lord of all saying this people say
[23:59] the time is not come
[24:02] the time that the Lord's House
[24:05] should be built
[24:07] then came the word of the Lord by haggai
[24:10] the prophet saying is it time for you oh
[24:14] ye to dwell in your sealed houses and
[24:18] this house like waste
[24:20] now therefore thus saith the Lord of
[24:23] hosts
[24:24] consider your ways
[24:27] you have so much in bringing little you
[24:29] eat but yet not enough you drink but
[24:33] you're not filled with drink eat
[24:36] clothe you but there's none warm and he
[24:39] that Earth wages Earth wages are put
[24:42] into a bay with holes
[24:45] thus saith the Lord of hosts consider
[24:48] your ways
[24:50] go up to the uh to the mountain and
[24:54] bring wood and build the house
[24:56] and I will take pleasure on it and I
[24:58] will be glorified saith Lord know this
[25:01] what God wants he wants to be glorified
[25:04] ye look for much and loyal it came to
[25:07] too little and when he brought it home I
[25:12] did blow upon it why saith the Lord of
[25:15] hosts because of my house that is is
[25:19] waste and you run every man onto his own
[25:23] house
[25:24] therefore the heaven over you is stayed
[25:27] from you and the Earth has stayed from
[25:30] her fruit
[25:31] and I have called for a drop upon the
[25:34] land and upon the mountains and upon the
[25:36] corn and upon the new wine and upon the
[25:38] oil and upon that which the ground
[25:40] bringeth forth and upon men and upon
[25:42] cattle and upon of all
[25:44] that labor of the hands amen God bless
[25:49] you may be seated may the Lord bless
[25:52] this word to our hearts today
[25:56] want to title this message
[25:58] consider your ways and for a subject I
[26:03] could be wrong you know we read these
[26:04] scriptures we say boy I don't know if
[26:06] this is going to be a feel good service
[26:09] it's it's the word of God the word of
[26:11] God should make us feel good amen amen
[26:14] I believe it's a good reminder for us to
[26:17] to consider our ways
[26:19] ever been driving and got lost
[26:22] have you ever been driving miss your
[26:24] exit
[26:26] perhaps you didn't consider something
[26:28] amen what about uh I know when brother
[26:31] Marty we go out to a restaurant he needs
[26:34] to consider what's on the menu what he's
[26:37] going to order because they can't have
[26:38] any
[26:39] shellfish in it so you got to consider
[26:44] or your boss you got to consider your
[26:46] boss because if he has a a a a tire to
[26:50] see a policy that you can't be targeted
[26:53] too many times you need to pay attention
[26:55] to how many times you're late you need
[26:58] to consider that amen children children
[27:01] need to consider their parents right
[27:05] what their rules are and to consider
[27:08] their ways or else they're going to get
[27:10] in trouble
[27:11] earlier this week I uh after I
[27:15] you know everybody take showers and
[27:19] baths and you can you clean your hair or
[27:21] you you wash your hair your body and
[27:24] well I I sometimes use conditioner in my
[27:28] hair sometimes I just use the one that
[27:29] has a conditioner and the soap but I had
[27:31] the one that was separate and so I
[27:34] washed got other sour dried and put my
[27:36] clothes on looked in the mirror and I
[27:38] remembered that I did not wash the
[27:41] conditioner out of my hair yeah and it's
[27:44] already dressed I I did not consider my
[27:47] waist sometimes you just get going so
[27:50] fast and like you're thinking about what
[27:51] you're going to be doing you get your
[27:52] day already started have done in your
[27:55] mind before you're under the shower
[27:56] right right
[27:59] I believe we need to consider our ways
[28:02] amen so here is
[28:05] this group of people they were believers
[28:10] and
[28:12] their life was consumed
[28:16] with themselves
[28:18] they made sure that their houses were
[28:20] all taking care of their families were
[28:22] all taking care of the things that they
[28:25] had in mind were all taken care of
[28:28] but what was really ironic about this is
[28:31] that when
[28:32] the Lord had tried telling them to put
[28:35] God first
[28:37] right they kept the attitude
[28:41] that it wasn't time to build God's
[28:44] kingdom it wasn't time to build God's
[28:47] house
[28:49] even after the word of the Lord came to
[28:52] them and then God said consider your
[28:54] ways
[28:56] consider your ways
[28:59] and finally
[29:02] he said because you're not considering
[29:05] your ways because you're so consumed
[29:08] with yourself
[29:11] I am going to stop the blessings from
[29:13] coming right here amen amen and God has
[29:16] every right to do that
[29:20] the Bible says that he's able to make
[29:22] all grace abound to you
[29:24] and he's able to hold things back right
[29:29] so I think this is a good word for us to
[29:32] consider our ways amen
[29:35] amen it's not a you're bad you're wrong
[29:37] but it's like the prophet said we need
[29:40] to have the attitude I could be wrong I
[29:44] could be seeing this wrong I could be
[29:46] not putting God first amen
[29:50] we think of the
[29:54] the probably the most important thing to
[29:57] think about is the destination of our
[30:00] soul
[30:01] Jesus asked the question provoking
[30:03] mankind to consider his voice he says
[30:05] for what
[30:07] uh is a man's Advantage if you gain
[30:10] everything gain the whole world and lose
[30:13] himself right be a casterly amen he's
[30:16] getting man to consider everything amen
[30:20] yes in this age that we're living in
[30:24] the love
[30:25] of many is waxing cold right in fact
[30:30] their love is being turned more towards
[30:32] themselves to where the believer now the
[30:35] believer that goes to church is a lover
[30:37] of himself more than a lover of God a
[30:40] lover of pleasure more than a lover of
[30:42] God Amen
[30:47] and I just wondered
[30:50] do we need to consider our ways amen
[30:52] amen yes sir I think it's I said a good
[30:55] question first man was born with the
[30:57] mindset that follows the devil that's
[30:59] true Amen in this aspect the devil was
[31:03] created to do the will of God right and
[31:06] after thousands and thousands of years
[31:08] with the mindset of just doing God's
[31:10] will he decided to start doing his own
[31:13] will right right
[31:15] well it was at that moment he thought
[31:17] his will was just as good as gods and in
[31:19] fact even better because you could kind
[31:22] of do what you wanted to do I will
[31:24] taught my throne above the Throne of God
[31:25] I will be late the most high my will is
[31:28] just as good as God's will
[31:31] the Bible says that Satan drew a third
[31:33] of the Angels
[31:34] of heaven with him right he even taught
[31:38] Eve to do her own will and he calls the
[31:42] fall right amen
[31:44] amen so Satan fell authority of the
[31:46] Angels fell Eve fell and every man
[31:49] that's been born since that time has
[31:52] been born with a fallen nature of doing
[31:54] his own will right amen man is born with
[31:58] the mindset to do his own will and
[32:01] that's why Jesus said ye must be born
[32:04] again for what purpose not just to be
[32:06] born again but to be born to do the will
[32:09] of God Amen
[32:12] the Brandon said the message influence
[32:14] he says and a man is a failure to begin
[32:17] with right I don't care who he is he is
[32:20] born in sin shapen and iniquity come
[32:23] into the world speaking lies so he's a
[32:25] total failure that's right amen I don't
[32:28] care if he's a bishop a pope a presbyter
[32:31] or whatever he might be he's a failure
[32:34] to begin with and I don't and don't
[32:36] never look to one
[32:38] [Music]
[32:40] he says though he moves mountains with
[32:43] faith and though he gives all his Goods
[32:46] to feed the poor still look at the Lord
[32:49] Jesus Christ
[32:52] not at some man
[33:00] God uses man
[33:05] everybody's following somebody
[33:07] truly right truth and Paul said follow
[33:09] me as I follow Christ but that doesn't
[33:12] mean
[33:13] that he was telling everybody to look to
[33:15] him right
[33:18] just making a stipulation as I'm leading
[33:21] you to Christ follow it
[33:23] amen and if I decide to preach any other
[33:26] gospel then that for don't listen to me
[33:28] all right that's right so we got to
[33:29] understand
[33:33] the balance here so brother Brandon says
[33:35] continue on find now
[33:38] that he was showing here what a servant
[33:41] of God must be right
[33:44] how he must be humble
[33:46] he must be reverent
[33:49] and in action in other words he must be
[33:52] displaying a life
[33:55] man
[33:57] he says go into action many of us can be
[34:00] humble many of us can be relevant but
[34:03] it's hard to get them into action
[34:08] action manifestation right damn it so I
[34:12] want to consider a ways this is one of
[34:14] the hardest things to do
[34:16] why is that
[34:18] because we have an inherited nature that
[34:21] we're always right right the scripture
[34:25] says Proverbs 21 verse 2 says every way
[34:28] of a man is right in his own eyes
[34:32] let the Lord Ponder at the hearts amen
[34:35] so because of this inherited nature it's
[34:39] very hard for us to sit here and
[34:40] consider our ways it's true because
[34:42] there's something inside of us that's
[34:44] working and says no I'm right I know I'm
[34:46] right
[34:48] and everything I do everything I say
[34:51] everything that I look at
[34:53] feel that we're right but we need to
[34:56] consider our ways amen our very nature
[35:00] thinks it's right to begin with even
[35:02] when it's wrong
[35:03] you ever been in a fight with somebody
[35:05] in your life your husband
[35:09] and you know you're wrong but you won't
[35:11] give in come on do you know what I'm
[35:13] talking about it's a reality it's the
[35:16] nature
[35:18] it thinks it knows the will of God when
[35:20] it doesn't
[35:22] it thinks it's ready for the Rapture
[35:24] when it's not
[35:25] it thinks it's right to judge others
[35:27] when it's wrong
[35:29] it thinks it's right to predict the
[35:31] future
[35:32] when it's wrong
[35:35] because the scripture teaches us not to
[35:37] do that it thinks it's right being
[35:39] consumed with its own life what God
[35:41] wants us to build the kingdom of God now
[35:43] that's our opening scripture amen amen
[35:49] why would I need to consider my ways
[35:53] because our nature default is to think
[35:55] it's right all the time it's called
[35:57] Pride
[35:58] and it reminded me like in the Book of
[36:01] Judges it says in those days there was
[36:03] no king in Israel but every man did that
[36:06] which was right in his own eyes and
[36:09] often times I've seen Believers doing
[36:11] what they want to do and I just wonder
[36:12] if the king is missing
[36:14] um
[36:15] if the king is ready missing in their
[36:17] life just like it was in the Book of
[36:19] Judges there was no king in Israel and
[36:22] sometimes people don't really have the
[36:23] king of king and the Lord of lords in
[36:25] their life having the preeminence and
[36:27] they're just doing what they want to do
[36:29] and they're making reasons and excuses
[36:31] for why they do what they do and why
[36:33] they don't do what they don't do
[36:35] amen
[36:40] amen too many people are taking on the
[36:43] profession of Christianity But
[36:45] continuing to do their own will that's
[36:49] right amen right right that's that
[36:51] Christianity amen
[36:54] getting people to consider their ways is
[36:56] one of the hardest things to do
[36:58] especially for a believer
[37:00] the truth I think it's one of the
[37:02] hardest jobs of the Holy Ghost is to get
[37:04] people to see that they're wrong
[37:07] Jesus said in John 16 12 I have yet many
[37:10] things to say unto you but you cannot
[37:12] bear it now
[37:14] right why couldn't they bear it
[37:18] because
[37:22] I don't want to do anything different
[37:24] than what I want to do
[37:27] and if you put too much on me
[37:30] I'm about to handle it
[37:33] you know what I love about God
[37:37] he promised not to put anything on us
[37:39] that we couldn't bear
[37:42] but how many times were asked to do
[37:44] something from the pulpit they listen to
[37:46] a tape or read the Bible some brother
[37:48] sister tells us something and we just
[37:52] anymore
[37:54] true that's too much
[37:57] I'm not ready yet
[37:59] who are you to say if you're ready or
[38:01] not ready right when God the Holy Spirit
[38:06] would not put anything on me that you
[38:08] couldn't bear you've got to have faith
[38:10] in the word of God amen amen
[38:13] verse 13 how be it when he the spirit of
[38:15] Truth has come he will guide you into
[38:17] all truth in other words he's going to
[38:20] show you where you're wrong
[38:22] that's how he's going to guide you know
[38:24] he's not going to show you
[38:27] it that is not saying you're gonna
[38:29] you're you're all truth and he's going
[38:31] to give you more truth
[38:33] that's not the job of the Holy Ghost
[38:36] the job of the Holy Ghost is going to
[38:37] show you where you're wrong yes amen
[38:39] amen he's going to reprove he's going to
[38:41] rebuke he's going to he's going to show
[38:45] you in your nature because it's a
[38:46] personal thing of what needs to be dealt
[38:48] with
[38:54] so God is moving in our lives
[38:59] to lead us into all Truth for he shall
[39:02] not speak of himself it's not about
[39:05] the cell
[39:06] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[39:09] he speak and he shall show you things to
[39:10] come I don't know how many times God has
[39:13] has warned me and showed me things to
[39:15] come and I didn't take heed to it I paid
[39:17] for it
[39:18] amen God is faithful to set warning
[39:22] before judgments right he's faithful to
[39:25] show you things to come it isn't all
[39:27] about you know prophecy and this is
[39:29] going to happen
[39:29] show you this I'm not saying that
[39:31] doesn't exist but I mean I'll tell you
[39:33] there's a lot more time God warns us
[39:35] about something and we don't do it then
[39:36] he ever shows us about some great thing
[39:38] that's going to happen before it happens
[39:39] amen amen that's the truth amen I say
[39:42] one of the hardest jobs of the Holy
[39:44] Ghost is they get people
[39:46] to see that they're wrong you ever
[39:49] identified somebody as a hard head
[39:51] okay right thick skull can't get
[39:54] something into them they just won't
[39:55] listen
[39:56] I think Humanity when God is trying to
[39:59] deal with us there's there's a Hardness
[40:01] of Heart that keeps us from just giving
[40:03] God his way amen
[40:05] amen I I
[40:08] you know God is not obligated
[40:11] to give us his word
[40:14] exactly the way you want it that's for
[40:17] sure amen we do not tell God how to do
[40:21] things right
[40:22] he gave you a five-fold Ministry
[40:25] 89
[40:27] . Proverbs 14 12 says there is a way
[40:31] which seemeth right unto a man
[40:34] but the end thereof are the ways of
[40:37] death so here it is just Naturally
[40:40] Speaking there we have this mindset of
[40:43] thinking this is the right way
[40:48] did you ever have the truth about
[40:50] something
[40:51] that you had a bad attitude about it
[40:53] right
[40:54] come on
[40:56] this is one of the ways which seems
[40:58] right unto a man right but at the end is
[41:00] death amen and then would you just focus
[41:03] so much that you're right that you don't
[41:05] even care and pay attention in your
[41:07] spirit right right
[41:09] so it's a way that seems right unto the
[41:12] man but it's not yeah wrong Spirits are
[41:15] always the way of death amen amen
[41:21] here the devil uses the word
[41:24] he's the word and Jesus he uses the word
[41:26] on us
[41:27] how many times does the devil tell you
[41:29] oh you know you're a Believer you don't
[41:32] have to follow those instructions it's
[41:34] true you're going to heaven you don't
[41:35] have to worry about that
[41:38] amen gives you parts
[41:42] otherwise is I'd rather have the right
[41:43] spirit and be wrong in my doctrine that
[41:47] means how I'm looking at a certain
[41:49] situation
[41:50] then have the right doctor and be wrong
[41:52] in my spirit so the emphasis is what
[41:56] spirit's on you exactly right amen amen
[41:59] and too often we're staring at well
[42:01] trying to you know figure out what's
[42:03] right and wrong
[42:07] what's right is have God's spirit what's
[42:10] wrong is not to have God's spirit
[42:13] we need to say focus on that yes brother
[42:17] Brian says it's not the action but the
[42:19] reaction that counts amen God's gonna
[42:21] allow things to happen in our life but
[42:23] how are we going to react to them yes
[42:25] amen that reaction is really important
[42:28] to God because he's the one that allowed
[42:30] the action to take place so he's going
[42:34] to step back and see how you're going to
[42:35] react right and another brand and taught
[42:37] us
[42:38] to have a spirit now and an attitude of
[42:41] I could be wrong yes amen
[42:46] there's two ways I want to talk about
[42:47] it's in Matthew chapter
[42:50] seven
[42:52] thirteen and fourteen
[42:55] there are only two ways in life there's
[42:57] God's way and then there's the wrong way
[43:01] that's the two ways I wonder uh and did
[43:06] you get a chance to get that if we could
[43:08] put this on a board so this is what a I
[43:12] I did
[43:13] um oh and I'm so sorry I meant the
[43:15] picture honey yeah can you see that okay
[43:17] okay so this is what I don't got nothing
[43:20] to do and I'm laying on my bed at night
[43:28] I mean just read these scriptures now
[43:30] Matthew 7 and you
[43:33] we'll just leave that up there if we
[43:35] could enter again at the Straight Gate
[43:37] for wide as the gate and brought us away
[43:38] which leads to light which leads to
[43:40] destruction and many there be which ones
[43:42] they're at because straight is the gate
[43:44] Narrows the way which leadeth on to life
[43:46] but few be there that find it right
[43:52] with God's way the spirit will always be
[43:54] right and remember that went the wrong
[43:57] way
[43:58] something will always be wrong with the
[44:02] spirit amen so it's just easy to know so
[44:06] here we are
[44:09] I drew this heart because this is where
[44:12] it all stems from
[44:14] so straight As the gate Narrows away
[44:16] that leadeth unto life and to be that
[44:18] find it so I just got this white little
[44:21] strip that goes right up here
[44:26] but there's a way that seemed to be
[44:28] right unto man
[44:30] and you see these are going a little bit
[44:33] off on an angle
[44:36] a way that seemed to be right
[44:40] but the end of it is death and you'll
[44:42] see eventually something with the wrong
[44:44] Spirit going the wrong way is eventually
[44:48] going to go down all right yes amen
[44:51] that's why the heart is deceptive amen
[44:54] amen
[44:56] I got this big conclusion
[44:59] I just thought I mean that's what I
[45:01] thought I thought I was doing the right
[45:02] thing and it gets to be confusing
[45:05] right here you think you're right you're
[45:07] right you're right but you know you're
[45:09] not staying in the middle of the road
[45:10] you're not staying down the straight and
[45:12] narrow
[45:13] in other words I'm a Believer I can do
[45:16] this I don't have to worry about I'm
[45:19] giving what I can I'm doing what I can
[45:21] I'm I
[45:24] God's going to accept me the way I am
[45:27] something just not right with the spirit
[45:31] and we end up still serving God our own
[45:34] way
[45:36] but refusing to consider our ways
[45:41] refusing to consider
[45:44] the direction it might just go 90 right
[45:48] or am I staying right down the middle
[45:51] because eventually you know you get to a
[45:54] place where you don't even care anymore
[45:57] when a person don't care anymore they're
[45:59] going down
[46:01] because that's exactly what Satan had he
[46:04] had an I don't care spirit anymore
[46:09] God always wants man to consider his
[46:12] ways amen
[46:16] why do few people
[46:18] find
[46:20] the way the life
[46:24] you're supposed to like respond to that
[46:28] was a question
[46:30] because it's harder
[46:33] our nature is to find the easier Road
[46:37] true amen
[46:39] the way of that God does things is just
[46:42] harder
[46:43] and that's why few people find it they
[46:45] don't want to do that they don't want to
[46:47] have to turn the cheek again when
[46:51] somebody slapped them
[46:52] they don't have to go the Second Mile
[46:54] for somebody
[46:57] they don't want to be long-suffering and
[46:59] forbearing with one another
[47:01] they don't want to have to be
[47:02] interdependent
[47:05] work with somebody they don't want to
[47:07] Endeavor to keep Unity
[47:09] they don't want to keep forgiving others
[47:11] and I mean 490 times forget it I believe
[47:14] that there's a much easier gospel
[47:17] they don't want to have to keep they
[47:19] don't want to they rather just love
[47:21] their favorite love their enemy huh
[47:25] lay aside everything to you get it no
[47:28] this is why people are missing it
[47:31] because it's a harder way
[47:36] having to seek the kingdom of God first
[47:39] no I just give God what I have to
[47:42] having to esteem others better than
[47:44] ourselves having to deny ourselves and
[47:46] our will and our own reputation just
[47:48] denied like I'm nothing
[47:52] having to look on the things of others
[47:55] and forget about myself
[47:58] having to walk in the spirit and Worship
[48:01] in the spirit and pray in the spirit
[48:04] to pray without ceasing
[48:07] this is why people miss the straight
[48:10] narrow path
[48:12] this is why they're going to miss it
[48:15] having to go to church
[48:17] read God's word all the time meditate
[48:20] upon him all the Moors you see the day
[48:22] approaching having to humble myself and
[48:26] press towards the mark
[48:29] because God's way of living is much
[48:31] harder
[48:33] than
[48:34] living the way man wants to live is why
[48:38] only few people are going to find it
[48:40] that's the truth
[48:42] now Satan surely will also present to us
[48:46] that because we're in the message of the
[48:48] hour and we believe the message the
[48:50] other I've got the sticker I've got the
[48:52] badge I've got the
[48:58] it doesn't mean we're in the straight
[49:00] and narrow
[49:06] Jesus wants man to consider his ways
[49:09] amen that he could be wrong
[49:12] just because we're feeling like we're
[49:15] right it doesn't mean that we're right
[49:19] so who cares about how we feel amen I'm
[49:22] sure these these Believers in hegi
[49:25] thought they were they were right they
[49:27] wouldn't be doing it if they thought
[49:29] they were wrong
[49:31] so these two ways are you with me this
[49:34] morning you that are not saying amen can
[49:36] I get you just to enter in
[49:38] [Laughter]
[49:40] because I believe that God wants to help
[49:43] us consider something in our life
[49:46] I don't know what it is
[49:49] but God does
[49:52] so we got two ways one is the broad way
[49:54] of thinking
[49:57] and the devil just gets you all turned
[50:00] around in your way of thinking
[50:02] and the other way is straight narrow
[50:04] that's God's way and it never turns
[50:07] around from the truth
[50:09] notice when you get on this path it
[50:12] never turns around it doesn't deviate
[50:15] amen James chapter 1 verse 14. let's
[50:18] throw that up there James chapter 1
[50:20] verse 14 with this thought in mind but
[50:22] every man is tempted when he's drawn
[50:25] away of his own desires
[50:29] see it's your desires that entice you
[50:34] then when lust have conceived it
[50:36] bringeth forth sin and sin when it's
[50:38] finished bringing forward death do not
[50:40] air my beloved Brethren every good and
[50:43] perfect gift is from above and cometh
[50:46] down from the Father of Lights with whom
[50:48] is no variableness
[50:52] no rheostat no no variableness in this
[50:55] neither is there a shadow of turning
[50:58] right
[51:00] God is not going to lead you a little
[51:03] off the path I'm sorry he won't do that
[51:05] never there's no chance of it
[51:10] of his own will be at he us with the
[51:13] word of truth that we should be a kind
[51:16] of firstfruits of his creatures
[51:20] that's I want to go back to Matthew
[51:21] chapter 7 there
[51:23] and take a look at verse 15. we did uh
[51:26] 13 and 14. 15 says beware of false
[51:31] prophets verse 15 beware of false
[51:35] prophets which come to you in sheep's
[51:38] clothing but inwardly they are raving
[51:41] wolves
[51:43] now here's the thing if all I have to do
[51:46] is worry that somebody comes up to me
[51:48] and says I'm a prophet I'm a prophet of
[51:51] God
[51:53] I gotta worry about that person right
[51:56] be careful
[51:58] I don't think that's what he's referring
[52:00] to do you
[52:02] false prophets are false Spirits which
[52:05] appear as brothers and sisters
[52:12] expressing to you that you don't need to
[52:15] go the straight narrow way
[52:17] that you really don't have to follow
[52:19] that to a T
[52:22] that isn't that important if it's you
[52:25] know everybody you know God understands
[52:30] see just trying to get you off
[52:32] of a perfectly straight Walk With Jesus
[52:37] Christ
[52:42] see Satan can use anybody
[52:45] not that I want Satan to use me
[52:49] but you know what
[52:51] just get a wrong Spirit on you Satan
[52:52] will be using you
[52:54] true none of us are exempt
[53:04] we need to be careful
[53:07] for wide is the gate and Broad is the
[53:10] way that leads to destruction and many
[53:12] there be which going at see and if that
[53:15] heart there it showed you know you can
[53:17] go any any way you want to it doesn't
[53:20] matter either side
[53:22] it's Broad
[53:25] and you think you're going the right way
[53:28] you think it's okay you think it's
[53:30] straight now because there is some light
[53:32] you still feel this desire to serve God
[53:35] but there's something missing
[53:40] Proverbs 18 verse 12 says Before
[53:43] Destruction the heart of man is haughty
[53:49] right it leads to destruction right it
[53:52] leases Broadway leads to destruction
[53:54] Before Destruction the heart of man is
[53:57] haughty and before honor is humility
[54:03] we all want to be honored
[54:05] but we don't all want to be humble
[54:11] I I this is a I want to tell you this
[54:14] just in case you're questioning whether
[54:16] this word is a good word I'm going to
[54:17] tell you this is a good word this
[54:19] morning
[54:19] [Music]
[54:19] [Laughter]
[54:21] there was a a Catholic girl that went to
[54:24] Brother Brandon's Church once in a while
[54:27] she was a she had a cow
[54:30] she was a beautiful young girl 22 years
[54:32] old
[54:33] and one night she was in the back
[54:36] and she laughed at brother Branham
[54:40] and she said these words I wouldn't let
[54:42] my cow have that kind of religion he's
[54:44] got
[54:47] in less than an hour brother Branham was
[54:50] called
[54:51] to go to the hospital to pray for her
[54:54] the last words that she said before she
[54:57] died was call Brother Branham call that
[55:00] Preacher Brother random
[55:04] see there was a way that seemeth right
[55:06] unto man
[55:08] but at least a destruction
[55:10] Before Destruction is that Holy Spirit
[55:13] like oh I just got you know I don't have
[55:16] to listen to that he's so wrong
[55:19] he don't know what he's talking about
[55:21] that's all it takes
[55:23] that's all it takes
[55:28] I wouldn't give that religion to my cow
[55:30] I mean come on
[55:33] she never considered that she could be
[55:35] wrong
[55:38] she didn't consider a ways
[55:41] and there's a lot of ways in her life
[55:43] right we had a lot of things going on
[55:44] there's a lot of Dreams a lot of goals a
[55:46] lot of directions we're going lots of
[55:48] things we need to consider them
[55:52] and I'm going to say the thing I want to
[55:54] get to right now in this part of the
[55:56] service is is we need to break the cycle
[56:00] the way that we naturally think
[56:04] break the cycle with every way of a man
[56:07] is right in his own eyes we need to
[56:09] break that cycle
[56:11] if we don't break it
[56:13] we'll never sincerely consider we could
[56:16] be wrong
[56:18] I'll tell you one great thing that
[56:21] breaks the cycle is sincere humility
[56:26] it'll just break it right there on the
[56:28] spot an attitude of I could be wrong
[56:31] will break the cycle amen
[56:33] Proverbs 1 7 says the fear of the Lord
[56:37] is the beginning of knowledge
[56:39] but fools despise wisdom and instruction
[56:49] despise it
[56:51] If my people which are called by my name
[56:55] shall humble themselves see break that
[56:57] cycle
[56:59] we must put the clothes of humility back
[57:02] on because God resisted the proud gives
[57:06] grace to the humble now these people in
[57:08] haggai they were proud
[57:13] they didn't think it was time to give
[57:15] God anything
[57:18] we don't need to give the house of God
[57:20] anything more we don't need to build a
[57:22] church we don't need to go hunt for
[57:23] Souls we don't need to build God's
[57:25] Kingdom
[57:32] I'll tell you if God was coming back
[57:34] tomorrow are you happy with the
[57:35] decisions that you're making for today
[57:40] we need to Humble ourselves under the
[57:42] mighty hand of God that he may exalt Us
[57:45] in due time we need to break that cycle
[57:49] brother Brian said and God hiding
[57:51] himself in Simplicity he said if you
[57:53] you've got to let the mind of cry the
[57:55] mind that was in Christ be in you
[58:00] God dealing with man was has always been
[58:04] in humility
[58:06] he never does deal with men in uh great
[58:11] big theological terms
[58:14] tell me one time he ever did he never
[58:17] does He makes himself simple and man
[58:20] wants it to be complicated
[58:23] He makes himself great by making himself
[58:27] humble
[58:29] the more humble you could be the more I
[58:32] look up to you
[58:34] the more respect I have for you
[58:37] the more I honor you because that
[58:39] scripture
[58:40] before honor is humility
[58:44] true humility will break the cycle
[58:48] it will open the door for you to
[58:52] consider your ways that maybe you're not
[58:55] looking at things completely right
[58:57] Proverbs 22 verse 4 says by humility and
[59:02] the fear of the Lord
[59:04] are riches
[59:06] and honor
[59:08] and life
[59:11] who wouldn't see now here's the thing
[59:14] what the devil is presenting in a broad
[59:17] way is that you know you can get Rich's
[59:20] honor in life without humility and
[59:22] without the fear of God
[59:27] humility will help us to see how great a
[59:31] distance there is between God's way and
[59:33] our way
[59:35] Isaiah 58 55 verse 8 you don't have to
[59:38] turn there you know the scriptures for
[59:40] my thoughts are not your thoughts either
[59:41] my ways your ways saith the Lord for as
[59:43] the heavens are higher than the earth
[59:45] soar my ways higher than your ways
[59:48] there's a big distance
[59:50] and my thoughts than your thoughts
[59:53] brother Brown said in the Third Exodus
[59:55] he says the devil is real smart
[59:58] he's a shrewd bird
[1:00:00] he knows how to hit the thing before it
[1:00:03] even gets started he knows it see
[1:00:06] and the only thing that you can ever do
[1:00:10] to beat him is to rely on Christ amen
[1:00:15] [Music]
[1:00:16] and he didn't stop the sentence and
[1:00:19] humble yourself
[1:00:21] and let him lead you
[1:00:24] see you'll never do it any other way
[1:00:27] your intellectual Powers will never do
[1:00:29] it you've got to believe it and just
[1:00:31] rely on him because he is the shepherd
[1:00:35] all right Philippians chapter 2 verse
[1:00:37] one familiar scriptures here but I just
[1:00:39] wanted to show how sincere humility
[1:00:41] opens the door to break that cycle to
[1:00:45] get the mind of Christ and if you truly
[1:00:48] are sitting here today humble then you
[1:00:51] can relate to these scriptures this is
[1:00:54] how you feel inside of your heart right
[1:00:56] now if there be therefore any
[1:00:58] consolation in Christ if any comfort of
[1:01:02] Love of any Fellowship of the spirit if
[1:01:04] any bowels and and mercies fulfill ye my
[1:01:08] joy that you be like-minded
[1:01:12] now this is what we all need to have in
[1:01:14] this church right now having the Same
[1:01:16] Love
[1:01:17] being of one Accord
[1:01:20] of one mind
[1:01:23] let nothing be done through your Strife
[1:01:26] or your vain Glory
[1:01:29] but in lowliness of mine I'm nothing I'm
[1:01:34] nothing I believe what the prophet said
[1:01:36] a man at his very best is all vanity as
[1:01:40] the scripture says
[1:01:41] but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem
[1:01:45] the other person better than themselves
[1:01:48] you know what I'm I'm I'm still waiting
[1:01:51] to hear more of that kind of
[1:01:53] conversation I'm still waiting to see
[1:01:55] more of the mind of Christ being
[1:01:57] expressed amen
[1:01:59] some of us have a hard time handing out
[1:02:02] compliments
[1:02:04] some of us have a hard enough time to
[1:02:06] say you know
[1:02:08] it's a wonderful thing that you're
[1:02:10] working for the Lord come on
[1:02:14] I feel like I need to stay here and keep
[1:02:16] preaching this part because I only heard
[1:02:17] a few amens on that
[1:02:20] it's the mind of Christ amen
[1:02:22] look not every man on his own things my
[1:02:26] own house my own job my my my my my
[1:02:30] take some time but every man also on the
[1:02:34] things of others
[1:02:37] amen you know I'll tell you if you
[1:02:39] really want God to bless you start
[1:02:41] living for others
[1:02:42] well brother John I'm just not at a
[1:02:44] place where I can do that I am telling
[1:02:46] you if you've got breath in your lungs
[1:02:48] you got a beat in your heart it is time
[1:02:50] to do it now is the time to do it
[1:02:54] don't wait till you get your problems
[1:02:57] worked out because I guarantee you a
[1:02:59] year from now you're still going to have
[1:03:00] problems
[1:03:03] today is the day
[1:03:06] let this mind be in you which was also
[1:03:09] in Christ Jesus who being in the form of
[1:03:11] God thought of that robbery to be equal
[1:03:12] with God but made himself of no
[1:03:15] reputation
[1:03:17] find a man who don't talk about himself
[1:03:21] and you find that man who's following
[1:03:23] Christ
[1:03:25] made himself of no reputation and took
[1:03:27] upon him the form of a servant
[1:03:31] I mean when you look and you ever look
[1:03:32] at somebody say Well they're just
[1:03:34] servant servant servant serving
[1:03:36] that's what Jesus did for us
[1:03:39] and was made in the likeness of men and
[1:03:41] being found in the fashionism man what
[1:03:43] did he do hey I did this no he humbled
[1:03:46] himself amen
[1:03:47] and he became obedient
[1:03:50] unto death
[1:03:52] even the death of the cross
[1:03:55] wherefore God also have highly exalted
[1:03:58] him and given him a name which is above
[1:04:01] every name
[1:04:03] I love the scriptures I take such
[1:04:06] comfort in the scriptures
[1:04:09] brother Brian said in the message Jesus
[1:04:11] Christ is saying yesterday to you
[1:04:12] forever he said he never made himself of
[1:04:15] any reputation right
[1:04:17] right did you ever think of that
[1:04:20] he made himself of no reputation
[1:04:23] the man that made an artificial tooth
[1:04:26] made a reputation for himself
[1:04:29] but the one that made the real tooth
[1:04:33] made
[1:04:34] um made of himself no reputation
[1:04:37] the man that made an artificial arm made
[1:04:40] a reputation for himself but the man who
[1:04:43] made the real arm made himself no
[1:04:45] reputation
[1:04:47] the Way Up Is Down
[1:04:50] always remember that be humble be sweet
[1:04:53] be kind be creative
[1:04:58] let Christ be in you
[1:05:01] oh I just love the word of God this
[1:05:03] morning in the message influence brother
[1:05:05] Brandon says we must be sincere
[1:05:08] because we've got the greatest thing in
[1:05:11] the world the greatest Treasure of
[1:05:13] Heaven is Christ Among Us think about
[1:05:18] that
[1:05:19] amen that's the greatest thing we can
[1:05:21] have
[1:05:22] so what do we do with that what do we do
[1:05:25] with this
[1:05:27] president he wants us to consider our
[1:05:31] ways
[1:05:32] he says why do you want a substitute of
[1:05:36] some little influence to try to make
[1:05:38] ourselves something big among somebody
[1:05:41] here
[1:05:42] why not be a humble servant of Christ
[1:05:45] if we've got the greatest thing that we
[1:05:47] could have which is Christ in our myth
[1:05:49] why would we want to spend any time
[1:05:50] trying to make ourselves big
[1:05:55] see it's better to have the right spirit
[1:05:58] forget what you know
[1:06:00] be humble be a servant Jesus himself
[1:06:02] said if you want to really be great be a
[1:06:04] servant of all
[1:06:09] right why did Brother Branham ask so
[1:06:10] many questions
[1:06:12] why did Jesus ask so many questions why
[1:06:14] did Paul ask so many questions James
[1:06:16] asked questions
[1:06:17] questions help us to consider our ways
[1:06:22] the spirit of God wants us to consider
[1:06:24] our ways
[1:06:25] amen even the Bible says try the spirit
[1:06:29] Proverbs 16 verse 7 when a man's ways I
[1:06:33] love this scripture when a man's ways
[1:06:36] pleased the Lord
[1:06:37] he make
[1:06:38] he maketh even his enemies to be at
[1:06:42] peace with him
[1:06:43] [Music]
[1:06:44] wow
[1:06:50] in other words there's a way to handle
[1:06:52] things
[1:06:55] when man dedicates himself to going
[1:06:57] God's way and not the way that seemeth
[1:07:00] to be right amen then God will be
[1:07:03] pleased
[1:07:05] so please
[1:07:06] that he'll make your enemies
[1:07:09] to not bother you
[1:07:12] there'll still be your enemies
[1:07:15] but they'll be
[1:07:16] at Bay
[1:07:18] don't you love the word
[1:07:19] are you getting anything out of this
[1:07:22] and to you those of you that are not you
[1:07:25] still got a little bit more time
[1:07:27] amen
[1:07:28] let's consider our ways we all want to
[1:07:32] hear
[1:07:32] well done thou good and faithful servant
[1:07:36] Romans 12 verse 1 says I beseech you
[1:07:38] therefore Brethren by the mercies of God
[1:07:41] that you present we're still on
[1:07:44] humility breaking the cycle are you with
[1:07:46] me I beseech you therefore by the
[1:07:48] mercies of God that ye present your body
[1:07:51] a Living Sacrifice that's that's quite
[1:07:55] the servant wholly acceptable unto God
[1:07:57] which is your reasonable service and be
[1:08:00] not conformed to this world
[1:08:03] but be transformed in other words
[1:08:06] consider your ways by the renewing of
[1:08:09] your mind
[1:08:10] that ye may prove what is that good and
[1:08:12] acceptable and perfect will of God
[1:08:16] now I know there's some here
[1:08:18] that may look at this scripture
[1:08:21] is that God's got three different types
[1:08:23] of Wills
[1:08:27] personally for me I've never heard that
[1:08:29] in the message
[1:08:36] I know we heard the prophet talk about a
[1:08:38] permitted will of God
[1:08:40] God permitted Balaam to leave and go
[1:08:44] after his own heart's desire but God
[1:08:47] never accepted it so it wasn't the
[1:08:49] accepted will of God
[1:08:51] God permitted Ishmael to be born but he
[1:08:55] did not accept him into the Covenant
[1:08:58] everything that God created it wasn't he
[1:09:01] never said it's perfect
[1:09:04] everything that God created said it was
[1:09:06] good
[1:09:07] after everything he created in Genesis
[1:09:09] he said it was good
[1:09:12] I do remember that he he said when he
[1:09:14] created Lucifer he created him perfect
[1:09:18] but I'll just say it like this the only
[1:09:20] acceptable will of God
[1:09:23] is his
[1:09:25] is his will
[1:09:29] it's it's perfect
[1:09:31] it's acceptable and it's good
[1:09:35] and
[1:09:38] our job is to prove what is the perfect
[1:09:40] will of God for a life
[1:09:42] it starts with you in your home
[1:09:45] it starts you in your mind your your
[1:09:48] body and how you think what a thought
[1:09:51] you allow to think in your mind
[1:09:53] are you going to consider God's way are
[1:09:55] you just going to do what you want to do
[1:09:57] what you plan to do because I'm telling
[1:09:59] you one of these days you're going to
[1:10:01] get out of that shower and you're going
[1:10:02] to have a conditioner in your hair
[1:10:04] my word
[1:10:06] things are not going to go great
[1:10:09] brother Branham said in the message
[1:10:10] power transformation he said that's what
[1:10:12] we all want to do is to be conformed be
[1:10:16] not conformed to this world but be
[1:10:17] transformed by the renewing of our mind
[1:10:19] to do the perfect and acceptable will of
[1:10:24] God this is what he said now that's what
[1:10:27] we have been now that we have been saved
[1:10:30] as we are and that we have been filled
[1:10:32] with the Holy Ghost as we have
[1:10:34] now we want the mind that was in Christ
[1:10:38] to be in us that we might be transformed
[1:10:41] from the Natural Things of life and be
[1:10:44] brought in to do the perfect will of God
[1:10:48] by transformation by God's spirit and by
[1:10:52] his word
[1:10:55] that's what we want
[1:10:56] we we don't want to we don't want to
[1:10:58] have some sort of negative feelings
[1:11:00] about the word that's being preached
[1:11:02] today
[1:11:03] right
[1:11:04] we want this word to transform us and
[1:11:08] say God this is you speaking to me
[1:11:10] you're speaking to me Lord and I want to
[1:11:13] be transformed I want to start doing I
[1:11:16] don't want to be assuming that I'm going
[1:11:17] through the course of the day in your
[1:11:19] will
[1:11:19] I mean I can wake up I can pray in the
[1:11:23] morning and I can say I'm going to go to
[1:11:24] trust or two and I'm going to work I
[1:11:26] trust it too that's my job I'm going to
[1:11:28] be in the will of God I'm sorry that
[1:11:30] doesn't mean you're in the will of job
[1:11:31] because you you well God because you
[1:11:33] wake up and you go to work
[1:11:37] there's more to life than that
[1:11:42] we've been born again to carry out the
[1:11:44] will of God that's our purpose
[1:11:46] brother Brandon send the message the
[1:11:48] spoken word The Original Seed he says
[1:11:50] you can't be a seed and disagree with
[1:11:52] the word
[1:11:54] you talk about a powerful statement
[1:11:58] you can't be a seed and disagree with
[1:12:01] the word because the word is the seed
[1:12:03] and if you are the word how can you
[1:12:06] disagree with it you would be
[1:12:07] disagreeing with yourself
[1:12:10] you'd be defeating your own purpose so
[1:12:13] the word is challenging us to consider
[1:12:16] our ways
[1:12:18] can we take a look at the benefits of
[1:12:20] choosing God's way for just a second all
[1:12:22] right this is for brother Mark
[1:12:25] because he said amen
[1:12:28] Amen brother thank you we just I'm
[1:12:31] telling you we got to get into the word
[1:12:34] Mark 10 28 the devil wants us to like be
[1:12:37] too relaxed
[1:12:40] Mark 10 28 says then Peter began to say
[1:12:43] unto him lol we have left all
[1:12:46] and follow thee
[1:12:49] well we know
[1:12:51] that Peter didn't quite realize
[1:12:55] that
[1:12:57] there was still part of him
[1:12:59] that needed to be filled with the Holy
[1:13:01] Ghost
[1:13:03] and Jesus answered and said verily I say
[1:13:06] unto you
[1:13:07] there is no man that have left house
[1:13:10] and Brethren or sisters or father or
[1:13:13] mother or wife or children or lands for
[1:13:16] my sake and the Gospels
[1:13:19] but he shall receive a hundred fold now
[1:13:23] in this time
[1:13:25] in this time
[1:13:27] houses brother and sisters mothers and
[1:13:30] children lands with persecutions
[1:13:33] and in the world to come eternal life
[1:13:38] but many that shall and many that are
[1:13:41] first shall be last and the last shall
[1:13:44] be first you know what that means
[1:13:48] you know
[1:13:50] you can give up your life
[1:13:52] just
[1:13:54] sell out
[1:13:56] you don't get to do your will you don't
[1:13:59] get to get bring pleasure to yourself
[1:14:02] you can just lay your life down for the
[1:14:04] kingdom
[1:14:08] but you're going to receive great
[1:14:09] blessings
[1:14:11] on the other side
[1:14:14] or you can be first and take your life
[1:14:16] now
[1:14:18] do your will
[1:14:20] spend time building your dreams
[1:14:24] have little time for the kingdom of God
[1:14:27] the first shall be last
[1:14:29] and the last shall be first
[1:14:32] isn't that beautiful scripture amen love
[1:14:34] that scripture brother Brandon chose to
[1:14:36] go God's way
[1:14:40] he could have been very wealthy
[1:14:43] he could add a great name for himself a
[1:14:45] great reputation
[1:14:47] he was he was great among the religious
[1:14:49] world
[1:14:50] they wanted to do more for him but did
[1:14:52] you know brother Brandon did not choose
[1:14:55] the Easy Pass amen
[1:15:00] God allowed brother Branham to see
[1:15:02] beyond the curtain of time to catch a
[1:15:05] glimpse of Eternity and it was the first
[1:15:07] week in May of 1960. and he had this
[1:15:10] experience
[1:15:11] of perfect love many times before but in
[1:15:16] this experience it happened like he
[1:15:18] never experienced it before
[1:15:20] he said all that he heard a voice that
[1:15:23] said all that you ever loved and all
[1:15:25] that ever loved you is going to be there
[1:15:28] and notice it was through Freemore
[1:15:30] agency
[1:15:31] this is what's really important
[1:15:34] Freemore agency
[1:15:38] this is what makes a paradox between
[1:15:40] predestination and free more agency
[1:15:44] all that you ever free morally loved and
[1:15:48] all that ever free loved you will be
[1:15:50] there
[1:15:51] not predestinated of course it's
[1:15:53] predestinated
[1:15:55] but notice it has to go through free
[1:15:56] more agency
[1:15:59] he had experienced a culmination of
[1:16:01] everything he preached because that
[1:16:03] voice said to him this is what you
[1:16:06] preached it was the Holy Ghost
[1:16:09] and he heard a voice that said and you
[1:16:11] shall you shall be judged for everything
[1:16:13] that you preached to the people
[1:16:16] and he got kind of scared you know
[1:16:18] sitting in church and you know just like
[1:16:19] oh that's a hard one he says well is
[1:16:23] Mark going to have to be preached I mean
[1:16:24] is Mark going to have to be judged
[1:16:27] because brother Brandon says is Paul
[1:16:29] gonna have to be judged with his people
[1:16:32] right he said yeah he'll be judged
[1:16:35] okay we're going to be judged well let
[1:16:37] me just ask you I just want to make this
[1:16:39] clear
[1:16:40] is Paul going to make it
[1:16:43] oh he'll make it
[1:16:45] he said good because I preached
[1:16:47] everything Paul preached
[1:16:48] [Music]
[1:16:53] there's where our comfort is at so
[1:16:55] you're hearing something in the message
[1:16:57] and it seems to hurt it seems to be too
[1:16:59] hard it seems to be too straight too
[1:17:01] narrow it is God's way
[1:17:03] you stay with it
[1:17:10] he said and then it seemed like Millions
[1:17:12] said we're resting on it I'm telling you
[1:17:13] I'm resting on it to be honest with you
[1:17:15] I'm Russian brother Bram said in the
[1:17:17] message persevering he said faith is not
[1:17:19] based upon a myth right and upon
[1:17:22] something that well let's just say go do
[1:17:25] this or do that
[1:17:27] on the words of some man
[1:17:30] but Faith takes its Eternal resting
[1:17:34] place upon the word of the Lord
[1:17:37] upon God's word which is the Bible
[1:17:42] that's where I'm going to stand I'm
[1:17:43] going to stand with the word I really
[1:17:45] don't care what man says about the word
[1:17:48] I'm going to stay with the word God is
[1:17:50] his own interpreter he interprets his
[1:17:52] word by bringing it to pass
[1:17:55] God's Prophet was not so wishy-washy
[1:17:58] preacher going back and forth
[1:18:01] he stayed with God's way
[1:18:06] like Moses brother Branham chose to
[1:18:08] suffer the Affliction with the people of
[1:18:10] God than to enjoy the pleasures
[1:18:13] of sin for a season
[1:18:16] brother Branham labored and lived for
[1:18:19] his reward
[1:18:23] brother Branham was leaving that Realm
[1:18:26] coming back
[1:18:29] and you know the last words that he
[1:18:31] heard was keep pressing on
[1:18:34] keep pressing on stay on this straight
[1:18:37] and narrow path don't deviate the Holy
[1:18:40] Ghost didn't say you know you've been
[1:18:41] all mess messed up
[1:18:43] no keep pressing on
[1:18:48] brother Branham chose God's way for his
[1:18:50] life
[1:18:52] not just what religion he was going to
[1:18:54] have
[1:18:55] but what he was going to live by brother
[1:18:57] Brandon chose the harder way yes the
[1:19:00] straight narrow path
[1:19:02] now it was nine months later after this
[1:19:04] experience
[1:19:06] that God spoke to brother Branham in a
[1:19:08] prophecy and told him that a huge part a
[1:19:10] huge a huge portion of Heaven is
[1:19:12] awaiting him
[1:19:14] and that because of his choice that he
[1:19:16] made to live his life going God's way
[1:19:20] it was on February 11 1961 that God used
[1:19:25] a Baptist brother Danny Henry
[1:19:27] he happened to be the cousin of a famous
[1:19:30] actress Jane Russell
[1:19:32] but God used him nevertheless to carry
[1:19:34] out this important message of
[1:19:37] encouragement to brother Branham brother
[1:19:39] Brandon was sharing this he said now
[1:19:40] listen here you might think I'm hard
[1:19:45] but watch here
[1:19:47] because thou has chosen the Narrow Path
[1:19:49] the harder way thou has walked of thine
[1:19:53] own choosing see that free more agency
[1:19:56] I just love that free more agency
[1:20:01] he says now I can understand that that
[1:20:03] Moses had a walk of his own choosing he
[1:20:05] made his decision
[1:20:07] brother Brandon was making his free Mole
[1:20:10] agency
[1:20:11] we need to consider our ways
[1:20:15] have we chosen the hard way have or have
[1:20:18] we chosen the easier path
[1:20:21] are we always making excuses not to do
[1:20:23] what we know is right
[1:20:27] brother Brown said
[1:20:29] that was my decision to stay with the
[1:20:32] word
[1:20:33] that was my decision
[1:20:36] regardless of what it does see
[1:20:39] now I don't know how many times I I used
[1:20:41] to get mocked at and persecuted for the
[1:20:44] for
[1:20:46] working for the Lord in so many
[1:20:48] different ways
[1:20:49] but you know it never bothered me
[1:20:52] because I was doing it of my own
[1:20:54] choosing
[1:20:55] it's my choice
[1:20:58] this is between me and God
[1:21:03] the prophecy went and say thou has did
[1:21:06] this by your own choosing thou has
[1:21:08] picked the correct and precise decision
[1:21:09] and this is my way and because of this
[1:21:12] momentous decision a huge portion of
[1:21:15] Heaven awaits thee
[1:21:17] I wonder what that is
[1:21:19] I wonder what that huge portion of
[1:21:21] Heaven that was awaiting him
[1:21:24] the correct and precise decision
[1:21:27] we might say it's a good and acceptable
[1:21:29] and perfect will of God
[1:21:32] what a glorious decision that was made
[1:21:35] this in itself is that which will give
[1:21:37] and may come to pass that tremendous
[1:21:40] victory in love divine I'll tell you if
[1:21:42] we were so full of the love of God that
[1:21:45] nothing could bother us what more would
[1:21:48] you want
[1:21:49] let come what may take everything I have
[1:21:53] say what you want to say I am so free in
[1:21:56] God's love I am not bothered
[1:21:58] you talk about a tremendous victory
[1:22:02] Give Me Jesus take this whole world but
[1:22:05] give me Jesus
[1:22:08] we can't come into perfect love divine
[1:22:11] without choosing to lay down our life
[1:22:13] for God Amen to live for others you
[1:22:17] can't come into perfect love divine
[1:22:19] without choosing the harder path
[1:22:23] this in itself this choosing in itself
[1:22:27] is that which will give and make come to
[1:22:29] pass the tremendous victory in love
[1:22:31] divine so we must consider our ways we
[1:22:34] must consider I could be wrong
[1:22:39] are you choosing the harder way
[1:22:43] or have we stepped off in the easier
[1:22:45] path
[1:22:47] the easier way
[1:22:50] we got to choose God's heart we got to
[1:22:53] choose his desires we got to choose his
[1:22:54] will
[1:22:55] in his way for our life we got to be
[1:22:57] like David a man after God's Own Heart
[1:23:01] Oh Brother John you're David Fell he
[1:23:04] fell more than once
[1:23:07] he was still a man after God's Own Heart
[1:23:11] consider
[1:23:13] have you been putting the word of God
[1:23:15] first in your life
[1:23:16] have you been building the kingdom
[1:23:19] or of other things crept in
[1:23:22] consider your ways Colossians chapter 3
[1:23:24] verse 1. we're we're just about time
[1:23:27] just so you know food is not going away
[1:23:31] I am allowing your stomach to make more
[1:23:34] room for good food
[1:23:39] Colossians chapter 3 verse one if you
[1:23:42] then be risen with Christ
[1:23:45] seek those things which are above
[1:23:48] where Christ sitteth on the right hand
[1:23:51] of God
[1:23:53] set your affections on things above and
[1:23:55] not the things of the Earth
[1:23:57] for you are dead and your life is hid
[1:23:59] with Christ in God and when Christ who
[1:24:02] is our life shall appear
[1:24:06] then shall ye also appear with him in
[1:24:10] glory
[1:24:12] there are such nuggets in God's word
[1:24:18] you know many people think they have
[1:24:20] chosen the hard way because they
[1:24:22] accepted the message
[1:24:24] that is not hard
[1:24:28] what's hard is living the message amen
[1:24:31] that's the harder way to live what the
[1:24:34] message told us to live which was the
[1:24:36] same thing that the Bible said
[1:24:38] it just broken down so we can understand
[1:24:40] it
[1:24:42] come on
[1:24:46] the harder way is to live this message
[1:24:50] so we need to consider are we living it
[1:24:52] could we be wrong
[1:24:55] surely we're building our life we don't
[1:24:56] have to leave here and wonder about the
[1:24:58] things that we're going to do next week
[1:25:00] like nobody needs to come and tell me my
[1:25:03] wife does not need to come and tell me
[1:25:04] you need to work on your Greenhouse
[1:25:08] she don't have to do that it's already
[1:25:11] there I'm already planning it
[1:25:17] but have I considered God's house
[1:25:20] God's kingdom God's people
[1:25:24] have I considered a soul
[1:25:27] have I considered the missionaries
[1:25:30] have I considered helping some weak
[1:25:32] Christian
[1:25:35] because that's what God wants me to
[1:25:37] consider to seek first the kingdom of
[1:25:40] God and his righteousness
[1:25:43] brother Brandon didn't choose the heart
[1:25:45] away at the end of his life
[1:25:47] he wasn't the example of the man that
[1:25:50] was on the cross that said Lord remember
[1:25:52] me when you get into your kingdom
[1:25:54] he made that decision early in life
[1:25:59] we need to make that decision early
[1:26:03] and and I'll say like this no matter
[1:26:05] where we're all at here and I praise God
[1:26:07] for where we're all at I stand with our
[1:26:09] sister Batman and brother Batman
[1:26:12] what a family we have here
[1:26:14] and I'm so grateful for the grace of God
[1:26:16] that's been in all of our Lives amen but
[1:26:19] I'm here to tell you that God wants us
[1:26:21] to consider giving him more of Our Lives
[1:26:27] part of our prayer
[1:26:31] I'm telling you you ought to have be
[1:26:33] putting everything you got into God
[1:26:41] us older people are we're winding up
[1:26:46] now I want to ask you this question what
[1:26:48] is that huge part of Heaven that was
[1:26:51] waiting for Brother Branham
[1:26:54] what was this this great crown that he
[1:26:57] was thinking about
[1:26:59] anybody know
[1:27:04] that's right
[1:27:06] think about that the huge part of Heaven
[1:27:08] that was awaiting him was all the people
[1:27:10] that was attached to him to this message
[1:27:16] that's the part that's awaiting you and
[1:27:18] I
[1:27:20] everything that you put into a soul
[1:27:24] is a part of your inheritance
[1:27:27] first Thessalonians 2 19 says for what
[1:27:31] is Our Hope
[1:27:33] or or joy
[1:27:35] or crown of rejoicing
[1:27:39] are not even you in the presence of our
[1:27:42] Lord Jesus Christ at his coming
[1:27:46] remember
[1:27:47] he's coming with those
[1:27:52] for ye are our glory and our joy
[1:27:57] Paul is looking at the Thessalonian
[1:28:01] church as his glory and his Joy his
[1:28:05] crown of rejoicing his hope when
[1:28:10] at the presence of God's coming
[1:28:15] Philippians chapter 4 verse 1 therefore
[1:28:18] my beloved Brethren and long for my joy
[1:28:21] and my crown so Stand Fast in the Lord
[1:28:24] my dearly beloved Revelations 22 verse
[1:28:27] 11. we're winding down and beloved I
[1:28:30] come quickly and my reward is with me to
[1:28:33] give every man according as his work
[1:28:35] shall be
[1:28:38] well brother Branham has a huge part of
[1:28:41] Heaven awaiting him
[1:28:45] he's got a because his work has been
[1:28:48] great
[1:28:53] he gave up his life for the kingdom of
[1:28:56] God to build the kingdom of God he gave
[1:28:58] up his important time to the course of
[1:29:00] the day
[1:29:01] to win a soul
[1:29:03] and that soul will be eternally attached
[1:29:06] to him I don't want to be sitting in
[1:29:09] heaven brother Orlando
[1:29:11] with nobody around me
[1:29:15] because I didn't win them to the Lord
[1:29:19] well I'm looking at other people and
[1:29:21] seeing that they won others to the Lord
[1:29:25] amen they get to share eternity
[1:29:27] with that person always being attached
[1:29:30] to them and I don't got anybody attached
[1:29:31] to me
[1:29:35] I know it's a sobering thought but we're
[1:29:37] running out of time
[1:29:40] and look what is wrong with us getting
[1:29:42] serious with God you tell me what's
[1:29:45] wrong with that what's a bad thing about
[1:29:46] that
[1:29:48] to get to get serious about souls
[1:29:51] you'll never regret it they that win
[1:29:53] souls is wise
[1:29:56] choose the harder way I know you've got
[1:29:58] to give up your time to go win a soul
[1:30:01] I know we'd like it to be well if the
[1:30:03] Lord opens the door and you know we just
[1:30:06] happen to run into shoulders at the bank
[1:30:08] teller
[1:30:10] I know I understand that's that's that's
[1:30:12] nice but Jesus said go ye out amen
[1:30:16] there's something that we got to do have
[1:30:18] a heart to go out not a heart to fit it
[1:30:21] in Lord of you know
[1:30:24] fit it in for me while I'm doing my busy
[1:30:26] schedule
[1:30:28] so I want to ask you a question have you
[1:30:29] chosen the harder way
[1:30:34] have you given up your life
[1:30:38] how about your will how about your time
[1:30:42] can you say I have given up everything
[1:30:44] for Christ
[1:30:48] then this message is for you
[1:30:52] and all you got to say is Lord I'm I'm
[1:30:54] concerning my ways
[1:30:56] amen I'm I'm gonna

[1:31:00] kind of going forward waiting for the
[1:31:02] rapture
[1:31:04] and you've pricked my heart with
[1:31:08] my reward
[1:31:10] am I just going to be satisfied with
[1:31:12] being in heaven or do
[1:31:15] when
[1:31:17] you know if there's nobody in heaven
[1:31:19] because I won them there that means I've
[1:31:21] been pretty lazy on the earth and I
[1:31:23] really don't want everybody staring at
[1:31:24] me
