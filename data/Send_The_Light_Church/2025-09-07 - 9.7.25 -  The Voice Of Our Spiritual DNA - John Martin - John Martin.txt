Dear heavenly father, Lord, as we come before you this morning, Lord, there's many things we have needs of, Lord, but Lord, really none greater than of a greater walk with you, a deeper walk with you, Lord. And we just pray this morning, Lord, that as the word comes, Lord, that whatever would be brought to our ears, whatever would be brought to our heart, Lord, we would just, Lord, just believe it, Lord. not question it, not think about it, Lord, but just accept it in our hearts with by faith that we might grow in your love, Lord, and come closer to you, Lord.

On the 13th at 6:00, I believe. So, let's just lift that up with the fontains and let's make sure that there's not an empty seat. So, there's a lot of empty seats here, but if everybody brought somebody, I think there'd be full seats. So, let's just kind of look at it as as an not an obligation as far as something that you have to do, but something that you want to do for Christ. Amen. So, let's just lift him up this morning. Amen. Amen. Let's just sing Friendship with Jesus. Amen. [Music] A friend of Jesus. Oh, what bliss that one so weak as I should ever have a friend like this to lead me to the sky. Friendship with Jesus. Fellowship divine. Oh, what a blessed sweet communion. Jesus is a friend of mine. A friend when others friendship cease. A friend when others fail. A friend who gives me joy and peace. A friend who will prevail. Friendship with Jesus. Fellowship divine. Oh, what blessed sweet communion. Jesus is a friend of mine. A friend to lead me in the dark. A friend who knows the way. A friend to steer my weak frail bark. A friend that doubts to pay debts friendship with Jesus. Fellowship divine. Oh blessed sweet communion. Jesus is a friend of mine.

Let's ask that friend to fill our way with love this morning. Hallelujah. Who needs more love? Let me walk, blessed Lord, in the way thou has gone, leading straight to the land above. Giving cheer everywhere to the sad and alone. Fill my way every day with love. Granted, Lord, fill my way every day with love as I walk with a heavenly dove. Let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Keep me close to the side of my Savior and guide. Let me never in darkness ro. Keep my path free from wrath and my soul satisfied. Fill my way every day with love. Fill my way every day with love. As I walk with that heavenly dove, let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Soon that race will be over and I'll travel no more, but abide in my home above. Thank you, Lord. Let me sing. Oh, bless the king all the way to the shore. Fill my way every day with love. Fill my way every day with love. As I walk with that heavenly dove. Let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Fill my way every day with love as I walk with that heavenly dove. Let me go all the while with a song and a smile. Fill my way every day with love. Grant it Lord. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. He is love. So if you want your way filled with love, just look to him. Amen. Let's just stand this this morning. Amen. Amen. Brother Orlando, could you just lead us in some tithes and offerings? Amen. Let's just stay standing as uh our brother gets ready to come and say, "I want to know him more." Amen. I want to know you more. Deep within my soul, I want to know you. Oh, I want to know you. Now I give you your mind. Looking in your eyes stirs up within me. Cries that say I want to know you. Oh, I want to know you more. more. Oh, I want to know you more. Deep within my soul, I want to know you. Oh, I want to know you. And I would give my final breath to know you in your death and resurrection. Oh, I want to know you more. Oh, I want to know you more. Is that your desire? Oh, I want to know you more. Deep within my soul, I want to know you. Oh, I want to know you. To feel your heart and know your mind. Looking in your eyes stirs up within me. Christ said, "Say, I want to know you." Oh, I want to know you more. Oh, I want to know you more. Deep within my soul, I want to know you. Oh, I want to know you. And I would give my final [Music] more. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isn't that beautiful? &gt;&gt; The world is full of colleges wanting to know something. And it's interesting. I mean, watch the Marvel Channel, the Discovery Channel. It's a beautiful thing to learn, but there's nothing more important than than knowing more of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And uh we can only know him by him speaking it to us. &gt;&gt; Right? If I speak it, if a man speaks it, or we read it, we'll miss out. And that's why we're desperate to hear the voice of God this morning. That the reality of God speaking to us as individuals. This is why we've come. If this does not happen, I would have to say that our gathering would be in vain. &gt;&gt; Amen. We we are our dependency is on the Lord that he will be here to speak to us as individuals today. &gt;&gt; Amen. So good to see everyone in the house of the Lord. We've missed some of you and just good to be back together. Turn with me if you would in the scriptures today. The first scripture is going to be Isaiah chapter 30 and the second is going to be 3R John chapter 1. 3R John chapter 1. And we want to entitle the message today the voice of our spiritual DNA. The voice of our spiritual DNA. Amen. When you've got to the scripture, say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Let's look to the author before we read. Our heavenly father, Lord, we're looking to you, the author and the finisher of our faith. We know, Lord, we're somewhere here in the middle of our walk with you. But we know that there is an end to our faith. And it's an expected end, an end of peace, an end. Lord, when we look there in Revelations 19 and verse 7, we we see that there the wife, your wife have made herself ready at the end. And Lord, that's our our our yearning and our desire is to be ready for the rapture. for you said there in Matthew 24, be ready for I come in an hour you know not. Lord, we want to be ready. Our our lambs trimmed and clear and our and and just full of the Holy Ghost this morning, full of your love. Lord, may you come now in the breaking of the bread of life. May this message, Lord, uh be uh received in the simplicity in which it was intended to be. God will give you the praise for all these things. For we humbly pray now in Jesus Christ's precious name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah chapter 30 and verse 21 says, "And thine ears shall hear a word behind thee, saying, this is the way. Walk ye in it when you turn to the right hand and when you turn to the left." Amen. And then third John chapter 1, this is the way. Walk ye in it. Amen. That's the voice that uh we're hearing behind us. Amen. And then 3R John chapter 1 verse4 says, I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. You may be seated. We all have DNA. Actually, all living organisms have DNA. It serves as a complete instruction manual to build another you. That's why they can go back now and from 50 years later get the DNA out of somebody's body and be able to tell who who it is or tie it to a a a crime because inside that is really who you are. Just they can tell by that that one it's a complex molecule that blueprints exactly who you are. And a specific segment of each DNA is called a gene which contains the instructions of making you there. It's the the the vehicle that tells uh parts of your body what to be the the proteins or how your liver or what's going to happen. So that that that that segment of the gene I that segment of the DNA called the gene, it contains the instructions. Now we've all heard of having certain genetics that are passed on by our parents. Physical traits that appear like hair color or the the shape of your your nose or the freckles. But they're also traits that are not seen. traits like diabetes or or heart problems. And you've often heard uh somebody say that um they've got this in their life because their parents had it. And uh there are also other traits like mental and behavior traits that can also be passed on through the genes of your parents into you. Now, we've all have certain genes inside of us that are hereditary. Now, there are two different types of genes. One's hereditary and one is is not hereditary. And those are ones that can actually evolve in in your in your life after you're born. But these ones that are hereditary, they are passed down from generation onto generation. And and I mean, I'm talking about 10 generations. I mean, we've got stuff inside of us that go back, let's see, hundred, let's see, what would that be? Uh, how many generations? I mean, that's thousands of years. That's a long time ago. I mean, we got stuff in us that when we were over on the other side of the planet, our our relatives were on the other side of the planet, we literally got their genes from a long time ago. &gt;&gt; And um, how many times have you ever heard your children say to you, "Thanks, mom. Thanks, Dad. Now I got this because of you. It's just hereditary. You You can't choose. It's just part of it. Now, Leviticus 17:1 says, "For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls. For it is the blood that maketh an atonement for your soul. So inside our natural uh body is the blood. And brother Brandon has taught us that the life is in the blood. That's where um you you you your you can learn about your genetics and learn about your DNA. And the scripture makes it clear that the life of the flesh is in the blood. It's not in the muscle. It is not in the organ. It's in the blood. The blood is what transfers the oxygen, the the the the minerals, the proteins, the nutrients that is needed to get to all the organs so we can function. It also has that part where it takes away the the the bad stuff and it it separates and that is how we function. Now we are going somewhere with us. Amen. This morning, Exodus 12:12 says, "For I will pass through the land of Egypt this night. And I will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and beast, and against all the gods of Egypt, I will execute judgment. I am the Lord." Now, the firstborn here represents all those who do not receive the second birth. Can you say amen? Or or the second nature &gt;&gt; or the or the DNA. The DNA has to be changed. That's what that's that's really what it's all about. When you're born again, you no longer have the DNA of Satan that we were born with. We have the DNA of God. &gt;&gt; And verse 13, and the blood shall be to you for a token upon your houses wherein you are. And when I see the blood, I'll pass over you. When I see that life now, back then, the Old Testament was all natural. The the the wars were natural. Um everything was natural. &gt;&gt; In the New Testament is spiritual warfare. In the New Testament, it's the life that's in the blood. &gt;&gt; It's not the literal uh bloody life, but it's the spirit that's in that blood. So when I see the blow pass over you and the plague shall not be unto you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt. So God is going to smite this earth. He's going to burn it with fire. &gt;&gt; And this day shall be unto you for a memorial. Now catch this. I want you to see the DNA here. And ye shall keep it as a feast to the Lord throughout your generations. You shall keep it a feast by an ordinance forever. &gt;&gt; Now God is the same yesterday, today, and forever. His DNA is the same yesterday. And it is passed on from generation unto generation. &gt;&gt; And this life that's in the blood, if it's applied to us today, it will be the same as the blood that was applied on the day of Pentecost. Amen. &gt;&gt; The feast of the blood being applied. The feast. It shall be unto you a feast. I'll call it the feast of the blood being applied. If we don't apply the blood, it don't do us any good. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The DNA has to be changed. Well, Jesus died for the whole world, but is the whole world going to be saved? &gt;&gt; And it's not saying I believe that Jesus died is believing what Jesus died for. &gt;&gt; It's not the knowledge. See, the Satan has the knowledge that Jesus died on the cross. &gt;&gt; They know it. I mean, the devils believe and they tremble. But the belief is the plan of God is for us to accept the life that came through that blood so our DNA can be changed into God's DNA. Our nature can be changed. &gt;&gt; So it does no good to say I believe and not receive the Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are not saved by a personal belief. We are saved by the blood of Jesus Christ. And I'm not speaking the natural. I'm speaking of the spiritual. Now, the natural had to be paid. Calvary had to happen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But we have to receive now the life &gt;&gt; is is It it and that's what I love about the word of God. &gt;&gt; It helps us to see clearly than what man thinks it is. Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So for the life of the flesh is in the blood. Now Jesus speaking here in Matthew 28 of of Matthew 26:28. He says, "For this is my blood of the new testament which is shed for many for the remission of sins." But now in order to receive the remission of sins, the blood has to be applied. And if the blood is applied, the DNA of our nature will be changed. That's what I'm saying. How many people do we know that say they're born again and they do the very same things they did when they were in the world? like nothing has changed. &gt;&gt; Like where is that in the gospel? &gt;&gt; But there's churches that that will accept that because because they want you as a member. I mean I don't I don't really know. Maybe because they just don't have an understanding. They just think it's an intellectual belief that you make it. But God is really interested in seeing us walk into the in the truth. Right. &gt;&gt; He he wants to see our lives changed. and to become more like him. So the feast of the blood being applied is what changes the DNA into Christ. So we're really have the same nature as God. In 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 16, we're going to touch on this verse and then come back to it. But wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh. Yay, though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. So it's no more about physically knowing God. That means us intellectually figuring out what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; It's no longer the natural blood or the natural DNA, but it's the life of the blood or the spiritual DNA. Brother Brandham said on the wings of a snow white dove. He says I believe the blood is regeneration. That is what regenerates our life is the life that was in the blood of Christ, the Holy Ghost, the life of God. Now that word regeneration means spiritual rebirth, spiritual renovation. Uh so you know a lot of people want to reform themselves. They want to go to church and they want to just, you know, try to be a better person, try to, you know, get some better habits, be more polite, not yell at the wife or not yell at the husband or be nice to the neighbor and and and try to develop a better sense of being a better person. But that is not spiritual rebirth. &gt;&gt; That that it's it's a reformation of the old nature. It's like going to AA meetings. I talked to somebody and he he's he's still going to a a meetings and he's pretty proud uh uh of of how long um he's been able to go and you know many people they go to those those meetings and they're good for a little bit and then they they revert back because the nature never got changed &gt;&gt; and and we as Christians we understand that we need the life of God inside of us. Brother Brandham says you you can't live it. You are not meant to live the word. Only God can live the word in you. &gt;&gt; Which makes us either a part of God or are not a part of God. All they that were ordained to eternal life, they received the word of God. Matthew 19:25, for when his disciples heard it, they were exceedingly amazed, and they said, "Who can be saved? If it's so hard to be saved, who then can be saved?" But Jesus beheld them and said unto them, "With men, this is impossible. You can't you could build a a tower of Babel, but it's impossible. But with God, all things are possible." &gt;&gt; And then answered Peter and said unto him, "Behold, we have forsaken all and follow thee. What is there left for us to do?" How many feels that you have forsaken all? I mean, Peter said he forsook all. I I think it's a I think it's a good uh it's a good thing to to take a stand and say, "I have forsaken all &gt;&gt; because if if we don't get to that place, we got to get to that place before we get to where Jesus told Peter he needs to go." And Jesus said unto them, "Verily, I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration." Now, that's a spiritual rebirth. Because that hadn't happened yet, right? At that point, it hadn't happened yet. When the son of man shall sit in the throne of his glory, if I could say it like like this, when he sits in your heart, sits in the throne room of and and receives glory for the life that you're living, ye shall also sit upon the 12 thrones judging the uh the 12 tribes of Israel. Of course, we know that's down the road, that part. Now look at what it takes to follow Jesus into the spiritual rebirth. Verse 29. And everyone that have forsaken houses, brethren, sisters, or fathers, or mothers, or wife, or children, or lands for my name's sake shall receive a hundfold and shall inher inherit eternal life. See, it's a little bit more than just saying, I believe Jesus died for me. &gt;&gt; It's a little bit more than that. And that's why Jesus encourages, if I could use that word, search the scriptures, &gt;&gt; for in them you think you have eternal life, but they are they which testify of me. They tell us how to believe. The scriptures tell us how to believe correctly. So we we don't want to know Christ in the flesh, but in the spirit. 1 Corinthians 12:13 tells us, "For by one spirit are we all baptized into one body." One spirit, one DNA baptizes us into the body. It's not something that, you know, some churches say, "Well, we don't really know how to do that." So, if you would just please come and put your name on the book, we'll just say that you're in. or since I don't know how to manif. But in reality, it's by the Holy Ghost birthing the DNA inside of you that you become part of God's family. And nothing short of that will work. &gt;&gt; Church attendance won't work. Money won't work. By one spirit are we all baptized into the body. Whether you be Jew or Greek or Jew, I'm sorry, Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free. It doesn't matter who you are. And have all and been all made to drink into one spirit. &gt;&gt; Drink into one spirit. Oh, I wish we had more time to take our time, but I just need you to stay with me. The feast of the blood being applied is what changes the DNA. Jesus said in John 6:56, "He that eateth my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood dwelleth in me, and I in him." &gt;&gt; We got to drink the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; We've got to eat the word. Now, what that really means to eat the word is when you when you actually hear the word that you leave church and you say, "I'm going to live that word." It isn't saying, "By I've already heard this before. I I already know that. I intellectually believe it's true." You've got to leave with the DNA of becoming that word. Amen. &gt;&gt; What good will it do to sit in a church all your life, hear the absolute truth, &gt;&gt; and it never change you? &gt;&gt; I think about this little hole in a wall here, and I know it's a beautiful place. It's a beautiful country. I love the church. But I'm saying in the midst of this whole city, nobody knows the truth is here. It is the only thing that can set us free from the old DNA. &gt;&gt; The wrong nature is the nature of God by one spirit. And he says, "He that eats my flesh and drinkkeeth my blood, he dwells in me and I dwell in him." There's a union there. There's a oneness there. And as the living father hath sent me, and I live by the Father, so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me. We no longer do what we want to do. &gt;&gt; We no longer just come to church and and and play part like play church. If I could say it like that. We don't play church. We become the church. &gt;&gt; We become the church of the living God. &gt;&gt; We're living by the spiritual DNA of Jesus. When we eat the word and we we drink the blood, we receive the Holy Ghost inside of us, we receive the DNA of God, the spiritual DNA. Verse 58, this is that bread. This is that bread that came down from heaven, not as your fathers did eat mana and are dead. In other words, it was a natural it was a natural miracle that part they partook of. But they still died from it. They still died. But he that eateth of this bread, he shall live forever because God DNA, he can't die. He can't die. That's why he's the same yesterday, today, and forever. &gt;&gt; And that's why when we receive the Holy Ghost, we'll do the works of Christ. We'll we'll we'll have the same. We'll live for others. It'll be just like Christ. Now remember, for the life of the flesh is in the blood. The blood transfers the oxygen and the nutrients. The Holy Ghost is what gives life to the word of God inside of us. &gt;&gt; The last thing we'd want to Oh my my. The letter killth, but it's the spirit that gives life. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "My words are spirit. The words that I speak, they are spirit and they are life." &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost is what brings life to the word. &gt;&gt; So that's why our dependency is that the Holy Ghost would come and anoint our minds and anoint our hearts and anoint our vessels to receive the word that's being preached from the pulpit. What good does it do to sit here, hear the word of God, and our lives not be changed? &gt;&gt; We've got to have God personally speak to us. It ain't good enough to have God behind this pulpit. You got to have God in that seat right with you just as much. &gt;&gt; When we care enough to hear God speak to us personally, it will bring the life of the word inside of us. It would change us from glory onto glory. It would change our spiritual DNA from being selfish to selfless. From living for ourselves when we go out of here to actually think about somebody. &gt;&gt; Amen. 2 Corinthians chapter 5 verse 15-18. This is what happens when we receive the living word of God. He and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves, but unto him which died for them and rose again. So this is just just take this one verse. Think about this. In the course of your day yesterday, how much time did you spend living for Jesus? I'm just This is just the word. This isn't John Martin's idea. This is just what the word says. Wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh. A though we have known Christ after the flesh, yet now henceforth know we him no more. Therefore, if we know Christ in the spirit, if we if if any man be in Christ, right, you eat the word, you drink the blood, he is a new creature. It's a new DNA. Old things are passed away and behold, all things become new. &gt;&gt; And all things are of God. A new creature means new DNA. Brother Ram said like this, if the spirit of Beethoven was in you, you would learn, you would play music just like Beethoven. &gt;&gt; And if the spirit of Christ is in you, you'll have the same DNA. You'll do the same works. You'll love others the way he did. Romans 8:11 says, "But if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you, he that raised Christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by the spirit that dwells in you." See, we have to receive the spirit inside of us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, that ain't going to happen unless we hunger. God, fill me with the Holy Ghost. God, I need the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Now, the devil wants you to think that you have enough because if he can convince you that you have enough, there's no need to entertain a thought about coming to the altar. &gt;&gt; There's no need to get serious at home and seek more of the Holy Ghost. But all I got to do is look at my life and realize that I need more to be quickened inside of me. Which means I need more Holy Ghost. I need more of the DNA. You know, you got a lot of you got a lot of different genes. I mean, you've got you got at at least 19,000 genes. I mean there's a lot of stuff happening in our bodies. Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; As you receive the word, you become the word. Now if you just receive the knowledge of the word, what happens? The Bible says you get puffed up, right? Knowledge puffth up. But when you receive the spirit of the word, that's charity. That's what edifies those that are around you. Quicken means to be made alive. New DNA from God's Holy Spirit. 2 Corinthians 3:17. Now the Lord is that spirit. And where the spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty. How many want God to have liberty in your life? &gt;&gt; That means you got to give up your will. You got to say you got to spend more time with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Spend time with him in prayer. And but we all with an open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image of God from glory unto glory even by what? The spirit of the Lord. This is why if we come to church and we're not all here, you know what I mean? No, no, I don't want to get down on anybody that's tired, but I'm just I'm just going to be honest with you. If you don't enter into the spirit of the word, how are you going to be changed &gt;&gt; there? There needs to be a in order for this to happen, there needs to be something that happened yesterday to prepare for today. &gt;&gt; I want to be changed. If we're not changed, all we're going to do is satisfy our carnal conscience and feel like, well, I came to church. I did my job. &gt;&gt; But we'll never become like him. We'll never be changed. We'll never get the same DNA. The DNA comes from the Holy Ghost. It doesn't come from currently understanding the Bible. &gt;&gt; Now, God is changing his bride into the same image of himself. &gt;&gt; She is receiving the same DNA &gt;&gt; because it's passed on from generation to generation. It's not by power. It's not by my but it's by my spirit sayaeth the Lord. God is changing your spiritual DNA as you receive the word. Now what I mean by that receiving the word is that this word becomes so much more important to you. &gt;&gt; Because anybody can say amen to the word. &gt;&gt; But the amen that we're looking for is what the amen really means. What does amen really mean? So be it. Be it Mary said, "Be it unto me &gt;&gt; according to thy word." That's what we got to say. How many Marys are there here? &gt;&gt; Right? Because everybody wasn't chosen. Many are called. You are chosen. The blood of God speaks today. The blood of God speaks today. When Abel was killed by his brother, the Bible says that Abel's blood cried out to God. &gt;&gt; And Hebrews 12:24 says that the blood of Christ speaketh better things than the blood of Abel. &gt;&gt; And Jesus said, "For this is my blood of the new testament, and it's speaking better things." Amen. Brother said in the message, the token, he said, "The blood is speaking. The blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is the word. Hallelujah. That's what makes it whether it's right or wrong. The word is identified by the voice of the blood. The voice of the blood is the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; And that is what brings life. He says and it brings life to the word and it quickens it. That's why we we should be more desperate about getting into the presence of God &gt;&gt; more than anything when we come to church. &gt;&gt; Not just being here on time, &gt;&gt; but getting into the presence of God so that when the word is being preached, something happens on the inside of you. Something quickens. &gt;&gt; I mean, we've all been drunk before, haven't we? &gt;&gt; All been high or drunk at one time in life. never. Well, God bless you. That never happened to you. But when it happens, let me just say this. You're dizzy. You're not all there. You're in another realm. And when the Holy Ghost touches you, well, you've ever felt the anointing of God come down upon you, &gt;&gt; you're in another realm. something happens. Everything is shut out. You're shut in with God in a secret place, &gt;&gt; beholding his glory. So when we sit here and we hear the word of God speaking, we must believe it is God that is speaking to us personally. &gt;&gt; And what's he speaking about? About your nature change. Now, we all want God to fix our homes, and to fix our everything else, fix our bank account, fix our goals, fix our plans, fix, fix, fix, fix, fix. But God's here primarily for one reason. Now, he's a good God. He'll heal, you know, do whatever because he's good. He's so good, he does it to his enemies. But I'm telling you, God's purpose is to get us ready to get to the other side. &gt;&gt; That can't happen unless our nature gets changed. &gt;&gt; So God is speaking to us about changing our nature. &gt;&gt; So if we get in tune with that, we'll probably hear more his voice. So remember that God is wanting to change our nature into what? His nature. He wants to get the DNA inside of us. Now that happens as we believe the word from our heart like I want that Lord. I want that for my I choose that for my life. He's wanting to change your spiritual DNA. He's wanting to give you his DNA. He wants to give you like a blood transfusion, the building blocks or the blueprint to become just like Jesus. &gt;&gt; I can see why Jesus said, "The truth shall set you free." The truth is what sets us free. 1 John chapter 3 verse 1. First John chapter 3 verse one says, "Behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon you and I that we should be that we should have the same DNA as God." Right? It's passed on to the sons of God. Therefore, the world doesn't know us because it didn't know him. Behold, now are we the sons of God. The DNA is inside of us, and it does not yet appear what we shall be. But because we know we got the same DNA, we shall be like him, for we shall see him like he is. &gt;&gt; And every man that has this hope, what is he doing? He's coming to church. He's hearing the word and he's purifying himself even as he is pure. &gt;&gt; So when we hear God's blood speaking, which is the word of God, we must believe it is God speaking to us personally about a nature change. That's why you when you leave church, you want to be able to say, "God spoke to me. &gt;&gt; God spoke. I heard God speak to me person. I do like I I don't know what God is saying to sister Linda or brother James or brother Orlando. I don't know. I don't know. That's God's business. &gt;&gt; But I do know what he spoke to me. &gt;&gt; That's what's important. It's coming in contact with God because if he doesn't speak to you, you're alone. Oh, what a thought. If God doesn't speak to you, you're alone. I'd rather have God rebuke me. At least he's speaking to me. &gt;&gt; At least I know there's that relationship there. And because you believe your spiritual gene contains the very instructions of what to do with the word when you hear it, you obey the word of God and then you become the living manifestation of the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; You put your foot Everything if you look in the Old Testament everything's put your foot forward, &gt;&gt; right? Put your foot in the water &gt;&gt; and it'll it'll it'll move. Go just take that step towards Goliath. Just walk in faith believing God will meet you there. Draw nigh to God. He'll draw nigh to you. So when you you hear the word of God and and the word of God tells you to, you know, to be more faithful, you just by faith say, "I'm going to be more faithful." and you will become more faithful. But you got to believe it. And the gene of God believes the word of God. &gt;&gt; The gene of God believes the word of God. That's why that little chicken in the bar in that barn, he couldn't he couldn't just he couldn't stay in that condition. He couldn't just peck around the rest of his life acting like these low-life chickens. [Laughter] God had put something in him. It's about to fly. And there's We're eagles. &gt;&gt; We are eagles. &gt;&gt; That means we're supposed to fly above the things of this world. It's not going to keep us down. Our DNA is it flies. Is it is it is it like the chickens that stay in the ground? &gt;&gt; Got a different DNA. You start to look more like Christ the word and you act more like Christ the word. Your priorities begin to change. Your spiritual habits begin to change. Church is no longer church, but you actually hunger to hear the voice of God speaking to you. When you come to church, &gt;&gt; you begin to turn the cheek. go the second mile and start living for others. In other words, you begin looking more like Jesus Christ himself. &gt;&gt; How many times, and we've all had this experience, how many times have you um you were introduced to somebody and they said, "Um, oh, are you are you a Christian? [Applause] But you look at some people's life, they say they're a Christian, and you what? &gt;&gt; Because they're not looking like a Christian. &gt;&gt; But there's no doubt at one time James was a a little baby boy &gt;&gt; and he looked so cute. What? What? He He's cuter. That's what happened. &gt;&gt; But he grew up to manifest the genes that is inside of him. &gt;&gt; That's naturally. Now, spiritually, every one of our genes that we were born with were from the pit of hell. We're all liars. Didn't care about anything except oursel. M Mr. and Mrs. Proud being introduced to Mr. and Mrs. Prrowder. Keep up with the Joneses. But now we receive the gene of God. And now we begin to look more like Jesus. We become sweeter, more full of the love of God. We're no longer manipulating others to love us, to do things for us. We actually laid down our lives for others. We show them with our life how to live the life of Christ. You know, we sometimes we got too much religion. &gt;&gt; Too much religion where we use the word to manipulate other people in the church. That is not what Christ did. So when we hear God's blood speaking to us, which is the word, we mix it with faith. Just you hear the word of God, don't say, "Wow, that's how am I going to be able to how do I receive that? I need something supernatural happening." No, you don't. Brother Brand said in the message the Tolken, and by the way, that hissup was just common weeds. Hissup means your faith. Somebody tries to have supernatural faith. That's the reason you miss your healing. Faith is just a is just a common thing. You got faith to come to church. You got faith to walk out there. You got faith to start your car. You got faith to eat your dinner. That's the way it is. It's common faith. Now you apply the blood with was I'm sorry and you and to apply the blood was applied with hissup which is just common weeds that grow everywhere in Palestine showing that faith that the faith that the blood is to be applied is not some super thing that you have all kinds of doctors of degrees to do it. It's just common everyday faith to believe in God, apply the blood by faith with the hissup. So I'll just say this. Even though you may seem simple and you know you're not much of feel like you're much of anything in church, you come into church with a different attitude. You come into church just believing that you're here for God. Just you and God. Just over in the corner. Nobody sees you. Nobody knows what's happening, but it's you and God. And I'm telling you, you believe the word as if God's speaking to you, and something is going to happen in your life, cuz God cannot lie. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 4:2 says, "For unto us was the gospel preached as well as unto them. But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard." So we can come to church, hear the word, and not take faith to believe this is for my life. &gt;&gt; I mean, do you ever hear hear this voice that says, "Oh, that that was for so and so." We all heard that voice. Oh, I wish so and so was here for that. Um, I understand that the word is probably for others, too. But we just need to have the attitude that I need the word for me, you know, to rake rake it in. &gt;&gt; Romans 10 verse1 15 says, "At is written, how beautiful are the feet of them that preach the gospel of peace and bring glad tidings of good things." I want you to catch this. God has given us a five-fold ministry to bring us the voice of the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. And how beautiful it is when they come and they give us the voice of God's blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah saith, Isaiah saith, Lord, who has believed our report? So then faith comes by hearing and hearing by the word of God. Now this is why I just want to get this to say this. This is not brother John up here speaking. As sure as anything you one day you'll know that to be the truth. &gt;&gt; It is God that's trying to get to his people. &gt;&gt; But you have to believe the report. So Hebrews chapter 12 says I'm going to start verse 23. We're going to have to hurry cuz I still got quite a bit here. To the general assembly and the church of the firstborn. Now, this doesn't mean of those that were, you know, with the first birth. This really means of those that were uh born of of Jesus Christ. He's the firstborn among many brethren. Amen. So the general assembly and the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven and to the judge of to the god uh to the god and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect. If I slow down I'll get done faster. And to Jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than that of Abel. See that you refuse not him that speaketh. So now God's speaking to us. For if they escape not, who refused him that speaketh on earth, much more shall not we escape, if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven. &gt;&gt; God is speaking from heaven. This morning, &gt;&gt; whose voice then shook the earth, but now he had promised, saying, yet once more I shake not the uh earth only, but also heaven. And this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things that are shaken as of the things that are made. In other words, anything that's man-made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain. And that is the revelation of Jesus Christ. That and we've got to receive the revelation of Jesus Christ. It cannot be shaken. Heaven and earth are going to pass away, but the word of God is not going to pass away. Wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be rem cannot be moved, let us have grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly for for our God is a consuming fire. Now turn with me if you would to Matthew chapter 16. I want to get in to this because it it we're the kingdom of God is God revealing himself to you. It's who God is. Now here in Matthew chapter 16, Jesus is showing an interest in what people think about him. You know, people could talk for hours. What do you think about God? But and it's okay to know about God as long as you don't submit to God, right? But people who have that that attitude are going to miss who God is because he actually hid it from the wise and prudent. Right? So here it is. Matthew 16:13. When Jesus came into the coast of Cesaria Philippi, he asked his disciples saying, "Who do men say that I am?" And he gives them a little the son of man. But who do people say that I am? And some say that John the Baptist, Elias, and others, Jeremiah from one of the prophets. So, we got a lot of different denominations out there, a lot of different churches, independent churches, a lot of different people. We got people who stay home. They won't go to church. They don't feel they need to. They can know God on their own. Got a lot of different views out there. And Jesus has an interest of what people think about him, but he's more interested in what you think about him. personally. And he saith unto them, but whom say you that I am. And Simon Peter answered and said, "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God." And what was beautiful about this, I I would imagine that all anybody could and their brother could have quoted that, but what was different about being able to quote that or know that is how Jesus spoke here and he said, "Blessed art thou, Simon Bjonah, for flesh and blood did not tell you this, but my father which is in heaven." &gt;&gt; Now, if the father could speak to Peter, the father who is in heaven, speak to Peter on earth, the father, the holy ghost can speak to us here in church. And blessed are they that hunger and thirst after it because I believe those are the ones that are going to hear the voice of God. You know, think about this. The people who who refuse to sit in a church, people who refuse to open their Bible, the only gospel they may have ever heard is is the life that was lived in front of them, they are still going to be judged and go to hell. Think about that. Because they heard the voice of God speak to them, everybody's going to get a chance. So just because they stay out of church or stay out of the reading the word or stay out of the message, it doesn't mean they're exempt from the punishment of it. &gt;&gt; I mean, this is a serious thing. We've all been created by God Almighty. &gt;&gt; We We are his subjects. We are his creation. And he is due our respect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. And Simon Peter answered, "Thou the Christ, the living God, for flesh and blood have not revealed this." Jesus said, "But my father which is in heaven, and thou art Peter, and upon this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it." Unless God builds the house, they that labor labor in vain. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we go home and we read the books. We read the Bible, but we don't hunger for God to speak it to us. &gt;&gt; Our labor is in vain. &gt;&gt; How many people do we know know the Bible, quote the Bible all the time, but they don't live it? &gt;&gt; You talk about dangerous. I mean, that is the devil in flesh. &gt;&gt; That is the devil in flesh. He knows the word, but he doesn't live it. That's why the it be that's why the Bible says it been better for them not to known the way of the Lord than to know and turn it down. So Peter goes to church and he's not listening uh to the man Jesus as far as the natural flesh and blood, but he's listening to the voice of the blood in which is unveiling who Christ is personally to him. So already didn't matter what other people thought he's Jeremiah, Laz, or one of the prophets. It doesn't matter. It's like why do why do you even want to talk about it? What's really important is what God has spoken to you personally. I mean, if you literally go home and you write down on a piece of paper, who is God to you? I think it's a good thing to do. Who is God to you? It becomes important then going to church. It go it's important praying. It's important uh living for others. When you know who Jesus is, the word of God becomes important. So, it's no different for us when we hear the word of God being preached. Are we hearing personally from God or are we hearing the voice of the blood of Calvary speaking? It can't be just man's words. It can't be just uh the preaching of the word. It has to be God to you personally. So, as God is revealing himself to you, he's also revealing who you are. &gt;&gt; Why? because you're the same gene as God. That's why to know who God is clearly, that God is someone that demands respect. &gt;&gt; Then your life becomes lined up with the word. &gt;&gt; You're Miss Jesus. You're Mrs. Jesus. I'm sorry. You You are of his same DNA. You have the same spiritual genes. For it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. You are being changed as you receive the word of life. You're a doer of the word and not just a hearer. You know, you can get in a habit of coming to church and just hearing and leaving away. Not changed. I mean changed to be more like Jesus. &gt;&gt; We literally are changed to become more like the enemy. Right? Because brother Bam says, "You never leave church the same way you came in. &gt;&gt; You're either closer to God or further away. We just don't always know it." God reveals to the church not only who Christ is, but he's revealing who his bride is. That's why there's such a hunger to know the voice of God being spoken to us personally. Because think about it, what if you're the only person in the church that's going to make the rapture? &gt;&gt; Think about that. this word becomes important to you. The voice of God being spoken to it, it's it's it's important to you. That last verse, verse 19, and I will give unto thee the keys of the kingdom. He's telling Peter, the keys of heaven. And uh and whatsoever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. Whatsoever you shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. God has given us the keys to the kingdom of heaven. Did you know that? He has given you the word of God. &gt;&gt; He has given you the word of God to speak over your life. &gt;&gt; Whatever you say, it's going to happen. Whatever you bind, it's going to be bound. Whatever you lose, it's going to be You want some habit loosed out of your life, then speak it. God has given you the keys. Yeah. &gt;&gt; When the ears of your heart hear the voice of God's blood speaking to you personally, this is the way walking in it. This is God unveiling your new spiritual DNA. &gt;&gt; It's exciting. It's exciting that I can become like Jesus. &gt;&gt; It's time to walk in it. When you turn from the right, you turn to the left, you're going to hear a voice. That's God leading you. Stay with the word. Stay with the word. Don't make it just, you know, your church services. Stay with the word. That's why John could say, "I have no greater joy than to hear that my children are walking in truth." Oh, to be like Jesus. I don't have time to read all this, but I'm going to do my best. Romans chapter 8. This is the DNA of God. Romans chapter 8, verse 29. Brother Mark had uh read some of these scriptures, but I want to read it a little bit in the light of our new DNA. And if I could just get one amen, I'll continue. If not, then I'm gonna take my time and you're gonna stay here longer than you really want to. No. Romans 8 28 8:29 starting for whom he did forno he also did predestinate to be conformed into the same image or the same DNA of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren. There it is generation after generation after generation after generation being passed on. Moreover, whom he did predestined, he also called them he justified. whom we justified, he glorified. What shall we say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? He that spared not his own son, but delivered him up for us all. How shall uh he not with him also freely give us all things? There it is. He has given us all things that pertain to to life and godliness. Peter says, "Who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect?" It is God that justifies us. Who is he that condemnth? Who is he that condemnth? It is Christ that died rather is risen again. Who is even at the right hand of God who maketh intercession for us. So Christ has taken care of every possible problem that we could have in our life. &gt;&gt; Every single problem he has taken care of. But what we have to do is enter into a faith to believe that &gt;&gt; and to start confessing it and start walking it. You know what the problem is, James? You know what the problem is with a lot of people? They hear the word of God and they agree with the word of God, but they don't keep it in their memory. They forget about it and then they they don't get stronger. And the Bible says, uh, let's pull this up. 1 Corinthians 15 real quick. 1 Corinthians 15, verse 1. Let's put that and see what that says. It's important that you remember the word of God. Moreover, brethren, I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you, which also you are saved, and wherein ye stand. Verse two, by which also you are saved, if you keep in memory what I preached unto you, unless you have believed in vain. So God gives us the word. We're more than overcomers. &gt;&gt; So when the devil comes and he gives this thought, I can't do this, I can't live this, I can't overcome, I can't stop lying, I can't, you just put that aside. I am God's DNA. I'm a part of God and I'm keeping it in my memory. All right. Verse 35 of Romans chapter 8. Verse 35. Now remember, we're talking about God's DNA, the firstborn among many brethren. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Why is this so important? Because God is love. God is love. So the DNA of God is love. Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness, peril, or sword? All as it is written, for thy sake we are killed all the day long. We are counted as sheep uh for the slaughter. We we we we just, you know, trials are going to be in our life. There's nothing we can do about it. But in all these things, we're more than conquerors through Christ that loved us. Now look at the confession here. For I am persuaded that neither death, life, angels, principalities, powers, nor things present, nor things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our Lord. Now, why is that? Because you have the same love of God inside of your genes, your spiritual genes. How can you be separated from the love of God when it's inside of you? That's why the prophet could say nothing will enter in there except perfect love. Those are sons and daughters of God in heaven. They got the same DNA. They got a new birth. They weren't a bunch of um uh uh mate believers that went to church that said they're born again and they didn't take time to check their nature to see if it was changing to be more like Jesus. I'm not trying to be strong and hard here, but you know, there's a devil out there that wants to trick a lot of people. &gt;&gt; And I'm really mad at him. I'm not mad at any any human. No, no, you're my friends. Amen. First, okay, one last set of scriptures if I could. It's going to be first John chapter 4 speaking on this love of God. God is love. The gene of God. That would be a good message right there. The gene of God's love. Amen. First John chapter 4:7. Beloved, let us love one another. For love is of God. And everyone that is born of God. Uh and everyone that loveth, he's actually born of God. &gt;&gt; And he knows God. So if in your heart you're feeling this I love I love everybody. I just want to lay down my life. I want to get Christ to I want to be willing to suffer to help somebody. This is the manifestation that you actually know God because God is love and he that loveth he knows God. That's what the scripture is telling us here. &gt;&gt; Why? because it's the same DNA that God has. It's inside of you. That's why Jesus could say, "Make sure that you love one another as I have loved you." In other words, I've loved you unconditionally. It doesn't mean you have to hang out be and partake of their nonsense, but it does mean that you're willing to turn the cheek, go the second mile. You you you'll take the word of God and you'll live the word of God. Oh, I just love the word. Verse eight, he that loveth not, he doesn't know God. Think about that. He that loveth not knoweth not God, for God is love. It's not the same DNA if you're not loving. If you're having a hard time loving, I'll say you you need to get to the altar. You need to get serious with God. You need to call on God. You need to get a dose of the Holy Ghost because there's nothing else that's going to change you. I can't change you. I could live my, you know, God could take me and make your personal servant the rest of your life and that would never change you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got to get God on the inside of you. That's right. &gt;&gt; We might have the knowledge of God, but it's not the same DNA if we are not loving like God loves. Verse nine, in this was manifested the love of God towards us. So God manifested his love towards us because that God sent his only begotten son into the world that we might live through him. Calvary made it possible for his DNA to come back upon us right through a blood transfusion. And that happens as the word is being preached to you. You say, "Yes, Lord. I'll do it." &gt;&gt; And I'm telling you, spiritual DNA comes right inside your being. I mean, think about it. I there was a time that I literally smoked. I smoked different stuff. But I got a blood transfusion. &gt;&gt; And it changed my DNA. &gt;&gt; I don't have any more desire for it anymore. &gt;&gt; I used to drink. I haven't drank since then. I haven't smoked since then. And the same thing can happen. You can love everybody. You just got to receive the DNA of God. &gt;&gt; We are changed from glory unto glor. You know, you you can you can take your time and grow. You get serious and grow fast. I I I'll say we're running out of time to get ready. God is not stopping for anybody. He's moving forward. Verse 10. Here in his love, here in is love. Not that we loved God. No, but that he loved us and he sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins. Beloved, if God so loved us and we got the same gene as God, then we also ought to love one another. Have you ever sat around and wondered waiting for somebody who claims to be a Christian to come and love you? We need to love one another as Christ has loved us. I believe there's I honestly believe there's nothing to make God more happier because I believe this is walking in the truth. Let me just say this. When we can love one another the way that God loves us. I believe this is the truth he wants us to walk in. Beloved, if God so loved us, we ought to also love one another. No man has seen God at this time. So it's not knowing God after the flesh, right? If we love one another, God dwelleth in us and his love is perfected in us. Oh, that's beautiful. It's not a physical relationship. It's you receive in the spirit of Christ, the spirit of the word into your heart and you literally just go and you love one another. You want to share Christ with others. You want to bring others to the truth. You want to you want to spend time working with the kingdom of God rather than your own kingdom. And hereby know we that we dwelleth in him and he in us because he have given us his spirit. And we have seen and do testify that the father sent the son to be the savior of the world. said, "Whosoever shall confess that Jesus is the son of God, God dwelleth in him, and he it and he in God." Now, think about this. You confess with your life, right? Not your mouth. Your life has got to confess it. You love one another as Christ has loved you. And we have known and believe that the love that God have sent us, God is love. And he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in God, and God in him, and here in is our love, it's made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment. Because as he is, so are we in the world. So it does not yet appear. But we know that when he shall appear, we shall be like him, for we shall see him as he is. So we have the gene of God. Even though we're having a hard time and we're struggling, let's say we're struggling, really loving. All you got to do is give your heart on the altar. Get serious about God. Change my heart, oh God. God make it ever true. That's all we need. God cannot, you know, put a a headlock on you on your on your will. You either going to want to be like him more than you want to be like you are. And and when you just say, "Lord, help me. I surrender all. God will bless you. All right. Verse 18. Are we in verse 18? There is no fear in love, but perfect love casteth out fear because fear of torment. And he that fearth is not made perfect. We love him because he first loved us. If any man say, "I love God, he hates his brother." What's the DNA say? The DNA test says he's a liar. For he that loveth not his brother whom may have seen, how can he love God who may not seen? And this commandment have we of him that he who loveth God loveth his brother also. Amen. Let's stand together. The voice of our spiritual DNA. I want to be like Jesus. to be like Jesus. Let's sing. Without him, I could do nothing. If you love the word, make love to the word. Without him, I could do nothing. [Music] Without him, I'd surely fail. Without him, I would be drifting like a ship without a sail. [Music] Jesus. Oh Jesus, do you know him today? Please don't turn him away. Jesus. Oh Jesus. Without him how lost I would be. [Music] Without him, I would be dying. Without him, I'd be enslaved. Without him, life would be hopeless. But with Jesus, thank God, I'm saved. Jesus. Oh Jesus. Think about it. Do you know him today? Please don't turn him away. Jesus. Oh Jesus. Without him how lost I would be. It is no secret. It is no secret. It's the same DNA. Amen. It is no secret what God can do. What he's done for others, he'll do for you. Lord, I want that. With arms wide open, [Music] he'll pardon you. It is no secret what God can do. It is no secret what God can do. What he's done for others, he'll do for you. [Music] With arms wide open, [Applause] he'll pardon you. It is no secret what God can do. Let's believe it now. It is no secret what God can do. What he's done for others, he'll do for you. With arms wide open, he'll pardon you. It is no secret what God can do. Amen. continue to play that if you would. It is no secret what God can do. I believe that all of us here want God to do something for us. And what we want him to do for us, he's already done for somebody else. It is no secret. He has that DNA. He wants to give it to you. He wants you to be just like him. With every head bowed, every eye closed. Maybe there'd be someone here today says, "Brother John, I'm serious with the word that's been preached today. It has pricricked my heart, and I want to be more like him." Brother John, would you pray for me that I'll become just like Jesus? Amen. God sees your hand. He sees the sincerity of your heart. Now, I'm just going to ask you today to believe. To believe with all that's within you. Believe. Brother Brandham said, "It's just a simple faith. It's you walking out and not forgetting that you raised your hand today and that you're going to leave here determined to manifest Christ." because I believe what that's what this message was all about this morning. And if you can just believe it, all things are possible. Amen. Our heavenly father, thank you for your DNA today. Thank you that you want to give us the Holy Ghost more than we want it. Thank you that you want to reveal your word to us, Lord, just as humble babes that desire the sincere milk of the word. God, we want to become the word. We want to become like you. We want to be overcomers. We want to shine in this dark world. We want to be delivered from the things that we need deliverance from. We want about to look in the mirror and see Jesus. We want about to look in the mirror and say, "One day, I'm going to be just like you, Jesus. I'm going to walk. I'm going to talk." And Lord, we all want to take time right now to thank you for the things that you have delivered us from. Thank you for delivering us from smoking, from drinking, from cussing, from swearing. Thank you for delivering us from anger, from those terrible habits, Lord, the terrible habit of hating our brothers and our sisters. Lord, thank you for the mighty deliverance. Thank you for bringing us out of Egypt. Thank you for bringing us through the Red Sea. Thank you, Lord, for forgiving us for murmuring or complaining. Lord, thank you. Thank you with all of our heart. And now, Lord, we're looking onto you. Not just the author, but the finisher of our faith. Lord, you had joy set before you endured the cross. And now, Lord, we have that same joy in our heart to be like you. That one day we're going to wake up. And Job said, "I'll not be satisfied to awake in your likeness." Job's our brother, Lord, and we want to awake in your likeness because we got the same DNA. We know we're in this past house, but there's a power of the Holy Spirit that can change our lives, Lord. And that's what we're believing on today. We're believing for more of you, Lord Jesus. God, may you fill us with more of your Holy Spirit today. Fill us to overflowing, Lord. Fill us till we, Lord, till we our cup runth over. We're acting like you. We're thinking like you. We're loving one another. Grant it, Lord. Receive receive our prayer. Receive our our hearts, Lord, as we lay ourselves on the altar today with this prayer. We trust you. Give you the glory and honor for it. As we commit our lives into your hands now for more of you, we pray these things in Jesus Christ's precious name. Amen. And amen. Just sing it now. More more of him. Of you. Oh, more of you. I've had it all. But what I need is just more of you. Of things I've had my fill. And yet I hunger still empty and bare. Lord hear our prayer for
