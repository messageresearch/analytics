you come and uh at this time and and give us revelation of your word we'd be so grateful lord for this that we would receive the most important thing the thing that you said you're building your church on and that's revelation we humbly pray for it today bless your people and meet all the needs amongst us we give you the praise now for these things in jesus precious name amen amen going to read one scripture while you're standing and then we'll have you be seated i want to show some some pictures of uh in the philippines but we're gonna turn to deuteronomy chapter 30 and read just one verse there that's verse number 19. the scripture reads i call to heaven and earth i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live man god bless you you may be seated we're entitling this message the power of choice the power of choice and for a subject choosing life but before we get into uh these scriptures um i just wanted to show some pictures that came to us from sister chi-chi as you know brother rowell had passed away and she's kind of been uh filling in until the the pastor gets settled right now he's really concentrating on the church and and not as much on missions but her sister is in contact with the believers there and brother jackie benton has been a tremendous help in giving thousands of dollars to help with this but our our church did as well and they just wanted to go through these pictures kind of quick this is when the typhoon came and just destroyed many houses and as you can see uh they're they're not much of a house to start with and so when the storm comes it can really do a lot of damage and here you see they're starting to build with the money that you gave and the the and through your prayers that you prayed for when you were praying for the needs in the philippines and these are just a number of families and a number of pastors um were affected and uh you know brother our brother mark was just talking about our church and the blessings that we have and you know the the homes that we live in the these um these these uh precious people our brothers and sisters in christ don't have you know what we have and the least we could do is you know pray for them and and hold them up in prayer and just just help the the best that we can remember when jesus was talking he said what you've done to the least of these little ones you've done it unto me and and and we they're very important amen amen praise the lord so let's continue to hold up the the saints in the philippines who will be affected for for quite some time and yes and the in in ukraine that the great needs that are uh for the believers there and well we just have to pray for one another and i'll say it like this we can't stop the end from coming the best thing we could do is number one make sure we're ready number two get a soul in because nothing else after that that matters i'd like to go ahead and just start with this chapter 30 if you would like to read with me starting with verse number one of deuteronomy chapter 30 and it shall come to pass when all these things are come upon thee the blessings and the blessing and the curse which i have set before thee and thou shalt call them to mine among all the nations whether the lord thy god have driven thee and shall return unto the lord thy god and shall obey his voice according to all that i command thee this day thou and thy children with all thy heart and with all thy soul that then the lord thy god will turn thee turn thy captivity and have compassion upon thee and will return and gather thee from all the nations whether the lord thy god have scattered thee if if any of thine be driven out unto the uttermost parts of heaven from hence will the lord thy god gather thee from the thence will he fetch thee and the lord thy god will bring thee into the land which thy fathers possess and thou shalt possess it and he would do the good and multiply thee above thy fathers and the lord thy god will circumcise thy heart and the heart of thy seed what and what will be circumcised too to love the lord thy god with all that heart with all they sow with all thy that thou mayest live so we were born with just a terrible nature even though everybody that we liked being around told us we were good but we know our nature was was corrupt and when we come to church we come to church we want to be circumcised right we and and there needs to be nothing left in our life but just a love for god and the lord thy god will put all these curses upon thine enemies and on them that hate thee which persecute thee and thou shall return and obey the voice of the lord and do all his commandments which i command thee this day and the lord thy god will make thee plenteous in every work of thine hand and in the fruit of the body and the fruit of thy cattle and in the fruit of thy land for good for the lord will again rejoice over thee for good as as he rejoiced over our father so you know the children of israel went through a terrible terrible time in the wilderness and now he's he's he's trying to give them uh warnings and tell them well first blessings of what he'll do if they follow in them and then a warning if they don't verse 10 if thou shall hearken unto the voice of the lord thy god to keep his commandments and his statutes which are written in the book of the law and if thou turn unto the lord thy god with all their heart and with all thy soul so we've got to give god everything we just we can't we got to get away from any thinking that god only needs just a part of us and we can move forward with god it just it does doesn't work for this commandment which i command thee this day it is not hidden from thee neither is it far off it is not in heaven that thou should say who shall go up for us into heaven and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it neither is it beyond the sea that thou should say who shall go over the sea for us and bring it unto us that we may hear it and do it but the word is very nigh unto thee in thy mouth and in thy heart that thou mayest do it always about obeying so i have set before thee this day life and good death and evil and that i command thee this day to love the lord thy god to walk in his ways and to keep his commandments and his statutes and his judgments that thou mayest live and multiply and the lord thy god shall bless you in the land whether thou whether thou goest to possess it but if thine heart turn away so that thou will not hear but shall be drawn away and worship other gods and and serve them i denounce unto you this day that he shall surely perish and that ye shall not prolong your days upon the land whether thou passes over jordan to go possess it i call to heaven i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i have set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live it's for our children amen thou that one more verse that thou mayest love the lord thy god and that thou mayest obey his voice and that thou mayest cleave unto him for he is thy life and the length of thy days that thou mayest dwell in the land which the lord swear unto thy fathers to abraham to isaac to jacob to give to them it's so powerful that god has god gave them the land just gave it to them amen they didn't really have to do anything in their own ability except trust god to believe and that god would take care of it now part of possessing the land is obeying the word of god it's so tied in here in the old testament we could say we cannot possess the promised land unless we obey the bible says he gives the holy ghost to them that obeys him so this is is really really important i want to talk about the power of choice today choice can seem insignificant with a carnal mind or a natural mind that is looking at predestination right if we're if we're predestinated what is there to choose and i'm just going to give some scriptures to kind of help fortify that thought right now and it's ephesians 1 5. we have been predestinated to be adopted into god's family to fulfill the pleasure of god's will now you write that down another one is a ephesians 1 verse 11 we are predestined to fulfill god's purpose who worketh who worketh everything after the council of his own will so we see that we've been predestined to to adoption to be in god's family and to fulfill his purpose so so what does the power of choice have to do with us but during peter's sermon on the day of pentecost acts 20 acts 2 verse 22 he's speaking here and he says she men of israel hear these words jesus of nazareth the man approved of god among you by miracles and wonders and signs which god did by him in the midst of you as you know as you as ye yourselves also know him being delivered by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of god you have taken him and by wicked hands have crucified and slained well peter has a revelation now it was the determined counsel and foreknowledge of god that this was even going to happen the bible tells us that jesus christ was actually crucified before the foundation of the world but yet he still had to surrender his will peter can say i i know i know this now because jesus he kept telling us that he was going to be slain even i resisted it and and fought it the bible says here by the determined counsel that means the marking out of god's purpose and the foreknowledge is just simply the forethought god could god knows what's going to happen before it happens and so these things were predestinated jesus was predestined to fulfill god's will but it could not happen unless it came to the power of choice and free more agency this is so important for us to understand to get a better balance in predestination first peter chapter one verse two the bible says we're the elect according to foreknowledge of god the father through sanctification of the spirit and unto obedience and the sprinkling of the of the blood of jesus christ grace unto you and peace be multiplied now notice we're elect to the foreknowledge of god but how does it happen it happens through sanctification in other words you repent you become sanctified the blood of jesus christ cleanses you it's through the power of choice i choose to walk in obedience to god's will that the life that i'm living the things that i'm doing i need to circumcise my heart it's through this process that the elect become who they are satan would love nothing better for us just to believe we're predestined and do nothing it's a deception our choices have everything to do where we're going to end up there's more to the power of our choices than what we realize even though we've been predestinated eternal life we still have to choose life we have to choose and it's not just a one-shot deal when we get baptized or we we first come to the lord amen now god is not a manipulator he's not a dictator even though his kingdom is not ruled by democracy he's still not a manipulator he doesn't manipulate his will upon us god is created within each one of us free will it's an agency that is controlled by our choice or the choice of the individual it's not his doesn't control our will how many times have you wished your children would just listen to you it is my will that you listen but they have their own will it's no different with us and god the angels were created with free will i've often said this that god doesn't have any robots in heaven just those who would love him enough to choose to be there look at jude chapter 1 verse 5 it says i will therefore put you in remembrance though ye once knew this that how that the lord having saved the people of the land of egypt afterwards he destroyed them that believed not they they had a choice they chose not to believe that's why he destroyed them they did not choose life they did not choose the words of life they did not choose the tree of life what did their free will choose they chose the tree of knowledge and that tree of knowledge will always give you reasoning why you don't have to obey the word but it will always bring forth death in our lives now to them it was a natural death that it brought well jesus did say that they were eternally separated but to us we have to understand there's a spiritual death around it comes from partaking of the wrong tree amen verse six and the angels look at this even the angels which kept not their first estate but left their own inhabitation he have reserved them in everlasting chains under darkness unto the judgment of the great day why didn't they choose to stay with the other angels why did these angels leave god gave them free will to do what they wanted to do lucifer deceived his third of the angels to exercise their will above god's will and we're born with a nature that we're not even taught that by our parents in fact when our parents tell us to do something we actually want to do what we want to do so we were born unfortunately with this nature that is just like the nature that satan has makes it hard for us to make the right decisions when our whole flesh is just lusting after the wrong things they had power to choose but did not have character to choose the right thing that's right brother brahm said power without character is satanic they had power lucifer had power he convinced angels i see brother mark he's up here what is he doing he's trying to create an atmosphere and convince us all to enter into worship and worship the lord of lords and king of kings that's power with character amen amen now getting up here and and and creating an environment to say look at me is power without character and elvis presley had great ability but i can listen to those blue suede shoes and all those songs and they don't feel jesus god gives power to choose other than his will our choices are not necessarily always right are they but he gives us that ability god's kingdom is not manipulated it's love-driven it's i wanna be there the only people are going to be in heaven are those that want to be there and those are the ones that are predestinated they're going to want to be there so bad that they're willing to give up their will that's why brother brahms could say nothing but perfect love would enter in there man has got to fall in love with god so much that man would deny that satanic nature of his own will to go after what it wants to go after [Music] on if i had a dollar for every time my flesh wanted something different than god's will from the time that i got baptized i could buy all the houses on this street it's it's a nature it's still there if it wasn't going to be there jesus would never say you got to deny your flesh daily but there's a purpose you got to and i think every day you do it we look at oh man oh man but god's saying they're going to show me they love me they're showing me their love me today it's the only way we can do it it's an honor amen primal agency is exercised throughout god's kingdom right in other words all the angels the seraphims and the cherubians they all have a choice and they're choosing to do what they want to do do you ever think about that i mean i know when i used to think about heaven i would think about oh we he created these little robots to always say holy holy holy not soul i just i when i look at the character of god i don't think i see god making anybody do anything if he was like that he would have just annihilated lucifer and all the angels right off the bat he'll use them for his glory he is using the devil for his glory yes now the bible tells us that we're saved by grace through faith it's through the choice of believing that god truly provided a way for us see it's free more agency there's enough grace to save the world there's enough blood to cover the world but if you don't believe it it won't do you any good you've got to choose to believe and there's power in choices in our choices god is set before everyone life and death blessing and cursing and he says therefore choose life that both now and thy seed may love you've got to choose it don't rely on predestination friend i'll tell you that has got us in more trouble than it's ever helped us i'm not saying that there's hasn't been times we've been down in the dumps and we and we just you know god spoke no matter what you're predestined i'm not saying that doesn't happen but the devil uses it a billion times more to get us to not do anything that we should be doing right it's not a very popular opinion or statement but it's what i believe there's a reason brother branham said to stay away from it and of course you see i don't stay away from it but i am trying to bring us an understanding and a balance so we never have to be afraid and we and we don't get tricked by the devil now moses here he wasn't sharing his opinion with the believers right he wasn't this was a a life and death situation brother branham said when sometimes he would he would read just one verse of scriptures and he would say now you don't think there's much to what i just read but he said there's enough power in that one little bit of scripture to uh put you in heaven or condemn you in hell just through the power of choicing choosing to believe it or not amen and so here it was moses it was a life-and-death situation for the children of israel and moses called to every moment in time to just stop everything in heaven just pay attention to what's going to be happening here right now wow it was serious i call heaven and earth to record this day against you in other words i have set before you life and death it's a frimo agency you choose which way you want to go blessings are cursing he says therefore choose life god has always got his hand reached out saying choose life that both thou and thy seed may live it was really no different at the beginning of the creation of god in in genesis chapter 2. if you want to turn with me there god had put man in the middle of choice from the very beginning and the reason for this and this is an important reason that you understand it because we're in it today is because god wanted man to choose to serve him above everything else and there's nothing more powerful than the devil outside of god there's nothing more powerful outside of god than the devil think about it the devil has deceived the whole world he deceived us why is it all of our family and all of our loved ones and all of our friends and everybody we talk to why aren't they saved because of the power of the devil he deceiveth the whole world the bible says he's blinded the minds of them that believe now who choose not to believe the word is true he's powerful he trips us up all the time genesis 2 verse 8 and the lord god planted a garden east eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil verse 15 and the lord god took the man and he put a ray in the middle of the garden to address it to keep it uh like this god had given man a responsibility even before he fell right through to work and to guard god's creation before it fell after he fell he had to work harder he had to sweat more but he still created him and gave him a job there was no welfare but that wasn't the only responsibility that he gave man he also gave him the responsibility of keeping his commandments excuse me you know how often i take water excuse me somehow we got to erase it off the tape and verse 16 and the lord god commanded the men saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the garden of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shall surely die so here god naturally puts all sorts of natural trees in the garden and he tells adam you can just eat of every one of those they're all good for you because everything that god created was good even when he created lucifer in the beginning he was perfect and i i believe everything that god ever created was was perfect god just doesn't do halfway jobs and so whatever choice you make for your body to eat it's going to be good for you but spiritually you can only eat of one tree because he was a uh he was a triune being he could only eat of the tree of life there's only one tree one will one way that will ever be good for us and that's the way of christ amen jesus christ was this tree in the garden jesus himself said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that cometh forth from the tree of life he said my words are spirit and they are life jesus was that spiritual tree in the garden and that was all that they were allowed to eat from that's all they needed god had allowed another tree in the garden the tree of knowledge of good and evil and choosing to partake of that tree instead of life would have brought forth death it did bring forth death and today that tree is sitting here in church it's here it's in your home it's on the radio station it's at mcdonald's when you go there it's at tim hortons that says starbucks that tree of knowledge of good and evil it's everywhere it's in the midst of our lives but so is the tree of life now why would a a perfect god who had a perfect eden with a man in his own image put him in the midst of a mixed tree that was bad for you god put the tree of knowledge there in the garden for the purpose of proving the power of love proving the power of love and it's not just one way it's two ways wrong choices had to be made in the garden in order to prove or manifest the power of love if that would have never happened god would have never been able to say for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son it proved his love that tree had to be there and man had a fall that he could prove his love to mankind but remember it was through the power of god's choice through his free will that he he saved man everything in heaven is free moral agency it's choice this is important because if we get a real revelation of this we'll make better choices for our life we really will at the beginning man was commanded to not partake of the mixed tree in the middle jesus commanded them unless you partake of me the tree the bread of life drink of this water you have no life in you and then at the end in the last chapter he said whosoever will let him take of the water of life freely whosoever will the power of choice just trying to lay a foundation hope you're staying with me there's no greater manifestation or evidence of god's love than a man lay down his life for his friends nothing can prove any greater love in fact he wanted to say by proving this or manifesting this love shall all men know that you've been partaking of the tree of life that you're my disciples that you're you're you're doing the right thing in the message straight is the gate brother branham says you see when abraham was sitting under his tent because he had made a choice and that choice is brought before every person that's born in this world the tree of good and evil is set before every person and when lot his nephew and their herdsmen began to argue about the grounds abraham being a just man said to them let there be no arguments among us you choose your way of going the place comes to every believer's life and it's before you this morning and it's before me lot didn't think that he was going to backslide this is important when the devil tricks us into taking the easier way we think we got it handled we've got this temptation handled we think we can still stay with god remember that lot didn't think that he was going to backslide but he went but he went to looking towards sodom where things were easy and there's many times we look towards the easy way well i'll just uh join this certain certain church and and you see nobody will say anything against it because it's the biggest church in the city the easy way he says many times we do that when we're wrong remember if you follow christ you'll be hated by people for all that live godly in christ jesus shall suffer persecutions and if you come to christ you'll not come by any church or denomination or creed you'll come by the blood that's the only avenue in you cannot bring no one with you you come alone and you stand on your own confession and your own faith you'll not ride in on on the pastor or your mother's faith you'll come as an individual when you come to god and many times we make those foolish choices tree of good and evil is set before every person and god forces us to make a choice just like he did adam and eve it was no different we must make a choice we have the choice to either partake of the tree of life or look for the easy way and partake of the tree of good and evil now this tree of knowledge of good and evil it's a mixed tree i've tried to describe it as i could many times it has good and evil in the tree because if any of us would go to do good we've got to know it first hey if i'm going to help somebody if i'm going to pray for somebody if i'm going to lay down my life for somebody if i'm going to do something for somebody i've got to know it's the right thing to do but the knowledge of that without doing it is a mixed tree and when we know to do good but we're choosing not to do it we've got to understand that's not the tree of life that's the tree of knowledge that we're in the midst of right amen amen well what doesn't the bible says he that's a hearer of the word and not a doer deceiveth his own self it's a mixed tree it's right here it just wasn't in the garden it's when i'm driving down the road and the devil says it doesn't matter when the lord says you didn't pray today and you say i'll get it tomorrow what are you doing telling your father you don't have to do what he asks you to do it's a mixed tree and we got to see that satan we got to uncover satan that's what we got to do deuteronomy 6 5 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might and these words which i command you this this day shall be in thine heart now this is you know we we could all sit here and intellectually say well none of us you know really love god that much but we just do our best to you know kind of press towards that's all we can do why in the world is it even written in the word we've got to hold ourselves accountable if we don't press into this image and expect god to take us merely on the blood but not on our choice amen on our choice not to circumcise our life anymore to to sanctify and to walk in the commandments of the lord we seen this what happened in the garden it having this tree in our midst now we have a chance to prove to god like he proved to us our love for him like he proved his love for us and brother branham talk about this is the only life that will have to really uh uh to to to to work for the lord and improve our our love for him in the in this in this some i'm paraphrasing that a little bit but listen when we get up in heaven there's not going to be any tears right no more crying it's going to be a eternally bliss so this is the the chance where we can turn away the the the the flesh that doesn't want to worship that doesn't want to serve that wasn't doesn't want to pray doesn't want to press it doesn't want to reach out we have a chance to say god i love you more than that today amen in the message time tested memorials of god brother brahm says you see a man's character is made known by his works and we're talking about proving whatever you are your works prove what you are no matter how much you testify whatever you say pro con that has nothing to do with it your works tell what you are tell us what's every job that you do manifests what you are and you businessman that would probably be like brother roger and i you businessman if you just do a patch up job see what i mean just a halfway job he says don't do that if you can't do it right don't do it at all i suppose brother jonathan he's a businessman too he's got a business brother says when you come to christ if you can't absolutely sell out lock stock and barrel and come to christ he says don't even come at all so we've got to believe the scripture love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all this soul with all they might or don't come at all jesus said i'd rather have you cold you don't want to get hot on fire for me i'd rather have you cold then don't be lukewarm but when you really want to be a christian stand out make it real that's what god wants you to be and that will prove your works will prove what your character is and your character is known by the works that you do see god is wanting us to prove our love for him i've set before thee life and death blessings and cursings therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live choose to love the lord thy god with all your heart choose to sell out lock stock and barrel because it don't happen because we're predestinated and you know how is god going to give you a revelation that your predestinated but he won't give you one to live for him he won't give you one to to die out daily he won't give you one to to keep all his commandments that's why it's a dangerous thought i'd rather hold myself accountable to this than just say i will not be moved i'm predestinated i won't be moved so much i don't even move for god you understand what i'm saying i know it's awful quiet and i'm not getting a lot of amens god has proven his love for us and now he wants us to prove our love for him amen every single day every opportunity amen what's amazing to me is even though the devil is more powerful than any human being if man through freemore agency chooses christ the word nothing can stand before him the power of a choice when you choose life not even the devil can get in your way that's why brother branham could say the the weakest christian when he's on his knees it makes the devil tremble if all you're doing is outside of christ and you're trying to do something you are an easy target for the devil you've got to choose christ not just choose that the devil's bad and i don't want the devil in my life and get him out of my home i'm sorry that only works so long after a while god's going to say you prove to me you prove to me that you're not serving other god you prove to me that you're taking my commandments [Music] he wants proof now we've all come short of the glory of god and i'll say it like this praise god for the blood it's all behind us but you know we make mistakes every day because we're in the middle because that tree is right there that's why we're making the that's why we take our eyes off of jesus right if we if we had more love we kept our eyes on jesus keep working for the lord think we wouldn't make as many mistakes don't you think that's a true statement well god that's what god is looking at god is looking for us to put forth the effort in our choices every day not stand behind some some message that says oh yeah i believe brother brown is a prophet he was a messenger for the hour and i believe the message that doesn't do anything brother friend himself says your works will prove what character you are and in what you say it's what you live and god is calling us to choose to live more for him choose to put him first choose to love them with all of our choose to give them more of our will the only one that can keep us out of heaven is us the only one that can keep us from our healing from our deliverance is us our unbelief we have to we must choose to believe all things are possible to those who choose to believe the word amen if you say to this mountain right don't expect somebody else to move it out of your life we're not babies anymore whatever you say in my name amen in my name you shall cast out every devil in your life i want to i'll tell you if there's ever a devil that i want i gone i want it gone for me so i can think straight live straight love god with everything hallelujah god wants us to take him at his word and to prove him yes it's all about relationship amen jesus has never failed his word has never failed he cannot lie his word will not return void he wants us to prove them if we're questioning approval malachi 3 10. we're not really talking about uh giving money in church right now but i just want to bring this to scripture bring ye all your tithes into the storehouse that there may be meat in my house and prove me now look at this and prove me now herewith saith the lord of hosts if i will not open you the windows of heaven and pour out a blessing that there shall not be room enough to receive it no one no one will be able to stand before god in heaven and say you did not follow your word you did not keep your word amen i believe the word amen take him at his word he's a rewarder to them that diligently seek him don't expect god to bless part-time seeking right part-time giving part-time faithfulness hey we gotta love them with everything we got it doesn't come with time you know a lot of believers are afraid to take god at his word they're afraid they're scared i don't want to give this up this is all i got ii timothy chapter 1 verse 7. drop these in at the end here for god have not given us the spirit of fear can you say amen cast them out but he's given us the spirit of power of love and a sound mind there's no confusion when you've got a sound mind that was kicked out but fear just brings confusion and i don't know what's going on that's the devil in your mind that's a that's a tree of knowledge of good and evil it's a mixed tree you got to kick it out all you've got to say is what this is not from god i'm an heir of god join heirs with christ he's given me love he's given me power he's giving me a sound mind and i'm standing on i'm making the choice get out first john chapter 4 verse 18. this is why fear so bad there is no fear in love but perfect love it casts out fear you know the more your love is perfect for christ the more you'll be able to cast out every lie in your life everything that comes to you and tries to bother you i love this there's no fear in love because perfect love cast out fear because fear hath torment and he that feareth is not made perfect in love amen we need more love that's the answer fall in love with jesus fall in love i love you jesus fill me with your love come on lord don't wait to the feelings there just start cultivating that love he's already did his part right how many you know he's not going to go to the cross for us every day once but his mercies are new each day he showers blessings upon us he's blessing us all the time we're just ignoring we don't look up to see where the apples are coming from right we got to take the time amen to worship god to thank him for the little things to thank him for the medium things to think of what he's doing for our brothers our sisters and all the things that before you know it the whole day's gone by and all you've done is thank the lord and i'll tell you'll be the happiest person in the world devil says man i gotta get out of here i gotta get out i can't stand this much talk about god in this message of expectation brother brandon said and there's only two elements in the world that controls the world tonight he said that's fear and faith russia is trying to do is russia is trying to get everybody to fear them and we're trying to get everybody to have faith in god he said now that's the difference the two elements control all nations it controls all people it controls all churches it controls all individuals is fear or faith you as much as we don't want to be bothered the only way fear is going to leave us is if we take a stand against it amen just fall in love with god and cast it out he says now fear has no valid valuation in it none whatsoever it's a perfectly endless it doesn't have one good thing about it brother brandon says if i was to be shot in the morning was going to be shot he said what good would it do to have fear it would do me no good at all you say well what good would faith do you brother branham says well faith could deliver me but fear won't help me a bit you just get yourself all worked up and all nervous and then when it comes time for the gun to fire he says so let's have faith faith could deliver you from that but if it doesn't what good would fear do anyhow just stay right with faith and hold on to it take god's promise and remind and remain with god remain with the word remain with the promise when we got this bible to look back at the the three hebrew children and and uh the fiery furnace and the daniel and the lion's den and everything that everybody went through god's a god of the last minute god will take us to the very end but the further he takes you the greater the glory when he delivers you he's a god of the last minute of course we wanted god to hey take care of this right now right now i don't want to go through you know put your faith in god stand the promise i just want to go back to first john chapter 4 and start at verse 16 and read through verse 20 if i could and when and we have known and believe the love that god has towards us god is love and he that dwelleth in love is actually dwelling in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world well he was perfect love you want to have boldness on the day of judgment perfect love fear fear fear will not be able to to give you any kind of boldness on the day of judgment there's no fear and love but perfect love casts out fear because fear have torment and he that feareth is not made perfect we love him we love him all because he first loved us he came into our heart he he saved us he showed us that he loved us and he filled us with himself giving us the ability to love him back with the same love he does it i you know as much as i i love sophie it's an animal we love our dogs we do awful quiet you're not going to stay with me that's fine i'll stand alone i'm used to it yes pastor's got to do that stuff but you know that love can't be compared that you have for your family it just can't be god doesn't want any dogs in heaven he wants somebody that he can love and that will love him back the same way amen are you with me now i do believe that there'll be dogs in heaven but you know what i'm saying god there there's really not a whole lot of scripture in the bible that talks in those lines of god wanting all those claiming predestinating but we are joiners with him of a special relationship and it's all based on love are you with me all right oh let me finish that verse 20. if a man say i love god and hate his brother he's a liar for he that loveth not his brother whom he have seen how can he love god who is not whom he have not seen love doesn't stop with god love is just for everybody the love of god is without respect to persons it just loves enemies whatever just love love love now we can't just say we believe we've got to believe with all of our heart and god is going to prove us to see if we believe or not now he's allowed the tree of knowledge of good and evil in our life and it ain't going anywhere you can put the thing at bay and just keep eating of the tree of life keep eating on the word keep listening to tapes keep obeying his word do the work of the lord always abounding in the work of the lord and that tree will stay at bay or you can say it not a big deal to me it's always going to be there and pretty soon that tree is going to trick you come on now here in exodus chapter 16 verse 3 the children of israel were choosing they made a choice to murmur against moses and really it was against god and the ministry he says and the children of israel said unto them would to god that we had died by the hand of the lord in the land of egypt can you imagine after they came out of egypt and they were dancing and everything he says but when we sat by the flesh pots and when we did eat bread to fo to the full for ye have brought us forth into this wilderness what kind of leader are you to kill this whole assembly with hunger then said the lord amen then said the lord unto moses behold i will reign bread from heaven for you and the people shall go out and gather a certain rate every day that i may prove them proven what whether they will walk in my law or no what does god god has done so much for me if he never did another thing and i lived for 30 years and it was totally miserable for my life i could never deny that god has not loved me and proven to me his great faithfulness to me he don't owe me anything amen today god consistently shows his faithfulness and love to us we must take the choice to prove that we love him back and it's hard deuteronomy 8 verse 1 all the commandments which i command you this day shall ye observe to do and that ye may live and multiply and go and possess the land which the lord swear unto your fathers and thou shalt remember all the way which the lord thy god led thee these forty years in the wilderness to what to humble thee yes why did they have to suffer like there's a little key right here to humble thee and to prove thee and to know what was in thine heart when thou wouldest keep whether thou wouldst keep his commandments or no we just you know god knows everything but he wants it approved choice jesus said if you love me keep my commandments prove it can i have just a little bit of time okay god has proven his great love for us to degree i'll i don't feel i'll ever comprehend god's love i i was a sinner which totally didn't even have god in my mind and i'd get little thoughts and then i'd get scared and even after i got saved i can't hardly look at one day in my life and feel that i haven't let them down so that might be my testimony my testimony alone but i'm sticking with so i'll never about to comprehend god having mercy on me every day god loving me every day deuteronomy chapter 7 verse 7 says the lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any people for you were the fewest of all people but because the lord loved you solid end of story don't try to figure it out god loved you that's why he is what he is in your life that's why he's calling you to heaven he just loves you and that's what you need to focus on towards him just love him just focus on it don't sit there and try to judge i've done enough i've gone to church i've read today i prayed today i've done this just fall in love and keep it going keep it pouring out why do you serve god i love him i love him because he first loved me and because he would keep the oath which he sworn unto your fathers have the lord brought you out of the mighty with a mighty hand and redeemed you out of the house of bondmen from the hand of pharaoh king of egypt know therefore that the lord thy god he is god the faithful god which keepeth covenant and mercy with them who not everybody with them that love him and keep his commandments even to 2000 or 2022 to a thousand generations he will keep his covenant and his mercy with us if we love him and then keep his commandments this is why it's so important to understand is it's not about uh coming in and and learning how to be a good christian at church is is falling more in love with you when you come to church how you can serve them with all your heart it's a love affair psalms 91 verse 14 i'll really try to hurry if you just it's it's wednesday my excuse is it's it's a it's a bible study take a little bit longer because he have set his love upon me therefore while i deliver him how many wants deliverance set your love upon him set your love upon him i will set him on high because you have known my name he shall call me and i will answer him i will be with him in trouble and i will deliver him and i will even honor him because he have set his love upon me focus on the priority the priority is god wants you to prove his love make the choice to prove that you love him second corinthians chapter 8 verse 8 i speak not by commandment but by occasion of the forwardness of others and to prove the sincerity of your love how many times has somebody told you i love you and you doubted it oh you said that before we've all said it and failed so we're all guilty if i could say this but what we're looking for is some proof god wants us to prove god wants us to prove psalms 26 verse 2 examine me o lord and prove me and try my reigns and my heart it's it's got to be a love affair if you really want that for your life examine me o lord and prove me all right i just want to end here with an example here in luke chapter 18. luke chapter 18 starting with verse number 18 the rich young ruler i see that we are really really depending on the screen up here i don't hear any pages going but this was to me is a good example that the tree of life was being presented to this man and this man chose the tree of knowledge of good and evil because there's only two trees verse 18 and a certain ruler asked him saying good master what shall i do to inherit eternal life how can i get back to that tree of life in the garden and jesus said unto him why do you call me good there's none good say one that is god so i don't know if this this this this rich young ruler obviously didn't have a revelation of who jesus was he was just some good master he's and he said thou knowest the commandments do not commit adultery do not kill do not steal do not bear false witness under thy father and thy mother and he said all these i have kept from my youth up and when jesus heard these things he said unto him good job you're off the hook you've been you've been better than most people in your church taken us to the thing that is lacking in her life yet lack is thou one thing sell all thou has distributed unto the poor and thou shalt have treasures in heaven and then come follow me and when he heard this he was very sorrowful for he was very rich and when jesus saw that he was very sorrowful he said how hardly shall they that have riches entered to the kingdom of god for it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of god and they that heard it said who then can be saved and he said these things the things which are impossible with men they're possible with god but how are they possible give god all your heart there was something in this man's life that stood before him and god not everybody he didn't say that to abraham abraham was very rich never said that god knows what's standing in our way between a culture walk or did we just say a full commitment to god amen amen then peter said lo we have left all and followed thee and look listen to this and he said unto them verily i say unto you there is no man that have left houses house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of god's sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time and in the world to come life everlasting god just wants to be first he's the only one in this room that knows every one of our hearts we've we've got to stand and use the greatest thing that he could give us to me is greater than the devil is the choice we have to surrender our life to god the devil don't know what to do that it's like a thousand votes let's stand together he don't know what to do when a man has surrendered his heart to god fall in love with god fall in love with him i love god yes i know let's fall more in love with him amen stretch the boundaries amen i am so needy lord so needy of you i am so needy lord to be more like you share all my right so circumcise our heart lord in this world of sin i am so needy lord to be pure within i am so needy lord so needy of you i am so needy lord to be more like you share all my rights away in this world of sin i am so needy lord to be pure within [Music] amen is that your desire it can only come through free more agency the more that you want it the more that god will do it amen you know there's a part of me that don't want it i don't want to let go of my i just i i it seems like it just becomes scared every time god gives you something and then you're asked or you get something and then you got to be willing to surrender it back to god and so it's something that we face all the time and if it's your desire let's just hold that before him as we go before him in prayer our heavenly father we thank you for proving your love to us and we thank you that you've given us all an opportunity to prove our love to you in the midst of the garden in the midst of this uh as as the uh brother branham the the god of this evil age this terrible world that we live in you told us not to love the world or the things of the world or the love of the father wasn't even in us and god we want to thank you for the opportunity you've given us to to share our rights away to share our wrong attitudes away to share everything that's negative away that we may prove our love for you and we don't have to wait to get to heaven to say i love you we don't have to wait until we feel your presence to say i love you jesus that we can offer that sacrifice of of praise and thanksgiving and when the devil would try to come and and bother us lord you've given us the power the power of choice to resist the enemy and he'll flee the power of choice to submit ourselves to you to allow you to share our rights away to make us more like you i pray for your people lord i pray for myself more needy i say more needy lord but these are my precious brothers and sisters these are the ones i love so closely lord they need you they need more of you and i pray lord that you would meet every need in their life god that you would feel them so full of your spirit so full of your love that tomorrow when they get up they would put their shoulders back they would know it'd be a grand opportunity to prove their love to you to make you smile lord no matter what's happening no matter what they're going through may they know that their love for you and your love for them is so much greater than every situation granted heavenly father i'll commit them to you lord i commit them to you may our love grow and grow may we continue to make that choice every day for you lord we thank you now for these things we humbly pray them in the precious name of jesus christ amen lord you so precious to me lord you are so precious to me and i love you yes i love you because you first loved me [Music] lord you are so gracious to me lord you are so gracious to me and i love you yes i love you [Music] because you first love me lord you are so precious to me just make love to him lord you are so precious to me and i love you yes i love you because you first love me amen it's his grace lord you are so gracious to me lord you are so gracious to me and i love you yes i love you because you first love me amen and he's still proven it i love him [Music]
