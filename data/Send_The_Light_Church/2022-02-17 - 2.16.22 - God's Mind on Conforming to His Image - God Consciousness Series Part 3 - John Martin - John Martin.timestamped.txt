[34:44] aside our own ideas be set aside
[34:47] and open our eyes to your word today we
[34:51] commit the service
[34:53] with every need into your hands lord we
[34:55] thank you for the grace that we have to
[34:57] gather together tonight
[34:59] we give you praise in jesus precious
[35:01] name amen
[35:03] amen
[35:04] philippians chapter 2 verse 1 if there
[35:07] if there be there for any consolation in
[35:09] christ any
[35:11] comfort
[35:12] of love and the fellowship of the spirit
[35:14] if any bowels
[35:16] and mercies fulfill you my joy now look
[35:19] at here
[35:20] that ye be like-minded so what is the
[35:23] like-mindedness let this mind be in you
[35:25] that was in christ like-minded having
[35:28] the same love being of one accord and of
[35:32] one mind so that one mind that one
[35:35] accord as identified as the same
[35:39] love there's a revelation here let
[35:42] nothing be done through strife and glory
[35:43] lowliness of mind but in the lowliness
[35:46] of mind let each esteem other than
[35:48] better than themselves look
[35:50] not every man on his own things but
[35:52] every man
[35:53] also on the things of others let this
[35:55] mind be in you which was also
[36:00] in christ jesus
[36:02] being in the form of god thought of not
[36:04] robbery to be equal with god
[36:06] but made himself of no reputation took
[36:09] upon him in the form of a servant was
[36:11] made in the likeness of men and being
[36:13] found in the fashion is a man he humbled
[36:15] himself and became obedient unto death
[36:17] even the death of the cross
[36:20] and then also one more scripture before
[36:22] you're seated
[36:23] romans chapter 8 and verses
[36:27] 28
[36:28] and 29
[36:36] and we know that all things work
[36:38] together for good
[36:41] to them that love god
[36:43] to them who are the called according
[36:47] to his purpose
[36:49] for whom he did for know he also did
[36:52] predestinate to be conformed to the
[36:55] image of his son that he might be the
[36:58] firstborn among many brethren amen god
[37:01] bless you you may be seated
[37:05] now last service we we took our time and
[37:08] i'm i'm
[37:09] hoping not to do that today because i
[37:12] want to try to get
[37:14] through this
[37:16] uh so i'll need your help and paying
[37:18] attention
[37:19] and if i lose you just pick back up
[37:23] as quick as you can
[37:25] both satan and god want to see their
[37:28] complete image in mankind
[37:31] before this is over
[37:34] god has always wanted to have fellowship
[37:37] after his kind the bible says let us
[37:39] make man in our image in our likeness
[37:42] it's been
[37:43] in god's mind from the beginning it's
[37:46] still there today we've been
[37:47] predestinated to come into that
[37:51] satan has always wanted to exalt his
[37:54] throne above the throne of god above the
[37:56] stars of god
[37:58] but he could never create anything so
[38:00] the only thing he could do was take
[38:02] god's subjects pervert them
[38:06] and use those subjects
[38:08] as part of his kingdom
[38:11] and the way that he corrupts man more
[38:13] and more is by simply convincing him to
[38:17] do what you want to do
[38:19] do what you want to do do your will
[38:22] that's why james says it's a sin to say
[38:24] i'm going to do this and i'm going to do
[38:26] that when we don't know the will of god
[38:28] we should say if it would be the will of
[38:30] the lord
[38:32] so
[38:33] satan corrupts
[38:35] man into his image by simply let him do
[38:39] what he wants to do now we would think
[38:42] that um
[38:44] and
[38:45] of course to become perfectly in
[38:48] satan's image we've got to be
[38:50] anti-rebellious against anything that
[38:52] has to do with god but
[38:55] we know that he knows that man will not
[38:59] make it into heaven unless they're born
[39:01] again so as long as man does his own
[39:04] will what he's born with
[39:05] he's not going to make it right
[39:08] so we see how the reason of really
[39:11] stressing this is because we're so
[39:12] tempted to do what we want to do
[39:14] and and things are getting worse in this
[39:16] this age
[39:18] and those who are written in the lamb's
[39:20] book of life from the foundation of the
[39:22] world
[39:23] they are predestinated to be in god's
[39:26] image
[39:28] no man can pluck him out of the father's
[39:29] hand no man can separate from the love
[39:31] of god no one can deceive them from
[39:34] becoming into god's image
[39:37] now the ones who are not elected no
[39:40] matter how much they believe they are
[39:42] no matter how much in the church they're
[39:44] in the message they will be deceived
[39:46] they will be separated and they will
[39:49] face the white throne judgment
[39:52] out of this group comes the foolish
[39:54] virgin
[39:55] they were deceived into thinking they
[39:57] had enough god
[39:59] enough oil enough holy ghost enough of
[40:03] the will of god in their life to make it
[40:06] can you really have enough to make it
[40:09] but why do we feel we have enough right
[40:13] but the real masterpiece of satan are to
[40:15] those who are sold out
[40:17] to do their own will right
[40:21] remember brother branham talking about
[40:22] in an old a woman or an old man who
[40:26] really
[40:27] they get crowned with satan
[40:31] remember him talking about that
[40:34] and um
[40:35] he and he says brother branson says oh
[40:37] lord don't let her let me have that kind
[40:39] of spirit when i get older
[40:41] and
[40:42] you and that kind of spirit is just
[40:44] murmuring complaining and just a
[40:47] negativity in their life
[40:50] and and god wants to crown us
[40:53] with
[40:54] his spirit amen
[40:57] satan's real masterpiece is complete
[41:00] rebellion from god's will
[41:02] first samuel 15 verse 22 first samuel 15
[41:06] verse 22 and samuel said have the lord
[41:10] have the lord as great to light and burn
[41:12] offerings and sacrifices as in obeying
[41:14] the voice of the lord it's a question
[41:17] and he says behold to obey
[41:19] is better than sacrifice
[41:21] and to hearken than the fed of rams for
[41:24] rebellion is as the sin of rich
[41:27] witchcraft
[41:28] so we come we hear the word of god we're
[41:31] either going to walk out and just i'm
[41:33] gonna i gotta make sure i'm gonna do
[41:34] this or that's not that big a deal
[41:37] it's rebellion
[41:39] okay for rebellion this is a sin of
[41:41] witchcraft and stubbornness
[41:44] i don't have to do that and i'm still
[41:46] going to heaven is as iniquity and
[41:48] idolatry
[41:50] because thou now here it is because that
[41:53] was rejected the word of the lord
[41:57] you just for for no reason do you ever
[42:00] want to reject the word of the lord
[42:02] it's okay to say god give me faith to do
[42:05] this
[42:06] help me i need your grace i'm not doing
[42:09] it but don't reject it
[42:12] because the bible says because those
[42:14] rejected the word he have also rejected
[42:17] thee
[42:19] so how can we come how can we come into
[42:21] the predestination of his image by
[42:24] rejecting part of the word we can't
[42:28] so
[42:29] satan had a masterpiece in judas we we
[42:31] know that
[42:33] he was called the son of perdition
[42:35] he sold out at the last minute and
[42:38] that's why jesus said he that endure to
[42:40] the end the same shall be saved it's not
[42:42] where we're at today
[42:46] judas was right there
[42:48] with all the other apostles right up to
[42:50] the end
[42:51] casting out devils
[42:54] taking care of the finances
[42:56] he was right there
[42:58] but at the very end he said
[43:02] i'm going to take the other side i'm
[43:03] going to do my will
[43:07] satan will have another masterpiece in
[43:09] the antichrist
[43:12] just like god will have another
[43:14] masterpiece in his bride
[43:18] one will be conformed in the image of
[43:20] satan to the exercising of their own
[43:23] will
[43:25] the other will be conformed to the image
[43:27] of jesus christ through the exercising
[43:29] of god's will
[43:34] we become more into the image of the
[43:36] devil by doing our own will now most of
[43:38] the time we don't realize this
[43:42] that's why we must be born against will
[43:45] to obey god's will
[43:47] it's not just say oh i willed him to be
[43:50] born there's something that happens when
[43:53] god wills a person to be born
[43:55] they just don't keep doing what they
[43:57] want to do if god is really born
[43:59] somebody
[44:01] that they
[44:02] are seed after his seed
[44:06] matthew 7 21 says not everyone that
[44:08] sayeth unto me lord lord shall enter to
[44:11] the kingdom of heaven
[44:12] but
[44:13] he that doeth the will of my father
[44:16] which is in heaven so we've got to come
[44:19] to grips with doing the will of god amen
[44:22] can't have the attitude of take it leave
[44:25] it got the most important things we got
[44:27] to get rid of any kind of denominational
[44:30] thinking
[44:31] we're not a denominational but that's
[44:33] what denominations think well be we
[44:35] believe this i've done this i'm there
[44:39] but when it comes to the word of god
[44:42] god holds us accountable for the whole
[44:43] word
[44:45] and we that's why we work out our
[44:47] salvation with fear and treatment
[44:49] trembling
[44:53] we talked a little bit i don't want to
[44:55] get too much in the last time but we
[44:56] talked about 666 the number of man is
[45:00] instead of the son of god and our will
[45:02] is always instead of god's will
[45:06] that's why we have to become born again
[45:08] to do the will of god amen
[45:11] now before we come into god's image i
[45:14] believe we need to know what that is
[45:17] what is the image of god
[45:20] brother branham said if you want to know
[45:22] who god is look at jesus christ
[45:26] the bible says that jesus christ is in
[45:29] the image of the invisible god
[45:34] jesus christ brother graham said is the
[45:35] masterpiece of god
[45:39] we can't really make a statement or have
[45:42] a sermon that encompasses all that god's
[45:45] image is it's it's impossible what we're
[45:47] going to do is search the scriptures do
[45:48] the best that we can and i want to plant
[45:50] some seeds today you may have never
[45:53] heard this before
[45:55] uh and you may not
[45:57] uh maybe even agree with it i'll just
[46:00] say it like this put the thing on the
[46:02] shelf pray about it
[46:05] god
[46:06] is identified as having a lot of
[46:08] attributes
[46:10] we heard last sunday
[46:12] about being a buckler and a shield
[46:15] well he's a comforter he's a defense
[46:17] he's a rock
[46:18] the tie pulse an anchor a deliverer a
[46:21] healer a provider he's our joy or peace
[46:23] our guy we sung about he's our pilot
[46:26] there are many many attributes of god
[46:30] but what is the image behind those
[46:33] attributes
[46:35] what is the image that you and i are
[46:38] predestinated to come into
[46:41] what is the image of god's masterpiece
[46:44] in his
[46:45] son jesus christ
[46:49] the scripture declares that god is love
[46:55] god is it's not an attribute
[47:00] he is love
[47:02] and through
[47:04] what he is come all those attributes
[47:11] love is the image of god
[47:14] and i'm not speaking of human love
[47:16] filial love i'm speaking of the divine
[47:19] agape love of god
[47:21] divine love is the image that god
[47:24] has predestined us to come into
[47:27] now the majority of the people will miss
[47:30] this revelation
[47:33] after brother brennan went beyond the
[47:35] curtain of time he came back and he said
[47:38] nothing but perfect love can enter in
[47:41] he didn't say that about anything else
[47:44] in other words nothing but the very
[47:47] image of god will enter in there
[47:50] let us make man in our image and in our
[47:53] likeness for fellowship brother brian
[47:55] said he wanted to have fellowship with
[47:57] his kind and if nothing enters in
[48:00] besides perfect love that that is his
[48:02] image that is his likeness
[48:08] now if jesus said not everyone that
[48:10] saith unto me lord lord shall enter the
[48:11] kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the
[48:13] will of the father which is in heaven
[48:15] then we would have to conclude that it
[48:17] will take perfect love to do all the
[48:20] will of god
[48:22] that's important
[48:24] it is hard to do the will of god if you
[48:26] don't love god
[48:29] because his the bible says that his
[48:32] commandments are not grievous but they
[48:34] grievous if you're not love and you just
[48:36] look at everything as do's and don'ts
[48:39] but when you're in so in love with god
[48:41] that you're willing to die out to your
[48:43] will to do the will of
[48:46] god want that to sink in deep
[48:50] jesus said this is my commandment that
[48:52] you love one another
[48:55] first john chapter 2 verse 5 first john
[48:58] chapter 2 verse 5 but whosoever keepeth
[49:02] his word the word of god
[49:05] in him
[49:06] verily is the love of god
[49:09] perfected
[49:11] hereby
[49:13] we okay hereby know we
[49:16] uh that we are in him
[49:22] he that saith he abideth in him all also
[49:24] to walk even as he walked so at this
[49:28] point it really doesn't matter how much
[49:30] we know
[49:32] it matters how we walk
[49:36] so our interactions with one another how
[49:38] we respond about situations
[49:41] how we handle situations are we bearing
[49:44] all things believing all things hoping
[49:46] all things are we volunteering ourselves
[49:48] or are we steaming others better than
[49:50] ourselves it's about our walk
[49:54] that declares the image it's not about
[49:56] what we know
[50:00] now this revelation i believe was so
[50:02] strong in brother branham's heart that
[50:03] he went on to say whatever you do
[50:06] lay aside everything else that you got
[50:08] going on in your life i'm paraphrasing
[50:10] and get perfect love
[50:14] go after it
[50:16] he found what the requirement was to get
[50:19] there
[50:20] and he put the emphasis on it doesn't
[50:23] matter what you got going on good bad
[50:26] indifferent
[50:27] um what what kind of money what kind of
[50:30] business whatever you got going lay it
[50:32] aside until
[50:35] how much emphasis do we put on getting
[50:37] the love of god
[50:41] we feel we've got the love of god and we
[50:43] do
[50:44] but are we in completely in his image
[50:48] so to me we should be laying certain
[50:50] things aside
[50:53] and getting more into that image because
[50:56] look we've been predestined to get there
[50:58] and it don't happen all by god
[51:03] god cannot die out for us
[51:06] god cannot say don't do your will and it
[51:09] don't get done magically he can only
[51:12] present to us what we need to do with
[51:14] our will
[51:20] god's image was manifested
[51:24] in the flesh
[51:25] of jesus christ
[51:32] god's image of perfect love if i could
[51:35] say like that was manifested in jesus
[51:38] christ for god so loved the world that
[51:40] he gave
[51:41] there was no greater expression
[51:50] nothing but perfect love can enter in
[51:52] there
[51:54] he said
[51:55] get to the place where you can love
[51:57] everyone
[51:58] even your enemies
[52:02] now the thing is we we
[52:04] focus on well nobody's perfect
[52:07] nobody can do that
[52:10] and we rest
[52:11] on our reasoning
[52:13] instead of resting on what the word is
[52:15] telling us to do lord i can't do lord
[52:18] you see how much i've you see how i blow
[52:21] you see
[52:23] lord
[52:24] your word declares that i'm predestined
[52:27] to come into your image teach me to die
[52:29] out show me how to die show me how to
[52:31] pray through until i get wrapped up in
[52:34] the holy spirit so much the love of god
[52:36] is shall grow in our heart by the holy
[52:38] ghost
[52:40] it's not us trying to do it
[52:43] it's us becoming in his image
[52:50] jesus said in john 13 34 a new
[52:53] commandment
[52:54] i give you
[52:57] that you love one another
[53:00] as i have loved you
[53:03] that ye also love
[53:05] one another
[53:07] this isn't just one of the things that
[53:09] you know we have to do like you know men
[53:11] cut their hair and women don't cut their
[53:13] hair and you know women wear dresses and
[53:16] skirts and men wear pants and it isn't
[53:19] that
[53:22] this is not a do
[53:23] a don't this is the image of christ
[53:29] by this shall all men next verse by this
[53:32] shall all men know that you're my
[53:34] disciple
[53:36] in other words they're going to know
[53:37] you're in my image if you have the same
[53:40] love one for another.
[53:43] first john 3 16 hereby perceive we the
[53:45] love of god or the image of god because
[53:48] he laid down his life for us we ought to
[53:51] lay down our lives for the brethren
[53:53] show them we're in the same same image
[53:57] it takes a lot to lay down your life
[53:59] because
[54:00] you know we we love our life
[54:03] we only got so many hours in the day and
[54:05] if you're like me you wish you had
[54:07] another 24.
[54:09] right
[54:11] even if you were just wasted of you
[54:13] still want another 24.
[54:16] it is hard to lay down whatever you have
[54:19] for others
[54:20] but brother brandon said eternal life is
[54:22] living for others
[54:24] let's go to our opening scripture in
[54:26] philippians chapter 2 verse 1.
[54:29] paul is describing the very image of
[54:31] god's great love he says if there
[54:34] be therefore any consolation in christ
[54:37] if any comforter love of any fellowship
[54:40] of the spirit
[54:42] if any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my
[54:46] joy
[54:47] that you be like-minded
[54:49] having the same love
[54:51] being of one accord and of one mind
[54:54] noticing that that verse really really
[54:58] to me gives us a great clue what the
[55:00] mind of christ is the same
[55:03] love
[55:05] one mind one accord now
[55:07] i believe with all my heart
[55:10] that god is wanting us to come in accord
[55:14] with his mind
[55:17] because we'll never get in one accord
[55:19] with one another
[55:21] properly if we don't get in one accord
[55:24] with christ first we don't want to be
[55:26] building a tower of babel that that
[55:29] babel that's not going to help us
[55:31] get to god just by being in unity about
[55:35] something we got to be in unity about
[55:38] loving one another about doing what this
[55:41] word tells us to do
[55:45] let nothing
[55:47] nothing
[55:48] not most things
[55:50] be done through strife or vainglory did
[55:52] you ever just do something and you're
[55:53] upset and angry
[55:56] bothered
[55:58] strife or
[55:59] maybe you just have to prove something
[56:01] that's vainglory
[56:04] but in lowliness of mine just the
[56:06] opposite of that
[56:08] a lowliness
[56:11] take time to esteem others better than
[56:13] yourself not when you think they're
[56:15] worthy of it
[56:16] not when they did good not when they're
[56:18] acting right
[56:19] not when you judge them they're okay to
[56:22] do that
[56:24] no you just do it
[56:26] if christ condemned and said it to men
[56:28] of low state why can't we
[56:31] if he laid down down his life for those
[56:34] that were unworthy how come we can't
[56:36] right amen
[56:40] all right look not every man on his own
[56:43] things
[56:47] get interested in other people's things
[56:50] let every man also on the things of
[56:52] others
[56:53] let this mind this mind of others not
[56:57] yourself
[56:59] being you
[57:00] which was also in christ jesus
[57:04] you see it
[57:06] who being in the form of god he thought
[57:08] it not robbery to be equal of god
[57:11] he he knew he was in the image of god he
[57:15] didn't think it was
[57:16] robbery like oh i'm taking uh advantage
[57:20] so i'm just going to use my powers for
[57:23] myself
[57:26] no if he's equal with god in the image
[57:30] of god is love and he humbled himself to
[57:34] lay down his life for man that he would
[57:36] do the same thing he would do the things
[57:38] that please the father jesus said my
[57:41] father don't love me because i lay down
[57:43] my life
[57:46] so if you you want to i'm i'm i'm god's
[57:49] bride i'm his wife i i'm predestined i'm
[57:52] the seat of god then thinking not
[57:54] robberly lay down your life like jesus
[57:57] laid down his life then
[58:00] prove it with service humble yourself to
[58:03] the word
[58:10] but made himself of no reputation took
[58:12] upon him the form of a servant was made
[58:14] in the likeness of men and being found
[58:17] in the fashion as a man he humbled
[58:19] himself he just kept going he kept
[58:22] humbling it wasn't just good enough to
[58:24] be a human
[58:25] he was a humble human
[58:27] and he became obedient
[58:30] unto death
[58:32] not just his will
[58:34] right but the death of the cross
[58:37] you couldn't do you couldn't be any more
[58:39] humbler than that you couldn't be any
[58:41] more giving that you couldn't be any
[58:42] more loving than that now that's our
[58:44] example if we're predestined to come
[58:46] into that image then this is what we
[58:48] must do we don't sit back and say i'm in
[58:51] i'm in the message i believe the prophet
[58:53] and i'm going to be a preacher i'm
[58:55] predestined to be in his image and do
[58:57] nothing no lay aside everything until
[59:00] you get that image
[59:05] we we had someone that crossed the other
[59:07] side
[59:16] satan's image becomes manifested through
[59:20] the power of man exercising his own will
[59:24] that's why he could say my brother
[59:26] branham could say that power without
[59:29] character is satanic in other words we
[59:32] all have power you know people are
[59:34] shooting people and and and killing and
[59:37] robbing and doing all sorts of things
[59:39] they've got power
[59:41] to exercise their will but they have no
[59:43] character to restrain themselves to do
[59:46] only the things that please the father
[59:49] now god's image becomes manifested
[59:53] through the power of man exercising
[59:56] god's will
[59:58] and look i want to say this
[1:00:00] don't wait for god to come in church
[1:00:03] and in a whole hour speak one thing to
[1:00:06] you that you know was him
[1:00:08] i'm sorry god is in his word
[1:00:11] he should be speaking a whole lot you
[1:00:13] should be interested in a whole image
[1:00:16] not some personal uh experience this
[1:00:19] whole world should be personal to the
[1:00:21] bride of jesus christ the bride makes
[1:00:23] yourself ready she makes yourself ready
[1:00:26] into the image
[1:00:31] she has a part to play we'll see here
[1:00:37] how does she come into that image
[1:00:40] she humbles herself to the word
[1:00:45] unto death
[1:00:47] because that's what it takes i'm telling
[1:00:49] you how many times you sit in church you
[1:00:50] don't feel like worshiping
[1:00:54] what you got to do is die out to that
[1:00:55] thought that mindset it's not about
[1:00:57] whether you feel like it
[1:00:59] it's about whether you got a revelation
[1:01:01] that he's worthy of worship
[1:01:05] they don't the angels in heaven don't
[1:01:07] come to jesus and say now look let's
[1:01:09] settle down you know you've had enough
[1:01:10] don't you think
[1:01:12] we're getting tired don't you think
[1:01:16] no
[1:01:18] but but down here the devil gets us to
[1:01:20] reason so much
[1:01:23] revelations
[1:01:24] 12 11 says and they overcame him
[1:01:29] i believe him
[1:01:30] is those
[1:01:32] giants in their life
[1:01:34] by the blood of the lamb by the word of
[1:01:36] their testimony and they love not their
[1:01:38] lives unto death so what was wrong with
[1:01:42] those other 10 spies that really
[1:01:45] convinced
[1:01:46] a 1.8 million of those hebrew children
[1:01:50] not to go in
[1:01:51] to the promised land
[1:01:54] what was that
[1:01:55] they feared for their life
[1:01:58] they loved their life they feared for
[1:02:00] their life they thought they would die
[1:02:03] with joshua and caleb
[1:02:05] they didn't even entertain those
[1:02:07] thoughts
[1:02:09] they just said it was god's word we're
[1:02:11] going for it
[1:02:14] and either this is god's word
[1:02:16] i can't love i can love what god loves
[1:02:20] i can't come into this image
[1:02:23] not staring at the giants in our life
[1:02:25] the the habits the problems the things
[1:02:27] we've had all of our life the things
[1:02:29] that gets us in trouble you can look at
[1:02:31] that you can get scared and then you can
[1:02:32] begin to make excuses of why you don't
[1:02:35] think you can live that
[1:02:37] or you can be the joshua and caleb of
[1:02:39] this age and say god's word says that
[1:02:41] i'm predestinated to come into his image
[1:02:44] i will make myself ready
[1:02:48] the choice is ours
[1:02:50] the elect the bride his wife will
[1:02:53] develop the character she needs to lay
[1:02:56] down her life
[1:02:59] psalms
[1:03:00] 23 i said believe it says the lord is my
[1:03:02] shepherd what i shall not want
[1:03:06] we have to learn to get rid of that
[1:03:08] thing
[1:03:09] brother branham said character is the
[1:03:11] only thing that we're taking with us
[1:03:13] when we leave
[1:03:15] if you couple that with perfect love is
[1:03:17] the only thing that enters into that
[1:03:19] place you can see character that he's
[1:03:22] talking about
[1:03:23] is perfect love
[1:03:25] the character of perfect love this is
[1:03:27] the image i want us to recognize that
[1:03:31] we're predestinated to come into
[1:03:33] are you with me
[1:03:36] this character will not be gifted
[1:03:39] because brother brandon says character
[1:03:41] is not a gift
[1:03:43] so you'll have to fight for this
[1:03:45] character
[1:03:47] and every time you get in a fight
[1:03:49] something happens you have a chance to
[1:03:51] build your character
[1:03:54] hallelujah don't wait for god to come
[1:03:57] down with some great revelation to to
[1:03:59] hold you back from from swearing no
[1:04:02] ain't happening like that
[1:04:07] you are a believer this is you know your
[1:04:10] place
[1:04:13] god hasn't expected them for us
[1:04:16] we've been predestinated to the image of
[1:04:20] perfect love
[1:04:21] but how do we get there
[1:04:23] well we want to try to spend a few more
[1:04:25] minutes on how to get there first of all
[1:04:27] it will take
[1:04:29] your love
[1:04:31] because only your love for god is going
[1:04:34] to tell your flesh i'm done
[1:04:37] doing what i want to do
[1:04:40] so your love for god's going to have to
[1:04:42] be greater
[1:04:44] than your love for your will
[1:04:47] and i believe that's the same love that
[1:04:49] we're talking about here in romans 8 28
[1:04:52] and we know that all things work
[1:04:54] together for the good to them
[1:04:56] to them now speaking of
[1:04:58] the bride
[1:05:01] i believe
[1:05:02] to them i mean they're they're their
[1:05:04] predestinated group
[1:05:07] to them
[1:05:08] that love god now here's the problem
[1:05:11] with this statement if we don't we need
[1:05:13] this is why we need a revelation
[1:05:15] we all have a love for god i believe
[1:05:17] judas at one point had a love for god
[1:05:20] i believe the devil could even convince
[1:05:22] judas that if he did this he would have
[1:05:25] to rise up against the romans and be the
[1:05:29] be the very uh the master down here that
[1:05:32] he wouldn't have to go to calvary i
[1:05:34] could see satan putting that in his mind
[1:05:36] and convincing him deceiving him
[1:05:43] but do we love god to the amount that is
[1:05:47] required well what is the amount that's
[1:05:49] required it says right there to them who
[1:05:52] are the called according to his purpose
[1:05:56] so god is not interested
[1:05:58] in my little plans
[1:06:02] he ain't interested in my little
[1:06:04] reputation
[1:06:08] he's not interested on me going on
[1:06:10] vacation i'm saying that because i'm
[1:06:12] going on vacation next week i can say
[1:06:14] that
[1:06:15] i'm bringing a point
[1:06:18] it's not my purpose
[1:06:22] that things are going to work together
[1:06:23] for the good it's his purpose
[1:06:28] so
[1:06:29] god is interested in whether the goat is
[1:06:34] dying
[1:06:35] or i'm going on vacate god is interested
[1:06:37] in all of our lives with every detail
[1:06:40] but there's one thing only one thing
[1:06:42] that all things will work together for
[1:06:45] the good that's if we love god to the
[1:06:48] point that we've been called to fulfill
[1:06:51] his purpose
[1:06:53] why in the world would anybody want to
[1:06:56] buy a car that would not take them to
[1:06:58] where they want to go
[1:07:02] why would anybody want to build a house
[1:07:06] to the point that
[1:07:08] when it rained it came into the house
[1:07:11] it wouldn't fulfill the purpose why
[1:07:14] would god want to have a bride that
[1:07:16] didn't fulfill his purpose
[1:07:22] so what does he say let's continue
[1:07:24] reading here for whom he did for no to
[1:07:28] these he predestinated this is talking
[1:07:30] about the same thing it's not a
[1:07:31] different subject
[1:07:33] he also did predestinate to be conformed
[1:07:36] now that word conformed it means jointly
[1:07:39] formed
[1:07:42] were being jointly formed to the image
[1:07:46] of his son that he might be the
[1:07:48] firstborn of a lot of images just like
[1:07:51] him
[1:07:54] we're not magically brought into his
[1:07:56] image without any effort of our own
[1:07:59] just some i believe i believe
[1:08:03] well if all you've got to do is believe
[1:08:05] why did we have a prophet come by and
[1:08:06] tell us whatever you do lay aside
[1:08:08] everything until you get it when all you
[1:08:10] have to do is believe to get it
[1:08:15] we pay so little attention to certain
[1:08:17] things
[1:08:19] and put emphasis on our will
[1:08:22] what we want to accomplish
[1:08:26] you can gain the whole world jesus said
[1:08:30] i'm not worried about losing my soul but
[1:08:32] i'll tell you i am worried
[1:08:34] that i don't make a rapture
[1:08:40] there's a lot of people that'll come to
[1:08:42] me in that day and say lord lord didn't
[1:08:44] we didn't we didn't we i thought
[1:08:48] if i didn't have that i wouldn't have
[1:08:49] fear and trembling
[1:08:54] and what good would it do
[1:08:56] anybody anybody in the whole world
[1:08:59] if i stood up and i said i know that i'm
[1:09:02] going in the rapture
[1:09:06] what good
[1:09:09] no good
[1:09:12] i want if my life cannot prove that
[1:09:15] jesus christ is the same yesterday today
[1:09:17] and forever and that i i if i can't lay
[1:09:20] down my life
[1:09:23] and i can't live a life of love
[1:09:27] what does it matter what i believe then
[1:09:31] because i haven't been carnally
[1:09:34] predestined to make it just because i
[1:09:37] say that i'm in the message or i believe
[1:09:39] the message
[1:09:40] somehow this word brother branham taught
[1:09:43] me has to hold me accountable
[1:09:51] it's not if we speak in tongues it's not
[1:09:53] if we do many glorious works
[1:09:56] it's about if i can lay down my life day
[1:09:59] in and day out for the lord for his
[1:10:01] purpose
[1:10:06] we've been predestined to be conformed
[1:10:09] or jointly
[1:10:10] brought in
[1:10:12] to god's
[1:10:13] image now in the message christ is a
[1:10:16] mystery of god reveal brother branham
[1:10:19] says and um to me an amazing statement
[1:10:21] here
[1:10:22] he said this is god's great mystery
[1:10:26] of love
[1:10:28] expressed that god
[1:10:31] and man
[1:10:32] become one
[1:10:35] the image
[1:10:37] we're coming into the image of god
[1:10:40] it's a great it's god's great mystery
[1:10:44] of love
[1:10:45] expressed
[1:10:47] see the whole thing is god in man one
[1:10:51] god and man was one there and god and
[1:10:54] man is one here see what it is
[1:10:57] being filled with his spirit
[1:11:00] him having the preeminence
[1:11:03] that was god's achievement that's god's
[1:11:06] purpose to do that that he might be in
[1:11:09] christ christ in us and all of us
[1:11:12] together won
[1:11:15] yes there should be so many amens on
[1:11:17] that one the holy spirit the same thing
[1:11:20] it revealed
[1:11:22] it to christ it revealed here the
[1:11:24] supernatural
[1:11:26] creative
[1:11:28] power
[1:11:29] see the one thing we can't do is we
[1:11:32] can't manifest christ on our own
[1:11:38] another thing that christ can't do
[1:11:41] he can't force our will to die out
[1:11:46] so here's the battle
[1:11:48] we do our part and die out
[1:11:51] christ does his
[1:11:53] supernatural
[1:11:54] power and changes us
[1:11:57] but your will has to say i want this
[1:12:00] more than anything that's the love
[1:12:03] that love has to be so strong that
[1:12:05] you're willing to give up your will you
[1:12:07] have to call it out say that was wrong i
[1:12:09] shouldn't get upset i shouldn't be like
[1:12:11] that that's not the nature of christ
[1:12:13] that's not the love of god i rebuke you
[1:12:16] satan in the name of jesus
[1:12:18] i want this out of my life now you go
[1:12:20] that far and you you love god that much
[1:12:22] that you're putting forth you do
[1:12:24] everything you can light aside
[1:12:26] everything until you get perfect and
[1:12:27] i'll tell you god will come on the scene
[1:12:29] and he will fill you with his spirit he
[1:12:31] will fill you with his love amen
[1:12:34] only things stand in the way of us our
[1:12:36] will
[1:12:38] you can say you believe but if your will
[1:12:39] stand in your way you don't believe
[1:12:45] this is god's great mystery of love
[1:12:47] express that god and man become one
[1:12:53] we are in the process
[1:12:55] of uniting together with god's divine
[1:12:58] nature right now we're in the process
[1:13:01] we're right in the middle from
[1:13:05] being so satanic
[1:13:08] to being in god's image we're right in
[1:13:10] the middle we're in the process
[1:13:12] somewhere
[1:13:13] are you with me
[1:13:15] you ever noticed why some people they
[1:13:17] just for years
[1:13:20] seem to get nowhere and then some people
[1:13:22] really grow what is that
[1:13:25] gods don't respect your persons
[1:13:29] god cannot
[1:13:31] go past the barrier of our will
[1:13:36] why didn't
[1:13:38] why didn't god just take joshua and
[1:13:39] caleb and say come on look i'm going to
[1:13:41] take you two guys
[1:13:43] these other 1.8 million are going to
[1:13:45] stay over there
[1:13:46] and we're going to go get you're going
[1:13:48] to go take the land and then you're
[1:13:50] going to prove to them that you were
[1:13:51] right and they were wrong why didn't god
[1:13:53] do he could have done it
[1:13:57] their own belief kept them out it's a
[1:14:00] personal experience
[1:14:02] it's not about your brother or sister
[1:14:03] how big the church is how small the
[1:14:05] church is what's happening in your home
[1:14:07] it's all between you and god amen it's
[1:14:09] how serious you are about coming into
[1:14:11] god's image see satan wants to do
[1:14:13] nothing than to get a a
[1:14:17] people in this message so caught up in
[1:14:19] lukewarm laodicea in need of nothing i'm
[1:14:21] in the message
[1:14:26] but there is a group who will not be
[1:14:29] deceived she can't be deceived
[1:14:33] she's laying everything aside so she
[1:14:35] gets a
[1:14:37] perfect love
[1:14:40] man don't you want an opportunity to
[1:14:42] manifest perfect love
[1:14:46] what you're doing is you're manifesting
[1:14:48] christ
[1:14:50] so the first it starts with letting the
[1:14:52] mind of
[1:14:54] love letting the mind of christ the mind
[1:14:58] of love be in you that was in christ
[1:15:00] jesus a mindset of love
[1:15:06] you know we have battled with drama and
[1:15:10] battled
[1:15:11] with isms and schisms you know god came
[1:15:15] spoke to our church and i'm so grateful
[1:15:17] for his word he doesn't want any isms in
[1:15:20] the skirt in the church
[1:15:21] he doesn't want little clicks he doesn't
[1:15:24] want why favor this person i like this
[1:15:26] person i get along with that person and
[1:15:27] i'm going to talk about that person and
[1:15:29] that is so antichrist that is the
[1:15:31] anti-christ mind
[1:15:35] that that's not the image that god is
[1:15:37] calling us into
[1:15:40] the mind of christ will lead each one of
[1:15:43] us to humble ourselves
[1:15:47] become obedient to the word
[1:15:49] by dying out to our way of thinking
[1:15:54] your love for god is proven
[1:15:57] by the manifestation of you dying out to
[1:16:00] your will
[1:16:02] amen second
[1:16:05] we don't just die once
[1:16:09] but we keep dying
[1:16:13] i wish we had more time
[1:16:15] remember the first
[1:16:16] encounter that you had with god just
[1:16:18] might have to go back a while
[1:16:20] he may have tugged on your heart
[1:16:23] many times
[1:16:24] but that time that you finally
[1:16:26] surrendered
[1:16:28] something took place
[1:16:31] ephesians chapter 2 verse 2 says where
[1:16:33] in times past ye walked according to the
[1:16:35] course of this world according to the
[1:16:36] prince of the power of the heir the
[1:16:38] spirit that now works in the children of
[1:16:40] disobedience among whom also we all had
[1:16:43] our conversations in times past in the
[1:16:45] lust of our flesh fulfilling the desires
[1:16:48] of the flesh and of the mind who were by
[1:16:50] nature
[1:16:52] the children
[1:16:53] of wrath what a description
[1:16:57] in other words our true colors were
[1:16:58] shown when we didn't get what we want
[1:17:01] no different than today
[1:17:02] no different today you don't get what
[1:17:04] you want wrath comes out
[1:17:07] but god who is rich in mercy
[1:17:11] for his great love we're with he loved
[1:17:14] us
[1:17:15] even when we were dead and said what did
[1:17:17] he do he quickened us
[1:17:19] together
[1:17:20] that ye joined us together
[1:17:23] by grace are you saved
[1:17:25] one day god's word was spoken to us and
[1:17:28] we believe the truth and through faith
[1:17:31] god began to quicken us together with
[1:17:35] christ
[1:17:37] unite
[1:17:39] us with god's nature
[1:17:43] we were so happy when we were forgiven
[1:17:47] we just wanted
[1:17:48] to love everybody we want to tell
[1:17:50] everybody about god his great love
[1:17:54] think about the first message and tell
[1:17:55] me if this agrees with you god came by
[1:17:58] us
[1:18:00] or he sent somebody by us
[1:18:03] and he told us that we belong
[1:18:06] to him
[1:18:07] that we were a son or daughter of god
[1:18:10] that we were a predestinated seat of god
[1:18:14] we were elected by god
[1:18:17] that we were with him before the
[1:18:19] foundation of the world now this is the
[1:18:20] first time he came by
[1:18:23] so just
[1:18:24] relax be at peace i died for you
[1:18:28] you're coming to heaven
[1:18:30] because you're my predestinated seed
[1:18:33] now is that how it happened
[1:18:36] but why is that happening now
[1:18:40] why is it happening now if it didn't
[1:18:42] happen then
[1:18:48] when god first got a hold of our hearts
[1:18:51] we got so
[1:18:52] convicted of sin what was the first
[1:18:56] thing we did
[1:18:58] repent
[1:19:01] that was our first encounter we repented
[1:19:05] it's the first key to get into the
[1:19:07] kingdom
[1:19:09] jesus gave peter the keys and peter said
[1:19:12] repent
[1:19:13] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:19:15] of jesus christ for the remission of
[1:19:17] your sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:19:19] of the holy ghost
[1:19:22] the problem with the mind that is not
[1:19:24] converted is it usually stops right
[1:19:27] there
[1:19:29] but it's through the process of
[1:19:30] repentance dying out self-denial that we
[1:19:34] come more into the image of god
[1:19:40] jesus said if you want to follow me you
[1:19:42] want to be my disciple you must deny
[1:19:45] yourself you must take up your cross you
[1:19:47] must die out to yourself daily
[1:19:51] amen and then follow me amen
[1:19:54] now he told us what to do
[1:19:57] to follow him
[1:20:00] and he uses that word daily
[1:20:02] wow
[1:20:04] that just changes our whole life right
[1:20:06] there
[1:20:07] if we get a revelation of that daily
[1:20:11] luke 14 verse 26 if any man come after
[1:20:15] me and hate not his father mother his
[1:20:18] wife children brothers sisters yay
[1:20:20] his own life also
[1:20:23] he cannot be
[1:20:25] my disciple
[1:20:28] even though he says he's
[1:20:30] jesus's disciple jesus won't claim him
[1:20:33] there's a difference
[1:20:34] and whosoever does not bear his cross
[1:20:37] and come after me he cannot be my
[1:20:39] disciple
[1:20:41] so jesus told his followers from the
[1:20:44] beginning that there was going to be a
[1:20:46] process that happened every day
[1:20:50] and this process will take you into the
[1:20:52] image of god
[1:20:54] but as soon as you stop i've done enough
[1:20:56] i'm saved a message i believe
[1:21:00] you're coming into his image thoughts
[1:21:02] because you do not become into god's
[1:21:05] image of love by sitting listening and
[1:21:08] learning about the word of god
[1:21:12] and i'll say amen a thousand times i'll
[1:21:14] say that statement a thousand times
[1:21:20] we heard in our men's meeting if we do
[1:21:22] not become a doer of the word we're only
[1:21:25] deceiving herself
[1:21:29] romans
[1:21:30] chapter 8 verse 11 but if the spirit of
[1:21:33] him that raised up jesus from the dead
[1:21:36] if it now dwells in you
[1:21:38] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:21:40] shall also quicken
[1:21:42] your moral bodies by his spirit that
[1:21:45] dwells in you so we we have no problem
[1:21:48] saying i've got the holy ghost
[1:21:51] but for some reason our life has a
[1:21:53] problem
[1:21:54] of manifesting that quickening power
[1:21:58] now don't get quiet on me
[1:22:01] we've got to hold ourselves accountable
[1:22:05] therefore brethren we are debtors not to
[1:22:08] the flesh to live after the flesh
[1:22:10] anymore so what do we do
[1:22:12] if we live after the flesh
[1:22:14] we'll die
[1:22:15] but if we through the holy ghost through
[1:22:18] the help of the lord
[1:22:20] to mortify the deeds of the body we
[1:22:24] shall live i'll tell you if if we're
[1:22:26] missing joy and peace and love i think
[1:22:28] what needs to happen is through the
[1:22:30] spirit you need to mortify the deeds of
[1:22:32] the body you need to say no to yourself
[1:22:34] sometime
[1:22:37] get that joy back
[1:22:40] you know
[1:22:41] do not wait
[1:22:43] for the special speaker to come
[1:22:46] don't wait for the special songs
[1:22:48] don't wait to some good feeling or or
[1:22:51] something god don't even wait for god to
[1:22:53] use you
[1:22:57] just mortify
[1:22:59] the jesus for as many now look at this
[1:23:02] not a different subject for as many as
[1:23:04] are led by the spirit of god they are
[1:23:07] the sons of god the spirit of god is
[1:23:09] leading you to mortify the deeds of your
[1:23:11] body
[1:23:13] amen
[1:23:15] and if you're led
[1:23:16] to do that you will be changed from
[1:23:19] glory unto glory that change will happen
[1:23:22] you will see the love of god manifested
[1:23:25] in your life more than you've ever seen
[1:23:26] it before
[1:23:28] and you know what all the glory will go
[1:23:30] to god because there's nothing you can
[1:23:32] do to manifest agape love
[1:23:34] except get out of the way
[1:23:36] get out of the way and let god have his
[1:23:38] way
[1:23:40] amen
[1:23:42] we must repent
[1:23:44] when we repented we got baptized that
[1:23:46] was just the beginning
[1:23:49] but we must continue to walk in the same
[1:23:52] humility that we had then amen that's
[1:23:55] right amen remember how humble we were
[1:23:58] we're so
[1:23:59] grateful for god's grace we're willing
[1:24:01] to do anything
[1:24:03] you got to walk in that daily
[1:24:07] and anytime we get away
[1:24:10] from humility we're getting away from
[1:24:13] god
[1:24:15] because god still resists the crowd
[1:24:18] i remember when god was dealing with me
[1:24:20] and god was asking me to do certain
[1:24:22] things before i'll tell you i was
[1:24:24] resisting
[1:24:27] and even now
[1:24:28] when god's dealing with this if you
[1:24:30] can't see your flesh resisting
[1:24:32] uh god
[1:24:34] and he's trying to tell you to do
[1:24:36] something you're not paying attention
[1:24:39] because there's a battle going on in
[1:24:41] your flesh and your spirit are in are in
[1:24:45] are they're in a battle
[1:24:47] so god resists the proud he giveth grace
[1:24:50] to the humble
[1:24:54] at any time a seed of god
[1:24:57] can get away
[1:24:58] from pleasing god
[1:25:02] so who cares
[1:25:04] who cares
[1:25:06] if you feel like your seed
[1:25:09] why don't you care about pleasing
[1:25:15] you can get away from doing the will of
[1:25:17] god you can fall into pride and
[1:25:19] arrogancy and become judgmental and
[1:25:21] uncaring
[1:25:24] and still be a predestinated seat of god
[1:25:29] but you will not stay in that condition
[1:25:33] here's the difference
[1:25:36] you'll get out of it you'll say this is
[1:25:38] not what i'm predestined to i should be
[1:25:40] giving glory to god through my life
[1:25:44] so if you're predestinated
[1:25:48] and you find yourself in a
[1:25:50] bad condition what should you do
[1:25:55] repent it's that simple the same thing
[1:25:57] you did at the beginning
[1:25:59] and through that you'll get out of that
[1:26:02] and you'll start
[1:26:03] loving others
[1:26:05] you'll start living for others it won't
[1:26:07] be a you won't be a child of wrath
[1:26:10] you'll be a child trying to bring
[1:26:12] someone closer to christ
[1:26:16] ii chronicles chapter 7 verse 14. just
[1:26:19] keep repenting keep repenting keep
[1:26:21] repenting keep looking for things to
[1:26:24] repent for now that was in my notes
[1:26:27] uh brother jonathan and he brought out
[1:26:29] in our men's meeting that when we're
[1:26:31] praying we need to ask god is there
[1:26:33] anything in my life
[1:26:36] that you want me to to to deal with
[1:26:40] and i think that needs to be important
[1:26:43] to us because it is important to god
[1:26:47] so second chronicles chapter 7 verse 14
[1:26:51] reads if my people oh seed of god
[1:26:55] pretty destitated see you to god got
[1:26:57] that right off the right off the bat
[1:27:00] these are not the devil's people
[1:27:03] but my people which are called by my
[1:27:06] name
[1:27:09] are you a jesus believer
[1:27:11] are you in the message this is this is
[1:27:13] you then
[1:27:14] shall humble them themselves
[1:27:19] you mean
[1:27:20] i
[1:27:21] i can't
[1:27:22] just do what i want to do if i'm i'm
[1:27:24] god's people what else that matters
[1:27:28] shall humble themselves and pray and
[1:27:30] seek my face and turn
[1:27:32] from their
[1:27:33] wicked ways i'll just say your will
[1:27:36] if it's not god's will your will is
[1:27:39] wicked
[1:27:40] it may not be murdering somebody but
[1:27:42] it's still wicked to god amen
[1:27:45] so we have to turn from our will
[1:27:47] then will i hear from heaven
[1:27:51] in other words seek ye first the kingdom
[1:27:53] and then i'll pay attention to you
[1:27:56] and will forgive their sins and will
[1:27:59] heal their lands what the requirement
[1:28:02] four things humble yourself pray seek
[1:28:04] the faith turn from the wicked ways
[1:28:06] then god will build his image in his
[1:28:09] people
[1:28:12] we don't have time to get into it but in
[1:28:14] jude it says i i want to remind you
[1:28:18] that after god had saved his people out
[1:28:21] of the land of egypt afterwards
[1:28:23] destroyed them because they did not
[1:28:26] continue to believe
[1:28:30] so many people want salvation
[1:28:32] but they're not interested in the
[1:28:34] process of coming into his image because
[1:28:37] it requires dying out
[1:28:43] oh my
[1:28:45] time just just goes by so quickly
[1:28:52] do you want to dwell with god
[1:28:56] you have to learn how to dwell
[1:29:00] in heavenly places because that's where
[1:29:02] christ is at
[1:29:04] the bible says it's a secret place of
[1:29:06] the most high
[1:29:08] god is not going to stoop down to your
[1:29:11] haughty arrogant proud unthankful spirit
[1:29:16] we have to learn to sit in heavenly
[1:29:19] places with christ amen now how do we
[1:29:21] get there how do we get up there
[1:29:24] the way out there
[1:29:26] is down there
[1:29:28] [Laughter]
[1:29:30] humble yourself will get you up there
[1:29:33] amen
[1:29:34] isaiah 57 15
[1:29:37] for thus saith
[1:29:38] the high and lofty one the one that
[1:29:41] inhabit it eternity whose name is holy i
[1:29:46] dwell in the high and holy place
[1:29:51] here's where we come in
[1:29:54] with him also
[1:29:57] that is of a contrite
[1:30:00] and humble spirit
[1:30:03] to revive what's repentance for to
[1:30:05] revive to get back
[1:30:08] to give life to that's what that word
[1:30:10] revive means
[1:30:13] to revive the spirit of the humble to
[1:30:16] revive that word means to restore or
[1:30:20] quicken the heart of the contrite ones
[1:30:25] repentance does that
[1:30:28] your self-righteousness and your
[1:30:30] greatness does not do that
[1:30:32] it does not bring god on the scene
[1:30:36] your humility
[1:30:38] is what brings god on the scene
[1:30:40] god doesn't dwell with a haughty
[1:30:42] arrogant proud unthankful spirit even if
[1:30:45] you're predestinated
[1:30:49] god will resist the proud as long as
[1:30:51] they're proud
[1:30:52] he even hates a proud look
[1:30:55] be careful about the look you got on
[1:30:56] your face
[1:30:59] at any given time
[1:31:04] god will continue to give more grace to
[1:31:06] the humble to be changed into the image
[1:31:09] of christ
[1:31:10] you know and i'll say this
[1:31:14] brother branham often rededicated his
[1:31:17] life to god
[1:31:19] now he's a prophet
[1:31:20] that means he often humbled himself said
[1:31:23] i've come short of where you have called
[1:31:27] me to be that i see in the scriptures
[1:31:29] what you've spoken to me i haven't been
[1:31:32] hitting the mark
[1:31:34] i'm going to rededicate my life i'm
[1:31:36] repenting that i haven't done that
[1:31:39] it's okay
[1:31:41] to repent every time you come to church
[1:31:45] it might be old-fashioned to hear it but
[1:31:48] it's the genuine truth of god it's okay
[1:31:51] to repent every time it's to be expected
[1:32:00] how else we're gonna come into the image
[1:32:02] you know there's a whole group of people
[1:32:03] that are deceived thinking that somehow
[1:32:05] on rapture morning i'm gonna doesn't
[1:32:07] matter the life that they're living that
[1:32:09] somehow they're just going to be in the
[1:32:12] image of christ
[1:32:15] and have no understanding of how to even
[1:32:17] get there
[1:32:19] having little understanding what that
[1:32:21] image is
[1:32:23] when god gives us opportunity every day
[1:32:25] when we rub shoulders with one another
[1:32:28] when we go to work when we're in our
[1:32:30] homes
[1:32:31] and we think it's no big deal how we
[1:32:33] talk to one another how we act what we
[1:32:35] say i'm telling you these are
[1:32:38] opportunities for us
[1:32:41] to grow our character to become more in
[1:32:43] his image and get further in the process
[1:32:49] see time
[1:32:50] is up
[1:32:54] but i want to at least read a quote and
[1:32:57] this you know what's weird is always
[1:32:59] telling brother mark i had like
[1:33:01] nine pages left i think from last time
[1:33:05] i just tore those thrown away and
[1:33:07] started all over
[1:33:10] this this subject
[1:33:13] the more you dig into it
[1:33:15] the more it opens opens up
[1:33:20] now brother brandon said in the sumerian
[1:33:22] church age he said unless
[1:33:25] we suffer
[1:33:26] we cannot reign
[1:33:28] with him now the reason
[1:33:30] i'm reading this
[1:33:32] oh
[1:33:33] give will you give me just a few minutes
[1:33:36] okay romans chapter 8 verse 14. let's
[1:33:38] just pick that up there for as many as
[1:33:40] are led by the spirit of god they are
[1:33:41] the sons of god for for ye have not
[1:33:45] received the spirit of bondage again to
[1:33:48] fear god does not want us to be in fear
[1:33:53] like we're not going to come into his
[1:33:55] image
[1:33:56] but ye have received the spirit of
[1:33:58] adoption whereby we know who our father
[1:34:01] is
[1:34:02] the spirit itself
[1:34:04] bears witness with our spirit that we're
[1:34:08] a seed of god
[1:34:10] and if we're a seed of god where air
[1:34:13] heirs have got joiners for christ if so
[1:34:16] be
[1:34:18] why is he putting us in here if so be we
[1:34:21] suffer with him
[1:34:23] why is that in there why does it have to
[1:34:25] be in there
[1:34:26] because there's no way you'll come to
[1:34:28] manifestation without suffering
[1:34:32] you can't believe yourself into the
[1:34:34] image of christ
[1:34:38] you have to prove your faith
[1:34:43] you have to have the attitude
[1:34:45] of joshua and caleb and get the giants
[1:34:48] out of your life
[1:34:52] so it takes suffering and if you suffer
[1:34:54] with him
[1:34:56] that we may be also glorified together
[1:34:59] now i love this verse for i reckon
[1:35:02] that all the sufferings that i got to go
[1:35:04] through to get these giants out of my
[1:35:05] life
[1:35:06] are not worthy to be compared with the
[1:35:08] glory that's going to be revealed in
[1:35:11] us
[1:35:14] not you know up there in us
[1:35:17] for the earnest expectation of the
[1:35:19] creature waited for the manifestation of
[1:35:22] the sons of god they're waiting for us
[1:35:24] to start manifesting this
[1:35:27] so brother brandon says in the search
[1:35:29] age now quite after this quote unless we
[1:35:31] suffer with him we cannot reign with him
[1:35:34] you you have to suffer to reign
[1:35:37] and the reason for this is that
[1:35:40] character simply is never made without
[1:35:43] suffering
[1:35:44] now remember characters are anything
[1:35:46] we're taking with us
[1:35:48] so character he said is a victory it's
[1:35:50] not a gift
[1:35:52] so don't expect it to be given to you
[1:36:00] a man without character can't reign
[1:36:03] because power apart from character
[1:36:05] satanic but power with character is fit
[1:36:08] to rule
[1:36:09] and since he wants us to share his
[1:36:11] throne on the same basis that he
[1:36:13] overcame and to sit down with the father
[1:36:15] then we have to overcome to sit with him
[1:36:18] now how did he overcome
[1:36:20] he died out to the death of the even to
[1:36:23] the death of the cross
[1:36:25] that's how he overcame
[1:36:27] because his will said father if it's
[1:36:29] possible let this cup pass from me
[1:36:31] but he overcame he didn't yield to what
[1:36:35] he didn't want to suffer he he went
[1:36:38] beyond that and he gave himself if this
[1:36:40] is what it takes to manifest love
[1:36:42] i'm going to do it
[1:36:48] and
[1:36:48] the little
[1:36:50] temporary sufferings
[1:36:53] that we go through now
[1:36:55] i like he said the little temporary
[1:36:56] sufferings you know every little fight
[1:36:58] that we had with everybody
[1:37:01] just right now we're in a state where we
[1:37:02] can look back and say that is just a
[1:37:04] little nothing
