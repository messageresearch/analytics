[2:59] with faith we ask
[3:01] give you praise now for all this we ask
[3:03] in jesus christ's name
[3:05] amen amen second corinthians chapter
[3:10] number three and we're going to read the
[3:11] first six verses there
[3:20] do we begin again do we begin again to
[3:23] commend ourselves
[3:25] or need we as some others epistles of
[3:29] commendation to you or letters of
[3:31] commendation
[3:32] from you ye are our epistle written in
[3:35] our hearts
[3:36] known and read of all men for as much as
[3:39] ye are manifestly declared to be the
[3:42] epistles of christ ministered by us
[3:46] written not with ink but with the spirit
[3:49] of the living god
[3:51] not in fables of tables of stone but in
[3:53] fleshly tables
[3:54] of the heart and such
[3:58] trust have we through christ
[4:01] to god's word not that we are sufficient
[4:05] of ourselves
[4:06] to think anything as of
[4:09] ourselves but our sufficiency
[4:13] is of god who has
[4:16] made us able ministers
[4:19] of the new testament not of the letter
[4:22] but of the spirit for the letter killeth
[4:25] but the spirit giveth life amen god
[4:28] bless you
[4:29] you may be seated we say amen to the
[4:32] word of god
[4:34] amen we want to
[4:37] have for a subject overcoming walls
[4:40] when witnessing overcoming walls when
[4:44] witnessing and
[4:44] the question our fifth question here
[4:49] is how to overcome a wall
[4:53] when you want to witness to someone
[4:57] but you always seem to hit a roadblock
[5:01] to actually speak to the person about
[5:05] the lord
[5:08] i'm going to read it again how to
[5:10] overcome a wall when you want to witness
[5:12] to someone
[5:13] but you always seem to hit a roadblock
[5:15] to actually speak to the person about
[5:17] the lord
[5:19] do you want me to read it again are you
[5:20] going to say amen okay i'm paying
[5:22] attention to you i just want you to know
[5:24] that i'm not up here
[5:25] by myself we're together
[5:29] now i will say this um i love these
[5:31] questions
[5:32] um because
[5:35] they help us get get answers to become
[5:39] better for the lord now some questions
[5:42] um can be taken a couple of different
[5:45] ways or a few different ways so the more
[5:46] specific we could be about our questions
[5:48] so more will be able to accurately
[5:50] answer them
[5:51] for us so keep that in mind next time we
[5:55] do have uh
[5:56] questions and answers and if i do say
[5:59] something
[6:00] that when we do bring up one of the
[6:02] questions that you ask
[6:03] because i really don't know who's for
[6:05] the most part they are unless
[6:07] somebody says something um and we don't
[6:10] quite hit it right you know please come
[6:12] and talk to me we can
[6:13] have another chance to get what you
[6:15] really mean
[6:17] but as we were reminded last wednesday
[6:19] the way
[6:20] we conduct our lives and how we handle
[6:23] situations in front of others
[6:25] is a witness to others
[6:28] brother branham made mention this
[6:30] statement and questions and answers he
[6:32] said
[6:32] just live your sermon
[6:36] let your life be your pulpit
[6:41] let your life be your pulpit so we all
[6:45] of a pulpit at that point to minister
[6:47] from we're ministering out
[6:49] from us amen but the brother
[6:53] or sister here is referring to actually
[6:56] speaking
[6:56] to a person about the lord so we talked
[7:00] about our life being a witness but this
[7:01] person is actually
[7:03] talking about speaking to this person
[7:05] about the
[7:06] about the lord this person has a desire
[7:10] to witness but there's a road
[7:12] block there is a wall that's standing
[7:15] in the way from them actually doing the
[7:18] witnessing
[7:20] the answer to how to overcome this
[7:22] depends
[7:23] on what the actual roadblock and wall is
[7:28] for instance if the robot is a temporary
[7:31] thing just like
[7:32] when we see roadblocks in on roads
[7:35] the road is is is cut off for a little
[7:38] bit you can't go on it they're doing
[7:39] repair work
[7:40] eventually the road's going to be opened
[7:42] up
[7:44] so a roadblock it could be
[7:47] something temporary and something that
[7:50] is out of our control
[7:52] they got the road shut off we just can't
[7:54] be going through
[7:55] we've got to respect the signs we've got
[7:57] to wait so
[7:59] if this is a situation we have to wait
[8:02] till god
[8:03] removes this the road block
[8:06] it could be somebody's on a different
[8:08] shift you can't quite
[8:09] get with them every time you try you
[8:12] they're they're
[8:13] they're away they think something is
[8:15] keeping
[8:17] uh that's out of your hands
[8:20] keeping you from making the connection
[8:23] and so it's a robot
[8:25] it's a wall and brother branham taught
[8:27] us that we have
[8:28] to just let god open the door let god
[8:32] make the time right uh
[8:35] and and he will if you keep that desire
[8:38] there you keep praying
[8:40] uh he will take care of his part because
[8:42] he's wanting us
[8:43] to do our part
[8:47] ecclesiastes chapter 3 verse 1 says to
[8:49] everything there is a season
[8:52] and a time to every purpose under the
[8:54] heavens so there is a
[8:56] a right time for it verse 11 he have
[8:59] made
[8:59] everything beautiful in his time
[9:02] also he set the world in their hearts so
[9:04] that no man can find
[9:06] out the work of god that god maketh from
[9:08] the beginning
[9:09] to the end so every god's got everything
[9:11] under control
[9:14] now while you're waiting for the block
[9:16] to be removed
[9:18] get on to another road
[9:22] and witness to somebody while you're
[9:24] waiting
[9:26] it is the will of god for us to witness
[9:29] to the world
[9:30] and not only that the whole world or the
[9:33] whole heaven
[9:34] is behind us witnessing to the world
[9:37] jesus said work while it's day for the
[9:39] night cometh
[9:40] when no man shall be able to work
[9:43] i i think spirits are getting so dark
[9:46] and heavy and hard
[9:48] it's just hard for people to get
[9:50] motivated you know they're too
[9:52] swallowed up in their own life and their
[9:54] own problems and just their own
[9:56] desires that it it's hard
[9:59] to really work efficiently for the lord
[10:02] and it's getting harder by the day
[10:04] we're living in the closing hours of
[10:06] time we see that
[10:07] iniquity is abounding and love is
[10:10] diminishing as the bible said waxing
[10:12] cold believers
[10:14] are not able to bear the complete word
[10:17] or as we learned
[10:18] endure sound doctrine so it's just
[10:20] getting harder in this age
[10:23] we're told that we're living in perilous
[10:24] times people
[10:26] are mocking your stand for the word
[10:29] they belittle you they make fun of what
[10:32] you believe
[10:34] and as some uh become more relaxed
[10:37] we're becoming more of an oddball
[10:40] because they're wondering why you aren't
[10:42] so
[10:42] relaxed and liberal you're holding on to
[10:46] the word so you're more of an oddball
[10:48] than we were 20 years ago
[10:51] as some believers are fighting over
[10:54] their reputation
[10:55] you just look at a lost brother or a
[11:00] sister
[11:00] and you're trying to help them and and
[11:03] and it's
[11:04] it's just it's just it's odd because
[11:07] people got
[11:07] their own different views and i i i'll
[11:10] say
[11:11] brother mark uh was bringing up a
[11:13] message that brother brandon preached
[11:15] about the door to the doors and brother
[11:16] branham
[11:16] said hard question have you opened every
[11:18] door uh
[11:20] to the lord because most
[11:23] brother brandon makes a statement that
[11:24] most everybody would like
[11:26] uh god to be their their savior
[11:30] and to to keep them from a hell of fire
[11:33] but who is interested in allowing god to
[11:36] control their lives and
[11:37] i think that's where there is such a
[11:40] difference in this
[11:41] hour but but souls are at stake
[11:45] amen we need to be witnessing one soul
[11:48] is worth ten thousand worlds
[11:50] and when brother brennan went beyond the
[11:51] curtain of time and he saw those souls
[11:53] they kept coming to him and they kept
[11:55] saying oh my precious
[11:57] brother it wasn't just one or two
[12:02] but it seemed like everybody viewed
[12:04] brother branham
[12:05] as not just hey bud
[12:08] hey bro but he was a precious
[12:12] brother i want to say today i don't
[12:15] think we should be waiting till we get
[12:17] to the other side
[12:18] to be sharing our precious brother to
[12:21] one another
[12:22] our precious sister to one another
[12:28] i think we ought to feel the same way
[12:34] he felt a love there that he couldn't
[12:36] completely
[12:38] understand he couldn't completely
[12:41] explain it and it moved him
[12:45] to give more of his life to god
[12:49] by having that experience it caused him
[12:52] to change
[12:54] that one visit there made him a
[12:56] different person in the message the
[12:57] rejected king
[12:58] brother adam said there's no way to
[13:00] explain it there's no way
[13:02] i just can't do it but whatever you do
[13:05] friend
[13:07] lay aside everything else to get perfect
[13:10] love get to the spot where you can love
[13:12] everybody even your enemy and everything
[13:14] else so we see this little parties
[13:16] wanting us to go after perfect love
[13:18] but but not just so we can just uh
[13:22] feel that we don't have hate towards
[13:24] anybody not for that purpose just to say
[13:26] we've
[13:27] overcome uh hating somebody no there's a
[13:30] reason for it
[13:31] he said that one visit there to me has
[13:34] made me a different man
[13:36] i could never never never be the same
[13:38] brother branham as was
[13:40] whether the planes are rocking whether
[13:42] the lightning is flashing whether
[13:44] the spy has a gun on me
[13:47] whatever it is it it doesn't matter
[13:50] he said i'm going to press the battle by
[13:53] the grace of god for i preach the gospel
[13:55] to every creature
[13:56] and every person that i can persuading
[14:00] them to that beautiful land yonder so
[14:03] now we're starting to see the motive
[14:06] of love
[14:10] it's not about me it's about hey
[14:12] whatever you do don't miss it lay
[14:14] everything you got going in life
[14:16] lay it aside put it aside and focus on
[14:18] this one thing
[14:20] get to a place where you got perfect
[14:21] love you can love everybody because
[14:23] you will have a burden to get everybody
[14:26] into heaven
[14:29] you want to be a better witness
[14:33] he said it may seem hard it may take a
[14:34] lot of strength i said i don't know how
[14:36] much longer we got
[14:38] and a quote it is the perfect love that
[14:42] will cause us
[14:43] to persuade people to that place in
[14:47] heaven
[14:49] that's why we need to get the love of
[14:51] god amen
[14:53] it's the only way we'll be an effective
[14:55] witness
[14:56] we need to start laying more things
[14:58] aside
[15:01] not saying i've left
[15:04] things aside or i've left more aside
[15:07] than my neighbors
[15:08] or more aside than so and so in the
[15:11] church
[15:13] let's compare ourselves what what
[15:14] brother branham said
[15:16] do we have perfect love if we don't have
[15:19] it
[15:19] then we need to start laying more stuff
[15:21] aside
[15:22] it's like when the boat is you've heard
[15:24] about there's so much stuff in the boat
[15:26] you got to like start getting stuff out
[15:28] of the boat
[15:28] to survive i think we got to just start
[15:31] letting more stuff go
[15:33] so we can get more perfect love amen
[15:36] amen
[15:37] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 11
[15:39] knowing therefore
[15:40] the terror of the lord we persuade men
[15:46] want to be a better witness
[15:50] get to know the terror of the lord the
[15:52] seriousness of god
[15:54] the repercussions of the lord
[15:57] that will cause you to want to persuade
[16:01] men more
[16:02] to be more of a witness verse 14 says
[16:05] for the love of christ constrainteth
[16:08] us because we thus judge that if one
[16:11] died for all
[16:12] then we're all dead knows we're not our
[16:14] own anymore we belong to god
[16:18] we're witnessing for him he bought us
[16:21] and by god has become our master
[16:25] we used to be our own master well we
[16:27] thought we were but we're really belong
[16:29] to the devil
[16:30] doing exactly what he wants but now
[16:32] since god bawled us
[16:34] we have a new master yes we're set free
[16:37] from the flesh we're set free
[16:39] from the devil but we have a master
[16:41] that's jesus christ
[16:42] whatever he says we do now if we don't
[16:46] want to do what he says
[16:48] we don't want to do what the devil says
[16:52] we're still doing what the devil wants
[16:54] us to do
[16:56] as long as we're not doing what god
[16:59] wants us to do
[17:01] now outside of your heart
[17:05] your time is the greatest asset that you
[17:08] can give back to god
[17:10] people will give their heart to god but
[17:13] they won't give their time
[17:15] they won't give their money they won't
[17:16] give their resources to extend god's
[17:18] kingdom for his eternal purpose
[17:20] but they say they give their heart
[17:24] when christ redeemed you at calvary he
[17:26] purchased not only your salvation
[17:29] but he purchased your heart which is
[17:32] your life your time your talents your
[17:35] resources
[17:36] everything that you have now belongs to
[17:39] god a new owner
[17:41] amen amen um i am
[17:44] pretty sure i'm pretty sure
[17:48] usually when you buy a company
[17:51] you buy all of it
[17:55] you take the assets and you take the
[17:57] bills
[17:59] you buy the name you buy the whole
[18:01] shebang
[18:05] christ wants all of you amen
[18:08] and he he deserves all of us because he
[18:11] gave all of him for us
[18:13] in the message the queen of sheba
[18:14] brother ben says i'm just telling you
[18:17] that it's not only worth your money it's
[18:20] worth your time
[18:21] your life your devotion and everything
[18:24] you
[18:25] are if it's right your testimony
[18:28] all that you are it's worth every bit of
[18:31] it because
[18:32] it cost what he had to bring it
[18:35] to you
[18:39] colossians chapter 3 verse 1 if ye then
[18:41] be risen with christ seek those things
[18:43] which are above
[18:44] where christ sitteth on the right hand
[18:46] of god set your affections
[18:48] on things above none of the things are
[18:50] we have a choice here friends
[18:53] we have a choice where we're going to
[18:54] put our affections our desires what
[18:57] we're going to do with them
[18:58] we either set them on things above or we
[19:01] set them on
[19:03] things of the earth
[19:06] we have to live down here we have to
[19:07] work down here
[19:10] but we don't have to
[19:13] set all of our affections down here
[19:17] for you are dead and your life is hidden
[19:19] with christ so we need to
[19:21] seek things which are above don't feel
[19:24] like you have them
[19:25] seek them seek those things which are
[19:29] above where christ is at
[19:33] where christ is at it's a the right
[19:36] there that there's a responsibility that
[19:37] we all if we don't do that
[19:39] we're either feeling like we already are
[19:41] there
[19:42] no need to seek more or
[19:46] we're just being too lazy either way we
[19:48] don't want to do that
[19:50] in the message god manifesting his gifts
[19:52] brother man says if god is god
[19:54] he's worth everything you are
[19:58] if christian religion is right it's
[20:00] worth everything that you can do
[20:02] for it support your church
[20:06] support your pastor amen amen
[20:11] support your missionaries do
[20:14] everything that's in your power to do
[20:18] and give god the best
[20:21] that you got
[20:25] too often we can make church all about
[20:28] us
[20:31] now church is for us but it's not
[20:35] only for us so bring somebody to church
[20:41] that's where you really prove what you
[20:43] think about church
[20:46] we've been commanded by the chief
[20:48] commander
[20:50] to go yell amen and to
[20:53] all the areas of the world and win souls
[20:57] be a witness to the rest of the world
[20:59] it's not
[21:00] just the pastor's duty
[21:04] it's all of our duty brother brad says
[21:07] do everything that's
[21:08] in your power to do and give god
[21:11] the best you've got
[21:15] if the door is closed right now to one
[21:17] person turn your thoughts
[21:19] towards witnessing to another person
[21:24] don't put all your eggs in one basket
[21:27] keep pressing on for another soul do
[21:29] everything in your power
[21:31] to do god will bless you if you do
[21:36] now one thing we can do to bring more
[21:39] people to church
[21:41] and it's a great way to show our support
[21:45] to the church is when we bring somebody
[21:48] come and see come and see
[21:53] well i'm sick of telling people come and
[21:56] see
[21:58] they don't listen to me
[22:02] so i'm just going to come myself
[22:06] you're losing the vision without a
[22:08] vision the people perish
[22:11] i understand it's not easy but we don't
[22:13] have anything in the scriptures where
[22:15] jesus told his disciples
[22:17] hey just lay loath you know take it easy
[22:19] if that nobody listens to you
[22:22] brother branson in the message why he
[22:25] said they ought to support that church
[22:27] with everything they got in them
[22:29] with their ties with their offerings
[22:32] with anything
[22:33] they're called to do
[22:36] be willing and happy if your pastor
[22:40] asked you to do something in your church
[22:43] you should
[22:44] do it so i was going to get that in bold
[22:47] letters and
[22:49] and make sure that you know when you
[22:50] come in the office
[22:52] this is the first thing that you see
[22:56] not only be willing but he said be happy
[23:01] i love that put your heart into it
[23:05] we believe here in a body ministry it's
[23:07] not just the pastor
[23:10] brother branson the message do you now
[23:12] believe he said now to the laity
[23:14] we can't have a church lest we've got
[23:16] the laity
[23:18] you know the pastor can't do it all it's
[23:21] got to take some members
[23:23] in the church
[23:26] of course we're not all up here at the
[23:28] pulpit but we don't need to be to be of
[23:30] a good
[23:31] church that's functioning what we've got
[23:33] to believe is
[23:35] we what we've got to do is believe
[23:36] what's being said at the pulpit
[23:41] brother said the message god provided
[23:43] away he says go to church every day
[23:47] every day that you can every day that
[23:49] they have
[23:50] service go attend your church
[23:54] be real loyal just stand
[23:57] by your church stand by your pastor help
[24:01] him
[24:01] out with everything you got
[24:05] give him spiritual support fast and pray
[24:09] for him
[24:10] and have faith in him god will lead the
[24:13] church on to that glorious day
[24:15] that we're looking forward to come amen
[24:23] if some of these quotes require
[24:25] responsibility
[24:28] but if we let the devil in the church
[24:30] there will be division
[24:35] it's true
[24:39] our vision here at sunderlight should
[24:41] always
[24:42] be maintained amen and that's for souls
[24:46] to be saved amen
[24:48] this must be our number one priority
[24:52] is to win souls and they that win souls
[24:56] is wise
[24:58] if we move away from this priority we're
[25:01] going to eventually
[25:03] die spiritually i'm just saying it like
[25:06] it is
[25:07] too often as individuals we lose that
[25:09] vision we make church only
[25:12] about us and letting our burden
[25:15] for others kind of slip away
[25:18] brothers we can feel like churches for
[25:20] me to support me
[25:22] and my family and my needs and my wants
[25:25] church should be comforting me and
[25:27] encouraging me and helping me and
[25:28] praying for me and giving
[25:30] to me well that's good
[25:34] that you have a clear
[25:38] a clear view of what church should be
[25:40] for you
[25:42] but we can become so wrapped up in
[25:45] ourselves
[25:48] that we don't use what god has given us
[25:51] to multiply jesus gave us a good parable
[25:55] for that
[25:56] amen don't be afraid
[26:01] of losing what god's given you
[26:04] the only way that you'll lose it is by
[26:07] keeping on
[26:08] holding to it
[26:12] give your time and god will multiply you
[26:17] we don't want to get our priorities out
[26:19] of order
[26:21] brother man says we come to church to
[26:22] find out where we're at with god
[26:25] not to not to prove that we've always
[26:28] been right where we need to be with god
[26:32] notice i'm going to come to church and
[26:34] i'm just going to only thing i want to
[26:35] hear
[26:36] from from the pulpit is that i'm right
[26:38] yes
[26:41] i understand that we come to receive
[26:43] great blessings from the lord that's why
[26:45] we come to church
[26:46] but a great blessing
[26:51] is being able to move forward in god's
[26:53] will
[26:57] god is wanting us to move forward he
[26:59] told the children of israel
[27:01] when they were crying when they were
[27:03] ready to die when they were facing
[27:05] death when everything was against him
[27:07] there was no hope
[27:08] and god told moses to tell him tell the
[27:10] children of israel
[27:11] to move forward amen
[27:17] and they're like what do you mean move
[27:18] forward there's nowhere to go
[27:20] believe believe in your situation
[27:26] i don't care what the roadblock would be
[27:28] i don't care what the hurdles would be i
[27:30] don't i don't
[27:31] care what the wall would be move forward
[27:34] it's got to be
[27:35] that way
[27:39] the reason that we can feel like church
[27:41] has come short of us
[27:43] is simply because we've made church too
[27:46] much about us
[27:48] and not enough about him
[27:51] jesus said when you seek
[27:54] first the kingdom of god and his
[27:56] righteousness
[27:57] then all other things will be added to
[28:00] us
[28:02] we've got to put god first
[28:06] we got to be interested in what he wants
[28:09] us to do
[28:10] instead of feeling that we always know
[28:12] what he wants us to do
[28:14] how is church going to ever become
[28:16] personal to you
[28:17] if you're already doing what he wants
[28:19] you to do and you're never open to what
[28:21] he wants to show you
[28:25] god unquestionably will use this
[28:27] ministry
[28:28] to bring about perfection i believe that
[28:32] way beyond me god will not let this
[28:36] ministry come
[28:37] short of making a way for us to make a
[28:39] rapture
[28:41] i just don't i just i don't believe that
[28:45] god is faithful to his word and as long
[28:48] as
[28:49] we do not become the head of this church
[28:52] god is going to have his way in the
[28:54] church
[28:56] the problem we should be concerned about
[28:58] is wanting a ministry
[28:59] that fits our flesh that's what we
[29:03] should be worried about
[29:04] a ministry that caters to what we think
[29:09] focus yourself more on the ministry that
[29:11] god has given you
[29:13] since you become a christian what is
[29:15] that the ministry of reconciliation
[29:18] we should be interested in reconciling
[29:20] others to christ you want to get the
[29:21] the heart of god be concerned
[29:25] about others
[29:26] [Music]
[29:29] christ manifested in your flesh
[29:33] reconciling others to christ
[29:36] you taking what you hear from god here
[29:39] and go
[29:40] live in it out there that's what needs
[29:43] to be happening
[29:46] we must get back to god's eternal
[29:48] purpose
[29:50] that's the vision that this church
[29:52] started with years ago
[29:55] by the grace of god we're going to
[29:57] finish the course with this same vision
[30:00] we're not going to get away from it
[30:01] we're not going to go on to something
[30:02] that we think
[30:03] is different or or greater or better the
[30:08] thing that needs to become greater
[30:09] and better is we need to die out and let
[30:11] christ have more of his way
[30:13] but we need to keep the same vision we
[30:15] need to be in love with souls that don't
[30:17] know christ yet
[30:19] in love with our enemies
[30:23] i hope you join forces with me
[30:28] now i'd like to take a different look at
[30:30] these so-called roblox
[30:34] that we seem to hit how to overcome a
[30:36] wall
[30:37] when you want to witness to someone but
[30:40] you always seem to hit a roadblock to
[30:42] actually speak
[30:44] to the person about the lord
[30:49] now what if this wall is only
[30:52] a wall in your mind
[30:56] what if this roadblock is inside of us
[31:00] what if it's a mental roadblock you ever
[31:04] had
[31:04] said that i just like had a mental
[31:07] breakdown a metal black
[31:09] i can't remember what i was going to say
[31:10] what i was going to do why i came in the
[31:12] room while i called you
[31:15] or it's a psychological wall
[31:18] right what if it's a spiritual battle
[31:21] that's happening inside of us keeping us
[31:22] from
[31:23] witnessing being effective it certainly
[31:26] could be
[31:28] and if it is i want you to go through
[31:33] again if you haven't if you already have
[31:36] the series the enemy within because this
[31:39] is really what's happening
[31:40] there is the battle is inside of you
[31:44] the more we can detect what's really
[31:46] happening in our minds
[31:48] the more we're going to be able to
[31:49] defuse the devil
[31:51] and the more we learn to humble
[31:53] ourselves the more we will defuse the
[31:55] devil
[31:56] he won't have anything to work through
[31:57] because we won't be listening to him
[32:00] and eventually we're going to be able to
[32:02] destroy him
[32:04] give him the word and kick them out amen
[32:08] so there is a lot in that now understand
[32:11] that we probably know the basics of this
[32:13] but
[32:14] we need to be practicing it more
[32:18] the more we practice it the better we'll
[32:20] become at it
[32:22] we're in a a constant spiritual warfare
[32:26] whether we know it or not
[32:27] we're in it
[32:30] and we must as soldiers learn to detect
[32:34] the enemy
[32:34] the greatest enemy that we have inside
[32:36] of us
[32:38] so when we hit a mental wall or a
[32:40] psychological
[32:42] roadblock what we're doing is we're
[32:44] facing
[32:45] emotional changes that are happening
[32:48] inside of us
[32:50] for instance we start out with the
[32:52] desire to witness
[32:54] then when it comes time for the rubber
[32:55] to meet the road our emotions keep us
[32:57] from moving forward
[33:00] the desire to witness is there but other
[33:03] thoughts have changed our intentions
[33:05] to move forward now
[33:08] psychological role block is a system of
[33:12] inter-related emotion changed
[33:15] ideas feelings memories
[33:18] and impulses that usually repress
[33:21] and that gives rise to abnormal or
[33:25] pathological behavior
[33:28] i didn't make that up that's something i
[33:30] pulled off the internet
[33:35] but the gist of it is that there's an
[33:38] emotional
[33:39] change in our feelings
[33:43] and our thoughts in our memories
[33:47] and it usually represses
[33:50] something that we once intended to do
[33:55] and gives rise to abnormal
[33:58] behavior so we end up not
[34:02] witnessing like we should be witnessing
[34:07] so what's happening is when we are away
[34:10] from the situation
[34:12] we can easily identify our desire oh yes
[34:14] i went to church
[34:15] i want to be a greater witness i listen
[34:17] to this message i'm just
[34:19] i'm really wanted to win souls for the
[34:22] lord
[34:23] and then when you step into the arena
[34:25] and you
[34:26] engage you're getting ready to engage in
[34:29] this witnessing
[34:30] because of thoughts coming into your
[34:33] head
[34:34] your feelings and emotions go over here
[34:36] and you're thinking all these things and
[34:38] all sudden you don't follow through you
[34:41] start acting abnormal like
[34:43] what am i doing here oh yeah i'm sorry
[34:46] you start backpedaling
[34:48] are you with me have you ever have you
[34:50] ever experienced this
[34:51] okay and this is simply because of
[34:56] negative thoughts that the devil puts in
[34:57] her head
[35:00] he puts thoughts in her head that are
[35:02] very negative
[35:04] these thoughts repress our true desire
[35:07] to witness and gives rise
[35:08] to acting abnormal we could say like
[35:12] paul said when i would go to do good
[35:14] evil is present or how to perform that
[35:17] which is good
[35:17] i can't find it so there's that
[35:21] battle going on right these thoughts
[35:24] that we get from the devil
[35:25] usually generate from some sort of fear
[35:31] some sort of fear about something fear
[35:33] of failure
[35:34] fear of rejection fear being turned down
[35:38] mocked laughed at fear of being looked
[35:40] at
[35:41] at a in a condescending way fear
[35:44] of losing a friendship or or a closeness
[35:47] with somebody
[35:49] and these many fears will
[35:52] manipulate us into an abnormal behavior
[35:56] keeping us
[35:56] from moving forward so i want to keep
[36:00] things simple
[36:01] and trying to find the answers to this
[36:03] don't you
[36:04] god is always hiding in simplicity
[36:09] in other words we will find god and the
[36:11] answer to our situation
[36:13] in a place that we don't think it is all
[36:15] right it's true
[36:18] just like he's coming an hour we think
[36:20] not he's usually hiding in a place we
[36:21] don't think
[36:22] right oh this i don't think i'm really
[36:26] going to get the answer here
[36:30] really god loves hiding
[36:33] in places you don't think right
[36:36] and he's constantly doing that he's not
[36:40] just with the way that we think his
[36:42] thoughts are higher than our thoughts
[36:43] his ways are higher than our ways
[36:46] he's wanting us to humble ourselves and
[36:49] trust him
[36:50] amen and that's where we'll find the
[36:52] true answers
[36:53] for our situations he's hid
[36:56] right in front of us right in front of
[37:00] us
[37:03] god can take simple things and confound
[37:05] the wise
[37:10] why we often miss the answers is because
[37:13] our pride
[37:14] says this is too difficult
[37:18] of a situation for the answer to be
[37:21] so easy yeah that's right
[37:24] so i won't even pay attention to what's
[37:25] being said in church right now
[37:27] because my situation is much more
[37:30] difficult
[37:31] and it takes somebody with a lot more
[37:34] you know intelligence
[37:40] i think the answer must be much more
[37:42] difficult for my situation
[37:44] or else i would have figured it out by
[37:47] now
[37:47] [Music]
[37:49] whereas humility says i could be wrong
[37:52] about how the answer should come
[37:55] i will seek it in a more simple way i
[37:58] will look for
[37:59] where my pride doesn't want me to go i
[38:01] will trust
[38:02] the lord amen
[38:06] second timothy chapter 1 verse 7
[38:12] timothy battled a spirit of fear
[38:17] just like we all do
[38:20] and paul makes this grand statement in
[38:23] verse 7
[38:25] for god have not given us a spirit of
[38:27] fear
[38:28] but a power and of love and of a sound
[38:30] mind
[38:32] amen are you happy and thankful for that
[38:36] and he said be not thou therefore
[38:38] ashamed
[38:40] of the testimony of the lord
[38:44] see that can bring a fear yeah
[38:48] you get ashamed of how you got to dress
[38:51] how you got to act that you got to go to
[38:54] church
[38:54] let you go to church you got to do
[38:56] things that the pastor i should do
[39:01] don't be ashamed of that testimony nor
[39:03] of me in my condition because he was in
[39:05] prison
[39:07] but be thou a partaker of these
[39:09] afflictions of the gospel according to
[39:11] the power
[39:12] of god there's power
[39:16] that comes to the rise when you're in
[39:20] the afflictions
[39:21] of the gospel god is with you
[39:26] so yeah you're suffering but yes you got
[39:28] power
[39:30] i would like to take a a quick look at
[39:32] these if i could
[39:33] power love and a sound mind we are
[39:36] needing power to keep the devil's
[39:38] thoughts
[39:39] from emotionally changing our direction
[39:41] when we go to witness
[39:42] we're needing a power we're needing a
[39:45] power to keep the devil
[39:46] from building psychological walls
[39:50] inside of us that really aren't there
[39:52] but we're believing they're there
[39:57] too often we try to witness without the
[39:59] holy ghost
[40:02] i got this handle i know what i'm going
[40:03] to say i've been thinking about it
[40:06] acts chapter 1 verse 8 but ye shall
[40:10] receive power after
[40:14] the holy ghost has come upon you and you
[40:16] shall be witnesses unto me both in
[40:18] jerusalem judea sumerian the
[40:20] other most parts of the earth
[40:25] god has not given us the spirit of fear
[40:28] but of
[40:29] power so the holy ghost is a
[40:32] power to witness
[40:36] when we're being led of the holy ghost
[40:38] to witness
[40:41] we will have power to overcome anything
[40:44] the devil throws at us
[40:46] and we won't be using excuses all the
[40:48] time
[40:51] is the difference between us witnessing
[40:53] and trying to do our best
[40:55] versus lord i'm serious about this fill
[40:57] me up the holy ghost so i can get your
[40:59] job done
[41:01] amen we need power to overcome the
[41:04] spiritual warfare
[41:05] that's happening inside of us
[41:08] second corinthians chapter 10 verse 3
[41:10] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[41:12] not war after the flesh for the weapons
[41:14] of our warfare
[41:15] are not carnal so what are we going to
[41:18] do
[41:21] we've got to pull down the strongholds
[41:25] we do that through god
[41:32] in other words i am not going to believe
[41:33] these lies that are being spoken to me
[41:36] these thoughts that are leading me to
[41:39] fear and all of a sudden i just can't
[41:40] move forward
[41:43] casting down it's just an imagination
[41:48] and every high thing that exalted itself
[41:51] against the knowledge of god
[41:53] well that could be as simple as well i
[41:55] just don't got time to witness i'm so
[41:57] busy
[42:01] and bring into captivity
[42:04] every thought to witnessing for christ
[42:10] you see i'm just kind of applying this
[42:12] scripture in this manner i hope that's
[42:13] okay
[42:14] and having a readiness to revenge all
[42:16] disobedience
[42:17] when your obedience is fulfilled god
[42:20] wants us to witness
[42:25] so we got to revenge that disobedience
[42:28] be ready to take that devil on and say
[42:30] it doesn't matter i ain't letting
[42:31] anything stand in my way i'm going to be
[42:33] obedient
[42:34] to what the lord wants me to do
[42:37] we really need the power of the holy
[42:39] ghost and life to follow through
[42:42] peter and all the the disciples were
[42:44] good examples of that
[42:46] they wanted to be some great witness for
[42:48] the lord
[42:50] and they they came to church you know so
[42:53] gung-ho in the flesh and wanted to be
[42:55] great and show who was what and
[42:57] when it came down to it
[43:02] they couldn't stand the test they
[43:05] couldn't be the witness that they really
[43:07] wanted to be
[43:10] and it's so glad that we don't have to
[43:12] learn that same thing we can just get
[43:13] serious about
[43:14] waiting on the lord and get the power of
[43:16] the holy ghost
[43:18] just get serious about that amen well
[43:20] brother john i already have the holy
[43:22] ghost so what's my problem
[43:23] the problem is we need the power of the
[43:25] holy ghost in our flesh that's what the
[43:27] problem is
[43:28] it's not a matter of do you have the
[43:30] holy ghost or don't you have the holy
[43:31] ghost
[43:31] it's a matter is the power of the holy
[43:34] ghost permeating out of your body
[43:37] and if it is you got what you need and
[43:39] if it isn't ask for god to come and have
[43:41] his way
[43:41] is that it's that simple amen don't make
[43:44] it complex
[43:46] god is hidden in simplicity paul got to
[43:49] the place
[43:50] with the holy ghost where he said
[43:54] none of these things move me
[43:58] he was willing to suffer and go through
[44:01] everything nothing
[44:02] was a roadblock or a
[44:05] a a a wall to him
[44:10] he let them do whatever they wanted to
[44:12] do to him
[44:13] and he still stayed there as a witness
[44:16] testifying of the power of god how it
[44:18] can change a man's life
[44:21] what greater witness could that be i'd
[44:23] rather have that than ever stand behind
[44:25] a pulpit
[44:26] i'd rather have it than ever stand
[44:28] behind a pulpit
[44:31] it's the life of christ in human flesh
[44:34] again
[44:37] we not only need power to overcome but
[44:39] we need love amen
[44:41] it's not giving us the spirit of fear
[44:43] but a power
[44:44] and of love the love of god romans
[44:47] chapter 5 verse 5
[44:48] tells us that the love of god is shed
[44:50] abroad in our hearts
[44:52] by what the holy ghost god has not given
[44:56] a spirit of
[44:57] fear but a power and of love it comes
[45:00] love comes with the holy ghost you know
[45:03] the problem
[45:04] so much with that doctrine that got
[45:06] hatched out
[45:07] if i got the holy ghost because i spoke
[45:10] in
[45:11] tongues or i did this or i did that
[45:15] what about i love what if i can love my
[45:19] enemy
[45:20] because the love of god is should have
[45:22] brought in our heart by the holy ghost
[45:25] which is given unto us
[45:29] i i didn't give our sister uh
[45:34] a number of scriptures at the end
[45:36] because i just wasn't ready for him but
[45:39] so we're going to put her to the test
[45:42] second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14.
[45:45] ii corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 for
[45:47] the love of
[45:48] christ constrainteth us because we thus
[45:51] judge
[45:52] that if one died for all then we're all
[45:54] dead
[45:56] are we dead are we alive
[46:00] and that he died for all that they which
[46:03] live should not hands forth live unto
[46:05] themselves but
[46:07] unto him which died for them and rose
[46:10] again
[46:11] that's where i want to get to wherefore
[46:13] henceforth know we know man after the
[46:15] flesh
[46:15] yea though we have known christ after
[46:17] the flesh yet
[46:19] now henceforth no we him
[46:22] we we we know him no more
[46:26] so i want to say this we know christ by
[46:29] the spirit that lives inside of us
[46:33] by knowledge not by understanding
[46:38] but by a living experience
[46:43] we can't know christ outside of a
[46:46] born-again experience
[46:49] yes we can get certain revelations and
[46:52] we can have certain experiences
[46:54] and we can testify that our shoes didn't
[46:57] wear out and
[46:58] that he gave us water out of the brook
[47:00] and
[47:02] we can have experiences
[47:07] but those things that happened to them
[47:10] never
[47:10] made them so solid that they were going
[47:12] to go into the promised land
[47:17] so those things are not what we're
[47:19] looking for
[47:20] the bride is not looking for that right
[47:23] we're looking for christ
[47:24] inside of us
[47:28] because he's going to take us into the
[47:29] promised land he's going to take us into
[47:31] a rapture
[47:32] he's going to perfect us he's going to
[47:34] bring us to the statue of a perfect man
[47:36] he's going to get us on top
[47:41] therefore if any of us are in christ
[47:47] we're different
[47:51] we're absolutely 100 percent
[47:55] different we're a new creature
[48:00] all the old things you're passed away
[48:02] behold all things have become
[48:04] new we're no longer doing the witnessing
[48:08] amen
[48:12] in the message a man running from the
[48:13] presence of the lord brother bran said
[48:15] this statement it's a constant
[48:16] burning of the fire and the
[48:20] love of god
[48:23] in the heart that sets you a fire
[48:26] and puts you out yonder with people
[48:29] making converts to christ
[48:32] i'll say it's hard to witness without
[48:35] the love of god
[48:38] something has got to allow you to stand
[48:40] there and get the tomatoes thrown at you
[48:43] get
[48:43] all different things happening to you
[48:45] but you just want to bring them to
[48:48] christ it's a love of god that's
[48:52] it's in your heart it's a constant
[48:55] burning brother branham said it isn't
[48:57] just
[48:57] well i'll take five minutes i'll take 10
[48:59] minutes and then the rest of the day
[49:00] i'll just do what i want to do
[49:02] you just can't get rid of it now i'll
[49:03] say if it's not there you
[49:05] we just need to spend some time with god
[49:08] amen with the thought process of god
[49:11] i want you to become more
[49:14] in my life i want to have more of your
[49:17] holy spirit i want your holy spirit to
[49:18] have more of the preeminent
[49:20] i want to be about the father's business
[49:23] i want to get back where i was at one
[49:25] time with you
[49:26] this is what has to happen amen we
[49:29] shouldn't have to wait to ask to come to
[49:31] the altar
[49:34] what we should do is be listening to
[49:35] what the holy ghost is telling us
[49:40] well i'll just do it when i get home
[49:41] okay i want you to do when you get home
[49:43] but
[49:43] are you doing it when you get home right
[49:48] get it do it to the point where you're
[49:50] you're constantly on fire
[49:52] you're bringing people to church you're
[49:53] witnessing to everybody
[49:56] this is what needs to happen one of the
[49:59] things that they overcame
[50:01] the devil with in revelations chapter 12
[50:03] remember they overcame by the blood of
[50:05] the lamb the word of the testimony
[50:06] and they love not their lives unto death
[50:09] so you've got
[50:10] either your love is for yourself right
[50:15] parts for christ there's the battle
[50:18] to whom you spend your time with
[50:21] where you're going love not your lives
[50:25] unto death that's hard amen that's right
[50:28] that's really truly hard
[50:31] we're all bombarded with i'm just going
[50:33] to give this a little bit i'm going to
[50:35] do this one thing
[50:36] and i feel like i've got my days
[50:39] duty-in
[50:43] second timothy 1 7 for god have not
[50:45] given us the spirit of fear but a power
[50:47] and of love and a sound mind
[50:51] amen god gives us a sound mind
[50:55] he gives us a stable mind a controlled
[50:59] mind by the holy ghost
[51:01] a sound mind comes from god
[51:06] not double minded not one minute i want
[51:08] to witness in the next minute
[51:11] there's a roadblock right true now the
[51:14] reason i'm saying it like this
[51:16] is we need to stand up against the devil
[51:20] who one minute we want to go in the
[51:23] right direction
[51:25] and in the next minute our
[51:28] our emotions are changing
[51:31] our our thoughts are changing our
[51:33] feelings are changing
[51:35] and we can't even figure out what's
[51:37] going on
[51:40] god is not the author of confusion
[51:44] god has given us a sound mind
[51:47] we understand that we may get rejected
[51:51] we understand we may get tomatoes thrown
[51:53] at us we understand
[51:55] the negativity and the consequences that
[51:58] are moving
[51:58] that come along with being a witness
[52:02] but it doesn't stop us from witnessing
[52:10] i don't know if i'm ready for that yet
[52:12] okay
[52:14] okay okay
[52:18] just let god know when you want to be
[52:24] because that's what he's called us to
[52:32] lay it all down that one visit
[52:37] behind the curtain of time made brother
[52:39] branham a different man
[52:41] amen just ask god to give you a little
[52:43] visit
[52:45] come and visit with you come and
[52:48] show you the value of one soul
[52:51] i'm sure if we were all able to go there
[52:54] and we saw somebody there that we won to
[52:56] the lord
[52:58] and they said you know if it wasn't for
[53:00] you i wouldn't have been here today
[53:05] think those thoughts
[53:08] you you notice none of them said
[53:13] you know you had to go through a lot to
[53:14] get me to get here but i finally got
[53:16] here
[53:20] it's over the battle's over my precious
[53:22] brother oh my precious brother we
[53:23] wouldn't be here without you
[53:25] focus on the result not what you got to
[53:27] go through to get there
[53:30] amen it'll be worth it all
[53:34] right our opening scripture not that we
[53:37] are sufficient of ourselves
[53:40] to think anything of ourselves
[53:44] for our sufficiency is of god so when
[53:47] we're thinking
[53:48] about witnessing and we're thinking
[53:51] about this psychological wall or this
[53:55] this uh hurdle in our mind
[54:00] it's not us doing the witnessing
[54:03] right it is god in us doing the
[54:06] witnessing
[54:08] so our sufficiency isn't of ourselves to
[54:12] do it
[54:13] we just gotta learn to get out of the
[54:14] way and trust god trust
[54:16] god that he will use us to bring forth
[54:20] the beautiful love and grace of jesus
[54:22] christ to others
[54:24] who also have made us
[54:27] able ministers we're able
[54:31] we're able to win we're able to witness
[54:35] not of the letter but of the spirit
[54:39] see the holy ghost inside of us the
[54:42] letter kills
[54:45] but the spirit gives life
[54:48] we've all witnessed that we've all been
[54:50] guilty
[54:52] of that we use the letter we use the the
[54:55] truth of the word
[54:57] but we're not using the love of the word
[55:00] supposed to speak the truth in love
[55:03] so we need the spirit that's what gives
[55:06] life in our witnessing amen
[55:08] and i tell you when you've got the love
[55:10] of god in your heart you've got the
[55:11] spirit of god
[55:12] you've got the power of god nothing is
[55:14] going to stand in your way because you
[55:16] really don't care
[55:17] what people think about you you don't
[55:19] care what's going to happen
[55:21] to you because of what you're doing the
[55:24] only thing that you're focusing on
[55:26] is how you can help that person that's
[55:28] all that matters
[55:30] because that's what god looks at
[55:34] god is not looking at is it going to
[55:35] hurt jesus when he goes to the cross
[55:38] or is it going to hurt paul to get these
[55:40] stones thrown at him
[55:42] no he came out right out and said it
[55:45] pleased
[55:46] the father to ruse him he told paul
[55:50] hey you're going to suffer many things
[55:52] to be a witness for me
[55:55] so we can expect it because it isn't
[55:57] about how
[55:58] easy our flesh gets it it's about
[56:02] winning that one person whatever it
[56:04] takes to the lord
[56:07] i tell when i stand before the lord i
[56:09] don't want to be guilty of not caring
[56:11] for souls
[56:14] being so stuck in my own life
[56:18] that i thought what i'm doing is more
[56:21] important
[56:22] i don't want to be i don't want to be
[56:24] there i'll be guilty of a lot of stuff
[56:26] but i don't want to be guilty of that
[56:28] right
[56:32] brother branham said that the word is
[56:35] going to become flesh again
[56:39] i like how first john chapter 3 says it
[56:42] and this is not the king james version
[56:44] but if you want to put that up first
[56:46] john chapter 3 verse 2
[56:48] my beloved now are we the sons of god
[56:52] and hitherto it have not appeared what
[56:55] we
[56:56] are to be
[57:01] doesn't appear as it appeared but we
[57:04] know
[57:04] that when he shall appear we shall be in
[57:08] his likeness
[57:11] and we shall see him as he is
[57:17] and everyone that has this hope in him
[57:19] he purifies himself as he is
[57:22] pure well this sounds like the very same
[57:25] desire that
[57:26] god had in the beginning when he made
[57:28] man let
[57:29] us make man in our image he has the same
[57:33] desire
[57:34] to see his image in humans
[57:41] so while he's wanting that what are we
[57:44] wanting
[57:47] the word will become flesh again
[57:50] the only question that remains to be
[57:53] seen
[57:55] is who will let the word of god drop
[57:58] from their head to their heart
[58:03] because up here there will not be any
[58:06] manifestation
[58:07] but when it drops down here it becomes a
[58:09] love affair
[58:14] we are not sufficient of ourselves to
[58:16] witness
[58:17] anything by ourselves but our
[58:19] sufficiency is of god
[58:21] and god has made us able ministers
[58:26] to witness no matter what stands in our
[58:29] way
[58:32] no excuses you've heard uh the bigger
[58:36] they are the harder they fall
[58:40] i'm determined i've made up my mind i'm
[58:42] going through
[58:44] amen psalms 1 8 or psalms 18 verse 26.
[58:52] no obstacle
[58:56] is too great or a roadblock too great
[58:59] nor a wall too great
[59:01] psalms 18 verse 26
[59:04] we are we're done we're not gonna be
[59:06] long tonight okay
[59:09] so if you haven't got anything out of
[59:10] the whole service you've got just a few
[59:13] minutes to do it's just a little warning
[59:18] right with the pier thou will show
[59:20] thyself pure
[59:22] but with the forward thou will show
[59:24] thyself forward
[59:26] for thou will save the afflicted people
[59:29] but will bring down
[59:30] high looks for thou will light my candle
[59:34] the lord my god will enlighten
[59:37] my darkness for by thee
[59:40] i have run through a troop
[59:44] and by my god have i leaped
[59:47] over a wall it's not standing in our way
[59:53] as for god his way is perfect
[59:57] the word of the lord has tried he is a
[59:58] buckler to all those that trust
[1:00:01] in him for who is god save the lord
[1:00:05] or who is a rock save our god
[1:00:09] it is god that girdeth me with strength
[1:00:13] and maketh my way perfect
[1:00:17] he maketh my feet like hein's feet
[1:00:21] he sitteth me upon the high places he
[1:00:25] teacheth my hands to war
[1:00:29] think about that he's teaching us
[1:00:33] tonight how to war
[1:00:36] so that a bow of steel is broken
[1:00:40] by my arms amen they that wait upon the
[1:00:43] lord shall renew their strength amen
[1:00:45] thou has also given me the shield of thy
[1:00:47] salvation
[1:00:49] and thy right hand have holded me up and
[1:00:51] thy
[1:00:52] gentleness have made
[1:00:55] me great his gentleness
[1:01:00] thou has enlarged my steps under me
[1:01:04] that my feet did not slip i
[1:01:08] have pursued my enemies
[1:01:13] that's inside of you i have pursued my
[1:01:16] enemies
[1:01:17] and have overtaken them neither did i
[1:01:19] turn again
[1:01:20] to they were consumed
[1:01:24] amen god bless you let's stand together
[1:01:26] i hope some things have been said to
[1:01:28] help
[1:01:29] overcome the walls when witnessing
[1:01:42] amen let's sing lord i have started
[1:01:45] i'm going through i am going through
