home amen amen turn with me if you would to the book of second Timothy tonight chapter 3 and really appreciated those songs worship and music our worship leaders amen amen just a real blessing for all of us amen amen we're going to begin reading in 2 Timothy chapter 3 uh starting with verse number 10 but let's just look to the author before we begin to read father we want to thank you for watching over us in our travels to get here this this evening we thank you for for protection Lord we need you we can do our our best but Lord we we still need thine angels to to take the wheel to protect us to be the very driver of our vehicles we just thank you for your grace Lord we know that you brought us here for there's a particular purpose a reason know that you have something for us Lord as it's already been stated Lord we just trust now that our hearts have been prepared through the our time in prayer and and through the worship Lord that we're ready to receive the engrafted word this evening father May there just be one thing spoken to each of us that would help us in our journey with you Lord there's certainly things that in our heart and directions that we're we're wanting and you to take care of things and Lord may you give us faith for those help us Lord this evening not to miss uh the word that you would have to help our lives father pray your blessings now on your people upon your word as we commit the service to you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen 2 Timothy chapter 3 starting with verse number 10 but thou has fully known my Doctrine manner of life purpose Faith longsuffering charity patience persecutions afflictions which came unto me at Antioch ionium listra what persecutions I endured but out of them all the Lord delivered me that's right yay and all that will live Godly in Christ Jesus are going to suffer the same persecutions but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them and that from a child thou has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which in Christ Jesus all scripture is given by inspiration of God and is profitable for Doctrine for Repro for correction for instruction in righteousness that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works amen God bless you you may be seated may the Lord just open this word to us today we want to entitle this message profitability profitability Proverbs 14:23 says in all labor there is profit in all labor there is profit but the talk of the lips tendeth only to peny or poverty we might interpret that so there's one thing to hear the word and another thing to do the word am just hearing it it's going to be like poverty to us spiritually but to actually labor to enter into the rest I like how the scripture says let us labor to enter into God's rest I like I like to view it like this where is God resting where is God resting because you the devil's out as a Roy lion and he's attacking the bride and he's attacking the church and all these things are happening but where is God resting where's his safe place it's in his word amen and and and Paul says let us labor to enter into God's rest the same place where God's resting we can rest Amen brother bam says we come to church to learn or to discover where we're really standing with God Jesus said the scriptures tell us who God is and if we're truly in the place of eternal life and he gives the scriptures in John 5:39 search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify of me and ye will not come to me that you might have life so there's so many people who who do not search the scriptures they just go to church right they're depending on what's being said and of course uh a preacher that just wants to build the church or get money or their focus is on people they're not going to share all the word they're just going to share what the people are really liking are you with me but but there's we need to live by every word of God so we need to search the scriptures it's in the scriptures and and the and the and the Bible says that the scripture is given by the inspiration of God the scriptures are our only absolute amen it is the pure unadulterated perfect complete word of almighty God in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God and and it it will never change it can't be approved upon it can't get better over time amen and you you you can't reason with it you can't kind of make things better you just can't Psalms 119 says forever oh Lord Thy word is settled in heaven amen Jesus said Heaven and Earth will pass away but my word shall never pass away Proverbs 1:19 says Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path the word of God is what we need it's profitable for our lives it's profitable for our lives it is a lamp to show us you know I understand that your particular situation isn't in one of the scriptures in the Bible like there you'll never find a scripture that says um trusted tool is is going to be on U over there and the house is going to be over there and you're going to be make making cookies this day and you're going to get them to your customers that day and you're going to have a problem over here and you're going to get sick no it doesn't say that but it it gives what you need how to handle whatever is going on Amen it is profitable handle it and I don't care if you don't got no money I don't care if you don't got no friends I don't care what you don't got the word tells us what we need to do that we may profit in our situation we're not left in a place that we don't have help we don't have to say well God's word don't work I need to profit myself that's the worst thing that's what we came out of Amen I mean you look at Saul we talked about Saul Saul was a man who profited himself is that what he said he profited that's the word he used but he had to counted all loss he had to give up all his profit that he might gain Christ and that's putting your trust in the scriptures amen Jesus said in John 12:46 I am come a light into the world now remember the word is a is a lamp to our feet a light to our path I have come a light into the world that whosoever believeth on me should not abide in darkness so the the fact that we come to church hear the word God does not want us to remain in that condition he wants he wants us to take the word and walk in the light amen and if any man hear my words and believe not I judge him not for I came not to judge the world it's not the right time but to save the world but he says he that rejecteth me and receiveth not my words has one that judgeth him the word that I have spoken the same shall judge him in the last day am so it's better to walk in the light now than to walk in darkness and in the day of judgment light come and judge you amen condemn Me to Hell turn with me if you would or if any could put up there re uh Revelations chapter 20 verse 20 verse 11 Revelations 20:1 we're just trying to lay a foundation that the word is our absolute we need the word of God it we need to be dressed in it we we need to be that need needs to be the core of our home of Our Lives the decisions we make whether or not we're going to pay our ties come to church we need the word of God to be our absolute we can't just take part of the word and figure you know our idea and our reasoning is better than the word of God Revelation 20:1 says and I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heavens fled away and they there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is The Book of Life and the Dead uh were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in it and the de and death and Hell delivered up the dead were were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast in Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the Book of Life was cast into the Lake of Fire now notice I just want to say this this was one of the books that was there on the day of judgment it was this book this is the book that's there yeah we have a book with our names written on themen but we also have this book because this book is what everybody's being judged by the same book that we read by today amen the the the word of God the word that heaven and earth will pass away but my word will never pass away the word that I spoke unto you the same shall judge you in the last day what an honor it is just to come into church and hear the word of God being preached the same one that'll be spoken to everybody in the day of judgment Mal CH 4:1 for behold the day cometh that shall burn as an oven and all the proud yay and all that do wickedly shall be stubble and the day that cometh shall burn them up sayeth the Lord of hosts that it shall leave them neither root nor Branch but unto you that fear my name that that that that take the word of God seriously shall the son of righteousness arise with healing in his wings he shall go forth and grow grow up as calves of the stall I we're talking about growing in the things of God Amen and you shall tread down the wicked for they shall be ashes Under The Souls of your feet in the day that I do this sayith the Lord of hosts remember ye the law of Moses my servant remember which I commanded unto him in Horeb for all Israel uh with the statutes and the judgments remember now so so Matthew this is the last chapter now in the Old Testament and Malachi is is is reminding of reminding us here almost here at the end of the book at the end of the book I want you do you remember the law of Moses the the law I gave him on the on on the mountain well what did he give on that mountain he gave the Ten Commandments and these Ten Commandments were for the people to follow why is he saying that why is he saying do you remember my servant Moses I I I gave him the law for the people why because the next verse behold I will send to you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord he's coming with the same message here's the here's the things that you need to do to make it out of here to make it into your Promised Land and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse people wonder what so why was it so important to bring to have brother brandham why did God send brother brandham to the the to the Earth because if he didn't he would Smite the Earth with a curse that's right so the people that that don't understand the importance of of of the of the Prophet that God uh prophesied right here in the word of God that was to come before the great and Dreadful of the day of the Lord it is important to get into that message to hear the tapes and and not just to say you've listened to them or you got you know a little bit something out of it but but there's something in that word that's going to keep you from the curse I I I just want to let you know I'm kind of enjoying the word tonight I don't know if you are but I'm enjoying the word tonight second Timothy let's go back to our opening scriptures here we need the word of God we need the word that was sent in this hour because it opened up what this book that we're going to be judged by in other words when brother Brandon went beyond the um curtain of time and he's standing there and they told him you're going to be judged with your people right and he said will Paul be judged said yeah Paul's going to be judged that's right that's right it will Paul make it yes Paul will make it well he said you know I preach the same thing that Paul preached right here out of second Timothy he he said everybody all those that came in through this age said we're resting on that yes that's what we're resting on is that the prophet in this age really told us what the bible really meant opened it up to us we need it I wouldn't be here where I'm at without this message second Timothy chap 3:1 says this know also that in the last days perilous time shall come speaking of the Church of leoda for men shall be lovers of their own self bolsters proud disobedient to parents unthankful Unholy without natural affection truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good doesn't sound like a church full of good people does it traitors hady high-minded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a just a form of godliness acting like it but denying the power of the Holy Ghost from such you need to turn away don't be friends with that don't be friends with that don't hang oh yeah you know we just have a good time you know turn away from that don't let that Spirit get on you verse seven ever learning these people are ever learning but they're never able to come to the real knowledge of what the word of God means amen and he says here in in verse eight talking going back to Moses here now as Janice and jambus with stod Moses so do these these people that we're talking about the spirit that gets on people so do these also resist the truth they resisted men of corrupt Minds reprobate con earning the faith you try telling somebody this is what you need to do and they resist you it's the same thing as these two people that with stood Moses it's not outside there it could be right Among Us it's a spirit that will receive the word of God and it's not about identifying Bob or Ted it's a spirit that gets on Bob or Ted and when it's there you just you you you have to get away from that thing am you give them the word if they don't take the word you get away from it you keep your standard with the word of God you keep the scriptures because look we you know some of us dwell with and and have family members and and relatives and things like that that that that don't want to walk in on the word you need to you need to make it sure that the scriptures is is totally inspired to you you live by them they mean everything they are profit Prof itable for Doctor they're profitable for your life if they don't want to believe it they don't want to believe it that's up to them but it's important because God's looking at you and every man will be judged according to his works not your wives not your husbands not your mom and dads your works it needs to be that serious verse 13 but evil men oh these evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived there evil people are just going to get worse and worse isn't at the time I mean I mean they used to be in a closet what how many years ago now you're bad for being in a closet right you mean we talked about in in our our men's meeting that you're persecuted for being a Christian we read it right here in the scriptures you're literally persecuted for speaking about Jesus but they just are openly they don't care what they look like and they don't care if it they're women women men with men they they they don't care right out in the open I'm a boy I'm a girl I'm different every day I I sleep on a cat I I'm married to this that's okay to be in public and don't say anything about it but I'll p Ute you if you're a Christian you can tell it's the devil that's persecuting the Christian and it's up to us every day we take a stand Jesus said if you stand for me I'll stand for you you got to take a stand amen and sometimes that stand needs to be taken in our home in our workplace wherever it is take a stand let them know because one day Jesus is going to say where did you stand and you're GNA say well you you you you I went to that church you you he's going to play it right back where you stood make it clear where you stand now speaking of the Bride in our day here verse 14 don't get sucked into any kind of person that says to you you know it's it you don't have to do that that's deceived and deceiving you I don't care I'll just say like this if your pastor is off the word you either get him back on the word or get under a pastor who is on the word if I can say that about a pastor you need to be to say that about your friends and your family the word needs to be first in your life because God is looking at you if they fall off the bridge are you going to go if they're going to dilly dally around and just well that doesn't matter this doesn't matter get away from that spirit is not of Christ you know we we we entertain that thing and it'll bring you down it'll bring you down it'll put you in bondage verse 14 speaking of the Bride in our day now but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them and that from a child thou has known the holy Scriptures it wasn't by accident that you came across these which are able these scriptures are able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus I want us to recognize that Paul is speaking to Timothy the who is already saved at this moment so why is he making this statement that is able to make thee wise unto salvation because our Salvation hasn't happened yet until our last day how the tree falls that's the way it lies might be up straight for a long time but how it falls so I want to say yes we're saved but tomorrow we're going to get saved again because today is the day of Sal each day we are living for God we show God we're we're we're we're born again we're we got a different nature we're we want to get more like Jesus people who say that they're saved and they don't care how they're acting they're they're deceived they're deceived they're absolutely 100% deceived you don't want to you don't want to get in the scriptures and and search the scriptures for you in them you think you have eternal life there they testify of me what does the scriptures testify any man that be in Christ he's a new creature all things are passed away behold all things have become new amen the scriptures are the final absolute not our opinions amen so these scriptures are going to make us wise to that day of judgment did you know that this book was the most read book by Abraham Lincoln and he he read that from a child I'll say this to all the mothers and fathers mothers and fathers read the Bible to your children don't just say read the Bible read the Bible to them take the time say son daughter do you understand well they're only 8 years old so what Timothy read the Bible to them because now it's when they need it because when they go to school they don't get it when they're with their friends they don't get it they get on the computer they don't get it the TV they don't get it something's got you know the evil is grossing worse and worse and the bride has got to get their their their their children and their family into the word praise Goden all scripture verse 16 is given by the inspiration of God no matter how foolish it may sound it is given by the inspiration of God if God if if somebody slaps you on the face and the the inspiration of God through the scripture says turn burn your cheek it is inspired word of God it he'll take you through you don't sit there and say I'm not you're kidding I'm not gonna let that happen again you're going off a different word not God's word the word of God is inspired and we got to believe it's real it's alive it can take it can make an effect in our lives the Bible says it is profitable for Doctrine for reproof for correction for instruction in righteousness this this not why we come to the house of the Lord to be profited by the scriptures amen somehow in our life that we can become profited by them to and today I just say it like this is more of an awareness of how real the scriptures are to us they can really help our lives if we just get alone and get serious with God and what is the reason for all this that the man of God may be perfect thoroughly fished unto all good works so what is God going to do to every man on the day of judgment judge him according to his works and this word this word word can make your Works become rewarded rather than judged are you with me amen so just think about this we have the one book right here that will be there on the day of judgment right and it's able to make us wise unto salvation to bypass the Judgment I'll just say it like this if you just take the scriptures he that believeth in is baptized shall be saved if you just want to take that scripture say you repent you got baptized and you're saved and that's all you want to do you missed the real revelation of that scripture you might as well throw out the rest of the Bible take that pin it up on your wall and say I'm saved you might as well forget the rest of the word but Jesus said man shall live by every word of God so the other scriptures are just as important as that scripture we need all the word for salvation amen I'll say it like this I may not I may not live all the word of course we're human we make mistakes we fall we come short but the thing is to have a an attitude of I don't care is the same one Satan had when he decided to step out of his position when he left his own habitation we can bypass judgment we can be acquitted of our crimes while this book is going to judge and condemn the world this book is going to make the bride wise unto salvation this book right here is going to make her wise unto salvation the bride was not born ready we were predestinated to be conformed to the image of Jesus Christ amen so we're in the process of becoming just like him we don't sit there and say I'm predestinated I'm a Son of God and I'm a daughter of God and I'm there and then it doesn't matter what you're doing your character will never be developed you'll never be challenged the foolish virgin while they're with the assuming attitude that they're already ready they're ready enough the bride is literally taking the word of God the scriptures the inspired word of God and she's making herself ready for the Rapture the hearers only they're content with just coming to church and hearing the word this sounds good but the bride the bride is eating the book amen taking the book and eating the whole book amen just like John told am while churchgoers wrestle with the preaching I don't know if I like that preaching the bride knows that all scripture is given by the inspiration of God and is profitable for their lives while the leod deia church members feel it this need of nothing this attitude of I'm just good enough The Way I Am The Bride is being made perfect through Repro correction instruction in righteousness the bride is being thoroughly furnished unto all good works I understand when we come to Church there may be people who are just not getting into the word I'm okay with that but I'm telling you the bride is not going to miss the word she's not going to and I really don't care about the foolish virgin I don't care about the other two types of Believers sister ly I care about the bride God set the word for the bride he set the prophet for the bride you got to count yourself as the bride though none go with me still I'll follow this word means everything to me Jesus said in Revelations 22:12 and behold I come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according to as his work shall be he also said in verse 18 the scripture says for I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book for If any man shall add unto these things amen God's going to add him the plagues that are written in the book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life out of the holy city and from the things that are written in this book I think it's I think I I I think with those scriptures right there I remember brother Ron Brother Bruce before I came to know the Lord I read those scriptures and they put the fear of God in Me and I didn't even know God I think what the problem is there's too many people that they feel that they're saved you want to know why they think they're saved because they're looking back at some time they repented and got baptized and they're ignoring the life that they're living that day and they need to read the scripture because they've they've taken away from the word they're adding to the word to bring this feeling of I'm in need of nothing I'm saved amen why does the bride hunger and thirst after righteousness why can't the bride wait till the doors are open because all scripture is given by the inspiration of God righten does they want to see their life profited for Doctrine for reprove for correction and for instruction and righteousness that they may be perfect thoroughly for fished unto all good works you know I want to just talk to the to I want to talk to the attitude I'm not talking to people right now I want to talk to the attitude that says well you know I just have you know problems with that and it just you know that's just the way it is it's just just who I live with and it's just you know it's my boss and it's you know um I I just I just I got a problem with that I just I want to talk to that attitude for a moment is that not the attitude of I don't need to help that situation like I got enough going for me that I don't really have to worry about that I'm in need of nothing because I'm good here it's a spirit it's an attit ude and if you don't have the attitude that I need to get ready you need to get the Holy Ghost bottom line I think there's what the problem is there's too many people that don't get the Holy Ghost and they're trying to be a Christian and how there's never been a Christian without the Holy Ghost amen and there never will be I don't care how much you try amen the bride has a revelation that she must be sanc ified and cleansed with the washing of the Water by the word amen that's why she hungers for it she's got to get there she's been she has been revealed or it has been revealed to her that she's going to be presented by her husband to herself to him a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish that's right that is why people actually desired to get to church right there where understand Leo deia in need of nothing I'm there I'm there I'm there deceived and being deceived the scriptures are prop profitable for a life amen they are it doesn't matter the condition that your life is in doesn't matter how difficult things are it doesn't matter if you need financial help physical help marital help spiritual help emotional help it just doesn't matter the scriptures contain the answer to profit your life that's right amen your life can get profited if you take seriously the word of God Amen but if you're one of those people said well I tried it it didn't work well I'm sorry it don't work without faith I did have faith for how long the faith that you're needing is the faith that you will stay with it until it happens that's the faith that God's looking for the kind of attitude that we need to have the scriptures are profitable we got to apply them we just have to apply the scriptures if they're really going to profit our life and when we apply them to our life it proves that we really believe the scriptures because everybody says they believe right but until you start applying the word to your old life you don't believe it the life shows whether you believe or not the demons tremble amen amen take a brother like uh brother Marty Brother Bruce these brothers paying their tithes for I don't know 30 years 40 years Brothers faithful to the core core you think the devil can come to them and tell them you don't believe and pain ties but take someone who is part-time in playing ties oh yeah see it's the life behind the name that makes the demons tremble when you when you read that word and you obey the word it be you become the word and the devil don't know what to do with you amen but if you're like I I can't afford it this time and you know I got things going and well before you know it he can just talk you into anything in no time second Corinthians chapter 3:6 says God have made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter only but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life so I wanted to read the scripture because you know we look at this Bible is well just you know words you know on a paper and yeah there are dos and don'ts and you know love thy neighbor and you know go Second Mile and and they're like if we're not careful the letter will actually kill us and and condemn us because we're missing a love for the word but when you love that word and it means that God I want about to live this help me to live it Lord I really mean I'm going to spend time with you I'm going to pray I'm going to seek you God I'm not living it I want to live it you want to what's going to happen the spirit of God is going to come into you and give you Grace to live that word but it is not going to happen with an it doesn't matter attitude he only functions by faith and when you pray and you're asking God with confidence that he's going to do it he will give you the manifestation of the word the spirit is what gives you life amen we don't come into church and say well what you know what's the word what's this thing think I'm going to hear no I'm looking for the spirit of the word that's coming across the pulpit the spirit that's what's going to make you leave here differently in the right way in the right way Jesus said in John 663 it is the spirit that quickeneth for the flesh profiteth nothing but the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and their life amen so our our message says profitability if all you're going to do is try to use your flesh to have a relationship with God it's not going to profit you it's going to profit you nothing the world is full of people who got peacock feathers in them but what we need is a word spoken by God to our heart personally because that that has quickening power that will Quicken your life he said my words they are spirit and they are life so I understand you know here's here's the big thing I don't care how long we've been serving the lord and we had this conversation here in our men's meeting tonight that we need to stay in a spot where the Lord such a tender spot to where the word can be quickened to us it's awful quiet if we're going to just be in our flesh when we hear the word then even though we like the word we understand the word we can say Amen to the word it can't bring about a life out of us and so what we're really hungering for is God give me the spirit of this word inside of my life amen then I have everything that this has I have it in me well brother John I thought you had I thought you had the Holy Ghost well I'm going to tell you what I got a portion of it I have a portion of it and I know the prophet says you got you have enough in there that you could go and create a world and live on it that's right but I want I will not be satisfied until I see that word manifest in my life so either I got to die out cry out for more and there's you know Jesus gave us the instructions of the importance of dying out and I don't know if anybody's anybody if anybody's ever watched anybody die a slow death it is is something that you would never want to see it's one thing just a Boop done over but a slow death is painful to a Christian he dies daily amen it's a slow death you got to get in that prayer closet and you got to say Lord not my will but thy will be done because you're you get up in the morning and you just want to do your own thing so I'm telling you this the way of a Christian is hard but it's the only way that the the the God can be alive inside of us amen we read those scriptures didn't we in the men's meeting there in 2 Corinthians chapter 4 if you want to write that down around the verses 12 and 13 Isaiah 5511 says so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where un to I sent it that's now if Jesus said blessed are they that hunger and thirst in other words those that don't thirst are not blessed even though they hear the word they're not blessed because if you're hungering and thirsting look at if your children are are hungry James when you're hungry does your M did your mom and dad ever say you can't eat for a whole week never time for dinner we're all going out to eat when you're hungry you eat you want to eat when you're hungry now you ever been full it's time to eat but you just yeah it's not yeah look if if if if we if we can develop an attitude where it doesn't really matter if I hear from God personally you're not hungering to hear his voice speak to you directly God I'm serious okay you're not going to be fed but if you're hungry then he'll send you the word and it will prosper in the place he sends it it'll be profitable for your life I the worst case scenario is walking out of church with more joy because the joy of the Lord is your strength amen amen Paul said I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me don't try to do them yourself his words are life they'll Prosper your life they'll give you strength to do all things and the biggest thing is I think God wants us to see is the strength to do his will remember when Jesus was there in the garden and he he was suff he was just really contemplated not going to the cross it was just a battle that he was having that you go ahead and suffer and die and he said father if it's possible let this cup pass for me the Bible tells us that that that they that wait upon the Lord shall re renew their strength and he was in the right place to receive strength and when he made that decision not my will but thy will be done the Bible says Angels Came strengthen him God is here to strengthen if you want his strength I believe that with all my heart 1 Thessalonians 2:13 1 Thessalonians 2:13 for this cause also thank we god without ceasing don't stop because when you reive the word of God which he heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is truth the word of God which effectually worketh also in you that believe now that word effectually worketh means actively this word will live in you if you really believe it but if it's a a a carnal intellectual natural uh belief well then hey the devil's believe also it's not going to work it's not going to be active in your life so I'm all for you know learning the scriptures and quoting the scriptures but there should be a longing God oh I want to see this lived in my life I want to be faithful to the little things that you asked me to do Lord I want to get up in the morning and I want to mean business with you I want to I want to conduct myself I want to have a behavior that's pleasing to you Lord I want my family to be pleased with my behavior I want my church to be pleased with my behavior it it'll work in you if you believe it to be the truth Hebrews 4:2 says For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached unto them did not profit them not being mixed with faith my time is slipping away if we're struggling to make decisions or we feel double-minded sometimes we don't know what to do the scripture is profitable the scriptures can help us with that James 4:8 says purify your hearts you double-minded right there right there something's wrong so you're struggling get along with God get in prayer get your heart your heart forget the situation forget what you're trying to make a decision with but get your heart real pure with God and I'm telling you got to come in there and you'll have the mind of Christ our heart is directly linked to our minds when our heart is filled with the wrong things that can cause people to be double-minded and times we could be viewed as two separate people or acting two different ways the scripture has a solution purify the heart that's what I love the scripture is profitable for our lives God is able to get our thoughts in our mind straight when our heart is straight sometimes our heart receives a wrong Spirit we may begin to think evil about somebody or start to judge someone or allow the devil to bring up something from the past or begin to use our minds for a playground all these things can come and just start to stir things inside of us and before you know it we don't know what to do about anything don't know what to do don't know where to go don't know because because the heart isn't single we've allowed wrong things in and we don't even realize it that's why the Bible says we don't even know our own heart right we need the word of God to be spoken to us to say oh boy that's a light that's probably what's going on the scriptures tell us plainly our hearts if we purify our hearts it will help our minds if we fall in love with God that's a pure heart yes am the Bible already says the love of God thinketh no evil you all a sudden will get rid of that to to lay down your life love one another live for others so you get the heart right all of a sudden your thinking goes right it just the love of God's not going to allow bitter thoughts it puts a halt to strife and division it puts a halt to perit the devil to play around and have its way the scriptures are profitable to make the Christian complete perfect and ready for a Rapture if you feel worn out spiritually drained Jesus spoke a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not faint you know the hardest thing to do when you just feel spiritually weak is to pray you're you you're just not in the mood you're not in the mood but I'll just say this put some music on put some music on put your app on let let play some scriptures let the scriptures read listen to have Psalms just come into your ears just get alone and let the inspiration of God profit your life and then before you know it you'll have it just Lord I need you at this time get on your knees and let your strength begin to build Isaiah 40:29 says he giveth power to the faint to them that have no might increaseth strength even the you shall faint and be weary and the young men shall utterly fall but they that wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be wored they shall walk and not faint amen you're bombarded with confusion the scriptures are profitable if we're batt on anxiety and strife and we need peace the scriptures are profitable for us because the scriptures contain what we need to get out of the situation we don't stay in this turmoil situation and say well if God wanted to help me he would just do it no go to the scriptures what do the scriptures say to get out of it thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed upon thee because he trusteth in thee well brother John that's pretty oldfashioned I'm living in this 21st century is that what we're at right now you know time just flies by you know and you know I just I got a job and I got a family and I got this and you know I just I just can't keep my mind on the Lord that long okay so I got another scripture for you with that behavior Philippians 4:8 so if you're not keeping your mind stayed on him this is how the mind of Christ is let this mind be in you that was in Christ finally Brethren whatsoever things are true and honest and just whatsoever things are pure and lovely things that are of a good report if there be any virtue if there be any praise then you just concentrate and allow your mind to only think on these things if you you don't want to do that you don't want to believe that word then you're on your own there is no other I'm sorry you go to the doctor you take the pills you do what you want to do there is no antidote to get rid of the devil and anxiety than keeping your mind on the word of God and following the word of God God there's only one thing that can defeat the Devil and that is God and it has to be God in you the Living Word manifested in your mind and your heart amen these things verse nine these things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you here again Paul is saying the same words he's saying look I'm telling you the truth just do it stay with the word the word will take care of you I want the god at peace to be with me amen amen verse seven I want to hop up to verse seven we're closing and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and your minds through it has to be through Christ Jesus that's we do all things through Christ we have peace of mind through Christ I'm telling you Saints let's Stand Together the scriptures contain what we need for a profitable life amen we don't need to look anywhere else we don't need to put effort in anything else we don't have to take part of the word out amen before we just sing some choruses let's look to the Lord in in prayer and let's just all bow our our our hearts at this time father as we come before you today today we want to thank you for preserving your word the place in which you rest you let us know that even Heaven one day is going to pass away but your word is still going to be remaining you value your word above everything and your your bride will become the Living Word they are word in seed form but they will be the manifested word of God they will be manifesting you at your coming Lord we're asking you today would you please help us in our personal lives would you bring to us our our thoughts to make this word more important to us than than it's ever been to make sure that we're giving you the preeminence and that we spend time with you in prayer in that secret place just alone with you giving you opportunity to speak to us uh in the spirit because you said your words are Spirit in their life these your your words that are Spirit life they've been written on these Pages called the Bible the same book that will be standing at the day of judgment but God we're here today asking that that word would be in spirit form in our lives we'd be able to live it out that we be a to share it with others that we'd be concerned about The Souls of others I pray that you bless every brother here every sister I pray Lord that you bless those that are on the live stream at this moment of course those that will be watching in the archives afterwards Lord if it's in their heart the sincerity that they want this word to become the thing that profits their life I pray that you would help them and show them what they need to do to see that Prosperity see that profit and whether it be their health or their finances or whatever part of their life that it might be in please bless each one Lord for we ask these things and we thank you for them now in Jesus Christ's precious name amen amen amen let's sing by his word I'll Prevail amen by his word I'll Prevail by his word I'll never fail by
