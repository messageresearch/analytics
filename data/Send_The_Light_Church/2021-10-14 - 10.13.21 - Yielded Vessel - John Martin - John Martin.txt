TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the terrible thing about being gifted because he liked that other angels were looking up to him instead of realizing that god had created me that way and the only way i'm here and not there is because god created me here and not there so no wonder he drew a third of the angels away from god just with his his brightness i mean can you imagine some hobo some um um bomb some person comes in here with or comes into knocks at your door at your house i'm saying and he has a bent up car and he comes in he says i want to be a financial advisor for you you're going to say no thank you no thank you i'm a little bit better off than you are if satan was just this black and dark when he was up in heaven i don't think a third of the angels would have went with him he had an ability he was gifted and all around him could see it lucifer enticed the most subtle beast to bring forth a seed that would be more intellectual than his limited abilities because remember this more subtle beast was nothing like uh adam and eve were created in god's image so he had the ability to convince that if you just uh if you just here he goes if you just you just have this act you all know what i mean because this thing's going on uh uh and and and you do this you'll be able to bring forth a seed that is more uh smarter than the one that you are and he knew that and that this lucifer had the ability to do that and this most self to obese he just lent himself over to the idea but then he comes along and he works on the other end with eve because the most left obese just you know had to be anointed with the same anointed to convince eve don't you know that you're going to be in control of your destiny and have all the many kisses you want to have you can have them whenever you want to you can be in control and that was brother brandon said she lusted for knowledge and he was telling her something different than what the bible what god was telling think about that that's why it's dangerous to want to hear something new all the time the only thing we should want new is christ new in me because it what i what i do have isn't getting the job done it ain't getting rid of the devil in my life and knowledge about new things just don't do it paul knowing how powerful how powerfully deceitful satan was and still is expressed his concern in second corinthians chapter 11 verse 3 he says but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his subtlety so your mind should be corrupted from the simplicity that's in christ you know all she had to do was just believe the word that's all she had to do but satan today has the ability to convince us that we don't have to do all the word and he does that because satan has a gift he has gifts he has abilities today and he uses them in our mind he gives us he shoots thoughts in there second corinthians chapter 11 verse 13. for such are false prophets deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of christ and no marvel for satan himself is transformed into an angel of light the bible says that satan corrupted his wisdom by a reason of his brightness he his his when god made him god made him perfect his wisdom was peaceable gentle easy to be true without partiality it was god's wisdom but because of his brightness it corrupted his wisdom into central devilish respect to persons trying to get something out of somebody you catching what i'm saying there's two different kinds he was more beautiful more brighter than all the other angels that god created verse 15 therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their works so his ministers look like ministers of righteousness think about this statement that we're hearing today god gives him a gift i mean we know the beatles we're gifted elvis presley was gifted there's many people gifted and they yield to that gift but they don't yield their life to god and so a minister can can minister just absolutely wonderful and beautiful there's just something there you'll you've got to be in tune you've got to be in to with the holy ghost yielding to our gifts and our abilities can have absolutely nothing to do with yielding our lives to god this message is about us yielding our vessel to god look at the concern paul had for those who were going to be left behind after he left in acts chapter 20 verse 29 keeping in this same vein here you know me laying a long foundation acts chapter 20 verse 29 for i know this that after my departure shall grievous wolves enter in among you not sparing the flock grievous woofs right in sheep's clothing they're going to enter right in amongst us and they do not care about the souls of others not sparing the flock they have something else in mind he said also of your own selves among us shall men arise speaking perverse things for what purpose just like satan drew a third of the angels the bible says to draw away disciples after them now notice this is a spirit it's not like oh it's obvious badge no they're spirits therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i ceased not to warn everyone night and day with tears this was a real situation a real thing it wasn't just oh here i just stick this little prayer request on our little app and you know no this was a real thing it taught him in tears of night and day it was a real thing because he cared he cared for the flock we can't look at gifts we can't even look at our own gifts we can't look at our own callings our own abilities we have to look at our life we have to look at the life that we're yielding to god every day that's what's important that's what god is interested in we can yield our gift to god the one that he gave us and not yield our heart to god think about that we all want god to use us right god use me god use me what about god have my heart because when god uses us we got a chance of somebody recognizing it we got a chance of feeling good but god used my heart lay down your life for somebody that everybody nobody will ever ever know the bible tells us that gifts and callings are without repentance but relationships i'm going to say but with relationships there's going to be lots of repentance jesus said be zealous and repent just just keep it part of your order always remember it's more important whom you surrender to than what gift you surrender to romans chapter 6 verse 16 romans chapter 6 verse 16 know ye not that to whom you healed yourself servants to obey his servant ye are to whom you obey whether of sin unto death or unto obedience unto righteousness didn't we sing a song today if you want to be great learn to be the servant whom whom think about whom there's just one of two trees we can be talking to hundreds of people we can be exercising lots of different gifts but whom is just one or two spirits are you with me tree of life tree of knowledge now notice we will always have a choice in whom we yield to now yielding to god isn't very easy when we haven't died to ourselves james said that the nature that's inside of us it lusteth for what it wants all the time it doesn't it just you can't turn it off you got to just crucify the old man jesus said we have to deny that nature if we're truly going to follow him the book of romans records that our carnal mind is an enemy of god and when we don't care enough to die out that we're in our flesh and when we're in our flesh we can't please god i mean these are some i know we like to just label i'm a christian i'm in the message i love god and let's just stay with that but this this this is we're digging in we're digging in the bride will be a totally yield vessel to god and only for god we could have a desire to yield to god but not as strong enough to actually do it now this is important we all have a desire to you to god but if that desire is not strong enough we just simply ain't going to do it how many times you hear you you talk to people oh yeah i like i i'd like to go to church i like to do i like to do that i i want to pray more i want to be more spiritual i want to help i want i want to want to want to want to that's not good enough it's not good enough to say well i desire to yield my life to god imagine for a moment if the three hebrew children said i really i really want to yield my life to god but i'm afraid if i'm going to suffer and die so it wasn't good enough that they just had a desire to you to god that's got to be strong enough that you're willing to suffer you're willing to die you don't know what's going to happen but you know god's with you now i think we're just very very soft brother branham said in this age just soft don't get don't want to hurt you know just don't step on anybody's toes be careful how you speak and i believe in talking with grace i believe in being a a christian and loving i believe that but i'm talking about we ought to have enough grace when somebody doesn't do something just right we ought to still better love them amen we also better treat them in such a way as if they never did anything wrong if they said you know what god knows my heart god knows i don't i don't want to serve other god but i can't die i can't do any good down here if i if i die you know what they would have did they would have bowed to the wrong god when we miss church and we can be here we're bowing to the wrong god when we have time to listen to a tape to read our bible to pray to go out witness to somebody and we choose a comfortable way we're bowing to the wrong god when you want to yield yourself to god it requires such a strong love for him that nothing can distract you from obeying his will we can have all sorts of gifts and abilities and a very little strength to yield her life to god because it's quite simple quite simple for all my christian uh life i before i was even a pastor for years i would see people that would just be so excited about doing specials it was just it was it was just something about being up in front of somebody doing a special but i just can't imagine how they would feel if god says i just want you to go do this thing doing it for the same god trying to bring him glory but why are we excited about giving god glory in front of people what is that that's the same thing lucifer had yes it's no different it's not about you and our gifts it's about yielding our lives usually it's easy and enjoyable to yield herself with a gift but when it comes time to lay down our lives for the cause of the word it comes quite difficult quite difficult i don't i don't got time to do that i'm busy you know what i i asked somebody two years ago to come to church and you know they just don't seem to want to come what are we called to john described this word coming into us as sweet amen amen amen amen to the word but bitter when it became a part of his life it's much harder to live this word than to to agree with it when a minister is preaching it from the pulpit yielding has everything to do with the choice that you're making what direction you're going to go often we don't yield to the lord because of our feelings our emotions our attitudes or our understanding now this i don't under i what do you mean be nice to this person who's being mean to me i don't comprehend that it's i mean hey look the publicans you know they're nice to those that are nice to him see if the feelings and emotions and everything lines up then it's easy to you to do what we would consider the right thing but oftentimes we don't yield to the lord because our our feelings our emotions things disagree with us inside internally so therefore we just kind of shrug it off proverbs chapter 3 verse 5 says trust in the lord with all thine heart and lean not to thine own understanding we will either lean or yield towards our understanding or towards the lord one or the other in all thy ways acknowledge him and he shall direct thy paths if we're looking for more direction in our lives it's real simple choose to trust this is what the scripture says we're not used to that we're used to just getting the answer without trusting we must choose to yield to god's way of doing things and his way of doing things he wants to be first you when you trust him you're yielding to him verse 7 be not wise in your own eyes don't try to figure it out but fear the lord and depart from evil it's evil for you to figure it out it is not evil for you not to know and to trust in god's time he will show you he will lead you he will make it known he just he's he's more interested in you learning to trust him than you are figuring out so you can go on are you with me it's all about a relationship remember when the lord showed peter that god was no respecter persons right that he was it wasn't just for the jews but it was for the gentiles first it was like no no i'm not going to ever eat anything bad i'm not going to pray anything wrong in me what would happen if he leaned to his own understanding he heard the word and he yielded to the word and he became the word remember when the lord was teaching brother brother brandon the same thing early in his ministry that god was no respecter persons when god told him to go preach the word go to the pentecostals and and go no we're not going to be associated with that remember that god is always teaching us not to be a respecter persons but look what happened he yielded to the wrong thing and look what it caused him that one we think it was well it was the will of god he went against the will of god how many times do we go against the will of god it's the grace of god that we're all families aren't destroyed god does not want us to be a respecter persons when the lord wanted brother branham to stop shooting deer for other brothers and sisters he could have leaned to his own understanding but no he yielded to what god said with his life and it was hard because he still had brothers and sisters coming up to him would you get me a deer you're going out there i know you're a good deer you know i don't i i'm just a widow i the lord said no we have a chance every day to you to the lord remember when the ministers wanted to know more about brother branham's gift that he used brother branham he yielded or leaned to his own understanding and he began to try to teach them and it got it got him in trouble all of a sudden there was impersonators everywhere come on up here i'll just pray over you yeah i got the same thing that yielding to the gift but wouldn't want to lay down their life just being a teacher at heart i've always wanted to try to help people understand brother brown was a great teacher he leaned to his own understanding and he tried to teach certain things that god told them to i'll say immature christians and god told them he says you can't teach pentecostal babies spiritual things think about this god called them pentecostal babies that you can't well we think spiritual is just you know slain in the spirit one end to the other and speaking in tongues and i wonder why god called him babies first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them why because they're spiritually discerned we have to be careful of trying to tell somebody something that they're not ready for how many times have you told somebody left right up down backwards front words every possible way they say yes i get it yes and they just don't get it the things have to come from god revelation comes from god remember when brother branham expressed that the jews knew the sign of a messiah and that he just he felt you know to go and tell those jews because he had so many people were rejecting in the gentile realm his gift he said all the jews they know this they know the sign of a messiah they'll receive it and he was in his thoughts and mind and heart and desire he leaned towards going there and giving them that sign and it wasn't until he was getting ready to get on the plane that god said don't go it's okay that we get off in 15 other directions that we shouldn't be going but understand that god is there speaking and it's our responsibility to yield to him to be a united vessel one that's adaptable ready to change instant in season and out of season ready ready for the service of the lord it's not about us just prepping and preparing for some special thing that i'm going to do this one time no it's 24 7. lord make me a vessel and use me for your glory and honor every day god wants to use a united vessel i just brought out all these things that happened to brother branham's life to show you that he wasn't exempt from this when god's trying to teach us this it isn't because we're down here and brother branham was up there no he went through the same experiences we just need we need to be real we can't just say i'm a universal because my name is john martin and i go to said the light church and i'm in the message that don't mean one thing don't mean one thing what's my life doing every day what am i yielding to every day am i yielding a vessel to him yielding has everything to do with choosing the direction that you're going so brother i was going to go this way and god said no go this way he healed it to it is that simple god will let us go in our way that we think is right for a season and then he'll stop it and er every way of a man is right in his own eyes that's the thing that we we need to be so careful with every single day we we feel we got the right thing to do we're going in the right direction to stay and remain humble i could be wrong about this that's a united vessel a vessel that says i could be wrong is a healed and vessel to god a vessel that's got it all figured out god doesn't make any one of us do things he will not be guilty of having any robots in heaven forcing anything but god will put us in situations to help us understand that we need to make another decision and jonah to me is a perfect example of that jonah had yielded to his way i'm out of here i'm not dealing with this responsibility and god put him in a situation that he decided to choose god's way i'm he's thankful for that our own understanding is limited it's lacking it's often distorted with emotions and our own agenda sometimes we got our own agenda we want to try to manipulate therefore it can be evil our own understanding can be evil and often is that's why the scripture says be not wise in your eyes fear the lord and depart from evil we can see it lucifer and he did a bad thing can we see it in ourselves because we're putting the same spot eutene has everything to do with choosing what direction you're going to take that's why it's always better to only believe instead of saying do you you know you got to understand it i'll never forget this brother brother johnson was sharing his testimony when he was being introduced to the prophet and he couldn't deny the miraculous things that were happening he was very high in the pentecostal ranks and he went to seek in the lord to find out what god wanted to do about this decision that had to be made about brother branham and he said well some say that he's just a a false prophet and and um he's just uh way off the deep end and some say that this fella he's god and lord is this man true i don't understand these things that he's saying and god spoke to him and said do not say i do not understand say i believe we don't have to understand we don't have to lean to that understanding of all we need to know is what does god believe it and yield to it i'm so glad when i came to this message i was not bombarded with having to prove everything that the prophet said i was stupid enough to believe it believe in the lord thy god so shall thy be established believe in his prophets and so shall you prosper believe believe don't lean to understanding a lot of times i i mean as you know i've had workers work for me and brother ron you've probably experienced this and me as parents maybe of all under of experiences to some degree when you ask somebody to do something if you have to tell them and explain to them why every time and then try to convince them that this is the right thing to do so imagine god don't owe us an explanation he don't have to explain everything just believe he's coming soon only belief let's talk about some ways to help us yield ourselves to the lord eating is as simple as making a choice yet it's as difficult as the temptation that sits before you if we have just to make a little choice we'll go to church on wednesday well that's easy to serve that's easy to yield to that if god says you know you're going in you're being faced with the fiery furnace god hasn't spoken to you what are you gonna do that becomes more difficult so think about the difficult trials that you have think about the times that you're getting screened at yelled at threatened think about these moments is the choice you have to make at that moment we all love god homie loves god but do we all love him the same degree do we no we don't but i believe shadrach meshach and abednego loved god with all their heart because they were able to yield their bodies in the most difficult situation now we're all in the process of becoming so in love with god that would do anything at any time at his will we're in that process and we're talking about how we can become a more yielded vessel for him in any of the ten commandments they don't say love god another ten commandments you cannot see where it says love god but it's the only way that you obey him in every situation deuteronomy 5 7 says thou shalt have no other gods before me this is the first commandment thou shall not have any other gods before me in order for me to fulfill that i have to love him why because my nature wants to love anything else that it wants so it's going to take love for that now lucifer wanted to be god isaiah 14 verse 12 says how are thou fallen from heaven oh lucifer's son of the morning for thou hast said in thy heart i will exalt my throne above the stars of god i will ascend above the heights of the cause i will be like the most high he wanted to do what he wanted therefore he became his god just by the mere fact of him doing what he wanted to do now we were born with the same nature and that's to do our will and when we do our own will we have put ourselves above god so if you don't want to turn the cheek you don't want to pray for those that despitefully use you you don't want to lay down your life for others i mean the list is endless you're putting yourself above god now this message is about becoming a united vessel now we're in the midst of this situation all these things are happening to us we we know what's right we know what's wrong we try to do good evil as president how do i get myself to yield to god god gave us an antidote to become a united vessel jesus never said you'll be fine with just a desire he says i love you i love the world you'll be fine he never said that he never said just keep trying turn over a new late make another resolution no sir he said you got to get bored again now it's important for us to search the scriptures to learn what that really means to be born again the new birth starts with accepting jesus christ into our lives by repentance and baptism confession jesus christ is my lord but the new birth ends with christ in complete control of your will so we we we have defined the beginning we have defined the end now in uh brother mark brought out that god placed a seed inside of us in our men's meeting and that seed was a germ of god and until that is fully manifested it's not where it needs to be so when we repent we get baptized in in the if we died that one moment we'd be born again as much as we could be job said i will not be satisfied with this until i awake over here in his likeness so to get from there to there something has to happen god isn't lacking the preaching isn't lacking the message isn't lacking the gifts that god has given us isn't lacking what's lacking a united vessel that's what's lacking getting here learning to you to the lord second corinthians chapter 5 verse 17 says therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature all things are passed away behold all things are become new how many can say that all things have become new all things all things i know most but all verse 18 in all things are of god all things in other words his will is completely being done every decision you make every direction you go every plan every goal all things are of god you have no control you're no longer in control of your life but god is who reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and he's given them to us a ministry now he's given us another responsibility no wonder we don't got time to get it done because we're still hanging on to our will but if you give up your will you've got time for god's ministry i just want to say this so you understand the new birth is an ongoing process in our lives yes it's there it's done but no it's not it's still happening because we need a balance so often we were comfortable with saying i'm born again i'm a born-again christian how about i'm in the process of growing every day like i wasn't yesterday i'm a new better i'm a new creature today than i was last week this to me is evidence of truly being born again even if we have been sealed with the holy ghost unto the day of redemption we are still in the process of all things becoming god's will for our lives until all things are of god i wish the whole congregation would have said amen to that because that to me just takes away every excuse that we have of not giving our all to jesus christ and pressing in for more of him if you're wanting to see more of god in your life we've got to get away from all the iniquities that are in our life psalms 51 tells us that we were born in sin shapen in iniquity formed into the evil creatures shape in other words um when we're born we're really not born doing iniquity because we don't know better yet we got to get to that age of accountability so as we're creeping up to that age we hit that age and after that age we're learning to be formed i was talking to a banker today's ahead of a bank and they merged with another bank and he told me he says 7 out of 10 businesses work their business under the table 7 out of 10. he said no i don't say nothing but i see it they tell me and this is what they're doing think about that born and sent shapen in iniquity simply and jesus said in the last days iniquity would abound what is that not doing what you know you should do and because of that the love of many would wax cold iniquity is here it's in our lives it's just it's being willing to look at it what are the things going on in my lifetime just does it matter ephesians tells us that we all had our conversations in times past fulfilling the lust of our flesh but in second timothy chapter 2 verse 19 the bible says never left the foundation of god sure having this seal the lord knows them that are his the lord knows now if you think you're his let everyone that nameth the name of christ do what depart from iniquity i'll tell you if i had to do this so many times i am a perfect candidate of this now when we think of iniquity we think of like some really bad things but if we want to be a united vessel to god we've got to we got to depart from certain things draw nigh to god he'll draw nigh to you we try to make it in and become the model christian through knowledge we're going to miss it because we've got to take these things that we're hearing and put them into use the next day and be eager lord you know when i'm being tested i want to pass this test the way to speed up this process in our life is to become a united vessel put away the things that you know that you don't think is that important god wants you to be doing put away that attitude put away the thought process this is not a big deal it's not a not a big thing fall more in love with jesus that's all i can say fall more in love with jesus that's the only way we're going to yield to them more i mean we can come to church and think it's a law i got to get here a half hour early so i'm here a half hour early or we can come here with a love get in the prayer closet get ahold of god get ready for the word so the word can fall on some good ground my my heart is not good because my name is john martin my heart is good if i empty out of my junk i get everything out i humble myself i repent i'm zealous i say lord take and squeeze every bounce of the world out of me then the word can fall on good ground god will not change us unless we hate ourselves thank you brother mark you may have to say amen for the whole church it's a little bit quiet today we've got to hate ourself to let the love of god come in they do work simultaneously change doesn't happen by coming to church doesn't happen by just listening to the word or you fill in the blank put it whatever you want to put in there change is a result formed from a love affair between you and god he said if you love me keep my commandments well i'm not going to come here today and preach to you the 12th commandment to get you to obey it so you can prove to god that you love him no we got to do the first ten but if you do the 11th commandment which really what jesus said was the first commandment which is what we're talking about is loving the lord it's a love affair where we put our love for what we want aside and we take up a love for what god wants us to do that's the way you become muted look we all can be just specialists and yield into a gift god gave me this gift and i'm going to yield to it what good will that do let's say brother jason had a gift of speaking in tongues and he could yield to that gift and speak in tongues what are we going to do spend 24 hours speaking in tongues that's yielding the gift we're talking about you in our life this is a completely different thought process here today deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 5 says and thou shalt love the lord thy god with all thine heart with all thy soul and with all thy might that's a lot now god will not come by every 10 minutes of your life and tell you don't forget love me don't forget love me don't forget love me you've got to make it to choice today what direction you want to move what direction you want to yield to and these words which i command thee this day shall be in thine heart this is the problem do we take the word home with us do we go home and say sweetheart this is what the word of god said this is what we need to do this is what i want our home to be we need to get filled with the love of god and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and thou shalt talk of them when thou sittest in thy house and when they'll walk us by the way when they'll lie us down and when that rises up love love love love that's it be good if we could just turn off all the other stations in our life and turn on loving the lord with all we have and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon thy hand and they shall be as frontlets between thine eyes and thou shall write them upon the post of the house and on their gates this love is the key to being able to become a more yielded vessel without it what are we going to do to at most yield our gift yield the gifts that god gave us that's that's it and the reason we're doing that is because we get something out of it but when you yield your life you don't get nothing out of it you're it's an expression of love to god there has to be a hate for yourself it's so strong and a love for him so strong it it can't be just i'll just try to love god a little bit more it'll never become united jeremiah chapter 29 verse 12 says then shall ye call upon me and ye shall go and you shall pray and i will hearken on you and you shall seek me and you shall find me when you shall search for me with all your heart we've got to yield the rest of the heart that we're not yielding to the rest of the life that we're not yielding to why is it a struggle when god speaks something to our heart and we just kind of ignore like not a big thing what's going on there we shouldn't have to like have a sit down meeting about something because we're having sit-down meetings with jesus it shouldn't have to be so like apparent that you know obviously there's a problem no a still small voice speaks to me right here he's wanting me to depart from this he's wanting me to clean up this he's wanting me to do this that's what a united vessel is it's not just going through the motions making it to church doing our daily thing a routine you know such a routine you know a routine you know what that is it's a denomination i believe that we need to daily pray but we need to make sure that we stay there long enough to get in his presence are you with me the bible says that god is love if you want to make more contact with god yield yourself to love god is attracted to love he just wants the love affair he doesn't want a bunch of oh i'll let him into the kingdom because they're obeying me he's got tons of angels for that he created him for that he's looking for a love affair somebody that's just like him he will prove you to see how much you're going to love him the thing i love about god is he doesn't care how many times you fall he's a merciful god he's full of compassion his mercies are new every day he knows our humanity he knows our frailness he don't care how many times we fall he cares if you're going to get up and keep loving him he cares if you're going to yield to him that's what a united vessel does yield your life like the three hebrew children did no matter what the cost was that's what that example was for they yielded their bodies to death paul did that he was facing death he wasn't scared sometimes we're afraid to love somebody because we're going to get hurt what where are we to be we're at the end of the age we're his bride there needs to be a greater expectation out of ourselves not to please the pastor not even to please one another but you having a vision to be his wife visual like yourself as someone that can stand there and be willing to suffer for him shadrach meshach and abednego they yielded their bodies that they might not serve nor worship any god except their own we're faced every day you know we're never going to be tempted to go to a satanist church we make gods out of so many things we don't need to go there turn with me to romans chapter 12. we have the same choice that they had before they went in the furnace and we're going to close with this to yield our bodies verse 1 romans chapter 12 i beseech you that means i invite you and i call you that's all god can do it's up to us what we're going to yield i beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of god that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy and acceptable unto god which is the reasonable service i mean you ever go to a restaurant and say how was the service oh it was reasonable you're like well i ain't very good i don't know if i'm going to go there but if you say yeah it's a great service and here it's it's the reasonable thing that we could do for god is is to yield our vessel to him and be not conformed to this world god is inviting us to a love affair he'll never cross through our agency we've got to make the choice but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of god yielding our vessel to christ is the hardest thing to do when we don't love him enough i'm not interested in us becoming better members that's not what this message is for this message is not so i can see you shine a little bit more at church this message is for you when you're not here between you and god because if we learn we learn to yield our life not just a certain aspects of our life or a certain talents or abilities but we yield our life to him he can do great things brother brandon said he could turn the world upside down with just one man yielded to him i want us because of because we're family to be a united vessel for the lord i want him to take us and if he wants to go do something that i don't feel like doing he should have liberty to go do that with my life i i don't want to just sit here in the blessings that god's given us when there's others out there that need to hear the truth what am i going to stand before the lord and say well i did my part who am i to say what my part is if god gives me another day of life he may want me to do something i've never done before so it behooves us to step away from depart from evil depart from our own way of doing things depart from iniquity and just love him hate ourselves love him learn to yield learn to yield you got something you have a hard time with spend a lot of time with him work on yielding to the lord through those times i don't want to stand there and face a fire i don't want to stand there and have some guy like this and say you take this or else we are going to face the these beautiful doors are going to be shut one day i don't know how it's going to happen when it's going to happen but i want to learn to yield my life today to god i want to have i want to have a right nature i want to better handle things the right way i want to better love my enemies i can't do it in my own abilities i've got to yield myself to god god has greater things better things the things that accompany salvation from his bride i believe let's stand together i told you that was the last scripture but i had one look but colt brother adam said in the message it wasn't so from the beginning brother man it says not because your father was something it's what are you every man's got to be born again and this sinful nature killed in him killed in him and a new man born in him which is christ jesus the son of god he's the new man that's born in us not what we're used to i repented got baptized i'm born again no born again is christ in me now i i want i want brother mark to say brother john i see christ in you we want people to seek not just three or four people but everybody right it's easy to get three or four people to see it see that in you but we want everybody i think that's what brother branham is referring to he says he says every man's got to be born again there's a sinful nature killed in him and a new man born in which is christ jesus the son of god then you surrender yourself completely to christ and christ comes in and writes a book of acts through you how i know that's the truth my friend how i know that's the truth i've said it if you can only healed yourself it's a choice it's not a it's a choice we all have the same choice to yield may god bless us as we leave here learning to yield amen listening that little chorus learning to lean learning to lean learning [Music] i'm learning to lean on jesus [Music] lean on jesus learning to lean learning to lean i'm learning to lean on jesus gaining more power than i've ever seen i'm learning to lean on jesus amen let's close our eyes
