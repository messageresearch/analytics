all things are possible Lord I receive amen we have to have that Faith Amen to receive from the Lord you have not because you ask not uh we've come to the source that can do EX seedly above all that we would ask or think I say God bless you for coming to the house of the Lord today to receive from him amen turn with me if you in your bibles if you have them with you if not you can follow along with us on the screen but I always like to encourage you to bring your Bibles we were taught by the prophet to check every everything that he spoke with the word because the word is the final Cil amen we're going to read a couple of scriptures verses in Genesis chapter 5 and then the second is going to be in Hebrews chapter 11 Hebrews chapter 11 let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer and just ask him to uh open our hearts with re Revelation that he would give us today our heavenly father we come to you humbly as we know how knowing that our total dependency is upon you father we thank you that you have brought us thus far and our our relationship with you that you have kept us we thank you for the keeping power of the Holy Spirit and Lord you have promised us that you would take us all the way sometimes we feel a alone but that's the time that we know to deny our feelings because Thy word says I'll never leave you nor forsake you and that uh is what we're leaning upon Lord we're leaning upon all thy word and so we set aside all of our feelings our thoughts um contrary to your word all of our emotions and Lord we're looking to you tonight would you come and just whisper a word to each of our hearts today Lord that we might draw closer to you and have a greater leading for our lives we ask that you would meet also the needs father that there would be among amongst us and as our brother Ron had said to those that are not here we just pray a special blessing upon them Lord that you would you would meet with them Father and that you would help them and and draw them Close to You Lord we know that we're living in an hour where the spirit is is declaring that there would be is speaking expressively there would be a great falling away and Lord we just pray that that uh fervency and that love and it would continue to grow in our heart that we would draw closer to you in that same time we commit the service to you with all of our needs and we give you praise now for these things in Jesus Christ's holy name amen Genesis chapter 5 starting with verse number 18 the Bible says and Jared live 162 years and he had a baby boy at 162 and his name was Eno amen and Jared lived after he begat Enoch 800 years and he begat Sons and Daughters all the days of Jared were 960 and2 he died and Enoch lived 60 five years and begat Methuselah and Enoch walked with God after he begat methusa 300 years and begat sons and daughters and all the days of Enoch were 30065 years we got 365 days in a year and he he lived 365 years and Enoch walked with God God and he was not for God took him amen and then also in the book of Hebrews 11th chapter verses five and six speaking here of Enoch by faith Enoch was translated that he should not see death and was not found because God had translated him and before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God Amen but without faith it's impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must first believe that he is and that he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him amen God bless you may be seated today we want to entitle this message a pleasing walk we we want to talk about Enoch Enoch walked with God for 300 years and he went into his own private Rapture that's right and the thing that really caught my attention is what transpired before the rapture the Bible says he had a testimony that he pleased God now we can sometimes foretell what's going to happen right we can predict sometimes the weather if I could say it like that sometimes the we've heard brother brandom talk about the the birds they know when there's a an earthquake coming and a storm and and they they get ready sometimes we can even sense when we're going to have a difficult con conversation with our spouse before it happens uh and and so um before any of us can take a Rapture we've got to have a pleasing walk just like Enoch amen Jude 14 says and Enoch also was the seventh from Heaven prophesied of these saying behold the Lord cometh with 10,000 of his Saints the message the Rapture brother B says now notice Enoch he was the type of the church here he's also typed in the seventh Church age now all the rest of the six men before him they died but Enoch was translated Enoch was Rapture the seventh showing that he's the seventh Church age that takes the Rapture now there's no no doubt we're in the seventh Church age we all know it in the message leadership brother B says look at Enoch he walked with God for 300 years and then he had a testimony that he pleased God and God verified and said there's no need of you dying just come home come up home this afternoon and he went up in the message power of transformation brother BR says Enoch his whole body was transformed Amen to meet a type in God that he was taken to heaven without even seeing death right amen some good some good quotes there about Enoch you know the Bible doesn't say a whole lot about Enoch but you know brother brandom did he said a whole whole lot about him now there's various types of of relationship and he had a a special relationship for sure but we all have some kind of walk with God can you say Amen now some have what I say is a longdistance relationship with God we've heard of you can't have a longdistance relationship with somebody that's overseas or something it it's just hard to have a longdistance relationship well some have a long distance relationship with God they may never openly admit that but they struggle with keeping a daytoday relationship with God right and maybe they get caught up with the cares of life and and and others bury themselves in personal issues their family their work their Hobbies their finances maybe they got a bucket list they just want to they want to do things before uh you know that that the country goes you know too far gone but it seems to be something always keeping them from a closer relationship something keeps them in a longdistance relationship with God some have a a a mediocracy or uh just a a a relationship that's uh Soul so with God they seem to put forth more of an effort to stay involved to stay connected they put more of an effort they have a greater conviction about church attendance they want to help the body but for the most part it's about what they want to get out of the relationship amen and then some have a close relationship with God they're faithful to the things of God they Faithfully communicate with God in prayer and some are even called uh prayer warriors they seem to be steadfast or always abounding in the work of God you can count on them to be there right and it all has to do with a close relationship with God now no matter where we're at in our personal relationship with God I believe with all my heart that there is room for a closer relationship now Enoch exercised daily a relationship where he drew closer to God every day we know the scripture says drawn n to God he'll Draw N to you until one day he was closer to his Heavenly home than he was his own Earthly home right and God just raptured him amen so before Enoch had this great translation he had a wonderful testimony and that he pleased God he had a testimony that we all should be striving for it that we should all be resting into that we should all be fighting for the the the fighting the great fight of Faith amen because it was by faith he was translated it was by faith he went into the Rapture brother bam said in the message only believe he said wouldn't it be nice if we had a testimony like that Brethren wouldn't it be wonderful like Enoch he walked with God 3 years and had a testimony that he pleased God he didn't have to die he just went up he he gives a little illustration here he says so then a little afternoon stro he just started walking out and he just thought well I've been on Earth long enough I'll just walk on up and started by faith he thought well if I've been here long enough I'm kind of tired of being around here I think I'll just Str up and hit the Milky Way and just walk on up knock on the door so that's what he did by faith he did it the Bible said so see he just got tired uh just got tired staying here and he said well I'm just going to go walk up home with God Amen I just went on through the the air walking he did it by faith and the Bible said so so now we're looking we want to look at just some scriptures tonight and just kind of see you know really what it means to walk pleasing to God Amen what what is needed to have a testimony that Enoch had um and I believe that should be the bride's Focus don't you because she's the only one going into the Rapture amen amen I I think everybody else is is content where they're at I I and Enoch was never content he always was pressing for more he never had a revelation you know I'm uh I'm I'm the bride in this hour I'm the I'm the type and I'm going to go in the Rapture you know therefore I'm just going to sit around and wait no every illustration that's given brother brandham said he would just kept walking closer and closer and closer to God until one day he was so close that God said amen giv us the the the the the idea that we had to be doing the same thing because Enoch was a type of this the seventh Church age amen so what is it what is considered a pleasing walk with God would it be to take time out of each day and and and and take a little walk with God as we would maybe taking our our dog for a walk would that be it yesterday I I went on a two mile walk with my son Jonathan and uh trying to exercise and I uh that that was a walk some people go for a walk every day amen is this the kind of walk that God is looking for because Enoch walked with God the Bible says is it just a casual stroll with him the Bible says that Enoch walked with God 300 years and let me just say this he held his testimony amen he held his testimony that he pleased God am brother Bram says this in the message questions and answers on the seals he says now notice Moses only served God for 40 years he was a 120 years the first 40 years he was getting his education the second 40 years God was taking it out of him and the third 40 years he served God right he said all right but Enoch walked with God 300 years before God and was blamed he was just trying to show a type you know Moses did serve God for 40 years but look at Enoch 300 years and he was blameless amen that's a pretty strong word don't you think I just need you to go with me here blameless not responsible for anything that's what it means he could not be accused of wrongdoing or wrong acting he was IR reproachable he was Guiltless he was innocent 300 years is a long time to walk with God and to remain blameless don't you think amen amen and I I'm not trying to set a stage for an impossible walk for us I am not trying to do that don't want to do that but what I do want to do is place before you what we should be driving for there's a difference now Phil Philippians chap 2:12 if you turn with me there Philippians chapter 2 starting with verse number 12 what does it mean to walk pleasing what does it mean to walk blamelessly wherefore my beloved as ye have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling see a lot of people think they don't have to work anything out right right right they think they they quote they Jesus Paid It all he went to Calvary it's not by works right and they got this kind of format to where you don't really have to do anything right un not really lacking really what the relationship is all about but but Paul talks to the Philippians here what's going on he says for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of his good pleasure amen amen so what do we actually work what do we actually do what is the work that we're supposed to do we're supposed to listen to God Amen we're supposed to do what he's telling us on the inside right right if we just ignore that then we're ignoring him preparing a place for him to live in when he comes back that's the truth I I want us to get that Revelation he goes to prepare a place for us he's working his he's building the building inside of us amen amen now the first thing he says here he says do all things without murmuring and disputing right in other words when God tells you to do something just do it amen fear the lord tremble when he speaks to you amen don't murmur do all things without grumbling without grudging without uttering dissatisfaction now notice it doesn't say do some things it doesn't say do most things it doesn't even say you're allowed to complain when you think things are really bad if you want to be blameless do not murmur do not complain disputings are discussions accompanied with debate and disagreement Y and the Bible says do all things without it that's right why now notice there's a CO in there right and look at the next verse that you may be blameless that you may be harmless the sons of God without rebuke just like Enoch just like Enoch blameless means irreproachable and faultless right harmless means safe gentle mild wholesome God wants us to be gentle amen mild wholesome look we got all got reasons for acting and talking the way we do right and that's that's fine but if you want to meet up with going into a rapture we got a standard to hold to amen and that's just all there is to it amen this this message is not for everybody this message does not make a a a a um a a foolish virgin make the Rapture right look if we don't get the oil of the Holy Ghost we're not going in this message is only for the Bride of Jesus Christ amen amen that ye may be blameless and harmless the sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse Nation among whom you shine as lights in the world you know a lot of time we'll start mumbling and complaining because we're staring at something that we don't think is right right that's not fair that's not right that shouldn't happen the governor should have did this the township my neighbor shouldn't have done this we've got a reason yeah yeah to murmur and complain and Paul is telling us I expect you to be blameless and harmless in the midst of a rotten Nation right that's as perverse as I expect you to shine as a light amen amen holding forth the Word of Life in other words even though wrong is being done to you even though harm is coming at you you don't murmur you don't complain you live the word of God right amen amen that that I may rejoice in the day of Christ now we're talking about a Rapture right I mean we're all the the bride is waiting for the Rapture we're waiting for the coming of the Lord amen amen that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain neither labored in vain now some of us may see well brother John I just can't do that well I will say we've got to straighten up that first amen it it's by faith that Enoch was translated if we don't believe that the Holy Ghost Inside of us has power enough to let us live that word then we need to get back to the ABCs with Christ amen we need to get back to the altar get filled with the Holy Ghost and just start trusting God that we can live this word because we've got to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling you can't wait till the whole nation is doing better before you're going to start living right right we've got to believe what the Bible says for it is God which worketh in us to do of his good pleasure amen turn with me if you would to Romans chapter 8 Romans chapter 8 the we can't live the word on our own amen but when the Holy Ghost comes inside and we yield to the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost can literally things can be falling apart around you and you won't murmur and you won't complain amen because that's the power of the Holy Ghost God is not going to ask you to do something that he would do right in other words the Holy Ghost doesn't murmur and doesn't complain Romans chapter 8 ver7 because the carnal mind is emnity against God for it is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God obviously Enoch was not in the flesh because he had a testimony that he pleased God right so when we're in the flesh we we're not having the same testimony I mean this is important to me I believe the bride serves God 247 it's not a couple times a week or when it's convenient it's they're serving God with all their heart he says but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwelleth in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his okay so we all believe we have the spirit of God in us amen amen but now look the Bible holds us accountable and if the if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin in other words you're not going to be murmuring complaining right come on cuz it's dead amen but the spirit is life because of righteousness but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your moral Body by the spirit that dwelleth in you so you can you can go through life without murmuring complaining am well I'm having a hard time okay spend time seeking God don't try to be the first one to not murmur and complain without the Holy Ghost don't try to try to live this word be the first one to live the word without the Holy Ghost Inside you it won't work amen it won't work in the message the Easter seal brother ramam says the same power that raised up Jesus from the dead if it dwells in your mortal body see all right notice he said let's take another man with this quickening power there was a man Way Long Ago by the name of Enoch when a new thing came along when something come along and said well now we have to go back to the old school of this or that or the other Enoch walked with God right whatever God said do Enoch never missed one word he walked with God what was it he was a Son of God he was an eagle that had been called to that day yeah and when when come time he was so full of the quickening power of the Holy Ghost remember he had walked 300 years or more before God and not one time had he missed his word now I'm telling you to me that ought to challenge us to the core not one time did he miss behave himself not one time did he do but kept the testimony everything that God told him to do he went and he done it no argument about it he just went and done it no matter what anybody else thought he just went and done it why he was full of the quickening power amen and when it come time for the old man to die God just said down just sent down the ladder and he walked on up home right he quickened him amen and took his mortal body up in a Rapture amen that's the quickening power right it's a type for us it's a type for us see most people Satan has programmed most people to grade on a curve in other words you're going to be okay as long as you're not in a denomination as long as you're in the message you know you're safe but you can't find that in the message you just you just hear the him in the message saying come out of her and be not partakers of her sins but look you can take a pig out of the mud and put him in the most beautiful area but when he gets out of church and goes back and lives his own way and he's got Liberty to do what he's want he's going to go right back and do the things that pleases his flesh amen so just because we say we're in the message we belong to a message chuth it doesn't mean we're lining up with with with what Enoch testimony that Enoch had amen now the reward of a pleasing walk comes at the end of our walk I need I need us to remember that a lot of times you know we got to be rewarded real quick you know the Pharisees they needed a reward real quick that's why they they prayed long prayers in in front they wanted to make everybody know they were fasting that they were uh paying their their their ties that they were giving they were doing all this stuff because they needed a quick reward they wanted the you know recognition from others but the bride knows her reward towards at the end and I want us to keep our eyes fixed on that just be faithful to God be faithful to the word the Rapture is going to happen if you remain faithful amen BR said the in the message uh the first seal in the first seal he said Enoch was translated without death the type of the church being caught up with those who are asleep to meet the Lord in the air and the rest of the church is carried over into the tribulation period can't make nothing else out of it myself Enoch raptured no death and the rest of the Dead lived not for a thousand years there you are they went through the tribulation period so everybody didn't hold the testimony think of the foolish version they didn't please God they might have lived good clean lives but to be honest with you they didn't please God not in everything because if you want to if you really want to please God get serious about getting the Holy Ghost ghost amen that's what really pleases God because now he's able to live inside of you and take control of your life call the shots amen we're born by the will of God to do the will of God we no longer have a say of what we're going to do with our life brother Braham said in the message things are to be he said how much more abler is he to get it he's a Creator now think about how able he is to Pro prepare us a body now he's speaking about making us fit and ready he's talking about his ability to get us ready to prepare us a body to live like his own glorious body if we want to live there is something in us cause us to live Now understand we have a glorious body that's awaiting us flesh and blood is not going to enter the kingdom but understand what's happen happening in this body is there's a development of character that is not a gift it doesn't come with church attendance it is something that you learn on a daily basis to bring this flesh under control to not let it have its way to die out and you yield yourself to God if the Bible says do all things without murmuring complain you walk out of the church and you say Lord help me never to murmur and complain again am and when you face your first trial and that thought comes to you you what's happening is character is being molded in you but if you just go through that test and you try to prove the other person's wrong and you wouldn't have to do this if they didn't do that you don't not have you're not building your character right what you're doing is you're delaying an opportunity for God to build inside of you amen now there's there is something in us that cause us to live and there's something in us that cause us to do right then God will call somebody on the platform or the pulpit and they will preach the absolute truth why see it shows you then if you're a real child of God and you begin to cry out God take it away from me circumcise me of this take these things away from me why it's needed for for your heavenly home that you're going to where where he's gone to prepare you've got to be a real word bride of Christ amen now this is so profound to me he said it's needed for your heavenly home amen you got to get this thing out of you for your heavenly home right you've got to be serious with the things that God speaks to your heart amen that it it's it's it's no longer just coming to church to hear something new to hear something it's about you becoming Christ and there is a part right there is a part where we've got to recognize who we are but there's another part that if we truly do recognize who we are that we've got to separate we can't let our flesh have its way amen so there is a part we can play in that's why I love this quote because he's he's gone on to prepare he's got you've got to be a real word bride of Christ not just say I'm bride without the word in the message the seventh seal brother Ram says the kingdom of God is coming and it's becoming more from the negative to the positive remember Brother Bruce sharing a little bit of that it's becoming more from the negative to the positive as it has been now that ought to choke people he said that ought to choke people from justification to sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then here here we're just drawing closer to God all the time amen I don't know what that means to you when I went to high schol school and they tried to teach me about you name it science [Music] math that is not the way that you get closer is to knowledge you get closer to God by a relationship see I can sit and I can get all the knowledge in the world and never obey God Amen never do what he tells me to do amen but be filled with knowledge God is wanting us to draw closer to him all the time Enoch he had a vision for Walking with God the vision was so real to him because it was by faith that he was going to be raptured he he knew he was going to be raptured amen that he decided that I need to walk closer to God every day and so he dedicated himself to God every day it it it was more real to him because you got to understand there were other people that lived during the time of Enoch amen they didn't all get raptured Enoch is the type of the Bride today the bride in this age I believe she has a vision to to walk with God closer and closer every day Enoch wasn't just some some special person he was like extra talented or uh spiritually gifted or or or or he was more popular than everybody else the thing that made him so special is that he had a love relationship with God Amen he really loved God it was just the bottom line it was the it was the foundation of what he did right he just loved God and I think it takes real love to draw closer to God why is that because our flesh does not want to do what he tells us to do our flesh would rather murmur and complain dos and don'ts got to do this got to do that why can't I you know I'm free from all that you're not free from obeying God Amen so it takes real love to draw closer to God brother baham said in the message the unfailing realities of the Living God he says you want to belong in heaven that's where your affections ought to be then see on the things above the Bible says set your affections on things above not on the things of the earth now I know we're all busy we got jobs but where's your affection they're going to fail stay with God stay with the realities God is a god of reality he has always been in all ages anytime that man ever walked with God God became a reality amen and that reality performs signs and wonders and miracles with his people I want to get so real with God that I have the same testimony that Enoch had and I believe I'm going to have to press every day to get it amen here's the secret to Enoch's translation he worked hard very very hard every day I'm pleasing God you got to work at it you got to work hard on it you know we're so used to to hearing the word and not doing it you know become hearers of the word and not doers right because look just just to be honest with you you're going to you're going to hear from God you're going to leave church and you're not going to get spanked right right you're not going to get a flat tire on the way home you're not going to get um some bad things going to happen because God lets his children be disobedient if that's what they want to do but I'm telling you as the Bride of Jesus Christ she don't want to be disobedient so she is attentive this morning I was driving I was going to say driving to work but I wasn't because I was driving to get my coffee then come back and go to work and it was behind the semi and it said be attentive and I believe the bride is attentive she's sensitive to what the Holy Spirit would speak to him amen all right so we want to work real hard at that Enoch believed that if he sought the Lord daily that God would draw closer to him that was the faith that he had the Bible says that that Enoch believed that he when he came to God that God would reward him because he was diligently seeking him not just once in a while see if we only try once in a while just a few times a week you know we're going to really try with God he's not going to reward you because that doesn't line up with the word diligent diligent is diligent now we're talking about bride it's a whole different set of circumstances when we're talking about foolish virgins turn with me if you would to James chapter 4 how do I work hard at pleasing God James chter 4 the Bible says that God gives more GR Grace wherefore he saith in verse six God he resists the proud but gives Grace unto the humble amen you think about all the evil that's done in the world right now all the people that kill people and they rob people and they steal millions of dollars of government money and you know we all watch the news or heard the news and things are happening the there's shootings and all these things happen and people get away with it right and it's wrong but God allows so many people to get away from it get away with it for a time being you understand a time being well don't you think he's going to let Believers leave the church after hearing the word of God and kind of brush it off as it's not no big thing and they don't feel that conviction why don't they feel that conviction because they got a distant relationship with the Lord it's not real sensitive it's not real tender it's like if if if the word isn't given to me like this presented like this and it makes me feel like this then you know what I'm just not going to take it do all things without murmuring and complaining right amen Enoch received more grace than anybody else because he was only one raptured every there was others that received Grace but he received Grace to to to go into a Rapture not everybody's receiving that Grace just those just the bride she's going to receive more grace than the others now the Bible says that he gives this grace to the humble so Enoch he must have walked humbly amen because he walked with God 300 years well the Bible says that God inhabits eternity he's the high and lofty one but he also dwells with him that is of a humble and contrite spirit so he does dwell with the humble Enoch must have walked humbly now I tell you all we got to do is just take a second and be honest with yourself do we walk humbly don't say I walk humbly than this brother I walk humbly than this sister that's not what I'm asking you well let's let's continue reading here submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he'll flee from you you know the devil's the one that's telling you to murmur and complain he's trying to get youall worked up just submit yourself to God let it go draw nigh to God and he'll draw nigh to you cleanse your hands purify your hearts ye double-minded be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to Heaven is in other words get serious about drawing n to God get serious amen like it's okay that the whole church World wants to go to church and be entertained it's okay for them but it's not for the bride no humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He will lift you up right Enoch got lifted up amen amen I believe he humbled himself he put on clothes of humility amen he dressed every day and he didn't say well as long as everything is right with me then I'm going to be humble and if not I'm going to put you in your place I don't visualize Enoch putting people in their place I believe he believed the word which Vengeance belong to God God takes care of things we got a job to do do it without murmuring do it without complaining I mean we look at the government I tell you you you don't got to look far to know that there's so much terrible things that it's easy to murmur and complain about the government but I don't believe we have scripture to murmur and complain about the government I don't as bad as it is we shouldn't it's you know you got who are you you got to be what Christ is looking for Christ is not looking for a spokesman who's going to speak out at all the wrong politicians he's wanting us to represent him amen if people want to represent on that side right and wrong that's her business but the bride she is focused on becoming the word that's her Focus let's take a look at some scriptures here on what it really means to put clothes of humility on in Ephesians chapter 4 verse1 Ephesians chapter 4 verse1 I I Paul said therefore the prisoner of the Lord can you can imagine being a prisoner of the Lord he set you free and you're a prisoner the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the calling wherewith you are called so in other words many are called few are chosen right and there's many people not even in this message who say they're walking with God and they got a close relationship but you look at their lives and it doesn't take long to see that it's not lined up with the word amen so Paul was saying look walk worthy amen walk worthy compare yourself with the word and then he goes on and he describes what that is with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another in love you just take that one verse and you don't even have to go 24 hours and you can be tested with that verse right there to see whether you got the clothes of humility on Amen one day 24 hours and you'll be tested every one of us on that amen so I can see where this this comes into play do all things without murmuring and complaining because if you're going to be longsuffering you're not going to murmur and complain if you're truly going to be longsuffering you don't want to murmur and complain and say okay that don't work with all loneliness with all meekness with longsuffering forbearing one another love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of peace right now it is so easy easy with me to keep Unity with brother Ron just for a second because brother Ron the only thing he's wanting to do is is is is is is please me is help me is work with me but now Bob Bob he's got a problem with everything that I practically do I can say you you know what I would I I I would have no problem having Unity with Bob but there's something wrong with Bob and that's how we all look at at whether we're going to try with Bob or not but reality if God is in you you'll follow the scripture with Bob right you will because because the Bible says it says ende deing trying trying putting forth effort working now the Bible says live peace be with all men as much that lies within you that's true but you that doesn't mean you don't work anymore you try you work because that's the Holy Ghost it's not you saying well yeah you know I don't know if I look just the Holy Ghost doesn't sit there and debate the word brother brandham said e whatever God told Enoch to do he just did it he didn't murmur he didn't complain he didn't wrestle with it he just went and did it amen and you're really free if you can do that right you're really free of yourself if you can just do it he said there's one body one Spirit even as you're called into one hope of your calling all right Philippians chapter 1 verse 27 we're going to have to go quick only let your conversation be as becometh the gospel of Christ now think about your whole conversation not just a part that you are thinking about but think about all of it that whether I come and see you or be absent I may hear of your Affairs that ye stand fast in one Spirit one mind striving together for the faith of the Gospel now remember Enoch had a testimony that he pleased God and Paul talking to the Philippian church he says I want to hear of your Affairs I want to hear a good report that you're you're standing fast in one Spirit that's the holy spirit with one mind the mind of Christ striving together for the faith of the Gospel now if we put that on our responsibility to do that with every one of us I think we have a good testimony amen I think we're following the testimony of Enoch all right Colossians chapter 1 verse number seven Colossians chapter 1 verse 7 as ye have learned eaus and our dear our dear fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of Christ who also declared unto us your love in the spirit so this minister is he declared uh onto Paul that that they had a real love in the spirit they were manifesting the love in the spirit he said for this cause we ALS for this cause we also since the day we heard of it we heard this report of you we do not cease to pray for you you know what we're also Desiring that you would be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding you mean to tell me it's not good enough that I'm just I got this testimony of of of of of of the love of the spirit you still got to pray for me and and desire that I be filled with with with with the knowledge of his will that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing wow I I'm I'm looking here at a pretty high standard here I I don't see Paul saying hey look you got enough just stay where you're at that you might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing just like Enoch being fruitful in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God strengthen with all might according to his glorious gospel unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness giving thanks unto the Father which have made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints and light who delivered us from the power of darkness and have translated us into the kingdom of his dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood even the Forgiveness of sins so I believe before we're going to be translated we need to get translated into the word of God before our bodies are going to be taken we've got to get our character translated into this word we need to become more ser ious about this and spend time daily seeking the Lord God let me be like you give me the testimony that Enoch Lord I I want to find favor with you I believe that is the prayer of the Bride I do because I don't believe the bride is just gonna float there she's not going to float in she's going to keep pressing in yeah I want you to write write this one down give you some homework Ephesians 5: 1-1 17 I'm just going to read the two verses first two verses be ye therefore followers of God as dear children so this is what a follower of God does and walk in love as Christ also loved us and gave himself for an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savior now you go in there and you'll see what it Paul is trying to tell the Ephesian Church to do how to walk pleasing unto God all right 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 1 Thessalonians chapter 2 verse number eight says so being affectionate desirous of you we were willing to have imparted unto you not only the gospel of uh not the gospel of God only but also our own Souls because you were dear unto us that's that's a love isn't it that's love for you remember Brethren our labor our travail for laboring night and day because we would not be chargeable unto any of you we preached unto you the gospel of God and your Witnesses and God also how holy how justly and unblameable we behave saved ourselves among you that believe wow what a testimony Paul had a great testimony as ye know how we exhorted and comforted and charged every one of you as a father does his own children that you walk worthy of God who have called you unto his kingdom and glory for this cause also thank we god without ceasing because when you receive the word of God which he heard of us you received it not as the word of men but as it is TR the word of God which effectually works worketh also in you that believe the word don't work if you don't believe it in a message we're winding down here time is is coming to a close so just bear with me I'm still on my time just so you know I haven't stepped over into your time in the message called humble thyself brother BR said in all those places there it's men and women that are waiting to see the light flash over their path you just keep flashing the light in humility and sweetness that's how he describes the capital l i g HT flash over their path in humility and sweetness amen let's all grow closer to God Amen by humbling ourselves don't forget this Tabernacle will lose its strength remember that this is a target where Satan has got every gun in Hell trained on it he'll cause one person to do something that's contrary to what another one thinks he's doing that he is up to it that's his business if he can get somebody to say something somebody to talk about another say well listen did you know so and so did he says don't you listen to it don't you listen to it at all that's the devil see it's Satan don't you believe it he said if there's anything that somebody has done wrong he said just pray for them and don't pray in a selfish way say I know it's my duty I've got to pray for that brother he says you take it to your heart really down really down for that sister and just talk and be real sweet and the first thing you know you'll find them right back in the service again amen why it's Christ being projected out of you to that person restoring them helping them getting them back in line cuz all after all we're all headed towards the setting of the Sun the Lord Jesus will be coming one of these days and you know I think it'll be sudden and so sweet and so so there'll be one 100th of 1% of the whole world will never will never know when the Rapture takes place it would just go so quick quietly and nobody would know nothing about it I don't know brother Bruce and I think about being up here and and ministering to the Bride of Jesus Christ you're really preaching to 1% of 100th of 1% what in honor it is that God brought us into this messag amen that we got what we need to make the Rapture if we're willing to take the word amen and start living it start putting it into practice start start humbling yourself more in the message demonology religious brother B says a humble submitted heart in the Simplicity is what brings you to God and that's true amen a humble heart God loves now no matter if you don't know your ABCs that don't make any difference just a humble heart God dwells in a humble heart and the lower you can break yourself down the more simple you can become great greater in the sight of God amen let's stand together I want us to start walking together Paul said follow me as I follow Christ I say we need to follow Enoch's example amen we need to get our testimony right I know none of us have a perfect testimony but you know today's a new day and if if if we just are determined Lord I want to put more emphasis on a on pleasing you with my walk I believe God will honor that and you just you humble yourself you know when you don't murmur you know what you're doing you're humbling yourself because it's our nature to want to complain but if you say I'm just not going to do that you bite your tongue you're humbling yourself you're clothing yourself with humility God will honor that God will bless you with that right it's Christ inside of you getting you ready for your home I believe that amen let's sing that little chorus pleasing pleasing we sing it all the time hopefully it has a little bit more of a meaning this evening amen pleas let me be pleasing to you let everything that I do be pleasing to you pra let everything I pursue be pleasing oh Lord unto [Music] you pleaseing let me be pleasing to you let everything that I do be pleasing to you pray let everything I pursue the pleasing oh Lord unto you one more time let's just sing with all the heart he sees your heart pleas let me be pleasing to you that everything that I do be pleasing to you pray let everything I Pur be pleasing oh Lord un to you amen just to think every day we can be reminded of of Enoch's uh testimony the had would we just start humming that song Through the course of the day pleasing pleasing amen let's go to the Lord in prayer God knows your heart I believe every one of us here today have a a desire to draw closer to the Lord and and just to to walk towards that testimony so let's just believe with all of our heart as we go to him in prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your word amen Lord we thank you that you gave us a a recording of Enoch's life the most important part that he walked with you he had the testimony that pleased you and that he pleased you so much that you raptured him amen a type for us that though there's other people here on the planet when the Rapture takes place you're only going to to Rapture your one bride and Lord we're asking you humbly this evening and with every heart that's that's heard this message that's live streaming in the homes perhaps there'd be some that might even watch the the archive and Lord I'm praying for them as well that you would Grant to each of us Lord A Closer Walk with You Lord we want we want to press towards uh a a solid testimony that's blameless Lord we look back in our life and we see Lord we've come short of your glory Lord many things we're not proud of we can't say we're blameless we can't we can't say we we had a a a walk with you for even one year that was blameless we understand these things Lord but God you showed us tonight Lord to press towards what you're looking for to walk pleasing to walk worthy of the calling that you've called us to and I pray that you would remind us every day when we get on our knees to seek after that closeness with you before we leave on the court of the day to make sure we put on the the clothes of humility that we're ready Lord to to to walk with you that day just one day at a time one hour at a time one step at a time and Lord where we drift off we we get off maybe we just quickly make it right quickly make it right Lord we know that your blood covers Us and gives us that testimony if we can just stay pressing towards the closer walk with you bless each brother bless each sister Lord help us to work out our our Salvation not with a Hess and arrogance and and a pride and and and and and and thinking wor something but Lord help us to work it out with trembling with fear with reverence with Lord help me to be more what you want me to be bless each one Lord father it is my prayer that we all would be there together on on Rapture morning going up to meet you in the air just like Enoch did yes Lord father we give you our lives we give you our hearts we humble ourselves before you and we thank you for your grace the grace that you have given us the grace that you continue to give us and the more grace that will be coming our way we thank you for it since sincerely with all of our heart Lord in the precious name of Jesus Christ we pray
