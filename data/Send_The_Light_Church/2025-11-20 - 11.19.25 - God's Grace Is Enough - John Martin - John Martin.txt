Well, we just have a I don't think we have any prayer requests, so I guess everything's well. And it's good to say it's well with my soul, but I know there's things that need to be we all need to pray for. So, let's just remember all those that are in need. Uh let's lift up our our sister Cheryl's dad. Amen. It's good to see her mother here and um we just believing for her full recovery and uh the time that she's going to be able to spend with him down here and her mother. And we just pray that the Lord just be in the middle of it all. And uh we're so thankful for our brother Marty being here today. uh and um that he's well enough to be here and just continue lifting him up in prayer. Amen.

So, let's just lift her up and continue to lift her up in prayer. Amen. And everybody else that's not here. and uh just for all the needs of the church. Amen. Um I need we I think we need to start praying that we would all be on one accord. Uh if we really want the power of God to fall, we need to all be like-minded. So let's just write uh stand up and we'll just uh if there's a need before you this morning, just let the Lord know what it is. I mean I I'm sure everybody's got a lot of unspokens.

Dear heavenly father, Lord, as we come before you, Lord, Lord, we sing the song, Lord. Let your Lord your power fall upon us, Lord. And by the Holy Spirit, Lord, we believe that's possible, Lord. If we can just find that vein, Lord, be on on in that one accord with you, Lord God, as a body, Lord. And as we come before you, Lord, without faith, Lord, we know we can't please you, Lord. Because we come by faith, Lord, that Lord, that this day was ordained by you, Lord God.

As we come, Lord Jesus, assemble as a body of believers, the body of Christ this morning, Lord, or this afternoon, we just pray, Lord, that your your anointing would just fall upon us, Lord God, in a mighty way, Lord. when the word is spoken Lord, it would just transform us Lord and manifest you in our lives more so Lord God that when we leave Lord we can see we can feel a physical change in our a spiritual change in our bodies Lord God that Lord that we can say Lord we walked with you along the way Lord God tonight Lord we're so thankful Lord that we have a house a place to go to a church Lord that believes your whole word Lord not watered down by some, Lord, uh, things of the world, Lord God, but true to the word, Lord God, this this night, Lord.

But when you have Christ, you got a place you can go. Amen. And you go there all the time. Amen. Amen. Let's just uh stand as we're going to change order of service as our brother John comes forward. Amen. and just sing the only real peace. Amen. The [singing] only real peace that I have, dear Lord, [singing] is in you. The [singing] only real peace that I have, [singing] dear Lord, is in you. In all life frustrations, I need you. I know [singing] I do. For the [singing] only real peace that I have, dear Lord, is in you.

Isn't that the truth? &gt;&gt; There is nothing that gives you peace like God. &gt;&gt; His peace passes all understanding. &gt;&gt; His peace will see you through every storm. And I'm so grateful that God has peace for his children. Amen. We're going to read a little bit about it in our opening scripture. If you want to turn there to the book of Numbers, Numbers chapter 6. We know that we don't often read out of this book. It's uh kind of uh just it has numbers and things in orders and a lot of compartmentalizing structure, sacrifices. And so we don't read often in this, but we do want to take our opening scripture from here today. I want to welcome my mother-in-law here today. And as uh maybe brother Ron had already mentioned, Cheryl's mother Nancy Whailing. And uh Cheryl was telling me that today um we have four generations. Her mom's here, her daughter Ann is here, and her granddaughter Emma is here. So, usually we only see that when we have Thanksgiving and gettogethers, but to have it in church, that's a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we want to welcome her. And I when I came in, I saw your coat on. I thought I better turn up the heat cuz [laughter] in our house, uh, she was a little bit cold. And you can imagine how our house is. It's just like the sanctuary. So, uh, I asked if we could turn the heat up there a little bit. So, um, I, uh, turned it up a little bit here and hopefully we'll be able to get warm and and enjoy the word today. But before we begin reading, let's just look to the Lord in a word of prayer. And that's his blessings on the furtherance of this service today. Heavenly Father, we thank you for the peace that you have for your people. It is the necessary thing to help us through troubled times. Your peace keeps us in a place of calm and uh confidence and assurityity that we will make it through. And so we thank you today for your peace. And we thank you today for your grace because it's your grace that gives us peace, Lord. Father, we pray that uh you would bless your people today as they have gathered in your house to worship you, to receive of your word. May you come in this time as the word is being delivered that you would give us ears to hear, eyes to see, a heart to receive. Lord, let us leave here with more of you than when we came and that we would have more trust in you to help us in our daily life with all the trials and things that we go through. Lord, we're depending upon you. Ask these blessings upon the word upon your people now for we pray these things and give you thanks in advance now in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Numbers chapter 6 starting with verse number 22. And the Lord spoke unto Moses saying, speak unto Aaron and his sons. Now this is the priesthood. God is speaking to Moses the prophet saying to the priesthood saying, "Oh th on this wise ye shall bless the children of Israel. saying unto them, "The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon thee, and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace, and they shall put my name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them." Amen. God bless. You may be seated. We want to entitle this message, God's grace is enough. &gt;&gt; And for a subject, there is strength in God's grace. Here we see in our opening scripture here that we know that the children of Israel did not deserve God. But God came and he blessed his people. And he wanted the ministry to say to the people, "The Lord bless thee. The Lord keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee, and give thee peace." This was the grace of God given to his people. And we all need grace. &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard of someone being a thorn in your flesh? Like uh it's kind of a repeat thing. When you think of a thorn in your flesh, you're thinking something that's repeat. Well, thorn in my flesh refers to a source of continual annoyance or trouble or pain. Now, I don't want you to go home and start talking to somebody about them being a thorn in your flesh, but we have to just lay the foundation here. And if you want, you can turn with me to 2 Corinthians chapter 12. There was given to Paul a thorn in the flesh. The Bible says, "The messenger of Satan to buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure." Now, he had this problem to which Satan continuously buffeted him. Was a thorn in his side. Now, anybody that's ever had something prick them continuously, it's the automatic thing. Stop. This thing's got to stop. Well, we'll pick this up in verse eight here. Paul having this, he says, "For this thing I besought the Lord three times, three separate times, that it might depart from me." And God said unto him, "My grace is sufficient for thee, for my strength is made perfect in weakness. And this was such a powerful revelation to Paul that he began to look at his trials differently. He said, "If God's grace is all that I need, THEN WHY DO I got to worry about all my problems?" &gt;&gt; And he said, "Most gladly, therefore, will I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ may rest upon me." Therefore, I take pleasure in infirmities, in reproaches, in necessities. I need this thing for my family, and persecutions, and what I'm going through, in distress. Distress for Christ's sake, for when I am weak, then I am strong. It's much easier to be strong when you trust God. When we try to be strong in ourself and in trying to figure it out and handle it and and do it and rely, the Bible says, "Lean not to thine own understanding, but to trust in the Lord and and and and Jesus was was re this was a this was a revelation to Paul. It was literally Jesus speaking to Paul by revelation. He came to church and he heard the word and something spoke to this is FOR YOU PERSONALLY PAUL. MY GRACE IS SUFFICIENT FOR YOU. EVERYBODY CAN'T RECEIVE THIS REVELATION BUT IT IS FOR YOU. &gt;&gt; I'll say today this word is not for everybody but it is for them who will receive it. &gt;&gt; Now that word sufficient it means enough. Just simply means enough. It's enough to meet the need or the purpose. It also means to avail. In other words, my grace will avail for thee, Paul. It also means to be content. Be content with my grace, Paul. It's sufficient. So sometimes we just want the thorn to stop. We want our trial to stop. We want this thing to stop. And and God is wanting us to see him there in the trial handling everything. &gt;&gt; My grace is going to take care of this. But we just can't have the knowledge of his grace taking care of everything. As brother Ron was sharing that we have to have faith in what he said. In other words, we've got to believe that God's grace is really going to take care of it. Now, God provided grace for us to be saved. And think about, I want you to go back before you were saved. We were spiritually dead in trespasses and sin. The Bible says we walked according to the course of this world. And I'll say it like this, the devil's plans. We just did whatever he put on our heart to do. We just did it when our life was buried in the lust of fulfilling our flesh. And we were by nature, our own nature, we were the children of wrath even as everybody else in the world. So we were no different at one time. But the Bible says God was rich in mercy &gt;&gt; for his great love wherewith he loved us. So, we didn't know that we were even lost. God had to come by and say, "Hey, knucklehead, you're lost. You're going to die without me." And his love showed us that we were lost and that Christ was the only way back to the father. Acts 4:12 says, "Neither is there salvation in any other, for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved." The only name is Jesus Christ and it's a revelation. And God's speaking in Isaiah 43:11, if you want to write it down, God is speaking here and he says, "I even I am the Lord and beside me there is no savior." Showing us that the father and Jesus are one. And now did not Jesus say that &gt;&gt; me and my father are one. And he said, "Philip, when you've seen me, you've seen the father." And I just say it like this. God was manifested in the flesh. That's why we pray for our food. Everything we do in the name of the Lord. There is no other name given among men whereby we must be saved. Going back to Ephesians chapter 2 verse8. For the Bible says, for by grace now are you saved. By grace are you saved. It's through faith and that not of yourself. It is the gift of God. not of works, lest any man should boast and say, "Look at me." For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God have before ordained that we should walk in good works. Amen. So Jesus said, "My grace is sufficient for thee, and grace is what saved us." And when we realized that we could do nothing to save ourselves, God's strength became our strength when we became weak and we realized there was nothing we could do to save oursel. &gt;&gt; So I'm just I'm laying the the the foundation that we all can understand. When we got saved, we realized there was nothing we could bring to the altar to say, "God, I've done this and you know, am I allowed to go to heaven?" He revealed to us that we are sinners and that there is no way for us to be saved but by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And that was the grace of God. And we are all saved by his grace through believing that Christ died for us. So, we had to become perfectly weak in order to trust in his grace. This is where I'm going with this. Now, ever since Jesus came into our lives, we've been crying, "Grace, grace." We've been crying, "Lord, thank you for your grace." We've been singing, "Do you know grace? Look where you came from and where you are today." So if God's grace was sufficient to save our souls, then his grace is sufficient to meet every need that we have. The problem is we're not trusting him for the needs that we have. And it's the same grace. Think about it. The the greatest thing that God could do is save us. Now, when I'm talking about save us, I'm not saying uh you were in a car and you were burning and I just grabbed you out of the car and I saved you from getting burnt or dying. I'm talking about that his grace literally took my ugly nature and made it his nature. Come on. That is the greatest thing that God can do is take a devil and make him with the nature of God. &gt;&gt; Now, if he CAN DO THAT WITH MY NATURE, HOW COME HE CAN'T do that with all my needs? &gt;&gt; We got to start putting God to the test here. &gt;&gt; We got to be say, "God, I'm trusting you." Amen. &gt;&gt; What we what the problem is in all of our trials and our tests, we're not getting weak and saying, "God, &gt;&gt; I'm totally dependent on you. &gt;&gt; I'm totally trusting in you. You're going to take care of this situation. You're going to SEE ME THROUGH. I DON'T HAVE TO WORRY about my future." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't have to worry about what's going to happen next week. I don't have to worry about my kids because I serve a God whose grace is sufficient. &gt;&gt; We have to do the same thing that we did when we got saved to see our needs be met. And what is that? &gt;&gt; Become completely weak, completely dependent upon God and say, "God, I trust you." &gt;&gt; Just like you trusted him for salvation. Can you Can anybody prove to me that you're saved? Can you prove it to me? Can you Can you prove it? Can you scientifically prove it? The Bible says it's through faith. As soon as you stop believing, you stop your salvation. Yeah. I hate to I hate to say it like that, but you got to the Bible says you've got to maintain your beginning confidence to the end. &gt;&gt; It's you don't you know you go and you buy a house or you buy a car and you go to the bank and you sign the papers and that's it. That house or that car is yours and as long as you keep paying the payments that's yours. But what happens, Sister Lynn, if you stop paying on it? they come and get it. You got to keep believing every day who you are, who you belong to. Grace works when you believe. Now the word grace is unmmerited favor. So it was unmmerited favor that saved us and it's unmmerited favor that will see us through every situation in our life. Jesus said, "My grace is sufficient for thee." It's enough. Think about your situation in your life right now. Every one of you, I don't want you to think about anybody else, but I want you to think about your situation. &gt;&gt; Do you wish that it wasn't there? Amen. Love it. Honesty. Do you wish you didn't have to go through it? Do you ask God to take this cup of suffering away from you? Are you battling not wanting to deal with your situations? Let me ask you this. Are you battling being content? Are you battling trusting? Turn with me if you would to Philippians chapter 4. Paul just gets through talking about how to be content for peace and how to possess it and how to how to dwell in it, how to dwell in peace. And we kind of had that last song and I just said, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you for that." But, you know, we need peace in our situations. &gt;&gt; We We just We need peace. And peace comes from trusting in God. And you literally can be content when you got a thorn in your flesh. So here he is in verse chapter 4 verse 6 says, "Be careful for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your request let it be made known unto God. And the peace of God which passes all understanding, it's going to keep your heart and your mind, both circles. Now, through Christ Jesus, notice who it's through. It isn't through your understanding. It isn't through somebody saying to you, "Yeah, I I'll do this for you." It's through trusting in God. Finally, brethren, whatsoever things are true and honest and are just and are pure and lovely, whatsoever things of a good report, if there be any strength, if there be any praiseworthy, then you're allowed to think on these things. But if there's not, DON'T THINK ON it &gt;&gt; because what happens when you think on the wrong things? Can anybody does anybody got a testimony for me of what happens when you think on bad things? Do you get peace from doing that? &gt;&gt; Do you GET STRENGTH AND JOY AND FEEL LIKE GOING ON? &gt;&gt; NO. You get beat over the head by the devil. &gt;&gt; God does not speak to us in that way. &gt;&gt; So, we got to learn we all got this responsibility now if we want peace that we have to take our minds and set it upon the right things. Now verse nine, these things which you have both learned, in other words, Paul taught it and received. So he said, I received, I said, amen to the word. I heard it and you seen it in me. You seen it manifest in me that I got this peace. And he says to the church, he says, "Do and the God of peace shall be with you." In other words, what he did for others, he'll do for you. IT IS NO SECRET WHAT GOD can do. What he if he gave peace to one person, he can give it to another. But you got to follow the script. You can't make your own script. You can't deviate from it. You ever deviate from a recipe? What makes a recipe your recipe? Change one ingredient. Right? So when you change one ingredient, it's not the same. If you want the PEACE OF GOD, YOU GOT TO KEEP THE INGREDIENTS, you got to go to the script. And then Paul shares a personal testimony in verse 11 as what helps what helped him to overcome the the feeling of having to to run away from his situation. And and and God, take this I I this bothered ME SO MUCH. I PRAY THREE TIMES, TAKE THIS AWAY from me. And he says, you know what? I'll gladly bear this pain now. Why? Because when I was having this pain in my side, I felt like no one was with me, that God wasn't with me, that I was bearing this pain by myself. But when God told me that his grace was with me, I no further felt that I was alone that I had something more to to think about. I had to keep my mind not on the wrong things but the right things. And what was the right thing? That his grace was with me. His &gt;&gt; grace was with me. If you've got God's grace, you got everything. What a powerful revelation. And starting in verse 11, he says, "Not that I speak in respect of want. For I've learned in whatsoever say I'm in therewith to be content." So Paul, he's starting out. He's making this statement. I I don't want you I'm not talking right now of I want a car. I want a house. I want I I I want a boat. I want another gun. He's not talking about I got to learn to be content and not want those things. He's not talking about that. HE'S TALKING ABOUT WHAT GOD has ordained for your life. Learn to be content. God knows what he's doing. He says, "For for I have learned." In other words, it wasn't a gift. In whatsoever state I am, I am I I I am therewith to be content. Wow. That you know, in order to do that, you can't complain. You can't murmur. You know what it means to be content. You're you're you don't say anything about the thorn. And you have to learn that because as sure as anything and I've seen Emma uh play and sometimes she wants another Oreo cookie. Grandpa will let her have one. But we all have to learn to be content. And here's the big thing. It's not about the cookie or the cars or the bolts or the guns. It's about the trials that we're going through. Do we have the attitude that we're content or are we murmuring and complaining about them? It's some it's not a gift. You have to learn it. And so Paul says,"I know both how to be a base or abase, I'm sorry, abase and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need." So what is Paul saying here? It doesn't matter what's going on. I'm content. I'm right there content. And verse 13 is what I want to get to. I can do all things through Christ which strengthens me. &gt;&gt; My grace is sufficient for you, Paul. I'm going to take you through. Don't worry about it. And so now we don't look to handle all of our problems ourself. We get real serious about hearing from God. God, what do you want me to do? I know this. We We can all put in the line right here with every one of our trials. No matter what your trial is, when it comes into the blank, Lord, oh, what what do I need to do? Trust God. It ain't different for anybody's trial. The trial is just a tool that God is using to build character. And what gets you there is trusting God. I can do all things through Christ which strengthenth me. Why? Because God's grace is sufficient. Okay? So, we're going to go ahead and um I'm going to ask every one of you to go dig a hole out here. We're going to plant a tree and I'm going to give every one of you a a shovel and you're going to go out there and you're going to dig the hole. And as you're digging, your shovels or a couple of your shovels are falling apart. Now, your shovel is not sufficient to dig that hole. You need to get another shovel to dig the hole. When we think about God's grace, it's never broken. It's never missing. it. &gt;&gt; There's nothing lacking. It can handle everything. If it can save you and change your nature, it can meet every need you have. &gt;&gt; The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious to thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. We shouldn't be afraid of anything. God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power, love, and of a sound mind. That means we should not be afraid of our trials &gt;&gt; because God's grace is with us. &gt;&gt; Psalms 20 verse one. If we could put that up. I didn't I didn't uh give that to you, but I just I want to share this with you. Psalms 20 verse one, two, if you want, write it down. David said, 'The Lord hear thee in the day. The Lord hear thee in the day of trouble. How many feels like you're in a day of trouble? Yes. Will the Lord hear thee in the day of trouble? The name of God of Jacob defend thee, send thee help from the sanctuary, strengthen thee out of Zion. God sent his word to heal. God sends his word to meet needs. You know, the word does cannot do anything for you unless you believe it. We've got to believe that there's help in the sanctuary of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And we need to be content with our trials. This is a very hard one, but we need to be content. You know when you you order some food or you get your favorite meal cooked and you're sitting down and you're eating it and it's just perfectly done. You're content. You say, "Yeah, I bought the right doughnut this time." I mean, you're really content because we've all bought doughnuts before and you took a bite and you thought, "I didn't ask for yesterday's donut, right? You know what I'm talking about. You want a fresh one, right? want to taste good. That feeling of contentment, so peaceful, so it's everything's okay. That is how we need to be in our trials. Now, only God can give that to you, that peace. But we can learn to be content because that is not a gift. It is not a gift. The problem is that we haven't learned to stand still long enough to know that he is God in our trial. &gt;&gt; That he Jehovah Gyra, the one that saved you, is in our situation. He's the answer to our problem. He's the peace in the storm. He's the way maker through our trial. You know, Brother Brandham said it like this. People have a hard time. God's people have a hard time seeing God what's happening right now. They're always thanking God for what he did or looking to the future, what he's going to do, and they're missing God right now in their life. This is the most important time to see God. &gt;&gt; He when he made it known when he he's talking to Moses, MO MOSES SAYS, "WHO DO I TELL that's that's that set me? TELL THEM THAT I AM THAT I AM NOT I was not I was the God that that created the world or I'm the God that's going to take you in a the bride in a rapture in the seventh age. Tell them that I am what I am. God is a present help in a time of need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when these things drop down into our heart, we can trust God. Then we can really believe that we can do all things through Christ. Paul said,"I have learned in whatsoever state I'm in therewith to be content." And it's something that we all have to learn. We all have to learn to be content. We all have to learn to be still and and know that God is God. So, I'll just say it like this. Let's get to learning it. Let's get to learning it. Let's, you know, let's make a commitment. I'm going to learn to trust God. The way that you get content is trust him. Right? If you're in a fire and the you're starting to see fire or you're in a car and you're start or you're in a house and the house is engulfed, you're not going to stay in the house. You do not trust that the fire department is going to get there in time. You're going to get out of the house because it's burning. There's no contentment there. There's no peace there. Those three Hebrew children when they walked in that furnace, their mind was made up what direction they were going. They weren't going to give in to the devil. And God met them there because they trusted in God. Now, God supplies our needs. God's grace was sufficient for me in my situation. Therefore, I will rest in his grace. I will have peace in his grace. I will have contentment in his grace. I I all because of his grace. I can overcome. Learning to be content. I'll just say it like this. It takes character. Character is not given to us. Character is overcoming. It's a victory. It's saying I have overcome in my mind and my life. I can look back. This is what my problem is today. I don't have it. That's character. Character is not saying you fix my problem. Every man has to overcome. Jesus looked at the church in the Leodysia and he said, "To him that overcomemeth, why grant to sit with me on my throne as I have sat with my father on his throne." God does not give that to anybody. He He brought the children of Israel out of Egypt. That was grace. But now he said, "Now you overcome and take the land. You get the character to overcome your trials and get there because I am not giving you that. That you're going to have to overcome yourself." So remember, whatever's going on in your life, guarantee guaranteed God wants you to trust in him. So, the quicker we can learn to be content in our situation, the greater we're going to have the victory. All right. Philippians chapter 2:12. We need to hurry because you know how it is. I've only just begun. And we got so much to go through. [laughter] Philippians chapter 2:12. Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not in my presence only, not just at church, but now much more in my absence. away from you. Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. Don't lose the fear of God. &gt;&gt; Don't lose I could be wrong. Don't Don't get I you know I got it. I got this. No problem. I got I don't need you. For it is God which works in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. So why did Paul have a thorn in his flesh? The Bible tells us because of the abundance of revelation. So he wouldn't get lifted up. &gt;&gt; So whatever trials going on in your life, understand that God knows what he's doing to build character in your life. &gt;&gt; For it is God which workketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure. It's not our good pleasure. Our good pleasure is to be, you know, sitting on a a lazy boy, taking it easy, sipping lemonade, taking in the sun, listening to our jam. So do all things without murmuring and comput and disputing. So what's he saying here in verse 14? Be content. Be content. &gt;&gt; Don't murmur about the things that are happening in the church. Don't murmur about the things that are happening in the home. Don't murmur about the things that are happening in your personal life. You're not going to get God on the scene. You're not going to, you know, you're not going to manipulate God to do something for you with your murmuring and complaining. You know, we could do that with others. You just, you ever have somebody just complain COMPLAIN COMPLAIN? YOU'RE LIKE, "YOU BETTER TAKE CARE OF THIS. You can't do that to God. You can do that to other humans, but you can't do that to God. You know, God allowed the trial in our life for a reason. And I believe he he has confidence that you can take care of it, that you can go through it. Why? Because the Bible tells us that God would not put anything on us that we can't bear. That God is faithful. that with this trial, he will make a way for you because his grace is sufficient. It's all we need. We don't need to to understand. We need to trust in him. I'll say it like this. Paul learned to ride out the storm. He got whipped. He got shipwrecked. He got stoned. But you know what he did? Praise you, Lord. You're here. Your grace is sufficient. What happened to Stephen when they were stoning him? The glory of the Lord was ON HIS FACE. FATHER, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. God's grace is sufficient for our trials. They're nothing compared to what others had to go through. The thing is, we need faith to call on God. It's faith that gets a hold of God. We don't just have faith for our salvation and try to work everything else oursel. So do all things without murmurings and disputings. Why? That you may be blameless. When you when you complain, you're not blameless. You may be blameless and harmless. When you complain, you're not harmless. The sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation among whom you shine as lights in the world. If you don't murmur and you don't complain, I'm going to tell you, you stick out like a sore thumb. You shine. You shine for Jesus. Hallelujah. The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord make his face to shine upon thee and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance upon thee and give thee peace. That's what the ministry said to the children of Israel. You have to receive it. You have to receive it. They're not just words. It's God's will for your life. Verse 16, holding forth the word of life. Holding forth the word of life. This is God's word. I'm holding it. That I may rejoice in the day of Christ. That have not run in vain, neither labored in vain. Amen. Let's go down to uh 1 Peter chapter 4 verse one. And um if you say amen, I'll go faster. That's just it's just normal. It's just normal. Those are the rules. You say amen, I go faster. You don't say amen, then I got to go over it again. All right. First Peter chapter 4:1, we're still talking about trusting God in our trials here. For as much then as Christ have suffered for us in the flesh, Peter says, "Arm yourself." Put the armor on. Put the armor on. Arm yourself likewise with the same mind. For he that have suffered in the flesh have ceased from sin. In other words, if you choose, Lord, you want me to have this thorn in my flesh, if you want me to go through this, I'm going to trust you. When you trust him, you are ceasing from sin because you're trusting in God's grace to take you through. I I I can just say this. Um I'm 65 and I remember being a young teeny bopper going to high school and playing hockey and then thinking I was something. You know, you all heard one time I was in a gong show. Oh man, I was going to live it up. But you know, I got gonged and the air just went out of my head. I remember one time I'm going to play tennis for a position on the school team. I'm going to show the coach that I was better than I could be on the team because there's only so many spots. Well, you know, I lost. And God had to bring me to a place to realize that I can't make it without him. So, I began to serve the Lord after I got saved. And anybody that knows me knows I was as about as quiet as a mouse. And all of a sudden, we're having kids. I don't know about raising kids. I didn't have a mom and dad together. And all of a sudden, they're sick and they're throwing up and they're they got cuts. I got to take him to emergency and you know what it is to have a family and you don't you don't even know what to do because you weren't taught this. And then the Lord said, "Oh, you're going to have a business over there." I never wanted a business. Never. And you're going to have one. Don't even know how to do it. Oh, you're going to start You're going to start ministering. I don't even like speaking in front of people. scared out of my wits for months. Still never like coming behind the pulpit. But I'm going to tell you, and through my all my years, I'm standing here today and I got one thing with me that I've had from the beginning. I wouldn't trade it for anything. I will trust the Lord for every situation &gt;&gt; because that's what it's going to take me through. &gt;&gt; I don't need to know about the end. I don't need to know what's going to happen. All I need to do is trust him. And he he he places the light in front of you for one step at a time. You do what he says, you put lights in the next one, and then you keep going. It's a walk of faith. Thy word is a lamp to our feet and a light to our path. When you learn to trust God's for everything is when things turn out better. All right. Verse two. That he no longer should live the rest of his life in the time of flesh and the lust of men. Think about this. That you should no longer live the rest of your time in the flesh to what? To the lust of other men, but to the will of God. That's what God has called us to do. For the time passed of our life may suffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles when he walked in the lascivious, lust, excessive wine, revelings, banquetings, you know, all the things that are in the world. And think about this, the people that in the world wherein they think it's a strange thing that you don't run with them to do the same excess of riot, they speak evil of you when you stand for God. They say, "Hey, come on. Let's go do this. They think it's strange that you don't want to do it. They'll even speak evil of you." Hey, that's part of the persecution. They that live godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer persecution. Who shall give an account to him that is ready to judge the quick and the dead? All right, let's drop down to verse 12. Oh, there's so much I you just Well, we can make copies and hand copies out to everybody. You just go home and, you know, finish this on on your time. 1 Peter 4:12 says, "Beloved, think it not strange concerning the fiery trial, which is to try you as though some strange thing has happened to you." Now, I'm pretty sure we all can say we're not in that trial now. We can say that we were either just in that trial. I'm sure sometime in the past we were in this trial and it was a fiery trial and we thought, why in the world do I have to go through this? And so Peter's saying, 'D don't think it's strange concerning the fiery trial that's which is to try you as though some strange thing happened unto you. It's not a strange thing. God orchestrated this. He knew it was going to happen years ago and he knew the time it was going to happen and he's going to supply the grace to go through it. You got to trust in his grace. You have to learn to be content. You have to learn and trust God that you can do all things through Christ now because he strengthened you for this trial. So verse 13 says, "But rejoice in as much as you are partakers of Christ's suffering that ye that when his glory shall be revealed, you may be glad also with exceeding joy." Now you know what? If when God finally, this is the truth. You know when you've gone through a trial and you murmured and you complain and you doubted and the trial subsides and you're happy about that it's that it's over but you know you failed because you didn't trust him. &gt;&gt; And you know what that means, right? That means another trial is coming. It may not be the exact same one because God uses all different trials &gt;&gt; to build our character. But God wants us to be glad with exceeding joy. Remember the Lord bless you and keep you, make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto you. Remember God has blessed you with grace. Just believe for it. Verse 14. If you be reprobate, no, I'm sorry. If you be reproached for the name of Christ, happy are you. For the spirit of glory and God resteth upon you. On their part, he is evil spoken of, but on your part, he is glorified. But let none of you suffer for doing the wrong thing. Let me just say it like that. A murderer, a thief, an evildoer, a busy body, another, it just doesn't matter. Don't suffer from doing the wrong thing. Yet if any man suffer as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this behalf. For the time is for the time is come that judgment must begin at the house of God. And if it first begin with us, what shall the end of them that obey not the gospel of God? And if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and the sinner appear? Wherefore let him that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their innermost part of them, their soul, to him in welloing as unto a faithful creator. God is a faithful creator. He's not only he didn't only create our salvation, but he keeps us. He just doesn't give us grace to be saved. He gives us grace now to walk with him in life. Oh, what what a wonderful thing it is to walk with God. God has blessed us. He is keeping us, right? The Lord bless thee and keep thee. The Lord is keeping us in the middle of our trial. God is with us. Don't doubt it. Don't question it. The Lord will be gracious to you. All right. First, I quoted this. I'll just read it. First Corinthians 10:13. There have no temptation taken you. But what s is as common to man. But God is faithful. He will not suffer you to go through anything above that you're able. But will with the temptation, he will also make a way of escape that you may be out of bed. Now notice the way of escape is his grace. He gives you grace to bear it. He doesn't take it away always. I mean, I I would not want to go through life without God. &gt;&gt; I would not want to go through trials without God. &gt;&gt; I would be blaming everybody. I would be I would not be the same John Martin right now. I would be so mean. [laughter] I would not be the same person. We would, none of us would be the same person. Christ comes in and his grace changes our nature. Praise God. Verse 19. I want to read Philippians 4:1 19. We never got to this. I wanted to read it. I don't know how far we're going to get. But my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and glory by Christ Jesus. So, what is your what is your what does your trial need? What does your situation need right now? Now, remember, we can't be saying things like, I want God to take this away. No, but what does it need? We we need to trust in his grace &gt;&gt; because the only way God is going to supply all your need is by trusting him. &gt;&gt; If you don't trust him, how can you expect God to bless you? &gt;&gt; Paul said, "My God, my God." He made it wasn't the God of the Bible. It wasn't the It wasn't Paul's God. or Moses is God or Peter's go. Paul said to the Philippian church, "My God shall supply all your need." It's the God that you trust in. We know God is God. You you you remember when uh Judas was asking Jesus not a scariot, how is it that you will reveal our yourself to us but not to the world? Remember when he asked that question? How is it that some Christians seem their needs seem to they just seem to be blessed and their their needs are being met and others there's just a a struggle. Now I this is not a blanket statement for everybody but you understand because it's not a blanket statement for for everybody. Look what Job went through there. You know he he didn't do nothing wrong. He was a perfect in the sight of God. But yet he went through the trial. But I'm just saying how do you ex without faith it's impossible to please God. So we have to trust God in our trial if we want to get the upper hand. If we want to get the advantage of what we're going to get, if we want to get more peace, more grace, more contentment, then we got to trust him more. The key is trusting God. Paul had a revelation that God's grace was sufficient to meet all his needs. That God's grace was enough for him. We don't have to search it. And I'm telling you, we all have that today. We all have God's grace today. We don't need anything else. We just need to look to him more. &gt;&gt; God didn't put anything on us that we need God's grace and something else, right? We just need God's grace and grace alone. So I say to you, church, the Lord bless you. The Lord keep you. The Lord make his countenance to shine upon you and be gracious to you. God give us peace. All right. Do we got time for just it's a little blessing? I want to encourage you. Okay. All right. It's it's about how powerful God's grace is. Luke 22:31. And this is where um Jesus is talking to Peter and he just pretty much tells them what's happening in the spiritual realm when he's going through he's going to be going through a trial. And the Lord said unto Peter, he said,"Simon, Simon, behold, Satan has desired to have you and to sift you like wheat." I wanted to bring a sifter with me on this one. A little visual. You've seen those sifters that sift out the flour. So, here it is. Jesus is telling Peter, "This is what Satan wants to do to you spiritually." Spiritually now, but I have prayed for you, that your faith fail not. And when you aren't converted, then you got a job to do. Strengthen your brothers. And he said unto him,"Lord, I don't know what you got going in your mind right now, but according to my understanding, I am ready to go with thee both into prison and to death. My mind is made up." And he said, 'I tell you, Peter, the shall not crow this day, the same day that we're speaking before thou shalt deny that shall that that thou shalt three times deny me that you even know me. Wow, that would not been a good sermon to listen to be at. But Jesus spoke the truth. See, a lot of times our feelings and our emotions, we feel like we're sold out to God. Right? Hours later, you know what Jesus asked? Told Peter? Can't you pray with me one hour? You said you're ready to go to prison and death for me. I can't even get you to pray for one hour. What is going on? Mark chapter 14 verse 66. And Peter was beneath the palace. And there come one of the maids of the high priest. And when she saw Peter warming himself by the fire, she took she looked upon him and said, "Art thou also uh and thou also was with Jesus of Nazareth?" But he denied, saying, I know not. Neither understand. I don't even know what you're TALKING ABOUT. I DON'T I DON'T EVEN REMEMBER THAT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW JESUS. And he went out into the porch and the crew. And a maid saw him again and began to say to them that stood by, "This is one of them." And he denied it again. And a little later after that, there stood by uh they that stood by again to Peter, surely thou art one of them, for thou art Galilean, and thy speech agreeth thereto. But he began to curse and to swear, saying, I know not this man of whom ye speak. And the second time and and the second time the crew Peter called to his mind, it came to his mind the word that Jesus said unto him before the crow twice, thou shalt deny me three times. And when he thought thereupon, he wept. This is how important it is to believe the word of God over how we feel about the word of God. The word of God is always right. But I want to say this. Do you notice Jesus prayed for Peter that his faith failed not? Peter fell, but he got back up. You notice he didn't stay down for 20 years. He got back up. He went in to the upper room and he got the Holy Ghost. And that's what we need to do is get the Holy Ghost. But I'll say it like this. Do you know Jesus prayed for you too in St. John chapter 17? He prayed for everybody sitting here. And I believe with all my heart if you can receive it, he prayed that your faith wouldn't fail, that we would be one. And I'll tell you, when Peter went and got the Holy Ghost, he became, that was the beginning of his nature change. That was the beginning of his nature change. Not when he was casting out devils, not when he was using the name of Jesus, because that all happened before he got the Holy Ghost. The Holy Ghost is what gives us a nature change. It actually changes our nature and makes us what we ought to be. Let's stand together. The Lord bless you and keep you. The Lord make his face to shine upon you and be gracious unto thee. The Lord lift up his countenance and give thee peace. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, encouraging the Hebrew church, he said, "Let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace." Amen. &gt;&gt; That we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in a time of need. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's sing Marvelous Grace. Marvelous grace of our loving Lord. grace that exceeds our sin and our guilt. Y on Calary's mount outpour there where the blood of the lamb was spilled. Grace, grace, God's grace. Grace that will pardon and cleanse within. Grace. Grace. God's grace. Grace that is greater than all our sin. Thin and despair like the sea waves cold threatening the soul with infinite loss. Praise that is greater. Yes, grace untold points to the refuge the mighty cross. Praise. grace. God's grace. Grace that will pardon and cleanse within. Grace, grace, God's grace, grace that is greater than all our sin. Dark is the stain that we cannot hide. What can a veil to wash it away? Look, there is flowing a crimson tide. Wider than snow you may be today. Praise. Grace. God's grace. Grace that will pardon and cleanse within grace. Grace. God's grace. Grace that is greater than all our sin. marvelous, infinite, matchless grace freely bestowed on all who believe. You who are longing to see his face. Will you this moment his grace receive grace? grace. God's grace. Grace that will pardon and cleanse within grace. Grace, God's grace. Grace that is greater than all our sin. Amen. all our sin. &gt;&gt; Boy, that ought to make us that ought to make a Methodist shout. &gt;&gt; That'll just make us so happy. &gt;&gt; That God's grace can take care of all of our sin. &gt;&gt; Amen.
