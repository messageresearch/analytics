[36:26] verse 12
[36:27] in the original I really I when I when I
[36:31] looked this up and I read it I went
[36:33] oh wow
[36:35] praise the Lord verse 12.
[36:38] it says giving thanks at the same time
[36:41] to that father who called and qualified
[36:45] US
[36:47] I like that
[36:49] he called and qualified US for the
[36:54] portion of the Saints inheritance
[36:57] in the light
[37:00] amen
[37:02] amen
[37:04] God called us he qualified us and our
[37:08] inheritance is in the light
[37:11] praise the Lord praise the Lord amen and
[37:15] I I was thinking mom was studying just a
[37:17] little while ago
[37:19] um in verse 16
[37:21] you know it says for by him were all
[37:23] things created and that that are in
[37:25] heaven and that are in the earth visible
[37:27] and invisible whether they be Thrones or
[37:30] dominions or principalities or Powers
[37:33] all things were created by Him and for
[37:37] him and how dare the devil give him
[37:40] something that he already owned
[37:43] devil said oh I'll give you all this
[37:46] just Bow Down and Worship me I created
[37:49] it
[37:50] foreign
[37:52] that's what it said I created it
[37:57] praise the Lord amen so I have I've
[38:00] listened to the Masterpiece I think
[38:01] about 12 times
[38:03] and the other night when brother John
[38:05] called me then
[38:07] I've gone on the elliptical and I
[38:09] started listening again and I missed
[38:11] another I just went Lord wow
[38:15] so in the beginning of the Masterpiece
[38:16] brother Branham says so he says we
[38:19] realize that we're here in a negative
[38:21] form
[38:22] right
[38:24] so as long as there is a negative there
[38:28] has to be a positive
[38:31] and there cannot be a negative without a
[38:34] positive C because it's because of the
[38:36] positive that makes the negative now
[38:39] back in the age when brother Branham was
[38:44] alive
[38:46] we had 35 millimeter cameras and 110s
[38:50] and 125 cameras and that and and what
[38:52] you would do is so here all of you are
[38:55] here you are the reality
[38:57] you're the reality and I could get a
[39:00] camera
[39:00] and I could take a picture of you
[39:03] and the light impresses the reality
[39:08] onto the negative
[39:10] then I take the negative and I go and
[39:13] develop it
[39:15] when I develop the negative it's
[39:18] absolutely opposite of what the positive
[39:21] is
[39:22] if you ever look at a negative all the
[39:24] black is white and all the the white is
[39:26] black
[39:27] and when you take the negative then
[39:30] and you go and then you develop it on
[39:33] photo paper whether it's a black and
[39:35] white photograph or whether it's color
[39:38] then you get a positive off of that
[39:41] negative
[39:43] but when you get that positive you look
[39:46] at it and you say oh look I have this
[39:48] wonderful picture of all the church
[39:51] but that's not the reality
[39:56] that's just a copy it's just a a a a
[40:00] photo of the reality
[40:04] so brother Branham said so we see we
[40:06] realize that we are here in negative
[40:09] form
[40:11] we're just the negative
[40:14] and he says he says and as long as there
[40:18] is a negative
[40:20] and you're here
[40:22] there is a positive somewhere
[40:25] not a photograph
[40:28] of reality
[40:30] there is a positive somewhere
[40:33] because you can't have a negative
[40:36] without the positive somewhere
[40:40] praise the Lord
[40:42] praise the Lord
[40:44] you should be breaking up the tune
[40:48] if you really
[40:51] so see that's why we have sickness in
[40:53] this because well it's just the negative
[40:56] the negative is bound to all the things
[40:58] that we have in this world and and it's
[41:00] it's just the opposite but praise the
[41:03] Lord tonight I have a positive waiting
[41:07] for me in the heavens
[41:09] in this world I've just stepped down
[41:11] into this negative for just a little
[41:13] space of time praise the Lord amen
[41:16] he says there has to be an object
[41:19] somewhere or to strike for the light to
[41:22] strike the lens
[41:24] and you remember in Colossians 1 12 it
[41:27] said we have an inheritance in the light
[41:31] praise God amen amen
[41:35] so he says there has to be an object
[41:37] somewhere for the light to strike the
[41:39] lens or there would never be a negative
[41:47] but you're here
[41:54] you're here as a negative
[41:57] and you're wondering about whether
[41:59] you're going to make it or not
[42:02] you're wondering about whether you're a
[42:05] born-again son of God
[42:07] yet you're here in negative form
[42:13] praise the Lord amen
[42:16] it's for the light to strike the lens or
[42:18] there would not be any negative so when
[42:21] we see that our life here is in the
[42:24] negative and knowing that we are in the
[42:27] image of some life somewhere then we
[42:31] know that there is a positive somewhere
[42:33] that the light has struck and it's a
[42:36] reflected something here on Earth and we
[42:40] are only that reflection the genuine
[42:44] object is somewhere
[42:46] brother random says and if that isn't
[42:49] true
[42:50] I'm the worst deceived man in the world
[42:53] and I've spent my life in vain
[42:56] but I know beyond a shadow of a doubt
[42:58] that it's there see and that's why we
[43:01] are here see
[43:04] amen
[43:06] amen that's enough we could say a prayer
[43:08] and go home
[43:10] amen
[43:12] so it's a little difficult to
[43:15] um
[43:17] to
[43:18] I there was so much
[43:22] it's just so much so we'll see how far
[43:25] we get tonight
[43:27] so in in part one we introduced you to
[43:30] Michelangelo we and brother Brandon
[43:32] talked about Michelangelo's Moses and
[43:35] how that that was his sculpture and then
[43:37] he also talked about God being the
[43:40] master sculpture and the things that we
[43:42] brought out that that we need to
[43:44] remember that we need to really think
[43:46] about is that before you can have an
[43:49] image before you can make a masterpiece
[43:52] you have to have a vision of what you're
[43:55] going to make and then you have to be
[43:59] true to that Vision you can't vary from
[44:02] that Vision you can't you can't wave
[44:04] from it you've got to stay right with
[44:07] the vision the way it was given and then
[44:10] the other thing is that it's very exact
[44:12] you can't you can't start the work and
[44:15] then say oh no no I made a mistake I
[44:17] need to move it over here or his arm's
[44:18] not going to be part of the rock anymore
[44:20] or or you know you've got to be it's a
[44:23] very exacting process
[44:26] amen
[44:29] and he said and then so the last thing
[44:31] that that we talked about in in part one
[44:34] we we talked about how God was creating
[44:37] a masterpiece and we find out that
[44:39] actually God has been creating many
[44:41] masterpieces
[44:43] um he has one main Masterpiece that he's
[44:46] got hid in his mind that's his vision
[44:49] that he's going to make so we found out
[44:52] then that Michelangelo when he when he
[44:56] was so inspired and he saw the vision
[45:00] that he had when he saw it become in
[45:04] reality it's so inspired him that he
[45:07] smote it and he said speak
[45:09] amen
[45:11] so
[45:12] so we we went from that we we talked
[45:15] about Adam and Eve and and we talked
[45:18] about how that
[45:19] um
[45:20] God actually when he saw them he was
[45:23] inspired and he told Adam to speak and
[45:26] Adam did Adam named all the animals Adam
[45:28] had power over the Earth Adam had power
[45:31] over the Sun the moon the stars the wind
[45:33] he had he had dominion over the fishes
[45:36] of the sea in the land and all those
[45:37] things and and then he fell amen
[45:42] so then we went on in in part two if you
[45:45] remember so we went to that and the the
[45:49] thing that we wanted to look at was that
[45:52] a thought
[45:54] is the same as an attribute
[45:56] and that thought
[45:58] has to come before the word can come
[46:02] anytime that anything is spoke there's
[46:05] always a thought behind that word
[46:08] but when that word comes that is not the
[46:11] end game that is not what God's trying
[46:14] to do that's not what what you do when
[46:17] you like me right now words are coming
[46:20] out of my mouth and I'm trying to convey
[46:22] something that God has shown me that
[46:25] will get in you and the manifestation or
[46:29] the end point of that word is when that
[46:31] word comes alive
[46:33] so when God said let there be light he
[46:36] first thought about light he thought
[46:37] about what light was going to be and
[46:39] then when he said let there be light
[46:41] then there had to become a manifestation
[46:44] of light and when the manifestation of
[46:47] Light Came then he could say that is
[46:48] good
[46:49] and I can go on to the next thought amen
[46:53] so we found out also we found out that
[46:55] in the beginning God created the heavens
[46:57] and the Earth and we see that that word
[46:59] God is Elohim and he is he's the
[47:03] self-existing one he's alone with his
[47:06] thoughts he doesn't there's nobody else
[47:07] with him there's no one before him
[47:09] there's no one after him there's no
[47:10] other gods he said there is no other
[47:12] gods I don't even know him
[47:13] but when he was Elohim he dwelt alone
[47:16] with his thoughts but when he started to
[47:20] con condescend down to becoming the word
[47:24] he became the logos and that's how we
[47:28] see that in Saint John 1 where he says
[47:30] in the beginning was the word
[47:33] which is the logos which is the essence
[47:35] of God and the essence of God is all of
[47:39] God but now he's in a visible form he's
[47:42] in a pillar of fire form and that logos
[47:45] then can then move upon the face of the
[47:47] waters that logos then can speak the
[47:50] world into existence that logos then can
[47:53] create the angels and stars and just
[47:55] like it says in Colossians it tells um
[47:58] all these things are created by Him and
[48:01] for him and he wasn't talking about God
[48:03] Elohim
[48:06] he's talking about the logos
[48:08] he's talking about the essence of God
[48:11] so he says so the foundation then there
[48:15] has to be brother Branham said he said
[48:17] then every Masterpiece every sculpture
[48:19] every Masterpiece has to have to be put
[48:22] on a foundation he says you just don't
[48:23] spend your life's journey creating
[48:26] something and then taking it and putting
[48:29] on the side parking lot or something he
[48:31] says you want to make a foundation for
[48:33] it and and the prophet said that that
[48:36] God had a a foundation that he made in
[48:40] in the Book of Genesis and he says and
[48:42] it was actually he said it had four
[48:44] foundations which when we drew it on the
[48:47] board you know we we drew it as a square
[48:49] but as I thought about it the other day
[48:51] I thought maybe brother Branham because
[48:54] I don't know what brother Brandon was
[48:55] thinking but
[48:57] maybe he was more thinking of it as a
[48:59] pyramid One Foundation being Abraham
[49:02] being Faith then he said another a
[49:05] foundation built on faith then was Isaac
[49:07] which was love and then on top of love
[49:10] then became out of Isaac came Grace came
[49:14] Jacob and then out of Jacob came the
[49:17] Patriarchs and Joseph and Joseph was the
[49:20] Perfection and each one of them
[49:22] reflecting part of God
[49:26] and manifesting that as they were coming
[49:29] up and then once once you have the
[49:31] foundation laid then you can go and and
[49:34] get your your monument and place it upon
[49:39] that amen
[49:40] so so we talked about that and then we
[49:43] then we talked about the diamond
[49:45] brother Ben said it looked like a kite
[49:49] I said well I said it's the best I could
[49:51] draw a diamond but we found out that a
[49:54] diamond because brother Branham talks
[49:56] about the diamond in the Masterpiece he
[49:58] talks about he says when he went down to
[50:00] the in in Africa and he went to the
[50:02] diamond mine he said he was looking on
[50:04] the ground and they were kicking around
[50:05] these rocks and he said what are these
[50:08] and and the man told him he says that's
[50:10] a diamond
[50:11] and brother random says but that doesn't
[50:13] reflect you know like like mine
[50:16] it doesn't reflect and he says well it
[50:18] can't reflect until it's cut
[50:21] and you can't cut a diamond with
[50:22] anything you have to cut it with a
[50:24] diamond
[50:25] and then he also pointed out he said so
[50:27] he says when he when we cut the diamonds
[50:31] we don't waste any of those pieces when
[50:34] we cut them off he says we have little
[50:37] pieces in that and he says and we make
[50:38] them in the victrola needles and most of
[50:41] us don't even know what a victrola is
[50:43] anymore
[50:44] but it was very outstanding because in
[50:47] the in the message brother Bradham says
[50:49] he says he says then he says when you
[50:51] buy a record when you go to the store
[50:53] and you buy a record he says it's
[50:55] unheard music
[50:58] it has a there's a music on there
[51:00] there's something on there and he says
[51:02] and you put it on the the uh
[51:06] the turntable and he says and then you
[51:08] take a diamond to to make the unheard
[51:11] music become visible amen
[51:17] you need to go home and just meditate on
[51:21] because
[51:22] now we have gone I as I was working out
[51:25] yes the other day and I was I was
[51:27] listening to that I was thinking I
[51:29] thought wow you know the world has
[51:31] changed so much because now what we do
[51:34] to create music is we use a light
[51:42] in the evening time there shall be light
[51:45] you can't just look at this word light
[51:47] has to hit that word or you'll never see
[51:50] the the Hidden Music you'll never hear
[51:53] it you the light has to strike the word
[51:56] and that's what he said
[51:59] he said we are we have an inheritance in
[52:02] light
[52:03] so we talked about that and we talked
[52:06] about also how that that God when he
[52:10] went and got his great big diamond it
[52:13] was very rough looking and but then he
[52:17] chipped off a little piece and that
[52:19] little piece then became a reflection of
[52:23] what the Masterpiece was going to be
[52:25] and that little piece then became the
[52:28] prophets
[52:29] and then as we were going on on that so
[52:33] so we we I think that's kind of where we
[52:36] finished up and you know unfortunately
[52:39] we're in we're in the the
[52:42] this negative
[52:45] realm of time
[52:48] you know I have to get up and go to work
[52:50] in the morning we have to do all a lot
[52:51] of things that I mean
[52:52] the first service that we had I was so
[52:54] excited I wanted to preach so two in the
[52:57] morning
[52:58] amen
[53:00] so in the Masterpiece brother Brandon
[53:02] says so we want to continue on here he
[53:04] says so so he says now the foundation is
[53:06] laid through faith love Grace and on to
[53:10] Perfection through the Patriarchs now
[53:13] the Bodywork that come on to that Great
[53:15] Masterpiece was the prophets so he
[53:18] starts to tell us that Abraham Isaac
[53:22] Jacob and Joseph they they showed us
[53:26] something but they showed us something
[53:28] that was different than what the
[53:31] prophets did because the prophets were
[53:34] part of the Masterpiece that was going
[53:36] on top of the foundation and the
[53:38] difference between what the prophets had
[53:40] and what the foundation had is they did
[53:43] not have the law
[53:45] they did not have the word of God
[53:47] revealed to them
[53:49] it was it was still a God it was still
[53:52] God's thought
[53:53] it was hit it was it was hit alone with
[53:56] him because God doesn't repeat himself
[53:59] God doesn't he he doesn't waste time he
[54:02] doesn't waste our time you know he he
[54:05] doesn't
[54:06] so he says the body work that came onto
[54:09] this Great Masterpiece was the prophets
[54:11] which was the word so he says I hope you
[54:14] can read it see the prophets not the law
[54:17] the prophets for the prophets was the
[54:20] Vindicated word which makes the body not
[54:24] the Patriarchs the prophets they were
[54:27] the word so
[54:29] you have to see that the word of God
[54:32] even though you can quote it
[54:34] if there's no life in it if it never
[54:37] comes to manifestation it's dead letter
[54:40] and all it'll do is kill you
[54:43] that's all it'll do
[54:45] but that's not what God intended the
[54:47] word for God intended the word to be
[54:50] made manifest
[54:52] amen and that's what he could do with
[54:54] the prophets
[54:55] so let's just take an example here I
[54:58] want to go to Exodus 3.
[55:00] so just to show you a little bit
[55:04] praise the Lord amen
[55:11] so remember that
[55:14] it's it's it's really interesting
[55:17] to think that brother Brandon didn't
[55:20] just fill up tapes
[55:25] his motive wasn't to see if he could
[55:27] preach for six hours
[55:29] there was something he was trying to
[55:32] convey
[55:33] there there was something
[55:37] my so so anyways so remember we had the
[55:40] picture and we said okay we have a
[55:43] thought it has to become the word and
[55:45] then it has to become flesh right it has
[55:48] to become manifest
[55:49] so here in verse 12 now God has given
[55:52] his commission to Moses
[55:54] and God has spoken to Moses and this is
[55:58] God's thought
[56:00] spoken to Moses
[56:03] certainly I will be with thee and this
[56:06] should be a token unto thee that I have
[56:08] sent thee when thou Hast brought forth
[56:11] the people out of Egypt ye shall serve
[56:14] God Upon This Mountain you can take that
[56:17] to the bank
[56:18] thank you
[56:19] God is going to fulfill that but it was
[56:22] just a dead letter when Moses heard it
[56:26] Moses heard it he knew he was in the
[56:29] presence of God
[56:31] but that word had to be made manifest
[56:33] and he didn't even know how God was
[56:36] going to do it right
[56:37] he didn't know what was going to happen
[56:39] because when he went back down into
[56:41] Egypt it didn't just kind of go smooth
[56:45] and that's all part of God's plan of a
[56:48] masterpiece
[56:50] so if you go over here to Exodus 20
[56:53] now in Exodus 20
[56:57] Verse 18
[57:00] . so now
[57:01] God has fulfilled the promise
[57:05] that he gave to Moses
[57:08] but the children of Israel did not know
[57:11] that promise because it was not spoken
[57:14] to them it was only rehearsed in their
[57:16] ears
[57:22] but when when they got there verse 18 it
[57:26] says in all the people saw the
[57:28] thundering and the lightning and the
[57:30] noise of the trumpet and the mountain
[57:31] smoking and when the people saw it they
[57:34] removed and stood afar off and they said
[57:37] unto Moses speak thou with us
[57:40] and we will hear but let not God speak
[57:44] with us lest we die
[57:47] and God
[57:49] heard what they said
[57:51] and the prophets came into existence
[57:56] prior to that
[57:58] God would speak to whomever he wanted
[58:02] he would just he would he'd see brother
[58:05] Ron one day at work and he would just
[58:07] speak to brother Ryan
[58:08] but when the children of Israel rejected
[58:12] that relationship God said okay
[58:16] I can do that
[58:19] speak thou with us and we will hear but
[58:21] let not God speak with us lest we die
[58:24] and Moses protested see and Moses said
[58:27] unto the people fear not
[58:29] you know don't be afraid of God for God
[58:32] has come to prove you that his fear may
[58:36] be before your faces that you sin not
[58:40] because the fear of the Lord is the
[58:42] beginning of wisdom and if there is no
[58:45] if there's no judgment if there's no
[58:47] penalty then there is no fear
[58:51] right if we don't have the police we
[58:53] have lawlessness if we don't have God
[58:56] if we don't know that God will keep his
[58:58] word then then we're not worried about
[59:02] it but Hebrews tells us he says it's a
[59:05] fearful thing to fall into the hands of
[59:07] God amen amen
[59:10] so we find out so brother Brian I'm in
[59:13] the Masterpiece he says so see he says
[59:16] the law
[59:18] only did one thing the law showed us how
[59:22] Fallen we are
[59:24] the law shows us that we can't keep we
[59:28] can't even imagine of how to keep the
[59:30] word
[59:31] we can't do that but in the prophets
[59:34] because the prophets were a manifested
[59:38] chip
[59:39] off the great diamond
[59:42] they and and remember when we looked we
[59:45] said wait a minute
[59:47] it when Adam when Eve came out of Adam's
[59:51] side then every every cell in her every
[59:56] bone had the DNA of Adam
[1:00:03] and every piece that was broken off of
[1:00:07] The Great Masterpiece every piece that
[1:00:10] was broke off of the great Diamond had
[1:00:13] the same makeup as the diamond it had
[1:00:17] the same makeup but it was just a little
[1:00:20] piece amen amen
[1:00:23] so brother random said so finally
[1:00:27] he said as he started way back in the
[1:00:30] days of Moses and he come down through
[1:00:33] the prophets to each one and finally
[1:00:35] building up the body coming closer all
[1:00:39] the time
[1:00:40] and what is he coming closer to he's
[1:00:43] coming closer to the image that's in his
[1:00:46] mind
[1:00:47] why would he waste his time really why
[1:00:50] would he waste his time telling us about
[1:00:52] Michelangelo and explaining to us how a
[1:00:56] sculptor goes if he didn't want you to
[1:00:59] understand that so you could apply it to
[1:01:01] what God was doing
[1:01:04] you're going oh why is he talking about
[1:01:06] Michelangelo
[1:01:08] but the prophet was trying to get it to
[1:01:11] where you could see wait a minute wait a
[1:01:13] minute
[1:01:14] I'm starting to see something now
[1:01:17] it was coming he was building every time
[1:01:20] he chipped off a piece of the diamond
[1:01:21] and he showed Isaiah when he chipped off
[1:01:24] Jeremiah Jeremiah was a prophet from his
[1:01:28] mother's womb and if if that was true
[1:01:30] for Jeremiah that was true for every one
[1:01:32] of the prophets whether it was Obadiah
[1:01:35] or or nay home and and Ezekiel and and
[1:01:39] Malachi all of them they all were a chip
[1:01:43] off The Great Masterpiece
[1:01:46] now listen what brother Branham says he
[1:01:49] says
[1:01:50] and finally he was building up the body
[1:01:53] coming closer and closer all the time
[1:01:55] and the greatest of all of them was
[1:02:01] who was it no it wasn't
[1:02:05] it wasn't
[1:02:06] you made the same mistake the Pharisees
[1:02:08] made
[1:02:10] really no
[1:02:12] when you really
[1:02:15] John the Baptist was
[1:02:21] let's look at Luke 16.
[1:02:27] praise the Lord
[1:02:33] Luke 16 16.
[1:02:38] and look at what he says I it's
[1:02:42] the law and the prophets were unto John
[1:02:49] since that time the kingdom of God is
[1:02:52] preached the Masterpiece has been
[1:02:56] revealed
[1:02:59] John looked so much like the masterpiece
[1:03:04] that they all said
[1:03:05] aren't you him
[1:03:08] aren't you the Messiah aren't you the
[1:03:11] Christ
[1:03:12] aren't you Malachi aren't you that
[1:03:15] Prophet that's going to come and restore
[1:03:16] the world aren't you are you see he
[1:03:19] looks so much he was so much in the
[1:03:22] image but he wasn't the image
[1:03:26] praise the Lord
[1:03:28] praise the Lord Brother random said he
[1:03:30] said
[1:03:31] he said in the greatest of all of them
[1:03:33] was John and that's why that's why Jesus
[1:03:38] in Matthew 5 when they came to him and
[1:03:40] they started arguing to me said think
[1:03:42] not that I have come to destroy the law
[1:03:48] which is my foundation and the prophets
[1:03:51] which are all my little pieces of me
[1:03:55] because when you've seen a prophet
[1:03:57] you've seen God
[1:03:59] Jesus told him he said didn't you call
[1:04:01] the prophets gods
[1:04:03] because they were little diamonds off of
[1:04:06] the great diamond
[1:04:07] amen praise the Lord
[1:04:09] all of God's thoughts being manifest in
[1:04:13] the hour that he wanted it to be made
[1:04:15] manifest amen if you read if you read
[1:04:18] Isaiah every prophecy that Isaiah gave
[1:04:21] think about it Isaiah went down to the
[1:04:24] um to the king and he said will you
[1:04:27] weary God
[1:04:29] will you marry him he says ask me a sign
[1:04:32] and the heavens above are on the earth
[1:04:34] below and the King says oh I got a
[1:04:36] prophet and he's mad
[1:04:40] um
[1:04:41] and he said behold I will give you a
[1:04:45] super sign
[1:04:47] Behold a virgin shall conceive right
[1:04:51] think about it it was a thought first
[1:04:55] then it had to come that thought had to
[1:04:59] be channeled into that piece of diamond
[1:05:02] that thought was a light and when it
[1:05:05] came into that diamond though you saw
[1:05:07] the light
[1:05:08] a virgin shall conceive but that's not
[1:05:11] the end of the story
[1:05:15] oh it looked like the end of the story
[1:05:17] because it was 700 years later before it
[1:05:20] did its final part and became the
[1:05:22] manifestation
[1:05:24] it never made it less of the word it was
[1:05:26] still the word but the word is not
[1:05:29] complete until it's manifested
[1:05:32] amen praise the Lord
[1:05:35] amen
[1:05:38] so the greatest of all of them was John
[1:05:40] the Bible said so Jesus said so and
[1:05:44] there is not a man ever born a woman as
[1:05:46] great as John the Baptist for he was the
[1:05:49] one that could introduce
[1:05:52] the word
[1:05:55] he was the one that introduced Christ
[1:05:59] he was the one
[1:06:01] it was he he looked so much like him
[1:06:05] he was the first cousin
[1:06:09] he was
[1:06:11] he was the one that could pull the veil
[1:06:13] back
[1:06:15] and say Behold the Lamb of God
[1:06:19] no other Prophet said that
[1:06:22] when Isaiah said behold a virgin shall
[1:06:24] conceive
[1:06:25] Mary
[1:06:27] when she heard that word All She had she
[1:06:31] had no you know she had nothing to do
[1:06:34] except
[1:06:36] it or say this is too hard for me
[1:06:41] that I said just two choices
[1:06:47] and the word the word came into
[1:06:51] existence
[1:06:52] the Masterpiece came
[1:06:56] God's Masterpiece that he had hid before
[1:07:00] the foundation of the world the only the
[1:07:02] only evidence that he ever gave that he
[1:07:04] was going to do this great thing was
[1:07:07] when he told Adam and Eve and The
[1:07:10] Serpent and he said I
[1:07:13] the sir the woman's seed will bruise
[1:07:16] your head and you will bruise his heel
[1:07:19] amen
[1:07:21] and they had no idea what he was going
[1:07:23] to do and how he was going to do it
[1:07:26] otherwise they'd never destroyed him
[1:07:29] amen
[1:07:31] so what is the difference you know when
[1:07:34] you think about it so you've got this
[1:07:35] big diamond here and you've you've
[1:07:37] chipped off all these small diamonds and
[1:07:42] and what it is going to do is you're
[1:07:44] going to reveal the master Diamond
[1:07:47] inside of it
[1:07:49] so they're all reflections
[1:07:51] but brother Branham said he said well he
[1:07:54] said listen he goes all of the prophets
[1:07:57] had flaws
[1:08:00] that's why they could never be the
[1:08:03] masterpiece
[1:08:07] they could not be the Masterpiece
[1:08:09] because they had flaws Moses had a
[1:08:11] temper
[1:08:12] right
[1:08:14] all of them had some problems some
[1:08:16] little thing that that tripped them up
[1:08:18] all the time but that did not
[1:08:22] that did not separate them from the
[1:08:26] masterpiece
[1:08:29] your flaws if you are a negative
[1:08:33] of a positive somewhere there is nothing
[1:08:36] that can separate you from the love of
[1:08:38] Christ there is nothing no nothing
[1:08:41] nothing
[1:08:43] there is nothing
[1:08:46] that's why I'm crazy I just when I think
[1:08:49] about all of my flaws I go Lord I got
[1:08:52] way too many flaws in me because it
[1:08:55] it's not looking at my flaws he's
[1:08:58] looking at the Masterpiece and I'm a
[1:09:01] chip off of him amen
[1:09:03] all the prophets had flaws all the ones
[1:09:06] there was a portion but here at last
[1:09:09] coming up through that finally comes the
[1:09:12] Masterpiece the perfect one no fault in
[1:09:15] him at all so perfect reflected of the
[1:09:19] Builder himself
[1:09:21] praise the Lord that which was hidden in
[1:09:23] his mind was now coming into reality
[1:09:26] amen just like when we looked at the
[1:09:29] picture and we saw Moses nobody had seen
[1:09:32] Moses but Michelangelo that Vision it so
[1:09:36] was impressed on his mind that he spent
[1:09:39] 40 Years of his life building that thing
[1:09:42] to make it exactly remember we talked
[1:09:45] about even down to the hairs
[1:09:49] God knows exactly
[1:09:53] how we're all going to turn out
[1:09:57] praise the Lord his own image was
[1:10:00] reflected in his work God and Christ
[1:10:02] were one and so much until he put his
[1:10:05] own Spirit into him and then when the
[1:10:07] image and the Builder became one God and
[1:10:10] His scripture his sculpture work his
[1:10:13] Masterpiece where Moses was in the work
[1:10:17] of Saint Angelo or Michelangelo rather
[1:10:19] was a sculpture work that was dead
[1:10:24] right
[1:10:26] because it was granite
[1:10:28] but God
[1:10:30] has has materials that he's building his
[1:10:35] Masterpiece out of
[1:10:37] and he's not like you and me you know
[1:10:39] like brother John he's going to build
[1:10:41] his wife out of love he's building her a
[1:10:43] greenhouse okay so brother John has to
[1:10:46] go and and gather up materials and if he
[1:10:49] gets the wrong materials he's going to
[1:10:51] take her back and get other materials
[1:10:52] until he gets the right materials not so
[1:10:54] with God
[1:10:56] because God thinks it then he speaks it
[1:10:59] and it is
[1:11:00] and when it comes into manifestation
[1:11:03] amen when he built his word the world he
[1:11:08] built it with his word
[1:11:10] amen amen amen
[1:11:13] amen
[1:11:15] the sculpture's work was dead
[1:11:17] Michelangelo's because it was made out
[1:11:20] of stone but here the master builder
[1:11:23] amen when he got his handiwork perfected
[1:11:29] and each one of those prophets when he
[1:11:31] chipped him off he was hoping for
[1:11:33] Perfection but they fell
[1:11:36] then he'd chip off another piece and
[1:11:38] become more into the image it's
[1:11:41] interesting because he's chipping him
[1:11:43] off and you think well I don't need that
[1:11:45] no more no not God God doesn't throw
[1:11:47] anything away
[1:11:49] he's not going to throw us away he just
[1:11:51] chips you off
[1:11:52] and then he works with you
[1:11:54] they chipped him off and all the time
[1:11:57] he's making his body work it's getting
[1:11:59] closer and closer and closer in His
[1:12:01] image and then John comes and John's so
[1:12:04] much like him they all think that all of
[1:12:08] Jerusalem was moved the hall went out to
[1:12:10] hear him preach they all looked at him
[1:12:13] they said oh this is this has got to be
[1:12:15] the Messiah and he says but I'm not
[1:12:18] and then I thought I thought
[1:12:21] wow John's Ministry was so small he
[1:12:24] didn't have a thought a flaw
[1:12:26] and I thought about it and I said yeah
[1:12:29] he did
[1:12:31] he had a flaw
[1:12:32] when he got down into prison
[1:12:35] his Eagle Eye got filmed over and he
[1:12:38] doubted the one the way he act the man
[1:12:42] that he actually said Behold the Lamb of
[1:12:45] God when he got in prison he said
[1:12:48] did I goof up
[1:12:50] was that maybe maybe maybe I didn't see
[1:12:53] the dove descend may maybe maybe maybe
[1:12:57] you're not who I mean because this isn't
[1:12:59] working out the way I thought it would
[1:13:02] this is just not the way it you know I I
[1:13:04] had I had Greater Image of what I
[1:13:06] thought was going to happen and and
[1:13:08] Jesus looked and said
[1:13:10] he said when you went and saw John
[1:13:12] what'd you go out to see
[1:13:15] a man in fine robes did you go out to
[1:13:18] see a reed shaking in the wind he says
[1:13:22] no he says you saw not only a prophet
[1:13:25] but you saw more than a prophet
[1:13:29] amen because he introduced the
[1:13:32] masterpiece
[1:13:34] God's Masterpiece the total reflection
[1:13:38] of the invisible God
[1:13:41] that's what John said in 114.
[1:13:45] he said we'd heard the word we saw the
[1:13:47] word
[1:13:48] and we handled the word
[1:13:51] the word became flesh and we touched it
[1:13:54] the word became flesh and we sat down
[1:13:57] and ate with him the word became flesh
[1:13:59] and we saw him multiply Five Loaves and
[1:14:03] and you know the fishes and and we saw
[1:14:06] him raise the dead we we were partakers
[1:14:09] of the heavenly
[1:14:11] amen amen praise the Lord amen amen and
[1:14:17] brother Branham said so he says when the
[1:14:18] sculptor worked he says because here the
[1:14:21] master builder when he got his handiwork
[1:14:24] perfected he stepped into it
[1:14:28] amen so I want to let's let's go to
[1:14:31] Matthew 3. so I'm going to take a look
[1:14:33] at this
[1:14:35] praise the Lord
[1:14:42] Matthew 3
[1:14:45] verse 16.
[1:14:47] so it says in Jesus when he was baptized
[1:14:50] went up straight way out of the water
[1:14:52] and lo the heavens were open unto him
[1:14:54] and he saw the spirit of God descending
[1:14:57] like a dove and lighting upon him and lo
[1:15:01] a voice from Heaven saying this is my
[1:15:04] beloved Son and whom I am well pleased
[1:15:08] amen now I want to go over here and look
[1:15:11] at how Mark looks at this Mark 1.
[1:15:15] amen
[1:15:19] Mark 1 verse 10.
[1:15:21] so it says and straightway coming up out
[1:15:25] of the water he saw the heavens open in
[1:15:27] the spirit like a dove descending upon
[1:15:29] him and there came a voice from Heaven
[1:15:31] saying Thou Art my beloved Son in whom I
[1:15:35] am well pleased he was so proud of his
[1:15:39] masterpiece
[1:15:40] let's go to Luke 3.
[1:15:43] amen
[1:15:46] amen
[1:15:48] Michelangelo when he stepped back and he
[1:15:51] saw Moses he saw him he said oh this is
[1:15:55] this is that
[1:15:58] verse 21 it says now Luke 3 21 he says
[1:16:02] so now when all the people were baptized
[1:16:04] it came to pass that Jesus also being
[1:16:07] baptized and praying the heaven was
[1:16:09] opened and the Holy Ghost descended in a
[1:16:12] bodily shape like a dove upon him and a
[1:16:15] voice Came From Heaven which said Thou
[1:16:18] Art my beloved Son and whom I am well
[1:16:21] pleased praise the Lord
[1:16:24] he stepped into his masterpiece
[1:16:27] but you notice there's something missing
[1:16:31] and all three of those scriptures
[1:16:33] there's something missing
[1:16:37] he never told him to speak
[1:16:44] because you can't be a masterpiece
[1:16:46] unless you go to the Hall of the critics
[1:16:52] Luke says in straightway he was driven
[1:16:54] into the wilderness
[1:16:55] Matthew says that he went out into the
[1:16:58] Wilderness and fasted 40 days and the
[1:17:00] devil came and tempted him
[1:17:03] and you know that everything that Jesus
[1:17:05] did from that day forward to mount
[1:17:08] Transfiguration
[1:17:09] was God trying him
[1:17:15] it was God trying him and him having to
[1:17:18] wait
[1:17:19] wait for that Vision to come before he
[1:17:22] could move
[1:17:23] waiting for the vision before he could
[1:17:26] raise the dead waiting for the vision to
[1:17:29] know what to do because he said I do
[1:17:31] nothing
[1:17:32] right
[1:17:34] amen
[1:17:36] he has to go through the Hall of the
[1:17:38] critics before he can speak
[1:17:41] now brother Branham he brings another
[1:17:44] Parable into the masterpiece
[1:17:48] and he starts this story about the
[1:17:50] Chinese
[1:17:51] and he says when the Chinese came over
[1:17:53] here he says they didn't know our
[1:17:55] language he says they didn't know
[1:17:57] you know how to how to communicate with
[1:18:00] us he says but they were good laundromen
[1:18:03] I said okay
[1:18:05] and he says but when you took your dirty
[1:18:08] clothes
[1:18:09] to the to the he said now he
[1:18:14] said he would give you a piece of paper
[1:18:17] and of course you know you could sign
[1:18:19] your name and leave your address and
[1:18:21] everything else but he's got to have
[1:18:22] something so he knows
[1:18:23] and and if if you duplicated it if you
[1:18:26] wrote it twice and gave it to somebody
[1:18:28] else and they could come but he says
[1:18:30] what the Chinese did is he says they
[1:18:33] ripped a piece of paper in half
[1:18:35] and they were careful how they tore it
[1:18:37] and they gave you half the paper and
[1:18:40] they kept half the paper
[1:18:42] he said so that when you came back
[1:18:45] and your clothes were now very clean
[1:18:49] and folded
[1:18:52] the two pieces of paper would match
[1:18:56] and you got the clean
[1:18:59] and the dirty was washed away
[1:19:02] [Music]
[1:19:03] [Laughter]
[1:19:07] yeah praise the Lord
[1:19:12] brother Branham says so when God by the
[1:19:14] prophets and now remember we read the
[1:19:17] baptism right
[1:19:18] so he got baptized
[1:19:20] but he was never told to speak
[1:19:23] his mother went to him and said she told
[1:19:26] she told it wasn't Jesus saying daddy
[1:19:29] told me to change the water in the wine
[1:19:31] she came to him and said and she told
[1:19:34] the servant she says whatever he says
[1:19:36] you do what he says
[1:19:39] and they came
[1:19:41] and
[1:19:43] he changed the water in the wine
[1:19:46] so everything that he did up to mount
[1:19:48] Transfiguration so and we'll get to that
[1:19:50] in a minute
[1:19:51] so he says and when God by the prophets
[1:19:54] and under the law condemned us to sin
[1:19:57] and the law has no Grace it only tells
[1:20:00] you you're a sinner amen
[1:20:03] I mean if you if you really sit down and
[1:20:05] think about it you know even the Paschal
[1:20:07] Lamb and the scapegoat and the turtle
[1:20:10] doves and all the the Bullocks and
[1:20:12] everything that they sacrificed none of
[1:20:15] that could wash away sin
[1:20:17] none of that could make you justified in
[1:20:19] the sight of God
[1:20:21] the only way you were justified in the
[1:20:23] sight of God is if if the priest said
[1:20:25] God has accepted this based on the law
[1:20:29] that you have fulfilled the law but you
[1:20:31] just went right back out a rank sinner
[1:20:33] just like you always were
[1:20:35] amen
[1:20:37] amen
[1:20:39] but when Jesus came on the scene he was
[1:20:42] the Fulfillment he was the Fulfillment
[1:20:45] of everything God had promised
[1:20:49] and what was that all of the law that
[1:20:53] Moses had given plus all of the
[1:20:56] prophecies that each little Diamond had
[1:20:59] prophesied
[1:21:01] and Jesus was the Fulfillment it was he
[1:21:05] was the period of every one of those
[1:21:09] because every sentence ends with period
[1:21:11] unless you got poor
[1:21:13] penmanship
[1:21:16] right
[1:21:17] Jesus was the conclusion of it he was he
[1:21:20] was the Fulfillment of everything that
[1:21:23] God had promised he was the perfect
[1:21:26] identical image of the promise
[1:21:32] Moses couldn't do that
[1:21:34] you remember brother Branham talked
[1:21:36] about it he said when when Jesus when
[1:21:38] when the devil came to Jesus and he took
[1:21:41] him up on the mountain he says hey he
[1:21:43] goes I see you've been fast in 40 days
[1:21:45] and I see you're a little bit hungry he
[1:21:46] says Journey stones in the bread
[1:21:50] Jesus had the power to do that
[1:21:53] you have the power to do that
[1:21:57] you have the power to speak a world and
[1:21:58] go live on it love
[1:22:01] but you're a negative
[1:22:05] and the negatives got flaws
[1:22:09] they navigated this guy shirt comings
[1:22:12] and
[1:22:14] when brother Brandon said it like this
[1:22:15] he says when when the devil went to
[1:22:18] Jesus and he tempted him with the stones
[1:22:20] to turn the stones into bread he says he
[1:22:23] says he realized he had not met Moses
[1:22:30] because Jesus came back and defeated him
[1:22:34] with the Living Word of God
[1:22:37] because he was the Living Word of God
[1:22:41] he was the Masterpiece how about your
[1:22:43] power he had without the authority
[1:22:49] praise the Lord amen
[1:22:52] The Identical image of the promise
[1:22:54] therefore all the promises all the
[1:22:57] promises of the Old Testament was met in
[1:22:59] Jesus Christ it couldn't be met in Moses
[1:23:01] it couldn't be met in any other prophets
[1:23:03] but it was met in the Masterpiece it
[1:23:07] matched all that it said it was going to
[1:23:10] be
[1:23:12] and then I thought well there's that
[1:23:14] again
[1:23:18] therefore The Chinamen you could claim
[1:23:20] where the law condemns you and said you
[1:23:22] were dirty and you were guilty and could
[1:23:24] not and and could put you in the prison
[1:23:27] but when he came back
[1:23:30] Jesus when he come back he was the match
[1:23:33] peace for it
[1:23:34] that could take you out
[1:23:37] and every one of us
[1:23:39] when we were in God's thinking
[1:23:42] God take a little piece of paper
[1:23:45] your birth certificate and he cut it in
[1:23:47] half
[1:23:47] he ripped it in half and he gave you
[1:23:50] half of it and he sent you down here as
[1:23:52] a negative
[1:23:54] and you got that thing all dirty you got
[1:23:57] it all messed up but one day the light
[1:23:59] came and you saw the Masterpiece and
[1:24:03] when you went to the Masterpiece with
[1:24:05] your piece of the ticket
[1:24:07] because now are we the sons of God Amen
[1:24:11] when you go back with your piece of the
[1:24:13] ticket he's got the ticket that says yes
[1:24:19] and now I gave him my old filthy
[1:24:22] garments he gave me a robe of pure white
[1:24:26] hallelujah
[1:24:27] hallelujah the Masterpiece amen
[1:24:30] amen
[1:24:33] but see when he came he was the match
[1:24:35] piece for it he could take you out and
[1:24:38] bring you back to the complete ticket
[1:24:40] the Redemption that God had promised
[1:24:44] back in the Garden of Eden thy seed
[1:24:48] shall bruise the Serpent's head but his
[1:24:50] heels shall bruise
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:54] and brother Madam says so on and on we
[1:24:56] could go because he was simply he was
[1:24:59] the match of David
[1:25:01] David and all of his flaws and his
[1:25:04] failures and adultery and everything
[1:25:05] else he only had half the ticket
[1:25:08] but Jesus had the other half of the
[1:25:10] ticket
[1:25:11] and when he Rose when he rose from the
[1:25:14] dead the graves were opened and the two
[1:25:17] tickets matched in David Rose
[1:25:19] amen the two tickets matched in Jeremiah
[1:25:23] Rose the two tickets match and Isaiah
[1:25:25] came on the face of the Earth all
[1:25:27] because Jesus Christ is my perfect
[1:25:30] sacrifice oh because he's the one he's
[1:25:34] the one that's paid the debt he's the
[1:25:36] one that met the requirements of the
[1:25:38] word because I frankly I just can't do
[1:25:41] it right amen amen
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:47] he was the match of David he was the
[1:25:50] match of Moses he was the match of
[1:25:52] Elijah he was the match of Joseph
[1:25:54] everything that is portrayed or foretold
[1:25:56] by him in the Old Testament matched
[1:26:00] right into what what was it what was it
[1:26:04] because now you think about it so you
[1:26:06] got two Parables here you got one where
[1:26:08] the but then again you got the
[1:26:10] diamond and now all those little pieces
[1:26:13] when they come back they all fit in a
[1:26:16] perfect place in the diamond
[1:26:18] amen
[1:26:20] amen
[1:26:22] praise the Lord
[1:26:25] the perfect Redeemer
[1:26:28] that we could put our old dirty clothes
[1:26:30] into the laundry and then go down and
[1:26:32] claim it again it's been washed in the
[1:26:34] blood of the Lamb we can claim what's
[1:26:37] our own
[1:26:39] I don't claim the sin-filled life I'm
[1:26:43] not claiming the negative I'm claiming
[1:26:45] my inheritance the positive amen
[1:26:48] amen and the proof that there's a
[1:26:51] positive there is you see me
[1:26:54] that's the proof that I'm there amen
[1:26:58] amen
[1:27:01] we can claim what's our own and
[1:27:03] everything that he died for we can claim
[1:27:05] it so he is he was the perfect word
[1:27:08] portrayed
[1:27:09] so perfect a redeemer of a man so
[1:27:12] perfect so Godly yet there was no beauty
[1:27:16] that we should desire him
[1:27:18] no reason brother Branham said that is
[1:27:20] because when he preached the Masterpiece
[1:27:22] he used Isaiah 53.
[1:27:25] that was his opening text
[1:27:27] and he says so there is no beauty that
[1:27:29] we should desire him and when this
[1:27:31] virgin-born son of the Living God became
[1:27:34] so perfect so humble and in the image of
[1:27:38] God until the Great Master who had
[1:27:41] brought his life up through the prophets
[1:27:44] you see I'm not making this up he
[1:27:47] brought them right up through the
[1:27:50] prophets
[1:27:51] and he was the fulfilling of all the
[1:27:54] prophets he was so perfect until God
[1:27:57] seeing this
[1:27:59] not only at at his baptism he stepped
[1:28:03] into his masterpiece
[1:28:05] because that's what he said
[1:28:09] he smote him and he cried out speak as
[1:28:13] Michelangelo did speak
[1:28:17] and you say
[1:28:18] is that so
[1:28:22] mark 9.
[1:28:24] amen
[1:28:30] Mark 9 and verse 2.
[1:28:32] and after six days
[1:28:34] Jesus talked taketh with him Peter James
[1:28:37] and John and leaded them up into the
[1:28:39] high mountain apart from themselves and
[1:28:42] he was transfigured before them and his
[1:28:44] Ramen became shining exceeding white as
[1:28:47] snow as so no Fuller unearth can wipe
[1:28:51] them amen
[1:28:52] and there appeared unto him Elias with
[1:28:55] Moses and now you see why that
[1:28:59] that has to be there
[1:29:04] the law and the prophets has to be there
[1:29:09] because the law is the word
[1:29:12] and the Prophecies of manifestation of
[1:29:15] the word and they're coming to the word
[1:29:18] they're coming to the great sculptor
[1:29:20] they're coming to the Masterpiece that's
[1:29:23] why they were standing there
[1:29:26] amen praise the Lord
[1:29:29] and Peter answered and said to Jesus
[1:29:32] Master it's a good for it's good for us
[1:29:34] to be here let us make three Tabernacles
[1:29:37] one for thee and one for Moses and one
[1:29:39] for Elias for he knew not what to say
[1:29:41] for they were so afraid amen just like
[1:29:44] they were back at um Mount Sinai they're
[1:29:48] in the desert they were they were afraid
[1:29:50] in the presence of God Amen
[1:29:53] and sometimes it's just better to keep
[1:29:54] your mouth shut amen
[1:29:59] and there was a cloud that overshadowed
[1:30:01] them and a voice came out of the cloud
[1:30:03] saying this is my beloved Son
[1:30:07] here
[1:30:09] him
[1:30:13] and if you can receive it
[1:30:16] from that time forward
[1:30:20] Jehovah the old never spoke again
[1:30:31] if you go and look in it now because
[1:30:34] brother Branham used Mark 9 that's why I
[1:30:37] quoted mark 9.
[1:30:39] but if you go and you look at the
[1:30:41] settings of one of the mount
[1:30:43] transfigurations it may be maybe Matthew
[1:30:45] you'll find out when they came down they
[1:30:48] ran into the epileptic child
[1:30:50] and they and they asked Jesus they the
[1:30:53] the man said he said you know he said Do
[1:30:57] you believe and he says yes I believe
[1:30:58] Lord but help my unbelief and he said
[1:31:00] how long has this been and he told them
[1:31:02] and everything else and then so he
[1:31:04] prayed for him and then the disciples
[1:31:05] said why couldn't we do this and then if
[1:31:08] you just keep reading you keep reading
[1:31:09] Thomas comes to him and Philip
[1:31:14] Philip I think it is comes to Jesus and
[1:31:16] he says master
[1:31:18] show us
[1:31:20] the father
[1:31:25] and Jesus who the Masterpiece is now in
[1:31:30] his fullness
[1:31:34] he says when you've seen me
[1:31:40] hallelujah praise the Lord amen amen
[1:31:45] we find apparent Mount Transfiguration
[1:31:48] when they stood there with Moses the law
[1:31:50] and there stood Elijah the prophets and
[1:31:52] all the way back from the Patriarchs the
[1:31:54] fathers the laws the prophets and all of
[1:31:57] them standing there we hear a voice
[1:31:59] coming down from the cloud and said this
[1:32:01] is my beloved Son hear ye him and if
[1:32:03] they're going to hear then he's got to
[1:32:06] speak
[1:32:08] it was just a few days before he was
[1:32:11] smitten
[1:32:13] so it's a little different
[1:32:15] you think you think that the smiting at
[1:32:18] Calvary was the crucifixion but it's not
[1:32:25] that's not the smiting
[1:32:29] the smiting is the spear in his side
[1:32:39] this is my so they're going to hear he's
[1:32:41] got to speak as just a few days before
[1:32:43] he was smitten this is my son whom I'm
[1:32:46] pleased to dwell in I have molded him
[1:32:48] I've been four thousand years bringing
[1:32:51] him to this and now he is so perfect
[1:32:53] I've got to Smite him so that he can
[1:32:56] speak
[1:32:57] and hear ye him he is the perfected one
[1:33:01] he is the masterpiece
[1:33:04] praise the Lord
[1:33:06] praise God
[1:33:08] so when he went to Calvary when he all
[1:33:11] the things the tram full entry in and
[1:33:13] all the prophecies and everything else
[1:33:15] God was manifested in the flesh
[1:33:19] and he walked to Calvary as a man he
[1:33:23] went there on his own free will because
[1:33:25] the word had to be fulfilled he could
[1:33:29] not break the prophecies if he was the
[1:33:32] Fulfillment of all the prophecies
[1:33:34] and when he went to Calvary
[1:33:37] he had to he had to willingly let the
[1:33:41] spirit of God step out behind the flesh
[1:33:44] that Spirit stepped out and he said my
[1:33:47] God my God why hast Thou forsaken me
[1:33:49] because you can't kill God
[1:33:52] unless he stepped out and when he
[1:33:54] stepped down a free man
[1:34:01] said I do this for the negatives
[1:34:05] I do this for the positives that are
[1:34:08] here tonight I do this for you he was
[1:34:12] sinless he didn't have to do that
[1:34:15] so when he said it was finished it's
[1:34:18] finished for every one of us
[1:34:21] amen all we're doing is playing out our
[1:34:24] little part
[1:34:25] amen
[1:34:27] till the negative will become positive
[1:34:30] one day
[1:34:31] amen amen praise the Lord amen
[1:34:36] that's where I wanted to go the first
[1:34:38] night
[1:34:38] [Laughter]
[1:34:42] and I couldn't
[1:34:44] remember Angelo could only cry out and
[1:34:47] smite the image and say speak but how
[1:34:49] different it is with God the great
[1:34:52] sculptor when he made a man in his own
[1:34:55] image so perfect that it reflected him
[1:34:58] and none of us reflect him unless the
[1:35:00] word is born in us what was right open
[1:35:03] my eyes Lord unless the word is born in
[1:35:07] you then it's just a dead letter oh yeah
[1:35:10] the Bible says I shouldn't swear so I'm
[1:35:12] not swearing the Bible says I shouldn't
[1:35:13] drink so I'm not going to swink I'm I it
[1:35:16] says I shouldn't do this I'm not doing
[1:35:17] it I'm not I'm I'm whatever the Bible
[1:35:20] says I'm going to do it and that ain't
[1:35:21] gonna do you one bit of good
[1:35:25] because you've got to have the thought
[1:35:28] of God come down and step inside of you
[1:35:31] you have got to be born again you have
[1:35:35] to have the spirit of God to make that
[1:35:37] word live
[1:35:39] and when that word comes alive then you
[1:35:43] become God's masterpiece
[1:35:47] amen
[1:35:48] amen
[1:35:50] and believe it or not
[1:35:53] I'm not done
[1:35:54] [Laughter]
[1:35:57] but I am done for tonight
[1:36:01] praise the Lord
[1:36:02] so remember
[1:36:04] God had a thought
[1:36:07] it became word then it became flesh
[1:36:11] God all the Patriarchs he had a he had a
[1:36:15] diamond he had a hidden Mystery and he
[1:36:18] chipped it all off and he never threw
[1:36:20] any of them away and everyone that all
[1:36:23] the prophets who lived the word who
[1:36:26] stood up and stood before I mean look
[1:36:30] none of us we we're coward I know I'm a
[1:36:33] coward
[1:36:35] don't ask me to get in a fiery furnace
[1:36:37] it's seven times hotter
[1:36:40] a guy getting near heat and I get you
[1:36:43] know
[1:36:44] John was telling me about bonfires at
[1:36:46] his house we could go over and have a
[1:36:48] contest so you can get close enough to
[1:36:49] the bonfire ain't gonna be me
[1:36:52] don't you see it was The Word Alive
[1:36:55] inside of them
[1:36:57] they were constrained it wasn't even
[1:37:00] their choice
[1:37:02] they didn't even when when his when they
[1:37:05] said when they said we're careful O King
[1:37:08] we don't even care what you think or
[1:37:10] anything else we're not gonna bow to
[1:37:12] your image what was that that was God's
[1:37:15] thoughts coming down and speaking
[1:37:17] through them and then the manifestation
[1:37:19] came when they walked right up to that
[1:37:20] fire
[1:37:22] amen
[1:37:23] amen God's masterpiece
[1:37:27] praise the Lord
[1:37:29] praise the Lord amen let's fire our
[1:37:32] heads amen
[1:37:34] dear Lord Jesus
[1:37:36] Heavenly Father we thank you for your
[1:37:39] love and your mercy we thank you Lord
[1:37:41] for what you've done for us
[1:37:43] father
[1:37:44] we know we're living in a negative world
[1:37:46] this is a negative
[1:37:48] father we just know that if we're here
[1:37:51] then there's a positive somewhere
[1:37:55] and where we've heard from our theophany
[1:37:58] we've heard from our positive
[1:38:00] and we're staying
[1:38:02] we're staying until that positive this
[1:38:04] negative becomes into that image Lord
[1:38:07] that's the desire of our hearts I pray
[1:38:10] father you'll take the simple message
[1:38:12] Lord you take the word that we've heard
[1:38:15] tonight
[1:38:16] let us think on these things and Lord
[1:38:19] Jesus may it transform us into
[1:38:22] masterpieces that you'll be proud of
[1:38:24] that you'll say this is my son this is
[1:38:27] my daughter I'm pleased to dwell in them
[1:38:30] I'm pleased to walk with them I'm
[1:38:33] pleased that they let me use their body
[1:38:35] that I can fulfill my promises in this
[1:38:38] age
[1:38:39] we love you and we thank you Father for
[1:38:41] all these things
[1:38:42] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
[1:38:46] amen praise the Lord
[1:38:48] amen
[1:38:50] Brother John
[1:38:54] praise the Lord
[1:39:00] [Applause]
[1:39:13] it's
[1:39:15] the unveiling of God to us that's right
[1:39:19] the one thing that we all have in common
[1:39:22] is God has revealed himself to us
[1:39:27] and we can only
[1:39:31] we have got to manifest the word
[1:39:35] he said Upon This Rock I'll build my
[1:39:37] church
[1:39:38] and when the word is coming forth across
[1:39:42] the pulpit
[1:39:47] when we can receive that word by faith
[1:39:50] then it becomes manifested in their life
[1:39:54] and without that
[1:39:56] we're still
[1:39:58] needing
[1:40:00] to hear from God
[1:40:02] and that's how we know we know when we
[1:40:04] hear from God there's just something
[1:40:05] inside that just says amen that's that's
[1:40:09] for me
[1:40:10] and
[1:40:12] don't be discouraged if it doesn't get
[1:40:14] manifested in in one day or two days or
[1:40:17] one week or three weeks or five months
[1:40:19] or five years
[1:40:23] when God said let there be light we
[1:40:26] don't know how long it took before that
[1:40:28] light appeared
[1:40:30] so whatever God has spoken to us we're
[1:40:32] just going to hang on to it until we
[1:40:35] become in His image
[1:40:37] amen let's stand together we really
[1:40:39] appreciated
[1:40:41] these
[1:40:43] these Jewels these jewels that have been
[1:40:47] handed out in this great message called
[1:40:49] the Masterpiece I want to encourage you
[1:40:51] to to listen to that message
[1:40:55] and and and no matter what message we
[1:40:58] listen to when you listen to it again
[1:40:59] you're gonna get some more nuggets out
[1:41:01] of it
[1:41:02] and uh I believe that's why God sent
[1:41:06] profit for us is to to receive these
[1:41:09] things so
[1:41:12] um
[1:41:14] do we know it's all in him
[1:41:16] it's all in him nope okay let's sing
