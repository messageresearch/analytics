may apply our hearts on to wisdom Lord teach us to number our days oh oh teach [Music] us teach us to our days that we may our heart to wisdom Lord teach us to number our days [Music] amen I like that message in that song that I have a part to play that I might grow in wisdom I mean the scripture says he that lacks wisdom just ask of God he gives liberally right amen but to to realize it we only got so much time on earth right and to not to be caught up in the Whirlwind of just letting the world go by amen that we we actually can pray and Lord teach us to number our days that we might apply our heart to their situations that we're living in Praise the Lord now we got sound amen well I'll say it's good to be in the house of the Lord I'm not quite sure if I've seen these seats as they are today it's like we want to like get everybody go like this in the middle but no this is fine let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer and then we'll get straight into the word our heavenly father we thank you God we count it a privilege to have a desire and a heart to serve you today Lord and we we're we're thankful Lord that that desire that's there in our heart you've kept it there you you've kept it there you you've not allowed the things of the world to to squish it out or to to put under a a a some doormat but Lord I it's been your grace Lord that today we were standing looking for the coming of the Lord looking for that hour Lord that we're going to be called away and we just thank you today that we could gather together it's such a precious precious precious time and Lord we we pray that your presence would be felt amongst each of us today Lord there wouldn't be one that would go home and just not know of assurity that you were there for them that you they felt your presence and Lord they they not only heard you speak to them but Lord uh you you were able to to correspond with them and communicate with them and they could talk back and Lord that each one of our relationships could be just lifted up just a little bit closer to to you from this service I pray that you'd encourage every heart and Lord that you would bless us as we commit ourself in this service into your hands now for we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen turn with me if you would to Mark chapter n for just one verse Mark chapter N I wonder if there'd be anyone here today that could could say that I have something that I would like God to do just a amen just it's such a simple request but I think we have the word for that today Mark chapter 9 starting with verse number 23 Mark 9 verse 23 Jesus speaking here says if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth amen amen if if thou can't believe all things are possible to him that believeth you may be seated God bless the reading of his word and we're we want to we want to look at building faith but maybe in a in a little bit different way than we have before and um I I hope that you can you can go with me but this word this scripture that Jesus uses here if thou can't believe uh he uses the word if and if is a conjunction used to introduce a conditional Clause it shows a condition uh therefore if we if we do not believe then all things are not possible to us so that that one little twetter word is extremely important and Jesus actually uses this a lot in his ministry this word he says you are my friends if if you do whatsoever I command you if you love me keep my Commandments and and and and we know that you know there people claim their view their their Vision um that they they they love God they're they're a friend of God but God's word really has the final say so about these things he says if you keep my command you shall abide in my love even as I kept my father's Commandments and abide in his love if you keep my Commandments then you're going to abide in my love if not you're going to grieve the grieve my spirit and I'm going to step back I mean the and these are just facts one time Jesus said if if you he he's speaking to some Believers that believed on him he says if you continue in my word if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed and many people would want to claim that they're a disciple of Christ without that condition and they're just gonna no matter what I do I'm still a disciple of Jesus Christ I was 15 years ago and I am today but they're not continuing in the word and so the the word is the final absolute but we're just showing how important this word if is right now amen by this shall all men know you're my disciples if you have Lov one for another amen and maybe we're going to get into that a little bit Sunday but but the the word if it shows a condition I I just can't say that everybody should know I'm a disciple because I'm a preacher like who cares i' I've got to be able to demonstrate love everyone the same not respect a persons not on my favorite day just love just like Jesus loved did you know that we won't remain saved if we don't keep in our memory or the memory of our heart the things that God has taught us and that's we can find that in 1 Corinthians 15:1 uh if we want to put that up there 1 Corinthians 15:1 moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also you received it and wherein you stand today by which you are saved if is that word again if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless it all been in vain unless you're original believing in it at the beginning turns vain because no it it doesn't matter how we start out it only matters that we're continuing in that we finish the way that we said that we're going to amen amen so we can fall from grace we can fall from our old steadfastness we can fall from salvation right our names can be taken out of the book of life we are capable of going backwards and I'm just just speaking here with the scriptures we're not going to be talking about predestination and the thing is we must walk with certainty and keep walking in that direction we can't just let back off and expect everything to continue to be okay that's why Peter said in second Peter 1 wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and your election assure for if you do these things what things if you keep adding Christ to your life the virtues if you keep adding if you do these things you shall never fall but the moment you just like you know what I'm just going to back up I'm going to take a backseat I'm just going to sit back here and just kind of take it easy you're going to fall and not even know it because your whole mindset has to be I'm going forward into the image of Jesus Christ and and I'm not stopping till I'm there so ye are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless you believed in vain right 1 Thessalonians 3:8 for now we live if we stand fast in the Lord Colossians 1:20 and we're just kind of laying a kind of a lengthy Foundation here and having made peace we've all made peace through the blood of of his cross by him to reconcile all things unto himself by him I say whether they be things in the Earth or things in heaven so he has reconciled us and everything back to him through the cross and you that were sometimes sometime alienated and and and enemies even in your own mind by Wicked Works yet now he's reconciled you he is he's reconciled in the body of his flesh through death to present you holy unblamable unreprovable in his sight we could say Amen to that couldn't we but there's not a period there there's a colon and the very next word says if if you continue in the faith grounded settled and be not moved away from the hope of the Gospel which you have heard and and and which was preached to every creature that is under heaven where of I Paul and made a minister amen you know we when we were growing up in this message and we we learned that you know tongues was not the evidence that you have the Holy Ghost right we were taught that we learned that and so many people wanted that to be true and still believe it today because if I just speak in tongues I know I have it and I don't have to worry about getting it ever again just like putting my name on the book just like getting baptized a certain way if I if I if I can identify something out here naturally that tells you I've got the Holy Ghost then I don't have to worry about living the life and I don't have to worry about what I do from here on out but you know the prophet came and he taught us that the holy ghost lines up with the word and gifts or callings are without it and so the focus is uh Christ manifest the word and if we had the spirit of Christ brother say will manifest Christ just like if we had the spirit of bolaven B bolaven Beethoven then we would we would play music like bethoven right okay so we we understand that we we've just got to follow through and continue in the faith that word if all right Colossians 3:1 if you then be risen with Christ then then seek those things which are above where Christ sth on the right hand of God set your affections on things above and not on things of the Earth for you dead and your life is hid with God so there's these are some conditions faith is a contingency with god without faith we can't even please God one time Jesus said in Matthew 17 if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hence To Yonder place and it shall be removed and nothing shall be impossible unto you amen if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed we know a grain of mustard seed is the smallest of all the seeds herb seeds but yet it grows into such a big place that birds have their nest and they they Lodge there so you don't need much you just need you just need need it to be real it just needs to be real one time Jesus said to Martha if thou wouldest believe thou should us see the glory of God again a condition you've got to you've got to believe Jesus said in Luke 17 take heed to yourself If thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him if he repents forgive him if he trespassed against the seven times in one day seven times one day turn again say I Repent thou shallal forgive him that's a lot of forgiv you might say that was a bad day and and most likely we've none of us have ever experienced one person doing something to us the same thing seven times in one day they might have did different things right talk this way treated you bad did this but it's a bad day right so the apostles said unto unto the Lord increase our faith the only way to deal with forgiving somebody seven times in in one day is you got to give me more faith amen and the Lord said if you had Faith as a grain of mustard seed you might say not to this mountain but to the sicamore tree be thou plucked up by the root and be thou planted in the sea and it should obey you this little little thing called Faith Can Do wonders if ye had Faith as a tiny grain of mustard seed amen one time Jesus said if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen there's some conditional contingency here Jesus said if thou can't believe all things are possible Right amen now did you know faith is a real substance and it comes from God and it comes from God Alone Romans 10:17 so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Amen and that God use faith in his word to create the entire universe Hebrews 11:3 tells us through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that the things which are seen are not made which uh made of the things which do appear so God used his word but it was faith in his word amen that when he would spoke it it would happen amen God is still operating by faith amen he not only created everything that we see through faith he has created new bodies Paul said they're waiting for us he is presently in the midst of creating Born Again creatures right before our eyes right in our life it is the word of God coming to life amen he is in the midst of creating brand new natures and how is he doing it by his own faith he tells us we believe it and then our faith becomes his faith and we live by the faith of the son of man just like Paul did in fact without faith God will not do anything amen he's building his church by faith amen he's restoring her by faith he's going to have a bride by faith he's going to have a a people that make a Rapture by faith she's going to be without spot or wrinkle no wonder the Bible tells us that we should earnest ly contend for the faith that was once delivered to the saints that we should build up ourselves in the Most Holy Faith that we should fight the good fight of Faith lay hold of eternal life as important as faith is there's a great apostasy right now as we know just even people in our own church are drifting away from the [Music] Faith Can Say Amen to that 2 Thessalonians 3 tells us that all men have not faith and I'll say it like this they must have set Faith aside they must have set the faith that they had aside when God spoke to their heart because when God speaks because he gives Every Man a chance does he not Romans 12:3 we might have touched on this last service God has doubt to every man a Measure of Faith so if every man gets a A measure then some men don't have it they must have laid that Faith aside somewhere they must have just kind of sat back and just let the weeds take over so it's what we do with the faith that that that counts we're all going to get a chance to hear from God but what are we going to do with it will we exercise what God spoke to us or we we just kind of let it dormant because like any muscle it if it's not exercised it won't grow our brain they tell you to do crossworld puzzles they they tell you to do certain things so you don't get Dimension you don't what I'm talking about it's the exercising curs it is the ground for thy sake because by working the ground you're because your body's done you're actually going to stay healthier by staying active so faith has to stay active faith is like a muscle can be the smallest seed but it has to be exercised and and Jesus typed it with that a a a grain of mustard seed becoming so great that it actually is benefited by the the other animals that he created faith is not going to grow on its own there has to come some sort of resistance right anybody's that's ever had any problems with knees you go to therapy or ankles or arms they give you resistant bands and you you tie them against something and you you you you you just force yourself to move with resistance and what that does is it it may hurt slightly for a little bit but it builds your muscles makes it stronger so now you you can get done with therapy how many's ever been done with therapy and you just feel so much better I mean I have many many times I've been to therapy because I always push myself to the Limit right Jesus speaking of our die of our day he says when the son of man cometh shall he even find faith on the earth so we know that it could be a real struggle sometimes to find faith in our lives and I'm I'm sure you could say Amen to that we've all all battle just looking for Faith and situations I want to encourage you with the the rest of this message if you haven't been encouraged so far since faith comes from God it can be often hard waiting around for God to give us faith and if we haven't been used to exercising it we can feel weak but I believe that there's a way that we can activate God more in our lives without waiting for him to speak to us in a direct way I was just sharing with the the brothers in the in the men's meeting there was no no doubt uh when God spoke to me about having trusted tool it was just one word dropped there never battled it I don't care what anybody ever said to me I they they're going to eat you up alive I heard a number of things but to me I was just was just never moved it didn't bother me I didn't debate it I didn't do nothing now when the Lord spoke to to to to Cheryl and said we're going to we'll we'll have that money we'll sell our house within seven days well I'm telling you I didn't have that that was not a revelation to me that was not Faith to me she had it but I didn't of course I had of trusted too but she didn't so you understand when God speaks it's real easy to have faith but there's so many things in the word and so many things that we want for our lives that we're we and God is not just going to speak them all to us like we want but yet he wants us to have them and and if we apply what we're going to talk about here I believe that we will bring we will see God manifest more of his word in our life it it it is that simple brother not brother yeah it was brother brother Charles sendell we haven't met him but uh he's our brother I've read this quote it's been a while probably since I've read it but he said attitude is more important than facts is more important than the past than education than money and circumstances then failures and success then what other people think or what they say do it's it's more important than appearance ability or skill it will make a break a business a home a friendship an organization the remarkable thing is I have a choice every day of what my attitude will be I cannot change my past I cannot change the action of others I I cannot even change the inevitable but the only thing I can change is my attitude life is 10% of what happens to me and 90% of how I react so we're going to talk about okay God did not speak all the things that we wanted to speak to us when we come to church and I don't feel like I'm getting what I want to get out of it but I have a a a a choice to make of how I'm going to respond to that and and brother brother Charlie said it it's it's 90% that it's 90% so I just I I brother brandom spoke about the right mental attitude and I want to read some Cults with this because it's filtered throughout his ministry it starts in the 50s 1950 and right through 63 um he talks about the importance of a right attitude and I want to kind of dig into this a little bit not just having a raid man altitude but what it means to have that and and how do we how do we get that so would just start off here brother BR says believest Thou this he says and I say this with a challenge in faith he's challenging in faith that every promise of God will be brought to pass if you take the right mental attitude towards it so what kind of attitude do I have at whatever I want what am I wanting what kind of attitude do I have towards it because if you think about there's so many things that we've wanted in our life that we just we we almost lose hope that we'll ever get it you know what I'm talking about and then you you you you develop this sense well you know I guess it's not for me I'm not going to have it now the thing is how can we know what God's will is for us unless he tells us now if he told us then it would be okay but if he hasn't told us why we accepted that so brother BR said in the message expectation he says we always get what we expect when people expect anything well then they usually get what they look for it's the mental attitude that you have so now he's bringing it home we all come into church with an attitude don't we we we do we do and it's it's a mental attitude it's not we're spiritual you know we're I got these 10 visions that happened to me when I come in church this is going to happen it's not that we walk in with a mental attitude he said remember this and never forget it the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass he's didn't say faith he says the right mental attitude towards any promise of God now I I was trying to share with the the brothers in in in in the men's meeting that if faith comes from God I have like no choice in it I I he's he's got to speak to me for it to be Faith it's got to come from his mouth it wasn't brother Bron that spoke the squirrels in existence it was God's word through brother brandham when God told him to do it brother brandham did it and it happened but brother BR says that that wasn't me that wasn't my choice to do that if it was he'd probably be doing it many more times and we'd read about it since then but this I want to say I believe this quote these quotes and there's like probably 60 or more of them in the throughout the message where he uses the right mental attitude that I have it that I have tangency to it's like trust in the Lord and he'll bring it to pass trust I can trust but I can't make God reveal anything to me but I believe that if I keep trusting if I keep um committing myself to him if if I just keep keep having the right manal attitude towards what his word is already said then God will bring the faith amen and it is I'm just saying if we apply this more he said it doesn't take Gifts of healing to heal sick people any person in ear has a right to meet Satan anywhere if you're a Christian and defeat him on any grounds that he could stand on wow that means God is not going to speak to everybody give him this this gift of healing to go pray for somebody and see them healed all you need is a right mental attitude because the word says do this and you can expect it to happen additions here is the first and only foundation for Divine Healing or anything from God is is the Bible he's just saying you use the Bible use God's word if you get off of that then you're out of God's will that's right and Divine Healing isn't a Hocus Pocus Affair it isn't saying a few mysterious words and somebody is hypnotized amen it's the truth revealed through Jesus Christ is Divine Healing he said that's right gifts of the Spirit are brought down to edif or other words it's the flag flying over the top of the building it's the appearance of the outside to attract the people in out of the rain see what I mean now gifts come from God if they are from God they'll testify of God and God will testify of them is that true yes says if you are sick pray until you believe with all your heart if you're sick he didn't say wait till you believe right he just said pray until you believe in other words you can trust that when you're praying faith is going to come and healing is going to come amen he said did you ever pray for something you just known was going to get it he said that's Faith now if you believe that with all your heart accept it and act on it now you can believe it just as much as you want to if you didn't act on it you'll just sit right there like a sinner would lay at the altar wow something about acting on the word not just saying I'm I believe I'm a Believer yeah amen I believe no act on it act on it God wants to see action you know God is not some some picture he's not some picture on a wall he's a God that lives in our heart he wants a live relationship he wants us to act upon him not just come to church twice a week are you with me God is looking for us to act and there's promises and we need to act on them amen he said if you got down there and prayed and prayed and you said Lord I know you saved me but that's just I I know he'll he'll never go through until he raises and confesses and says it with it and shows works with it yes so you just can't sit there and say well I I I repented I I got baptized and and that that's it that's it that's all I need to do no you got to continue on with What God Says to do next amen we did we did the first thing but we got to continue on you just you just can't sit there you got to rise confess and stay with it it shows the works with it James says just as a body is dead without the spirit so is faith without works no matter how much you believe so I imagine you know God said um oh yeah you're going to have a you're G to have a company right there this is where you're going to have your business and I said okay yeah that's great God see you later if I don't go act upon it if I don't go hey is this land for sale well you it's it's amazing how God just you know brought it all to pass but he didn't do it without me doing something without me acting by faith on it and and and if you want you want joy you want love you want peace you want you want wisdom you you want to grow in Christ you want to be more like you want to love like him you've got to act upon what you want you got to have that Vision this is is what I want this is and you you you you pray and you seek and you trust and it will happen faith will come faith will come you can't expect God to just always tell you everything where's the relationship that's robots he wants he wants to see us hunger and thirst after righteousness he wants us to to get down on our knees and wait upon the Lord that we might re receive our strength so we have a part to play in whatever we're looking for and and brother br's talking about every Divine promise of God will come to pass in the message the hour is come he says no that this holy spirit is here and he's just willing and he can work through the people as the people will let him work right do you do you believe that he said now there's where many uh there was many things that Jesus himself could not do because of unbelief is that right many things he could not do and we hate to think of that but he could not do it because of their unbelief now the right mental attitude all you along here do you understand what I mean when I say the right mental attitude your right mental attitude towards God's Divine promise will bring any promise to pass amen now he's not saying here he's not saying what you just just just believe it you you got to have faith to make God's promise come to pass which is a true statement by the way but but it almost seems untangle like we're waiting on God but brother Brandon says no there's an Avenue you don't have to wait on God you put your best foot for forward and up here in your mind have the right mental attitude up here in other words don't be wishy-washy that ain't the right mental attitude doubl minded man is unstable in all his ways this is this is the way walking in it now maybe you don't believe that you say well my faith is weak he said I wouldn't confess that see don't let the devil know that always say I've got good faith if you got any faith that comes from God of course the devil's going to make you feel like you don't got faith Devil's going to make you feel like you're not saved the devil's going to make you feel like you're not happy the devil's going to make you feel miserable that's his job am but there's something about fighting the good fight of Faith amen so always say I've got faith I believe God with all my heart see don't testify nothing of the devil amen and when you accept him as your healer don't ever act like you're sick or crippled anymore now that that this is a real hard one this is a real hard one because look if if you're if you're you're hurt you're crippled and you're walking and you're sick and you're things are going on in your lungs things are going on in your body you you can't help that is a real thing but your attitude towards it can be the right mental attitude that's what the prophet's telling us believe that you're healed take him at his word then it's all over on God God then and not on you wow we're waiting on God to give us faith and God's waiting on us to trust him right I can't make Faith come but I know I can trust him and my trust may be weak right now but it will grow to I can have a perfect trust in him amen as long as you take God at his word then the word will produce what it promised to produce is that right now have faith believe with all your heart and I love how he brings this the right mental attitude just produces it's really what it is it's how can you have how can you have faith that trusted tool is going to come and not have a right mental attitude towards it you understand when you have faith you have a right mental attitude but when you don't have faith you can still have a right mental attitude because that's all choice in the message God revealing himself to his people he says now many times this may seem strange everybody be real reverent if you can get the person just what I'm trying to do with due to the woman was get her in the right mental attitude and haven't quite heard it like that he he because he would say it like this in times he would say I'm just trying to get her faith raised right standing in the prayer line and he's trying to get her faith to raise and then all a sudden the spirit would go out in the audience and something would happen and it was the the whole thing was trying to get her faith to a place to receive what brother Bon was going to say and now he's saying in this place he's not using Faith he says I was trying to what I was trying to do with the woman was to get her in the right mental attitude right he says she wouldn't have to be prayed for with the right mental attitude amen that's why brother Brian was against somebody coming to the Altar and getting prayed over and over and over and over because you don't have the right mental attitude the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass the word is a seed and that s sowed in the ground and every seed will bring forth of its time if you need salvation the seed is here if you need he heing here's the seed in the word the word of God is the seed put it in your heart don't dig it up every morning to see if it's sprouted put it in there leave it in there it's God's business to bring it bring the Harvest you just leave it there water it by faith and praise every day thanking God for it every day I think I can do that I think I could take God's word and just say yes it's for me I'll hold to it and I'm not going to sit there and you know try to prove to somebody that I got faith I'm I'm just fa faith is Paul said have faith to yourself right didn't he say that I love this word in the message expectations he says I claim tonight this and God will confirm my claims that's right I claim that there's no disease too deep embedded there's no crippled too badly crippled there's no eyes too badly blind I have seen those were born literally blind and can and can even read now there's no disease too great but what our Lord hasn't already healed the right mental attitude towards God's Divine promise will heal every person in this building tonight I think there's something for us to tap into here I really do God is looking at us to get what we can get right in our facility right because he knows we can't manufacture Faith here right we can't put that there but we can get this thing right amen amen I say that not not being ashamed of my testimony and knowing this that in the presence of all almighty God I'll have to stand and give an account for everything that I've said every word that I spake will be brought before me in the judgment and I say this and I'm not afraid to make this statement allmighty God knows I want you to believe me I'll tell you this this one you know you could see certain things in his brother B's Ministry just kind of like unfolding and and growing and building because more Revelation was being added this one thing about a right manal atud it didn't change from the beginning to the end and that's what I love about this we don't wouldn't have time to read all the quotes the right mental attitude brother Braham said in the principles of Divine Healing towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you're a sinner confess your sins believe that God saved you and then go testify it tell people that you're saved it'll work righteousness right you think about that when we all got saved we couldn't go to anybody and prove it right but our lives just started changing and then before you know it people saw it he uses this example the right man attitude about just being saved just confess It Go testify believe that God saved you okay then believe the other promises you want more love believe it you want more joy believe it you want more peace believe it you believe it and then you begin to act on it there's if there's anything that's you know brother Braham said the sickest body that there is is the body of Christ and if she just acted on what God has already provided to bring healing he's waiting on us when we're sitting around waiting on him what a trick of the devil and I've seen sarus cancer healed by the right mental attitude towards God's Divine word that that's a testimony in itself right there all right seeking after Jesus now listen to this closely any Divine promise of God the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God will bring it to pass if you can look at it right believe it in the way that it's written God it's your word and take the right mental attitude towards the Divine promise it'll bring it to pass because there's no defeat faith cannot be defeated there's no defeat in Faith H now in this he's interwoven the right mental attitude and Faith but to be honest with you when you know you have absolute Faith you heard from God brother B says you don't even have to get prayed for you just know it's going to happen but unless you have that you need to build whatever you do have so say it's a little mustard grain seed or say you just have the right man to take it any way you want to but you've got to act upon it take it in your heart let's look at the syap phenician woman who wanted healing for her daughter with had an unclean Spirit she literally came the Bible says she came to Jesus worshiping now this would have been pretty much a slam dunk here's somebody that really believed right if how many people have worshiped you today right I mean nobody worships so when this person came to Jesus it was real and it seemed like Jesus wasn't even interested in her need he said for it's not meat to take the children's bread and to cast it unto the dogs yes wow Jesus was walking in this certain direction you know it ain't nothing to do with you I just I'm sorry I don't even look at you is worthy of being he of of your request for your daughter to be be heal but you know she wasn't deterred look at her attitude yes Lord yet the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs she never got offended by the word when she came to church she didn't start accusing the man of God for being rude she never felt disrespected by Jesus she had what the prophet taught was the right mental attitude and Jesus said these words he said for this saying go thy way the devil has gone out of thy daughter for this saying for just saying the right mental attitude I I just believe this word is amazing amen the right mental attitude brings about a faith that God honors your attitude he he does look Satan left Heaven because his attitude became what I want to be like God I want to do this I want my will I want to be like the most high his attitude um it it it changed to self-centeredness and so God looks at an attitude greatly and I think a lot of people people miss out on a close relationship with God because they don't care about their attitude I don't want to get into that today but I want to show us that we can have more from God if we just have the right mental attitude I I I'll say it like this I want to entitle this message cash in with the right mental attitude this woman cashed in got what she needed by just having the right mental attitude the same thing with the Centurion beseeching Jesus for one of his servants who was grievously tormented the Bible said and Jesus said all right I'm going to go in your direction you know I I'm going to come and I'm going to heal and the Centurion answered and said Lord I am not worthy that you should come in this direction that you should come under my roof but speak the word only and my servant shall be healed he just had the right attitude he says for I'm a man of their Authority having soldiers under me and I say to this man go and goeth and and to another come and he cometh and to my servant do this and he doeth it and when Jesus heard it he marveled and said unto them that follow verely I say unto you I have not found so great faith no not in Israel and the Centurion didn't have some some uh he didn't have a vision of what was going to happen let me just say it like this Jesus was going this way hey let's go to your home home and all of a sudden no so it wasn't like even Jesus had the vision to go to the home he just spoke the word and he said whoa no I'm not worthy that you'd come and that that that humbleness attracted God and then he he gave a reason look your word is all that I need so it's the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise it's the word we don't need to prove it it's already been proven by God we believe God so we're just taking the right mental attitude towards it and we're we're just going to March forward with all that we have and keep trusting what about the man that brother Brandon prayed for he was blind right he came through the line he was blind and he came through the line brother br you're healed as thus sayith the Lord and he walked off the platform and he was praising God but he was still blind and he sat there a while and the devil got talking to him he says well maybe you didn't get enough and so he came right back on the platform and just you know just need you to pray for me again I just you know I I still can't see you know obviously you know something's wrong brother BR says well wait wait a minute God said you're healed brother bam told him says you just leave and you keep testifying of your healing he had to take this attitude that wasn't quite right and brother Brandon just pointed him to a right mental attitude just go and confess it he didn't have a revelation you understand he didn't have that Faith he just heard the word said you are healed and he he left and he kept testifying it testifying of it and before long God said okay I'm G to I'm going to give him his heart's desire I'm going to bring this Divine promise to pass because he had a right mental attitude we know the story in the barber chair right I just I just see the power in in having the right mental attitude Our Lives can change look at non he had an attitude but it wasn't the right attitude was it the the word just told him go wash in Jordan and he just thought he was he was better than that he didn't need to do what the church was telling him to do and he just got this little old attitude in his home just going to fight and fuss and he had somebody there that loved him spent a few minutes with him to try to tell him look just follow what the word says and you know what he did he changed his attitude it became a right manal attitude why because it was based on the word the word said go washing Jordan and if you just have your mind on the right on the word it'll come to pass and so he got his mind off of those clean Waters and he put his mind right where God told him to put it and he did what he he was supposed to do and after this I don't know if it was the seventh time he came up and he was clean amen oh because of the right manal attitude he already had the word the word was given to him but if we question the word I can't get healed I can't get better I can't get healthier I I I can't get more joy I can't get more of Christ if you keep that at itude it cannot come to pass so you got to make a stand I'm against that I'm going to agree with the word brother bam said in the message taking God at his word he says but I believe every word of it to be true and every Divine promise is a seed that will produce just exactly what it said it will do if that word again remember why we spent so much time at the beginning if you'll take the right mental attitude remember this the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise will bring it to pass try it don't say try it just go do it if you got enough behind you to push you and say I can do it by the grace of God I will do it then God is with you think about that if you got enough in you to say I I I'm G to move forward in this I'm going to trust God as God's word I'm moving forward he said God is with you god what because God's with his word don't wait till you have faith let that sound strong don't wait till you have faith but just start acting upon the word with the right mental attitude faith will come he says he said then God's with you but if you're just a wishy-washy well I'll go up and I'll see if they can do anything for me he says no that won't work you can say Amen because I want to go on to the next thing okay okay now Jonah Jonah made up his mind that he wasn't going to be led by God or do God's will I'll say anybody who has the idea that you're just going to do what you want to do you got the wrong mental attitude you know what God just said okay go that's what you want to do go he didn't stop him he let him do his own thing we know the scriptures that the way of a transgressor is hard and things got real hard for Jonah in the midst of his bleakest Darkest Hours Jonah still had power to change his attitude and I love this doesn't matter how bad it is Charles Sendo says that's the one thing you got the right you have a a choice in your attitude and what did he do he took on the right mental attitude he just changed the way that he viewed God's word for his life and you know what it did it brought the Divine promise of God to pass which he needed obviously being in the the well the the well the the belly of the well or the you you know what the great fish that was prepared for him Jonah 2 verse4 thou thou I cast uh I am cast out of thy sight yet I will look again toward thy Holy Temple amen so he knew he was cast out but he took you know he was the one that left right and if we leave God then we're separating right the word you abide in the word the word abides in you then say what you will come to pass so he looked again towards the temple saying okay I'm I'm turning around I I didn't want to go towards the temple I didn't want to do God's will but now in this terrible situation I'm I'm going to I'm going to go to church and when my soul fainted within me I remember remembered the Lord verse 7 and my prayer came in unto thee into thy Holy Temple they that observe Lyon vanities forsake their own mercies but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation of the Lord salvation is of the Lord and the Lord spake unto the fish and it vomited out Jonah upon dry land wow so Jonah was in there did he get sound like like Revelation did he have faith be when he was on the ship I want you to see that there was a reality that God lets us play out our life the way we want to and God the Bible says God is able to make all grace abound to you and it wasn't until Jonah got the right mental attitude and start doing the right thing that God spoke to the fish and God wants to speak to our fish fish yes God wants to speak to our fishy situation Jonah cashed in with the right mental attitude last quote show us the father 63 brother B says and now I realize that this is being taped these tapes we have a tape Ministry all over the world and many people just here tonight where about a thousand people are listening before the tape stops there'll be 10,000 time 10 there'll be 10 times 10,000 hear it and see around the world so now he's making this statement of how many people are going to hear what he's going to say right here and I go on record I say this about the word of God being a seed if you can take the right mental attitude towards any Divine promise of God it will bring it to pass if you can get yourself in position to believe that the promise was to you boy if this this one this one the way he explains it he says if you can get yourself in a position where the position is in a position to believe in other words you don't believe it yet you just have the right man attitude you don't believe it yet but get in a position to believe it that the promise was to you let's stand together I want to read the the three verses there's three words and three verses that will help us get in position to believe for any Divine promise of God and it's in it's in Psalms 37 and as I was walking back to the men's meeting this scripture came to me and this is what we we opened up with we really didn't even read all three verses that's we we just got so involved in our in our uh but if we can put that up on the board Psalms 37: 34 and five says trust here's the three words in each verse it's the first word trust delight and commit trust in the Lord Delight thyself also in the Lord and commit thy way unto the Lord now you can do that you can trust you can delight yourself I I'm going to remind you today Lord that I'm taking a stand here I'm going to praise you that eventually this is things this is going to come to pass in my life and the third is just commit it commit it to God don't don't sit there and and and and and and keep battling back and forth with the devil take a stand faith will come faith will come commit thy way unto the Lord trust also in him and he shall bring it to pass wow the right mental attitude how many desires to exercise more of a right mental attitude amen let's let's look to him in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we need you we need thee as the song goes every hour Lord Satan is always buffing us always hammering us over the head always trying to to to to get us to even question sometimes our Salvation where we're standing our relationship with you people are Fallen Away by the by the numbers but Lord your word is just as true today as the first time we've ever heard it your word has not dis diminished your power hasn't diminished but Lord we found a little a little rope as it were that that Rahab let down something that we can hold on to today that we can exercise we can leave here and exercise our right manal attitude and know that faith will come and that you honor Faith Lord but we know according to this message today and throughout the message message Lord that you sent through your Prophet that you do honor a right mental attitude to the point that it will bring any of your Divine promises to pass amen so God we're holding on to that today and as we lord are coming to you in prayer now you see our hearts and our hands are mid lifted just Desiring to exercise more of that right mental attitude I pray that you would give us the grace to do that remind us Lord over and over amen may we share with one another what this word that we heard to remember what we heard what the prophet said amen that Lord we could just start putting it into action for Lord there's so many things in our life that we love to see come to pass and we know that Lord shall we say the greatest you said that that we're going to be just like you when you appear Lord and he that has this hope in him purifies himself Lord we want to be like you we want to be in your image we want to be in your lightness we want to have the same love and the same spirit and Lord to be just like you so I pray heavenly father that you would just bless us with the right mental attitude help us to start exercising that Lord whether it be in our homes or at work or in our in our with our families our texting Lord our friends our neighbors even our enemies Lord even Lord when we look at certain things in our life that we're not happy with help us just to exercise the right mental attitude about it not get down on ourselves and not just allow an open door for the devil to get in and and start having a service with us in our minds but Lord help us just to cast out all reasoning cast it down and just start confessing the things of God yes because we are your children Lord father I commit these these your children into your hands Lord your bride into your hands Lord they have this confidence in your word may you bless them give them the desires of their heart father we thank you for all this now for we humbly pray in Jesus wonderful name amen amen amen thank you Lord Jesus thank you Lord thank you for your your promise Lord heyen I feel it's almost like brother Brandon broke it down to us that we could see just the right mental attitude is our vehicle to get where we want to get to amen amen amen anybody got a song I didn't have any song I justy and I had been praying and I talked to her on the and she said the her husband prayed and believe God to keep the waters away from their house the water came up to the yard but would not come to the house amen they were alive they're 87 years old and alive and they prayed the same for their family members and every one of their family members made through beautiful beautiful testimony I remember brother random saying he says Prayer Changes Things you know I'd
