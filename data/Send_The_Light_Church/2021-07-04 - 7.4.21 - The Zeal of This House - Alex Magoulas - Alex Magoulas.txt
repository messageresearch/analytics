that i believe his name is john newman john newton is that right john newton i believe he was a slave trader for years in his life and then one day the lord got a hold of his life so when he he wrote that was some feeling behind it amen and to think that as bad as the transatlantic slave trade was as bad as slavery's been throughout the course of history there's more slavery today than there's ever been i mean and i'm not even talking about the natural i mean human trafficking is horrible but people are slaves to satan today but thank god we can sing that we're free we can sing about his amazing grace we've been many dangers many trials but he's brought us safe thus far amen god bless you amen praise the lord it's certainly our privilege to be with you here again this morning i was preaching last week about we will serve the lord and so um i didn't know what thought i was going to go with today but i just kind of wanted just praying about it and things last night and this is the way i felt led to go so i want to greet you once more in the name of the lord jesus christ on behalf of our church and happy to see the different familiar faces and we have quite a few visitors here today sister anne brother elijah gibbs church is that right and then sister liz you're from brother craig boober's church my old pastor so we appreciate both of them brother david is it stephen shambo uh is that well well he's here but praise god and brother brent of course from brother paul of fontaine's we thank god for the different representatives here different churches but the same kingdom of god amen and of course the home folk and those that are watching i think maybe the john sister cheryl are watching as well so anybody under the side of my voice god bless you it's our privilege to be with you and we just want to look to the lord this morning if you would about your heads on a word of prayer and we just want to thank him most of all heavenly father we're grateful today that lord you've brought each and every one of us here safely lord not only from natural danger from spiritual perils lord the bible testifies that in the last days perilous times would come and father if there was ever a time that would be fulfilled it's now lord we are on the very cusp of a world entering the darkest and most deceitful the most wicked tribulation father in an age when when men will look for death and not be able to find it but father we're so grateful that in this very perilous hour there's a place of refuge there's a place of safety in our lord jesus christ lord we would not be taken in the hour of temptation the hour of wrath to come you've made a way of escape for us father we not have to be bound by chains of sin snared in satan's eden today but lord you would lift us up lord even now by your spirit may you quicken us lord in these mortal bodies follow me you're quick in our spirits may we come up higher today in revelation and in light and in wisdom by the power of the holy ghost in the name of jesus christ in so much lord that would just continue into the changing of these bodies lord we are in an hour when death shall be put off we should put on immortality lord though it's been sown in weakness to be raised in power though it was certain corruption will be raised incorruptible father we believe it with all of our hearts lord we testify but as witnesses today lord not just observers but witnesses of the resurrection in our own lives father i pray you bless the reading and the ministering the word of god today father there is many needs present in this building that i as a man i'm not aware of lord maybe even in my own life needs that i'm not aware of father but you knew each knee before we come before you lord you knew each knee before the foundation of the world before we asked lord you made a divine appointment for us today to stand here on july 4th of 2021 and hear the word of god father may you come and exceedingly do abundantly above anything we could ask or think fulfill thy will and purpose in this place and get unto yourself great glory and honor for we ask all these things in the mighty name of our lord and savior jesus christ and the bride says if you turn with me in the bibles today if you have your bibles saint john the second chapter we'll look in a couple different places here st john chapter 2 and then we'll also be going over to the 69th psalm this morning and i just tell you what there's a i feel a little patriotic i was telling the brothers and sisters yesterday i always feel a little patriotic of course i guess that's the idea on july 4th i said the only other time i feel this patriotic is when i'm coming back from a mission trip i tell you what you never really know how much you love the u.s until you're not in it and all these people they want listen and listen this country's done of course they're all done for and uh this is as wicked as this country i still rather live here than just about anywhere else uh tell you what all these people won't leave the u.s i leave it for like a week and i'm like man i'm ready to go back maybe i'm biased but uh i'll tell you what i love a good hamburger i love being able to shoot a gun and all my american things and praise god well anyway hallelujah if i feel that way about it in the natural how much more the kingdom of god listen we're no longer strangers or aliens aliens from the covenants of promise we are fellow citizens of the kingdom of god we're actually part of the family amen amen st john the second chapter and we'll start here in verse and uh we'll read down to verse 17. the bible says here speaking of our lord jesus uh in verse 13 it says here in the jews passover was at hand notice the jews passover because here comes the actual passover the jews passover was at hand and jesus went up to jerusalem and found in the temple those that sold oxen and sheep and dubs and the changes of money sitting and when he had made a scourge of small cords he drove them all out of the temple and the sheep and the oxen and poured out the changers money and overthrew the tables and he said unto them that sold doves take these things hence make not my father's house and house of merchandise now jesus does this at the end of his ministry before he's crucified but here in john the second chapter he's also done at the beginning of his ministry and i want you to notice the 17th verse here the disciples they saw jesus doing this and it brought to their remembrance something it says and his disciples remembered that it was written the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up amen turn with me to the 69th psalm we're going to look at the scripture that this reminded them of for a context for this morning i'd like to take a thought from my service today the zeal of this house the zeal of this house amen and then the 69th psalm now i went to the wrong bookmark here we go and the 69th psalm and we'll start in verse 6 and go down to verse 9. make things real even here amen the bible says here and this is the psalm of david it says let not them that wait on thee oh lord god of hosts be ashamed for my sake let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake o god of israel because for thy sake i have borne reproach shame hath covered my face i am become a stranger unto my brethren and an alien unto my mother's children why for the zeal of thine house hath eaten me up and the reproaches of them that reproached thee are fallen upon me may the lord bless the reading of his word you may be seated today while i remain standing for some time if you want to stand or whatever that's all right you know if the lord's in it i mean i wouldn't get up and uh shoot any firecrackers off yet but we do some spiritual uh jubilee here amen but uh we're talking about the zeal of this house and i think it's interesting when we read the scripture when we read about jesus coming into the temple it's a very portrait of a religious gathering we understand by the message that satan is not a creator amen he can only pervert what god has done even even everything that satan does is just a perversion what is adultery it's a right act done wrong what is a lie it's a truth perverted so satan is not a creator he there's nothing original in the kingdom of of the powers of darkness so we look at what he's doing here it's a religious gathering because that's what satan's always desired he's always desired worship he's he's religious he's you know he's a worship leader he's a he's a deacon he's everything else i mean he he wants everything that god has he wants a man in the pulpit he's got men in the pulpit today they're transformed as ministers of righteousness because he himself is transformed as an angel of light and so we look today and we can as as church going people church going people tend to look on the world as that guy out there it's the movies and the drugs and the alcohol but i want you always notice where the world is at it's right in church amen it's right there because the world loves to worship the world loves to praise god it just does it according to its own dictates amen so we look at this gathering like i said it's the jews passover they had their own concept of the passover the passover was an observance to them and yet our passover jesus christ the very one that the passover was testifying of was right there in their midst and they missed him so they're celebrating the passover but the passover himself is right there and they missed it amen they're going about their business making business in the temple but jesus is going about his father's business and then there's a group of people they're very zealous the bible says for their traditions but jesus was zealous that day as well not for the traditions and for selling some dubs but there was a zeal of this house the scripture testified of him that the zeal of this house it had eaten him up so we noticed and we noticed all through the scripture god and satan they're actually doing the same thing amen because satan's just trying to copy god listen the bible says that satan's going about the earth to and fro the book of job says he's going to and fro he's seeking someone peter says seeking someone to devour but the eyes of the lord are also going to and fro throughout the whole earth looking for someone i believe there's someone like that here today looking for someone to show himself mighty on their behalf he's looking for somebody to believe this word in the midst of the darkest most perverse religious gathering the world's ever had satan's eden yet there's a people that are going to believe god and stand for the word of god brother brahman says this he says the same people that believed in god and were zealous of god killed jesus i mean listen who killed jesus it wasn't the guy down the bootlegger store it wasn't the al capone of the guy then taxes it was the pastor in church it was a guy claiming to believe the word of god it was the guy who stood up there and read the bible every week he was the one that killed jesus i'm going somewhere with this for a reason amen because paul would testify years later they've got a zeal but it's not after knowledge he said they being ignorant of god's righteousness would not submit to god amen they're ignorant of god's righteousness and he said they weren't about to establish their own righteousness well i know a couple of people like that praise the lord not trying to it's true they're trying to establish their own righteousness their own ability their own purpose their own kingdom because they're ignorant well i'm already off on a tangent praise the lord listen i'm marvel when i see so much go on in churches that calls itself jesus christ calls itself message all this perversion and nonsense i'm thinking or do people just not fear god anymore what what would go through a man's mind and make him turn his back on god like that they're ignorant of god's righteousness they're ignorant of god's purpose because if you knew what this if you had a glimpse of it amen not just a taste of it but if you walked in the fullness of it you would recognize the only thing that awaits is judgment for those that turn down god brother brahm says in the church book he says now this false church has zeal can you name in somebody they have zeal he says make no mistake about that her zeal has literally been that of the jews he quotes saint john 2 17 like i did the zeal of that house of eat me up he says but it is a wrong zeal it is for the house of their own building it is for their own creeds dogmas organizations their own righteousness watch as they have put the word of god out for their own ideas he says they depose the holy ghost and made men leaders amen now we're there's been so much talk about insurrection here back in january and we live in a day where this country rebelled against certain leaders amen but i want you to know what the church world has done they have rebelled against the headship of the word of god the bro the prophet said they deposed the holy ghost i hope you catch what i'm saying they didn't politely ask jesus to step down they didn't ask him hey can you compromise a little bit can you move they deposed the holy ghost they forced them out violently they would not have anything to do with this man called jesus they shoved him out and now he's on the outside knocking on the door they pushed him out he didn't leave on his own they pushed him out they says this they have put aside eternal life as a person and make it good works or even church conformity rather than good works well we gotta look like the message we gotta act like the message hey i'm not against that you should look a certain way you should act a certain way but it does no good unless the life is in you to produce it listen if you put a bunch of of doves feathers on a raven guess what that raven's just a hypocrite we've got to have the oil coming out from the inside to clean this thing on the outside amen he says this god is calling for another zeal maybe we should name it that another zeal it called for another it is a zeal to cry i am wrong oh that's where we get excited we love being wrong don't we he says the question who's going to say he's wrong hey man not thinking about it that's a pretty tall question because who's going to say they're wrong that's we live in 2021 you've got more information you've got more technology listen you if you want to fix your car you can diy it on youtube you can be an expert in anything overnight and you let everybody know you're an expert well i know more about the message than the pastor i know more about them brothers so and so on and i know about and i know this and i know that mutant god we got an understanding it's contrary to the word of god after all but but we got an understanding everybody's right it's no different than the book of judges everybody did what was right in their own eyes that's not special everybody's always right and everyone always takes their time to let you know they're always right but where somebody's gonna say i'm wrong not me lord i'm wrong you're right my opinion my thoughts my feelings it doesn't matter that's why i say listen i'm not moved today by what i feel i'm not moved today by what i see i'm moved by what i believe no matter the circumstances no matter what anybody else says about it god is still right let every man's word be a lie and gods be true listen christ is always right and more importantly he's always righteous i mean see we're so worried about being right these jews were we're right and you're wrong listen they thought being right made them righteous but it's not the same only christ can make you righteous jesus said if your righteousness does not exceed that of the pharisees you can't even make it in the kingdom listen when jesus made a call in this hour revelation 3 what do you say be zealous therefore and repent because you're wrong amen we've got to make it right with god amen he made a call on this hour as many as i love i rebuke and chasten beas out that's another zeal be selfish therefore and repent now i marvel at this and i was studying this a little while back hearing things because he says if any man hears my voice he says i will open up the door and he says behold i stand at the door at night behold i stand at the door and knock anyone hears my voice and i begin to think about i'm like wait a minute he didn't say nothing he's knocking you know if i come to the door brother mark opens the door i'm like oh you heard my voice he's like well no i heard you knocking it was really strange i'm like wait he's knocking at the door he says well man here's my voice and i begin to think about that now that's striking to me because he's knocking at the door and he says if you hear my voice that means somewhere god was speaking amen and i thought about it i remember brother branham in the seventh seal he begins to tell us these seven thunders what did they come to do to wake up the church and he says they don't they don't come at once it says it's one after the the prophet actually begins to tap on the pulpit one two three explain what the thunders are and it dawned on me what is the thunders just it's the voice of god brother branham said in other words the thunders was god knocking out the door that's why brother brady when he preaches the seal says i'll lose ten thousand friends over this he knew that christ knocking by a seventh under revelation would be pushed out of the church it has to happen it was prophesied in this day but praise god there is a people when they heard those thunders it was more than a prophet speaking it was more than thunder it was more than noise it was more than a tape ministry it was the son of man speaking to us in this hour through a son of man we've recognized the voice that's why we open the door it's more than a man speaking god spoke through that man amen see the world just thinks it's a bunch of nonsense they look at the message they see some tape call they see some evangelists to see a healing ministry they hear the noise but they don't hear the voice it's just like what peter dealt with there on the road to damascus they all heard a noise but they didn't hear the voice they didn't see a man but paul had brother graham said he had spiritual understanding he recognized god had spoken to him oh praise god aren't you so thankful that god has given you an ability when the churches and the world have pushed christ out there's a people they've been preordained to receive him listen he's not come to make a house call he's come to inhabit this place i preach this all the time there's too many people that want a visitation from god god send us a visitation we need a visitation of god what we really need is a habitation let's quit inviting them over once a week let's quit having them over every now and then let him live in your house let him sit down and break bread in your house we got enough of this part-time christianity i worked with a guy like that years ago in the factory he'd been warned about me i was training him one day and he'd been warned about me i worked with him for about half a day or so he said you're not you're not one of them part-time christians are you said no sir no sir i'm full time in the kingdom of god amen i live and breathe jesus christ my very uprising mother renowned setting up jesus christ when i go out as jesus christ when i enter him it's jesus christ hallelujah praise the lord that same god that spoke i've talked about that and brother mark and sister ann were there john 12 when the cloud overshadowed them the different ones heard a voice is that right they said seriously we would see jesus and jesus is there and he's talking to him in the cloud he said father glorify your name and god speaks different ones heard different things different ones all different things but jesus lets you know the voice came for your sakes this is the voice of god in this day what do we have through a prophet's ministry it's for us many people say it's against us or it's not this or it's not that let me testify this message is for me it's not against me it's god he's for you he's for me and if god be for us who can be against us my am i he's done the same thing in this day satan's done the same thing god's done the same thing in this day the conditions are the same the religious world brother bram talks about it they're looking for what they're looking for an awakening they're looking for a great move of god they missed it already happened it's already taken place and even people in a message church will sit there we're waiting for this we're looking for a revival we're looking for the move of god god sent it to you already that's what the message was about the move is on right now that's 1965. the move is on for the bride that's thus saith the lord i like the way william booth said i'm not looking for a move of god i am a move of god this bride is the move of god today she's not waiting for god to come and do something he's already done it we believe it we stand on it we'll live and die on it it's like what brother man preaching the third exodus they were out there in the wilderness waiting on god and brother bam said god was waiting on them i'm off the beaten path here but you realize god's waiting on us amen actually the whole creation is waiting on us the bible tells us in romans 8 the whole creation is groaning and travailing looking for the manifestation of the sons of god that's you and i listen to the heavens how many times the scripture testifies the heavens must retain him until all things be put under his feet how's he gonna do that through you you're the body paul said in romans 15 that the god of peace will put satan under your feet shortly you and i've got something to do the world is waiting for us to grow up and to show up and be the church of god not just go to church let's be the church let's be the bride let's walk into the sword that god has given us hallelujah why are they looking for why they're looking for god to speak they're waiting for elijah listen i met a man some years back and he was in a church and i was trying to witness the message to him and he didn't know where i was coming from yeah i just kind of shared some of the doctrine and stuff he said you know my wife and i have been praying about i said we're waiting for malachi 4. he said you know elijah's got to come before the day of the lord i'm thinking he already has and he knew what not listen there are people in the world they're looking for elijah to come amen and they missed it listen they missed it in jesus own disciples mistake right looking for something to come amen and missing what's already happened you know jesus himself spoke he said listen foxes have holes birds have nests the son of man has nowhere to lay his head but praise god listen he found a place to put his head shipped in 1963 he manifested in arizona the headship has come down the bride has united with the bridegroom we are walking now under the preeminence of the word listen i'll just say this way if he doesn't have preeminence in your life today when's he going to get it what's he got to do what event are you waiting for we're looking for something to happen what you're looking for has already happened don't be ignorant of god's righteousness don't be ignorant of what he has already done the world is missing listen if you're sick today your healing's going through this room already listen if you haven't needed a deliverance today what you need is already in this room listen let me say this you've got murder and adultery and theft going through this room and say what are you talking about in another dimension there are radios and televisions and broadcasters putting all kinds of things through this room you just don't realize it and let me say this at a little faster frequency a little higher rotation everything you need is already here all you need is to receive it by faith tap into what god has given us brother man says we've got untapped resources man i i'm way off here but i'm going here anyway listen i live in i live in vancouver ohio i grew up in antwerp ohio next town north of us in ohio it's called hicksville what a great name for a town i wonder who lives there hicksville ohio there's an old man that died there when i was a teenager and old man died there they found him in his house one day this old man he didn't have water in his house he'd go take his neighbors running water didn't have electricity he was such a miser he lived through the depression he was such a miser he wouldn't spend money on bills or anything else he'd get ketchup practice from the restaurant she didn't have to buy cats all this stuff just as miserly as you could be and when he died his kids were in the house and guess what the man was a millionaire living in a shack had millions of dollars stuffed in the long coffee cans and under his mattress and everything else but he lived like that listen untapped resources you say we would look at that as individuals in the natural say man there's something wrong with that guy man go buy yourself a new pillow or something get a my pillow or something you know why why live like a beggar when you've got millions of dollars but how often do we as christians we sit in a message church and we live like beggars and we live like paupers listen we are not servants we're not beggars we are sons and daughters of god [Music] listen we're that cloud testify in 1963 brother ram told you what it is that's our lord up there listen don't leave him up there 30 miles in the air he's not there today he's in the bride now he's not in the church he's in the bride amen if someone's opened the door someone's going to let him come in someone's going to make him king someone's going to let him sit down a while not just visit for the weekend somebody's going to let him live in the house amen listen there's many that speak of christ but we have christ we have life we have the mind of christ the bible says that is that right we have the mind of christ let this mind that was in christ be in you we're looking for peace let the peace of god rule in your heart you let it it's here if you can receive oh it the lord i don't know what has to do with the rest of my text but i guess that's free brother bam says this he says remember jesus said when he was here on earth talking to a bunch of people who was very religious very fine very cultured a very zealous people of god but jesus said to them in vain you worship me teaching for doctrine their traditions of man he says remember i'm gonna do this now man it's really hot remember how pious those people was and how zealous of god watch this he says i believe if we were counting the people who were more zealous of today or that day they would be more zealous than we are far more when it comes to keeping the traditions and laws and things they live by those listen these guys weren't playing church they were serious about what they did but they were just seriously wrong they were sincerely wrong he says this he says this and they were very souls of god and they believed in god but jesus god made flesh among them said in vain you worship me i'll catch you since i talked about a little bit last week too he says now he didn't say they didn't worship him they was worshiping him but in vain can you imagine a lifetime of religious service and works and things all for nothing what's the point of it all this is where they were the jews in that temple were very zealous for their traditions but i want you to notice i pointed this out at the beginning there was a difference between their zeal and jesus's because when the disciples saw jesus watch they remembered what was written in other words his deal testified of the word of god it didn't testify of a man's ability or of a man's righteousness or of religion it testified the word of god amen that's another zeal that's the kind of zeal i want to have i don't want people saying oh man he's out for his church he's zealous for his ministry he zealous for this now let me be zealous in so much that produces the word of god in my life every time amen they saw a zeal something had devoured him amen it had consumed him it was the zeal for his house amen now i just want to use this as a uh a example for a moment as an illustration because you look at a man like saul of tarsus who was later the apostle paul and when he was a pharisee he was zealous then and then the bible says that he was exceedingly zealous so i was like here's the guy that zealous then saul's like no i'm i'm exceedingly zealous like you look like a scrub compared to me newbie you know what i'm saying he was exceeding sauce galatians 1 14 i profited in the jews religion above many mine equals in my own nation being more exceedingly zealous man he's really letting you know i was he was something else i was being more exceedingly zealous of the tradition of their fathers amen now listen i don't want to be zealous of a tradition amen listen people are zealous of traditions in the message people are zealous of traditions listen they will fight you over christmas they'll fight you over their seat in church they'll fight you over every little thing amen listen if we're at thanksgiving and there's one piece of turkey left they'll fight you for that piece of turkey listen people fight over everything all the time we'll fight over this light or this tree or this or not having it we fight over everything else i mean listen these jews fought over everything they were as divided as any other group of people amen because they were zealous about their traditions they say the results about god amen and listen we'll stand here and we'll get worked up about our favorite team we'll get worked up about our favorite holiday and everything else and praise god for america we get worked up about all this stuff but jesus was worked up about the house of god listen he was sitting there folding his hands he got up and got mad about it and he did something about it amen praise the lord these jews in the temple they were zealous over the traditions and i want you to notice why they were zealous now i already talked about here in galatians one but we'll talk about this again in philippians chapter three paul talks about this as well why were the jews so zealous for their traditions there's a actually it's a pretty simple reason paul tells you i profited in the jewish religion amen paul says in philippians 3 those things were game to me in other words man they were zealous their traditions because they made money doing it i tell you what you give a man some money he'll get zealous he might not come to church he might not want to serve god but give us some free food or give him a hundred dollars man he'll be there praise god i love the lord jesus i love my pastor i love my church i tell you what it's a good motivator isn't it amen it motivated paul it motivated these men they were sitting there making a bunch of money well that's why they were zealous they made money at it it was their livelihood amen well praise the lord listen well that's just the truth anyhow amen they were zealous because it profited them and when jesus appeared they were zealous for their traditions and jesus was against everything they preached and everything they did and so you notice this they were zealous and then they became jealous they became jealous because listen jesus was not just another preacher to them jesus was not just another man to them jesus represented an existential threat to everything they did because for them to admit they were wrong i am wrong is that right for them to admit they were wrong and repent and serve jesus would not be to just change churches it wouldn't be just to change how they worship it will be a drastic lifestyle change their entire livelihood their entire way of life they're standing in the community they would have to forsake everything that's why they couldn't receive them listen it was not a minor inconvenience listen i've been to countries like afro like uh india africa is a continent been to countries like india amen where christianity is not well received listen if you as a as a person born in a hindu home you become a christian in a country like india you lose all kinds of government entitlements and education everything for them to become a christian is not just changing churches like it is in america it is a drastic is a forsaking their own families will forsake them and abandon them they've got to change their name to show they're not even hindu anymore you say what are you doing listen you know when they convert they're sincere because they have to lose something to do it unfortunately i said unfortunately i mean i'm not i'm not wishing for persecution but it seems like we get so complacent well i'm going to go to this church and i'm going to do this i'm going to do that we're going to do what's convenient listen it was not convenient for these jews to receive jesus that's why they forsook it that's why they rejected it paul told me listen it didn't profit me to do this it profited me to be a jew i profited in the religious it was gained to me i had status i had money i had popularity but but the things that were gaining me i counted them loss [Music] amen think about these pharisees jesus tells you what it is brother says it's an actor right jesus tells you why they do what they did they love the chief of seats in the synagogues they love to be seen devouring windows houses that for pre-tests they make long prayers amen everything they did they did because it benefited them listen if that's the only reason you serve god if that's the only reason you're in church you're no different than the rest of the world i'm going somewhere now listen i don't know what happened listen this country was founded because men made a sacrifice we are here today because men and women made sacrifices and then we got to a place where nobody wants to offer sacrifice anymore amen we're not going to go to church if it's not convenient or if it don't work out if nobody pats me on the back if i'm not famous if they don't give me a bunch of money well i'm not going to serve god you're no different than a pharisee you're not different than a sadducee right well i believe if we just compromise on the message a little bit we could have a bigger class of church and a better kind of people if that's your motivation you might as well be a publican or heathen see they were zealous for the traditions that's why they were jealous of jesus christ amen they won't have nothing to do with church if it don't benefit them but here's what i love about paul a man he he was zealous as a pharisee but look at him as a christian when god strikes him down off his high horse and that pillar of fire meets them what i love about paul is not like some of these people they go to church and they they they wait till the church falls apart and then just church hop and we're gonna go to this next church because it's popular it's convenient no paul wanted to make sure this time he said i didn't confer with man he said i went down to arabia for three years he started digging he started searching he wanted to make sure this time was different i want to make sure when i get up off the ground and i go out and preach this i'm not just caught up in the next fad some people just move from one message fad to another message fad some people just live from a trial to another trial from one church split to another church various from one false preacher to another false preacher we are called and ordained to be changed from glory unto glory by the spirit of god you start digging that's what i'm saying some people get very casual that's why i talk about devotion last week some people get very casual in their christian experience they go they go through something they sit in the church and they preach all kinds of blasphemy and heresy and they just walk out like well pretty good i'll just go somewhere else and they never sit there and question man well i something should have worn me i've got to have a deeper experience where it don't matter what the pastor says it don't matter what the deacon says it doesn't matter what everybody else says i've got to hear from god what is the truth where i can stand like daniel i can stand like elijah i can stand when nobody else wants to believe it i still believe it because god has spoken unto me amen brother bram says that's the problem we got people that go to church i'm methodist to the core i'm presbyterian to the core brother brahman says i want to be god to the core give us some god-called christians from hardcore die-hard christians and no matter what the world says it doesn't matter what the church says they're gonna live christianity they're gonna they're gonna be consumed by it listen this apostle when he when he when he became a christian listen he went through the ringer a time or two some of you won't get that but that's one of the american youth the ringer like the old laundry thing and praise a lot listen paul went through a couple things actually paul went through a lot of things actually he was warned he would go through a lot of things think about this imagine a man coming to light hands and anonymized come to lay hands on him and pray for him to receive the holy ghost imagine the man coming to lay hands on you as a minister and say by the way just so you know god has told me you're going to suffer a lot of things for his name's sake oh praise god i can't yes i get to suffer from god now a lot of us might not have had that attitude but that's what the disciples thought about it listen when they were beaten and they were imprisoned and called out for preaching in this name and they were commanded not to teach in this name anymore they went out rejoicing listen jesus said rejoice when men revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my namesake rejoice and be exceeding love for great is your reward in heaven listen if you stand for this gospel you're going to be lied on you're going to be called names you're going to be treated funny but rejoice when it happens for great is your reward paul listen paul didn't just get made fun of at church he was beaten he was afflicted he was they put him in prisons and atonements and fastings and hungers and stripes his shipwrecks and everywhere he went he was in trouble trouble just seemed to follow him everywhere he went amen but you know what he wasn't doing it because it profited him amen the zeal of this house i believe it's the same as the our lord jesus had that day in the temple the zeal for this house had eaten him up it was his passion it was his drive his ambition his all-consuming desire was to present a chaste virgin unto bride unto jesus christ a spouse that chased virgins as a bride to jesus christ amen that was his whole imperative his life was tied up in this it consumed them amen what caused this man i want you to catch this now what caused a man like paul who had been a great man a man of status and acumen and education and all these things what caused this man to have such a consuming imperative in his life he was jealous i'll let that hang there saying what he was jealous listen he wasn't jealous of a man amen somebody he wasn't jealous of popularity he wasn't jealous of money he was jealous over the people of god he was jealous for god's sake he said i'm jealous over you with a godly jealousy because he was jealous over god's people because he was jealous for god that's what made him zealous see the jews were zealous and it made him jealous but paul was jealous that's what made him so zealous he wasn't jealous over money he wasn't jealous over position he was just for the lord of hosts and his jealousy over god's people that nobody would manhandle the purchase of god's possession that's that jealousy is what drove him that jealousy is what consumed him that jealousy is what caused him to throw himself into harm's way despite the circumstances despite the peril he would throw himself into the breach for the people of god he goes to the corinthian church he tells him that he said i've been jealous over you with a godly jealousy these other men come in and they preach this stuff and they loved it they loved all this extra nonsense these chiefest apostles he said why is the more i love you the less i'm loved but so be it he said for the father ought to lay up for the children and not the children for the father there was something important even when he was rejected by his own brethren like david like jesus wrote even when he was rejected he had a steal i was a stranger to my brother and the scripture says the reproach of the lord fell upon me but the zeal of that house have to eat me up hey man hey man so the question is where is his house today listen i can't build a house hey man but you can give him one can't build him one can't fast one for him can't make him one but a body amen amen he's not looking for a house made with hands but a body's been prepared amen what is the purpose of that body lo i come in the volume of the book it is written to me i've come to do thy will oh lord i believe his body today has come to fulfill his will on the earth amen praise the lord i believe that's why prophet would preach this myth listen to prophet we talk about sacrifice talking about the natural but i want you to think about this it cost a profit something to preach this message it cost some friends it cost them influence it cost some money listen we look at oral roberts and we look at tommy osborne and these men listen to prophet he could have had a ministry like that he could have been the most famous popular name there ever was but he knew what this word meant god knew what this word meant there was a little itty bitty people that the world rejected but you're precious in the sight of god and god said i will allow that man to compromise i won't allow him to preach his own thought because there must be a bride present on the earth to fulfill the will of god my my amen so listen it's like this hey man when a man receives jesus christ in his life it does something for him there's a zeal for this house amen you're the house of god amen you're the thing he's zealous for because you're the thing he's jealous over his purchase of the redemption of his of what he's paid for amen listen you hear this all the time i hear people say this they go to church say you know what i just i love the church and i love the family of god i love getting together i love going to service i love my church most of them don't love church they just love their position they just love their fellowship i mean they just love what it means to them amen you want to know if you love the church that's not how much you love your pastor it's not how much you love the guy with the most money it's not how much you love your best friend at church how much do you love the most least insignificant most carnal person in your church the one nobody else thinks about than one nobody else cares about can you love them the same way that'll show you whether you really love the church or not listen i had a man coming in one time and i'm not trying to speak ill of him but it's just the truth he come to me one time he said you know what brother alex said i just and i'm not saying this to both i'm just telling you the story he said i just really appreciate brother alex you always think about you take care of these people in the church that other people forget about the ones that nobody else thinks about and i'm thinking he meant that as a compliment but actually just reflects badly on of him hey man that doesn't really make me look good that just makes other people look bad amen we're all supposed to do that that's not special that's christianity eternal life's living for others listen the least of us should do that that's not oh man this preacher he just loves people you're supposed to love everybody you're supposed to do it what is that listen nobody praises the mountain because it stood in the distance in the morning out in arizona i'm in the mountain praise god it's stan it just does what it does that's not special oh man this brother he he just loves people you're supposed to love people that doesn't make me good that makes you not as good i mean but i'll be honest he said that and i know he meant as a compliment that devastated me it devastated me i said what kind of a testimony is that you should be able to say it about yourself it didn't make me feel good at all and i don't need it anyway hey man it's like oh you know i always tell that story about martin luther or maybe you know this one but martin luther talked about a man i'm getting all kinds of stories today i guess hey happy independence day martin luther said a man laying in a casket it doesn't matter where his best friend comes up his worst enemy he can slander that man he can call him all kinds of names in that casket you can prop him up say oh he was a good man he was just the best of friend it doesn't matter what you say to him he's dead he doesn't care he's not moved by criticism and he's not moved by flattery and listen when a man is dead in christ he's not moved by criticism he's not moved by flattery he's moved by jesus christ because he's actually dead the only thing that can move him is resurrection is that right listen satan can't push you down and push you up oh you're just the best this and you're the greatest and yes now i don't need it i don't want it either i'm looking for one man to compliment me i'm looking for one praise at the end of the day when i stand before the lord that day and i go to my reward i'm looking for him to say well done it doesn't matter what the critics say it doesn't matter what the flatteries have to say i'm looking for him to say well done his voice is the voice that moves me you can still say nice things about each other that's okay don't don't get me wrong well i'm not gonna say anything next to that guy i wasn't saying that either but listen that's what moved these pharisees oh man it's just a great man of god what a what a powerful what a what a praiseworthy man of god that's a move then that's why they did it listen that's why if we just go to church to be seen and hurt we're here for the wrong reason amen they love their church they love their position they love this but how do you love the least esteemed lowest most carnal christian in your church that's the question amen i tell this story sometimes and i can't remember if i read the fox book of martyrs it's in the histories but uh saint lawrence was a deacon in the church of roma i believe it was and during the great persecution the church emperor valerian he called saint lawrence to come forth on behalf of the church there in rome he said now listen he said i'm emperor now in rome and if you want me to wipe your people out you've got to pay tribute to me so emperor valerian tells saint lawrence that i want you to go back to your church and bring me the riches of your church it's tribute it's a tribute to my greatness so st lawrence says all right i'll abide by your wish great sees her and he goes and he comes back three days later and he brings you know what he does he brings every person that's lame every person is blind every person that's hauled all the weak all the infirm and the emperor he just he's just fit to be tied he's just mad he said you insult me i'm an emperor i will have you killed for this how dare you mock me i said bring me the treasures of your church not this rabble and saint lawrence i love his responses oh great emperor live forever these are the treasures of the church this is the treasure of the church listen you might feel like you're the least least most least esteemed christian in church but you're a treasure in the sight of god [Music] amen hey man it's not about the great one of this and that your favorite preacher your favorite listen there's only one great one it's jesus christ now listen now listen if you fall in love with jesus you fall in love with his children that's the zeal of this house hey man if you really love god you'll love his children and if he really loves god's children the zeal this house will eat you up listen if you love god and you love god's children i don't have to make you love one another i don't have to make you go to church i don't have to make you pray i don't have to make you listen to the message you'll do it because you love god you'll love one another because you love god any one another listen to zeal this house it ate him up incidentally i looked at this greek word amen i looked at this greek word for eating up here i'm like what's this mean you know what it means it means eating up it means exactly what it says i might well praise god for revelation i mean in other words it devoured or consumed he was eaten up with the zeal in this house listen many of us stuff has eat us up we've lost friends we've lost family we've lost a job we've had things in our life that bother us to where we can't sleep at night we just can't even hardly eat a meal we're so distraught we're so broke up because this person didn't shake our hand or this person did something to us and it just eats us up to where we can't even go on with our lives like we used to we can't sleep we can't function listen if that negative thing would eat you up like that what's gonna happen when the zeal of this house eats you up and then quit flirting with it on the weekend let it consume you let it eat you up till there's nothing left praise god it's a fire don't just leave it shut up in your bones listen jeremiah tried to leave it sharp in his bones one day he couldn't forebear i tell you what if i got up one day and i said man i just don't feel like serving god today something in me wouldn't let me stop it's like a fire shut up in my bones listen god's been too good to me god's been too good to me he's been better to me than i've been to myself i know what i used to be i know what i know it was i know where i come from i know that even at my very best we are all together vanity but yet god knew our frame that we're but gush he pities us as the father pities his children i know what he's done for me that's why i love his children because god loves his children because he loves me and i'm his child amen listen if you love god i don't have to make you pray for one another i don't have to make you take care of one another the zeal of this house will eat you up you'll listen you'll do it when you don't even feel like it man well so-and-so they just wronged me and they just mistreated me and now that listen something in you will stop that something in you will bring this moral body subject say you know what i'm going to turn the cheek i'm going to pray for those that curse me i'm gonna bless those that despitefully use me listen many of us have been hurt we've all been hurt somewhere and we go through things that just gnaws at us consumes our thinking but when this zeal let the zeal be the thing that consumes you amen david had a desire he said i've got one desire amen is that right psalm 27 i've got one desire is to dwell in the house of the lord forever hot the natural house the natural temple was his zeal listen it's a whole other sermon but listen this is the reason god made a covenant with him he wanted to build god a house second samuel chapter seven amen he wanted to build god a house listen i can't build him one but i can get him one amen and i can take care of the one he's got amen praise the lord the zeal of this house you think about elijah the great mount carmel showdown he meets god afterwards what does he tell god lord i did all this because i'm very jealous for the lord of hosts i'm jealous for the lord of hosts amen i believe our elijah this day was such a man he was zealous for this message because he was jealous over this bride amen that's what paul you remember preaching about jehu here a couple weeks ago jehu amen he was a man that was zealous because he was jealous for the lord because he'd been anointed by that prophet amen and i thought and i'm not going to reach that whole sermon again but you look at jehu he's anointed destroyed jezebel when he goes to destroy jezebel he doesn't renegotiate he doesn't stop to to fuss and argue and fight about it he just goes and runs down everything that gets in his way why because they said come up here and see my zeal for the lord of hosts and then when a man's got a zeal for god ain't nothing going to stand in his way well praise the lord i tell you what you get zealous for a rock bane you'll be at every concert you get zealous for drugs you'll find money if you got a bum for it amen but when you get zealous for the kingdom of god nobody's gonna stop you from serving god nobody can stop you from praying amen and don't matter if you're the only one you'll throw your doors open like daniel and pray like you've always prayed you'll see god's face when nobody else wants to do it amen nothing going to stop you amen too many people they're playing with church hey man playing with the world hop in the chariot and run over all that nonsense it's time to go destroy jezebel it's time to show them our zeal amen we're here to stand up for an everlasting kingdom we have received a kingdom that cannot be moved when everything else that can be shaken is being shaken in 2021 we have received the one thing the one thing that can't be moved we are a part of it that's why paul could testify none of these things move me well praise the lord amen oh praise the lord amen listen jesus jesus is jealous for his church listen he didn't just go collect it from the bargain bin he didn't get a good deal on amazon prime for you he bled for you he suffered for you he died for you he sent prophets he sent preachers he sent his word he sent gifts he'd done everything he could do listen there's nothing else he could do anymore that he's already done to testify you were worth it to him listen he didn't go up there begrudgingly on the cross and say man why am i stuck here man this is a mistake no he didn't want to go there he despised the shame but he endured why for the joy for the joy that was set before him he's talking about you he's talking about you you are the joy jesus was jealous over the people of god that's why he wouldn't allow the things that were going on in the house of god to go on any longer hey man i want you to catch this now cause we talk about zeal a lot well some of us do i guess hopefully we talk about zeal we as as as american church-going christians we look at zeal a little bit different way than the bible looks at it amen we look at zeal as the man that's in church and he praises god the most and he hey praise god shouts and praises god and moves around oh man he's giving money and he's doing this oh he's just so zealous i want you to notice every example in the bible of a man being zealous he was mad hey man listen listen i tell you what i i guess i got a confession to make i'm a little bit of an angry person sometimes amen because i'm zealous for the lord of hosts i'm jealous over god's people amen when jehu was asked it made him mad when elijah was us that made him met with jesus listen jesus got mad jesus got mad paul got mad about it that because they were zealous their zeal wasn't tied to how much they could shout or dance or move it was tied to how their righteous indignation was stirred up that they would not allow god's bride to be manhandled amen listen you get a deal for god you're going to get angry i don't know where we got this this this i tell you what we live in a day and age or the only person that's not allowed to be masculine is a man everybody else is allowed to be masculine but if a man acts like a man we penalize him in this country oh he's just toxic and he's this and that nobody's got a backbone and too many men in the church they got a wishbone instead of a backbone let's throw the wishbone out let's get them back bone listen these men that sit here and pander to the masses they didn't try to play knives they stood on the unfailing word of god when it cost them their reputation cost them influence cost them their lives because the righteous in the nation would not allow them to hold their peace praise the lord listen yeah i used this example amen i said if a man if i was at home today and i was in the front yard in some white van with no symbols or anything on it some white van pulled up in front of the yard and they tried to take my kids or they tried to take my wife i tell you what i wouldn't do i wouldn't fold my hands and say well i hope they make it out i hope where they're going to a better place oh maybe i'll pray for him no i'd walk over there and pummel the guy or shoot the guy or something listen that's my wife that's my kids and man it's not because i'm mad or i'm trying to hate the guy but i i love my wife i love my kids i wouldn't let that go on and yet we do that in church well the devil come into our home he'll try to take our prayer life they'll try to ruin our church we just fold our hands well well i just you know i'll be praying for him i hope somebody comes along and helps him out stand up and be a man the devil wants to take your devotion out of your home stand up and rebuild the family altar the devil wants to come and take your prayer lines get on your knees and pray well nobody else in church wants to serve god serve god anyhow look the devil right in the eye and let him know i don't care what you have to say about it i don't care what you say i'm gonna praise him anyway man we're gonna wish you ashley it's just like this country man man we used to shoot people for raising our taxes it's the truth anyhow no taxation without representation listen you think your country represents you today you're living in a daydream that only represents one thing money amen i'm not here to preach politics but it's all faith it's all nonsense i think i said this last week but the prophet said if abraham lincoln and george washington were in every county in this country you still couldn't bring it back it's bought sold and locked out to the devil [Music] but you've got all the men they're all like well you know i don't want to hurt somebody's feelings they won't listen patrick henry and george washington and paul revere weren't worried if they hurt the king of england's feelings they'd shoot him and he was there i'm not advocating physical violence but i'm making a point hey man listen when you really love something and you're really zealous over something you'll stand and fight for it you'll die if you've got you'll live down your life where our lord laid down his life for this church and when a man gets god on the inside he'll lay down his life for the church of god he's got to he'll lead on his life for the kingdom of god because he knows that the kingdom of god is greater than any one of us your life your purpose your ambition it's nothing without the kingdom of god well i just don't know about that listen brother had a dream one time amen and there was a man and a woman in that dream they they represented the church and the catholic church and the bride but he saw his mother and his daddy you know the vision or the dream hopefully but brother bram's in this dream and that man had that three-sided club the trinity doctrine and every time she tried to get up he'd go and club her down and brother ram said uh i didn't know what to do he said i hadn't fought for years because he used to be a boxer i hadn't fought for years he was a great big man i didn't know what i was going to do about it but he said in the dream all of a sudden i grew great big faith muscles hey man listen he had strength he didn't know about you've got strength you don't know about you might look at the enemy today say i don't have the strength to live an overcoming life without somebody to prop me up or this or that listen you've got strength you don't know about it's called faith it's not a conscious thing it's subconscious it's there when you need it if you're a believer amen listen those faith muscles grew on him and he went up to that man let me tell you what brother ram did not do he did not go up to that man club in the ride and say would you please stop doing that mister sir would you would you reconsider your actions what you're doing is well i tell you what if you don't stop this i'm gonna go call somebody up i'm gonna i'm gonna you know get a hold of a more response i need an adult or something like you know he didn't do any of that you know what brother branham did he stood up and walked that man right up in his face and listen you strike her again you're gonna have to deal with me you've got no right to strike her and let me say today as a minister of the gospel of jesus christ satan still has no right to touch this bride today i tell you what if he wants to come in my house come in my life he's going to have to go through me first he'll have to step over my dead body all this wishy-washy and the folding of the hands this and that we need we need some men we need some women of god today hey man don't just leave it on the man now you sister's a man let's get a backbone let's all stand up let's mean business with the devil why we sit here negotiate there's nothing to negotiate about we just need to compromise and change this and that listen got paid too great a price for that i mean god paid too great a price for you for me to sell it out for some money or some popularity or some harlot somewhere god paid too great a price for you to be manhandled by laodicea and god forbid that i or any of us should stand here and compromise on this message when a man like william branham suffered for it listen he lost his wife he lost his daughter he suffered his life so that you and i could believe this message listen men like uh like like uh william tyndall we're burned men and women suffered listen women watched their little children devoured by lions and and flamed their skin off their bodies testifying that they would receive a greater reward martyrs throughout history we are not here of our own accord we have entered into other men's labors men have suffered and bled and died for us to stand here today not to compromise not to give up if they could stand let us stand see the devil does this he'll be like well you know you shouldn't get mad at people you know he'll try to condemn you you're just you're upset with those people you're a hypocrite i'm not upset with people i'm upset with you not mad at my brother or sister whoever i'm upset of the devil praise the lord amen it's the truth amen listen i'm not listen i'm not upset with the people i love the people that's why i'm so mad about it listen this is for somebody i don't know who this is for this for somebody you are allowed to be angry we make this like it's a bad thing oh this so-and-so got angry well they got angry in the bible listen they gotten angry made them do something about it maybe that's why you haven't done nothing about for 15 20 years maybe you just ain't got angry enough yet listen shane got angry one day and he did something about it and then you get angry enough you'll stop letting the devil push you around you'll stop letting popularity make your decisions for you you'll stop being ruled by money or some kind of nonsense you get mad enough amen that's right the bible says be angry and sin not he didn't say well maybe you could be or if you no actually just be angry and sinnah but don't let the sun down go down upon your ass no there's no sit there just floss over go do something about it jesus did something about it listen he wasn't like human raging mad but he was angry listen he went and fashioned himself a rip in his anger and his righteous indignation he fasted himself a device to clean god's house praise the lord listen i've got no apology for the word of god i'm not ashamed of the gospel of christ it is the power of god unto salvation to them that believe amen listen god has ordained us to speak on behalf of those that cannot speak amen maybe his family friends whatever it would be the bible says in isaiah 62 he says for zion's sake i will not hold my peace and man listen it's time to stop holding your peace for zion's sake i will not hold my peace for jerusalem's sake i will not rest i'm not going to allow the enemy to shut me up i'm not going to allow this popularity this modern age to stop me from preaching the truth amen somebody don't leave it on me now make that your testimony i will not be silenced i will not be stopped i will not be forced to back away i will not compromise the word of god i will stand i will believe i will preach the truth regardless of the circumstances because i love god's people because i love god i'm willing to fight for them if you want to touch god's people you've got to go through me hope you feel that way before god touches my pastor before god touches the song leader before god touches anybody else in my i'm sorry before the devil well i guess i caught that one before the devil touches anybody else he's got to go through me listen you say but i'm nobody i'm not this i'm not that listen when the weakest christian when the weakest christian goes to their knees the devil's trouble what are you talking about he's afraid of you not afraid of your flesh he's afraid of the one you represent you're not here on your own today you're representing somebody can you imagine a police officer brother baby's the example of a police officer can you imagine him going up saying well now i don't want to offend this guy so i'm not going to get my badge out and i'm just going to ask him no he's got a job to do he represents something so he's going to exercise some authority listen let's exercise some authority in our homes let's quit negotiating with the anime let's stand up and mean business listen i'll say it this way amen like i said earlier if you're jealous over god's people you'll fight for them you'll have a zeal for them if you don't listen i feel that way about my wife my kids if you don't feel that way there's something wrong with you say it that way if you don't feel that way there's something wrong with you these men felt that way these men elijah was upset jesus was upset paul was upset phineas in the bible was upset when he saw the plight of the enemy come in they got mad and did something amen listen even jesus pilate talks to jesus and jesus says if my kingdom were of this world then my servants would fight amen listen he didn't say they can't fight or that the pacifist he just said they won't fight because it's not this world amen so listen they do have fight in them there's not fight in this world the natural they're the weapons of our warfare they're not carnal but they are mighty listen god's put a sword in your hand god has given you armor to do something with it it's not to polish it and set it on the rock it's to go find a good fight listen if you fight people in the natural for your family how much more in the supernatural listen god's people fight for what's right amen listen there's all kinds of stuff that goes on call itself message i was thinking about this i had a brother coming years ago we were talking about these different things that rise up in the message and this and that and he said brother there seems to be so much that it calls up christians says how do you tell the difference you know the obvious answer is well the spirit of god and the word of god but he was talking about a certain thing i said i said well here's the thing brother the bible says that knowledge puffeth up but love edifies i said so if his preaching just puffs you up or makes him look great or that's all it's for that's just knowledge but love will edify the here why do you say this brother what's your point this is what i'm getting at with this people don't care how much you know they want to know how much you care we're too busy trying to be right all the time like i said the beginning well i know the message and i know this and i know that people are not impressed by how much you know but what they want to know is how much you care by this shall all men know that you're my disciples that they have love one to another amen god give us a message to resurrect us out of dark denominationalism he give us the spirit why now i'm bringing it down home today amen because where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty amen god did not come to set us free in our sin he come to set us free from our sins amen it is the glorious liberty the bible says the glorious liberty of the sons of god that's what the message has come to do to give us liberty not to put us under some other some guy it's to set us free to be sons of god to be daughters of god amen we have liberty and paul tells the galatians in the fifth chapter he warns them stand fast in the liberty wherein christ has set you free don't be entangled again with a yuck of bondage listen god had set these galatians free and the desire to go back under bondage he said don't do that stand don't sit there don't wait for paul to do it you stand in the liberty when god has set you free you stand for this message you stand for the spirit of god you stand for that which is right because listen there's all kinds of people the bible says they promise liberty the scripture says they promise liberty but they are the servants of corruption hey man you look at people that they leave church they leave the message they leave christian whatever and they're going on about oh you know i'm finally free on this then i'm free i'm like man you're more bound than you've ever been in your life listen i used to be bound that way when i was in the world that's why i had no desire to go back to egypt i've got no desire to live under a task master i did that for 24 years of my life i never want to do it another day of my life i'd rather die than go back to egypt i'd rather die than be a slave another day oh i'm so free i'm so this stuff listen i know what it's like to be mine this message this jesus christ that i'm preaching he set me free you can lock me up in a prison you can shove me in a cold cold grave i don't care if you lock the key lock it up throw away the key i don't care if you're burying me i'm as free today as i've ever been amen i'm the freest man there's ever been it doesn't matter whether the outlaw in this country what they say about it i've got liberty today in jesus christ stand fast in this liberty i think of men even the natural i think of this country men that suffered and died so we could stand here today and have freedom of religion i think of a man by the name of patrick henry stood in saint john's church in virginia one day and he stood there a man and he told them people is life so dear is peace so sweet that we could purchase it with the price of chains and slavery he said forbidden almighty god he says i know not what course others will take but as for me give me liberty or give me death i don't know what others will say but as for me and my house we will serve the lord amen give me liberty or give me death hey man listen if i feel that way in the natural how much more in this supernatural way man if i listen i'd rather die standing for jesus christ than to bend the knee to some backslid devil somewhere amen i bend the knee to only one jesus christ and one day everybody's gonna bend their knee to him i don't bend the knee to satan i don't bend the knee a letter to see it i don't bend the need of money or women or popularity amen i only bend my knee to jesus christ and if i'm gonna die standing i'd rather die standing for jesus than live on my knees a slave to satan amen i'd rather be dead than serve the devil another day of my life i've done that i don't want nothing to do with it again death is preferable to slavery not everybody feels that way that's why they live as slaves that's why schanger lived that way but he got to place one day in his life said you know what i'd rather die than live this way anymore listen you want to serve god you've got to die to that old self you've got to get a place where you would rather die than live as that man that's why so many people they're all scribbled up in church they still love their lives too much but jesus said unless you take up your cross and you die you can't be my disciple listen if you're not willing to die for it you're not going to be able to live for it amen we're here as a country because men made sacrifices we're here today as believers because men made sacrifices amen let's quit playing around let's quit playing church listen we are an armed citizenry i'm talking about the kingdom now we are an armed citizenry amen we have we are ambassadors of christ amen we're ambassadors of god of christ for god amen what is an ambassador you know this well this is a whole nothing but what's an ambassador he represents another nation though he's on foreign soil he represents another nation and in his embassy you know what's remarkable to me that embassy that ground that that country gives you like for the united states their embassy that ground is actually united states territory it is sovereign within itself listen i don't care what the rest of your church does i don't care what the rest of your neighborhood does my house is sovereign territory i have already been translated out of the powers of darkness into the kingdom of his dear son we're ambassadors for christ amen we're standing for the message we stand for jesus christ amen amen and listen if you're going to fight over your seat in church you're going to fight over traditions and turkey and everything else and football games and this that let's fight for something worth dying for listen i i like turkeys and that much the next person but i'm not willing to die if you get that piece of turkey you want my seat in church i mean i i'm going to die over him i might yell you a little bit i just go sit somewhere else so i'm not willing to die for that but i'm going to die for this and don't just let that be lip service a lot of people say that i said how do you know you really want to die for it because you die for it every day listen you've got to reckon every day when you get out of your bed i've got to die daily it doesn't matter my wife my kids my church my job no matter what jesus christ i'll lay it all down for you if you can't do that you're no different than a pharisee amen praise the lord he give us something worth fighting for something worth dying for something worth living for amen so get in there and fight amen let's quit like man let's fight like men our god is a man of war amen he'll teach your hands how to fight he'll teach your fingers how to fight your hands how to war amen listen we're all caught up the world's caught up in this victim mentality i'm gonna i'm gonna end on this here amen the world's caught up in this victim entire everybody's a victim everybody's oppressed everybody's defeated everybody's this they're marginalized everybody's a victim listen i am not a victim in the kingdom of god actually satan is my victim now he used to be my oppressor now i'm his tormentor when i walk in the room when you walk in the room the devils ought to tremble because here comes a believer with the spirit of god amen hallelujah buddy amen we are more the bible says we're more than conquerors we are not a vic listen jesus was not a victim he might have looked like it see pilate thought he was a victim oh listen i can do whatever i want to jesus said no you ain't got no power or we said my father gave it to you i'm not the victim i am the master even in his death even in his capture he was the master of a circumstance he had the power to lay down his own life oh my he had power to take up his own life hey man well i hope you get i hope if you get nothing out of this get some fight in you today tell you what you go out to lunch and they give you the wrong thing you'll be yelling at the waitress and she didn't even she didn't even cook it why would we do that look up the cash register well this said 299 back there and you're charging me 319. well they didn't put the price tag up why you under that part man we'll fight everybody over dumb stuff let's fight the enemy let's fight the flesh let's get in here let's serve god let's be zealous for the lord of hosts let's be jealous over god's people
