[35:06] more power than i've
[35:10] ever seen i'm
[35:13] learning to
[35:28] i'm learning to lean on jesus
[35:36] gaining more power
[35:40] than i've ever seen
[35:43] i'm learning to lean
[35:47] on jesus
[35:50] amen one more time learning
[35:54] to lead i'm learning
[35:58] to lean i'm learning
[36:01] to lean on jesus
[36:07] gaining more power
[36:11] than i've ever seen
[36:14] i'm learning to lean
[36:18] on jesus
[36:24] amen we need more power than we've ever
[36:27] seen
[36:28] because evil is getting worse and worse
[36:31] the world's getting worse the
[36:32] temptations are getting worse and
[36:34] we need to lean on jesus a little bit
[36:36] more amen and it's a
[36:39] a process to learn to lean because
[36:42] satan is wanting us to lean on our own
[36:44] understanding
[36:45] figure it all out and we need to learn
[36:48] to not lean to our understanding but to
[36:51] to lean on jesus i say it's a privilege
[36:53] that we have to come and gather together
[36:56] in the house of the lord despite uh
[37:01] maybe how the day's been
[37:04] busyness how we feel even if we're sick
[37:08] we could be in nigeria running for our
[37:12] lives
[37:13] so i say it's a privilege for us to be
[37:15] here to just
[37:17] you know i'm sure if we were all
[37:20] watching the super bowl we'd be excited
[37:23] we might also get excited about the lord
[37:25] amen amen
[37:26] let him know we're happy to
[37:30] to be in his house amen amen
[37:33] turn with me if you would to the book of
[37:35] saint peter
[37:37] chapter one as we continue on in
[37:40] the church order we are um
[37:44] we're saddened uh for
[37:47] um our the family
[37:51] of sister carolyn uh gazelle that's
[37:55] left behind we i know that if she was
[37:58] here she'd want us to pray for her
[37:59] family
[38:03] she used to really like that song shut
[38:05] in with god
[38:07] and when she would uh come here uh
[38:11] she'd shake her hand if you remember
[38:13] those that shook hands with her she'd
[38:15] she'd grab your hand with two hands and
[38:17] she said god bless you
[38:19] she wouldn't just do a little shake she
[38:20] you know you feel your whole body
[38:22] shaking
[38:23] she she really loved the presence of the
[38:27] lord and she
[38:28] stayed so faithful despite all that she
[38:31] went
[38:32] through with her family not supporting
[38:35] her but
[38:36] she had something that kept her and
[38:38] she's in a better place now but we need
[38:40] to pray for
[38:41] family amen
[38:45] amen before we begin reading here in
[38:47] first peter
[38:48] uh chapter one let's look to the lord
[38:51] and
[38:52] in a word of prayer heavenly father lord
[38:54] as we
[38:55] have endeavored to walk
[38:58] in the direction that you have
[39:01] wanted our little church to walk in
[39:05] and lord the testimonies that have come
[39:09] forth just from this church order has
[39:12] not only affected our church but lord
[39:14] we've heard
[39:15] so many testimonies of our lives being
[39:19] affected our homes being affected
[39:21] and we want to thank you for that lord
[39:23] we want to thank you for what you're
[39:24] doing
[39:25] inside of our hearts and our lives
[39:29] and we pray that you would fill us so
[39:31] full with the holy spirit lord that
[39:34] we would be able to continue to walk
[39:36] more and more
[39:38] in your holiness lord give us grace lord
[39:41] for those things
[39:42] uh lord as you spoke one time and it's
[39:45] been quoted many times from the pulpit
[39:47] you had
[39:48] many things to say unto us but we could
[39:50] not bear it lord
[39:52] so if you just fill us with more of the
[39:54] spirit we'll be able to bear
[39:56] the things that you've called us to do
[39:58] in our lives
[39:59] bless this word lord to our hearts as we
[40:03] read it and these quotes that we're
[40:04] getting into
[40:06] we just pray that you'd give us all
[40:07] revelation tonight lord let us not leave
[40:11] here
[40:11] uh in in a condition lord
[40:15] that we would be discouraged but let us
[40:18] leave
[40:18] this place today lord with a a greater
[40:22] revelation drawn closer
[40:23] to you lord and that these these words
[40:26] that we read from your book and the
[40:28] quotes from the message
[40:29] may they be an impact in our life lord
[40:32] may they bring a revelation
[40:34] to our lives and may we become more like
[40:36] you father will be ever grateful
[40:38] for these things lord we trust that you
[40:41] do them for we humbly ask that now
[40:43] in jesus christ's name amen
[40:46] amen i trust the lord do you amen
[40:50] amen first peter chapter 1 verse 13
[40:53] wherefore gird up the loins of your mind
[40:55] be sober
[40:56] and hope to the end for the grace that
[40:58] is to be brought unto you
[41:00] at the revelation of jesus christ now
[41:03] only god
[41:04] can bring that amen as obedient children
[41:07] not
[41:08] fashioning yourselves according to the
[41:10] former lust
[41:11] in your ignorance but as he which have
[41:14] called you is holy
[41:15] so be holy in all manner of
[41:17] conversations because it is written be
[41:19] holy for i am holy amen and then just
[41:23] one more
[41:24] in matthew chapter 7 verse 13
[41:27] and 14.
[41:32] enter he and at the straight gate for
[41:34] wide is the gate and broad is the way
[41:36] that leadeth to destruction
[41:38] and many there be which go in there at
[41:42] because strait is the gate nero is the
[41:43] way which leadeth unto life
[41:45] and few be the few there be
[41:48] that find it amen god bless you may be
[41:51] seated
[41:53] there are two ways
[41:57] god's way and
[42:00] we'll say the way of the world which is
[42:03] the devil's way
[42:05] which is the same way as man's way the
[42:07] same number
[42:09] and uh the way that we
[42:12] uh were were raised
[42:16] was not necessarily um
[42:19] the way that
[42:23] is perfectly god's way
[42:29] um even if we were raised
[42:32] um by um
[42:36] message parents and they tried their
[42:38] very best to
[42:40] teach us the right way um
[42:43] we did a lot of things because we were
[42:46] told this is what we do
[42:50] but it was not revealed to us by the
[42:52] holy spirit what holiness was
[42:54] so when we're
[42:58] we're sitting in a place where we have
[43:00] an opinion and an idea
[43:02] uh of what holiness is but really god is
[43:06] teaching us
[43:08] and god will continue to teach us um and
[43:11] the
[43:11] the moment that we feel that we we've
[43:13] got things pretty well sold up is
[43:15] is the time that we get in trouble and
[43:18] so
[43:19] we want to uh uh
[43:23] we talked about the call to become holy
[43:26] we
[43:26] last uh service we we uh
[43:30] entitled that responding to the call and
[43:32] we we all responded everybody raised
[43:34] their hands that i want
[43:35] i want to respond to this call and
[43:37] tonight i want to talk about entering
[43:39] into the door
[43:40] of holiness in other words we've
[43:42] responded but
[43:44] um there's there's times that we can
[43:46] respond to something
[43:48] and not continue to walk it so we want
[43:50] to be committed
[43:51] to the call of becoming more holy
[43:54] amen do not be satisfied with
[43:58] how holy you are or what you view as
[44:01] holiness
[44:02] but know that there's more to holiness
[44:05] because there's more to god and god
[44:07] wants to
[44:08] show us all but remember he he won't
[44:11] force it it has to go through female
[44:13] agency you've got to want it
[44:15] and it's a personal relationship you got
[44:17] to put your attention
[44:18] towards it um
[44:22] and and and have a yearning and a desire
[44:25] to keep walking in the direction as you
[44:27] go into that door
[44:28] i know what door i'm walking and saying
[44:30] when you walk into a restaurant you want
[44:32] to
[44:33] walk into a restaurant say you want to
[44:36] walk into
[44:38] arby's because you you want to
[44:42] get something there at arby's
[44:46] well you're not going to go into arby's
[44:49] and sit down at the table
[44:51] and order a t-bone steak
[44:54] because it's arby's you know what door
[44:57] you're walking into you know what they
[44:58] have so when you're
[45:00] you're walking to this door of holiness
[45:03] it's not your opinion of holiness it is
[45:05] god's holiness
[45:11] we don't want holiness to become just a
[45:13] part of our life we want to become our
[45:16] life
[45:18] it the bible says none of us will see
[45:20] the lord
[45:22] amen that's why the jesus said blessed
[45:24] are the pure in heart for they shall
[45:26] see the lord amen i would love
[45:29] to hear some testimonies i love for the
[45:32] church
[45:33] to hear some of these testimonies of
[45:35] what
[45:36] is happening in people's lives because
[45:39] of this church order i think it would be
[45:41] encouraging
[45:42] i think it's important to let the devil
[45:44] know what side you're on
[45:46] because he's he's constantly taunting us
[45:49] and we we
[45:49] need uh
[45:54] we need one another
[45:57] and uh
[46:01] we know god is pleased with us becoming
[46:04] more holy
[46:07] and so the the more we can make the
[46:10] stick make it real it'll be encouraging
[46:12] to one another so we need to
[46:14] make sure that we're we're staying
[46:16] committed to this
[46:18] and uh when we share these testimonies i
[46:20] think it helps us
[46:21] to make that commitment even longer
[46:25] if satan can't get us to ignore the
[46:28] straight narrow path
[46:29] of his holiness then he's going to do
[46:31] everything he can
[46:33] to distract us from staying in the path
[46:40] some may feel well brother john
[46:43] i've got the knowledge i know now you've
[46:46] told me
[46:47] so let's move on
[46:51] sometimes we can know so much
[46:55] that we forget
[46:58] what we're to become
[47:03] so we need to stay humble remember we
[47:05] quoted out of isaiah there
[47:07] the holy one of israel the lofty one
[47:10] that inhabits eternity whose name is
[47:12] holy i
[47:13] dwell in the high and holy place and
[47:15] with him also that is of a contrite and
[47:17] humble spirit
[47:18] to revive the spirit of a humble to
[47:20] revive the heart of the contrite ones
[47:22] so we need to stay humble
[47:25] stay committed to staying humble
[47:28] stay committed to staying humble because
[47:31] that's
[47:32] a a good sign that you're dwelling
[47:35] in holiness
[47:40] a lot of times believers don't even
[47:42] recognize what spirit they're projecting
[47:44] right amen
[47:47] so holiness has a lot to do with our
[47:50] spirit now if satan
[47:52] cannot puff you up with knowledge then
[47:55] he's going to try to destroy
[47:56] distract you with busyness
[48:01] don't allow yourself to be so busy from
[48:04] going from one frying pan to a next
[48:09] satan does not want you to focus on
[48:12] becoming what
[48:13] god is in other words satan wants you to
[48:17] think well holiness
[48:18] is just um a men cutting their hair or
[48:21] women letting their hair grow long
[48:24] or women wearing a dress and men not
[48:27] uh saying you know a bad joke and that's
[48:30] holiness
[48:31] but it's so much beyond that so much
[48:34] beyond that
[48:36] but the thing is if you don't have a
[48:37] heart to pursue it
[48:40] then you're going to feel like you're
[48:41] there
[48:43] and he'll do everything he can to
[48:45] distract you from getting serious about
[48:48] becoming more holy
[48:54] some may feel that they're there brother
[48:56] john you know
[48:57] i've heard this i've heard this okay
[48:59] you've heard this but what about
[49:00] becoming more
[49:02] what about more what about what you
[49:05] haven't heard
[49:07] and it's not what you haven't heard from
[49:10] the fivefold ministry or
[49:12] or or the prophet but what about god
[49:14] speaking to you that still small voice
[49:17] in your prayer closet about what he
[49:19] wants in your life
[49:23] so we want to be committed to that
[49:24] committed to staying
[49:26] walking not just with the things you've
[49:28] shown you but
[49:29] other things we put our hand
[49:32] to the plow we don't want to look back
[49:34] we want to keep moving forward amen
[49:38] so we've stepped into his holy sanctuary
[49:41] this church right here we've reverenced
[49:44] his house
[49:45] we've heard the call not just from the
[49:47] pulpit now but we've heard the call
[49:51] in our hearts from in our hearts it's
[49:54] personal to us
[49:56] remember god told moses i will commune
[49:59] with thee from above
[50:01] the mercy seat
[50:04] which sits upon the ark the ark being
[50:08] our heart
[50:08] where the where we we've kept the word
[50:11] we keep
[50:12] his commandments where there's life
[50:13] happening right there
[50:16] and he speaks to us amen
[50:20] amen he meets with us there it's not
[50:23] just from the pulpit here
[50:25] but something is spoken that that rings
[50:28] true in your heart and it means
[50:30] it's real to you so we responded to his
[50:34] call
[50:34] and now we're walking through the door
[50:36] of god's
[50:37] holiness revelations chapter 3 verse 18
[50:41] jesus says i counsel thee to buy of me
[50:43] gold tried
[50:45] in the fire that thou mayest be rich
[50:48] white raiment that thou means be clothed
[50:51] that the shame of thy nakedness do not
[50:53] appear
[50:55] and anoint thine eyes with eyes that
[50:57] that thou may receive
[50:58] it looks like they're not holy
[51:02] and we need the holy spirit
[51:06] deity gold tried in the fire
[51:10] so as god comes and speaks to us to a
[51:13] heart
[51:15] there's assurance as many as
[51:18] i love that's right
[51:22] i rebuke i chasten
[51:25] i mean i want that person to be
[51:29] what i want them to be right amen
[51:33] and so he gives us his advice his
[51:36] counsel
[51:38] he says get excited zealious
[51:41] on fire burning and repent
[51:45] turn from where you're at that you've
[51:47] been used to all your life that you've
[51:49] walked like this for years and years and
[51:51] years
[51:52] and you're okay with it but but he's
[51:55] speaking
[51:55] and he wants us to turn around from that
[51:57] condition and walk towards him
[52:00] amen now god in this building should be
[52:02] speaking to every one of us
[52:04] individually about certain things
[52:08] same word being preached but god's
[52:10] speaking to each of us
[52:11] individually about things that he wants
[52:13] to see changed
[52:16] that's how personal it has to be oh
[52:18] personal it should be
[52:19] right he says behold i stand at the door
[52:23] and knock if any man hear my voice
[52:27] and open the door i will come in to him
[52:31] and will sup with him
[52:32] and he with me where does that happen
[52:35] the door
[52:36] the heart amen this is where the
[52:40] conversation is going it's not going in
[52:42] here and
[52:43] here and here
[52:46] but there's a realness to the word in
[52:48] your life
[52:49] that's why it's important to be prepared
[52:51] to come to god's house
[52:53] so you're not struggling in the flesh to
[52:56] hear from god
[52:57] amen we repent we turn
[53:01] towards god's direction of holiness
[53:06] you open the door of your heart to god's
[53:10] holy spirit holy
[53:14] spirit and let him come
[53:18] inside amen look at what we get here
[53:21] we get a communion he says to him that
[53:24] overcometh
[53:25] i will grant to sit with me so what are
[53:27] we going to overcome
[53:29] our flesh that wants to do its own thing
[53:31] amen
[53:32] we overcome all things all the things
[53:36] that
[53:36] that is standing in the way of god
[53:38] sitting on the throne of our heart and
[53:40] having his way amen
[53:42] to him that overcometh i grant to sit
[53:44] with me on my throne even as i overcame
[53:46] and sit
[53:46] down with my father in his throne he
[53:49] that have an ear
[53:51] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[53:54] the churches
[53:55] praise god honey's got a ear it's not
[53:58] this one
[53:59] not this one it's right here it's a real
[54:02] it's a real ear brother branham said in
[54:05] the message behold i stand at the door
[54:07] and knock
[54:08] he says now can i say can you
[54:11] show me somebody that belongs to church
[54:14] thousands
[54:15] can you show me somebody that shouts
[54:18] thousands
[54:18] speaks into tons thousands works
[54:21] miracles
[54:22] thousands but show me somebody that
[54:25] sighs and cries
[54:26] for the abominations did in the church
[54:29] [Music]
[54:32] who's concerned about that amen
[54:36] see how worldly we get
[54:40] we get away cutting our hair wearing
[54:42] wrong dresses drinking cigarettes
[54:45] out there drink smoke and all these
[54:46] things you see
[54:48] where it's at we let down the bars and
[54:50] compromised with
[54:52] sin what we need tonight is to listen
[54:55] to the knock at our door
[54:59] at our door return to me he's quoting
[55:03] now
[55:04] if the people that are called by night
[55:06] my name shall assemble themselves
[55:08] together and pray
[55:09] then i will hear from heaven
[55:13] i just think it's beautiful that god is
[55:16] dealing with
[55:16] us it's a sure sign
[55:20] of a love affair it's an expression
[55:23] of i love you of course when we send and

[55:54] like me
[55:59] um but god sends his valentines he wants
[56:02] us to be like him

[56:07] to become us to pay for sin and now we
[56:11] are to become like him amen
[56:15] all right so we're committed to god's
[56:19] holy will now everything now is becoming
[56:23] more like christ because we've entered
[56:25] that door
[56:26] second corinthians 5 17 says therefore
[56:28] if any man be in christ he's a new
[56:30] creature
[56:31] old things are passed away behold all
[56:34] things
[56:34] are become new and all things are of god
[56:37] so we've entered that door

[56:52] for someone to tell you this is what you
[56:54] need to be doing don't do that don't do
[56:56] that
[56:56] don't have a relationship like that have
[56:59] it so real that you get used
[57:00] that's god i need to do that amen
[57:05] and when we give the lord liberty in our
[57:07] lives we're changed into the same
[57:10] image from glory to glory even by the
[57:13] spirit
[57:13] of the lord amen that you give god
[57:16] liberty
[57:17] he'll change your life if you say yes
[57:19] lord if that's your will
[57:21] thy will be done he'll come in he'll
[57:23] change your life
[57:24] you won't have to do it it'll be god
[57:26] inside of you doing it as sure as
[57:28] anything
[57:30] so we need to keep laying in the
[57:32] presence of the sun and ripen
[57:34] keep listening to the message
[57:38] keep listening to the tapes keep
[57:39] listening to what the prophet said
[57:41] because it is truly the definition of
[57:44] what will understand he is the
[57:46] interpreter of this book
[57:47] he he is the interpreter of the the
[57:50] message
[57:51] is the interpretation of this book for
[57:53] this hour for the message so we can
[57:55] understand
[57:56] what true holiness means
[58:03] now as we listen to the message that
[58:05] we're going to get a complete different
[58:06] perspective of god's holiness
[58:09] than we got from our parents our family
[58:12] our friends our neighbor the government
[58:18] brother branham says that we can't know
[58:20] god
[58:21] through books or education
[58:25] in the message identification of christ
[58:26] in all ages he said when a man
[58:28] is in the presence of god then he knows
[58:31] something
[58:31] right so
[58:35] isaiah really knew something when he got
[58:37] in the presence of the lord
[58:39] you know what he knew he knew he was
[58:41] undone
[58:43] he's unworthy yes amen that's that's the
[58:46] kind of knowledge we need amen
[58:50] brother brandon says you can take a dead
[58:52] center rotten carnal in his mind
[58:54] and his thinking criticizer of the power
[58:56] of god and bring him into the presence
[58:58] of the holy ghost
[58:59] there will be something happen to him
[59:03] sure that's that's
[59:06] it that that's why we should labor to
[59:08] get into the presence
[59:10] because god's going to do it and eating
[59:12] us here trying to
[59:13] hear the word trying to figure it out
[59:15] trying to you know calculate
[59:16] what we're going to do no just get into
[59:18] the presence of god and this word will
[59:20] become real to us
[59:23] we left off last service with quoting
[59:27] from the siege and that shall possess
[59:29] the gate of the enemy
[59:31] said women with their hair cut wearing
[59:34] shorts
[59:34] makeup and still professing to have the
[59:36] holy ghost something's wrong with that
[59:39] depending on the evidence of speaking in
[59:40] tongues jumping up and down or shouting
[59:42] and brother brandon makes this statement
[59:44] they fail that still small voice of the
[59:48] word
[59:50] in other words this is about feelings
[59:52] and about emotions god's with me
[59:54] yes it's and they do what they want to
[59:56] do but he says what they're doing is
[59:59] failing the still small voice of the
[1:00:02] word
[1:00:03] the word is our absolute not our
[1:00:05] feelings not our emotions
[1:00:07] he said the word keeps you balanced to
[1:00:10] the cross
[1:00:12] now if we got time i'll come back and
[1:00:15] i'll read these but
[1:00:16] if you want to write them down the
[1:00:18] scripture for women not to cut their
[1:00:20] hair
[1:00:21] it's first corinthians chapter 11
[1:00:24] verses 1 through 15. paul starts out
[1:00:28] just say be followers of me
[1:00:30] even as i am of christ he says in verse
[1:00:33] 5
[1:00:33] every woman that prayeth or prophesieth
[1:00:35] with her hair uncover
[1:00:37] dishonor or dishonor with her head
[1:00:41] and verse 14 says does not even nature
[1:00:44] itself teach you that a man that if a
[1:00:47] man have long hair
[1:00:48] it is a shame unto him
[1:00:51] you take all the the animals in the
[1:00:54] animal kingdom
[1:00:55] the the the males have the long hair
[1:00:57] they look
[1:00:58] real pretty right all the animals they
[1:01:02] they look
[1:01:03] so nice but man was made in god's image
[1:01:08] not the animals and that's why a man
[1:01:12] a man should not have long hair
[1:01:19] verse 15 but if a woman have long hair
[1:01:22] it is a glory to her
[1:01:23] for her hair is given her for a covering
[1:01:27] amen so it is absolutely the will of the
[1:01:29] lord for
[1:01:30] a woman not to cut her hair we it says
[1:01:33] if you're just going to trim a little
[1:01:35] bit you must
[1:01:35] just shave your head that's what the
[1:01:37] bible says
[1:01:39] so no cutting the hair of women it's
[1:01:42] just
[1:01:42] the order that god wants it's his word
[1:01:47] amen women wearing the wrong clothing
[1:01:51] as we're going to get into some of these
[1:01:53] quotes and we we've heard
[1:01:55] that a woman should wear shorts and
[1:01:56] shouldn't wear pants
[1:01:59] deuteronomy chapter 22 verse 5 the woman
[1:02:01] shall not wear that which pertains unto
[1:02:03] a man neither shall
[1:02:05] a man put on a woman's garment for all
[1:02:08] that do so are an abomination
[1:02:10] unto the lord thy god amen
[1:02:14] in other words they fail that still
[1:02:17] small voice of the word
[1:02:20] everybody else is doing in the church
[1:02:21] why can't i
[1:02:23] but it's a man-made church we're
[1:02:25] interested we're
[1:02:26] interested in what the word says that
[1:02:28] that still small voice of the word amen
[1:02:32] in the message the signs of his coming
[1:02:34] brother branham said
[1:02:36] sure well the people call you call you
[1:02:39] that in other words they came to brother
[1:02:40] bran
[1:02:41] said you're a prophet and he says well
[1:02:44] he said i didn't say that he says well
[1:02:45] the people call you that
[1:02:46] then why don't you teach them great
[1:02:48] things how to receive the gifts instead
[1:02:50] of
[1:02:50] talking to the women about wearing short
[1:02:53] hair and
[1:02:54] wearing things that they do and makeup
[1:02:57] and stuff like
[1:02:58] the way they do and things like that i
[1:03:01] said
[1:03:02] how am i going to teach them algebra if
[1:03:04] they won't learn their abcs
[1:03:08] they won't come out of kindergarten
[1:03:11] the common decency to line up with the
[1:03:14] word
[1:03:14] of god that's exactly right
[1:03:17] how you're going to do that you can't do
[1:03:20] it
[1:03:21] why they just just
[1:03:24] those god called is the ones that hear
[1:03:30] amen he said my sheep hear my voice amen
[1:03:33] that's right
[1:03:34] they know the voice of god it speaks
[1:03:36] from the word
[1:03:38] and the word is what does it yes that's
[1:03:41] why we cannot fail the word of god if
[1:03:43] the word of god
[1:03:44] says it it should mean something to us
[1:03:45] i'll say this you husbands
[1:03:47] with wives that are not lining up it is
[1:03:50] your job and we'll get into this god
[1:03:52] willing
[1:03:52] sunday because this is mainly for the
[1:03:54] sisters here but
[1:03:55] us brothers we need to be helping our
[1:03:57] wives line up with the word
[1:04:04] yes
[1:04:07] the word speaking to our hearts will
[1:04:11] change
[1:04:12] our spirit
[1:04:15] it will change our lives
[1:04:20] and the thing is we can't force our wife
[1:04:23] to do something
[1:04:25] to a point but we can lay down our lives
[1:04:29] and pray with them every day and pray
[1:04:31] for the situation
[1:04:32] and keep bringing the scripture and and
[1:04:34] serving them in such a way that they see
[1:04:36] christ in us
[1:04:38] absolutely so i just say to a point
[1:04:42] i mean you can't put them in a headlock
[1:04:43] and say you better put this dress on
[1:04:46] you can't do that but you know what you
[1:04:48] can get down on your knees and spend
[1:04:50] some time praying and say this is so
[1:04:52] important this is the word of god
[1:04:53] here it is they said we got this we got
[1:04:55] to do this honey
[1:04:57] yes
[1:05:02] first peter chapter 3 our opening
[1:05:06] scripture
[1:05:12] verse three whose adorning let it not be
[1:05:14] the outward adorning the playing the
[1:05:15] hair the wearing of gold or the putting
[1:05:17] out of the peril
[1:05:18] but let it be the hidden man of the
[1:05:19] heart
[1:05:21] so it's going from the outside take it
[1:05:24] nope
[1:05:25] don't be distracted by that let it be
[1:05:28] the hidden man of the heart
[1:05:30] in that which is not corruptable even
[1:05:32] the ornament of a meek
[1:05:34] and quiet spirit yes which is in the
[1:05:37] sight of god a great
[1:05:39] price now when i was a kid i
[1:05:43] i used to uh trade
[1:05:48] quarters for silver quarters and dimes
[1:05:51] for silver dimes
[1:05:53] because i thought the silver was worth
[1:05:56] more even though you couldn't get more
[1:05:57] at the store for it
[1:06:00] but it was of a greater price to me
[1:06:05] and god views a meek and quiet spirit
[1:06:09] and i'm talking as an ornament now when
[1:06:11] you see an ornament you see something
[1:06:12] that's there all the time
[1:06:15] it's just hanging around you all the
[1:06:18] time
[1:06:19] meek quiet god says that's a great price
[1:06:23] i put a great value now god he can
[1:06:25] create anything to do anything so
[1:06:26] for god to say that's a great price
[1:06:28] that's huge
[1:06:30] that is huge so it's really important
[1:06:33] here
[1:06:35] that we have more of a meek spirit
[1:06:38] and a quiet spirit than we would have
[1:06:42] the adorning of the hair
[1:06:45] and the peril that we put on
[1:06:50] the voice of god is speaking
[1:06:54] the sheep are hearing the voice of god
[1:06:57] amen and we must re have the mind of
[1:07:00] christ
[1:07:01] to obey that word amen brother branham
[1:07:04] said in the message
[1:07:06] he says when you come to total obedience
[1:07:09] then you can have possession
[1:07:14] but until you totally obey you've got to
[1:07:17] completely surrender
[1:07:18] your own thoughts your own will
[1:07:22] your own mind and let the mind of christ
[1:07:25] operate in you
[1:07:30] we can't pick and choose stuff
[1:07:34] we must make sure that our entire spirit
[1:07:37] is in order not just the outside you
[1:07:40] know we put so much emphasis
[1:07:42] got to make sure i wear this got to make
[1:07:43] sure i do this if i don't do this what
[1:07:45] are they going to think
[1:07:46] what about our spirit right amen our
[1:07:49] complete
[1:07:50] attitude has to be in order if it's not
[1:07:53] in order how are we going to be
[1:07:54] completely
[1:07:55] holy right
[1:08:02] if an ornament of a meek and quiet
[1:08:04] spirit
[1:08:06] is a great price in the sight of god
[1:08:09] then a forward
[1:08:10] loud spirit can grieve the lord
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:18] i know we can have the holy ghost and
[1:08:22] that's wonderful that's wonderful
[1:08:25] but that doesn't give us any right to be
[1:08:27] grieving the spirit of god
[1:08:31] so holiness has to do with
[1:08:35] how we are inside amen we don't want to
[1:08:38] underestimate the importance of getting
[1:08:41] our attitude and keeping
[1:08:42] our attitude in order
[1:08:46] brother branham said in the infilling
[1:08:48] infallibility
[1:08:49] of god's spoken word he says you know
[1:08:53] i was telling the boys a while ago
[1:08:55] coming over
[1:08:56] i said about how we must be happy all
[1:09:00] the time
[1:09:01] amen amen i agree with that amen
[1:09:05] god don't want you to be sad
[1:09:08] you know what ill-temper does
[1:09:11] and that old temper that's one of the
[1:09:14] awfulest
[1:09:15] old things
[1:09:19] and it's about 60 of the cause
[1:09:22] of all sickness is temper yes what a
[1:09:25] statement
[1:09:30] it's about 60 of the cause of
[1:09:34] all sickness is temper yes sir
[1:09:37] he says them tantrums you fly loose
[1:09:42] remember you're just developing a cancer
[1:09:45] an ulcer or something like that when you
[1:09:48] do it
[1:09:50] when you get all stewed up about
[1:09:52] somebody i won't go back there anymore
[1:09:55] wait till i give them a piece of my mind
[1:09:58] he says all right remember you're
[1:10:01] the ones going to pay for it he says
[1:10:05] just be happy amen just be happy
[1:10:09] a temper is an expression of a bad
[1:10:12] attitude
[1:10:13] it's a result of you judging because
[1:10:16] you didn't get what you thought was fair
[1:10:18] so you're going to fly off the handle
[1:10:21] you're just opening the door for the
[1:10:24] enemy to come in
[1:10:25] and cause your body more problems
[1:10:28] now um i'm not saying that what you have
[1:10:33] is that 60 percent
[1:10:37] but who are you to say that it's only
[1:10:39] the 40.
[1:10:41] are you with me i just say it like this
[1:10:43] check up on that
[1:10:44] amen check up on that
[1:10:48] and make sure that your spirit is just
[1:10:50] as holy
[1:10:53] as what you're wearing amen brother
[1:10:56] brahman said in the message questions
[1:10:57] and answers
[1:10:58] he says brother branham what do you
[1:11:00] think about our sisters in the church
[1:11:02] wearing short dresses
[1:11:04] does it mar our testimony and set the
[1:11:07] wrong example for our young people in
[1:11:09] this
[1:11:09] our church in this our church it seems
[1:11:13] so to see a grown woman wearing a
[1:11:17] dress so short it shows her knees when
[1:11:19] she walks
[1:11:22] the man says ever who you are sister
[1:11:25] brother
[1:11:26] whoever it is i agree with you 100
[1:11:30] it's a disgrace but tell me
[1:11:34] what to do about it i preach it
[1:11:37] just as hard as i know to preach it
[1:11:40] and they do the same yes so it's their
[1:11:44] judgment
[1:11:46] cause because the words went forth
[1:11:49] yes i'm certainly against them little
[1:11:51] old skin tight dresses
[1:11:54] i constantly fuss at my kids becky and
[1:11:57] sarah
[1:11:59] i don't care how little they are i just
[1:12:02] fuss at them all the time
[1:12:05] i think they even wear their dresses
[1:12:09] dot dot media takes becky apart every
[1:12:12] day about it see
[1:12:15] so yes it's not easy peasy dealing with
[1:12:19] it
[1:12:20] he says you you can expect that
[1:12:23] in the kids and you have to correct them
[1:12:27] but when it comes to a woman there's
[1:12:30] something wrong there
[1:12:31] [Music]
[1:12:34] see
[1:12:39] isaiah chapter 3 verse 16
[1:12:45] says moreover the lord saith because the
[1:12:48] daughters of zion are
[1:12:49] haughty and walk with stretched forth
[1:12:53] necks
[1:12:54] and wanton eyes walking and mincing as
[1:12:58] they go
[1:12:59] and making a tingling with their feet
[1:13:06] quickly click cleals just want everybody
[1:13:08] to know
[1:13:10] i'm walking
[1:13:14] i don't care

[1:13:25] brother ram says look at the modern one
[1:13:27] today
[1:13:28] little skinned down dress that every
[1:13:31] form

[1:13:46] wearing a little skirt just up about
[1:13:49] above her knees it's got uh if she's got
[1:13:52] on any at all
[1:13:58] wisdom versus faith brother brahm said
[1:14:00] in the message
[1:14:01] the resurrection of lazarus he says
[1:14:03] notice the signs begin to appear
[1:14:05] there was a man by the name of zacchaeus
[1:14:10] zacharias i'm sorry and his wife
[1:14:11] elizabeth religious
[1:14:13] holy people keeping the commandments of
[1:14:15] god and walking in all the statutes and
[1:14:17] ordinance of god
[1:14:18] blameless he says that's the kind of
[1:14:20] home we need today
[1:14:23] that's the kind of hole we need today
[1:14:26] don't you believe that he said
[1:14:29] in instead of that in the church today
[1:14:32] we have everything else but holiness
[1:14:36] and righteousness now this is brother
[1:14:39] random preaching
[1:14:40] amen that's what he could see
[1:14:45] but they were righteous people godly
[1:14:47] people walking in the commandments of
[1:14:48] the lord keeping all the ordinance
[1:14:50] blameless
[1:14:51] zacharias was a priest at the temple and
[1:14:53] his office was to burn incense while
[1:14:56] a prayer was being made and one day
[1:14:58] while he was in the temple burning
[1:15:00] incense
[1:15:01] gabriel an angel from god came down and
[1:15:03] stood by the altar of incense and said
[1:15:05] zacharias fear not your prayers
[1:15:08] is heard oh i love that
[1:15:12] his wife was barren she didn't have any
[1:15:15] children
[1:15:16] she was past the age of bearing but he
[1:15:18] lived right
[1:15:19] before god and he believed on god
[1:15:23] and all of his great dark long hours
[1:15:26] of worry finally the angel come and said
[1:15:29] god has heard
[1:15:30] your prayers now if you want god to hear
[1:15:34] your prayer
[1:15:36] and send an angel to your home live
[1:15:38] right
[1:15:39] do right treat everybody right be right
[1:15:41] before god and god will grant that to
[1:15:44] you
[1:15:45] amen we sing that song sometimes be
[1:15:48] glorified in our homes in our homes lord
[1:15:50] be glorified
[1:15:53] in the message god's provided way
[1:15:55] brother brahman says no there's only two
[1:15:57] ways of anything
[1:15:58] that's the right way and the wrong way
[1:16:02] and then ways are your ways and god's
[1:16:04] ways
[1:16:06] and you can't be in your way in god's
[1:16:08] way at the same time
[1:16:11] you've got to forget your own way to get
[1:16:14] into god's way
[1:16:16] and you got to get out of your way your
[1:16:18] own way to get into god's way
[1:16:21] for as long as you're in your own way
[1:16:24] you're out of his way so forsake your
[1:16:27] ways forsake your thoughts forsake
[1:16:29] everything and just rely uh just
[1:16:32] rely one thing on thus saith the lord
[1:16:36] that's all
[1:16:37] then you'll know you're right yes
[1:16:41] amen though you can't
[1:16:45] see it none of these senses will say it
[1:16:47] right
[1:16:49] every one of them will say it wrong but
[1:16:52] you know
[1:16:53] it's right because god said so
[1:16:58] that's what makes it right so you don't
[1:17:00] you can't go off your reasoning and what
[1:17:01] you think and what you've been
[1:17:03] taught all your life now his provided
[1:17:07] way
[1:17:08] has been his word it is his word
[1:17:11] god's provided a way for the human to
[1:17:13] live
[1:17:14] is not by your senses but by his word
[1:17:17] yes amen it's right there it settles it
[1:17:21] right there
[1:17:24] the two ways the straight way the
[1:17:26] straight and narrow path
[1:17:28] and the broad way many go to broadway
[1:17:32] you talk to the majority of the people
[1:17:33] they don't want to hear about holiness
[1:17:36] [Music]
[1:17:39] in the message a blessing prophet
[1:17:40] brother bram says and the whole church
[1:17:42] has become diabetic
[1:17:45] and every little cut that comes instead
[1:17:48] of walking on
[1:17:50] you pick at it it can't heal
[1:17:53] selfishness greed and more in more
[1:17:56] immorality everything else that's in the
[1:18:00] calendar of god's
[1:18:01] wrongdoing the church is picking
[1:18:05] up those habits men drinking smoking
[1:18:07] telling dirty jokes
[1:18:08] women cutting their hair wearing makeup
[1:18:10] and doing all kinds of things dressing
[1:18:11] themselves
[1:18:12] in moral light to face the people
[1:18:15] all those things are because it's a lack
[1:18:18] of the blood of the lord jesus christ to
[1:18:21] cleanse us from all
[1:18:22] unrighteousness amen
[1:18:26] that may seem hard sure it's hard but
[1:18:29] it's the truth
[1:18:32] i think ann was sharing a quote with me
[1:18:33] and i'm not sure if i got this right so
[1:18:35] you have to correct me in but
[1:18:36] we all uh
[1:18:40] have or plead enough of the blood to be
[1:18:42] forgiven
[1:18:44] but not enough to be committed to
[1:18:48] walking
[1:18:49] the way he wants us to walk
[1:18:52] set that the gist of it that quote
[1:18:55] that's the gist of it
[1:18:57] and you know brother branham the way he
[1:19:00] puts this statement
[1:19:02] all those things are because it's a lack
[1:19:04] of the blood of the lord jesus christ
[1:19:06] you cleanse us
[1:19:07] in other words we don't want to just to
[1:19:09] be forgiven
[1:19:12] we want to be cleansed of it so we can
[1:19:13] walk in the way that god wants us to
[1:19:15] walk
[1:19:18] if we don't he brother bran says if we
[1:19:20] don't belch
[1:19:22] forth the judgments of almighty god
[1:19:25] you're going to be caught one of these
[1:19:27] days in an atomic explosion here
[1:19:30] and will send every soul out into
[1:19:32] eternity to meet god
[1:19:34] who will only recognize the blood of his
[1:19:36] son christ jesus
[1:19:38] i like to see you come under the blood
[1:19:41] my advice to you
[1:19:42] is get right get right with god
[1:19:46] amen in the message what was the holy

[1:22:41] all them old habits and things that
[1:22:43] you're doing yes
[1:22:45] in the message hearing and receiving and
[1:22:47] acting brother ben says
[1:22:49] what we need is a blood transfusion the
[1:22:52] power of the holy ghost to clean up the
[1:22:54] church
[1:22:54] world from the life of sin women men
[1:22:58] professing christianity
[1:22:59] out to dances out to big worldly parties
[1:23:01] gambling smoking dancing
[1:23:03] women cutting their hair wearing short
[1:23:04] slacks all kinds of stuff like that
[1:23:06] and call themselves christians he said
[1:23:08] there's a weakness somewhere
[1:23:11] right it isn't in the power of god
[1:23:15] he said it's either in your pulpit right
[1:23:19] or it's in you
[1:23:23] i don't want to be in the pulpit
[1:23:28] one no that's all there is to it it's
[1:23:32] true
[1:23:33] we need a cleaning up so we need a
[1:23:36] strong pulpit we need these quotes we
[1:23:38] need the word
[1:23:39] we need to hear the truth yeah i know
[1:23:43] that this type of preaching
[1:23:45] does not encourage friendship
[1:23:48] [Laughter]
[1:23:50] it doesn't encourage i like you
[1:23:54] it doesn't encourage i feel comfortable
[1:23:56] in church
[1:23:57] i want to go to that church i know that
[1:24:02] but how can i stand before god
[1:24:08] and not present
[1:24:11] all the truth not declare all the truth
[1:24:14] not say this is
[1:24:15] god's will for our lives
[1:24:20] our relationship with god is more
[1:24:22] important than our relationship with one
[1:24:24] another
[1:24:25] if we don't stand for god then we're
[1:24:28] ashamed of god
[1:24:33] amen and to truly to truly love your
[1:24:37] brother
[1:24:37] to truly love your sister is to truly
[1:24:40] give them the truth
[1:24:41] amen regardless of your friendship with
[1:24:44] them
[1:24:48] truth sets us free amen and the rejected
[1:24:52] king brother ben says i think a man
[1:24:54] ought to be a man and a woman
[1:24:55] ought to be a lady i think that a
[1:24:58] christian ought to act like a christian
[1:25:00] and associate with christians yes
[1:25:03] and the church of the living god ought
[1:25:05] to be together with one heart
[1:25:07] one accord and have nothing to do with
[1:25:09] the world
[1:25:11] and when it comes to their ways and
[1:25:12] their habits
[1:25:15] and the message the uncertain sound
[1:25:16] brother said and someone said to me
[1:25:18] a minister called me up one of the
[1:25:20] sponsors of the following meetings
[1:25:22] uh one of the following meetings in the
[1:25:24] nation
[1:25:26] and said i hear that you preached so
[1:25:29] much against the sisters
[1:25:32] in our church cutting their hair and
[1:25:34] wearing shorts and things so it must
[1:25:36] have been a
[1:25:37] kind of a big denomination
[1:25:41] brother madam says i do
[1:25:45] i said now if you don't want to listen
[1:25:48] to that
[1:25:49] then don't send from me
[1:25:52] aren't you glad that he stood for the
[1:25:54] truth
[1:25:55] amen he didn't care about popularity he
[1:25:58] didn't care who was with him
[1:26:01] if you think about it he is preaching to
[1:26:05] the bride
[1:26:08] bride is the only one that's going to
[1:26:09] listen to him and make it amen
[1:26:12] so what does it matter everybody else
[1:26:16] is their choice they have a choice to to
[1:26:18] believe it's god's word
[1:26:21] or they'll listen to the history of the
[1:26:22] devil that says you know it's not that
[1:26:24] big a thing god still loves me
[1:26:31] and he said do you think they'll ever
[1:26:33] stop it
[1:26:36] and i said no do you believe there ever
[1:26:40] stopped sin
[1:26:41] he said no i said well
[1:26:47] why don't you preach against it then see
[1:26:52] he said what's wrong what's wrong is
[1:26:55] wrong
[1:26:56] somebody's got to breathe out against it
[1:26:58] tell the truth
[1:26:59] amen for when the wrath of god is poured
[1:27:02] out
[1:27:02] then you'll be without excuse
[1:27:06] so just because
[1:27:09] somebody is not going to follow the word
[1:27:12] doesn't mean we shouldn't stop preaching
[1:27:14] it right
[1:27:17] just because there's a a demonic spirit
[1:27:19] or a devil of unbelief that's going to
[1:27:21] sit there and taunt and come to church
[1:27:23] and still act the way that it's it
[1:27:25] doesn't mean we're not
[1:27:26] not going to stand for the truth and
[1:27:28] keep preaching it
[1:27:33] of course the devil hates this message
[1:27:37] he hates it he would just assume us not
[1:27:40] preach church order
[1:27:44] just let you know everybody just be
[1:27:46] happy
[1:27:47] one big family
[1:27:51] in the message believe us though this
[1:27:54] we've got to
[1:28:00] we might make it so that's encouraging
[1:28:02] right
[1:28:04] brother bran says and i walked up there
[1:28:07] and she had on
[1:28:08] enough of this hair manicure on her face
[1:28:13] ever what you call it and her hair was
[1:28:16] all
[1:28:17] fringed out like that and she had
[1:28:20] fingernails
[1:28:21] on the top of hers like that
[1:28:24] and a great big long earrings hanging
[1:28:26] down
[1:28:27] looked like a devil riding on her neck
[1:28:31] and going to use them for stirrups
[1:28:36] i looked out at that and her eyebrows
[1:28:39] way up like this and she turned around
[1:28:41] and said
[1:28:42] and she said are you brother branham
[1:28:45] i said brother
[1:28:50] did you say that was a saint
[1:28:55] he said yes brother branham
[1:28:59] he said she looks more like a haint
[1:29:02] to me instead of a saint
[1:29:07] oh what we need today is a cleaning up
[1:29:10] in the church hallelujah an
[1:29:13] old-fashioned baptism of the holy ghost
[1:29:15] back in the church
[1:29:16] instead of so much of this creed and
[1:29:19] carrying on the way we have it
[1:29:22] walk down on the beach there and they're
[1:29:25] laid
[1:29:25] than women professed to have the holy
[1:29:29] ghost
[1:29:29] right laying out there stretched out
[1:29:32] before men
[1:29:34] in bathing suits hmm brother
[1:29:38] this might make you vomit but let me
[1:29:40] tell you something
[1:29:42] i've got a girl coming on myself i said
[1:29:46] what are you doing lady i said
[1:29:50] isn't your father a minister
[1:29:54] said yes sir i said well
[1:29:57] she said i'm getting a suntan
[1:30:01] i said if my girl ever stretches herself
[1:30:03] out like that she's going to get a
[1:30:05] sun tanning but it's going to be from
[1:30:07] charlie branham's son
[1:30:09] giving her a tan with a barrel slat and
[1:30:12] bring her home
[1:30:15] that's right odd tanner
[1:30:18] how she remember that for a long time
[1:30:20] too going down like that oh
[1:30:22] it's just how they got you let down the
[1:30:26] vowels
[1:30:28] and old methodist preacher was preaching
[1:30:29] that long ago and he sang the song he
[1:30:32] said
[1:30:32] we let down the bars we let down the
[1:30:35] bars i don't know how it goes but
[1:30:37] we compromised with sin we let down the
[1:30:40] bars
[1:30:41] the sheep got out but how did the goats
[1:30:44] get in
[1:30:48] the goats get in if we don't preach it
[1:30:51] amen we've got to preach it you let down
[1:30:54] the bars
[1:30:55] that's what the matter amen don't hear
[1:30:58] that very many amens tonight
[1:31:02] he said but that's the truth amen right
[1:31:05] come back to healing the line
[1:31:07] hallelujah if you want god to return to
[1:31:09] you
[1:31:10] with blessings and things get back to
[1:31:12] the harness again
[1:31:14] preach the gospel stand on it it's
[1:31:16] either right
[1:31:17] or it's wrong if it ain't right forget
[1:31:20] about it
[1:31:21] but god's word is right then just stay
[1:31:24] with it amen
[1:31:25] he says i'm uh ringing you
[1:31:29] i'm twisting you and searching you
[1:31:33] and scratching you but
[1:31:36] it'll fix you up just right
[1:31:40] he says don't worry you worry i love
[1:31:43] that
[1:31:48] if you're leading somebody to the truth
[1:31:50] you don't have to worry about it
[1:31:53] amen let's stand together psalms 30
[1:31:56] verse 4 saying unto the lord always
[1:31:59] saints of his
[1:32:00] and give thanks at the remembrance of
[1:32:03] his holiness
[1:32:05] amen we've heard the call to become holy
[1:32:10] we responded to that call we're walking
[1:32:13] through that door of commitment because
[1:32:15] as god continues to show us
[1:32:17] speaks to our heart we've got to have
[1:32:19] that yearning and that desire to keep
[1:32:21] walking it
[1:32:22] never be satisfied with how holy you are
[1:32:26] never be satisfied with it
[1:32:29] reach forth what god is because you
[1:32:32] are the example to the whole world
[1:32:37] what god is and
[1:32:42] i don't want to be satisfied with
[1:32:44] comparing myself
[1:32:46] with brother mark i love picking up not
[1:32:49] picking up brother mark but using
[1:32:50] brother mark i don't pick on him
[1:32:53] i don't do i brother mark okay
[1:32:57] i thought for a minute i did there but
[1:32:59] if i compare myself with brother mark
[1:33:02] well i'm just as holy as him
[1:33:06] i i wear tie like he does i cut my hair
[1:33:09] like he does
[1:33:11] i don't swear like he don't swear
[1:33:21] but if i compare myself with brother
[1:33:23] mark i'm going to get to a place
[1:33:24] somewhere
[1:33:27] that i'm there
[1:33:30] and my attitude my spirit is going to be
[1:33:32] there
[1:33:34] but if i compare myself with the word
[1:33:39] when it does speak and it's just going
[1:33:41] to be a little talk
[1:33:42] because you know we've been hearing the
[1:33:44] word the word
[1:33:46] for a long time
[1:33:50] but if we don't let it penetrate we
[1:33:52] don't let it deal with us
[1:33:54] it can't do any good right so we've got
[1:33:57] to allow
[1:33:58] the word to challenge us to become more
[1:34:02] holy
[1:34:05] don't ever compare yourself with
[1:34:06] somebody ever ever it is
[1:34:08] unwise compare yourself with the word
[1:34:11] with with the message and
[1:34:13] all these things these quotes that we
[1:34:14] heard these are in brother branham's
[1:34:16] messages just want to say
[1:34:17] get into the message listen to the
[1:34:19] message listen for him speaking
[1:34:22] so often our carnal nature wants to hear
[1:34:25] something that we haven't heard before
[1:34:28] looking for something
[1:34:29] to to benefit us instead of just
[1:34:32] listening for the voice of whatever god
[1:34:34] wants to speak
[1:34:35] amen because there's a lot of things
[1:34:36] that can be spoken out of a message
[1:34:39] but we can get to a place with our
[1:34:41] attitude
[1:34:42] that we turn off our ear to certain
[1:34:44] things
[1:34:46] and that's why jesus said he that has an
[1:34:48] ear to hear we've got to hear
[1:34:49] what the spirit is saying to us the
[1:34:51] church i'm not ready for a rapture i'm
[1:34:53] not holy enough i'm not filled enough
[1:34:55] with god's love
[1:34:56] i don't have enough amen
[1:34:59] so i gotta let this word be my example
[1:35:01] amen
[1:35:04] amen amen let's bow our heart
[1:35:07] amen and a word of prayer heavenly
[1:35:09] father as we come before you today we
[1:35:11] thank you
[1:35:12] that you've provided to us a messenger
[1:35:15] in this hour you sent a message
[1:35:17] for us lord all the churches have this
[1:35:20] book called the bible they may not all
[1:35:25] minister from the king james but there's
[1:35:27] enough scriptures
[1:35:28] that talk about holiness and things and
[1:35:31] the other in the
[1:35:32] other bibles and most other bibles and
[1:35:35] perhaps one that would be read the most
[1:35:37] the niv
[1:35:40] but lord we need
[1:35:43] the interpreter of this word you send
[1:35:46] them
[1:35:46] you sent a messenger that fully
[1:35:49] interpreted this for us in this age
[1:35:52] because you said unto the angel of
[1:35:54] laodicea write these things
[1:35:56] you spoke to him and lord
[1:35:59] he spoke to us
[1:36:03] now lord your prophet said that if we
[1:36:06] had any questions to go back to the
[1:36:08] tapes
