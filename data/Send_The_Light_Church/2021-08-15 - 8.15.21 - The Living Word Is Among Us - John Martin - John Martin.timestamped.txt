[0:02] all things are possible
[0:08] jesus is here
[0:13] jesus is here
[0:15] [Music]
[0:18] jesus is here
[0:22] all things are possible
[0:27] jesus
[0:29] is here
[0:31] [Music]
[0:32] amen
[0:35] that is really the theme of our message
[0:37] this morning
[0:39] jesus is here amen
[0:42] and if we can believe it
[0:44] then we can believe for what he can do
[0:47] but we've got to believe he's here to do
[0:50] the bible says exceedingly above all
[0:52] that we would ask or even think
[0:54] amen will god bless you greet you in the
[0:57] name of the lord jesus
[0:59] we're certainly disappointed for
[1:01] our wife not being able to make it this
[1:03] morning
[1:05] and if we could hold her up in prayer i
[1:08] know you've been praying
[1:10] i know she'd like to be here
[1:13] um also if we can
[1:15] remember brother o'well in a special way
[1:17] this morning
[1:19] sister cynthia said last night that
[1:22] he would not
[1:24] uh do an inter intubation
[1:29] or
[1:30] he would not be resuscitated
[1:33] and the doctors
[1:35] said that that was the next step if his
[1:38] his oxygen didn't go up it was in the
[1:40] 80s again
[1:42] and so they had prayer there
[1:44] but
[1:44] um
[1:47] his view is if if god doesn't
[1:50] do it then it must be his will for me to
[1:54] go on
[1:55] but
[1:56] our brother's been so instrumental in
[1:58] the work of the lord i've just been
[2:00] pleading for more souls and more labors
[2:04] that the lord would not be done with him
[2:06] and
[2:08] i just want to
[2:09] continue praying like that
[2:11] of course we want god's will above
[2:13] everything but
[2:14] god is more than able amen
[2:17] amen let's
[2:18] look to the lord in prayer before we
[2:21] begin reading his word amen heavenly
[2:24] father
[2:25] we just counted a privilege to be back
[2:27] in your house
[2:28] the place that we feel a refuge lord
[2:32] a shelter from the the storms of of of
[2:36] this world and
[2:38] lord
[2:39] uh we've gone through some
[2:41] natural storms here most of us
[2:43] uh but lord we've all been bad on
[2:47] spiritual storms the enemy coming at us
[2:49] from the left from the right
[2:51] lord you promised to raise up a standard
[2:55] against
[2:56] our enemy
[2:58] and lord we believe in your word and we
[3:00] pray that you would do that today we ask
[3:02] that you remember our precious brother
[3:04] rowell
[3:06] lord he stood here behind the sacred
[3:08] desk many times to give us
[3:11] the word of life
[3:13] lord he has stood on foreign
[3:16] ground
[3:17] looking for the
[3:19] seed of god in so many places and
[3:23] lord god we ask that you to raise them
[3:25] up from that bed of affliction
[3:27] lord you've touched many people you're
[3:30] able
[3:31] and
[3:33] lord more than able to do this and we
[3:35] just apply our faith
[3:38] with those around the world for our
[3:40] brother today that you would raise them
[3:42] up and use them for your glory
[3:46] we ask that you be with those that are
[3:47] not with us today
[3:49] lord those
[3:51] that are sick those that are afflicted
[3:52] those for some other reason we just pray
[3:54] that you would be with them and meet
[3:56] their need lord
[3:58] father we asked today lord that as we've
[4:02] assembled ourselves together lord for
[4:04] the purpose
[4:05] of receiving more of you we ask
[4:08] lord that you would prepare our hearts
[4:11] lord for anything that isn't prepared we
[4:13] want thy word to fall on a good ground
[4:15] today
[4:17] lord when we leave here we want to bring
[4:19] forth fruit out in the world lord that
[4:21] the world may see that you're alive
[4:23] yet today the same yesterday today and
[4:25] forever
[4:26] use our vessels lord
[4:29] now we commit the furtherance of this
[4:31] service in your hands and us
[4:33] your blessings on the word this morning
[4:36] for we pray these things in jesus
[4:38] christ's name amen
[4:40] amen turn with me if you would to the
[4:42] book of philippians chapter 1
[4:45] philippians chapter 1. we want to read
[4:46] the first 11 verses there by entitled
[4:49] this message the living word is among us
[4:53] and for a subject remaining
[4:55] confident taking our our text from verse
[4:57] six but let's start with verse number
[4:59] one paul and timotheus the servants of
[5:02] jesus christ to all the saints in christ
[5:06] jesus jesus which are at philippi
[5:09] with the bishops and deacons
[5:11] grace be unto you and peace from god our
[5:14] father and from the lord jesus christ
[5:17] i thank my god upon every remembrance of
[5:20] you
[5:21] always in every prayer of mine for you
[5:24] all making me request with joy
[5:28] for your fellowship in the gospel from
[5:30] the first day
[5:32] until now
[5:34] being confident of this very thing that
[5:36] he which have begun a good work in you
[5:39] will perform it unto the day of jesus
[5:41] christ
[5:42] even as it is meat for me to think this
[5:45] of you all because i have you in my
[5:47] heart in as much as both in my bonds and
[5:50] in the defense and the confirmation of
[5:52] the gospel
[5:53] ye ar you all
[5:56] are partakers
[5:58] of my grace
[5:59] for god is my record how greatly i have
[6:02] longed after you in the bowels of jesus
[6:05] christ and this i pray that your love
[6:08] may abound yet more and more
[6:10] in knowledge and in all judgment
[6:13] that you may approve
[6:15] things that are excellent that ye may be
[6:18] sincere and without offense
[6:21] to the day of jesus christ
[6:23] being filled with the fruits of
[6:25] righteousness
[6:27] which are by jesus christ
[6:29] unto the glory and praise of god god
[6:32] bless you may be seated
[6:37] that word confident
[6:39] means convinced
[6:41] be convinced of this very thing that he
[6:43] which had begun a good work in you will
[6:46] perform it until the day of jesus christ
[6:50] it is very hard to keep our confidence
[6:53] in this
[6:54] hour that we're living the darkest hour
[6:57] that's ever been on the planet evils all
[6:59] around us
[7:01] it's hard to keep our confidence
[7:05] to be honest so many of us have been
[7:06] rattled in one way or another
[7:09] unforeseen things unprecedented things
[7:11] that we've ever seen before
[7:13] horrible things and as the world gets
[7:17] more and more evil
[7:18] it has a negative effect on the church
[7:24] be wrong to say that it didn't but it
[7:26] does
[7:28] it is so bad out there right now jesus
[7:30] said turn with me if you would to
[7:31] matthew chapter 24 he's foretelling of
[7:35] the confusion and the deception that
[7:37] would be in this hour that we're living
[7:38] in
[7:39] he start he starts out here we're
[7:41] starting out in verse 21 he says for
[7:43] then shall be great tribulation such
[7:47] was not since the beginning of the world
[7:50] to this time
[7:53] nor
[7:54] ever shall be
[7:56] that's letting us know we're living in
[7:58] the worst
[8:00] hour
[8:01] there ever was
[8:05] now if i could say it like this
[8:07] the tribulation isn't just natural
[8:14] and he said except those days
[8:17] should be shortened there should no
[8:20] flesh be
[8:21] saved
[8:24] but for the elect say
[8:26] those days shall be shortened
[8:28] think about it even the elect for the
[8:31] elect's sake those days are so bad that
[8:34] they have to be shortened
[8:37] then if any man shall say unto you lo
[8:41] he is cr here's christ or there believe
[8:44] it not
[8:45] for there shall rise false christs and
[8:47] false prophets and shall show great
[8:50] signs and wonders in
[8:52] so much that if it were possible they
[8:55] shall deceive the very elect
[8:58] behold i have told you these things
[9:00] before
[9:01] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[9:05] behold he is in the desert
[9:08] go not forth
[9:10] behold he's in the secret chambers
[9:13] believe it not
[9:16] if you think about even when god called
[9:18] brother branham out
[9:19] to the desert
[9:21] he told the people don't follow me
[9:26] even though god caught him there
[9:28] and god was going to meet in there
[9:33] god doesn't want us to be following
[9:35] people
[9:36] to christ
[9:38] god wants us to believe that christ is
[9:40] with us
[9:44] for as the lightning cometh out of the
[9:45] east and shineth even unto the west so
[9:48] shall also the coming of the son of man
[9:50] be
[9:50] for here it is for wheresoever the
[9:53] carcass is
[9:55] there will the eagles be gathered
[9:57] together
[9:59] we've got to believe the living word is
[10:02] among us
[10:07] now things are pretty bad
[10:09] but if we believe that we are god's
[10:12] elect
[10:14] we should have anything to worry about
[10:18] no matter how bad it gets no matter how
[10:21] hard our trials are no matter what we're
[10:24] going through if we believe we're god's
[10:26] elect everything's going to be okay
[10:29] in fact god is doing something just for
[10:31] us what is he doing he's going to
[10:33] shorten the days
[10:35] just for us
[10:43] it's not about how bad the world is
[10:46] that's true
[10:47] it's about how confident you are
[10:51] it's about remaining
[10:53] confident
[10:54] who you are
[10:56] to the end amen
[10:59] that the living word is among us
[11:02] it hasn't left
[11:04] right now you know we sometimes come in
[11:06] church and we're sitting there and we're
[11:08] waiting to see something
[11:14] you know what you're doing when you do
[11:16] that
[11:17] you're literally saying i didn't bring
[11:19] christ
[11:21] that's what you're saying
[11:25] oh i brought christ i'm looking to see
[11:26] if anyone else got it
[11:28] well why don't you start showing what
[11:29] you got
[11:30] [Music]
[11:34] if there's anything that
[11:37] i believe our church is short on it's
[11:39] giving god the praise that he's worthy
[11:41] to be praised with every time we come
[11:43] together
[11:47] he deserves he's been so good to all of
[11:49] us
[11:51] he's been so faithful
[11:54] and yet we come short of just praising
[11:57] him
[11:58] with just a little bit of time that we
[11:59] have together
[12:02] now i understand we praise him with our
[12:04] life but there should be something
[12:05] happening when we come together as a
[12:07] family
[12:08] kind of word let down our hair and just
[12:10] praise god
[12:13] that's right
[12:14] now when we come to church we must first
[12:16] believe that the living word is among us
[12:20] he promised it
[12:21] first we must believe it then we must
[12:23] recognize him in the word
[12:28] that christ is speaking to us personally
[12:32] not just kind of globally but personally
[12:36] and understand what it is that he is
[12:39] speaking to us
[12:41] what he wants us to do
[12:43] and finally we must follow through with
[12:46] obedience to the word and testify of it
[12:50] and testify and this is really
[12:54] i don't like to use the word routine but
[12:56] this is the routine
[12:59] we don't come to church for a show
[13:01] we don't come to feel good
[13:04] we come to hear from god and we got to
[13:06] believe that god is here and we've got
[13:08] to be able to be in tune with the spirit
[13:10] to receive what he's speaking to us
[13:12] personally and then we got to walk out
[13:14] and obey it
[13:15] amen and then we have fulfilled
[13:18] his will
[13:20] because we're not here to hear a dead
[13:23] letter we're here to hear the living
[13:25] word
[13:26] amen
[13:28] now we're always in a battle
[13:30] and the devil will do everything he can
[13:32] to keep us from what obeying the word
[13:35] he don't care if we listen
[13:38] he don't care if we say amen
[13:39] but he don't want us obeying it that's
[13:42] why we've got to hear it from personally
[13:44] from god and go out and do it
[13:47] bible says we got to put on the whole
[13:48] armor of god
[13:50] cast down imaginations in every high
[13:52] thing that exalteth itself against the
[13:55] knowledge of god and bring into
[13:57] captivity every thought to the
[14:00] obedience if we never follow through and
[14:03] do the obedience what's the use of even
[14:05] bringing the thought into captivity
[14:08] and having in a readiness
[14:11] to revenge all disobedience when when
[14:14] your obedience is fulfilled
[14:17] in one sense
[14:20] in one sense we're all obedient
[14:24] right
[14:25] to what god
[14:26] has spoken to us to do and we've done it
[14:28] in another sense we're all disobedient
[14:31] to what we haven't done that he's asked
[14:33] us to do and yet we come let's say we
[14:36] come to church perfect
[14:38] perfectly obedient well he has a new
[14:40] word for us
[14:43] and this is the way that we need to feel
[14:45] we need to feel that we're going to hear
[14:47] instructions from god we're going to
[14:49] hear what he wants us to do so we better
[14:51] pay attention
[14:53] if we went to school or college or
[14:55] whatever it was and the first thing the
[14:57] teacher said when he got up is we're
[14:59] going to have a quiz at the end of the
[15:01] service today and it's going to be half
[15:02] of your grade
[15:04] i am telling you we wouldn't be sitting
[15:06] around trying to enjoy what kind of joke
[15:08] he's going to be saying today or or
[15:10] maybe we'll just catch up on it later
[15:13] this week we'd be paying attention to
[15:15] what's being said and if the living word
[15:17] is amongst us we need to be hearing what
[15:19] he's saying to us personally because it
[15:21] doesn't matter what he's saying to this
[15:22] brother or this sister it matters to
[15:24] what he's saying to you
[15:26] amen
[15:29] we must believe the living word is among
[15:31] us we must identify what it is he's
[15:34] saying to us personally and we must
[15:36] follow through
[15:38] when we leave here to obey what he said
[15:41] now that's a big thing
[15:44] that's a that's a big scope but that's
[15:46] the reality of a relationship with jesus
[15:48] christ
[15:50] now if we don't do that there's a
[15:52] disconnect somewhere a disconnect
[15:56] now you all know what a disconnect is
[15:57] brother router can tell you what a
[15:59] disconnect is
[16:00] you can have everything hooked up to
[16:02] your air conditioner
[16:05] but if the disconnect is turned off
[16:08] it won't allow the power to go through
[16:14] and if there's a disconnect somewhere
[16:17] in this formality or this formula of
[16:20] believing god's here
[16:22] that he's speaking to us personally we
[16:25] can identify exactly what it is that he
[16:27] said to us personally i don't know what
[16:29] he said to my brother sin i don't know
[16:30] what he he said to my brother james but
[16:32] i know what he said to me
[16:35] and i'm going to follow through with it
[16:38] if that doesn't happen there's a
[16:39] disconnect somewhere
[16:44] each and every time we come to church we
[16:46] must have confidence that the living
[16:48] word is amongst us we have gotten to a
[16:51] place where we have just questioned and
[16:54] doubted
[16:55] it's true
[17:02] but we need to build it back up
[17:06] because god promised never to leave us
[17:08] never to forsake us
[17:10] our confidence must remain into the
[17:12] rapture
[17:14] hebrews chapter 3 verse 14 says for we
[17:17] are made partakers of christ if we hold
[17:21] the beginning of our confidence stead
[17:25] fast unto the end
[17:28] amen god doesn't give us any
[17:31] loopholes here
[17:35] we can't just say i'm made partaker of
[17:37] christ because i repented and i got
[17:39] baptized right
[17:41] how many times have we had thoughts of
[17:43] throwing in the towel now we've all had
[17:45] them we've all had them
[17:48] it's true
[17:51] but that doesn't make me a partaker of
[17:53] christ if i throw in the towel
[17:56] in my mind the devil wants me to think
[17:58] that
[18:00] but that's not what god wants me to
[18:01] think he wants me to hold the beginning
[18:04] of our confidence steadfast right to the
[18:06] end amen
[18:08] being confident of this very thing he
[18:09] which had begun a good work in you will
[18:12] perform it until the day of jesus christ
[18:16] we must remain confident yes to the very
[18:20] end
[18:23] the living word is amongst us amen
[18:26] i'll say it like this the living word
[18:28] is with you with every situation in your
[18:31] personal life
[18:34] come on now i just want you to focus on
[18:36] this because what good is the word if
[18:37] they can't help our personal lives
[18:42] the living word is amongst us in every
[18:45] rotten situation of our life
[18:50] it's there for a reason it's to help us
[18:55] how many times uh something bad goes
[18:57] wrong and
[18:58] and the devil says well
[19:00] he must have forsaken you
[19:02] he must have just wrote you off
[19:06] too often we lose our confidence in god
[19:09] because sometimes unknowingly
[19:12] we put our confidence in some other
[19:14] thing than god's word
[19:17] or
[19:19] we get our eyes on some person
[19:22] and they let us down
[19:25] leaving us disappointed discouraged
[19:29] or really not knowing who to believe in
[19:33] what to believe
[19:38] we must always remember when this
[19:40] happens god has never let you down amen
[19:46] amen god has never failed amen
[19:50] other human beings fail us
[19:52] and they always will
[19:54] we need to get over it
[19:56] because i'll say it like this you have
[19:58] failed right
[20:01] you have failed me
[20:03] you have failed your employer
[20:07] you have failed your neighbor you have
[20:08] failed your spouse
[20:11] you have failed god yet you're going to
[20:13] hold another human being up for not
[20:15] being able to fail
[20:18] what is that
[20:28] but it doesn't have anything to do
[20:29] because god still among us
[20:34] the problem is when you start looking at
[20:36] one another's faults and problems before
[20:38] you you begin to
[20:40] judge and question
[20:44] god is allowed to be among us when
[20:47] there's human problems
[20:52] human problems doesn't mean god's not
[20:54] among
[21:00] us we don't realize but when we put too
[21:03] much confidence on other people
[21:05] and not enough in god
[21:12] you know god wants humans
[21:15] to fail you when you put too much
[21:16] confidence in them
[21:18] we're never to put confidence in a human
[21:21] being
[21:24] above what they are
[21:26] and they're a human being
[21:30] but john you know and this is this is
[21:32] this isn't just for the you know the
[21:34] preachers or for those who who are uh
[21:37] spiritual in the church or who we look
[21:39] up to
[21:41] but understand everybody has the
[21:43] tendency
[21:44] of holding someone else accountable
[21:48] and i don't care if it's the waitress
[21:51] the person at the drive-through
[21:54] a doctor
[21:56] oh i'm paying that doctor i mean sure
[21:58] you better tell me the truth
[22:00] you better tell me like it is
[22:03] you better not fail you better not lie
[22:07] lawyers
[22:08] judges
[22:10] they've all been bought off
[22:12] not all of them but they just because
[22:14] they hold that title
[22:18] we live in a world of humanity
[22:24] so we don't look to one another
[22:27] as if
[22:28] they need to be perfect they don't
[22:32] in your sight they don't
[22:38] but we need to get our confidence in god
[22:42] his living word is among us not a dead
[22:46] letter
[22:49] just because someone is elect doesn't
[22:51] mean that they're not going to let you
[22:53] down
[22:56] psalms 118 verse 8 says it's better to
[22:58] trust the lord than to put confidence in
[23:01] man now that's the middle verse in the
[23:03] whole bible
[23:05] well to stay with it stay right down the
[23:07] middle of the road
[23:11] that's good
[23:15] turn with me if you would to second
[23:16] timothy chapter three
[23:19] paul adding to the end time prophecy of
[23:21] of the confusion this hour and the
[23:23] deception
[23:24] in this last age he says in verse number
[23:26] one
[23:27] know
[23:28] this also that
[23:30] this know also in the last days perilous
[23:33] times shall come for eventually lovers
[23:35] of their own self covetous bolsters
[23:38] prowl blasphemers disobedient
[23:41] to parents unthankful unholy without
[23:43] natural affection truth breakers false
[23:45] accusers incontinence fears despisers of
[23:48] those that are good traitors heady
[23:50] high-minded lovers of pleasure more than
[23:52] lovers of god now this is in the church
[23:54] and and we all know these verses and i'm
[23:56] going through them quickly but this is
[24:00] who we rub shoulders with
[24:03] now it shouldn't be
[24:05] among us
[24:06] but it is right
[24:12] but just because that's here doesn't
[24:14] mean the living word is not here
[24:18] this is not a message to discourage us
[24:20] because of the humanity that we have to
[24:22] deal with this is a message to encourage
[24:24] you that no matter what humanity is with
[24:26] us no matter what problem is with us the
[24:29] living word is still here to see us
[24:31] through
[24:37] now look they're having a form of
[24:39] godliness
[24:41] that they're denying the power thereof
[24:45] from such turn away
[24:48] paul
[24:49] is warning us
[24:51] to stay away from fellowship that
[24:54] compromises with full power
[24:57] think about that
[25:00] he doesn't want us to have fellowship
[25:01] with just someone who believes in a
[25:03] little bit of power
[25:06] this is a serious thing
[25:08] this is calling us for total separation
[25:11] from unbelief
[25:15] because why what happens when you hang
[25:17] around somebody who's halfway in right
[25:20] it's good
[25:27] you begin to compromise
[25:31] you know the devil does it he says well
[25:34] you're better than them
[25:36] you're further along than them
[25:39] you don't have to worry go do what you
[25:41] want to do
[25:46] now think about this is so strange to me
[25:48] but instead of spending more time in
[25:50] prayer seeking the power of the holy
[25:52] ghost believers want to spend more time
[25:55] learning
[25:59] verse 7 ever learning and never able to
[26:02] come to the knowledge of the truth the
[26:05] knowledge of the truth is you shall
[26:07] receive power after the holy ghost has
[26:09] come upon you
[26:13] you're not going to get power by
[26:14] learning more
[26:16] learning doesn't bring the power of god
[26:19] now in the world they'll tell you power
[26:20] is knowledge
[26:22] but i'm here to tell you the holy ghost
[26:23] is power
[26:25] the living word is what brings power
[26:28] it's alive
[26:29] [Music]
[26:31] we know the written word here we're
[26:33] reading we're talking about it we're
[26:35] hearing it but what we're looking for
[26:37] we're looking for that living word to
[26:39] come right here and live inside of us
[26:43] verse 10
[26:46] but thou is fully known my doctrine my
[26:48] manner of life my purpose long suffering
[26:50] charity my faith my patience
[26:52] persecutions afflictions
[26:55] which came up to me at antioch iconium
[26:57] lystra what persecutions i endured
[27:00] but out of them all the lord delivered
[27:02] me
[27:03] proving the lord was with him the living
[27:06] word was among them
[27:08] yea and all that will live godly in
[27:10] christ jesus are going to suffer the
[27:12] same type of persecutions
[27:17] and evil men
[27:18] seducers shall wax worse and worse
[27:22] deceiving and being deceived
[27:26] here's the verse i want to get to
[27:28] but continue down the things which thou
[27:31] has learned
[27:32] and has been assured of
[27:35] knowing of whom those learn
[27:38] them now god wants us to keep our
[27:41] confidence to the end amen
[27:43] continue in the word continue doing what
[27:46] the word tells you to do
[27:50] i mean there might have been a time in
[27:52] your life that god said you need to hang
[27:54] the ten commandments in your room in
[27:55] your house
[27:58] but i'm telling you he's probably not
[27:59] telling you that today
[28:02] he's telling you to move on
[28:05] no matter what he has told you in the
[28:07] past
[28:08] he's asking you to move on
[28:12] continue in this process with christ
[28:18] you know what happens when we get so
[28:19] carnal in the flesh
[28:22] i don't care what the problem is in life
[28:24] i don't care what you're looking for i
[28:25] don't care what your hang-ups are what
[28:27] you're going through if we get so carnal
[28:30] in the flesh that the only way we can
[28:32] receive of god is he better preach that
[28:34] one scripture give that one quote then
[28:36] oh no
[28:40] like you're going to put god in a box
[28:42] like you're going to tell god what to do
[28:44] right i'm praying i'm praying for
[28:47] you know for brother rowell i says god i
[28:49] can't tell you what your will is
[28:52] i can only bring forth my strong
[28:54] reasoning bring forth my just cause
[28:58] god is god he's here to do
[29:01] more than what we would ask or even
[29:03] think
[29:04] but we got to get in tune with the
[29:06] living word
[29:07] [Music]
[29:10] the living word
[29:14] paul is telling timothy and god is
[29:16] telling us to be assured
[29:19] the living word is among us
[29:21] continue in the things that thou has
[29:24] learned
[29:25] being assured that god is the one that
[29:28] taught them to you
[29:29] amen
[29:32] it wasn't some theology it wasn't some
[29:35] man
[29:37] it was god in the men
[29:39] the fightful ministry
[29:41] the living word is among us
[29:45] saints it's time to start beefing up our
[29:47] confidence in god again
[29:51] he's never failed one time he's got a
[29:53] perfect record in heaven
[29:56] we need to stop putting our confidence
[29:58] in man and start trusting the lord more
[30:02] just start trusting him
[30:08] when i say we got to stop putting our
[30:10] confidence in man i'm talking about one
[30:12] another
[30:18] the more you look to the flesh
[30:20] the less you're going to look to god
[30:21] that's true
[30:22] not saying god don't use one another
[30:26] but what i am saying is you need to be
[30:27] looking to god
[30:31] there is no mediator between god and man
[30:33] except the man christ jesus
[30:39] peter
[30:40] turn with me to second peter chapter 3
[30:42] please peter wanting to stir up
[30:44] what we've already been taught
[30:47] in the word
[30:53] we're facing a lot of spirits today
[30:59] this
[31:00] second epistle beloved
[31:03] i now write unto you in both which i
[31:05] stir up your pure minds by way of
[31:06] remembrance
[31:08] that you be mindful of the words which
[31:09] are spoken before by the holy prophets
[31:11] and the commandment
[31:13] of us
[31:14] the apostles of our lord and savior
[31:16] knowing this first that there shall come
[31:18] in the last days scoffers
[31:21] scoffers
[31:23] okay now notice
[31:26] their true intent their true motive
[31:29] is to walk after their own desires
[31:32] they have no interest
[31:34] for souls
[31:36] no interest in living for one another
[31:41] it's their own
[31:45] and when you try to tell them what they
[31:47] need to do they scoff
[31:52] and saying where is the promise of his
[31:55] coming now i just want to ask you a
[31:56] question how many of you have asked that
[31:59] in the last
[32:02] six months
[32:09] should have been here by now why are we
[32:10] going through this what's going to
[32:12] happen
[32:16] for since the fathers fell asleep since
[32:18] brother brown all things continue as
[32:20] they were from the beginning of the
[32:22] creation
[32:24] for this they willingly are ignorant
[32:27] of that by the word of god and the
[32:29] heavens were of old and the earth
[32:30] standing out of the water and in the
[32:32] water were
[32:33] whereby
[32:35] the world that then was being overthrown
[32:38] with water perished
[32:41] but the heavens and earth which are now
[32:43] by the same word are kept in store
[32:45] reserved again unto the fire against the
[32:48] day of judgment
[32:50] and perdition of ungodly men
[32:54] but beloved be nothing you know this one
[32:57] thing
[32:59] that one day
[33:00] is with the lord is a thousand years and
[33:03] a thousand years is one day
[33:05] the lord is not
[33:07] slack
[33:10] concerning his promise
[33:14] the more and more i go on the more and
[33:17] more i see there's only one will that's
[33:20] going to last and it's god's will
[33:24] everything satan started everything man
[33:27] started it's going to come to an end
[33:31] god's will is the only will that matters
[33:36] the lord is not slack concerning his
[33:37] promise as some man counts sackness
[33:42] but is long-suffering to us we're not
[33:44] willing that any should perish but that
[33:46] all should come to repentance i just
[33:49] wonder
[33:51] if there's someone
[33:53] who hasn't come to repentance yet
[33:57] he doesn't want them
[33:59] to miss it
[34:00] he's being long-suffering
[34:03] he's waiting for them to repent whoever
[34:05] they are wherever they're at
[34:07] and here we are
[34:09] not helping him
[34:12] not helping the father with his eternal
[34:14] purpose reaching out because we're so
[34:17] caught up in our own world
[34:20] i know you don't want to hear that
[34:23] but we need to get
[34:25] building amen with god
[34:29] because it's the only will that matters
[34:35] but the day of the lord will come as a
[34:37] thief in the night
[34:38] in which the heavens shall pass away
[34:41] with great noise and the elements shall
[34:43] melt with fervent heap the earth also
[34:46] with the works that are therein shall be
[34:48] burned up
[34:50] there's not a whole lot of hope left for
[34:52] the world is there
[34:54] seeing them that all these things shall
[34:56] be dissolved
[34:58] what manner of persons ought ye to be
[35:02] think about this knowing that the world
[35:05] at any moment is going to be annihilated
[35:08] what person should we be
[35:13] that's what the word is asking us
[35:16] now we can't just answer
[35:19] i ought to be what i am
[35:23] we ought to be answering i need to do
[35:25] this instead of that
[35:31] in all holy conversation that's the life
[35:34] that we live ungodliness now coming with
[35:37] that godliness is going to suffer
[35:39] persecution
[35:42] looking for and hasting until the coming
[35:44] of the day of god
[35:46] wherein the heavens being on fire shall
[35:48] be dissolved
[35:49] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[35:51] heat nevertheless we look we according
[35:54] to his promise
[35:56] look for new heavens and a new earth
[35:59] wherein dwelleth righteousness
[36:03] keeping our eyes on the prize amen
[36:10] god wants our confidence to re remain
[36:12] intact
[36:17] he's not slack
[36:19] he's if there's anything that seems to
[36:22] be out of place it's me not looking for
[36:24] a soul
[36:25] it's me not looking for a soul that
[36:27] that's what's out of place because god's
[36:29] program is moving forward
[36:33] now i got to thinking you know what what
[36:35] happened with brother rowell died i mean
[36:37] he's run his race he has won souls he's
[36:39] got jews in this ground
[36:42] what about me
[36:44] what about me
[36:46] friends what about you
[36:48] i know we're a small church and we don't
[36:50] got the biggest orchestra
[36:52] we don't get the best preacher we know
[36:54] that
[36:56] but we the living word is among us
[36:58] his word has gotten across to us
[37:02] he's looking for somebody to bite into
[37:04] it and start living it
[37:10] after jesus left the scene a couple of
[37:12] his christian brothers were walking on
[37:15] the road to mass we all know the story
[37:18] jesus was now gone and they were left
[37:21] alone
[37:22] and one of the brothers named claphaus
[37:25] said these words he said but we
[37:28] trusted
[37:30] that it had been he which should have
[37:32] redeemed israel and besides all this
[37:35] today is the third day
[37:37] since these things were done
[37:40] now notice
[37:41] his word was trusted
[37:44] we trusted
[37:48] they didn't continue to be trusting
[37:52] their trust wasn't remaining
[37:55] they were doubting
[37:57] and this is what bothered jesus
[38:01] i know jesus is here but is he bothered
[38:07] we can say we trusted but are we living
[38:10] are we trusting are we with the living
[38:13] word today
[38:20] they should have been trusting
[38:22] because the living word was right
[38:24] amongst them
[38:26] and they didn't know it
[38:31] now even though
[38:32] we don't
[38:34] see
[38:35] we don't always feel the presence of god
[38:39] these natural senses
[38:41] don't declare that the living word is
[38:43] here
[38:46] but by faith
[38:49] supernaturally
[38:51] we believe that he is here
[38:54] and the more that you can enter into
[38:56] that
[38:57] faith that belief entered into the word
[39:00] hungry thirsty god i want you god i'm
[39:02] needing you
[39:03] the more god will make himself known to
[39:06] you
[39:07] but the more you come just looking for
[39:09] some information looking for this
[39:11] looking for that
[39:13] and not looking for him
[39:21] i understand that you've trusted
[39:23] but are you trusting
[39:27] what counts is that you're walking by
[39:29] faith in the supernatural
[39:31] and not by sight in the natural
[39:35] amen
[39:37] we're spiritual beings in a natural body
[39:42] we're trapped
[39:43] in these natural bodies but we can start
[39:46] activating acting like we believe the
[39:49] living word is here
[39:52] you know you go in a restaurant i can
[39:54] see you just sitting there kind of like
[39:56] you know whatever when's the waitress
[39:57] gonna get in
[39:59] but this is church
[40:02] this is a place where he is here
[40:05] there's no question about it
[40:10] why are we worshiping that living word
[40:13] he that living word wants to be
[40:15] worshipped
[40:17] and it should be
[40:19] because he is the same yesterday today
[40:21] and forever
[40:22] i believe sometimes we're just not we're
[40:24] not catching the living word
[40:26] we're too much in the natural we hearing
[40:29] natural things trying to understand
[40:31] naturally and carnally
[40:33] when we don't pray enough to enter into
[40:34] the spirit of the living god
[40:44] these disciples were greatly troubled
[40:47] that the living word was leaving them
[40:51] for the rest of their earthly life
[40:57] they were bothered about it
[41:01] they were going to have to find some
[41:03] other way
[41:06] to get help
[41:08] and that's what was bothering them
[41:10] and jesus
[41:12] tried comforting them hey look i'm going
[41:14] to come back i'm going to be right
[41:15] inside of you
[41:18] so don't you worry
[41:20] but why is it today
[41:23] that we get away from the god that lives
[41:26] inside of us and we're looking for god
[41:28] and somebody else to help us
[41:33] we're losing our relationship with god
[41:37] we're losing the purpose of why he said
[41:40] i will come and be with you even in you
[41:43] amen
[41:45] he's wanting he's jealous and he wants
[41:48] us to look to him whether god uses
[41:50] somebody that's up to god it ain't up to
[41:52] you don't be looking to somebody else to
[41:54] get help
[41:59] start building your relationship with
[42:01] god spend more time on your knees get in
[42:03] that prayer closet god said if you seek
[42:06] me i will reward you openly
[42:16] did it ever occur to you that god is
[42:18] wanting you to seek him inside of you
[42:24] he's inside and he wants to seek
[42:27] he wants you to seek him inside of you
[42:31] therefore i don't need to talk to this
[42:33] brother i don't need to talk to this
[42:35] sister
[42:38] i just need to get on my knees and
[42:40] believe the living word is among us
[42:48] jesus didn't
[42:50] come to
[42:52] save his bride and just leave his bride
[42:54] alone
[42:57] no he's among us amen he said i'll never
[43:00] leave her
[43:01] amen saint john 14 verse 18 i will not
[43:05] leave you comfortless i will come to you
[43:09] yet a little while the world sees me no
[43:11] more but you shall see me because i live
[43:13] ye shall live also now you come to
[43:15] church
[43:17] now we know the world don't see christ
[43:21] they don't even see their own agenda
[43:23] or their own
[43:24] their own
[43:26] gender
[43:36] we come to church
[43:38] we should be seeing jesus
[43:42] because he promised you'll see me
[43:44] the world's not going to see me but
[43:45] you're going to see me well i'm not
[43:47] seeing them the way i want okay okay i
[43:49] understand
[43:50] but what are you going to do about it
[43:53] are you going to sit there and wait for
[43:55] something to make you feel better
[43:58] to say you see
[44:00] or you're going to get serious and spend
[44:02] more time preparing
[44:08] because even god himself said you shall
[44:11] seat me and find me when you search for
[44:12] me with all your heart god is interested
[44:14] in all your heart
[44:16] well he's got it does he
[44:19] does he our hearts deceptive above
[44:21] everything
[44:22] how do we know
[44:23] every man's arrogant and his own eyes
[44:28] right in his own eyes
[44:30] the humble that he gives grace to
[44:38] jesus
[44:39] was telling them that he was going to be
[44:40] among them not to worry
[44:44] now i can't see god for you
[44:46] you can't see god for me
[44:49] i can't believe for you and you can't
[44:51] believe for me
[44:55] i'm not saying that you can't pray for
[44:57] me and i can't get healed that's not
[44:58] what i'm saying
[45:00] but i'm saying when it comes to a
[45:01] relationship with jesus christ it's a
[45:03] personal relationship
[45:06] we don't make it on anybody else's shirt
[45:08] tale
[45:11] it's time for the bride to
[45:13] to get strong again
[45:17] we've got to start taking the land that
[45:18] belongs to us
[45:22] matthew recorded their last service
[45:24] together in matthew 28 verse 17.
[45:28] this is the last service they had
[45:31] and when they saw him what'd they do
[45:33] they worshipped him yes i wonder why we
[45:35] come to church we don't worship like we
[45:37] should
[45:38] i think it's because we don't see him
[45:42] because if you saw him
[45:44] literally with your eyes you would
[45:46] worship more
[45:51] and it's okay we don't see him with our
[45:53] natural eyes
[45:55] but something in hot here should say i
[45:57] know he's here i know he's here he's
[45:59] among us he promised to be
[46:02] i'm hungering for that living word i
[46:05] will worship him i will praise him i
[46:07] will exalt him for he is worthy
[46:12] well brother john it's it's just i'm not
[46:14] used to this type of stuff i understand
[46:16] your flesh never will be
[46:22] but god is calling to your soul
[46:28] when god said seek
[46:29] my face my
[46:31] soul my heart said unto him thy face
[46:34] will i seek
[46:37] god ain't calling to our flesh
[46:39] if there's anything about our flesh he
[46:40] wants it crucified
[46:43] but something inside of us needs to be
[46:45] worshipping him
[46:46] and when they saw him they worshipped
[46:48] him but what some
[46:50] sat in church and doubted
[46:54] and they came and they spake on him
[46:56] saying
[46:57] and jesus came and spake unto them
[46:59] saying all power is given unto me in
[47:01] heaven and earth
[47:03] i want you to go therefore
[47:05] and teach
[47:06] everybody
[47:08] every place you go all nations all
[47:11] cities
[47:12] all towns
[47:16] baptize them
[47:18] oh brother john i never baptize anybody
[47:20] you got scripture right here
[47:22] you got a scripture
[47:24] to baptize them
[47:26] you don't need to be a preacher to
[47:27] baptize somebody
[47:29] baptizing them in the name of the father
[47:31] and of the son and of the holy ghost and
[47:33] please
[47:34] make sure it's the name
[47:37] not the titles
[47:39] teaching them to observe all things
[47:42] whatsoever i've commanded you
[47:45] now
[47:46] you've been paying attention long enough
[47:48] the last 10 years there should be a lot
[47:49] of things god commanded you to do
[47:53] and god wants you to teach them
[47:57] to observe all things whatsoever i've
[47:59] commanded you and lo i am with you
[48:02] always even to the end of the world the
[48:06] living word is amongst us not the he
[48:08] didn't sound and leave you a book
[48:11] i'm going to leave you a book with some
[48:13] words that i spoke in the past
[48:16] no the living word amen
[48:20] don't take no thought what you'll think
[48:22] what you'll say for the holy spirit will
[48:24] give you honor answer in a moment
[48:28] because it's a living word
[48:37] it's okay that our physical senses don't
[48:39] declare him here i don't care about them
[48:42] anyways they do nothing but get me in
[48:44] trouble
[48:46] they make me look at wrong things they
[48:48] maybe think wrong things
[48:50] imagine wrong things hear wrong things
[48:54] lost wrong things
[48:57] i'm interested in the living god for my
[48:59] soul
[49:01] there's no perfection to this flesh
[49:04] no flesh will glory in his presence it
[49:06] can't even enter the kingdom of heaven
[49:08] he doesn't want nothing to do with it it
[49:10] was a perverted birth to begin with we
[49:12] got a new body waiting us
[49:21] [Music]
[49:28] we need to get our eyes off of one
[49:30] another
[49:31] get our eyes on christ
[49:34] don't just look
[49:36] to jesus as the author
[49:39] who started for you
[49:41] got baptized told you you were a sinner
[49:44] but look to him to finish it
[49:46] he's the finisher of our faith
[49:51] how is he going to get you there
[49:53] he's going to get you there by telling
[49:55] by doing what he tells you to do today
[50:00] not don't wait till tomorrow right
[50:02] i'm on how many times we come to church
[50:04] and we missed
[50:06] what god was trying to speak to us
[50:09] because our heart wasn't there our mind
[50:11] wasn't there our interest wasn't there
[50:13] and we didn't believe the living word
[50:15] was amongst us we thought it was some
[50:17] dead letter we throw some man up there
[50:19] trying to tell us what to do
[50:22] trying to tell us what to live trying to
[50:24] tell us the bible trying to tell us this
[50:26] thought no
[50:30] no that's from the devil
[50:33] that's because we're coming to church
[50:34] all carnal
[50:36] service after service after service and
[50:39] trying to build ourselves up in what
[50:41] right
[50:43] we should be building ourselves up in
[50:45] the most holy faith
[50:48] revelation
[50:51] upon this rock i'll build my church
[50:54] a living rock when you get a revelation
[50:57] that's alive brother that's a live
[50:59] sister
[51:01] a dead letter can't build anything
[51:05] that kills it
[51:06] destroys it it's a
[51:09] knowledge is against this revelation of
[51:11] god's word
[51:17] oh god stermi
[51:20] we need to remain confident of this very
[51:22] thing that he which have begun a good
[51:24] work in you will
[51:26] perform it
[51:28] when's he going to do it
[51:30] what am i going to see in the church
[51:31] when's he going to do it when am i going
[51:32] to
[51:33] perform
[51:35] it until he's doing it every time you
[51:38] come to service brother he's doing it
[51:40] every time you come to service sister
[51:43] he's performing it
[51:46] well i'm just not catching it
[51:58] god came down
[52:00] to our level
[52:02] to die for sin
[52:05] but now he's called every one of us to
[52:07] repent mean come up to him
[52:10] to get seated in heavenly places
[52:13] to die out to meet him
[52:15] in a realm a spiritual realm where he
[52:18] speaks to his bride he makes known to
[52:20] his bride what to do
[52:23] amen
[52:27] well i'm just not quite hearing it
[52:32] all the more
[52:33] we should be spending more time with god
[52:36] amen that's right
[52:38] until you get to hear that voice learn
[52:40] that voice
[52:41] it's not a matter of getting a better
[52:43] preaching
[52:47] it's not even a matter of getting a
[52:49] better atmosphere in this building
[52:52] it's about your
[52:54] heart getting a better atmosphere your
[52:56] mind getting a better atmosphere amen
[52:59] because god isn't
[53:01] in this and in this
[53:03] and in this
[53:05] god said i'm in this
[53:08] i'm in this heart right here
[53:10] that's where you'll meet me
[53:13] no
[53:15] so when you get on your knees to pray
[53:18] you're looking to meet the god inside of
[53:20] you
[53:21] he's among us
[53:23] hopefully i don't feel him stay there
[53:26] stay there he'll come
[53:29] how many met him this morning
[53:32] you know his presence was there before i
[53:35] got to church i was weeping in the car
[53:38] before i got here
[53:39] [Music]
[53:41] couldn't help it couldn't help it was
[53:43] not hard for me to pray when i got to
[53:45] church
[53:46] because i prayed this morning
[53:49] amen
[53:53] all of heaven is behind us making a
[53:55] rapture
[53:57] in fact heaven has put out a special
[54:00] tactic
[54:01] just to make sure
[54:05] he gets accomplished
[54:07] john chapter 5 verse 17 let's take a
[54:09] look at this tag team
[54:13] but jesus answered them and he said my
[54:16] father
[54:18] worketh hitherto
[54:20] and i work
[54:21] there's a tandem team
[54:23] they're working together they're both
[54:25] working together
[54:27] john chapter 4 verse 34 jesus saith unto
[54:29] them my meat is to do the work of him
[54:32] that sent me and to what finish his work
[54:37] he's going to execute he's going to
[54:39] perform what he started in you
[54:42] that's what he's working here
[54:45] we all think about god working miracles
[54:47] and praying some for somebody over the
[54:49] service or or they jump and they shout
[54:51] oh wait there's god working no god's
[54:53] working in you too
[54:56] just let go let god have his wonderful
[54:58] way let him have his way stop saying no
[55:00] i don't want you to do that get your
[55:01] hands off of me get your hands off my
[55:03] heart don't you be telling me let him
[55:05] work in you
[55:08] the bible says it's his good pleasure to
[55:10] work in you
[55:14] don't be stubborn
[55:20] just remain confident
[55:22] it's the living word
[55:24] oh to be able to feel
[55:26] him
[55:28] speak to you
[55:32] you're
[55:32] blessed when you feel that
[55:40] brother john what do i do
[55:43] a lot of people are saying things that
[55:45] are wrong
[55:47] just remain confident
[55:49] doesn't matter what they say
[55:52] the living word is still here in the
[55:53] midst of all the
[55:55] confusion
[55:57] some are saying here's christ look at me
[56:02] some are saying there is christ
[56:04] go there
[56:09] you don't have to go chasing christ in
[56:11] another direction
[56:14] because that ain't the type of god that
[56:16] we serve
[56:18] don't matter if you're on an island
[56:20] it don't matter where you're at the
[56:22] living word is amongst us
[56:25] if you believe
[56:28] how many times have you felt in your
[56:31] heart
[56:33] when you're away from this church and
[56:36] you're driving or you're at home or
[56:38] something and you feel
[56:40] oh god's with me how many's ever felt
[56:42] that
[56:45] and you just knew it yeah yeah
[56:47] how many times did you come to church
[56:49] and wonder where god was at
[56:56] what's going on what's going on
[56:59] because you start
[57:01] put other things in
[57:04] in there to make you have to prove that
[57:06] god is here
[57:09] why can't the god that was with you
[57:11] alone be with you here
[57:14] what about that
[57:16] well i got all these obstacles all these
[57:18] people they're bothering me all these
[57:19] spirits you know what get your eyes on
[57:21] jesus
[57:22] because he's going to prepare a table in
[57:24] the presence of your enemies
[57:25] [Music]
[57:27] the living word is among us
[57:30] it's about us believing it enough to tap
[57:32] into it and say amen to every word of
[57:35] god
[57:40] luke chapter 17
[57:43] you don't have to go chasing christ in
[57:45] another direction
[57:47] friends he is here yes he is among us
[57:50] he said i will never leave you i will
[57:52] never forsake you
[57:56] luke chapter 17 verse 22
[57:59] and he said unto his disciples the days
[58:01] will come
[58:02] when ye shall
[58:03] desire to see
[58:05] one of the days of the son of man you
[58:06] shall not see it
[58:09] and they shall say unto you see here
[58:12] or see there
[58:13] go not after them
[58:16] nor follow them
[58:18] why not
[58:20] why not
[58:21] because the the kingdom of god cometh
[58:23] not with observation
[58:27] you notice
[58:28] when when you hear about some
[58:32] amazing thing that happened
[58:36] catches your attention that you like so
[58:38] much about it
[58:39] is the outward appearance of the
[58:41] manifestation
[58:45] where we should be looking for the
[58:47] nature change
[58:49] something that isn't you seen
[58:52] outwardly
[58:54] the testimony happens inside yes it will
[58:56] become manifested eventually yes
[59:02] but the kingdom of god jesus says within
[59:04] you the living word is within us
[59:08] well i don't feel it
[59:11] hunger
[59:13] thirst for more
[59:14] you know if you give god a little bit of
[59:16] your time
[59:17] don't expect god to give you the word
[59:24] you give god your peanuts
[59:26] your pennies
[59:29] sometimes we don't give an offering
[59:35] you come to church without an offering
[59:38] sometimes it's physical
[59:40] monetarily
[59:41] and sometimes it's spiritual
[59:46] but he's worthy
[59:48] of an offering
[59:51] even kane
[59:53] gave it offering right
[59:55] wasn't right but he gave one right
[59:58] and when we don't give an offering we're
[1:00:00] putting ourselves a little bit lower
[1:00:02] than cain right right
[1:00:06] right
[1:00:11] god knows my heart he certainly does and
[1:00:13] he's telling you to give offering
[1:00:16] and give it cheerfully
[1:00:18] praise them cheerfully
[1:00:20] not just because the song leader says
[1:00:21] let's praise the lord right now do it
[1:00:23] because something inside you says i
[1:00:25] can't wait to get to the house of god
[1:00:28] can't wait to praise him
[1:00:30] can't wait to be at my family my
[1:00:33] brothers and sisters in christ
[1:00:35] can't wait to worship with him
[1:00:38] he inhabits the praises of his people
[1:00:45] we need to let go let god have his
[1:00:47] wonderful way
[1:00:52] john chapter 6 verse 29 says
[1:00:57] this is the work of god
[1:01:00] that ye believe on him whom he have sent
[1:01:06] christ is going to finish the work he
[1:01:09] started
[1:01:11] just all he's got to do is believe
[1:01:13] believe he's here
[1:01:14] hear what he tells you to do and go do
[1:01:17] it
[1:01:17] and if you just leave here with
[1:01:19] instructions to go do one thing and you
[1:01:22] do it do you know that you probably have
[1:01:24] done most more than what you've done
[1:01:28] a lot of other times
[1:01:31] because we come here like
[1:01:33] suckers and leeches just trying to get
[1:01:35] information
[1:01:38] how about a personal relationship
[1:01:41] how about i just i want to hear from god
[1:01:45] oh my
[1:01:46] i'm only halfway through
[1:01:49] but you know there's 24 hours in a day
[1:01:52] amen
[1:01:55] christ is going to finish the work that
[1:01:57] he started in you the bible says in
[1:01:58] isaiah 55
[1:02:00] verse 11 so shall my word be that go
[1:02:03] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:02:04] return unto me void but it shall
[1:02:06] accomplish that which i please and it
[1:02:08] shall prosper and if in the thing
[1:02:10] wherein two i sent it
[1:02:13] god will not be mocked he would not be
[1:02:15] laughed at on the day of judgment there
[1:02:17] will be one word that he spoke that did
[1:02:19] not come back void
[1:02:22] now when you receive the word into your
[1:02:24] heart it will have to accomplish the
[1:02:26] purpose in which god sent it
[1:02:28] every promise in the book
[1:02:32] and every instruction
[1:02:43] on that day of judgment god will have a
[1:02:46] perfect
[1:02:46] record what won't be perfect for a lot
[1:02:49] of people
[1:02:50] is they won't have perfect faith
[1:02:52] right that's true
[1:02:54] and if there's anything i would like to
[1:02:56] do is stir up
[1:02:58] your faith that the living word is
[1:03:00] amongst us
[1:03:07] we need to be working at building up our
[1:03:10] faith amen amen
[1:03:12] brother brown said it's going to take
[1:03:13] perfect faith to make a rapture can you
[1:03:16] say amen to that
[1:03:17] but how do we get it
[1:03:19] i wish the whole world could hear this
[1:03:23] you need a love relationship first
[1:03:25] before you ever get perfect faith
[1:03:30] there are certain things that god will
[1:03:32] give you faith to get healed god will
[1:03:34] give you faith to go somewhere to to to
[1:03:36] know something ahead of time god will do
[1:03:39] that but when it comes to spending
[1:03:41] eternity with god
[1:03:44] you need to have a love relationship
[1:03:46] first
[1:03:48] but you can't get a love relationship
[1:03:50] first
[1:03:52] until you do something else
[1:03:57] love produces faith we need love
[1:04:00] to get faith
[1:04:02] but we need something else before we get
[1:04:04] love
[1:04:06] what is that
[1:04:08] brother brandon made it real clear he
[1:04:10] said lay everything else aside
[1:04:13] until you get perfect love
[1:04:16] it's true
[1:04:18] so the thing that we have to do is start
[1:04:20] laying aside things that are in our way
[1:04:23] things that are bothering things that
[1:04:25] are gobbling up our time things that we
[1:04:28] think are our responsibilities
[1:04:31] what else would he want us to lay aside
[1:04:33] he wouldn't want us to lay a side church
[1:04:38] he wouldn't want us to lay aside
[1:04:39] reaching out loving trying
[1:04:42] working for the lord he wouldn't want us
[1:04:44] to lay that aside what does he want us
[1:04:46] to lay aside everything else
[1:04:49] till we get perfect love
[1:04:53] perfect love will produce a perfect
[1:04:56] faith
[1:04:59] and brother ben said
[1:05:01] it'll take perfect love to get you in
[1:05:03] there because nothing but perfect love
[1:05:05] was there
[1:05:08] so we have to literally manifest perfect
[1:05:11] love on this planet with jesus christ
[1:05:16] before he's going to give us perfect
[1:05:17] faith for a rapture how important is it
[1:05:20] this little statement lay everything
[1:05:23] aside till you get perfect love i wonder
[1:05:26] who's been even like trying to lay
[1:05:28] things aside
[1:05:29] right who's even interested in that
[1:05:31] right
[1:05:32] you know in other words the devil is
[1:05:34] coming trying to show you another way
[1:05:37] that you can get more love just listen
[1:05:39] to your favorite songs more
[1:05:43] try to enter into the worship a little
[1:05:44] bit more
[1:05:46] read your favor
[1:05:48] your favorite scriptures listen to your
[1:05:50] favorite tape
[1:05:52] no you actually have to do something you
[1:05:55] have to lay aside the things that in
[1:05:57] your life that's keeping god from giving
[1:05:59] you perfect love right amen
[1:06:02] because i'm telling you what you got in
[1:06:03] your life right now you wanted it
[1:06:09] you wanted what you got
[1:06:12] and now what god is saying you need to
[1:06:14] get rid of it
[1:06:15] you want my perfect love in you you want
[1:06:18] to better love your enemies you want to
[1:06:20] be laid on your life for one another you
[1:06:22] want to have to not worry about your
[1:06:23] life anymore then you need to give up
[1:06:26] what you wanted at one time
[1:06:29] i'm telling you god is speaking god is
[1:06:32] speaking there is no other way there's
[1:06:34] no other way to make a rapture
[1:06:36] [Music]
[1:06:38] i know this doesn't make you feel good
[1:06:41] right
[1:06:42] this is the remedy
[1:06:44] this is the remedy
[1:06:48] god is among us
[1:06:51] he's the potter we're the clay
[1:06:54] it's okay for him to
[1:06:57] say
[1:06:58] lay it aside put it all down
[1:07:02] put me first
[1:07:04] brother brandon said in the message the
[1:07:06] way to have fellowship how many wants to
[1:07:09] know the way to have fellowship
[1:07:11] brother brandon says well
[1:07:13] you say
[1:07:14] what good would it do to have faith
[1:07:17] brother brahm says faith
[1:07:20] can sign my pardon
[1:07:22] sure
[1:07:23] that's value in faith
[1:07:25] he says don't be wary don't be scared
[1:07:27] don't be upset
[1:07:29] just have faith and believe
[1:07:32] and the only way you can have faith
[1:07:34] you have to have love first
[1:07:37] for love produces faith
[1:07:40] perfect love he says get it
[1:07:43] perfect love cast out all fear
[1:07:46] in the message jesus christ the same
[1:07:49] yesterday today and forever
[1:07:52] he said
[1:07:54] that's what we must have perfect faith
[1:07:57] to make
[1:07:59] the perfect word of god perform
[1:08:01] perfectly
[1:08:04] that is an amazing quote i wish i just
[1:08:07] read that and don't say anything else
[1:08:09] the whole service
[1:08:12] that's what we must have perfect faith
[1:08:14] to make the perfect word of god perform
[1:08:18] perfectly
[1:08:19] that's it we must believe it without a
[1:08:21] shadow of a doubt we must believe more
[1:08:24] saints that the living word is among us
[1:08:27] when i say that not just here at the
[1:08:29] pulpit it may spring forth from the
[1:08:32] pulpit but it's coming to your heart
[1:08:34] and you have a choice at that matter
[1:08:37] to believe it perfectly or to believe it
[1:08:39] half-heartedly or to go home and say
[1:08:41] well pray about it
[1:08:47] but it won't perform in you
[1:08:49] until you believe it perfectly
[1:08:52] that's what brother branham was telling
[1:08:54] us
[1:08:55] god cannot lie it's impossible for god
[1:08:57] to lie
[1:08:58] and he's never failed once
[1:09:01] so
[1:09:02] always the missing ingredient is
[1:09:03] believing it
[1:09:05] now we can't force ourselves to believe
[1:09:08] but we can't force ourselves to get
[1:09:11] serious with god
[1:09:12] i've had it with this flesh i'm done i'm
[1:09:15] going to take god at his word i'm going
[1:09:17] to say amen i'm going to have the right
[1:09:19] attitude about it i'm going to move
[1:09:20] forward with god i'm going to worship if
[1:09:22] he tells me to worship i'm going to
[1:09:24] reach out if he tells me to reach out
[1:09:26] i'm going to move forward and this shows
[1:09:28] god you're serious with the word
[1:09:32] and we're gonna have to stay in together
[1:09:34] because there's no way that we can
[1:09:35] finish this
[1:09:37] so we're just gonna
[1:09:40] maybe do a part two some other time
[1:09:43] there's just way too much to try to
[1:09:46] ramp in
[1:09:51] believe
[1:09:53] that he's among the saints
[1:09:58] believe he's among you
[1:10:01] what was brother brahm saying when he
[1:10:03] said if there's only one going to make
[1:10:05] it in the city you believe you're that
[1:10:06] one
[1:10:07] he's saying believe the living word is
[1:10:09] among you
[1:10:11] i don't know where my brothers and
[1:10:13] sisters i don't even know
[1:10:14] why i don't
[1:10:17] but i know
[1:10:19] that i am going to believe that he
[1:10:21] speaks to me
[1:10:24] and it don't stop there i'm not going to
[1:10:25] say i'm not going to cry because he
[1:10:27] spoke to me and stop how often we do
[1:10:30] that
[1:10:31] we feel his presence we cry because of
[1:10:35] presence we know it's him
[1:10:38] and we feel
[1:10:40] good enough
[1:10:41] because we entered
[1:10:43] into his presence
[1:10:45] but that's just the first step
[1:10:48] we've got to hear what he tells what
[1:10:50] he's speaking to us
[1:10:52] and then we've got to go do it
[1:10:54] but brother john i think when that
[1:10:55] happens he's just he's just trying to
[1:10:57] just bless me with his presence
[1:11:02] i believe that's true sometimes
[1:11:04] but brother brahm told us you stay there
[1:11:07] and you wait
[1:11:09] he wants to speak something to you he
[1:11:11] has so many things to say
[1:11:13] do you ever get with somebody
[1:11:15] and they just got so many things on
[1:11:16] their minds
[1:11:18] going on
[1:11:20] god has a lot of things he wants to
[1:11:21] speak to us
[1:11:23] just want to hear him we gotta want to
[1:11:24] hear him amen let's stand together
[1:11:28] god bless you
[1:11:31] let's worship this lord and some courses
[1:11:34] amen let's sing he is here
[1:11:37] sing it like you believe it
[1:11:43] he
[1:11:44] is
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:52] here amen
[1:11:56] he is here
[1:12:00] holy holy
[1:12:02] i will bless
[1:12:05] his name again
[1:12:09] he
[1:12:10] is here
[1:12:12] listen closely
[1:12:15] hear him
[1:12:17] calling out your
[1:12:20] name is here
[1:12:24] you
[1:12:25] can touch him and you'll
