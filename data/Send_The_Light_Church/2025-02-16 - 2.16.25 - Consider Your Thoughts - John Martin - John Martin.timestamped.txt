[33:48] may your they feel your presence may
[33:51] they uh be in your spirit Lord as we
[33:55] just sung those songs of Zion expressing
[33:58] our our our victory that we have in you
[34:02] and that you're coming soon and God we
[34:05] want to be listening God we we just ask
[34:08] that you'd bless each and every one
[34:11] father now Lord break the bread of life
[34:13] to us bless your word may it come forth
[34:17] Lord with Revelation to every heart may
[34:20] we just grab the real importance of the
[34:22] message you have for us today Lord help
[34:24] us to
[34:25] just receive Lord from the scriptures
[34:29] that we would read what you would have
[34:31] us to have that we might be able to
[34:34] better uh know uh who it is that is
[34:37] speaking to us father we give you the
[34:40] praise for these things now we ask it in
[34:42] Jesus Christ's name amen amen uh turn
[34:46] with me if you would to the book of
[34:48] First John chapter 4 we're going to read
[34:51] one verse of scripture there we want to
[34:54] uh talk about uh entitled this message
[34:56] considering your thoughts consider your
[34:59] thoughts and for a subject just yielding
[35:02] to the thoughts of God we know that the
[35:04] Bible tells us that there are many
[35:06] voices out there amen and there's many
[35:08] thoughts that come into our heart and
[35:09] sometimes we just don't know what's what
[35:12] and um we have h a scripture here
[35:17] to that the that gives us admir uh
[35:21] admonishing us to try the spirit in
[35:23] verse one it says beloved believe not
[35:26] every spirit
[35:28] but try the
[35:29] spirits and whether they are of God
[35:32] because many false prophets are gone out
[35:35] into the world Amen God bless you you
[35:37] may be
[35:38] seated consider your thoughts believe
[35:42] not every Spirit now a lot of times when
[35:45] we think of spirits we think of uh maybe
[35:48] a spooky movie and there's this uh ghost
[35:52] in the house
[35:53] Ghostbusters or um you know we think of
[35:57] somebody acting really you know real off
[36:00] thewall to an
[36:02] extreme or you know we we something to
[36:06] an extreme and then we say oh there you
[36:08] know there's a spirit but there's like
[36:10] spirits that speak to our minds on a
[36:14] rapid basis constantly speaking to us
[36:18] and they got an
[36:20] agenda um that they want that obviously
[36:23] the devil's wanting to trip us up he's
[36:25] the author of confusion so he would like
[36:27] to
[36:28] Institute um a bunch of thoughts to get
[36:30] us off track okay we're on a race our
[36:33] race is to to um come into the image of
[36:36] Christ and we know the devil's job is to
[36:40] distract us look at the people that are
[36:42] in the world now that are not into
[36:44] Christ and all this stuff that has
[36:47] transpired about you know we're not good
[36:49] enough having two two a genders let's
[36:52] have
[36:53] 27 um it it's it's not good enough that
[36:57] um
[36:58] that a a normal couple would would
[37:01] better have all these rights now we got
[37:03] to have um all these other genders
[37:06] having the same rights and it's it's not
[37:09] um it's not good enough that uh you have
[37:12] to come into America legally and um be
[37:16] here for seven years and be a a a uh
[37:20] here for seven years to become uh an
[37:22] American now you you we want to pay you
[37:24] to come in we're going to fly you in
[37:26] we're going to put you in a m H we're
[37:28] going to give you cell phones and Blue
[37:29] Cross and and it just doesn't matter if
[37:31] the people here um uh don't even have
[37:35] enough that have been here amen and and
[37:39] we don't we don't we we can't even help
[37:41] the people of North Carolina but we got
[37:42] you know 350 million we can put uh other
[37:46] and so we see just out in the world
[37:49] there's so much confusion and
[37:54] chaos
[37:56] but the Devil's no respector persons and
[37:59] one thing he's really trying to Target
[38:01] is keeping the bride from coming into
[38:04] the image of Christ amen and so we get a
[38:08] lot of thoughts into our our mind and um
[38:11] and we just want to consider our
[38:13] thoughts today and just take a look at
[38:14] this topic the word consider means to
[38:17] think carefully about something
[38:20] typically before making a decision and
[38:22] Jesus uses the word consider in fact the
[38:24] word consider is used a number of times
[38:27] I think 66 times in the Bible and so um
[38:32] I believe it's something that we should
[38:34] consider more of is what we're actually
[38:36] thinking about we live in such a
[38:38] laxidasical hour that people often do
[38:41] not consider carefully what they're
[38:44] thinking about am our minds can
[38:47] sometimes be lazy and allow just about
[38:50] anything to come inside No Limits No
[38:52] Boundaries no rules and B basically no
[38:56] considerations whatever happens in there
[38:58] it just happens in
[39:00] there we sometimes can think negatively
[39:03] negatively
[39:05] negatively I'll get it about someone for
[39:09] a time and before we even realize it was
[39:13] wrong and the devil's very good at
[39:15] showing us
[39:18] something negative about somebody that
[39:21] it's true right he's he's not going to
[39:23] he's not going to put a thought in my
[39:24] mind about brother Ron that he's just
[39:27] he's a he's a bank robber because it's
[39:30] not true right but he'll put a thought
[39:33] in my mind about brother brother
[39:37] Bob that brother Bob didn't shake my
[39:39] hand because of that you know and then
[39:43] the negative thought comes amen but if
[39:46] we don't if we allow that thinking about
[39:49] um someone negatively inside of us too
[39:52] long uh what will happen is we might um
[39:58] we might even verbally say something to
[39:59] somebody about it because it stayed
[40:02] there but it was just a thought at the
[40:03] time but then it became strong and and
[40:07] and and if we don't say something
[40:08] verbally if it's still in there we might
[40:11] show it when we talk to Bob and and so
[40:14] it come out in our
[40:15] Behavior but it all starts with our
[40:18] thoughts we know that the love of God
[40:20] thinketh no evil so when we realize that
[40:22] we're thinking evil thoughts we should
[40:24] also recognize the devil who planted
[40:26] them there in our mind mind because it's
[40:28] not in our heart to think evil but the
[40:31] devil is there doing his job so we
[40:32] always want to consider our thoughts so
[40:34] for a moment I want us to take uh some
[40:37] time and just answer these questions
[40:40] here have you ever been so caught up in
[40:42] your thinking that you didn't realize
[40:45] what you were even
[40:47] thinking and you asked yourself why was
[40:50] I thinking
[40:51] that why did that come into my mind what
[40:54] made me think about
[40:56] that where where did that thought come
[40:59] from what was I thinking there
[41:03] am that's not in me to be like that I
[41:07] would never think like that I would
[41:09] never do something like that but it's
[41:12] bringing us easily to the conclusion
[41:15] that all the thoughts that we think are
[41:17] not from
[41:18] God and so therefore we need to consider
[41:22] our thoughts our the thoughts that we
[41:24] think about in our mind are not all
[41:26] right and that's a very very hard pill
[41:28] to swallow but the quicker we can
[41:31] swallow that pill the quicker we can get
[41:33] on top of it and take control of our
[41:36] mind have you ever thought it was okay
[41:38] to think about something as long as you
[41:40] didn't say it to anybody that's a big
[41:43] one right there it's okay for me to
[41:45] think about it but you know I I'm just
[41:49] as long as I don't tell anybody like
[41:51] maybe our minds are a safe haven or a
[41:53] place of Refuge from others like every
[41:56] thought that's protected in our mind and
[41:58] you felt totally it was totally fine
[42:00] thinking that as long as you didn't say
[42:03] something to
[42:05] somebody think about how dangerous our
[42:08] thoughts can be amen just in that and
[42:11] and we think that our mind is like uh
[42:16] it's like it's okay to bring in all
[42:19] these thoughts and it's not the message
[42:24] influence brother Brandon says God
[42:27] I'm a present knows what you're doing
[42:31] and even your thoughts one time while I
[42:34] was in a vision I was speaking to a
[42:37] being I believe it the angel of the Lord
[42:40] standing by me and he said back he said
[42:43] your thoughts are louder in heaven than
[42:46] your voice is on Earth he knows what
[42:50] you're
[42:51] thinking your thoughts speak louder in
[42:55] heaven but yet we don't want to share
[42:58] them sometimes with
[43:00] somebody the scriptures
[43:03] record that Jesus perceived the thoughts
[43:06] of people many times he
[43:10] knew he they weren't even speaking but
[43:12] he knew their thoughts so we want to
[43:14] remember that God knows what we're
[43:17] thinking Proverbs 23:7 says for as a man
[43:21] thanketh so is he now I do want us to
[43:24] understand I really appreciate do not
[43:26] worry about any kind of uh movement or
[43:29] anything like that today because there's
[43:30] not many in the back that you can't be
[43:32] distracted from and I just appreciate
[43:34] you being here and um so I just I just
[43:37] wanted to share how I felt about that so
[43:40] you're not you know getting any thoughts
[43:42] you know what I'm saying because we're
[43:42] talking about thoughts this
[43:44] morning mam said in the spoken word is
[43:47] the Original Seed he said our minds are
[43:49] the spiritual womb of our spirit right
[43:52] our minds are the spiritual womb of our
[43:55] spirit and we know that the womb is
[43:57] where a seed is taken in and whatever
[44:01] seed is taken in you're going to
[44:03] have it it just doesn't matter it's it's
[44:06] it's just whatever seed comes in that
[44:08] that's what's going to come for so it's
[44:10] important that we receive the right
[44:13] seed our mind conceives thoughts seed
[44:16] thoughts our mind receives these seed
[44:19] thoughts from one of two sources we know
[44:22] it's the either the tree of life or the
[44:23] tree of death and when we dwell and we
[44:26] think on these thoughts they actually
[44:28] grow
[44:29] plants so it's like well I can think
[44:31] about it for a while and I should be
[44:34] okay no you don't understand you planted
[44:36] a
[44:37] plant it's going to come out you planted
[44:41] a plant it's going to come out so these
[44:43] these plants become a part of what our
[44:46] garden is we all got a garden and where
[44:49] we're growing stuff it is vitally
[44:51] important to consider our thoughts
[44:54] because some of the plants that we're
[44:55] planning are are poison poisonous
[44:58] anything that the devil puts inside you
[44:59] it's going to poison you it's going to
[45:01] steal your joy it's going to steal you
[45:04] your happiness you're it's going to
[45:06] bring depression why are people full of
[45:09] anxiety and and so many things are
[45:11] happening because they have received the
[45:13] thoughts that are poisonous and they
[45:16] haven't kept their their mind stayed on
[45:18] the Lord
[45:19] amen he first Peter 5'8 says be
[45:23] sober that means watchful of our
[45:26] thoughts that's what it means or as the
[45:28] message says consider our thoughts so be
[45:32] sober be vigilant this is how we're
[45:34] supposed to consider our
[45:37] thoughts Vigilant means keep awake don't
[45:41] be lazy in your thinking be aware of
[45:44] what's going on in your mind at all
[45:45] times in other words you got to be able
[45:47] to identify I can identify there's
[45:49] nobody sitting in this row there's
[45:51] somebody sitting in that row I need to
[45:52] be a to identify what thoughts are in my
[45:55] mind either they're from God or they're
[45:58] not and not just well it's okay to think
[46:01] about everything that's that's what
[46:03] we're trying to get away from it's not
[46:05] okay to think about
[46:06] anything so be sober be vigilant because
[46:10] your
[46:12] adversary the devil as a roaring line
[46:14] he's walking around seeking whom he may
[46:18] devour now we don't see him physically
[46:21] like we see one another so he's walking
[46:23] around
[46:25] invisibly and he's coming to our mind
[46:27] that's where he devours us in our minds
[46:29] in a weak mind but if you got a strong
[46:32] mind strong in the
[46:34] Lord strong in faith Being Sober be
[46:37] vigilant I'm just not going to let any
[46:39] thought come into my mind and you're
[46:40] being strong that's where you're going
[46:42] to catch the devil but if you're like
[46:44] you're not you know I you don't want to
[46:47] reain re retain God in your mind you
[46:50] just want to not think about God you
[46:51] don't want to think about the scripture
[46:52] you just kind of want to do your own
[46:54] thing well then I will say to you that
[46:57] you're an easy target for the devil amen
[46:59] and that's what causes so much problem
[47:02] but the Bible says in verse n we have a
[47:04] job that when we recognize the devil
[47:06] speaking to us it says whom resist
[47:10] steadfast in the faith knowing that the
[47:14] same things that are happening to you
[47:16] are happening to your brethren that are
[47:18] all over the world they got to fight the
[47:19] same
[47:20] battle they got to resist the same devil
[47:27] Devil comes knocking on their mind you
[47:28] got to remember the devil has a lot of
[47:31] lures he's just trying to get you away
[47:33] from
[47:35] God get you to a place where he can just
[47:37] fill you with anything except God and
[47:41] the problem is he doesn't tell you
[47:43] you're going to get sick you're going to
[47:44] get depressed you're going to get angry
[47:46] you're going to get
[47:47] upset you're going to get away from God
[47:50] he doesn't tell you that
[47:52] stuff but he plants in front of you
[47:55] billboard signs and I remember as clear
[47:58] as day seen billboard signs that are
[48:00] just like a beautiful picture of of of
[48:03] Colorado and the white cap of snow
[48:06] mountains and just it just looked
[48:07] beautiful and they got a a guy there
[48:10] with just white glistening teeth just so
[48:12] beautiful looking and they're selling
[48:16] cigarettes selling a pack of cigarettes
[48:19] on that billboard but they got this
[48:20] great big look at this beautiful thing
[48:23] that I'm presenting to you but behind it
[48:27] was
[48:28] poison right they they don't they don't
[48:30] show hey this is evidence we got lung
[48:33] cancer over here and we got these teeth
[48:35] that are just like you know rotted out
[48:39] they don't show the reality that's what
[48:41] the devil don't do do when he comes and
[48:42] he puts thoughts in her mind I remember
[48:45] seeing one time a billboard this this it
[48:48] was a woman just dreed dressed in a a
[48:52] black uh velvet just just
[48:57] uh presented in a beautiful way and and
[49:01] they're selling um some I don't know
[49:05] Royal Crown Liquor or
[49:07] something you know this this presenting
[49:11] Beauty to destroy your liver
[49:15] amen and and the devil is not going to
[49:18] present to us the reality of why he's
[49:21] putting the thought in our head but he's
[49:23] he definitely has an endgame agenda to
[49:25] get you away from God
[49:27] Amen so the the answer is we need to
[49:31] resist or stand against and it says
[49:35] steadfast that means solid stable strong
[49:38] and no double-mindedness that's what
[49:39] that means so in order to be steadfast
[49:43] and to stand against the devil we have
[49:45] got to know who it is that we're talking
[49:46] to in other words we got to quickly try
[49:49] the spirit not just well I didn't know
[49:51] what I was thinking I didn't know it was
[49:53] him I I I didn't know you got to know
[49:57] yeah you got to know that's your job
[49:59] you've got to know what's going on in
[50:01] your
[50:02] mind this all happens in our mind
[50:05] brother BR preached the message the
[50:06] greatest battle ever
[50:08] [Music]
[50:09] fought we can even come to church here
[50:12] to hear the word but you know who else
[50:13] is here the devil amen and he he wants
[50:17] to he wants to take the
[50:19] word and beat you
[50:22] up God wants to take give you the word
[50:24] and set you free two two different
[50:27] motives but the same
[50:29] word James 4:7 submit yourselves
[50:33] therefore to
[50:36] God resist the devil and he will flee
[50:39] how how do you do that you do it right
[50:41] here it's all happens in your
[50:45] head submit yourself therefore to the to
[50:49] the word to to the truth to the right
[50:52] thing to the things that you know to do
[50:54] submit to it and and then resist the
[50:58] devil and he'll leave but here this is
[51:01] the problem in leoa it's lukewarm and it
[51:04] doesn't matter what anybody thinks about
[51:07] there's it just doesn't matter there's
[51:08] no conviction there nothing bothers you
[51:10] you just think about whatever you want
[51:11] and everything's okay you're never wrong
[51:13] until you're till you're what Until you
[51:16] realize that something went wrong
[51:19] somewhere
[51:22] am most of the time we don't recognize
[51:24] where our thoughts come from the Devil
[51:28] deceptive our thoughts lead us to a
[51:31] destiny right our thoughts lead us to a
[51:35] destiny I I've watched a number of of uh
[51:39] things about people that are
[51:42] into um satanic worship and and serving
[51:45] the devil and they understand about an
[51:48] end agenda they know what they're doing
[51:51] when they're trying to get certain
[51:52] people in places and in the government
[51:54] and in the schools and they know what
[51:56] they're
[51:58] doing because they're after they're an
[52:01] end an end point and it doesn't always
[52:04] start out that
[52:07] way our thoughts lead us to a Desy it's
[52:10] so
[52:11] important to consider our
[52:14] thoughts now God's thoughts lead us to a
[52:17] destiny he said I know the thoughts that
[52:19] I think towards you sayith the
[52:21] Lord thoughts of Peace not of evil to
[52:26] give you you an expected end so his
[52:28] thoughts lead us to an expected end
[52:31] brother bam taught us that that we were
[52:33] in God's thoughts before there was
[52:37] anything and and then he spoke the word
[52:40] and and the word is just a a a a thought
[52:42] expressed and then it became the
[52:44] manifestation of it but it shows the
[52:47] importance of a
[52:49] thought Jesus talked about there being
[52:52] two Gates or we might say it like this
[52:54] two gates of thoughts
[52:56] one leads to destruction one leads to
[52:59] life and our thoughts have have led us
[53:03] down a wrong path many times how do we
[53:06] know that just think about all the times
[53:08] you said I'm
[53:11] sorry we've made many mistakes because
[53:14] why now they weren't all just oh I just
[53:18] didn't know no we
[53:22] knew many
[53:24] times but we didn't consider enough our
[53:28] thoughts so we need to consider our
[53:31] thoughts more amen there was a man from
[53:34] the 6th Century BC he was an extra
[53:37] extraordinary thinker his name was Leo
[53:42] teasu Tzu however you say that Brother
[53:45] Bruce you'd probably be about the best
[53:46] or Cheryl and he said watch your
[53:49] thoughts they become your
[53:52] words watch your words they become your
[53:55] actions
[53:57] watch your actions they become your
[54:00] habits watch your habits they become
[54:02] your
[54:03] character watch your character it
[54:05] becomes your
[54:07] destiny I am telling you your thought is
[54:10] the most
[54:12] important because it's going to lead to
[54:14] everything else that happens in your
[54:16] life if you're extremely happy about
[54:18] what's going on in your life stay with
[54:20] the thoughts that you're doing but if
[54:21] you're not happy with the things that
[54:23] are going on in your life you need to
[54:25] look at your thoughts it's all is it's
[54:26] nothing
[54:30] else our thoughts lead us to our destiny
[54:33] we are basically where we're at in life
[54:36] today because of decisions that we made
[54:39] in the
[54:40] past we're not in a different spot we we
[54:42] made decisions back there and that led
[54:44] us to hear you gave your heart to Jesus
[54:47] Christ if you wouldn't have done that
[54:48] you wouldn't be here amen and and so
[54:51] your thoughts are really important but
[54:52] see there's more there's more to Christ
[54:55] than just I gave I got salvation he has
[54:59] something in mind he has predestinated
[55:01] us to become In His
[55:03] Image and so his thoughts are leading us
[55:06] to come into His
[55:09] Image I know the thoughts I think
[55:12] towards
[55:13] you God's thoughts lead us in a specific
[55:18] Direction his word will not return void
[55:21] it will accomplish what it pleases
[55:23] him his thoughts
[55:26] of that he
[55:28] had by his for knowledge before we
[55:31] existed was to to predestinate us into a
[55:36] certain spot okay
[55:38] today you're here in
[55:41] church and you didn't go to any other
[55:43] church because you were if I could say
[55:45] it like
[55:46] this God knew 40 years ago that you
[55:50] would be here today at this building
[55:52] today it was pre-ordained he predestined
[55:56] at it in order for that to happen he had
[55:59] to put thoughts in your mind this
[56:01] morning the first one was hey are we
[56:04] still having church I hope church is
[56:06] cancelled I mean you had all these
[56:08] thoughts and okay I got I guess I got to
[56:10] go and then you work through all
[56:13] that and he places that thought in you
[56:15] we're having church today and we
[56:18] go that's how important the thought is
[56:21] today for the what what happened 40
[56:24] years
[56:24] ago so
[56:27] it's no different with coming to the
[56:29] image of Jesus
[56:30] Christ we need to follow the thoughts
[56:33] that God gives us in order to reach our
[56:36] destiny we just can't say I'm bride I'm
[56:39] in the message I'm predestinated I'm G
[56:42] to make it it doesn't work like
[56:45] that that is a false sense of
[56:48] security if that's all we had to do why
[56:50] do we even come to
[56:53] church that's the end result
[56:57] but there's so many thoughts that we
[56:58] must conceive into our
[57:01] mind that will bring about the character
[57:03] of Jesus Christ in our
[57:06] life the scripture tells us let this
[57:09] mind be in you which was also in Christ
[57:12] Jesus now our mind is not an
[57:16] encyclopedia it's not it's not the the
[57:20] mind is not just a book with words in
[57:24] it because
[57:27] uh let me just say
[57:30] this when you go to a funeral and
[57:33] there's somebody dead their mind is not
[57:35] there their body's there so when I'm
[57:39] talking about the mind of Christ I am
[57:40] not just talking about words in a
[57:43] book I'm talking about a Living spirit
[57:47] that operates these
[57:50] words so the mind of Christ is something
[57:53] that's real it's just is you either got
[57:56] it or you don't amen and this is what we
[57:59] need to pray for just let it be and it
[58:03] takes ready desire that's all really
[58:05] takes desire it's not a gift but you got
[58:08] to want the mind of Christ now we cannot
[58:11] have the mind of Christ at the same time
[58:12] of having a carnal mind in other words
[58:15] we can't be double-minded we can't be
[58:18] wishy-washy James 1: 18 says a
[58:20] double-minded or what that really means
[58:21] double-minded is
[58:23] two-spirited a two-spirited man is
[58:26] unstable or always changing in all his
[58:31] ways the mind of Christ is controlled by
[58:34] the spirit of Christ inside of a man
[58:38] it's a controlled
[58:39] atmosphere he's sober he's watchful he's
[58:42] watching his thoughts he's
[58:44] considering his thoughts he's Vigilant
[58:49] the mind of Christ is not laxidasical
[58:51] and lazy it doesn't say well I did my
[58:53] job I I read for five I read for a half
[58:56] hour I listened to a tape and now I'm on
[58:58] my own that is not the mind of
[59:03] Christ Amen Brother John i s I had to
[59:05] put that in there because there wasn't
[59:06] very many in the audience saying
[59:08] anything at this
[59:10] time
[59:12] so the scripture tells us 2 Timothy 1:7
[59:16] For God has not given us the spirit of
[59:18] fear right amen that's the other Spirit
[59:21] right but of power and of love and of a
[59:24] sound mind notice that is all one spirit
[59:27] all one Spirit of a sound mind all love
[59:29] all power it is a spirit of God that's
[59:32] the spirit he's given us he has not
[59:35] given us the other spirit so the mind of
[59:38] Christ is a sound mind it's
[59:40] solid it's discipline that that word
[59:43] sound mind you look it up it means
[59:45] discipline and
[59:47] self-control you're controlling what's
[59:50] going on in there you're not letting
[59:51] things bounce around like you're playing
[59:53] a the game where the ball's going around
[59:55] all the your hitting these levers and
[59:56] the balls going around you know I'm
[59:58] arcade
[59:59] game that's not what happens in a sound
[1:00:03] mind it doesn't allow the devil to
[1:00:06] welcome his
[1:00:08] stay causing disorder and lawlessness in
[1:00:12] your mind and it just doesn't matter and
[1:00:14] as long as nobody knows and I don't say
[1:00:16] anything I should be okay that is not
[1:00:19] the spirit of Christ that is not a sound
[1:00:22] mind so the scripture this morning is
[1:00:25] beloved believe not every
[1:00:27] Spirit but try the spirits whether they
[1:00:31] are of God because many false prophets
[1:00:34] are gone out into the world Amen many
[1:00:37] spirits come to our
[1:00:39] minds we're instructed not to try a
[1:00:45] person we're it is not instructing us to
[1:00:49] try a person we are instructed to try
[1:00:51] the
[1:00:53] spirit and a lot of times I I don't have
[1:00:56] to worry too much about being deceived
[1:00:58] by
[1:00:59] somebody to be honest with
[1:01:01] you but I I I I have to think about
[1:01:05] those thoughts that come into my
[1:01:08] head
[1:01:10] right because that's where the most of
[1:01:13] the preaching is done by the devil is to
[1:01:15] my is right here right between these two
[1:01:19] ears he just gets on the pulpit and he
[1:01:22] just goes goes goes goes goes and as
[1:01:24] long as you allow him to stay there he
[1:01:26] will keep
[1:01:27] preaching it's our job to resist that
[1:01:30] steadfast keep our minds stay on the
[1:01:32] Lord amen Ephesians 6:12 says for we
[1:01:35] wrestle not against flesh and blood so
[1:01:39] we're not trying the
[1:01:42] person but against principalities
[1:01:45] against Powers against the rulers of
[1:01:47] Darkness of this world against spiritual
[1:01:49] wickedness in high places now think
[1:01:52] about this we're dealing with spiritual
[1:01:54] wickedness in high places but we'll go
[1:01:56] through the course of the day and we
[1:01:58] won't even hardly recognize the devil
[1:01:59] speaking to
[1:02:01] us that's why this message is here
[1:02:05] consider your
[1:02:07] thoughts consider your thoughts 2
[1:02:09] Corinthians 10:3 2 Corinthians 10:3 for
[1:02:13] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:02:16] war after the
[1:02:22] flesh so we're not trying the person
[1:02:25] we're not trying to we're not trying the
[1:02:28] person you know there's a lot of times
[1:02:31] that Believers true genuine children of
[1:02:34] God got wrong spirits on them so we're
[1:02:37] not trying the person we're trying the
[1:02:40] spirit for the weapons of our Warfare
[1:02:43] they're not
[1:02:44] carnal there's no no no drama we're not
[1:02:47] fighting against one another in the
[1:02:52] flesh we don't like well I'm going to
[1:02:54] you know what I'm going to outdo them
[1:02:56] because they did me and I'm going to get
[1:02:58] back to them and I'm not going to talk
[1:02:59] and they did this to me and I'm going to
[1:03:01] do the weapons of our Warfare are not
[1:03:04] carnal they didn't talk to me I'm not
[1:03:06] going to talk to
[1:03:08] them they didn't reach out to me I'm not
[1:03:10] going to reach out to
[1:03:12] them they acted this way toward you know
[1:03:16] turn the cheek walk the Second Mile be
[1:03:18] Christ right the the weapons of our
[1:03:21] Warfare they're not
[1:03:22] carnal but they're Mighty through God to
[1:03:25] the point down of
[1:03:27] strongholds casting down imaginations
[1:03:30] and every High thing that exalteth
[1:03:32] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:03:34] bring it into
[1:03:39] captivity every thought to The Obedience
[1:03:41] of Christ I think about this if I took
[1:03:43] open this up and I let all the water out
[1:03:46] and I just went everywhere or right here
[1:03:51] just it would not be in captivity it
[1:03:53] would just be out here it's in
[1:03:57] captivity and sometimes we just allow
[1:04:01] thoughts to roam in our mind and think
[1:04:03] it's okay and we're told to bring it
[1:04:06] into captivity and then get rid of it
[1:04:09] just get rid of it don't sit there and
[1:04:11] let it stay there and think about it and
[1:04:13] and that's what gets us in trouble
[1:04:15] that's why homes are breaking up and
[1:04:17] relationships with God are breaking up
[1:04:19] because people are allowing the Devil to
[1:04:21] come in and Destroy
[1:04:24] them amen we got to cast down the
[1:04:28] imaginations cast down every High thing
[1:04:30] that exalteth itself against the word of
[1:04:32] God and bring it into captivity every
[1:04:34] thought to The Obedience of Christ amen
[1:04:38] Christ wants me to throw that
[1:04:40] away Satan says I want you to think
[1:04:42] about
[1:04:43] it just want you to just you know keep
[1:04:46] thinking
[1:04:49] about doing your own
[1:04:52] thing and having this is this is about
[1:04:55] Being Sober now being vigilant and
[1:04:58] having a Readiness you're ready you're
[1:05:02] ready I mean I look at brother James
[1:05:04] he's ready to have church he's got his
[1:05:06] suit on he's got his tie on he's ready
[1:05:08] to go he is he did not get dressed to go
[1:05:11] to the Ball Game to the
[1:05:15] park right he's ready he's having in a
[1:05:19] Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience
[1:05:22] how do I do that when your obedience is
[1:05:28] fulfilled so there's something that God
[1:05:30] is wanting us to
[1:05:32] do when when I think about this think
[1:05:36] about this for a second okay so God
[1:05:37] comes and he places a thought in our
[1:05:39] heart I want you to pray for sister Lynn
[1:05:43] right
[1:05:45] now we take that thought and we say we
[1:05:48] we just go and we pray for sister ly
[1:05:50] right there and we fulfilled that's we
[1:05:52] we obeyed God but now a thought comes
[1:05:55] from the the
[1:05:56] devil and says you know um even though
[1:06:00] there's a lot of needs and you got a
[1:06:02] busy day today um you know Ju Just go
[1:06:05] God understands you don't need to
[1:06:07] pray now you have to bring that thought
[1:06:09] under subjection just like you did the
[1:06:11] other
[1:06:12] one amen it's it's not just doing what
[1:06:15] God Said but it's being able to resist
[1:06:17] the devil when he comes into your mind
[1:06:19] and tries to get you off track there's
[1:06:22] an obedience to both Spirits now you try
[1:06:25] the spirit and there's
[1:06:27] obedience you have to do something to
[1:06:29] each Spirit you have to you cannot just
[1:06:31] you can't off thoughts that come in your
[1:06:33] mind everything's
[1:06:36] neutral we are to try the spirit good
[1:06:39] and evil Holy Ghost anti-sp spirit
[1:06:43] Spirit of Truth Spirit of a Angels
[1:06:45] demons we're to figure out what's what I
[1:06:47] think it's a good practice just take out
[1:06:50] time and just go just try going 10
[1:06:53] minutes and name off where which one is
[1:06:56] talking to you it's a good practice
[1:06:59] because the devil wants you to think
[1:07:01] that only God is speaking to you he
[1:07:04] never you never hear the devil come to
[1:07:06] you and say I am the devil and I'm going
[1:07:09] to torment you I'm going to I'm going to
[1:07:12] give you a lot of negative thoughts
[1:07:14] today I'm going to deceive you today I'm
[1:07:16] going to make you feel so bad you're
[1:07:18] going to be so depressed by the time the
[1:07:19] day is over the devil doesn't do that
[1:07:23] but how many times at the end of the day
[1:07:24] do we feel it
[1:07:26] that so the devil does it without us
[1:07:28] knowing and that's why we we're made
[1:07:32] aware and alert to put this into
[1:07:34] practice to take time and consider the
[1:07:37] thoughts that we're
[1:07:40] thinking now these thoughts always come
[1:07:42] to us in a in a way of
[1:07:49] reality a way of reality in other words
[1:07:51] they look so real they look like they're
[1:07:54] from God but we're told to try the
[1:07:58] spirit so how how do we try the
[1:08:03] spirit we have to put it on
[1:08:07] trial now we've heard we've heard this
[1:08:11] we've heard the the word innocent till
[1:08:13] proven
[1:08:14] guilty right well most people do not put
[1:08:19] their thoughts on
[1:08:23] trial in other words the only way that
[1:08:26] some people's thoughts ever get tried is
[1:08:28] if somebody else tries
[1:08:32] them but you know what that means that
[1:08:35] means if that's happening that means the
[1:08:37] person who's thinking doesn't really
[1:08:42] care and we've got to be willing to put
[1:08:45] our thoughts on trial because every
[1:08:47] man's thoughts are right in his own
[1:08:50] eyes we've got to be the one to humble
[1:08:53] oursel and say I could be wrong brother
[1:08:55] Brandon said we need to apply this
[1:08:59] instruction that God has given us to try
[1:09:01] the spirit just get up there and be a
[1:09:04] judge amen don't don't judge me I won't
[1:09:08] judge you but judge yourself somebody's
[1:09:10] got to judge you you got to judge
[1:09:12] yourself and if you do that I am telling
[1:09:15] you you're going to bring those spirits
[1:09:17] and kick them
[1:09:18] out you know brother B said like this he
[1:09:20] says the devil can't do one thing unless
[1:09:22] he's got a vessel to work through and
[1:09:24] can you imag imagine if you had such
[1:09:26] control such a sound mind that the devil
[1:09:29] never used
[1:09:32] you there would be no bad things
[1:09:34] happening in the world because he
[1:09:37] wouldn't have any vessels to work
[1:09:39] through how many times have you heard of
[1:09:41] somebody I won't mention any names but
[1:09:44] we all heard names and the first thing
[1:09:46] we think is oh they're a bad
[1:09:49] person right maybe in the in the
[1:09:51] government or in the world or some
[1:09:53] things that they did oh they're a bad
[1:09:57] person we just need to learn to put our
[1:10:01] thoughts on trial
[1:10:04] amen when we put a spirit on trial I'm
[1:10:08] just going to give you what the uh
[1:10:13] Hebrew is saying here or the Greek I'm
[1:10:16] sorry we examine the spirit when we try
[1:10:19] we put a spirit on trial okay we're
[1:10:22] we're going to talk about this thing
[1:10:23] right now we're just we're going to talk
[1:10:25] about this thought that just came into
[1:10:27] my mind know we got to learn to we
[1:10:28] should at the beginning if we don't do
[1:10:30] this it's going to take time to learn
[1:10:32] how to do this but then after a while
[1:10:35] you can like speed it up because
[1:10:36] thoughts are quick amen so we examine
[1:10:39] the spirit we discern the spirit we
[1:10:42] prove the spirit we test the spirit we
[1:10:45] try the spirit whether it's of God or
[1:10:49] not sometimes it's going to be of God
[1:10:52] but most of the time it's not let me
[1:10:53] just say that again so we get that
[1:10:56] sometimes it's going to be of God but
[1:10:58] the majority of the time it's not going
[1:11:00] to
[1:11:01] be now if you're used to doing this all
[1:11:04] the time then you're going to you you've
[1:11:07] already put into practice these Gates
[1:11:09] where the devil can't come in and so
[1:11:12] it's not going to be as bad but if
[1:11:13] you're not trying to do this you're
[1:11:15] going to see that the majority of the
[1:11:16] thoughts that that are happening is is
[1:11:19] of the devil because he has had an open
[1:11:21] door for so
[1:11:23] long just have just let anything go into
[1:11:26] your mind and you just let it go and
[1:11:28] before you know it nothing matters what
[1:11:31] you think about now this is so off the
[1:11:33] word I don't care how predestinated we
[1:11:35] are I don't care how much we're a seed
[1:11:36] of God if we do not put this into
[1:11:38] practice we will never come into the
[1:11:40] image of Christ this needs to be done in
[1:11:42] order for us to come into the image of
[1:11:44] Christ because Christ thoughts will come
[1:11:47] and you will reject those and you will
[1:11:48] keep the thoughts that the devil gives
[1:11:50] you because they're pleasing to the
[1:11:53] Flesh and you can't be double minded
[1:12:01] amen so the if the Devil comes and he's
[1:12:04] bothering you about you just feel
[1:12:05] bothered bothered bothered bothered
[1:12:08] bothered and you just don't know what do
[1:12:11] I
[1:12:12] do well there's a scripture in the Bible
[1:12:15] it says finally Brethren whatsoever
[1:12:16] things are
[1:12:17] true amen whatsoever things are
[1:12:21] honest whatsoever things are just and
[1:12:24] whatsoever things are pure whatsoever
[1:12:26] things are lovely whatsoever things are
[1:12:28] good
[1:12:29] report if there's any virtue any any
[1:12:34] strength any power if there's any praise
[1:12:37] if there's any
[1:12:38] glory to give to God about what you're
[1:12:41] thinking about then go ahead and think
[1:12:44] on
[1:12:44] it but if there isn't then get rid of
[1:12:48] the
[1:12:50] thing get rid of the
[1:12:52] thought you know I I I
[1:12:56] how many's ever wanted to do something
[1:12:59] okay how about this how many's ever
[1:13:00] wanted to convince your
[1:13:04] spouse about
[1:13:06] something lot praise the Lord I love it
[1:13:09] honesty
[1:13:11] here and and you tried and you weren't
[1:13:15] able to do
[1:13:16] it that's a lot too right you tried but
[1:13:19] you weren't allowed to do it so what did
[1:13:21] you do you came from another angle you
[1:13:24] tried it this way and then you tried it
[1:13:27] that way and you finally said look if
[1:13:29] you don't I'm not going to talk to
[1:13:31] you you you the
[1:13:35] devil will try so many
[1:13:39] ways to get us off to get us down to get
[1:13:42] us discouraged to get us bothered about
[1:13:44] something but I'm telling you whatever
[1:13:46] way he tries if it if it crosses this if
[1:13:50] it's bringing you down stop thinking
[1:13:52] about because God has the ability to
[1:13:54] communicate to you another way where you
[1:13:56] don't feel like it if it's
[1:13:58] him
[1:14:01] amen the instructions for us are to try
[1:14:04] every
[1:14:07] Spirit clearly indicates to us that we
[1:14:09] can be deceived by the devil that's what
[1:14:11] that's telling me if I don't I can be
[1:14:14] deceived thinking on things for a while
[1:14:17] that do not bring strength and power and
[1:14:20] virtue and make me feel like moving
[1:14:23] forward with Christ I say come the thing
[1:14:25] off just cut it
[1:14:27] off it takes work to try a spirit it
[1:14:31] takes work it don't take any work to be
[1:14:34] lazy and just think about anything no
[1:14:35] work it's like sitting in front of a
[1:14:37] television watching a movie you know
[1:14:40] your brain you don't you don't have to
[1:14:41] think about
[1:14:43] anything you ever get those shows you're
[1:14:45] watching and they got five things going
[1:14:47] on at one time and it's making you think
[1:14:50] and you like getting irritated because
[1:14:51] it's not entertaining you you want to
[1:14:54] turn it off
[1:14:55] you know what I'm talking about you want
[1:14:56] to watch something that you can just sit
[1:14:59] there and not have to figure it
[1:15:02] out and that's kind of how we are with
[1:15:04] our mind thinking thoughts so it takes
[1:15:08] work to actually try a spirit it takes
[1:15:10] I'm going to say the work of humility
[1:15:12] that you that you have to do it it takes
[1:15:15] dedication
[1:15:16] soberness and wanting to only think the
[1:15:19] thoughts that come from Heaven to have
[1:15:20] that desire God I only want to think
[1:15:22] your thoughts so we need wisdom from
[1:15:25] above we need the the fear of the Lord
[1:15:26] the beginning of wisdom to walk in this
[1:15:28] direction Philippians 2:12 wherefore my
[1:15:31] beloved Brethren as ye have always
[1:15:35] obeyed not in my presence
[1:15:37] only but now much more in my absence
[1:15:40] work out your own
[1:15:42] salvation with fear and trembling so we
[1:15:44] have to work out this trying this spirit
[1:15:47] with fear and trembling I could be wrong
[1:15:49] I shouldn't be thinking this have you
[1:15:51] ever just like been thinking about
[1:15:53] something look at something saying
[1:15:56] something and you realize oh I shouldn't
[1:15:59] do that okay that's it right there fear
[1:16:03] and trembling oh I shouldn't do that
[1:16:06] that's what we need more of we need to
[1:16:07] work out what's going on in our mind
[1:16:09] with fear and
[1:16:11] trembling for it is God which works in
[1:16:14] you yes both to Will and to do of his
[1:16:18] good pleasure not the Devils so when you
[1:16:21] hear from God do all things without
[1:16:23] murmuring and
[1:16:26] disputing you ever been asked to do
[1:16:28] something you know it was the will of
[1:16:30] the
[1:16:31] Lord and you just murmured about
[1:16:36] it
[1:16:38] look and then the Devil comes and he
[1:16:40] puts thoughts in our head and we just
[1:16:42] jump up and down about the excitement of
[1:16:45] it that we need the fear and trembling
[1:16:48] we need to make this so real I know this
[1:16:50] is not maybe a favorable message to make
[1:16:52] us excited but this is a message that
[1:16:54] will get us down the road where we got
[1:16:55] to go it will get us down the
[1:16:59] road all right we need to consider our
[1:17:01] thoughts I've quoted this in years past
[1:17:04] I don't know how long it's been but
[1:17:06] William Janes said the greatest
[1:17:08] discovery of my generation and I'll say
[1:17:10] any generation is that a human being can
[1:17:13] alter his life by altering his attitude
[1:17:18] now an attitude is the way you
[1:17:21] think you ever been you ever been out to
[1:17:24] lunch with
[1:17:25] somebody and you're just you know you
[1:17:27] want to get some hambur and you're going
[1:17:28] to get some fries and you just you know
[1:17:30] you just want to enjoy some greasy
[1:17:31] chicken or something and you're sitting
[1:17:34] with a person and
[1:17:35] says I'm I'm not doing that I'm on a
[1:17:38] diet I I can only eat this I can only
[1:17:40] eat these salad with nothing in
[1:17:43] it and and and their their mind is about
[1:17:48] taking care of their
[1:17:49] body where my mind is just about
[1:17:52] enjoying having a good lunch
[1:17:56] amen so you can take your mind and if
[1:17:58] you put it on the things of God you can
[1:18:00] change your life if you'll start taking
[1:18:03] control of your thoughts pretty soon
[1:18:05] they won't get you in
[1:18:10] trouble changing the way a person thinks
[1:18:13] and perceives a situation their attitude
[1:18:17] they can significantly impact and
[1:18:19] improve I'm just reading what the
[1:18:21] internet said here they can
[1:18:23] significantly impact and improve the
[1:18:26] course of their life suggesting that a
[1:18:29] positive mindset can lead to a positive
[1:18:32] outcome and change in one's
[1:18:37] circumstances to think about that you
[1:18:39] can make a difference in your situation
[1:18:41] you know brother B talked about when he
[1:18:43] came home one time and he'd been in uh
[1:18:45] going out preaching he came home and he
[1:18:47] he hadn't been home in a while and the
[1:18:50] the the the kids were just all going
[1:18:52] around and running and and and and she
[1:18:55] was like all uh uh in her mind just kind
[1:18:58] of like tore up of all the work that she
[1:19:00] had to do while um her husband was out
[1:19:03] and and um and and so she was washing
[1:19:07] dishes and and he came into the
[1:19:11] situation and with the love of God
[1:19:14] helped
[1:19:19] her amen changed the whole
[1:19:22] situation amen now he was wasn't
[1:19:25] wrong he wasn't wrong in going out and
[1:19:28] preaching he wasn't he wasn't the one
[1:19:30] that caused his wife to be like
[1:19:33] this or his children to act like
[1:19:38] this but he found a way to
[1:19:41] help and that's what a good attitude
[1:19:44] would do it will alter a
[1:19:46] situation it takes God to change things
[1:19:49] permanently amen but we can let God use
[1:19:53] us to help a a
[1:19:55] situation brother B said that if he if
[1:20:01] we would take the right mental attitude
[1:20:03] towards any Divine promise of God that
[1:20:04] it would bring it to pass just taking a
[1:20:07] right attitude towards it in other words
[1:20:09] not okay so we're say I I believe that I
[1:20:13] believe I'm going to be delivered I
[1:20:14] believe I'm going to be healed I believe
[1:20:16] I'm going to grow in wisdom I believe
[1:20:17] I'm going to be filled with the love of
[1:20:19] God I'm I'm gonna have get the Holy
[1:20:21] Ghost you take any of these promises
[1:20:25] and you think on them and believe them
[1:20:28] and trust God and testify and just thank
[1:20:31] God every day and worship him for an end
[1:20:33] result it's going to happen but if you
[1:20:36] take the mindset and say yeah I believe
[1:20:38] it's going to happen I don't know it's
[1:20:40] just I don't I I don't I
[1:20:43] just yeah it's gonna happen I just
[1:20:47] things are I'm busy right now I I'm even
[1:20:49] thinking about you know going to
[1:20:52] church how in the world is God going to
[1:20:54] to bring anything to
[1:20:58] pass so we need to use our mind for God
[1:21:01] and only for God keep our minds stayed
[1:21:04] on the Lord if we want to grow if we
[1:21:07] really want to have the image of Christ
[1:21:09] we've got to we've got to take the
[1:21:12] land we can't we can't just go over the
[1:21:14] go over that and work over here and then
[1:21:16] when we're done you know we're just
[1:21:17] going to go do this over
[1:21:20] here and our promised land is the image
[1:21:23] of Jesus Christ me myself becoming like
[1:21:25] Christ that is the promised
[1:21:27] land amen and I don't know what your
[1:21:30] promised land is some people's promised
[1:21:33] land is hey I'm already there you know
[1:21:35] what I'm saved that's all I care
[1:21:37] about they're not even they're not even
[1:21:39] caring about being in the image of
[1:21:41] Christ they have no
[1:21:43] vision and we need that Vision God's
[1:21:46] thoughts lead us to our
[1:21:48] destiny and we cannot make it to heaven
[1:21:51] without the mind of Christ do you know
[1:21:53] that
[1:21:55] amen Jesus Saidi am the way the truth
[1:21:57] and the life no man cometh unto the
[1:21:59] father but by
[1:22:01] me so we need the mind of Christ to
[1:22:04] actually get to the
[1:22:06] father we can't make it into a Rapture
[1:22:09] without the thoughts of God we can't
[1:22:11] make it into the image of Christ without
[1:22:12] the mind of Christ we must receive the
[1:22:16] thoughts of God into our mind in order
[1:22:17] to become manifested in our life we
[1:22:20] can't just say oh somehow it's going to
[1:22:22] happen by me you know by the turning the
[1:22:24] count cend in New Year but me going to
[1:22:26] church me listening to tapes you know
[1:22:28] somehow it's just going to happen it
[1:22:29] don't work like
[1:22:32] that you listen to all the tapes you
[1:22:37] want so when God gives you a thought in
[1:22:40] your mind just go do it because it is
[1:22:43] leading you to where you need to go if
[1:22:46] all I had to do was listen to tapes read
[1:22:49] the Bible spend a few uh H H time in in
[1:22:53] prayer on my knees every day if that's
[1:22:55] all I had to do to be a Christian wow
[1:22:58] and then the rest of my life the rest of
[1:23:00] my mind the rest of my
[1:23:02] desires I could do what I want to do
[1:23:06] wow that would be easy easy wouldn't it
[1:23:09] just do your your your
[1:23:11] Works that'd be like saying going into
[1:23:14] the barn makes you a horse or chickens
[1:23:17] or goats what you got in there coming
[1:23:22] doing those things don't make us a
[1:23:23] Christian we do those things that we can
[1:23:25] become more like
[1:23:28] Christ Jesus said my my words they are
[1:23:33] spirit and they are life my words but
[1:23:37] remember the word was just his thought
[1:23:40] so when we're reading the Bible we're
[1:23:42] really reading the thought of
[1:23:44] God it's like you want to read God's
[1:23:47] mind read the Bible That's the mind of
[1:23:50] God that's his thoughts they're
[1:23:52] expressed on a piece of paper and
[1:23:54] brother taught us that the thoughts of
[1:23:55] God don't
[1:23:57] change he can't make a better decision
[1:24:00] all of us make better decisions how many
[1:24:02] times you walked away say I shouldn't
[1:24:03] have done that I know what to do next
[1:24:07] time I've got so many things I can point
[1:24:09] my life and I had to redo didn't work
[1:24:11] out the first time God don't have to
[1:24:14] redo
[1:24:15] anything and so we need the thoughts of
[1:24:17] God to help our life to become more
[1:24:20] stable amen 1 John chapter 1 not first
[1:24:23] John but St John chapter one in the
[1:24:26] beginning time is slipping away in the
[1:24:29] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:24:33] with God and the Word was God Amen
[1:24:37] brother bam talked about that God was
[1:24:38] sitting with all his thoughts alone the
[1:24:41] same was in the beginning with God in
[1:24:43] verse 14 the word was made flesh the
[1:24:47] word was made flesh the word needs to be
[1:24:50] made flesh in US yes it just has to in
[1:24:53] order for that to happen happen it's not
[1:24:55] us at certain times coming to the altar
[1:24:57] banging on the Altar and said I want I
[1:25:00] want the Holy Ghost I want to be like
[1:25:01] you God and then then the rest of the
[1:25:04] time you're just doing what you want to
[1:25:06] do in order for the word to become flesh
[1:25:10] inside of you you've got to keep your
[1:25:12] mind State on
[1:25:15] it Jesus the Bible says that you shall
[1:25:18] seek me and find me when you search for
[1:25:20] me with all your heart amen and so
[1:25:23] there's this desire that God has ask it
[1:25:26] shall be given seek and you shall find
[1:25:28] knock and the door shall be open he has
[1:25:30] this this desire that we keep seeking
[1:25:33] after to become In His Image don't lose
[1:25:36] that Vision don't get caught up in the
[1:25:39] world don't get caught up and just be in
[1:25:40] a worldly Church well I go to her I'm in
[1:25:42] the message I'm I'm G I'm saved don't do
[1:25:46] that check those thoughts consider your
[1:25:49] thoughts brother Bram send the message
[1:25:51] just once more Lord he says and the only
[1:25:54] only thing you have to
[1:25:56] do to know that he God is here is to get
[1:26:01] yourself out of the way see as long as
[1:26:06] you're in your way then God cannot do
[1:26:10] anything for
[1:26:12] you when you think your thoughts then
[1:26:16] God's thoughts don't have a
[1:26:19] chance but if you'll quit thinking your
[1:26:22] thoughts and think his thoughts
[1:26:25] my thoughts is not your thoughts right
[1:26:27] I'll read that scripture in just a
[1:26:28] second but I just want to say
[1:26:31] this look you can't have the mindset all
[1:26:34] I got to do is read and pray spend some
[1:26:36] time doing this and I'm set to go to do
[1:26:38] whatever I want the rest of the day you
[1:26:39] cannot do
[1:26:44] that this you've got to get rid of your
[1:26:48] thinking on a regular basis if you want
[1:26:51] your life to change you like you have to
[1:26:53] allow God thoughts to be preeminent in
[1:26:56] your mind right amen our whole goal is
[1:26:58] to become more like Christ to make
[1:27:00] things better to build and we can't do
[1:27:02] that when we just give God a partial of
[1:27:05] our you know uh 10% of our
[1:27:08] day I tell you most people don't even
[1:27:10] get
[1:27:11] 10% have you ever and I'm guilty of this
[1:27:14] I repented of this this
[1:27:17] week one day
[1:27:20] our our our propane went out and our
[1:27:23] furnaces went out
[1:27:25] and the guys got showed up real
[1:27:28] early and I got up and I
[1:27:31] just I was praying as I walked and
[1:27:34] started
[1:27:36] helping I look back and I don't remember
[1:27:39] going back and spending time with God
[1:27:42] about that situation so I little
[1:27:44] repented that I did
[1:27:46] not take time to pray like I should
[1:27:50] have so I I just can't give God a little
[1:27:53] bit of time than go do what I want to do
[1:27:54] that's not what this message is this
[1:27:57] message is considering our
[1:27:59] thoughts all day long consider your
[1:28:03] thoughts amen all right read the
[1:28:05] scripture Isaiah 556 says seek ye the
[1:28:07] Lord while he may be found call upon him
[1:28:10] call ye upon him while he is near let
[1:28:13] the wicked forsake his way and the
[1:28:17] unrighteous man his thoughts am and let
[1:28:20] him return unto the Lord and He will
[1:28:23] have mercy upon him and to our God and
[1:28:25] he will abundantly pardon for my
[1:28:27] thoughts are not your thoughts neither
[1:28:29] are your ways my ways sayith the Lord
[1:28:31] for as the heaven is higher than the
[1:28:32] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:28:35] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[1:28:37] that's what brother Bri saying you've
[1:28:38] got to get yours out of the way if you
[1:28:40] as long as they're there God can't move
[1:28:42] so if all we're going to do is try to
[1:28:43] get our thoughts out of the way for a
[1:28:45] half hour while we spend some time with
[1:28:46] God and then we're going to go on our
[1:28:48] day we really did not fulfill the
[1:28:51] scripture what we did is we did some
[1:28:53] sort of work to try to Institute God in
[1:28:57] and that's all we gave him but we never
[1:28:59] put into practice what we did in that
[1:29:01] half hour we got to get off of that half
[1:29:03] hour and and meditate upon
[1:29:05] it and desire it and say God I'm hungry
[1:29:08] for
[1:29:15] it don't get mad at
[1:29:18] me Romans
[1:29:21] 8:28 and we know that all things were
[1:29:24] together for the good to them that love
[1:29:25] God who are the called according to his
[1:29:29] purpose for whom he did for know he also
[1:29:31] did predestinate to be conformed into
[1:29:33] the image of his son that we might be
[1:29:36] the firstborn among many Brethren
[1:29:38] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[1:29:40] he also called them he called he them he
[1:29:42] also Justified and to whom he justified
[1:29:45] them he also glorified so you see
[1:29:47] there's a process here I want to talk
[1:29:50] about this process Paul is referring to
[1:29:53] a certain group group of Believers here
[1:29:54] it's not referring to everybody
[1:29:57] right a foreordained predestinated group
[1:30:01] that is is now being conformed into the
[1:30:04] image of Christ it's happening right now
[1:30:07] amen it's not going to happen amen it
[1:30:09] didn't happen is it's happening it's
[1:30:12] present
[1:30:14] tense now even though we've been
[1:30:17] predestinated there is a process that we
[1:30:20] must all go
[1:30:21] through we can't just make it in because
[1:30:24] we're predestined we can't make it in
[1:30:25] just because we believe that we're bride
[1:30:27] we must receive the higher thoughts of
[1:30:29] God when they come to us and brother
[1:30:31] Brandon's made it real clear we come to
[1:30:32] church find out where we're at with God
[1:30:34] so the the preaching is coming forth we
[1:30:36] get a thought we know where we're at
[1:30:38] with God it's no longer well I don't
[1:30:41] know that just that just kind of seems
[1:30:43] that uh you
[1:30:46] know no we need to humble oursel and
[1:30:50] realize that God is speaking
[1:30:54] they are directed God's thoughts are
[1:30:56] directed personally to us in other words
[1:31:00] right now I can say this that that
[1:31:02] brother Ron is not thinking the same
[1:31:04] thing that sister an is thinking or
[1:31:06] sister lur is not thinking the same
[1:31:08] thoughts that Brother Bruce is
[1:31:11] thinking because God has a personal
[1:31:13] thought for you for your
[1:31:16] life because he's tailoring he cares
[1:31:19] about you it would be
[1:31:22] confusing for for uh sister Donna's
[1:31:26] thought to be given to brother Roger
[1:31:28] it'd be
[1:31:29] confusing God is not the author
[1:31:31] confusion he wants to be real clear the
[1:31:34] thought that you feel inside is the
[1:31:36] thought that he's given you
[1:31:39] right and that's why the scripture says
[1:31:41] he that have an ear let him hear what
[1:31:43] the spirit is saying to the
[1:31:46] churches God's thoughts are being spoken
[1:31:49] yes the word is being preached we're
[1:31:51] hearing the gospel but it's something
[1:31:52] more personal God is sending us a
[1:31:55] message that we're going to take home
[1:31:56] and we're begin to apply in our lives
[1:31:59] and it's going to make a difference in
[1:32:00] the message the token brother Bram said
[1:32:02] if the Life of Christ lives in the
[1:32:05] person they become identified with him
[1:32:09] if the Life of Christ if the life of
[1:32:11] Jesus Christ lives in the person they
[1:32:14] become identified with him that's pretty
[1:32:16] powerful it is Christ in you not a
[1:32:18] church member not a system but it's the
[1:32:22] resurrected power
[1:32:24] it's the Holy Ghost is a
[1:32:27] token upon you that your life says Amen
[1:32:31] to the
[1:32:32] scripture the promise is written in
[1:32:35] there and you are not yourself no more
[1:32:39] now I want you to catch this you are not
[1:32:41] yourself no more you're Christ you don't
[1:32:44] think your
[1:32:45] thoughts you don't think your
[1:32:48] thoughts you say I
[1:32:51] think brother B says you have no thought
[1:32:55] coming the life that was in Christ is in
[1:32:58] you the mind that was in Christ was in
[1:33:00] you the works that was in Christ is in
[1:33:02] you and Christ himself is in you you're
[1:33:05] dead your life is hidden in God through
[1:33:07] Christ sealed with the Holy Ghost you're
[1:33:09] not your own so brother briam is really
[1:33:11] sending a strong message here that you
[1:33:13] don't think your thoughts
[1:33:15] anymore that you're walking by the the
[1:33:18] faith of the son of man the thoughts of
[1:33:21] God so in order for that to happen we we
[1:33:23] got to consider our
[1:33:25] thoughts in order for us to come into
[1:33:27] the image of Christ we must receive the
[1:33:30] thoughts of God as he gives them because
[1:33:31] those thoughts are leading us to the
[1:33:34] next step to the next step to the next
[1:33:36] step I'll tell you I do not know there
[1:33:39] there was a time that I did not know how
[1:33:41] to build a
[1:33:43] building there was a time that I didn't
[1:33:45] know how to put cabinets together there
[1:33:47] was times that I didn't know
[1:33:49] anything but through a process of
[1:33:51] learning I knew how to do it
[1:33:55] and I do not know this way to get into
[1:33:58] the image of Christ I need God's word in
[1:34:01] a living form speaking to me by a
[1:34:03] thought and to walk in that and when I
[1:34:06] walk towards that your life changes your
[1:34:08] life changes your life changes you know
[1:34:09] what happens things get better right
[1:34:12] things get better you get you get
[1:34:15] rewarded praise God God cares about us
[1:34:20] amen so what do we need to do James 1:2
[1:34:23] uh not 1 12 James 1
[1:34:25] 121 that's 21 James 1:21 wherefore lay
[1:34:30] apart all filthiness and superfluity of
[1:34:32] nuttiness and receive with meekness the
[1:34:35] engrafted word which is able to save
[1:34:39] your
[1:34:40] souls so the word comes to us as a
[1:34:43] thought let me just say that the word is
[1:34:45] being
[1:34:46] preached but it's coming to you as a
[1:34:48] thought it doesn't become a word inside
[1:34:50] of you until you receive it
[1:34:55] and you confess it and say it is mine I
[1:34:59] believe it amen this is for me then it
[1:35:02] becomes the word of God in you until
[1:35:04] then it's a thought and you have to
[1:35:07] consider that thought is this of God is
[1:35:09] it not how many times have we heard the
[1:35:11] old saying don't come to church with a
[1:35:14] pitchfork right here's here's a word for
[1:35:17] somebody
[1:35:18] else which is you know we thank God when
[1:35:21] we come to church there's a word for all
[1:35:23] of us
[1:35:24] but but in reality you know we need the
[1:35:27] word that's for us because we can't make
[1:35:29] it okay be ye doers of the word and not
[1:35:32] hearers only what happens when you do
[1:35:33] that you deceive yourself doesn't matter
[1:35:35] what you think for if you be a hearer of
[1:35:38] the word not a doer you're liken unto a
[1:35:41] man beholding his face in a
[1:35:44] glass he beh himself a while go away and
[1:35:47] straight way he forget what he looks
[1:35:49] like he ever just like did something
[1:35:52] really stupid dumb acted a bad way and
[1:35:55] then you just kind of like quickly
[1:35:57] forgot about
[1:35:59] it hours later doing it again hours
[1:36:03] later doing it
[1:36:05] again and so what we need to do is we
[1:36:08] need to allow the Holy Ghost into our
[1:36:11] mind the mind of Christ and take
[1:36:14] control it's it's one thing to be making
[1:36:18] mistakes it's another thing to not care
[1:36:21] and that's the that's the problem that
[1:36:23] our happening in our minds it's not
[1:36:25] happening it's happening in our minds
[1:36:27] and the devil trips us up and we just
[1:36:29] need to get the mind of Christ brother
[1:36:31] Ram said in the message sure we would
[1:36:33] see Jesus he said seven times around the
[1:36:35] world I have been at all different races
[1:36:37] kinds of people of tens of thousands I
[1:36:39] have seen great things that our Lord has
[1:36:42] did but I always notice that it takes
[1:36:48] people that will humble themselves and
[1:36:51] lay aside their own thoughts of it
[1:36:54] and just take God's thought of it and
[1:36:56] work according to his plan which is
[1:36:59] Faith in what he
[1:37:03] said so we need to receive the higher
[1:37:05] thoughts of God meditate upon day and
[1:37:08] night don't say I already know that I've
[1:37:11] already been told that I already
[1:37:14] know so does the
[1:37:17] devil but meditate upon
[1:37:20] it consider your thoughts upon on them
[1:37:24] I'm not going to be able to get
[1:37:25] everything but at at least want to read
[1:37:27] Psalms
[1:37:29] 1 veres 1-6 blessed is the man that
[1:37:34] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:37:36] ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[1:37:38] Sinners nor sth in the seed of the
[1:37:41] scornful don't be hanging out with the
[1:37:43] wrong people amen don't be hanging out
[1:37:46] with the wrong thoughts in your head but
[1:37:49] his Delight is in the law of the Lord
[1:37:52] and in his his law doth he
[1:37:55] meditate not just for a few minutes in
[1:37:57] the morning or a few minutes at
[1:38:00] night but he meditates day and
[1:38:05] night and he shall be something
[1:38:07] different than most other plants he
[1:38:09] shall be like a tree planted by the
[1:38:11] rivers of water that bringeth forth his
[1:38:13] fruit in his season and his Leaf also
[1:38:16] shall not wither and whatsoever he do it
[1:38:18] shall prosper in other words it doesn't
[1:38:20] wither You Can Count would you ever seen
[1:38:23] those those we got a greenhouse now and
[1:38:26] before we had the greenhouse there were
[1:38:27] certain plants that they just died at
[1:38:29] the end of the year right because winter
[1:38:30] came and you but now you got a
[1:38:32] greenhouse you can just keep the thing
[1:38:33] going we're having tomatoes in the
[1:38:35] winter and when you see somebody whose
[1:38:38] Leaf is just always always there always
[1:38:41] giving life it's something you can count
[1:38:42] on it's stable it's solid and that's
[1:38:45] what the mind of Christ is it's it's
[1:38:47] presenting life to all that's around and
[1:38:51] can handle all that's around
[1:38:54] the ungodly are not so but are like the
[1:38:56] chaff of the wind driven away therefore
[1:39:00] the ungodly shall not stand in judgment
[1:39:02] nor the sinners in the congregation of
[1:39:03] the righteous for the Lord knoweth the
[1:39:06] way of the righteous but the way of the
[1:39:07] ungodly Shall Perish amen God bless you
[1:39:10] let's Stand Together We Must abideen In
[1:39:14] God's
[1:39:16] process for the elect the chosen the
[1:39:19] called out the predestinated group to
[1:39:21] come into the image of Christ we must
[1:39:23] abide in the process to get there we
[1:39:26] can't say I have I have
[1:39:30] already received everything I need
[1:39:32] remember Paul said I haven't attained
[1:39:36] yet there's still more for me there's
[1:39:38] still there's got to be more thoughts of
[1:39:40] God that I got to receive more word that
[1:39:41] I got to
[1:39:43] receive I got to press in towards more
[1:39:47] of Christ so let's start with just
[1:39:50] considering our thoughts first are they
[1:39:52] of God and and capture the thoughts of
[1:39:54] God because they will lead us to where
[1:39:57] God is taking us to amen amen let's just
