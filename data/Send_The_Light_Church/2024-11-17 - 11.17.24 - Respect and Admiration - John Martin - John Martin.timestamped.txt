[3:44] you
[3:45] Lord
[3:47] I
[3:49] love
[3:51] you
[3:54] amen and it's brother Ron open in a word
[3:57] of prayer amen
[4:01] love
[4:57] amen amen you may be seated amen
[5:03] so I want you to
[5:05] feel that
[5:08] presence so when you come in the
[5:10] sanctuary that's why we come early and
[5:13] pray
[5:15] because this is a sacred
[5:18] place and every part of the service is
[5:22] sacred and whether you're
[5:24] doing songs or your leading songs or
[5:28] you're doing a special or you're praying
[5:31] over the
[5:34] service it's a very special
[5:36] thing and Satan is always looking for
[5:39] just a little crack where he can slip in
[5:43] and cause confusion and raise questions
[5:48] and do terrible
[5:52] things so we saw that
[5:55] Wednesday and my motive even no matter
[5:59] how much you pray there's always he's
[6:02] looking for a little sliver just a
[6:04] little
[6:05] place so I just want to say I'm sorry
[6:10] that I cause confusion and rais
[6:12] questions and
[6:13] doubts that's not my motive or my ideas
[6:18] or so I just want to ask everyone all of
[6:22] you to forgive
[6:24] me
[6:26] and that's
[6:28] just it's something that that's the
[6:30] reason why it's so important to come and
[6:36] pray but that's not a guarantee either
[6:40] you have to Be
[6:42] watchful he said Be watchful he says for
[6:45] your adversary who's not your brother or
[6:48] your sister but your adversary the devil
[6:52] he sneaks around you know a roaring lion
[6:55] the if he yells he's already got you cuz
[6:59] you're not going to
[7:00] move you know anything about
[7:03] lions so please pray for Brother John
[7:07] and anyone the song leaders all of us
[7:09] that have a part in the
[7:11] service because things can
[7:15] just go where you don't want them to
[7:19] go my heart was distressed beneath
[7:22] Jehovah's dread
[7:26] frown my heart was distressed sne
[7:30] Jehovah's dread frown and low in the pit
[7:35] where my sins drag me down I cried to

[39:38] want to entitle this message respect and
[39:42] admiration respect and admiration and
[39:44] we're going to just take our opening
[39:46] text here in Mark 12 starting with verse
[39:48] number
[39:49] [Music]
[39:50] 13 and they send unto Jesus certain of
[39:55] the Pharisees and of the heronian to
[39:58] catch him in his
[40:01] words and when they were come they said
[40:04] unto him Master we know that thou art
[40:06] true and carest for no man for thou
[40:10] regardest not the person of men but
[40:13] teaches the way of God in truth is it
[40:17] lawful to give tribute to Caesar or
[40:20] not and shall we give or shall we not
[40:25] give but he know knowing their
[40:28] hypocrisy said unto them why tempt ye me
[40:33] bring me a penny that I may see it and
[40:38] they brought it and he saith unto them
[40:41] who is this image and sub uh
[40:47] superscription and they said unto him
[40:49] Caesars and Jesus answering said unto
[40:53] them render to Caesar the things that
[40:56] are Caesars and to God the things that
[40:59] are
[40:59] gods and they marveled at him God bless
[41:04] you may be
[41:07] seated they
[41:10] marveled they saw
[41:14] respect they saw
[41:17] admiration even for Caesar who was the
[41:20] Emperor or the ruler of
[41:23] Rome now Jesus could have called out all
[41:26] the negative stuff
[41:27] that Caesar did we know we just read
[41:30] history that there was nothing there was
[41:32] so much cruelty and evil and persecution
[41:35] and and robbing and and they use people
[41:38] they murder people all for their own
[41:40] gain and they were allowed to do that
[41:41] because they their Emperor but Jesus
[41:43] chose not to say
[41:51] that he could have easily gave reason to
[41:54] not respect
[41:56] Caesar to not
[41:59] respect and not to have admiration but
[42:03] he said instead render to Caesar the
[42:07] things that are Caesars right amen I
[42:10] just I love that he wasn't trying to
[42:13] cause some
[42:15] problem you you and he could he's God
[42:18] he's the only one that Vengeance belongs
[42:20] to and be right about
[42:22] it but we see here the nature of God and
[42:27] that he he is he is a real
[42:30] gentleman at all times he's a real
[42:35] gentleman just because he used the whip
[42:37] he's still a
[42:39] gentleman
[42:41] amen just because he called certain
[42:43] people out he was still a gentleman but
[42:45] he's
[42:48] God and he I believe his wife has the
[42:51] same kind of respect that he does am now
[42:55] it doesn't mean the churches are
[42:59] but I believe God's wife is Jesus
[43:02] believed in submission to
[43:05] Authority Romans 13 says render
[43:08] therefore to all their dues tribute to
[43:10] whom tribute is due custom to whom
[43:12] custom Fear To whom fear honor to fear
[43:14] oh no man anything
[43:18] amen if
[43:21] somebody deserves if somebody needs to
[43:24] be honored then you you honor them if
[43:26] they need to be tributed if there's a
[43:29] custom you you give them what you know
[43:31] just come somebody comes up to you and
[43:32] smile what are you going to do frown at
[43:34] them you're going to smile back you're
[43:35] going to give back to
[43:37] them oh no man anything but in but to
[43:42] love one another right for he that
[43:44] loveth one another has fulfilled the law
[43:48] am I think about this this great subject
[43:52] the word respect is a feeling of deep
[43:55] admiration for someone
[43:59] and God is wanting us to have that and
[44:01] it's really hard to find that sometimes
[44:02] when you're fighting with
[44:04] somebody or you don't believe in
[44:06] something that they're doing admiration
[44:09] is to feel respect and approval for
[44:11] someone and it's hard to do that when
[44:13] you really have a problem with somebody
[44:15] but there's always something that you
[44:17] can
[44:18] find here's an example I found in the
[44:21] dictionary I've always admired her for
[44:23] her generous spirit
[44:27] I admire his courage and
[44:30] determination so if you could look at
[44:32] the
[44:33] things that are
[44:36] good and not allow the things that are
[44:38] bad to stand in front of you because
[44:41] that's what gets us to a place where we
[44:43] begin to lose
[44:45] respect as soon as you lose respect you
[44:48] really lost it for yourself the very
[44:50] fact that you cannot you cannot find
[44:53] something with somebody is showing that
[44:55] you aren't because
[44:57] to the pure all things are
[44:59] pure right but to the evil and undefiled
[45:02] all they see is negative stuff that's
[45:03] there's a difference between a negative
[45:05] mindset and a positive mindset but we're
[45:08] not just going to go home and all of
[45:10] sudden be respectful and and and and and
[45:14] and give to everybody their dues if we
[45:15] don't determine that's what we need to
[45:18] do and so we we need to be here today
[45:21] with a with a a heart of humility and
[45:23] say God I want what you want me to be I
[45:26] don't want to do this because brother
[45:27] John's saying this but I really want to
[45:28] be your wife I really want to to to sit
[45:34] with you I want to I want to have that
[45:36] honeymoon with you I want to be with you
[45:39] because most of the church world isn't
[45:40] even thinking about they're not thinking
[45:41] about the rest they're not thinking
[45:42] about coming to the Statue of a perfect
[45:44] man or being in His image or being just
[45:46] like him they're not interested in that
[45:48] for some reason they're just looking to
[45:50] get
[45:52] by God is not going to grab a b a bride
[45:55] who's just getting by amen
[45:57] so you know it's our attitude that that
[46:00] needs to be sure it's
[46:02] important as most unconverted people are
[46:06] they have to find something that they
[46:08] think uh they're another person is
[46:11] worthy of before they're going to
[46:12] actually respect
[46:15] them that's how they that's how we're
[46:17] brought up you know well they were nice
[46:18] to me I'm going to be nice to them they
[46:20] respected me I respect to them they did
[46:22] this for me I'm going to do that for
[46:23] them you scratch my back I'll scratch
[46:25] your back that type of thing right
[46:27] amen but to the converted Soul you
[46:30] scratch some's back when they don't
[46:31] scratch
[46:32] yours you respect them when they don't
[46:34] respect you amen because you have a
[46:38] different Spirit about you
[46:41] amen acts 10 says that Peter opened his
[46:44] mouth and said of a truth I perceive
[46:46] that God is no respector of persons
[46:48] that's right but in every nation he that
[46:50] fearth him and worketh righteousness is
[46:53] accepted with him so notice no matter
[46:55] how how much a sinner is a sinner if you
[46:58] can just like say that
[46:59] statement No matter how bad we think
[47:02] somebody is all they need to do is turn
[47:04] towards God and God will accept
[47:06] them you know God does not look at
[47:09] people the way we look at
[47:11] people the Bible also teaches us to
[47:14] respect and honor others before we honor
[47:19] ourselves and in fact to even honor them
[47:22] more than we honor
[47:24] ourselves Philippians says let nothing
[47:27] be done through Strife let nothing be
[47:30] done through vain Glory but in a
[47:32] loneliness of our
[47:34] mind let each of us esteem the other
[47:38] person better than
[47:40] ourselves now you you just that that
[47:43] scripture does not apply to those that
[47:45] are better than
[47:46] you you understand this applies to
[47:49] everybody so that means you've got to
[47:51] hunt for the person you think is lower
[47:54] than you and esteem them amen
[47:58] look not every man on his own
[48:01] things take a
[48:03] minute for for you to look on the things
[48:06] of others so much we come to church and
[48:09] we want want want
[48:11] want how about come to church and help
[48:13] help help
[48:14] help because that's what it's really
[48:17] about that's what God's about he come
[48:19] here to help us amen imagine if we're
[48:21] all helping one another how happy we'd
[48:23] be
[48:25] amen coming to church CH and you want
[48:27] want want I don't know think about this
[48:30] there's only so much money to go around
[48:33] you can't help
[48:35] everybody right so everybody could come
[48:37] in and say you know I want 500 bucks
[48:40] today but you're going to run out you
[48:42] know after about a half a
[48:45] person but imagine everybody come in and
[48:47] said I want to
[48:49] give you understand how how this is how
[48:52] it
[48:53] works you can't outgive God you can't
[48:57] outr God but you can certainly fall into
[49:01] this self-righteous I I got everything
[49:05] figured out I know where everybody's at
[49:06] I know everybody's faults and flaws and
[49:08] problems and you know I'm the you know
[49:10] I'm not
[49:11] gonna carnal amen so
[49:16] carnal but Paul said let this mind be in
[49:20] you which was also in Christ Jesus so
[49:23] Jesus himself esteemed others better
[49:25] than himself amen he looked on the
[49:27] things of others and and and the thing
[49:29] is why would we leave here thinking to
[49:31] be any different because because we
[49:34] don't really come we're not really
[49:36] catching the message that God has called
[49:38] us to be like him am not just to to kind
[49:41] of know what this religion is but to
[49:45] have a relationship
[49:49] that
[49:51] imagine imagine you married
[49:55] somebody that they hated everything that
[49:59] you
[50:01] liked you you couldn't agree on what
[50:04] kind of car brand to get what kind of
[50:06] food to eat what kind of where to live I
[50:08] mean nothing just total agree
[50:11] disagreement now I'm going ask you a
[50:12] question would you want to be with that
[50:15] person would you want to choose that
[50:18] person God does not want to choose me
[50:21] because you know he thinks I'm you know
[50:23] different than him and special and you
[50:25] know I'm attracted to
[50:27] him no he wants to be with a spirit that
[50:30] he feels comfortable with
[50:33] amen as Spirit you know there are
[50:36] spirits that grieve the Lord amen he
[50:38] just feels uncomfortable with it so
[50:42] we're we're here today because we want
[50:43] to grow and be like Christ we want to be
[50:45] more respectful people we we want to
[50:48] have uh admiration for everybody not
[50:50] just certain ones in the church and then
[50:52] the others are real bad no we don't
[50:54] think like that amen because why don't
[50:57] we think like that because we have the
[50:59] mind of Christ
[51:02] amen and I'd rather have that mind than
[51:04] any
[51:07] mind last week we talked about David's
[51:09] Mighty Men had great admiration for
[51:11] their leader
[51:12] David they put their lives in danger
[51:15] just to get them a drink of water and
[51:17] yet at the same time um David David had
[51:21] the same admiration for his men and
[51:24] poured that water out and we can see
[51:26] here that this this this the set of
[51:30] scriptures that we read showed that
[51:32] there was no respect to persons David
[51:34] didn't put himself above his men right
[51:36] he didn't he felt Unworthy of his men
[51:39] that served him and we need to feel
[51:42] Unworthy of those that are underneath us
[51:46] yes come on the more we can get into
[51:48] this word you know the faster we can get
[51:49] it done unless you want have a part
[51:51] three you
[51:53] know Jesus said the greatest one that
[51:57] would be among us ought to be the ones
[51:59] that are serving the
[52:01] least the mindset serve serve right amen
[52:06] instead of exercising Authority he said
[52:10] exercise respect amen
[52:13] appreciation admiration high regard
[52:15] start exercising that I don't feel like
[52:18] it I'm not in the mood well you know get
[52:20] on your knees get the Holy Ghost get a
[52:23] hold of God get something in you that
[52:25] does you know God doesn't have to to try
[52:26] to respect am he doesn't have to force
[52:30] himself or get in a good mood or you
[52:32] know wake up on the right side of the
[52:33] bed he is what he is he said I am what I
[52:35] am and this is what he is amen we come
[52:38] here to find out where we're at in this
[52:41] honestly are we like
[52:44] him we left off in 1 Corinthians 12:24
[52:47] if you want to turn there 1 Corinthians
[52:49] 12:24 for our comely Parts have no
[52:53] need have no need but God have tempered
[52:56] the body together and give more abundant
[53:01] honor to the part which lacked right so
[53:06] when you look at your your your spouse
[53:08] you look at your children or you look at
[53:10] your parents or you look at your brother
[53:11] and sister or you look at your pastor or
[53:13] Pastor you look at your congregation and
[53:16] if you see them that are lacking it is
[53:20] your job to help them and the
[53:24] most in other words we should all be
[53:26] Busy Bodies helping one
[53:30] another not busy body getting in one
[53:32] another's business but busy helping
[53:36] those that would be least or
[53:39] lacking God is wanting more admiration
[53:43] more abundant honor given to the parts
[53:47] of the body that are
[53:50] needful honor well well they're not even
[53:53] doing their job admiration well they're
[53:55] not even act like they give
[53:58] it you don't you I'm not saying you get
[54:01] there and you put them on and you walk
[54:02] around for you know 10 days with horn
[54:04] saying this person is great this person
[54:06] is great but take a few minutes and
[54:09] honor
[54:10] them that's what the Holy Ghost would
[54:13] do that's what the word tells us to
[54:16] do well you know my feelings just don't
[54:19] feel like doing it you know if I'm not
[54:20] going to do it from my
[54:22] heart wonderful Get Your Heart Right
[54:26] amen that's great I love that I would
[54:28] you know I would God loves a cheerful
[54:30] Giver the thing is do you want to become
[54:33] the word or do you want to become some
[54:35] um uh fake right to me the denominations
[54:40] you I'm not talking about the people now
[54:43] but we got to get people to Christ to a
[54:45] relationship to a change
[54:48] nature verse 25 that they should be that
[54:52] there should be no schism
[54:56] in the body if I hear of one's
[55:01] gism I've got scripture to deal with
[55:05] it and to deal with it until it's
[55:09] out but that the members should have the
[55:12] same care one for
[55:15] another as soon as as soon as someone
[55:18] begins to care less about somebody you
[55:21] know what happens that opens the door
[55:23] for
[55:24] Schism now what that word really means
[55:27] it means uh no Schism means no splits in
[55:31] the church no gaps no divisions no tears
[55:35] or rents in the body
[55:40] none and other words you would not want
[55:44] me or anybody to come and take part one
[55:47] of your organs out of your
[55:50] body it needs to stay
[55:52] there and so whatever we think about
[55:56] somebody and we want to just kind of rip
[55:59] them out of our Circle brother B says
[56:00] draw a bigger Circle bring them in
[56:03] because this is the nature of Amen we're
[56:08] here because I want to be like
[56:12] Jesus I truly truly want to be like
[56:15] Jesus and whether one body suffers all
[56:18] the members suffer with it because
[56:20] there's that care or one member be
[56:23] honored then all the members Rejoice
[56:25] with it
[56:27] amen this is what is practiced by
[56:31] believers who are filled with the Holy
[56:35] Ghost because it's the nature of God now
[56:38] unbelievers don't practice this right
[56:41] make Believers practice it occasionally
[56:44] but usually what they got in mind is
[56:45] some
[56:46] Advantage are you with me but real
[56:49] Believers will practice this continually
[56:52] because they just love one another
[56:55] there's a spirit inside of them that
[56:56] just
[56:59] loves they have the spirit of God in
[57:02] them and it's just automatically they
[57:05] respect they have admiration they
[57:08] they're they're a thousand miles away
[57:10] from a respect to persons because God
[57:14] is and you know people want to claim I
[57:18] I'm a Christian I love God I want to be
[57:21] like God but they they look at this and
[57:23] they say I don't want to spend any time
[57:24] thinking about this right let's get on
[57:26] to something else okay you don't don't
[57:29] this a dead horse I mean it's like there
[57:32] ought to be a love inside of us for God
[57:34] that we want to be like him to be able
[57:38] to go through the fire and truly love
[57:42] somebody anybody can say yeah I love God
[57:45] and I got
[57:46] God but who who can love him enough to
[57:49] actually live
[57:51] it I mean don't you want that I want
[57:54] that I want to be so much in me that I
[57:56] could actually he said come by me go
[57:59] tried in the fire that's what I'm
[58:01] wanting I want about about tried in the
[58:04] fire and come
[58:06] out respect and admiration is of
[58:10] god even though God is the almighty one
[58:14] the one that inhabits eternity he
[58:16] humbled himself and still does today
[58:18] he's humbling himself today to serve us
[58:21] amen do you know that he is here to
[58:23] serve
[58:24] us he still condescending to Men of low
[58:28] estate his life has proved over and over
[58:32] he has respect and admiration and
[58:35] there's no respected person think about
[58:37] this he came to you didn't
[58:39] he that sums it up right
[58:42] there I wasn't worthy of him I'm I'm
[58:44] more Unworthy of him today than I was
[58:47] then because I failed
[58:50] him just like David and his
[58:54] men they had respect
[58:57] admiration for one another you know they
[58:59] literally served one another David's men
[59:01] served him and then David served as
[59:07] men Galatians
[59:09] 5:13 Galatians 5:13 for Brethren you and
[59:15] I have been called unto
[59:19] Liberty only use not Liberty for an
[59:24] occasion to the
[59:27] Flesh in other words use your
[59:32] Liberty by love to serve one
[59:37] another so think about that we live in
[59:43] America we can do what we want act like
[59:45] we want treat anybody like we want you
[59:46] got
[59:48] Liberty God's given you Liberty we're
[59:50] not under the
[59:52] law but some of us act like God hasn't
[59:54] written his law in our hearts
[59:56] right we take this Liberty and we use it
[59:59] for our fles I don't have to do this I
[1:00:00] don't have to I don't have to listen to
[1:00:01] you I don't have to do this I don't I
[1:00:02] don't got no
[1:00:05] headship using your Liberty for but he
[1:00:09] said use your
[1:00:12] Liberty to serve one

[1:00:18] prayer you came on my
[1:00:22] heart I just want to know if there's a
[1:00:24] special need I'm going to be praying for
[1:00:26] if not I'm just going to pray for you in
[1:00:28] general when's the last time you met God
[1:00:31] and God did
[1:00:34] that we shouldn't have
[1:00:36] to oh yeah call somebody and tell them
[1:00:39] you got a need let God speak it to you
[1:00:42] yes get that close to God Amen do you
[1:00:45] know Lucifer had been called to
[1:00:47] Liberty
[1:00:49] am he had Liberty but he used it for
[1:00:53] himself
[1:00:58] I don't want to have Liberty and use it
[1:00:59] for myself brother B said power without
[1:01:02] character is satanic and to me Liberty
[1:01:04] is a power that God has given us he I've
[1:01:06] given you this power now serve one
[1:01:08] another
[1:01:11] amen we shouldn't use it as an
[1:01:13] opportunity to appease our flesh but to
[1:01:16] serve one another honor one another
[1:01:18] respect one another admire one another
[1:01:21] esteem the other better than yourself
[1:01:23] verse 14 for all the law is fulfilled
[1:01:25] not in one word even this one word thou
[1:01:31] shall love thy neighbor as
[1:01:35] thyself we're so stuck on you know you
[1:01:38] know what before we ever got to church
[1:01:39] we're thinking about what we're going to
[1:01:40] do today amen what our plan
[1:01:45] is I'm going to do this I'm going to do
[1:01:48] that you can't hardly call somebody and
[1:01:50] say can you stop what you're doing just
[1:01:51] get on your knees and pray with me right
[1:01:53] now
[1:01:58] one word thou shalt Love Thy Neighbor
[1:02:00] because you would want somebody praying
[1:02:02] for you if you needed
[1:02:06] help God gave respect to the whole world
[1:02:10] when he died for the whole
[1:02:12] world he showed his respect and love to
[1:02:14] the whole world when he died he gave
[1:02:16] everybody a
[1:02:18] chance I think that's
[1:02:21] beautiful I think that's what he wants
[1:02:23] us to be amen
[1:02:27] we should give one
[1:02:29] another a
[1:02:30] chance every
[1:02:33] day every day never give up but what
[1:02:38] happens when you get into the flesh
[1:02:40] verse
[1:02:41] 15 but if you bite and devour one
[1:02:46] another take heed that you be not
[1:02:50] consumed of one another did you ever get
[1:02:53] in such a fight that you just kind of
[1:02:55] felt like
[1:02:56] [Music]
[1:02:59] nothing I mean yeah you're mad you're
[1:03:04] angry but you there was just nothing
[1:03:06] left over there was no care there was no
[1:03:09] love there was no respect there was
[1:03:11] nothing you just you're consumed I don't
[1:03:13] want
[1:03:16] you you're not my friend
[1:03:20] anymore how many times has some brother
[1:03:24] or some sister bothered you and you just
[1:03:28] kind of Drew a
[1:03:29] circle left them out of your circle some
[1:03:32] family member some neighbor some
[1:03:37] coworker and all the reason is it's not
[1:03:40] because they're how bad they are because
[1:03:43] you're missing the love right amen
[1:03:45] that's the only reason
[1:03:47] amen it you it's it's see you feel
[1:03:53] Justified when you put the blame on them
[1:03:57] amen
[1:03:59] but God would never put anything on you
[1:04:02] that you could
[1:04:03] bear he will always provide a way of
[1:04:05] escape and to me that way of Escape is
[1:04:08] be so full of God you walk in the in the
[1:04:10] spirit you not fulfill the lust of the
[1:04:12] flesh amen right right this I say then
[1:04:16] walk in the spirit and you shall not
[1:04:18] fulfill the lust of the flesh when we're
[1:04:21] truly walking in the Holy Ghost the
[1:04:24] ghost inside of you you will respect and
[1:04:27] express
[1:04:29] it but when you're walking and you are
[1:04:32] not respecting there is an evil ghost in
[1:04:37] you I'm say it there is an evil ghost in
[1:04:42] you has nobody put chains on you and
[1:04:45] made you say and act the way that you
[1:04:49] do or
[1:04:52] did there's a different ghost anointing
[1:04:54] you
[1:04:56] that's right the goal that should be in
[1:04:58] you is literally esteeming that person
[1:05:01] give him a soft answer it'll turn away
[1:05:03] the Wrath to start putting the word into
[1:05:06] practice into human flesh manifest it
[1:05:09] again
[1:05:11] amen that in our longing what is what
[1:05:15] are we looking for we're going to make
[1:05:17] peacocks here we're going to become
[1:05:19] perfect peacocks we're going to dress in
[1:05:23] search a way where people think we're a
[1:05:24] Christian but really we don't got the
[1:05:26] goods a form of
[1:05:29] godliness God help us to just what if
[1:05:32] this is a real simple message it's just
[1:05:33] called respect and have admiration for
[1:05:36] one
[1:05:37] another that's to me that seems like a
[1:05:40] simple thing to do and and not only does
[1:05:43] it seem simple to do it seems so minute
[1:05:47] to us that it doesn't seem to be that
[1:05:49] big thing that we should have to put so
[1:05:50] much attention to it but in reality it
[1:05:53] is the thing that has caused all of our
[1:05:55] problems S I don't care what what
[1:05:58] problem your is you're talking about
[1:05:59] that is what
[1:06:01] happens well brother John I I got car
[1:06:03] problems I got financial problems I got
[1:06:05] I am telling you most everything is
[1:06:07] because we lost respect somewhere and
[1:06:10] did not take care of
[1:06:13] things you know they used to say if
[1:06:17] uh you go to buy a
[1:06:20] house and they want to know how you keep
[1:06:22] the house they they they say look in
[1:06:23] their car am I saying that right look in
[1:06:25] their car and see how they kept their
[1:06:26] car and you're going to know how they
[1:06:28] kept their house is that a true
[1:06:29] statement you've heard of that in other
[1:06:32] words a person is a person who they
[1:06:34] are they they don't they don't just well
[1:06:38] over here I have disrespect but over
[1:06:39] here I have respect it don't work like
[1:06:41] that you you how you are is how you are
[1:06:44] that's right and that's why this is such
[1:06:46] an important message this morning that
[1:06:48] we we we we take upon
[1:06:52] ourselves a determination
[1:06:55] to begin to
[1:06:57] build respect in our own
[1:07:01] lives you you can't respect somebody if
[1:07:03] you don't respect
[1:07:05] yourself if you don't respect yourself
[1:07:07] enough to say I'm going to respect
[1:07:09] another person and you're going to find
[1:07:11] you're going to let Satan get in that
[1:07:13] crevice and show you some fault about
[1:07:16] somebody and give you a reason not to
[1:07:19] respect them at that moment what you're
[1:07:21] really doing is indicating that you
[1:07:23] don't have enough respect to stop The
[1:07:24] Devil Inside you that's the truth you've
[1:07:28] got to learn to respect yourself first
[1:07:31] amen respect one another in the fear of
[1:07:33] the Lord be subject one to another in
[1:07:35] the fear of the Lord Ephesians chapter 6
[1:07:38] verse one how many can say I love this
[1:07:40] message this
[1:07:42] morning amen there's something for all
[1:07:44] of us here we're going to get into it
[1:07:46] here Ephesians 61 children obey your
[1:07:49] parents in the Lord for this is right
[1:07:55] honor your father and your mother which
[1:07:59] is the first commandment with promise
[1:08:01] now that it may be well with you and
[1:08:05] that you may live a little longer in
[1:08:08] life than you would normally be
[1:08:10] living what what what a statement right
[1:08:13] there what a statement amen
[1:08:16] so when you obey what you're really
[1:08:19] doing is
[1:08:21] respecting
[1:08:23] yes you're honoring
[1:08:26] you're looking at your your father and
[1:08:28] your mother with admiration now this is
[1:08:31] really hard to do for a child because a
[1:08:34] child always looks at their parent in
[1:08:36] such a way that when they're told to do
[1:08:38] something that they're the bad guy right
[1:08:42] that that's it's it's the truth I mean
[1:08:44] at work the boss is the bad
[1:08:47] guy the pastor He's the bad guy the
[1:08:50] parents they're the bad guys you know
[1:08:51] who the good guys are the good guys are
[1:08:53] my friends you know hey Mom hey Dad you
[1:08:57] know they get to do it at their house
[1:08:58] why can't
[1:09:01] we but look at we're hearing the word of
[1:09:05] God we are not
[1:09:06] hearing an maybe an idea of a way to
[1:09:10] live we're hearing from God Almighty
[1:09:13] that's telling us to to honor our father
[1:09:17] and our mother and you do that by simply
[1:09:20] obeying don't question
[1:09:21] them do not question the decision that
[1:09:25] they made as if they're wrong because
[1:09:29] your feelings want it different amen the
[1:09:32] very fact that you would step into that
[1:09:34] arena is you've left respect and I'll
[1:09:36] just say this as parents parents you
[1:09:38] need to teach your children how to
[1:09:40] respect and I'm going to tell you how
[1:09:41] you do that you learn to respect
[1:09:43] them you show them how to respect you
[1:09:47] can't treat them like dirt and expect
[1:09:48] them to respect
[1:09:50] you it don't work like that verse four
[1:09:53] and ye fathers
[1:09:55] provoke not your
[1:09:58] children to getting upset to getting bad
[1:10:02] to angry and bothered to
[1:10:06] wrath a father has the
[1:10:10] capability of getting under the
[1:10:12] children's
[1:10:13] skin
[1:10:15] amen they've got to be careful how they
[1:10:17] handle situations they can't just say
[1:10:19] hey I told you to shut up you don't shut
[1:10:21] up I'm GNA throw you over
[1:10:23] there wow
[1:10:27] what did you just teach them what did
[1:10:29] you just teach them you taught them not
[1:10:32] to respect
[1:10:36] you so this is a real serious
[1:10:39] situation fathers provoke not your
[1:10:42] children to wrath but bring them up in
[1:10:45] the
[1:10:46] nurture in the admonition of the Lord so
[1:10:49] if you yell at them and you get angry
[1:10:50] and your your whole spirit is throwing
[1:10:52] them against the wall do you really
[1:10:54] think that's the nurture and admonition
[1:10:57] of the
[1:10:58] Lord no that's you being the boss of the
[1:11:00] home instead of God being the boss of
[1:11:02] the
[1:11:03] home look it is my desire that God is
[1:11:07] the head of this church but he will
[1:11:10] never be the head of this church unless
[1:11:11] I yield to him to be the head of the
[1:11:13] church same in your
[1:11:16] homes as much as you want God in your
[1:11:18] home he's not going to be the head of
[1:11:20] your home until you bring yourself under
[1:11:22] subjection to the word of God and then
[1:11:24] you allow him to be the head of your
[1:11:26] home and when he becomes the head of
[1:11:27] your home he can change the character of
[1:11:29] your
[1:11:36] family I believe that David and his men
[1:11:39] had this same
[1:11:42] relationship not provoking one another
[1:11:45] but nurturing them in the admonition
[1:11:47] because David he taught his unruly men
[1:11:50] how to serve God did you know that how
[1:11:53] to put God first he took a people who
[1:11:56] didn't want spent time with him and said
[1:11:59] he's the way he's going to be our refuge
[1:12:01] he's going to be our provider we read
[1:12:02] the Psalms we know David's testimony of
[1:12:04] God but he actually took time and
[1:12:07] parents we need to take time to get our
[1:12:09] children and really teach them and bring
[1:12:11] them up in the ammunition and we need to
[1:12:13] love God today in our home how is the
[1:12:15] last time you said that to your
[1:12:18] children you can't expect Church to do
[1:12:20] that you can't expect the 30 minute
[1:12:22] Bible study to do that it's a life
[1:12:25] that's lived in front of them you do it
[1:12:27] every time there's a problem they need
[1:12:29] to see Jesus Christ I love you Lord
[1:12:31] written all over your forehead yes how
[1:12:34] you handle things with your every
[1:12:36] situation well brother John you're like
[1:12:38] asking too much whoa whoa whoa whoa
[1:12:40] whoaa
[1:12:42] look do you want God in your life in
[1:12:45] your
[1:12:46] home or do you just want
[1:12:49] to have this distant relationship that
[1:12:52] you just want them for when you need
[1:12:54] them you want to be in that category of
[1:12:56] a thief and a
[1:12:58] robber I I really when I look at my
[1:13:02] children I already want them to become
[1:13:05] like
[1:13:07] Christ even when they're out of the Arc
[1:13:09] of
[1:13:10] safety right and they've already made
[1:13:12] that decision you know I just I don't
[1:13:14] feel like you know giving my all there
[1:13:17] all the more my heart wants
[1:13:20] them not just do some works and no but
[1:13:25] to really have a love for God Amen and
[1:13:29] so I'll say this to you that have
[1:13:31] children that are under
[1:13:32] 18 you're not going to have them
[1:13:35] forever you've only got a certain time
[1:13:38] to really bring them up in the
[1:13:40] admonition of the Lord don't wait till
[1:13:42] they're Hardy molded into some nature
[1:13:45] monstrous nature that you're not happy
[1:13:48] with take more time today to spend with
[1:13:51] them and I'll say it like this it's Pro
[1:13:53] you need to spend more time with than
[1:13:55] what you
[1:13:57] think it you're we're out of
[1:14:00] balance we think this is because I don't
[1:14:03] got time look they need
[1:14:05] you they don't got five sets of parents
[1:14:08] to choose from they need you bring them
[1:14:12] up in the nurture and the ammonition of
[1:14:15] the Lord don't provoke them just because
[1:14:19] you're their Authority you listen to me
[1:14:21] I'm going to teach you to listen to me
[1:14:26] accept their wrong accept their
[1:14:29] weakness learn how to help their
[1:14:32] condition their heart get into them well
[1:14:35] brother John I don't know what to do I
[1:14:36] just I don't know what to do well how
[1:14:38] about this let's start this how about if
[1:14:39] we get under our knees shut the door go
[1:14:41] pray and ask God can we do that first
[1:14:44] amen how do you expect God to help you
[1:14:46] with anything if you don't humble
[1:14:48] yourself before God well I don't got
[1:14:51] time for that I just want them to listen
[1:14:52] to I'm going to put the fear of God in
[1:14:54] them you know you're going to to put the
[1:14:55] fear of you in them you're going to
[1:14:57] teach them to manipulate and fear others
[1:14:59] to get what they
[1:15:03] want our goal should be to train them to
[1:15:07] teach them to nurture them to show them
[1:15:09] that God see son see daughter God is
[1:15:14] first in my life I put him there and
[1:15:17] this is what you need to learn to do too
[1:15:20] you're coming to the age you're going to
[1:15:21] be making decisions on your own and I'm
[1:15:24] just going to say like Paul said you
[1:15:26] follow me as I follow Christ you put God
[1:15:28] first in your life and God will bless
[1:15:30] you from
[1:15:31] there you just can't say you shouldn't
[1:15:33] do that you know this and you know
[1:15:35] better
[1:15:36] and you're not teaching them to respect
[1:15:39] you're not respecting
[1:15:42] them you know the children are God's
[1:15:44] inheritage they're not ours they belong
[1:15:47] to him God has made you a steward over
[1:15:50] them
[1:15:51] yes one day we'll answer
[1:15:56] don't just tell them they're wrong show
[1:15:58] how to help them couple of scriptures 1
[1:16:02] Timothy 5:17 let the elders that rule
[1:16:05] well be counted worthy of double honor
[1:16:11] oh boy
[1:16:12] double
[1:16:15] double I got to give twice as much
[1:16:19] especially they who labor in the word
[1:16:23] and Doctrine
[1:16:25] whoa chapter 6 verse one let as many
[1:16:29] servants as are under the Yoke Count
[1:16:33] Their Own Master worthy of all honor
[1:16:38] that's right that the name of God and
[1:16:41] his Doctrine be not
[1:16:44] blasphemed now most people who work for
[1:16:46] somebody have a problem with
[1:16:48] them that's just all there is to it
[1:16:55] but see you are a son and daughter of
[1:17:00] God and it don't matter how bad they
[1:17:04] are God has called you to represent him
[1:17:06] under that
[1:17:09] person and so you're supposed to
[1:17:12] honor all honor worthy of all
[1:17:17] honor all right 1 Peter chapter 2 turn
[1:17:20] with me there 1 Peter chapter 2:1 17
[1:17:22] we're going to put it up real important
[1:17:24] scripture here honor all
[1:17:27] men right this is the good one honor
[1:17:30] everybody honor all men love the
[1:17:32] Brotherhood fear God and honor the
[1:17:37] king honor means to
[1:17:41] prize that is to value or fix a value
[1:17:46] upon to
[1:17:48] Reverend you ever have somebody talk to
[1:17:51] you as if they had no they looked at you
[1:17:55] with no
[1:17:59] value and in 1 Peter 2 17 it says that
[1:18:03] you know we need to Value everybody all
[1:18:06] men
[1:18:08] am that means we have a hard job like
[1:18:11] with our children we have a hard job
[1:18:12] with oursel and it is find Value and
[1:18:15] other people find Value amen it
[1:18:18] shouldn't be hard one Souls Jesus said
[1:18:21] one Soul you could gain the whole world
[1:18:23] lose your soul every human being has a
[1:18:26] soul and God values that Soul at least
[1:18:28] one
[1:18:29] world right just according to the
[1:18:32] scriptures so you should better fix a
[1:18:35] value on that person because there's a
[1:18:36] soul inside of them you should have
[1:18:39] enough love of God in your heart that
[1:18:41] you could sit there being crucified by
[1:18:43] them and say father forgive them they
[1:18:45] don't know what they're doing that's
[1:18:46] right now you can't do that but God in
[1:18:48] you can do that he's the same yesterday
[1:18:50] today and forever and I'm here to
[1:18:52] testify God is alive amen God is
[1:18:56] alive so let's get to the place where we
[1:18:58] can love one another amen Jesus loved
[1:19:01] and honored
[1:19:05] Judas Jesus honored Judas to be The
[1:19:08] Treasure of his own church
[1:19:11] amen honored Judas with a power to
[1:19:14] remove the powers of the enemy out of
[1:19:16] other
[1:19:17] people he honored Judas with scriptural
[1:19:21] teachings sat in church as he taught his
[1:19:24] other dis
[1:19:25] disciples Judas was honored to be one of
[1:19:28] the 12 disciples he chose them Jesus
[1:19:33] loved and he honored Jesus Judas but
[1:19:35] what is Judas always remembered
[1:19:40] for
[1:19:43] betrayal but we need to fix our eyes on
[1:19:47] who the character of God really is Right

[1:19:54] going to be like
[1:19:56] Jesus I I just H you know brother Den I

[1:20:01] to believe that I could be like Jesus

[1:20:06] to figure out how to do it I just don't
[1:20:09] I am pretty dumb but I just have this
[1:20:13] belief that Christ in me can come out of
[1:20:17] me Christ in me can come out of me that
[1:20:21] I could I could on he prepares a table
[1:20:23] before me in the presence of my enemies

[1:20:31] portray me at the very end
[1:20:36] amen we need to learn to honor and have
[1:20:39] admiration for every human being amen
[1:20:43] and that's what the Holy Ghost does
[1:20:44] inside of believers they practice that

[1:20:50] gonna do it no do it try it fall get up

[1:20:56] two weeks and say you know what I'm here
[1:20:58] today because I started trying two weeks
[1:21:00] ago the problem is we're just waiting
[1:21:03] for some feeling to happen what needs to
[1:21:04] happen is a faith inside of us that we
[1:21:06] believe the word that's being preached
[1:21:08] to us that it's not the word of a man
[1:21:11] but it's a word of God and it's finding
[1:21:13] a hiding place inside of
[1:21:16] us Verse 18 servants be subject to your
[1:21:20] own
[1:21:21] masters with all
[1:21:23] fear not only to the good and the gentle
[1:21:26] to the good guys but also to the forward
[1:21:30] they got a mouth on
[1:21:31] them you ever work for
[1:21:34] somebody who you thought they were not
[1:21:37] worthy to be reverenced with all
[1:21:41] fear oh yeah fact you talked about that
[1:21:45] person to
[1:21:46] somebody because you didn't know how to
[1:21:48] handle it and I'm telling the word's
[1:21:49] telling you how to handle
[1:21:52] it it's not your job justy them
[1:21:55] out it's your job to demonstrate Christ
[1:21:58] to them under that
[1:22:01] atmosphere you don't have to wait till
[1:22:03] they straighten up and respect you and
[1:22:05] honor you and look at you and say you're
[1:22:06] the greatest thing send sliced bread
[1:22:07] before you decide to respect
[1:22:11] them anybody can do that
[1:22:15] publicans they can do that shake hands
[1:22:18] with those that agree with
[1:22:21] them how about being punched in the face
[1:22:25] would you turn the
[1:22:27] cheek you know what I'm
[1:22:31] saying respect and admire not just the
[1:22:35] good and the gentle but those that got a
[1:22:37] mouth on
[1:22:38] them you ever you know I've been so
[1:22:44] accused because I respect people I've
[1:22:46] been accused because people think I
[1:22:49] don't know who they
[1:22:51] are you let them use you you're blind
[1:22:55] you're just so
[1:23:00] naive what they do to
[1:23:03] Jesus he could have prophesied every bad
[1:23:06] thing they did when he was
[1:23:10] blindfolded God is calling us to be like
[1:23:12] him I I just had this desire I want to
[1:23:14] be like Jesus and I'm so glad that
[1:23:16] there's nothing that's standing in the
[1:23:17] way from that
[1:23:20] happening you just got to get away from
[1:23:22] well brother John they're not treating
[1:23:23] me well it just does something gets
[1:23:25] under my
[1:23:27] skin you know what needs to happen under
[1:23:30] your skin is get little the Holy Ghost
[1:23:32] into that
[1:23:33] skin because that will take care of the
[1:23:36] other thing that's under your skin amen
[1:23:38] verse 19 for this is thankworthy
[1:23:41] if a man for conscience towards God his
[1:23:46] conscience is for God towards God he
[1:23:49] endures grief suffering
[1:23:52] wrongfully and we I hope you understand
[1:23:54] what this scripture means that means you
[1:23:56] just been accused of stealing $1,000 out
[1:23:58] of the
[1:23:59] church and they came to you and they
[1:24:01] just started accusing you you stole
[1:24:04] $1,000 and you really didn't you didn't
[1:24:07] know $1,000 were there but you're being
[1:24:10] accused of it are you going to be the
[1:24:12] type of person that walks out I'm never
[1:24:14] going to step front of that church again
[1:24:16] I can't believe they accus
[1:24:22] me or are you going to endure that grief
[1:24:28] suffering wrongful in other words you're
[1:24:30] trusting that God is going to really
[1:24:32] prove this
[1:24:34] out you know what that takes it takes
[1:24:36] love because love is patient it's
[1:24:40] longsuffering it's not about proving
[1:24:42] anything it's about living the light
[1:24:44] that everybody can see we written
[1:24:46] Epistles read of all men this man is
[1:24:49] living the word this man is not this man
[1:24:52] this woman is demonstrating the power
[1:24:54] CHR this man is demonstrating the power
[1:24:56] of the flesh that's
[1:24:58] it it's not about tricking or hiding
[1:25:01] it's about being real and you know we
[1:25:03] ain't got much time to get ready we must
[1:25:06] just take advantage of this time verse
[1:25:08] 24 what glory is it if when you're
[1:25:12] buffeted for your
[1:25:14] faults and you take it
[1:25:19] patiently yeah you're right
[1:25:25] but and anybody can do that right yeah
[1:25:28] you're right I did take the last cookie
[1:25:30] and I should asked
[1:25:33] first but if when you're accused of
[1:25:36] taking the last cookie and you
[1:25:39] didn't but if when you do well and you
[1:25:42] are suffering as if you didn't and you
[1:25:46] take it patiently this is what is
[1:25:49] acceptable with God Amen
[1:25:55] and I want to be accepted of
[1:26:00] God honor
[1:26:05] amen it's completely in order to respect
[1:26:08] those that don't respect you it's
[1:26:13] completely admirable to go ahead and be
[1:26:16] accused by somebody knowing you're right
[1:26:19] and don't treat them bad I'm telling you
[1:26:21] you know what this is a gospel and if
[1:26:23] this hurts let it hurt because this is
[1:26:26] the word of
[1:26:28] God the problem is we don't have any
[1:26:31] desire we're not even thinking about
[1:26:32] being this amen and we should have this
[1:26:35] yearning every day God shine Through Me
[1:26:38] Shine through me let me be a light to
[1:26:39] the world Amen how how else are we going
[1:26:42] to be a a
[1:26:43] lighthouse what we need to be shining is
[1:26:46] the life manif the word manifested in
[1:26:48] the flesh not just quoting the
[1:26:50] scriptures and we need to be a light to
[1:26:52] oursel us in God in that prayer room and
[1:26:56] we need to be a light to our family and
[1:26:57] our homes am and we need to come here
[1:27:00] and help the body of Christ amen and
[1:27:03] then we go out and bring others in verse
[1:27:06] 21 for look here's your calling for even
[1:27:10] here un two were you
[1:27:13] called because Christ also suffered for
[1:27:15] us leaving us an example that we should
[1:27:17] follow his steps in other words Christ
[1:27:18] did not do anything wrong and he
[1:27:20] suffered for us he suffered wrongfully
[1:27:26] who did no
[1:27:28] sin neither was guile found in his mouth
[1:27:31] he didn't have to give the last word
[1:27:33] before he walked
[1:27:35] out who when he was reviled he he
[1:27:38] reviled not again when he suffered he
[1:27:41] didn't threaten I'm going to tell
[1:27:44] you this is your last
[1:27:47] warning but he committed himself to
[1:27:52] God he's the one that judge
[1:27:57] righteously who his own self bear our
[1:28:00] sins in his own body on the tree that we
[1:28:02] being dead to sin should live unto
[1:28:06] righteousness and by whose Stripes we've
[1:28:09] been
[1:28:10] healed for we were as sheep gone
[1:28:15] astray but now we return to unto the
[1:28:18] shepherd and the bishop of our souls we
[1:28:20] were sheep that just
[1:28:24] trying to justify every bad action that
[1:28:27] we
[1:28:28] do blame it on somebody
[1:28:33] else just wandering thinking that we're
[1:28:36] better and Jesus says you know what
[1:28:38] there's none good none you must just get
[1:28:40] that thing straight you need to return
[1:28:42] back to the bishop of your soul let God
[1:28:45] be the head of your
[1:28:49] soul in your patience possess you your
[1:28:52] souls that's right you got to let God in
[1:28:55] the nature of your of your
[1:28:58] life you if you don't have a desire for
[1:29:01] more of God don't worry you're not
[1:29:03] getting
[1:29:05] it brother B says well you know I don't
[1:29:08] believe in that I don't
[1:29:11] I I I'm not I I don't believe in that
[1:29:14] don't worry you're
[1:29:15] not be it unto you according to your
[1:29:18] faith now I'm just saying to you he is
[1:29:20] coming back for somebody that's in His
[1:29:22] image amen and we don't we we can't just
[1:29:24] wait here to a Rapture Day and say oh

[1:29:27] come to the church I'm going to be in
[1:29:29] his his image it don't work like that we
[1:29:31] have an opportunity every day to to to
[1:29:34] draw closer to him to to try how to
[1:29:36] crucify the flesh to deny ourselves and
[1:29:39] say God I really want to be like you I
[1:29:41] want to cry out to
[1:29:43] you and God sees that says that's what
[1:29:46] I'm looking for that's what I'm looking
[1:29:49] for somebody who fears and respects and
[1:29:52] honors my word amen that knows that's
[1:29:55] the kind of that's the kind of man I am
[1:29:59] and to him will I Look to Him will I
[1:30:03] give of my spirit he's not going to

[1:30:11] them all right how are we doing on
[1:30:16] time see we're um you know what we're in

[1:30:30] more oh this is this is a long
[1:30:38] one just try to go through these quick
[1:30:40] here First Peter chapter 3 again first
[1:30:43] Peter is such a good one if you really
[1:30:47] really want to know about the nature of
[1:30:49] God
[1:30:51] Amen 1 Peter chapter 3 vers verse one I
[1:30:54] really want to get to this one because
[1:30:56] you know I want to talk to you know the
[1:31:00] wies on this you know what I'm
[1:31:02] saying likewise ye wives be subject to
[1:31:05] your own husband that if any obey not
[1:31:08] the word they also May without the word
[1:31:10] be won by the conversation of the wives
[1:31:13] now this is your
[1:31:15] behavior your behavior your behavior
[1:31:18] needs to be according to the gospel that
[1:31:21] when your husband who is not really be
[1:31:24] fully engaged with God sees the
[1:31:28] way that you handle yourself according
[1:31:32] to the word that they become pricked in
[1:31:35] their
[1:31:37] heart whoa there's a gospel being lived
[1:31:40] in front of
[1:31:46] me while they behold your chased
[1:31:50] conversation your chased behavior that
[1:31:54] that that word conversation means
[1:31:56] Behavior innocent modest clean pure
[1:32:00] perfect coupled joined together with
[1:32:04] respect and admiration and fear when
[1:32:07] they see that you have this I could be
[1:32:10] wrong but I see the Bible is telling me
[1:32:13] to do
[1:32:16] this anybody can say nobody's going to
[1:32:18] tell you're not going to treat me like
[1:32:21] that what is your belief
[1:32:24] what is your
[1:32:25] belief it's not the
[1:32:28] gospel see it's not the gospel the
[1:32:30] gospel tells us what the true gospel is
[1:32:33] amen search the scriptures Amen in them
[1:32:37] you think you have eternal life but they
[1:32:39] are they that testify of the nature of
[1:32:42] God and we're reading it right here
[1:32:45] who's adorning let it not be after the
[1:32:48] outward adorning the plating the hair
[1:32:49] and the wearing of the gold or the
[1:32:51] putting on the Peril but let it be the
[1:32:53] hidden man of the
[1:32:54] heart in which is not
[1:32:58] corruptible even the ornament of a Meek
[1:33:01] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[1:33:03] of God a great price you ever think
[1:33:05] about that I mean you go to the store
[1:33:07] and you buy outfits and you buy things
[1:33:09] and you want to wear these and you want
[1:33:10] the best shoes and you got all those
[1:33:12] things that you want to have right to
[1:33:14] you you treasure what you have you ever
[1:33:16] wonder what God really
[1:33:19] Treasures what's a great price to
[1:33:21] him it's the spirit that's right that's
[1:33:25] why the prophet said I'd rather have the
[1:33:26] right Spirit yes amen because it's a
[1:33:29] great
[1:33:31] price the the right spirit will lead
[1:33:34] anything that's wrong back to where it
[1:33:36] needs to
[1:33:39] be it's not about proving who's right
[1:33:42] and wrong it's about having a right
[1:33:43] Spirit and the right spirit is it's it's
[1:33:46] a respectful Spirit a it's it's
[1:33:49] admirable when you got a right Spirit
[1:33:52] you you can't but nothing respect that
[1:33:54] for most times unless you're so
[1:33:57] over if unless the devil's really on
[1:34:02] you verse five for after this manner in
[1:34:05] Old Time the holy women also who trusted
[1:34:07] in God they adorned themselves being
[1:34:09] subject unto their own husbands even as
[1:34:11] Sarah obeyed Abraham calling him
[1:34:15] Lord whose daughters you are as long as
[1:34:18] you do well and are not afraid with any
[1:34:21] amazement in other words Trust
[1:34:27] God I would never tell my wife trust
[1:34:33] me anybody that knows me I don't say
[1:34:36] those words trust me you
[1:34:43] it trust God Amen he's the one that will
[1:34:47] never fail
[1:34:52] amen all right
[1:34:54] verse seven wives you can take a break
[1:34:56] now this is where you say
[1:34:58] Amen likewise you
[1:35:01] husbands dwell with them according to
[1:35:06] knowledge well my my my wife's you know
[1:35:09] she's just you
[1:35:11] know kind of you know
[1:35:17] local dwell with them according to
[1:35:21] knowledge I don't care what knowledge
[1:35:23] know that we have about our
[1:35:25] wives I love what it speaks here give
[1:35:29] giving honor unto the wife
[1:35:33] yes so no matter what you think it
[1:35:37] doesn't say that certain wives get honor
[1:35:39] and some
[1:35:41] don't all wives get
[1:35:44] honored and it is the Perpetual
[1:35:47] responsibility of the husband to give
[1:35:50] the wife honor amen
[1:35:54] dwell with them according to knowledge
[1:35:58] giving honor unto them well they're not
[1:36:01] acting
[1:36:04] right that doesn't matter it doesn't
[1:36:07] matter they deserve to be honored right
[1:36:11] and and I'll tell you this we need to
[1:36:13] start treating our wives the way we want
[1:36:16] them to
[1:36:17] Live come on I got I should have got the
[1:36:20] whole church to say Amen to that one we
[1:36:22] need to treat our wives the way way we
[1:36:24] want them to
[1:36:26] be you know God treats you the way he
[1:36:28] wants you to be
[1:36:30] amen he says I forgive you you're clean
[1:36:33] you're washed you're
[1:36:37] pure he doesn't do that so you could
[1:36:39] just you know keep doing
[1:36:46] it giving honor unto the wife as unto
[1:36:50] the weaker vessel it's understandable
[1:36:52] they're not upward you're
[1:36:54] at but you still honor them as being
[1:36:58] heirs together of the grace of God that
[1:37:01] your own personal prayers be not
[1:37:03] hindered that's right yes in other words
[1:37:07] God's watching how you're treating your
[1:37:09] wife
[1:37:10] amen how you're honoring her amen you
[1:37:15] honor her and support
[1:37:19] her or do you just call her blah blah
[1:37:22] blah blank blank
[1:37:26] blank how can we expect God to hear our
[1:37:30] prayers for our children or anything if
[1:37:34] our prayers are being
[1:37:36] hindered all because of the way that
[1:37:38] we're treating our
[1:37:44] wives let's respect them weaker vessel
[1:37:48] let's respect them let's let's let's
[1:37:51] honor them let's have admiration for our
[1:37:56] wives amen John amen John amen John uh
[1:38:00] I'm going to start I don't I'm not an
[1:38:01] amen my own self but you know right now
[1:38:03] I need to because I just didn't hear any
[1:38:05] amens and I I that's the word of
[1:38:08] God all right finally be of one
[1:38:13] mind husband wife having compassion one
[1:38:16] for another love his Brethren be pitiful
[1:38:19] be courteous not rendering evil for evil
[1:38:22] or railing for railing in a contr a
[1:38:25] blessing when somebody's being evil give
[1:38:27] them a blessing amen when they're reved
[1:38:29] give them a blessing knowing that you
[1:38:31] are there unto call that you should
[1:38:34] inherit a blessing and I'll say a
[1:38:35] blessing from
[1:38:36] God you be the first one to be mature
[1:38:40] knowing you're doing the right thing and
[1:38:42] God will bless you for that we are
[1:38:44] called to respect people who do not
[1:38:46] respect us that's a high
[1:38:48] calling but that's what we're called to
[1:38:51] so we need to learn to grow in respect
[1:38:53] for one
[1:38:54] another that when
[1:38:57] people we feel don't deserve it just
[1:39:00] respect
[1:39:01] them because there's a spirit that gets
[1:39:04] on us that doesn't want to respect
[1:39:08] them and that's because we got a spirit
[1:39:11] of
[1:39:11] Pride that's the only thing we think
[1:39:14] we're better than them like did God
[1:39:16] never made you better than anybody
[1:39:19] you're not better than
[1:39:21] anybody but when you humble yourself you
[1:39:25] realize you're not better than anybody
[1:39:26] then you can respect others when you're
[1:39:28] not being
[1:39:30] respected all right Jesus said to love
[1:39:33] our enemies to bless them that curse
[1:39:35] curse us and and and and to pray for
[1:39:38] them that displate F use us so he showed
[1:39:40] us him own self how to respect others
[1:39:43] that are not respecting Us by calling
[1:39:44] them their enemies and even the prophet
[1:39:46] said get to the place where you can love
[1:39:49] everyone even your enemies and I wonder
[1:39:51] who's even working on that I wonder
[1:39:53] wonder who's even working on
[1:39:55] that we think that's going to happen
[1:39:58] because well you know Sunday I'll come
[1:40:00] to church Wednesday I'll come and it's
[1:40:01] no it don't happen like that when you
