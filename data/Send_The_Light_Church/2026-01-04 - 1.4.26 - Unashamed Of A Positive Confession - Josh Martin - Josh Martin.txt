Please don't turn him [singing] away. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Without him how lost I would be. Without him I would be dying. [singing] Without him I'd be enslaved. Without him, I would be hopeless. But with Jesus, thank God, I am saved. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. [singing] Do you know him today? Please don't turn him [singing] away. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. [singing] Without him how lost I would be.

Please don't turn him away. Oh Jesus. Oh Jesus. Without him how lost I would be. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah. I'd be lost. You know when it says don't turn him away. I'm guilty of that. We all need prayer. That's why we have amazing grace. Amen. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved [singing] a ranch like me. I once was lost but now I'm found. Was blind [singing] but now I see. It was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieve. How preious did that grace appear the hour I first believe. [singing] Through many dangerous toils and snares I have already come. His grace had brought me safe thus far. And grace will lead me home. When we've been there 10,000 years, bright shineing as the sun, we've no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Hallelujah. You know that's my eternal song. Amen. Well, I just like to change your order of service. Amen. But once again, I'd like to thank everybody for coming. How many is looking forward to the new year? Amen. You know, like I I I was commenting to brother John this morning. I says, "I'm one day closer. One day older, but I'm one day closer to him." That's I'm excited about that. &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, let's just remember all those that aren't here. Amen. With sicknesses going around and everything else like that, let's just keep them in our hearts and our our prayers. Amen. Uh we're having a just a quick announcement here. Um see, Brother John sitting up here, which you all probably didn't know. We have Josh Martin's going to be um doing the service for us today. And I pray that uh through this next part of the service, you just ask God to just prepare your heart for the word and I believe God will meet you where where you are. Amen. So, let's just keep that in our hearts. Amen. also for the Christians in Iran uh for God's protection for them. Uh there's a lot of persecuting going on. Um but God's doing wonderful things too. You know, sometimes we have to go through the fire of uh refinement, but God's always true to his word. Amen. Also, let's uh just remember that there's the new calendars are out there on on the glass counter for the new year. and um just to grab one, grab it to somebody, use it as a uh tool to just testify and um you know, share the gospel. I mean, we don't have we don't have much time left. So, let's use the time wisely. And I think that's uh we just had a service on wisdom and I I believe that is probably one of the wisest things we can do. So, let's just remember that. Uh, let's just stand. Amen. Uh, before we go in prayer, I just uh I know we're welcome to see our brother Marty here with us. Uh, especially Charlie. Amen. And all those that's come this morning. Um, brother Marty, could you uh just give us a good word of uh testimony there? &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, let's give the Lord the credit for that one. And also your prayers, right? So God works on the behalf of his people and we just pray that uh you know through the course of this new year that we can just give him more credit because he's he's worthy. I mean we're here, right? Every every second we breathe. So, let's just remember all those that are live streaming this year. And uh just pray that uh God would bless him also. And uh obviously u Jonathan's not here. I don't know if he's sick, but let's just lift him up in prayer. Lift all those up in prayer. Our sister Linda, our brother Ben, everybody else that's not here. Uh Sister Elizabeth, uh Murphy, amen. Just all those that are in need. And um even sometimes when you're not in need, you're in need. I'm always in need of him. So let's just go on one behalf and take these things to the Lord. Dear heavenly father, Lord, as we come before you this morning, Lord, we thank you, Lord, that Lord, we have another day of opportunity, Lord, to just lift your name up above the heavens to Lord, just submit ourselves to you, Lord, to make a a Lord, just a desire in our hearts, Lord, to draw closer to you, Lord.

If I live a holy life, shun the wrong and do the right, I know the Lord will make a way for me. Hallelujah. [snorts] I pray you have that revelation this morning. Amen. When the redeemed are gathering in. Hallelujah. I am thinking of a rapture in this blessed home on high. When the redeemed [singing] are gathering in. I will raise a heavenly anthem in that city in the sky when the redeemed [singing] are gathering in. Hallelujah. Oh, when the redeemed are gathering in, washed like snow and free from all sin. How we'll shout and how we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in. [singing] There will be a great possession over around the streets of gold when redeem [singing] are gathering in. Oh, what music what singing over in the in their ro when the redeemed [singing] are gathering in. When the redeemed, oh when the redeemed are gathering in, washed like snow and free from all sin. I will shout and how we'll sing when the redeemed [singing] are gathering in. Saints will sing redemption story with their voices clear and strong. When the redeemed are gathering in then the angels will be listening for that cannot sing that song when to redeem our gathering in. Let's stand this morning. When the redeemed are gathering in, washed like snow and free from all sin. [singing] I will shout and I will sing. When the redeemed are gathering in, then the Savior will give orders to prepare the banquet board when the redeemed are gathering in. [singing] And we'll hear his invitation. Come ye blessed of the Lord. When the redeemed [singing] are gathering in. When the redeemed are gathering in, washed like snow and free from all sin. How will we shout [screaming] and how we'll sing when the redeemed are gathering in? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I [applause] can't wait. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise [cheering] God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Thinking about we're all going to be marching in. And we're going to be free from sin. And brother Brandham told us that sin was unbelief. We're going to be free from all unbelief. And I'm so glad today that we can be in the house of God with faith in the word of God as it is our absolute. And it's not just God's absolute, but it's our absolute as well. And the more that we can believe, the more our nature gets changed. And and that's what's going to put us in a rapture is a is a completely born again experience. And that is a changed nature. Amen. Um, how many here today um wants to put forth a greater effort to see that change in 26 than in 25. It just seems to be a little bit of more of a desperation. Um, I think we're I think we're feeling closer to the coming of the Lord and rightly so. I think it's put inside of uh the believer to get ready. there's something inside of him. You know, no man knows the day or the hour, but you you know, Jesus told us about the season and sensing. So, I believe that he's calling us. I'm Well, I'm excited um to have brother Josh Martin with us today. He was supposed to be here next Sunday, but he's going to Nicaragua two weeks from yesterday. And he asked if he could just change it. and we just of course um so it's a little sooner than we anticipated and we've just um we're just have been blessed by the ministry that he has been giving us so far as he's come. &gt;&gt; It's been uh encouraging. It's been right in line with the message in the word and um I'm just looking forward to the ministry of the word today and I'm looking forward to receiving it. &gt;&gt; Right. I want to go from my ears into my heart into a manifestation uh in the days to come. So let's um put our heart into receiving the word. Not not um not just saying a let's start with saying amen, [laughter] &gt;&gt; but let our heart just you know receive it. Amen. I hope everybody had a merry Christmas and uh uh and a very nice new year. I think this is a a good way to start the new year with this service today. Amen. Let's just sing Only Believe as Brother Josh Martin comes and gives us what God has put on his heart. Amen. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Only believe. All things are possible. Only believe. Lord, I believe. Lord, I believe. [singing] All things are possible. Lord, I believe. are receive. Lord, I receive [singing] all things. &gt;&gt; Lord, I receive. Lord, I receive. Lord, I receive. All things are possible. Lord, I receive. Amen. I trust that's your confession this morning. Lord, I receive. I don't want to just say I believe it and not receive it, but I want to receive it. Brother Brandham, he would he would tell us that if Christ was here in this suit and tie, he couldn't do nothing for you. He couldn't heal your body. And he would say, "How come?" Because he's already done it. And so, we're just receiving what he's already done for us there at Calvary. Are you thankful for the blessings of God that he's bestowed upon us? Has he been good to you? &gt;&gt; I trust y'all have had a a good year so far. We're just a few days in it, but the same Lord that was faithful last year, I believe is going to be faithful this year as well. If you would have your scriptures, Mark 8 and 38, just have a simple thought this morning, but I pray it'll bless you and encourage you in some way. It is good to be here this morning. Uh like like uh brother our pastor was saying uh we were supposed to be here in a in uh next week, but uh I'm be going to Nicaragua here pretty soon. So I had to move some things around. Um so I appreciate y'all allowing me to come this week instead. So I covered y'all's prayers when I go to Nicaragua. I'll be there for about 12 days. Be doing a youth camp and be ministering at some of the local churches there. So, we're praying that the Lord will bless the trip and and give us a a successful journey. And I bring greetings before I forget from my home church, brother Wendel Martin and the saints there, New Life Outreach, they send their greetings to y'all this morning. But Mark 8:38, the Bible would say, "Whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him also shall the Son of Man be ashamed, when he cometh in the glory of his father with the holy angels." Can we bow our heads this morning? Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, how grateful we are for your presence that we feel this morning, Lord. God, we're thankful for this opportunity that we've that you've given us, Lord, to come into your house and to to worship you, Lord. And we ask, God, that you would just feel welcome here among us, Father. Lord, we don't want to just invite you, but we want to make sure you feel welcome. We want to entertain your presence, Lord. We want to, God, make sure that, Lord, we open up our hearts, Lord, and our and our minds, Father. Whatever you would have for us this morning, we want you to have your perfect way, Father. God, you see this little thought that's upon my heart. I ask that you would anoint it. Father, may inspiration strike the heart. Father, we ask that there be a heart to receive what you have for us today in Jesus' name. Amen. You may be seated here this morning. Uh my my thought today would be unashamed of a positive confession. And I spoke a little bit on these lines when I was here a few weeks ago. So I hope I don't repeat myself uh too much this morning. But whosoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, I will be ashamed of him. And brother Brandon, he would put this as a present day scripture. And that's what I love so much about the message of the hour is he's letting us know where we are at today. Not something of the past or or necessarily something to come, but he was letting us know where we're at today. That God didn't just work in the past. And God ain't just going to work in the future, but God is working today in the individual lives of his children. And brother Brandon, he would tell us that that Noah's message wouldn't work for Moses's day and Moses message wouldn't work for when Jesus was upon the earth. And so it always takes a certain uh certain messenger or a message to pinpoint where we are today that that we're not worshiping under a place of yesterday, but it's a present day revelation that we can come and worship God. And and I believe this is a present day scripture where we don't have to be ashamed of what God has done for us in this generation. And brother Brandon would say, you notice there in the in the message ashamed, he says, you notice there's so much of that today, especially on the subject that I'm speaking of, ashamed of the word. Now, he and the word are the same. He says, "In the beginning was the word, and the word was with God, and the word was God. And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us, the same yesterday, today, and forever. So whosoever is ashamed of me and my word, and he and his word are one, so be being ashamed of his word in this sinful present generation." So he puts it a present day scripture and he's letting us know that being ashamed of Christ is being ashamed of his word. And and we're living in a time where it's easy to become ashamed of things. We're living in a in a day where where nobody nobody is satisfied. You know, nobody likes the way they look. You know, there's there's there's so many complexes in the in the world today that there's some that have complexes about being too short. Other ones have complexes about being too tall. You know, some is too white, some is too dark, some is some is too skinny, some is too chubby. It's complexes that that the devil puts upon us to make us unsatisfied with the way God has made us. And it's easy to become unsatisfied with the word that God has given us. And and we know what happens when you're unsatisfied with something. You begin to nitpick at it and you you try to find the faults in it. You try to find the the failures in it, you know. And and we're living in in a time if you don't like your blue car, you can get a black car if you don't like that. The black car, you can get a red car. And there's many options out there that if you're unsatisfied, there's options out there you can find. You know, some people their house is too small, so there's a bigger house for them. It's too big. There's a smaller house for them. But Jesus would tell us that that we're not to live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. So, while there's options out there naturally, God only gives us one option, that's the word of the Lord. And brother Brandon would tell us that the brightest, thus sayaith the Lord, or she keeps still. And that doesn't mean the Lord's going to prophesy through you. May maybe through a vision or something, but he's prophesying through you by the word that he's already sent you. You remember uh the Apostle John, he would be on the aisle of Patmas and he would get caught up in the spirit on the Lord's day and and he would see would start to see visions and things and when the book would become open he would hear a voice to tell John go take the book eat the book and what what would the voice tell him? Prophesy again which is your type John was a type of the believer in Christ. So the the voice wasn't telling John to have its own prophecies, but he's letting John know you're partaking of the book. And what you're eating of, that's going to be your confession. That's going to be what you will say. So I believe the bride is a prophetic group of people. Brother Brandon would say it's a prophetic class of people. And what that means is you have eyes to see what God is doing in the present generation. cuz we can see what God done through Noah. We can see what God done through through Abraham. And and that's what the Pharisees and the Sadducees would have. You know, God, we're the sons of Abraham. We're this and we're that. And here Christ would say before Abraham was, I am. So they could see what God was what God done, but could not see what God was doing. But I believe there's a prophetic group of people upon the earth that hasn't just seen what God can do, but they're seeing what God is doing today. And I believe that he is still the same yesterday, today, and and forever. The same God that could split the Red Sea for Moses is the same God that can split Red Seas in our spiritual walk. Brother Brandon would tell us that the natural seed of of Abraham would would would defy kingdoms. They would defy them that they would conquer fire. They would conquer water. But the spiritual uh people of Abraham might not be fighting a natural army or the Bible would tell us WE'RE NOT FIGHTING FLESH and blood, right? So we might not need a natural Red Sea split. But the SAME GOD THAT SPLIT the Red Sea for the natural people of Abraham is splitting spiritual Red Seas for the spiritual group group of children of Abraham. So we see what God is doing in this present generation. And I believe that the Bible would tell us that we're living in a time of famine. And the Bible would say in Amos 8:11, "Behold, the days come, saith the Lord God, that I will send a famine in the land, not a famine of bread, nor a thirst for water, but for hearing of the words of the Lord. And they shall run from sea to sea, from the north even to the east. They shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it." And what I think is so powerful about this scripture is whenever you think of a famine, normally you think of something uh you there's not enough food or you've ran out of water. So the resource that that you're needing is non-existent. And so there's a hunger because there's nothing there to to to give a to give food or to give water. But here the Bible is saying that this famine is a different famine. It's not for bread nor for water. And he in the Bible even say that the word of the Lord is going to be here. But this famine is they can't hear the words of the Lord. And here they are the wandering from sea to sea, from church to church, from from denomination to denomination looking for the word of the Lord, but they can't find it. And what I think is so incredible is brother Brandham would ask the question, are we sufficiently impressed with the word that is in our midst? In other words, ARE WE SATISFIED WITH IT? BECAUSE HERE, brother Brown, I mean, he would preach a word and and he wouldn't he wouldn't draw circles, but he would make bigger circles. He would preach for the the denominational brothers, but they would not have an ear to hear the word for the present generation. So they were seeking to and fro LOOKING FOR THE WORD, BUT YET THEY WAS NOT SATISFIED with the word that God had GIVEN THEM. BUT I BELIEVE THAT THE BRIDE IS SATISFIED with the word that God has given us IN THIS GENERATION BECAUSE WE'RE IN A FAMINE. It's either the word or it's nothing. And I believe this word has an authority to change lives. I I BELIEVE IT HAS AN AUTHORITY TO GIVE REVIVALS. IT HAS AUTHORITY TO TO SAVE REBELLIOUS CHILDREN. IT HAS AN AUTHORITY IF YOU'RE WILLING to be satisfied with it. And it's incredible because the Bible would tell us about a famine whenever whenever Ahab was the king. And you can look at first kings 18 and5. And Ahab said unto Oadiah, "Go into the land under unto all fountains of water, unto all brooks. pre-adventure we may find grass to save the horses and mules alive that we lose not all the beasts. It's incredible because while this is going on, uh the Elijah would be in a cave somewhere by the word of the Lord and he'd be getting food and brother Brown would say that food was his strength. And so while he WAS GAINING STRENGTH FROM THE WORD of the Lord here that the king Ahab was sending out his servants just in that word pre-adventure means a just in case or or happen that we might find grass. HE'S SENDING OUT HIS SERVANTS TO FIND life because his donkeys were dying, his mules were dying, his sheep was dying. In other words, the things that was important TO HIM WAS DYING BECAUSE it was a famine. And we're looking at at America today there. It's a they're claiming to be a Christian nation. There's there's a church on every CORNER ALMOST, BUT YET BUT WHAT'S IMPORTANT to them, THEIR CHILDREN are dying. The churches are dying. THE MARRIAGES ARE DYING. AND THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING. BUT YET, THE BRIDE IS SATISFIED WITH THE WORD OF THE LORD. And it's in A SECRET PLACE WITH ALMIGHTY GOD. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE because the Bible would tell us in Psalms 23 and two, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside still waters. So while Ahab, Hallelujah. So while Ahab was sending OUT HIS SERVANTS TO FIND WATER, SENDING OUT HIS SERVANTS TO FIND GREEN GRASS, HERE ELIJAH WAS IN A SECRET PLACE AND SO IS THE BRIDE. WHILE THE WHILE THE CHURCH world is LOOKING FOR THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATER, WE HAVE been we have been MADE TO LAY DOWN BESIDE STILL WATERS. WHILE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING THAT CAN FIX LIVES. WE HAVE BEEN LYING DOWN IN THE GREEN PASTURES OF THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD. SO WHILE THEY'RE LOOKING FOR SOMETHING, THE BRIDE HAS ALREADY FOUND IT. HALLELUJAH. WE'RE NO LONGER LOOKING, BUT WE ARE EATING AND ARE SATISFIED WITH WHAT GOD has given us. Because the Bible would tell us there in Joel 2 and 25, I will restore to you the years that the locust had eaten, the cankerworm, and the palmer worm, and my great army which are sent among you, and you shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied. And praise the name of the Lord your God, that have dealt wondrously with you, and my people will never be ashamed." I think it's incredible because while one prophecy is saying there's going to be a lack of hearing the word and it's a it's a famine, there's another prophecy saying we're going to eat in plenty. So, we're going to fall under one of those groups, right? &gt;&gt; I don't want to fall under the group that is unsatisfied with the word and looking FOR SOMETHING. I WANT TO be the one that is eating in plenty. And it's incredible how that the the prophet Joel, he will link being satisfied with not being ashamed. SO ONCE YOU'RE SATISFIED with something, YOU'RE NOT GOING TO be ashamed of it. You see, and that's WHERE THE DEVIL FIGHTS us many times is to get us UNSATISFIED WITH WHAT GOD has given us. To get us unsatisfied with the church God has given us or the or or the tapes God has given us. AND WHEN THAT HAPPENS, WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE UH WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE ASSURANCE of the word of the Lord to speak the word of the Lord. You see, I believe that the SPOKEN WORD IS INSIDE OF THE BRIDE TODAY THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE THE FINAL VOICE TO THE FINAL GENERATION. AND I BELIEVE that the WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD CAN TAKE CONTROL OF A PERSON THAT when you speak THE WORD OF THE LORD, GOD HONORS THAT WORD. BUT THE DEVIL'S what the devil's tactic is is to MAKE YOU UNSATISFIED WITH IT THAT YOU'VE GOT NO ASSURANCE TO SPEAK THE word of the Lord. Oh, hallelujah. Because if you think THAT GOD CAN'T HEAL, YOU'RE NOT GOING to speak the word of healing. Right? If you don't think God can save, you're not going to pray the the a prayer of salvation over your children or or pray that God fills THEM WITH THE HOLY GHOST if you don't think God can do it. BUT IF YOU'RE SATISFIED AND BELIEVE WITH AN ASSURANCE THAT GOD CAN DO IT, THEN THAT BECOMES YOUR CONFESSION THAT IT MIGHT LOOK HOPELESS, IT MIGHT LOOK BLEAK, BUT THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD SAYS MY CHILDREN CAN BE SAVED THAT THEY CAN BE FILLED WITH THE HOLY GHOST. THEN THAT BECOMES YOUR CONFESSION. HALLELUJAH. THAT BECOMES YOUR CONFESSION. INSTEAD of saying, "I don't know if it can happen. I don't know if God CAN DO IT." THAT DOES AWAY WITH THE NEGATIVITY AND IT BRINGS ON A POSITIVE WORD AND SAYS I KNOW GOD CAN DO IT. HALLELUJAH. FROM ME IN MY HOUSE. I'M GOING TO STAND UPON THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD BECAUSE I AM SATISFIED WITH IT. AND it's incredible because because this word is something we can eat upon. While the world is looking for something, we're being satisfied by the word of almighty God. And and the Bible would tell us in Matthew 24 and 28, for whoosoever the carcass is there, the eagles will be gathered together. And I think that's incredible because there's an attraction that comes with the word of the Lord. You know, we have uh we uh we we like to play basketball back home and we have some young young boys and some young adults that that likes to play ball and I'm still young myself. I'm only 27. So, I like to get out there and play basketball with them from time to time and and there's a group chat that they've got together and on that chat is only the ones that are interested in it, right? So, whenever somebody wants to play, hey, y'all want to play tonight or you want to play tomorrow night? AND IT SENDS OUT AN invitation to the ones who would be interested in it. You see, we we have a a brother at our church, Brother Torrance, and he's in his 80s, and and he's not on that group chat. you and I'm sure you WOULD KNOW WHY. THERE'S NO INTEREST IN PLAYING BASKETBALL, RIGHT? AND SO HERE THE BIBLE SAYS WHERE THE CARCASSES THERE, THE EAGLES WILL BE GATHERED TOGETHER. In other words, there's an attraction there BECAUSE THERE'S A SEED THERE. THERE'S A DESIRE THERE. AND SINCE THERE'S A DESIRE THERE, THE WORD IS GOING TO SATISFY THAT DESIRE THAT IS ON THE INSIDE OF THE BELIEVER. OH, HALLELUJAH. THAT'S WHY YOU MAY HAVE BEEN THROUGH SOME HARD TIMES. YOU MAY HAVE BEEN THROUGH DISCOURAGING TIMES, BUT YET YOU'RE STILL SATISFIED WITH THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD IS BECAUSE THERE'S AN ATTRACTION ON THE INSIDE THAT SAYS, "WHERE WOULD I GO? FOR THOU HAST THE WORDS OF ETERNAL LIFE." WHAT IS IT? IT'S A DEEP CALLING TO THE DEEP AND THERE'S A DEEP TO RESPOND. HALLELUJAH. WE'VE TASTED OF THE HEAVENLY things of Almighty God. And I believe the meat of the word satisfies the taste of the eagles. And and brother Brandon would say then he's tasting of the heavenly things. And he's he's got the whole word of God in his heart. He sees that manifested before him. And his whole soul is wrapped into it. And the world and all things is dead around him. HE'S TASTED OF THE HEAVENLY things of God. How many can testify of that? I'VE TASTED OF THE HEAVENLY THINGS OF GOD. And and it's incredible because he says that he's tasted of the heavenly things of God and he's wrapped his whole soul into it. SO ONCE YOU'RE SATISFIED WITH SOMETHING, YOU'RE WILLING TO ANCHOR everything upon what you're satisfied with. You know, and I I remember uh as a kid, and it might might not have been popular up here, I don't know. But did y'all ever hear the the the dinar? Yeah. It was a a foreign currency and and it was years ago. I was a little kid like and I remember there was our barber, you know, oh, Elden and and we he would cut our hair and every time we'd go in there, he he would talk TO MY DAD, WENDLE, DID YOU GET YOU SOME DINAR YET? YOU KNOW, AND HE WAS SO CONVINCED THAT THIS WAS THE GENUINE THING. HE WAS WILLING to pay pay MONEY FOR IT AND AND he would he and it's been years LATER AND NOTHING'S HAPPENED YET. WHAT WAS IT? He was convinced by it BUT HAD NO ASSURANCE OF IT. HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE THERE'S AN ASSURANCE THAT THE BRIDE OF CHRIST CAN HAVE. AND WHEN WE'VE TASTED OF THE HEAVENLY THINGS and we're willing to wrap everything into it, willing to wrap our children into it, willing to wrap our church into it, WILLING TO WRAP OUR HEALTH INTO IT, OUR FUTURE INTO IT, THE RAPTURE INTO IT, we've wrapped oursel into it because we've tasted of it. And it's the taste I was looking for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. See, brother Brandon would would preach a message called uh a thinking man's filter, you know, and he he would talk about how he was in the woods, right? And he would see a cigarette carton, right? And it was the slogan a smoking man's filter, a smoking a smoking man's taste. I think that's how the phrase would go. He would look at it and would say, "Well, the phrase ain't necessarily wrong, but what it stands for is wrong." He would he would change IT TO WHAT TO what was uh he he would I think in man's filter a holy man's taste and HE WOULD TALK ABOUT HOW THAT how that that's the that the per the people that smoke is looking for a certain taste right he would say that if they wasn't looking for a certain taste give them a stick and they can suck on the stick but they wouldn't be satisfied with it he would say suck ON YOUR FINGER HE SAYS THEY SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY just sucking on something, but they're looking for the taste of the nicotine, RIGHT? SO, NOT ANYTHING COULD GIVE THAT CERTAIN TASTE. SO, even though they could suck on a stick or suck on their finger, IT WOULD NOT SATISFY THE TASTE THAT THEY WAS LOOKING FOR. AND SO, THE BRIDE WOULD HAVE A CERTAIN TASTE THAT IT WAS LOOKING FOR. THAT'S WHY YOU MAY HAVE been in in a denominational setting or may have been in a in a trinitarian church, but you WERE STILL LOOKING FOR SOMETHING MORE. AND WHENEVER THOUGH THE THE THE WORD OF THE PRESENT DAY WOULD COME ACROSS YOUR PATH, THAT WAS THE TASTE THAT YOU WAS LOOKING FOR AND IT WILL SATISFY YOU IN THE TIME OF FAMINE. AND IT'S FOOD THAT WE CAN EAT ON. AND AND it's incredible because brother Brandon would tell us that the healing is the children's bread. AND HE WOULD TELL US THAT THAT IN IN IN the message spiritual food in due season, he can say we CAN EAT OFF OF OUR HEALING. WE CAN WE can eat off the word of the Lord and and so it's NOT JUST A PHRASE THAT THE WORD of the Lord is our food, BUT IT'S A REALITY. WHATEVER YOU EAT IS WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO BECOME. IS THAT RIGHT? You can't eat a dozen donuts every day and and and YOU NOT BECOME THAT, RIGHT? OR OR YOU CAN'T EAT A SALAD EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE AND AND NOT LOSE WEIGHT. IS THAT RIGHT? And and I guess it's been about two years ago, I guess. No, last year, I believe. And it was I I lost some weight. I lost about 40 lbs. And and what I had to do was change my diet, right? How many's ever been there? I I love my honey buns. I love my bread and my milk. But in order for me to see a change in my life, I had to see I had to CHANGE MY DIET. OH, I'M PREACHING NOW. MANY PEOPLE WANT TO SEE A CHANGE in their spiritual life, but ain't WILLING TO CHANGE THE DIET. YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT, RIGHT? YOU WHAT YOU SPEAK IS WHAT'S IN THE HEART. AND SO IF you want TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD, THE WORD OF THE LORD HAS TO BE IN THE HEART. &gt;&gt; Come on. Now, you know, and I hope this is okay, brother. I I was preaching one time and I I I stated the message and then that that's what I preach, you know, and the pastor came up to me afterwards and was like, "WHERE DID YOU GET ALL THAT?" IT'S IN THE MESSAGE, you know, and I the first time I had I had preached at a place and and they were sort of giving me a hard time about reading notes and and we want something fresh, you know, and and but but yet at THE SAME TIME, I'VE GOT SOMETHING TO SAY, YOU KNOW, I'm only GOING TO SPEAK WHAT I'M EATING ON, RIGHT? And I heard a story one time about a about a boy that would have a test coming up and and I hope this is okay this morning. I'm just preaching, you know, and and this boy had a test coming up and he would pray to God and say, "Lord, HELP ME TO PASS this test and and he would believe that God was going to help him." So, you know what he would do instead of studying? He would go play with the friends and he would go do this and do that and and the test came about and he he whatever came to his mind, he was putting down AND AND HE FLUNKED IT, RIGHT? And he and he and he cries to the Lord, "God, I thought you was going to help me do the test and I thought you WAS GOING TO HELP ME ON IT." And the Lord would speak back to him and say, "Yeah, BUT I COULDN'T BRING NOTHING BACK TO YOUR REMEMBRANCE." IN OTHER WORDS, YOU'VE GOT TO DO SOMETHING, TOO. YOU GOT TO STUDY AND THEN THE LORD CAN BRING THAT BACK TO YOUR MEMORY. COME ON [screaming] NOW. SO, YOU CAN'T EXPECT RESULTS WITHOUT EATING ON SOMETHING. BUT AS YOU EAT ON THE WORD OF THE LORD, WE REST IN THE WORD OF THE LORD. AND THEN GOD IS DUTY BOUND TO BACK UP THE WORD OF THE LORD. CUZ SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO CHANGE OUR DIET, CHANGE WHAT WE'RE THINKING ON, CHANGE WHAT WE'RE WATCHING, CHANGE WHAT WE'RE LISTENING TO, CHANGE WHO WE'RE FELLOWSHIPPING WITH. AND AS WE'RE DOING THOSE THINGS, WE'RE TASTING THE HEAVENLY THINGS OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AND WE'RE EATING ON SPIRITUAL FOOD IN DUE SEASON. OH, BROTHER BRANDON would say, "THIS IS THE SEASON FOR THIS FOOD." SO THE STORED UP FOOD, BROTHER BRANDON WOULD TELL US THAT that the Lord would tell him to store up food, right? and he to MAKE TAPES. BUT THAT FOOD WASN'T FOR TOMORROW. THIS IS THE SEASON FOR THE FOOD. THERE'S NOT ANOTHER CHURCH AGE COMING. THERE'S NOT ANOTHER CHURCH AGE MESSENGER COMING. BUT THE STORED UP FOOD THAT GOD GAVE US IS FOR THIS SEASON IN TIME TO FIX MARRIAGES, TO HELP CHILDREN, TO GIVE REVIVAL IN A HOME, IN A CHURCH, IF YOU'RE WILLING TO BE SATISFIED WITH IT. HALLELUJAH. AND I SAY I'M SATISFIED WITH IT. BROTHER BROWN, I'M GOING TO SAY this here in the message. Spiritual food in due season. But thanks be to God. We've got hidden food, spiritual food that we're living on. The goodness and mercy of the revelation of Jesus Christ in these last days. WHAT ARE WE LIVING ON, BROTHER JOSH? THE revelation of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Not just an imagination, but it's a reality of who he really is. And and I believe that that THE BRIDE IS SATISFIED WITH IT. AND THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US in Psalms 37 and 19, they shall not be ashamed in the evil time, in the days of the famine, they shall be satisfied. And so as a as we're moving on now, you know, Brother Brandon would say this here and here we are privileged tonight to see the message of God, the angel of God. And I and I love that quote because he's talking about how the world is in a famine. He's talking about how they're going to and fro seeking. He would say the true word of the Lord. And and it's incredible because brother Brandon would say in one place that that uh he would say that there's many truths out there, BUT HE SAYS JESUS is the true heavenly born truth. So there's many truths out there. And and and I heard a story one time on how that the the greatest robbery, the greatest train robbery that ever happened was by a false light. Y'all have heard that BEFORE THAT THE GREATEST ROBBERY THE TRAIN ROBBERY WAS BY SOMETHING THAT LOOKED genuine but it was false. And and you see brother Brandham says there's truths out there but there's only one HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH THAT IS JESUS CHRIST WHICH is Ruth the word right? heavens and earth WILL PASS AWAY, BUT MY WORD WILL NEVER FAIL. SO, THERE'S MANY TRUTHS OUT THERE THAT WE CAN EAT OF, but I don't WANT JUST THE TRUTH. I WANT HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH. YOU SEE, BECAUSE WE CAN WE WE CAN PARTAKE OF TRUTHS, BUT WHAT DOES GOD THINKING ABOUT IT? RIGHT? We're living in a day that that we can do what WE WANT. THAT'S TRUE. BUT WHAT DOES GOD say about it? Right? Like I was saying earlier about complexes, you know, and complexes can point out truths, right? You're too shy, you're too this, you're too that, WHICH CAN BE A TRUTH. BUT WHAT IS THE HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH SAYING? WE DON'T WANT TO GET WRAPPED UP IN JUST ANYTHING THE DEVIL THROWS AT US. BUT I WANT TO PARTAKE OF THE HEAVENLYORN TRUTH. You see here, brother Brandham, in the quote I I had just read, he would say that that while they're looking for the true word of God, he says, "Here we are privileged tonight to see the message of God, the angel of God." And and it's incredible because we would know what that word see means. It means to understand, right? He God Jesus would tell who was it? Uh Nicodemus I would think unless you're born again, you cannot see the kingdom of God. And brother Brandham must say the word see means to understand. So here we are privileged. Well the world is looking for the true word OF GOD. WE'RE PRIVILEGED TO UNDERSTAND THE WORD OF GOD. SO WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AT IT. WE'RE UNDERSTANDING IT. THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT THE MESSAGE OF THE HOUR IS IT'S A YOUNG PERSON THAT CAN UNDERSTAND THESE THINGS. YOU MIGHT NOT BE BE ABLE TO PUT EVERYTHING TOGETHER, BUT YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT GOD IS DOING in this generation. YOU KNOW, AND IT'S incredible to think that that even if this message was false, we're living a great life, RIGHT? AIN'T THAT POWERFUL THAT THAT EVEN IF BROTHER BRANDHAM WAS A FALSE PROPHET, EVEN IF this message is from the PITS OF HELL, WHY BOTHER US IF WE'RE LIVING A GOOD LIFE, RIGHT? I'M not a drunk, I'm not an alcoholic, I'm not out cheating on my wife, I'M NOT, YOU KNOW, DOING THESE THINGS. SO EVEN IF IT IS FALSE, IT'S PRODUCING SOMETHING IN ME. IT'S A HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH THAT WE CAN PARTAKE OF AND EXPECT RESULTS IN OUR LIFE. AND I BELIEVE THIS MESSAGE HAS RESULTS. IT AIN'T JUST SOMETHING THE MESSAGE IS GOING to produce a rapture. And I believe it's GOING TO DO THAT. BUT I BELIEVE IT CAN CHANGE US DAY BY DAY. IF THERE'S THINGS WE'RE NOT HAPPY WITH, I BELIEVE THE WORD CAN CHANGE US. IF THERE'S THINGS WE WANT TO GET RID OF, I BELIEVE WE CAN FEAST UPON THE WORD OF THE LORD, GIVE IT TO GOD, AND WATCH GOD COME ON THE SCENE AND CHANGE SITUATIONS AND AND CHANGE LIVES AND AND BRING A FIRE ON THE INSIDE OF PEOPLE, INSIDE OF CHILDREN, INSIDE OF HOMES. AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT THE WORD OF THE LORD, IT CAN BRING RESULTS. AND it's incredible because we're not looking for something, BUT WE'RE SATISFIED WITH WHAT GOD HAS GIVEN US. AND it's incredible because brother Brandham, he would tell us in the message ashamed, he would say, I want to take a little text from there. If if it'll be called that, called ashamed. You know, I like that. Whosoever is ashamed of me and of my words, I'll be ashamed of him. Now, the word ashamed could be translated embarrassed. He says, you know something, you're faced with something that you're embarrassed about being ashamed. He says, "Then another thing about being ashamed does, it shows you're not you're not sure of what you're talking about. If you don't know what you're talking about and have the assurance that you know what you're talking about, you can't tell anybody." He says, he says, "You can't tell anybody. If you have the assurance, you can tell anybody because you're not ashamed." And so being ashamed is to be embarrassed. And and we're living in a time, as I mentioned last time, we're living in the most deceitful age. And brother Brandham, he would tell us that. And and I mentioned last time how that it's hard to believe what's true anymore. You know, what what's AI or or what's genuine and and and I believe that that that is a design of the devil to take away the assurance of the word of the Lord. Right? because you know and and I've been even saying like pictures of pictures of uh uh like brother Brandham on social media and you can tell it's an AI picture you know it's too clear and and but but what's incredible is the message came before AI right so before the devil can scruple things up God already so when brother Brandham would tell us before you can have a counterfeit there has to be a genuine &gt;&gt; is that right you you and I mentioned it before you've never seen a counterfeit fit $7 bill. Has anybody ever seen a counterfeit $7 bill? How come there's not a genuine out there? Right. But there's there's counterfeit dollar bills, $5 bills, $10 bills, $100 bills is because there's a genuine out there. So if this is the most deceitful age and there's lies that is graping grasping the hearts OF THE PEOPLE, THERE'S GOT TO BE A GENUINE OUT THERE. THERE'S GOT TO BE A HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH THAT CAN ALSO GRAB A HOLD OF AN INDIVIDUAL AND PRODUCE THAT LIFE. AND I BELIEVE THAT THAT if the devil could ever get us to lose the assurance of the word of the Lord, he's got us whipped. And brother Brandham, he would tell us that whenever Jesus Jesus was upon the earth that the preachers were jealous of him. And he would say that and they were trying to destroy the influence of Jesus. And he says, "So is it today." They're trying to destroy the influence of this message before the people. He says, "IF THEY CAN DO THAT, they've got this whole thing whipped." SO THE DEVIL IS OUT WITH with this mo most deceitful age to destroy the assurance or the influence of the word of the Lord THAT WHENEVER YOU HEAR A WORD OR HEAR A MESSAGE preached across the PULLPIT OR OR HEAR YOUR PASTOR PREACHING THE WORD AND THE AND THE PROMISES OF GOD AND YOU HEAR IT, BUT if you've lost the ASSURANCE OF IT, YOU'RE NEVER GOING TO STAND UPON IT. AND THAT'S WHAT THE DEVIL WANTS TO DO. He wants YOU TO AMEN THE WORD. He He's okay WITH YOU QUOTING THE WORD, BUT HE DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE THE ASSURANCE OF THE WORD OF THE LORD. AND WHAT THE DEVIL WANTS TO MAKE US be is LIKE A BUNCH OF CATHOLICS. You know that only the priest can understand the word. ONLY THE PRIEST CAN HAVE A A REVELATION of the word. And and you remember how that started, right? That the the Bible was only in a certain language, right? And and that that's why many of the of the the old uh the old patriarchs and the the the Protestants they were they were burnt to the stake was because they were trying to bring the Bible into an English language, right? Y'all remember that? BECAUSE THAT WAS BY DESIGN OF THE DEVIL TO keep the word from the people and just keep it TO A HOLY MAN. SO INSTEAD OF HIM TRYING TO DESTROY THE BIBLE OR DESTROY THE MESSAGE, he tries to destroy the influence of it. He can't KEEP IT FROM YOU, BUT HE WANTS TO DESTROY THE ASSURANCE OF IT WHERE IT'S BACK TO JUST A HOLY MAN BELIEVING IT. BUT I BELIEVE IT'S MORE FOR IT'S IT'S NOT JUST FOR A PREACHER, NOT JUST FOR A SONG LEADER, BUT IT'S FOR LEOTY THAT CAN HAVE THE ASSURANCE OF THE WORD OF THE LORD. AND IN EVERY SITUATION, YOU'RE UNASHAMED TO SPEAK THE WORD BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE ASSURANCE OF THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD. HEAVENS AND EARTH MAY PASS AWAY THAT THIS WORD THAT I'M CONFESSING IS NEVER GOING TO FAIL. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. OH MY. I THINK IF we ever get a get a revelation of that, it would change our confession cuz we we I I believe that people fail to realize the importance of your confession. Brother Brandon, he would tell us in many places. He says, "God can never do anything for you until you confess it." He says, "You got to receive it, believe it, THEN CONFESS IT." AND AND THAT'S SOMETHING MANY TIMES THAT IT'S hard to do that, ain't it? We're living in A NEGATIVE WORLD. HOW MANY KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT? You you you can't even go to the store and you can ask the clerk, "HOW YOU DOING? OH, IT'S BEEN A BAD DAY." You know, UH THIS WENT WRONG, THAT WENT WRONG. WHAT IS IT? IT'S A NEGATIVE WORLD. And and it's easy to come under the gloom and under the clouds. Brother Brandon must say it's an erotic age, right? It's the greatest battle ever fought and a trap in the mind. And that's WHERE THE DEVIL'S FIGHTING. And it's easy to get beat down by the clouds OF DEPRESSION, THE CLOUDS of negativity that we're looking at the word of the Lord instead of through the through the filter of faith. We're looking at the word of the Lord through the filter of negativity. Looking at the word that, you know, it can't do this, it can't do that. But no matter how negative we may get, the word is still positive. THAT'S WHAT I LOVE ABOUT IT IS UNBELIEF don't hinder God, IT HINDERS YOU. NEGATIVITY DON'T HINDER THE WORD, IT HINDERS YOU. So instead of instead OF LOOKING THROUGH THE EYES OF NEGATIVITY, I say we can put on THE LENSES OF FAITH IN THE WORD OF GOD AND WATCH GOD COME ON THE SCENE. YOU KNOW WHAT'S INCREDIBLE, brother Brandon? He would preach a message called Why Christ? And he that's a powerful message. And I was listening to it on the way here and and I believe that many times our perception is negative which influences our speech right and and it's incredible because brother Brandham he would talk about Moses and would say Moses he chose to go with it. Why his faith he saw the promise he saw the end time he saw over in tomorrow and let his faith loose. Ain't that powerful? Brother Brandon was said that that Pharaoh would look out a window and would see mudbers, right? Moses looked out the same the same window and seen the promise. YOU SEE WHAT WAS IT? The perception was different. One perception was negative. The other PERCEPTION WAS POSITIVE BY THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AND AND MANY TIMES we get into the trenches, we get into a battle, we get into a hard time. And all we see is present. All we see is the troubles. All we see is the hard times. Brother Brandham says, "Moses, look into tomorrow." [laughter] HALLELUJAH. HE MIGHT NOT KNOW HOW IT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN, BUT he was looking at THE PROMISE OF ALMIGHTY GOD. And brother Brandham would say in that message, he would say, "Moses didn't pay no attention to what he saw." And he says, "Only if people can do that today. Don't pay any attention to what you see. ONLY LOOK TO WHAT GOD SAYS." AND IT'S INCREDIBLE THAT THAT can become a reality THAT OUR PERCEPTION CAN BE A POSITIVE PERCEPTION, RIGHT? BECAUSE a man don't have to change for you to think different of him, right? And and I think I've used the example here before that that somebody can spread a lie about somebody and and though that lie not be true, you can look at somebody different because their influence has been marred, right? you know uh you know I say I you know say I come to you and I say you know brother John he has a second wife in a different country this here's happening that's happening and some may say that's not true but people that might not know him well that might mar his influence to him and even though even though he SAYS THAT'S NOT TRUE that's a lie but somebody that don't know him too very well it can change the way that people see him and that can happen with the word of the Lord that the word of the Lord are still true. It still HAS THE POWER TO HEAL, THE POWER TO TO DELIVER AND FILL WITH THE HOLY GHOST. But if the devil can give you a false conception of it, it can change the way you see the word of the LORD AND INSTEAD OF LOOKING TO THE PROMISES OF GOD, you're looking to the to the situations that you're walking through. And and it's incredible that that our confession can be a word-based confession. And and you you you can remember that whenever whenever Jesus he would open up the the the eyes of the blind man and and the Bible says the Jews would go to them would would come to him would say how did you get your sight and he would say that that the man come open my eyes and they would go to his parents and would say is this your son that was blind and and the parents would say yep that's my son and they would ask them how is it that he got HIS SIGHT AND WHAT WOULD THEY SAY ask him he's of age he can speak for himself I love that. They were ashamed TO SAY IT, BUT HE WAS OF AGE. OH, [screaming] HALLELUJAH. AND I BELIEVE THE BRIDE HAS COME TO A MATURITY. She's been ripening UNDER THE WORD THAT SHE'S EATING AND SHE'S BECOMING the word. And then she's NOT ASHAMED TO SPEAK OF THE WORD. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. THE BIBLE WOULD SAY THAT THAT the the the that the Jews would come back to this man and would see how is it you got your sight in. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE because this man looked at him and said, "I've already told you. If I tell you again, will you believe on him also? Will you worship him?" THEY SAID, "HE'S A SINNER. He's done this. He's done that." He stops and he starts preaching on a sermon. HE SAYS, "I DON'T KNOW IF HE'S A SINNER OR NOT. I DON'T KNOW. ALL [screaming] I KNOW IS I WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE HIM. ALL I KNOW IS THERE WAS AN INFLUENCE. THERE WAS AN ASSURANCE. THERE WAS AN ANOINTING BEHIND THAT WORD THAT COULD CHANGE MY LIFE. AND I'M NOT ASHAMED TO SPEAK OF IT. HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE because he would begin to preach to it. In John 9 and 30, the man answered and SAID UNTO THEM, WHY HEREIN IS A MARVELOUS THING THAT YE KNOW NOT FROM WHICH he is? And yet he OPENED MY EYES. NOW WE KNOW THAT GOD heareth not sinners. But if any man be a worshipper OF GOD, AND DOETH HIS WILL, HIM he heareth? SINCE THE WORLD BEGAN, WAS IT NOT HEARD THAT ANY MAN OPEN THE EYES OF ONE THAT WAS BORN BLIND? IF THIS MAN WAS NOT OF GOD, HE COULD DO NOTHING. He's preaching to him in the next verse, JOHN 9:34. AND THEY ANSWERED AND SAID UNTO HIM, "THOU WAS ALLTOGETHER BORN IN SIN, AND DUST THOU TEACH US?" AND THEY CAST HIM OUT. AIN'T THAT POWERFUL [laughter] THAT HERE he was STANDING FOR THE PRESENT WORD AND THEY WHERE HE WAS CAST out of the church. But you know what would happen? That's not the end of THE STORY. THE BIBLE WOULD TELL US THAT WHEN JESUS HEARD HOW THEY CAST HIM OUT, THE BIBLE SAYS JESUS WENT LOOKING FOR HIM. &gt;&gt; OH, [screaming] HALLELUJAH. SO WHILE HE WAS PUSHED OUT OF ONE CIRCLE, CHRIST COME LOOKING FOR HIM. AND SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE TAKING A STAND FOR THE WORD OF THE LORD, FRIENDS MIGHT PUSH YOU AWAY, FAMILY MEMBERS MIGHT PUSH YOU AWAY, BUT DON'T WORRY, THE ONE THAT GAVE THE WORD IS COMING TO LOOK FOR YOU TO GIVE YOU A WARM EMBRACE. HALLELUJAH. AND IT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE THIS MAN DIDN'T EVEN know who Jesus was. HE DIDN'T EVEN KNOW HIS NAME. ALL HE KNEW WAS THAT MAN CHANGED MY LIFE. BUT WHEN JESUS COME TO HIM, HE WOULD SAY, "YOU come and worship me in these things." AND AND HE SAYS, "WHO IS THE LORD?" AND WHO IS THIS? HE SAYS, "I AM HE." AND THE MAN FELL DOWN AND WORSHIPED HIM. WHAT WAS IT? WELL, HE WAS CAST OUT OF ONE PLACE. GOD COME LOOKING FOR HIM. HALLELUJAH. WE MIGHT NOT FIT IN MANY PLACES. YOU MIGHT NOT FIT IN IN MANY PLACES, BUT THERE'S ONE PLACE YOU DO FIT IN WITH, AND THAT'S THE WORD OF ALMIGHTY GOD. AND IT IS A FRIEND THAT STICKETH CLOSER THAN A BROTHER. YOU MIGHT FEEL LIKE YOUR WORLD IS UPSIDE DOWN, THAT IS FALLING APART, THAT YOU'RE ALL STANDING ALL ALONE. BUT THERE IS STILL A WORD THAT HAS AN ANOINTING THAT CAN COME AND GIVE ENCOURAGEMENT. HE'S STILL EL SHADI, THE STRENGTH GIVER. HE IS STILL JEHOVAH GYRA, OUR PROVIDER. IT'S SOMEBODY THAT IS A REALITY IN OUR LIVES. HALLELUJAH. I BELIEVE THIS WORD UH HAS A REALITY BEHIND IT THAT CAN TRANSFORM SITUATIONS. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE SAME WORD THAT WOULD BRUTE OVER THE earth in THE BEGINNING WHENEVER GOD WOULD SAY LET THERE BE LIGHT AND SOMETIMES we get discouraged by time. Sometimes we don't see how we don't see situations changing and we start to fall apart. But you know but the Brandon says that whenever God said that there'll be light. There may have been billions and billions of years, BUT HE SAYS HE SAID IT, SO IT HAD TO [laughter] HAPPEN. SOMETIMES WE GET DISCOURAGED BY THE PROMISES OF GOD BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SEEING ANY CHANGE. BUT I SAY JUST REST ASSURED, REST ASSURED THAT WHATEVER WORD HE PROMISED, IT CANNOT RETURN UNTO HIM VOID. AND THE WORD WOULD BROOD over the earth. AND BROTHER BRANDON WOULD SAY THAT that it brought CHA BROUGHT ORDER OUT OF CHAOS. AND I BELIEVE THAT THE word of the Lord is still bringing order IN OUR CHAOS. YOU MIGHT FEEL LIKE YOUR WORLD IS FALLING APART, BUT THE SAME WORD THAT WOULD BROOD OVER THE EARTH can brute over SOME MORE EARTH. WHAT ARE YOU? YOU'RE AN EARTHN VESSEL, RIGHT? YOU'RE MADE OF THE EARTH, BUT YET THE SAME WORD THAT BROUGHT ORDER CAN BRING ORDER IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR BACK'S AGAINST THE WALL, BUT THAT SAME WORD CAN BROOD OVER YOUR HEART. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. HALLELUJAH. AND IT CAN ACCEPT US IN. OH MY. THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S SO INCREDIBLE is this man didn't go looking for Jesus. Jesus came looking for him. HALLELUJAH. AND SOMETIMES WE FEEL LIKE I CAN'T EVEN FIND GOD. WHERE IS HE? I'VE LOST HIM. I CAN'T EVEN I DON'T EVEN KNOW. LIKE IT WAS JOB THAT WOULD SAY IF I KNEW WHERE HE WAS, I WOULD GO AND TALK TO HIM. I WOULD KNOCK ON HIS DOOR. HE DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS. BUT ON HIS DEEPEST OF THE THE THE THE DEEPEST OF THE TRIAL HE WAS IN, THERE WOULD BECOME A THUNDER THAT WOULD BEGIN TO ROAR. AND EVERYBODY ELSE HEARD THUNDER. BUT JOB HEARD A VOICE SAYING, "WHERE WAS YOU, JOB?" IN OTHER WORDS, BEFORE THIS PRESENT CONDITION, YOU WAS WITH ME. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AND AFTER THIS PRESENT CONDITION, YOU'RE GOING TO BE WITH ME. &gt;&gt; SOMETIMES WE FEEL LIKE WE DON'T KNOW WHERE GOD IS. BUT LET ME JUST SAY THIS HERE. START FEEDING UPON THE WORD OF THE LORD. START [screaming] MEDITATING UPON THE WORD OF THE LORD. UH AND WATCH THE SPIRIT OF GOD. DROP DOWN IN A HOME. HALLELUJAH. DROP DOWN IN A VEHICLE. DROP DOWN IN A IN A BEDROOM WHERE YOU FEEL LIKE NOBODY HEARS YOU AND WATCH GOD COME ON THE SCENE. HALLELUJAH. OH, I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT. I'M NOT JUST PREACHING SOMETHING. I'M LETTING YOU KNOW THERE'S A REALITY BEHIND THIS WORD THAT IS A FRIEND THAT CAN BE THERE IN THE LONELIEST OF TRIALS. HALLELUJAH. The loneliest of times, but we got to make sure we're dwelling upon him. You see, that's a hard time is getting our perception back positive. Oh, hallelujah. to get our perception from the negativity to the positive and and getting our confession from being negative things to positive things and and it's hard because we're living in a negative world and and and negativity has a voice. You know that brother Brandham says but faith has a voice and he says faith's voice is positive. Oh my brother Brandham is saying this here but if you only if you just rely on hope you hinder faith. Now, hope looks for something way off. But faith claims a right now. See, faith says God said so and it's mine that settles it. See, I don't care if I'm still crippled, if I'm still blind, if I'm still sick. That has nothing to do with it. I believe it anyhow. It's mine right now. GOD SAID SO. That settles it. See? And he says that's faith. But hope says God said so. I'm expecting it someday. You see, I'm expecting it someday. And as long as SATAN CAN PUT YOU OFF TO ANOTHER DAY, that's just as good as he wants. That's right. You'll never get it. JUST BELIEVE THAT YOU'VE GOT IT NOW. HE SAYS IT'S YOUR personal property. Faith is the substance of things hoped for. The evidence of things not seen is not right. FAITH ACTS NOW. IT'S POSITIVE. HE SAYS, "OH MY, I TELL YOU, SICKNESS, everything else when faith steps in, IT'S LIKE A SNOWBALL ON A hot stove. It just melts away. Everything goes away from faith cuz faith stands up and takes over rule. When faith speaks, EVERYTHING ELSE KEEPS STILL." THAT'S RIGHT. SO FAITH HAS A VOICE. DOUBT HAS A VOICE. FAITH'S GOING TO SPEAK POSITIVE. DOUBT IS GOING TO speak negativity. Oh, but I said, let faith speak through our lives. &gt;&gt; It was be the Apostle Paul that would say this here. Uh uh uh he he 10:23, let us hold fast the profession or brother Brandon said that's confession or the confession of our faith. SO HOLD FAST THE CONFESSION OF OUR FAITH. And it's incredible because brother Brandon and there's many quotes he he would talk about how faith is positive and how the symptoms can't even speak at all when godly faith speaks. AND THAT'S INCREDIBLE BECAUSE WE ALL GET SYMPTOMS, don't we? Brother Brandman, he he would preach about Jonah and would say sometimes you feel like you're you're going through hard times and you're going through symptoms. He says none of us have symptoms like Jonah had. Right? He would say Jonah was in the belly of the well. He looked over there was Wells's belly. HE LOOKED OVER HERE, WELLS BELLY, seaweed wrapped around his neck and and that was a bad situation, wasn't it? Could you imagine? And what's incredible is Jonah was running from the presence of God. &gt;&gt; Right. And here you think condemnation would have been beating us hard, beating us hard, beating us hard. But yet Jonah would look at those vanities and even though those vanities had negative voices, you know what he would say? These are lying vanities. Oh my. They may have been true, but they weren't heavenly born truth. YOUR SITUATIONS MIGHT BE TRUE, BUT THEY'RE NOT HEAVENLY BORN TRUTH. IT WASN'T SO FROM the beginning. And you know what Job WOULD DO OR JONAH WOULD do in Jonah 2:9, "But I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of thanksgiving." So, you know what Jonah done? And he's teaching us how to do the same thing. He looked at the vanities. He looked at the situation and he would begin TO DROWN THEM OUT WITH THIS PRAISE. HALLELUJAH. AND YOU KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN? YOU KNOW, BROTHER BRANDHAM, THE THE BIBLE TELL US THAT SOLOMON WHEN HE WAS DEDICATING THE TEMPLE, y'all remember that would say, "If there's ANY MAN THAT'S EVER IN NEED OF HELP, may he look towards this temple, right? And Lord, may you save him." And so HERE JONAH WOULD LOOK ONCE MORE TOWARD THAT TEMPLE. AND YOU WOULD THINK ABOUT IT. HE'S IN THE BELLY OF A WHALE UNDER THE OCEAN. SEAWEED WRAPPED AROUND HIS NECK. HE DON'T KNOW WHICH WAY HE'S AT, WHICH DIRECTION HE'S GOING. BUT YOU KNOW, HE WOULD LOOK towards the temple. You know, brother Brandon would tell us it WAS INSPIRATION. IT WAS INSPIRATION THAT WOULD TURN HIM TO the direction towards the promise of God. BUT YOU KNOW HOW inspiration came? When he looked at the vanities and says they were lies. &gt;&gt; COME [screaming] ON NOW. AND AS HE G AS HE AS HE TURNED AWAY FROM THE SYMPTOMS AND STARTED TO PRAISE GOD, THEN THE SITUATION could change. THEN INSPIRATION COULD STRIKE THE HEART AND POINT HIM THROUGH the right direction of his answer. You want to get an ANSWER FROM GOD, DO AWAY WITH THE NEGATIVITY. START WORSHIPING GOD. START DWELLING ON POSITIVE THINGS AND WATCH INSPIRATION STRIKE THAT HEART. HEY, YOU WANT A REVELATION OF THIS MESSAGE? TURN ON THE TAPES AND MEDITATE on the word of THE LORD. COME ON NOW. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID MEDITATING ON THE LORD BRINGS HIM NEAR YOU. HE SAYS WHILE YOU'RE THINKING ON HIM, THAT'S WHEN HE COMES. AND SO WE CAN BE LISTENING TO TAPES, BUT ARE WE MEDITATING ON HIM? BUT AS WE'RE MEDITATING ON HIM, INSPIRATION CAN STRIKE THE HEART AND BRING ANSWERS. HALLELUJAH. BRING WHAT YOU HAVE NEED IN THAT SITUATION. WHAT IS IT YOU AND I don't believe in psychology. I I trust y'all don't either. That the Holy Ghost is not a psychologist, right? The Holy Ghost is a reality, not something that is reading looking OVER AND JUST GUESSING that that the the Holy Ghost IS A REALITY, BUT OUR THOUGHT MA OUR THOUGHT LIFE DOES MATTER. You know, brother Brown, he he he would say this here. He he says, "NOW, I WANT TO ASK YOU A QUESTION. WHAT GOOD DOES IT do us to come to church and sit in a meeting and ponder and maybe be discouraged because we didn't get a prayer card, maybe be discouraged because of some ill thing a neighbor did or discouraged one about one little matter or the other. He says that keeps Christ away from you. He says it's when you're thinking on him. HE SAYS WHAT GOOD IS IT TO come to church but you're thinking on other things. You're thinking on your problems. You're thinking on the situations, you're thinking on this, you're thinking on that. And it's incredible because brother Brandon, he would say, so he want to change from hope today to positive faith. There's only one way to get positive faith, and that's by positive thinking OF POSITIVE THINGS. MY so and here, brother Brown, he he he he would sort of bring a he would bring an answer to it that we're not just thinking positive, but we got to think on the right thing. He would say this, too. You hear so much today about positive thinking. You just put your mind on anything and think positive on it. He says the devil can do that. There's only one thing that rules over that. THAT'S GOD'S WORD. IF YOU'RE IF you are thinking contrary to the word, forget your thinking. Think on the word. So, brother Brandham says in order to get positive faith, we got to think on positive things. It's thinking on the positive word of God. Is that okay? We're not JUST THINKING POSITIVE THING. I HOPE I GET A MILLION DOLLARS. I hope I get a I hope I get a nice car. Hope I get this. Hope I GET THAT. BUT WE'RE THANKING ON THE word of the Lord. AND AS WE'RE THINKING ON THE WORD OF THE LORD, WHAT WE'RE THINKING on positive things, it starts to bring in inspiration, which is a positive faith that points to the word of the Lord. And and and I love this quote here and and I won't keep you much longer this morning. Brother Brandon will say, "We got our minds on too many things of the world. If we would throw those things off of our mind and think about him and his soon coming. He says, "There be more revelations and powers in the church." &gt;&gt; Woo! Buddy, who's the church? You're the church. I'm sure you may have heard this. And I've heard my my my my dad's a pastor and so I've worked close with him and and traveling around a little bit. And one thing I always hear here, brother, is the reason I left the church is because he wasn't feeding me. And I've heard that so much. And and here, Brother Brandham would say, "If you THINK ON THE RIGHT THINGS, THERE'LL BE more re revelations in THE CHURCH." &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW. He can be bringing revelations to you, but are you thinking on the right things? Oh, I'm preaching now. And you say, "Brother Brad, I'm going continue on, but we keep thinking about things. What am I going to do tomorrow? What will I do next week? What will he say? Will I hold my job? Will this be? And this is powerful to me. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS ALL THOSE THINGS are in the hands of God. Think on Christ. &gt;&gt; AND THAT REALLY SPOKE TO my heart because we can be thinking on problems. Is this going to happen? Is that going to happen? Can this be fixed? Can can are my bills going to be paid? And I've been there. I'm preaching from experience. I'm not perfect. I've been there. But here, brother Brandham says all of those things are in the hands of God. In other words, WHY THINK ABOUT THAT? THINK ON HIM. &gt;&gt; INSTEAD of thinking about how CAN IT BE, THINK ON THE one who can change the situation. &gt;&gt; Come on. Your mind can never you you thinking on problems ain't going to CHANGE IT. &gt;&gt; BUT THINKING on the right things, THINKING ON THESE THINGS, THINKING ON POSITIVE, A POSITIVE WORD CAN ALSO BRING A CHANGE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Oh my. It's incredible because what we fellowship on is what our what our speech is going to be. So as we're thinking on him or meditating on him, that's going to influence our speech. So if we're feeding on the spiritual food IN DUE SEASON, THAT'S GOING TO BECOME our confession. That's going to become what we're saying. And it's incredible that you can remember Peter. Peter would be whenever Christ was he he was about to be crucified and and and the Bible says he was standing by a fire and and there was some people that would come up to Peter and would say you're one of his disciples and Peter says no I don't know the man and they SAYS YES YOU'RE HIM THEY THAT WOULD SAY your speech belelleththy or betrayeth him and you know what WOULD HAPPEN THE BIBLE SAYS I KNOW NOT THE MAN AND HE WOULD BEGIN TO cuss what was he doing he was unashamed OF THE SPEECH BE AND WHERE WAS HE GETTING the speech? He was fellowshipping with Christ. And what's incredible to me is he would begin to speak the devil's language because he was ashamed to be identified with a positive word. And sometimes we can get there. You may say, "I NEVER CUSSED IN MY life and I never will." But you know, brother Brandon would say, "Speaking negative is the DEVIL'S LANGUAGE." &gt;&gt; OH [screaming] MY. SO WE'RE LIVING IN A NEGATIVE WORLD WHERE EVERYBODY'S NEGATIVE. NOBODY HAS A GOOD DAY. And let let me just say this. You and you can hear, you know, I've been through this. I've been through that. Let me just give you a news flash. We're all going through things &gt;&gt; AND YOU YOUR YOURS MIGHT BE HARDER THAN MINE. I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT WE ALL HAVE BATTLES. WE ALL HAVE TROUBLES. AND SO INSTEAD OF SPEAKING THE DEVIL'S LANGUAGE, SPEAK GOD'S LANGUAGE. OH, MICHAEL. SOMETIMES WE can get ashamed to speak the word of the Lord in our problem, in our situation, or or whenever you're fellowshipping with somebody and and they're speaking negative and hell, this is wrong. And and sometimes it's it's easier to get in with them saying, "Oh, I know this went wrong. Oh, REALLY? THIS HAPPENED." SOMETIMES it's easier to do that than TO SAY, "BUT HEY, LET ME TELL YOU A TESTIMONY." YOU SEE, SOMETIMES WE'RE EMBARRASSED TO DO THAT BECAUSE WE WANT TO FIT IN. BUT I SAY, DON'T be ashamed OF THE HEAVENLY LANGUAGE OF GOD. BUT WHENEVER YOU'RE IN THAT SITUATION, TESTIFY of who you've been fellowshipping with. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. YOU DON'T GOT TO GET IN THE GLOOM WITH THEM. IF THEY DON'T WANT TO GET IN THE GLOOM, DON'T GET IN THERE WITH THEM. PULL THEM OUT OF IT. COME ON NOW. DON'T LET THEM PULL YOU IN THE DISCOURAGEMENT. PULL THEM OUT OF THE DISCOURAGEMENT. HOW DO I DO THAT? BY SPEAKING POSITIVE OVER THEIR SITUATION. OH MY. WHAT? WELL, WHILE LAZARUS WAS IN THE TOMB OF DISCOURAGEMENT AND A TOMB OF NEGATIVITY, IT WAS MARTHA. IT WAS MARTHA THAT WOULD SAY, "BUT EVEN NOW, YOU CAN SPEAK THE WORD, AND I KNOW GOD HEARTH THEE IN HIS NEGATIVE SITUATION." SHE REFUSED TO SPEAK THE DEVIL'S LANGUAGE AND WILL SPEAK A POSITIVE WORD THAT [screaming] EVEN NOW YOU CAN PULL HIM OUT OF THAT. &gt;&gt; OH, YOU WANT TO HELP SOMEBODY SPEAK POSITIVE THINGS TO THEM? DON'T GET IN THERE WITH them and say, "Oh, I know." And I get it. There's got to be wisdom with it. YOU DON'T WANT YOU WANT TO BE SYMPATHETIC, AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT THERE IS A TRUTH behind speaking the word of the Lord IN SITUATIONS, AND THAT CAN BRING A SUNSHINE. HALLELUJAH. BECAUSE SOMETIMES WHEN YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A BATTLE, YOU NEED SOMEBODY TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS STILL A SUN UP THERE. SOMETIMES THE CLOUDS AND AND AND UP THIS WAY UP UP NORTH, MAN, you never see the sun around here in the winter times it feels like. But yet the sun's still there. THERE MIGHT BE CLOUDS, BUT THE SUN IS STILL THERE. AND ONE DAY IN THE SPRINGTIME, THE THE CLOUDS ARE GOING TO GO BACK AND AND THE SUN IS STILL GOING TO BE THERE. AND YOUR YOUR POSITIVE WORDS CAN BE a springtime to an individual that is in the midst of a WINTER MONTH. HALLELUJAH. AND ALL THEY SEE IS CLOUDS. ALL THEY SEE IS DEATH. ALL THEY SEE IS HOW ALL THE THE THE FLOWERS HAVE DIED. THE TREES HAVE DIED. BUT YET YOUR POSITIVE WORD CAN PUSH BACK THE CLOUDS. AND THAT SON CAN COME IN A SITUATION AND BRING LIFE ONCE AGAIN. HALLELUJAH. [screaming] IT'S UNASHAMED OF A POSITIVE CONFESSION. I'M GOING TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD. They must say I don't know what to say. You know, brother Brandon was saying, you know what confession is? He is he says saying the same things. He was saying our confession is saying the same thing that the word of GOD SAYS. YOU MAY NOT KNOW WHAT TO SAY. QUOTE HIM A QUOTE. SEND HIM A QUOTE. HEY, I LOVE DOING THAT. WHENEVER I'M STUDYING AND I COME ACROSS a quote that I like or encourages me, I put it on our family chat, YOU KNOW, OR SEND IT TO SOMEBODY. AND WHAT IS IT? IT'S A POSITIVE SUN RAY. WHEN SOMEBODY MIGHT BE GOING THROUGH CLOUDS AND DISCOURAGEMENT, I CAN SEND SOME SUNLIGHT TO THEM. HALLELUJAH. THAT CAN BRING LIGHT IN THEIR SITUATION. Glory to God. Let me just say this here and say that your situation is never hopeless. &gt;&gt; It's never helpless. &gt;&gt; Whenever God's on your side, &gt;&gt; whenever you've got some words of the Lord and it's incredible because brother Brandham was saying one place that confession means stone, right? And and you we can look how in in the Bible and how that there was a in the book of Judges, I believe, that that there was an an invading uh army that that was coming into this land and was wiping out the warriors, wiping out all of the king's men. And and there was some some people that would go into a tower. And the Bible says that the king and his and this army would go to the tower, break the door down, and would destroy the tower with everybody in it. But there was a certain woman. The Bible says, a certain woman would go to a strong tower. Not just a tower, but a strong tower. And you remember what the Bible says, the name of the Lord is a strong tower, and the righteous run into it and are safe. Not just a tower, it's a strong tower. We haven't been just given truth. We've been given heavenlyorn truth. And so this certain woman would run into the strong tower and and the Bible says that this invading king would come to this tower and would beat on the door but couldn't get into the tower because he couldn't couldn't get through the door. And what would Jesus say? I'm the door of the sheep. No man could come in unless he gets through me. So once we're in a strong tower, Christ is the door. Once we're in heavenly born truth, Christ is the door. And the Bible says that the certain woman, certain woman, a faith woman will LOOK OUT OF THE TOWER AND WOULD see the king sitting there. And the Bible says she grabbed a piece of a millstone, a piece of a stone, piece of a confession, WILL LOOK DOWN AT THAT KING, would throw the millstone down and would kill that king. This the king that was taken over home after home, marriage after marriage, church after church, life after life, preacher after preacher, home after home. There was a certain woman with a confession &gt;&gt; and she did even have the whole millstone. The Bible says she had a piece of a millstone. You might not be able to quote the whole Bible. You might not be able to quote the whole seals or you might not be able to understand everything. But take what you do KNOW JUST THE PIECE OF THAT CONFESSION &gt;&gt; AND SAY THE SAME THING. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. Remember that boy that would pray and he was saying his ABCs? Y'all remember that? And the man says, "What are you doing?" He says, "I don't know what to say." So, I just figured I would give him the whole alphabet, and he can put together what my HEART'S SAYING. SOMETIMES YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, BUT JUST CONFESS. Speak the word over every situation. HALLELUJAH. SPEAK THE WORD AND GOD comes on the scene. You know, brother Brandon, well, the Bible tells us actually that death and life is in the power of the tongue, right? And I think it's incredible that that while we're living in the day of negativity and while while the churches are dying that there's a group of people that's alive by the word of God, right? By the tongue of Almighty God. And we can grab that word and speak life in our situations. Grab that word and confess life in every situation. It's incredible because the power of our words is a genuine thing. and and as our musicians come and and the Bible would talk about how that Job as he was on his ash sheep and how that how that he he couldn't his friends were saying he was a secret sinner and how that he he he he had done some wrongs and and as the Lord would come in the in the thunder and begin to speak to Job and Job would then off his ass ash sheep would look at his friends and would say will this vain babbling end will it cease he says if you was in this situations He says, "I wouldn't use my words against you." He says, "I would use my words to strengthen you." Hallelujah. And he was giving us some insight that our words can either tear down or it can build up. It can either discourage or it can either encourage the power of life and death is in the tongue. You remember whenever whenever David was bringing the ark of the covenant back to the back to Jerusalem and how he was dancing, right? and and his clothes he danced out of his clothes and and his and his wife Michael Michelle was was there and was watching him and would say he's a disgrace and be and he was he would come back to the home. He would she would begin to chew him out, you know, and and what would happen because of her words, she would no longer be able to produce a child. Well, her words brought death. Oh, but at the same time, your words can bring life. He's saying, "I believe our our words can bring life in situations." Let's bow our heads this morning. Dear gracious heavenly father, Lord, we're thankful for your Lord, your never failing presence, Lord, and never failing promises, Lord, that we can confess it with an assurance, Lord. not a hope so, but with a faith. Lord, I know that we might not understand how it's going to happen. We might not know what tomorrow holds, but we know who holds tomorrow. And Lord, I ask that if there's some here that might be fighting discouragement. Their back might be against the wall. Maybe feeling like they're alone and forsaken. Lord, may they [snorts] may they look above the clouds and see that there's a word. There's a God that are shining light in every situation. In every negative situation, there is still a positive word. Lord, I ask that you would strengthen your people this morning. Lord, how we love you. We appreciate your goodness and your mercy in Jesus name. Amen. &gt;&gt; You love the Lord this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can we sing that? You know that song He knows my name. Um that's Can we sing Amazing Grace? It's amazing grace. How sweet the sounds that saved a rich like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found. I was blind, but now I see. I want to read you this quote here as I turn it to our pastor. Brother Brandham says, "Faith looks at God's worst and it esteems it greater and more valuable than the best that the world has." Oh my. So the worst day with God is better than the best day in this world. &gt;&gt; It looks at God's worst. I say let that be our confession. Let that be our our expectation. Let that be the way we look at things. And may that be when we look at situations, we're saying, "This might be bad, but I'm going to look at it the way God is looking at it, and I'm going to speak life into that situation." Amen. Let's sing it again as we turn it to our pastor now. Amazing. I'm found. was blind, but now I see. Let's stand together. Was grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relive. How preious did that grace appear the hour I first believe through many [singing] dangers. This is a positive testimony here. I have already come. His grace have brought me safe thus far. And grace will lead me home. And we been there 10,000 years. Bright shineing as the sun. We no less taste to sing God's praise. And when we first began, praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. Let's take a moment right now and let's as a body of Christ make a positive confession for your life. Whatever it is that you're wanting to see happen, &gt;&gt; let's take a moment right now and confess it out loud to God. God is here to do exceed above. All that we would ask, &gt;&gt; all that we would think, we're thinking positive. We've heard a positive word. It produces a positivity in us. Let's just take a moment and go to the Lord right now in prayer and in praise and make a confession to him. Lord Jesus, we thank you for the word that you have given us today. Lord, we thank you for giving us a positive word. And God, we need a you more in our life. We need more positivity in our lives, Lord. And and Lord, we like to see you move in our behalf that we might be a a more positive person, Lord. That we can change our situations by speaking the word of God. And Father, and I pray o over your people today. I I speak positivity over your people today that they would BE A MORE POSITIVE INFLUENCE, LORD, in their homes, a more positive influence on their jobs, a more positive influence in the body OF CHRIST. AND LORD, THAT YOU would bless the words that come out of our mouth, LORD. BLESS THE THOUGHTS THAT come out of our mind. Bless the actions, Lord, that we we have, Father, that they may produce life around us, Lord Jesus. I pray that you turn our homes around, Lord. Turn our our our lives around. Turn our relationships around, Lord. Uh turn our our our attitudes around, Lord Jesus. Oh God, we confess it today. We believe it today, Lord. We're speaking it today in the name of Jesus Christ. We thank you for it. We worship you for it, Lord. We count it, Lord. Everything else is lying vanities. And we stand upon your word today. Hallelujah. Thank you for doing this now, Lord. Let's just praise him. Let's praise him for for for for this answering our our confession today. THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORD, LORD JESUS. WE PRAISE YOU. We lift your name on high, heavenly father. Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Amen. He's changing us. You know, brother, um, brother Josh, when you came into the room, you saw I had a computer there, didn't you? &gt;&gt; Well, I was starting uh to work on the message, and the only part I got was there has to be a change. [laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. I knew that was of the Lord. The right mental attitude, Brother Bram said, will bring any divine promise of God to pass. You know, we're just we're in a battle. We're fighting it. Don't be discouraged. You're not the only one battling, but we just got to get back and start confessing even though we don't feel it, even though we don't see it. And God will move in our behalf. Let's sing. There's honey in the rock. I believe we just got to do what our brother said. Keep keep reading the word. Dig into the message. Keep eating it. There's honey in the rock for us. Amen. Oh my brother, do you know the Savior who is wonderous, kind, and true? He's the rock of your salvation. There's honey in the rock for you. Oh, there's honey in the rock, my brother. There's honey in the rock for you. Leave your sins for the blood to cover. There's honey in
