[30:54] brother rogers life
[30:57] um
[30:59] he's
[31:00] i believe he he feels
[31:04] there's there's time
[31:06] that he needs to make up
[31:09] and
[31:10] for the lord working for the lord
[31:13] and
[31:15] to feel that urgency

[32:56] christ's name we pray amen
[32:59] amen
[33:00] well in luke chapter 2 here we see that
[33:04] we're going to start with verse 7 but
[33:07] actually it was the government that
[33:09] brought about prophecy
[33:12] god used the government to bring about
[33:15] prophecy to get joseph and and mary uh
[33:19] back where they needed to be there in
[33:22] bethlehem
[33:23] and verse 7 says and she brought forth
[33:26] her first born son
[33:28] wrapped him in swallowing clothes and
[33:30] laid him in a manger
[33:31] because there was no room for them in
[33:33] the end
[33:35] and there was in the same country
[33:37] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[33:39] watch over their flock by night and lo
[33:41] the angel of the lord came upon them in
[33:44] the glory of the lord shone round about
[33:46] them and they were sore afraid
[33:49] and the angel said unto them fear not
[33:51] for behold i bring you good tidings of
[33:53] great joy which shall be to all people
[33:56] for unto you is born this day in the
[33:58] city of david a savior which is christ
[34:01] the lord and this shall be a sign unto
[34:03] you you shall find the babe wrapped in
[34:06] swaddling clothes laying in a manger and
[34:09] suddenly there is an angel
[34:11] and there was with
[34:13] the angel a multitude of heavenly holes
[34:17] praising god and saying glory to god in
[34:20] the highest and on earth peace good will
[34:25] toward men
[34:27] what a wonderful blessing god gave us
[34:30] and then in james chapter 1 verse 17
[34:35] james chapter 1 verse 17. just read one
[34:38] verse there and have you be seated
[34:40] every good
[34:43] and every perfect gift
[34:45] is from above
[34:47] and cometh down from the father of
[34:49] lights with whom is no variableness
[34:52] neither shadow of turning amen god bless
[34:56] you you may be seated
[35:02] we want to entitle this message
[35:05] christmas presents
[35:08] every year we have a different sermon at
[35:12] christmas
[35:14] and um
[35:16] i want to talk about christmas presents
[35:22] brother branham did say
[35:26] don't keep those little
[35:27] those presents from the little kids
[35:31] he wanted them to be able to enjoy
[35:34] the gifts
[35:35] of opening the presents
[35:38] but how many times
[35:40] have we been reminded that jesus is the
[35:42] reason for the season
[35:45] there have been so many things that have
[35:47] substituted the real purpose of the
[35:49] christmas celebration
[35:51] christmas has become a huge ceremony of
[35:55] commercial enterprise
[35:58] the whole world has taken advantage of
[36:01] this situation
[36:02] trying to get
[36:04] the whole world to try to make money off
[36:06] the world
[36:08] and and and people literally
[36:12] when they buy their goods they're
[36:13] running up
[36:14] debt on their credit cards
[36:17] and many of them are giving without
[36:19] christ being behind it
[36:23] i'm not pointing fingers at anybody here
[36:25] but
[36:28] we've got people who are totally against
[36:31] the word of god yet they give christmas
[36:33] presents
[36:36] and how easy it is to give at christmas
[36:38] time with christ not being behind it
[36:41] people not giving with the right motives
[36:48] when you
[36:49] are getting a gift for somebody
[36:51] do you ever
[36:52] think about getting the perfect gift for
[36:55] them what's the perfect gift for them
[36:58] a lot of times it's hard to find a
[37:00] perfect gift
[37:03] but i don't believe there's any greater
[37:05] gift that god could have gave us than
[37:07] jesus christ
[37:09] he was the perfect sinless lamb of god
[37:12] given
[37:14] our
[37:14] substitute for our substitute so we
[37:17] wouldn't die
[37:18] the bible says in saint john chapter 3
[37:20] verse 16
[37:22] god's motive for giving was pure
[37:26] wasn't
[37:29] to show off
[37:32] he had a love for the soul of man that
[37:35] was lost
[37:37] it was pure giving
[37:39] saint john 3 16 says for god so loved
[37:42] the world
[37:43] that he gave his only begotten son that
[37:46] whosoever believeth in him should not
[37:49] perish but have everlasting life
[37:52] for god sent not his son into the world
[37:54] to condemn the world
[37:56] but that the world through him might be
[37:59] saved so we see the motive and the
[38:01] purpose
[38:03] he that believeth on him is not
[38:05] condemned isn't that beautiful
[38:07] if you just believe truly believe as the
[38:09] scripture said you're not condemned
[38:12] but he that believeth not is condemned
[38:15] already
[38:17] because you have not believed in the
[38:18] name of the only begotten son of god
[38:20] there is no other way to be saved
[38:22] outside of jesus christ
[38:25] and this is the condemnation look at
[38:28] this and this is the condemnation
[38:31] that light has come into the world
[38:33] and men loved darkness rather than light
[38:38] because their day their deeds were evil
[38:40] so when i think about all when i was
[38:43] first introduced
[38:44] to jesus the bible the word
[38:50] there were things that were said to me
[38:52] that i felt uncomfortable with i'll just
[38:54] be honest with you
[38:57] i wanted to go on and live my own sinful
[39:00] life and still be saved and go to heaven
[39:04] and the reason that it was like because
[39:06] i loved the darkness that i was in i
[39:08] loved doing the things that i was doing
[39:14] i'm so glad that god loved me
[39:17] when i was yet in my sins
[39:22] and he was patient
[39:24] he knew that one day
[39:27] i would give my heart to him amen
[39:31] a lot of times when we're
[39:33] witnessing
[39:35] we've got to learn to be patient
[39:39] when man fell in the garden of eden god
[39:42] did not hesitate to express his eternal
[39:45] love for his son
[39:47] he had made in his own image in genesis
[39:49] chapter 3 verse 15 the first prophecy of
[39:52] calvary and i will put enmity between
[39:55] thee and the woman between thy seed and
[39:57] her seed
[39:58] it shall bruise my head and thou shall
[40:00] bruise his heel
[40:02] notice god didn't hold any grudges
[40:06] he didn't say well i'm just going to
[40:07] throw this out of the way i'm gonna go
[40:09] make another man
[40:13] he had a law that he was gonna see this
[40:15] through
[40:20] through the ages god has never forgotten
[40:23] man
[40:24] or his purpose for man to be in his
[40:27] image
[40:29] god didn't just want me saved
[40:33] he didn't say oh john martin's saved you
[40:35] just continued to smoke you can continue
[40:38] to drink you continue that worldly music
[40:40] you continue with that long hair and and
[40:43] that disgusting vulgar language you're
[40:46] saved anyways
[40:47] that is not what god was interested in
[40:51] god was interested in seeing his image
[40:53] inside this body
[40:56] and he never forgot it
[40:58] isaiah chapter 7 verse 14 therefore the
[41:01] lord himself shall give you a sign
[41:04] behold a virgin shall conceive and bear
[41:07] a son and shall call his name emmanuel
[41:11] chapter 9 verse 6 for unto us a child is
[41:14] born
[41:15] unto us a son has been given
[41:18] and that government shall be upon his
[41:20] shoulders and his name shall be called
[41:22] wonderful counselor
[41:32] jesus no
[41:35] the mighty god
[41:41] the everlasting father
[41:44] the prince of peace
[41:48] there's a revelation right there
[41:54] verse 7 says of the increase of his
[41:57] government and peace there shall be no
[41:59] end upon the throne of david and upon
[42:01] the his kingdom to order it and to
[42:04] establish it with judgment and with
[42:06] justice from henceforth even forever and
[42:09] the zeal of the lord of hosts will
[42:12] perform this
[42:14] god had a vision for you and me
[42:17] he was going to see it through
[42:22] isaiah 53 verse 1
[42:26] who have believed our report and to whom
[42:29] is the arm of the lord revealed
[42:32] for he
[42:33] shall grow up before him as a tender
[42:35] plant
[42:36] and as the root out of a dry ground he
[42:38] have no form now look at this they're
[42:41] describing
[42:42] the sun
[42:44] he have no form nor comeliness
[42:47] and when we shall see him there's no
[42:49] beauty that we should desire him
[42:54] it was a christmas present that was not
[42:57] beautiful
[43:01] there was not even a desire for this
[43:02] because she ever opened a gift and said
[43:04] man i don't even want this
[43:07] and they just save the money
[43:09] or give me the money and i'll buy what i
[43:10] want
[43:13] look at this gift he was despised and
[43:16] rejected of men a man of sorrows
[43:19] acquainted with greece and we hid as it
[43:22] were our faces from him
[43:26] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[43:29] surely he had borne our griefs and
[43:31] carried our sorrows
[43:33] yet we did esteem him
[43:35] stricken
[43:36] smitten of god and afflicted
[43:40] but he was wounded for you and i
[43:43] for our transgressions
[43:45] he was bruised for our iniquities
[43:48] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[43:51] him and with his stripes we are healed
[43:56] all we like sheep have gone astray
[43:59] we have turned every one of us in our
[44:02] own way
[44:03] and the lord laid upon him the iniquity
[44:06] of us all
[44:08] we're all in the same boat here
[44:10] amen he was oppressed and he was
[44:12] afflicted yet he opened not his mouth
[44:17] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[44:20] and as sheep before the shears is dumb
[44:22] so he opened not his mouth you talk
[44:25] about the very nature of christ
[44:30] go through
[44:31] go through some trials and see what
[44:33] happens
[44:35] it lets you know real quick
[44:37] how much more of god's nature that you
[44:39] need
[44:41] he was taken from prison and from
[44:43] judgment and who shall declare his
[44:45] generation for he was cut off out of the
[44:48] land of the living
[44:49] for the transgression of my people
[44:52] he was stritten
[44:54] stricken
[44:56] and he made his grave with the wicked
[44:58] and with the rich in his death because
[45:00] he had done no violence neither was any
[45:03] deceit in his mouth
[45:05] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[45:09] and he just wasn't much to look at from
[45:12] the outside was he
[45:14] and have put him to grief when thou
[45:18] shall make his soul
[45:21] an offering
[45:23] for our sin
[45:28] his soul became an offering amen
[45:30] the only thing that could save us
[45:33] a sinless soul
[45:37] he shall see his seed
[45:40] he shall prolong his days and the
[45:42] pleasure of the lord shall prosper in
[45:44] his hand
[45:46] there just wasn't much
[45:50] of
[45:51] a christmas present that really
[45:54] was exciting about jesus
[46:01] let's continue to read
[46:02] saint john chapter 1
[46:05] verse 10 says he was in the world the
[46:06] world was made by him and the world what
[46:10] knew him not
[46:13] you could actually be in god's presence
[46:15] and not even know it
[46:18] you could be sitting next to a seed of
[46:20] god and not even know it
[46:24] verse 11 he came unto his own and his
[46:26] own received him not can you imagine
[46:29] going back home to your family and your
[46:32] family won't receive you
[46:35] he came to his own
[46:37] he created man
[46:39] and he came to man to save man
[46:42] and his man did not receive a man did
[46:44] not receive him
[46:47] a lot of this verse 12.
[46:49] but as many as received him talking
[46:52] about this christmas gift now
[46:54] to them gave he power to become the sons
[46:57] of god
[47:01] now i understand
[47:02] this seed might have been already in
[47:04] there
[47:06] but i need power
[47:09] i need power and that power comes after
[47:11] you receive christ inside your heart
[47:16] power to become in his image
[47:18] power to drop the things of the world
[47:20] power to start living for god that kind
[47:23] of power
[47:25] not a show-off power
[47:27] not a show of power but a power that
[47:29] lives for god
[47:32] amen
[47:34] even to them that believe on his name
[47:35] which were born not a blood nor of the
[47:38] will of flesh nor of the will of man but
[47:40] of god
[47:42] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[47:44] among us and we behold his glory the
[47:47] glory
[47:48] as the only begotten of the father full
[47:50] of grace
[47:52] and
[47:53] truth notice what came first grace
[47:58] i'll say it like this when you're trying
[48:00] to help somebody
[48:01] give them grace before the truth
[48:06] but there was a beautiful gift inside
[48:10] of jesus the veil
[48:11] the outside was just a veil flesh
[48:14] when you looked at it
[48:15] it wasn't very handsome
[48:18] jesus wasn't very handsome he wasn't one
[48:20] of those hey
[48:22] he is a handsome man he's a rock hudson
[48:26] he's a
[48:28] arnold schwarzenegger he wasn't fit he
[48:31] wasn't built
[48:35] he didn't look
[48:36] young and
[48:38] no he looked aged
[48:40] he was a man in the 30s and he looked
[48:42] about 50.
[48:44] so from the outward appearance there was
[48:47] nothing that we would desire
[48:49] the outside of the gift didn't look too
[48:51] hot
[48:54] his personality wasn't much of a people
[48:56] pleasers when it came to just saying
[48:58] what's right and what's wrong
[49:01] he wasn't an entertainer he wasn't a
[49:03] celebrity
[49:06] in fact he was evil spoken of
[49:09] he was called a devil a beelzebub a
[49:12] fortune tower a friend of publicans and
[49:14] prostitutes
[49:17] on the outside there wasn't
[49:19] any bowls or pretty wrapping paper there
[49:22] was no lights or or or glittering tinsel
[49:26] there's no beauty that we should desire
[49:28] him
[49:31] but inside was a soul that loved man and
[49:34] wanted to see him back in the father's
[49:36] image
[49:39] jesus was willing to give himself for
[49:42] mankind in saint john chapter 10 verse
[49:45] 15.
[49:46] the majority of the people did not
[49:48] receive him but a few did receive him
[49:52] as the father verse 15 as the father
[49:55] knoweth me even so i i know the father
[49:58] and i lay down my life for us
[50:02] he laid down his life for the sheep
[50:06] and other sheep i have now this is
[50:08] really we're in verse 16.
[50:10] verse verse 15 with the israels and 16
[50:13] is the gentiles
[50:15] and other sheep i have which are not of
[50:17] this fold them also i must bring in and
[50:20] they shall hear my voice and they shall
[50:22] be one fold and one shepherd
[50:26] we're all one in christ
[50:28] doesn't matter our nationality
[50:31] doesn't matter anything we're one in
[50:32] christ
[50:34] it's the same blood of christ the same
[50:36] nature of god living inside of all of us
[50:39] it's what makes us one
[50:42] therefore doth my father love me because
[50:45] i
[50:46] lay down my life
[50:49] but i may take it up again
[50:52] you want the father to love you
[50:55] lay down your life for others
[50:58] no man taketh it from me but i lay it
[51:00] down of myself i have power to lay it
[51:03] down i have power to take it again and
[51:04] this commandment
[51:06] i have received of my father notice it
[51:09] was a commandment
[51:13] it's the will of god amen
[51:16] jesus hung on the cross for the whole
[51:19] world she for god so loved the world
[51:22] that he gave his only begotten son
[51:26] for us
[51:28] that should should be
[51:30] just as exciting every time we hear it
[51:32] every time we have the thought every
[51:35] time we hear a song that talks about
[51:38] jesus gave himself for you and i
[51:40] something inside should be just
[51:42] constantly stirring constantly giving
[51:44] praise god never wants you to forget
[51:47] what he did for you at calvary it'll be
[51:49] there in heaven to remind you there'll
[51:51] be scars on his hands
[51:57] this gift
[51:58] of christ
[52:00] has to be opened up in one sense
[52:04] it was opened up
[52:05] when his hands
[52:07] were were nailed and the spear went in
[52:10] the side the blood came out that's true
[52:12] statement
[52:14] but in another sense it didn't save the
[52:17] world
[52:19] a belief has to come from every single
[52:22] individual about their blood
[52:30] if you leave it wrapped up it'll do you
[52:31] no good there's only one place you can
[52:33] open this gift and it's in your heart
[52:37] man will never know the gift of god that
[52:39] he gave until he opens his heart to god
[52:42] amen
[52:43] it's that believing that's where belief
[52:45] comes from the heart
[52:49] now we've heard the saying
[52:51] someone's
[52:53] someone's word being as good as gold did
[52:55] you ever hear that before
[52:57] of course you don't hear it too much now
[52:59] because everybody's worth kind of gone
[53:00] down the tubes
[53:02] but we've heard of it
[53:05] god's word
[53:06] is gold
[53:08] not good as gold it is gold
[53:10] it's gold tried in the fire you can
[53:12] count on it it's forever settled in
[53:14] heaven it cannot fail cannot lie
[53:18] and inside his word there are many
[53:21] presents for us
[53:25] they're called promises
[53:28] there are gifts to us that he wants us
[53:31] to open up we can't leave them wrapped
[53:34] amen
[53:35] they've got to be unwrapped
[53:39] second peter chapter 1 verse 4 says
[53:41] hereby
[53:42] whereby are given unto us
[53:45] exceeding great and precious promises
[53:49] that by thee she might be partakers of
[53:52] the divine
[53:53] nature
[53:54] now notice
[53:57] what the promises are for
[54:04] god's interest is not just that we would
[54:07] be
[54:08] healed but that his divine nature would
[54:12] be inside of us so he could step back
[54:14] you know what he did to job
[54:17] have you considered my servant job
[54:18] there's none like him
[54:21] he likes bragging about his children
[54:29] having escaped the corruption
[54:32] that is in the world
[54:34] through lust
[54:36] the only way to escape this world is to
[54:39] possess the divine nature of god
[54:43] it's the only way
[54:44] otherwise we're going to get sucked
[54:45] right back into it the world is going
[54:47] down the tubes
[54:50] i mean the bible says that god's going
[54:52] to shake heaven and earth
[54:54] not just earth but heavens being shaken
[54:58] there's only one thing that's going to
[54:59] stand in its god
[55:03] it's god
[55:05] so the only way to stand in that hour is
[55:07] to get more of god on the inside
[55:10] amen
[55:13] and these exceeding great and precious
[55:15] promises in god's word are not just for
[55:17] our flesh
[55:19] they are for
[55:20] our divine nature if i'll say it like
[55:23] this we are supposed to be just like
[55:26] jesus when he returns
[55:28] we're going to be just like him
[55:30] now i'm sure jesus don't want to be like
[55:32] me
[55:35] because
[55:37] there's nothing too pretty about me
[55:40] i already know what my nature was before
[55:43] i met god
[55:45] and a man at his very best
[55:47] is all vanity i don't care how much he
[55:49] tries to better himself
[55:51] he needs god on the inside doing the
[55:53] work
[55:56] now the wrapping of god's gifts
[55:58] may not look appealing
[56:01] oh what's really important is what's on
[56:02] the inside i want to take a look at a
[56:05] few of gifts if i can do that i want to
[56:07] look at the gift of peace
[56:13] when you look at this gift a piece on
[56:16] the outside
[56:18] it doesn't look pretty
[56:22] to get to it it doesn't look appealing
[56:25] you have to keep your mind away from
[56:28] negative thoughts that's not appealing
[56:31] i like to just think whatever i want to
[56:33] think
[56:36] whatsoever things are true
[56:39] and honest and just and pure and lovely
[56:43] and of a good report
[56:45] man i'll tell you that is that's not
[56:48] easy to do does it does anybody have an
[56:50] easy time doing that
[56:53] so the rapping isn't appealing
[56:56] did you know you have to pray to get
[56:58] peace
[56:59] scriptural you have to make
[57:01] supplications with thanksgiving
[57:04] i'll tell you when you don't feel like
[57:05] praying you must forget about getting
[57:08] peace
[57:12] but when we open the gift of peace
[57:15] after we have disciplined ourselves to
[57:18] keep our thoughts on jesus
[57:22] peace is there
[57:25] you can't allow your mind to just wander
[57:27] off and
[57:28] and and and think about all sorts of
[57:30] problems and the issues that's happening
[57:32] in the world and just say i think this
[57:35] is wrong i wish this wasn't here and
[57:37] expect to have the peace of god
[57:41] it's wrapped up
[57:43] thou shalt keep him in perfect peace
[57:45] whose mind is stayed on thee because he
[57:48] trusteth in thee
[57:51] [Applause]
[57:52] once you reach that place
[57:58] you know we're we're used to having the
[58:01] peace when everything seems to be okay
[58:06] that check came in
[58:07] wow
[58:08] but we miss everything's okay there
[58:14] that's the way
[58:15] that's a temporal piece
[58:17] it's the piece of the world
[58:21] but the peace from jesus
[58:23] it passeth all understanding
[58:25] when things aren't working out
[58:29] that's what keeps you
[58:31] worldly peace don't keep you
[58:35] and we shouldn't say that we got the
[58:37] peace of god when it's not
[58:44] what we should do
[58:45] is say god
[58:48] let this peace remain if it's you
[58:51] what's wrong with doing that you're not
[58:53] you're not belittling your faith
[58:57] but you know many times the devil's used
[58:59] us and testifying something's of god and
[59:02] it's not
[59:03] so many times
[59:10] let's take a look at this
[59:12] gift of joy
[59:14] you take time to open up
[59:16] the gift of peace
[59:19] when you open up the gift of peace it'll
[59:22] be divine
[59:25] just like all of god's gifts are divine
[59:29] there is a mimic from the world these
[59:32] same things
[59:33] joy happiness whatever it might be
[59:38] but
[59:39] there is a difference
[59:43] the gift of joy did you know the bible
[59:45] says that the joy of the lord is your
[59:47] strength
[59:48] [Music]
[59:51] but you don't get much strength from
[59:53] cedar point
[59:58] or just getting together with somebody
[1:00:00] and laughing it up
[1:00:03] it only lasts for a little bit
[1:00:06] so we don't want to get the joy of the
[1:00:08] world mixed up
[1:00:09] with the joy of the lord
[1:00:12] or even
[1:00:13] our own joy with god's joy
[1:00:16] our joy rejoices when we get what we
[1:00:19] want
[1:00:24] the joy of the lord
[1:00:26] is when god gets what he wants
[1:00:34] god rejoices
[1:00:39] when we do his will
[1:00:45] let's look to jesus the bible says for
[1:00:47] the joy that was set before him he
[1:00:49] endured the cross
[1:00:51] it was joy you would think if you had
[1:00:53] something hard to do in life that you
[1:00:56] would be looking for some other way
[1:01:00] to get it accomplished then yeah i
[1:01:02] wanted i want joy
[1:01:07] but really when it comes to the acid
[1:01:10] test of you having to do the will of god
[1:01:12] and bear the reproach no matter what
[1:01:14] anybody says if your whole family leaves
[1:01:16] you you're going to take the word of god
[1:01:19] what you need is the joy of the lord
[1:01:22] the joy of the lord is your strength
[1:01:28] and it's to do his will
[1:01:31] that's that's why jesus had that joy it
[1:01:34] was to to
[1:01:35] to bear that cross and and to take to to
[1:01:38] die on the cross for you and i
[1:01:41] he saw you and i
[1:01:43] so there's something good gonna let's
[1:01:44] just say for
[1:01:46] for a moment
[1:01:47] that you come from a family that you're
[1:01:49] the only one in your family that
[1:01:51] believes
[1:01:55] and you're afraid to just obey the whole
[1:01:58] word because because you're going to get
[1:02:01] excommunicated from your family
[1:02:04] members you need to have a vision
[1:02:08] that if you don't do it
[1:02:10] they aren't going to get saved
[1:02:15] because that's what jesus had
[1:02:18] he had a vision for you and i
[1:02:21] he knew the whole world wasn't going to
[1:02:22] say
[1:02:24] i surrendered to god
[1:02:26] but he saw you amen
[1:02:29] and if you were the only one he would
[1:02:31] have died for you
[1:02:34] that's how real it is
[1:02:37] we got to be willing to take a stand for
[1:02:39] god
[1:02:41] joy comes from being in the presence of
[1:02:43] god
[1:02:46] when the times of refreshing shall come
[1:02:49] from the presence of the lord the bible
[1:02:52] says they that wade upon the lord shall
[1:02:55] renew their joy renew their strength
[1:02:58] just by waiting on the lord so the
[1:03:00] outside of the present doesn't look real
[1:03:02] good
[1:03:03] man i ain't got time to wait i got to go
[1:03:05] i got things i got to do i can't sit
[1:03:08] here and be real still and wait for god
[1:03:10] i ain't this is not appealing the
[1:03:11] wrapping paper doesn't look real good
[1:03:16] there's no beauty that we should behold
[1:03:20] any of these gifts
[1:03:22] but on the inside
[1:03:25] is life
[1:03:28] on the inside you have to believe that
[1:03:30] god is going to meet you
[1:03:33] how many has ever experienced the joy of
[1:03:34] the lord let me see your hands
[1:03:39] it's there
[1:03:40] when everything else goes down the tubes
[1:03:46] now we've all experienced it
[1:03:49] but somehow it doesn't always stay
[1:03:53] and the bible says if we don't keep keep
[1:03:56] doing his commandments that he's going
[1:03:57] to take his joy away from us
[1:04:00] that's scriptural you've got time to
[1:04:01] read it in saint john chapter 15.
[1:04:06] so that means we have to get back into
[1:04:08] his presence
[1:04:10] get still wait on him and when he comes
[1:04:13] he's going to say what about this
[1:04:15] what about that
[1:04:17] and you say yes lord i'm sorry i repent
[1:04:21] and god will reward us with the joy of
[1:04:23] the lord
[1:04:25] the bible says in his presence is the
[1:04:28] fullness of joy
[1:04:31] so to come to church and expect to get
[1:04:34] joy when you're not
[1:04:36] when your heart is not entering in
[1:04:41] i don't want to be in a church where
[1:04:42] it's just hopping and jumping and
[1:04:44] dancing and everything's on the outside
[1:04:47] but nothing's on the inside
[1:04:50] that's just not appealing to me
[1:04:54] you know brother branham says that's the
[1:04:56] problem that happened with the
[1:04:57] pentecostals
[1:05:02] they let all that excitement out the
[1:05:05] the
[1:05:06] chimney they didn't keep anything on the
[1:05:09] inside to help them live right
[1:05:14] so we always want to create the right
[1:05:16] atmosphere around us that's what you do
[1:05:17] when you go pray
[1:05:20] you're entering in his gates with
[1:05:22] thanksgiving
[1:05:23] you're creating that atmosphere that
[1:05:24] he's awesome
[1:05:26] you're grateful
[1:05:31] you're humbling yourself before the lord
[1:05:35] and when you get up you want to act the
[1:05:37] same way
[1:05:38] how many times this has happened how
[1:05:40] many times you've been in god's presence
[1:05:43] been very sweet presence been humble you
[1:05:46] get out of his presence and all of a
[1:05:48] sudden you're mean
[1:05:54] that is not what god wants us to do
[1:05:58] god wants us to get up take that
[1:05:59] presence with us
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:02] and it'd be an outward expression of god
[1:06:05] whoever we're with
[1:06:09] now we don't want a worldly excitement
[1:06:11] we just want a genuine thankfulness and
[1:06:14] a gratitude
[1:06:15] not a happiness because we got something
[1:06:18] but a joy
[1:06:20] a joy because he's now on the inside of
[1:06:22] us
[1:06:26] a lot of people
[1:06:30] starve themselves of the joy of the lord
[1:06:32] they'll go such a long time without the
[1:06:35] joy
[1:06:36] and i'll tell you why it's because
[1:06:38] they're too lazy
[1:06:40] to spend time with god in prayer
[1:06:43] too lazy to create a right atmosphere
[1:06:46] well i'll just go to church and
[1:06:48] hopefully they'll do it for me
[1:06:50] you know
[1:06:51] god may allow that for a season
[1:06:54] but after a while
[1:06:57] he's called you to be mature
[1:07:03] the presence of joy is right here among
[1:07:06] us
[1:07:08] we gotta open up the package
[1:07:11] we gotta let it in our hearts
[1:07:17] he's not going to force himself in
[1:07:25] oftentimes we leave god's gifts
[1:07:27] unwrapped
[1:07:29] we never open them up
[1:07:31] just kind of leave them we heard the
[1:07:33] word
[1:07:34] but we don't do nothing with it
[1:07:38] you know there's a lot of people that
[1:07:40] come up short
[1:07:41] of unwrapping the gift after it's been
[1:07:44] given to him
[1:07:46] hebrews chapter 4 verse 1 says let us
[1:07:48] therefore fear last a promise being left
[1:07:51] us of entering into his rest any of you
[1:07:54] should seem to come short of unwrapping
[1:07:56] the gift
[1:07:58] for unto us
[1:08:00] was the gospel preached
[1:08:02] as well as unto them but the word
[1:08:04] preached did not profit them not being
[1:08:07] mixed with faith
[1:08:09] other words you've got to believe her
[1:08:11] enough to open it up
[1:08:15] if god says we're more than able to take
[1:08:18] take the land
[1:08:19] well let's believe it let's open that
[1:08:21] thing up and let's go
[1:08:23] don't wait for somebody sitting next to
[1:08:25] you to go because
[1:08:27] god may only be calling one person
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:32] i don't know i'm not god
[1:08:35] but i don't want to sit in a church
[1:08:37] thinking just because we're sitting here
[1:08:38] we're going that ain't right either
[1:08:41] it's an individual affair
[1:08:43] and i say your faith god is calling your
[1:08:46] faith to believe all the word
[1:08:47] [Music]
[1:08:50] the bible says when jesus ascended on
[1:08:52] high that he gave gifts unto men
[1:08:56] god's given us the gift of a fivefold
[1:08:58] ministry
[1:09:00] for our perfecting that's what that
[1:09:01] gives us for
[1:09:03] and in second peter chapter 1 verse 11
[1:09:06] says that the ministry that they this
[1:09:09] ministry is abundant
[1:09:11] and it's given to us
[1:09:13] so we can know the true entrance of
[1:09:16] where god's nature is at
[1:09:19] not about having a good time
[1:09:23] i mean i don't know how many times we've
[1:09:24] had i've been to so many services just
[1:09:27] their hallelujah services within a week
[1:09:30] i don't see any hallelujahs
[1:09:32] [Music]
[1:09:36] there's a difference between the word or
[1:09:39] the excitement falling on your flesh and
[1:09:41] then falling on your soul
[1:09:47] james said every good and every good
[1:09:49] gift
[1:09:50] and every perfect gift
[1:09:55] is from above
[1:09:58] isn't that beautiful
[1:10:01] and cometh down from the father of
[1:10:04] lights
[1:10:05] with whom there's no variableness no
[1:10:07] shadow of turning.
[1:10:12] god is the same yesterday today and
[1:10:14] forever
[1:10:17] the bible encourages us to unwrap god's
[1:10:20] gifts
[1:10:22] first corinthians chapter 12 verse 31
[1:10:24] says but covet earnestly the best gifts
[1:10:28] covet earnestly the best gifts
[1:10:32] desire the best gifts from god
[1:10:37] there are so many spiritual christmas
[1:10:39] presents
[1:10:41] for all of us amen the bible says that
[1:10:44] there's diversities of gifts
[1:10:46] it's all from the holy ghost
[1:10:48] you think about these gifts there's
[1:10:50] gifts of healing
[1:10:51] gifts of faith
[1:10:53] miracles
[1:10:55] gifts of prophecy
[1:10:57] gifts of tongues and interpretation of
[1:10:59] tongues
[1:11:02] he gave out the gifts of knowledge amen
[1:11:06] discernment of spirits
[1:11:08] gifts of wisdom
[1:11:10] you know the bible you want wisdom
[1:11:14] he said he'd give it to anybody
[1:11:16] he gives liberally
[1:11:18] all you got to do is ask and ask in
[1:11:21] faith you can't waver about the subject
[1:11:23] you can't wonder if it's going to happen
[1:11:26] but they're gifts of faith
[1:11:31] you have to believe that's the
[1:11:32] foundation
[1:11:38] there are gifts of helps
[1:11:40] the bible says gifts of governments
[1:11:45] yeah you wouldn't think so
[1:11:47] when we look at our our government but
[1:11:49] what i'm referring to is that
[1:11:52] there's got to be some sort of order in
[1:11:55] a church
[1:11:57] and there are people that are gifted in
[1:11:59] that department
[1:12:02] there's gifts of interceding
[1:12:05] supplication
[1:12:07] prayer warriors
[1:12:09] i mean these are gifts
[1:12:11] god has given his gifts to help and
[1:12:14] edify the body
[1:12:20] god
[1:12:21] is not short
[1:12:28] god wants us to covet earnestly the best
[1:12:30] of gifts
[1:12:34] he says and yet
[1:12:36] show i unto you a more excellent way
[1:12:40] if i could just for a moment i want to
[1:12:42] talk about
[1:12:43] that more excellent way
[1:12:46] because the bible says we could have the
[1:12:48] gift of faith to remove all mountains
[1:12:52] it would still come short of what we
[1:12:54] need to get out of here
[1:12:55] [Music]
[1:12:58] we could have the gift of speaking in
[1:13:00] the tongues of men
[1:13:03] and of angels
[1:13:04] and to god
[1:13:06] it would just be a tinkling symbol
[1:13:09] a son just wouldn't mean a thing
[1:13:12] you could have all knowledge
[1:13:14] the bible says you can have all
[1:13:16] knowledge you could even understand all
[1:13:18] the mysteries in the bible
[1:13:22] and still would not
[1:13:24] do us any good
[1:13:28] but i want to talk about a more
[1:13:29] excellent way
[1:13:32] it's a gift but it's more than a gift
[1:13:36] it's jesus
[1:13:38] it's the way it's the truth it's the
[1:13:40] life we might say it's the complete
[1:13:43] package
[1:13:45] the gift of love
[1:13:47] it's the most important gift and yet
[1:13:49] it's more than a gift the bible says for
[1:13:51] god is love
[1:13:55] the gift of love is in our church
[1:14:00] oh that was there should have been a lot
[1:14:01] more amens with that one
[1:14:04] i say we feel it
[1:14:06] we sense it
[1:14:08] we experience the effects of it
[1:14:12] but we need to open it up
[1:14:15] and we need to walk out of church with
[1:14:17] it
[1:14:20] we need to possess it
[1:14:25] we we all experience this gift
[1:14:29] but it's not very easy to experience it
[1:14:33] brother marty was talking in our men's
[1:14:35] meaning
[1:14:36] that it's hard to really love your
[1:14:38] enemies
[1:14:41] in other words it's difficult to open
[1:14:43] the gift when you're being hurt by
[1:14:45] somebody
[1:14:49] people are mean to us
[1:14:52] but you know what
[1:14:53] god didn't have a hard time
[1:14:57] if we're having a hard time
[1:14:59] all we need is more love
[1:15:03] just more
[1:15:04] more
[1:15:07] look if i had to push this this way and
[1:15:09] i couldn't do it i just need some more
[1:15:11] help
[1:15:12] some more pushing
[1:15:15] and i would get this thing to move
[1:15:18] if my love isn't getting the job done
[1:15:21] i just need more love
[1:15:25] i'm not saying i don't have any love of
[1:15:27] god
[1:15:28] i'm just saying i need more
[1:15:31] i got to get to a place
[1:15:33] where i could do it
[1:15:38] we've all experienced
[1:15:39] this gift is not easy to open
[1:15:43] it reminds me a little bit when emma
[1:15:46] emma was over our house and she was
[1:15:48] opening up
[1:15:49] some of her christmas gifts
[1:15:53] and she was having a hard time because
[1:15:56] they were taped pretty good
[1:16:00] and she
[1:16:01] tried to open up the gifts and get it
[1:16:03] out every time she turned towards daddy
[1:16:06] just need some help daddy
[1:16:08] and she shaking that thing and trying to
[1:16:11] get it out
[1:16:14] but once she got it out i'm telling you
[1:16:17] there was a big smile the eyes were big
[1:16:20] she was happy because she got to the
[1:16:22] gift and i'm telling you you keep
[1:16:24] pressing in prayer you keep pressing
[1:16:26] because when you open that gift you'll
[1:16:28] better love your enemies
[1:16:30] you'll be able to pray for those that
[1:16:32] despitefully use you
[1:16:35] brother branham said like this whatever
[1:16:37] you do lay everything else aside until
[1:16:40] you get perfect love
[1:16:42] get to the place where you can love
[1:16:44] everyone even your enemies
[1:16:49] the gift of love is more real to me than
[1:16:52] any sermon
[1:16:54] any quote any doctrine anything that
[1:16:57] anybody can say or do
[1:17:02] everything that we're doing should be
[1:17:04] leading us to exercise the love of god
[1:17:08] exercise it exercise it
[1:17:11] you know
[1:17:13] i'm realizing that i need to get in
[1:17:15] shape
[1:17:17] because i'm finding myself puffing more
[1:17:21] just taking the garbage things down to
[1:17:24] the end of the driveway
[1:17:26] welcome to the club
[1:17:29] some things i i've haven't experienced
[1:17:32] so much out of shape
[1:17:37] i need to exercise
[1:17:39] so i'm more in shape
[1:17:42] we need to exercise
[1:17:45] the gift of god's love
[1:17:48] don't think you're going to get filled
[1:17:50] with god's love after coming to church
[1:17:52] for so long
[1:17:54] people sit in church for years and never
[1:17:57] exercise it they're too proud
[1:18:00] to to
[1:18:01] think they're too uh spiritual
[1:18:05] too much knowledge gonna tell every but
[1:18:08] you know what you gotta humble yourself
[1:18:14] when you open this gift you're going to
[1:18:16] be able to suffer long
[1:18:20] you're automatically going to be kind
[1:18:23] you won't seek your own ideas
[1:18:26] you won't be puffing yourself up or or
[1:18:29] being boastful
[1:18:31] your behavior won't be
[1:18:33] unbecoming when you get this gift
[1:18:37] you'll act
[1:18:39] the right way
[1:18:41] you won't be so easily offended either
[1:18:46] you won't be thinking ill of others
[1:18:48] or evil in any way
[1:18:51] because you you're into the gift
[1:18:56] when you open this gift of love
[1:18:59] you'll be washing
[1:19:01] one another's dirty feet
[1:19:04] you'll be living for others
[1:19:07] you'll bear all things you'll believe
[1:19:08] all things you'll hope all things and
[1:19:10] you'll endure all things because that's
[1:19:12] what love does
[1:19:14] god's love does that
[1:19:17] and i'll say it like this we should get
[1:19:19] serious no matter where we're at with
[1:19:21] god to lay everything else aside in our
[1:19:23] life and really start spending more time
[1:19:25] getting that
[1:19:28] it shouldn't be just a quote it needs to
[1:19:30] become manifested in our lives
[1:19:38] i've often said i don't care what
[1:19:40] somebody knows good or bad profound
[1:19:43] or the news of the world i really
[1:19:46] don't care
[1:19:49] all i want to know is how much you want
[1:19:50] to help
[1:19:54] are you willing to take time and help
[1:19:58] because that's what love does it helps
[1:20:04] otherwise we're just some sort of
[1:20:07] cnn abc
[1:20:10] just
[1:20:11] saying what we want to say and we know
[1:20:12] all those stations that we listen to
[1:20:15] they're only saying what they want to
[1:20:16] say
[1:20:18] a lot of times when we talk to others we
[1:20:20] just say the part we want to say
[1:20:24] we say what what god did for us
[1:20:29] not how we failed him
[1:20:32] not how we we we we got lazy uncaring
[1:20:36] didn't apologize
[1:20:40] all's it is just the news
[1:20:44] matthew chapter 5 verse 44
[1:20:47] but i say unto you love
[1:20:50] your
[1:20:51] enemies
[1:20:52] bless them that curse you
[1:20:54] do good to them that hate you pray for
[1:20:57] them that
[1:20:58] pray for them that despitefully they
[1:21:00] can't not just use you a little bit
[1:21:02] but they're just spiteful about it
[1:21:05] in other words they put their nose up in
[1:21:06] the air they know what they did to you
[1:21:12] and they'll even persecute you
[1:21:17] now
[1:21:19] you're supposed to love
[1:21:21] bless
[1:21:22] and pray
[1:21:26] now to try to do that in your flesh
[1:21:31] it'll be miserable when you're doing it
[1:21:33] for starters
[1:21:35] you can't have faith doing it
[1:21:39] you've got to have faith
[1:21:45] love
[1:21:47] worketh
[1:21:49] faith
[1:21:50] worketh
[1:21:52] we read that love
[1:21:54] worketh
[1:21:59] faith worketh by love
[1:22:01] thank you faith worketh allah we need
[1:22:04] the love of god to believe this
[1:22:06] scripture is for me i don't know who
[1:22:08] it's for
[1:22:09] i don't know i i would it be for the
[1:22:11] whole world
[1:22:12] but in reality i don't know who's going
[1:22:14] to believe it
[1:22:16] but i want to believe it for me
[1:22:20] and you know what god if you if you
[1:22:22] really want that you know what god's
[1:22:23] going to do for you
[1:22:24] he's going to put somebody in your life
[1:22:26] shortly
[1:22:27] and step on your toes
[1:22:30] it won't be real hard it'll be just a
[1:22:32] little bit
[1:22:33] just to see which way you're going to go
[1:22:38] and if you get to a place where you're
[1:22:40] doing real well
[1:22:41] well look what he did this job
[1:22:45] and he stood the test
[1:22:48] he stood the test even when his best
[1:22:50] friends came to him and accused him
[1:22:54] he still loved them
[1:22:57] that ye may be the children of your
[1:22:58] father which is in heaven free make it
[1:23:00] the son to rise on the evil and on the
[1:23:02] good and send us reign on the just and
[1:23:04] the unjust how many today
[1:23:07] remember the last time you gave
[1:23:10] to the unjust
[1:23:13] that you smiled
[1:23:15] and gave your heart
[1:23:18] to
[1:23:19] to the evil
[1:23:23] or do you still hold the attitude of
[1:23:26] i just stay away from them
[1:23:30] i ain't shining on them
[1:23:34] i'm just avoiding
[1:23:36] so what spirit is that
[1:23:38] what spirit is that well i have a reason
[1:23:40] i understand you have a reason doesn't
[1:23:42] make it right
[1:23:45] let's just do what the bible says let's
[1:23:47] keep it simple
[1:23:49] for if you love them which love you
[1:23:52] where's your reward
[1:23:54] do not even the publicans the same
[1:24:00] did you know the bible says
[1:24:02] it's unwise to compare yourself with
[1:24:04] others
[1:24:06] why is that
[1:24:07] why is jesus comparing us with others
[1:24:10] right now
[1:24:17] because it's our proud selfish nature
[1:24:20] only wants to compare ourselves with
[1:24:22] somebody that's less than us
[1:24:25] jesus
[1:24:28] was letting us know that if we're if
[1:24:31] we're going to just pick and choose
[1:24:33] we're just like anybody else
[1:24:37] jesus
[1:24:38] wanted us to compare ourselves with this
[1:24:40] father
[1:24:43] who loves everybody
[1:24:48] it's really okay to compare yourself
[1:24:51] with somebody that's walking higher than
[1:24:53] you
[1:24:54] closer to god
[1:24:56] someone who's giving more of their life
[1:24:59] and really that's what you should be
[1:25:00] looking at
[1:25:02] not looking at what they're saying
[1:25:04] you know so many people get caught up in
[1:25:06] how somebody acts what they're saying
[1:25:10] you need to look at the fruit of their
[1:25:13] life
[1:25:17] for if you love them that love which
[1:25:19] love you what reward have you
[1:25:22] do not even republicans the same and if
[1:25:24] you salute your brother and only god
[1:25:26] bless you today my brother
[1:25:29] what do you more than others do not even
[1:25:31] republican soul
[1:25:33] but be ye perfect
[1:25:35] but be ye therefore perfect even as your
[1:25:38] father which is in heaven is perfect
[1:25:42] this to me is the perfect gift to give
[1:25:45] anybody
[1:25:48] the real love of god
[1:25:50] you can't hand that package that up and
[1:25:52] say jesus loves you
[1:25:57] the wonderful thing is for a christian
[1:26:00] he can give this gift out 365 days a
[1:26:02] year
[1:26:04] there'll be a lot of opportunity to pull
[1:26:06] this gift out
[1:26:12] love
[1:26:13] them without hypocrisy
[1:26:16] be
[1:26:17] genuinely in love labor to get to that
[1:26:20] place
[1:26:22] it's not easy
[1:26:24] to open this package
[1:26:27] but once you open it it is beautiful on
[1:26:30] the inside
[1:26:31] the most important gift that god could
[1:26:33] ever give a man is eternal life
[1:26:37] which is the gift of himself which is
[1:26:39] the gift of divine love
[1:26:42] and the only assurance that man has
[1:26:44] eternal life is to receive eternal life
[1:26:46] now remember this statement
[1:26:48] the only assurance that a man has
[1:26:50] eternal life is to receive eternal life
[1:26:53] into his heart and soul
[1:26:55] i don't care put your name on the book
[1:26:58] i don't care uh burn candles i don't
[1:27:01] care about uh uh quoting some apostles
[1:27:04] creator any scripture in the bible i
[1:27:07] don't care about speaking in tongues i
[1:27:09] don't care long you've come to church i
[1:27:12] what you have to do is receive eternal
[1:27:14] life in your heart and soul and that is
[1:27:16] the only assurance a man has
[1:27:22] i'm all for believing
[1:27:25] because the bible says he that believeth
[1:27:26] and baptized shall be saved i'm all for
[1:27:28] believing
[1:27:30] but without believing
[1:27:34] without believing there is no salvation
[1:27:37] but believing without possessing
[1:27:42] there's no assurance
[1:27:44] you're short
[1:27:47] believing without receiving god's gift
[1:27:50] is short of you possessing eternal life
[1:27:52] now i know this is strong
[1:27:54] but your mouth will hear the truth
[1:27:57] you know the bible says that there will
[1:27:58] be many that come to god in the last day
[1:28:02] thinking that they were saved
[1:28:05] when they weren't
[1:28:07] it wasn't because
[1:28:09] necessarily
[1:28:12] the intentions of the preachers was to
[1:28:14] see people
[1:28:16] but jesus said the blind lead the blind
[1:28:18] they both fall in the ditch
[1:28:22] you've got to hear the truth
[1:28:25] and that truth is what sets us free
[1:28:31] brother branham said like this when you
[1:28:32] get baptized
[1:28:34] that's you saying i've accepted christ
[1:28:37] into my life
[1:28:40] and when you receive the holy ghost
[1:28:43] that's christ saying to you
[1:28:45] i've accepted you
[1:28:49] that's strong but i'm just getting to
[1:28:50] the to the truth
[1:28:53] god told moses in exodus chapter 12
[1:28:55] verse 13
[1:28:56] and the blood shall be to you for a
[1:28:59] token upon the house
[1:29:01] upon the houses where your where ye are
[1:29:04] and when i see the blood i will pass
[1:29:06] over you
[1:29:08] and the plague shall not come upon you
[1:29:09] to destroy you when i smite the land of
[1:29:12] egypt now everybody knows this story
[1:29:16] everybody knows the story of the ten the
[1:29:19] the plagues
[1:29:22] and the last plague was death
[1:29:25] and death was going to destroy all of
[1:29:27] whoever the firstborn of all that was in
[1:29:30] egypt whether you went to church or
[1:29:32] didn't go to church
[1:29:35] whether you were under moses or not
[1:29:38] under moses
[1:29:40] there was a requirement that god had and
[1:29:42] that requirement was i want to see the
[1:29:44] blood upon the door
[1:29:47] uh the top linen and the doorpost
[1:29:50] of every house or the deaf angels coming
[1:29:53] inside and killing the the firstborn
[1:29:56] son
[1:29:59] now the token
[1:30:01] in that hour was the literal blood of a
[1:30:04] spotless lamb upon the houses they lived
[1:30:07] in
[1:30:08] today the token in this hour is the
[1:30:10] literal life that was in god's blood
[1:30:15] upon
[1:30:16] in your heart
[1:30:20] that's how serious it is
[1:30:24] oh my
[1:30:26] when that opened up
[1:30:29] christ present on the cross and blood
[1:30:31] poured out that was god's gift to
[1:30:33] mankind
[1:30:34] but yet it has to be received
[1:30:36] individually
[1:30:41] just saying i'm sorry
[1:30:43] just
[1:30:44] being baptized
[1:30:46] is not enough
[1:30:48] brother branham says uh
[1:30:51] if you're not right and you go into that
[1:30:53] water a sinner dry you'll come up a wet
[1:30:57] one
[1:30:59] as the tree the way the tree falls
[1:31:01] that's the way it lies
[1:31:04] we're
[1:31:05] water doesn't change us
[1:31:07] hallelujah water doesn't change us
[1:31:11] every
[1:31:12] we're baptized by the spirit of the
[1:31:14] living god inside our hearts
[1:31:17] by one spirit we're all baptized into
[1:31:19] the body
[1:31:22] but we're taught that that life that was
[1:31:24] in the blood
[1:31:25] could not come back upon the heart of
[1:31:29] man
[1:31:31] but the life of jesus christ can come
[1:31:34] back in our heart
[1:31:36] and what does it do it changes us into
[1:31:38] the very image that there was at the
[1:31:40] beginning that's what it does it doesn't
[1:31:43] just save us it changes us
[1:31:47] and that change is the evident token
[1:31:50] that the blood has really been applied
[1:31:57] brother brandon said in the message the
[1:31:58] tolkien
[1:32:02] he says but in this glorious place under
[1:32:04] the this covenant there's a difference
[1:32:06] between the blood and the life
[1:32:09] the token for the believer today is the
[1:32:12] holy spirit
[1:32:14] not a blood
[1:32:16] a chemistry
[1:32:17] but it is the holy spirit of god
[1:32:21] that is the token that god requires
[1:32:24] of the church today
[1:32:27] god must see the token he must see it in
[1:32:30] every one of us
[1:32:33] now we're living in the shadows and the
[1:32:34] wrath is ready to strike and god is
[1:32:37] requiring a token
[1:32:39] that
[1:32:40] you yourself have received this token
[1:32:43] the holy ghost now we know armageddon's
[1:32:46] setting in
[1:32:48] the world
[1:32:50] is going down and it's not going to
[1:32:52] raise up and we're going to be great for
[1:32:53] 50 more years
[1:32:58] death is going to strike
[1:33:00] this whole world
[1:33:03] and the only thing that's going to save
[1:33:05] us
[1:33:06] is the life of jesus christ
[1:33:10] that's between us and god
[1:33:14] it's the only way
[1:33:16] and i'm so sorry but if there are some
[1:33:18] that believing that well my church
[1:33:20] believes this or i think this it does
[1:33:23] not matter
[1:33:24] what matters is what the word says
[1:33:27] that's what matters
[1:33:31] i don't want to follow the easier way
[1:33:33] right i want to follow the right way i
[1:33:35] don't care if it's easy or hard i want
[1:33:37] the right way amen
[1:33:42] it's the only way and the only sign that
[1:33:45] god will ever pass because it's the
[1:33:47] literal life of jesus christ returned
[1:33:50] back into the believer
[1:33:53] that's the way it has to be with every
[1:33:55] believer today filled with the holy
[1:33:57] ghost a token that the shed blood of the
[1:34:00] lamb that life that was in the lamb has
[1:34:03] returned back and is publicly sealed in
[1:34:07] there
[1:34:09] in other words everybody sees it
[1:34:12] that everybody passing by talking to you
[1:34:15] has an associates with you seeing the
[1:34:18] blood has been applied and the token of
[1:34:20] the life that was in that blood is now
[1:34:23] upon you
[1:34:24] and you're safe from the wrath and that
[1:34:27] alone not membership no sir nothing else
[1:34:32] but let the token itself be there the
[1:34:35] person of jesus christ his own life in
[1:34:38] you
[1:34:40] circumcise not this
[1:34:41] or that but circumcise the whole being
[1:34:45] till you
[1:34:46] and christ
[1:34:47] are one
[1:34:50] christ is in you
[1:34:52] and his life lives out through you so
[1:34:55] this is the same thing that we've been
[1:34:56] talking about coming into the image of
[1:34:58] jesus christ
[1:35:01] i know this is not the old
[1:35:03] you know
[1:35:06] christmas presents that the
[1:35:08] wise men brought and having a fun time
[1:35:13] but i'll tell you to receive the life of
[1:35:15] christ as the greatest president that we
[1:35:17] could ever have amen
[1:35:20] don't let the devil tell you
[1:35:24] that you have enough
[1:35:32] you should not stop until you see it on
[1:35:34] display
[1:35:37] and it doesn't matter how many people
[1:35:39] tell you you know down
[1:35:41] inside whether you've given your life
[1:35:43] over to jesus christ
[1:35:45] because that's what happens he takes
[1:35:47] over
[1:35:49] he says but let the token itself be
[1:35:51] there the person of jesus christ
[1:35:54] only when the token is displayed then
[1:35:56] the whole family must be under the token
[1:36:00] papa and mama
[1:36:02] i know how that you feel i've got
[1:36:04] children too
[1:36:06] i've got to see them saved
[1:36:08] i'm talking to myself today brother ram
