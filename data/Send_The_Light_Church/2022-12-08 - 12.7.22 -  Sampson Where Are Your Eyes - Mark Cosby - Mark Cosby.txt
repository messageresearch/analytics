you control of every Spirit Lord just take preeminence Lord in this in your church in your body Lord we ask all these things in Jesus Christ and we pray amen let's turn it I want to keep you standing too long and they've been standing for a while let's turn the judges 16 verse 4. so the Titleist little message is Sampson where are your eyes I know it's a a weird title but we'll get more into that is later the Lord is dealing this subject with me actually earlier this year probably January and he just directed me a different way uh other other messages before this message but he brought me back to this message so the Lord knows this timing so with his trust in him so judges 16 we're gonna read a couple couple verses and let you sit down because it's kind of lengthy I want you to stand for the whole entire thing so verse 4 and it came to pass afterward that he loved a woman in the valley of soric whose name was Delilah and the Lords of the Philistines came up unto her and said unto her entice him and see whether in his great strength lieth and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflict him and will give thee every one of us 1100 pieces of silver that's a lot of money and Delilah said to Samson tell me I pray thee wherein thy great strength life and wherewithal might be bound to afflict thee verse 7 in Sam to send her if they bind me with seven green wisps that were never dried then I shall be weak and be as another man verse 8 the Lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven green whiffs which had not been dried and she bound him with them now there were men lying in wait abiding with her in the chamber and said unto him the Philistines be upon these Samson and break the Wist as a threat of toe was broken when it touched the fire so his strength was not known and Delilah said in the Samson behold thou has mocked me and told me lies now tell me I pray thee wherewith thou mightest be bound verse 11 and he said in her if they abide me fast with new ropes that never were occupied then shall be weak and be as other man verse 12. Delilah therefore took new ropes and bound him there with and said unto him the Philistines be upon thee Samson but in the chamber and he break them from off his arms like a threat and Delilah said in the Samson hither thouest mocked me and told me lies tell me wherewith thou mightest be bound and he said unto her if I weavest the Seven Locks of my with my web notice it was getting closer and closer to his god-given gift and she fashioned it with the pen and said to him the Phil seems to be upon me and he waking out his sleep and went away with the pin of the beam and with the web verse 15. and he and she said unto him how Kenneth thou say I love thee when thy heart is not with me thouest mock me these three times and has told me we're in thy great strength life verse 16 and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him so the soul was vexed unto death maybe see you don't want to keep standing too long but I always point this out notice Samson was constantly flirting with Delilah we could say the world he was constantly playing games with her see Samson had a issue he had a woman problem a woman Chaser we could say that issue and Samson was constantly he had he said if verse 4 even says he loved this woman and so Samson was constantly trying to play with Delilah not realizing that he was slowly his eyes were getting blinded his spiritual eyes were getting blinded to the things of God and him not even realized that's how sin works it creeps in unawares and if you don't do anything about it it will take you to places that you don't want to go that's what that's what corruption does so let's keep it going so we've noticed and it came to pass when she pressed him daily she was constantly impressing him daily what is your secret what is your secret is your secret where's your secret and it says with her words and urged him so it vexed his soul unto death just like a lot it said his righteous Soul was vexed daily so it may not have affected a lot at the at the get-go but as the days went on the months one of the years went on it changed him verse 17 then he told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not a razor come upon my head for I've been in Nazarite until God from my mother's womb if I be shaving then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like any other man verse 18 and when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the Lords of the Philistines to say come up this once for you showed me all his heart and the Lords of the Philistines came up unto her and brought money in their hand and she made him sleep upon her knees and she called for a man and she calls him to shave off the Seven Locks of his head and she began to afflict him and his strength went from him verse 20 and she said the Philistines be upon thee Samson and he'll walk out of his sleep and said I will go out as other times before and shake myself and he wished not the Lord was departed from him so that last verse right there he didn't even know the Lord was departed from him he was so far gone so caught up in his the cares of this life the lust of the flesh the pride of life that he even realized the Lord was gone from him he thought he was still in the will of the Lord doing the and the Lord was still with him but his strength was gone from him and notice this out notice right here verse 21 but the Philistines took him and put his eyes out so he not only he loses spiritual eyes we're blinded but his natural eyes got put out all because of that one decision that he made he chose to to do what felt good to the flesh to stimulate the flesh it made it felt good but Samson didn't count the cost he didn't count that it would bring him this far that's what corruption would do that's where sin will do to you it may bring pleasure it may give you money and fame and all these things it may feel good but the end of it is death let's keep it going so verse 21 but the Philistines took him put his eyes out and brought him down to Gaza and bought him with feathers of brass and he did grind in the prison house howbeat the hair of his head began to grow after he was shaving so a man of God was put in mockery and embarrassment all because of one bad decision one bad decision he made to stay with this girl who was no good for him his parents warned him maybe even his Pastor warned him but he chose to do what felt good to the Flesh and we can get caught up in the same thing you may say brother Mark I'm not chasing after men or women but what Delilah is the type of the world what thing in the world are you chasing after that is taking you away from God Amen it may not be a a substantial thing you may notice now but the devil is constantly getting inches in your life and those inches will turn into miles so what what is in that in that Samson a woman chase her sure he was arrogant disobedient to his father and mother they told him not to go down there with that woman that Jezebel but he wouldn't listen to them what was it Samson had strength now listen Samson was willing to submit his strength Samson gave his strength to God but gave his heart to Delilah so notice he gave something to God but what God wants is our heart we can give God so many things but what God is looking for what's going to solidify everything in your life has given him your heart not just a one-time thing but a daily basis and if Samson gave his heart to God he would have avoided the way he had to go out he had to give his life in order to fulfill the purpose that God had for his life so that was I don't believe that was God's perfect will for him to do that but he had to go through the Proviso will to get to the perfect will and the same thing in our lives God if you're a child of God you're going to come one way or the other you can be dragged or you could just come now so my thing is surrender now don't wait don't wait until tomorrow wait till right now God is moving right now he found one in that day of Noah out of the tens and millions and millions people there's so many people like Samson today Samson gave God his strength but he wouldn't give him his heart God used his strength but not his heart Samson was somewhat a ladies man you know he just couldn't give him his heart he had to give it to Delilah but he gave his strength to God God used his strength but he couldn't use his heart that's all God wants that's what he wants formless he doesn't want your money he didn't want you to prestige he doesn't want your friends he just wants you that's all you want that's a desire from the foundation of the world he created a he created a perfect plan to bring you back to fellowship with him so why go any other way but his provided way God's provided way will bring peace and joy in your life the devil's provided way it will bring a temporal satisfaction but you're always constantly searching for this and that to fulfill that void that only Jesus can fulfill so just come to God don't wait until it's too late tomorrow's not even promised now we see Samson we said before he was flirting with Delilah which is the type of the world he was playing with fire so we see in verse 15 and 17 we read already that again and she said unto him how can it thou say I love thee she was seducing him with words and the devil likes to seduce you with things that you like to do which you love he knows your strengths and he knows your weaknesses he's been studying mankind for thousands of years so you can't fool the devil you can't he's he's the master of human intellects if we can say it that way he's a master of false wisdom if we could say it that way so he knows how to get in and get you off course but that's why it's so important for God to have your heart every day then the devil can't wiggle in and get in there because you've given your heart to God guys so we noticed that Samson made the biggest mistake of his life he compromised with the word and you can't even sin until first you lay aside God's word you can't even sin until that so whenever you get caught up in the Sin you first had to lay aside God's word to fulfill what felt good to you praise God let's keep it going so so a lot of times we constantly just play with fire constantly constantly constantly and eventually you'll get burned and why do we get so caught up in our own lives that we forget about God because we're walking in the flesh instead of the spirit see it's easy to walk in the flesh it's easy to put my car in cruise control and not even have to touch the gas pedal it's easy so our nature is like that we like to go on cruise control let's put it in default and just fill fill in the emotions we don't serve God by emotions we serve them by faith because emotions are like a roller coaster up and down because because happiness is based upon your circumstances but the joy of the Lord it doesn't matter the circumstance it doesn't matter circumstance so now our our eyes can also get clouded our spiritual eyes see Faith doesn't see what the these carnal eyes it sees it's an unseen substance that you you can't necessarily grab and touch it's something you I can't give brother John in a bottle and give it to them it's something you have to believe and know that's going to happen and it's due time that's what faith is so let's go to Second Corinthians chapter 2 verse 9 through 11. so these examples Samson in the Bible wasn't just put for some story just to read that's a good story but it's put for example for us to not follow after is for us to look back in the scriptures and see if Samson made that same mistake with flirting with the world then I need to not make that mistake I need to learn from his mistake and do the exact opposite that's what these scriptures are putting here for the when it says the examples they're in samples for us they're not just some good old story you read oh it's a good story uh no it's for you to actually look in study and see what led up to Samson to come to this point in his life see a lot of times we don't look what leads up to the mistakes of our life we say oh it's a mistake and let's move on but look back research study what things led me to making this the bad decisions in my life what led Samson well Samson never got delivered of being a woman chaser it was constantly he was always after women if you notice before that verse it says he he went into a harlot and then right into Delilah so all these things he never dealt with like but Moses he never dealt with his anger that's why he hit the rock instead of spoke to the Rock David same thing he had a woman problem as well see a lot of things see God can call you to a calling and bless you but you can't use that as a crutch not to get delivered or something that you've been struggling with because God wants to use you in a magnitude of a way but if you're still holding on to this thing shruggling with this thing say well it's gonna I'll put this underneath the rug what happened to David it came out what happened to Samson that came out and yes God forgave David but his relationship was never the same he got his son was after him it's just all these things that he could have avoided if he would have dealt with it from the get-go right so don't just think well I've been serving God for X number of years he's going to look past this thing no God wants to deliver you but you have to show him that you want Deliverance it's not just a magic wand he just lays old God just deliver me this and I'm gonna still hold on to it you gotta let go first you have to second Corinthians let me get there myself praise God so it says sort of verse 9. for to this end also they are right that I might know the proof of you whether you be obedient in all things to whom you forgive anything I forgive also for if I forgave anything to whom I forgave it for your sakes forgave it I in the person of Christ verse 11 blessed Satan get an advantage of us for we are not ignorant of his devices so the only way that we we can be ignorant or not ignorant as devices if we're walking in the spirit if we're following with the Lord is calling us too because Satan is cunning and crafty but if we're in God in his word we're going to be aware the scripture tells us to be sober and Vigilant so we are sober and Vigilant you're constantly looking Each corner because we because you you got to study your enemy your enemy study you why don't you study him because he's the same old devil from the beginning of the same thing he did to Adam and Eve he's doing to us this may be a new age but he's still doing the same thing the pride of life the lust of the flesh he stood in all these things it may be disguised and something different maybe disguise and being a workaholic maybe disguising as Samson's a woman Chaser may be disguised and whatever you fill in the blank a TV show whatever it could be any of those things but it's still the same devil so let's not be ignorant to his devices because Paul said right here he says for we are not ignorant of his devices because Paul Paul even knew Satan was cunning and crafty so you know what Paul did even after 30 years he said oh that I may know him so the more you get to know Christ a lot easier is going to be to pinpoint what the devil is trying to do he's trying to kill Seek and Destroy in the old kind of way he'll use it he'll try politics anything he'll use to try to kill Seek and Destroy he doesn't care what movement it is black lives matter whatever it is he doesn't care he'll use it in his hand I want to point something out in judges 16 verse 20. like we said before Samson didn't even realize that the Lord was departed from him imagine that he just assumed well the Lord called me I'm good to go I'm okay you know I'm a minister I'm okay I don't have to do this I don't have to pray today I don't have to seek the Lord out today I can take today off but look what happened to Samson look what happened to him that's why we need to be watching and praying daily don't don't let your in the spirit prayer life slip away because when you just pray just to check off the Box you're doing yourself no good God rather have you not even pray for it's going to just check off the Box God is looking for a Believer who wants to fall more in love with him God is looking for a Believer who wants his spiritual eyes open on a daily basis God wants to give you ears to hear but how can he give you ears to hear if you're not willing even to spend time with him let's go to Matthew 26 41. Matthew 26 41 very friendly scripture so Jesus speaking here in verse 41 watch and pray that's the two first things he said so if Jesus told us to watch him pray we should be watching and praying every day and he says and he gives you the reason why that you enter not into temptation the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak so your inner man wants God he wants to serve God but if you're not feeding him how can he ever Prosper if I'm going to the gym if I want to go to the gym and I want to get fit eat healthy and all these things if I'm only putting one day a week in every month once a month I'm not going to grow properly I'm not going to lose the weight I want so I'm not getting the muscle I want to so the same thing with your spiritual walk if you're not putting in 24 7 hours a day 24 hours a day seven days a week you can't just come to church and expect your spiritual life just to grow abundantly it's going to come into a halt because God isn't looking for a part-time believer you know you have part-time workers but he's looking for a full-time worker a full-time believer who wants God on all aspects of their life so a lot of times willing to put God in certain aspects of Our Lives I want God in this area I want God just to save me from Hell or I want God to lead me to the house he wants me to buy out of the car he wants me to buy but what does God want to do with your life what what direction he's going to lead you how does he want to use you does he want maybe he doesn't want you to take that job with that car or maybe he wants you to do this see a lot of times we need to be asking God for the more important things yes yes he wants you to prosper in these other things and health and all these things but what about your soul what does God want with that what kind of he wants to change you so he can use you he can't just use you if you're not being changed on a daily basis that's what happened to many Believers many people leave serving God because they aren't seeking after the right thing he says seek me with all your heart amen amen amen let's go to Romans 8. so it's our reverse one there's therefore no now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit notice that right right off the bat is starting off heavy it's saying who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so it showed me right there off the get-go that if I want to serve Christ in the fullness that he wants me to serve him I have to not walk after the flesh but I have to walk in the spirit it's the only way verse 2 for the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death verse 3. from what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son the likeness of his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh four sin condemned sin in the flesh so why why do we choose the way of death when God sent his son that we could walk in the way of life see why do we choose these things because when we go to the pleasures of sin and we get caught up in these things yeah sometimes we make the same mistake over and over again knowing that the same result is going to happen so why do we do these things because we're not connected properly with God we're not spending time in prayer see I tell you prayer is so key if you want growth in your life spend time on your knees let God speak back to your heart let God begin to deal with you and a lot of times God will tell us something to do and we don't want to do it then God is not obligated to say anything else to you until you first do that right this is truth it's the truth anyhow amen because God honors faithfulness as simple as that if you're faithful to God he'll be faithful to you it's that's how simple it is we make things so complicated God is hidden Simplicity for a reason a lot of times people will preach some guy that's out here but he's a personal God that wants to be in your life the first thing you got to do is accept them right right that's all you it's so simple accept them into your heart and say Lord I want to do whatever you want me to do whatever Direction you want in my life whatever things you want me to let go help me Lord give me the strength to let these things go because I want to serve you with everything that I have and as simple as that face down verse uh verse 4 that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us that's our honor and a privilege who walked not after the flesh but after the spirit noticing he's saying the same thing again because that's how important it is verse 5 and then he goes in and explain for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be Carly minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace so a lot of times we choose that first part of the sentence and every time it's going to bring death in your life and then we question why because you chose to to use your carnal mind instead of being spiritually minded that's why it says let this mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus and notice the mind of Christ it was to always please the father it was to be a servant to others it was willing to wash somebody's feet and that's how that that's the mind of Christ the mind of Christ he said I do nothing but the father shows me who said in the men's meeting because the carnal mind is enmity against God God hates our carnal nature our carnal mind for it's not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they there in the flesh cannot please God so you can't even please God in your flesh but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be the spirit of God dwell in you that's why it's so important to have a nature change because you can't serve God unless you have a nature change because your nature that you're you're built with can only go so far you can accept God I believe Jesus died on the cross but thou by the far as it'll go because once again your nature and God's nature are night and day that's why it says in Ezekiel he needs to put a new spirit within you give you a new heart and then you can't stop there because he wants to put his Spirit In You see a lot of times Believers they'll get delivered of alcoholism cigarette addiction uh whatever you can name it you keep naming them all and they'll stop right there at the sanctification but they never go into the baptism of the Holy Ghost the pro the new birth process because a new birth you see things different when you when a new birth happens is not just all you're all said and done even as rest that's when the battle really begins that's when you really have to start fighting and crucifying the flesh that's what it has that's what it has to be that's the way that's God's provided way for us to get back to how we work that's God's provided away we're still in these bodies he didn't come to redeem these bodies but he came to redeem what's inside of here that's what God is trying to build what's inside of here your soul is so important to God more than this outward body body because he has a body prepared for you but right now we need to be focusing on what's in here and what's going on here is being is properly being filled with the right things then you're going to be serving others you're going to be washing others feet you're going to be feeding on prayer because you'll know I'm pretty sure all businesses this area where you just know you're struggling and you know exactly why you're struggling but you're not making the right effort to put the right things in to stop the struggling you just think that oh I'm gonna keep doing this and it's all going to change that's Madness if you're trying to do the same thing over again it'll be so easy if you say you know what I'm going to fix this problem right now I'm gonna spend more time in prayer I'm gonna spend more time on the word because if I don't I'm going to get further away as it'll be harder to get it's so hard once a fire is put out to relight it that's why it's so best to keep putting coal in the fire and keep feeding on the word keep praying that's how you build that fire says verse 10 and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness but the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ in the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you verse 12 therefore brethren we are not debtors not to the flesh to live after the flesh I believe Paul said I forgot where but this Liberty that God has given us don't use it as a cloak for the flesh you have Liberty in Christ but the Liberty that the society is teaching us is not the same Liberty God is teaching us there are night and day things see Liberty he's giving you is to serve him so he can use you because at first Satan had you in his grips you're in the bondage of Satan and God took those chains off and released you and freed you now you have a choice whether you either can say Lord I can do whatever I want or Lord I'm going to do what you want me to do because you may not say those exact words and people say oh I'm still living for God but if you're doing your own thing not serving God I don't care what you say you're not serving God because if your life isn't matched in the description I understand all our lives and right now it's not mentioned in the scripture that's okay but make sure the light that God is giving you right now is matching with it that's the most important thing because if you can follow the light that God has given you right now he can give you more light to follow but if you're not following that light right now then you're gonna be blind Samson was blind his walk stop right there at that moment because he chose to to do what stimulated his flesh and oh it felt so good to him it felt so good you know him showing off for Delilah you know breaking the ropes off his arms it felt good but when the time got rough when Delilah left him she wasn't there she left you didn't hear nothing from her after that nothing so this shows you we got to make sure what we're putting all our time and investing in what what time you have invested in your life where is all your time and your resources going to it's such a key thing because we can be busy but just because you're busy doesn't mean you're going anywhere I could be running in place and sweating if I'm not going anywhere I'm in the same spot right now don't let's not do what Samson did let's not have to do unnecessary uh sufferings God yes yes we should be suffering for the right things for character not suffering for no reason because we made a stupid decision I don't care how good it feels or how right it may seem to you living in the flesh as it says ye shall die it says that in Romans Romans 8 13. it's no excuse why we should be living below our privileges it's no excuse as Sons and Daughters of God we shouldn't be God has called us to such a higher calling we don't have to live below what Satan says with live below but let's live the standards of God let's go to Galatians 5. foreign serving God for five years 10 years or a year he still wants to use you and put him put himself in you all it takes is you say Lord I Surrender I surrender all verse 14 in Galatians 5. for all the laws fulfilled in one word even in this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself but if he bite and devour one another take heed that ye be not consumed one of another verse 16. notice how the scripture just doves till it's talking about the flesh again this I say then walk in the spirit and he shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so notice the scripture is constantly bringing in our remembrance that we need to be walking in the spirit it's constantly bringing to our memories that our flesh is weak and if we go to default nature we'll automatically go in the flesh I always love this this quote about the white dog and a black dog it's a white dog and a black dog inside of you the white dog is your spirit man and a black dog is your fleshly man because say it that way and whatever you feed the most is what's going to come out on top so if you feed the black dog the black dog is going to come out on top if you feed the white dog the white dogs that come on top is that is it simple as that it's like if I eat pizza every day I'm going to gain weight if I eat chicken salmon vegetables juice I'm going to be healthy as simple as simple as that verse 17 for the flesh lusteth against the spirit and the spirit against the flesh so knows there's a constant war between these two in you constant War but if you be led it says Spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary the one to the other so you cannot do the things that you would but if you be led of the spirit you're not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery fornication you may say well I'm not fornicating well you can also be guilty of spiritual fornication not being true to your lord and savior so it says uncleanness lasciviousness I looked that word up so it's tendency to excite lust and promote irregular indulgences indulgences that's what that means so idolatry we know idolatry means you don't have to be serving some wooden Idol but anything you put before God can become an idol your car your house your job everything can become an idol if you make it so anything you put before God is an idol in witchcraft oh I'm not practicing witchcraft witchcraft is more than just that you're actually having a relationship with Satan we can say it that way a personal walk with him if you say it that way it could be witchcraft as well it doesn't have to be sorcery and spell books but it's a little bit more than that as well hatred variance emulations Wrath Strife seditions heresies wait there's more envings murders drunkenness revealiness and such of the which I tell you before as I have also told you in time past so look how many avenues that Satan can work in amen he can work in so many Avenues in these things that can can creep up in your life so it says if I told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God so if we're caught up in these things it could be any one of these things we can be caught up into we're not going to inherit the kingdom of God God's not just going to come because you have pretty looks and you look good and you drive a nice car he doesn't care about those things be honest with you because all those things are going to pass away but what he carries right here what he cares about is in verse 22 but the thru of the spirit is love Joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law that's what's important are these fruits being manifested in your life on a daily basis or are these other fruits being manifested in your life that's the question we should be asking ourselves that's why brother Branham said it's important to always check your motive why are you doing what you're doing the thing that you're doing right now is it leading you to God or from God we got to be honest we got to do a self-examination in our life on a daily basis because if we do not Satan will have a field day with you he will tell you all these lies and say well you're doing good you're still serving God you're not like that other person right here who's in the bar or who's uh doing this and doing that and we get when he hits you with that you begin to feel comfortable relax lazy and the spirit of this age is to feel like that I'm in need of nothing naked poor wretched blind and not even knowing it it's all talking about the spiritual thing verse 24 then they that are Christ knows that in order to be Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust verse 25 if we live in this spirit let us also walk in the spirit we know it's the children of Israel they were living in the spirit they saw all these things being done they saw Mana fall down they saw the Red Sea being parted but they never they never walked in the spirit they never took God at his word so you can live in the spirit but not walk in the spirit it's the truth you can that's why Paul said let us also walk in the spirit let's live and walk because you can be in a wonderful service where God's just moving oh it's a good service and then the next day forget all about it you were in the spirit that moment you were you were feeling it oh it was touching your heart but if you choose not to run with it then it's going to stay here at church let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another and envying one another so the first step in being in the spirit is crucifying your flesh denying your will for the whole day the next step is living for others because that's what Christ did he had to deny his flesh as well and what did he do he lived for others he lived for others that they may have life so let's let's live for others that we may Point them to life amen because we may not be able to give them life personally but we can lead them to the life Giver and that's our that's our that's our our goal in our design that's what God's desire is when he fills you with the Holy Spirit is to use you to finish the works that he could not do because you and I weren't born yet amen amen so he wants to use you he'll give you he'll give you a business use that as a use that as a way to witness to somebody because when God gives you something it shouldn't take you away from police so if God blesses you something don't use it as an excuse for it to take you away from him because a lot of times well what God gave me is business I want to use it as that no don't make that excuse if God gave you something have we need to have a balance perfect balance let's go to First Corinthians chapter 6. so a balance is so key in our lives we can't have a we need to have a only a perfect balances in the Lord that's the only thing that can get you perfectly balanced and I believe a prayer life will help you with that if you don't have a prayer life you can't have a walk with God I'm sorry it's the truth you just can't that's what God's provided a way is to have personal fellowship with you he wants you to he wants to hear your heart he wants you to pour your heart out so he wants you to hide away and see don't hide away in a secret place only when times of trouble are are Awakening but getting that secret place when everything's all hunky-dory when the flowers are beautiful get in that prayer closet because a lot of times we'll wait until we get down in the valley to get in the prayer closet but let's get serious right now on the Mountaintop so when we get to the valley it won't surprise us that's how our prayer life should really be that David was a man of desperation he was desperate for God to move in his life he's desperate to hear from the Lord even even guys had a man after my own heart let's be after guys on her you go 19 through 20 verse 6. what know you not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and you are not your own see these bodies that we have we're borrowing them they're not ours God has given you this body and he's we're going to be judged how we used our body so a lot of times we'll misuse our body to do our own will or whatever it is I I got a tattoo at one point in my life and I was convicted about getting it and I still went ahead and did it now I have to live with that first of my life did God forgive me yes but it's still a mark to remind me of what I did so it's so important it says for you are bought with a price therefore glorified God it says right here in your body and in your spirit right which are Gods so your body and your spirit are both Gods amen we come from God we go back to God Amen amen so now we're going to be judged on how we used our time see time is the most valuable currency in the world because it's something that you can't get back once you lose it so I could be here today gone tomorrow life is so short so let's use our time for the things of God for the kingdom of God that's what's gonna at the end of the desk what's gonna matter the most What's Done For Christ I could get a million awards first place but I can't like I can't say Lord you see all these first place on my wall all these trophies I got he's not going to care about that he's going to be like what'd you do what'd you do for my kingdom what would you do with your life all these things are going to pass away so we're we never forget we're bought with the price and if we crucify our flesh daily and living for others we'll recognize that that this body and spirit are for the Lord to use on a daily basis he wants to use you so I remember this is something this uh a quote brother Brandon said that uh it pertains to ministers I believe pertains to everyone there's three things I've noticed in Reading history that wrecks a Minister's life from the start one of them is money the love of it the next is popularity when he thinks he's something when he's nothing anyhow and next is women that's right man takes money women in popularity that's been three major things that God's has trouble with his children many of the other things that goes along with it too but the main thing is when God begins to bless a brother and to give him something a little more or something another to help the people then that man begins to think see who am I right then he's on the road down you want me to tell you how to get up get down that's the way up is go down he that humbles himself God will exalt is that right he exalts himself will be a beast so you may say well I'm not a minister but these things can pertain to your life God could bless you with a new job a six-figure salary whatever it may be and you can choose to either be prideful about that or be humble about it because it doesn't have to be all it could be one of these three things it could be popularity you know you can get a Ministry or whatever it is you get a nice your manager whatever it is these things can draw you away if you let them as I said before when God blesses you with something don't use his excuse for you just to go in cruise control guys expect you to be a steward over those things a steward of your time suit of your business a steward of your children all these things he's he's placed in your path for you to raise your kids in the right way now you make either one one or two choices I'm gonna serve I'm gonna raise my children the way I think or the way God wants me to see that you pick one or the other it's no Switzerland I'm gonna do one of the I'm gonna do both either you're doing God's way or Satan's way that's only two things you can do you can't mix the two because Jesus said you can't serve God in men at the same time it's impossible I think many times we are always think we're seeing things with the spiritual eye but the thing is we don't take the time to make sure that's what it says in first first John 4 1. to try this spirit says to try the spirit and see it be of me let's turn there real quick first John chapter 4. so it says verse one beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world how many has been deceived or tricked nobody wow all right did we did we at that point in our time did we try the spirit we just assumed that we were going away God wanted us to but the scriptures play and tell us that we need says believe on every spirit try the spirits where they are of God because many false prophets are gone into the world Satan likes to act like he's God and he'll use some of the word but not all the word to deceive you he did the same thing to eat look the same Satan knows in the garden still the same Satan today still doing the same things he did the Eve that got her to disbelief one percent of the word less than one percent of the word actually laughs verse two hereby know ye the spirit of God every spirit that confesses that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God and every spirit that confesses not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that Spirit of antichrist wherefore you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world you are the children of God little children have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he's in the world so we play a part we can't just say well God's gonna do everything we play a part we got to be trying the spirit we got to be feeding upon the spirit of God see how you can try the spirit is you get to know God it's as I said that you get to know your enemy get to know your person your savior in a personal way and you can know the way he exactly talks to you because he's not going to talk the same way always he talks to Brother John as he talked to me he can speak to me different ways speak to sister Anna different ways brother Roger in different ways so you need to get acquainted with your personal Savior and know when he's he's talking to you personally you got to get tuned in that radio frequency so there's no static but you know that you know that you know that what he said to you also has to line up with the scriptures because God's not going to say anything that's going to disprove his word it's going to have to lie on the scriptures every time that's the dovetail let's go Revelations uh 3 15-18 so we look at Samson's life he was after was Samson still doing the will of God in a way yes he was in a way but eventually it got to a point in the standstill in his life where it overcame him because Samson was after the things of the flesh that's why his spiritual eyes were put out he was still killing Philistines he was but he wasn't following God with all his heart God can still use you partially in certain ways but I want God to be able to use me to win souls that's my heart's desire because if you look in Matthew 7 . I guess to kind of validate what I just said in Matthew 7. many will come to me today say Lord Lord did we not cast out demons and heal the sick they did these things but they missed what God was calling them for was a personal walk was God using them yes but they were blinded spiritually because they assumed they were doing what God wanted to do even knowing deep in their heart they weren't notice that knowing deep in their heart they weren't they still thought that those other things could supplement for what they weren't doing and Samson taught the same thing well I'm still you know killing Philistines for God I could you know have a little fun with Delilah over here you know I love her and everything but look what happened to him so the same thing happened to him can happen to us verse 15 verse Revelations 3 15. let's go verse 14 actually jump up there and into the angel we heard this how many times we probably read these scriptures these very ones how many times probably thousands but the thing is it's not just about reading it but it's really about getting in to seeing what God was saying to this church now to the angel of the Church of laodiceans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot so these believers they believe that Jesus Christ died upon the cross they believe he died for his sins they believe all these things but they had a form of godliness and they denied the power of because they were lukewarm and God hates a lukewarm believer in fact he said I'll spew it out of my mouth the Pharisees they read scripture they prayed they fasted but they weren't really Believers because he said either your father the devil that's what he told him straight up and these people they didn't they married right they didn't have fornication they did everything they thought they did everything the law said but what they missed what Moses said I'll send a prophet unto you like it unto me let's keep going verse 15. I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that were cold or hot verse 16. so then because they were lukewarming either cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou says I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing notice how many Church fancy churches they have the stained glass windows all these things they have they're putting so much into the outside appearance but they're not putting what's into here God doesn't care how nice your church looks how many stained glass windows you can put how big a congregation is how many food suppers you do I'm not saying you can't do food suppers but those those things have its place charity all these things have to have their place but what God cares about is what is your your state are you hot or cold that's what God's caring about because that's why he's he's given a warning to these people in this age and warning to all of us because thou says I am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and notice not that thou are a wretched miserable poor blinded naked now if you saw someone running across the street naked you would think something's wrong with them you would want to help him even maybe but these Believers are spiritually naked they don't even know it they don't even have God they're not even born again and filled with the Holy Spirit but they think they are I rather I'd rather be filled with the Holy Spirit and not know it and striving to be filled with the Holy Spirit than to think I'm filled with the Holy Spirit and not fill the holy spirit that was a mouthful to say but I think you get what I'm saying so I'd rather be seeking for more Holy Ghost than to lean on the side of well I got it I'm good verse 18. he's given him an opera he's right now he's given his hand out to them to even to us I counsel you to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white Remnant thou Mays be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with Isaac that thou mayest see as many as I love I rebuke and Chase and notice this be zealous therefore and repent repentance is such key it's a keystone it touches the heart of God because when we repent we're saying Lord I did this wrong and I'm turning away from what I've done I'm not going back to that wallow I was in I'm going right to you that's what true repentance is you can't just say Lord forgive me and go right back into doing it that's not repentance that's sinning willfully that's all that is so it says behold I stand at the door and not if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and will sup with him and he with me so he's knocking at the door of your heart right now I hope you've let him in because he's a gentleman he's not going to blow it up with a grenade or C4 but he's gonna keep knocking till you open that door see a lot of times we want to be brought out of our situation where it might be in a low a low point in our life and we want to get all these things the counseling and to other people in these books but why not go to Jesus he'll take you out of any situation you're in yeah but you have to be willing to let them into your heart first a lot of times we think Jesus is some some dirty grandfather or some Santa Claus some Easter Bunny he's not any of those things he's not here just to run some errands for you he's here to change your life he's here to make you new to make you whole but you have to be willing to say Lord please make me whole whatever it takes I'm willing to do it to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and sat down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear to hear Let Him hear what the spirit say unto the churches so we need ears our ears need to be circumcised we got to be able to hear what God is speaking to us individually but you don't expect the pastor to have all your Revelations when you ask them a question you got to seek it for yourself your pastor is put there for a specific reason not to not to be God for you but to lead you to God that's what he's there for so let's be your spiritual guide for a reason he's not here just to end servicing a little problem you have in your life that's what see God wants to be that that person he wants to be the problem solving in your life but you gotta let God let go and have his way inside of you you gotta be willing to say Lord how can I solve this problem the way you want me to solve it Lord give me the wisdom to handle the situation because the last time I tried in my way and it just I made more problems in this in my life see a lot of times we want to fix something but we put more problems in it that's not how God works when God fixes a problem it's fixed just like that so that's why he says my ways are not your ways and my thoughts are not your thoughts we need to start say Lord help me to think more like you help me to do like you do because your ways are your strength's perfect like that song we sung yeah like five minutes that's uh you go Genesis 3 6. time just flies huh so we know the three six so it says and when the woman saw the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and also gave unto her husband with her and he did eat so notice that she casts aside God's word looked at the tree listen to Satan and saw that it was good for food and it was pleasant to her eyes but imagine if she stuck with the word of God she would have cast these things out so anytime we get caught in a trap we do the same thing that she did we said oh this is good this feels good to me it's Pleasant to my eyes and look what happened to her they ate it and they had that's why death struck all of us that's all we have to die and get old because of that one decision so what makes think think that we if we make that same decision that we don't have to pay a price it's different now if you do it ignorantly don't know it but if you already know it and you're doing it then you have to pay a price I don't know what the price may be but you have to pay a price but why do we choose to pay a price we can go the opposite way and to stick to his word and go verse seven in the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked they saw fig leaves Together made themselves apron like we said before Delilah was pleasant to his carnal eyes what thing in the world has been Pleasant to you what thing in the world has been taking away from your walk with Christ what's taking you away from living a fully surrendered life in Christ what's taking you away from from the Lord moving in your life the way he wants you to move I can't answer that question for you but you have to answer that self inside get we gotta get back in the prayer closet I believe five ten five to seven years ago we probably spent a lot more time in prayer and this age we're living in is wicked and we need more prayer is going to change the direction of your life more than any help book more than any you fill in the blame motivational video anything is going to change prayer now notice we said before it made Samson feel good it stimulated his flesh but but what it did was in return gave him blinded spiritual eyes every time you go to the flesh it's going to Blind your spiritual eyes every single time [Applause] now notice this before the children of Israel Their Eyes Were blinded because they chose not to go God's provided way they chose they want to use God as a dirty grandfather as Santa Claus instead of taking God out of his word let's be like Joshua and Caleb they were willing to go whatever God led him to they were willing to conquer whatever God told them they can conquer if God said you can overcome that Addiction in your life is God so you can overcome whatever in your life then you can overcome it because no no demon no devil can stand in the presence of God okay when Jesus went and Lead when in the presence of legion it bowed it says oh you come to torment me already so the same thing in our lives if we're connected in the right Source there's no demon no devil no addiction that can stay into your life that's right let me read a couple quotes you know and I got two more scriptures in our clothes I promise our eyes need to be open another reason our eyes should be open that is when we come into the house of the Lord we see his Spirit beginning to move and perform things just the way he said it would be done amen and we set with our eyes closed now I know that's true they set with their eyes closed and say well I don't know it it could be mental telepathy and it could be a fortune teller a lot of times we need to come with our eyes open bring God with you to church don't expect the preacher to bring God for you but you bring God to church you you prepare your heart and your prayer closet up until service so God can move in your life because God isn't going to move in your life if you're lazy he says not if I go to work and I say you know boss I'm only going to work for two hours and the rest of the time was gonna relax I'm not gonna get paid I'm gonna get fired so same thing in our walk with God God isn't God isn't going to just you know will you in the car all the way through he expects you to get up and run run this race he's called us to a race for a reason and this race is between you and your carnal flesh your biggest enemy is yourself you're the only person that's going to stop you from living a a a high life in Christ is yourself the way you think the way you act they're going to determine the destination you're going to go amen the kind of friends you're surrounded with you're the average of the five friends you spend the most time with I never forget that quote I read this a long time ago I read that some of this motivational speaker said that it's the truth because the people you hang around with you're gonna do you're gonna gravitate to their ideals their habits their ways that's why I surround myself with people who are I won't say better than me I I want to say it that way but people who Point me higher if I say it that way people who are going to point me to high directions high places they're going to help me grow and point me to growth because if I if you surround yourself with people who aren't going anywhere and eventually either you influence them they're going to influence you it's no Switzerland that's how it goes like we're walking together either we're going to match my Pace I'm gonna match your pace one or the other we need our spiritual eyes to be open if we want to be effective in God's kingdom we need our minds pure and unadulterated Samson could have avoided all the trouble we got into if he didn't let the enemy blind his spiritual eyes the enemy Works subtle he will put little things out of place in your life until you go further than you want to go if you give a man shall take a mile the enemy like I said before knows your weakness he's been studying mankind for so many years I came across this quote like a couple weeks ago says he be dares to put a picture of a complete new woman but he knows just how much clothes to take off with her to make her tempting sure he does so Satan knows exactly so he can't get you with an extreme but if he can get you just to kind of compromise this a little bit and he can get you he knows human nature he knows how to catch you in it too and he's awake day and night see Satan's Working Day and Night why do we take time off you know if Satan's working day and night to see try to deceive you then why are we taking time off then we wonder why we get deceived because we're taking time off isn't that serving God isn't punching in time clock and punching out it's not right in your dailies what you're doing from this time this time but it's a full of life a sold out Life Lock Stock and Barrel like a roaring line devouring that he will certainly he is so there he just knows how to do that let's go to first John like two more minutes maybe like three and I'm close [Applause] so first John chapter two and go verse 15 through 17. love not the world neither the things that are in the world If any man loved the world the love of the father is not in him verse 16 for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not in the father but isn't of the world so notice that these three things Satan will Target at you he can pick one of the three things the same thing with Jesus the same thing with Eve the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life if he can get you with one of these three things he'll have you because it says is not of the father not one of those three things of the father but is of the world foreign so the thing is in order for you not to be deceived by that you have to be sober and be vigilant we said before you have to be you have to realize that your Devil is a cunning adversary that he's a good opponent and you have to make sure like for a boxing match if it's two boxers are facing in the one boxer says well I'm gonna train you know just the first week and I'm not gonna train anymore then chances are that boxer is going to lose the match so if you know it's a boxer they're both training constantly eating the right things working out getting the right trainer same thing in our walk we got to make sure we're training properly that we're eating our spiritual Wheaties that we're we're feeding on the right things that we're not watching all these things we shouldn't be watching because a lot of things we don't realize a lot of things radar movies and things like that there's Spirits behind them so music worldly Music Experience behind them and that Spirit can grab a hold of you and take you further than you wanted to go but in the Garden of Eden the devil chose the man's head God his heart and now the Devil comes into intellectuals and has brought his religion to intellectual you know never know God intellectually you've got to know him by a new birth being born again which comes from the heart the pride of life the lust of the flesh what the eyes can see but when God comes in he goes into a man's heart and makes him believe things by faith that his eyes cannot see the devil just switched it around and he's doing it to the Pentecostal Church praise God let's we can rise it's a closing statement our eyes in this age need to be open more than ever because Satan knows his time is short Satan knows he wants to get as many people he can on the board with him because he knows where his end is he may not know what the exact day is but if he can get you to compromise if he can get you to this not believe one word he has you right in his traps so let's not be like Samson did he go in the perfect will of God at the end yes he did but that's not the way that God intended for him to go out because he was humiliated and embarrassed all because he chose to go the lust of the flesh the lust of the flesh will destroy you every time it will make unnecessary scars in your life that you don't have to have see God doesn't want you to have unnecessary scars I got many scars in my life for not listening to the Lord but that was my choice and I don't want you guys to make the same choices that I made doesn't matter how old you are hung you are make that choice today make Christ accept him as your personal Savior and don't stop there we're making the Lord of your life he wants ownership and lordship of your life a lot of people to stop at savior but let's make him Lord of everything like that son says Jesus be Lord of all that's what he wants let's sing Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah [Music] oh yeah [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah [Music] Hallelujah [Music] praise our God [Music] praise our God [Music] praise our God

it profit me if I don't know you in the right way because Lord I don't want to know you based upon intellects but Lord I Want to Know You by spiritual Revelation Lord Lord may we constantly just be seeking and hungering for Spiritual Revelation from you Lord just open your word up to us Lord Lord may we get to know you Lord this is Paul said oh that may know you cause Lord we don't wanna get we

do Lord I want to do it Lord I don't want to put underneath the rug and think it'll go away but Lord I want to when you say go I want to go when you say give this up I want to give it up when you say no I want to say Lord thank you for saying no because I know it's just as good as a yes nor there's anybody today Lord who's struggling with giving their heart to you Lord may you just help them Lord to recognize that this is the only life that pays off this is the only life that'll ever amount to anything we could do all we can get a Nobel Peace Prize but Lord if we don't know you that Nobel Peace Prize is going to wither away Lord From This Day Forward we just give our hearts unto you we give our lives unto you Lord shape us and motives make us into that that sculpture that you want us to do Lord that Lord when you say go speak to that individual who will speak to him when you say go pray we'll pray and Lord we thank you once again Lord for this being a present help in present time

God who wants to just touch us Lord who wants to Deliver Us from things that have been hindering us you're a high priest they can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities and we thank you for knowing Lord you were tempted just like we were and you overcame it Lord Lord may you be able to do the overcoming in our life Lord may we move so far out the way crucify our flesh so much Lord that you could just overcome in our lives for us Lord because it's your power and your strength Lord that gives us the power to overcome we can't deal within ourselves we're a weak Lord I'm we're weak but
