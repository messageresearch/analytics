[38:35] today we commit all things into your
[38:36] hands now for we ask it in jesus
[38:38] christ's name amen
[38:41] amen revelations chapter
[38:44] 21
[38:45] starting with verse number one
[38:47] and i saw a new heaven
[38:49] and a new earth
[38:51] for the first heaven and the first earth
[38:53] were passed away
[38:55] and there was no more sea
[38:57] nigh john
[38:58] saw the holy city
[39:00] new jerusalem coming down from god out
[39:02] of heaven prepared as a bride adorned
[39:05] for her husband
[39:07] i heard a great voice out of heaven
[39:10] saying behold the tabernacle of god is
[39:12] with men
[39:13] and
[39:14] will dwell with them
[39:16] and i'm sorry and he will dwell with
[39:18] them and they shall be his people and
[39:20] god himself shall be with them and be
[39:22] their god
[39:24] god shall wipe away all tears from their
[39:26] eyes
[39:27] there shall be no more death neither
[39:29] sorrow nor crying neither shall there be
[39:32] any more pain
[39:33] for the former things are passed away
[39:37] and he that sat upon the throne said
[39:39] behold i make all things new
[39:42] he said unto me right
[39:45] for these words are true and faithful he
[39:48] said unto me it is done i am the alpha
[39:50] and omega the beginning of the end i
[39:52] will give unto him that is a thirst of
[39:56] the fountain of the water of life freely
[39:58] he that overcometh shall inherit all
[40:00] things and i will be his god
[40:03] he shall be my son
[40:06] but the fearful
[40:08] and unbelieving the unbombable and the
[40:11] murders and whoremongers
[40:13] sorcerers and idolaters and all liars
[40:16] shall have their part in the lake of
[40:18] fire which burneth
[40:20] uh in the lake which
[40:22] burneth with fire and brimstone
[40:24] which is the second death
[40:27] amen god bless you you may be seated
[40:30] it was kind of uh
[40:34] i should say it kind of didn't want to
[40:36] end on that last verse there was not a
[40:38] real
[40:39] encouraging verse but
[40:42] the reason i i wanted to read that is
[40:44] because
[40:46] god's going to make everything new
[40:48] he's going to make us new
[40:51] but if we're fearful we don't believe
[40:53] that we end up in the same place as all
[40:55] those who just don't care
[40:57] and it's important that we believe
[41:03] most people
[41:07] do not change
[41:11] they do continue to manifest more and
[41:14] more what they are
[41:15] in that sense they change but they never
[41:17] really change to a new person
[41:20] most people at this time what they do is
[41:22] they turn over a new leaf
[41:25] but eventually that leaf turns back
[41:28] again
[41:31] many times we try to better our lives
[41:34] but they don't ever quite end up being
[41:37] exactly what we desire them to be
[41:40] so i believe what we need is a spiritual
[41:43] vision
[41:44] a spiritual vision not a vision of
[41:47] somebody else in the church
[41:49] or what's going to happen in the world
[41:51] next
[41:52] but we need a spiritual vision
[41:55] for our lives what we are to become
[41:58] now without a vision the bible tells us
[42:00] that people will perish
[42:03] people around us will perish our
[42:04] families will perish i'll say it like
[42:07] this including ourselves we can perish
[42:09] without that vision so we all must have
[42:11] a vision
[42:13] amen we need a vision for our lives a
[42:16] vision for the new you
[42:19] and you must hold that vision in front
[42:21] of you don't let anything distract you
[42:24] from becoming the new you
[42:27] so for a subject today we want to take
[42:29] distracting
[42:31] from god's leadership
[42:33] it almost sounds like two different
[42:34] subjects
[42:36] but to me
[42:38] the distractions
[42:40] is what
[42:41] satan is putting in front of us so we
[42:43] don't become new
[42:46] brother brennan said the image of the
[42:48] beast is now being formed
[42:50] the bible says that the sons of god are
[42:52] now being manifested
[42:55] so we're there's there's a manifestation
[42:58] coming we just want to make sure
[43:00] we're fitting into what god wants us to
[43:02] be
[43:05] now in our opening scripture we read
[43:07] about a new heaven a new earth a new
[43:09] jerusalem
[43:13] heaven is going to be new earth's going
[43:14] to be new i believe we're going to be
[43:16] new
[43:18] jesus said i make all things new
[43:23] when god
[43:24] originally made everything
[43:26] he made it perfect and it was beautiful
[43:29] the bible says it was good
[43:32] but everything became perverted because
[43:34] of sin right just like satan he was
[43:37] created perfect and beautiful
[43:40] but then he became perverted
[43:42] he wasn't content right he wanted vain
[43:45] glory
[43:47] it was a real simple thing
[43:50] we we look at at trying to get attention
[43:53] and glory and look at me is not a big
[43:55] deal but i'm telling you that was the
[43:56] big deal that's caused the downfall
[43:59] because god is not going to share his
[44:01] glory with anybody
[44:03] so with his power
[44:05] he perverted the thinking of the angels
[44:08] his power his power wasn't like a magic
[44:11] wand type of a power
[44:14] but it was the ability to convince
[44:17] we all have that power
[44:19] to be an influence one way or the other
[44:22] for good or for evil
[44:24] can either influence our kids
[44:26] we're going to be doing some services on
[44:28] parenting
[44:29] one way or the other way
[44:32] so then after he he he perverted the
[44:35] thinking of the angels he did the same
[44:37] thing with eve
[44:38] he perverted her thinking
[44:40] and through ease fall every
[44:43] man woman is born now with the same
[44:45] self-centered nature that lucifer had
[44:49] in other words it's about me it's about
[44:51] what i want now in life
[44:54] it's no longer god's will that's why
[44:56] when we're born we don't we're not born
[44:58] and grown up and just you know wanting
[45:00] to do god's will and and share all of
[45:02] our toys and and go late on our lives
[45:05] for our brothers and sisters no there's
[45:06] there's fighting and arguing and i want
[45:09] my way because that's the very nature
[45:12] brother branham has has told us that
[45:15] satan has caused
[45:18] sorrow and pain and hurt and sickness
[45:20] and and all the tears and death in every
[45:22] hospital insane
[45:24] asylum that there ever was
[45:26] it all happened to eat
[45:30] the bible does say that satan has
[45:33] weakened
[45:34] the nations
[45:37] look at how our nation is becoming so
[45:41] weakened
[45:43] even other countries look at our our
[45:46] country and and look at it as so weak
[45:51] satan was behind this and is behind us
[45:55] and he's trying to weaken the church
[45:58] everything has become so godless
[46:01] so sinful perversion is everywhere it's
[46:04] a lawlessness in the land
[46:06] and it tries to creep in the church
[46:10] god has to destroy everything
[46:15] that's not of him there's no reconciling
[46:19] there's no fixing there's no restoring
[46:22] of this world
[46:24] the bible says as it was in the days of
[46:26] noah and we know that there is nothing
[46:28] but evil continually on the heart of men
[46:32] and so shall it be in the coming of the
[46:34] son of man
[46:35] so god is going to have to destroy
[46:37] everything with fire then he destroyed
[46:39] it with water now he's going to destroy
[46:41] it with
[46:42] with fire he's going to make all things
[46:45] new amen
[46:46] now we're at the end and god is on a
[46:48] mission
[46:49] to make all things new that's the
[46:51] mission that he's on
[46:53] the bible says the wolf and the lamb
[46:55] shall feed together and the lion shall
[46:57] eat straw like a bullock and the dust
[46:59] shall be the serpent's meat they shall
[47:01] not hurt nor destroy in all my holy
[47:04] mountains saith the lord isaiah 65 17
[47:08] says for behold
[47:09] i create new heavens and a new earth and
[47:12] the former shall not be remembered nor
[47:14] come into the mind
[47:16] let's say it like this our future is
[47:19] more important than our past
[47:24] but what do we think about all the time
[47:27] our past our past our past
[47:31] we need to be thinking about our future
[47:34] there are certain things that god just
[47:36] wants us to forget all together
[47:39] isaiah 43 verse 18 says remember ye not
[47:42] the former things neither consider the
[47:44] things of old behold i would do a new
[47:47] thing now it shall spring forth shall
[47:49] you not know it of course we're going to
[47:50] know it because it's happening in us
[47:54] and i will make a way in the wilderness
[47:57] and the rivers in the desert
[47:59] jesus said i make all things new his
[48:03] word is not going to return void it's
[48:05] going to accomplish what it said so we
[48:08] are going to become new
[48:11] now despite this world's terrible
[48:13] condition
[48:14] god is ultimately in control do you
[48:16] believe that
[48:18] but did you know there's one thing that
[48:19] god is not in control of
[48:23] that's right
[48:24] it's our will
[48:27] it's that free more agency that he's
[48:29] placed
[48:30] and and
[48:32] what's scary about this is that some
[48:33] believers think that god is leading
[48:35] their life so much that it doesn't
[48:36] matter what they do where they go god is
[48:39] still in control of them
[48:42] it's almost as if the the devil can't
[48:45] pull one over them
[48:51] you know god can't lead our life
[48:55] and it does say the footsteps of the
[48:57] righteous are ordered the lord
[48:59] but i can tell you
[49:01] i don't act righteous all the time
[49:05] so why am i going to say that god's
[49:07] still going to lead me when i'm not
[49:09] in the spirit
[49:13] and where do you draw the line
[49:14] we're never always in the spirit
[49:20] but that doesn't mean god's still not
[49:22] leading us
[49:24] for what one minute five minutes five
[49:26] days five weeks five years
[49:29] you understand
[49:33] we just don't want to think it doesn't
[49:34] matter what we do god's still leading us
[49:39] now
[49:40] i'm not saying god hasn't told us what
[49:42] to do i'm just saying
[49:44] we may not be listening to it because
[49:46] we're too much doing what we want to do
[49:50] i think satan has more of a vision and a
[49:53] purpose than what he's trying to
[49:54] accomplish than a lot of believers
[49:59] he comes to church with a purpose
[50:02] to get us to question to doubt
[50:06] sometimes we come to church because it's
[50:08] church
[50:09] how many had this thought today be
[50:11] honest with me
[50:12] i hope they cancel church
[50:15] now that that i hope they cancel church
[50:18] now that wouldn't be our heart
[50:20] but that would be our flesh
[50:26] and so
[50:27] our flesh wants to do things
[50:31] and we just feel because it seems good
[50:33] seems right that god is in it but that's
[50:35] not necessarily true
[50:38] too many believers are walking around
[50:40] without a vision or purpose for their
[50:42] lives
[50:44] like there's no target there's no goal
[50:46] there's no mark they're not pressing
[50:48] towards one certain thing
[50:51] we as believers are supposed to be
[50:54] spiritually awake amen
[50:56] walking discreetly circumspectly
[50:59] peter said in uh chapter 5 verse 8 be
[51:02] sober
[51:03] be vigilant
[51:05] because your
[51:07] enemy your adversary the devil as a
[51:09] royal lion he walketh about seeking whom
[51:12] he may devour
[51:16] so we just can't take it easy
[51:19] whom
[51:20] when we meet him we resist steadfast in
[51:24] the faith knowing that the same
[51:25] afflictions are accomplished in your
[51:27] brethren that are in the world we're all
[51:29] going through this
[51:32] in the midst of this chaos world that
[51:34] we're living in
[51:35] everything that's happening around us
[51:37] god is on a mission to make everything
[51:41] new amen
[51:43] and his purpose for our life is to make
[51:45] a completely new
[51:47] creature out of us
[51:49] a completely new nature change a
[51:51] completely new image
[51:54] now we're not there yet
[51:58] i'm not saying it hasn't started of
[51:59] course it started that's why we're here
[52:03] but it hasn't completely happened yet
[52:06] right now the devil's purpose is is real
[52:08] simple it's to stop you from getting
[52:10] there
[52:13] and that's where all the distractions
[52:14] come from
[52:17] satan wants you to feel
[52:19] good enough all the time don't worry
[52:22] just relax
[52:25] it's all under control
[52:29] the devil wants to distract us from the
[52:31] thing that god is trying to bring us to
[52:34] that's why we need a vision amen that's
[52:36] why we got to hold that vision in front
[52:38] of us
[52:40] it's true that god will not lose one
[52:42] predestinated seed
[52:44] they're in the palm of his hand
[52:46] but too many believers are gamblers
[52:50] just like the children of israel
[52:55] they gambled with god that they didn't
[52:57] have to go all the way
[53:01] they were hey god's leading me look at
[53:03] my shoes everything is they don't wear
[53:06] out
[53:06] i
[53:08] we've got healing we got when we get
[53:10] sick we've got healing
[53:12] god is with us led by the pillar of fire
[53:14] every day
[53:16] but they still didn't think they had to
[53:19] go all the way with god into that nature
[53:22] change that's what the promised land is
[53:23] for us it's a complete nature change it
[53:26] isn't just saying i've got justification
[53:29] i've just got this part of the holy
[53:30] ghost
[53:31] it's all of it
[53:33] it's a land that is it's you basically
[53:35] you kick out every enemy out of your
[53:37] life
[53:38] every bad habit every bad nature change
[53:40] and it is completely of god
[53:44] too many believers are gamblers
[53:49] oh i'm pre-destined don't gamble
[53:52] if you are live like it press towards it
[53:54] press towards a mark
[53:56] become what the bible says you're to
[53:58] become
[54:01] god wants to make a new you
[54:04] and satan wants you just the way you are
[54:07] don't go
[54:08] anymore paul understood this i'll say it
[54:11] satan's strategy
[54:13] and that's why he pressed towards the
[54:15] mark paul always put something in front
[54:17] of him that god was dealing with him to
[54:19] press towards
[54:21] he was always pressing towards a higher
[54:25] christ in his life
[54:30] jesus faced a great warfare with satan
[54:33] we know this
[54:34] satan tried to stop the grand purpose of
[54:36] god when he said to jesus if you just
[54:39] bow down i'll give you whatever you want
[54:41] i'll give you all the kingdoms of the
[54:42] world whatever you could ask for i'll
[54:44] give it to you
[54:45] and he owned it
[54:49] that's why nobody is born
[54:52] with a beautiful nature
[54:54] when we look at the babies that are born
[54:57] they are beautiful looking
[54:59] but we're not looking at their nature
[55:03] but as they get older you begin to look
[55:06] at their nature
[55:08] and you see that
[55:10] it's not going to be like that in heaven
[55:13] look at the demons they cried out have
[55:15] you not have you come to torment us
[55:17] before our time
[55:20] even the demons knew
[55:23] there was a time coming for them
[55:27] there's a time for all things
[55:30] it's a time for us that we're going to
[55:31] be changed
[55:34] now think about it here are the demons
[55:36] since eve have been tormenting mankind
[55:39] from the beginning
[55:42] and they have this question for jesus
[55:44] have you come to torment us before a
[55:45] time
[55:48] like
[55:49] hey they're going to be
[55:50] being tormented so much more than
[55:52] they've tormented mankind i don't know
[55:54] how long hell's going to be but it's
[55:56] going to be a terrible torment for
[55:58] millions and millions and millions of
[56:00] years before they're annihilated
[56:08] praise god that we're saved
[56:11] now jesus told his disciples that he was
[56:14] going to have to suffer well that
[56:16] bothered them because that meant they
[56:18] were going to have to suffer
[56:20] so what did satan do
[56:22] he did what he does best he distracted
[56:26] the disciples at that moment from what
[56:28] jesus said
[56:30] he said well this is going to be a lot
[56:32] it would be painful there would be hurt
[56:34] this is going to be a bad situation
[56:36] he distracted them
[56:39] from god's purpose
[56:41] and what did jesus say in matthew 16
[56:44] verse 23 but jesus turned and said unto
[56:46] the peter
[56:47] get thee
[56:49] behind me satan
[56:52] thou art an offense for me for thou
[56:54] savers not the things that be of god but
[56:55] the things that be of men it was just a
[56:57] distraction from god's leadership now
[57:00] this is so important that
[57:03] god's leadership isn't just we come here
[57:06] once a week
[57:07] and we hear the word of god and now
[57:09] we've got god's leadership
[57:11] no god is trying to tell us here what we
[57:13] need to be putting into practice the
[57:15] other six days of the week
[57:23] and you can't just oh you know what that
[57:25] sounds just too painful i don't want to
[57:27] do that
[57:29] don't let satan distract you
[57:32] you've got to be willing to say get
[57:33] behind me satan
[57:35] you're distracting me from the program
[57:38] of god he wants to make a new meow
[57:40] a new me out of me
[57:44] amen god is still leading us to become
[57:47] the new you
[57:49] and satan is still distracting us from
[57:51] god's leadership to become that new you
[57:55] how is god leading us
[57:57] to become completely new
[58:01] by his word
[58:02] there's nothing else but his word
[58:07] he gives us the word
[58:10] in the hall of satan distracting us from
[58:11] growing in it
[58:13] by everything else that's happening in
[58:15] our life
[58:18] everything else that's happening in
[58:20] their life is how satan is distracting
[58:22] us from the word from becoming the new
[58:24] you
[58:25] it isn't just certain things
[58:28] like or major problems
[58:31] no everything else and i want that to
[58:34] sink in because we need to learn to
[58:37] recognize the devil in our lives
[58:40] it's easy for me to recognize the devil
[58:44] in bob
[58:46] because
[58:46] bob did this to
[58:48] me but can i recognize the devil in my
[58:51] life
[58:52] who's trying to get me to point a finger
[58:54] at bob
[58:57] because see satan is accuser of the
[58:59] brethren bob's my brother
[59:04] are you with me
[59:08] i've said this before and i'll say it
[59:10] again the true bride of christ is
[59:12] focused on two things
[59:14] one is finding the seed of god that
[59:17] hasn't come in yet
[59:19] and the other is getting ready for a
[59:21] body change a rapture
[59:24] they're they're looking on to the author
[59:29] and the finisher of their faith see it's
[59:32] not just he saved me
[59:34] but what he's going to finish on doing
[59:35] in my life
[59:37] now how is she getting ready by
[59:39] continuously changing her nature into
[59:42] the nature of jesus christ
[59:44] it isn't i i've been baptized it's all
[59:47] set in stone now
[59:51] no that baptism was just saying i've
[59:54] started going in this direction
[59:57] we still got to keep moving into that
[1:00:00] nature change
[1:00:02] we're not ready by sitting still
[1:00:05] we're ready by always crucifying the old
[1:00:07] man and pressing in
[1:00:09] to all things become the character of
[1:00:11] jesus christ amen
[1:00:13] i believe a lot of people are expecting
[1:00:14] a body change because the message
[1:00:18] promises it
[1:00:20] has opened our eyes to it
[1:00:23] but you know what how can there be
[1:00:25] a body change
[1:00:27] until there's first a nature change
[1:00:30] god is not going to make a new body for
[1:00:32] an old nature
[1:00:34] not going to do it
[1:00:37] we can't do nothing about this body no
[1:00:40] man can
[1:00:42] but the nature can be changed
[1:00:45] it's been proven throughout history
[1:00:48] that's what we got control over
[1:00:52] we're faithful to that god will do
[1:00:55] a body change
[1:00:57] the bride
[1:00:58] is taking the word from the five-fold
[1:01:00] ministry and she's manifesting it
[1:01:04] she's being perfected through what his
[1:01:06] ministry his word
[1:01:09] the word is becoming more and more what
[1:01:12] real
[1:01:14] tangible
[1:01:15] it's not just
[1:01:17] do's and don'ts
[1:01:19] it you see it fit
[1:01:21] into your heart
[1:01:22] into your life more you're applying it
[1:01:24] to the things in your home
[1:01:27] hallelujah the things in your family
[1:01:30] your thoughts
[1:01:32] it becomes more real to us
[1:01:35] and it's changing our nature more into
[1:01:38] the image of jesus christ we're getting
[1:01:40] character ready for heaven amen
[1:01:44] that's what we're doing that's where
[1:01:45] we're at we're in that process we should
[1:01:46] be able to see uh such a major change
[1:01:49] from this year
[1:01:50] right now to what it was last year
[1:01:53] it should be happening
[1:01:56] she's not just manifesting justification
[1:01:59] sanctification or even the
[1:02:02] uh pentecostal powers
[1:02:04] of the holy ghost
[1:02:06] but she's manifesting the full character
[1:02:10] the full nature of christ
[1:02:12] she's
[1:02:13] and it is being seen
[1:02:15] in how she handles
[1:02:17] her life
[1:02:21] and she's feeling it
[1:02:22] with a greater burden for souls now i'm
[1:02:24] just referring to the manifestation of
[1:02:28] her becoming the word
[1:02:31] most churches
[1:02:32] and most believers they're under the
[1:02:35] spirit
[1:02:36] of laodicea
[1:02:40] but they don't know it
[1:02:43] not only they don't know it
[1:02:44] they're not need of anything
[1:02:49] you know what they're working in harmony
[1:02:50] with satan
[1:02:53] they're so distracted from becoming in
[1:02:56] god's image that no matter what they
[1:02:58] talk about they think that's all there
[1:03:00] is
[1:03:01] that's the main thing because it's the
[1:03:03] main thing of their mind
[1:03:06] but the true bride of christ is under
[1:03:08] the anointing of the holy ghost and
[1:03:09] she's working in harmony with god
[1:03:14] because god wants to make her new
[1:03:19] not a new seed
[1:03:22] but a new manifestation of the sea
[1:03:23] that's in there
[1:03:26] and those who are working
[1:03:29] in this harmony with god
[1:03:30] those who are where they need to be in
[1:03:33] christ
[1:03:34] they are in love with god they're
[1:03:35] walking in the spirit they're submitted
[1:03:37] to his will and they're growing to the
[1:03:39] statue of a perfect man
[1:03:41] and the bible says they've been called
[1:03:43] to a greater purpose
[1:03:45] to his purpose
[1:03:47] right
[1:03:48] they're hunting for the predestinated
[1:03:50] seed
[1:03:52] that's why she can say that everything
[1:03:54] that happens to her is working out for
[1:03:57] the good
[1:04:00] because she's in harmony with god's plan
[1:04:06] god can't come and destroy the world
[1:04:09] until he gets out the seed
[1:04:14] and that's where the believer puts feels
[1:04:17] that responsibility from christ
[1:04:20] something inside of i can't sit still i
[1:04:23] can't be lukewarm i can't just you know
[1:04:25] go to church and try to be a better
[1:04:27] christian there's something inside of
[1:04:29] her that
[1:04:31] gets her off the seat
[1:04:34] and starts you know even if you don't
[1:04:37] reach somebody that day if you're trying
[1:04:39] something inside of you just knows you
[1:04:41] did the will of god
[1:04:44] on a regular basis
[1:04:47] i want to ask you a question what do you
[1:04:49] use the holy ghost for
[1:04:54] what is what is your expectation of the
[1:04:56] holy ghost in your life
[1:04:59] what do you want him to do for you
[1:05:02] i believe most believers
[1:05:04] expect him to comfort them
[1:05:11] where yet my situation
[1:05:14] to supply
[1:05:16] all their needs
[1:05:19] to help them with all their problems
[1:05:22] to lead them in whatever they're doing
[1:05:25] to help them with their plans
[1:05:28] that's what they use the holy ghost for
[1:05:30] that's what they talk about the holy
[1:05:32] ghost for
[1:05:33] you listen to conversations that's what
[1:05:35] they are
[1:05:36] but i ask this question
[1:05:38] or these questions
[1:05:40] is this the purpose
[1:05:42] in what god sent the holy ghost for
[1:05:45] is this why god
[1:05:47] gave man the gift of the holy ghost
[1:05:50] is this the reason god sent back the
[1:05:52] holy ghost to the church
[1:05:57] my brother branham did say we can make
[1:06:01] god like an errand boy
[1:06:05] and he's good god he will
[1:06:09] he'll do he'll do whatever you want him
[1:06:10] to do
[1:06:12] you believe
[1:06:14] oftentimes he's good to the good to the
[1:06:17] to the un good to the evil to the unjust
[1:06:20] and to the just god is god but that is
[1:06:23] not his purpose
[1:06:25] just like brother branham said
[1:06:28] healing is just the bait
[1:06:31] we need healing we want healing who won
[1:06:33] it right but it's just debate for a
[1:06:36] greater purpose
[1:06:37] because eventually we're going to die
[1:06:40] there's nobody that was
[1:06:43] you know back in the 1800s that that god
[1:06:46] healed you know five times six times and
[1:06:48] they're still living today eventually
[1:06:50] you die
[1:06:52] so it's just debate it gets it shows the
[1:06:54] power of god but what we're looking for
[1:06:56] is a nature change
[1:06:59] i got a bunch of quotes is it okay if if
[1:07:01] uh
[1:07:02] brother brandon ministers this morning
[1:07:08] thank you
[1:07:12] all these quotes are taken from the
[1:07:14] message what was the holy ghost given
[1:07:16] for
[1:07:18] god's purpose we find here in sending
[1:07:20] the holy ghost was
[1:07:22] one purpose
[1:07:24] that god himself might dwell in his
[1:07:26] church
[1:07:27] and continue his plans
[1:07:30] through the church
[1:07:31] wow
[1:07:34] on purpose
[1:07:35] that's why
[1:07:37] no other flesh
[1:07:39] is allowed
[1:07:42] to lead this church
[1:07:45] in any fashion former way you brothers
[1:07:48] that lead worship it's got to be god the
[1:07:51] ministers every special everything
[1:07:54] that's done it needs to be god in the
[1:07:56] church
[1:07:58] because god wants to carry out his plans
[1:08:00] to his church
[1:08:03] now that's a it's a quite a bit
[1:08:04] different concept than what we think the
[1:08:06] holy ghost is for in our lives
[1:08:11] the man says god the holy spirit is sent
[1:08:13] for the purpose of god living in his
[1:08:15] church
[1:08:16] moving through each age working out his
[1:08:19] divine will
[1:08:22] not using him for our will
[1:08:26] understand the difference i want to do
[1:08:27] this god i want you to help me with this
[1:08:32] and just as sure as you're hungering
[1:08:35] tonight for the holy spirit
[1:08:36] it's something in you poem you that a
[1:08:39] purpose of god in your life has got to
[1:08:42] be fulfilled
[1:08:44] see that's just god inside of you
[1:08:48] he's working in us to fulfill his
[1:08:50] purpose
[1:08:53] i like how brother branham simplifies it
[1:08:55] because
[1:08:56] you know we make god everything else
[1:09:01] brother man said that's the purpose of
[1:09:02] the holy ghost it's the father again
[1:09:05] god the father dwelling in you working
[1:09:08] out his plan to finish his plan of
[1:09:11] redemption
[1:09:12] now look at how many times he says
[1:09:14] working through you working through you
[1:09:16] making you a co-worker with him giving
[1:09:18] you a place giving you a part for your
[1:09:21] fallen lost brother and sister giving
[1:09:24] you his spirit and his love to go hunt
[1:09:28] the loss as he did in the garden of eden
[1:09:30] adam adam where art thou
[1:09:32] in other words that same spirit is in
[1:09:34] the bride
[1:09:36] still crying where's the adam where's
[1:09:39] adam
[1:09:42] that's what the holy spirit does to a
[1:09:45] man or woman
[1:09:47] when it strikes into their heart and it
[1:09:50] takes a bold
[1:09:52] there's a thirst and a hunger for lost
[1:09:55] souls
[1:10:00] in all honesty do you have this plan
[1:10:03] inside of you
[1:10:07] we know it's true we know it's the will
[1:10:09] of god
[1:10:10] but do you feel that burning
[1:10:14] because you can't you know to go the
[1:10:16] rest of our life and say i got the holy
[1:10:17] ghost but never feeling the bernie
[1:10:20] what are you doing
[1:10:22] what are you doing you're rewriting
[1:10:26] the word you're rewriting the message
[1:10:30] he said that's what's the matter with
[1:10:32] the meetings today there's not enough
[1:10:34] spirit touching it to go for souls of
[1:10:37] the lost and the dying it's more to make
[1:10:39] a name
[1:10:42] look at me
[1:10:47] or to make a church or building or
[1:10:49] denomination instead of a soul-winning
[1:10:53] program
[1:10:54] how pitiful
[1:10:56] he said we could say much on that
[1:11:00] i've got a lot of scriptures and we may
[1:11:03] not make it this morning through them
[1:11:04] all but i want us to remember one thing
[1:11:07] the new you god is going to make a new
[1:11:10] you
[1:11:11] and that's why we're we're reading so
[1:11:13] much of this because we we don't want to
[1:11:16] just use god for our natural lives
[1:11:19] i'm okay with it
[1:11:20] i'm not saying don't do it what i am
[1:11:22] saying is do what he purposed it for
[1:11:25] or else we're going to miss it
[1:11:27] jesus says you can gain the whole world
[1:11:30] what would it do for us at the end
[1:11:33] we're looking for our nature to change
[1:11:35] that's a real thing character changes
[1:11:37] today
[1:11:39] there's where our testimony should be
[1:11:41] it's on character change
[1:11:44] brother brandon said the same holy
[1:11:46] spirit that saved the lutherans that
[1:11:49] saved the methodists that baptized the
[1:11:51] pentecostals is now setting in order the
[1:11:56] coming of the lord
[1:12:00] wow
[1:12:01] that saved the lutherans
[1:12:03] that
[1:12:05] baptized no that sanctified the mess and
[1:12:07] baptized the pentacles is now setting in
[1:12:10] order the coming of the lord jesus
[1:12:14] so we're looking at here's the purpose
[1:12:16] god is setting us in order for the
[1:12:18] rapture it's no longer i heard a message
[1:12:20] i'm going in the rapture praise god i'm
[1:12:22] in the message
[1:12:26] much deeper
[1:12:27] he said when it'll be so powerful that
[1:12:29] the body will come to this group a
[1:12:31] church that will draw the rest of them
[1:12:34] from the grave
[1:12:35] they'll be resurrected that's what the
[1:12:38] holy ghost is for without us they cannot
[1:12:40] be made perfect
[1:12:41] kind of sounds here that brother brown
[1:12:43] says we'll call them out
[1:12:48] you talk about having to have the word
[1:12:51] he said for the rest of the dead
[1:12:53] live not for the space of a thousand
[1:12:54] years
[1:12:55] that's right just holy spirit filled
[1:12:58] people was all that went into the
[1:13:01] rapture
[1:13:05] not holy spirit anointed
[1:13:08] not holy spirit used
[1:13:11] not holy spirit blessed
[1:13:14] but filled
[1:13:16] we got to keep going i mean every
[1:13:18] morning i pray god fill me with the holy
[1:13:20] ghost
[1:13:21] i know how evil i am
[1:13:24] even i just agree with jesus jesus says
[1:13:26] you evil you you know
[1:13:28] you that are evil know how to give good
[1:13:30] gifts to your children how much more
[1:13:31] shall the heavenly father give you the
[1:13:33] holy ghost of them that i just
[1:13:35] keep asking amen i want more
[1:13:38] brother john are you saying you don't
[1:13:39] got it
[1:13:41] are you saying you don't got enough i am
[1:13:42] declaring i don't got enough amen
[1:13:45] let the whole world know
[1:13:47] i never want to come across in any way
[1:13:50] to anybody that i'm something when i
[1:13:52] know i'm nothing amen amen
[1:13:57] i'd rather have to say we i well i'd
[1:13:59] rather have somebody say well you don't
[1:14:00] belong up there no problem i'll go sit
[1:14:02] down i honestly
[1:14:04] but something inside of me is not going
[1:14:06] to stop me from helping people
[1:14:08] [Music]
[1:14:10] that thing didn't that thing didn't come
[1:14:12] of of man
[1:14:16] or else we'd all be doing it before we
[1:14:18] even came to the lord right
[1:14:21] he said all my dear friends from around
[1:14:23] this country
[1:14:24] and this little city
[1:14:26] if i could only with my human voice
[1:14:30] place in your heart the importance of
[1:14:32] receiving the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:14:35] it would be the most wonderful
[1:14:37] revelation
[1:14:38] that you ever had in your life
[1:14:41] he said you must do it
[1:14:44] i want
[1:14:46] more revelation
[1:14:47] of the holy ghost in my life
[1:14:51] he said you're not sealed by believing
[1:14:53] on two
[1:14:55] in other words i believe i'm going to
[1:14:56] the rapture
[1:14:57] i believe in i i i'm going all the way
[1:15:01] no
[1:15:03] you're not sealed by believing on two
[1:15:05] but sealed by the holy ghost
[1:15:08] that seals you
[1:15:10] when you're found favor with god
[1:15:14] and he sealed you by the holy spirit
[1:15:20] god is good to everybody
[1:15:22] but that doesn't mean
[1:15:24] you've
[1:15:26] you found favor that everybody's fallen
[1:15:28] favor with god
[1:15:29] or else he would seal everybody
[1:15:32] god is good everybody but it doesn't
[1:15:33] mean we found favor with god
[1:15:36] how we know we found favor with god is
[1:15:38] when we get sealed and you just you're
[1:15:40] not even control of your life anymore
[1:15:42] that's true
[1:15:43] right it's the holy ghost inside you
[1:15:48] the only way that you can say that jesus
[1:15:50] is the christ brother adam says is when
[1:15:51] the holy ghost comes into you
[1:15:54] and bears record
[1:15:56] and witness itself out
[1:16:00] he is the son of god that's the only way
[1:16:02] that you know the resurrection is when
[1:16:03] the holy ghost bears record
[1:16:06] so we might as well just forget
[1:16:07] ever trying to say
[1:16:12] we're
[1:16:13] we're so we got so much holy ghost
[1:16:16] or we're so right
[1:16:18] or
[1:16:19] uh look what god did
[1:16:21] for me here
[1:16:23] no we need the holy ghost just bearing
[1:16:25] witness
[1:16:26] with our life
[1:16:29] now you know
[1:16:30] i don't have any problem i can put my
[1:16:33] hand here and smile at you
[1:16:35] but if you hit me with a hammer step on
[1:16:38] me kick me in the face it's going to be
[1:16:40] a little bit harder for me to to stay
[1:16:43] here and say i love you right
[1:16:46] right so we bear witness in her trials
[1:16:51] that's where you bear witness
[1:16:54] is when you're going through the hard
[1:16:55] times it shows who's in control
[1:17:00] brother branham said if you abide in me
[1:17:03] this is real important saints
[1:17:06] great revelation in this
[1:17:08] if you abide in me and my words abide in
[1:17:10] you ask what you will
[1:17:13] he says because you're asking his word
[1:17:17] his word is life speak it if god said it
[1:17:20] and you're sure of it
[1:17:22] you're sure he said it the holy ghost
[1:17:24] bears record that the word is right then
[1:17:27] then there you are brother speak it
[1:17:29] there it is
[1:17:31] say to this mountain be moved
[1:17:33] don't doubt in your heart but believe
[1:17:35] what you have said and it will come to
[1:17:37] pass brother branham claps his hands
[1:17:39] three times
[1:17:43] but listen
[1:17:44] he said not you that speaketh
[1:17:48] but the father that dwelleth in you
[1:17:51] he's doing the talking
[1:17:56] i'm not talking to the mountain
[1:17:58] it's the father that's in you he's
[1:18:00] speaking to the mountain it has to move
[1:18:03] all heavens and earth will pass away he
[1:18:05] said but my spirit shall not pass away
[1:18:07] my word shall not pass away certainly it
[1:18:09] cannot pass away father brother branham
[1:18:12] said it like this talking about speaking
[1:18:14] the squirrels into existence he said i
[1:18:16] didn't do that
[1:18:17] right
[1:18:20] it wasn't like you know what you know
[1:18:21] what i'm going to speak some squirrels
[1:18:22] in existence
[1:18:24] it wasn't like that
[1:18:26] god told him to do that god told adam to
[1:18:29] do what he did
[1:18:34] it isn't us becoming some some creature
[1:18:37] that has power to create things
[1:18:42] we're many creators and the first thing
[1:18:43] we should be creating is an atmosphere
[1:18:45] of a nature change
[1:18:47] that's the thing we got control over
[1:18:50] create an atmosphere in the church where
[1:18:51] he's welcome to come and live in your
[1:18:53] hearts
[1:18:56] there's a lot of believers who know the
[1:18:58] scriptures but honestly can't rightly
[1:19:00] divide them
[1:19:09] brother brandon says not you that
[1:19:10] speaketh but the father that dwelleth in
[1:19:12] you he doeth the talking
[1:19:15] this has got to become more real to us
[1:19:18] how can i be sure that god's talking
[1:19:22] brother brandon said preaching
[1:19:24] isn't just the gospel
[1:19:26] right it's all from this message now
[1:19:29] he said making the word of god manifest
[1:19:32] is the gospel
[1:19:35] so you really can't do that in here
[1:19:38] outside of just how you worship and how
[1:19:41] you receive the word
[1:19:43] but you really go manifest it out there
[1:19:45] that's where the real gospel is being
[1:19:47] preached it's in your home
[1:19:49] it's how you handle your situations
[1:19:52] it's how you respond
[1:19:54] brother branson says it's not the action
[1:19:55] but the reaction that counts amen
[1:20:00] now he says making the word of god
[1:20:02] manifest is the god's voice says now you
[1:20:04] can't do it
[1:20:05] i just love that he says you can't do
[1:20:07] that now jesus known that
[1:20:10] that he had to live in his church
[1:20:13] in other words we can't manifest the
[1:20:15] gospel
[1:20:16] ourselves it takes the holy ghost inside
[1:20:19] of us
[1:20:20] the purpose of sending the holy ghost
[1:20:22] was for god to continue through a bunch
[1:20:24] of people to continually manifest god to
[1:20:27] the world
[1:20:29] that's exactly by making his word
[1:20:32] real
[1:20:34] not by speaking the word
[1:20:36] not by saying this is what the bible
[1:20:38] says
[1:20:39] but living that all sudden it's it's
[1:20:42] manifested
[1:20:44] by making it real
[1:20:48] just quoting the word doesn't make it
[1:20:50] real
[1:20:53] by me saying
[1:20:54] love your enemy
[1:20:56] you need to love your enemy i need to
[1:20:58] love my enemy it's not the gospel the
[1:21:00] gospel is when i actually go love my
[1:21:02] enemy
[1:21:04] when it's real that's when it's real by
[1:21:06] this you all men know you're my
[1:21:07] disciples
[1:21:09] when they see that in action
[1:21:12] now we're talking about a new you
[1:21:15] don't let the devil distract you from
[1:21:18] god's purpose
[1:21:20] make the word of god real in your life
[1:21:23] take it personally
[1:21:25] brother says the holy ghost come to give
[1:21:27] you power
[1:21:28] some of you people walking along saying
[1:21:31] well
[1:21:33] i just can't
[1:21:34] quit drinking
[1:21:36] i just can't quit this
[1:21:39] the holy ghost comes to live in you
[1:21:43] to make all these cants
[1:21:46] get away from you
[1:21:47] that's right
[1:21:49] it's to quit making you smoke and drink
[1:21:52] and want to be a big shot
[1:21:54] it'll take that rate out of you
[1:21:57] it'll humber you when you do that
[1:22:00] that's what the holy ghost is for it's
[1:22:02] for a holy life that's right it'll make
[1:22:05] you quit gossiping
[1:22:08] you say i can't do it oh i just can't do
[1:22:13] it
[1:22:14] the man said sure you can't
[1:22:16] but the holy ghost come for that purpose
[1:22:21] that's what it did it come to take it
[1:22:22] out of you and all them old habits and
[1:22:25] things that you're doing
[1:22:26] he says there's no excuses
[1:22:30] that's what it come to do that's the
[1:22:33] purpose of god send the holy ghost so
[1:22:35] you would do these things and that you
[1:22:37] would work and walk after him
[1:22:42] i don't want to hurt you but i told you
[1:22:45] i'm here
[1:22:46] with the deepest sincerity
[1:22:49] the holy ghost will follow god's word to
[1:22:51] the letter
[1:22:53] and a preacher behind the pulpit that
[1:22:55] ain't got grace enough to preach all the
[1:22:58] word
[1:22:59] he says i doubt he's got it
[1:23:04] i doubt he's got it so in other words
[1:23:08] there's preachers up there preaching
[1:23:10] part of the word
[1:23:11] brother branham doubts that they've got
[1:23:13] the holy ghost
[1:23:15] he said that's just exactly
[1:23:18] well
[1:23:19] that's what the purpose of the holy
[1:23:20] ghost is for
[1:23:21] it's to give unction to the preacher
[1:23:25] it's to give
[1:23:27] holiness to the group
[1:23:30] it's to set the church in order
[1:23:34] oh we're going to be going through
[1:23:35] church order now i love this it's to
[1:23:38] bring unity of the spirit
[1:23:42] it's to unite us together with power
[1:23:44] it's to unite us together with love
[1:23:46] brotherly love that's what the holy
[1:23:48] ghost is going to do in the church
[1:23:52] now so any preaching that doesn't
[1:23:55] culminate to those things
[1:23:59] i can't say it's the holy spirit doing
[1:24:02] it
[1:24:05] the holy ghost wants to make completely
[1:24:08] new creatures out of us
[1:24:09] he wants to make a complete new you
[1:24:12] and the unholy ghost he wants to
[1:24:15] distract us from that change it's that
[1:24:17] simple
[1:24:19] the the if you think about it we don't
[1:24:22] spend enough time thinking about our
[1:24:24] nature being changed more
[1:24:26] in fact when we get thoughts about our
[1:24:28] our certain habits or certain things
[1:24:30] that we call it out on
[1:24:32] we kind of like brush it off and go on
[1:24:35] to something different
[1:24:38] when god is trying to get a hold of our
[1:24:40] attention
[1:24:41] all the time and saying listen let's get
[1:24:44] serious about this
[1:24:46] all we got to do is pray believe wait on
[1:24:48] the lord he'll give you strength but we
[1:24:50] got to get to a place where we hold that
[1:24:52] vision in front of us we believe that
[1:24:54] we're going to become better than what
[1:24:55] we were last year we're not going to
[1:24:57] just turn over a new leaf try a little
[1:24:59] bit harder no we're going to get more
[1:25:01] serious with god
[1:25:06] so i ask
[1:25:07] the question
[1:25:09] where are you
[1:25:12] are you focused on completing your
[1:25:14] nature change
[1:25:16] going all the way
[1:25:19] or are you being easily distracted from
[1:25:21] it
[1:25:22] like you just you you can't wait for
[1:25:24] this you can't wait for that but they're
[1:25:25] all natural things
[1:25:27] how about this excitement of i can't
[1:25:29] wait
[1:25:29] to be more like jesus
[1:25:33] where would we be without god's prophet
[1:25:36] he's a seer
[1:25:38] he set things in order he helped us to
[1:25:41] see how the church should be
[1:25:44] i believe the holy ghost is here to
[1:25:45] comfort us with all of our hurts and
[1:25:47] pains and our problems or trials or
[1:25:49] difficult situations but brother branham
[1:25:52] said we can make him just an errand boy
[1:25:55] for our personal lives
[1:25:57] and it's so much more than that
[1:26:00] most of our desire for god's leadership
[1:26:02] is for the things that we want for our
[1:26:04] natural lives
[1:26:06] and not the things that he wants for our
[1:26:09] spiritual life see our characters our
[1:26:11] spiritual life
[1:26:16] amen let's take a look at the scriptures
[1:26:18] saint john chapter 16 verse 7. are you
[1:26:20] getting a little something out of this
[1:26:22] and it's okay if if you if you don't
[1:26:27] express it more i'm just saying i'm not
[1:26:29] going to you know say you're out or
[1:26:31] anything like that
[1:26:33] saint john chapter 16 verse 7
[1:26:35] nevertheless i tell you
[1:26:37] the truth it's expedient for you that i
[1:26:41] go away jesus speak in your jewish
[1:26:42] disciples for if i don't go away the
[1:26:44] comforter will not come unto you but if
[1:26:47] i depart i will send him on to you
[1:26:50] and when he has come he will reprove the
[1:26:54] world
[1:26:56] the world that's in you
[1:27:00] he will reprove the world that's in you
[1:27:04] of sin
[1:27:05] of righteousness and of judgment
[1:27:08] because the comforter is never going to
[1:27:10] come into you
[1:27:12] and start
[1:27:14] reproving
[1:27:15] the world
[1:27:20] it's not going to go blow up every
[1:27:21] abortional clinic clinic
[1:27:25] it's not going to blow up everybody that
[1:27:27] you disagree with
[1:27:30] it's it's not going to call out how
[1:27:33] rotten
[1:27:34] politics and our government is
[1:27:37] and and what's happening all over the
[1:27:38] world it's not going to reprove that
[1:27:41] that's not its purpose jesus already
[1:27:43] made it clear i am not of the world
[1:27:46] my subjects are not of the world
[1:27:48] so when he sends the holy ghost to you
[1:27:52] he's going to reprove the world part
[1:27:54] that's in you
[1:27:56] that we were all born with
[1:27:58] and it didn't get changed
[1:28:00] the day i got baptized
[1:28:03] i still wanted to hang on to my records
[1:28:08] i didn't think there's anything wrong
[1:28:10] with my long hair and
[1:28:11] on and on and on so there was a lot of
[1:28:14] world in there
[1:28:17] he was reproving
[1:28:19] and there's still a lot in my nature
[1:28:23] that he's reproving
[1:28:25] and i'm so glad he didn't give up didn't
[1:28:27] stop with me
[1:28:32] okay verse 9 of sin
[1:28:35] because they believe not on me
[1:28:38] notice he uses the word they
[1:28:42] you just i want you to think this it's
[1:28:44] so easy to see this when you when you
[1:28:46] think about the children of israel
[1:28:48] coming out of the world they're going
[1:28:49] into the promised land and they're
[1:28:50] facing these giants
[1:28:53] they're just they look like grasshoppers
[1:28:55] in their own eyes in their eyes they
[1:28:57] look you know we're just grasshoppers
[1:28:59] they're big giants
[1:29:01] they don't believe in jehovah
[1:29:04] that's what jesus is saying here they
[1:29:06] don't believe of sin because they
[1:29:08] believe not on me
[1:29:11] all those devils that anoint us with i
[1:29:13] can't
[1:29:15] excuses about moving forward with god
[1:29:18] the comforter comes in and he rebukes
[1:29:20] those demons of doubt amen and he says i
[1:29:24] can do all things through christ that
[1:29:26] strengtheneth me
[1:29:27] i can obtain the divine nature change i
[1:29:30] can be in this image
[1:29:34] that's what the holy ghost does
[1:29:36] how does it happen there's something in
[1:29:39] you that believes
[1:29:41] i believe that greater is he that's in
[1:29:44] me than he that's in the world
[1:29:47] it starts with a belief because they
[1:29:49] don't believe you can't go out there and
[1:29:51] say would you please leave me i just
[1:29:53] don't like this thing in my life
[1:29:56] no you were born with that
[1:29:59] you need to kick him out
[1:30:02] well i can't do it no but the holy ghost
[1:30:03] can you believe in god he'll do it
[1:30:07] verse 10 of righteousness because i go
[1:30:09] to my father
[1:30:11] and you see me no more
[1:30:13] well every demon in hell is distracting
[1:30:17] the church from manifesting all of god's
[1:30:19] divine nature god sends the holy ghost
[1:30:22] inside of a man
[1:30:24] and lives out his word through him
[1:30:28] see we can't
[1:30:29] if we can muster up any righteousness
[1:30:32] any righteousness in our life
[1:30:35] we call it self or the bible calls it
[1:30:37] self righteousness
[1:30:39] it's not the righteousness of god
[1:30:42] the righteousness of god is produced by
[1:30:44] god
[1:30:45] in you
[1:30:48] and that's what the holy ghost does it
[1:30:50] comes in you to produce a righteous life
[1:30:55] amen
[1:31:01] and god's righteousness is seen
[1:31:04] not now when you're sitting on that seat
[1:31:07] it's seeing how you handle
[1:31:09] treat others when you walk out the door
[1:31:12] that's exactly right
[1:31:15] of judgment
[1:31:17] verse 11 of judgment because the prince
[1:31:20] of this world
[1:31:21] is judged
[1:31:23] i say the comforter doesn't have any
[1:31:25] problem coming inside of you and judging
[1:31:27] what's wrong
[1:31:31] i i know we don't like to hurt people's
[1:31:32] feelings right
[1:31:34] a lot of times we don't want to go deal
[1:31:36] with somebody
[1:31:38] because we're afraid
[1:31:40] of what's going to happen to us
[1:31:42] what they're going to say what they're
[1:31:44] going to think but the holy ghost does
[1:31:46] not have a problem coming and dealing
[1:31:48] with their heart
[1:31:49] judging what's not shouldn't be there
[1:31:52] now we're all going to stand before the
[1:31:54] judgment seat of christ
[1:31:57] every soul
[1:31:59] we the bride
[1:32:01] welcome the judgment happening right now
[1:32:03] he comes and he sits on the throne of
[1:32:04] our and he judges our heart
[1:32:07] we welcome that
[1:32:10] all the others don't want that
[1:32:13] so they get judged at the end
[1:32:16] but the reward for letting god come now
[1:32:18] is we got a rapture
[1:32:20] we get to sit and rule and reign with
[1:32:22] them a thousand years it isn't for
[1:32:24] everybody it's for those who are serious
[1:32:27] about it
[1:32:29] brother branham said in the message what
[1:32:31] was the holy ghost given for he says now
[1:32:33] if you say that you got it and are
[1:32:35] guilty of these things
[1:32:36] he said i wonder
[1:32:38] what's leading you
[1:32:43] god will never lead you off the word
[1:32:48] he'll keep you with the word
[1:32:50] because that's god's own laws
[1:32:53] of his church
[1:32:54] for his people for women and men
[1:32:59] well
[1:33:00] say
[1:33:01] you say
[1:33:02] it don't hire me to do a little this
[1:33:04] or that
[1:33:06] but the man says it doesn't
[1:33:08] the word says it does
[1:33:10] and if the holy spirit is in you it'll
[1:33:13] lead you right to the word
[1:33:16] so when somebody comes to you and says
[1:33:18] brother sister child you shouldn't do
[1:33:22] this
[1:33:24] or you should be doing that
[1:33:26] don't be quick to judge them that could
[1:33:28] be the holy ghost speaking to you
[1:33:32] come on
[1:33:35] well you know what i don't need anybody
[1:33:37] to tell me i could hear from god myself
[1:33:39] you know what
[1:33:40] sometimes you can be so angry you
[1:33:42] couldn't hear anything
[1:33:45] sometimes you could be so lost in in in
[1:33:47] your own desires and going after your
[1:33:49] own will so much you couldn't hear
[1:33:50] anything
[1:33:52] we can be so caught up in the flesh that
[1:33:54] we miss god
[1:33:59] but the holy spirit when it's speaking
[1:34:01] to you
[1:34:04] it'll lead you right to the word
[1:34:06] notice it'll lead and guide you into all
[1:34:09] truth
[1:34:11] there's no excuses
[1:34:12] god don't make alterations or excuses
[1:34:16] he makes the mark and you told to it he
[1:34:19] said that's right that's what it is it's
[1:34:21] with everyone you come the same way
[1:34:24] when the holy spirit comes it gives you
[1:34:27] power over the world
[1:34:29] now i'll tell you this is the thing that
[1:34:31] shows me i need more holy ghost amen
[1:34:35] see i can sit here and i can think to
[1:34:37] myself i can sit in church and say you
[1:34:40] know what
[1:34:42] i think i got more holy spirit than this
[1:34:44] person that's person and that person
[1:34:48] which i don't even know how anybody
[1:34:50] could ever think that but there are a
[1:34:52] lot that think those thoughts
[1:34:57] but when i measure up
[1:34:59] to how i'm handling my trials do i have
[1:35:02] power to overcome
[1:35:04] the things
[1:35:06] that i'm doing wrong
[1:35:08] or the power just to re stop the
[1:35:11] resistance
[1:35:12] of temptations
[1:35:15] i mean
[1:35:16] the the proof is in the pudding but see
[1:35:19] in order to really really achieve this
[1:35:21] for our lives we have to be humble and
[1:35:23] sincere
[1:35:25] not not we got to get away from the
[1:35:27] pull-up the show the front the the
[1:35:30] making the image of what you want people
[1:35:32] to think about you
[1:35:34] you just got to be the real you if if
[1:35:37] you expect god to make a new new you got
[1:35:39] to be the real you
[1:35:42] remember the pharisees they just they
[1:35:44] they weren't honest
[1:35:48] you know they but my dad used to say you
[1:35:50] could feel some of the people some of
[1:35:51] the time but you can't through all the
[1:35:52] people all the time and the pharisees
[1:35:54] they just thought they could fool
[1:35:56] everybody even god look look satan
[1:35:58] himself got the other angels
[1:36:03] to think they could live eternally
[1:36:06] without god
[1:36:08] come i'll let you live eternally you can
[1:36:10] do your own thing with me
[1:36:13] i'll let you do what you want i won't be
[1:36:14] like this
[1:36:15] this tyrant
[1:36:18] we gotta do everything his will
[1:36:20] the devil is very persuasive this is the
[1:36:22] distractions
[1:36:26] brother or jesus said here in verse 12.
[1:36:28] i have yet many things to say unto you
[1:36:29] but you cannot bear them now god has a
[1:36:32] whole lot of things to deal with about
[1:36:34] our
[1:36:35] uh about our nature about our character
[1:36:38] but you know what we can't deal with it
[1:36:40] unless we have the comforting anointing
[1:36:43] the anesthetic of the holy ghost to say
[1:36:45] yes lord i agree take this from me
[1:36:52] because we just we you know change i'm
[1:36:54] going to be like this when we're talking
[1:36:55] about a nature change it hurts
[1:36:58] it doesn't hurt it doesn't hurt
[1:37:02] god it doesn't hurt the holy spirit
[1:37:04] but it hurts our flesh
[1:37:06] because our flesh has been so long with
[1:37:09] it
[1:37:10] right
[1:37:11] nobody likes separation
[1:37:15] that's why it hurts
[1:37:17] but understanding that hurt is okay
[1:37:21] it's got to get cut off we got to
[1:37:22] circumcise our heart amen amen verse 13
[1:37:25] how be it when he the spirit of truth
[1:37:26] has come
[1:37:27] he will guide you in all truth for he
[1:37:29] shall not speak of himself
[1:37:31] but whatsoever he shall hear that shall
[1:37:33] he speak and he shall show you things to
[1:37:35] come
[1:37:36] the spirit of truth is not going to lead
[1:37:39] you to build your reputation
[1:37:42] he's not going to speak of himself
[1:37:45] in fact if he's going to do anything
[1:37:47] he's going to make himself of no
[1:37:48] reputation
[1:37:50] zippo
[1:37:51] take you out of the picture he will make
[1:37:53] you
[1:37:54] as a servant
[1:37:56] like jesus he took on the form of a
[1:37:57] servant we will become a servant just
[1:37:59] like jesus did
[1:38:01] and when the holy spirit is come
[1:38:04] he will be known as the spirit of truth
[1:38:08] right because this is just this is how
[1:38:10] jesus said he starts out by saying
[1:38:11] comforter when he comes and then he says
[1:38:14] in verse 13 the spirit of truth he will
[1:38:16] guide you into all truth
[1:38:20] now for years years and years i used to
[1:38:23] think that he was just going to give me
[1:38:25] the right doctrine the right church to
[1:38:27] be in
[1:38:28] the right understanding of the word
[1:38:32] but
[1:38:33] first of all
[1:38:35] who is you
[1:38:37] who is you
[1:38:39] we're a triune being
[1:38:42] our body spirit and we're soul but who
[1:38:44] are you
[1:38:49] which part
[1:38:51] is you
[1:38:53] brother branham did say
[1:38:55] that you
[1:38:57] you're you are your soul
[1:39:00] you are a soul that's who you are that's
[1:39:02] the part of you the real you that's why
[1:39:04] we drop these bodies we get a new body
[1:39:10] now he's leading the soul
[1:39:13] into all truth
[1:39:15] not your body
[1:39:17] not your spirit
[1:39:20] alone
[1:39:21] they're hooked together he's leading
[1:39:23] your soul
[1:39:24] into all truth brother man said in the
[1:39:26] message you must be born again a soul
[1:39:28] good or bad death doesn't change it he
[1:39:30] says i got a lot of scriptures wrote
[1:39:32] down here on this one and i want to
[1:39:34] comment on what a soul is what is the
[1:39:36] soul it's you you are a soul the part
[1:39:38] inside of you and when you die
[1:39:42] whatever shape your soul is in that's
[1:39:44] the way it goes it goes to its
[1:39:46] destination you couldn't pull it up no
[1:39:48] uh no matter how much you wanted to
[1:39:51] that soul's got to be changed here
[1:39:54] and born again the soul has to be
[1:39:56] changed here
[1:40:03] change
[1:40:05] you know
[1:40:06] when you change the furniture in your
[1:40:08] house
[1:40:09] you know when you change the color of
[1:40:11] your house you know when you
[1:40:13] you change
[1:40:15] your landscaping
[1:40:17] it's different
[1:40:20] and it takes work to do it
[1:40:23] you know
[1:40:24] when your soul changes
[1:40:28] when you're becoming constantly more
[1:40:31] into the image of god your soul is
[1:40:33] changing that's why it's so important to
[1:40:36] let the word have the effect in the soul
[1:40:40] and not just letting the flesh be
[1:40:41] satisfied with hearing it
[1:40:44] i heard the word i came to church i did
[1:40:46] my part now i'm going to spend the rest
[1:40:48] they do what i want
[1:40:52] the comforter is leading our soul into
[1:40:55] all truth
[1:40:58] now what is our soul
[1:41:02] brother ram said it's the nature
[1:41:04] of our spirit
[1:41:07] the comforter is leading our soul
[1:41:10] into all the nature of god
[1:41:15] that's what this whole thing's about
[1:41:17] this is what we come to church for every
[1:41:18] day
[1:41:19] or when we come to church this is why we
[1:41:21] read this is why we pray because his
[1:41:24] spirit
[1:41:25] the holy spirit is not just leading me
[1:41:30] what car to buy
[1:41:34] but how to get god's nature
[1:41:38] that's what's happening
[1:41:41] i hope you can see it brother braham
[1:41:43] said
[1:41:44] in the questions and answers what is
[1:41:46] what difference is there between the
[1:41:47] body soul and the spirit he says your
[1:41:50] soul is the motive
[1:41:52] of that spirit
[1:41:54] or the nature of that spirit
[1:41:57] god is trying to lead us to change our
[1:42:01] motives
[1:42:06] because that that's why brother we heard
[1:42:07] brother brandon say check your mouse
[1:42:08] check your motors check your objectives
[1:42:10] be sure
[1:42:12] and then when you're sure be sure
[1:42:14] because the devil's slick we the bible
[1:42:15] says
[1:42:16] the heart is deceptive deceptive above
[1:42:18] all things who can know it
[1:42:20] we think we know our hearts
[1:42:23] the devil can sneak in there and try to
[1:42:24] get a little bit something for himself
[1:42:26] too you know
[1:42:28] god is constantly trying to lead us
[1:42:32] to change our motives to change the
[1:42:34] nature of our spirit
[1:42:37] and to me that's the part that he's
[1:42:40] leading us into all
[1:42:42] living life living the word living the
[1:42:45] life of god that's what he's coming to
[1:42:47] do it really doesn't matter to me how
[1:42:50] many times he shows me what's going to
[1:42:52] happen at trusted to two days before it
[1:42:54] happens it just doesn't matter
[1:42:59] that doesn't help my nature
[1:43:01] doesn't help my character
[1:43:03] why can be more prepared for it so
[1:43:07] how many times have you known somebody
[1:43:09] was going to blow up
[1:43:13] but you couldn't stop it anyways
[1:43:16] you understand i'm saying
[1:43:18] the knowledge
[1:43:19] of those things don't mean anything
[1:43:22] what means everything to god is god is
[1:43:25] really trying to get us to deal with our
[1:43:27] character
[1:43:30] to to to change
[1:43:34] to use the word grow as comfortable but
[1:43:36] to change
[1:43:38] our nature
[1:43:41] now
[1:43:44] as god led the children of israel out of
[1:43:46] egypt
[1:43:47] he's led us
[1:43:49] out of the denominations
[1:43:51] he's led us in the message of the hour
[1:43:55] what is left
[1:43:57] what is left
[1:43:59] to lead us into manifestation of the
[1:44:00] word
[1:44:03] that
[1:44:04] we can't be satisfied being in the
[1:44:05] message
[1:44:07] we should just be i've got to change
[1:44:09] i've got to change i've got to see the
[1:44:11] change in me i've got to get more
[1:44:12] serious about it
[1:44:14] this is this is why
[1:44:16] this new year's message it needs to be
[1:44:19] projected out through the year
[1:44:22] this theme as we go forward
[1:44:26] is a new you
[1:44:29] i don't care how much weight you lose
[1:44:31] i don't care how much exercising you do
[1:44:33] right
[1:44:35] i i don't care if you
[1:44:38] if you
[1:44:40] become a vegetarian
[1:44:43] drink juice the rest of your life it
[1:44:44] doesn't matter what matters is that
[1:44:46] nature change the focus on the nature
[1:44:49] change
[1:44:51] can you bear with me
[1:44:53] are you sure
[1:44:55] okay
[1:44:57] it's going to be a little bit
[1:45:00] but you should you're okay with it still
[1:45:02] you don't know
[1:45:04] if if you
[1:45:05] you need to go i i completely understand
[1:45:07] not going to feel the least bit bad
[1:45:13] the bride will have the nature of christ
[1:45:16] in their despicable bodies
[1:45:19] think about that
[1:45:21] before the change happens
[1:45:24] of course the devil knows this
[1:45:26] so what's he trying to do he's trying to
[1:45:28] distract you from allowing that change
[1:45:31] to happen
[1:45:33] so i don't i don't care
[1:45:35] he uses two things to distract you here
[1:45:38] i say it's everything else in life
[1:45:41] but it can be your desires for what you
[1:45:43] want to do and it can be all the
[1:45:45] problems that you're going through in
[1:45:46] life
[1:45:47] and god knows all the problems we're
[1:45:49] going to go through
[1:45:50] the
[1:45:51] the rest of this year
[1:45:54] we're going to go through a lot
[1:45:56] but those are just to get your mind off
[1:45:58] of the nature change
[1:46:00] off of becoming more like him
[1:46:04] now we know
[1:46:05] we know of that jesus came to our home
[1:46:07] corporal body
[1:46:09] we sat down we gave him a plate at the
[1:46:10] table we gave him the best room in the
[1:46:12] house
[1:46:14] we sat in the living room and we talked
[1:46:16] with him
[1:46:16] got to ask him all the questions what do
[1:46:18] we do about this we would feel so
[1:46:21] comforted
[1:46:25] but without him
[1:46:27] being there
[1:46:29] well we're just going to get distracted
[1:46:30] by everything else that's on tv
[1:46:36] big distractions
[1:46:38] every problem in life i got this plan
[1:46:41] and they got that plan they're all
[1:46:42] distractions to take us away from the
[1:46:44] nature change we got to bring it home we
[1:46:47] got to
[1:46:48] lord increase this desire just like
[1:46:49] praying for a desire for souls
[1:46:53] well you need a desire for the nature
[1:46:54] change it's no different how how many
[1:46:57] times have you gone to church and not
[1:46:59] felt you've heard from the pulpit you
[1:47:01] know we need to have a burden for souls
[1:47:03] yeah i know we do but it just doesn't
[1:47:05] seem to be there
[1:47:06] we got to pray for it
[1:47:08] you got to invite it in it's the same
[1:47:10] way about a nature change
[1:47:13] we need to have a desire for a nature
[1:47:15] change
[1:47:19] satan will use all types of distractions
[1:47:24] who use things like god is
[1:47:26] leading me to buy this car
[1:47:30] this boat
[1:47:32] this gun
[1:47:34] this land
[1:47:35] this house
[1:47:37] this
[1:47:38] put fill in the blank they're all
[1:47:40] natural things
[1:47:41] but how often do we hear people say god
[1:47:44] is leading me to stop gossiping
[1:47:48] i cannot remember ever hearing anybody
[1:47:51] say to me god is leading me
[1:47:53] the holy ghost inside of me it's leading
[1:47:55] me to stop gossiping
[1:47:57] no
[1:48:00] but it's everything else
[1:48:03] how about god is leading me to stop
[1:48:05] being so negative
[1:48:10] god is leading me to be more faithful
[1:48:13] god is leading me to lay down my life
[1:48:15] for others i mean how often do you hear
[1:48:18] somebody say god is leading me in this
[1:48:20] direction because that is
[1:48:23] that is what the purpose of the holy
[1:48:25] ghost for is to gain control of the
[1:48:27] church to come in and do the greater
[1:48:29] works
[1:48:31] the prophet said
[1:48:33] i'm not saying that god isn't natural
[1:48:35] things
[1:48:37] the comforter will help us in natural
[1:48:39] things
[1:48:41] but you seek first the kingdom
[1:48:44] right then all other things are added
[1:48:46] but what's more important and you need
[1:48:48] to be spiritual about this you need to
[1:48:50] be thinking about spiritual things and
[1:48:51] the spiritual thing is not what god
[1:48:54] shows you
[1:48:56] about somebody else
[1:48:59] you know i don't understand this but for
[1:49:02] some reason
[1:49:04] people are always saying
[1:49:07] god shows them things about other people
[1:49:10] all the time and i don't get it because
[1:49:15] to me the bible says that god the holy
[1:49:17] ghost will lead you your soul
[1:49:21] we need to hear more about that
[1:49:23] amen
[1:49:25] i think satan gets in there through the
[1:49:28] accusing of the brethren
[1:49:30] and begins to say things
[1:49:34] we've got to understand that's that is
[1:49:36] not god
[1:49:38] god wants to lead me
[1:49:43] to become more in his image and the only
[1:49:44] way i i'm that's going to happen is i
[1:49:46] got to go through self-crucifixion i got
[1:49:48] to pick up my cross daily i got to die
[1:49:51] to my will and do his will that's the
[1:49:53] only way
[1:49:55] but that's more important than if god
[1:49:57] showed you everything gave you all faith
[1:49:59] to remove mountains and knew all
[1:50:00] mysteries and
[1:50:02] and and anything like that
[1:50:06] but to be in his image
[1:50:08] that's brother man said that's the only
[1:50:10] thing
[1:50:10] we're coming that he's coming back for
[1:50:15] so many things i've got to let go
[1:50:19] now
[1:50:21] brother branham said
[1:50:22] that there's a lot of distractions in
[1:50:24] the church
[1:50:27] in the church
[1:50:32] distractions in the church
[1:50:35] i don't know how many times
[1:50:37] i've come to church
[1:50:38] and there's so much talking before the
[1:50:40] service
[1:50:43] and all seems to be important to them
[1:50:46] but it's a distraction
[1:50:49] brother branham refers
[1:50:51] to ministering the gospel and this woman
[1:50:54] wanting to get ready fix her dress her
[1:50:56] hair and she's going to get ready to
[1:50:58] speak in tongues like like uh
[1:51:01] you know like a cowboy movie they're
[1:51:02] going out in the street and they're
[1:51:03] getting ready to draw
[1:51:05] so she gets out there and she's getting
[1:51:07] ready to speak and talk speak in tongues
[1:51:09] use her gift
[1:51:11] but it was a distraction
[1:51:14] it was a distraction from what god was
[1:51:16] doing
[1:51:18] brother branham also made mention about
[1:51:19] men when they're asked to pray in the
[1:51:21] church
[1:51:22] that they pray for everything under the
[1:51:25] sun
[1:51:27] the president
[1:51:29] and just everything
[1:51:31] that's a distraction
[1:51:36] he made mention of song leaders spending
[1:51:38] too much time talking and not enough
[1:51:40] time worshiping
[1:51:42] a distraction
[1:51:45] or children who are not kept in order
[1:51:48] in the sanctuary
[1:51:52] and then he goes on to say even after
[1:51:55] service
[1:51:59] these are all
[1:52:00] distractions distractions
[1:52:06] so it's not just in our personal lives
[1:52:08] out there
[1:52:10] you know i know we come here and
[1:52:12] sometimes we feel like there's rules and
[1:52:13] regulations
[1:52:16] as if we go home and there's none
[1:52:20] just let your children do something that
[1:52:21] you don't want to do and we'll find out
[1:52:23] how many rules and regulations you got
[1:52:24] there
[1:52:27] they're all distractions
[1:52:30] brother branham said like this that
[1:52:32] alley easier couldn't get rebecca
[1:52:35] to sit still long enough to get her
[1:52:37] dressed
[1:52:38] now god is trying to get his church in
[1:52:40] order for a rapture
[1:52:42] but he can't get her to sit still long
[1:52:44] enough to listen to what the word is
[1:52:47] saying
[1:52:52] we can't keep leaving church
[1:52:55] feeling good enough
[1:52:58] we've got to leave church i've got to
[1:53:01] put on more of christ
[1:53:04] come on now i
[1:53:07] i understand that i'm not a
[1:53:10] people's favorite preacher i understand
[1:53:13] that
[1:53:18] but personally i don't want to meet you
[1:53:20] on the other side
[1:53:23] and not be guilty of trying with
[1:53:25] everything that i have to get you to see
[1:53:26] what's the most important thing
[1:53:32] i think
[1:53:34] the holy ghost is the greatest thing
[1:53:35] that can make you happy
[1:53:37] because it is it's lasting it's up to us
[1:53:41] now
[1:53:42] how bad we want to hunger and thirst for
[1:53:44] this
[1:53:47] last scripture second peter chapter 3
[1:53:49] verse 17.
[1:53:59] before i
[1:54:00] read the opening scripture
[1:54:04] i don't want to be a preacher that keeps
[1:54:06] saying last scripture
[1:54:09] second peter chapter 3 verse 17 ye
[1:54:11] therefore beloved
[1:54:13] seeing you know
[1:54:15] these things before
[1:54:19] beware lest he also being led away
[1:54:23] with the heir of the wicked
[1:54:25] fall from your own steadfastness
[1:54:28] but grow in grace
[1:54:30] and in the knowledge of the lord jesus
[1:54:32] christ to him be glory both now and
[1:54:35] forever amen don't let the devil
[1:54:38] distract you
[1:54:40] don't get distracted continue to grow
[1:54:43] your nature
[1:54:45] you grow not knowledge
[1:54:47] up here
[1:54:48] but knowledge in here

[1:54:54] all the things
[1:54:56] that you face
[1:54:58] that knowledge
[1:55:00] jesus the bible says and god shall wipe
[1:55:02] away our opening scripture
[1:55:05] wipe away all tears from their eyes
[1:55:07] and there shall be no more death neither
[1:55:09] sorrow nor crying neither shall there be
[1:55:11] any more pain for the former things are
[1:55:13] passed by i think the bible says in
[1:55:15] romans chapter 8 that the sufferings of
[1:55:17] this present time are worthy to be
[1:55:18] compared with the glory that shall be
[1:55:20] revealed in us the sufferings yes it's
[1:55:24] it's it's hard to put away the flesh
[1:55:28] but we're the only guy who can do it
[1:55:31] we're the only one through three more
[1:55:32] agency that denies our will ourself
[1:55:36] but that pain that you go through is not
[1:55:38] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:55:40] that's going to be revealed
[1:55:42] and he that sat upon the throne said
[1:55:44] behold i make all things new
[1:55:49] and he said unto me right for these are
[1:55:51] true and faithful these words are true
[1:55:53] and faithful let's stand together

[1:55:57] life
[1:55:59] keep focused on the new you this year

[1:56:38] a word of prayer
[1:56:40] our gracious heavenly father
[1:56:46] we're grateful that you called us out of
[1:56:48] a world of sin
[1:56:50] we didn't
[1:56:52] know about you
[1:56:54] we had thoughts
[1:56:56] and imaginations
[1:56:59] but we didn't know you
[1:57:02] and your word declares that we can't
[1:57:04] even know you without
[1:57:07] you being inside of us
[1:57:12] to
[1:57:13] to really experience you and to know you
[1:57:17] you called us to being born again
[1:57:20] we thank you
[1:57:22] that inside of each and every one of us
[1:57:24] here
[1:57:26] that that
[1:57:27] new birth has begun
[1:57:30] and it's continually
[1:57:33] growing and taking place in our lives
[1:57:38] lord we're all so
[1:57:39] thankful that you you didn't just lead
[1:57:42] us into some denominational church
[1:57:46] and let us just get wrapped up behind
[1:57:49] that church
[1:57:51] to the point of saying that if this is
[1:57:54] the only church and if you don't belong
[1:57:55] in this if you're not a part of this and
[1:57:57] you're not part of god
[1:58:00] but lord
[1:58:01] when you brought us out
[1:58:04] you wanted to take us all away with you
[1:58:08] you didn't want us to stay outside the
[1:58:10] promised land
[1:58:12] he didn't want us to be satisfied with
[1:58:14] just our needs being met naturally
[1:58:19] and being led by your spirit
[1:58:21] from day to day
[1:58:24] but lord you had a vision for us
[1:58:27] a vision to take us all the way
[1:58:32] to take us in to something
[1:58:36] that no other age has experienced
[1:58:39] the full manifestation of the word
[1:58:43] and god
[1:58:45] a lot of times our visions get dimmed
[1:58:47] and
[1:58:49] we get blurred and
[1:58:51] things of this world
[1:58:54] creep in and
[1:58:56] get us off track
[1:58:58] and i pray god that
[1:59:02] that you would increase that
[1:59:04] that vision for our lives
[1:59:06] of what you're calling us to become
[1:59:09] that we would not perish lord that we
[1:59:11] would
[1:59:12] hold that vision that we could be as
[1:59:14] paul and press towards it every day
[1:59:18] and lord that the fruit of that would
[1:59:20] come that when we come to church we'd be
[1:59:23] more on fire
[1:59:25] more in love with one another more love
[1:59:27] for unity
