[33:30] well praise the Lord so good to see each
[33:32] and every one of you this morning in the
[33:34] house of the Lord we've been praying for
[33:36] each of you
[33:37] I trust you've been praying for one
[33:40] another
[33:41] amen and for this time to be gathered
[33:44] together if you'd like to turn with me
[33:46] to the book of Psalm 61 for opening
[33:49] scripture
[33:51] it's good to see brother and sister
[33:52] Johnson back
[33:54] amen amen
[34:02] this morning we want to talk about
[34:03] remembering we're entitled this message
[34:05] remembering the Rock
[34:08] and for a subject God has a word that
[34:11] will Deliver Us from being overwhelmed
[34:14] amen I think it's something we all could
[34:16] relate to if if if we're not feeling
[34:19] that way today you need this message
[34:22] because you will in some time soon feel
[34:25] this way and I believe the Lord
[34:30] has something special for us this
[34:32] morning amen let's just look to him in a
[34:34] word of prayer and then we'll read the
[34:35] first four verses our heavenly father
[34:38] Lord we just want to thank you that you
[34:40] have given us strength and health
[34:43] and so much a desire to be here in your
[34:46] house today
[34:48] and father because of this Lord this
[34:52] Grace Lord we're here now to receive
[34:55] from you the things that we have need of
[34:58] and father we pray that your presence
[35:00] would not be uh in inhibited
[35:05] uh in any way that that you would be
[35:07] able to move freely in our midst
[35:10] Lord that there be no no no doubts no
[35:14] fears no unbelief but that you would
[35:16] bind up every evil spirit and cast it
[35:20] forth out of this place Lord that your
[35:22] people may be able to receive the things
[35:24] that they desire that they they want to
[35:27] believe for
[35:28] Lord that you would heal the sick that
[35:30] you would fill those that are thirsty
[35:32] for the Holy Ghost and Lord that you
[35:35] would bless us showers with your
[35:37] blessings and may your word come forth
[35:39] with Revelation Lord recommit the
[35:42] furtherance of this service in your
[35:43] hands as we wait now upon thee in Jesus
[35:46] Christ's name we ask it all amen amen
[35:51] Psalm 61 verse number one here My Cry o
[35:55] God attend unto my prayer from the end
[35:57] of the Earth will I Cry
[36:00] unto thee and when my heart is
[36:02] overwhelmed lead me to the rock that is
[36:06] higher than I
[36:07] for thou has been a shelter for me and a
[36:12] strong tower
[36:13] from the enemy
[36:15] I will abide in thy Tabernacle forever
[36:19] and I will trust in the covet of thy
[36:22] wings
[36:23] amen God bless you may be seated
[36:27] I will trust in the protection or the
[36:31] secret place
[36:32] of thy Wings there is a place
[36:36] that we can go
[36:38] amen
[36:40] well the book of Psalms expresses so
[36:43] many things that David went through in
[36:45] his life we've all been through it
[36:48] so many things so many songs of joy and
[36:52] delight and gladness hope confidence and
[36:56] peace we can find in here him expressing
[36:59] love and gratitude in his deep desire is
[37:01] for God and just a respect for God in
[37:04] the awesomeness of God
[37:07] and David is one that really expressed
[37:09] his heart but we also find out in the
[37:12] Book of Psalms that he expresses many
[37:13] hardships that he went through in his
[37:15] life
[37:16] and so we will see here he expresses con
[37:19] Contrition of broken Spirit sorrow pain
[37:23] Agony regret and even shame
[37:26] grief and broken heartedness
[37:29] discouragement and loneliness so we can
[37:31] find these things and more in the Book
[37:34] of Psalms
[37:35] but just like us David felt overwhelmed
[37:38] many times in his life
[37:40] and here he expresses his heart's crying
[37:42] his faith that that during these periods
[37:45] that God would just meet him he said
[37:48] from the ends of the Earth
[37:50] not just for one place but from the ends
[37:52] of the Earth why cry unto thee when my
[37:55] heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock
[37:58] that is higher than I
[38:01] so the answer to being overwhelmed was a
[38:04] rock that David did not possess
[38:09] David was here and The Rock was up here
[38:12] and if he knew he could just get to that
[38:14] rock he would be safe
[38:16] that he wouldn't be overwhelmed anymore
[38:19] and I do believe that there is a place
[38:21] for every single one of us
[38:23] to not be overwhelmed in our situations
[38:27] and I believe God wants to lead us there
[38:30] are certain animals that are known for
[38:33] their Iraqi climbing skills
[38:36] but one of them Reigns Supreme
[38:40] anybody know who that is
[38:42] or which one that is
[38:45] that's right the mountain goat he is the
[38:48] Undisputed master of terrifying Heights
[38:51] and seemingly impossible to scale Cliff
[38:54] faces mountain goats they have predators
[38:56] just like we do
[38:58] there's our Bears wolves and Wolverines
[39:01] and much of the mountain goats behavior
[39:04] is a strategy to avoid these animals
[39:06] they're always on the lookout so their
[39:09] defense is to climb higher on Steepy
[39:12] Rocky slopes at other animals can't
[39:14] navigate
[39:16] there's something that's inside that
[39:18] that leads them up higher
[39:20] and so their enemy doesn't necessarily
[39:23] vanish away from them but they're up so
[39:25] high
[39:26] that they can't be touched by their
[39:28] enemies Just Like an Eagle in this age
[39:31] flies above his all the problems that
[39:34] there are going on down here and I
[39:36] believe there's a place in Christ where
[39:38] our life is hid with Christ in God
[39:41] there's a secret place of the most high
[39:43] under the shadow of the almighty where
[39:46] the enemy cannot bother us
[39:50] as Psalms 23 says that he prepares a
[39:53] table before us right in the presence of
[39:56] our enemies God is not moved by Satan
[40:00] he is not moved by problem and and and
[40:03] we should never fear
[40:06] because God in us is greater than our
[40:09] problems amen
[40:12] now it didn't matter what location David
[40:14] found himself in he said from the end of
[40:17] the Earth will I cry unto thee David
[40:20] knew that there was always a rock that
[40:23] was higher than his situation than his
[40:25] present situation that he was in and he
[40:28] looked at that rock as a shelter and
[40:29] it's a strong tower from his enemy and
[40:33] so David's strategy now was to keep
[40:35] climbing higher than his enemy
[40:39] and he was asking God to lead him to
[40:43] that rock he was asking God to lead him
[40:45] to that place he said I will abide
[40:48] tonight to have an echo forever I will
[40:49] trust in the covet of thy wings
[40:52] believed we as people we as a church we
[40:56] as believers
[40:57] we're living in a day where there's more
[40:59] evil
[41:00] than ever before we're battling more
[41:03] Spirits than ever before
[41:05] and it's so easy to become overwhelmed
[41:07] with things nowadays
[41:08] there's all kinds of pressures that
[41:10] we're dealing with
[41:12] Financial pressures
[41:14] how are we going to keep up physical
[41:16] pressures how long can we cope with
[41:18] these physical ailments that we're
[41:20] having
[41:21] job pressures so many pressures on the
[41:24] job nowadays so many demands we've got
[41:28] marital pressures
[41:30] social pressures worried about our image
[41:33] or being accepted by others
[41:35] we take a look at our teens
[41:38] though they're such a spirit pressuring
[41:40] them to change their gender
[41:43] teens battling peer pressure having a
[41:47] desire to
[41:48] be to dress a certain way so they can be
[41:51] accepted
[41:52] I just read one in five youths
[41:55] meet the criteria for severe mental
[41:58] health disorders a fact
[42:02] well we ought to just thank God for
[42:03] sound Minds amen
[42:06] a pressure to succeed academically
[42:08] athletically
[42:11] scrambling for a sense of direction in
[42:13] their lives
[42:14] they got pressures with their parents
[42:17] just parental pressure
[42:19] everyone is facing stress fears
[42:22] anxieties
[42:23] isolation and depression
[42:25] digital distractions pressure to stay
[42:29] connected on social media
[42:31] confusion about what to do in your life
[42:33] no one's listening to you no one really
[42:35] cares sometimes we're left without a
[42:38] friend
[42:39] at times we're left alone feeling
[42:42] completely overwhelmed with no one to
[42:44] talk to no one understands can anybody
[42:47] relate to what I'm saying
[42:48] sometimes we're just buried under heavy
[42:51] burdens like a massive weight over
[42:54] ourselves
[42:56] or a Dan that's just ready to burst and
[42:59] sweep us away leaving us feeling
[43:01] abandoned
[43:03] have you ever felt overwhelmed in a
[43:06] situation
[43:07] the Bible says there's a rock that is
[43:09] higher than our current state amen I
[43:12] believe that there's a revelation for us
[43:14] that is higher than our circumstances a
[43:18] solid foundation that's higher than our
[43:19] our weariness or uh unstable situation
[43:23] that God has a faith that is higher than
[43:26] her fear a peace that is higher than our
[43:29] turmoil
[43:30] God has a rock for us we need to believe
[43:33] that to start with
[43:35] it's a rock where the Gates of Hell
[43:38] cannot Prevail against
[43:40] mother Brown and Son the message
[43:41] believeth thou this he says the devil
[43:43] might
[43:44] have bit you
[43:46] but there's enough drawing power in the
[43:48] Rock of Ages cleft for me
[43:51] let me hide myself in the Hallelujah the
[43:55] devil can't get you when you're hid in
[43:58] there
[44:00] so when we're feeling all these
[44:02] pressures around us
[44:04] we we need to realize that there is a
[44:07] place where we don't feel them
[44:11] now I'm not saying that the devil still
[44:13] isn't there taunting he just can't get
[44:16] to you it'd be like going to a zoo and
[44:18] this most dangerous animal that's caged
[44:21] up is just ferociously you know rowing
[44:25] at you but he can't get to you because
[44:27] there is a defense there and I believe
[44:30] there is a place in Christ where we
[44:32] don't fear amen we don't fear because
[44:36] we're we're so close to God because his
[44:39] presence is just so much around us that
[44:42] we don't fear
[44:43] because God don't fear
[44:46] there's a cleft in the rock for us
[44:49] there still is a rock and a weary land
[44:50] there's something to hang on to there's
[44:52] a Shelter From The Storm there's a
[44:54] refuge from the enemy there's still a
[44:57] place that we can stand still and know
[45:00] that he is God
[45:02] he has everything under control
[45:05] but life throws us curveballs all the
[45:08] time
[45:09] we get put in difficult situations
[45:12] sometimes overwhelming situations
[45:16] that it's that's when we need to
[45:18] literally humble ourselves
[45:22] and cry out to God
[45:24] because if we don't do that part and we
[45:26] don't say God lead me to that
[45:30] that rock that is higher than my
[45:32] situation it's just not going to be done
[45:34] God don't owe us anything
[45:37] he allowed the overwhelming situation to
[45:40] come for a reason
[45:44] he wants to build character
[45:47] he wants to see us grow in a trust for
[45:51] him
[45:53] David said when my heart is overwhelmed
[45:56] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[45:59] I
[46:00] in my office I have a little quote from
[46:02] Abraham Lincoln
[46:04] he says I have been driven
[46:08] many times upon my knees by the
[46:10] overwhelming conviction that I have
[46:13] nowhere else to go
[46:18] Peter said where else can we go thou
[46:20] alone has the words of eternal life
[46:23] when we when we have a revelation that
[46:25] God is the answer for our situation we
[46:28] won't spend so much time trying to work
[46:30] on it herself
[46:33] God loves us to loves to put us in
[46:36] situations that it forces us to turn to
[46:38] him
[46:39] did you ever want to get somebody's
[46:41] attention and they don't want to give
[46:42] you the time of day
[46:45] come on
[46:46] they don't want to answer the phone they
[46:48] they they they they you're trying to
[46:50] look them in the eye they will look at
[46:52] you
[46:53] you're just trying to get their
[46:55] attention because you want something but
[46:57] they're too busy for you
[46:59] sometimes we're just too busy for God
[47:02] and he has to throw things some
[47:04] curveballs in our life to get our
[47:05] attention
[47:08] he knows what he's doing
[47:12] if we get a little bit squeezed we'll
[47:14] just be more likely to cry out to him
[47:18] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[47:23] I
[47:24] David's cry wasn't
[47:27] for the
[47:29] enemy to be just
[47:33] uh gone so he didn't have to deal with
[47:36] things anymore
[47:37] but David's cry was for the Holy Ghost
[47:39] leadership to direct him to a rock that
[47:42] was above his situation
[47:45] and that leadership comes from the word
[47:47] of God
[47:48] that is the rock it is the word of God
[47:51] that's why it's so important when we
[47:52] come to church that we're really
[47:54] listening to God when he speaks to us
[47:57] personally because he has a word to help
[47:59] us with our situations he doesn't have
[48:02] to stand here and call out every single
[48:04] thing that's personally happening in
[48:06] your life to get you to believe you got
[48:08] to believe the word is it's coming forth
[48:10] over the pulpit
[48:14] there is a word for all of us to hold on
[48:16] to
[48:17] something that will help us not to feel
[48:20] overwhelmed about our situations
[48:23] something that gives us a word of peace
[48:26] or a word of direction for our lives
[48:28] that gives us comfort in our trials
[48:32] so when God speaks to us
[48:35] when you hear the voice of God
[48:37] you just feel like you're lifted up
[48:41] into Heavenly places
[48:44] and you're you're higher above your
[48:47] potential or your situation that you
[48:50] were in a lot of times when we're
[48:52] feeling overwhelmed we're always
[48:53] thinking about all the bad things that
[48:55] could happen
[48:57] right we're not thinking positively but
[49:01] you know when something just comes
[49:02] someone gives you a word of advice or
[49:05] that God's presence just comes or
[49:07] something happens to where it's the
[49:09] answer to the situation and all sudden
[49:11] that burden just kind of lifts off of
[49:13] you
[49:15] you're no more worried about it
[49:20] and God wants us to remember that
[49:22] there's a rock for us to go to
[49:26] he doesn't want us to be bothered down
[49:31] he wants us to know that even the Gates
[49:34] of Hell cannot Prevail against That Rock
[49:36] Amen Jesus said my sheep hear my voice
[49:39] and they follow me we must we must
[49:42] listen to the voice of God inside this
[49:45] voice I don't care who's preaching I
[49:48] don't care what word you're reading what
[49:49] type you're listening to if you're not
[49:51] focused Zoom Focus I'm talking about
[49:54] laser focused on God and from your heart
[49:57] trying to hear from God you're going to
[49:59] probably miss it
[50:04] I'm sorry that that may have not made
[50:08] you happy but I'm trying to provoke you
[50:11] to God's voice
[50:13] amen personally you've got to hear from
[50:15] him
[50:17] because when you hear from God
[50:19] personally
[50:20] that is your answer to not being
[50:24] overwhelmed anymore
[50:27] men can't help you we're going to have
[50:29] some examples of this
[50:32] coming up here
[50:33] lead me to the rock that is higher than
[50:36] I think we need to remember that there's
[50:37] a rock Christ Jesus for us that's higher
[50:40] than our situation and he's leading us
[50:43] there
[50:44] let's take a look at Jonah he was
[50:46] completely overwhelmed don't you think
[50:49] when a great fish swallowed up Jonah and
[50:52] Jonah was in the belly of the fish three
[50:53] days and three nights
[50:55] the Bible says that the the waters come
[50:57] past me about even to my soul the depth
[51:00] closed me round about and the weeds were
[51:01] wrapped around my head
[51:04] In Jonah 2 6 says I went down to the
[51:06] bottoms of the mountains the Earth with
[51:08] their bars was about me forever yet thou
[51:11] has brought me up my life from
[51:13] corruption oh Lord my God
[51:16] and when my soul fainted Within Me
[51:19] I remembered the Lord
[51:24] now you don't nobody's been in a
[51:26] situation like Jonah has
[51:30] I mean I would be thinking if I got ate
[51:33] by a fish that would be it for me
[51:38] you know what I mean I just
[51:43] but Jonah said I remembered the Lord
[51:47] and my prayer came in unto thee into thy
[51:52] Holy Temple now how did he know how did
[51:54] he know his prayer went out into the
[51:57] Holy Temple how did he know because he
[51:59] believed
[52:00] he believed
[52:03] we've got to believe that's the only way
[52:06] it works
[52:07] because all this time Jonah was running
[52:10] because he didn't believe
[52:13] but God got him in a place put him in an
[52:15] overwhelming place to where he had to
[52:17] believe
[52:19] a lot of times God puts us in situations
[52:21] because he wants us up higher to believe
[52:24] the full word for us
[52:27] he says in verse 8 they that observe
[52:29] lying vanities they forsake their own
[52:32] mercies you know the devil lies to us
[52:35] don't you
[52:37] you just got to call it out a line
[52:39] vanity
[52:40] he says but I will sacrifice unto thee
[52:43] with the voice of Thanksgiving I will
[52:46] pay that which I have vowed salvation is
[52:50] of the Lord now you know
[52:54] Jonah made a vow like many of us have
[52:57] I'm going to serve the Lord all the days
[52:59] of my life
[53:02] but what happens to us
[53:04] I'm saved I'm just going to do what I
[53:07] want to do now
[53:09] that God remembers your vow
[53:12] and God will hold you to your vow
[53:15] aren't you thankful for that
[53:17] and the Lord spake unto the fish and it
[53:19] vomited out Jonah upon the dry ground
[53:23] now I'll tell you that
[53:26] that was a great thing it all started
[53:29] with Jonah remembering the Lord
[53:33] God wants us to remember that there's a
[53:35] rock
[53:36] a rock no you may not be going through
[53:38] nothing now you may not be bothered now
[53:40] your mind may be on something else now I
[53:42] don't know but I'm telling you there'll
[53:44] come a time where you're going to feel
[53:45] so overwhelmed and I want you to know
[53:47] that there's a rock God wants you to
[53:49] remember that rock
[53:51] yeah
[53:52] look at job
[53:53] do you think he was overwhelmed by his
[53:55] situation
[53:57] many of his family members died
[54:00] separated from him without a notice
[54:02] couldn't make any closure
[54:05] his friends falsely accused him
[54:08] his wife said that you should just Curse
[54:12] God and die
[54:16] tell you there wasn't a whole lot of
[54:17] encouragement was there
[54:20] but you know what job did
[54:22] he remembered that there was a rock
[54:24] higher than him yes
[54:27] he said let come on me what will though
[54:30] he slay me yet will I trust him
[54:33] that's scripture that was his testimony
[54:36] he remembered that there was a rock
[54:38] higher than him
[54:41] look at those who went to the septica to
[54:43] see Jesus the Bible says that they were
[54:45] much perplexed and the angel said unto
[54:48] them why seek ye the living among the
[54:50] dead he is not here but risen remember
[54:54] how he spake unto you when he was yet
[54:58] in Galilee the Angels were actually
[55:02] leading these women to Remember The Rock
[55:06] to remember the word that was spoken at
[55:08] church
[55:10] you know a lot of times church is over
[55:11] we go on with our life and we kind of
[55:13] forget about it until we think about
[55:15] going to church or think about reading
[55:18] the Bible or think about listening to a
[55:20] taste but I'll tell you what we hear
[55:21] today God gives it to us for not just
[55:24] now not just what happened in the past
[55:26] but our future
[55:28] how else are we going to get perfected
[55:33] Luke 24 verse 8 says and they remembered
[55:36] his words
[55:38] in other words it was settled in their
[55:40] heart they remembered the rock the word
[55:42] of God and returned from the septica
[55:45] and told all these things unto the
[55:48] eleven and
[55:50] to all the rest
[55:52] now it was Mary and Jonah and Mary the
[55:55] mother of James and the other women that
[55:58] were with them which told these things
[56:00] unto the apostles
[56:02] now look at verse 11. and their words
[56:04] seemed as to them as Idol tales and they
[56:08] believed not
[56:10] now why is that because it was the truth
[56:17] we need to get desperate not to hear
[56:20] from John Martin
[56:22] not to hear from the preacher our
[56:24] favorite preacher stand behind the
[56:25] pulpit but we need to get desperate from
[56:27] hearing from God behind the pulpit
[56:30] because when God speaks to you there is
[56:32] no doubts
[56:35] but when you're hearing from a man
[56:36] you're going to question and doubt and
[56:38] place everything where you want to to
[56:39] kind of fit your understanding
[56:44] the Bible says in
[56:46] verse 12 then it Rose Peter ran to the
[56:48] septic Earth stooping down he beheld the
[56:50] linen clothes laid by himself and
[56:51] departed wondering in himself at that
[56:53] which has come to pass
[56:57] that's right and our personal lives we
[57:00] need to remember the Rock
[57:02] and we need to go get it
[57:04] we need to start climbing Mount Zion
[57:08] we need to start climbing higher towards
[57:10] Gods we need to literally set our
[57:13] affections on things above we need to
[57:16] draw nigh to God let them draw nigh to
[57:18] us we need to remember the Rock
[57:22] Psalms 104 Verse 18 says the hills are a
[57:26] refuge for the wild goats
[57:28] this is a good good scripture for sister
[57:31] Cheryl
[57:33] the high heels are a refuge for the wild
[57:36] goats and the rocks for the colonies
[57:40] those conies are rock rabbits
[57:45] the hills are a refuge for wild goals
[57:50] and the rocks for the colonies
[57:54] Psalms 1 21 says I will lift up my eyes
[57:58] unto the hills from Once cometh my help
[58:03] My Help Cometh From The Lord which made
[58:07] Heaven and Earth and he will not suffer
[58:09] thy foot to be moved and he that keepeth
[58:12] thee will not Slumber lift up your eyes
[58:16] for once cometh your help I believe that
[58:20] God has a rock right next to him
[58:23] remember that rock moved right when the
[58:26] children of Israel the Bible says that
[58:27] rock went with them
[58:29] I believe it was leading them
[58:31] it wasn't only following them but it was
[58:34] leading them do you believe that
[58:37] amen
[58:38] now we need to look to the hills where
[58:40] comes our strength the Bible says they
[58:42] that wait upon the Lord shall renew
[58:44] their strength
[58:46] I believe that's what David was doing he
[58:48] was waiting on the Lord they shall Mount
[58:51] up with wings as egos they shall run and
[58:53] not be weary they shall walk and not
[58:56] faint
[58:57] we need to spend some time crying out to
[58:59] God you know we cry about a lot of
[59:01] situations
[59:02] we cry when we don't get what we want
[59:04] do you ever cry when you didn't get what
[59:06] you want do you ever get angry and upset
[59:08] and cry and because you didn't get what
[59:10] you want
[59:13] but sometimes we just don't when's the
[59:16] last time you cried for the Lord because
[59:17] you just love him
[59:19] because you want to express your your
[59:22] soul
[59:24] sorry for not being all that he's called
[59:26] you to be
[59:29] I believe that's that relationship that
[59:32] God has wanting us to work on and I
[59:34] believe I don't think God wanted David
[59:36] to just
[59:38] spend time crying and suffering for no
[59:42] reason because David was a man after
[59:44] God's Own Heart
[59:48] and no matter what he did was wrong he
[59:50] got back up
[59:52] and he started heading for that rock
[59:55] and I don't care how many times you fall
[59:57] well brother John I passed seven times
[1:00:01] I don't care if it's seven times seventy
[1:00:03] get up and start going towards that rock
[1:00:05] God is looking for Overcomers in this
[1:00:08] age
[1:00:13] God gives the reward of strength to the
[1:00:15] believer who spends time with God
[1:00:18] he gives the reward of peace to them who
[1:00:21] practice keeping their minds stayed on
[1:00:24] the Lord because he trusts in them God
[1:00:26] rewards the believer with great peace if
[1:00:29] he loves God's word
[1:00:32] great peace have he that love my law
[1:00:35] nothing shall offend them right
[1:00:37] right you know we're just looking for a
[1:00:39] reason why it's okay to be offended
[1:00:43] like I got a reason
[1:00:46] no you're lacking love is what the real
[1:00:48] truth is
[1:00:52] uh I feel like having church today you
[1:00:55] know I would have been happy sitting
[1:00:56] here and listening to somebody preaching
[1:00:58] today I really would
[1:01:00] David wasn't crying out for God to take
[1:01:03] his trial away
[1:01:05] he knew if God had allowed this trial it
[1:01:08] was for a reason it was for a purpose
[1:01:10] and he wanted that purpose to be
[1:01:11] fulfilled so he never said take the
[1:01:13] trial away he just said lead me to the
[1:01:15] rock that is higher than I
[1:01:17] am we need to remember so often when
[1:01:20] we're going through pressure we want the
[1:01:22] pressure off of us somebody's stepping
[1:01:24] on your foot you want to get that
[1:01:25] pressure off of you
[1:01:29] look if God orchestrates a trial we
[1:01:31] ought to be praying God whatever you're
[1:01:33] trying to do through this trial let me
[1:01:36] do my part
[1:01:39] but we can be lifted up to a place where
[1:01:42] that doesn't bother us
[1:01:43] right we can get get thrown in the fiery
[1:01:46] furnace and we're not going to get burnt
[1:01:47] we're going to get thrown in the Lion's
[1:01:49] Den and we're not going to get eat up
[1:01:51] we don't have to fear we can open those
[1:01:53] doors cry out to to the Lord in prayer
[1:01:58] tell you what David did though
[1:02:00] because he knew that God had to fulfill
[1:02:02] his purpose he got desperate in prayer
[1:02:05] and he cried out to not be overwhelmed
[1:02:07] because of the situation and we must
[1:02:09] understand the difference we feel we're
[1:02:11] overwhelmed because we have the
[1:02:13] situation
[1:02:14] and our first our first thought is well
[1:02:17] if I didn't have this situation I
[1:02:18] wouldn't be overwhelmed
[1:02:20] well
[1:02:21] he would just been crying
[1:02:23] Lord take this situation away from me
[1:02:28] there would be nothing there about
[1:02:30] leading to a rock that is higher than me
[1:02:33] it just be take this situation and I
[1:02:35] won't be overwhelmed but see he wasn't
[1:02:37] looking at the situation carnally
[1:02:40] he was looking at it spiritually
[1:02:43] he knew God was in control
[1:02:46] and he knew that a word just one word
[1:02:49] from God a revelation from God what put
[1:02:52] him above his situation
[1:02:55] and that's all we need is a word from
[1:02:57] God
[1:02:59] a word a revelation a rock that we can
[1:03:02] hold to and then it didn't matter what
[1:03:05] happens to us here
[1:03:08] the Bible says Thy word is a lamp unto
[1:03:11] my feet and a light onto my path
[1:03:14] God gives us his word to overcome our
[1:03:18] overwhelmingness
[1:03:21] we sing that song by his word will
[1:03:24] prevail
[1:03:26] by the word of God we Prevail not by our
[1:03:28] word
[1:03:30] we're no match for the devil
[1:03:34] I want you to think about this the Bible
[1:03:36] says who can say I have made my heart
[1:03:40] clean
[1:03:44] nobody can clean their hearts it takes
[1:03:46] God
[1:03:47] we're not going to Prevail over the
[1:03:49] Devil by our own word
[1:03:52] we cannot defeat the devil on our own
[1:03:57] we cannot cast Devils out
[1:04:00] in our own name or by our own power
[1:04:03] Jesus told pilate he says you could have
[1:04:05] no power except it given to you of my
[1:04:08] father
[1:04:10] before Jesus left he said all power is
[1:04:12] given unto me
[1:04:14] and he promised that power to us
[1:04:17] if we receive him and we receive his
[1:04:20] word he'll give us power to overcome the
[1:04:23] devil
[1:04:24] I just want to spend a minute on
[1:04:26] overcoming this devil if I could
[1:04:29] Jesus is the only one that can overcome
[1:04:31] the devil
[1:04:32] and he paid that price at Calvary where
[1:04:35] he could come down now and live inside
[1:04:37] of you and take control of your life
[1:04:42] now when Jesus said to him that
[1:04:44] overcometh I will grant to sit with me
[1:04:46] on my Throne as I have overcome and sat
[1:04:49] down with my father in his throne
[1:04:52] we overcome
[1:04:54] through Christ
[1:04:56] that is the only way we can overcome the
[1:04:59] because Christ laid the example that he
[1:05:02] overcame through God
[1:05:04] when he surrendered his will not my will
[1:05:07] but thy will be done
[1:05:09] so we're not going to be able to
[1:05:11] overcome uh the enemy with our abilities
[1:05:13] and our achievement and the gifts that
[1:05:15] God had given us but it's through Christ
[1:05:17] Alone the Bible says I can do all things
[1:05:20] through Christ which strengtheneth me
[1:05:24] amen and this is the victory that
[1:05:26] overcometh the world even our faith our
[1:05:30] faith in Christ not our faith and our
[1:05:33] abilities but our faith in Christ now
[1:05:36] listen to these words that Jesus said he
[1:05:37] said be of good cheer for I have
[1:05:40] overcome the world
[1:05:44] now we look we look at that currently we
[1:05:46] say well of course your God In the Flesh
[1:05:48] of course you overcame but where does
[1:05:50] that put me
[1:05:51] well if he's living in you that puts you
[1:05:54] an overcomer
[1:05:56] well if you don't feel he's enough in
[1:05:58] you to overcome then maybe we need to
[1:05:59] start right there and start crying out
[1:06:01] to God and say God fill me with more of
[1:06:04] your spirit because he wants you to be
[1:06:06] of good cheer
[1:06:07] amen
[1:06:09] so when we allow the Overcomer to come
[1:06:12] into our life and have preeminence
[1:06:15] he will overcome through us
[1:06:19] not just be inside of us now this is a
[1:06:22] catchy one
[1:06:23] we don't want to look at that Jesus is
[1:06:25] just inside of us because we all believe
[1:06:27] that but here's the real question is he
[1:06:29] preeminent
[1:06:31] because he's not going to overcome
[1:06:33] through us if he's not preeminent in our
[1:06:35] life that's the reason he puts trials in
[1:06:37] our life is to turn us closer to God
[1:06:41] but when you give them preeminence then
[1:06:43] he overcomes the devil that's attacking
[1:06:46] us
[1:06:49] so if we're going to let Christ have be
[1:06:51] praying minced inside of us we need to
[1:06:54] be equally serious about loving not our
[1:06:58] own lives unto the death
[1:07:02] now I'll tell you when we're thinking
[1:07:03] about overcoming I want the situation in
[1:07:05] my life and I want I want Christ more in
[1:07:08] me we don't think much about dying out
[1:07:11] that's like two separate subjects and
[1:07:14] you know it's like this I believe it was
[1:07:16] John said that
[1:07:18] um I must decrease he must increase he
[1:07:21] must increase I must decrease
[1:07:24] for every one of our Lives if you want
[1:07:26] more of God you got to get less of
[1:07:27] yourself
[1:07:29] it you just can't maintain this the the
[1:07:32] the the the the I wants and my will and
[1:07:35] I'm gonna do do it my way and expect God
[1:07:39] to come and make you an overcomer in
[1:07:40] your life
[1:07:43] you can't have it both ways
[1:07:46] we need to give up deny our wants our
[1:07:49] will and ourselves
[1:07:51] if you want to overcome you're going to
[1:07:53] have to surrender
[1:07:54] all to Christ now this is a big thing
[1:07:56] but here we have learned to come to
[1:07:59] church
[1:08:01] hear the word of God
[1:08:03] and not change
[1:08:06] I'll say it like this and not change for
[1:08:09] the good because we do change brother
[1:08:11] random says you can't come to service
[1:08:13] and not be the same when you leave
[1:08:16] this word has come
[1:08:19] to strengthen us to build us up to put
[1:08:22] us more In His Image to get us ready for
[1:08:24] the rapture but when this word is being
[1:08:27] preached there needs to be such a hunger
[1:08:29] and such a faith inside of God's people
[1:08:32] to say Amen to every word of God and
[1:08:35] really mean it from the depths of your
[1:08:36] heart
[1:08:39] we need to let our testimony be the word
[1:08:41] the word the word this is what the word
[1:08:43] says you need to believe what the word
[1:08:45] says about you more than what you feel
[1:08:46] about yourself
[1:08:48] the Bible says we're going to be in His
[1:08:50] image be in his likeness and we need to
[1:08:52] remember the Rock
[1:08:54] this is what the word says it does not
[1:08:56] yet appear but we know that when he
[1:08:58] shall appear we shall be like him that's
[1:09:00] the Rock
[1:09:02] the whole earth is groaning waiting
[1:09:05] for us to be manifested
[1:09:08] to manifest the word it's it's waiting
[1:09:11] are we waiting are we anticipating are
[1:09:14] we longing are we Desiring
[1:09:17] because we got to become one with the
[1:09:19] word
[1:09:20] the word says nothing can separate us
[1:09:23] from the love of Christ that's nothing
[1:09:25] now we need to remember that
[1:09:28] so whatever the devil taunts in front of
[1:09:30] you and says you don't got enough time
[1:09:32] to give Jesus more
[1:09:35] calm out if you don't call him out he'll
[1:09:38] stay there
[1:09:39] I have learned that if you don't call
[1:09:41] the devil out he stays there
[1:09:44] he's allowed to stay right where you let
[1:09:48] him
[1:09:51] and sometimes we're just too afraid to
[1:09:53] say it like it really is I got this
[1:09:55] problem I've got this need I've got this
[1:09:58] thing happening I got these thoughts
[1:09:59] I've got I'm spending too much time for
[1:10:01] myself I'm I'm spending time doing the
[1:10:03] wrong things and you need to call it out
[1:10:05] and say that's wrong and Satan I come
[1:10:07] against you in the name of Jesus you
[1:10:09] need to do that you need to call it
[1:10:11] Devils out of your own life before
[1:10:13] you're worried about calling Devils out
[1:10:14] of somebody else's life
[1:10:20] he is our Rock we need to remember we
[1:10:22] have a rock we can change situations
[1:10:26] in the message Divine love brother
[1:10:28] Brandon says why do we fear then
[1:10:30] as long as we know
[1:10:33] the love of Christ is resting divinely
[1:10:37] in our heart not our love now the love
[1:10:40] of Christ is resting divinely in our
[1:10:42] heart
[1:10:43] that we've passed from Death unto life
[1:10:46] all demons out of hell hasn't got a
[1:10:49] chance to get in even at death
[1:10:52] if you'll I love this because it doesn't
[1:10:55] No period is a comma if you'll continue
[1:10:58] in that love and faith
[1:11:02] now what that really means
[1:11:05] is you got to be on fire for God
[1:11:11] so much what we think is continuing in
[1:11:15] the that love and faith is well I
[1:11:17] haven't made a decision I'm still I
[1:11:25] I'm still gonna love God
[1:11:29] that is not continuing to love God
[1:11:33] so this is a very powerful quote
[1:11:36] you've got to be honest with yourself
[1:11:38] because God is honest with you right
[1:11:41] and and you know you're no match for the
[1:11:44] devil you're not going to be able to
[1:11:46] take care of the devil you really need
[1:11:47] God
[1:11:49] and you need to submit to God you need
[1:11:51] to get serious you know I love the
[1:11:53] antidote that Jesus gave he said be
[1:11:56] zealous therefore and repent amen get
[1:11:59] excited about making things better in
[1:12:02] your life amen
[1:12:04] don't just allow that all everything
[1:12:07] that God is okay
[1:12:10] that's the laodicean spirit
[1:12:18] and they overcame the devil not by their
[1:12:20] own spiritual ability not by what they
[1:12:23] knew but by the blood of the Lamb or the
[1:12:25] word of their testimony they loved not
[1:12:27] their lives unto death you need we need
[1:12:30] to keep the token to fight her life
[1:12:33] that's what the prophet said we need to
[1:12:36] keep the token applied in our home
[1:12:38] applied to our family
[1:12:40] apply to our church body we need to keep
[1:12:43] the light applied
[1:12:47] the life of life
[1:12:50] not some picture of the blood but the
[1:12:53] life
[1:12:58] I understand that our desire is that God
[1:13:00] would take our trials away but God's
[1:13:02] desire is that we would overcome the
[1:13:05] trial
[1:13:07] we do that by
[1:13:09] knowing that there's a rock that is
[1:13:11] higher than our situation you know when
[1:13:13] we become overwhelmed become frustrated
[1:13:15] upset we try to do things and manipulate
[1:13:17] things and say things and and try to
[1:13:19] take a control
[1:13:22] and it usually ends up turning into a
[1:13:24] disaster
[1:13:27] it really does
[1:13:29] because when we do that we're literally
[1:13:32] showing that we don't believe
[1:13:35] there's a rock higher than us
[1:13:39] we're still in control
[1:13:41] we need to show God that we we trust
[1:13:43] you're in control
[1:13:46] that God is going to work it out
[1:13:50] when Jesus told his disciples that he
[1:13:53] was leaving them he said in Saint John
[1:13:55] Chapter 14 verse 1 he says let not your
[1:13:58] heart be
[1:13:59] amen what not your heart be troubled
[1:14:05] the real answer right here you believe
[1:14:09] in God
[1:14:10] believe also in me
[1:14:14] I am not going to leave you in this
[1:14:16] situation
[1:14:18] I'm not going to leave you in this
[1:14:20] situation of being overwhelmed of being
[1:14:23] troubled of being separated from me
[1:14:28] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:14:30] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:14:32] I go to prepare a place for you and if I
[1:14:35] go and prepare a place for you I will
[1:14:37] come again and
[1:14:39] where I am there ye may be also now I
[1:14:43] want you to remember this because when
[1:14:45] you're going through a trial God wants
[1:14:48] you next to him
[1:14:52] that's why he's leading you to a rock
[1:14:54] that's higher that's where he's at
[1:14:57] now I know he said I'll never leave you
[1:14:59] I'll never forsake you but God is not in
[1:15:01] a spot of turmoil God is not in a spot
[1:15:04] of confusion God is not in a place of
[1:15:06] being full of fear wondering what's
[1:15:07] going to happen he's not there he's with
[1:15:10] you but he's not there
[1:15:12] he's in a
[1:15:16] a place of of security a place of
[1:15:19] knowing he's I'm he's a I'm a president
[1:15:22] he's uh he knows everything he's God
[1:15:28] and when we forget
[1:15:30] that he's in control we become
[1:15:32] overwhelmed
[1:15:34] so God wants us by that
[1:15:37] where he's at and I'll have a scripture
[1:15:39] just shortly for us on that so we have a
[1:15:42] choice notice we have a choice every one
[1:15:45] of us has a choice when we become
[1:15:47] overwhelmed in our situations
[1:15:49] if Jesus said let not your heart be
[1:15:52] troubled he's presenting a choice
[1:15:55] is that some magic wand let not your
[1:15:58] heart be troubled no you still are a
[1:16:01] Freemore agency and you gotta you gotta
[1:16:04] make a decision where you're gonna stand
[1:16:06] the Bible says God is faithful who will
[1:16:08] not suffer us to be tempted above that
[1:16:11] which we are able but will with the
[1:16:13] Temptation also make a way of Escape
[1:16:16] that we may be able to what bear it
[1:16:20] parrot
[1:16:22] does it he doesn't take it away he gives
[1:16:25] you what you need to Bear it so you're
[1:16:27] not bothered you're not overwhelmed
[1:16:30] he lifts you above your situation your
[1:16:33] egos you're not chickens
[1:16:37] remember we have a choice
[1:16:40] be bothered or be led to the rock that
[1:16:43] is higher than us at that moment be
[1:16:46] bothered or let your heart be troubled
[1:16:49] so by remembering the Rock by believing
[1:16:51] the word that he is going to speak now
[1:16:55] here's the key
[1:16:57] we we believe that God
[1:17:00] oh
[1:17:02] when God spoke to Moses who he was
[1:17:07] and Moses just one is a legitimate
[1:17:10] question what do I tell pharaoh who you
[1:17:12] are
[1:17:14] because you're not the normal Nation
[1:17:17] King
[1:17:18] who do I tell that you are how do you
[1:17:22] want to be identified
[1:17:25] and he wanted to be identified as the I
[1:17:28] am that I had that I am
[1:17:31] so is the I am presently in your
[1:17:34] situation or the I was or that I hope
[1:17:37] will be
[1:17:39] God wants us to recognize him now right
[1:17:42] now speaking to my heart right now
[1:17:45] dealing with my situation right now that
[1:17:47] if I can just cash in and believe it
[1:17:52] you know we get so used to coming to
[1:17:54] church and just hearing a servant like a
[1:17:56] a a a a a conference get some
[1:17:58] information this is not about
[1:18:00] information
[1:18:02] this is about life
[1:18:04] the word of God brings life he said my
[1:18:07] words are spirit and they are alive amen
[1:18:10] and we got to catch him not the dead
[1:18:12] letter the dead letter is not going to
[1:18:14] do anything for us it won't make us walk
[1:18:16] out of here hole
[1:18:17] but the Living Word will
[1:18:21] The Living Word will
[1:18:23] Psalms 20 verse 7 says some trust in
[1:18:26] chariots some in horses but we will
[1:18:28] remember the name of our Lord
[1:18:30] our God
[1:18:33] now when we're bothered we're troubled
[1:18:35] we're overwhelmed we need to remember
[1:18:37] the Rock
[1:18:39] remember to cry out for God to lead you
[1:18:42] to the place higher than where you're at
[1:18:44] because a lot of times when we're
[1:18:45] bothered I mean just just naturally
[1:18:47] think about this I'm going I'm on my way
[1:18:50] I'm driving I get a flat tire I I pull
[1:18:53] over I make a phone call not gonna be
[1:18:56] there start pulling out the
[1:18:58] our mind is thinking about how could
[1:19:00] this happen to me right now
[1:19:04] and we're not remembering that somehow
[1:19:07] this could all be in God's Providence
[1:19:11] this could all be part of the plan of
[1:19:13] God
[1:19:14] and so we could get frustrated and
[1:19:16] bothered about the situation or we can
[1:19:18] just rest
[1:19:20] our thoughts on God
[1:19:24] and he could lift us above this
[1:19:27] situation yeah we still got to deal with
[1:19:29] the tire yeah we do but we're not
[1:19:31] bothered anymore
[1:19:33] and I'll tell you there's so many times
[1:19:34] the course of the day we can learn to
[1:19:36] practice those little things that when
[1:19:38] the big things happen to us
[1:19:41] we could learn
[1:19:43] how to be at peace with those big things
[1:19:47] God doesn't teach his children through a
[1:19:50] learning curriculum
[1:19:52] just come to church sit around and learn
[1:19:55] no character is built when we make the
[1:19:58] right choice in the middle of our trials
[1:20:01] we're either going to Remember The Rock
[1:20:04] or we're just going to take life in our
[1:20:06] hands
[1:20:07] now sometimes
[1:20:09] God leads us to a rock that is higher
[1:20:11] than us by speaking a word that we need
[1:20:15] to obey I want you to catch this how is
[1:20:18] God going to lead me to the rock that is
[1:20:19] higher than me he's going to speak to
[1:20:22] you a word that he wants you to obey and
[1:20:25] when you obey that word then you'll be
[1:20:28] lit then you will be lifted up above
[1:20:31] your trial amen
[1:20:33] I want you to catch that
[1:20:37] Matt on Matthew 7 verse 24 somebody
[1:20:39] getting something out of this I'll tell
[1:20:41] you I am just having a wonderful time in
[1:20:43] the Lord up here
[1:20:48] Matthew 7 verse 24 therefore whosoever
[1:20:50] here are these sayings of mine
[1:20:54] and do with them I will liken him unto a
[1:20:58] wise man which built his house upon a
[1:21:02] rock
[1:21:04] and the rain decided the floods came and
[1:21:06] the winds blew and beat upon the house
[1:21:08] and it fell not for it was founded upon
[1:21:12] a Rock Amen
[1:21:14] his word is The Rock
[1:21:17] so sometimes the word that he speaks to
[1:21:20] us will be trust me just trust me and
[1:21:24] sometimes the word that he'll speak to
[1:21:25] us will be obey me
[1:21:28] whatever it is you got to do it
[1:21:31] and I'll tell you when you're when you
[1:21:33] feel overwhelmed no matter which one it
[1:21:35] is it's hard to do
[1:21:37] when you're overwhelmed it's hard to
[1:21:39] trust and it's hard to do what he tells
[1:21:42] you to do
[1:21:44] but that is if you follow what he said
[1:21:47] that is how he's leading you to the rock
[1:21:50] that is higher than you
[1:21:53] we just can't you know haphazardly
[1:21:55] imagine that there's some rock up there
[1:21:57] that somehow you know just kind of
[1:21:59] poofed me up there no
[1:22:01] there's a reality of what's going on in
[1:22:03] our life God is real we may not be
[1:22:06] thinking of the middle of the day but
[1:22:07] he's thinking about us all the time
[1:22:10] now I know the thoughts I think towards
[1:22:12] you saith the Lord he hasn't expected
[1:22:14] and for the believer who also believes
[1:22:16] in expected end he's coming for those
[1:22:19] who love his appearing amen
[1:22:26] all right brother Rand said in the
[1:22:28] message the reaction to an action
[1:22:31] he says and if you're sure that you're
[1:22:33] born to the spirit of God
[1:22:35] that you have the Holy Ghost and the
[1:22:39] promise of God is yours
[1:22:42] I don't care what the devil does
[1:22:45] you can still rest assure
[1:22:48] Faith takes its unmovable stand
[1:22:51] faith cannot rest upon the shifting
[1:22:54] Sands of man's theology
[1:22:57] but it takes a solemn stand on the Rock
[1:23:00] of Ages which is unmovable
[1:23:03] there is a rest with Assurance no matter
[1:23:08] what comes or what goals my faith holds
[1:23:15] so no matter what the devil tries to
[1:23:17] tell you
[1:23:19] just tell him I won't be moved
[1:23:21] here here's what I have learned when I'm
[1:23:25] getting down to pray and there's a lot
[1:23:27] of battles that happen when you get
[1:23:28] serious about getting down to pray
[1:23:30] in the battles that go on is all the
[1:23:33] thoughts that you get different than why
[1:23:35] you actually got down to pray
[1:23:38] I mean sometimes we get done to pray
[1:23:40] about our situation but even when we do
[1:23:43] that we don't we don't kneel down a lot
[1:23:46] of times in faith we kneel down and oh
[1:23:48] Lord what about this I'm worried about
[1:23:50] this and what if this ends and what'll I
[1:23:51] do here Lord
[1:23:56] God wants us to kneel down in faith
[1:24:01] to start believing that greater is he
[1:24:04] that's in thee than he that's in the
[1:24:06] world
[1:24:07] greater Is God that's in me than this
[1:24:09] devil that's trying to talk to my head
[1:24:11] right now
[1:24:15] sometimes we're just too afraid
[1:24:17] are too proud to admit that the devil's
[1:24:21] speaking to us
[1:24:23] they don't know the devil ain't
[1:24:25] bothering me the devil ain't moving me
[1:24:27] that he's not and why are you acting the
[1:24:29] way you're acting
[1:24:32] yeah why are you gold why why are you
[1:24:35] choosing not to have the victory when
[1:24:37] you can have the victory
[1:24:43] a lot of times the devil will try to get
[1:24:45] us to lean on our own understanding
[1:24:47] because he wants to say how smart you
[1:24:49] are
[1:24:55] we need to recognize and resist those
[1:24:57] Temptations
[1:24:59] Deuteronomy 32 verse 31 says for their
[1:25:02] rock is not our Rock for the rock is not
[1:25:06] our Rock everybody doesn't trust in the
[1:25:08] same thing right
[1:25:11] we need to remember our Rock our rock is
[1:25:14] different than our own understanding
[1:25:15] amen
[1:25:17] Psalm 78 verse 35 says and they
[1:25:19] remembered that God was The Rock
[1:25:23] and the high tower
[1:25:25] and the high tower the Redeemer
[1:25:31] remember the rock that is calling you
[1:25:33] higher than where you're presently
[1:25:36] standing there is a rock higher than
[1:25:39] your situation
[1:25:41] we need to remember that
[1:25:43] because the devil wants to distract us
[1:25:45] from that to take us our thoughts away
[1:25:47] from that there's actually an answer
[1:25:49] right here I don't need this trial taken
[1:25:52] away from me but there's an answer right
[1:25:54] here
[1:25:55] and we need to remember that rock
[1:25:58] first Samuel 2 2 says there is none holy
[1:26:01] as the Lord but there is none for there
[1:26:04] is none beside thee neither is there any
[1:26:06] Rock like our God
[1:26:09] like our God Amen Deuteronomy 32 verse 4
[1:26:13] it says he is the rock his work is
[1:26:15] perfect for all his ways our judgment a
[1:26:17] god of Truth and without iniquity just
[1:26:20] and right is he how many can say God Is
[1:26:23] My Rock he is my rock it's got to be a
[1:26:26] personal
[1:26:27] now we must approach this rock
[1:26:32] in close of humility
[1:26:35] now he hides himself from the wise and
[1:26:37] the prudent
[1:26:42] but he will reveal himself from those
[1:26:45] who wear clothes of humility I believe
[1:26:47] that
[1:26:48] the Bible says that Moses
[1:26:50] was a Meek man
[1:26:53] I believe at that time that it was
[1:26:54] spoken that he was the meekest man on
[1:26:56] the on the planet
[1:26:58] I don't think it's a bad characteristic
[1:27:00] to be meek do you
[1:27:01] I think we could all use a little bit
[1:27:03] more of that don't you
[1:27:05] know Exodus chapter 32 verse 20.
[1:27:08] Exodus 33 verse 20 God told Moses thou
[1:27:13] canst not see my face for there shall no
[1:27:16] man see me and live
[1:27:19] and the Lord said behold there is a
[1:27:21] place
[1:27:22] by me
[1:27:25] and thou shall stand upon a rock notice
[1:27:29] where the rock is at it is beside Christ
[1:27:33] amen and it shall come to pass that
[1:27:37] while my glory passes by that I will put
[1:27:39] thee in the cleft of The Rock
[1:27:42] and we'll cover thee with my hand while
[1:27:45] I pass by
[1:27:47] Hallelujah there's a rock for us today
[1:27:51] God is literally leading us up to where
[1:27:54] he's at
[1:27:55] not down here
[1:28:00] think about the analogy that brother
[1:28:02] Brandon gave about
[1:28:04] the eagle in the barnyard
[1:28:10] God is always calling us to come out of
[1:28:13] our situation
[1:28:15] to come out of Doubt to come out of fear
[1:28:18] to come out of worry to come out of this
[1:28:22] thing that hinders God it's like puts
[1:28:24] handcuffs on God
[1:28:27] when we don't trust him
[1:28:30] and we think it's okay to be a Christian
[1:28:32] and not trust God you show me that in
[1:28:34] the Bible
[1:28:36] look I understand that we all slept we
[1:28:38] all fail we all go through things but
[1:28:40] what I am saying to you we're not
[1:28:42] allowed to sit around and do nothing we
[1:28:44] need a cry out to God we need to do what
[1:28:47] this Bible gives us an example to cry
[1:28:49] out to God and say God help me lead me
[1:28:52] to that rock that's higher than don't
[1:28:54] come to church and lead the same way you
[1:28:55] came
[1:28:59] God is calling us higher
[1:29:01] [Music]
[1:29:02] remember the rock there's a place by me
[1:29:05] and thou shall stand upon a rock
[1:29:09] God is a rot by his side for each and
[1:29:11] every one of us today
[1:29:12] Psalms 18 verse 2 says the Lord is my
[1:29:15] rock and my Fortress and my deliverer
[1:29:17] and my God in whom I will trust can you
[1:29:22] say that today I will trust my buckler
[1:29:24] my horn the Horn of my salvation and my
[1:29:28] high tower it sounds to me that uh God
[1:29:31] is is is you're all in all here yes that
[1:29:35] no matter what the problem is God Is The
[1:29:38] Answer amen and look at verse three I
[1:29:41] will call upon the Lord who is worthy to
[1:29:46] be praised and so shall I be saved from
[1:29:50] my enemies
[1:29:52] that's what David wanted he wanted to be
[1:29:54] saved from the situation
[1:29:57] and I'll tell you the biggest enemy that
[1:29:59] we have is ourselves we're the one
[1:30:01] that's not trusting God we think our
[1:30:03] enemy is
[1:30:04] this is my enemy
[1:30:06] no that none of these people are your
[1:30:09] enemy
[1:30:12] look in the mirror if you want to see
[1:30:14] your enemy
[1:30:18] because if you yield yourself to God
[1:30:21] the devil won't be able to get near you
[1:30:25] devil can't do anything else he's got a
[1:30:26] vessel to work through
[1:30:33] all right turn with me about I think
[1:30:36] this is time is wrapping up but I want
[1:30:39] to go to Psalms 27 if we could Psalms
[1:30:42] 27.
[1:30:50] all right I don't hear many pages
[1:30:52] going
[1:30:54] so
[1:30:55] for those that don't got a Bible we're
[1:30:57] going to put on the board
[1:30:59] the Bible says is the Psalms of David
[1:31:02] here the Lord is my light and my
[1:31:04] salvation Whom Shall I Fear
[1:31:08] the Lord is the strength of My Life whom
[1:31:11] shall I be afraid
[1:31:13] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[1:31:16] foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh
[1:31:18] they stumbled and they fell
[1:31:22] and look at his testimony here though a
[1:31:26] host should a camp against me
[1:31:30] my heart
[1:31:32] shall not fear
[1:31:34] can you honestly say that in your trials
[1:31:38] though this situation is going on my
[1:31:41] heart will not fear because this is
[1:31:43] spiritual
[1:31:45] this is Eagle food
[1:31:47] this is not some learning seminar
[1:31:51] because you will be faced with the test
[1:31:54] in a trial and you'll automatically
[1:31:57] you're going to fear or have faith
[1:32:00] but David is telling he says my heart
[1:32:02] shall not fear though War should rise
[1:32:04] against me in this will I be confident
[1:32:11] he said one thing if I desire to the
[1:32:13] Lord
[1:32:14] and that why I seek after
[1:32:16] that I may dwell in the house of the
[1:32:18] Lord all the days of my life
[1:32:21] to behold the beauty of the Lord and to
[1:32:24] inquire in his temper now don't you want
[1:32:26] to be in that place where Jesus is at
[1:32:29] amen
[1:32:33] for in the time of trouble
[1:32:36] he shall hide me in his Pavilion
[1:32:40] in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[1:32:42] hide me he shall set me
[1:32:45] up
[1:32:46] on a rock
[1:32:48] so in his Pavilion in his Tabernacle
[1:32:51] where he is at he has a rock he has a
[1:32:55] word when he speaks to you a word
[1:33:00] for that situation
[1:33:02] you don't have to be in this building
[1:33:08] but you have to be connected to him
[1:33:10] [Music]
[1:33:14] there's no way that David could
[1:33:16] literally spent his whole lifetime in
[1:33:19] the sanctuary
[1:33:24] he could spend his whole life with God
[1:33:26] though
[1:33:29] he knew there was a rock there and now
[1:33:31] shall my head be lifted up above my
[1:33:34] enemies round about me notice that just
[1:33:36] like those little
[1:33:37] mountain goats
[1:33:39] they're looking down at all those
[1:33:41] Predators trying to get to and they
[1:33:42] can't get to him
[1:33:47] and now shall my head be lifted up above
[1:33:49] my enemies round above me therefore what
[1:33:51] I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of
[1:33:55] Joy I will sing yea I will sing praises
[1:33:58] unto the Lord
[1:34:00] I'll tell you I don't think we should
[1:34:02] ever ever go a service without giving
[1:34:04] God our full effort in praising him
[1:34:08] you know it isn't like you're here 24 7.
[1:34:10] you come here for a little bit I think
[1:34:12] you should give them your best
[1:34:16] hear O Lord when I cry with my voice
[1:34:19] have mercy also upon me and answer me
[1:34:26] and he goes back and he says
[1:34:28] when you said Lord
[1:34:31] you need to spend time seeking my face
[1:34:34] my heart sent back to thee Lord
[1:34:37] thy face Lord will I seek
[1:34:41] look it sometimes God puts you in a
[1:34:44] situation because he wants you to get on
[1:34:46] your knees and seek him
[1:34:50] hide not thy face far from me put not
[1:34:53] thy servant away in Anger thou has been
[1:34:56] my help leaving not neither forsake me o
[1:34:58] God of my salvation notice you know I
[1:35:02] don't believe David was stumbling about
[1:35:04] his salvation I don't think he was
[1:35:06] stumbling about his relationship with
[1:35:08] God as as if
[1:35:10] um you know he was going to be
[1:35:13] eternally disconnected from God he was
[1:35:16] unchristianized no Jesus said abide in
[1:35:19] me abide in the vine you cannot do
[1:35:22] anything without me without me you could
[1:35:24] do nothing and we need to stay connected
[1:35:26] to God it don't just happen because your
[1:35:29] name hasn't changed because you're still
[1:35:30] living at the same house you're going to
[1:35:32] the same church you're saying you
[1:35:34] believe look at there's many people that
[1:35:36] believe the Bible there's many people
[1:35:37] that believe they say they believe this
[1:35:39] message but is this message inside of
[1:35:41] them
[1:35:42] it's got to be real to you
[1:35:48] he said when my father and my mother
[1:35:49] forsake me then the Lord will take me up
[1:35:54] teach me thy way O Lord and leave me
[1:35:56] lead me in a plane path because of my
[1:35:59] enemies delivering me not over to the
[1:36:01] will of my enemies for false Witnesses
[1:36:04] are risen up against me and and such as
[1:36:06] breathe out cruelty
[1:36:09] nah don't you ever be found breathing
[1:36:11] out cruelty
[1:36:13] don't you ever do that
[1:36:15] he said I had fainted unless I had
[1:36:18] believed to see the goodness of the Lord
[1:36:20] in the land of the living
[1:36:22] and look at how this this beautiful
[1:36:25] Psalms ends up wait on the Lord be of
[1:36:28] good courage and he shall strengthen thy
[1:36:30] heart wait I say on the Lord amen amen
[1:36:34] hallelujah
[1:36:36] kind of just do one more Psalms 4 40
[1:36:39] verse 1 says I waited patiently for the
[1:36:43] Lord
[1:36:44] and he inclined unto me and heard My Cry
[1:36:50] he brought me up also out of a horrible
[1:36:53] pit
[1:36:55] out of the Miry clay
[1:36:57] and set my feet upon a rock
[1:37:01] and established my goings yes amen God
[1:37:06] bless you let's Stand Together God wants
[1:37:08] to establish our goings amen when my
[1:37:12] heart is overwhelmed lead me to the rock
[1:37:14] that is higher than I
[1:37:17] so when your heart gets overwhelmed
[1:37:21] remember there's a rock
[1:37:25] and remember that rock
[1:37:28] is Christ
[1:37:31] and that he has a word for you to get
[1:37:33] where he's at because where he's at just
[1:37:35] when you remember the rock remember he's
[1:37:37] a God that's not bothered that's what's
[1:37:39] happening in Russia what's happening in
[1:37:41] Israel what's happening in California
[1:37:42] he's not bothered
[1:37:45] in fact I believe God's probably
[1:37:48] hearing more today brother Orlando he's
[1:37:51] hearing his bride more today say come
[1:37:54] Lord Jesus come quickly
[1:37:57] come Lord we want you we're so sick of
[1:38:01] this world
[1:38:02] there's got to be more
[1:38:04] than there is here
[1:38:06] so don't be moved God's got everything
[1:38:08] in control what we need to do is just
[1:38:10] start working on our personal
[1:38:11] relationship with God I hate to make it
[1:38:13] so simple but it is that simple
[1:38:16] we can't just we're not going to come
[1:38:18] here in here as a group of people and
[1:38:20] just somehow somehow automatically
[1:38:22] become the bride of Christ just because
[1:38:24] we we gather together twice a week
[1:38:26] we've got to take this word and make it
[1:38:28] personal for our lives
[1:38:30] amen let's sing without him I could do
[1:38:33] nothing
[1:38:35] [Music]
[1:38:46] [Music]
[1:38:49] without him
[1:38:56] away
[1:38:59] [Music]
[1:39:11] [Applause]
[1:39:13] [Music]
[1:39:23] [Music]
[1:39:29] [Music]
[1:39:38] I lost I would be
[1:39:43] [Music]
[1:39:59] without him
[1:40:07] but with Jesus
[1:40:09] thank God
[1:40:12] Jesus
[1:40:21] [Music]
[1:40:30] [Music]

[1:40:54] this is
[1:40:59] of anchored save me in glory
[1:41:04] [Music]
[1:41:06] for without him
[1:41:09] [Music]

[1:43:02] amen she continues to play that quietly
[1:43:05] if I could just get each of you to know
[1:43:09] your your heads your heart and just
[1:43:13] and respect to the Lord
[1:43:17] God is has spoken
[1:43:21] I trust to every one of our hearts in
[1:43:25] some way this morning
[1:43:28] he's definitely given us
[1:43:31] a way of Escape
[1:43:34] he's reminded us of a rock that's higher
[1:43:37] than us higher than our situations I
[1:43:40] wonder if there'd be someone here today
[1:43:42] said brother John would you would you
[1:43:45] remember me that that when I'm going
