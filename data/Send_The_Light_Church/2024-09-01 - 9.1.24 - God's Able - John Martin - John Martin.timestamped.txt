[37:39] Mark amen amen amen Genesis Chapter
[37:45] 18 we know this is the story here where
[37:50] uh God Appears unto Abraham we're going
[37:53] to read it kind of quick here I want us
[37:56] to notice the respect that Abraham had
[38:00] for God before God blessed him and the
[38:06] Lord appeared unto him in the plains of
[38:08] MRI and he sat in the tent Door In the
[38:12] Heat of the day and he lift up his eyes
[38:15] and looked and low three men stood by
[38:17] him and when he saw them he ran to meet
[38:19] them from the tent door and bowed
[38:22] himself toward the ground and said my
[38:25] Lord if now I have have found favor in
[38:28] thy sight pass not away I pray thee from
[38:32] thy servant let a little water I pray
[38:35] you be fetched and wash your feet and
[38:38] rest yourselves under the tree and I
[38:40] will fetch a morsel of bread and comfort
[38:42] ye your hearts after that ye shall pass
[38:45] on for therefore are ye come to your
[38:49] servant and they said so do as thou H
[38:53] has said and Abraham hastened into the
[38:55] tent unto Sarah and said make ready
[38:58] quick three measures of meal uh knead it
[39:01] and make cakes upon the Hearth and Abram
[39:06] Abraham ran unto the herd and fetched a
[39:10] calf tender and good and gave it unto
[39:12] the young man and he he hastened to
[39:16] dress it and he took the butter and the
[39:18] milk and the calf which he had dressed
[39:20] and set it before them and he stood by
[39:22] them under the tree and they did eat and
[39:25] they said unto him and they said unto
[39:29] him where is Sarah thy
[39:33] wife and he said behold in the
[39:36] tent and he said I will certainly return
[39:40] unto thee according to the time of life
[39:42] and lo Sarah thy wife shall have a son
[39:44] and Sarah heard it in the tent door
[39:47] which was behind
[39:49] him Abraham and Sarah were old well
[39:53] stricken in age and it ceased to be what
[39:55] Sarah after the man women
[39:57] therefore Sarah laughed within herself
[40:00] saying after I am waxed old shall I have
[40:05] pleasure my Lord being old
[40:08] also and the Lord said unto Abraham
[40:13] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[40:17] of a shy bear a son which am
[40:21] old is there anything too hard for the
[40:26] Lord amen I want us to remember that
[40:29] question now in 2
[40:31] Corinthians chapter
[40:34] 9 is anything too hard for the Lord I
[40:37] want us just to think about it for our
[40:38] lives
[40:40] amen 2 Corinthians chapter 9 starting
[40:44] with verse number six six is 6 through 8
[40:47] then we'll have you be
[40:49] seated by this I
[40:53] say he which sth sparingly
[40:57] shall reap also
[41:00] sparingly and he which sth bountifully
[41:03] shall reap also
[41:06] bountifully every man according as he
[41:09] purposeth in his heart so let him give
[41:13] not grudgingly or of a necessity for God
[41:17] loveth a cheerful Giver for God is able
[41:21] to make all grace abound toward you that
[41:25] ye always having all sufficiency in all
[41:28] things may abound to every good work
[41:33] amen God bless you and God bless the you
[41:37] may be seated and may God bless the the
[41:39] reading of his precious word to our
[41:42] hearts and just open uh our hearts to
[41:45] this little thought here that God is
[41:48] able I want to connect with you this
[41:50] morning and if I could
[41:52] just I guess you know I really want to
[41:55] just I want to speak to you
[41:59] directly but not only to you I want to
[42:01] speak to
[42:03] you and I I want to speak to everybody
[42:06] in this room I want to speak to those
[42:09] that are in the other rooms I want to
[42:12] speak to those that are on the live
[42:13] stream I want to speak to those even
[42:17] that didn't make the live stream but
[42:18] they're watching The
[42:21] Archives I believe that God wants us to
[42:24] know that he has a Grace for our our
[42:28] lives that can take care of whatever
[42:30] need that we may have
[42:33] am how many times have you have you
[42:36] thought I wish I would have done this
[42:39] when I was
[42:41] younger I I wish I would have done that
[42:44] and you can even be uh as as as as young
[42:48] as as Luke in in James I I wish I would
[42:51] have uh I wish I would have cleaned my
[42:54] room like my parents said so I didn't
[42:56] get in trouble
[42:57] amen I wish I would have taken better
[43:00] care of my teeth if I would have known
[43:03] what I know now I wish I would have
[43:04] taken better care of my body and my
[43:07] health I wish I would have started
[43:09] saving money when I was
[43:11] younger wish I would have started the
[43:13] 401 or my investments or or buying a
[43:17] house I wish I would have made better
[43:20] decisions I can see now that they were
[43:24] right I wish I would have listened to
[43:25] them I I should have followed their
[43:27] guidance we've all had these thoughts
[43:31] and why why because there is a law that
[43:35] what we sow is what we
[43:37] reap just like gravity what goes up
[43:40] comes down there's a spiritual law of
[43:43] God and it it also affects the natural
[43:47] realm like every seed brings forth of
[43:50] its kind sewing reaping is a real law of
[43:53] God and it extends far beyond the
[43:55] offering plate as these scriptures
[43:57] perhaps refer to but I want to dig in a
[43:59] little deeper than that if a person
[44:02] plants a few uh seeds of corn if you go
[44:05] down Heartland Road you turn to the
[44:07] right you'll see there's a little garden
[44:08] there and somebody planted a few seeds
[44:11] of corn it wasn't very many there's just
[44:12] some little stocks that come up and if
[44:15] you you plant a little bit of corn
[44:17] you're just going to get a few ears of
[44:19] corn but if a person plants a whole
[44:23] Field of Corn then he's going to receive
[44:27] so many bushels that he can't even carry
[44:29] amen just whatever you sow is what you
[44:32] reap our neighbor across the street they
[44:35] are beginning to reap the the alphalpha
[44:37] that they sold years ago and you can
[44:41] keep sewing you can keep reaping years
[44:44] and years with certain
[44:47] things people don't uh look too much
[44:50] into the visible or the spiritual realm
[44:53] of sewing and reaping it's kind of like
[44:57] out of sight out of mind type of thing
[44:59] for most people but it's just as real as
[45:03] natural seed so good to see sister Genie
[45:06] here that God has given her strength her
[45:09] body to be here the Bible says he which
[45:12] soeth sparingly shall reap also spearing
[45:16] you don't want to be stingy
[45:19] amen he which Seth bountifully shall
[45:22] reap also
[45:23] bountifully I want us to take a look at
[45:25] our lives and where we're
[45:28] at whatever you s that's what you're
[45:31] going to
[45:33] reap doesn't matter what kind of seed
[45:36] how many seeds it's all it's all up to
[45:38] you if you seow the word of God you will
[45:41] reap the benefits that the word of God
[45:44] gives you the the promises of of God in
[45:47] your life you you can't be sewing what
[45:50] you your own will and expect God's
[45:52] blessings it just doesn't work like that
[45:54] in the Garden of Eden there was natural
[45:56] seeds and there were spiritual seeds and
[45:59] there was also good seeds and Bad
[46:02] Seeds Jesus or The God said the day that
[46:06] you eat thereof is the day that you'll
[46:08] die and and it happened they they they
[46:12] sold that seed and they reaped that
[46:17] seed let's take a look here at what we
[46:21] need to do the the Bible says that we
[46:24] should so the seeds as as it we purpose
[46:27] in our heart and in other words God
[46:30] wants us to seow seeds from the
[46:32] sincerity of our heart not with
[46:35] manipulation amen not with well I I
[46:38] guess I got to give if I don't you know
[46:41] well you
[46:43] know I mean just like the offering plate
[46:46] right why don't we pass an offering
[46:47] plate one reason we don't want feel
[46:50] people to ever feel manipulated amen but
[46:53] I believe in the offering plate I don't
[46:54] I don't believe any service is complete
[46:56] with without an
[46:58] offering but I don't believe in
[47:00] manipulation but I also don't believe
[47:02] that we should manipulate the Holy
[47:05] Ghost In other words God got good track
[47:08] right he knows the numbers of our hair
[47:10] he knows whether we're given from our
[47:11] heart or when we're trying to hold back
[47:13] whether we're faithful with our ties and
[47:15] offerings or we're not but the main
[47:18] thing he says just do as you purpose in
[47:21] your heart if you purpose to plant three
[47:23] seeds in your garden
[47:27] or you purpose to plant 500 lbs of seed
[47:31] in a 40 acre field whatever you purpose
[47:35] whatever you seow is what you're going
[47:36] to get am you know I've always liked
[47:39] this that I'm so glad that I'm not I was
[47:43] never under the the spirit of I have to
[47:47] do only this Amen in other words if I
[47:51] wanted to do a better job if I wanted to
[47:53] give more if I wanted to lay down my
[47:56] life there was there was nobody telling
[47:57] me I couldn't do it
[47:58] amen because it's between me and
[48:02] God and I'm glad that there's an a rock
[48:06] solid Revelation that we can know that
[48:09] what we sow is what we're going to
[48:12] reap because I believe that we can be
[48:15] blessed I believe we can prosper in
[48:18] life if we if we sow a kind word once in
[48:23] a while well then God will see to it
[48:26] that once in a while you get a kind word
[48:29] back if you if you uh sow 500 pounds of
[48:36] seeds of kindness God's going to make
[48:38] sure that you reap acres and Acres of
[48:42] kindness if you s car sarcasm you're
[48:45] gonna you're going to reap it if you sow
[48:48] seeds of Doubt brother Bram says you get
[48:51] what you
[48:52] expect if you sow seeds of discrepancy
[48:55] Discord back Bri than Division and
[48:58] separation is what you're going to
[49:01] reap if you s constant seeds of divine
[49:04] love without respect to persons God will
[49:07] fill your life so full of the love you
[49:11] will be have room for anything
[49:14] [Music]
[49:16] else I love this it's in
[49:19] our choice amen it's what we want to S
[49:24] nobody forces it on us
[49:27] if we s seeds of hatred or anger or
[49:30] fighting or disrespect then God will see
[49:33] to it that our life is filled with those
[49:36] things because it's a law
[49:40] amen we can't just say we can't just do
[49:43] what we
[49:44] want say I'm sorry and keep doing
[49:48] it we got to make
[49:51] choices and the choices that we make
[49:54] have a difference of what our outcome is
[49:56] going to be
[49:57] so if we if our life is filled with
[50:00] living for others then God is going to
[50:02] bless you beyond
[50:03] measure beyond
[50:07] measure the Bible said that he is able
[50:11] to make all grace abound towards you
[50:15] that you should always having all
[50:17] sufficiency in all things may abound to
[50:21] every good work God is able to make all
[50:25] grace abound to that means he's also
[50:27] able to not
[50:32] amen now he is a god without respected
[50:35] persons and he loves
[50:37] everybody but he's also a God that set a
[50:40] law out there of reaping and
[50:43] sewing I like what Jesus said in Luke
[50:47] 6:38 he said and I'm sorry I didn't give
[50:49] time to write this one down to put in
[50:51] the back but he said give and it shall
[50:54] be given unto you
[50:57] good measure pressed down and shaken
[51:00] together and running over shall men give
[51:04] into your bosom for with the same
[51:07] measure that you might with all it shall
[51:10] be measured to you
[51:12] again so even Jesus is is is sharing the
[51:16] Bible is so full of making it real clear
[51:19] that you get what you
[51:22] give and and of course if you plant one
[51:25] piece of corn you get more than just one
[51:27] piece of corn right you get a whole
[51:29] stalk and you get ears and so you get a
[51:31] lot more just by planting
[51:34] one that that's the way that that God is
[51:37] and sometimes uh you know when we plant
[51:40] one bad
[51:42] seed right it it can it can also bring
[51:47] forth a lot of bad a lot more
[51:49] bad Galatians
[51:53] 6:7 Paul's saying to the Galatians here
[51:55] be not deceived so it's very easy to be
[51:58] deceived about this God is Not
[52:02] mocked for whatsoever a man Seth that
[52:06] shall he also
[52:08] reap for he that sth to his flesh shall
[52:11] reap shall of the flesh reap corruption
[52:14] but he that sth to the spirit shall of
[52:17] the spirit reap life
[52:22] Everlasting so naturally or spiritually
[52:26] a seed is a seed and God said let every
[52:28] seed bring forth of its own kind amen we
[52:32] just can't you know this is this is how
[52:35] deceptive it is we think we can act any
[52:38] way we want to and should expect to be
[52:41] blessed by
[52:43] others I I just I don't get that I just
[52:46] I mean how long do we got to live you
[52:48] only got to read the Bible one time and
[52:50] just believe the Bible
[52:52] right because the word is true I'm a
[52:55] liar but the word is
[52:58] true and the word it the word cannot lie
[53:02] I mean God said that I'm not good I
[53:04] believe
[53:08] it let us not be
[53:12] weary in well doing for in due season we
[53:16] shall reap if we faint not keep doing
[53:20] good keep giving keep living for others
[53:23] keep putting the word of God first in
[53:24] your life and it will come back to you
[53:27] God will not have one person on the day
[53:29] of
[53:30] judgment that that wasn't a true word
[53:34] amen not a
[53:36] one because God is not going to be found
[53:39] in front of the whole creation that he
[53:42] created as a liar to one person amen see
[53:46] understand God will hold true to his
[53:48] word we just got to obey it amen be not
[53:51] weary and well doing it doesn't matter
[53:53] if you're just so fed up and you've gone
[53:54] to the fire keep doing well
[53:59] as we have therefore opportunity let us
[54:02] do good unto all
[54:05] men you know we got one amen you know
[54:09] that takes a lot of thinking about
[54:11] others right as we have opportunity well
[54:14] you know I don't have any opportunity
[54:15] I'm too
[54:16] busy I am just too busy sister bman I
[54:20] hope it's okay she came over to help
[54:22] sister Cheryl with the house of course I
[54:25] got benefited from that because the
[54:27] house is cleaner
[54:30] right but she gave of
[54:35] herself and and you know honestly I
[54:38] think if I'm not mistaken Cheryl tried
[54:41] to like no no it's not
[54:44] necessary and then I think she you
[54:47] called
[54:48] an and then an you know so you know what
[54:51] I mean sometimes
[54:52] opportunity I say it like this I I think
[54:55] it was uh
[54:58] uh yes thank you my brother you get up
[55:00] here and preach with me Thomas Jefferson
[55:03] no no no Edison Edison he said uh uh
[55:06] opportunity is all around us it it's
[55:09] just it wears overhauls and it looks
[55:11] like work
[55:13] am and I think the scripture is telling
[55:17] as plainly as we have therefore
[55:19] opportunity let us do good unto all men
[55:23] especially unto them who are of the
[55:26] house Household of
[55:28] Faith taking time to do things for your
[55:32] brothers and your sisters I I believe
[55:35] that God looks at that and he will make
[55:38] all grace abound unto
[55:40] you now as we plant a a regular Garden
[55:44] we've all done that we got to take
[55:45] proper care we can't just plant the
[55:48] seeds we got to take proper
[55:51] care uh you just can't go out there and
[55:55] throw the seeds out like
[56:00] that that's right so it's important to
[56:04] seow the seeds the right
[56:07] way brother brandom said that when we
[56:09] apply the token I'm just to to speak
[56:11] spiritually for a second brother Ben
[56:13] says when you apply the token to your
[56:15] children you have to believe that what
[56:17] you're going to do is going to have an
[56:21] effect on
[56:22] themen so when you sew a seed into the
[56:26] garden
[56:27] you have to have a faith that that
[56:28] seed's going to go or you wouldn't even
[56:30] go out there to plant it you got to have
[56:34] faith so we need to make sure that we're
[56:36] planting seeds in the proper soils you
[56:39] just can't throw it on the hard
[56:41] ground and you may have to add some
[56:45] required now notice natural
[56:51] fertilizers make sure that you're you're
[56:53] watering the seeds as they need to be
[56:56] water watered you need to make sure that
[56:58] you you you you you pull the weeds out
[57:01] because they can choke out the real
[57:03] plants that you planted right we us we
[57:07] don't go and we just we don't go ahead
[57:09] and just kill everything that's in the
[57:11] soil then plant the seeds so we don't
[57:13] have to pull the weeds right we we have
[57:16] to pull the weeds amen now the the thing
[57:19] is if we don't take care of these things
[57:23] then we're not going to get the fruit
[57:25] that we would like to we know that weeds
[57:27] literally grow some weeds grow so much
[57:29] faster than than other than than our
[57:32] crops that we're planting true now a
[57:35] Believer must have faith when he soles
[57:37] the promises of God into his
[57:40] heart we got to make sure that our
[57:43] hearts are not hardened amen they're not
[57:47] Stony they're not filled with anxiety
[57:52] and and and filled with uh uh
[57:57] distrust and uh anger and and and doubts
[58:03] and uh just the things of the world
[58:06] because a seed will not grow a word of
[58:08] God will not grow in a heart like that
[58:11] you got to make sure that we're we're
[58:13] we're not filled with the wrong things
[58:16] because they'll literally choke out the
[58:18] word of
[58:19] God so we must water this seed day and
[58:23] night with praise with worship amen with
[58:28] Thanksgiving like I don't see the seed
[58:30] but I know it's going to come
[58:33] forth and then we get a we we see a
[58:35] couple leaves and we think well that's
[58:37] not what I was hoping for it takes time
[58:40] let us not be weary and well
[58:43] doing this is called
[58:47] taking proper care of the
[58:51] seed and if a Believer does not give the
[58:54] proper care of Faith to the seeds that
[58:57] he's sewn that they will also
[59:00] die so go plant a bunch of corn on top
[59:05] of some stones and see what happens or
[59:08] go plant them in some good soil but
[59:09] never get it
[59:11] water right so we've got to take proper
[59:15] care we just can't come to church and
[59:17] say Amen to the word and then that's all
[59:19] we're going to do with the word we got
[59:22] to take the word home and we got to
[59:23] start living it we got to start
[59:26] applying what we need to make the word
[59:28] come alive in our
[59:30] life the Bible tells us that we got to
[59:33] hold our beginning confidence firm unto
[59:36] the End Amen right so we just we just
[59:39] keep keep being firm to the End Amen
[59:43] sowing the word will reap the benefits
[59:46] of the word uh turn with me to Psalms
[59:48] chapter one and I I must say this came
[59:51] to me in our men's meeting when brother
[59:54] um Mark read these scriptures as he was
[59:57] reading of
[59:59] course my subject was coming God was
[1:00:02] speaking to me about today's
[1:00:04] message but we can see a lot here about
[1:00:08] the reaping and the
[1:00:10] sewing uh uh in in these first four
[1:00:14] verses Psalms chap 1 verse one blessed
[1:00:16] is the man that walketh not in the
[1:00:21] counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in
[1:00:25] the way
[1:00:26] with the Sinners nor sth in the seat of
[1:00:30] just being
[1:00:32] scornful we've been through these before
[1:00:35] but his Delight is in the word of God
[1:00:40] and in the word of God doth he
[1:00:43] meditate not just on Wednesdays and
[1:00:47] Sundays but he meditates day and night
[1:00:53] amen now if you s that verse three tells
[1:00:57] us what we
[1:00:58] reap and he shall be like a tree planted
[1:01:02] by the rivers of water that bringeth
[1:01:04] forth his fruit in his season and his
[1:01:07] Leaf also shall not wither prise the
[1:01:11] Lord and I love this last part and
[1:01:14] whatsoever he doeth shall
[1:01:18] prosper what soever he
[1:01:23] doeth can you imagine walking around
[1:01:27] with 5 million bucks in your
[1:01:31] pocket like wherever you want to eat
[1:01:34] whatever car you want
[1:01:36] to drive buy whatever house you want to
[1:01:39] buy going to the hospital you're not
[1:01:42] worried about you're not worried about
[1:01:45] money because you have what you need to
[1:01:47] take care of all the
[1:01:50] needs and if you have a
[1:01:52] promise that whatever you're going to do
[1:01:55] is prosper why wouldn't you do it with
[1:01:59] excitement because you know you put God
[1:02:01] first
[1:02:02] amen because this is his word if you you
[1:02:06] sow the word you reap the word if you
[1:02:08] don't seow the word you can't expect the
[1:02:10] reaping of the word and look the Saints
[1:02:13] this is for us individually I don't care
[1:02:16] who's sitting next to you I don't care
[1:02:18] who's sitting in front of you or behind
[1:02:20] you God is speaking to you directly it's
[1:02:22] up to you to take this word and say for
[1:02:24] me in my
[1:02:26] I want
[1:02:28] this now the ungodly are not so but they
[1:02:32] are like the chaff which the wind
[1:02:35] driveth
[1:02:37] away I mean if you think about that
[1:02:40] there's like no even you don't miss it
[1:02:43] you don't want it it never was part of
[1:02:46] the
[1:02:48] fruit right you understand what I'm
[1:02:51] saying so
[1:02:53] look we've got to take the word and
[1:02:56] start making it real to us I know we
[1:02:58] come to church and sometimes we're
[1:03:00] looking to get you
[1:03:01] know back excited with the word again
[1:03:04] you know we had a wonderful service last
[1:03:07] Sunday it was amazing service loved
[1:03:11] it but you know what that service in
[1:03:14] itself is not going to change my every
[1:03:19] day because that's not what the word
[1:03:21] says come to service hit a good service
[1:03:23] from a great from a great Minister and
[1:03:25] you know what whereever whatever you do
[1:03:27] you're going to prosper that's not what
[1:03:28] the word
[1:03:31] says so today we have what we need to
[1:03:36] start prospering am we have choices that
[1:03:39] we we make all the time and we we need
[1:03:41] to understand that God is able to make
[1:03:44] all grace abound to us am we can't
[1:03:47] forget
[1:03:49] that the missing sometimes we just miss
[1:03:52] the desire because the the Bible says
[1:03:54] but his Delight is in the law of the
[1:03:57] Lord if your Delight is not in the law
[1:04:00] of the Lord then how are you going to
[1:04:03] actually put your heart into
[1:04:06] meditating TR you know a lot of times
[1:04:08] we'll go ahead and we'll we ain't got
[1:04:09] much time but we'll you know read that
[1:04:11] bread of life and you know just kind of
[1:04:13] do our best to think on
[1:04:16] it and then you know just wait till the
[1:04:18] next day to the next bread of life you
[1:04:21] understand what I'm getting to you you
[1:04:23] you got to put your heart into God if
[1:04:25] you you want God to prosper you
[1:04:28] am problem why people aren't prospering
[1:04:32] they're they don't even care to know
[1:04:34] more about God and it's not that the
[1:04:37] knowledge of God but why why do you
[1:04:40] think God is is saying to you I'm going
[1:04:42] to prosper you if you put me
[1:04:47] first is he is he such a God that he
[1:04:49] doesn't want to prosper
[1:04:51] everybody is he such a GU is he is he
[1:04:54] acting like a respect to person he knows
[1:04:56] all that comes before him are theves and
[1:04:58] robbers they just want from him but God
[1:05:01] is looking for a
[1:05:02] relationship and I think too many
[1:05:04] Christians are get soaked up in this Le
[1:05:06] to see his Spirit get brought down at
[1:05:09] the cares of this world and they don't
[1:05:10] have faith that God is able to make all
[1:05:12] grace abound to him but he's able he's
[1:05:16] more than
[1:05:19] able people are so full of themselves
[1:05:22] they really don't care about God they
[1:05:24] become lovers of pleasure more than
[1:05:26] lovers of God Christians have literally
[1:05:28] lost their hunger and their thirst you
[1:05:31] know brother bam says a true Christ he
[1:05:33] can't wait till he gets to the house of
[1:05:35] the
[1:05:36] Lord well I'm still a Christian but I
[1:05:39] don't have that desire while I'm telling
[1:05:41] you friend you need to get filled with
[1:05:42] the Holy Ghost you know you you may want
[1:05:45] to water down the gospel but I'm telling
[1:05:47] you you can't water this down you can't
[1:05:50] you can water your life but you can't
[1:05:52] water this
[1:05:56] try putting out a fire that can't get
[1:05:58] put
[1:06:01] out you know the devil wants to put us
[1:06:04] out and he'll do it with the cares of
[1:06:07] this
[1:06:09] life David said in Psalms 42 verse1 as
[1:06:13] the heart panteth for the water
[1:06:16] Brooks so panteth my soul after thee Oh
[1:06:21] God not everybody's soul is is after God
[1:06:25] though
[1:06:28] he said my soul thirsteth for
[1:06:32] God not some
[1:06:35] picture right not some book on a table
[1:06:38] some picture on a wall but for the
[1:06:40] Living God
[1:06:43] Amen When shall I come and appear before
[1:06:47] God uh look at this verse three my tears
[1:06:50] are speaking here my tears have been my
[1:06:53] meat day and night
[1:06:56] while they continually say unto me where
[1:06:59] is thy God that's desperation brother
[1:07:03] brand said you we need to get desperate
[1:07:05] for
[1:07:06] God you know I understand that we we got
[1:07:10] sicknesses we've got problems we we've
[1:07:12] got Financial we there's so many things
[1:07:14] wrong but I'm telling you if we just
[1:07:17] learn to set it all aside and put our
[1:07:20] heart towards God first God will meet
[1:07:22] our need his his grace is more than able
[1:07:26] to give us all that we have need
[1:07:29] of but he wants to be first that's all
[1:07:32] there is to it he is not waiting for us
[1:07:34] to suffer so much and say okay you
[1:07:38] suffered no we just got to make a
[1:07:41] decision in our heart I'm going to put
[1:07:43] you first
[1:07:45] Lord Paul said in Philippians chapter 3:
[1:07:48] 10 oh that I might know him and the
[1:07:54] power of of his
[1:07:56] resurrection and the fellowship of his
[1:07:59] sufferings being made conformable on to
[1:08:03] his death I want you to understand he
[1:08:07] had this desire after 33 years of
[1:08:11] marriage with Jesus
[1:08:12] Christ 33 years of being married to
[1:08:16] somebody and he still had this hunger to
[1:08:20] want to know the Lord
[1:08:23] more you know I don't know what is with
[1:08:26] a lot of people but they could care too
[1:08:28] hoot sometimes if they even go to
[1:08:31] church you know what I think I think
[1:08:34] they're missing the Holy Ghost because
[1:08:36] once you get the Holy Ghost which is the
[1:08:38] Divine love of God you can't stand being
[1:08:41] away from
[1:08:43] iten brother randam say the Holy Ghost
[1:08:45] feeds on the word of God you got the
[1:08:48] Holy Ghost you want to
[1:08:52] feed it's awful quiet
[1:08:56] we should get excited about this amen
[1:08:58] well brother John you just stepped on my
[1:08:59] toes I did not mean to step on anybody's
[1:09:02] toes I'm just meaning that we need to
[1:09:04] get serious with God Amen instead of
[1:09:07] just acting like we're
[1:09:09] something true I don't who cares I don't
[1:09:14] care I don't think God
[1:09:16] cares he just wants a relationship a
[1:09:19] real
[1:09:21] relationship verse 11 if by any means I
[1:09:25] might attain unto the resurrection of
[1:09:28] the Dead how many wants to make a
[1:09:30] Rapture all right if by any means not as
[1:09:34] though I've already attained I've
[1:09:36] already apprehended either we're already
[1:09:39] perfect but this one thing I do I'm
[1:09:42] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:09:44] me and I'm reaching forth for those
[1:09:46] things which are
[1:09:53] before hunger
[1:09:56] a
[1:09:57] thirst a
[1:10:00] press you know you you talked to some
[1:10:03] Christians you look at some Christians
[1:10:05] life the way they act is I've
[1:10:09] attained I've
[1:10:12] apprehended I I I I've achieved I'm
[1:10:16] where I I should
[1:10:19] be where where where is that where what
[1:10:23] what is that spirit and where where do
[1:10:25] we get scriptures for that because I
[1:10:28] understand that we need to have
[1:10:30] confidence and assurance and we need to
[1:10:32] we need to we need to say Amen to what
[1:10:34] we have I understand that but you don't
[1:10:38] cross other scriptures to do that you
[1:10:39] still have to have a hunger and a thirst
[1:10:42] for more of God you still got to press
[1:10:45] the Bible says uh Paul said I press
[1:10:48] toward the mark for the prize of the
[1:10:50] high calling in Christ Jesus now you
[1:10:52] take a lot of modern day preachers and
[1:10:55] they would say you know what I I've been
[1:10:57] serving the lord for 33 years you know
[1:11:00] what I wrote 14 books that every
[1:11:03] Christian
[1:11:05] reads you know I had so many Revelations
[1:11:08] God had to give me a thorn in the
[1:11:12] flesh that wasn't Paul's attitude
[1:11:16] am Paul's attitude was I need more of
[1:11:20] the Lord that's right I need it
[1:11:25] is he knew that God was able to make all
[1:11:28] grace abound to him and he said verse 15
[1:11:32] let us therefore let
[1:11:36] us therefore as many as be perfect be
[1:11:40] thus minded how many think how many
[1:11:41] Wants to Be Perfect all you got to do is
[1:11:43] have this humble
[1:11:44] attitude amen I love it blessed are they
[1:11:48] which hunger and thirst after
[1:11:50] righteousness Jesus said for they shall
[1:11:53] be filled now now the problem
[1:11:56] is
[1:11:59] um a lot of times we end up eating
[1:12:02] because we just it's time to eat you
[1:12:04] know we really don't care whatever
[1:12:05] whatever you want to eat let's just Eat
[1:12:08] Right you ever had
[1:12:10] that but when you get to the place where
[1:12:12] I've got to have the word of God I've
[1:12:15] got to have it that's when God comes and
[1:12:19] fills
[1:12:21] amen God is able to make all grace
[1:12:24] abound in our life
[1:12:27] Saints now God is able to prosper
[1:12:32] us Psalms 1:3 says and he shall be like
[1:12:35] a tree planted by the rivers of water
[1:12:37] that bringeth forth his fruit in his
[1:12:40] season his Leaf shall not wither and
[1:12:42] whatsoever you do shall prosper God is
[1:12:44] able to take any human
[1:12:47] being who takes the word of God and
[1:12:50] believes it into the heart and prosper
[1:12:53] them anyone he's he doesn't have respect
[1:12:56] to person but you got to put the word
[1:12:58] first the problem is worldly Christians
[1:13:01] are trying to get Prosperity without
[1:13:06] God that's what the world's doing that's
[1:13:09] what worldly Christians do I'm going to
[1:13:11] prosper without putting God
[1:13:13] first well go ahead try
[1:13:16] it especially if you're a son or
[1:13:20] daughter of God I it won't happen it
[1:13:24] won't won't happen now if you're of the
[1:13:26] world it may
[1:13:28] happen but if you're of God God wants
[1:13:31] you to get in your place which is to put
[1:13:32] the word of God first
[1:13:36] amen why would any man want to prosper
[1:13:38] outside of God anyways I don't
[1:13:40] understand that the devil gets people to
[1:13:42] believe that God wants me to prosper no
[1:13:45] matter
[1:13:46] what
[1:13:47] no God wants us to prosper as our soul
[1:13:50] prospers am God
[1:13:54] first Joshua 1:7 still speaking and God
[1:13:58] is able to prosper us here Joshua 1:7
[1:14:03] only be thou strong very
[1:14:08] courageous you know one time I walked
[1:14:11] outside the back of the shop brother
[1:14:12] Ron's been in our shop brother Roger
[1:14:14] some of you been in our shop I walked in
[1:14:16] the probably many of you have years ago
[1:14:19] and I walked out in the back of the shop
[1:14:22] and one of my oh one of my nice
[1:14:24] employees put a dead snake right
[1:14:28] there oh and when I saw that I just
[1:14:31] about
[1:14:38] flipped courageous right I was when it
[1:14:42] comes to
[1:14:45] snakes being the shovel is the best
[1:14:52] friends but you know what it means to be
[1:14:54] courageous when I think of courageous I
[1:14:55] think of of David when he when he slew
[1:14:57] Goliath he slew the bear he slew the
[1:14:59] lion that's
[1:15:00] courageous he's you're going up against
[1:15:03] Great
[1:15:05] odds that's what God's telling us right
[1:15:07] here in this scripture amen only be thou
[1:15:11] strong and very courageous that thou
[1:15:13] mayest
[1:15:15] observe to do according to all the law
[1:15:20] which Moses my servant commanded the
[1:15:23] don't turn from it from the right hand
[1:15:25] or to the left that thou mayest Prosper
[1:15:28] whether soever thou
[1:15:31] goest again another book in the Bible
[1:15:35] telling us that if we put the word first
[1:15:37] we Prosper amen I love that it's like
[1:15:41] out of the mouth there two or three
[1:15:42] prophets let every word be
[1:15:44] established notice here the the key word
[1:15:47] is prosperity if God sent us a tent a
[1:15:51] prophet then we need to pay attention to
[1:15:54] what the prophet said in this age
[1:15:56] believe in the Lord your God so shall he
[1:15:58] be a St Believe In His prophets so shall
[1:16:02] ye
[1:16:04] Prosper we just got to do it verse eight
[1:16:07] this book of the law shall not depart
[1:16:11] out of thy mouth so in other words when
[1:16:14] your mouth starts speaking the wrong
[1:16:17] thing
[1:16:18] remember something departed from your
[1:16:21] mouth amen right are you with me yes and
[1:16:26] we're hearing this book of the law shall
[1:16:29] not Depart of th out of thy mouth but
[1:16:32] thou shall
[1:16:34] meditate
[1:16:36] therein day and
[1:16:39] night you mean just so I can you know be
[1:16:42] able to quote any Scripture no right
[1:16:45] here tells you why that thou mayest
[1:16:48] observe to obey the word to do
[1:16:51] accordingly all that is written there
[1:16:52] and there's the reason we go and we read
[1:16:54] that we meditate is so we know how to
[1:16:56] better please the Lord and when you're
[1:16:58] when you're exercising that desire to
[1:17:00] please the Lord the Lord says I'm going
[1:17:01] to prosper
[1:17:03] you is that is that
[1:17:06] simple you know no I just we're we're
[1:17:09] going do a group thing right now we're
[1:17:10] all going to say Amen at one
[1:17:13] time just the
[1:17:17] word for then Thou shalt make your way
[1:17:23] prosperous and then then Thou shalt have
[1:17:28] good
[1:17:29] success we got the key I love that
[1:17:33] brother I I think we just we we need to
[1:17:36] tell the devil what side we're standing
[1:17:39] on because as long as we let the
[1:17:43] devil buff us
[1:17:46] around he's going to
[1:17:49] stay but when we say I'm standing now
[1:17:53] more on the word
[1:17:56] yeah you may have a fight the devil may
[1:17:57] not like it I understand that but you
[1:17:59] will end up
[1:18:01] prospering it's worth the
[1:18:04] fight this has always been God's
[1:18:07] provided way for blessing and prospering
[1:18:10] his children to put God first seek ye
[1:18:12] first the kingdom and all the things
[1:18:14] shall be added unto you God first then
[1:18:17] you
[1:18:18] amen a lot of times we put oursel first
[1:18:22] and we fit God in somewhere down the
[1:18:25] Road God is able to make all grace
[1:18:29] abound to us each day we need to choose
[1:18:32] who we're going to put first every
[1:18:35] day make that decision are we going to
[1:18:37] love God with all of our heart or we're
[1:18:39] just going
[1:18:42] to love them when we can fit them
[1:18:45] in now this message is not is not meant
[1:18:50] to you know
[1:18:52] um you know make it like you're you're a
[1:18:55] deer in in the
[1:18:59] headlights and it's also not just it's
[1:19:01] not meant to be an encouraging message
[1:19:05] in the aspect I just want to make you
[1:19:06] feel
[1:19:08] good I do want to encourage you that if
[1:19:11] you really want to get serious with God
[1:19:13] God is able to meet every one of your
[1:19:15] needs
[1:19:16] amen that's what this word is for this
[1:19:19] word is for you to get serious with God
[1:19:22] so God can bless
[1:19:23] you remember
[1:19:25] when uh God spoke to brother brandom in
[1:19:28] a
[1:19:30] prophecy he said it he said this in the
[1:19:32] message St the guy but he said it in the
[1:19:34] number of
[1:19:36] messages and he he he says he starts
[1:19:40] reading the
[1:19:42] prophecy because now this is God
[1:19:45] speaking in Prophecy to brother bran
[1:19:46] because thou has chosen the Narrow Path
[1:19:49] the hard way thou has walked in your own
[1:19:54] choosing
[1:19:56] what you know whatever you purpose in
[1:19:58] your heart brother brandom whatever you
[1:20:02] purpose because he could have had a
[1:20:04] millions of dollars he could have had
[1:20:06] his own religion he could have had his
[1:20:09] own religion he could have had a big
[1:20:12] following he he could have had so much
[1:20:16] just like us we have choices that we can
[1:20:23] do but he sold the right
[1:20:27] seed he wasn't just a
[1:20:30] churchgoer he wasn't some sort of
[1:20:33] religious
[1:20:35] fanatic he wasn't just some
[1:20:38] storefront it was a real deal with
[1:20:41] him because thou has chosen the Narrow
[1:20:44] Path the harder way thou has walked in
[1:20:46] your own choosing thou has
[1:20:49] picked the
[1:20:51] precise and the correct way am the
[1:20:55] correct decision and God said and it is
[1:21:00] my way and brother Brian when he sharing
[1:21:02] this he says I underlined it my way
[1:21:06] because he said that was the Holy Ghost
[1:21:09] AM you know we're just like not
[1:21:11] interested in the Holy Ghost we're not
[1:21:13] interested in God's way we just want to
[1:21:14] go to church feel like we've you know
[1:21:16] achieved our our goal for the day for
[1:21:19] the week now we just go do what we you
[1:21:20] know put our mind on the next thing how
[1:21:23] do you expect to
[1:21:26] Prosper how do you expect all Grace to
[1:21:29] abound unto you look I am not interested
[1:21:32] in barely making
[1:21:34] it I'm not interested in getting a
[1:21:37] little joy to help me over a hump I want
[1:21:39] to be full of joy I want to be full of
[1:21:41] love and I don't want human love only I
[1:21:44] want Divine
[1:21:51] love because of this he calls it a
[1:21:55] momentous
[1:21:57] decision a huge part of Heaven awaits
[1:22:00] you you talk about
[1:22:02] reaping what a glorious
[1:22:04] decision thou has made he says now what
[1:22:07] a glorious decision now he says listen
[1:22:09] close what a glorious decision thou has
[1:22:13] made pay attention pay attention he's
[1:22:16] saying look at this watch listen
[1:22:20] closely you've made the right decision
[1:22:24] and other words you sold the right
[1:22:26] seed Our Lives we're going to plant on
[1:22:29] wherever we want right we're going to go
[1:22:31] eat at whatever restaurant we want to
[1:22:32] eat not me I have to go where brother
[1:22:35] Mark already asked where we're supposed
[1:22:37] to be
[1:22:38] going but for the most part everybody's
[1:22:41] going where they want to
[1:22:42] go right we're going to we're going to
[1:22:44] decide what we want to
[1:22:46] decide we got to decide to choose the
[1:22:50] harder way amen The Narrow Path and we
[1:22:54] need to do it of our own choosing not
[1:22:55] because the preacher said you
[1:22:57] better not about what the preacher
[1:23:01] says it's about your heart's love for
[1:23:04] Jesus
[1:23:06] Christ this in itself is that which will
[1:23:10] make and come to pass that tremendous
[1:23:11] victory in love
[1:23:16] divine a tremendous victory in love
[1:23:19] divine how many wants love
[1:23:21] divine if you've ever experienced love
[1:23:24] Divine there is nothing like it in the
[1:23:26] whole world nothing I've never
[1:23:29] experienced anything like love divine I
[1:23:32] haven't I mean I've had a lot of great
[1:23:35] experiences you the Bible tells us that
[1:23:38] we can enjoy the fruit of our labor with
[1:23:41] working with our
[1:23:44] hands and how many times you get done
[1:23:46] doing a project and you look at w that's
[1:23:48] is really
[1:23:50] nice you we we get to do that we get to
[1:23:53] enjoy but there is is nothing like
[1:23:55] Divine love am
[1:24:00] nothing brother BR went on to say in the
[1:24:03] same
[1:24:03] message two
[1:24:05] paragraphs now in the love divine or
[1:24:09] Divine love he says how can that be
[1:24:12] divine love if it isn't the Holy
[1:24:15] Ghost he said the holy spirit is divine
[1:24:19] love now why am I saying that why is
[1:24:21] that so important because so many people
[1:24:23] say that got the Holy
[1:24:25] Ghost but they don't have
[1:24:28] love they can't live for others or
[1:24:31] living selfishly but yet they say they
[1:24:33] got the Holy Ghost like you tell them
[1:24:35] you need to get the Holy Ghost and they
[1:24:36] get all offended and bent out of
[1:24:41] shape I I can imagine talking to Paul
[1:24:44] the Apostle Paul Paul you you need to
[1:24:46] get the Holy Ghost I want you to know
[1:24:48] brother John I'm pressing in for
[1:24:50] more I want would you come pray with me
[1:24:53] cuz I want more
[1:24:54] to that's what I see the right Spirit
[1:24:57] not defending like we some you know more
[1:25:00] more what do they say more Wars have
[1:25:01] been fought with over religion I don't
[1:25:03] know if that's a true statement but you
[1:25:05] understand we're so willing to defend
[1:25:06] what we got and we just want we won't
[1:25:08] give one
[1:25:10] humble one humbleness of okay I'll get
[1:25:14] more you know what I'm
[1:25:19] saying the reason I wanted to bring this
[1:25:21] up is when brother Brandon went beyond
[1:25:23] the curtain of time he was was
[1:25:24] experiencing this amazing feeling of
[1:25:26] divine
[1:25:27] love and a voice spoke to him and said
[1:25:30] this is what you already preached this
[1:25:32] is the Holy
[1:25:34] Ghost but when we think of preaching we
[1:25:36] think of going to church and somebody's
[1:25:38] preaching from the word of God they're
[1:25:40] preaching you know just the word
[1:25:42] Whatever It Is Well if you think about
[1:25:44] it this word which is the written holy
[1:25:50] spirit is love
[1:25:53] divine who so keepeth the word loveth
[1:25:55] God God is love we are hearing about
[1:25:59] Divine love every time we come to church
[1:26:01] if we don't even speak the word divine
[1:26:03] love when the word is being preached it
[1:26:05] is God's love to us it's his love
[1:26:12] letter experiences what is
[1:26:16] this this is what you preach it's the
[1:26:18] Holy Ghost
[1:26:24] look if you got the Holy Ghost bring out
[1:26:27] that Badge of
[1:26:31] love if you just love you don't have to
[1:26:34] say you got the Holy
[1:26:36] Ghost if you just lay down your life you
[1:26:39] don't have to prove anything your life
[1:26:42] is living
[1:26:42] [Music]
[1:26:44] it a huge portion of Heaven oh wait see
[1:26:49] God is able to make all grace abound to
[1:26:50] us see to me this is a
[1:26:54] this is our our chance to get ready for
[1:26:57] heaven that's all this is It's a chance
[1:26:59] to get ready for heaven and and if we
[1:27:02] take it seriously God can prosper us
[1:27:05] give us joy give us peace give us love
[1:27:07] there's lots of things where we can
[1:27:09] prosper right not just in money are you
[1:27:13] with me Psalms 126:5 says they that so
[1:27:19] in tears shall reap in
[1:27:22] Joy so I'm this this is we're going to
[1:27:25] get into how we seow what we need to do
[1:27:29] to get this they that seow in tears
[1:27:32] shall reap in Joy he that goeth forth
[1:27:35] weeping be bearing precious seed shall
[1:27:38] doubtless come again rejoicing bringing
[1:27:40] their sheaves with him turn with me if
[1:27:43] you would to James chapter
[1:27:45] 4 you know God gives so much more grace
[1:27:48] to a humble believer than to a proud
[1:27:51] believer trth amen
[1:27:58] you know how there's
[1:27:59] repellant for insects and
[1:28:03] animals yes I was working on
[1:28:05] the uh rocks yesterday and the
[1:28:09] mosquitoes were just getting on me so I
[1:28:11] just ran to the uh garage and I got some
[1:28:15] spray and I just sprayed it all over
[1:28:18] me because I didn't want to get bit I
[1:28:21] was trying to deter them away from me
[1:28:25] and I believe pride is the biggest
[1:28:28] deterrent of
[1:28:32] God you don't want God by you all you
[1:28:35] got to do is just be
[1:28:38] proudful just have a proud heart proud
[1:28:42] spirit I don't need to
[1:28:44] listen you know God will just stay so
[1:28:47] far away from you something funny true
[1:28:50] true I'm just being honest because we we
[1:28:53] got to get to the roof
[1:28:54] so we can get to what we need to get to
[1:28:57] to get all Grace to abound to us amen
[1:29:01] verse six James 46 but he giveth more
[1:29:03] grace wherefore he sayith God resisteth
[1:29:06] the proud there it is repels but he
[1:29:10] gives grace to the
[1:29:15] humble so submit yourself therefore to
[1:29:19] God resist the devil and he'll go
[1:29:22] bye-bye amen
[1:29:25] you draw a ey to God meditate day and
[1:29:28] night he'll draw an ey to you if you're
[1:29:31] serious clean up your life cleanse your
[1:29:35] hands you Sinners purify your hearts you
[1:29:38] double-minded you be afflicted mourn
[1:29:41] weep let your oh I don't need to do this
[1:29:45] your laughter turn into mourning and
[1:29:47] your joy into
[1:29:49] heaviness that's how you humble yourself
[1:29:51] humble yourself in the sight of the Lord
[1:29:54] and he praise God nobody else and he
[1:29:58] shall lift you
[1:30:01] up boy and when God picks you up you
[1:30:04] don't have to worry whether anybody's
[1:30:06] standing with you or not you don't need
[1:30:08] anybody to say you're up there right
[1:30:11] speak not every evil speak not evil one
[1:30:14] of another
[1:30:16] Brethren he that speaketh evil of his
[1:30:18] brother and judgeth the brother judgeth
[1:30:21] uh judge um speaketh evil of the law and
[1:30:23] judgeth the law basically what you're
[1:30:25] doing is if if I say uh you know brother
[1:30:29] Mark I I I I I just don't like
[1:30:37] Bob you know what I did by saying I
[1:30:39] don't like
[1:30:41] Bob to brother
[1:30:44] Mark I'm speaking against
[1:30:48] God I'm speak and God wasn't even
[1:30:50] brought up it was just between me and
[1:30:52] Bob but there scripture is telling me
[1:30:54] when I judge my brother I'm a judge of
[1:30:57] the law and we know the law is God right
[1:30:59] but if thou judge the law Thou Art not a
[1:31:01] doer of the law but a judge and there's
[1:31:04] one lawgiver who's able to save and to
[1:31:08] destroy who art thou that judgeth not
[1:31:10] okay so God is able to make all grace
[1:31:12] abound and he's able to
[1:31:15] destroy whatever our attitude is humble
[1:31:18] or proud so we got to tap into God's
[1:31:22] grace we got to tap into into it God is
[1:31:25] able to make all grace abound unto us
[1:31:29] that we would always have all
[1:31:31] sufficiency in all things that's can you
[1:31:33] imagine just walking around with the
[1:31:39] checkbook we just need to be busy
[1:31:41] non-stop seing the word of God in our
[1:31:43] life God wants me to do this God wants
[1:31:45] me to do that God wants me to pray God
[1:31:46] wants me to love God wants me to be
[1:31:51] faithful nonstop
[1:31:54] soul that you'll see God will bless you
[1:31:56] and if God never gave you a nickel more
[1:31:59] but he filled you with joy unspeakable
[1:32:03] full of Glory wouldn't it be worth it
[1:32:07] amen be able to march up to the Lion's
[1:32:10] Den March up to the fiery furnace and
[1:32:13] never be whining about
[1:32:16] it have
[1:32:20] joy Peter don't don't crucify me like my
[1:32:24] Lord put me upside
[1:32:29] down he wasn't worried about
[1:32:33] dying he felt unworthy to die as as his
[1:32:36] Lord I'm telling you there's something
[1:32:39] here Saints it's it's a real God living
[1:32:42] inside of us and he's able to make this
[1:32:46] grace abound onto us but we've got to
[1:32:49] humble oursel and start sowing more of
[1:32:51] the right seeds amen
[1:32:58] we got a
[1:33:00] soul the right
[1:33:02] seeds God is able to give us more favor
[1:33:06] more strength more joy more love he's
[1:33:10] able to he's able to sustain us the
[1:33:13] Bible says all sufficiency in all things
[1:33:16] so just think of every aspect of your
[1:33:18] life that you want God you want help
[1:33:20] raising your kids right
[1:33:22] there you want help on your job right
[1:33:25] there you want job with your spouse
[1:33:26] right there amen you want help with more
[1:33:30] love for go right
[1:33:33] there he'll give us Better
[1:33:36] Homes and
[1:33:38] Gardens and Green
[1:33:41] Houses yes he's
[1:33:44] able he's truly able give us better
[1:33:47] relationships better
[1:33:49] atmospheres hope in all
[1:33:52] situations God is able to make all grace
[1:33:55] abound toward you that you would always
[1:33:59] have all sufficiency in all things that
[1:34:02] you may abound to every good do you ever
[1:34:04] have somebody come over the
[1:34:06] house there's a number of times we'll be
[1:34:10] eating a family member will stop in and
[1:34:13] we only like you know cook for like
[1:34:16] three at this time with an and Cheryl
[1:34:20] and myself well really I don't really do
[1:34:22] any of the cooking so I don't want you
[1:34:23] to think I
[1:34:25] do and then some some will one of the
[1:34:28] other children will come and well I'll
[1:34:31] just I'll simply just take a little
[1:34:33] piece and kind of you know push it over
[1:34:35] there without anybody
[1:34:37] knowing but isn't it nice when you cook
[1:34:40] a whole big pot of spaghetti and there's
[1:34:42] tons of food and there's enough for it
[1:34:44] to eat five times in a row and somebody
[1:34:47] comes in and you we have sufficient food
[1:34:50] what a feeling that is we're okay we're
[1:34:53] covered
[1:34:54] I tell you I want to be covered with
[1:34:56] God's
[1:34:59] grace and he's able to do it he's
[1:35:04] able what's stopping him
[1:35:06] me I'm stopping
[1:35:10] him it it's like I need to make the
[1:35:13] decision that brother Brandon
[1:35:15] made to choose the harder
[1:35:20] way Philippians 4:13 says I can do all
[1:35:24] things through Christ which strengthens
[1:35:27] me that means I can humble myself
[1:35:30] more I can
[1:35:33] commit to remaining humble after I
[1:35:36] commit
[1:35:39] myself I can do all things through
[1:35:42] Christ who strengthen me you know you
[1:35:43] can how many times you made a decision
[1:35:45] at church I'm gonna I'm going to try to
[1:35:47] be more
[1:35:49] humble God is able to help you stay
[1:35:52] committed to that
[1:35:55] God will give you Grace as you humble
[1:35:58] yourself to the
[1:36:00] word and that's what we need to tap into
[1:36:03] this morning tap in God's Grace by faith
[1:36:08] Romans chapter 5 verse2 we got to we got
[1:36:10] to hurry and I'll tell you just so you
[1:36:12] know this morning I'm just going to say
[1:36:14] this if we're later this morning I am
[1:36:17] totally blaming it on you because you're
[1:36:19] not saying amen
[1:36:20] enough usually I I take responsibility
[1:36:23] 24 but not this
[1:36:27] time I want to make sure you're getting
[1:36:30] it Romans 52 by whom also we have access
[1:36:36] by faith into this
[1:36:41] grace we need to believe it we need to
[1:36:43] hope for it we need to trust for God's
[1:36:45] grace we need to hang on to that
[1:36:48] confidence because it's by faith we have
[1:36:51] access into God's grace we're in we
[1:36:53] stand and rejoice in the hope of glory
[1:36:56] of the glory of God and not only not
[1:36:59] only so but we glory in our
[1:37:03] trials tribulations why do we do that
[1:37:06] because we know that those things work
[1:37:09] patience and that patience actually it
[1:37:14] works experience and we all need
[1:37:15] experience right you don't want somebody
[1:37:18] doing it working on your car that's
[1:37:19] never worked on a car before you want or
[1:37:22] or or having surgery with somebody
[1:37:23] that's never done surgery before you
[1:37:25] want somebody with experience so we all
[1:37:27] want experience how to handle
[1:37:30] problems right and a experience
[1:37:34] hope that gives you when you got
[1:37:36] experience it gives you hope for the
[1:37:39] next thing that you have need of amen
[1:37:41] and hope maketh not ashamed because the
[1:37:43] love of God is shed abroad in our hearts
[1:37:46] by the Holy
[1:37:47] Ghost what a connection there the love
[1:37:51] of God is shed abroad in our heart by
[1:37:53] the holy G which is given unto us you
[1:37:56] know the Bible says in Psalms 16:7 when
[1:38:00] a man's ways please the Lord he'll make
[1:38:03] even thy enemies to be at peace with
[1:38:08] thee it kind of sounds to me that God is
[1:38:10] able to make all grace abound to us
[1:38:15] amen a lot of times we have a problem
[1:38:17] with somebody you know what we do we
[1:38:18] always blame the other
[1:38:21] person oh what they they they they they
[1:38:25] it's never I've never heard one person
[1:38:29] say I feel that maybe I did something
[1:38:32] that wasn't pleasing to the
[1:38:36] Lord I'm so glad that I have a word that
[1:38:40] can open my eyes can be a light to my
[1:38:42] path to show me what the truth of the
[1:38:45] situation the whole world is full of
[1:38:47] Courts and and lawyers and and judges
[1:38:50] and
[1:38:51] fightings trying to prove who's
[1:38:56] right when when a man's ways please the
[1:39:00] Lord he maketh even his enemies to be at
[1:39:03] peace with
[1:39:04] him wow how many want that well we have
[1:39:08] the antidote we know what to do so if we
[1:39:10] want more grace we need to be more
[1:39:12] humble and please the
[1:39:14] Lord and if you want more humility we
[1:39:17] simply need to fear the lord more the
[1:39:19] fear of the Lord is the beginning of
[1:39:21] wisdom the fear of the Lord is what
[1:39:23] brings more grace in our
[1:39:25] life Isaiah 66 ver1 I need to go maybe
[1:39:30] uh skip of over a few of these things as
[1:39:32] we're closing this morning I won't be
[1:39:36] ministering for quite a while
[1:39:38] so got to get L
[1:39:41] right Isaiah 66 how many is how many is
[1:39:45] actually this this message is helping
[1:39:49] you that's what really really really
[1:39:51] matters Isaiah 66 61 says thus sayith
[1:39:54] the Lord the heaven is my
[1:39:57] throne and the Earth is my foot
[1:40:01] stool where's the house you're going to
[1:40:02] build me and where is the place of my
[1:40:05] rest for all those things have my hands
[1:40:08] already
[1:40:10] made and all those things have been
[1:40:13] sayeth the
[1:40:14] Lord so so if you're going to get my
[1:40:20] attention but to this man will I
[1:40:24] look this this this is going to draw my
[1:40:27] attention away from what's in in my
[1:40:32] life even to him that is poor and of a
[1:40:36] contrite spirit
[1:40:39] and
[1:40:41] trembleth at my word amen
[1:40:46] amen this is a spirit and an attitude
[1:40:53] I don't know how many times I have seen
[1:40:56] people come into the
[1:40:59] church they're not fearing the
[1:41:06] word their their mind is on other
[1:41:10] things but yet they want some sort of
[1:41:12] help they want God to look on them in a
[1:41:15] favorable
[1:41:18] way if we want God's favor then we've
[1:41:23] got to tremble at his word amen and
[1:41:27] there's a lot here to tremble
[1:41:30] at we can be we can tremble at one thing
[1:41:33] but there's many things that we maybe
[1:41:35] get a little hay at oh I don't need to
[1:41:36] do that God sees my
[1:41:40] heart look if you if if you
[1:41:44] want God's attention then you got to do
[1:41:48] what God
[1:41:49] wants his word is so much more important
[1:41:51] than whatever we got going anyways
[1:41:53] if the Bible says forsake not the
[1:41:55] assment of ourselves together we need to
[1:41:57] tremble at that scripture tremble at
[1:42:00] it if the prophet brought the mind of
[1:42:04] God and how to have church order then we
[1:42:05] got to tremble at that if Jesus said man
[1:42:09] shall live by every word of God we need
[1:42:11] to tremble at that the if Jesus said
[1:42:14] judge not that we be not judged then we
[1:42:16] tremble not well I got that
[1:42:20] covered tremble amen and now you don't
[1:42:24] have to
[1:42:25] tremble you you you kids you adults you
[1:42:29] don't have to
[1:42:30] tremble but if you want God to look upon
[1:42:34] you
[1:42:35] favorably he told us what to do is
[1:42:39] it it's a choice brother brandom chose
[1:42:43] the harder way amen he
[1:42:47] sold the
[1:42:49] seed that brought forth
[1:42:54] a huge part of Heaven that awaits
[1:42:58] him
[1:43:00] wow that's the CP of seed I want to I
[1:43:02] want a
[1:43:04] soul if Jesus said if you if you forgive
[1:43:07] not men their trespasses neither will
[1:43:09] your father forgive you your trespasses
[1:43:11] we should tremble at that amen the key
[1:43:14] is learning to tremble at the word of
[1:43:17] God get contrite in your spirit get
[1:43:20] humble in your spirit get Meek in your
[1:43:22] spirit did not Jesus said learn of me
[1:43:23] for I'm Meek and
[1:43:25] lonely why why wouldn't his people be
[1:43:28] the same way if Jesus is Meek why
[1:43:31] wouldn't we be
[1:43:32] meek a lot of times human would just
[1:43:35] pout be stand offish or get attitudes
[1:43:39] and and and they they like like you're
[1:43:42] trying to get attention yeah you you
[1:43:45] guys can relate to this we all can yet
[1:43:48] you ever not get what you want from
[1:43:50] somebody
[1:43:55] and you
[1:43:59] just give him the cold shoulder do a
[1:44:01] little
[1:44:02] pouting get
[1:44:05] standoffish and why are you doing that
[1:44:08] you're doing that for one reason to get
[1:44:11] their attention I'm going to let them
[1:44:14] know that don't get God's
[1:44:17] attention that gets the devil's
[1:44:20] attention you want God's attention it's
[1:44:23] just the opposite you humble yourself
[1:44:26] you say Lord you're right I'm wrong your
[1:44:29] way not my way amen God is able to make
[1:44:33] all grace
[1:44:35] abound all grace
[1:44:41] abound we just got to open up the
[1:44:45] door purpose in your heart to so the
[1:44:48] word of God bountifully in your life

[1:44:54] make a commitment tonight today I'm
[1:44:56] going to go home and I'm going to start
[1:44:57] practicing this in my home
[1:45:00] amen and there's a lot to practice
[1:45:03] because we're we're we're so many things
[1:45:05] that we're doing so many interactions
[1:45:07] with our
[1:45:08] families just make the commitment I'm
[1:45:11] going to humble
[1:45:13] myself I'm going to repent for my
[1:45:17] rebellious
[1:45:18] Spirit my lawlessness Spirit my
[1:45:21] laxidasical
[1:45:23] Spirit my uncaring spirit my arrogant
[1:45:26] Spirit my proud Spirit see I don't know
[1:45:28] what spirits that you deal
[1:45:32] with but I'm pretty sure that we've
[1:45:35] battled some of these don't you think
[1:45:37] amen I'm going to start fearing what the
[1:45:39] Bible
[1:45:41] says I'm going to become more faithful
[1:45:43] I'm going to become more obedient I'm
[1:45:45] going to do what God is calling me to do
[1:45:48] because I believe that God has truly
[1:45:51] predestinated me to be come in His image
[1:45:54] amen I'm going to become in the I I'm
[1:45:57] committed to the character of God I'm
[1:45:59] I'm committed to the nature of God and I
[1:46:02] I'm going to I'm going to come forward
[1:46:04] in in in church with a better attitude
[1:46:07] than I've ever had before amen amen you

[1:46:13] will begin to bless you you take one
[1:46:15] step forward to God God takes one
[1:46:17] towards you draw nigh to God he'll draw
