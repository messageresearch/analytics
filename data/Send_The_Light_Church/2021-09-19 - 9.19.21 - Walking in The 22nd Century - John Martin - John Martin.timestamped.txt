[42:18] every need in our life
[42:20] pray that a special blessing for those
[42:22] that are not here today those that are
[42:24] watching and that desire to be here but
[42:27] they cannot be i pray that you'd meet
[42:29] them in a very special way today lord

[42:44] amen
[42:45] matthew chapter 5 starting with verse
[42:47] number 13 year of the salt of the earth
[42:50] but if the salt had lost its savior
[42:53] where we shall be salted
[42:54] is therefore
[42:56] it's not good for anything
[42:58] but
[42:59] you might as well cast it out
[43:01] and to be trodden down under
[43:04] everybody's feet
[43:06] ye are the light of the world
[43:08] a city that is set on a hill cannot be
[43:10] hid neither do men light a candle and
[43:13] put it under a bushel
[43:14] but on a candlestick
[43:18] and it giveth light unto all that are in
[43:20] the house
[43:22] let your light so shine before men that
[43:24] they
[43:25] may see your good works
[43:27] amen and glorify your father which is in
[43:30] heaven
[43:31] amen god bless you may be seated
[43:36] praise the lord
[43:39] notice they have to see the good works
[43:41] they cannot just see the words
[43:44] can't see words
[43:46] but you can see words manifested in your
[43:49] works
[43:51] and that's where the emphasis needs to
[43:52] be i'm entitled this message
[43:56] walking in the 22nd century
[43:59] that's where we're at
[44:02] before i get into this message i just
[44:04] want to say thank you again for all your
[44:05] prayers
[44:07] for
[44:08] the church
[44:09] in its progress
[44:12] we're grateful to the lord
[44:15] that he's brought us thus far
[44:17] i believe we got our permits at the end
[44:19] of july last year
[44:21] the end of july so it took a while to
[44:23] get them after we bought the building
[44:26] so it seems like it's been a long time
[44:28] and it's kind of been a long time
[44:29] because we're just anxious to get in
[44:30] there
[44:31] uh but it's just been over a year just a
[44:34] little over a year and we we did get our
[44:36] permit and we're we're grateful for that
[44:39] obviously we're trying to do just a
[44:41] little bit more in the areas that we're
[44:42] working to make it more presentable so
[44:44] we don't have to go in there now of
[44:46] course when you're going to go in there
[44:47] and you're going to see
[44:48] holes in the wall and stuff because we
[44:50] just do not have time to finish
[44:52] everything or else you know we just get
[44:55] it done for tribulation we take off you
[44:57] know it won't do us any good
[45:00] so
[45:01] our first service in the new church is
[45:04] going to be wednesday
[45:06] october 6th
[45:08] wednesday october 6th write that down
[45:12] and this service is just for us
[45:16] we're not allowed to invite anybody
[45:20] i don't want us to
[45:23] but the service afterwards which is
[45:25] sunday october 10th
[45:27] i want you to invite as many new people
[45:29] as you can to come and celebrate amen
[45:33] but i thought the first service would be
[45:36] good for just the family our family
[45:40] you know we've
[45:41] we have suffered the most
[45:43] we've been here for umpteen years in
[45:45] this fishbowl
[45:47] as it were
[45:49] and
[45:50] just been coming year after year after
[45:52] year
[45:53] god bless you
[45:55] god reward you with the rapture is my
[45:57] prayer
[46:00] um
[46:02] i i believe that every one of you i
[46:04] could be wrong but i believe every one
[46:06] of you are going to be blessed beyond
[46:08] what you think when we get there amen
[46:13] and you deserve it
[46:15] you deserve it so much
[46:19] well let's get into the message today
[46:21] walking in the 22nd century who would
[46:24] have ever thought we'd be walking in
[46:26] this in this 22nd century
[46:30] it's so spiritually dark brother branham
[46:33] couldn't see beyond going 1977.
[46:37] that's how
[46:39] much
[46:40] things have gone 44 years beyond 1977.
[46:46] paul told timothy evil would get worse
[46:48] and worse and we see it happening
[46:52] there's also at the same time that
[46:53] things are getting worse there's a great
[46:55] falling away
[46:56] right
[46:57] i
[46:58] thought i would never see the perversion
[47:00] that i'm seeing right i had my own ideas
[47:03] 20 years ago what was going to happen is
[47:04] in the days of la and it's nothing like
[47:07] i thought
[47:10] here's some 22nd century facts
[47:13] in this in this century there is a
[47:16] social media addiction
[47:21] addicted people are addicted in every
[47:24] fashion formal way to their phone
[47:28] they don't wake up
[47:30] thinking about
[47:31] looking at anything other than their
[47:34] phone first
[47:38] death from overdose
[47:40] of drugs
[47:42] has doubled in this century
[47:45] student loan crisis has more than
[47:48] doubled in this century
[47:50] there's an estimated 1.5 trillion
[47:52] dollars in student debt
[47:55] the only larger credit debt for the
[47:57] american is the mortgage debt which we
[47:59] understand
[48:03] you would not think that
[48:05] trying to get education would be
[48:07] such a business
[48:09] but it is
[48:12] researchers from the university of
[48:14] chicago
[48:15] call air pollution the world's top
[48:18] killer today it's cutting off an average
[48:21] of two two years of everybody's lives
[48:25] obesity and diabetes rates have
[48:27] increased
[48:29] according to the latest world happiness
[48:31] report
[48:32] happiness has declined in this century
[48:38] there's a great fear because
[48:40] hate for others has increased to
[48:43] alarming rates
[48:46] radical divisions political divisions
[48:49] and now
[48:50] how to handle the covid
[48:54] divisions
[48:57] there's divisions and
[48:59] right inside of
[49:00] it people all over the world feel more
[49:04] divided than they ever did a decade ago
[49:07] a survey of 27 countries from a majority
[49:12] of people
[49:13] and all but two countries feel that
[49:15] their society is divided
[49:18] siberia leads with 93 percent of the
[49:20] people believing their country is
[49:21] divided followed by argentina and chile
[49:24] in the u.s
[49:26] 84
[49:27] of the people believe their nation is
[49:30] divided
[49:32] you can't hardly go anywhere and he and
[49:35] not hear about somebody passing away
[49:39] from either the colvid
[49:41] virus and now it's so much i'm hearing
[49:44] it
[49:44] about those that have taken the vaccine
[49:46] we had somebody come over a house just
[49:48] yesterday and told us somebody passed
[49:50] away
[49:52] it's it's happening more than what we
[49:55] realize
[49:56] it's it's causing such a fear and such a
[49:59] division
[50:02] because iniquity abound the love of many
[50:04] is waxing cold jesus said
[50:07] these things
[50:09] it's it's
[50:11] causing us
[50:13] to love less
[50:16] to love others less
[50:18] human trafficking has more than tripled
[50:22] since the last century
[50:25] human trafficking occurs in every
[50:27] country including all 50 u.s states
[50:33] it's plain to see the direction the
[50:34] world's heading
[50:36] straight
[50:37] into the greatest tribulation that has
[50:40] ever faced this planet
[50:43] death is all around us
[50:45] we're living in the hour of the great
[50:47] unknown amen
[50:49] whether it's spiritual death
[50:51] or natural death it's all around us
[50:53] we're hearing about it we're reading
[50:54] about it we're feeling it
[50:57] yea though i walk through the valley of
[50:59] the shadow death i will fear no evil
[51:03] why because thou art with me
[51:07] thyroid and thy staff they comfort me
[51:11] his word corrects and his word comforts
[51:14] and when we come to church it's okay to
[51:16] get some correction
[51:17] we know we're we're in line we want to
[51:19] be in line with him but his word brings
[51:22] a comfort to us as well
[51:25] he maketh me to lie down in green
[51:27] pastures this morning
[51:30] he leaves me beside the still waters and
[51:32] all the stuff that's going around out
[51:34] there in the world he leads us
[51:38] he causes us
[51:39] [Music]
[51:41] to just stop and hear his word
[51:44] he's leading us away from the turmoil
[51:46] the trouble the confusion
[51:48] and helping us to settle down amen
[51:52] thank god he makes makes us to sit still
[51:55] in church and listen
[51:57] amen
[51:59] you can see it's hard for some people
[52:02] brother brahms said in this message just
[52:04] one more time lord he said eliezer
[52:07] sweated it out till he found character
[52:09] in rebecca
[52:12] then he had to get her dressed up and
[52:15] ready
[52:16] let her stand still and listen at his
[52:18] message
[52:21] the trouble of it is today
[52:23] when you find character it's hard to
[52:25] make them stand still long enough to put
[52:28] the clothes on and get them dressed up
[52:31] in other words the message
[52:33] found
[52:34] the bride right
[52:36] but you don't want to get dressed with
[52:38] the word what the message is saying
[52:40] they're just happy to say i'm in the
[52:42] message
[52:44] what about getting dressed what about
[52:46] taking the word that's being preached
[52:48] and applying it to your life
[52:52] he's causing us to lie down amen
[52:56] still waters
[52:58] too often we assume that we
[53:01] know where we're at with god
[53:04] psalms 19 verse 12 says who can
[53:06] understand his heirs cleanse thou me
[53:08] from secret faults i got them amen
[53:11] now who can understand your heirs we
[53:14] think we don't got very many
[53:17] i'm pretty i only got this one thing
[53:20] verse 13 keep back thy servant also look
[53:23] at this word from
[53:25] presumptuous sense
[53:28] let them not have dominion over me
[53:30] then shall i be upright and i shall be
[53:33] innocent from the great
[53:35] transgression amen
[53:38] presumptuous
[53:39] we're living in such an evil deceptive
[53:42] hour
[53:43] we really don't want to live
[53:44] presumptuously
[53:49] god has prepared a table for us in the
[53:51] presence of our carnal nature our
[53:54] greatest enemy
[53:56] we need to be
[53:57] hungry
[53:59] for god to come and show us what we're
[54:02] assuming is okay
[54:05] we need we come here to find out where
[54:06] we're at with god
[54:11] that's how come you know when we get
[54:12] that kind of attitude that's why we get
[54:13] so easily offended when we hear
[54:15] something true
[54:19] we need our our hearts anointed our cup
[54:22] running over
[54:24] because he wants to lead us in paths of
[54:26] righteousness amen
[54:29] now despite all the death that's around
[54:31] us we ought to be shining brighter than
[54:32] ever amen
[54:34] when jesus walked in his own physical
[54:36] body he said in john chapter 9 verse 4 i
[54:39] must work the works of him that sent me
[54:43] while it is day
[54:45] the night cometh when no man
[54:48] can work
[54:51] he said as long as i'm in the world i'm
[54:53] the light of the world
[54:56] now jesus is no longer in the world
[55:01] my question is is he in your world
[55:06] does he have liberty in your church
[55:11] or do you call the shots
[55:13] is your church man-made
[55:20] now it's harder
[55:22] to
[55:24] notice jesus in people's lives
[55:27] jesus was the pure word
[55:30] the fullness of god was in the body of
[55:32] jesus
[55:34] and look what they did to him
[55:37] he said how much more will they do to
[55:39] you
[55:41] it's important that we shine all the
[55:44] time
[55:46] john chapter 14 verse 19 jesus said yet
[55:49] a little while in the world seeth me no
[55:52] more
[55:53] but ye see me
[55:54] amen you see me the world don't see you
[55:56] but you see me because i live you shall
[55:59] live also and that that day you shall
[56:00] know that i am in the father and you and
[56:02] me and i in you
[56:05] praise god for a relationship with jesus
[56:08] christ
[56:09] now as we receive the living word
[56:13] not a dead letter but as we receive the
[56:16] living word we shine that word right
[56:20] amen but all if all we do is hear it
[56:23] carnally and we're not gonna we're not
[56:25] gonna shine it we won't manifest it
[56:28] so we've got to receive it matthew
[56:30] chapter 5 verse 14 are opening scripture
[56:32] jesus said no you are the light of the
[56:35] world i was when i was in the world but
[56:38] i'm going to be with you and now you are
[56:40] the light of the world and it's really
[56:41] not our light right people look at my
[56:45] light they're going to be in darkness
[56:46] that's true there's nothing there's no
[56:48] one good not one
[56:50] but we've if if there's anything good in
[56:52] any of us it's the light of god amen
[56:55] so you are the light of the world that's
[56:56] jesus in you a city that is set on a
[56:59] hill cannot be here jesus does not want
[57:03] you to hide in your house and say i'm a
[57:06] christian in the message
[57:10] neither do men light a can no put in her
[57:12] bushel
[57:14] but on a candlestick that it giveth
[57:16] light
[57:18] unto all that are in the house
[57:19] everywhere that your house goes
[57:21] you ought to be a light to the person
[57:23] you're talking to amen
[57:26] i don't care how much more light they
[57:28] have
[57:29] i don't care how much more spiritual
[57:31] they are you ought to be a light to them
[57:38] your modem should be shining
[57:42] he said let your light so
[57:44] shine before men that they may see your
[57:46] good works and glorify your father which
[57:48] is in heaven
[57:54] your works isn't necessary
[57:57] changing the oil or washing the dishes
[58:01] but your works could be changing the oil
[58:04] washing the dishes without complaining
[58:09] it's living a life so full of the holy
[58:13] ghost that when you're bumped
[58:15] nothing but love comes out
[58:18] my cup run is over bump it all you want
[58:23] you want us i mean
[58:25] somebody that's not filled with the holy
[58:27] ghost
[58:30] can become a very scary situation
[58:34] now you cannot be a light of the true
[58:35] gospel if you do not follow the word
[58:38] that's leading you out of darkness now
[58:40] here's the problem we come to church and
[58:42] we don't think there's any darkness
[58:44] that's right
[58:46] it's i don't ever come to this church
[58:48] and think there's no darkness in your
[58:49] life i will never believe that god will
[58:52] never believe that but you may believe
[58:54] that that's right right
[58:56] and that's why a lot of people do like
[58:58] coming to this kind of of of preaching
[59:02] because they don't want to hear about
[59:03] that
[59:05] just like you don't want to go to a
[59:06] funeral and hear about the person that's
[59:09] there
[59:10] made his choice
[59:13] that no matter what choice they make
[59:15] they want to go to a funeral and hear
[59:16] that no matter what he's going
[59:18] to heaven
[59:20] well that's not true
[59:22] but people want to hear that
[59:26] i want to hear where i'm wrong
[59:28] because that gives me a chance to get
[59:30] right
[59:31] and where i'm wrong is darkness
[59:34] and what he preaches
[59:43] jesus said in john chapter 8 verse 12
[59:45] then jesus spake again to them saying
[59:48] i am the light of the world
[59:50] he that followeth me
[59:52] shall not walk in darkness
[59:55] but shall have the light
[59:57] of life
[1:00:01] so from the moment that he saved us from
[1:00:03] the moment that we got baptized
[1:00:06] we begin we started our journey to walk
[1:00:09] in the light
[1:00:10] amen
[1:00:11] at that moment
[1:00:13] we were illuminated
[1:00:14] amen
[1:00:16] we wanted to tell the whole world yes
[1:00:18] sir i'm saved
[1:00:20] i'm a christian
[1:00:23] but then we kept going to church and all
[1:00:26] of a sudden
[1:00:27] i got to get rid of my records i got to
[1:00:28] cut my hair
[1:00:30] i got a
[1:00:32] i can't tell dirty jokes
[1:00:37] and god began to show more darkness
[1:00:41] in our life
[1:00:43] calling us to get more serious with him
[1:00:47] and today he's still calling out of
[1:00:50] darkness
[1:00:52] calling us to walk in the light and we
[1:00:54] and as we walk in that light we now
[1:00:56] begin to manifest works of that light
[1:01:00] for instance
[1:01:02] if i just had a hot temper and i got
[1:01:04] upset
[1:01:05] every time my wife asked me to make the
[1:01:07] coffee i flew off the handle at her
[1:01:13] and i go to church and the minister is
[1:01:16] ministering
[1:01:17] and he reads the scripture uh
[1:01:20] be angry and sin not
[1:01:25] well i can either think that's just a
[1:01:27] man quoting the bible or i can believe
[1:01:29] god just spoke to me
[1:01:33] and if i believe god just spoke to me
[1:01:35] i'll go home next time my wife asked me
[1:01:37] to make coffee and i'll make it
[1:01:40] happily
[1:01:42] amen now people can behold my good works
[1:01:45] and glorify god which is in heaven
[1:01:48] it's okay that you're not perfect
[1:01:51] but it is not okay to have an attitude
[1:01:53] to be that way
[1:01:56] walk in the light
[1:02:01] in this hour
[1:02:03] i say it's the darkest hour known to
[1:02:05] mankind
[1:02:06] we ought to be shining the light for
[1:02:08] jesus
[1:02:09] more than we ever have
[1:02:12] it's the greatest darkness in the world
[1:02:15] but yet the brightest light is shining
[1:02:19] but what good
[1:02:23] is your light
[1:02:24] if it's just covered by a bushel
[1:02:30] god can use you in this hour
[1:02:33] how useful is a flashlight on a sunny
[1:02:35] day
[1:02:38] you might as well turn it off and save
[1:02:40] the batteries for night time
[1:02:42] brother sister this is the hour we need
[1:02:44] to be shining amen
[1:02:46] this is the hour god wants to use our
[1:02:48] lives to help people come out of
[1:02:50] darkness
[1:02:56] when it was at the church
[1:02:58] we have a lot of exit signs because we
[1:03:00] have a lot of doors i mean i changed
[1:03:02] 15 door handles and we still probably
[1:03:04] had another eight doors in the place we
[1:03:06] got so many doors
[1:03:09] you could tell it was just added on
[1:03:10] headed on and on
[1:03:12] but one of the things that we had to fix
[1:03:13] for
[1:03:15] our
[1:03:17] uh
[1:03:18] a final approval
[1:03:20] occupancy is we had to fix our exit
[1:03:22] signs now we have the exit signs there
[1:03:25] but
[1:03:27] they have to be illuminated and when the
[1:03:28] power goes out they need to go bright
[1:03:30] brighter
[1:03:31] so you got the little buttons you check
[1:03:33] them
[1:03:35] but the roger knows all about it
[1:03:38] and there was
[1:03:39] a sign over a cross you'll see it
[1:03:42] in the sanctuary there's one exit door
[1:03:47] and when he was pushing i really
[1:03:48] couldn't see it it just didn't look very
[1:03:50] bright with the lights on
[1:03:52] i thought well we got to change it
[1:03:54] he says no it's it's working it's
[1:03:56] fine so i went and turned off the light
[1:03:59] and boy that thing was so bright
[1:04:02] just turned the light off in the room
[1:04:03] and you could see it
[1:04:05] wow
[1:04:06] so
[1:04:08] when you're in a difficult situation and
[1:04:10] people are yelling and screaming and and
[1:04:13] uh
[1:04:15] you don't have no money to pay the bills
[1:04:16] and somebody hates your guts i don't
[1:04:18] care what's going on that's the moment
[1:04:21] you should be so bright so illuminated
[1:04:24] that they see jesus and not your flesh
[1:04:26] trying to retaliate
[1:04:30] you are the light of the world
[1:04:34] in this hour we ought to be shining
[1:04:37] a bright light
[1:04:39] in every conversation
[1:04:42] in all of our behavior
[1:04:44] and all of how we handle things that's
[1:04:47] where our light needs to shine nobody
[1:04:49] needs you to be able to tell somebody
[1:04:53] this is the way it should be
[1:05:01] we all know
[1:05:03] we've all been told i had one brother
[1:05:05] tell me
[1:05:12] this
[1:05:13] brother was telling me
[1:05:15] you know you
[1:05:17] hard to say this because i don't want to
[1:05:20] just i don't want to make mention saying
[1:05:22] not that it's bad it's not a bad thing
[1:05:24] but he just you know he made mention if
[1:05:26] you ever
[1:05:27] uh want to
[1:05:30] uh find out
[1:05:33] uh
[1:05:36] that what people who are
[1:05:38] overweight need to do just ask a person
[1:05:40] who's overweight they've been told more
[1:05:41] than anybody
[1:05:44] and it makes sense because they've been
[1:05:46] told by so many people this is what you
[1:05:48] need to do to help yourself
[1:05:51] he says that's easy i can tell you what
[1:05:53] needs to be done
[1:05:55] so when we're in our battles it's easy
[1:05:57] to say this is what needs to happen
[1:05:59] right now
[1:06:00] but what is needed is a life
[1:06:03] the holy ghost power to take care of the
[1:06:06] problem
[1:06:10] and that's what we're missing church
[1:06:13] that's why we need to come to the altar
[1:06:15] and pray for the holy ghost pray for
[1:06:17] power we don't need knowledge we don't
[1:06:19] come here to get knowledge
[1:06:21] we don't want to get pumped up with
[1:06:23] knowledge
[1:06:26] holy ghost
[1:06:29] well we're groping in darkness we ought
[1:06:31] to be shining the light bright
[1:06:34] paul wanted timothy to shine so bright
[1:06:37] that he told him think about this to be
[1:06:40] an example
[1:06:42] unto believers
[1:06:43] think about that statement it's not good
[1:06:46] enough just to be a little brighter than
[1:06:48] the unbelievers that you hang around
[1:06:50] with that you work with that you
[1:06:52] associated with that your neighbor is
[1:06:54] right amen right
[1:06:56] but let your lights be so bright that
[1:06:59] you're actually an example to other
[1:07:01] believers amen that's right wow that
[1:07:05] sounds like the lord i know
[1:07:10] this is not the hour to allow satan's
[1:07:12] lukewarm spirit to get all over you
[1:07:15] but i will say this this is satan's
[1:07:18] finest hour throughout everything
[1:07:21] this is his finest hour he spent all his
[1:07:24] time since leaving heaven to become the
[1:07:27] greatest master of deceit today
[1:07:32] he has learned throughout all the ages
[1:07:33] what works best to deceive the whole
[1:07:36] world that is true
[1:07:38] and this layout to speak this laodicean
[1:07:40] spirit to me is the crown of his
[1:07:43] deception
[1:07:46] think about it the spirit
[1:07:49] give people what they want so they don't
[1:07:51] need anything
[1:07:53] what a plan
[1:07:56] give people what they want so they don't
[1:07:57] want anything
[1:08:02] slight socialism right
[1:08:07] survey taken in 2019
[1:08:11] they said socialism is spiking in the
[1:08:13] u.s
[1:08:15] more than 4 out of 10 americans believe
[1:08:17] that socialism would be good for the usa
[1:08:21] what in the world has happened
[1:08:32] but it'd be one of those subjects you
[1:08:34] know you don't want to talk to anybody
[1:08:35] about it
[1:08:37] you know what could cause some problems
[1:08:40] but see evil has no no qualms about
[1:08:43] pushing his self
[1:08:46] that's right
[1:08:48] and look we ain't changing it
[1:08:56] this country has already been prophesied
[1:08:59] it has already rejected the gospel of
[1:09:02] this message
[1:09:04] we're on borrow time
[1:09:08] it's now every man for himself yes
[1:09:15] for me in my house i'll serve the
[1:09:18] lord and as ambassador of christ
[1:09:21] i need to get the word to another soul
[1:09:25] forget about having a campaign about
[1:09:28] trying to get everybody behind me about
[1:09:30] how independent our country should be in
[1:09:32] our democracy is so great
[1:09:36] it's not coming back
[1:09:38] we're in the end time
[1:09:41] but we need to get souls say that's our
[1:09:43] job that's the light we need to be
[1:09:48] now satan
[1:09:52] has confused this world
[1:09:57] and they're going in every different
[1:09:59] direction
[1:10:04] made it hard for people to detect what's
[1:10:06] right what's wrong
[1:10:10] and this
[1:10:11] spirit in the church
[1:10:15] this need of nothing is actually
[1:10:17] confusing because you feel
[1:10:20] i'm okay
[1:10:24] and the preacher is just trying to make
[1:10:26] me feel bad
[1:10:30] when god's trying to get the light to
[1:10:32] you
[1:10:36] satan knows he has about a short time
[1:10:37] turn with me to revelations chapter four
[1:10:43] the laodicean spirit is the crown of his
[1:10:45] deception
[1:10:48] that's really good
[1:10:50] revelations chapter 12 verse 4 and his
[1:10:52] tale
[1:10:53] drew a third part of the stars of heaven
[1:10:56] and did cast them to the earth and the
[1:10:59] dragon stood before the woman which was
[1:11:01] ready to be delivered for he
[1:11:04] for to devour her as soon as it was born
[1:11:10] you all been taught what this means
[1:11:14] and she brought forth a man-child
[1:11:18] who was to rule all the nations with a
[1:11:21] rod of iron and her child was caught up
[1:11:25] unto god into his throne now that you've
[1:11:27] got the church you've got the bride that
[1:11:30] came out of the church
[1:11:33] and she's caught up in a rapture
[1:11:36] to speak to to we will
[1:11:39] rule and reign with god amen
[1:11:42] and the woman fled into the wilderness
[1:11:46] where she
[1:11:47] have a place prepared of god
[1:11:51] that they should feed her there
[1:11:54] a thousand two hundred and three score
[1:11:56] days or three and a half years
[1:11:59] and there was a war in heaven mike on
[1:12:01] his archangels fought against the dragon
[1:12:03] and the dragon fought against his angels
[1:12:06] and prevailed not neither was
[1:12:08] their place found anymore in heaven
[1:12:11] and that great dragon was cast out the
[1:12:14] old serpent called the devil and satan
[1:12:16] which deceiveth the whole
[1:12:19] world look at the power that he has
[1:12:22] the whole world not just those that
[1:12:24] don't agree with you
[1:12:28] the whole world
[1:12:31] he was cast out into the earth and the
[1:12:34] angels were cast out with him
[1:12:36] and i heard a voice saying in heaven now
[1:12:40] is come salvation and strength and the
[1:12:42] kingdom of our god the power of his
[1:12:44] christ for the accuser
[1:12:46] of the brethren is cast down which
[1:12:49] accused them before our god day and
[1:12:51] night
[1:12:51] so here's satan he goes before god
[1:12:55] and he uses you and i before god but he
[1:12:58] didn't do this and they didn't do that
[1:12:59] and look at this and look at that and
[1:13:01] he's constantly accusing me
[1:13:07] and then when he gets turned down
[1:13:11] [Music]
[1:13:13] gotta put him in his place
[1:13:16] but he's still going about his dirty
[1:13:17] work he'll come to you and i and start
[1:13:19] saying things about one another yes
[1:13:21] right
[1:13:22] accusing the truth
[1:13:24] and if we say yeah that's right he did
[1:13:26] do that she did yeah they didn't yeah
[1:13:30] you're caught in that web
[1:13:37] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:13:39] the lamb
[1:13:40] by the word of their testimony and they
[1:13:43] what
[1:13:44] they didn't care about their own life
[1:13:48] where
[1:13:48] do you stand with that
[1:13:51] where do you stand with that
[1:13:55] the only way you're going to overcome in
[1:13:57] this age is to hate
[1:13:59] your life not just today not during
[1:14:01] service not just to agree with it
[1:14:04] but until you die
[1:14:06] or to the rapture takes place
[1:14:09] because your flesh there's nothing good
[1:14:10] in that flesh and blood well not here at
[1:14:12] the kingdom of god god doesn't like it
[1:14:14] it says it's enmity with him amen that's
[1:14:17] right it gets us in trouble yes it makes
[1:14:20] us think we're something when we're not
[1:14:21] it's true amen
[1:14:23] it wants to exalt itself against the
[1:14:25] will of god
[1:14:28] therefore rejoice the heavens and ye
[1:14:30] that dwell in them woe to the habitats
[1:14:32] of the earth and the sea for the devil
[1:14:34] has come down unto you having great
[1:14:37] wrath why
[1:14:39] because he knows that he has about a
[1:14:42] short time
[1:14:46] a short time
[1:14:48] you know what is when you get somebody
[1:14:49] coming over the house or
[1:14:50] the inspector i couldn't even finish the
[1:14:53] job getting everything ready before the
[1:14:54] inspector come but i i i said i'll have
[1:14:57] it ready tomorrow
[1:14:59] so i had to get up and finish putting
[1:15:01] the door handles on i had to put the
[1:15:02] signs by the bathroom doors because i
[1:15:04] had but a short time
[1:15:09] the devil knows he has but a short time
[1:15:12] he wants to bring us down it's true
[1:15:15] and when the dragon saw that he was cast
[1:15:17] onto the earth he persecuted the woman
[1:15:19] which brought forth the man child i feel
[1:15:22] sorry for the foolish virgin
[1:15:25] who's left behind
[1:15:28] she was unwilling to suffer
[1:15:31] to lay down her life
[1:15:34] to die daily
[1:15:36] to pick up her cross and to follow
[1:15:38] christ
[1:15:40] and now she's going to have to suffer
[1:15:42] right
[1:15:43] a suffering that the bride will not have
[1:15:45] to suffer
[1:15:47] because she chose to sit in church and
[1:15:49] say lord jesus be it on to me according
[1:15:52] to your word
[1:15:53] amen
[1:15:56] mary bore the reproach we've got to bear
[1:15:58] the reproach this word is the only truth
[1:16:01] for us
[1:16:04] the devil knows he doesn't have much
[1:16:07] time left
[1:16:09] so that's why he's poured it on strong
[1:16:16] that's why we're hearing that little
[1:16:18] voice i don't need to submit to that
[1:16:22] that word isn't that important to me
[1:16:26] i don't need to be faithful to church
[1:16:27] attendance
[1:16:30] i don't really have to lay down my life
[1:16:34] god hasn't given me a burden for souls
[1:16:38] you know who's pouring that on that's
[1:16:40] satan
[1:16:42] the master of deceit speaking to our
[1:16:45] minds and we don't catch it that's right
[1:16:50] satan is pouring as loud as he has
[1:16:51] spirit on the church because he knows he
[1:16:54] has but a short time left
[1:17:00] but god is doing a short work as well
[1:17:03] matthew 24 verse 21 for then shall there
[1:17:06] be great tribulation
[1:17:08] such as was not since the beginning of
[1:17:12] the world
[1:17:14] to this time nor
[1:17:17] no nor ever shall be so we're talking
[1:17:20] about the great tribulation here that's
[1:17:22] right in front of us
[1:17:23] i think
[1:17:24] it's ushering in right now
[1:17:28] and he said except those days be what
[1:17:32] shorten
[1:17:34] none of us
[1:17:36] would be saved
[1:17:39] but for you and i
[1:17:41] just for the elect those days will be
[1:17:45] shortened
[1:17:46] amen
[1:17:48] we are blessed people today amen you
[1:17:51] know sure the word is hard
[1:17:53] sure this is not enjoyable
[1:17:55] but not take this over anything
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:01] because
[1:18:02] just because we're elect if we do not
[1:18:04] get ready we do not go
[1:18:12] look about the one that got in there
[1:18:14] what did he say and i'm so sorry about
[1:18:17] moving
[1:18:18] so sorry when we get to the other place
[1:18:20] we won't have to worry about that
[1:18:22] anymore
[1:18:24] but there was someone that got into the
[1:18:26] wedding without the garment on
[1:18:28] they made it in
[1:18:30] but he didn't have the garment on
[1:18:32] and he kicked him out
[1:18:34] that's right
[1:18:36] we need this word it dresses us up
[1:18:38] [Music]
[1:18:39] we need to rejoice
[1:18:42] there's an hour where the bride will
[1:18:43] rejoice because she have made herself
[1:18:46] ready
[1:18:51] things are going to get so bad saints
[1:18:53] that god is gonna have to shorten things
[1:18:55] up
[1:18:57] while the confusing world is saying he
[1:18:59] delayeth is coming
[1:19:01] all things remain the same as he as it
[1:19:04] was from the beginning god is actually
[1:19:06] shortening up the hour for you and i
[1:19:10] he could come at any time amen
[1:19:14] then if any man
[1:19:16] shall say unto you lo
[1:19:18] here's christ
[1:19:19] or there
[1:19:21] believe it or not
[1:19:24] for there shall
[1:19:25] arise false anointings
[1:19:29] false people proclaiming christ
[1:19:33] and shall show great signs
[1:19:36] and wonders
[1:19:37] like i mean come on how can you deny it
[1:19:41] isn't this the message
[1:19:45] if it were possible they shall deceive
[1:19:48] the very elect
[1:19:51] to me the very elect has something that
[1:19:53] nobody else has
[1:19:54] they have such an intimate relationship
[1:19:56] with god they know firsthand what's what
[1:19:59] and what isn't
[1:20:02] where everybody else has what i call
[1:20:04] presumptuous
[1:20:06] sins
[1:20:07] they're assuming because i am so great
[1:20:11] because i am so alive i cannot be
[1:20:13] deceived
[1:20:19] two different spirits one is i know
[1:20:21] nothing right now without the grace of
[1:20:23] god amen
[1:20:25] amen
[1:20:26] stay humble amen god will give you more
[1:20:29] grace
[1:20:32] he promised to
[1:20:33] it's there in his word
[1:20:36] but it's nothing to be proud of
[1:20:40] it's everything to be humble
[1:20:43] i'm unworthy lord that you would call me
[1:20:45] your lack that you would protect me from
[1:20:48] deception of this hour
[1:20:53] god isn't through with israel yet
[1:20:55] he's going to do a quick work with her
[1:20:57] romans chapter 9 verse 27.
[1:21:00] romans chapter 9 verse 27 isaiah also
[1:21:03] cries concerning israel though the
[1:21:05] number of the children of israel be as
[1:21:06] the sands of the sea
[1:21:08] a remnant shall be saved
[1:21:10] for he will finish the work
[1:21:13] and
[1:21:14] cut it
[1:21:16] short
[1:21:18] in righteousness
[1:21:21] now
[1:21:22] i'm pretty sure that
[1:21:25] brother roger has caught wire before
[1:21:29] and he's cut it short
[1:21:31] and had to cut another piece
[1:21:34] sure brother stan has cut a board before
[1:21:37] and cut it short
[1:21:39] it wasn't long enough
[1:21:43] god is going to cut this thing short for
[1:21:46] israel
[1:21:49] but he ain't going to leave it without
[1:21:51] righteousness he's going to cut it short
[1:21:53] in righteousness
[1:21:54] he's going to get the job done
[1:21:57] because a short work will the lord make
[1:22:00] upon the earth
[1:22:03] as isaiah said before except the lord of
[1:22:05] sabbath had left us seed we had been
[1:22:08] like solemn and had been
[1:22:09] like unto gomorrah
[1:22:13] god is serious about the hour
[1:22:17] we're living in amen
[1:22:19] god is serious about what he speaks to
[1:22:21] us
[1:22:22] amen we ought to be sober we ought to be
[1:22:25] vigilant
[1:22:26] we ought to be recognizing satan trying
[1:22:29] to keep us what unprepared
[1:22:32] amen just in that state of
[1:22:34] lukewarm
[1:22:37] give you all that you want instead of
[1:22:39] all that you need
[1:22:41] right
[1:22:42] now if god is doing a short work
[1:22:45] and satan is doing her short work what
[1:22:48] ought you to be doing
[1:22:53] just kind of laying loose
[1:22:56] foot loose and fancy free
[1:23:00] you got two opposing powers
[1:23:04] that are serious about your soul yes
[1:23:08] and we're gonna walk around with the
[1:23:09] carefree i'm in the bride attitude
[1:23:17] my bible says the righteous scarcely
[1:23:19] make it
[1:23:20] right
[1:23:22] if they scarcely make it where's
[1:23:24] everybody else going to be
[1:23:27] i'd rather be fulfilling working out my
[1:23:29] salvation today with fear and trembling
[1:23:38] my confidence is in him
[1:23:42] my confidence is not in me
[1:23:45] there's the difference
[1:23:48] that's presumptuous yeah
[1:23:51] right it's true don't be presumptuous
[1:23:56] this is
[1:23:57] no time to be playing church
[1:24:00] flying under the radar as it were
[1:24:03] being lazy
[1:24:04] in the work of the lord
[1:24:08] no time to be groping around in darkness
[1:24:11] no time to allow yourself to be
[1:24:13] swallowed up with just everything that's
[1:24:15] happening in the world
[1:24:18] no time to be making excuses for missing
[1:24:21] church
[1:24:23] we should be hungering for more of the
[1:24:25] light of god inside of our beings
[1:24:29] not more knowledge right
[1:24:32] now let's just puff you up
[1:24:36] but having the knowledge of christ in
[1:24:38] your heart
[1:24:43] should we be casting off the works of
[1:24:45] darkness and walking into more obedient
[1:24:48] light
[1:24:50] i want you to think about that every one
[1:24:51] of us there's things in our life look
[1:24:53] you could just be as perfect as all get
[1:24:55] out to be when you leave here but by the
[1:24:57] next time you come to church i'm sure
[1:25:00] sure of it that god's going to want to
[1:25:02] be dealing with something in your life
[1:25:07] and that thing they wants to deal with
[1:25:09] is called darkness
[1:25:14] and when he gives us light and we become
[1:25:16] obedient to the light then we're walking
[1:25:18] in the light
[1:25:22] shouldn't we be working with haste to
[1:25:24] fight this lukewarm layout is he in
[1:25:26] spirit it's true yes and i'll tell you i
[1:25:29] say it like this it's confusing when you
[1:25:31] feel like you don't need nothing
[1:25:34] because
[1:25:36] the preaching of the gospel is telling
[1:25:38] us that we need
[1:25:40] but but the spirit that speaks from the
[1:25:42] world is telling world cain we don't
[1:25:44] need to try any harder than what we're
[1:25:46] doing
[1:25:47] that to me he's he's confusing just like
[1:25:50] what
[1:25:51] what saint did to ever god made it real
[1:25:55] clear nothing but the word you're not
[1:25:57] allowed to partake of that tree in any
[1:25:59] fashion form a way
[1:26:02] amen and satan confuse it oh yes you can
[1:26:04] you'll be just like god you'll make
[1:26:06] it nobody's perfect
[1:26:11] confusing
[1:26:13] that's why it's the most deceptive hour
[1:26:16] that's right we ought to be getting
[1:26:17] ready for the rapture amen we ought to
[1:26:20] be looking for the seed
[1:26:22] amen because that's the heart of god
[1:26:27] that's the mind of god let this mind
[1:26:29] that was in christ be in you and his
[1:26:32] mind is to get the family together
[1:26:36] well he didn't tell me
[1:26:37] he's not going to tell you
[1:26:40] you get on your knees and you want it
[1:26:42] he'll tell you
[1:26:45] i remember when god called me it wasn't
[1:26:47] until i wanted it
[1:26:51] yeah he may call you
[1:26:53] from sin
[1:26:54] you weren't looking for god but after
[1:26:56] you come to christ
[1:26:59] something inside of you wants to go tell
[1:27:01] somebody right
[1:27:02] automatically you feel in debt there is
[1:27:04] just no way in the world i can have this
[1:27:07] uh being saved and this joy and
[1:27:10] happiness and not go tell somebody
[1:27:14] but what happens to a period of time
[1:27:18] becomes all about us
[1:27:20] lose that joy
[1:27:21] lose that burden
[1:27:23] and it's until you realize that this is
[1:27:26] your purpose that you need to be getting
[1:27:27] out there it's not until that time that
[1:27:29] you begin to pray and say lord lay some
[1:27:31] soul upon my heart
[1:27:33] win that soul through me lord use me
[1:27:35] today it's at that point
[1:27:37] god will lay a burden on your heart
[1:27:40] and when he does all of a sudden the
[1:27:42] labor becomes so much easier
[1:27:44] because the joy the lord becomes your
[1:27:46] strength at that point
[1:27:49] we should be hungering to walk in more
[1:27:50] light today
[1:27:53] now more light
[1:27:54] isn't necessarily
[1:27:56] new light right
[1:28:00] it's just new
[1:28:01] to you
[1:28:03] walking in it
[1:28:05] may not be new to your knowledge
[1:28:07] it may be it's just new to your
[1:28:09] obedience you haven't been obedient to
[1:28:12] it before
[1:28:15] and that just casts out all darkness
[1:28:16] jesus said as long as i'm in the world i
[1:28:19] am the light of the world
[1:28:20] and brother branham said that there's no
[1:28:22] hope for this world
[1:28:26] jesus is gone from this world
[1:28:29] but is he in your word
[1:28:33] is he in your world
[1:28:40] have you given him preeminence
[1:28:44] have you
[1:28:45] been serious with what he spoke to you
[1:28:48] or have you quickly
[1:28:51] had presumptually said i don't need to
[1:28:53] do that
[1:28:58] we've got to follow the light of the
[1:29:00] word in order to continue to be the
[1:29:03] light of the world
[1:29:07] jesus said i am the light of the world
[1:29:09] he that followeth me shall not walk in
[1:29:11] darkness but
[1:29:13] but shall have the light of life so when
[1:29:16] we come to church we come to hear about
[1:29:19] the light that we need to walk in
[1:29:23] of course we have a choice at that point
[1:29:25] to follow that light for our lives
[1:29:28] now i can't make brother mark do it
[1:29:30] brother mark can't make me do it
[1:29:33] i hope he prays for me i pray for him
[1:29:38] but i can only choose
[1:29:41] to say no to the darkness
[1:29:44] and this flesh
[1:29:47] doesn't want to do it right so it ain't
[1:29:50] just easy choice making here
[1:29:53] you know let's play roulette you know
[1:29:55] what do you want black or red
[1:29:58] no this this is hard business i have to
[1:30:00] give up my will
[1:30:03] give up the things that are pleasing to
[1:30:05] my flesh
[1:30:09] but god is serious he's doing a short
[1:30:11] work there's no time to be
[1:30:13] playing church just you know getting by
[1:30:15] with a flowery bed of ease
[1:30:18] you know how many people are going to be
[1:30:19] left behind thinking they were okay they
[1:30:22] thought they were okay
[1:30:26] short work is being done
[1:30:32] but if you go your own way you're not
[1:30:35] following the light of the word
[1:30:40] so even though we can say oh yeah i
[1:30:41] follow jesus
[1:30:43] jesus is in his word
[1:30:46] and jesus is here whether we don't think
[1:30:47] he is or not
[1:30:50] whether we feel him see him that don't
[1:30:52] matter he's here he's hearing his word
[1:30:56] and when he gives you the word
[1:31:00] when you
[1:31:01] follow that word and you just say i'm
[1:31:02] going to do it amen
[1:31:04] you're walking in the light amen
[1:31:09] you can be in your prayer closet the
[1:31:10] same thing could be happening
[1:31:13] you'd be reading the bible listening to
[1:31:14] a tape
[1:31:16] but somewhere through the midst of that
[1:31:18] god's going to be speaking you could be
[1:31:20] watching something on tv and god's
[1:31:22] saying no
[1:31:23] right it's true
[1:31:25] amen
[1:31:26] it's up to us
[1:31:28] to walk in the light
[1:31:30] turn with me the 1st john chapter 1
[1:31:32] verse 5.
[1:31:34] john expresses the attitude that we
[1:31:36] should have when we come to church
[1:31:42] this then is the message of course we
[1:31:44] should have it for our life
[1:31:46] which we've heard of him and declare
[1:31:47] unto you that god is light and in him
[1:31:51] is just a little bit of darkness
[1:31:54] but why is it okay for us to have a
[1:31:56] little bit of an attitude
[1:31:59] a little bit of i don't care a little
[1:32:01] bit it doesn't matter a little bit i'm
[1:32:03] just human you got to live with it why
[1:32:05] is that okay
[1:32:10] there's no darkness in the lord
[1:32:13] that's true
[1:32:14] with that being said we see the mind of
[1:32:16] god wanting to shine the light of his
[1:32:18] word down into every one of our lives in
[1:32:21] order to get everything out of us that's
[1:32:23] not pleasing to him
[1:32:26] because in him there's no darkness at
[1:32:28] all
[1:32:30] god
[1:32:31] works very hard
[1:32:35] getting the word to us
[1:32:37] now i'll tell you the beautiful thing we
[1:32:39] come to church and he makes us to lay
[1:32:41] down in green pastures
[1:32:43] you know we hear the word
[1:32:45] still waters he gets our attention he's
[1:32:47] trying to address us
[1:32:50] if we can learn to do this on a daily
[1:32:51] basis
[1:32:52] spend some time with him in prayer spend
[1:32:54] some time in his word just be subject to
[1:32:57] him
[1:32:58] don't have your mind already made up
[1:33:00] what you want to learn what you want to
[1:33:02] speak to you about what what what what
[1:33:04] just god i need to obey you speak to me
[1:33:09] amen verse six if we say then that we
[1:33:12] have fellowship with god
[1:33:15] and walk
[1:33:16] in darkness
[1:33:18] we lie and do not the truth what's
[1:33:20] what's what do we say about this
[1:33:23] we all got darkness are we all liars
[1:33:27] we become
[1:33:28] a liar to the truth when we refuse to
[1:33:32] walk in the light that he speaks to us
[1:33:35] it's true and say that yeah i'm a
[1:33:37] christian right i believe i'm in the
[1:33:39] message
[1:33:42] god is calling us liar it doesn't matter
[1:33:43] if your brother and sister calls you a
[1:33:44] liar that doesn't matter the word calls
[1:33:47] you a liar right amen
[1:33:50] there's a strong meat here
[1:33:52] but any darkness at all
[1:33:54] any darkness at all
[1:33:56] that's why we need the fear and
[1:33:58] trembling
[1:33:59] that's why we need to be serious of the
[1:34:02] short work that god's doing that's why
[1:34:04] we need to lord what is it that you
[1:34:06] would have me to do in this short time i
[1:34:08] only got a short time to get ready
[1:34:11] instead i fulfilled my job i went to
[1:34:13] church
[1:34:14] rest of the day's mind the rest of the
[1:34:16] week's mine
[1:34:17] where are we at brother sister
[1:34:19] yes we're in the message
[1:34:21] but it's evident where the message is in
[1:34:23] us
[1:34:24] amen
[1:34:28] how many people do we know that claim
[1:34:30] that they have fellowship with christ
[1:34:32] even though they refuse to walk in
[1:34:34] further light for their lives
[1:34:36] how many times we tried telling people
[1:34:38] about things and they don't want to
[1:34:41] receive it yet they oh
[1:34:44] i claim the light
[1:34:46] i walk with jesus
[1:34:49] see because they view jesus
[1:34:52] as someone where you don't have
[1:34:56] to walk in all the light
[1:34:58] honestly they just review
[1:35:00] god as someone that you don't need
[1:35:03] all the light
[1:35:05] like god understands
[1:35:07] god understands we're frail we're human
[1:35:10] but he doesn't
[1:35:11] he doesn't not he does not understand a
[1:35:14] lackadaisical lukewarm attitude that it
[1:35:17] doesn't matter
[1:35:18] he will never accept that
[1:35:24] verse 7 says it but if we walk in the
[1:35:26] light
[1:35:28] as he shows us the light
[1:35:30] that's right
[1:35:33] we have fellowship one with another
[1:35:38] and the blood of jesus christ can do its
[1:35:40] job
[1:35:41] and cleanse us from all sin amen
[1:35:45] brother breton made a statement he he he
[1:35:47] read one scripture he said this one
[1:35:49] verse here
[1:35:50] he said has enough to save your soul
[1:35:54] but also has enough to put you in hell
[1:35:58] it's a choice
[1:36:00] and every time we come to church
[1:36:02] i believe god is dealing with us with
[1:36:04] getting more of the darkness out amen
[1:36:06] that's right
[1:36:07] and that's what we should be focused on
[1:36:09] lord show me what you want me to do
[1:36:11] that's why we're ministering every even
[1:36:14] though
[1:36:16] man shall live by every word of god
[1:36:18] god may only be dealing with you with
[1:36:20] one certain thing
[1:36:23] it may not be the thing you were
[1:36:25] thinking about all week
[1:36:29] it may be something
[1:36:31] that he's preparing you for
[1:36:33] two weeks from now
[1:36:37] because the seed has to be planted right
[1:36:39] you got to water it
[1:36:42] you got to say yes lord be it unto me
[1:36:45] and then let it come to pass
[1:36:47] it's not always how we got it figured
[1:36:49] out
[1:36:53] this this scripture this verse 7 here
[1:36:55] has really
[1:36:57] challenged me scared me that if i don't
[1:37:00] walk in the light i can't even be
[1:37:02] cleansed by the blood
[1:37:04] that's powerful
[1:37:06] i've got to walk in the light
[1:37:09] not just
[1:37:10] oh yeah i got baptized i'm in the light
[1:37:13] i cut my hair it used to be long i'm in
[1:37:15] the like no
[1:37:18] the new light that he gives me
[1:37:22] the one the secret things that only you
[1:37:25] and him know
[1:37:28] the pastor don't know
[1:37:30] pastor don't want to know
[1:37:34] the thing that the ministers don't know
[1:37:38] it's an intimate relationship between
[1:37:39] you and god god wants it out amen get
[1:37:42] the darkness out yes
[1:37:44] and that's why you have to pay attention
[1:37:46] to what god's speaking to your heart
[1:37:50] and if we all do that if we all do that
[1:37:53] and we all say yes lord we will walk out
[1:37:55] of here
[1:37:56] cleansed by the blood walking in a
[1:37:58] greater light than we had when we first
[1:38:00] came here have more joy than when we
[1:38:02] came
[1:38:05] but we've got to function the way the
[1:38:07] church is supposed to function
[1:38:10] it's not a knowledge house
[1:38:14] it's not some place where we come and
[1:38:15] get more knowledge
[1:38:17] verse 8
[1:38:18] if we say that we have no sin
[1:38:20] that means no darkness inside of us at
[1:38:22] all
[1:38:24] we deceive ourself
[1:38:27] and the truth is not even in us but if
[1:38:30] we confess our sins
[1:38:32] he is faithful just to forgive us of our
[1:38:34] sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:38:36] unrighteousness
[1:38:38] so when the gospel
[1:38:40] is preached to us
[1:38:43] the light of the word is preached to us
[1:38:44] if we say amen to the word so be it
[1:38:47] lord change my ways forgive me of not
[1:38:51] walking in this prayer
[1:38:54] right now that means
[1:38:56] god
[1:38:58] will cleanse us of our sin as if we
[1:39:00] never done it
[1:39:03] and our new
[1:39:05] works
[1:39:06] people are going to see somebody's going
[1:39:08] to see it
[1:39:09] and they're going to glorify the god
[1:39:11] that spoke to you what to do
[1:39:14] that's awesome
[1:39:17] amen verse 10 if we say that we have not
[1:39:20] sinned
[1:39:22] we make god a liar
[1:39:24] and his word is not even in us
[1:39:30] now each one of us must separate
[1:39:33] from all of our darkness
[1:39:35] i don't know all yours you don't know
[1:39:37] all mine
[1:39:41] but you could all have all darkness out
[1:39:43] if i don't get mine out i'm not going
[1:39:51] it's my job to encourage you what god is
[1:39:54] really really trying to do in this short
[1:39:56] hour that we're living in
[1:39:59] but i still got to take care of mine
[1:40:02] you got to take care of yours
[1:40:04] we got to come together as a family
[1:40:07] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:40:11] amen ephesians chapter 5 verse 21
[1:40:14] boy is it okay if you bear with me a
[1:40:16] little bit
[1:40:22] now that we're only having one service
[1:40:23] on sundays you know
[1:40:26] ephesians chapter 5 verse 21
[1:40:28] this is a real
[1:40:30] blessing
[1:40:32] submit yourselves one to another in the
[1:40:34] fear of god
[1:40:35] wives
[1:40:37] submit yourselves onto your own husband
[1:40:39] as unto the lord for the husband is the
[1:40:41] head of the wife even as christ is the
[1:40:43] head of the church and he is the savior
[1:40:45] of the body therefore as the church is
[1:40:47] subject
[1:40:48] unto christ so let the wives be unto
[1:40:50] their own husbands and everything now as
[1:40:52] we're reading this
[1:40:54] paul
[1:40:56] and this is the mature church right the
[1:40:57] book of ephesians this is maturity this
[1:41:00] is for the elect
[1:41:01] he's not only talking about
[1:41:04] the natural husband and wife but he's
[1:41:06] talking about us the church
[1:41:08] in our bridegroom that that we have to
[1:41:11] be subject to christ
[1:41:13] that's the point i don't want to
[1:41:15] really speak anything on natural
[1:41:17] relationships yet because this is
[1:41:20] this is just so rich here
[1:41:23] husbands love your wife as christ also
[1:41:26] loved the church and gave himself so
[1:41:27] here it is christ gave himself for us
[1:41:29] and now we're supposed to be subject to
[1:41:31] him
[1:41:33] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[1:41:36] with the washing of the water
[1:41:38] by the word
[1:41:40] the word cleanses us the word gets us
[1:41:44] presentable to him
[1:41:46] that that's why it's important
[1:41:49] god's word
[1:41:50] speaking to your heart
[1:41:53] there's nothing else that matters when
[1:41:54] you go to church
[1:41:56] that god speaks to you the revelation of
[1:41:58] his word
[1:42:00] that he might present it to himself a
[1:42:02] glorious church not having any darkness
[1:42:04] in it
[1:42:06] not a spot not a wrinkle or any such
[1:42:08] thing but it should be holy and without
[1:42:10] blemish
[1:42:12] so men ought to love their wives as
[1:42:14] their own bodies
[1:42:16] he that loveth his wife loveth himself
[1:42:19] no man ever yet hated his own flesh but
[1:42:22] nourish it and cherish it
[1:42:24] even as the lord
[1:42:26] the church just think about that every
[1:42:28] time god
[1:42:29] every time you come to church god is
[1:42:31] here to give you his word
[1:42:33] he's always given up he's never left us
[1:42:36] without his word
[1:42:39] in other words he's never left us
[1:42:41] without an answer for our current
[1:42:43] problems
[1:42:47] god is not going to speak the answer to
[1:42:49] your life in another church
[1:42:55] that would make god a god of confusion
[1:42:57] and we would be going
[1:42:59] we would be going from pillar to pulse
[1:43:01] looking for something
[1:43:03] right
[1:43:04] yeah that's right
[1:43:06] no god is not like that that's why
[1:43:08] we say here or there go not right you
[1:43:11] either believe god's with you or you
[1:43:12] don't amen
[1:43:18] all right for we are members of his body
[1:43:20] and of his flesh and of his bones for
[1:43:22] his cause shall we
[1:43:24] the
[1:43:26] the people
[1:43:28] who were born in the flesh
[1:43:32] leave the carnal
[1:43:34] nature
[1:43:36] of our father and our mother
[1:43:38] and be joined
[1:43:41] to his wife and they the two shall be
[1:43:44] one flesh now he says this is a great
[1:43:46] mystery but i speak considering christ
[1:43:48] and the church
[1:43:51] so we
[1:43:53] left
[1:43:56] not only the denominations but we left
[1:43:58] the nature of darkness
[1:44:01] we left i'm going to do my own thing
[1:44:04] right
[1:44:05] and we're going to be joined unto christ
[1:44:08] in the marriage of his word
[1:44:12] this is how important it is to get
[1:44:14] married to the word amen
[1:44:17] not just the message of william brown
[1:44:21] not just the church of send the light
[1:44:23] not just a non-denominational church
[1:44:26] but we're being married to the word the
[1:44:28] word cleanses us the word washes us the
[1:44:31] word directs us is a light to our path
[1:44:34] it's the word word word that cast out
[1:44:38] all darkness that shines the light in
[1:44:40] our lives our personal lives and shows
[1:44:42] us what's going on
[1:44:44] all right no doubt my mind
[1:44:46] god
[1:44:49] speaking
[1:44:53] individually to every one of our hearts
[1:44:55] something that's going on there without
[1:44:57] it being mentioned from the prophet
[1:45:01] but he takes the word
[1:45:03] and he goes through the filter
[1:45:05] and says this is how it's applied to you
[1:45:11] and that's where that fear and trem i
[1:45:12] gotta walk out here and take care of it
[1:45:14] that's right i gotta work on this
[1:45:17] lord help us
[1:45:21] he wants us to come out of darkness
[1:45:24] ephesians chapter 4 verse 7.
[1:45:30] so separation here this i say therefore
[1:45:32] and testify in the lord that ye hencefor
[1:45:35] walk not as other
[1:45:38] gentiles walk how do they walk in the
[1:45:41] vanity of their own
[1:45:43] mind
[1:45:44] vanity vein
[1:45:46] vein vein pain
[1:45:49] this is what i got going on vain
[1:45:52] having
[1:45:54] the understanding
[1:45:56] darkened
[1:45:58] see there's darkness there being
[1:46:00] alienated from the life of god
[1:46:04] through the ignorance that's in them
[1:46:06] because of the blindness of their heart
[1:46:10] right
[1:46:11] so brother brandon said mission work is
[1:46:14] always in the world lord all things work
[1:46:16] together for the good to them that love
[1:46:17] the lord according to his purpose god is
[1:46:20] getting his family together
[1:46:23] god is interested in souls
[1:46:29] but where are we at
[1:46:32] in the manifestation of that
[1:46:35] where are we at how much time will we
[1:46:38] give god
[1:46:39] we got 24 hours a day i know we got to
[1:46:40] work i know we got to eat
[1:46:43] no we got to sleep beauty rest important
[1:46:47] what are we doing with the extra time
[1:46:50] are we walking as other gentiles walk
[1:46:53] it's not about why not talking about
[1:46:54] what church we go to
[1:46:56] it's about a walk
[1:46:58] are we walking in the vanity of our mind
[1:47:01] are we walking with the mind of christ
[1:47:04] the mind of christ is winning souls
[1:47:08] it's not for everybody else
[1:47:11] it's for you
[1:47:14] will you hear that call amen
[1:47:17] who being past feeling
[1:47:20] that means
[1:47:21] don't really care about somebody else's
[1:47:23] soul
[1:47:25] and have given themselves over to
[1:47:27] lasciviousness to work all uncleanness
[1:47:30] with what greediness i want i want i
[1:47:33] want i want
[1:47:34] what do i want so i can have need of
[1:47:36] nothing
[1:47:38] what a squirrel cage
[1:47:41] but you have not so learned christ
[1:47:47] thank god for the truth
[1:47:55] people have literally fell so in love
[1:47:57] with themselves
[1:47:59] that they have
[1:48:00] missed
[1:48:01] caring about somebody else's soul
[1:48:04] they just don't got time anymore
[1:48:07] i mean it's a busyness it's just going
[1:48:09] and going
[1:48:10] i i
[1:48:11] i think the whole world is going to
[1:48:13] surpass new york in busyness
[1:48:17] god wants us to separate from everything
[1:48:19] that's in this world
[1:48:20] second corinthians chapter 6 verse 14
[1:48:24] be not unequally yoked together with
[1:48:26] unbelievers
[1:48:28] for what fellowship have righteousness
[1:48:29] with unrighteousness and what communion
[1:48:31] have what light
[1:48:33] with darkness
[1:48:35] where the light of the world now
[1:48:37] and what concord have christ with baal
[1:48:39] what part of a believer with an infidel
[1:48:41] right
[1:48:43] he's trying to get us not to be
[1:48:45] connected
[1:48:47] with unbelief
[1:48:52] he's always trying god is always trying
[1:48:55] to separate the darkness out of our life
[1:48:58] and i think we ought to praise them for
[1:49:00] that not not feel bad and well i wish i
[1:49:02] wouldn't have to do that and that's just
[1:49:04] not what i want to hear
[1:49:07] verse 16 and what agreement have the
[1:49:09] temple of god with idols
[1:49:12] we probably all pack a few of those
[1:49:14] don't we
[1:49:16] awful quiet
[1:49:20] for ye are the temple of the living god
[1:49:22] as god has said i will dwell in them and
[1:49:24] walk in them and i will be their god and
[1:49:26] they shall be my people but what do we
[1:49:28] have to do
[1:49:30] come out from among them and be ye
[1:49:34] separate saith the lord and touch not
[1:49:37] the darkness the unclean thing
[1:49:39] and i will receive you you can see if we
[1:49:42] walk in the light as he is in the light
[1:49:44] then we have fellowship with one another
[1:49:47] in christ
[1:49:48] and the blood cleanses us
[1:49:52] i want god to receive more of me
[1:49:56] i will be a father unto you and you
[1:49:59] shall be my sons and my daughters saith
[1:50:01] the lord almighty
[1:50:03] god is looking for us to make the first
[1:50:05] move amen to come out he's give you come
[1:50:08] to church you hear the word
[1:50:10] something speaks to you down here
[1:50:12] you make the first choice i'll come out
[1:50:15] amen and then we receive a much tighter
[1:50:18] relationship with christ
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:21] the holy ghost said
[1:50:23] separate
[1:50:25] me barnabas and saul for the work unto i
[1:50:29] have called them now that's what the
[1:50:30] scripture says
[1:50:31] god is calling us to separate for a work
[1:50:35] for him amen there's a reason
[1:50:40] god gives us light
[1:50:41] amen
[1:50:43] it's not for ourselves i'm sorry it's
[1:50:45] not just for your home
[1:50:48] put it in the house top shine it
[1:50:50] wherever you go people need to see your
[1:50:52] works
[1:50:53] they need to see that god is alive today
[1:50:57] ephesians chapter one
[1:51:00] we're winding down
[1:51:02] ephesians chapter five i'm sorry verse
[1:51:03] one ephesians chapter five verse one
[1:51:06] be therefore followers of god is dear
[1:51:08] children and walk in love
[1:51:12] as christ also have loved us and given
[1:51:15] himself for us an offering and a
[1:51:17] sacrifice to god for his
[1:51:19] sweet smelling
[1:51:21] savor isn't that beautiful
[1:51:25] all right let verse six let no man
[1:51:26] deceive you with vain words for because
[1:51:29] of
[1:51:30] these things the wrath of god cometh on
[1:51:32] what the children who refuse to walk in
[1:51:34] the light
[1:51:35] the children who refuse to walk in the
[1:51:37] light
[1:51:38] be not ye therefore partakers with them
[1:51:41] so there are going to be some that say
[1:51:43] you know what
[1:51:44] i don't need it
[1:51:46] don't be partakers with them make a
[1:51:48] choice where you're going to stand
[1:51:51] for ye were sometimes darkness
[1:51:54] but now are you children
[1:51:58] but i'm sorry but now are ye light in
[1:52:01] the lord walk as children of light it's
[1:52:04] a choice that we make
[1:52:06] i got a a quote here i wanted to read
[1:52:10] brother branham said in buzz uh
[1:52:13] in in talking about david henry's
[1:52:15] prophecy it's not showing where it's at
[1:52:17] right now but he spoke about a few
[1:52:19] different places he says because thou
[1:52:21] has
[1:52:22] chosen
[1:52:24] the narrow path the heart away
[1:52:26] that was walked to thine own choosing
[1:52:28] that was pick the correct and precise
[1:52:30] decision
[1:52:31] and this is my way because of this
[1:52:34] momentous decision a huge portion
[1:52:37] of heaven awaits you not because your
[1:52:39] bride
[1:52:41] not because you're the messenger
[1:52:43] but because you chose
[1:52:46] to walk in the light of the word
[1:52:50] what a glorious decision thou has made
[1:52:52] this is that which will give and may
[1:52:54] come to pass
[1:52:56] the tremendous
[1:52:58] victory
[1:52:59] in the love
[1:53:01] divine amen
[1:53:03] the pinnacle is love that's right it is
[1:53:06] right we all agree in love and i'll tell
[1:53:08] you i want to be loved by brother mark
[1:53:13] i don't want to be hit by the mark
[1:53:17] i don't want to be talked
[1:53:19] behind my back
[1:53:26] but that's not the victory that god
[1:53:28] wants to give us
[1:53:32] god wants to give us a victory that no
[1:53:34] matter if i get hit if i get talked
[1:53:37] behind my back
[1:53:38] i can
[1:53:47] where are we in that journey today
[1:53:50] because he's doing a short work
[1:53:52] he's not waiting around for us to say
[1:53:53] you know what i think i'd like to try
[1:53:55] that
[1:54:00] let's continue reading
[1:54:07] for ye were sometimes darkness but now
[1:54:09] you're
[1:54:10] light in the lord walk as children of
[1:54:12] light for the fruit of the spirit is in
[1:54:14] all goodness and righteousness and truth
[1:54:17] proving what is acceptable unto the lord
[1:54:20] and have no fellowship with the
[1:54:22] unfruitful works of darkness but rather
[1:54:26] reprove them do something about it
[1:54:29] for it is a shame to even speak of those
[1:54:31] things which are done in secret
[1:54:33] but all those things but all things that
[1:54:37] are reproved are made manifest by the
[1:54:40] light for whatsoever does make manifest
[1:54:43] is light and i'm so grateful honestly to
[1:54:45] this day
[1:54:46] i don't care what sin i've done
[1:54:49] i'm so grateful for the light that has
[1:54:51] helped me to get out
[1:54:53] amen
[1:54:55] if it wasn't for the light
[1:54:57] of the truth of the gospel i would still
[1:54:59] be in it
[1:55:01] right
[1:55:02] and today i feel in debt to god amen
[1:55:10] wherefore he saith awake
[1:55:13] you that sleep
[1:55:15] god's doing or quit work
[1:55:18] and arise from the dead and christ shall
[1:55:20] give thee light
[1:55:22] amen
[1:55:23] see then that you walk
[1:55:26] circumspectly
[1:55:27] diligently
[1:55:29] completely perfectly not as fools
[1:55:33] but as wise amen redeeming the time
[1:55:37] because the days are evil
[1:55:40] wherefore be not unwise but
[1:55:43] understanding what the will of the lord
[1:55:44] is
[1:55:45] god is doing a short work we only got a
[1:55:48] little time to get ready and we only got
[1:55:50] a little time to win as many souls as
[1:55:52] possible
[1:55:55] were you going to be on that day when
[1:55:56] god asked for to give you
[1:55:59] ask for you an account
[1:56:01] how did you use your time
[1:56:05] amen did you walk
[1:56:08] as are the gentiles
[1:56:12] did you compare yourself with other
[1:56:14] believers in the message
[1:56:18] well i was better than them
[1:56:21] well look i don't care how good or how
[1:56:22] bad they are what i do care about is
[1:56:24] what god's called you to be
[1:56:27] god's calling you to walk circumspectly
[1:56:29] to redeem the time
[1:56:31] the days
[1:56:33] are short
[1:56:37] we need to walk in the light of the 22nd
[1:56:40] century
[1:56:42] god's given us a greater light today
[1:56:45] than last century
[1:56:47] we need to walk in the light as god
[1:56:50] reveals the light to us when we come to
[1:56:52] church we just say amen so be it and
[1:56:54] really mean it from our heart
[1:56:57] we don't want a plastic amen
[1:56:59] well i just say amen but not really mean
[1:57:02] it but that you're connected in the
[1:57:04] spirit of the word amen amen
[1:57:09] for ye were sometimes in darkness but
[1:57:11] now are ye the light of the lord walk as
[1:57:14] children of light and have no fellowship
[1:57:17] with the unfruitful works of darkness
[1:57:19] but rather reprove them amen brother
[1:57:22] branham said the world
[1:57:24] glitters
[1:57:26] but the gospel glows
[1:57:31] man-made love is just a glitter
[1:57:34] just get your attention for a moment
[1:57:36] but love the love of god the real
[1:57:40] love of god in a human will be there
[1:57:44] when there's nobody looking
[1:57:46] that's true
[1:57:50] you i'll tell you today do you have to
[1:57:52] worry about what god says
[1:57:54] behind your back
[1:57:57] we know the thoughts he thinks towards
[1:57:59] us
[1:58:00] that's right
[1:58:02] and when we're filled and sealed with
[1:58:04] the love of god
[1:58:06] nobody has to wonder what we're going to
[1:58:08] say about them
[1:58:11] because god is the same yesterday today
[1:58:12] and forever
[1:58:14] romans chapter 13 verse 10 we're coming
[1:58:16] down to a close
[1:58:18] can you say amen to that
[1:58:24] all right i got you on recording on that
[1:58:26] one
[1:58:29] romans chapter 13 verse 10
[1:58:32] love worketh no ill to his neighbor
[1:58:35] now we're talking about walking
[1:58:36] circumspectly therefore
[1:58:39] love is the fulfilling of the law and
[1:58:42] that
[1:58:43] knowing the time
[1:58:44] that now is high time to wake out of our
[1:58:48] sleep
[1:58:50] for now is our salvation nearer than
[1:58:54] when we first believed
[1:58:56] the night is first met the day is at
[1:58:57] hand let us therefore cast off the works
[1:58:59] of darkness and let us put on the armor
[1:59:01] of light notice god has given us grace
[1:59:04] to do this he's given us time
[1:59:10] i'm so thankful for that
[1:59:13] so thankful for that
[1:59:16] let us walk honestly as in the day not
[1:59:18] rhyming and drunk it does nothing
[1:59:19] chambered in wantingness
[1:59:22] not in his strife and envy but put ye on
[1:59:24] the lord jesus christ and make not
[1:59:26] provision
[1:59:28] shelter
[1:59:29] comfort hide behind god's word for your
[1:59:32] flesh
[1:59:34] to fulfill the lust thereof
[1:59:36] you know you can become so religious
[1:59:38] that you use the word for you right it's
[1:59:41] true
[1:59:52] which one
[1:59:53] he didn't give jesus
[1:59:55] the desire
[2:00:03] you gotta run out prayer till you say
[2:00:05] not my will but thy will be done
[2:00:12] we need to awake out of our sleep arise
[2:00:15] from laodicea
[2:00:18] all right verse 15. see then that you
[2:00:20] walk circumspectly
[2:00:24] not as fools
[2:00:27] but as wise redeeming the time because
[2:00:31] the days
[2:00:33] are evil
[2:00:35] be
[2:00:38] not unwise but understanding
[2:00:40] what the will of the lord is what is the
[2:00:43] will of the lord for your life today in
[2:00:45] the 22nd century
[2:00:51] god is wanting us to walk in the light
[2:00:55] of his word
[2:00:57] to walk with purpose
[2:00:59] when you see when you walk into a store
[2:01:03] and you see somebody that has a tag on
[2:01:08] you know they work at the store
[2:01:10] and they're just like
[2:01:14] yeah
[2:01:15] yeah
[2:01:17] hey joe what's going on
[2:01:20] just no purpose
[2:01:23] you see somebody got a name today
[2:01:25] they're walking around their shares
[2:01:26] about they're going or they're doing
[2:01:27] this they're going to their next job
[2:01:30] god is doing a short work satan knows
[2:01:32] he's only got a short time well what are
[2:01:33] we doing
[2:01:35] all right
[2:01:36] are we serious about getting ready
[2:01:39] are we serious about getting a soul in
[2:01:44] or have we had enough of church for
[2:01:45] today
[2:01:48] where's your heart i see your words i
[2:01:51] hear your words
[2:01:53] but where's your heart
[2:01:57] will you let god
[2:01:59] take it today will you let him
[2:02:02] take control and have the preeminence in
[2:02:04] you
[2:02:04] he wants to do something
[2:02:06] in every one of us
[2:02:08] but we have to literally
[2:02:11] i know we've subjected ourselves to sit
[2:02:13] here in church
[2:02:15] that's beautiful and that's wonderful
[2:02:16] and i
[2:02:18] i'm thankful to god for that
[2:02:21] but we got to give god her heart amen
[2:02:24] we've got to let him take us from when
[2:02:26] we leave here
[2:02:27] to start working on the things that he
[2:02:29] wants
[2:02:30] whatever it is
[2:02:32] you don't need to tell me
[2:02:34] you don't need to tell your brother you
[2:02:36] don't need to tell your sister no but
[2:02:38] you do need to do it with god
[2:02:40] amen amen

[2:02:44] you if ann could show that i just don't
[2:02:46] have time to go over everything there's
[2:02:48] one more quote brother brian says
[2:02:49] whatever you do
[2:02:51] lay aside everything else till you get
[2:02:53] perfect love now we're running out of
[2:02:55] time amen

[2:03:00] and we've got to get perfect love
[2:03:03] get to where you can love everybody even
[2:03:05] your enemy
[2:03:07] no matter if the plane is crashing or
[2:03:09] rocking the light is lightning is
[2:03:10] flashing or the guns of the enemy
[2:03:14] are upon you
[2:03:16] so
[2:03:19] these things do not
[2:03:21] matter
