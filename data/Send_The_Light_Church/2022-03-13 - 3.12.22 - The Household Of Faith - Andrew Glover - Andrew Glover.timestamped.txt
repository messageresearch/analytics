[35:29] believers says
[35:31] amen and amen god bless you this scene
[35:33] and if you have your bibles we'll turn
[35:35] to the book of galatians
[35:36] the sixth chapter the book of galatians
[35:39] the sixth chapter i want to look in the
[35:40] tenth verse
[35:42] and then also we'll turn to the book of
[35:43] ephesians the second chapter
[35:45] galatians 2 or rather galatians 6
[35:48] and we want to look in the 10th verse
[35:51] amen you love the lord this evening
[35:53] amen god bless you brother dan good to
[35:55] see you amen amen galatians 6 and verse
[35:59] number 10.
[36:00] here paul writing says
[36:02] as we have therefore opportunity
[36:05] let us do good unto all men
[36:08] especially unto them
[36:10] who are of the household of faith
[36:13] amen let us do good unto all men
[36:16] especially unto them
[36:18] who are of the household
[36:20] of faith if we could look in the book of
[36:22] ephesians the second chapter
[36:24] ephesians the second chapter and in the
[36:27] 19th verse
[36:28] paul here writing to the church at
[36:30] ephesus
[36:31] in the 19th verse he says now therefore
[36:34] ye are no more strangers
[36:36] and foreigners
[36:37] but fellow citizens with the saints and
[36:40] of the household of god so galatians 6
[36:43] he says of the household of faith here
[36:44] he identifies us as of the household of
[36:47] god and are built upon the foundation of
[36:50] the apostles
[36:51] and prophets
[36:53] jesus christ himself being the chief
[36:55] cornerstone
[36:56] in whom all the building fitly framed
[36:58] together groweth unto a holy temple in
[37:01] the lord
[37:02] now in whom ye also are build it
[37:04] together notice what you build it
[37:06] together for and habitation of god
[37:10] through the spirit amen we ask the lord
[37:12] this evening as you have the blessing to
[37:13] the reading of his word as you can be
[37:15] seated here this afternoon from those
[37:17] scriptures for just a few moments i want
[37:19] to
[37:20] by the help of the lord to speak tonight
[37:22] if i entitle this thought i want to
[37:23] speak to you on the household of faith
[37:26] amen the household of faith i wonder
[37:29] tonight how many uh recognizes that we
[37:31] are of the household of faith i find it
[37:34] amazing that we're living in the day and
[37:36] time when you'll uh just have to realize
[37:39] that there is an attack against the
[37:41] church of the living god the devil's
[37:43] doing everything he can attacking on
[37:45] every hand that he can against the
[37:47] church of the living god and we know
[37:48] what his attack is on his attack is not
[37:51] on our buildings it's not on our groups
[37:53] or anything his attack is on our faith
[37:56] the devil is doing everything he can to
[37:58] attack our faith now i find it amazing
[38:00] that satan has desires as well as god
[38:02] has desires and you will realize that
[38:04] one thing satan desires for the church
[38:07] is he desires the church to forget amen
[38:10] and to fear think about that the devil
[38:12] desires the church to forget and to fear
[38:15] amen but god desires the church to
[38:17] remember and believe the devil desires
[38:19] the church to forget and fear but god is
[38:22] desiring the church to remember and
[38:24] believe now i find it a powerful quote
[38:26] brother brahman says in letting off the
[38:28] pressure he said oh how satan would
[38:30] desire to take us quickly from the scene
[38:33] right in the midst of the battle so the
[38:35] devil amen is not desiring to take you
[38:37] out before the battle so much or even
[38:39] after the battle amen but if he can get
[38:41] you called in the middle of the battle
[38:43] and begin to forget who you are forget
[38:46] begin to forget what you believe then
[38:47] the devil can take you out now if you
[38:49] study much you'll realize that science
[38:51] actually has proven that there is a
[38:53] connection between fear and memory loss
[38:55] there's a connection between him when
[38:57] someone becomes stressful or anxiety
[38:59] amen fear or depression can cause
[39:02] forgetfulness think about that stress
[39:04] anxiety depression nervousness can cause
[39:07] forgetfulness it can cause confusion and
[39:10] difficulty concentrating on other
[39:12] problems that disrupt daily activities
[39:15] if the devil can get you to forget then
[39:17] you'll become amen confused if he can
[39:19] get you to forget then you'll have a
[39:21] difficulty on concentrating on the
[39:24] things that you should be looking at i
[39:25] know it's a it's a very a well-known
[39:27] point around the message that the
[39:28] prophet would tell us amen that we are
[39:31] living in a neurotic age we're living in
[39:33] an age of neurotic amen where people
[39:36] don't know what to do because they don't
[39:37] know where they're going amen they don't
[39:39] know what to do because they don't know
[39:41] where they're going if they knew where
[39:42] they were going then they would know
[39:43] what to do he said the doctors don't
[39:45] have an answer for it they mean the
[39:47] psychiatrist is being doctored by the
[39:49] psychiatrist and they don't have an
[39:51] answer now you may wonder why would
[39:53] satan want the children of god amen to
[39:55] forget and fear well the prophet says it
[39:57] like this who has the most power before
[40:00] god he said what is an angel an angel is
[40:02] a servant amen there is servants but
[40:04] what are you you are his sons and
[40:06] daughters see amen who has the most
[40:09] power in heaven then he meant a sinner
[40:11] that's been saved by grace or an
[40:13] archangel that is standing by his right
[40:16] side he said the sinner that's been
[40:18] saved by grace has more authority in
[40:20] heaven than the archangel that is
[40:22] standing by his side without sin amen
[40:24] because he is a son and who has more
[40:26] authority a servant or a son amen seek
[40:29] oh we forget amen what we are listen
[40:32] this we forget what we are we forget
[40:35] many times what made us what we are and
[40:37] after we become what we are then we
[40:39] forget where we got there amen think
[40:41] about that we forget what we are we
[40:43] forget many times what made us what we
[40:45] are and after we become what we are then
[40:48] we forget how we got here amen but i
[40:50] want tonight by the help of the lord to
[40:52] remind you amen that we are not sinners
[40:55] we are christians amen we are not
[40:57] fearful people we are believers tonight
[40:59] we we have not come here to come under
[41:01] the oppression of satan we have not come
[41:03] here to come under the ideas of satan
[41:05] that will cause us to forget who we are
[41:08] amen but we are here to remember who we
[41:09] are there's a reason why amen that satan
[41:12] wants us to forget amen and fear because
[41:15] the prophet said faith is he meant a law
[41:18] of god the devil wants the church to
[41:20] forget their faith i want you to
[41:21] remember that the devil wants the church
[41:23] to forget their faith and the reason he
[41:25] wants the church to forget their faith
[41:27] is because all the power of god that
[41:29] we're talking about is accessible to us
[41:32] by faith
[41:34] all the power of god is accessible to
[41:37] the church by the faith of god amen then
[41:40] the key is faith to the power of god so
[41:43] what does the devil want us to do he
[41:44] wants us to forget amen how to access
[41:47] the power of god all things are possible
[41:50] say to this mountain be moved and don't
[41:52] doubt in your heart and believe what you
[41:54] said should come to pass and you can
[41:55] have it it is accessible to you amen if
[41:58] you've got the law the law is the faith
[42:01] that controls all things amen then
[42:03] satan's greatest fear here tonight is
[42:06] that the church of the living god would
[42:08] access the faith of god amen and that
[42:10] would produce another book of acts
[42:12] church because christ in the true church
[42:14] is a continuation of the book of acts
[42:17] amen but the book of revelation shows
[42:19] can i lay a foundation if that's okay
[42:20] how the antichrist would come in the
[42:22] church it would defile it making it
[42:24] lukewarm and formal and powerless it
[42:26] exposes satan revealing his works the
[42:29] attempted destruction of god's people
[42:31] the discrediting of god's word right
[42:33] down to the time that he is cast into
[42:35] the lake of fire he fights that he
[42:37] cannot stand it because he knows that if
[42:40] the people get the true revelation of
[42:42] the true church and what she is and what
[42:45] she stands for amen then she can do the
[42:48] greater work she will be an invincible
[42:51] army amen i want you to catch what he
[42:52] said if she gets the revelation of who
[42:55] she is and notice what he said what she
[42:57] stands for he didn't just point out what
[42:59] she stands against and i know we stand
[43:01] against many things amen but i want to
[43:03] remind you tonight we don't just stand
[43:05] against things amen we stand for things
[43:08] we stand and can't see him we stand
[43:10] against ungodliness we stand against
[43:12] perversion we stand against the things
[43:14] of the world amen but at the same time
[43:16] we're standing against things amen we're
[43:18] standing for things amen we stand for
[43:21] jesus christ we stand for the holy ghost
[43:24] we stand for the power of god we stand
[43:26] for the supernatural we stand for
[43:28] miracles we stand for signs we stand for
[43:31] wonders listen friends we're not just a
[43:33] bunch of people it's making us stand
[43:35] against something we are the sons and
[43:37] daughters of god that has been called in
[43:39] this last stage amen the world has bowed
[43:41] on their knee to every demon out of hell
[43:44] every spirit of perversion every spirit
[43:46] of confusion denomination bowed their
[43:48] knee to every antichrist spirit but
[43:50] there is a bride in the last day who
[43:52] will not bow her knee to one devil but
[43:54] she will take a stand upon the same rock
[43:57] amen that moses stood upon she'll stand
[43:59] up on that rock and what is that rock
[44:01] it's the rock of revelation and if you
[44:03] take a stand upon the rock of revelation
[44:06] amen the gates of hell will come against
[44:08] the church but they will not prevail
[44:09] over the church because greater is he
[44:12] that is in you
[44:13] i feel like preaching greater is he that
[44:15] is in you than he that is in the world
[44:18] amen by a revelation my we don't just
[44:21] stand against things we stand for things
[44:23] and by what we stand for we receive a
[44:26] true revelation of the two spirits
[44:28] within the framework of the christian
[44:29] church and by god's spirit amen we
[44:32] discern and withstand the antichrist
[44:34] spear and satan will be powerless before
[44:37] her if you remember who you are amen by
[44:41] the revelation of the word satan will be
[44:43] powerless before the church he will be
[44:45] as definitely thwarted today amen as he
[44:48] was when christ was stood his every
[44:50] effort amen to gain power over him in
[44:53] the desert satan hates revelation but we
[44:56] love it amen satan hates revelation but
[44:59] we love it see so satan remembers amen
[45:02] what happens when the church
[45:04] accesses the power of god do you realize
[45:06] it's off of the bible but can i give you
[45:08] one example tonight it's in the book of
[45:10] luke the 10th chapter amen the 17th
[45:12] verse the 70 returned again with joy
[45:15] saying lord even the devils are subject
[45:17] unto us through thy name and he said
[45:19] unto them i beheld satan as lightning
[45:22] fall from heaven and then he turns
[45:24] brother john and says behold i give you
[45:25] power amen to tread upon serpents and
[45:28] upon scorpions and over all the power of
[45:30] the enemy and nothing shall by any means
[45:32] hurt you he said see this was
[45:34] immediately after jesus had given his
[45:37] disciples power against unclean spirits
[45:39] and they went out casting out devils
[45:42] and they sent him two by two he said
[45:45] don't go to the gentiles but go rather
[45:46] to the lost sheep of israel and as you
[45:48] go preach the kingdom of heaven amen
[45:51] heal the sick cast out the devils well
[45:53] then they come back rejoice and come
[45:54] back happily rejoicing amen and he says
[45:57] rejoice not amen the devil is subject
[45:59] unto you amen but rejoice because your
[46:02] name is written in heaven can you
[46:03] imagine them disciples coming back to
[46:05] jesus man they're on fire they just cast
[46:08] out devils they just laid hands on sick
[46:10] folks and then they've seen demons leave
[46:12] people amen they seen a mighty move of
[46:14] god and god said don't rejoice amen
[46:17] because you've seen the devil subject
[46:18] unto you amen but rejoice because your
[46:21] name amen is written in heaven amen and
[46:23] god would send a prophet in the last
[46:25] days amen to tell us how our name is
[46:27] recorded in heaven he would say in the
[46:29] blood of jesus christ he recorded your
[46:32] name in the lamb's book of life well
[46:34] what can wash away my sin amen nothing
[46:37] but the blood of jesus do you realize
[46:39] the same blood amen that can wash away
[46:41] your sin is the same blood that shields
[46:43] your name in the lamb's book of life
[46:45] from before the foundation of the world
[46:48] and there ain't enough devils past
[46:49] present or future amen to cause the
[46:51] church to forgive we've got more than
[46:54] representation on earth we've got
[46:56] representation in heaven we've got
[46:58] representation in the mind of god before
[47:00] you was a sinner you was a son of god
[47:03] before you was a town or you was a
[47:04] synagogue because there was a gene seed
[47:07] in you by the predestination of almighty
[47:09] god don't rejoice because devils are
[47:11] subject amen rejoice because your name
[47:14] is written in the lamb's book of life
[47:16] amen it amazes me brother that jesus
[47:18] would turn and say i beheld satan as
[47:21] lightning fall from heaven he said see
[47:23] the power of that church moving forward
[47:26] had just upset the whole kingdom of hell
[47:29] the power of god in the church upset the
[47:32] whole kingdom of hell he said see he saw
[47:35] him drop from his place because god had
[47:38] given them power amen to his church to
[47:40] go on amen can you imagine before the
[47:42] disciples got back to jesus and said
[47:44] lord we got all the devils cast out he
[47:47] said you're not telling me nothing i
[47:48] don't know amen i saw him fall as you
[47:50] was casting them out amen before you
[47:52] come and told me what you've done amen i
[47:54] saw it as the all-knowing god i saw what
[47:57] was happening amen but listen he was
[47:59] cast from out of the holy place he said
[48:01] by what by the power of the church amen
[48:04] by the power of the church of them
[48:06] having power amen he was cast out he
[48:09] said and they really upset the kingdom
[48:11] of satan he says what could we do with
[48:14] it today oh my amen amen i'll just be
[48:16] honest with you can i just preach for a
[48:18] minute amen i'm a little bit sick and
[48:20] tired of being told what we cannot do
[48:22] i'm ready somebody tell us what we can
[48:24] do amen we've been told we can't pray
[48:26] and we can't believe and we can't sound
[48:27] and we can't rejoice and we can't cast
[48:29] out devils amen but somebody stand up on
[48:32] the promise of god's word and remember
[48:34] god has called us ain't meant to be more
[48:36] than just church members he's called us
[48:38] to be more than just you sinners he said
[48:41] you are a city amen that is set on a
[48:43] hillside amen that lighteth up the world
[48:46] come on church we not come here to pack
[48:48] up in the corner and bury this message
[48:50] under some tradition we are here to let
[48:52] a lost and dying world know that the
[48:54] same power that was in the bible has
[48:56] returned to the church by the baptism of
[48:58] the holy ghost
[49:01] this ain't a powerless church this ain't
[49:03] a confused church this is the church of
[49:05] the living god and the same power that
[49:07] was in jesus amen is in the church

[49:12] christ and all that christ was he poured
[49:15] into the church he has no hands but your
[49:18] hands he has no feet but your feet he
[49:20] has no arms but your arms but he has
[49:23] supplied the power to bring the promise
[49:25] to pass in the age you're living in oh
[49:28] if they could tear satan's kingdom up
[49:30] with the power of god in their day what

[49:34] god today and then i'll say it to you

[49:38] much afraid of just the preachers
[49:40] getting a hold of the power of god amen
[49:42] he don't just fear your pastor or
[49:44] brother bill or brother dan or any other
[49:45] minister amen getting hold of the power
[49:47] of god he does not want the laity ain't
[49:50] meant to get a hold of that same power
[49:51] he does not want the weakest christian
[49:53] in the church ain't meant to get a hold
[49:55] of that power amen because i'll show you
[49:57] what happened when they got a hold of it
[49:58] are you ready amen in the book of luke
[50:00] the 24th chapter jesus said tarry
[50:03] in the city of jerusalem until you be
[50:05] endued with power from old high in the
[50:08] book of acts the first chapter he said
[50:10] ye shall receive power in the book of
[50:12] acts the second chapter amen you know
[50:14] what happened the power came in acts the
[50:17] third chapter amen there were two
[50:18] ignorant and unlearned preachers amen
[50:21] that received the power that was
[50:22] prophesied by jesus they received it
[50:25] amen and they said amen unto a man who
[50:28] was sitting by the gate amen two
[50:30] preachers have just received amen the
[50:32] fulfillment of the promise of the father
[50:34] amen they've just received the power and
[50:36] here sets a man by the gate in a
[50:39] terrible condition i've always said it
[50:40] like this it was an ugly problem at a
[50:42] beautiful place
[50:44] he was sitting by the gate called
[50:46] beautiful he'd been crippled for many
[50:48] years it was an ugly problem was there
[50:50] any power to change the situation amen
[50:52] well then two preachers had received the
[50:55] power to change the situation and they
[50:57] walked by him and he was asking arms and
[51:00] they didn't have no arms to give him but
[51:02] they did say such as i have give i thee
[51:05] amen in the name of jesus christ of
[51:07] nazareth rise up and walk
[51:10] and he took him by his right hand and he
[51:12] lifted him up and immediately his feet
[51:15] and ankle bones received strength and he
[51:17] leaping up stood and walked and entered
[51:19] with him in the temple amen walking and
[51:21] leaping and praising god and all the
[51:24] people saw they met him walking and
[51:26] praising god and they knew that it was
[51:28] he which sat at the gate he meant of the
[51:30] temple and they were filled with wonder
[51:32] and amazement at which it happened unto
[51:34] him the prophet said see what happened
[51:36] was right off they went amen just as
[51:39] hard as they could go preaching the
[51:41] gospel amen my the devil said well now
[51:43] they're just out there preaching so it
[51:45] won't be no it won't it won't hurt
[51:47] nothing amen let peter and john go
[51:49] preach all over the place it won't hurt
[51:51] nothing amen all the people preaching
[51:53] everything but they pastor the gate
[51:55] called beautiful amen and the holy ghost
[51:57] said peter i perceive that man has faith
[51:59] to be healed he said you know what amen
[52:02] when that man jumped up and began to
[52:04] praise god amen that caused more trouble
[52:06] than all the preaching they ever did
[52:08] amen batman getting up out of that
[52:10] condition amen caused hell more trouble
[52:13] than ever sermon peter ever preached you
[52:15] know why because the word has now moved
[52:18] amen from being word to be an action it
[52:20] is now moved from just being the ideas
[52:22] of some man amen to be in a reality oh i
[52:25] would tonight that that same power that
[52:27] failed by the gate caught beautiful
[52:29] would fall in this church tonight and no
[52:31] matter what condition you're sitting in
[52:33] no matter what spirit you're under no
[52:35] matter what demon has pledged your life
[52:37] for sicknesses claims your body there is
[52:39] a word here there is a power to change
[52:41] the situation in the face of every devil
[52:44] oh come on friends this power is not
[52:46] dead this power is here in the building
[52:48] tonight amen you know what that caused
[52:50] more trouble oh brother you just let
[52:52] something on the phenomenal side start
[52:55] and watch every rogue in hell amen go to
[52:58] hollering and craving his blood
[53:01] i'll tell you this he said peter
[53:03] preached a sermon on the day of
[53:04] pentecost three thousand souls were
[53:06] saved and the devil never moved out of
[53:08] his bed
[53:10] think about that peter preached a sermon
[53:12] on the day of pentecost 3 000 this is
[53:13] brother man's words amen and the devil
[53:16] never moved out of his bed oh well let
[53:17] them alone see but he passed the gate
[53:20] called beautiful he said see amen i
[53:22] might fill them around with a little
[53:24] theology amen once in a while but i sure
[53:26] can't fool the real thing
[53:29] oh my amen i can fool him around with a
[53:31] little theology but i really can't fool
[53:33] the real thing so in other words he
[53:35] could change their ideas of what they
[53:37] was hearing as long as it was coming
[53:39] forth in word form but when they saw
[53:41] what he was preaching about coming to
[53:42] action it had now moved from a sermon to
[53:45] a reality and he said i cannot fool you
[53:47] know why i couldn't fool the real thing
[53:49] amen because it was a witness now it was
[53:52] more than a head knowledge it was more
[53:54] than an education it was more than a
[53:56] religious understanding it had now come
[53:58] down in the form of power amen and
[54:00] demonstration oh
[54:03] glory to god it's the truth anyhow come
[54:05] on friends we've not received a dead
[54:07] letter we've received the power to make
[54:09] the world live in the age we're living
[54:11] in
[54:12] oh i'll tell you this much he said i'll
[54:14] just stop this before it gets another
[54:16] group on the scene he never stopped at
[54:18] the end and he cannot stop it now
[54:21] he never stopped to thin and he cannot
[54:24] stop it now that's right amen god's
[54:26] gospel will move on and on and on and
[54:28] when there's no more heaven and there's
[54:30] no more earth that word will still
[54:32] remain the same amen all things that
[54:35] jesus was he is now how many believes
[54:38] that all things jesus was he is now and
[54:41] always will be
[54:43] what he was then he is now and he always
[54:46] will be he's the same yesterday today
[54:49] and forever and the same holy ghost that
[54:52] fell on the day of pentecost is the same
[54:55] holy ghost that is falling today oh i'll
[54:57] admit it's been tramped on it's been
[54:59] made fun of it's been misrepresented
[55:02] it's been misinterpreted amen that's
[55:04] only the devil counterfeiting because
[55:06] there's a real genuine baptism of the
[55:09] holy spirit that brings the same results
[55:12] today that it did on the day of
[55:14] pentecost then we don't need to tweak
[55:16] the holy ghost to fit the situation we
[55:18] need to let the holy ghost have the
[55:20] right of way in the church i'll tell you
[55:22] what i believe i still believe the holy
[55:23] ghost can fix a marriage i still believe
[55:25] the holy ghost can fix a family i still
[55:27] believe the holy ghost can fix a church
[55:29] i still believe the holy ghost can set a
[55:31] young person free i still believe in the
[55:33] power of the holy ghost because what he
[55:36] was he is and what he is he always will
[55:38] be and there's not enough devils in hell
[55:41] ain't meant to stop him from being who
[55:42] he is
[55:44] well we might as well go ahead and meet
[55:46] on good terms this is who i am i believe
[55:49] in the holy ghost i believe in the
[55:51] message of the hour i believe in the
[55:53] preeminence of jesus christ i believe
[55:55] supreme deity has returned to the church
[55:58] to lead us out of the confusion of
[55:59] laodicea into the rapture of jesus
[56:02] christ that'll change her bodies what he
[56:04] was then he still is now if he ever
[56:07] saved before he can still save now if he
[56:09] ever healed before he can still heal now
[56:12] well brother john can i preach amen i'll
[56:14] just be honest with you amen i'm a
[56:16] little bit sick here and saying well
[56:17] people's in too bad of condition to be
[56:19] saved amen what if that has said that
[56:21] about you when you needed to be saved
[56:24] well come on now amen god they told me
[56:26] you got a burden on his heart to go in
[56:28] some souls amen went and talked to some
[56:30] people and they gave about four excuses
[56:32] on why it couldn't be done the area was
[56:34] too bad and this was too rough and it's
[56:36] not going to work i tell you what amen
[56:38] that's a devil from the pits of hell
[56:40] amen that don't want to see a move of
[56:41] god break out but i don't know about you
[56:44] amen but i believe sin the light church
[56:45] welcomes the move of god i believe we
[56:47] welcome the power of god and then to
[56:49] move in our services to move in our
[56:51] families you want to see the devil get
[56:53] mad get people saved and full of the
[56:55] holy ghost and walking in the newness of
[56:57] life and it'll cause every devil and
[56:59] hell to turn over but the same devil
[57:01] that tried to stop at the end won't stop
[57:03] it now it's the irresistible force of
[57:06] the church of the living god
[57:09] remember this friends the power of
[57:11] pentecost is not dead it's still in our
[57:13] churches you know why people don't want
[57:15] it because people's made a mockery of it
[57:18] well they might as well preach they made
[57:20] a mockery of the move of god they made a
[57:22] mockery of the power of god but i say
[57:24] this wherever andrew glover is i welcome
[57:26] the spirit of god i welcome the power of
[57:28] salvation i welcome the god of
[57:30] redemption i welcome the god of abraham
[57:33] isaac and jacob to come in the church i
[57:35] give him the right of way i give him my
[57:37] voice i give him my mind i give him
[57:40] everything i have he meant to find a
[57:42] channel to access his children through
[57:44] by his word
[57:45] oh the devil can't stop within and the
[57:47] devil won't stop it now so what we need
[57:49] to do is we need to sharpen our
[57:50] spiritual memories amen and remember and
[57:53] believe and quit doing what the devil
[57:55] wants us to do and forgetting fear

[1:05:35] quickened by the holy spirit peter or
[1:05:37] rather john would say in john 14 26
[1:05:39] would record the words of jesus the
[1:05:41] comforter which is the holy ghost whom
[1:05:44] the father will send in my name he shall
[1:05:46] teach you all things and what bring all
[1:05:49] things to your remembrance
[1:05:52] whatsoever i have said unto you now i'll
[1:05:54] say like this we all need a reminder

[1:05:59] the other day from a brother in a group
[1:06:01] text he would send out this this text of
[1:06:03] with all the things that's going on and
[1:06:05] this word really called me he would say
[1:06:07] you know as the head of your household

[1:06:26] while praying over my family this
[1:06:27] morning while they slept it's our duty
[1:06:29] as men but it is also our privilege
[1:06:32] think about that we have the privilege
[1:06:35] as the head of our household see that
[1:06:37] word just caught me amen household what
[1:06:39] does the word household mean it means of
[1:06:42] one's own house belonging to a house or
[1:06:44] a family domestic intimate belonging to
[1:06:47] one's household related by blood
[1:06:50] see amen the household is a relation by
[1:06:53] blood he meant kindred belonging to the
[1:06:55] household of god of the thing belong and
[1:06:57] devoted to adherence amen deuteronomy 16
[1:07:00] verse 5 thou mayest not sacrifice the
[1:07:02] pastor with any of the gates which the

[1:07:06] place which the lord god shall choose to
[1:07:08] place his name in there shalt thou
[1:07:10] sacrifice amen that evening after going
[1:07:12] down of the sun at the season thou came
[1:07:15] us forth out of egypt paul comes in
[1:07:17] first corinthians 12 and verse 13 and
[1:07:19] says for by one spirit we are all

[1:07:41] the word the seed to vindicate the seed
[1:07:44] for that season amen by one spirit we're

[1:08:03] you to remember who you're going to
[1:08:04] spend eternity with amen remember you're
[1:08:06] of the family of god and that's the
[1:08:09] house of god and the house of god is the
[1:08:11] name of jesus christ and the name of the
[1:08:13] lord is a mighty tower and the righteous
[1:08:16] run into it and are safe he said now how
[1:08:18] are you going to come in by a title how

[1:08:35] name at the door of the house of my
[1:08:37] worship for my family will be gathered
[1:08:40] in there under the blood
[1:08:42] glory i feel like shouting for a second
[1:08:44] my family will be gathered in there
[1:08:46] under the blood see then tonight amen
[1:08:48] you are kin to god by the blood
[1:08:52] hallelujah
[1:08:54] tonight you are kin to god by the blood
[1:08:57] amen your connection to god is by the
[1:08:59] blood then there is nothing that can
[1:09:01] separate us from the love of god that is
[1:09:03] in christ jesus those who have been born
[1:09:06] and drawn and connected by the blood
[1:09:08] like it was in egypt anything outside
[1:09:11] died and in there there's no living
[1:09:13] bread there's no denominational mixture
[1:09:15] it is my house my children born to my
[1:09:18] genes glory to god he says my genes are
[1:09:21] in them
[1:09:23] oh i hope this is okay my genes are in
[1:09:26] them i put my word in them i'll write up
[1:09:29] on the tables of their heart that's my
[1:09:31] family the family of the body of jesus
[1:09:34] christ amen the family and the door
[1:09:36] you'll come in it's not methodist
[1:09:38] baptist pentecostal amen it's the door
[1:09:40] where i put my name amen and the name is
[1:09:42] jesus christ of whom the whole family in
[1:09:45] heaven and earth is named the name of
[1:09:48] jesus christ then we are of the
[1:09:50] household of
[1:09:52] unadulterated faith
[1:09:54] come on church we're not of the
[1:09:56] household of fear we are of the
[1:09:57] household of unadulterated faith paul
[1:10:00] would say faith is the substance of
[1:10:02] things hoped for it's the evidence of
[1:10:04] things not seen that word substance
[1:10:06] means foundation he would go on to say
[1:10:08] in hebrews 3 14 we are made partakers of
[1:10:11] christ if we hold the beginning of our
[1:10:14] confidence amen steadfast unto the end
[1:10:17] see right now the devil wants you to
[1:10:18] forget who you are and he wants to take
[1:10:20] you out of the battle quickly amen but
[1:10:22] if there's ever been a time amen to hold
[1:10:24] your steadfast right now is the time to
[1:10:27] stand
[1:10:29] now you find there if that faith amen is
[1:10:32] the foundation look at this in the
[1:10:34] stature of perfect man he said you must
[1:10:36] be born again and when you're born again
[1:10:38] you can't be born again without having
[1:10:39] faith so see on my chart here i got the
[1:10:42] very foundation
[1:10:44] faith is the foundation of all of it
[1:10:46] faith is the foundation of amen so faith
[1:10:49] is the foundation of the family of god
[1:10:52] oh
[1:10:53] i hope this is okay without faith it is
[1:10:55] impossible to please god see when you're
[1:10:57] a skeptic of the bible you'll be a
[1:10:59] skeptic of the word being right you
[1:11:01] might as well stay back until first you
[1:11:03] believe it amen see just depends now
[1:11:06] watch this what is sin it's unbelief
[1:11:08] there's only two elements controls the
[1:11:09] human being that's either doubt or faith
[1:11:11] one or the other you're possessed of one
[1:11:13] that dominates your life it just depends
[1:11:16] on how much faith you have is how high
[1:11:19] you can rise no wonder the devil wants
[1:11:21] you to forget and fear amen and not
[1:11:23] remember and believe because fear will
[1:11:25] take it down amen but faith will take
[1:11:27] you up just as much faith as you can
[1:11:30] have this is how high you can rise faith
[1:11:32] and doubt will not mix together may i
[1:11:35] say this like this faith and fear will
[1:11:37] not mix together this will be either a
[1:11:39] church of faith or it'll be a church of
[1:11:41] fear amen brother dan your church will
[1:11:43] be the church of faith or a church of
[1:11:44] fear brother bill it'll either be a
[1:11:46] church of faith or a church of fear amen
[1:11:48] there are no two households that has two
[1:11:51] heads that will ever succeed but a house
[1:11:53] that's divided against itself will fall
[1:11:56] oh come on if we welcome fear in we're
[1:11:59] making faith unwelcome if we welcome
[1:12:01] down in we're making faith unwelcome but
[1:12:03] is there anybody here that's ready to
[1:12:05] take back dominion of your own house as
[1:12:08] the family as the genes of god that's
[1:12:10] the bloodline of almighty god you're
[1:12:12] ready to stand up and say devil you
[1:12:14] might have brought fear in but you're
[1:12:16] taking it back to hell where it come
[1:12:17] from
[1:12:19] no
[1:12:20] we will not welcome fear we will welcome
[1:12:23] faith we welcome faith faith to believe
[1:12:26] for salvation faith to believe for
[1:12:28] healing see what happened in the fall in
[1:12:29] the garden it produced the faith but the
[1:12:31] prophet said it was a hybrid faith he
[1:12:33] said see what a hybrid faith does is it
[1:12:36] takes what man says and mixes it with
[1:12:38] what god says and produces the faith
[1:12:40] which is the hybrid faith which is not
[1:12:42] an unadulterated faith which is not a
[1:12:45] substance faith he said see no satan
[1:12:47] come right along with his theology and
[1:12:49] eve mixed it and gave it to adam and
[1:12:52] calls the hybrid faith that's what the
[1:12:54] church has got today so-called church a
[1:12:57] hybrid faith it's mixed with fears
[1:13:00] doubts and frustrations if it is genuine
[1:13:02] faith it would not move

[1:13:07] fear it's mixed with doubt and
[1:13:09] frustration amen genuine faith will not

[1:13:47] day we came out our faith has not been
[1:13:49] mixed with what man thinks about the
[1:13:51] word our faith has been mixed with the
[1:13:54] spirit of god and it has quickened a
[1:13:56] pulsation in our hearts to believe when
[1:13:58] it's crazy to believe to stand when it's
[1:14:01] crazy to stand
[1:14:03] hybrid face a beautiful church but it's

[1:21:33] safely against the cross unadulterated
[1:21:35] faith holds fast to the promise then
[1:21:37] we're being baptized by this token he
[1:21:39] says see now we are subject to the gifts
[1:21:41] that's in there when we were baptized
[1:21:43] into him we have every promise that god
[1:21:46] made laid at our fingertips no sin is in
[1:21:49] there no death is in there even sickness
[1:21:51] cannot stay in his presence if satan
[1:21:53] then puts his hands to you and tries to
[1:21:55] tempt you into something you hold your
[1:21:58] token in your hands and you show that
[1:22:00] you're a redeemed product of jesus
[1:22:02] christ and let your
[1:22:03] unadulterated faith wave that token
[1:22:06] there and say i am a product at jesus
[1:22:09] christ
[1:22:12] come on church amen you got a right amen
[1:22:15] brother john your children have been
[1:22:16] born in your house

[1:22:19] by your blood amen they've got a right
[1:22:21] to claim the promises that you made them
[1:22:24] and somebody else can try to take it
[1:22:26] from them but they've got a right to
[1:22:27] stand there and say john martin is my
[1:22:29] father and he said i could have these
[1:22:31] things and you've got no right to take
[1:22:33] it amen wave your identification before
[1:22:36] the enemy and say you cannot take it
[1:22:38] well if that can be that way with the
[1:22:39] natural father then how much more

[1:22:44] can take the token of the holy ghost we
[1:22:47] can wave in the face of depression we
[1:22:49] can wave in the face of confusion and
[1:22:51] say i'll hold safely to the cross i'll
[1:22:53] clean
[1:22:55] hallelujah he said what's going to

[1:24:47] word i refuse to fear the devil i refuse
[1:24:50] to fear hell i know this last day amen
[1:24:52] is plagued with true spirits it's the
[1:24:54] spirit of fear and it's the spirit of
[1:24:56] faith i'm a labor here for a minute and
[1:24:59] i'm going to try to close y'all's
[1:25:01] killing me but i'm loving every minute
[1:25:02] of it
[1:25:04] two spirits in the land today one is the
[1:25:06] spirit of fear the other is the spirit
[1:25:08] of faith the prophet said be not afraid
[1:25:10] there's two elements control the entire
[1:25:12] human race in the world one of them is
[1:25:14] fear and the other is faith
[1:25:16] well glory to god with andrew amen the
[1:25:18] democrats are controlled by faith by
[1:25:20] fear and republicans are controlled by
[1:25:22] faith the entire human race
[1:25:25] republican independent liberal
[1:25:27] conservative the entire human race is
[1:25:29] plagued by the spirit of fear the only
[1:25:32] thing that separates you from the entire
[1:25:34] human race is a bloodline by a household
[1:25:38] by a gene seed of god by a kindred king
[1:25:40] of god that separated you by
[1:25:42] predestination that you would not be
[1:25:44] swept away in the fears of laodicea but
[1:25:47] you would rise in the power of faith
[1:25:49] it's either fear faith controls every
[1:25:51] nation every nomination every individual
[1:25:53] you're either fear or faith that
[1:25:55] controls you somebody shout fear
[1:25:58] or faith
[1:26:00] fear
[1:26:01] or faith
[1:26:02] i say faith over fear
[1:26:06] i say faith over fear
[1:26:08] he said brother andrew those two spirits
[1:26:10] are representing two persons that's
[1:26:11] right i almost said like this the spirit
[1:26:13] of fear represents the devil amen i feel
[1:26:16] that devil right now pushing against me
[1:26:18] because he knows somebody's about to go
[1:26:20] free he knows somebody's about ready to
[1:26:22] remember who they are they're going to
[1:26:23] remember where god called them and
[1:26:25] they're going to believe their way out
[1:26:26] of the situation they're in spirit of
[1:26:28] fear represents the devil but the spirit
[1:26:30] of faith represents jesus christ then
[1:26:33] today there are two households in the
[1:26:34] land one of them has to have a head both
[1:26:37] has to have a head may i say the
[1:26:38] household of fear the head is the devil
[1:26:41] the head of the household of fear is the
[1:26:43] devil but the household of faith amen
[1:26:45] the head is the lord jesus christ the
[1:26:49] head of the household amen knows the
[1:26:52] house that's why jesus would say i know
[1:26:54] thy works and thy tribulation and thy
[1:26:56] poverty amen thou art rich but i know
[1:26:58] the blasphemy of them which say they are
[1:27:00] jews and are not but they are of the
[1:27:02] synagogue of satan see he is looking
[1:27:04] down upon his family he is the head of
[1:27:07] his household he is the provider he is
[1:27:10] the protector your father knoweth the
[1:27:12] things you have need of oh it is not
[1:27:15] true today for the artists and age when
[1:27:17] they're full of wealth amen and often
[1:27:19] the criteria of spirituality is an
[1:27:21] abundance of earthly goods we may not
[1:27:24] have enough money in our pocket tonight
[1:27:26] to buy a warm cheeseburger after church
[1:27:28] but if we've got the blood of jesus
[1:27:30] christ amen flowing through our veins we
[1:27:33] are the richest people in flint michigan
[1:27:35] tonight we are the richest church on the
[1:27:37] face there we have got the kingman
[1:27:39] skinship to jesus christ he is our
[1:27:42] father come on friends i told somebody i
[1:27:44] said look i know gas prices are going
[1:27:46] crazy right now but don't you forget
[1:27:49] amen your father is the father who
[1:27:51] showed up at a wedding one time and
[1:27:53] there was no wine they ran out of wine
[1:27:55] and his mother looked at him and said go
[1:27:57] get some water and just bring it in his
[1:27:59] presence he'll turn it into wine amen
[1:28:01] and they said whatever he say do you
[1:28:03] better do i told somebody today i said
[1:28:05] if it gets where i ain't got no gas i'll
[1:28:07] go get a water hose and fill up my tank
[1:28:09] because my god can turn water into wine
[1:28:12] he can turn water into gasoline your
[1:28:14] father knows the things you have needed
[1:28:16] your father knows everything about you
[1:28:20] he is a rich god
[1:28:22] you're in a rich household
[1:28:25] well glory to god you're in a rich
[1:28:27] household tonight you're not wearing a
[1:28:29] second-handed robe you're wearing the
[1:28:31] best robe you can wear you're not eating
[1:28:33] the crumbs you're sitting at the table
[1:28:36] feasting up on seven seals revealed man
[1:28:38] and the age you're living in
[1:28:41] oh the bible says it amen this this time
[1:28:43] is preaching faster i can't preach
[1:28:46] can i have a few more minutes
[1:28:47] the bible prophesies that the time we're
[1:28:50] living in will be a fearful time jesus
[1:28:52] said you'll hear of earthquakes divers
[1:28:54] places famines pestilence fearful sights
[1:28:56] great signs shall there be from heaven
[1:28:58] look at this word fearful it means to
[1:29:00] strike terror it means a cause of fright
[1:29:02] the prophet said one of the greatest
[1:29:04] curses on the church today is fear
[1:29:06] everybody's scared to death it's what's
[1:29:08] going to happen who what he said even
[1:29:11] when fearful sights come lift up your
[1:29:14] head if you're of the household of faith
[1:29:16] you can lift up your head for your
[1:29:18] redemption draw a nigh amen don't worry
[1:29:21] about the sputniks don't worry about all
[1:29:22] these things and quit sitting here
[1:29:24] looking for something greater
[1:29:27] come on well something greater is coming
[1:29:29] even something greater is coming the
[1:29:31] prophet said don't look for nothing
[1:29:32] greater we've already got the greatest
[1:29:35] thing in heaven the holy spirit
[1:29:37] manifesting himself in this generation
[1:29:40] there's nothing else can be done
[1:29:43] when you see these fearful sides lift up
[1:29:45] your heads amen your redemption draws
[1:29:47] nigh amen see what that word fearful
[1:29:49] means it means to strike fear it means
[1:29:52] to strike terror let me set you like
[1:29:54] this natural terrorism is an awful thing
[1:29:56] we a few years ago we were up in in new
[1:29:58] york for some meetings and brother
[1:30:00] brother there in the church at brother
[1:30:01] yvonne carrion's he took us down to the
[1:30:03] 911 memorial he meant that man that
[1:30:05] actually took us i didn't know while we
[1:30:07] were in there brother bill he was he was
[1:30:09] walking through kind of to himself you
[1:30:10] know and i could tell he's a bit subdued
[1:30:12] amen and afterwards he told me he said
[1:30:14] andrew he said i was in the bottom of
[1:30:15] these towers on the morning they blew up
[1:30:17] he said that was the day that i gave my
[1:30:19] heart back to god he said i hope i'm not
[1:30:21] opening up too much about his testimony
[1:30:22] he said that morning he said i left home
[1:30:24] and he said my wife told me it's over
[1:30:26] we're going to split up you're going to
[1:30:27] find somewhere else to live you're not
[1:30:29] coming back home you're living a
[1:30:30] horrible life he said i left that
[1:30:32] morning not having a home to go to he
[1:30:34] said the morning the towers blew up he
[1:30:35] said my car was outside fried to a
[1:30:37] pancake he said i'll tell you why i'm
[1:30:39] crying in here he said because it was
[1:30:41] the day that jesus christ changed my
[1:30:44] life for him
[1:30:47] but there was a heavy there was a there
[1:30:48] was a heavy spirit in that building
[1:30:50] it was a place where over 3 000 lives
[1:30:52] were lost in one day
[1:30:54] see that was a natural terrorism and
[1:30:56] i'll say this natural terrorism is awful
[1:30:58] but let me say there's also spiritual
[1:31:00] terrorism
[1:31:01] you say what is terrorism it's the use
[1:31:03] of fear and acts of violence in order to
[1:31:06] intimidate societies governments or
[1:31:08] against an ideology even common
[1:31:10] definitions of terrorism refer to
[1:31:13] violent acts which are intended to
[1:31:15] create fear or terror they may be done
[1:31:18] for a religious political or ideological
[1:31:20] goal and it's used as illegal violence
[1:31:23] that if the devil is intimidating you
[1:31:25] tonight he is illegally using fear
[1:31:28] against you well let me just go ahead
[1:31:30] and cut to the chase and say satan is a
[1:31:32] terrorist
[1:31:33] and i'll say what else a terrorist will
[1:31:35] do a terrorist will disguise herself to
[1:31:37] try to fit in the pattern of their
[1:31:39] surrounding if you go in that memorial
[1:31:41] 911 you'll see a video screen of those
[1:31:43] terrorists that hijacked those planes
[1:31:45] they didn't come in robes and and
[1:31:47] turbines on their head and all kinds of
[1:31:48] things they come in looking like
[1:31:50] everybody else they went through
[1:31:51] security like everybody else but they
[1:31:53] were terrorists in disguise well paul
[1:31:55] says i know that after my departing shot
[1:31:58] gravious wolves enter and among you not
[1:32:00] sparing the flock he would also that say
[1:32:02] satan himself is transformed into an
[1:32:04] angel life that word transform means
[1:32:07] fashion himself into something see then
[1:32:09] the devil comes in the church as a
[1:32:11] terrorist amen attempts to destroy the
[1:32:13] church by lying promises by the spirit
[1:32:16] of deception amen by resting of the
[1:32:18] scriptures but let me set you like this
[1:32:20] when you show up for church the devil
[1:32:23] shows up too because he's a terrorist
[1:32:25] when job went to the presence of god
[1:32:27] blood said the devil was right there
[1:32:28] with him he said see the devil was right
[1:32:31] there and the bible says amen that job
[1:32:33] began to fear and the thing he feared
[1:32:35] come upon him amen i'm closing right
[1:32:37] here in just a moment in the book of job
[1:32:39] it says job fear what he feared it
[1:32:41] actually happened what brought in his
[1:32:43] fear see notice this his faith would
[1:32:46] have kept him from it but his fear
[1:32:48] brought it to him i'm on church fear was
[1:32:51] the vehicle that brought jobs to caesars
[1:32:53] to him fear was the vehicle that brought
[1:32:55] jobs fears upon him he said but faith
[1:32:57] would take it away amen job had a fear
[1:32:59] that these things would come upon him
[1:33:01] and they did and if you have a fear that
[1:33:03] your disease won't leave you it won't
[1:33:05] but if you have faith it will come on
[1:33:08] peter amen get out of the boat and walk
[1:33:10] on water oh my i'm scared he was doing
[1:33:13] all right till he got scared amen the
[1:33:15] prophet said he stepped down and said
[1:33:16] lord i'll just walk but when he got his
[1:33:18] eyes on the waves he got scared what
[1:33:20] come in his mind the first thing i'm
[1:33:22] going to walk because the word said for
[1:33:23] me to walk and the next thing he looked
[1:33:25] at his symptoms he looked down out there
[1:33:27] he seen how big the waves was and he got
[1:33:29] scared and what he did down he went what
[1:33:32] he feared happened but what he believed
[1:33:34] happened come on he believed if that was
[1:33:36] the word he said bit me to walk and i'll
[1:33:37] walk and he had enough faith to step out
[1:33:40] on the water but the symptoms rose up
[1:33:42] around him and he looked around and he
[1:33:43] began to go down oh come on church this
[1:33:46] is not the time to look down this is not
[1:33:48] the time to turn around he said the
[1:33:50] substance would have went right over the
[1:33:52] top of that white calf and went right
[1:33:54] onto him see if he had perfect faith oh
[1:33:57] god if he would have kept his eyes with
[1:33:59] a damn on jesus he would have walked
[1:34:00] over them white caps he would have
[1:34:02] walked over them lying symptoms let me
[1:34:04] let me knock the devil square in the
[1:34:05] face and we'll go home fear is of the
[1:34:07] devil
[1:34:10] somebody preached with me fear is of the
[1:34:11] devil
[1:34:12] so don't fear
[1:34:14] everything jesus would say fear not fear
[1:34:16] not amen god don't want you to fear he
[1:34:19] wants you to believe your great
[1:34:20] adversary the devil can catch you in one
[1:34:22] way he'll try another he said but see
[1:34:25] look to jesus
[1:34:27] jesus came to destroy the works of the
[1:34:29] devil that's why god was made both soul
[1:34:31] and body jesus had both soul and body
[1:34:34] and yet was god i love this brother bill
[1:34:36] he came to take on himself the full form
[1:34:39] of man to redeem the full form of man
[1:34:42] back to god
[1:34:44] he come to take on the full form of man
[1:34:47] to redeem the full form of man back to
[1:34:49] god that's why he come in flesh
[1:34:52] and soul
[1:34:54] i say to you like this
[1:34:56] resist the devil
[1:34:58] resist the spirit of fear
[1:35:00] resist
[1:35:01] steadfast in the faith
[1:35:04] what are you saying preacher i'm saying
[1:35:06] the devil uses fear
[1:35:07] to attack the church the living god
[1:35:10] to intimidate them
[1:35:13] i know what i'm talking about
[1:35:16] let the power of god move into service
[1:35:17] and people start dancing and shouting
[1:35:19] and rejoicing and that old terrorist of
[1:35:21] hell will come in name satan
[1:35:23] and he'll feel that fear that you say
[1:35:24] around listen you all better be careful
[1:35:26] this might turn into wildfire he's
[1:35:28] intimidating you
[1:35:30] but remember you're of the household of
[1:35:32] faith
[1:35:36] what does the word intimidate mean it
[1:35:37] means to frighten or all
[1:35:39] someone
[1:35:41] especially in order to make them do what
[1:35:42] one wants them to do
[1:35:45] i find it amazing the problem of god
[1:35:47] would come along and said like this
[1:35:50] he would bring us the secret to the
[1:35:52] victory in the battle of intimidation
[1:35:54] of a man waking up
[1:35:56] and the devil in his bedroom
[1:35:59] and the devil looks at the man and says
[1:36:00] boo
[1:36:02] and the devil gets bigger and the man
[1:36:03] gets smaller
[1:36:05] he says boo again the devil gets bigger
[1:36:06] and the man gets smaller he keeps saying
[1:36:08] boo bye brother said that the man got so
[1:36:10] small
[1:36:12] come on
[1:36:14] boo send the light church and the devil
[1:36:16] got bigger and the church got smaller
[1:36:18] boo devil got bigger church got smaller
[1:36:21] he said but then all of a sudden the man
[1:36:22] realized we're gonna have to do
[1:36:23] something
[1:36:26] we're gonna have to do something he said
[1:36:28] so he looked over brother john and there
[1:36:30] was his bible
[1:36:31] and he picked up his bible and he looked
[1:36:33] the devil in the eye and said boo back
[1:36:36] brother seth he said boo back and when
[1:36:37] the man said boo he said all of a sudden
[1:36:40] the devil got smaller and i got bigger
[1:36:44] the devil got smaller and i got bigger

[1:39:31] let's drop these things tonight
[1:39:34] we are of the household
[1:39:37] of faith
[1:39:39] we are not of the majority
[1:39:41] that is looking at fearful sides
[1:39:43] we are looking
[1:39:45] with the minority
[1:39:47] we've looked away to jesus
[1:39:49] we've looked away to jesus
[1:39:52] all my

[1:40:09] the ends of the earth for i am god and
[1:40:11] there is none else let me say this
[1:40:13] probably god said like this when the
[1:40:15] systems of the earth comes to an end
[1:40:18] look
[1:40:19] away
[1:40:20] to jesus
[1:40:23] he said see i would like to kind of turn

[1:40:27] look especially unto me
[1:40:29] at the end of each world system
[1:40:31] now brother dan is about makes me shout
[1:40:34] he always makes himself known so real
[1:40:37] at the end
[1:40:39] of a world system
[1:40:42] when it's coming to an end
[1:40:44] is when he makes himself known

[1:40:57] cannot stand any longer we're living in
[1:40:58] a democracy that's living on borrowed
[1:41:00] time
[1:41:03] but god
[1:41:04] would choose you to be a son
[1:41:06] would choose you to be his son would
[1:41:08] choose you to be his daughter
[1:41:10] brother dad the father of all fathers
[1:41:13] would choose us to be one of his sons
[1:41:16] bring us into the household of faith by
[1:41:18] his blood
[1:41:20] give us a token in this age of fear this
[1:41:22] age of neurotic
[1:41:24] to wave in the devil's face

[1:41:55] use the same
[1:41:57] word that we're using he was the word to
[1:41:58] defeat the devil

[1:42:03] defeat the devil anywhere anytime
[1:42:05] anyplace in any condition one service
[1:42:07] he'll actually not 1958 i believe he'll
[1:42:09] start listing
[1:42:11] conditions
[1:42:13] he'll say if it's in the belly of a
[1:42:15] whale the world of the word will defeat
[1:42:16] the devil
[1:42:18] he'll say if it's in a hus if it's in
[1:42:20] the lion's den the word will defeat the
[1:42:22] devil he'll say if it's laying in a
[1:42:24] hospital bed dying of cancer the word
[1:42:26] will defeat the devil
[1:42:28] brother danny says something that
[1:42:29] strikes me if it's laying in an
[1:42:31] automobile accident bleeding to death
[1:42:33] he'll defeat the devil
[1:42:36] 1958 he says if the word
[1:42:40] in that condition
[1:42:41] is in the heart of the believer
[1:42:43] it'll defeat the devil brother what
[1:42:45] weaker condition could you get in than
[1:42:47] to be laying in an automobile accident
[1:42:49] bleeding to death died and the word will
[1:42:51] still defeat the devil in that condition
[1:42:54] that was 1958 then the other day i was
[1:42:56] just the one when billy paul brother
[1:42:57] billy paul's testimonies and he says it
[1:42:59] like this he said on the day of the
[1:43:01] accident
[1:43:02] he said when they was in the accident he
[1:43:04] said i ran up to daddy's car he said

[1:43:07] steering wheel he said bleeding all over
[1:43:09] the place said laying there dying and he
[1:43:12] says in that condition i asked daddy
[1:43:14] daddy are you okay
[1:43:16] he said billy where's sarah
[1:43:18] he said daddy sarah's behind you but
[1:43:20] billy said there was no ambulance there
[1:43:22] there was no medical scans there he said
[1:43:25] and daddy looked at me and said billy
[1:43:27] sarah's back is broke
[1:43:31] not even talk to her
[1:43:33] but that same gift that was an operation
[1:43:35] that could tell you what color the
[1:43:37] doctor's clothes was that talked to you
[1:43:38] that day
[1:43:40] that same gift that could tell you what
[1:43:41] you had on or what you were wearing was
[1:43:43] laying in an automobile accident and the
[1:43:45] body bleeding to death but the word was
[1:43:48] still in full power
[1:43:49] and would say sarah's back is broke and
[1:43:51] he'd say take my hand and lay it over on
[1:43:54] her back on her body and she would be
[1:43:56] healed he would say where's mama he
[1:43:58] would say daddy she's laying there dying
[1:44:00] they been she's already dead he would
[1:44:02] say take my hand and lay it over on her
[1:44:04] body oh god friends

[1:44:09] you hearing the power that's been
[1:44:10] restored to you it don't matter what
[1:44:12] condition he was laying in an automobile
[1:44:15] accident bleeding to death and the word
[1:44:17] was stealing authority well if we're not
[1:44:19] in automobile accident tonight we're in
[1:44:21] the house of god and we need healings
[1:44:24] and deliverances and miracles then quit
[1:44:26] sitting there letting the devil tell you
[1:44:27] you're the weakest christian the prophet
[1:44:29] said that word is in the reach of the
[1:44:31] weakest of christians you can use it
[1:44:33] it'll defeat the devil in the whales
[1:44:35] barely it'll defeat the devil in the
[1:44:37] lion's den it'll defeat the devil on the
[1:44:38] bed of cancer it'll defeat the devil in
[1:44:41] an automobile accident bleeding to death

[1:45:28] after another fear
[1:45:30] after another fear
[1:45:33] after another fear
[1:45:37] and i began to think of a prophet's
[1:45:38] words
[1:45:40] he would say it like this
[1:45:42] he would say watch russia
[1:45:46] watch russia
[1:45:48] but you know what he never said he never
[1:45:50] said fear russia

[1:45:55] there's a big difference in watching
[1:45:57] something fearing something
[1:46:00] watch
[1:46:01] russia

[1:46:57] let's remember
[1:46:58] who's in our midst tonight
