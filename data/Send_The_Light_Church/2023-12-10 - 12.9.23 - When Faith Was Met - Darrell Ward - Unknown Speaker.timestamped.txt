[38:54] certainly enjoyed the the special
[38:56] tonight in the song service God is so
[38:59] good
[39:02] amen God bless you brother Bill good to
[39:04] see you sir appreciate you
[39:07] coming the Bible says this and when
[39:10] they're escaped then they knew that the
[39:12] island was called Mita and the barbarus
[39:15] people showed us no little kindness for
[39:18] they kindled a fire and received
[39:20] everyone because of the present rain and
[39:22] because of the cold and when Paul had
[39:25] gathered a bundle sticks and laid them
[39:27] on the fire there came a viper out of
[39:29] the Heat and fastened on his
[39:32] hand and when The Barbarians saw that
[39:35] the venomous Beast hang on his hand they
[39:37] said among themselves ain't it something
[39:40] how people always thinks the negative of
[39:42] you they said among themselves no doubt
[39:45] this man is a murderer whom though he
[39:48] has escaped the sea yet Vengeance have
[39:51] suffereth not to live and he shook off
[39:55] the Beast Into the Fire fire and felt no
[39:58] harm amen and how be it they looked when
[40:01] he should have swollen or fallen down
[40:03] dead suddenly but after they had looked
[40:06] a great while and saw no harm come to
[40:08] him they changed their minds and said
[40:12] that he was a
[40:14] God how fast their opinion changed from
[40:17] being a murderer to being a god when
[40:21] snake venom met
[40:24] faith and that's what we want to look at
[40:26] tonight if the Lord will help us When
[40:27] Faith was met Amen Let Us bow our heads
[40:32] Heavenly
[40:33] Father we thank you Lord for the word of
[40:36] God we thank you Lord for this hour that
[40:39] we're living in knowing that no matter
[40:41] how dark it gets or how violent or how
[40:43] evil it gets yet you will keep your word
[40:46] that you promised us Lord we believe
[40:49] tonight that we're gathered with the
[40:50] elect of God that you for ordained
[40:52] before the foundation of the world to be
[40:54] here God in this day Lord we do not
[40:57] believe that you put us here to fail but
[40:59] we believe that you placed us here
[41:01] because you had confidence that we could
[41:02] take your word and overcome this Leota
[41:05] age and Lord we pray tonight that your
[41:07] anointing would just come and take this
[41:10] feeble thought Lord and break it to the
[41:12] hearts of your children that our faith
[41:14] could rise up and receive that which
[41:16] you've already done for us for Father
[41:18] God your Prophet taught us many times
[41:20] that if you stood here in this suit that
[41:22] it was given to him he said Jesus could
[41:24] not heal you because you're already
[41:27] healed the word declares it so Lord
[41:29] tonight may we not look to symptoms may
[41:31] we not look to doctor's reports May we
[41:33] not look to anything that's contrary to
[41:35] your word may we just Look to You Lord
[41:38] and believe bless your children father
[41:40] in a great way those that were they here
[41:42] tonight and those that was unable to
[41:43] come Lord I pray that your spirit would
[41:45] just go to them and minister to them
[41:47] Lord we pray bless your children Lord
[41:49] that when we leave the building may we
[41:50] say did not our hearts burn within us as
[41:53] you walked and talked with us along the
[41:55] way bless us tonight Lord we pray in
[41:57] Jesus name and the bride says amen God
[42:00] bless you Saints you may be
[42:02] seated now I trust you don't mind me
[42:04] quoting the prophet but brother brenman
[42:06] taught us that perfect faith is the
[42:08] master of all
[42:10] circumstances perfect Faith Masters all
[42:14] circumstances well brother Daryl what
[42:16] about mine it Masters all circumstances
[42:20] no matter what it is Faith Masters it he
[42:23] says now watch when you believe anything
[42:25] or do anything you've got to have faith
[42:28] in what you're doing and Faith Masters
[42:31] that circumstance when you believe
[42:33] anything or do anything you've got to
[42:36] have faith in what you're doing then
[42:38] that tells me that when we come through
[42:40] those doors back there we need to come
[42:42] with the understanding of who we are we
[42:44] need to come with this understanding
[42:46] that we was born for a purpose we didn't
[42:48] stagger into this thing as I said in my
[42:50] prayer God knew before there was a star
[42:52] before there was an angel before there
[42:54] was a molecule he knew your name he knew
[42:56] knew the color of your hair he knew the
[42:57] color of your eyes and he wrote your
[42:59] name in his book Hallelujah and like I
[43:02] said we're not here by chance but he put
[43:03] us here not that we would be defeated
[43:05] but he put us here that we would
[43:07] overcome we need to realize we're not an
[43:10] organization we are not a denomination
[43:12] we are the body of Christ represented on
[43:15] the earth in the hour that we are living
[43:17] in is that right John reflected him in
[43:19] his day Wesley reflected him in his day
[43:21] Luther reflected him in this in his day
[43:23] but this is our day and he has called us
[43:26] here not to project some organization
[43:28] not to project some man's ideal but to
[43:30] project the word of God for this hour
[43:32] then we need to realize that we are here
[43:34] as the body of Christ to defeat Satan in
[43:37] this Leota age and when we understand
[43:39] who we are there comes a confidence that
[43:42] we can overcome because faith in the
[43:44] word of God will not fail you see faith
[43:47] is not a Hocus
[43:49] Pocus faith is not a magic wand that you
[43:53] wave over somebody faith is not what you
[43:55] feel
[43:57] it's what you believe and faith has to
[44:00] have a resting place amen and the word
[44:03] of God is the foundation that Faith rest
[44:06] upon the Bible says in Romans 3:4 let
[44:09] God be true but every man a liar the
[44:12] Bible also said heavens and earth shall
[44:14] pass away but not one word of God will
[44:18] fail then we can sit here tonight with
[44:20] this confidence that God's word does not
[44:24] lie Nations lie to us governments will
[44:27] lie to us
[44:31] politicians they'll lie to us that
[44:34] sometimes even people that are close to
[44:36] us will lie to us our feelings will lie
[44:39] to us come on somebody our emotions will
[44:41] lie to us Sensations will lie to us but
[44:44] the word of God will never lie to us
[44:48] thank you Lord and every word of God is
[44:51] just as true as every word of God it's
[44:54] either all the truth or none of it's the
[44:56] truth amen amen the same God that said
[44:59] let there be light is there light did
[45:01] God keep his word that same God said
[45:03] behold I send you Elijah did he keep his
[45:06] word did he send Elijah that same God
[45:08] said behold I give you the Holy Ghost
[45:10] did he keep that promise and that same
[45:13] God said I am the Lord thy God who heals
[45:15] all thy
[45:17] diseases Hallelujah then we can have
[45:19] confidence tonight then what God Said
[45:22] God will bring it to pass now how does
[45:24] God prove his word god proves his word
[45:27] by bringing it to pass thank you buddy
[45:30] oh the prophet said Oh my he he proves
[45:32] his word by bringing it to pass you see
[45:35] Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by
[45:38] the word of God when you hear what the
[45:40] word is saying to you then no matter
[45:43] what the circumstance is it's got
[45:45] nothing to do with it well the doctor
[45:48] says it's bad and the situation is
[45:50] impossible but circumstances has nothing
[45:53] to do with it because Faith Masters all
[45:57] circumstances amen Faith believes that
[46:00] God will work it out amen I don't know
[46:03] how he's going to work it out but the
[46:05] most wonderful thing is I don't have to
[46:07] know how he's going to work it out you
[46:09] see if I understand how he does it it's
[46:11] no longer Faith it's knowledge but we
[46:14] don't serve God by knowledge we serve
[46:16] God by faith amen and sometimes he don't
[46:19] ask us to understand he just says can
[46:21] you trust me amen oh my I don't know how
[46:24] he's going to do it but he'll do it
[46:26] anyhow because why Faith Masters all
[46:29] circumstances and you see faith and love
[46:31] is a
[46:33] relationship amen you see some people
[46:36] know everything about God but they're
[46:37] not in love with
[46:41] him amen but the Bible's not written in
[46:44] a book it's not just a book of knowledge
[46:46] but it a it's a love it's a love
[46:50] story to you am and faith and love is a
[46:54] relationship because you came have faith
[46:56] unless you've got
[46:59] love because because your faith you said
[47:03] because your faith is in a God Who is
[47:05] the very essence of love amen and faith
[47:08] and love works together you say what are
[47:12] you saying simply this if he loved me
[47:14] enough to die for me how many he
[47:16] believes he did if he loved me enough to
[47:18] die for me then he loves me enough to
[47:20] heal me to save me to deliver me to
[47:23] forgive me to Rapture me
[47:27] amen and you have faith in the God who
[47:30] loves you and faith in what the word is
[47:32] saying about you you see the Bible must
[47:36] become
[47:37] personal what is the new birth is Christ
[47:39] revealed to you personally you have met
[47:42] this
[47:44] person amen and when you read the Bible
[47:47] you've got to see your name in
[47:49] it if you can't see yourself in the word
[47:52] you'll never be
[47:54] victorious amen amen
[47:58] hallelujah brother Brenham said that
[48:01] Jesus never healed the sick to show his
[48:04] authority but he healed the sick to
[48:06] fulfill the scriptures right amen oh my
[48:10] think about that amen your faith is in a
[48:13] God who loves you and faith in what the
[48:16] word is saying about you you see Faith
[48:19] Masters every circumstance because it's
[48:21] not what you
[48:22] feel it's not what you see that's right
[48:26] it's not what you understand or what you
[48:28] can reason out it's what you believe
[48:33] right didn't we just sing it only
[48:36] believe all things are possible to them
[48:41] that believe amen amen when you hear
[48:45] what the word is saying about you then
[48:48] that word takes preeminence over every
[48:52] circumstance amen amen when you see
[48:57] yourself in the
[48:59] scriptures amen thank you brother when
[49:04] you see yourself in the scriptures
[49:07] that's right you know one of the most
[49:09] horrible things is
[49:12] amnesia one of the most cruelest
[49:14] diseases is not cancer it's
[49:17] Alzheimer's when people forget who they
[49:21] are right my daddy died from that it's a
[49:24] terrible disease
[49:26] the last communication I ever had with
[49:27] my daddy I had to go all the way back to
[49:29] his childhood and tell him things that I
[49:32] remember him telling me as a boy and it
[49:35] got to the place that he couldn't even
[49:37] remember to
[49:40] breathe think about that friends and to
[49:44] set and not know who you are but we're
[49:47] living in the hour that God wants us to
[49:49] know what the word is saying about us
[49:53] amen hallelujah amen hallelujah then
[49:56] that word takes prence over every
[49:58] circumstance when you see yourself in
[50:00] the scriptures like Paul did in Acts
[50:02] 23:10 it says and when they Rose their
[50:04] great dissension the chief Captain
[50:06] fearing least Paul should be pulled in
[50:08] pieces of them they going they're trying
[50:10] their best to kill him he said go there
[50:12] and get the man they're going to kill
[50:13] him so they went down there and got Paul
[50:15] because he SRA they's going to pull him
[50:17] into pieces and he commanded the
[50:18] soldiers go down and take him by force
[50:20] from among them and bring him into the
[50:22] castle and that night following the Lord
[50:25] stood by him and said be of good cheer
[50:27] Paul for as thou Hast testified of me in
[50:30] Jerusalem so must thou bear witness of
[50:33] me at Rome so where's Paul going Rome
[50:37] why God said so how's he going to get
[50:40] there circumstances doesn't matter right
[50:44] he'll get there because God said so well
[50:47] brother D how we ever go to Rapture it's
[50:49] getting so dark it's getting so evil and
[50:51] all how we ever going to do it I don't
[50:53] have to know how it's going to happen
[50:54] but I know it'll happen because God said
[50:57] so amen thou must bear witness to me at
[51:01] Rome so where's Paul headed Rome why the
[51:03] Lord said so how's he going to get there
[51:06] it don't matter circumstances don't
[51:09] matter he'll get there simply because
[51:11] God said so and God's word does not
[51:16] fail and on his way there there arose a
[51:20] great storm 14 days and nights no man
[51:24] ate any thing now I'm telling you right
[51:26] now that was some kind of
[51:29] storm right huh but after a long absence
[51:32] as Paul stood forth in the midst of him
[51:34] and said s you should have hearkened
[51:36] unto me and not loose from crate to have
[51:38] gained this harm and loss and now I
[51:40] exhort you to be of good cheer for there
[51:42] shall be no loss of any man's life among
[51:45] you but of the ship for there stood by

[51:50] and whom I serve saying fear not Paul

[51:56] have given thee all them that sell with
[51:58] thee now why would the angel tell him
[52:00] that the angel was only repeating to
[52:03] Paul what God had already told
[52:06] him you see some people misunderstand
[52:08] and they want to say that that that that
[52:10] the prophet messenger was a was a plous
[52:12] that he stoed from this one and and
[52:14] stoed from that one but they don't
[52:16] understand what the coming of Elijah was
[52:17] to do he didn't come to bring something
[52:19] new he come to restore us back to the
[52:22] word he come to Oh my he come to REM ESS
[52:25] of what was already been
[52:28] said and this angel that came from God
[52:30] he didn't give Paul a new revelation he
[52:32] just simply reminded Paul what God had
[52:35] already said to him amen oh my fear not
[52:40] Paul thou must be brought before Caesar
[52:42] Lo God hath given thee all them that
[52:43] sell with thee amen now why would he say
[52:46] that because Paul must go to Rome amen
[52:50] wherefor sir the Paul said wherefore sir

[52:58] that it shall be even as it was told to
[53:01] me how many beli what God's told you

[53:08] cheer are you kidding we're in a
[53:11] category 6 hurricane we've not ate a
[53:13] bite in 14 days and you're telling us to
[53:15] be happy Paul wasn't looking at the
[53:17] storm Hallelujah he wasn't looking at
[53:19] any of that he was looking at what God
[53:21] Said Amen there shall be lost of no
[53:24] man's life among you whether you've ate
[53:26] 14 days or whether you ain't ain't

[53:36] wherefore sir be of good cheer are you
[53:39] happy amen then let your face know
[53:43] it amen and the ship finally broke up
[53:46] from the storm why the angel said it
[53:50] would and taking pieces of the ship Paul
[53:53] and the others got the shore now
[53:55] Building A Fire to dry out and get warm
[53:57] Paul goes to gather up some kenlin now
[54:00] here's a great Revelation right here you
[54:01] see Paul didn't say now look boys I'm
[54:03] the first age CH First Church age
[54:05] messenger I'm a prophet of God and I'm
[54:08] this and I'm a great this and now I'm
[54:10] just going to I can't get my nails dirty
[54:11] you boys go out there and get the wood
[54:13] and I no Paul had an understanding that
[54:15] he was a servant to the people and any
[54:18] true God called man the gift that in his
[54:22] life that gift is not for himself it's
[54:24] for God's
[54:28] people you see people's got it wrong the
[54:31] bride is not a is not a is not a servant
[54:33] to the ministry but the ministry is a
[54:35] servant to his bride and the gift that
[54:38] in that man's life is not for himself
[54:40] it's for you and if God has placed a
[54:42] gift among you in brother Bill and
[54:44] brother John and these other brothers
[54:45] that Minister if God has placed that
[54:47] gift in their life that gift is not for
[54:49] them is for you and you need to use that
[54:51] gift that God's put among you preach
[54:54] brother thank you I believe I
[54:57] will amen hallelujah he went and got
[55:01] some wood to get worn because Paul was a
[55:04] servant and Gathering up some kindling
[55:06] and as he went to put it on the fire
[55:08] this snake struck him right on the hand
[55:10] amen now this snake was so
[55:13] deadly they sat down to watch him die
[55:18] they said this man must have done some
[55:20] kind of evil to escape the storm and now
[55:23] be bit by this deadly snake
[55:26] yeah they wasn't thinking nothing
[55:29] positive of this poor
[55:32] man you see the Venom attacked the
[55:34] nervous system and it shut down the
[55:36] breathing and they would just swell up
[55:38] and die suddenly and fall down there was
[55:40] no need to call 911 you'd be dead before
[55:43] you got the one out right so they just
[55:45] sat down to watch him die right I think
[55:49] I preached in that church one time I'm
[55:51] not
[55:54] sure
[55:57] sometimes it's hard people just want to
[55:59] look at
[56:01] you we need to get involved in the
[56:03] service I'm not the only one that has to
[56:05] sweat you know
[56:07] he amen a good service is when you
[56:10] sweating from saying
[56:12] amen just just trying to loosen you up a
[56:15] little
[56:16] bit but it attacked the nervous system
[56:18] and and this Venom coming up through
[56:21] Paul's body doing exactly what the snake
[56:24] venom was designed to do it wasn't a
[56:28] different kind of snake that bit Paul
[56:29] it's just like the rest of them a deadly
[56:31] snake and as the Venom be to come up his
[56:34] arm and through Paul's body all at once
[56:37] Venom met faith faith in the word that
[56:41] said you've got to go to Rome and appear
[56:43] before Caesar and when Venom met Faith
[56:47] Hallelujah there was no more
[56:51] poison the Venom was still in his body
[56:54] but the poison wasn't in the Venom oh
[56:58] God Paul took the word of God over the
[57:01] fear of a deadly snake bite and he just
[57:04] pitched it into the fire and gathered up
[57:06] more wood and the people of the
[57:08] island said this man ain't a
[57:12] murderer he's a
[57:14] god think about that when a Son of God
[57:17] by faith takes the word of God into his
[57:19] heart and speaks it back upon his lips
[57:22] it's just the same as deity speaking
[57:25] amen Every Mountain has to move think
[57:27] about it when a Son of God by faith
[57:29] takes the word of God and expresses it
[57:31] the Heathen identifies it as deity in
[57:35] flesh Hallelujah he ain't a murderer
[57:38] he's a
[57:40] God oh my think about that the three
[57:45] Hebrew children they stay true to God's
[57:47] word they would not bow their knee to
[57:49] the king's commandment so what did he do
[57:52] he heated up the furnace seven times s
[57:55] hotter than it had ever been heated it
[57:57] was so hot it killed the men who threw
[58:00] them in it
[58:03] right that king must have been some kind
[58:05] of mad think about it they burned their
[58:08] own men trying to kill the three Hebrew
[58:11] children and let me say tonight the
[58:13] devil will destroy his own kingdom
[58:16] trying to stop this bride but he will
[58:18] never stop this bride she is unmovable
[58:22] she is Unstoppable she is is
[58:24] undefeatable amen and they threw those
[58:27] boys in that fire and they testified our
[58:30] God is able to Deliver Us from this
[58:33] fiery furnace Shadrach mesach abedo and
[58:37] they were the Seed of Abraham and they
[58:40] had a promise of God that his seed would
[58:44] possess the enemy's
[58:47] gate amen they had that promise from God
[58:52] and they went into the furnace believe
[58:54] even they were the Seed of Abraham and
[58:57] God would keep his promise that he made
[58:59] to their father and I say tonight we are
[59:02] the Royal Seed of Abraham through the
[59:04] blood of Jesus Christ and we can sit
[59:07] here tonight knowing that no weapon
[59:09] formed against us will prosper amen
[59:13] hallelujah and when the king's fiery
[59:15] furnace met faith faith took the Heat
[59:18] and the smoke out of the
[59:21] fire notice he never took the fire out
[59:24] of the
[59:25] furnace because you see as mad as he was
[59:29] if he had have looked into that furnace
[59:31] and saw there was no fire what do you
[59:33] think he would have done relit it cuz he
[59:37] wanted to burn these boys
[59:39] hides so he would have relit the fire
[59:41] but when he looked in oh God the miracle
[59:45] wasn't that there wasn't a fire in the
[59:47] furnace the wind could have blowed that
[59:49] out the miracle was that the fire was
[59:52] still there but there wasn't no heat
[59:55] amen oh come on somebody that's the God
[59:58] we serve tonight he can take the Heat
[1:00:00] and the smoke out of the fire
[1:00:03] amen hallelujah hallelujah what about
[1:00:06] Daniel thrown into a lion den and them
[1:00:09] Lions knew they had an easy meal nowhere
[1:00:11] for this man to go right you talking
[1:00:14] about a Happy Meal that was a Happy
[1:00:17] Meal you see no and no doubt these lines
[1:00:21] had ate several men in their lifetime
[1:00:23] and they had who' been thrown into the
[1:00:25] lion's den apparently this was something
[1:00:27] they likeed to
[1:00:28] do and these Lions had an appetite for
[1:00:32] human flesh
[1:00:34] right amen and when they saw Daniel
[1:00:38] there against the wall nowhere to
[1:00:40] go amen I said look out gums here he
[1:00:44] comes and when the hungry lies coming
[1:00:47] towards Daniel met
[1:00:49] faith faith locked their jaws the
[1:00:53] prophet said when the the pillar of fire
[1:00:55] stood between Daniel and the Lions the
[1:00:57] Lions went off and meowed like kittens
[1:00:59] yes and laid down by faith the Unseen
[1:01:03] Daniel wasn't afraid of the Lions now I
[1:01:06] don't know if you studied lies or not
[1:01:07] but do you know that a lion a wild lion
[1:01:10] can roar and his Roar can be heard
[1:01:12] between five and seven miles
[1:01:16] away I forget I think a l Roar is
[1:01:19] something like 114 decimals I believe it
[1:01:22] is I may be wrong about that but it's
[1:01:24] greater than 100 I do know that the Roar
[1:01:27] of the lon the prophet of God said you
[1:01:28] never feel the Lion's bite it's Roar
[1:01:31] scares you to death before it ever gets
[1:01:33] to you so the lon whose voice can be
[1:01:36] heard seven miles away met faith it went
[1:01:40] from a
[1:01:41] roar do
[1:01:43] meow
[1:01:45] meow
[1:01:47] meow when hungry lines met Faith they
[1:01:52] meowed like kittens
[1:01:54] with a woman with a blood
[1:01:58] issue 12 years of
[1:02:01] bleeding and it would not
[1:02:06] stop spit all her
[1:02:09] money and not only that but the
[1:02:12] humiliation of having to go into the
[1:02:15] village and to yell
[1:02:18] unclean
[1:02:20] unclean
[1:02:22] unclean 12
[1:02:24] long
[1:02:27] years and the
[1:02:29] bleeding would not
[1:02:32] stop but she saw
[1:02:34] Jesus and pressing through the crowd she
[1:02:37] believed that Jesus was the Christ and
[1:02:40] she said if I can only touch the Hy of
[1:02:44] his garbage she believed if she touched
[1:02:46] him she'd get what she asked for amen
[1:02:49] and she slipped through the crowd and
[1:02:50] she reached over notice she must have
[1:02:52] been small in stature
[1:02:54] because the Bible said she didn't touch
[1:02:56] his shoulder she didn't touch his
[1:03:00] elbow but she slipped through the crowd
[1:03:02] she probably even had maybe to get in
[1:03:04] between their legs and just touch the
[1:03:07] hym
[1:03:09] right as he passed
[1:03:13] by just touched the
[1:03:15] hym of His
[1:03:19] Garment but she believed if she touched
[1:03:22] him she'd get what she asked for
[1:03:26] believing that it would happen notice
[1:03:29] think about this oh God this is so good
[1:03:33] think about this Jesus didn't say to her
[1:03:36] if you touch my garment you'll get
[1:03:38] well Peter didn't say listen listen to
[1:03:41] me ma'am I i' I've been with him I've
[1:03:42] been with his ministry I know how it
[1:03:44] operates touch His Garment touch His
[1:03:46] Garment you'll get what you need Jesus
[1:03:49] didn't say it Peter didn't say it who
[1:03:52] said if you'll touch the hym of his gar
[1:03:54] it if I could but touch the who said
[1:03:56] that she
[1:03:58] did and faith that he was the Christ yes
[1:04:04] brought her own words into manifestation
[1:04:07] and this do you know what her name was
[1:04:09] we don't even know her name but her
[1:04:11] faith and her words her words became the
[1:04:14] very word of God we read
[1:04:18] about this woman that's okay but that
[1:04:21] cell phone saying amen it's all right
[1:04:23] think about
[1:04:24] This Woman's faith not Peter not Jesus
[1:04:27] she said that and she brought her faith
[1:04:29] brought her own words into manifestation
[1:04:32] and if her faith can bring her words
[1:04:34] into manifestation your faith can bring
[1:04:36] your words into manifestation when you
[1:04:38] say he's my healer he's my deliverer
[1:04:40] he's my strength he's my joy he's my
[1:04:43] peace Hallelujah he's the answer to
[1:04:45] every problem that I
[1:04:47] have her faith that he was the Christ
[1:04:50] brought her own words into manifestation
[1:04:52] and when a blood issue that eluded the
[1:04:54] doctors for 12 years met Faith the
[1:04:58] bleeding stopped because Faith Masters
[1:05:02] every circumstance amen think of Joshua
[1:05:07] God told Joshua to March around the
[1:05:10] walls of Jericho and they would fall
[1:05:13] before him now the walls of Jericho they
[1:05:16] said that you could run chariot races
[1:05:18] around the top of them and them walls
[1:05:20] them big walls they estimate they was
[1:05:23] 46t
[1:05:24] high and 80 foot
[1:05:29] thick amen matter of fact these walls
[1:05:32] are so wide and so thick that if you
[1:05:35] remember right Bible readers know that
[1:05:37] rahab's house was built on top of the
[1:05:42] wall and God said to Joshua go up there
[1:05:45] March around so many times sound a
[1:05:48] trumpet let out a shout and the walls
[1:05:52] are going to fall down
[1:06:00] you want
[1:06:01] us to go up there March around the walls
[1:06:06] blow a
[1:06:08] trumpet let out a shout and the walls
[1:06:12] are going to fall
[1:06:15] down now I'm telling you that's about
[1:06:18] the most ridiculous thing to the carnal
[1:06:19] mind that you've ever heard of in your
[1:06:21] life some of you didn't even amen
[1:06:26] it
[1:06:28] 46t 80 foot thick and you want us to
[1:06:31] March blow a trumpet and shout and
[1:06:35] they're going to fall down
[1:06:38] amen and he asked us just to believe
[1:06:40] that he's a Healer
[1:06:46] amen you want to bring a Wrecking
[1:06:50] Bar
[1:06:53] backo
[1:06:55] bulldozzer
[1:06:57] case a dynamite that'll bring her
[1:07:00] down no March blow a trumpet and Shout
[1:07:07] am just obedience oh God just obedience
[1:07:11] to my word that's all you
[1:07:14] need well brother D I don't understand
[1:07:16] the MRI you don't have to understand it
[1:07:18] I don't understand you don't have to
[1:07:20] understand the X-ray just obedience to
[1:07:23] his word it's all we
[1:07:26] need so silly to the carnal mind but the
[1:07:30] river I found this the other day was so
[1:07:31] good Joshua the prophet said knowing how
[1:07:34] thick the walls was because he built
[1:07:36] plenty of walls down in Egypt he knew
[1:07:38] the cement that was in him he knew how
[1:07:40] tight they were he knew he knew how
[1:07:42] strong they were he knew that they ran
[1:07:44] chariot races around the top of them and
[1:07:45] even built houses on the top of it but
[1:07:48] he did not lean to his own
[1:07:51] understanding but he believed what God
[1:07:53] Said was the truth and he obeyed the
[1:07:55] word and when he obeyed God's word the
[1:07:58] walls will fall down maybe you feel like
[1:08:00] you're in trapped tonight maybe you feel
[1:08:01] like the walls will all around you but
[1:08:03] if you'll just believe God's word the
[1:08:06] walls will fall
[1:08:10] down Joshua looked at the
[1:08:12] Unseen he walked around the walls
[1:08:15] believing it would happen you see it all
[1:08:18] depends on what you're looking at
[1:08:22] yes you take the children of Israel came
[1:08:25] out of Egypt got to the Red Sea God
[1:08:28] parted the Red Sea after destroying
[1:08:31] every Egyptian God is that not right the
[1:08:34] things that he done down in Egypt and
[1:08:36] here they come up to the Red Sea God
[1:08:38] parted the sea and they went over on dry
[1:08:41] ground right grabbed the tambourines
[1:08:44] shouted and run up and down the bank
[1:08:45] shouting screaming
[1:08:48] dancing went out into the desert three
[1:08:50] days and all the shouting screaming and
[1:08:53] dancing
[1:08:56] turn to what are we going to
[1:08:58] drink how soon the Red Sea
[1:09:01] Revival
[1:09:05] died and there was out there with no
[1:09:07] water and the kids won't no know how do
[1:09:09] you can't drink that it's it's bitter
[1:09:11] it's bitter water why would he do
[1:09:14] that but you see if he can fix one water
[1:09:17] problem can he fix all water problems if
[1:09:20] he fixed the Red Sea that was a water
[1:09:22] problem was it not if he fixed that one
[1:09:24] couldn't he fix this one and you see
[1:09:27] here's the thing I'm trying to get you
[1:09:28] to understand that what did they do he
[1:09:30] Moses cried out to God God gave him the
[1:09:33] revelation of a tree and he cut the tree
[1:09:35] down and threw it into the bitter water
[1:09:37] and The Bitter Water became sweet what
[1:09:40] are you saying I'm simply saying this
[1:09:42] that tree was growing there while they
[1:09:43] were still in Egypt the answer to the
[1:09:46] problem was there before they ever knew
[1:09:48] they had a problem and the answer to
[1:09:51] your problem has been here all the time
[1:09:58] amen I got a ticket down in Louisiana

[1:11:16] anything else he talked the whole time
[1:11:19] he was so
[1:11:20] excited and after we shook hands and
[1:11:22] left I got the thinking brother
[1:11:24] John that several months before that man
[1:11:28] ever knew he had a
[1:11:30] question God didn't had the answer
[1:11:33] sitting beside

[1:11:39] Lord and before they ever knew they had
[1:11:42] the bitter water God done have the
[1:11:46] answer the answer to every problem you
[1:11:48] have has been here the whole time amen
[1:11:53] he looked at the Unseen he walked around
[1:11:55] the walls believing it would happen it
[1:11:58] all depends on what you're looking at
[1:12:00] you see Satan think about this Satan
[1:12:02] does not care for you to see the bars on
[1:12:05] your sail
[1:12:06] door he loves to put every one of us in
[1:12:09] prison right and he don't care if you
[1:12:12] see the bars on your door of your prison
[1:12:14] cell but what the devil doesn't want you
[1:12:16] to see is that door is open oh God
[1:12:21] Amen it don't matter how many bars is
[1:12:24] around you if the doors open just walk
[1:12:27] out amen amen hallelujah amen and when
[1:12:33] walls 46 foot high 80 foot thick met
[1:12:37] Faith the walls came down gyrus his
[1:12:40] daughter laid dead the mourners gathered
[1:12:42] to mourn and said trouble not the master
[1:12:45] anymore your little girl is dead right
[1:12:48] there's something so final about the
[1:12:50] word dead but you see Jesus gave gyrus
[1:12:55] the remedy to every bad report when he
[1:13:00] touched him on the shoulder and he said
[1:13:02] two words
[1:13:04] only
[1:13:06] believe that's the answer to every
[1:13:09] problem we have what about my children
[1:13:12] only believe what about my health only
[1:13:14] what about my only
[1:13:17] believe amen Jesus standing at the grave
[1:13:20] of Lazarus a man that had been dead 4
[1:13:23] days corruption had done set in his
[1:13:25] sister even said Lord he stinks right
[1:13:30] but when a dead man Hallelujah met a man
[1:13:34] who had faith in what the word said he
[1:13:36] was and when he cried Lazarus come forth
[1:13:39] death gave way to
[1:13:41] life when the maniac of gadera demons
[1:13:44] had him bound the Bible said he lived
[1:13:46] among the tubs and he cut himself he was
[1:13:48] a cutter they still have him today he
[1:13:50] cut himself with stones and they tried
[1:13:52] to chain him and they tried to tame him
[1:13:54] but he would break the chains and he
[1:13:56] would break the feathers and no man
[1:13:58] could tame this man but what man could
[1:14:00] not do Faith could
[1:14:03] do what brought Jesus to the Gans it
[1:14:07] wasn't the mayor of the city it wasn't
[1:14:10] an organization that invited him it
[1:14:12] wasn't the pig Farmers they never asked
[1:14:14] him to come if you'll read your Bible
[1:14:16] they asked him to
[1:14:18] leave who invited who invited Jesus he
[1:14:22] was on the other side out of the
[1:14:24] sea who invited him to the
[1:14:28] Gans it was a maniac who was living in
[1:14:31] the tombs cutting his flesh ripping off
[1:14:34] his clothes but he wanted help amen this
[1:14:38] needy Soul was crying out for
[1:14:40] deliverance and Jesus on the other side
[1:14:43] of the sea heard his invite of faith and
[1:14:46] Jesus cross the stormy sea to get to him
[1:14:49] and he's the same one tonight he will
[1:14:52] come from glory to one needy Soul
[1:14:54] sitting in this humble church tonight
[1:14:58] he'll ever time come to where he's
[1:15:00] wanted he will every time come to where
[1:15:03] he's wanted but he will never come to
[1:15:05] where he's doubted so if you're doubting
[1:15:08] him he will never be at your door well
[1:15:11] my problem's too bad and the doctor says
[1:15:13] it's the worst case as long as you
[1:15:16] believe that he'll never come to your
[1:15:19] door and look I'm not belittling doctors
[1:15:21] none at all I worked with doctor for 17
[1:15:24] years I was a surgery I did thousands of
[1:15:26] operations with doctors but I do know
[1:15:29] doctors make
[1:15:32] mistakes and I do know for a
[1:15:35] fact that sometimes their diagnosis is
[1:15:38] completely
[1:15:41] wrong you said brother you go to doctor
[1:15:43] sure if I'm sick I go to the doctor you
[1:15:45] should too but when the doctor says he
[1:15:47] can't help me I know somebody who
[1:15:50] can is that all right but think about it
[1:15:54] doctors for example there's a man down
[1:15:56] home down in Greenville Tennessee he was
[1:15:57] a cow can can I have just a few more
[1:15:59] minutes he he he he he had a farm a cow
[1:16:02] farm and he went in for a test a PSA
[1:16:04] test you know for a prostate and they
[1:16:06] called him and said you your PSA level's
[1:16:08] really high it's up like 50 something 54
[1:16:10] something like that you've got prostate
[1:16:12] cancer you need to come
[1:16:13] in and he said I've got a dairy farm
[1:16:16] I've got cows I got responsibility said
[1:16:18] give me a few days to get get some
[1:16:19] things worked out they said well don't
[1:16:21] wait too long we need to get started on
[1:16:22] this you prostate cancer so the man
[1:16:25] writes a note to his wife and his family
[1:16:28] and he said I'd rather die at my own
[1:16:30] hand than die of prostate cancer and he
[1:16:32] went out in the middle of his farm and
[1:16:34] took a gun and shot
[1:16:36] himself and they buried the poor man but
[1:16:40] it was only like a week after the
[1:16:42] funeral that the hospital called and
[1:16:44] said they made a terrible mistake the
[1:16:46] lab report that was on his chart
[1:16:48] belonged to another
[1:16:50] man he had no cancer at all but you see
[1:16:53] he believed the doctor's
[1:16:56] report what are you saying I'm simply
[1:16:57] saying this sometimes doctors are
[1:17:00] absolutely 100% correct and sometimes
[1:17:05] they're
[1:17:06] wrong but God's word is 100
[1:17:10] times Amen brother said God will keep
[1:17:13] his word 100 times out of a
[1:17:18] 100 well
[1:17:19] Glory thank you
[1:17:22] Lord if you're doubting he'll never be
[1:17:24] at your door but if you love him and
[1:17:26] want him he'll come anytime you call for
[1:17:29] him to come he's ready to
[1:17:34] come he heard this maniac's Cry of faith
[1:17:37] and if he heard his Cry of Faith he'll
[1:17:39] hear your cry of Faith you see that
[1:17:42] great storm could not stop Jesus from
[1:17:45] coming it could not drowned out the Cry
[1:17:48] of Faith let me say tonight there is
[1:17:50] nothing that Satan has that can stop
[1:17:52] faith Faith from touching Jesus amen
[1:17:56] don't we sing that song Touching Jesus
[1:17:59] is all that really matters and then your
[1:18:02] life will never be the same there's only
[1:18:08] one way to touch him you must believe
[1:18:12] when you call on his
[1:18:16] name When Faith from an honest heart
[1:18:19] meets God them cogs just comes together
[1:18:22] like that something has to take place I
[1:18:25] challenge this audience tonight in the
[1:18:26] name of Jesus Christ let your faith
[1:18:28] connect with God like that and in a few
[1:18:30] minutes you'll have another Pentecost
[1:18:32] there'll be such a Revival breakout in
[1:18:34] this town there won't be enough cops in
[1:18:36] the country to keep them down that's
[1:18:37] right there'll be a real Revival when
[1:18:40] your faith meets
[1:18:43] God now let me have can I have just a
[1:18:45] few more
[1:18:47] minutes hang on to your false teeth now
[1:18:49] this is a good one you don't go to hell
[1:18:52] because you're a
[1:18:57] sinner you don't go to hell because
[1:18:59] you're a sinner you go to hell because
[1:19:01] you refus to accept the way away from
[1:19:03] hell you see we couldn't help how we was
[1:19:06] born we come into the world speaking
[1:19:08] lies shaped in iniquity that's what the
[1:19:09] Bible says every one of us come through
[1:19:11] a fallen State without a choice I had if
[1:19:14] I had a choice I would have never come
[1:19:15] this way would
[1:19:18] you I would have come God's perfect way
[1:19:21] would you
[1:19:23] but we had no choice so God don't
[1:19:25] condemn us because we had no choice we
[1:19:27] was born this way he condemns us because
[1:19:29] a way was provided to come away from
[1:19:31] that and we won't accept
[1:19:34] it there's a bypass from hell and Christ
[1:19:37] is that bypass there's a bypass from
[1:19:39] sickness a quick death a premature grave
[1:19:41] and that's through Christ now you sinned
[1:19:43] in the beginning and Christ died for
[1:19:45] your sins therefore he saved you when he
[1:19:47] died he saved you and he healed you when
[1:19:50] he died for he took your place now now
[1:19:53] all you have to do is accept it by faith
[1:19:55] and you'll receive it see what I mean
[1:19:57] now there's nothing more to be done
[1:19:59] because your healing is already paid for
[1:20:01] you can have it right this afternoon you
[1:20:03] can have it right now this very minute
[1:20:06] when you believe it amen when your faith
[1:20:08] meets God's
[1:20:10] requirement it's already paid for you
[1:20:13] can have it right now this very minute
[1:20:16] it's already paid for now the other day
[1:20:19] me and my wife and Jessica was in a was
[1:20:21] in a restaurant
[1:20:24] and the waitress come by and she said
[1:20:25] will there be anything else I said ' no
[1:20:27] ma'am just just the bill and she
[1:20:29] saidwell somebody saw you in here and
[1:20:32] they paid for your
[1:20:36] lunch she said so if there's nothing
[1:20:38] left if there's nothing else you can go
[1:20:41] I said well let me leave the tip she
[1:20:43] said no they took care of the tip too
[1:20:45] it's all been took care of Amen so if
[1:20:48] there's nothing else you can go now I
[1:20:51] can do one or two things I could say
[1:20:54] ma'am I don't see nobody in this
[1:20:56] restaurant that I know are you sure it's
[1:21:00] my table maybe it's somebody else I
[1:21:03] could have argued I could have debated I
[1:21:06] could have said I'm not
[1:21:07] worthy I could have said well I don't
[1:21:09] know about that you just want me to go
[1:21:11] out that door and go ding ding ding he
[1:21:12] stole a
[1:21:13] [Applause]
[1:21:15] steak or I could have accepted that
[1:21:20] someone cared enough for me to buy my
[1:21:23] meal and I could walk out thinking
[1:21:27] whoever it was that done
[1:21:29] it now if that's true for a steak dinner
[1:21:32] it's also true for what I'm telling you
[1:21:35] right
[1:21:36] now we can well I'm not worthy enough
[1:21:38] none of us is worthy
[1:21:40] enough but he's already done it and all
[1:21:43] he asked us to do was to
[1:21:45] believe it's already been paid for right
[1:21:49] just accept it amen it's I remember
[1:21:53] years ago I was in Romania a girl a
[1:21:55] young girl I think she's about 18 she
[1:21:57] she was she' had no hip she born without
[1:21:59] a hip she was on a crutch and she come
[1:22:01] up on a Friday night brother Kenny capap
[1:22:03] was preaching the morning Services I was
[1:22:04] preaching the night services and she
[1:22:06] come up on a Friday night and she wanted
[1:22:07] to repent of her
[1:22:09] sins and she's on this crutch and she
[1:22:11] tried to work this leg and get down on
[1:22:13] her knees and and I said no no no sis
[1:22:15] you don't have I said you can stand
[1:22:16] right here and accept Christ as your
[1:22:17] savior you don't have to get on your
[1:22:19] knees but she wanted to and she worked
[1:22:22] work that leg till she got down on her
[1:22:26] knees to repent and I thought my God how
[1:22:28] many people with two good knees will
[1:22:30] never
[1:22:32] bow and we prayed for her and she went
[1:22:34] out the next day on a Saturday after the
[1:22:36] service and went in an icy River with
[1:22:40] that crutch and was baptized in Jesus
[1:22:43] name amen and she came back on Saturday
[1:22:45] night and she came up to the altar on
[1:22:47] that crutch and she said I want God to
[1:22:49] heal
[1:22:50] me beautiful she said I want to be I
[1:22:54] want to be a wife I want to have
[1:22:56] children she said but who would marry me
[1:22:58] like
[1:23:00] this and I said sis you know what I do
[1:23:02] if I was you I quit asking God to heal
[1:23:05] me and I start thanking him for healing
[1:23:08] me I said everywhere you go you just
[1:23:10] thank God for healing you I said write
[1:23:12] it on your mirror and when you get up in
[1:23:14] the morning and you wash your face and
[1:23:16] you see it in the mirror take you some
[1:23:17] soap Rite it on your mirror thank God
[1:23:19] for healing me when you go to bed at
[1:23:22] night thank God for healing me and I
[1:23:25] said when God heals you I said you take
[1:23:26] this handkerchief and when God heals you
[1:23:28] you send it back to me as a testimony of
[1:23:30] what he done for you three years went by
[1:23:35] and I get an email from a girl named
[1:23:38] Christina who got my ID dress off of
[1:23:40] another brother she said brother Daryl
[1:23:42] I've been trying to find you she said I
[1:23:44] did what you told me to do said I went
[1:23:46] everywhere testifying of my healing and
[1:23:49] she said it got so bad that my parents
[1:23:50] said I want you to quit testifying
[1:23:52] because you're no better you're bearing
[1:23:54] a reproach upon the family she said but
[1:23:55] I didn't quit I didn't listen to my mom
[1:23:57] and daddy brother Daryl I kept
[1:23:59] testifying and she said I was in the
[1:24:01] young people's meet and said I stood up
[1:24:03] and I said I want to thank God for
[1:24:04] healing my hip and she said one of my
[1:24:06] friends I heard him say here she goes
[1:24:08] again and she said brother darl when I
[1:24:10] said that my hip popped amen and I laid
[1:24:14] down the crutch and I walked out of the
[1:24:16] church praise the Lord
[1:24:19] amen
[1:24:21] amen he's the same yesterday today and
[1:24:25] forever just be found believe in
[1:24:28] me sometimes I think we just should just
[1:24:31] start thanking him for it thank you for
[1:24:34] your goodness thank you for your mercy
[1:24:36] thank you for saving my children thank
[1:24:37] you for the Revival Lord amen can I look
[1:24:42] at this just before we close this oh my
[1:24:45] just just just about five more minutes I
[1:24:48] want to look at this right here I want
[1:24:50] to look right fast at at hope versus
[1:24:53] faith and I'll hurry now hope will agree
[1:24:57] with the Bible here's what we're looking
[1:24:59] at hope versus Faith now hope will agree
[1:25:01] with the Bible hope will say it's true
[1:25:05] hope will say I believe every bit of it
[1:25:08] hope will say I believe that's the word
[1:25:10] of God hope will say I believe that God
[1:25:12] will keep his promise hope believes all
[1:25:15] of
[1:25:16] that but then hope says now I believe
[1:25:19] that God will heal but look at my
[1:25:21] condition
[1:25:23] that's the difference hope believes
[1:25:26] everything that Faith believes but when
[1:25:28] hope sees the eye or hope sees the
[1:25:31] situation amen then it loses its
[1:25:36] theme that's what hope does Hope
[1:25:39] believes all that but then it says I
[1:25:42] believe God will heal but look at my
[1:25:45] condition and you can ask you believe
[1:25:46] God's A Healer everybody in the church
[1:25:47] will raise their hand you believe God
[1:25:48] will heal you and there's always a
[1:25:51] hesitancy but you've got to believe that
[1:25:53] there's only one person in Flint
[1:25:54] Michigan that God will heal it's you
[1:25:57] amen it's got to be a personal
[1:26:00] revelation that's what hope does but
[1:26:02] faith faith don't look at that faith
[1:26:05] comes around and says I don't care
[1:26:06] nothing about conditions God said so and
[1:26:08] it's mine see Faith's Burly as I once
[1:26:10] said faith has hair on his chest and
[1:26:12] when it stands up pulls its big muscles
[1:26:14] out everything else vanishes away it
[1:26:16] just flies away when Faith really takes
[1:26:18] hold nothing else stands
[1:26:23] when you believe it and take God at his
[1:26:25] word and say it so and believe it so God
[1:26:29] will bring it to
[1:26:31] pass Jesus promised he would heal us ask
[1:26:35] anything in my name and I'll do it when
[1:26:37] you pray believe that you receive it and
[1:26:39] you shall have what you asked for it's
[1:26:41] yours believe it comes to pass well
[1:26:44] brother darl I prayed and nothing
[1:26:45] happened you mean you've been waiting
[1:26:47] one day and nothing's happened Abraham
[1:26:49] waited 25 years amen
[1:26:53] amen remember if we pray and ask God
[1:26:55] sincerely this church we're a unit we're
[1:26:58] together if we ask God sincerely then
[1:27:01] God's obligated to take care of what we
[1:27:03] ask for if you ask anything in my name
[1:27:06] I'll do it is that the truth then take
[1:27:08] your faith and meet whatever it is
[1:27:11] that's bothering you in Jesus name you
[1:27:15] see when a demon possessed man who lived
[1:27:16] among the tombs and cut himself day and
[1:27:19] night when the bondage of chains and the
[1:27:21] afflictions met The Cry of Faith freedom
[1:27:23] and deliverance came when snake venom
[1:27:26] met Faith the poison was gone when a
[1:27:28] line met faith it purred like a
[1:27:35] kitten when fire met Faith the Heat and
[1:27:37] smoke was annihilated When Death met
[1:27:40] Faith Life came forth when sickness met
[1:27:43] Faith the bleeding stopped when walls
[1:27:45] met Faith they fell down when bondage
[1:27:47] met Faith the chains were broke if
[1:27:49] that's true friends if that's true for
[1:27:51] them then is it not true for us then I
[1:27:53] ask you tonight as we close whatever it
[1:27:56] is that's bothering you whatever is in
[1:27:57] your way whatever the circumstance may
[1:27:59] be whatever the bondage is the sickness
[1:28:02] is the fear is whatever it is what's
[1:28:04] going to happen when it meets your faith
[1:28:08] when it met their faith look what God
[1:28:09] done and that same God is here tonight
[1:28:11] and if your faith meets that challenge
[1:28:13] God will do for you what he did for them
[1:28:16] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:28:19] forever amen when you believe what the
[1:28:22] word says about you and have faith in
[1:28:23] The God Who made the promise the Seed of
[1:28:26] Abraham possesses the gates of their
[1:28:29] enemies amen let me say this sometimes
[1:28:33] we get in our
[1:28:34] minds a David and a Daniel and a Moses
[1:28:39] and we make these people some kind of a
[1:28:41] super
[1:28:43] being just like gono I can say the name
[1:28:46] gono to you and automatically you'll
[1:28:49] think of an Indian on a horse with
[1:28:51] feathers and flute music and a Warrior
[1:28:55] jono when I asked in the Army we yelled
[1:28:57] his name before they jumped out of
[1:28:58] airplanes
[1:29:01] gono you think of a warrior but how many
[1:29:04] knows jono drove a car do you know that
[1:29:08] you know Dr Mo rode a ferris
[1:29:10] wheel didn't know
[1:29:12] that you know Dr Mo rode in
[1:29:14] inaugurational
[1:29:19] parade I guess not
[1:29:22] what are you saying I'm simply saying
[1:29:23] this we get an image sometime in our
[1:29:25] mind of somebody but in reality jono was
[1:29:28] just a man fighting for his god-given
[1:29:30] rights he was a man just like me and you
[1:29:33] drove a car wro wore a top hat rode in a
[1:29:37] parade yes sir and David and Daniel and
[1:29:40] Moses they were just like me and you but
[1:29:42] they believed God for the word for their
[1:29:44] day and when they believed the god of
[1:29:46] their day and his word god did great
[1:29:48] things among them and if that same God
[1:29:50] can get us to believe the word for our
[1:29:52] day he can do great things among us
[1:29:56] what's going to happen when whatever it
[1:29:58] is that's bothering you meets your
[1:30:01] faith said brother Dar what if I let it
[1:30:03] go and it won't happen it'll never
[1:30:05] happen with that
[1:30:06] attitude just let the sling slot go the
