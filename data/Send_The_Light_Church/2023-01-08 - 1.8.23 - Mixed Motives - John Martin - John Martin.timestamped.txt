[32:16] that we have the calendars out there's
[32:18] just been so much going on that we
[32:20] forgot to get the calendars out last

[32:25] that you can take a a few of each and
[32:28] share them with others
[32:30] and when those run out we have more in
[32:32] the back so I would say use them as a
[32:36] tool
[32:37] to invite somebody to church
[32:41] that's what they're there for and I hope
[32:43] that they'll be a blessing every year
[32:45] for many years brother Bill Sanchez many
[32:48] of you know him he always contacts us
[32:51] and says can you send out some more of
[32:53] those calendars to our church so their
[32:56] Church receives about 40 or 50 of them
[32:59] and they just love them
[33:01] uh just nice having a scripture for the
[33:03] day and

[34:54] need father
[34:55] and we commit them to you that you give
[34:58] them the word of life as well father we
[35:01] love you we thank you for these things
[35:02] and we ask them in Jesus Christ's name
[35:05] amen amen Matthew chapter 15 starting
[35:09] with verse number one
[35:11] then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees
[35:15] which were of Jerusalem saying why do
[35:18] thy disciples transgress the tradition
[35:21] of the elders
[35:23] for they wash not their hands
[35:26] when they eat bread
[35:29] but he answered and said unto them
[35:32] why do you also transgress the
[35:34] Commandment of God by your tradition
[35:38] for God commanded saying honor thy
[35:40] father and mother
[35:41] and he that curseth father or mother let
[35:44] him die
[35:46] the death
[35:48] but ye say
[35:50] whosoever shall say to his father or his
[35:53] mother
[35:55] I am a gift by whatsoever thou mayest be
[35:59] profited by me
[36:02] and on Earth not his father
[36:05] or his mother
[36:07] he shall be free thus
[36:11] have he made the Commandment of God of
[36:13] none effect by your tradition
[36:15] ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah's prophesy
[36:20] of you saying this people drawth nigh
[36:23] unto me with their mouth
[36:25] he honored me with their lips
[36:28] but their heart is far from me
[36:31] in vain they do worship me teaching for
[36:34] doctrines the Commandments of men
[36:37] amen God bless you may God add the his
[36:41] Revelation to the word to our hearts
[36:43] today
[36:44] we uh you may be seated you may be
[36:47] seated
[36:49] um
[36:51] I'm thinking this won't be a typical
[36:54] service but that's okay
[36:56] that's okay I think that last song that
[36:59] we we were singing there when I look
[37:02] into your Holiness was like the perfect
[37:04] song to for for this coming into this uh
[37:09] uh the word here today because we want
[37:12] to take our text there from verse number
[37:14] eight this people draw nine to me with
[37:16] their mouth and honored with me with
[37:18] their lips but their heart is far from
[37:20] me
[37:22] so we're going to be getting a little
[37:24] it's not a deep subject it's just a
[37:27] subject we don't think about very much
[37:30] so the these people even though
[37:33] they were drawing nigh to God they came
[37:35] to church they were drawing now to God
[37:37] with their mouth they were worshiping
[37:39] but their heart was in a different
[37:41] location
[37:42] so we can we can honor the Lord with
[37:45] songs with praises
[37:48] yet our heart may not be all the way in
[37:51] it
[37:52] and Jesus called this type of worship
[37:54] Vain and hypocritical
[37:58] Jesus often discerned those believers
[38:01] who acted religious but they really
[38:03] weren't in love with God
[38:05] they they were in love with the word
[38:07] and Jesus brought a clear teaching on
[38:11] the sin that really starts in the heart
[38:13] of man and not on the outside brother
[38:17] Branham had taught us that those were
[38:19] just attributes of unbelief but but
[38:22] truly it all uh sin starts in the heart
[38:26] when we disbelieve
[38:29] um in God's perfect will amen
[38:33] what I want to take away from these
[38:35] scriptures here is that we can be there
[38:38] can be a separation between saying
[38:41] things and doing things
[38:43] and what's really going on inside of us
[38:47] and uh even from an early age
[38:50] children learn to hide
[38:54] uh
[38:55] uh hide their feelings hide what they're
[38:57] doing
[38:59] uh they don't you know want to get
[39:02] caught
[39:04] um and there are various reasons that we
[39:06] hide things
[39:09] often people fear what others might say
[39:11] or do if they knew their true thoughts
[39:14] or fear what others might think of them
[39:18] and fear often motivates people to hide
[39:21] how they really feel
[39:24] so we just kind of build this shell
[39:26] around us
[39:28] an example of that is if a person was
[39:31] being judged
[39:33] uh if a person was going to be
[39:35] judgmental towards somebody like I don't
[39:39] feel that what they did was of the Lord
[39:41] was right
[39:42] but you know I'm not going to say
[39:44] anything I'm not going to do anything
[39:46] because I don't want them to think
[39:49] something different of me but you don't
[39:51] have a problem saying it to somebody
[39:52] else
[39:55] see
[39:57] it's a pretense
[39:59] or someone really doesn't care about
[40:01] somebody but you don't want that person
[40:03] to know about it when you're talking to
[40:05] them
[40:09] you can say there's many reasons for
[40:11] people not to be genuine with others
[40:14] and be no different than coming into
[40:16] church and acting differently when our
[40:18] heart really wasn't there
[40:21] are you with me that's what what
[40:23] happened here in these scriptures so I'd
[40:25] like to title this message this morning
[40:27] mixed motives
[40:30] and for a subject thought
[40:32] why do we do what we do so I just want
[40:35] to provoke us to be thinking about
[40:37] something that we don't often do and
[40:39] that's checking our emotives or thinking
[40:43] that our motives are okay
[40:46] um like it doesn't matter what's
[40:48] Happening Here
[40:50] because what's going on here is between
[40:52] me and God or me and myself and what I
[40:55] just play out here is between me and
[40:57] another person
[40:59] and
[41:00] yeah
[41:01] it's not right
[41:05] these people had enough desire for God
[41:08] to go to church to worship to express
[41:11] themselves outwardly to God
[41:14] but they had a greater desire inside
[41:17] their heart for something different
[41:20] a lot of times we find ourselves doing
[41:22] things because oh it's
[41:24] because it's Sunday we got to do it we
[41:27] got to go to church we got to read our
[41:29] Bible got to pray got you got got you
[41:31] got to say sorry oh sorry
[41:34] right but the heart isn't there
[41:39] so it they had a desire to go to church
[41:42] they had a desire to worship
[41:45] but their heart was somewhere else we
[41:47] can see that there could there's two
[41:48] motives there
[41:49] there's a mixed motives
[41:55] they were out in the bar
[41:59] they came to church they worshiped but
[42:02] their heart wasn't where their worship
[42:03] was
[42:05] you know it's okay if you get into the
[42:07] message it'll help us to get just a
[42:09] little bit more out of it now here I
[42:11] want to say this
[42:13] all we want to do today is we want to
[42:15] break down looking at our motives more
[42:17] we want to leave here understanding that
[42:20] it is really important to check our
[42:21] motives which we don't do very often why
[42:24] because every man is right in his own
[42:25] eyes and if every man's right in his own
[42:27] eyes why would he have a need to check
[42:28] his motive
[42:30] but it's not true
[42:34] our motives can be mixed
[42:36] because our desires can be mixed
[42:40] I'm doing this because but what are the
[42:43] other reasons you're doing this
[42:46] see the mixed motives here
[42:48] remember the angel of the Lord telling
[42:51] brother Brandon to remind the people
[42:53] that their thoughts that their their
[42:56] thoughts speak louder in heaven than
[43:00] their words do here on the Earth
[43:02] so God is you know no matter what we're
[43:05] saying outwardly here God is really
[43:07] zooming in on the heart right
[43:10] if Satan can get us to mix our motives
[43:13] now notice this to mix our motives
[43:16] things will become unclear to what's
[43:19] really going on inside of us see Satan
[43:22] is the author of confusion and he don't
[43:24] really want you to know when your heart
[43:25] is wrong
[43:27] he don't want you to know when when
[43:29] something isn't just right there because
[43:32] then there's a chance that you'll repent
[43:33] and get right
[43:35] so he wants it to kind of stay in a
[43:38] mixed state of just
[43:40] um a little this a little that and
[43:42] nobody really knows and the thing is
[43:45] you're not right
[43:48] and and Satan don't want you to know
[43:50] that he wants you to feel you know why
[43:52] why is every man right in his own eyes
[43:54] because that's the nature he's born with
[43:57] if a little child wants a cookie and and
[43:59] mama says uh don't take the cookie and
[44:02] he takes the cookie and Mom said did you
[44:04] take the cookie and he says no I didn't
[44:06] take the cookie that that boy no matter
[44:10] how much if you'll a long period of time
[44:13] of that happening that boy will
[44:16] literally think or that girl will
[44:18] actually think they're right taking that
[44:19] cookie because something inside of him
[44:21] says they want the cookie what they want
[44:24] is right
[44:26] and that's what can happen to any of our
[44:28] consciences when we be when we begin to
[44:31] not be honest with what's going on
[44:33] inside of us we can become just
[44:36] uh
[44:37] uh so away from the realness of what
[44:41] actually Things Are
[44:45] now when there are two or more motives
[44:48] for doing something
[44:49] things will often Cloud the true reason
[44:52] of why we're doing things ever been
[44:55] asked why are you doing this
[44:58] and you give the reason that's
[45:01] acceptable to the person that you're
[45:03] talking to
[45:05] but there's another reason inside that
[45:07] you're really doing it are you with me
[45:11] okay who's excited for the word the word
[45:15] is going to help us
[45:19] we can just focus on the on the one that
[45:23] seems to be more favorable for us at the
[45:25] time
[45:27] but God always knows our true motives
[45:29] for things yeah
[45:31] now our motives need to be one
[45:35] one motive
[45:37] I'm saying this there could be many
[45:39] reasons
[45:40] of why this you're doing this and how it
[45:44] could benefit so on and so forth but
[45:46] there needs to be one motive it needs to
[45:48] be clear it needs to be decisive it
[45:50] needs to be direct
[45:53] none of this mix motives
[45:57] mixed Motors makes it hard I'm giving
[45:59] you this birthday gift this Christmas
[46:01] gift this gift because
[46:05] well
[46:07] look it
[46:09] when you receive a gift
[46:11] you want to know that that gift is for
[46:13] one reason because you're being loved
[46:16] somebody wants to give to you that is it
[46:19] no other reason
[46:23] obviously these people that were
[46:25] worshiping God I need to stay here
[46:27] because everything's not perfect yet
[46:30] um
[46:32] these people thought they were doing
[46:34] adequate for God
[46:36] in their worshiping coming to church and
[46:39] what they were doing kind of going
[46:40] through the motions they weren't
[46:42] concerned that their heart wasn't in the
[46:43] right place
[46:44] they weren't concerned that their motive
[46:46] wasn't in the right place
[46:49] our motives are very important
[46:52] they are the true desire of what's going
[46:55] on inside of us
[46:57] the definition of motive is a reason for
[47:01] doing something
[47:03] especially one that is hidden or not
[47:07] obvious
[47:08] so when we think you know what's the
[47:10] person's motive I mean if you you see
[47:13] somebody that they're going to rob a
[47:14] bank
[47:15] you know what their motive is
[47:17] they want the money
[47:20] it could be for different reasons but
[47:22] then there's things where you know
[47:24] people walk in the bank and
[47:28] before they rob the bank
[47:30] they're acting like they're just you
[47:32] know
[47:33] normal people until everybody gets set
[47:35] and everybody's in their position and
[47:36] they pull out their guns okay
[47:43] motives
[47:46] are not always right they're not always
[47:48] good
[47:50] the definition of objective
[47:53] is something towards which effort is
[47:57] being directed something toward which
[47:59] effort is being directed in AIM a goal
[48:02] and end of an action a strategy position
[48:05] to attain or a purpose to achieve
[48:10] so you know if this guy loses that'll
[48:15] get this guy in
[48:16] you understand it's that strategy
[48:23] I'm probably not going to be well liked
[48:25] after this message
[48:27] but that's okay I want to get us closer
[48:30] to God
[48:32] and you can be doing the right thing and
[48:34] have absolutely the wrong motive here's
[48:36] the biggest thing
[48:38] it looks like you know we're coming
[48:40] across a certain way or but really
[48:43] because our motive is wrong the motive
[48:46] has to be pure it has to be right
[48:49] if the devil can get us to have a wrong
[48:52] motive and do the right thing he has
[48:57] succeeded
[48:58] because somewhere it's going to come
[49:01] back and come out and just you know
[49:04] totally show that it wasn't love in her
[49:08] heart that was actually doing it
[49:11] if the motive is wrong
[49:15] you're right doesn't count
[49:17] in the sight of God that's remember that
[49:20] if your motive is wrong your right
[49:23] doesn't count in the sight of God
[49:26] it it it means nothing
[49:29] this is why it's so important that our
[49:32] motives are right
[49:35] it would be better if we did less good
[49:38] and our motives were more good
[49:41] come on
[49:45] because it's not about pleasing people
[49:48] not about pleasing family it's not about
[49:50] pleasing you know it's not about being
[49:53] men Pleasers
[49:54] and it's not about you know showing
[49:57] something even in in the church if I
[50:01] could say it like this these people were
[50:03] they didn't mind praying they didn't
[50:05] mind fasting they didn't mind this is
[50:06] what I'm doing for God that in my
[50:08] worshiping but their heart was in a
[50:10] different place
[50:11] right they were having Church Without
[50:13] God and not saying that any of us are
[50:15] doing that but we can I'm sure we've
[50:18] been guilty of it
[50:20] I'm sure we've been guilty of it but uh
[50:21] I'm not just I'm not preaching this
[50:23] because I feel that there's you know two
[50:25] people in here or five people or
[50:27] whatever it might be that's that's doing
[50:29] this it's not this the motive for this
[50:31] thing is because we need to start paying
[50:33] attention to our motives if we're really
[50:35] going to grow in Christ if we're going
[50:36] to come to the place that God wants us
[50:38] to be where we're just genuine
[50:39] Christians one to another
[50:42] and and worshiping God in spirit and
[50:44] Truth
[50:46] we've just we've got to be looking at
[50:49] our motives because if we're a human
[50:50] being all of our motives are not right
[50:54] true with me if you would to Luke
[50:55] chapter 3
[50:57] verse 2.
[50:59] Luke chapter 3 verse 2
[51:04] . there's a lot of scriptures in the
[51:07] Bible that help us to see
[51:10] these things and
[51:14] oh I don't know how many services we're
[51:17] going to have on this but I want us to
[51:19] be
[51:20] at the end of this I want us to be
[51:23] checking our Motors more
[51:26] ananiacin sapphias being
[51:29] um the high priest the word of God came
[51:32] unto John the son of Zacharias in the
[51:35] wilderness
[51:37] Caiaphas I should say and he came unto
[51:39] all the country about Jordan preaching
[51:42] the baptism of repentance for the
[51:44] remission of sins
[51:46] as it is written in the book of the
[51:48] words of isaiahs the Prophet saying the
[51:50] voice of one crying in the wilderness
[51:52] prepare ye the way of the Lord make his
[51:55] path straight
[51:56] every Valley shall be filled Every
[51:58] Mountain and Hills shall be brought low
[52:00] and the Crooked shall be made straight
[52:02] in the rough ways shall be made smooth
[52:05] and all the flesh shall see the
[52:07] salvation of God now this is you know
[52:10] setting a a a scene here that
[52:15] there's seriousness
[52:17] John is preaching about the baptism
[52:22] of of uh of repentance and and that we
[52:28] need to get ready
[52:31] he's he's going to accomplish something
[52:33] if I could say you know what this place
[52:36] looked like uh before brother Stan was
[52:39] working on it right he was making the
[52:42] the rough places smooth and filling in
[52:45] the holes and and and he was making
[52:48] ready for church today
[52:51] okay so this is John the Baptist was
[52:54] making ready for the coming of the Lord
[52:57] there was a there's a serious situation
[53:00] then said he to the multitude
[53:03] that came to church to be baptized
[53:07] he said oh Generation of Vipers
[53:12] who warned you to flee from the Wrath to
[53:16] come
[53:18] you would think he would be excited
[53:21] about them just get baptized
[53:23] right but he wasn't he was thinking
[53:25] about their motive
[53:27] thinking about the motive of why they
[53:30] wanted to get baptized
[53:34] bring forth therefore fruits worthy of
[53:37] repentance
[53:39] and bring not to say look at within
[53:43] yourself
[53:45] we have Abraham to Our Father for I say
[53:48] unto you that God is able of these
[53:50] stones to raise up children unto Abraham
[53:55] and now also the axes light to the root
[53:59] of the trees every tree therefore which
[54:01] bringeth not for good fruit is hewed
[54:03] down and cast Into the Fire
[54:07] wow
[54:10] you you I don't think he was trying to
[54:13] build a church here
[54:15] I don't think he was trying to build a
[54:17] congregation and a gathering
[54:19] I don't think he was trying to get more
[54:21] people to follow where he was at
[54:24] I think he was giving a direct message
[54:27] from God to the people
[54:30] that your motive is important and our
[54:35] motives need to bring forth fruit right
[54:39] no matter where we're going we got to
[54:42] have fruit
[54:46] and the people answered
[54:48] and the people I asked him saying what
[54:50] shall we do then and he answered and
[54:54] saith so they're asking what kind of
[54:55] fruit are you looking for
[54:57] and he said he that have two coats let
[55:00] him impart to him that have none
[55:02] and he that had meat let him do likewise
[55:06] then came also so that was that was a
[55:09] fruit in other words I'm I'm making a
[55:12] change
[55:13] I'm making a change it's not going to be
[55:15] about me anymore
[55:19] then came also the publicans to be
[55:21] baptized and he said Master what shall
[55:23] we do and he said unto them
[55:27] exact no more than that which is
[55:29] appointed on to you
[55:32] exact no more than that which is
[55:35] appointed you and the soldiers likewise
[55:38] demented him saying and what shall we do
[55:40] and he said unto them do violence to no
[55:43] man neither accuse any falsely and be
[55:45] content with your wages
[55:49] so here John the Baptist is talking
[55:52] about what is really needed if you're
[55:55] going to repent and come to God your
[55:57] life has got to change
[55:59] there's got to be changes in the way
[56:01] that you're no longer in the flesh just
[56:04] doing what you want to make your life
[56:06] better it's not about you when you come
[56:09] to Christ anymore it's about others
[56:14] foreign
[56:16] so what is John getting at here what is
[56:19] the Holy Ghost speaking to these three
[56:21] groups of people
[56:24] repentance is right but without the
[56:27] fruit of turning our life around it's
[56:30] wrong
[56:33] baptism is right but without the fruit
[56:36] of sincerity it's not right brother
[56:39] Madam says you'll just go into the water
[56:41] a sinner and you'll come up a sinner
[56:43] things won't change in your natural life
[56:45] even though you have a desire to be
[56:48] baptized catch this even though you know
[56:52] it's right and even though
[56:55] I could say this even though you know
[56:57] God's pricking at your heart to be
[56:59] baptized it isn't just getting dunked in
[57:01] the water that he's pricking your heart
[57:03] with he's pricking your heart to turn
[57:05] your life around
[57:06] that you can look I don't care what age
[57:08] you are that you can look back three
[57:10] months later and say something is
[57:12] transpired in the last three months yeah
[57:15] yeah amen
[57:18] it's got to keep changing if it's not
[57:21] we're dictating that God is just a god
[57:25] of the Dead
[57:27] and God is a god of the living
[57:30] and he testifies to that every spring
[57:35] obeying the will of God is right but
[57:38] having mixed motives is wrong and always
[57:41] will be
[57:44] so I'll Wonder today if we just took a
[57:47] minute we asked
[57:49] how often is your motive wrong
[57:55] how often is our motive room
[57:58] well we know it's it's a lot more wrong
[58:00] than we realize but the true question is
[58:02] how often do we check our motive
[58:06] if we don't check it
[58:08] we don't check it that's what we're
[58:10] having this service
[58:11] because we don't check it we're still
[58:13] being we're decent we're doing good the
[58:16] footsteps of the righteous to order the
[58:18] Lord all things are working together for
[58:20] the good and you know we just we we roll
[58:22] with those
[58:24] well if we roll with those why did the
[58:26] prophet tell us to check our motives
[58:32] their motive wasn't completely pure
[58:36] maybe as brother uh Marty would say
[58:40] maybe they were just looking for fire
[58:42] insurance
[58:43] they wanted to make sure that when it
[58:46] came time to die they were going to be
[58:48] okay
[58:51] we could say they had a hidden agenda
[58:54] no wonder Jesus said all that ever came
[58:56] before me are thiefs and robbers
[59:00] and a thief comes not but for to steal
[59:04] and who wouldn't want eternal life
[59:08] and do whatever they want to do
[59:12] I mean if you think about it that's kind
[59:14] of what Lucifer
[59:19] hey man we can live just we do our own
[59:21] thing let's just blow this popcorn stand
[59:24] and leave this place do what you want to
[59:27] do
[59:27] and definitely those satanic angels that
[59:31] are following Satan are doing what they
[59:33] want to do
[59:34] but not the angels in heaven
[59:37] they're only doing the will of God
[59:39] amen there's only two Wills
[59:43] that's why we got free more agency we
[59:46] can have any motive we want
[59:48] come on we can have any motor we can go
[59:50] anywhere we want but you know what's
[59:52] really important is that we do the will
[59:54] of God
[59:54] that should be our only motive is the
[59:57] will of God to do the will of God
[1:00:01] and not just on
[1:00:03] two or three or four things
[1:00:06] but you know my will of God for our life
[1:00:09] there is
[1:00:11] there are so many things
[1:00:13] that we come across every day
[1:00:16] that is the will of God for our life and
[1:00:18] some we want to put attention to and
[1:00:20] some we don't
[1:00:22] but they're all important to God
[1:00:25] Motors are either selfish
[1:00:28] or they're totally for the Lord
[1:00:31] or they're a mixture
[1:00:36] and they can't be
[1:00:39] let me give an example you know Mission
[1:00:41] work is always in the will of the Lord
[1:00:43] right
[1:00:44] but it doesn't mean a man working for
[1:00:46] the Lord doesn't have selfish motives
[1:00:49] mixed while he's working for the Lord
[1:00:54] some people really enjoy taking credit
[1:00:55] for their work
[1:00:57] some like building their own reputation
[1:01:00] there are spirits of popularity in this
[1:01:02] message
[1:01:05] so here you are
[1:01:07] doing the will of the Lord and have
[1:01:09] mixed motives
[1:01:12] no wonder the prophets said check your
[1:01:14] motives
[1:01:16] God doesn't want our Motors mixed
[1:01:19] but purely the Lord
[1:01:22] nothing inside our motives for ourself
[1:01:26] there just can't be
[1:01:29] our life needs to become all of God
[1:01:30] that's what the Bible says when a man is
[1:01:33] Born Again All Things Are
[1:01:36] of God
[1:01:38] all of our motives are God
[1:01:42] if there is anything inside we just need
[1:01:45] to get rid of it that's what this is
[1:01:46] about it's about to make an awareness
[1:01:49] we need to get our our face seeking the
[1:01:52] Lord and saying Lord help me
[1:01:55] because God does not want you to come to
[1:01:58] the full New Birth
[1:01:59] he doesn't want you to get to the place
[1:02:01] where you're sold out to God Lock Stock
[1:02:03] and Barrel
[1:02:05] he wants you to stay in a place
[1:02:08] where you got God at your reach here but
[1:02:11] you can do what you want to do over here
[1:02:15] our mold is
[1:02:17] continually be all for the Lord that's
[1:02:19] why it's so hard to get some people to
[1:02:21] do things because they simply want to do
[1:02:24] their own will
[1:02:26] but brother Byron said if God could just
[1:02:28] get one man in his hand he turned the
[1:02:31] world upside down
[1:02:33] one man
[1:02:36] he wants
[1:02:39] to work his will in our lives completely
[1:02:44] now brother Branham
[1:02:46] taught us to check her motive
[1:02:48] a lot of things go wrong in life
[1:02:51] because we don't check our motives
[1:02:54] we all probably could stand up and speak
[1:02:56] for hours about the things that have
[1:02:58] gone wrong in our lives because our
[1:03:00] motive was wrong
[1:03:01] are you with me
[1:03:03] is it right if I just read some quotes
[1:03:05] and just this is kind of a Wednesday
[1:03:07] night thing but you know it just it just
[1:03:10] on my heart
[1:03:12] brother Brandon
[1:03:16] spoken questions and answers 61
[1:03:21] the question comes brother Brandon if
[1:03:23] these questions are out of line
[1:03:26] then just disregard them
[1:03:28] and I won't feel bad about it
[1:03:31] for I'll know it was not in the hand of
[1:03:34] the Lord it says a real humble man here
[1:03:39] okay question number one brother random
[1:03:41] he says I have heard you say
[1:03:44] that I should be back in the ministry
[1:03:48] and I have thought upon it myself
[1:03:52] but have waited upon some definite word
[1:03:55] from him about it
[1:03:57] up to date it hasn't come
[1:04:00] now since I know the end is so near
[1:04:03] should I still wait for the Lord Jesus
[1:04:06] to speak to me
[1:04:08] or would he be pleased to tell you
[1:04:12] what to tell me
[1:04:15] since I know you are his spokesman for
[1:04:18] this day
[1:04:21] I I think this man was a it was a humble
[1:04:24] man
[1:04:28] well no before I got Brothers says now
[1:04:30] before I no no brother
[1:04:33] I got wrote down here my answer to it
[1:04:36] God calling this brother a call in life
[1:04:41] now there's one great thing we could
[1:04:44] just take as a text and preach all night
[1:04:47] on it it's just one thing a calling
[1:04:50] make your calling an election sure
[1:04:54] see we don't want to be just wandering
[1:04:57] if we're called
[1:04:59] wondering if we're called I'm sorry you
[1:05:02] must be called or you'll be defeated
[1:05:06] we're battle we're fighting a battle see
[1:05:09] and if you are positive sure brother
[1:05:12] that your calling is of God and you've
[1:05:15] been called of God to do a work dot dot
[1:05:18] dot
[1:05:20] now there is a great trick that the
[1:05:23] enemy can play on you and they say we
[1:05:25] all can relate to this
[1:05:27] we can he can make you think that you're
[1:05:31] not called when you are called
[1:05:34] then he can turn around turn right back
[1:05:36] around make you think that you're not
[1:05:38] called when you are called
[1:05:41] either way
[1:05:43] you have to watch it
[1:05:45] so he can make you think feel at times
[1:05:48] that you don't have the Holy Ghost when
[1:05:50] you got the Holy Ghost can make you
[1:05:52] think
[1:05:54] uh
[1:05:56] just the opposite
[1:05:58] he wants the devil wants most people to
[1:06:01] think they got the Holy Ghost
[1:06:05] because now there's their badge that
[1:06:08] they don't need to press unto Christ for
[1:06:10] anything more
[1:06:12] and it is it is that group of people
[1:06:16] that did not take an enough oil with
[1:06:18] them
[1:06:21] so this is a great trick and the devil
[1:06:24] can can mix up our motives
[1:06:27] now here's the way to do it first I'll
[1:06:30] find out first well now this is advice
[1:06:34] only thing I can give you is advice make
[1:06:38] sure that your calling comes from God
[1:06:41] and then check your motives and
[1:06:45] objectives see
[1:06:48] now you know what I mean by that
[1:06:51] what is your motive for preaching
[1:06:55] do you think it was an easier job than
[1:06:57] the one you have now
[1:06:59] he says then you better forget it
[1:07:01] because it wasn't a call
[1:07:03] what does brother Brandon teaching us
[1:07:06] here he's teaching us to try the spirit
[1:07:09] to see whether it's of God or not that's
[1:07:11] what it and this is something we don't
[1:07:13] we don't practice much of is trying to
[1:07:15] spirit because we feel that the things
[1:07:17] that we thoughts we think are okay
[1:07:20] there's songs that you know the songs
[1:07:22] that we like are the same ones God
[1:07:24] listens to in heaven
[1:07:26] you know we got that that thing that we
[1:07:28] we're just not wrong
[1:07:34] we don't want to assume that everything
[1:07:35] we think
[1:07:37] is of God
[1:07:39] many times the devil is trying to trick
[1:07:42] us
[1:07:44] into thinking
[1:07:46] that
[1:07:47] it's God speaking to us when really it's
[1:07:50] the devil who puts the thought there was
[1:07:52] camouflage so he has to give us some
[1:07:54] good with it right it's the tree of
[1:07:56] knowledge of Good and Evil and it's a
[1:07:58] mixed tree
[1:07:59] right and the prophet taught us that if
[1:08:02] anything that is mixed it will come to
[1:08:05] death
[1:08:06] right and it's the same thing with a
[1:08:09] motive
[1:08:10] motives can't be just good
[1:08:15] I mean a lot of times we think well
[1:08:16] there's nothing wrong with what I'm
[1:08:17] doing I'm not talking about what's I'm
[1:08:19] not talking about that I want to know is
[1:08:22] it the will of God
[1:08:24] right that's what I want I want to know
[1:08:25] if it's a perfect will of God because
[1:08:28] it's our we're told by the scriptures
[1:08:31] to prove that which is good
[1:08:34] acceptable and perfect will God there's
[1:08:37] only one will of God that is acceptable
[1:08:39] to him and it's a perfect will of God
[1:08:41] and not to say that God won't use his
[1:08:44] permissive will
[1:08:46] but you can't make it into heaven on a
[1:08:48] permissive will
[1:08:51] so why flirt with it
[1:08:58] beloved believe not every Spirit but try
[1:09:01] the spirits we're there of God because
[1:09:02] many false prophets are gone out into
[1:09:05] the world not just a couple but many all
[1:09:08] right let's get back to the quote
[1:09:09] brother man says a call of God
[1:09:12] he said a call of God Burns so in your
[1:09:16] heart you can't rest day or night for it
[1:09:22] he says you just can't get away from it
[1:09:24] it's just a constant grinding at you
[1:09:29] and I'll say it's anything Sonia wants
[1:09:31] to get baptized somebody that that wants
[1:09:34] to do something for the Lord
[1:09:37] if it just comes and goes you know that
[1:09:40] happens all the time
[1:09:43] all the time
[1:09:44] but something that's of God you can't
[1:09:48] let go
[1:09:51] you can't let it go
[1:09:54] no matter how much you would run away
[1:09:57] from it
[1:09:58] you can't let it go
[1:10:01] because it's God
[1:10:04] uh often we think there's a call
[1:10:08] but we can let it go
[1:10:10] and then it pops up and then we let it
[1:10:12] go and then it pops up and let it go but
[1:10:14] you know
[1:10:16] it's got to be a burning
[1:10:19] it's got to be something that it just it
[1:10:21] takes over your life
[1:10:24] and it doesn't matter and it doesn't
[1:10:26] have to be preaching excuse me this does
[1:10:28] not have to do with preaching but
[1:10:30] there's so many Ministries and so many
[1:10:33] things that God wants us to do one for
[1:10:36] another for people that don't know the
[1:10:38] Lord sometimes we we care about reaching
[1:10:40] out to others and we can go weeks and
[1:10:42] don't even think about others
[1:10:45] we can go days and I care about a soul
[1:10:47] and then we don't even think about souls
[1:10:52] so
[1:10:56] brother Brandon says a call of God Burns
[1:10:59] so in your heart you can't rest
[1:11:01] day and night for it you just can't get
[1:11:04] away from it it's a constant grinding at
[1:11:08] you
[1:11:14] so
[1:11:16] if it's just a desire you'll get
[1:11:18] distracted
[1:11:21] if it's just a desire you'll eventually
[1:11:23] get distracted if it's a call
[1:11:26] you can't get rid of it no matter if you
[1:11:29] try
[1:11:29] to distract yourself with something
[1:11:31] different
[1:11:32] are you with me
[1:11:34] boy this this is a good solid teaching
[1:11:37] if I was on that side of the of of the
[1:11:40] pulpit I would be saying Amen to this
[1:11:43] now brother Brandon went on to say here
[1:11:46] in this message right after he said this
[1:11:48] he says and if you had to preach you say
[1:11:51] well no another objective is I believe
[1:11:55] if I could I I if I could be successful
[1:11:58] evangelist or a pastor and have a good
[1:12:02] set salary and have a home that I could
[1:12:04] go to and so forth and live and then I
[1:12:06] believe that it would be a good thing
[1:12:08] and much easier than what I'm doing
[1:12:10] right now
[1:12:11] he said see your objective is wrong to
[1:12:13] begin with see it's not right you're
[1:12:16] wrong there on that
[1:12:19] so it can't even be if I'm going to be
[1:12:21] successful
[1:12:25] if you're going to be a complete failure
[1:12:28] are you still going to do it
[1:12:34] eyes
[1:12:39] God has a whole group of different trees
[1:12:43] and and birds and a five-fold Ministry
[1:12:48] everybody is not called to have a church
[1:12:51] of many thousand yeah
[1:12:55] and not that only those that have it are
[1:12:58] the only ones that can do it
[1:13:00] it's just it's that God's choice
[1:13:08] it takes a whole heart of humility to
[1:13:12] check your motives
[1:13:14] because the flesh doesn't want to do it
[1:13:16] it's just staring at this one thing one
[1:13:18] reason I want to look and you want other
[1:13:20] people to look at why you're wanting to
[1:13:23] do it
[1:13:26] for the Rams went on to say then you
[1:13:28] would say well because I think maybe I'd
[1:13:31] be more popular amongst the people
[1:13:36] that's a really really catchy one see to
[1:13:40] do something for popularity see you'll
[1:13:43] find out you're just ready for a big
[1:13:45] flop
[1:13:46] he said really see now if your objective
[1:13:51] is that I don't care if I have to eat
[1:13:53] soda crackers and drink Branch water
[1:13:55] I'll preach the gospel anyhow
[1:13:59] in other words there's nothing in it for
[1:14:02] you
[1:14:05] that's when you know it's God
[1:14:09] and you just apply this to anything in
[1:14:11] your life that you think God wants you
[1:14:13] to do
[1:14:14] if you don't get nothing out of it will
[1:14:16] you still do it
[1:14:20] something just tearing into you I'll
[1:14:23] either preach the gospel or I'll die
[1:14:27] then you'll go somewhere because it's
[1:14:29] God dealing with you see God making
[1:14:31] himself known to you because God just
[1:14:33] won't let you rest and usually a god-cod
[1:14:37] man never wants to do it anyways
[1:14:39] he said did you ever think about that
[1:14:42] brother Branham is here that we can have
[1:14:45] mixed motives that there could be a
[1:14:48] God's will for our lives and that there
[1:14:50] can be a fleshly mixed motive in doing
[1:14:52] the same thing
[1:14:54] and it happens all the time
[1:14:57] and we've got to learn to separate the
[1:15:00] two
[1:15:01] hey man I I just I'll just wish I wish I
[1:15:04] had some buttons here to say amen amen
[1:15:06] amen amen because what we're if we don't
[1:15:09] if we don't take this in
[1:15:11] we're not going to grow spiritually
[1:15:15] we're just going to be religious we're
[1:15:16] going to be carnal we're going to stay
[1:15:18] at a play and God is wanting so to
[1:15:21] establish this but he's got to be able
[1:15:23] to deal with our hearts deal with the
[1:15:26] inside
[1:15:27] this is kind of a long quote here
[1:15:30] brother says just recently it was asked
[1:15:33] of Me by someone very precious precious
[1:15:35] Brethren that said no now that we come
[1:15:39] into the way brother Branham
[1:15:41] now that we have found the Lord and
[1:15:43] received the Holy Ghost shall we seek
[1:15:46] gifts for our ministry that that we
[1:15:50] should do
[1:15:53] so now that we're here we in the truth
[1:15:56] we receive more of God should we seek
[1:15:59] gifts for our ministry
[1:16:03] I said don't never do that
[1:16:08] don't never advise people to do
[1:16:10] something like that because usually that
[1:16:12] guy wants to do it is the guy that can't
[1:16:16] do it
[1:16:18] in other words he's wanting to do it for
[1:16:21] himself
[1:16:23] he's wanting to to use the gift
[1:16:26] that he's received
[1:16:30] and God doesn't want us to use our gift
[1:16:35] Brother John
[1:16:37] I'll say it again God does not want us
[1:16:39] to use our gift
[1:16:42] God wants to use our gift yeah that's
[1:16:46] right brother Ryan God wants to use the
[1:16:48] gift he gave us it's God
[1:16:51] it needs to be God in us using what he
[1:16:53] gave us
[1:16:54] it can't be us doing it can have no part
[1:16:58] of it
[1:17:04] it's the guy that's trying to run from
[1:17:07] it is the best one that God uses
[1:17:11] if he wants to do it so bad the first
[1:17:13] thing you know he'll find himself a
[1:17:15] stuffed shirt
[1:17:17] like you say God give you give me power
[1:17:21] to move mountains and I'll tell you I'll
[1:17:23] do something for you if you just let me
[1:17:25] move mountains
[1:17:26] no he wouldn't
[1:17:29] he can't even move himself in the right
[1:17:31] attitude see
[1:17:34] he would never move mountains for God
[1:17:37] so the attitude is important attitude
[1:17:40] shows where where our motives are at
[1:17:44] it really does
[1:17:46] just take for instance like Paul you
[1:17:49] think Paul could have gotten away from
[1:17:51] his calling oh brother he couldn't do it
[1:17:54] it was just grinding at him day and
[1:17:55] night till he left the church he left
[1:17:57] everything went down I believe to it was
[1:18:00] Asia but wasn't it question mark it was
[1:18:02] Arabia
[1:18:03] and and stayed there three years down
[1:18:06] there studying the scriptures to find
[1:18:08] out whether it was right or not
[1:18:10] and to find out whether God had already
[1:18:12] called them
[1:18:14] so if God is calling you brother
[1:18:16] and it keeps digging at your heart then
[1:18:19] I'd say lay aside every weight and every
[1:18:22] sin
[1:18:23] that does so easily besets you
[1:18:25] what an answer to give a man that's just
[1:18:29] asking
[1:18:31] if he should go
[1:18:33] lay aside every weight and every sin
[1:18:36] that's so easy beset you you see but if
[1:18:39] it's not digging at you and it just it's
[1:18:42] not digging at you
[1:18:44] there's a difference if somebody picks
[1:18:46] at you once in a while pinches you
[1:18:49] You Can Let It Go
[1:18:51] but if it's not digging at you and then
[1:18:53] I wouldn't think too much about it then
[1:18:54] see just let it come to its place
[1:18:59] the motive has to be purely God's will
[1:19:04] a love to do God's will
[1:19:08] okay so here these people were in church
[1:19:11] and they were worshiping
[1:19:13] but they didn't care to enter in right
[1:19:17] going through the formality
[1:19:19] of singing the song clapping
[1:19:23] a green
[1:19:25] but their heart didn't want to enter in
[1:19:29] because their heart
[1:19:31] could have been on their problems
[1:19:35] their heart could have been wanting to
[1:19:37] do something else be somewhere else
[1:19:42] and a lot of times we can be doing
[1:19:43] something for God
[1:19:46] and our Heart's Not There
[1:19:50] well let's do this as a church and I
[1:19:52] kind of don't want to do that
[1:19:58] what do you want to do
[1:20:04] how do you know what God wants you to do
[1:20:07] has he told you
[1:20:18] brother Branham says
[1:20:20] teaches us that we could be wrong
[1:20:24] we can't be the ones picking and
[1:20:26] choosing
[1:20:27] what we're going to do
[1:20:31] I'll tell you how that works
[1:20:33] we come to the church and if we feel
[1:20:35] like worshiping we'll worship
[1:20:37] and if we don't feel like worshiping
[1:20:40] we don't
[1:20:43] but what we're doing is we're making God
[1:20:46] lower than our feelings
[1:20:51] we're making God's word of none effect
[1:20:54] your tradition
[1:20:56] your tradition
[1:20:58] of only worshiping God when you feel
[1:21:01] like it it's a tradition
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:04] making the word of God of no effect when
[1:21:08] he's worthy of all praise
[1:21:12] everything that has breath to praise the
[1:21:14] Lord
[1:21:16] to put your heart into worshiping
[1:21:20] don't leave your heart outside the door
[1:21:22] when you come in
[1:21:23] be prepared to give them your best to
[1:21:27] offer the sacrifice of praise
[1:21:30] Thanksgiving
[1:21:33] he's done so much for us
[1:21:36] but
[1:21:38] but we give them so little
[1:21:41] we give him so little
[1:21:43] and look I'm not pointing fingers at
[1:21:45] anybody
[1:21:48] but I just think we all need to say Amen
[1:21:50] from my heart and and not just I agree
[1:21:53] an amen not and I agree amen
[1:21:56] but a so be it amen how the prophet
[1:21:58] taught us in other words let it be in my
[1:22:01] life that I give more of my worship
[1:22:04] because our spirit that we bring in here
[1:22:07] whether it's half-hearted or
[1:22:08] wholehearted makes a difference in the
[1:22:10] atmosphere we create an atmosphere for
[1:22:12] him to come
[1:22:14] and it ain't just
[1:22:15] don't put it on the worship leader
[1:22:18] you can't pull on the piano player
[1:22:21] and you can't put it on the one or two
[1:22:23] or three five people
[1:22:25] we're a body
[1:22:27] we need one another's prayers well we we
[1:22:30] need one another to worship god with
[1:22:32] everything with all of our heart
[1:22:38] our motive cannot be mixed with any
[1:22:41] other
[1:22:42] desire
[1:22:45] most of our motives are mixed
[1:22:51] but it's only the one on the top that
[1:22:53] God is looking at
[1:22:57] we can't have any selfish desire mixed
[1:23:00] with it
[1:23:02] we can't have anything what can I get
[1:23:05] out of it
[1:23:07] nothing can be about us
[1:23:10] these believers who believed in God
[1:23:12] worshiped God but their love
[1:23:16] for doing what they were doing
[1:23:19] is what was missing how many times we
[1:23:21] come to church but our our heart really
[1:23:23] wasn't here
[1:23:25] come on
[1:23:27] so if Jesus looked at them and said in
[1:23:32] vain they're worshiping me Hypocrites
[1:23:34] what would he say to us
[1:23:37] what would he say to us
[1:23:39] what do you say something different
[1:23:41] because we're bride because we think
[1:23:42] we're bride
[1:23:46] so this you know we can really if we
[1:23:48] take the word to Heart
[1:23:50] it'll change us
[1:23:52] if it's just a sermon that's going to be
[1:23:54] over after you know an hour that we come
[1:23:57] and then we go back to doing our own
[1:23:58] thing then we're really not coming to
[1:24:00] the house of God for the right reasons
[1:24:02] [Music]
[1:24:04] God is looking for a a a a a a a spirit
[1:24:09] I'll just say a worship that's in spirit
[1:24:12] and in truth
[1:24:14] so God is a spirit they that worship Him
[1:24:16] must worship Him in spirit in other
[1:24:18] words we must get out of the Flesh and
[1:24:20] able to Worship in the spirit
[1:24:22] because gravity you wake up in the
[1:24:25] morning you're in the flesh
[1:24:27] you're tired
[1:24:29] you wish you didn't have to get up and
[1:24:30] go to the bathroom but you have to
[1:24:33] I mean we're in the flesh
[1:24:36] you have to get out of the Flesh in
[1:24:38] order to let the Spirit come out
[1:24:41] and worship God who is a spirit who's
[1:24:44] not in the flesh of course now if we
[1:24:47] were just a man-made church and we're
[1:24:49] going to have to we we're like everybody
[1:24:51] else and laodicea that's kicked God out
[1:24:53] of the church and we we don't want the
[1:24:55] word we're just going to have
[1:24:56] entertainment we're going to have a uh
[1:24:58] you know all this lights and and and and
[1:25:01] singing and all this entertainment well
[1:25:05] well then it doesn't matter
[1:25:07] but
[1:25:09] we it does matter to God
[1:25:13] it takes love our motive has to be love
[1:25:16] it takes love to crucify our flesh
[1:25:19] it takes a love for God to crucify our
[1:25:21] flesh because we don't want to
[1:25:23] our flesh doesn't want to be crucified
[1:25:27] all right another long quote if it's
[1:25:29] okay and we're going to try to close on
[1:25:31] this brother Brandon said in the message
[1:25:33] Christ is the mystery uh Christ is
[1:25:36] revealed in his own word so we're
[1:25:39] talking about motives here and
[1:25:41] objectives
[1:25:42] you pray what you do pray to
[1:25:46] well you pray what you pray to I asked
[1:25:49] for so and so and and certain things and
[1:25:52] I didn't get it
[1:25:54] how many has prayed for certain things
[1:25:57] and didn't get it
[1:26:00] while you pray what you pray to I ask
[1:26:03] for certain things uh uh I I pray just
[1:26:07] so and so for certain things and I
[1:26:09] didn't get it he said You Prayed wrong
[1:26:14] we should never pray to change God's
[1:26:17] mind
[1:26:19] we should pray to change our mind
[1:26:22] God's mind don't need any changing see
[1:26:24] that it's right
[1:26:27] he says I know a young Catholic boy one
[1:26:29] time and he had a prayer book saying
[1:26:32] prayers for his mother to live
[1:26:35] and she died
[1:26:37] and he threw the prayer book Into the
[1:26:39] Fire
[1:26:41] well you see I don't go for the prayer
[1:26:43] book but anyhow you see you take the
[1:26:47] wrong attitude
[1:26:48] you're trying to tell God what to do
[1:26:52] how many people do we know when
[1:26:53] something happened they just they they
[1:26:55] turned it back on God
[1:26:59] prayer should be Lord change me to fit
[1:27:01] your word
[1:27:04] not change
[1:27:09] let me change not let me change your
[1:27:12] mind
[1:27:13] but change my mind see
[1:27:17] you change my mind to do your will
[1:27:21] and your will is written here in the
[1:27:23] book and Lord don't let me
[1:27:26] don't let me go till my mind is set just
[1:27:31] like your mind the mind of Christ let
[1:27:33] the mind that was in Christ be in you
[1:27:35] and then when my mind is set like your
[1:27:38] mind
[1:27:39] then I'll believe every word you wrote
[1:27:43] and you said in there you don't make
[1:27:47] you'll make everything work together for
[1:27:50] the good to them that love you and I
[1:27:51] love you lord it's all working together
[1:27:53] for the good
[1:27:55] now I've been this week down in the
[1:27:57] country staying with some dear friends
[1:27:58] of mine I asked some of them at the
[1:28:01] table yesterday when we were eating we
[1:28:03] we always sat around and and have a
[1:28:05] little study on the Bible was talking
[1:28:07] about love
[1:28:09] and there was a certain person said to
[1:28:11] me he said I believe you're an
[1:28:13] antichrist
[1:28:15] that wouldn't be a good thing to call
[1:28:17] the prophet
[1:28:19] and I said if that would be pleasing to
[1:28:22] my Lord
[1:28:24] that's what I want to be now he's trying
[1:28:28] to teach something
[1:28:31] I want to be whatever he wants me to be
[1:28:33] I love him
[1:28:36] and if he would cast me into hell
[1:28:40] I would still love him if I go with the
[1:28:45] same spirit
[1:28:46] I have now
[1:28:48] he looked at me kind of strange of
[1:28:51] course anybody would saying that
[1:28:54] he said I seen four or five of them
[1:28:57] young men young wives fine women I know
[1:29:00] them boys and they love their wives so I
[1:29:03] said to them so he's trying to teach
[1:29:06] them
[1:29:07] what love
[1:29:09] really is
[1:29:10] he said here is the way to test it if
[1:29:14] your love if you love if your wife
[1:29:17] before you were married
[1:29:21] now you go back say before the married
[1:29:23] life
[1:29:25] so you're single now you've been
[1:29:26] dreaming
[1:29:28] you were married but you really wasn't
[1:29:30] married but you were dreaming you were
[1:29:32] and you woke up and you went and you
[1:29:35] talked it over with your girlfriend and
[1:29:37] you said you know I dreamed that we were
[1:29:40] married and we had children and we were
[1:29:43] happy and we were waiting for the coming
[1:29:45] of the Lord and everything and then this
[1:29:47] girl would say to you
[1:29:51] you know I love another man better than
[1:29:56] I love you
[1:29:57] now I could be happier with this other
[1:29:59] man
[1:30:01] brother man says could you from your
[1:30:04] heart love her well enough to say
[1:30:07] God's blessings rest upon you my dear go
[1:30:10] with this other man
[1:30:16] he says now check that every each of you
[1:30:19] men or women
[1:30:22] well if your love is correct
[1:30:25] you would do that
[1:30:27] for you are interested in her welfare
[1:30:33] what you know
[1:30:35] you could have her what you know you
[1:30:37] could have her you could live with her
[1:30:39] she could be your wife she'll marry you
[1:30:42] but she won't be happy
[1:30:45] she would be happier
[1:30:48] and then if you love her then you want
[1:30:52] her to be happy
[1:30:54] so true love is about others
[1:30:58] it's living for others
[1:31:01] and if we got eternal life we shouldn't
[1:31:03] be any problem for us living for others
[1:31:05] the problem is we want to claim eternal
[1:31:08] life but we don't mind living a selfish
[1:31:10] life
[1:31:11] and we we just tied behind that badge
[1:31:14] I'm a Christian I'm in the message
[1:31:16] but where's the fruit why is it so hard
[1:31:19] to enter into the spirit when we come to
[1:31:20] church
[1:31:21] Brother Band says even way before church
[1:31:24] you can't wait till those doors are open
[1:31:30] now check that each of you
[1:31:34] therefore whatever the will of God is
[1:31:38] let God's will be done
[1:31:40] whether I'm happy or not
[1:31:43] I want to live so he will be pleased
[1:31:46] with what I do
[1:31:48] therefore check your objective
[1:31:52] and your motive by that you know whether
[1:31:56] you love God or not in other words
[1:31:59] if at any time
[1:32:01] he told you not to do it
[1:32:05] could you just simply walk away
[1:32:09] or if he told you to do something that
[1:32:11] you're not happy or excited about do it
[1:32:13] would you just automatically do it
[1:32:17] see the our motive has to be the will of
[1:32:19] God not not whether we
[1:32:22] get what we're getting what we want to
[1:32:23] get out of it
[1:32:27] well if he would say you serve me
[1:32:32] you served me if I'll cast you away
[1:32:37] well if he'd say you serve me if I'm
[1:32:40] going to cast you away
[1:32:43] I love you anyhow
[1:32:45] therefore if the churches would see
[1:32:50] that and could believe in that manner so
[1:32:53] this is a lesson for us
[1:32:55] it wouldn't be one trying to jerk the
[1:32:58] football away from the other fella when
[1:33:01] he's running with it
[1:33:03] we would be protecting that one see real
[1:33:06] true motive and objective wouldn't be
[1:33:08] trying to say hey I got this too this is
[1:33:12] me
[1:33:13] this
[1:33:14] see God can't use that man
[1:33:17] there is so much impersonation follows
[1:33:19] it and that's Satan
[1:33:22] and the people can't realize it
[1:33:25] they're trying to take the ball from
[1:33:27] somebody
[1:33:28] it's football season you know
[1:33:31] they're trying to take the ball from
[1:33:33] somebody that has been given
[1:33:37] let God raise up a Ministry and watch
[1:33:39] how many goes after it see
[1:33:41] now genuine love for God no matter what
[1:33:45] part I Am Lord if I can only say a word
[1:33:49] for it help protect it let me do that
[1:33:55] my I read this and I think
[1:33:57] this is a pure message but this isn't
[1:34:01] what we see
[1:34:04] and this is the fruit
[1:34:07] we need to have the fruit of this
[1:34:09] message in our lives
[1:34:13] too often we're worried about
[1:34:15] recognition
[1:34:18] we're worried about things other than
[1:34:20] God I just wonder your will it doesn't
[1:34:22] matter how much I suffer
[1:34:26] there just seems to be a limit to
[1:34:28] everything that we're willing to do
[1:34:33] what about just being sown out what
[1:34:35] about that
[1:34:38] that's what God's calling us to
[1:34:43] and I'm okay that we're not there today
[1:34:45] but I'm not okay with us being okay with
[1:34:49] that
[1:34:50] there's the difference
[1:34:52] so I I ask you to check your Motors
[1:34:56] check your objectives and make sure that
[1:34:58] what you're doing is only because I want
[1:35:00] to please him
[1:35:01] I just want to please and that's the
[1:35:04] only thing I can see right now
[1:35:06] is pleasing him and then I believe that
[1:35:09] will grow
[1:35:10] will grow together
[1:35:12] will grow to that statue of a perfect
[1:35:15] man whose motives whose objective is
[1:35:18] only for the Lord amen amen let's Stand
[1:35:21] Together
[1:35:40] amen I wanted to
[1:35:43] seeing that little course that we were
[1:35:46] singing just before we came up here when
