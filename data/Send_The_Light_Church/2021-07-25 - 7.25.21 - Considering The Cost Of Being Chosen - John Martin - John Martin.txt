believe all things are possible lord i believe [Music] amen can you say amen to that amen what a perfect song preparation for god to come and speak to us he could ask us to do a lot of things but he asked us only to believe amen well god bless you i want to greet you in the name of jesus christ the greatest name that we could meet together in is the name of jesus i may look a little different today i had a little battle with a goat and uh it it's as you could see it there and i got it here too um so he he got away the dog chased him away and brother stan helped uh try to find him on friday i believe it was we're looking for him we couldn't really corral him and then we just gave up because we couldn't find him he just went all over the neighbors across the street so we our neighbor called after he went to a number of neighbors trying to figure out who this goat belongs to and we just felt that the lord wanted us to connect with our neighbors so we've been connecting with our neighbors here of late so he was cornered in this little area about this big and there's about this much area to get on and off this little deck here and so i just i thought well i tried the old come here come on you little nice one and that that's how our goats used to be they're not like that anymore uh at least what this one isn't and so i was just gonna like you know not let him get away well he body slammed me and he just with every bit of energy that thing had jumped up and i've seen them hit one another so if i slur if i'm sloppy uh please forgive me today you're gonna have to bear with me so after trying it our way we just decided to pray and then um the the goat end up being in our barn this morning so we should have tried that at the beginning just pray and the lord will make a way for the goat to come back so we're grateful for that amen turn with me if you would to the book of saint matthew chapter 12 or 22. i just want to say thank you to ann for all that she does for the live streaming for our sister amanda who is learning everything and back there and it's it's a large thing to learn uh it's not real easy so i just want to say thank you for a sister also i want to say thank you to our sunday school teachers for all they're doing to have a vision for the young ones and i also want to say thank you for musicians that make it possible that we can enjoy our worship and i want to say thank you to our worship leaders who are dedicating themselves to do better to yield to the lord more and to have set an atmosphere where god just feels welcome to come i also want to thank those who clean the church we're a body body ministry and i just appreciate each one of you i want you to know that um i appreciate brother stan who's here of late been uh putting in some hours at the church the new church trying to get that ready for us i just want to say thank you to him i also want to say thank you to our prayer warriors who pray for one another for the things that are done the church for the ministry where would we be without the prayer warriors i want to also thank each and every one of you for making this your home church and some of you drive long distances and my my prayer is that god would bless each and every one of you with more of him i just had that in my heart to want to to share a thanksgiving to you amen before we begin reading here matthew 22 let's look to the author and ask his blessings heavenly father lord we've all been raised in schools to bow to read and and have understanding about the words that are in the dictionaries and how to use them but lord we know that this is a heavenly language your book is written as a love letter and we need the holy spirit to come and inspire it to us to reveal what it is that could help us be ready for a rapture to come more into your image ultimately stand next to your side as as your bride in heaven lord we're looking forward to that as we see the world falling apart just looking forward to to leaving getting out of here we pray lord that you bless our eyes to see or our ears to hear our heart to understand that we might grow in your grace and your love come bless your word now to our hearts and may your holy spirit be felt by each and every one here we pray we thank you for these things lord we pray in jesus christ's name amen amen matthew chapter 22 starting with verse number 12 and he saith unto him friend how came is thou and hither not having a wedding garment and he was speechless then said the king to the servants bind him hand and foot take him away and cast him to outer darkness there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth for many are called but few are chosen god bless you may be seated i'd like to entitle this message considering the cost of being chosen and for a subject god is calling everyone but is only choosing a few now we understand that the scriptures that we have been elected we've been predestined we've been chosen before the foundation of the world this is a true statement but there is a cost to really being chosen and i know the enemy would like nothing more than for us to just believe since we're in the message that it is an automatic thing but we have some scriptures to help us and my my desire is really um to provoke us to dig deeper into the lord the lord knows how to get us ready the lord knows what we need i don't we don't know what one another needs that's true are you with me we're not god we're god builds the church but i do know this that we open the door for god to speak to us more when we begin to hunger and thirst for god amen that's right so many are called fewer chosen everyone gets a chance but god has the final say so in who he chooses in this little opening scripture here um the question comes asked by jesus friend friend friend calls him a friend how did you get here but he wasn't a close enough friend to keep him there a friend but this friend couldn't say because he he wasn't prepared for the wedding supper and so he gets he gets cast out into outer uh into outer darkness i believe that it says this um yes there shall be weeping and nationalities we're representing here tribulation are you with me okay this is the hour that we are approaching so we want to consider the cost of being chosen because this this person did not have the wedding garment on right and it wasn't because uh it wasn't handed to him like this because the garment is is saying there's the garment go get it his bride have made herself ready she has to go after it after the word and get dressed amen luke chapter 14 verse 25. and there were great multitudes with him and he turned and he said unto them if any man come after me and hate not his father and his mother and his wife his children brother and his sister jay and his own life also he cannot be my disciple and whosoever not bear his cross come after me cannot be my disciple for which of you intend to build a tower sitteth not down first and counter the cost whether it be sufficient to finish it less happily after you've laid the foundation and is not able to finish it all that behold it began to mock at him saying this man began to build and was not able to finish how many times have you been in a situation to where you said i'm going to go do this i'm going to build i'm going to put this addition i'm going to buy this car i'm going to i'm going to go over here i'm going to go on this little trip i'm going to do this and you find out that you didn't have all the money that you really wanted to finish it right and and basically the wise thing to do would be to consider the cost of whatever we're going to do and and so here jesus is telling those that he's calling out to to consider the cost of being a christian consider the cost of being a disciple and i'll say it like this consider the cost of being chosen amen it's not as easy as i want to or i believe i am now those are okay and i'm not against them but we need to consider the cost we know that there's the believer and the unbeliever and the mate believer it's kind of like the good the bad and the ugly right the believer he's good the unbeliever is bad and the main believer is ugly are you with me in every church the prophet taught us that these exist now i'd like to say here to us so we make it real clear that we're all believers here the unbelievers and the mate believers well i don't know you know but we're all believers and we just we need to believe that but we also need to believe what the prophet said so i don't want anybody to be discouraged uh but we just have to understand that we are facing a devil who doesn't want us to dig into christ that's right we want to be encouraged all day long but god is saying look what more can i do for you it's time for you to express your love to me amen so the believer will hear and take the word of god into his life hook line and sinker brother ben says the holy ghost says amen to every word of god just takes it wants it and puts it into their life now the unbeliever he hears the same word but simply will not receive it just a heart heart just it it just is resistant to to take it into his life now the make believer he will hear the word of god he will say amen and he will go through the motions as a real believer but will not apply the word of god to his life now i'm talking about all the word some of the word he will but not all the word he may even try to make changes in his life but he won't apply all the word to his life now there's the the difference there now which one of these groups is god choosing first elect consider the cost we want to consider the cost of being chosen now it's okay for you to be happy this morning this is totally okay with me you can resist every other feeling that you're having this morning and be happy for the word i love you the word loves you jesus loves you but you know we have this flesh that we have to contend with and our our goal is uh we we want to find the mind of god amen for our lives we can see that many are called but only few are chosen by god why is that why he does he only choose some god must have a higher standard than what most people think or willing to accept as much as god has loved the world and gave his only begotten son god still requires us to surrender a total surrender for sake all ambitions careers love not the world our our loved ones our own will our own lives you don't have to read very far in the gospels to find out that's exactly what jesus is telling us amen so he calls many but he only chooses a few and i'm sure he chooses the ones that he wants when you go to the car a car dealer you want to buy a car you don't buy the car you don't want you buy the car you want when you go into a restaurant you know say can i see your menu i'd like to i'd like to order something i don't want to eat we don't do that we and i believe that when god makes a choice what he's choosing to be his bride it's exactly what he wants we can't force him to want us we can only become what he wants amen he wants only the best for his kingdom according to ephesians 5 27 we know god wants to present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish now that's what god is looking for in order to achieve this and resolve he is continually washing his bride with the washing of the water by the word he's continuously sanctifying her getting her ready every time she comes to service he's speaking something to her that he wants to see washed out of her life at the same time he's encouraging her you're my bride keep going but we cannot remain the way we are if we were ready we would be out of here the more we can get excited about wanting to become more like him amen the quicker we'll get out of here we are not necessarily waiting on god i believe he's he's he's also waiting on us i know the last elect has to come in but that just gives us opportunity did you ever did you ever like you know you go to school and you're gonna you're supposed to take a test but the teacher says you know what because of this and this i wasn't prepared you know you're not going to take the test until tomorrow and you go i got one more day to study well we just got a little bit more time to get ready for jesus that's the way i look at this i believe that god wants a bride that will love him more than they love themselves don't you want somebody that will love you more amen than they love themselves that's hard living with somebody they don't love you as much as they love themselves i believe god wants a bride that'll love him more than they love herself according to revelations verse 12 ver chapter 12 verse 11 it is one of the three requirements to overcome in this age and they overcame it by the blood of the lamb by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto the death well if they didn't love their lives who they love it had to be god it had to be god so many are called few are chosen jesus uses the same ratio of many few in matthew chapter 7 when he calls many into the to the to come into the doors of heaven he says in uh verse 13 of matthew chapter 7 entering in at the straight gate for why does the gate and broad is the way that leads to destruction and many there be which going there at because straight is the gate narrows away that which leadeth onto life and few there be that find it so again the same ratio many few is being used the straight gate is a narrow entrance into heaven amen you've heard of the old expression straight as an arrow some teachers they were just so can't get away with anything or some coach or one of the two parents or did you ever hear this oh we can't go to my house and do that because my parents are too strict god is word straight as an arrow his way is straight as an arrow [Music] the way that god leads man to eternal life is by the infallible word of jesus christ there's no other way the majority of people have considered god's narrow way to not be the only way in other words they hear a voice that says that's narrow-minded they cannot that can't be the only way to get to heaven you know what i'll just find another church that is more suitable to the way that i think are you with me paul speaking of the end times here in ii timothy chapter 3 verse 13 says but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived but continue thou in the things which thou has learned and been assured of knowing of whom thou has learned them so in other words as we see this you know culvert arising again and all the you know we're going to have a shortage of 37 uh items in the future well they just seem to have know everything instead of our minds being on that stuff i think we should take the advice given by paul to timothy continue in the things that thou has learned and has been assured of anointing of who thou has learned them and that from a child that has known the holy scriptures which are able to make thee wise we're going to get a wise and foolish virgins here able to make thee wise unto salvation through faith in that is it which is in jesus christ all scripture is given by the inspiration of god and it is profitable for a doctrine reproof correction and instructions of righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works this is the only way to salvation is the word of god we need to be so interested in becoming that word not just saying i believe the word is true and i believe it's god's word and we're supposed to live by all those things has nothing in it about commitment to living the word and we need to be interested in letting this word become manifested inside of us now and hey guy on this couple of scriptures i'm throwing in here and i'm sorry i'll just i'm going to read them real quick hey guys uh chapter 1 verse 7 says thus saith the lord of hosts consider your ways so consider the thought process of being able to become god's chosen elect different than the way he is chosen isaiah 55 verse 8 for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither are my neither are your ways my way so there's a difference between way we think and the way god thinks for as the heavens are higher than the earth sore my way is higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts so god's thoughts his standard is higher than ours god's straight gate in narrow way is very difficult it's it's higher than ours in fact first peter chapter 4 verse 18 says that the righteous are scarcely saved the righteous scarcely now i wa if we're having a race or if you watch a race the olympics or whatever and a person's barely makes it as the winner right comes in first or he scarcely makes it well he he doesn't got a whole lap in front of another person right he doesn't get a whole 100 yards no it's this close and the righteous is this close to making it right it's not i'm so predestined it just doesn't matter i'm so elected it doesn't matter it just doesn't rhyme with all the scriptures yes we're predestined and praise god that should give us security and comfort but that doesn't take away what we need to be doing jesus said it's only they that endure to the end shall be saved now of course the whole church world is kind of like in going to make it to the end but endure what and tear what just be alive and get to the end no no what we need to be doing to get ready we're taught philippians chapter 2 verse 12 to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling that's coming in to church now like i i hope i'm i'm pleasing the lord not coming to the church well i'll come here to grab some more knowledge kind of kind of just see you know you know how i can just grow in knowledge no for it is god which is trying to work in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure so we're just you know talking about that god's way is higher than our way his way of thinking is different than ours and we need to understand that when we come into church it because things are not coming across to us the way that we're thinking doesn't mean it's wrong it means that maybe that god isn't where we think he is all the time in the way that we think about the word we know the only way a man can get into heaven is simply through the new birth jesus told nicodemus in john chapter 3 verse 3 verily verily i say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of god he has to be born again it's as clear as as can be that simple but yet what does it mean to be born again right the most important thing that god requires of a man to to make it to heaven is for a man to allow god to come into his heart to really come into his heart we can't make it into heaven with sin now jesus died for our sin and and and repentance is is required for sin to to be to re to be removed but god does not want people in heaven whose sins are forgiven yet they still have their own sinful nature so it's not just about being forgiven of our sin it's about the very nature that caused the sin because the whole reason think about this the whole reason that god put flaming swords in the garden of eden after he talked to adam and eve about the sin he said if we if they partake of the tree of life while they have that sinful nature they're going to live eternally with a sinful nature that's why he put flaming swords there right in other words you've got to be born again you've got to get rid of that nature because that sinful nature came upon them when they partook of the tree of knowledge of good and evil just like that they began to get old the day you ether of the day you'll die sin had set in god does not want people with a sinful nature in heaven amen so the most important thing a man can do is to allow god to come into his heart amen it's the only way that god can assure that his will is going to be done in heaven is if he has complete control of our lives our will and everything that happens as soon as someone in heaven wanted to do their own will that's when sin happened it's and that was lucifer when he decided i am going to do my own thing that's when iniquity was found and that's when things began to get polluted in church or polluted in heaven and god had to just say take sides there was a split in the church in heaven and a third of the church went this way and two-thirds stayed with jesus praise the lord hey splits have been since the beginning have they not right but god used it amen amen he used it how many times have you gotten in trouble for doing something that you shouldn't have done but you were never told or for not doing something that somebody wanted you to do but they didn't tell you and you said or at least thought these thoughts at one time or another i can't read your mind if you wanted didn't want it you should have told me and the only way to assure that god's will is going to be done in heaven is if we have the mind of christ that he has control of our mind our lives then he can just have remember brother branham said that power without character was satanic power to do whatever you wanted to do but not character to do god's will are you with me amen we must be born again the full birth amen we must be filled with the life of god nothing short of the holy ghost i can't emphasize enough the importance of getting on our knees crying out for god for more of the holy ghost i'm happy for how much we have but satan and an evil spirit is the only thing that will ever tell you you have enough [Music] that will never come from the lips of god in fact we seem to be like jesus more of you i think that's the spirit of god let's talk about the condition and the deceptions of uh the the the foolish virgins for a moment turn with me if you would to saint matthew chapter 25 i'd like to read the first 13 verses here how many is excited for the word now if i was speaking to your flesh there would have been but we're not speaking to the flesh we're speaking to the bride right saint matthew chapter 25 starting with verse 1 then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto virgins unto ten virgins which took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom the five and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them but the wise took oil in their vessels with their lamps while the bridegroom terry they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry behold the bridegroom cometh go yet to meet him and all those virgins arose and trim their lambs and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our lamps have gone out but the wise answer is saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with to with him to the marriage and the door was shut and afterwards the other virgins saying lord lord open to us and he's answered and said unto them verily i say unto you i know you not watch therefore for ye know not the day or the hour when the son of man cometh now there are some similarities between these two groups brother branham taught us they were both virgins both groups lived good clean lives they didn't indulge themselves in the things of the world they both went out to meet the bridegroom both groups wanted to go into the rapture in other words they both went to church they fellowship together they prayed for one another they worshipped the lord they listened to the word of god being preached that they believed would help them get ready or else they wanted done it they both heard the message of the hour malachi 4 5. because brother branham taught us that at midnight the cry went out behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him and that was the message of the hour that call was the message of the hour and all the virgins arose and trimmed their lamps see the similarities sit amongst us at church and the wise virgins believed the message of the hour they knew what it took to get in they knew it took more of the holy ghost whereas the foolish virgins listened to the wrong voice that said christ already paid the price for you you don't have to do anything else you already have the holy ghost you have enough of god to make a rapture same word but it's the response to the word and when the foolish virgins began to realize that they didn't have enough of god to make the rapture they got more serious with the word is that what we read in here and they started seeking more of god that's what was required they started seeking more of god but notice they didn't even go to god they were still carnal in their relationship and in their thoughts and so they they went to holy ghost-filled believers to get it as if they could get more god by talking to someone their relationship was so distant from god that they didn't even go to god for the holy ghost come on give me what you got and what did the holy ghost filled believers tell them just like it is the only person that can give you the holy ghost or more of god is god himself revelation chapter 3 verse 18 i think we read this just maybe last service or soul jesus speaking here he says i counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou mayest be clothed and the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint that eyes with i saith that thou may deceive i counsel thee to buy of me i'm the one that can give you more holy ghost amen but it isn't as easy as just coming to god and saying oh god i want some more holy ghost it just doesn't work like that if it did well we'd all have it it requires so much more because god's standard is so high their relationship with god was never even close enough to first catch that they needed more of god than what they had because remember they kept thinking i have enough but when they realized that they didn't then then they started seeking it so at one time they kept resisting the word of god that was being preached the word says you know come to the altar come pray come seek the lord and i'll do it at home i got enough and but after a while when they began to get pricked when they finally realized it was what was required was more than what they had they kept having a deaf ear to the word of god that was being preached they were not willing to die out more to themselves in order to get filled up with the holy ghost that a lot of times god wants to fill us i think the prophet taught us that he wants to give us the holy ghost more than we want it he talked about the great pressure that's that there is behind god wanting to just give it to us but we don't i can kind of take it or leave we don't even have a pressure to get it right we don't even feel that pressure second when they came to the grips that they needed more they were so distant from god that they actually sought it through other believers wow can i read some quotes brother branham said in the message revelation chapter 4 he says look at the sleeping virgins oh what did she do they had to sell something in order to buy her oil what did she have to sell her old creeds her denominations and things she sold out all she had in order to find christ christ that great jewel she had to sell everything saints think about it paul said i have suffered the loss of all things and count them but dung that i might win christ now satan comes to church with us he sits next to us and he tells us all the time that we've given enough we're not considering the cost to be elect [Music] in the message 10 virgins and a hundred and forty four thousand jews i don't know if i ever read that message brother brahm says judas come up remember the sleeping virgins you say uh could be inspired by the devil absolutely still living clean yes sir judas did he was saved sanctified preached divine healing cast out devils why he just right straight up almost the same thing that the rest of them was but when it come to the pentecost that's where he showed his colors he did not receive the holy ghost and turned up his heels and denied the lord jesus that's exactly what the churches did when it come to pentecost the bless the pentecostal blessings they got away from it oh don't you see it class i i i read this and to me whether i'm sitting there or i'm preaching it here i feel i need more of the holy ghost and i know this is this to me seems like the same vein that these last few services have been coming with but i really feel that god wants our little church to be crying out more to him i just feel that saints and you know i'm not a uh an evangelist to to get your your your feelings and emotions kind of arise to a place to want to do that i understand that but i'm hoping that the word is what you're in love with and that word will make a difference in your life in the message handwriting on the wall brother man says you know there were virgins that went out to meet him and five were still virgins but but were foolish virgins that didn't keep oil in their land i love how he said that because remember they had a bit of oil because otherwise it wouldn't have said that their lamps went out the fact that they went out means they had it but they didn't have enough they didn't take any with them they thought that the their attitude was the what i have here is adequate and that's what i'm trying to get across that the the voices that come to us and say that we have enough is so wrong they didn't keep oil in their land they didn't keep seeking it and though they were virgins just the same as others they were not permitted to the wedding supper so far be it from any people here tonight to be included so they would be excluded from the presence of lord included in that group of the virgins with no oil in their lamps i just say you know may there not be a soul here today of that group but i'll say it like this the devil still speaks to us and may this word today just be something that we can put uh as as a combat against the enemy when he comes to us and tries to just get us to lay back and it calls us to just seek more of god amen in the message god being misunderstood he says now if you were with us in the last teachings in revelations you'd find out that those virgins the five foolish virgins were not lost but they were not permitted to go into the wedding supper right but they suffered persecution and martin they were raised again in the general resurrection in the last day those are the people who were he separated the sheep from the goat see they stood before judgment call them goats in the message were the foolish virgins where are the foolish virgins questions and answers one of the questions questions 406 were where are the foolish virgins during the millennium brother branham said in the millennium they're in the grave and he quotes the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years in the patentless church age brother man says for when he comes the books will be open that is when even the luke warm church and the foolish virgin will appear now he now he's saying he's calling them both the same the lukewarm church and the foolish virgin will appear he will separate the sheep from the goats when he comes he will take over the kingdom for it is his and with him will be thousands times ten thousands his bride who will come to minister to him oh i hope you like to minister to people because that's what we're going to be doing oh it is now or never brother batman says repent before it's too late he said wake up from amongst the dead and seek god to be filled with his spirit or you will miss it amen do it now while there's time amen in the message of sardian church age brother brahm said it is the second resurrection wherein the five foolish virgins come up notice they were virgins they did not have the holy spirit so they missed being in the bride but i'm sure they were justified which is a part of the holy ghost and they were even sanctified because they were virgins but brother branham says they still didn't have the holy ghost meaning that they didn't have enough what was required by god okay let me read that again they did not have the holy spirit so they missed being the bride while the five wise who had oil became a part of the bride so we're considering the cost here but these people being a separate god-loving people and trying to abide by the word according to what they knew and being helped in the work of the lord will come up at the end time they will miss the millennium which you can begin to see by these truth is much more important and wonderful than we've ever thought or believed i love it in the message god's wrap gift brother bram says they're gone back the sleeping virgin's gone back to buy some oil but that's when he come while they were gone after it so how close are we now when we see these great churches coming back saying well maybe we've left off something somewhere we better find it they'll never get it just remember that they'll never never get it they're dead they're dead and dead and that's all they'll never come to life just remember i speak in the name of the lord and this is on tape yes sir they'll never never come into life they're done so that's the reason i'm not interested in them programs i'm interested in one thing blasting just as hard as i can to whom so ever will everybody isn't going to get excited about this message and i understand that and i don't think we're called to try to get everybody in to to doing it if they don't feel to do it that's not the call the call is to get the word to the bride and they need to hear this this this message is for the bride it's not for the foolish virgin it's to the elect turn with me if you would to luke chapter 18 verse 1. great peace have they that love thy law and nothing shall offend them i say when you come to church be determined don't let anything offend you don't let any word offend you don't let any person offend you don't let anything offend you love god love his word luke 18 verse 1 and he spake a parable unto them to this end that men ought always to pray and not to faint saying there wasn't a city a judge which feared not god neither regarded man there was a widow in that city and she came unto him saying avenge me of my adversary and when he would not for a while but afterwards he said within himself though i fear not god nor regard man yet because this woman troubled me i will venture lest by her continue climbing coming she weary me and the lord said hear what the unjust judge saith he wants us to consider what this unjudge was saying and then he says and shall not god avenge his own elect which cry day and night unto him though he bear along with them i tell you that when that he will avenge them speedily nevertheless when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth what a paradox that god is presenting about the end time here the purpose of this parable was to get god's own elect to pray more now that was the purpose of this parable it was for no other purpose i'm not saying can't be used for other purposes but this was not for the foolish virgin this was not for the church-goer this was for god's own elect it's true that men ought always to pray and not faint but jesus wasn't trying to get us to pray a little bit more he was literally trying to get us to cry out to him day and night there's a big difference right the ramifications of not praying enough is a spiritual fainting that's when a person becomes spiritually weak frail weary and become unconscious of their condition they become spiritually incoherent of things they're not spiritually in tune they become disconnected spiritually in other words they begin to feel a need of nothing that's being said it's definitely a scary condition to be in now naturally just before a person faints they start to feel weak and dizzy maybe their knees begin to wobble exhausted about ready to lose consciousness they become incoherent now that word means without logical or meaningful connection disjointed like they can't perceive what's being said and they're just kind of like they're ready to leave they can become physically irrational or confused now jesus being able to see the condition of believers in this hour just before his second coming he knew that there would be spiritual co-inherit people without faith and without trust they didn't have a trust connection with jesus they would be in a state of disorder perplexed bewildered disjointed or disconnected are you with me just say amen to the word amen so in the worst state that god has ever seen man because this is the worst hour there is the question arises when the son of man cometh shall he find faith on the earth and i'm speaking of the necessary faith to make a rapture amen so god is looking for faith and today we sitting in this room we're looking for faith and he sends a message to his little bride he says you may not understand why i'm bearing along with you why i'm not coming right away but i will avenge you i will come to your rescue speedily in my time i'm not going to avenge you i'm not going to avenge those who just pray once in a while you need to keep praying you need to pray with your veil amen i'm coming for the ones that are crying out day and night amen for the ones that cried so much that you would think that they would just be troubling me the ones that would be saying oh god avenge me of this old pestilence this thing that stands in a way for me serving you the way i want to serve you amen and that's what it's going to take to find faith the faith that we're looking for the faith that we need and it's going to be what it takes to for god to see the faith that he's looking for in us when you're crying out to god it's showing you've got faith in god when you're just sitting here and saying well i believe i'm in the message i'm a believer i'm i'm not bright i'm let i'm predestined you don't do nothing you're not showing god you've got faith that's the devil's interpretation of that the attitude of the elect is a continuous crying out a continuous seeking more of god now that is the attitude of the light and god points it out here he's typing the the bride that will be crying day and night with this woman who kept asking for help consider the cost consider the cost the attitude the foolish virgin is to cry out to god once or twice a month and think that's enough we don't really need the day and night we don't need that attitude because we're a lot instead of finding out in the scriptures what the elect does we're trying to to prove that we're elected instead of using the scriptures that are able to make us wise virgins wise unto salvation we've got to get desperate for god in this last age and then when we get desperate we need to stay desperate we won't be able to lukewarm our way into a rapture friends jesus said seek ye first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and all other things shall be added unto you now the more problems that the devil can present to you you've got problems with this problems with these 25 things in your home these 25 things with your work these 25 things with your family these 25 things with the church you know you just don't got time to seek god first that's what makes this age so hard because we feel that we have a reason not to carve out some time to come to church and seek god before a service or get away through the course of the week more than ever we need to be seeking god and i can't help this is like maybe a message that isn't that what you would like to hear but it is the message that we need there's a difference you all know me if i wanted to please you and make you happy i know how to do that but if i seek to please men i would not be a servant of christ and i'm more interested in your souls i'm more interested in you making a rapture than i am of anything else in the message questions and answers brother brahm said the holy ghost ought to be more important to you than any than everything else there is in the whole world your prestige your life your job your anything that there is you should never cease until you have it you must receive it now here's the thing now saints i will never judge a person whether they got the holy ghost or don't i cannot stand here today and say and everybody that i know in my life i can tell they got it or they don't got it god did not make me give me that or make me that in fact the prophet taught that he didn't know who was who now when you're under the anointing and you're strong and your spirit bears witness with their spirit and i mean there are times that you catch a glimpse of the holy ghost in somebody's life but to really know whether they got it or they don't got it so we have to preach the word in such a way that we all must get it amen and so we're not here about trying to make anybody feel in any sort of negative way because this message is coming across i'll say it like this to you that have the holy ghost seek more seek more to those that are questioning seek more that's for you to those that know you don't have it see more it is for you for many are called but few are chosen we are we are expressing how you know you can be chosen amen when you consider the cause we need all of god to get in amen he said you should never cease until you have it you must receive it it must be the most and he and you say well i'm afraid that at my work or i'm afraid that my husband don't be afraid that that be first place let everything else go let that be first well i expect to get it one of these days brother branham no not one of these days now this is the time let it be first before i do anything else let me have it now he said get desperate amen that would help answer our question when you get desperate for it you really got to have it or die then is when you are going to get it we're almost done can you say praise the lord amen thank god for his word amen god is awesome but he just doesn't unveil himself to anybody at any time anywhere now he can but he just does it that's just not his nature in fact jesus said in matthew 11 verse 25 the father has hid these things from the wise and prudent and he's revealed them to babes showing us that he's more likely to show some people things and most likely not to show others not things the father has reserved all revelation of jesus christ you can't get it from one another he can only get it from the father jesus said in matthew 13 that he spoke parables to hide the truth from some while revealing it to the others that was the purpose why he spoke in parables of course we like the story part helps us catch it but that story being so simple hides it from the others there was a time that the lord revealed himself to paul but not to others on the road to damascus there was more with him heard sounds voices saw lights action took place but only one man got it and the rest of them didn't get it think about that obviously god is looking to get something more out of the trade right than just telling people about him and he deserves us coming through the door of jesus christ and his requirements he wants us to cry day and night not to slow down but to continue pressing in he doesn't want us to be a thief or robber come some other way some easy way right because why do people steal because it's easy stealing is easier than working you know it's much easier just to no god wants us to cry out to him proverbs chapter 6 verse 6 go to the ant thou sluggard and consider her ways and be wise so being a sluggard we might say is unwise the ant when we consider her ways is wise which having no guide oversea or ruler provided her meat in the summer and gathered their food in the harvest how long without sleepless sluggard when will thou arise out of thy sleep yet a little sleep a little slumber a little folding of the hands to sleep god wants us to consider how an ant works tirelessly endlessly to build her future and i understand we've been predestinated from the foundation of the world and i'm grateful for that we wouldn't be here today without that right and i understand that we're to claim that we're the elect i understand that i believe that but there's no scriptures that just say sit back because the more i sit back the lazier i get the less i feel like studying the less i want to go to church the less i want to hear about the do's and don'ts i mean i would like just to stay and do what i want until the rapture comes and then i'm changed that'd be ideal but you know what i take all that time and never show jesus christ any love this is the only place that we have a chance to save somebody you're not going to have that chance on the other side what a way to express your love to god that you care about somebody's soul one of those requirements that god wants is our hearts god wants to see all of our heart into it crying day and night jeremiah chapter 29 verse thing and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart now i know we've read this before and i just believe it's it's just part of the same thing that god is is drawing us to seek him with everything we got amen how can we ever go wrong by putting all of our heart into god it will never be in vain it will never be wrong deuteronomy chapter 6 verse 5 and thou shalt love the lord thy god with what with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might brother branham said like this lay everything aside until you get perfect love lay everything aside well there's a cost to getting perfect love it's laying things aside that you feel that you can do at the same time of getting it now that perfect love is complete love this is my last quote this morning and then they'll be getting into afternoon and we'll be start the afternoon quotes faith is our victory brother branham said oh if we had more gallant men like that how many wants to be a gal man oh if we had more gallant or women men like that that would purpose in their heart if i'm a christian i'm going to find out every divine blessing that belongs to me and claim it if the bible teaches that i can receive the holy spirit i'm going to stay on my knees till i get the holy spirit and not just drift off gallant i believe the bride is gallant the brand says i was reading old uncle buddy robinson's life story some time ago and he was such a great man a loving man and a man of faith and he got to hungering for the holy spirit because the bible taught it i love that the bible taught it and it says that one day he was out plowing corn and he stopped the old meal his name was alex and he got down in the corn row and he said god if you don't give me the baptism of the holy spirit when you come back to earth you'll find my bones lying right here that's purposing in your heart that's really getting down to business now when you get that kind of purpose in your heart god is going to open up the windows of heaven something has to take place you've got to get down to business with god and have some purpose some gratitude for him saving you i already said thank you how many times you ever do something for somebody i mean you all experience this you put a lot of time into it and you get a thank you that is all you get i feel so sorry for the the sisters and brother run who cooked these meals they wore labor so much for a meal and sometimes i was like is a thank you to me showing gratitude is much more than the words thank you and sometimes it's hard for us to just really worship the lord and say thank you after a service after the word has come god wants to see some appreciation for salvation what he's done for us wow he did it last week last month last year last decade when we get to heaven we're not going to be going hey we already thank you for salvation we'll get on to other let's play some nintendo games now we're going to be worshiping god for eternal life those scars are going to be on his hand he wants us to remember what he did for him i don't think we should ever stop just being thankful for so great of salvation amen let's stand together so consider the cost of being chosen consider the cost of being chosen consider crying day and night to be more like god i know it's a high cost but it's one we can do with honor we can feel it's such an honor to be seeking god amen i know it's hard but it's god's way everything else that we do that's outside the word we don't have thus saith the lord we have if it be the lord will we have feelings emotions thoughts desires but in the midst of a world that's going crazy insane and our lives are just becoming more and more filled with things carve out more time just more time another amount of time on a daily basis if you can only do five minutes a day do five minutes a day but start to push towards this this crying every single day for the lord i like to say like this i'm i'm not much of a carnival got to do something but just stay there till you cry every day cry day and night whatever it takes to get you filled with more of god because when you have the holy ghost it's not a feeling it will make you feel good but sometimes it will also hurt when he calls you to do something it may require you to suffer the thing is you will know there's a difference that's taking place in your life your life will begin to change i like what brother stan is talking to brother stan one time he heard brother alex preaching and he said brother john something happened in that service i can't explain it i don't know but something happened that i do know and that's how it is with god you cannot explain god who can explain god who can explain the love of god who can explain laying down your life for others you can't explain it but you know it's him god's calling us to cry out to him more i believe if we do our part god is faithful to draw nigh to us and fill us with him that we may have power in this last age as the elective god to move in the direction whatever he calls us to do i certainly don't want to be working for the lord without the power of the holy ghost amen that would just make me a denominational believer i don't want that amen let's sing um oh saying to be like jesus to be like jesus to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i love to be like him [Music] through life's journey from earth to glory i own the earth to be like him [Music] to be like jesus to be like jesus on earth i love to be like in all through life's journey from earth to glory i only have to be like him let go let god have his wonderful way let go and let god have his

will vanish your night turn today let go and let god have his way [Music] let go let god have his way amen i wonder would you consider what god wants you to do this very moment with the word that he has given you do you think god wants you to let go of anything maybe there's something inside of you that god's been asking you to let go take his advice let it go lay it everything else aside just spend some time falling in love with him [Music] make love to him make love to god you can do that you don't have to wait till you get to heaven to make love with god he loves you you are his bride he is your husband he's your spiritual husband [Music] maybe maybe there's been some things that you've been a little selfish with you haven't been given god enough time maybe you've been satisfied with just crying out to him once in a while but you feel him saying my son my daughter oh will you just come and cry out to me i want to avenge you but i need you to cry out to me i need you to feel like you're bothering me get to the point where you're just spending so much time with me that you get desperate you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart won't you consider
