[34:07] Commandments we know him okay go down to
[34:11] verse 28 down at the bottom of the
[34:12] chapter and now little children abide in
[34:15] him that when he shall appear we may
[34:18] have confidence and not be ashamed
[34:20] before him at his coming if you know
[34:23] that he is righteous you know that
[34:25] everyone that doeth righteousness is is
[34:27] born of him that's right and then on to
[34:31] chapter three behold what manner of love
[34:33] the father hath bestowed upon us that we
[34:36] should be called the sons of God
[34:38] therefore the world knoweth us not
[34:41] because it knew him not amen beloved now
[34:44] are we the sons of God and it does not
[34:46] yet appear what we shall be but we know
[34:49] that when he shall appear we shall be
[34:52] like him amen for we shall seek him as
[34:55] he is and every man that hath this hope
[34:57] in him purifieth himself even as he is
[35:01] pure let's pray Heavenly Father we thank
[35:04] you for this uh portion of your word
[35:06] that you've given us here tonight and
[35:08] Lord we just pray that you would bless
[35:10] each one that's come out and made the
[35:12] sacrifice only you can reward that
[35:14] sacrifice but Lord bless the word to
[35:16] each one maybe those that are watching
[35:18] on the screen bless them at home that
[35:21] something may be said that would perk
[35:23] them up that would bring them into
[35:24] reality and give us the uh courage and
[35:29] the strength that we need to move on
[35:32] help us now in Jesus name amen you may
[35:35] be
[35:36] seated so our title tonight our journey
[35:39] the hope of the Resurrection we're not
[35:42] just another church down the road we are
[35:45] God's people and he has been kind to us
[35:48] he's given us uh word to believe word to
[35:52] live
[35:54] by and uh our Elijah said God's big clo
[35:57] clock ticks perfect you don't have to
[36:00] worry about whether things are on time
[36:02] things are are right on time won't be
[36:05] one minute fast or when it be behind
[36:07] it'll be just exactly on time on
[36:10] schedule and perfectly balanced or his
[36:13] words now just so happened the way
[36:16] brother John built this Pulpit there's
[36:18] nowhere to put this level so we're going
[36:20] to put it over here and assume that this
[36:22] is also a level over here because the
[36:25] level is for you to focus on we got to
[36:29] be balanced if you're not balanced those
[36:31] nice cars won't go down the road too
[36:33] well you got to be balanced and your
[36:36] machine shop things are perfectly
[36:38] balanced probably got a real nicer level
[36:41] over there right and so all through
[36:44] scripture we find in the year of or in
[36:47] the year that a certain King died in the
[36:49] month in the year and sometimes very
[36:52] specific dates you know throughout
[36:54] scripture and so I'm only here to remind
[36:57] REM you of what has been spoken I'm not
[36:59] here to bring you any shortcuts any you
[37:02] know magic words no a minister only says
[37:07] what has been spoken at the right time
[37:09] and so in this earth we live by the
[37:11] calendar we live by the clock this just
[37:14] the way we're built but everything that
[37:16] has been everything that is everything
[37:17] that will be is governed by the word of
[37:20] God Amen by prophecy whether you believe
[37:24] it or not or like it or not God is in
[37:27] control of every detail that's right
[37:29] that's why you're sitting where you're
[37:30] sitting tonight that's why you wore a
[37:32] blue shirt brother Ron God knows the
[37:35] details okay and
[37:38] so the scripture is our road map okay uh
[37:44] it's our book of directions and God has
[37:47] sent a Vindicated Prophet to make it
[37:49] clear now if you don't think it's
[37:51] Vindicated well then you haven't read
[37:52] far enough you haven't listened far
[37:53] enough you don't know your Bible amen
[37:56] God has sent us a indicated profit and
[37:59] if I seem a little rough well it's
[38:00] because I got two and a half years to
[38:01] make up with you
[38:03] know now the reason I haven't been here
[38:06] for those two and a half years I've been
[38:07] busy I wasn't sitting over at the house
[38:08] I wasn't at the beach right just in the
[38:11] last 6 months I've been to Africa to uh
[38:14] two different countries and I've been to
[38:17] South America and I've been to
[38:20] Mexico and these people are in need just
[38:24] like you're in need they're baptized
[38:25] Believers and they want to hear and so
[38:27] we go and we you know tell them the
[38:30] truth so all the modern events that we
[38:33] see today have already been made clear
[38:36] by prophecy these things have been
[38:38] predicted and you lived long enough to
[38:40] see the Vindication so here we are in uh
[38:43] what was it February of 25 we can't go
[38:46] back the way it used to be we can't go
[38:48] to either side we can only go forward
[38:51] okay so the clop keeps ticking keeps
[38:55] ticking and everything we deal with is
[38:58] time sensitive so as time uh is ticking
[39:03] we need to make serious preparations for
[39:07] the catching away of the Bride we don't
[39:09] have to worry about the Fulfillment of
[39:11] the prophecies God will take the
[39:13] prophecies and bring them at the right
[39:14] time he doesn't need our help he tells
[39:17] us in the word be still I'm God I got to
[39:21] figure it out don't need your opinions
[39:23] see and so our only real concern today
[39:28] is to be ready for the resurrection
[39:31] because that's coming quick then the
[39:33] Rapture you see so making preparations
[39:36] for the catching away the Bible says in
[39:39] Revelations 19:7 his wife ha made
[39:41] herself
[39:43] ready okay how do we make ready stay in
[39:46] the word he's given us the word he's
[39:48] given us a Vindicated Prophet we have no
[39:51] excuse okay so in the getting ready
[39:53] there's four things to keep in mind and
[39:56] to put in practice every day
[39:57] we went over those with the men now it's
[40:00] time for you ladies to make uh some
[40:02] notes also to stay balanced and to get
[40:06] ready for the Rapture you um will read
[40:11] at least one chapter out of your Bible
[40:13] now this is every day starting today not
[40:16] next week starting today you read at
[40:19] least one chapter out of your Bible you
[40:21] read at least one page out of your
[40:23] church age book you listen to at least
[40:25] 20 minutes of God's Prophet it's on
[40:27] every telephone on the planet no excuse
[40:30] and you pray at all times whether it's
[40:32] quietly or whatever so as you're driving
[40:35] down the road and stay away from the
[40:36] crazy people yeah cuz they they they
[40:40] drive worse than I do and so you you can
[40:42] pray you can listen to God's prophet and
[40:45] brother Brown says Prayer Changes Things
[40:48] prayer changes death to life it it's
[40:50] it's the greatest tool we have he says
[40:52] prayer changes sickness to health
[40:54] changes Sinners to Saints it is prayer
[40:57] you may laugh too much you may shout too
[40:59] much you may eat too much oh why do you
[41:02] put that in there but you will never
[41:04] pray too
[41:06] much okay Paul says over in 1 Timothy I
[41:10] will that every I will therefore that
[41:12] every man pray everywhere lifting up
[41:15] holy hands without wrath or doubting
[41:18] amen so we can never pray too much okay
[41:22] and prayer isn't God I need I need you
[41:24] know like a little CH child waiting for
[41:26] Christmas no prayer is to enter into the
[41:29] atmosphere of God's word and he will
[41:31] take care of the details so as you put
[41:34] these four steps together and put them
[41:36] in your life uh you'll have peace in
[41:39] your home and you'll be in contact with
[41:41] your heavenly father and you'll be
[41:44] preparing for the Rapture okay so
[41:47] there's a reason for those things and uh
[41:50] if they don't work we sure and call me
[41:51] let me know but you see today every one
[41:54] of us is on a journey
[41:58] and um we're on a journey to the Gate of
[42:01] Heaven okay and there are many
[42:03] distractions along the
[42:05] way many things that would distract us
[42:08] and so how do we remain focused on the
[42:11] goal and not wander off on the side
[42:13] roads well we have a voice on the dash
[42:15] of our car or the phone it's called GPS
[42:19] right and in the spiritual journey we
[42:23] have a GPS God's positioning system
[42:27] it's magnetic and it pulls us towards
[42:29] the word of God Amen we have our Hope on
[42:33] the
[42:34] resurrection other churches don't you
[42:36] know people out there they're just
[42:37] wandering they don't have the focus we
[42:39] have now the resurrection is the
[42:42] Cornerstone of our entire message
[42:44] believe it or not our Prophet said it's
[42:47] the Cardinal resting place of the Gospel
[42:50] no matter what he did if he did not
[42:52] raise again from the dead then all of it
[42:53] was in vain it proves to me that he was
[42:56] God and I I think it's the great
[42:57] coronation of the Full Gospel is the
[42:59] resurrection and its Divine promises
[43:02] amen so to my opinion the resurrection
[43:04] is the greatest of all the promises and
[43:06] the things of the
[43:08] scripture and uh Paul says over in 1
[43:11] Corinthians if in this life only we have
[43:13] hope in Christ we're of all men most
[43:16] miserable see but there is a
[43:18] resurrection for those that have
[43:20] surrendered their entire being to Jesus
[43:23] Christ and can say Amen to all the word
[43:25] of God not just just the favorite Parts
[43:28] you see anybody can
[43:30] repeat but only the few can live and
[43:33] take it serious all the others will
[43:36] continue to play Church the day after
[43:38] the
[43:39] resurrection that's when the church will
[43:41] be full after the resurrection after
[43:43] we're gone they'll be crowding into the
[43:45] church oh Lord please just like all the
[43:48] people in the days of Noah once the door
[43:50] was
[43:51] closed anybody know how many days
[43:54] passed seven days and then the rain came
[43:58] amen now in those seven days they were
[43:59] throwing eggs and tomatoes but when the
[44:01] rain started oh hey I'm sorry let us in
[44:04] too late God is on schedu Amen okay so
[44:10] we're on this journey and as Believers
[44:12] in God's word we come from a long line
[44:15] of Travelers okay remember our title
[44:19] Journey to the resurrection so the
[44:22] children of Israel traveled for 40 years
[44:25] enjoying many blessings of God
[44:27] and daily provisions and they enjoyed
[44:30] healing but their Journey was UN was
[44:32] characterized by
[44:34] unbelief God's people yeah all that
[44:37] Journey was characterized by unbelief
[44:40] Abraham traveled about 500 miles from
[44:42] haran to Hebron and his trip was
[44:45] characterized by faith elezar retraced
[44:49] those same 500 miles to go find a bride
[44:52] for his master son and he was
[44:54] accompanied by an Angel remember yes his
[44:57] his journey was characterized by success
[44:59] amen then we have our friends Mary and
[45:02] Joseph they traveled about 90 miles from
[45:05] Nazareth down to Bethlehem obeying the
[45:08] law they didn't ask for a pass oh she
[45:11] was very pregnant oh you got to go so
[45:14] under very difficult circumstances you
[45:16] know and so they were traveling uh a
[45:20] long way at that time on a donkey maybe
[45:23] walking so God's clock is ticking okay
[45:28] there's no shortcuts no excuses and
[45:31] there's many more that we could go
[45:32] through the Bible but uh the most
[45:34] difficult Journey was taken by Jesus
[45:36] Christ Our Lord and when he went to the
[45:39] northernmost part of Israel called
[45:42] cesare Philippi it was the northernmost
[45:45] point of his journeys and then he
[45:47] started traveling south and so his
[45:51] travels are in Matthew 16 and so he's
[45:54] walking you know it's about 140 miles
[45:57] down to Jerusalem you can go check it
[46:00] out but then once he got down there from
[46:05] the temple across the Kidron Valley to
[46:07] Gethsemane with his disciples it's about
[46:09] 600 yards then back over to Jerusalem as
[46:12] a
[46:13] prisoner to the private cell in the
[46:16] house of the high priest caus about 700
[46:19] yards then out to Pilot's judgment Hall
[46:22] condemned without a proper trial about
[46:24] 500 yard and out to Cal calary as a
[46:27] convict another 700 yard total of about
[46:29] a mile and a half the most difficult
[46:32] Journey okay and there at Calvary They
[46:37] Crucified him amen it was all done
[46:40] according to the words of prophets we
[46:42] might want to condemn those people that
[46:44] they were in their line of duty doing
[46:47] what was prophesied you see so um the
[46:51] predestinated seed of God throughout
[46:53] Seven Ages that's you and me were
[46:56] traveling see we're traveling and our
[46:59] journey today is from right here in dark
[47:01] Le DEA to the gate of the Resurrection
[47:04] how far closer than you could think it's
[47:08] very close and so uh a long time ago
[47:12] brother brand was preaching in the um
[47:16] islands of the Caribbean and he had some
[47:18] American people with him and one of the
[47:20] brothers said that he had a interview
[47:21] with brother brandom one of those days
[47:23] down there in uh 1959
[47:27] and he asked brother brandom in the long
[47:29] time they talked why do you speak about
[47:32] 77 and brother Bram said well it's
[47:35] because when I was looking through the
[47:36] stream of time so he's seing numbers
[47:39] stream of time he said when it got to 77
[47:43] it was so dark I didn't see how any
[47:45] believer could live in such
[47:47] Darkness okay you don't have to make me
[47:50] a math genius to know they were a long
[47:51] way from 77 right 40 years plus and so
[47:55] it's much darker
[47:57] much closer to the Rapture and we need
[48:00] to stay ready amen so when you're
[48:03] darkening when we're experiencing the
[48:05] darkness of Lea remember the words of
[48:08] Jesus over in John
[48:10] 17:20 and if I was a real smart person I
[48:13] could know all this by heart but that's
[48:15] not me so in John 17:20 we have where he
[48:19] says here um his words to the
[48:24] disciples he's in prayer here and he
[48:27] says neither pray I for these alone
[48:29] these 12 I've got right here but for
[48:32] them also which Shall Believe on me
[48:35] through their word and that's what we
[48:38] have here the word of witnesses you see
[48:41] okay so you were in the mind of God
[48:44] before he ever went to the Cross brother
[48:47] brandom says over here now we're going
[48:48] to talk about a journey how that God
[48:50] brought his people out of Egypt into the
[48:52] promised land a perfect type of leaving
[48:55] sin coming into the Spirit land now
[48:58] there are three stages of this journey
[49:01] Israel in Egypt Israel in the journey
[49:04] and Israel in
[49:05] Palestine he says which are all a
[49:07] perfect type of justification by faith
[49:10] coming out of you know good people in
[49:13] sin coming out two sanctification as
[49:16] they pass through the blood you know in
[49:18] our journey and baptism of the Holy
[49:21] Ghost entering into rest is perfectly
[49:23] the stages of the church that is where
[49:26] the church is stag now now he's speaking
[49:29] this over 70 years ago but we're still
[49:31] in that same time zone you see so the
[49:34] church this one and all the rest they're
[49:35] like a hospital there's nobody at the
[49:37] door asking for your credit card you're
[49:39] welcome come in and so some today are in
[49:43] the journey they're coming out of
[49:45] they're passing through
[49:47] justification others are going through
[49:49] the blood through the process of
[49:51] redemption sanctification and others are
[49:54] resting in the Holy Ghost okay all
[49:56] forming the Church of Jesus Christ in
[49:58] this journey to the
[50:00] resurrection any questions so far good
[50:04] so um we're marching forward we are
[50:09] making progress sometimes it doesn't
[50:10] look like it but we are making progress
[50:13] amen so the prophet says and I'm I'm
[50:16] quoting a bit quite a bit from the
[50:17] prophet because he was the Vindicated
[50:19] mouth of God and got some great material
[50:23] he says now we're moved by the holy
[50:24] spirit in going into the Promised Land
[50:26] In My Father's House of many mansions if
[50:28] it were not true I would have told you
[50:29] I'll go there and prepare a place for
[50:31] you is that right now we have a promised
[50:33] land that we're going to John 14 you
[50:36] know we have a destination each day
[50:38] marks a
[50:40] milestone okay it's like the river out
[50:42] here water's gone this is new water you
[50:46] ever wonder where all that water comes
[50:47] from I mean the Ohio River down there it
[50:49] just keeps flowing it's huge it's a mile
[50:51] wide but anyway um he says here um and
[50:55] there's a big Dark Shadow set setting
[50:56] out yonder before us it's called death
[50:59] and every time our heart beats we move
[51:01] one step closer to that one of these
[51:04] days it's going to take its last beat
[51:06] and we're going in okay I want to be at
[51:10] my I want to be at my time they see
[51:14] people in other countries have no clue
[51:15] what he's talking about well that's
[51:17] Kentucky English for be
[51:19] ready as I hope each one of you is
[51:22] tonight be ready at your time when I
[51:25] know that it's is when I know that it is
[51:27] lying before me and I have to meet it I
[51:30] don't want to be a coward I want to wrap
[51:31] myself in the robe of his righteousness
[51:34] walking into it knowing this that I'm
[51:36] sure that I know in the power that I
[51:38] know him in the power of his
[51:39] resurrection and when he calls from the
[51:41] dead I'll be called out with them that's
[51:44] living God is a god of the living it's
[51:48] not a god of the Dead like the Catholic
[51:49] church with all the PE you know Saints
[51:51] and all that no that's that's not true
[51:54] in another place he says I imagine when
[51:56] the ages roll on he will just still be
[51:59] better all the time when we look back
[52:01] and see what God has brought us out of
[52:04] brought us through and brought us into
[52:07] the Christian life is a journey this
[52:10] here is a pilgrimage and we are just
[52:13] passing through this land we're not
[52:15] going to stay here no many times we
[52:17] build a house and we say well the family
[52:19] and I anchor down here but for how long
[52:22] you don't know that's right and we
[52:24] always would like to get to a place
[52:25] where we could say this is ours for good
[52:28] but it isn't here on Earth no we don't
[52:31] have such a place here on Earth but
[52:33] there is something in you that calls out
[52:35] for such a place and before there could
[52:36] be anything uh in you calling out for
[52:39] that place that place had to be in
[52:41] existence or there would be nothing here
[52:43] to call for that's right the Deep cannot
[52:46] call unless the deep is there to respond
[52:48] to it so there has to be a place first
[52:51] to make this deep call out so he he
[52:55] drops these you know nuggets everywhere
[52:59] to help us in uh tape called communion
[53:02] 62 we want to keep out of the blood at
[53:05] all times but we don't know just what
[53:07] might happen so you have none of us have
[53:10] a guarantee of the sunshine tomorrow no
[53:15] so we got to stay
[53:17] ready doesn't matter how doesn't matter
[53:19] how much broccoli you eat how much ice
[53:21] cream you refuse there's a line in the
[53:23] road and you don't know where it is so
[53:26] stay
[53:28] ready
[53:30] um all things are about wound up we feel
[53:33] Lord that the coming of the Lord is at
[53:35] hand so he's praying here and we are
[53:38] fixing to take a journey and as we think
[53:40] of a journey we might think of suitcases
[53:41] and extra clothing extra shoes but how
[53:43] different is this journey it's not
[53:45] packing up it's unpacking laying aside
[53:48] that's as your great servant Paul said
[53:49] in the book of Hebrews 12th chapter we
[53:51] lay aside every weight and the unbelief
[53:55] that so easily besets us that we might
[53:57] run with patience the race that is set
[54:00] before us
[54:01] Amen on this journey we have three kinds
[54:04] of Believers now I didn't write the book
[54:08] I didn't tell brother BR what to say but
[54:11] he said in every group there's three
[54:12] kinds of Believers amen so take his word
[54:15] for it and the word is preached to all
[54:19] equally we don't discriminate and the
[54:22] church is like a hospital there's the
[54:24] unbeliever the makeb believer they're
[54:26] just along temporarily they're just here
[54:28] for a while okay and they're kind of
[54:31] enjoying the free
[54:32] ride because they have very little
[54:35] invested see the make believer and
[54:37] unbeliever they don't pay tithes they
[54:38] don't get involved they got very little
[54:41] invested so they'll soon have to jump
[54:44] off because they can't handle the
[54:46] pressure or the responsibility of the
[54:48] preaching of the word okay and they look
[54:52] like Believers and they do a good job
[54:55] you they might look better than of us
[54:56] sometimes but they're impersonators they
[54:59] can quote but they can't live it 100%
[55:02] amen so don't waste your time judging
[55:06] them okay it's a waste of
[55:09] time God knows who they are he knows who
[55:12] are his and he'll take care of the
[55:14] separating at the right time see um and
[55:19] he's in charge of giving out the rewards
[55:21] so he knows he doesn't need our Canary
[55:24] brain to help him out okay but the True
[55:26] Believer feeds on the word of God every
[55:28] day and he enjoys the four steps read
[55:32] scripture read the prophet listen to the
[55:35] prophet and pray don't forget those so
[55:38] um he feeds on the word of God it's his
[55:41] life Source along the way he stays true
[55:45] he stays in step in the correct
[55:47] atmosphere and he stays
[55:49] balanced the scripture says in Romans
[55:51] 3:23 all have
[55:53] sinned all the Martin children all the
[55:57] Smiths all the randoms they all Sinn and
[55:59] come short of the glory of God we can't
[56:01] can't reach it on our own none of us
[56:04] were born angels I know I I've had
[56:07] beautiful little children but they're
[56:08] Little
[56:11] Liars you learn that pretty soon they
[56:14] they just come wired that way you know
[56:16] amen so they're beautiful but uh just
[56:20] Sinners born in sin and come to the
[56:22] world speaking lies St John 3 we begin
[56:25] to get a glimpse of the three kinds of
[56:28] Believers now the the pope of Rome loves
[56:33] you know part of the scripture and
[56:36] um you know God so loved the world well
[56:40] that's nice well it sounds like
[56:41] everybody's going wait a
[56:44] minute for he gave his only begotten son
[56:48] that whosoever believeth oh there's
[56:50] something involved yeah believeth should
[56:53] not perish but have everlasting life for
[56:55] God had not sent his son s into the
[56:56] world to condemn the world but that the
[56:59] world through him might be saved now we
[57:02] didn't make that up he that believeth on
[57:04] him is not condemned but he that
[57:06] believeth not is condemned already
[57:08] because he hath not believed in the name
[57:11] of the only begotten Son of God Amen so
[57:13] people come into the world certain ways
[57:16] you believe you're here okay so God
[57:20] knows whose are his and um he knows
[57:24] what's going on so there's definitely
[57:27] hope for the believer those who make the
[57:30] right
[57:30] choice so to get to an unfamiliar place
[57:34] like I did the other day coming over
[57:36] here um we used to study the road map
[57:40] now you older people remember the big
[57:41] road map we had but do you remember it's
[57:43] an alphabetic order if you're going from
[57:47] Michigan to Wisconsin it's not the next
[57:49] page it's way back there you know and so
[57:53] but now we have the electronic map
[57:55] that's right there on your dash or it's
[57:56] on your phone uhhuh you have a voice to
[57:59] guides you every step if there's a
[58:02] driveway she'll say the second right
[58:04] they they got it all figured out they
[58:06] can see amen they see through the snow
[58:08] and through the dark it's amazing you
[58:10] know amen so in this journey God has
[58:12] drawn the lines he's highlighted certain
[58:14] points of interest you know certain
[58:16] verses and the promises for each age for
[58:19] his children to arrive at the
[58:22] resurrection amen you simply have to
[58:24] study the map yes and it doesn't come by
[58:27] osmosis you have to get in there and
[58:29] read it like we used to do in school you
[58:31] had to read right and so um and that way
[58:35] you know the promises for your day
[58:38] you'll never be lost you'll simply
[58:40] recognize the plan of God and you'll
[58:42] recognize the sign oh that's what he
[58:44] said yeah it's right there all these
[58:46] things are happening he's already been
[58:47] telling us that's right amen you know so
[58:50] he'll Quicken the truth to you and God
[58:52] has even provided a voice to remind us
[58:56] and you will be finding the shortest
[58:59] route now if you get off you know that
[59:02] other sound comes on you turn you turn
[59:06] it warns you you know so along the way
[59:09] we all have certain regrets and we can't
[59:12] change the past wish we could would you
[59:15] make some changes absolutely yeah me too
[59:19] so the only thing we can do is repent
[59:21] ask for the blood of Jesus Christ to
[59:23] cleanse us from unrighteousness correct
[59:25] our attitud ude and we can uh March
[59:29] together as we read the scriptures now
[59:33] this isn't going to be long but we'll
[59:34] try to say things that going to help you
[59:37] things maybe you haven't thought about
[59:38] so as for the present God gives us
[59:41] breath today in order to live and make
[59:43] decisions that will affect our future we
[59:46] already know what mistakes we made we
[59:49] don't need to be reminded of that but
[59:51] this was a learning process and we came
[59:54] through some things it's a learning
[59:55] process
[59:56] and uh we we you know try not to make
[59:59] the same mistakes twice mistake is one
[1:00:02] thing but if it continues it's a bad
[1:00:04] habit which alerts you to the fact that
[1:00:06] you're Anointed with an evil spirit and
[1:00:08] you have a besetting sin it's in
[1:00:11] scripture so you need to genuinely
[1:00:14] repent ask for prayer get yourself under
[1:00:17] the influence and the anointing of God's
[1:00:19] word that's why the four steps don't
[1:00:21] forget them and into a correct spiritual
[1:00:24] atmosphere
[1:00:26] God's R God's bride makes yourself ready
[1:00:29] all the others don't care you see so in
[1:00:32] today's lesson we're simply attempting
[1:00:34] to remind you of the truth we're not
[1:00:37] here to condemn but come face to face
[1:00:39] with the truth you see brother Ram said
[1:00:43] simply you've got tapes on that you've
[1:00:44] got tapes on what we believe it's on
[1:00:46] every cell phone yes sir you don't have
[1:00:48] to go buy anything it's right there see
[1:00:51] so as a as bride that we're on this
[1:00:53] journey in
[1:00:54] 2025 um we need to take advantage of the
[1:00:57] four steps daily that way we stay in
[1:01:00] tune we stay in in in step with God's
[1:01:03] program now according to Philippians 4:7
[1:01:06] we can actually have the peace that goes
[1:01:09] beyond all
[1:01:11] understanding see all I know is that
[1:01:13] John is a good man and has a shop over
[1:01:16] there I don't understand what they do he
[1:01:18] understands that now the peace that God
[1:01:20] gives me goes beyond what I understand
[1:01:23] you see and it goes beyond all criticizm
[1:01:26] M all religious fanaticism legalism and
[1:01:29] only that God can keep you in peace in
[1:01:32] your heart and in your mind through
[1:01:34] Jesus Christ not through reciting
[1:01:36] something no through Jesus Christ Paul
[1:01:39] also wrote to the early Church in Rome
[1:01:42] in Romans 8 the spirit itself Bears
[1:01:45] witness with our spirit that we are the
[1:01:47] children of God and if we are children
[1:01:49] then we are HS HS of God joint HS with
[1:01:52] Christ if so be that we suffer with him
[1:01:54] that we may also will be glorified
[1:01:56] together for I reckon that the
[1:01:58] sufferings of this present time are not
[1:02:00] worthy to even be compared with the
[1:02:02] glory that shall be revealed in us see
[1:02:06] so not only in Christ will the glory be
[1:02:08] revealed not only in the prophet of this
[1:02:10] age will the word be made alive but in
[1:02:12] Us in Flesh and Blood Believers just
[1:02:15] like me and you Hebrews 13:8 is true
[1:02:18] today Jesus Christ isn't wasn't just the
[1:02:20] same yesterday today 1965 and then
[1:02:24] forever sometime no today hey we are
[1:02:26] part of the picture so as we make this
[1:02:29] journey we have ups and downs we have
[1:02:31] rejoicings we got sufferings we got
[1:02:33] setbacks we got victories and it is The
[1:02:37] Minister's duty to encourage and remind
[1:02:40] us and keep the people focused on the
[1:02:43] present truth we don't need a minister
[1:02:45] to tell us what Trump said no the
[1:02:47] newspapers are full of that it's it's on
[1:02:49] every phone all that's going to it's
[1:02:51] just going to roll on right now for you
[1:02:53] people that think that that he's the
[1:02:55] Great
[1:02:56] white uh hope no all he's doing is
[1:03:00] resetting the thermostat a little bit
[1:03:02] temporarily it's still going to burn
[1:03:05] there's no making it great again it's
[1:03:06] going to burn you know
[1:03:10] so um we want to stay focused on the
[1:03:15] scriptures that pertain to the truth of
[1:03:17] the day that we're living in amen great
[1:03:20] tape that you could listen to in your
[1:03:21] spare time discernment of spirit 1960
[1:03:25] here he is praying and we are here this
[1:03:28] morning Father gathered for no other
[1:03:30] purpose but to know and to study to know
[1:03:34] rather the will of God and what we must
[1:03:37] do to make Christ real to the people of
[1:03:40] this generation yes there's The
[1:03:42] Minister's job right there make Christ
[1:03:44] real to the people of this generation
[1:03:47] I've been living for a long time I'll be
[1:03:49] 80
[1:03:50] and did I say August so I've seen some
[1:03:54] generational changes
[1:03:56] and so he says knowing surely that in
[1:03:58] the day of the Judgment we will be
[1:03:59] brought face to face with this
[1:04:01] generation and being ministers we will
[1:04:04] be judges and those people to which we
[1:04:07] have spoken to and their attitude
[1:04:09] towards the word that we bring them will
[1:04:11] determine their Eternal
[1:04:13] destination all about
[1:04:15] attitude therefore Lord in that day we
[1:04:18] will be a judge for or against the
[1:04:19] generation that we preach
[1:04:21] to so when we travel we got to make
[1:04:24] preparations now I've been in the
[1:04:26] airport and I've seen people that did
[1:04:28] not make
[1:04:29] preparations they didn't comb their hair
[1:04:31] they didn't even get out of their
[1:04:32] pajamas amazing we have to check the
[1:04:35] schedules we got to plan ahead and our
[1:04:38] God is not an author of confusion amen
[1:04:41] you see he's very organized he's very
[1:04:43] much on
[1:04:45] schedule the prophet says God in his
[1:04:48] great and wise Providence moves every
[1:04:50] Cog just to hit at the right time and
[1:04:53] that gives us Faith sometimes when we
[1:04:55] think oh everything's just Topsy turby
[1:04:58] there is no way out don't think that God
[1:05:00] is making it all work together exactly
[1:05:03] to his time program it's on time he he
[1:05:08] he can see the whole picture you see
[1:05:10] he's the master he knows the schedule so
[1:05:13] we have
[1:05:14] Moses and if you read your Bible you'll
[1:05:17] see where Moses was 40 years in Egypt
[1:05:21] okay and so he was one step from the
[1:05:24] throne he was the man he was right he
[1:05:26] was right there he was Pharaoh's
[1:05:28] daughter's son you know she you realize
[1:05:31] he's got that name Moses because a pagan
[1:05:34] princess gave him the name yeah amen you
[1:05:37] think God might have been in charge of
[1:05:38] all that amen that's right yeah so but
[1:05:42] he was on a journey okay he had all the
[1:05:45] servants there he had he lived a life of
[1:05:47] luxury but Prophet says now Moses after
[1:05:51] taking the situation in his own hand
[1:05:53] what' he do oh if I'm the deliver I'll
[1:05:56] just kill all these sorry people and
[1:05:59] then we'll be in charge that's not the
[1:06:00] way it works no he found out that he was
[1:06:03] a total failure and he ran from the
[1:06:05] presence of pharaoh ran from the
[1:06:07] presence of God and was a stranger for
[1:06:10] 40 years out
[1:06:11] there and he married an Ethiopian girl
[1:06:14] and before you get too excited they were
[1:06:16] all pretty much the same color back then
[1:06:17] so don't get too excited about that and
[1:06:19] so she had a lot of temper oh and Moses
[1:06:23] had a lot of temper oh sound like a
[1:06:26] problem that was his trouble I would
[1:06:29] just imagine things weren't so peaceful
[1:06:30] back there on the back side of the
[1:06:31] desert at
[1:06:33] times in other words it was tough you
[1:06:36] know wasn't always pleasant but it was
[1:06:39] God's
[1:06:40] program so he says if you think you
[1:06:43] married a woman that has a little temper
[1:06:45] maybe God is trying to tame you down a
[1:06:47] little and vice
[1:06:51] versa and then out there what was God
[1:06:53] doing he was schooling into the man's
[1:06:55] mind
[1:06:56] what the program of God was now why
[1:06:59] didn't Moses just pay attention the
[1:07:01] first time because he was human just
[1:07:03] like us amen that's right so here's
[1:07:07] Moses out
[1:07:08] there desert he's he's he's watching the
[1:07:12] Sheep he's hurting these sheep out there
[1:07:14] so they're going out there now uh
[1:07:18] Zapora his wife they have they probably
[1:07:21] had a nice tent probably was no twom man
[1:07:23] tent was probably a nice tent but it
[1:07:25] wasn't house out on the desert the
[1:07:27] Sand's blowing all the time so she had a
[1:07:29] big job keeping that tent clean okay got
[1:07:32] the picture and so here comes Moses he's
[1:07:35] been out with these sheep all day long
[1:07:37] now sheep have a lovely nature yes nice
[1:07:39] nature but they
[1:07:42] stink and so Moses been with the Sheep
[1:07:44] all day long he comes home and um and
[1:07:48] the first thing he hears Moses shoes
[1:07:51] trying to keep this place clean
[1:07:53] please nobody at the palace treated him
[1:07:55] like that back then he just had to stand
[1:07:59] there and they dress him you know he had
[1:08:00] it made but out here on the desert with
[1:08:02] with Zapora she's trying to keep the
[1:08:05] tent clean so he's got to take his shoes
[1:08:07] up every day the same old story you know
[1:08:10] so um then one day he's out there with
[1:08:14] the sheep and he sees this bush on fire
[1:08:17] well that's weird and so he gets over
[1:08:19] there and the first thing Mo God said
[1:08:22] Moses yeah yes sir shoes
[1:08:26] see God Was preparing him back there at
[1:08:27] the tent for when God would speak to him
[1:08:31] you already had heard that before so God
[1:08:34] was using a high-tempered woman to speak
[1:08:37] some sense into his mighty Prophet Moses
[1:08:41] and all the prophets are
[1:08:44] humans so Moses back there waiting
[1:08:47] hurting sheep out in the desert perfect
[1:08:50] picture of us here tonight a Believer
[1:08:52] out of fellowship with God
[1:08:55] there he was no Fellowship not one thing
[1:08:57] in 40 years that God spoke or did for
[1:08:59] him any Supernatural he was out of
[1:09:01] fellowship and when the church gets out
[1:09:03] of fellowship with God Miracles cease
[1:09:06] signs and wonders cease Revival cease
[1:09:09] God just moves right on when you get out
[1:09:11] of Fellowship the thing to do you to
[1:09:15] remedy prevent this is to keep the love
[1:09:17] of God in your heart am keep fellowship
[1:09:20] with him and he will add these other
[1:09:22] things as we mature amen and there's
[1:09:26] where we as humans 21st century
[1:09:29] everybody with a you know a nice
[1:09:31] expensive phone we want to get ahead we
[1:09:34] want to help God we want to help push
[1:09:36] the cart no as we mature he'll give us
[1:09:39] what we need that's right you
[1:09:41] see so Moses out of Fellowship no
[1:09:44] Fellowship out there in strange country
[1:09:46] among strangers not his own people she
[1:09:48] was Ethiopian he was a Jew and they're
[1:09:50] completely out of the reach of God
[1:09:51] seemingly and God all the time knowing
[1:09:54] that no matter how much of a mess that
[1:09:56] man makes out of the program of God God
[1:09:59] is going to straighten it out so there
[1:10:02] is hope you see so in traveling we got
[1:10:06] to be aware of the dress code I know
[1:10:09] it's foreign language to a lot of people
[1:10:11] used to be a difference between men and
[1:10:13] women
[1:10:15] traveling now in every airport that I've
[1:10:17] been in there's a little
[1:10:19] sign one's got a dress other's got pants
[1:10:23] well if they want to get serious all the
[1:10:24] people with pants go here all the ones
[1:10:26] dresses go over there now if they don't
[1:10:28] know which the one they are I guess they
[1:10:30] can go outside you know but they're used
[1:10:33] to be a dress Co people used to dress up
[1:10:35] a little bit not now you know hairstyles
[1:10:40] Etc and
[1:10:42] so Prophet says here and usually
[1:10:44] Prosperity causes sin
[1:10:47] yes many people look on Prosperity as
[1:10:51] blessings it would be if we could handle
[1:10:52] it right but it usually leads to sin
[1:10:55] dishonoring God you know selfish
[1:10:59] arrogant and how Israel had drifted off
[1:11:01] into terrible sin got away from God got
[1:11:03] away from his uh Commandments his
[1:11:06] precepts and they went off on another
[1:11:08] tantrum the women walked in the streets
[1:11:10] in their fine immodest
[1:11:13] clothes I mean he Nails these things and
[1:11:16] this is 1963 long time ago some of you
[1:11:21] wern't even born you know and so um
[1:11:25] there fine in modest clothes you see God
[1:11:28] made you the way you are ladies and
[1:11:30] gentlemen but Satan is the one that
[1:11:34] designs the clothing so you got to be
[1:11:37] careful don't let it get to you so he
[1:11:42] says the men were went about gambling
[1:11:43] and drinking the road houses we call it
[1:11:46] today strip clubs and um places of
[1:11:49] amusement wide open in the city sin was
[1:11:51] disregarded by the ministry just laying
[1:11:53] wide open sin was not rebuked from any
[1:11:55] Pulpit anymore it was on the loose way
[1:11:58] of a true Prophet you see one thing that
[1:12:00] Satan has accomplished here in
[1:12:02] Lea better than any time in history he
[1:12:05] has blurred the lines between right and
[1:12:08] wrong he's blurred the lines of
[1:12:11] distinction between men and women it's
[1:12:14] we're all the same no we're not the same
[1:12:17] did you watch the president's
[1:12:18] inauguration oh there's men and there's
[1:12:20] women get it straight so it's going to
[1:12:23] it's going to get ugly here in a little
[1:12:24] bit you know
[1:12:26] so um brother brand had words for such
[1:12:29] stuff like that he said Tommy rot
[1:12:30] perversion sodomites and we're living in
[1:12:33] the middle of insanity I don't know if
[1:12:35] you realize 1964 brother BM said if this
[1:12:38] goes on the way it is now so whatever he
[1:12:39] was focused on he said if this goes on
[1:12:43] the way it is now in 50 years there'll
[1:12:45] be Total
[1:12:46] Insanity and that Circle was closed in
[1:12:50] 2014 so we've been 11 years total insan
[1:12:56] that's why it's the way it is so be
[1:12:58] careful how we throw rocks at the
[1:13:00] churches and the L SE and system when we
[1:13:02] permit our children to dress the way
[1:13:05] they do children must live your
[1:13:08] convictions until they have their own
[1:13:11] bible-based
[1:13:12] convictions okay now great message
[1:13:16] anointed once at the end time I was
[1:13:17] sitting from here to the piano watching
[1:13:20] him preach this message he said well
[1:13:23] whether we are Baptist Methodist Presby
[1:13:25] and Pentecostal we're all the same we
[1:13:26] are not the same you are a separated
[1:13:29] people holy unto the Lord dedicated to
[1:13:31] the word of God and the spirit of God to
[1:13:34] bear fruit of his promise in this day
[1:13:37] and you are not one of them I know
[1:13:40] that's awful strong but it's the truth
[1:13:42] just the same you are dedicated to a
[1:13:44] service in this last day come out from
[1:13:47] amongst it I don't care how real it
[1:13:49] sounds how much they try to impersonate
[1:13:51] it's a lie if it's contrary to God's
[1:13:54] word
[1:13:55] of this
[1:13:57] hour black and white I don't care what
[1:14:00] it is if it's contrary to the word if
[1:14:03] it's contrary to the written word of God
[1:14:04] for this hour it's a lie God will have
[1:14:07] nothing to do with it no matter how
[1:14:08] sincere how educated how smart how true
[1:14:11] it sounds how reasonable it sounds if
[1:14:13] it's contrary to the word of this hour
[1:14:16] so according to St Paul the ministry
[1:14:18] must be properly equipped okay for the
[1:14:20] journey we have 2 Timothy 3:16 And1 17
[1:14:24] and we we have um Church age book
[1:14:28] chapter 4 verse
[1:14:30] 189 Faithfully taught you got to be
[1:14:33] properly equipped and in this journey we
[1:14:35] have to have proper papers now everybody
[1:14:38] has a birth certificate you know can't
[1:14:41] leave the hospital without it proving
[1:14:43] that you were born where and when and
[1:14:46] some actually go on to get a passport
[1:14:48] okay and you can travel to many
[1:14:50] countries but to travel to certain
[1:14:52] difficult places you got to have a Visa
[1:14:54] stamp in your passport so again natural
[1:14:57] birth birth certificate born again is
[1:14:59] your passport and baptism of the Holy
[1:15:02] Ghost is your visa and
[1:15:04] so one of my favorite subject is beyond
[1:15:08] the curtain of time where he says he
[1:15:10] says now I Heard a Voice then that spoke
[1:15:13] to me and it was in the room and said
[1:15:15] this is what you preached was the Holy
[1:15:17] Ghost this is perfect love and if you
[1:15:19] haven't heard those things it's in
[1:15:20] rejected King uh May 15th of 1960 this
[1:15:25] is perfect love nothing can enter here
[1:15:28] without it it's what the angel told him
[1:15:29] and I am more determined than ever in my
[1:15:31] life that it takes perfect love to enter
[1:15:33] there my precious friends my beloved my
[1:15:35] darlings of the Gospel my begotten
[1:15:37] children unto God listen to me your
[1:15:39] pastor I wish there was some way I could
[1:15:41] explain it to you there are no words I
[1:15:43] cannot find them anywhere but just
[1:15:45] beyond this last breath is the most
[1:15:48] glorious thing there's no way to explain
[1:15:50] it there's no way I just cannot do it
[1:15:53] but friends whatever you do lay aside
[1:15:55] everything else till you get perfect
[1:15:59] love get to a spot that you can love
[1:16:03] everybody every enemy everything else
[1:16:06] that one visit there has made me a
[1:16:08] different man I can never never never be
[1:16:10] the same brother
[1:16:12] Brandon because he saw what it really
[1:16:15] was am uh a few months later just
[1:16:18] remember I'll say this with the faith
[1:16:20] that I have in that Vision whatever it
[1:16:22] was and I'll speak it in the name of the
[1:16:24] Lord except except you have that perfect
[1:16:26] love you will never be there because
[1:16:28] nothing could ever be there without it
[1:16:30] your spirit would be out of
[1:16:33] place my friends you old people you
[1:16:36] young people you don't know what time
[1:16:39] you're going to leave we don't know that
[1:16:42] but let me persuade you as a Christian
[1:16:43] brother one that loves you except you're
[1:16:46] born again and the spirit of God love
[1:16:47] comes into your heart you will certainly
[1:16:49] miss that place so we have
[1:16:53] every opportunity
[1:16:55] so we might we've got to make our
[1:16:57] preparations we have to have dress code
[1:17:00] equipped with proper papers and so forth
[1:17:02] and one more thing when you travel Anita
[1:17:05] back there you got to be
[1:17:08] flexible sometimes things happen got to
[1:17:11] be flexible and there's a precise
[1:17:14] schedule only God knows the details we
[1:17:17] get zealous he come up we come up with
[1:17:19] private ideas and interpretations why
[1:17:20] can't I park here I'm so and so no
[1:17:23] garage is over there you no
[1:17:25] so you got to obey the law so we figure
[1:17:27] out we make plans and you can count on
[1:17:30] for one thing for sure God will uh only
[1:17:34] be subject to his word you see that's
[1:17:37] right he'll fulfill his word on schedule
[1:17:40] no room for Fanatics or legalists along
[1:17:43] the journey you're going to face
[1:17:45] Temptations trials
[1:17:48] pitfalls but the scripture promises that
[1:17:50] we have a high priest that we can he can
[1:17:53] be touched by the feeling of our
[1:17:54] infirmities
[1:17:55] because he was tempted in all points
[1:17:56] just like us but without sin okay his
[1:18:00] mercy and understanding extends to all
[1:18:03] the
[1:18:04] trip because the word of God tells us
[1:18:06] the mercy of God is to all generations
[1:18:09] when we're tempted we have an advocate
[1:18:12] we can come boldly into his presence and
[1:18:14] seek his Mercy it is like an oasis a
[1:18:17] refreshing that's why we have prayer
[1:18:19] meetings that's why we have private time
[1:18:20] in prayer that's why you you get into
[1:18:22] the word that's where you find a refresh
[1:18:24] in in your strength see we're not
[1:18:27] victims we're Overcomers we're more than
[1:18:30] conquerors in Jesus Christ Our
[1:18:33] Captain Revelations 12:11 says they
[1:18:35] overcame him by the blood of the lamb
[1:18:38] and the word of their testimony
[1:18:41] balance see this cross down here the
[1:18:43] long part of the Cross is your prayer
[1:18:45] life you you do your part and stay in
[1:18:48] prayer God will take care of the
[1:18:51] horizontal
[1:18:53] okay in our journey we become Restless
[1:18:56] we've seen a lot of that haven't we we
[1:18:58] develop a bad attitude when we get
[1:19:00] Restless like when you're traveling
[1:19:03] and you want to eat but it's still 30
[1:19:06] minutes
[1:19:07] away started angry you
[1:19:10] know where's the promise of it coming
[1:19:13] all things continue the same I'm getting
[1:19:15] tired of the pastor always preaching
[1:19:16] right at
[1:19:17] me griping complaining yeah it happens
[1:19:21] we get bored too much free time
[1:19:24] but if we'd spend that same free time
[1:19:27] and energy reading the word you'd be
[1:19:30] surprised I can calm you down you can
[1:19:32] start anywhere it doesn't matter you see
[1:19:35] anywhere you open the Bible you got you
[1:19:37] got two pages they can make a full movie
[1:19:40] out of those two pages wherever you
[1:19:41] start true so just go in there true you
[1:19:44] know when a preacher tells me ran out of
[1:19:46] things to preach he's not reading his
[1:19:47] Bible that's for sure because anywhere
[1:19:50] you open your Bible there's something
[1:19:52] there that you can latch on to okay so
[1:19:56] read the word pray for others and the
[1:19:59] journey will seem a lot shorter you see
[1:20:02] and our attitude will improve in direct
[1:20:04] proportion you see from the by the
[1:20:07] verses that we read back here in first
[1:20:10] John where it said and now little
[1:20:13] children abide in
[1:20:15] him that when he shall appear we may
[1:20:18] have confidence and not be ashamed
[1:20:20] before him at his coming if you know
[1:20:23] that he is righteous you know that
[1:20:25] everyone that doth righteousness is born
[1:20:27] of him so along the way we see signs
[1:20:31] telling us that we're getting closer you
[1:20:32] know to Detroit or wherever we're going
[1:20:35] and um so we make adjustments you know
[1:20:37] getting closer and it's time to get
[1:20:39] serious the holy spirit is not
[1:20:42] shortsighted like we are okay our God
[1:20:45] can see the entire Journey you can see
[1:20:48] the end from the beginning and he can
[1:20:50] see through time and space he knows all
[1:20:52] about the fusses you had this week he he
[1:20:54] knows all about the people that short
[1:20:55] changed you at the coffee shop or
[1:20:57] whatever and um uh he knows what your
[1:21:01] attitude's going to be when you get home
[1:21:02] and try to go to sleep and you were
[1:21:04] critical about what was said tonight God
[1:21:07] can see all that amen that when brother
[1:21:10] John's preaching wsh just zip it God
[1:21:14] brought you here he wants you to hear
[1:21:15] something you
[1:21:17] know so he's not
[1:21:19] shortsighted um and um now we can hide
[1:21:23] things from one another oh we come in
[1:21:25] here smile soon as we get in the car did
[1:21:30] you see what she was wearing you know
[1:21:33] but we can't hide from God he sees all
[1:21:36] he knows all you see and the devil has
[1:21:39] traps set be careful because leosa is a
[1:21:44] landmine yeah it's a Minefield and our
[1:21:47] attitude towards God's word and God's
[1:21:49] Messengers will determine our
[1:21:50] destination I just read it to you so
[1:21:54] character is not a gift it's a victory a
[1:21:58] victory you have to fight for something
[1:21:59] you know things you have to overcome to
[1:22:02] obtain the character Peter was rough
[1:22:06] Mary was mild but both had things to
[1:22:08] overcome Peter was Peter and Mary you
[1:22:11] know they both had to go to the upper
[1:22:13] room so character is not a gift no
[1:22:16] matter what your name is right you can
[1:22:18] be
[1:22:19] John's favorite child or whatever you
[1:22:23] know no that doesn't matter everybody
[1:22:25] has to go through stuff so we're on a
[1:22:28] journey we have expectations of the
[1:22:31] reunion is going to take place when we
[1:22:32] arrive we'll see our loved ones we
[1:22:34] haven't seen for years those days are
[1:22:36] coming brother Bram told one brother he
[1:22:39] said in one of these days you're going
[1:22:40] to be in the house taking care of things
[1:22:42] and you're going to hear a knock on the
[1:22:43] door and you go open the door true
[1:22:46] there's
[1:22:47] Rebecca there's your mother whatever you
[1:22:50] know he's planned it so well that he's
[1:22:53] got it he's got it figured out he brings
[1:22:56] our loved ones to us right at the end of
[1:22:58] the trip we've been instructed that you
[1:23:01] know just before the going away there'll
[1:23:04] be a period a month or
[1:23:06] so now the Bible says over here in Acts
[1:23:10] chapter 1 where's it
[1:23:13] at
[1:23:14] um in Acts chapter 1 it says
[1:23:18] here he showed himself alive after his
[1:23:21] Passion by many infallible proofs being
[1:23:23] seen of them 40 days that's a month or
[1:23:26] so case you Haven figured it out that's
[1:23:28] right speaking of things pertaining to
[1:23:30] the kingdom brother brandom said right
[1:23:32] here in Wisconsin he said right at the
[1:23:35] end there will be the resurrection and
[1:23:40] we'll be together a month or so and then
[1:23:43] we'll go yes
[1:23:46] so we'll have time to take care of the
[1:23:49] greetings and the fellowship and so
[1:23:50] forth when he takes us to his house all
[1:23:52] the attention will be on him not worried
[1:23:55] about who made it who didn't make it you
[1:23:56] see he is a jealous God if you haven't
[1:23:59] read that part jealous is one of his
[1:24:02] names
[1:24:04] so we'll know that the resurrection is
[1:24:08] on when you see your dad or your grandma
[1:24:11] you'll know something's
[1:24:14] up um I don't know if I told you this
[1:24:17] before but Bears repeating uh a friend
[1:24:20] of mine he God deals with him in dreams
[1:24:24] and so he in one of his dreams he said
[1:24:26] he was in
[1:24:27] heaven uh but it's other dream he was
[1:24:31] like a fly on the wall he could see
[1:24:33] brother brandom's living room and he
[1:24:36] could see brother Neville and sister
[1:24:38] brandham sitting in chairs and me and
[1:24:40] Rebecca were sitting over by the
[1:24:41] fireplace in this dream and so then they
[1:24:45] were talking and so then brother Neville
[1:24:47] got up to leave well he left in March of
[1:24:51] 1974 and so then sister Rena went over
[1:24:53] to the door to see came out and she left
[1:24:55] in May of '
[1:24:57] 81 so they're over by the door and so
[1:25:01] then they said to Rebecca come over here
[1:25:03] so she comes over and she left in
[1:25:06] November of
[1:25:07] 06 so they're by the door and I'm still
[1:25:09] sitting by the fireplace and so they
[1:25:11] look back at me and they said you keep
[1:25:13] doing what you're doing amen and that's
[1:25:15] why I'm here tonight amen keep doing
[1:25:16] what you're doing thank you so some of
[1:25:19] us have been on this journey longer than
[1:25:20] others you see and we have much more to
[1:25:23] be accountable for we have a great
[1:25:25] responsibility you realize that I'm one
[1:25:27] of the last living witnesses that new
[1:25:31] William brandom there there's hardly
[1:25:33] anybody left so I've got to get great
[1:25:36] responsibility we've seen many signs it
[1:25:39] all depend it's pointing that we're
[1:25:41] almost home
[1:25:44] so I realize we have Christians of all
[1:25:46] ages here but you see we're on a journey
[1:25:50] together yes and I just want to see you
[1:25:53] on the other side yes
[1:25:54] when you get there whatever it is look
[1:25:57] around you'll see me I'll have some dark
[1:26:00] hair might not have mustache I don't
[1:26:02] know but I just invite you to make
[1:26:05] Christ the main Center of your life get
[1:26:09] serious and don't let another day go by
[1:26:11] without applying the four steps may God
[1:26:14] bless
[1:26:15] you
[1:26:17] [Applause]
[1:26:19] Lord job
[1:26:25] amen love that
[1:26:29] word an encouragement to us to keep on
[1:26:32] the
[1:26:34] journey
[1:26:37] there's there's always going to be
[1:26:39] distractions you you get up how many's
[1:26:42] how how often has this happen I'm GNA
[1:26:44] get up this is what I'm going to do I'm
[1:26:45] going to do this I'm gonna do this and
[1:26:46] it never
[1:26:49] happens I have heard this many times at
[1:26:52] work my son will come in he'll make a
[1:26:54] list of things that he needs to get
[1:26:56] done and he'll 6 hours later I I only
[1:27:01] got I sometimes I didn't get one thing
[1:27:05] done so one is we got distractions and
[1:27:08] the other is we don't always know what
[1:27:10] our footsteps are ordained to do and we
[1:27:13] just have to trust the
[1:27:15] Lord I believe we've been encouraged
[1:27:18] today what we need to do to make sure
[1:27:21] that we're staying focused on our
[1:27:22] journey we don't get distracted
[1:27:25] and if we could just humbly apply these
[1:27:29] I believe that we're going to see our
[1:27:30] brother on the other side we'll find out
[1:27:32] whether he's got that mustache or not
[1:27:35] and um and the Bible says forever be
[1:27:39] with the Lord amen let's stand
[1:27:45] together forever be with the
[1:27:51] Lord amen let just bow our heart in a
[1:27:55] word of prayer and go before
