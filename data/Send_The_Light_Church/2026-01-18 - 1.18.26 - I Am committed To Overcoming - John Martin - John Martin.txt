You know, God will never pull his hand away from you. &gt;&gt; We pull our hand away from him in the city where the lamb is light. Hallelujah. I'm looking forward to it. There's a country far beyond the starry sky. There's a city where there come night. If we're wait, we shall go there by and by. In that city where the lamb is lie. In that city where the lamb is lying. In that city where there cometh no night. Hallelujah. I've a mansion over there and we're free from toil and care. I am going where the lamb is alive. Here we have our days of sunshine. But we know that the sun that shines upon us now so bright will be changed to clouds and rain until we go to that city where the lamb is alive. In that city where the lamb is lie. In that city where there cometh no night. I have a mansion over there and we're free from toiling care. I am going where the lamb is alive. There the flowers bloom forever and the day hallelujah shall be one eternal day without an eye. and our tears shall be forever wiped away. In that city where the lamb is alive. In that city where the lamb is the light. In that city where there cometh no night. I have a mansion over there and we're free from toiling care. I am going where the lamb is alive. Here we have our disappointments all the while. And our foundest hopes might meet the bitter blind. Though by night we weep and mourning brings a smile. In that city where the lamb is alive. In that city where the lamb is the light. In that city where there cometh no night. I've imagined over there and I'm free from care. I am going where the lamb is alive. Then let sunlight fade and let l bring its gloom. Not a shadow can my blissful soul fly. For I know that up in heaven there is room. In that city where the lamb is alive. In that city where the lamb is alive. In that city where there cometh no night. I've imagined over there and we're free from toil and care. I am going where the lamb is alive. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; How about you? I'm glad that &gt;&gt; won't be no need of batteries. Won't be no need electricity. &gt;&gt; He is the source. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. This home is not my world. Amen. This world is not my home. I'm I'm just passing through. My treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue. The angels back in me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels back in me from heaven's open door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. They're all expecting me. And that's one thing I know. I fixed it up with Jesus a long, long time ago. I know he'll see me through though I may weak and poor and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels beckoning me from heaven's open door. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Just over in the glory land will live eternally. They saints on every hand are shouting victory. Their songs us pray. We're back from heaven shore. And I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Oh Lord, you know I have no friend like you. If heaven's not my home, then Lord, what will I do? The angels back in me from heaven's open door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You know, you you look around you, you think, am I the only one? You know, this world is getting stranger. &gt;&gt; But that just shows us we're not from here. &gt;&gt; So, we let's just change the order of service and um just uh uh just take some needs up before the church.

Let's just remember all the missionaries throughout the world. Amen. We know that there's a lot of things going on. It's time to stand up for Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen, brother. So, let's just keep that in our hearts this morning. Let's receive the word as it comes to us. And uh I'm ready to get out of here. &gt;&gt; So, let's just go on one accord this morning. Dear heavenly father, Lord, as we assemble in your house this morning, Lord, we believe, Lord, that we're here for a purpose, Lord, not to just, Lord, just feed on your word, Lord, by God, to just spread the word, Lord God, to all those that don't know it, Lord. Put a spirit in us, Lord, of thanksgiving. Put a spirit in of of praise, Lord, this morning, Lord. And as your word comes this morning, Lord, we pray that it would just resonate in our hearts and our minds, Lord. Just we pray for Elizabeth Murphy this morning that has Lord, in the hospital and every day, Lord, it seems like something else is growing stronger in her life and harder, Lord God. But Lord, you are a mighty God, Lord, and you're a God that is just in time, Lord God. We pray that your spirit would just be upon her, Lord, and that she would just find peace and a settleness in her heart, Lord, and might say that it's all all is well in her heart, Lord God. We pray for her family, Lord, in this time, too, Lord Jesus. For all those that aren't here, Lord, for brother Ben and Sister Linda, Lord, for the Beckman's, Lord, for Brother Roger, Lord, for whatever, Lord, we we're not complete because we're a body of Christ without them.

Uh it just makes us want to do better, doesn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. and certainly appreciated that song uh brother Ferguson just to a testimony to God of what God has done for you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe we all need to share in some way what God is doing in our life and and just keep um testifying of how great God is. Amen. Let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer before we begin to read his word. Amen. How many has a request on your heart today? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Our heavenly father, we come before you. We thank you, Lord, for this warm building. We thank you that we could worship you this morning and uh praise you for Lord, this is why we've come into your house is for you to meet with you and to connect with you and to honor you Lord to give thanks for all that you've done for us &gt;&gt; now. Lord, we just pray that you would meet every need that were that would be amongst us in our midst. Lord, you see the hands that were raised. You see those, Lord, that are battling some sort of sickness or something. Lord, we just pray that you would come and be the unseen guest, the Jehovah Gyra, to meet every need that we would have. &gt;&gt; And Father, we humbly pray now that you would give us ears to hear what you have to speak to us, Lord. And let us be able to leave here, as brother Ron said, with a a a revelation uh of of of of what you speak to us, Lord, that we might be just better overcomers and to come into the image that you have uh predestined us to come to. Lord, bless the reading of your word now as we look into. Bless the preaching, bless the ears, Lord. Father, there be the the tricks of the enemy to try to have our minds just go on different things and be distracted and uh to walk in and out of the sanctuary and just the different things, Lord, that the enemy would try to do. And I just pray that you, Lord, your love would captivate us. Lord, your your word would captivate us. Though, Lord, we may not be an elegant speaker, but Lord, your word trumps every situation. Lord, we so commit ourselves to you in this time. Give you the honor in advance now. For we pray in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Turn with me if you would to the book of Revelations uh chapter 3. Um God speaking to um to our church, speaking to our church, to our generation, to the last church age. Uh here in chapter 3, we're going to read verse 21. To him that overcomemeth will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my father in his throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then in Revelations chapter 21, Verse number seven. &gt;&gt; Revelations 21 verse number 7. He that overcomemeth shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. You may be seated. I didn't know if uh the request got in for Sister Linda Helms, but she had requested prayer for uh Davian's deliverance and that she had been up through the night and that's why they were not here this morning. Sorry if that request was supposed to get in by me. Let's just remember to pray for her. So good to see brother Orlando. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Are you seeing how are you seeing today? &gt;&gt; You're seeing pretty good. Yes, God's God's given us bodies, but then our bodies begin to uh but we have a new body waiting for us that we'll never have to have surgery. &gt;&gt; We'll never have to take any any pills, any aspirin pain pills, &gt;&gt; and we'll be forever &gt;&gt; in his presence. Amen. &gt;&gt; We like to entitle this message, I am committed to overcoming. Amen. &gt;&gt; And somebody had handed me this title and said, "We need uh if you would do a service, I think you should do a service on this." And uh so if you want a sermon on something, that is how you get it. Just turn in a little note. And uh &gt;&gt; we need a vision for our lives. &gt;&gt; Without a vision for our lives, we're going nowhere. Without a vision for our children, they would not go nowhere. The Bible says without a vision people perish. &gt;&gt; And overcoming is crucial. &gt;&gt; It's crucial to a a nature change, a body change, and a rapture. Just because we've accepted Jesus Christ, just because we've been baptized, does not mean that we're going into a rapture. &gt;&gt; Overcoming is imperative to sit with God on his throne and to inherit all things. Salvation is not being an overcomer. &gt;&gt; I know it's a it's a strong statement, but we have an example of that. The Lord save the people out of the land of Egypt. He heard their cry and he came down and he delivered them. Psalms 34:18 says, "The Lord is nigh unto them that have a broken heart and saveth such of a contrite spirit." And that's where the children of Israel were. They were they're crying under bondage. They were broken their their spirit. And and so they were crying out and God saved them. He literally brought them out of Egypt, but you know, the Lord did not did not overcome for them. &gt;&gt; He saved them, but he did not overcome for them. &gt;&gt; They had to go through the wilderness and prove that they were overcomers and take the promised land. &gt;&gt; Amen. So overcoming is is not a a gift. Okay? So salvation is a gift, &gt;&gt; right? We're saved by grace. It is the gift of God, not of works. But overcoming is not a gift. God does not gift overcoming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Character is not a gift. Right? It's a victory. So it's something where we have to do something in order to get it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jude 1:5 says, 'I will therefore put in remembrance, though ye once knew this, how that how that the Lord having saved the people out of the land of Egypt, afterwards, destroyed them that believe not or destroyed them that would not overcome, that did not overcome. Overcoming is crucial. &gt;&gt; So what do we have to overcome? We must overcome the world that we were born into. &gt;&gt; Now, this consists of a lot. So, we're going to try to, you know, when I thought about this message, this could be just a tremendous message for an evangelist to come in here and just really pump us up and, you know, really get us, you know, flowing good when we want to walk out the door. But I don't know how long that lasts. You know what I'm saying? So, it's important that we just really take serious that our life every day we have to be committed to overcoming &gt;&gt; what is the world it's the very satanic nature that we're born with &gt;&gt; that we're born into and that we're that's all around us. So the world is everywhere. It's in us. It's the people we talk to. It's all around us. It's everywhere. &gt;&gt; It's pride. It's self-will. is I'm going to do what I want to do. That's the world. And it's not only in us, but it's everywhere and it's in everything. &gt;&gt; So, you talk about something major that we have to overcome. 1 John chapter 2:15 says, "Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. doesn't mean you can't watch a game. Doesn't mean you can't enjoy watching a game. But what it does mean is you don't love the satanic nature of that game. &gt;&gt; Understand the difference. The word, the word world in the Greek is cosmos. And you've probably heard this before meaning the order or the arrangement of the world system. that we're going to try to go back here at the beginning when this all started. The order or the arrangement of the world system, what Satan became in heaven, he has ordered and arranged down here on earth. And what is that order exactly? It is satanic principles. It's selfishness, self-will, greed, and force. This is the world. So, it's not something you would look out there and say, you know, I I'm I'm never going to go to a carnival because that's of the world. No, it's satanic principles that could be right inside of a church, &gt;&gt; right inside of our home, &gt;&gt; right inside of where we work, who we talk to, our friends, what we're texting. Satanic principle, selfishness, thinking of one's own gain, profit or pleasure. &gt;&gt; Self-will. I will exalt my will above God's will for my life. Greed. I will exalt my throne above the throne of God. Force. I will manipulate, ally, deceive, use all manner of force to get my will. These are satanic principles that he had in heaven where he got a third of the angels came down and everything was fine in the garden of Eden until Eve fell. And when she fell, her nature be her nature fell and all that she had also fell and it began to get mixed with Satan's nature. Satan's principles are all I I I I I. And when we really re real realize that, we'll see how close we are to the world. Just watch just watch your your nature and your motives. You'll see Satan's world order has become the very nature that we were born with. We were told so many times we were born in sin, shape, and iniquity. What does that mean? We were born with the very nature of myself. I but anything that God ever birthed, he birthed them to do God's will. &gt;&gt; Not you have a choice to do whatever you want to do. Yes, he gave that privilege to even the angels, right? &gt;&gt; That's why a third could leave. And think about this, the angels are just not um they have a will. It isn't like they're robots and it's impossible for them. God entrusts his angels. A and and God can't trust everybody, but he can trust his bride. &gt;&gt; The very nature we were born with was selfishness, self-willed, selfish, greedy, manipulative, forceful. You know, you you a child does not have to go very far before it realizes it's not as cute as we thought it was, right? And we we know that we're dealing with something that we would never teach that child. Where did that child get it from? Who taught that child that? &gt;&gt; Nobody taught it. Was born with that. &gt;&gt; It was born with that worldly nature. That's why we must be born again. Satan has arranged the world to be your will be done, not God's. That's the world that we live in. It's the mark of the beast. It's 666. The Revelation 13 tells us it's the mark of a it's the number of a man. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham taught us that vicarious filid means instead of Christ. This is Satan's world. It's instead of God. God's principles are his will, his word, and his way. That's real simple. You got Satan's principles and God's principles. Good to see you, Sister Vetman this morning. God's principles are his will, his word, and his way, which is just take a look at a few of these things, which Jesus himself taught us to love one another the way he loved us. Just talking about the principles of God to esteem others better than yourself to not look every man on his own things but the things of others to not make yourself of a reputation about I I I but think about somebody else's reputation &gt;&gt; to humble yourself to the will of God said that eternal life was living for others &gt;&gt; so we see the principles of God is to live for others where the principles of Satan is all about yourself. HOW CAN I GET AHEAD? What can I do? It's all about me. Let's use the church. Let's use one another. Let's use who we got to use to get what we want &gt;&gt; in the name of religion. This world is not just in us, but it's in everyone. This nature and it's in everything and it's everywhere. And Jesus gave us the remedy to overcome that. He just said, "Deny yourself daily. Deny yourself your will daily. Pick up your cross and follow me." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Love not the world, neither the things that are in the world. St. John 2:15. If any man love the world, the love of the father is not in him. So to basically to love your will to love your will is not to have the love of God in you. Think about that. It it's not just like I said these outside things are out here. You got to think about the worldly nature that's in you. Look at verse 16. All that is in the world, all uh for all that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the pride of life is not of the father, but of the world. Now notice what the identification is of the world. He's identifying not the football games. He's identifying what's inside of man. And you can see how our promised land today is filled with giants. &gt;&gt; And in other words, this temple belongs to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we but but when it was found, we realized that we were really bad and we need to overcome those things &gt;&gt; and and get a new nature change. Verse 17. And the world passeth away, and the lust thereof, here it is. But he that doeth the will of God abideth forever. &gt;&gt; Everything must come down to doing God's will. &gt;&gt; Everything. Now, at one time, Adam was in the image of God. He was doing the will of God just like this scripture. And had complete dominion over the earth. And when Ardom Ardom Adam partook, that's me saying two words at one time. And when Adam partook of the tree of good and evil, he lost all that he had. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Adam's nature at that point became mixed with Satan's. I know this is maybe a little hard to grab here, but God said, "Because thou has eaten of the tree which I commanded thee, saying, Thou shalt not eat of it, cursed is the ground for thy sake, in sorrow thou shalt eat of it all the days of thy life. Thorns and thistles shall bring forth to thee, and thou shalt eat of the herb of the field. In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread till thou return unto the ground. For out of it was thou taken for dust thou art. Dust thou shalt return. And he said unto the woman about the woman's nature, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and in sorrow thou shalt bring forth children. So here their whole nature was evolving from the image of God now to the image of a lower image, a li image of a beast or the the image of of Satan if I could say it like this because it was like you want your will fine you're going to then reap what your will is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; So Adam and Le Eve lost dominion of their nature. It was now mixed with a curse. And same with all that was underneath Adam, referring to the world that he lived in. The he he no longer could say, you know, to this tree, I want you over here and to the animals. Everything began to change. Uh the animals were no longer just sweet and nice to one another. Everything changed. Now what happened is Satan began to use his influence, his ability and his anointing. He started to use his deception. He was able to use his cleverness and his wisdom to make civilizations and science. And finally, the wisdom of Satan became the wisdom that man began to use on earth. And Satan's nature began to work through man and slowly evolving. And if you notice, the world had to be destroyed &gt;&gt; by water because it became so evil. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's going to get destroyed again because it's so evil, by fire. &gt;&gt; So, you know what Satan has to offer? It sounds good for self, right? This is how I can get ahead. If I do this, I'll get ahead. So, that sounds good for the moment, but the problem is it's not good for anybody else and it's not good long term. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; The only way eternity will ever be is living for others. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's it. It's the only way it works. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in John 8:23, he said, "You are from beneath. I am from above. You are of this world. I am not of this world. &gt;&gt; Making it real clear that there's a distinction there. So your nature is from Satan. My nature is not. Amen. &gt;&gt; In Matthew chapter 4:8, here's part of just a little part of where Satan uh the devil was tempting Jesus. I just want to read one part of it in verse eight said the again the devil taketh him up to an exceeding high mountain and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them. Basically Satan it was Satan's he won it right? So he offered it to him. But Satan, if you notice, Satan got the world unlawfully. And this was an opportunity for Satan to really exalt his kingdom above the throne of God right here. This this this was it right here. This was the bait. And he said unto him, "All these things will I give you if you just fall down and worship me. If you just just lower your standard just a little bit." Amen. &gt;&gt; Just come down off of that that high standard and just compromise just a little bit and I'll give you all this. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus saith unto him, "Get thee, hence Satan, for it is written, thou shalt worship the Lord thy God, and him alone shalt thou serve." See, Jesus knew he was going to get the world. He's gonna get everything backl &gt;&gt; by giving himself right at Calvary. God is not of this world and he has called his elect children out of the world. &gt;&gt; So he's called us out. He's called us to separate. How do we separate from a a worldly spirit and nature and everything that's around us? 2 Corinthians chapter 6 verse1 17. Wherefore come out, he said, from among them, and be ye separate, sayaeth the Lord, and touch not the unclean thing, and I will receive you, and will be a father unto you, and you shall be my sons and daughters, sayaeth the Lord Almighty. So, whatever is of a worldly nature, you got to separate from it. Let's say that Bob here because there's no Bob's here or Ted's. Say Bob and Ted are complainers. &gt;&gt; Bob and Ted have to learn to separate from complaining. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come out of that. Be separate. And I you're going to be my sons and daughters. See, here's what Satan wants to say. You do whatever you want. You're still a son and daughter. Right? &gt;&gt; Well, that only lasts so long. I mean, we got we got the children of Israel as an example of that. So, at some point, God says, "Show me if you got character. I want to see you overcoming." I'm going to tell you, the greatest thing that should be on our mind all the time is becoming more into the image of Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, I don't know what it is, but Satan just wants us to get up and, you know, you go to church and and and just try to just go with the flow, and nothing matters. Like, something's just magically going to happen. we're going to make a rapture without coming into the image of God. It just I I can't believe that Satan has deceived so many people. &gt;&gt; I mean, we've got to be committed to OVERCOMING BECAUSE IF WE DON'T OVERCOME, WE DON'T GET CHARACTER. WE DON'T GET CHARACTER. WE'RE NOT GOING IN. &gt;&gt; It's that simple. &gt;&gt; So, it doesn't matter if you can fool everybody. that the thing the thing is in our heart we just need to realize that God is calling us personally. Not everybody wants to pay the price. Everybody's not committed. That means everybody's not going to make it. Right? Many will come to me in that day, Lord, what happened? Why? I thought I did this and I did that. But they weren't committed. Revelations 21:7, our opening scripture, he that overcomemeth shall inherit all things, and I will be his God, and he shall be my son. See, it it's not just separating, but we got to separate to the point that we're overcoming. &gt;&gt; They got to put these scriptures together. God has called us to come out, to separate, and to overcome. &gt;&gt; Not just join a church, but overcome what? The satanic worldly nature. that's all around us. &gt;&gt; You ever talk to somebody and you know they're not being real with you? They're trying to pull a a funny one, a fast one, trying to give, you know, a little half truth. You know what I'm talking about? Sometimes it's easy to identify in other people this nature. &gt;&gt; But can we identify in oursel? &gt;&gt; Because I'm telling you, I don't care how good you are. &gt;&gt; You still have to die daily. &gt;&gt; I don't care. You just got to because how do I know that? Because Jesus said that. That's the only way I know. That's right. &gt;&gt; We must be completely born of his nature, a a a completely new creature in Christ Jesus where the old has passed away, the new has has become and all things are of God in our life. And we begin to think like, I care about what God wants me to do today. &gt;&gt; You know, a lot of times we this is the way we look at God. This is the way we look at God. Good morning, God. Good morning, son. Good morning, daughter. God bless you and have a wonderful day today. Whatever you do, have a good day today. That's the way we look at God. Like, it doesn't matter what we do that day because our God is such a good God. He just whatever you want to do. And we begin to to forget that God has a will for our life. &gt;&gt; Amen. that we've got to take time to say, Lord, what would you have me to do today? &gt;&gt; Not my will, but thy will be done. &gt;&gt; God has called his elect children out of the world. Everybody's not going to come out. Most are going to be the majority are going to be compromisers. &gt;&gt; And did you know, Ann, that a compromiser is a complainer? &gt;&gt; Think about that. That's right. An overcomer doesn't complain. And brother Marty, I know you you watch sports. Those of you that watch sports, you ever watch somebody in sports and somebody did them wrong. They did them wrong, but they don't retaliate back. &gt;&gt; You look at them and you go, "Wow, that that that's that took character." Because somebody would did that to me, I would have let them know right quick, &gt;&gt; you were wrong. &gt;&gt; And of course, you see somebody that that does retaliate and they get mad and they're throwing their helmet down and you think, "Come on. &gt;&gt; Come on. Is that worth it? What are you going to do? Do you think the rest going to come back and say, "Oh, I'm sorry." &gt;&gt; So, it it takes character to not complain. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To to just simply say it must please the Lord to bruise them. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; It It's not about always proving what's fair and what's right. &gt;&gt; It's about being able to go through things and suffer knowing that you're in the will of God. Jesus said in John 15:18, "If the world hate you, you know that it hated me before it hated you." &gt;&gt; And if you were of the world, the world will love his own. But because you're not of the world, but I have chosen you out of the world, therefore the world hate you. You know that is so comforting when you realize when you take a stand when you take a stand for the word &gt;&gt; and you are not like for it. It's okay. It's a privilege. &gt;&gt; It's an honor. &gt;&gt; But to go and not take a stand for the word, you become ashamed &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; John 17:14, I have given them thy word and the world hates them. because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world. I pray not that thou shouldest take them out of the world the planet right but thou shouldest keepeth them from the evil the evil nature. &gt;&gt; So God wants us to be here and not be part of the world. &gt;&gt; They are not of the world even as I am not of the world. Sanctify them through thy truth. Thy word is truth. The word of God is what takes out the worldly nature. It sanctifies us. &gt;&gt; We come to church, we hear the word, and our heart says, "Amen. So be it to me in my life, Lord. I want to be like you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sanctify the worldly nature out of them by walking in the truth or the light of the word. &gt;&gt; You shall know the truth and what? &gt;&gt; Truth shall make you free. That's right. John 16:12 says, "I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now." In other words, the satanic nature that you're dealing with is a whole lot more than you can deal with. &gt;&gt; You're going to need the comfort of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You need the Holy Ghost to help you with this situation. You can take your mind off and say, "No, I don't need to deal with it." But you know, it's going to keep popping up. &gt;&gt; How be it when he, the Spirit of truth, has come, he will guide you into all truth. &gt;&gt; We must overcome our worldly nature. And I don't if I could say it like this. Everybody's worldly nature is exactly the same in here. &gt;&gt; It's got the capability of of being bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And but we all have the same responsibility to keep it crucified. &gt;&gt; Amen. He that overcomemeth that worldly nature shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son. We'll be to sit with him on the throne. What a promise to the bride. I say to the bride, I say to the overcomer, we shall inherit all things. We shall sit with Christ on the throne. That is a promise to the bride. It isn't to everybody else. It's to the overcomer. He that have ears to hear, let him hear what the spirit is saying unto the church. &gt;&gt; The devil, did you know the devil is committed to keeping you from getting God's complete nature? &gt;&gt; He wants you to be satisfied with what you have. &gt;&gt; I'm sure we're all familiar with that spirit. He wants you so entangled with the cares of this life that you get discouraged or too busy or too distracted with pleasures or earthly plans. He wants you laying up treasures here on earth. He wants you so caught up in your life that your will is all that really matters to you. He wants to flood your life with unsolvable problems. &gt;&gt; You just on a squirrel cage going around with them. He wants to find anything good to do that doesn't involve the nature change. In other words, he wants you to do good things as long as it's not dealing with you changing your nature. &gt;&gt; Because what good does it do doing good things all your life? But your your your nature never gets changed. You never overcome anything. And this is the how messed up the world is thinking I'm a good person. I'm doing good things. Like like how is that going to make you an overcomer? So the devil wants you to do good things. He does. As long as you're not dying out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As long as you're not suffering. As long as you're not sacrificing, it's not long as you're not presenting your body living sacrifice. If you just, you know, want to do something good to maybe, you know, have somebody look at you a little bit nicer, you know, he he's he's got a whole the devil is committed to keeping you from overcoming. &gt;&gt; He's committed. The devil wants you so bothered about someone gossiping about them or maybe holding grudges against them that you don't want to forgive them. It's a trick of Satan. See, the the devil knows if we don't forgive others and God's not going to forgive us. &gt;&gt; Satan knows it. So, if I can just get you so involved with a a little bit of a problem with somebody, well, then you know what? You're not going to overcome. He's got so many tr you know, you open a tackle box up and there's so many lures in there. &gt;&gt; The devil wants you to love your friends only. &gt;&gt; Don't love your enemies. Don't pray from your heart for those that despitefully use you and persecute you. Don't lay aside everything and go get perfect love. You can wait till later. The devil doesn't want you to seek the kingdom of God first. Devil doesn't want you to pay your tithes first. &gt;&gt; I mean, the devil is committed. &gt;&gt; You know, we're fighting an evil evil spirit. Ephesians 6:12 says, "For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places." That's what we're fighting against. But the devil don't want you to know that. Romans 12:20 says, "Therefore, if thine enemy hunger, feed him. If he thirst, give him drink. For in doing so, thou shalt heap coals of fire upon his head." Now, if I could just say this, I don't want that to be your motive. &gt;&gt; Look at verse 21. Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good. Well, how do you do that? &gt;&gt; Do good to your enemy. That's how you overcome evil with good. &gt;&gt; You don't set them straight &gt;&gt; all the time. Sometimes it's the goodness of God that brings man to repentance. &gt;&gt; So, we overcome evil with goodness. The word overcome means to subdue, to conquer, to prevail, and to get the victory. So we have to subdue and conquer and prevail this evil nature that we're born with that we wake up every day with &gt;&gt; that every chance we can, we want it to be served. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? It's &gt;&gt; awful quiet in here. Somebody needs to get excited about the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Look at this. In Matthew 11:12, Jesus speaking. He says, ' And from the days of John the Baptist until now, the kingdom of God suffereth violent, and the violent taketh by forth. There's a battle. Now, it's not a physical force because we're fighting against not flesh and blood. We're fighting against spirits. &gt;&gt; Satan is out to stop you. And we have to conquer and get the victory over the devil with faith in doing the good thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have to have faith because a lot of times when somebody's being mean to you and and you're going to be thinking, well, if I'm going to be nice, they're just going to, you know, use me. If I'm going to uh do good to them, they're just going to take advantage of me. &gt;&gt; Or they don't deserve it because they did that to me. They need to apologize. I mean, you got so many things going on in your mind. &gt;&gt; So, that's why you have to be committed to overcoming. &gt;&gt; Committed. You can't just, well, if it works out, you know, there's no snow. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO BE COMMITTED. YOU'RE FIGHTING DEMONS THAT DON'T WANT YOU TO GET A NATURE CHANGE. Luke 16:16, the law and the prophets were until John. Since that time, the kingdom of God is preached, and every man press into it. &gt;&gt; God is not just going to lay out his character. You got to press into God's character. If the devil's committed to keeping you from the complete nature change, then we need to be committed to overcoming the devil. &gt;&gt; You know, part of a carnal believer is him thinking that he's not even in a battle. &gt;&gt; A carnal mindset. Well, I I don't have any problems with any anybody. Then I everything must be good. Well, I'm telling you, we're in a battle all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You got if if you don't see I I remember brother Henkins saying one time, he says, "If you didn't come uh you didn't come against the devil somewhere, cross the devil in your path in somewhere in the course of your day, you need to back up because more than likely you're going in the same direction he went is going in." Like that devil is out to stop you from getting interested in getting in a nature change. He wants you involved and interested in everything else. And the only time you ever hear about a nature change is when you come to church. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; And why are we getting anywhere? Why are we growing spiritually, right? BECAUSE WE'RE NOT TAKING GOD SERIOUSLY. &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians 2:11. Less Satan should get in advantage of us, for we are not ignorant of his devices. See, Satan knows what he's doing. He's trying to get advantage. If the weakest if the devil trembles at the weakest Christian on his knees because he's he's calling out to God, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; If he if if Satan can keep somebody from getting on their knees, He's got the advantage &gt;&gt; because Satan can whip any one of us. &gt;&gt; Any one of us. But he can't whip God. &gt;&gt; He can't whip God in us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we got to be yielded to God. We got to be doing God's will. We got to be letting God have his way. &gt;&gt; Preeminent. &gt;&gt; All that he was all that was in God, he poured into Christ. All that was in Christ, he poured into the church. And God's desire is for him to have preeminence in the church. &gt;&gt; But that's us not just saying, "Yeah, I believe in the message. I believe in that scripture. I believe in God." BUT IT'S US LEAVING GOD BE PREEMINENT IN my life. &gt;&gt; Because we are the church of God, right? &gt;&gt; Not just here at church, &gt;&gt; but in our everyday. So in order to be committed to overcoming, we must have a committed attitude. &gt;&gt; Jesus said we must press in, take it by force. We must be violent because the devil is standing in our way. He's blocking. I remember in the world, and I' I've mentioned this before. I remember in the world before I was even a Christian, I was listening to that stairway to heaven. Satan's there blocking the way, keeping the Christian from from from getting to heaven. I mean, you talk about inspiration in the satanic world, but we must be p purposeful, persistent, determined, and committed to fighting against the devil. We must persevere through challenges, showing steady dedication. I'm I'm I'm dedicated. &gt;&gt; Not just wait till somebody's ask, not to wait till Sunday, but just you make a decision. I want to I want to go home and I want my home to be different. &gt;&gt; And and and and no excuses. &gt;&gt; No excuses. &gt;&gt; Excuses means you're not committed. &gt;&gt; We need a committed attitude. We need to be strong, courageous. Second Timothy chapter 2, Paul is is talking to Timothy. And he says there thou therefore my son be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus and the things that thou has heard of me among many witnesses the same commit thou to faithful men who shall be able to teach others also. Now notice, if you're not going to teach somebody who's faithful, they're never going to be able to teach others who are fa to be faithful. &gt;&gt; It's like you have to learn to be committed. You have to learn to be faithful first. &gt;&gt; And then you're a candidate to to to teach others how to be faithful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thou therefore endure hardness as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. Well, we're in a soldier. We're we're we're soldiers. We're in a battle and we got to endure hard times. We can't just make them an excuse or or or or a reason why we're going to set our armor down and and not press in. Amen. &gt;&gt; No man that warth that's in the battle entangleth himself with the affairs of this life that he may please him who have c chosen him to be a soldier. I love that. And if any and if a man also strive for the masteries yet he's not crowned except he strive lawfully. In other words, God's saying, "Be faithful. &gt;&gt; Do it the right way. &gt;&gt; Don't don't don't fake your way in. Be faithful. That's that's lawful. If we're committed to overcoming, then we need to be strong. We need to be courageous. We need to be strong in prayer. We need to stay under the blood. &gt;&gt; We need to put on the whole armor of God. And we need to maintain a positive testimony in our life. &gt;&gt; Present our bodies a living sacrifice. If we could turn to Revelations 12, and I didn't have this written down, chapter 12. I just want to start at verse 7 if we could. If you could pull that up. Revelations 12:7. I was going to start at verse 10, but I just want to show you this war that started in heaven and how it's how it involved us. And we didn't even ask to be involved. Starting with verse 7. And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon fought and his angels. So if you can just imagine all these angels fighting in heaven and prevailed not neither was their place found anymore in heaven. So basically after the fight uh Satan didn't win, the dragon didn't win, angels didn't win, and they got kicked out. &gt;&gt; So that's where we're at right here. And the great dragon was cast out, the old serpent called the devil, and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world. He was cast out um into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. So, he's he's coming down with his worldly nature now. He's wanting to deceive just like he deceived the angels, he's now wanting to deceive everybody on earth. And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of the brethren. He's cast down which accused them before our God day and night. So why do we accuse anybody? Satan does that enough. We ought to be praying for one another &gt;&gt; and they overcame him. Now notice moving ahead now. It's kind of like a what happened before the Garden of Eden. And now we're moving ahead. So this this is like in a few verses we see a lot like a like an capsule everything that transpired and they overcame the devil by the blood of the lamb by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. You talk about an ingredient that is needed to overcome the devil. &gt;&gt; Amen. You can't just use the blood &gt;&gt; because God wants you to be an overcomer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You just can't confess it with your mouth. But your life has to follow your testimony. &gt;&gt; And it does that by dying out. &gt;&gt; Love not your life. Love not your will. Love not what you want to do unto the death. Therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them. Woe to the heavens of the earth and of the sea. For the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth that he have but a short time. So you go through the course of the day and you don't think about the your enemy. &gt;&gt; He is definitely thinking about you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's definitely out to get you, but he's very tricky. &gt;&gt; I mean, you just natural wars. When you see natural wars, you want to be tricky because you want to win the war. You don't want to see that you you don't want them to see you coming. It's no different in the spiritual war. The devil doesn't want you to realize he's the one that's trying to get you distracted from getting into the image of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. He says, "What good would it do to have nothing to do with ball games, worldly music, have nothing to do with anything?" But inside of here, this worldly nature never changed or never completely changed. Let me just say that completely changed because he's coming for a bride without spot or wrinkle, is he not? &gt;&gt; If a believer isn't committed, they will never overcome. A believer must be committed no matter what. No excuses. No excuses. No excuses. And and and one more thing I WANT TO SAY. NO EXCUSES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It It's almost like here I'm going to give you this excuse. This is why I don't I can't pay tithe because, you know, I I I got all my bills I got to pay. Look, the reason I said that is because you got me mad. Excuses. Excuses. Excuses. If a believer is committed, nothing will stand in the way of a complete victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Christ, Paul said it like this, Christ in me, the hope of glory. &gt;&gt; Amen. The devil's job is to present you lacking, complacent, lukewarm. And it's the job of the five-fold ministry to present you perfect. &gt;&gt; A perfect bride. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Without spot or wrinkle. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; There's the battle. &gt;&gt; The five-fold ministry is actually there to help you, not make you feel bad. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's giving you what you need to overcome the enemy. &gt;&gt; Doesn't agree with your flesh. The five-fold ministry is not for your flesh. &gt;&gt; It's for your soul. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The devil is for your flesh. &gt;&gt; We must be committed to overcoming. The word committed means dedicated, loyal, bound to a cause, a person or an action, showing unwavering focus. In other words, we can't be wishy-washy. &gt;&gt; Can't be double-minded about overcoming. We can't be, well, I'm going to try. Sometimes, sometimes I'm not. Sometimes I'm here at church and sometimes I'm not. Sometimes I want to try and support and sometimes I don't want to. &gt;&gt; You that is not a commitment. &gt;&gt; And you're not going to overcome anything in your life. &gt;&gt; We will never overcome the devil wavering or being inconsistent or double-minded. We must learn to remain stable in our commitment. Stable. You know how much life our life would be if we just worked on being stable? &gt;&gt; James 1:8, a doubleminded man is unstable in all of his ways. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, you got a car. Your car doesn't always start. You start your car 10 times a week. Two times a week, it doesn't start. It doesn't matter where you're going. It just at that time it ain't going to start. So it's it's not reliable. A person that's not stable is not reliable. &gt;&gt; That's why God requires faithfulness. Number one, &gt;&gt; faithfulness to the word. &gt;&gt; And God sent us a message for a reason. &gt;&gt; Not so we could pick some, you know, a few quotes here and there out of it and say, "No, I tell you, there's no quotes in this message today." Of course, I think the last message there was a ton of quotes, but I'm telling you what, this message is what made this word alive to me. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour is what made this word alive. &gt;&gt; Open my eyes to see. Verse seven, for let not that man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord. An unstable man, God just says, forget it. &gt;&gt; Well, think about uh Leodysia. They're not hot. They're not cold. They're lukewarm. He says, "Look, you know what? This this is unstable. I I you do what you want to do, but if you're going to be in this condition, I'd rather have you just go serve the devil." &gt;&gt; It's exactly He because God is serious. &gt;&gt; He's not a Santa Claus. &gt;&gt; He's serious. We must be positive. We must think positive and we must talk positive. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's part of the attitude. Matthew chapter 12:36. But I say unto you that every idol word that man shall speak, &gt;&gt; they shall give an account for thereof on the day of judgment. &gt;&gt; You want to know what an idol word is? It means inactive, unemployed, lazy, useless, barren. Idle word. When a car is sitting at an intersection and the light is green and they're not going, they're sitting there idle &gt;&gt; and they're not going. Everybody around who's waiting for them knows something's wrong. &gt;&gt; True. &gt;&gt; When somebody just speaking idol words, something's wrong. &gt;&gt; We got to give an account. Verse 37. For by thy words thou shalt be justified, and by thy words thou shalt be condemned. That's scary. So if you're telling somebody you need to do this, well then you need to be doing it, too, right? Be committed to speak the word. They, the elect of God, overcame the devil by the word of their testimony. So you've got to be committed to speaking the word. We must be sure. We must be confident. Paul said, "Being confident of this very thing, he which had begun a good work in you shall perform it, he shall finish it until the day of Jesus Christ." Timothy was facing fear about being persecuted because nobody wants to be persecuted, right? You want how many wants somebody to not like them? Let me see your hands. Everybody wants to be liked, right? And sometimes we're afraid to take a stand. That's kind of where Timothy was at. In verse 8, 2 Timothy chapter 1 verse 8 says, "Be not thou fear therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord." In other words, you're going all they that live goaly are going to suffer persecution, nor of me as a prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God. In other words, whatever you go through, it's okay because you got the power of God in you. &gt;&gt; You you can you can overcome the situation. I mean, I I thank God that I'm not one of the 68 million Protestants that were burnt at the stake. &gt;&gt; I mean, we still got to overcome. And this is a harder age because we're fighting invisible demons. But we just got to be positive. &gt;&gt; Verse seven, for God hath not given us the spirit of fear, &gt;&gt; but of power and of love and of a sound mind. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when those things aren't clicking, back up, humble yourself, bow your head, say, "God, forgive me. I am not going to fear. &gt;&gt; I'm going to trust in what you have given me." If we're not committed, then we'll never overcome our obstacles. And we all got them. First John chapter 5 verse4 says, and we're we're winding down here. For whatsoever is born of God, he's the one that overcomemeth the world. And this is the victory that overcomemeth the world, even our faith. See, we have to believe. We have to believe. We can't stop trusting. Jesus said in John 16:33, "These things have I spoken unto you that that you might have peace. In the world you shall have tribulation, but be of good cheer. I have overcome the world. &gt;&gt; I have overcome the world. If God is living in you, you will overcome. And see the key here. Here's the key. This thing is almost full. This water. I mean, it's sealed, but there's a little bit of room there. I could dump everything else out and I could have this testimony. God is in my life. God is in my vessel because there'd be water in this bottle. True. Maybe only a drop or two, but it's there. But here's the thing. I'm not going to be able to overcome very much with just a drop of God. &gt;&gt; The Bible tells me to be filled with the spirit. That's right. &gt;&gt; To be filled. &gt;&gt; Now, that means I got to call. I got to seek. I got to ask. &gt;&gt; I got to keep coming to him. &gt;&gt; I got to keep I got to I I got to keep on getting filled up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And if I don't keep that going, then if Satan can just say, "Oh, you got God. You got God. You got God." And therefore, you don't press in. that that that's why Paul said, "I press towards the mark. &gt;&gt; I I have such a hunger to know God more." I'm gonna be honest with you. I go through the course of the day and this is what I see at the end of the day. I see John Martin. I wish I had more of God so I could be better. &gt;&gt; That is what I see at the end of the day. And because of that, that gives me a desire to press in. &gt;&gt; Because if I'm satisfied with where I'm at, I'm not going to press in. If I don't think there's a need to overcome my my ill nature, if I think I'm good enough to make it in that, see, I'm battling a complacency spirit, a lukewarm spirit. But God has called us to perfection. &gt;&gt; Let us go on to perfection. And I think perfection is being able to manifest Christ 24/7. &gt;&gt; Caleb said, "Let us go up at once." &gt;&gt; Amen. We're more than conquerors. We're more than able to take the land. 1 John 4:4 says, "Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them because greater is he that's in you than he that is in the world." Once you get God in you, you got something greater in you than the worldly nature you were born with. If you just think about it, think about everybody's all the testimonies of people's lives changing, being delivered, people becoming free of certain things that they were bound with. What was that? That's God in them greater than the nature that they were. And and God has a vision for us. And that vision is to be in his image. And if we reach that, we that means we'll overcome all things and we'll get to to to literally while all the servants are out there in heaven, you are going to be sitting with God on the throne. You are his wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Think about that. You are the bride of Jesus Christ. We need to be committed to overcoming. Last scripture, Colossians chapter 3, verse number 12. How many loves the word? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It ought to make us excited. &gt;&gt; The word of God ought to make us excited. &gt;&gt; Colossians 3:12, "Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, vows of mercy, kindness, humbleness of mind, meekness, longsuffering." Notice these things are not the world or satanic principles. These are God's principles. Forbearing one another and forgiving one another. If any man have a quarrel against any, even as Christ forgave you, so also do you. And above all these things, put on charity, which is the bond of perfectness. And let the peace of God rule. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take rulership in your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To the which also you're called in one body and be ye thankful. &gt;&gt; Hard to be thankful and complaining at the same time. &gt;&gt; Right? They're two different spirits. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another in the psalms and in hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your heart to the Lord. And whatsoever you do in word, whatever you confess, whatever you say, or whatever you do, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God and the Father by him. Amen. Let's stand together. Let's leave here confessing that we're committed to overcoming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I mean, really talk about it in your home. Don't just let this be a a good another good message. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Take this word and make it change your life. Be more committed. Don't stop confessing. Don't stop fighting. I believe God wants us to have a personal a personal confession. Now, everybody in your home may not have this, but you personally need to have it. I am committed to overcoming. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I personally am committed to overcoming. Let's sing. Greater is he that is in me. Amen. Oh, greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the word. I'm claim it. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is. Doesn't that sound good? I just want to sing it again. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me. Greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world. Amen. I can really see like Joshua and Caleb, they were not afraid to to take the land &gt;&gt; because they really believed it &gt;&gt; and I really believe that God in me can overcome the giant nature inside of me. &gt;&gt; Just believe it. &gt;&gt; We've got the power. We've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Though Satan rages, we shall not be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. We've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Though Satan raes, we shall not be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. We've got the power in the name of Jesus. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Those saint raes we shall not be defeated. We've got the power in the name of the Lord. Amen. Amen. Praise God. Jesus on the inside. &gt;&gt; That's where the power's at, right? Jesus on the inside working on the outside. Oh, what a change in my life. Jesus on the inside, working on the outside. Oh, what a change in my life. What a
