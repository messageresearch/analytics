there but I'd like to go there I'd like to have you know I read about the Indonesian Revival and they said that the Holy Ghost was so strong the top of the building they thought it was on fire so the

Spirit of the Living God fall fresh on me I have to say Amen to what Brother Bruce was saying especially in this late hour when it just seems it the spirit of the Lord just seems to be moving further away and Jesus gave that little Parable there that that that widow woman just kept crying out crying out and I think that's what's going to bring our God to come and avenge us amen amen and and to to meet the need that we have inside just to to be like him to be to be ready for the Rapture amen well God bless you this morning it's good to be in God's house good to be with one another and let's be in prayer continue in prayer for those that are not able to be here but their desire is amen let's turn with me if you would to the book of uh first Peter uh chapter 2 this morning God is good amen I'm so glad he left his word with us that we can really know him amen amen how many has a desire today that God would just just speak to you do something special in your heart amen let's let's just look to him in prayer Heavenly Father we come to you today Lord we all have need of you Lord you saw these hands Lord that were lifted because they're with expectation they believe Lord in prayer they believe that your presence is here and that Lord that you can do exceedingly above whatever they're asking so they're asking in Faith Lord I pray that you would speak Lord directly to each one that you would Supply the need Supply the faith for that need Lord Lord and that you might be glorified in all things father we thank you for the health and strength you've given us to be here we pray for those Lord that are sick and Afflicted we ask that your spirit would be with them today that you would give them a speedy recovery father Yes Lord Lord we just ask that you would open our eyes now only you can do that only you can reveal what you really mean in these words and we pray Lord that you would come by the spirit of your word now and give us Revelation as we commit this service and every need that we have into your hands we give you praise for it all in Jesus Christ's name amen amen First Peter chapter 2 starting with verse number one wherefore laying aside all malice and all Gile and hypocrisies and EnV envin and all evil speaking notice as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby amen if so be if tasted that the Lord is gracious to whom coming as unto a Lively Stone disallowed indeed of men but chosen of God and precious ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you you may be seated last Sunday we uh spoke on uh our guide and we want to kind of do part two and titled this message following our guide and for a subject following our guide as he builds his house in us I want to take our text from verse 5 ye also as Lively stones are built up a spiritual house um we've all seen houses that uh are built out of stone do do we have that picture let's show that picture and I I just I got this picture this morning and I cuz I was thinking about this bill up a a spiritual house and and and we're Lively stones and so we've all seen houses that are are made out of stone and you you you do not start at the top with a real Stone you start at the bottom and you build and even if it wasn't Stone House if it was just a woodh house you do not put a roof on the foundation right you you you have to put the walls up and so you you build your way up and we are a spiritual house for the Lord but we're called living or Lively stones and it it I it isn't just by coincidence that Peter was chosen to get the Revelation who Jesus was because his name meaning Stone and of course the only thing that can be a rock or or a stone is the revelation of Jesus Christ when he reveals something to us it is it's solid and we are Lively stones in other words we're living we've got a revelation of Jesus Christ of what he wants us to do and how we need to build for him to live in us right amen so following the Bible it's hard today it's getting harder to follow the Bible people have lost respect for the Bible we know that they even mocked it at the at at the at at these uh Olympics at the ceremony at the beginning uh people are just not interested in the guidance of the Bible amen amen Abraham Lincoln said our 16th president he he only had two Bibles or two two books that he read brother BR Tau us that one of them was the Bible and one of them was the uh uh Pilgrim's Progress and that was what guided and developed his whole life those two books I'm thankful for every brother and sister that's ever helped me or my family or my children uh I just appreciate good guidance and we just can't get enough of that we just can't get enough of it Martin Luther King Jr said our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power we have guided missiles and misguided men people are more interested in what they can do rather than what they should be doing you lsis S Grant he's our 18th president he said this he said hold fast to the Bible to the influence of this book we Are indebted for all the progress made in true civilization and he said and to this we must look as our guide to the Future amen our guide to the Future right we want to be guided by the Bible amen if anybody wants to know the future or their future all you got to do is look at the Bible amen and that'll tell you according to a University of Illinois study the Farmer's Alik alic is only 52% accurate at weather forecasting which is similar to a random chance but the Publishers claim that many longtime alic followers claimed that their forecasts are 80% to 85% accurate on their website we know how accurate the weather can be whatever they say that day it it may change in i' I've honestly it's not supposed to rain and it's raining on me but I say we have one book that is 100% accurate till we can know what the future is am last week we we read where Jesus said in John 14 in my father's house are many mansions if it were not so I would have told you I go to prepare a place for you this is like the beginning of the the preparation cuz he's on Earth he said I'm leaving and what I'm going to do is I'm going to go prepare a place for you and if I go to prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you to myself that where I am there you may be also right in God's in God's house his kingdom it's it's a it's like a resident where he lives but inside that there's small dwellings and we that's us amen that's us those are our our homes inside of his home so Jesus is preparing each one of these dwellings right now as we're speaking this very moment he's preparing those places for us I want you to think about that I mean he created everything and he could just he could create um um flies and frogs he can create anything just instantly why can't he just create our our home for us over there amen because it's going through free agency amen you have to be the one that's working with him we are workers together with Christ this building is transpiring together because he's not going to have robots amen and by the time this house gets all done this dwelling gets all done we find out in Revelations 21 if you want to turn there Revelations 21:1 this is when our dwelling is all prepared it's all done right starts to verse one and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and Earth were were passed away and there was no more SE and I John saw the holy city the New Jerusalem and it was coming down from God out of heaven right amen prepared as a bride a Dorn for her husband now this word prepared is the same word that Jesus used I go to prepare a place it's the exact same word and I heard a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with men that's right and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God remember Jesus said in that day you'll know that I'm in the father you and me and I and you and God shall wipe away all the tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death nor sorrow or crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new amen I I I when I look at this statement it's not separate from I'm looking at it is that he makes me new amen because he can't dwell in the old worldly nature and he said right for these words are true and they're faithful and he said it is done I am the Alpha and Omega the beginning the end I will give unto him that is a thirst of the Fountain of the Water of Life freely so who does he give it to Amen to those who are thirsty he's not given it to anybody that just says well I'm a Child of God no it don't work like that you have to get in a condition to thirst right blessed are they that hunger and thirst for they shall be filled I've never seen anybody too hungry too thirsty for the Lord God is good he that overcometh shall inherit all things and I will be his God and he shall be my son prise isn't that beautiful Jesus goes he he goes to prepare a a residence an abodes homes for us and and it they all sit in his gated if I could say it like that his gated residence and there's a a new Heaven A New Earth and this very Tabernacle is US amen it's us amen and this is why it's really really important to to get actively involved in getting prepared for God to live in US amen you know there is such a a a demonic um a demonic Doctrine you know once you get baptized you're saved and you don't have to do anything anymore right and that you you might be able to find one or two scriptures three four five you know believe on the Lord confess with your mouth and you're saved okay but it don't dovetail with the rest of the Bible so that's why I say that that understanding isn't correct so God wants us to move with him in this preparation amen so God's given us a responsibility with a promise and that's what we must overcome we must prevail conquer we must subdue and what is that we must Prevail over our nature that wants everything for ourself to we everything becomes for God yes brother Bram said that man is always looking at the past about what he's accomplished or what has happened in his life or he's looking to the future of what's going to happen and he misses what God is trying to do at that very moment and God is in renovating he's trying to renovate us amen he's working on us amen and this uh this really puts the fear of God in Me because I believe there's one thing that we should be focused on above everything one thing laser focused and that is God preparing us for eternity am instead of this thing well I'm going to heaven what is there to prepare for you understand it's we're Lively Stones amen we're not something that's in the past it's it we're alive amen the shedding of blood alone doesn't prepare us the blood alone does not make us Overcomers it's not a onesided relationship it's two-sided the life of that blood has to come upon the believer and that believer has to start keeping the word we are the one that have to subdue that ugly nature inside of us that just says no I don't want to serve God no I don't want to pray no I don't want to listen to No I don't want to make sacrifices no I don't that thing needs to be overcomed amen because that is not a home prepared for God am that's why I say it's not a one-sided relationship it's what God did for me no the effect of what God did for you has to come inside of you and begin to mold you Revelations 12 111 says and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by the word of their testimony and they love not their lives unto death see you just can't take the blood you can you can take the blood and love your life right I claim the blood go do whatever you want to do that's you're not going to overcome with that this is a three-part ingredient that you got to have amen and we need all three to get prepared he that overcometh shall inherit all things what are all things wow it's got to be good right if God's we're going to hear it all things that's so exciting to me amen I mean I I can't wait but let's just tap in just a little bit of of what I I feel the Lord has showed us here in 1 Corinthians chapter 2:9 1 Corinthians chapter 2:9 says but as it is written I Has Not Seen Nor Ear heard neither have it entered into the heart of man the things which God have there it is again prepared for them that love him right notice which God has prepared for them that love him now obviously if you know it isn't about go uh God loving us because God proved his love for God so loved the world that he gave you know he proved his love to everybody so but not everybody loves God so he's not preparing this for the world right he's preparing this for those who love him now how do I know if I love him I feel it no Jesus said if if I do love him I got to keep the Commandment that's the only way I can know amen It's A Love Affair amen we just can't go to the library watch some documentary and see what God has prepared for us it just hasn't entered into I'll say it like this the natural part of man to see what God has but I love verse 10 but God have revealed them unto us by his spirit for the spirit searcheth all things y even the Deep things of God Amen God has revealed them to us as we're getting prepared amen I hope you can catch this when God by his holy spirit speaks to you and says this is what we're working on in the renovation this is what we're working on as we're redoing your house as we're preparing this is what we're going to work on first this is what we're going to do today this is how how we're going to move this out and move this in yes because you know what when God speaks to you his will that's all you're going to find in heaven amen you're going to find his will in fact he didn't like Satan doing his will so he got kicked out see it hasn't entered into natural man the things that God has prepared the Bible says that man cannot cannot even understand those things right they're spiritually discerned so God by his Holy Spirit unveils what this really means Amen to our personal heart and it means so much to us that he would even speak to us that we take that word and we say yes Lord I want to dress myself with that I want to become more like you I want to get ready for you to dwell in me for eternity and so as he reveals by his Spirit we're actually getting prepared that's the preparation process amen he reveals to us what he wants us to do what virtue he wants us to work on what characteristic of Christ we need to be what fruit we need to be bearing what part of the character and nature of God that he wants us to be yes I mean we've all we've all renovated some room before right or or watched it uh if we haven't done it we've we've kind of watched it uh on Bob's build this house or This Old House or something like that you can see uh YouTube videos and you you certainly aren't going to be painting the room if you got to redo the plumbing and move the electric right so there's certain things that God wants you to work on Amen first now we don't know what they are but God does Amen so Paul is telling the Philippian Church wherefore my beloved we're going to go back to the the scriptures every but I just want to read this as ye have always obeyed not in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling in other words this is a reality of what's Happening amen you know there's people that go in and out of the church and they're just clueless of what's Happening they don't see God they don't hear God's voice they just for some reason they go to church and they somehow get something uh from just doing that but but God is really working we are the Church of God inside us God is working and he says for it is God which worketh in you both to Will and to do of what his good pleasure it is his pleasure that's working on my character amen it's it's it's preparing me for him to live in me for eternity I have not seen is not heard neither is it entered into the heart of the man which uh the things which God have prepared for them that love him but God have revealed them unto us by his Spirit oh this is so beautiful we're seeing God in the spiritual realm amen the natural man thinks like this well when I get to heaven I think I'm going to be floating on the cloud and going by Brother Neville and saying Hey Brother Neville remember brother Ram talking about that that's how the natural man thinks Heaven is but then when he went on to the other side he said it'll be nothing but perfect love amen big difference between naturally seeing or what what heaven's going to be to spiritually knowing what have nothing but perfect love can enter in there I just love that 1 John 4:16 says and we have known and believe that the love of God uh uh the love that God have to us God is love and he that dwelleth in Love Actually dwells in God and God in him I believe this is what God is showing those that love him so when God speaks to our heart this is what I want you to do love them just do it sir God is beginning to reveal to us what eternity is going to be all about you know we can look come to church and hear these things like dos and don'ts and laws and things like that but I'll tell you what God promised that he'd put the laws in my heart amen It's A Love Affair and if we if we want to to be a tabernacle for God we got to start the renovation process we're in control can you imagine going up to the job where you're supposed to be working and saying no I ain't going to work tear that wall upm not going to do it I'm just here to get paid I'm just here to get blessed I'm just here to receive the blessings of God look the down here we could receive all kinds of blessings but this message is about how to get ready how to how to follow the guide and get ready for eternity so he says do all things without murmuring and disputing do you ever be working with somebody and they just murmured uhuh they maybe wouldn't do it in front of the bosss but they just you know you know what I'm talking about right we don't want to murmur with what the word is telling us to do that you may be blameless and harmless as sons of God without rebuke in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation which we are in among whom you shine as lights in the world all right back to 1 Corinthians 2:11 now for what man knoweth the things of a man say the spirit of man with is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man no man but the spirit of God we can't expect a an ant or an antalope to to know how to build a car uh build a rocket build a missile build a skyscraper it's just not even in him to even understand that neither is it inside of a man to understand how to get to heaven we need the Holy Ghost app point us we need him to show us what this word really is saying because eternity is God's it's not ours right and we can't rely on man we can't rely on our own understanding we can't lean to our own understanding we got to trust God we got to trust his word yes now we have received not the spirit of the world but the spirit which is of god that you might know the things that are freely given to us of God which things also we speak not in The Words which man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches comparing spiritual things with spiritual but the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of God for they are foolishness onto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned right we're Lively Stones amen we're built up a spiritual house amen that means everything that we really truly are is through Revelation from God it's in the spirit realm now the the world is full of churches that have people in them that are trying humanly to just put peacock feathers as it were inside on the outside of them and saying yes I'm a Christian I believe God but they refuse to humble thems and say God I want to empty out and be filled with the Holy Ghost now that's a copycat God's not going to dwell in that for eternity the inside has to be filled with him amen all right Ephesians 2:19 we we I like to say we need to hurry but I I just know by Revelation I'll never finish my notes got a bad bad track record Ephesians 2:19 says now there therefore you are no more strangers and foreigners but your fellow citizens with the Saints and of the household of God and are built upon the foundation of the Apostles and the prophets Jesus Christ himself being the Chief Cornerstone in whom all the building fitly joined together groweth unto a holy Temple in the Lord right I love that it's growing you notice it wasn't when we gave our heart to the Lord it wasn't when our sins got covered it wasn't when he took them away as far as the East is from the west but it's in that he gives us another day of life he shows us what he wants to do and we fit in the word amen we're fitly joined together and what's it for we're growing into a holy Temple that that's being that was revealed in Revelations 21 for God to live in us through eternity in whom ye also are builded together for a habitation of God through the spirit you know this is so rich am it it's it's so deep but yet it's so simple right amen we must follow our guide as he's leading us to be fitly joined together for a h for a habitation for him now he's renovating our current house he doesn't kill us and say I'm done with you I'm going to create a new body he takes your life and he says he knocks on your door and he says would you like to come to Heaven you said you know I do Lord okay this is what you need to do repent get baptized and then you start following what I tell you to do one day at a time amen do not try to live the whole word at one day don't don't put yourself up for failure but when you you truly hear something God speak in your heart just go do that you'll see how God blesses you it may have nothing to do with what you think it is but it is exactly what God wants you to do he's the only one that knows how he wants his dwelling to be remember because God is sending him down coming down with him to to to the new to the new Earth and he knows what he wants to dwell in right I can guarantee if if I never talked to brother Stan and I said brother Stan I want you to work on the church but don't ever talk to me it better be exactly the way I want it to be you know it would have never got done the way that it is it takes some sort of communication some kind of unveiling this is what I think we should do right to try to be so proud to think that I don't need to come to church I don't need to listen to word I don't need to read I don't need to listen to taste I can make it on my own how can you ever be prepared for God with a spirit like that we need to work out our Salvation what Fe we need to mean business when we come to church because it's a real thing and I'll just say it like this we don't want to miss our time of visitation amen we need to pay attention to the word God gives us in instructions of how we need to renovate it what we what he wants to see in this area of our life we've all remodeled renovated you don't throw away everything he didn't throw your soul away he's just converting it he's taking something old and making all things new amen renovate means to restore to a good State he's renovating and this is how we follow our guide to a good State Romans 12:1 tells us Romans 12 vers1 I beseech you therefore if you like if you're serious and you I really mean business with God okay here it is I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that that you present yourself present your body a Living Sacrifice amen Lord here I am let's go to work what do you want me to do holy and acceptable unto God which is what your reasonable service it is the least thing you don't make me chase you around don't make me bring so many things into your life make it chaotic because I can't get you to that's what the prophet said he couldn't get the bride to sit still long enough to get her dressed to get her ready for the wedding the reasonable or rational thing for us to do is to follow our guide as he speaks to us so get alone enough to mean business God don't sit around waiting for God to bless you take a take a moment and say God I'm here because I really want to build my relationship ship with you I want to get ready for you to live in me and I know I'm not ready yet I just want to take this time I I don't got a lot of money I don't even have a lot of time but you know what I got my heart and I'm giving it to you Lord am verse two and be not conformed to this world so how does this transformation happen but ye are transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God come subject to the word right so you're you're hearing the gospel you come to church you hear the gospel preached it is no longer brother John it is no longer Brother Bruce it's not it is God speaking you know what I feel uh I I feel like I need to say that again for some reason I don't know why but I I I believe it with all my heart amen you know did you know God can use us and we don't even know how many's ever had that happen some me said something you said to me oh it just blessed me I knew it came right from God said what I didn't even know it right amen look God knows what he's doing amen we we just we got to renew our mind to the way God thinks yes we get away from God we get away from the word we get away from his presence and we get doing our own thing over here and before you know it we're just thinking without God I mean we may think about God but we're thinking about God on our terms and now we come and we subject oursel to the word brother we come to church to find out where we're at with God then we hear what what God speaks and then we say yes Lord amen right and if you truly truly want this it happens amen your life changes from Glory unto Glory it's that real we are changed so we need to give God Liberty in our Temple give him Liberty if Calvary purchased our Salvation then it also purchased our life can you say Amen to that amen I I I mean our life here so you're not your own you're bought with the price therefore glorify glorify God in your body your spirit which are Gods so give God Liberty Second Corinthians 3:17 I just love this scripture now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty right you say God's in your heart you say you're filled with the Holy Ghost you say you're walking in the spirit you say God's with you but God can't even have Liberty to follow his word in your life come on right amen where the spirit of the Lord is there's liberty so if God's there let him have his way in your life am and if you if you feel that well he's he's he's he's kind of there but not as much as I want well that's fine I'm I'm with you there but the thing that we need to do is start Ying right start Ying to the Lord I I want more of you Lord I I want to come to church I want to be in the spirit before I get there amen because I know if I am I'll get a lot more cuz remember he's revealing through the spirit the natural man can't figure out what the preacher is saying he he's just going to get critical at the preaching the natural man but the spiritual man is going to catch it but we all with open face in a glass beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord we're changed into what the same image uh from glory to glory even by the spirit of God so we see that this scripture is talking about a constantly being renovated or regenerated or or remodeled to fit God's Tabernacle to live in amen it happens it's a continual change it's you know we don't come to church and you know well we're going to put on we're going to put on Jesus today we're going to church we're going to put on our our Sunday clothes and then then we're going to go home and we're just kind of got to do whatever we want to do that is not the Tabernacle that God is preparing for heaven amen we do need to come serious with God because God is a serious person he's not all jokey amen I I I I I understand that God has asence in human I understand that but if you read the scriptures you see way too much seriousness than you ever do about God being joky you understand what I mean it's a fearful thing to fall in the hands of a living God it's not what God you know let's just talk sit down and play play you know play a game of cards it's just not like that all right Psalm 328 says I will instruct thee and I will teach thee in the way which Thou shalt go I will guide thee with mine eye yes we have a promise that God is going to take us through God is looking to fitly frame his character together in our lives so we need to pay attention to the details of God's word we've heard this story I think I first heard this story uh brother Johnson I think sharing this story oh those were the good old days and I never had to preach I never had to think about it I could sit where you're sitting and i' just brother johnon would be preaching and I'd eat the word and I'd go home and then I'd have my life you know and that was it it's much different when you got to preach but anyway anyways but brother Johnson he would he tell the story he said um there were these U men and they were applying for a job and I may get this a little mixed up but um this was like in a a city like a New York City and there were skyscrapers there and so they were they they they answered an ad in the paper and they were looking for a Salesman and so they they go in there and they they go in up the elevator they go to this room and and the the they walk into the room for the the interview and um they're sitting down taking the interview and after just a few questions he says okay this is what I want you to do I want you to take this a pile of bricks right here and I just I want you to take him and I want you to move them over here to the side of the room okay and uh he said this is kind of crazy for a Salesman job but I need I yeah I got to do it so he goes and he takes the break and he moves him over there and as he's moving him he say you know what I'm talking about like I can't have any reasoning why I should have to do this it just doesn't make sense and more and more that he's doing it he's thinking I I kind of don't want to work for this guy he finally gets all the bricks moved over here and he comes back and he reports okay I took care of that now what do you think okay well what I'd like you to do now is I'd like you to take these same bricks and i' like you to move them back right here to where they were and the guy said you know this is crazy I'm out of here and he leaves well the next guy comes in for the interview and when the bricks got over here the the first time and he asked to move him back over there he said gladly will I do that gladly and he moves the bricks back over here God is just looking for somebody that will do what he asked to do amen not to understand it not to agree with it am not to you know I'm on the same page the same page is obedience you want to know how you know you're being Guided by the Holy Ghost it's so simple if you're obedient to the word then you know you're being Guided by the Holy Ghost amen you don't need no dream you don't need no prophecy you don't need anybody to tell you right because when the word is spoken to you you say amen and you do it whether you understand it or not he never said Can thou understand he said Can thou believe right we just got to believe the word amen take the word in our heart turn with me to Matthew 19 27 you know we we don't even know what's in our heart a lot of times and and we can't even figure there's only one thing that can really tell us what's in our heart and that's the word of God it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of our heart right that's how much we got to depend upon the word we can't depend upon us because look we don't even have to go to church and I can guarantee every man man is right in his own eyes amen this that's the the nature that we're born with when you when you can honestly say you know I don't know I could be wrong you got the right Spirit now God can show you Matthew 1927 then answered Peter and said unto him behold we have forsaken everything and followed thee what is there left for us to do in other words I've forsaken the denominations I've accepted the message of the hour I I'm I'm I'm following uh I'm following you to church I I'm I'm I I said okay so what more do you want me to do that that mindset that there is nothing more for me to do and Jesus said unto them verily I say unto you that ye which have followed me in the Regeneration when the son a man shall sit in the Throne of his glory ye shall sit with sit upon the 12 tribes judging the 12 uh tribes of Israel sitting on the 12 Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel and everyone that have forsaken houses or Brethren or sisters father or mother or wife or children or lands for my name's sake shall receive a h hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life amen and many that are first shall be last and the last shall be first the subject here is forsaking everything to follow God into what a complete nature change so that's why we have to be interested in our nature because if we don't follow him into the complete nature change that means we haven't forsaken everything amen it's that simple that means there's something in our life that's holding us from getting our nature changed there are many that will put their own will first and they'll receive the nature change the the the last they'll be the last to receive it because they're the the last to to give God their life and there'll be those that lay down their life first they'll give up their will they'll put their will last that they might receive first a complete nature change God has to be first in our life if we don't the nature change is never going to come because you know the part of the ingredient to overcoming all things is you you have to hate your life un death you you just you just have to without that ingredient the nature change doesn't come ye which have followed me in the Regeneration now that word regeneration if you look at up in the Greek it means rebirth or spiritual renovation Now Catch this specifically messic restoration wow but we know God don't have to be restored but he said all that was lost I will restore we are a part of him so we are part of that restoration we have to follow him because he's guiding us to get rest restored he don't need to be restored amen we do amen but if we don't follow him in the Regeneration process if we just you know I'm born again I'm born again I mean how many people have we heard how many presidents have we heard I'm born again whether their life is just just in shambles as it was before right amen so we're we're we're not trying to prove who's who who's born again and who's not we're just trying to say a a person that's born again everything is of God that's why we need to keep pressing towards what we don't have amen maybe we're missing some things amen turn with me if you would to 2 Corinthians chapter 15 well I'll just quote it you know this wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh though you have known Christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more in other words it is impossible to know God even by the Corporal body of of of of of Jesus Christ remember Philip and Peter both said show us the father and it'll suffice us and Jesus says have I been so long with you hey when you've seen me you've seen the father right but see you can't know that until you see the spirit inside of Jesus therefore If any man you want to know somebody know their Spirit right you want to know somebody know their spirit amen you can know somebody after the Flesh and never know them but you know the spirit right that Spirit tells who they are you know we've heard brother BR could just you know stay in the presence of somebody just a little bit and just know what Spirit right because the spirit tells it all right and so we can't we if we're going to know God we have to get in the spirit God is the spirit they that worship me must worship me in the spirit to we need to get in the spirit we need to make this word real inside our hearts therefore If any man be in Christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of God who have reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ and has given us that same Ministry Amen to carry on all right second Corinthians chapter 6 I just I just love this here this we we play a part in building this Tabernacle right 2 Corinthians 61 says we then as workers together with him beseech you that you receive not the grace of God in vain what does that mean a lot of people when they get saved they say I'm saved that's it and they don't they don't have a heart of pushing in it's okay if they let other things in their life it's okay if they miss church it's okay if it because they they have that umbrella of I'm saved right well how how are we going to approach God when he says did you give your all and we say I gave what you said I repented I got baptized I went to church when I could I I gave when I could are you think we're going to like phony baloney P God we're not we're not going to do it we're not going to be to pull a fast one on him amen right so there's more to Salvation than the day we gave our heart to Christ and it's revealed here in verse two for he saith I have heard thee in accepted in in a Time accepted okay that was at the beginning right yes and in a day of salvation when I helped you when I helped you behold now is the accepted time is well behold now is the day of salvation now is the time to keep building the Tabernacle EO amen look only the bride is going in the Rapture right that the bride is adorned for the her husband it is everyone is outside if if we're not bride you're outside that City amen come on just so I'm not preaching of foolish virgins this is a message to to the bride amen I want to be bride I want to make it by the grace of God but I you understand we the bride has a different a set they have a a different thought process about the word than than the typical churchgoer same word but one loves the whole thing the other says well hey as long as I'm saved that's really the main thing that matters okay he I love you but I only love you that much it just I just I you know this is a love affair remember he's revealed what God has prepared for them to them that love him am you got that's got to be number one that love amen well there's so much I I have to skip because I don't want to be I don't want to keep you long Abraham Lincoln said I do not think much of a man who is not wiser today than yesterday even in the natural you believe in growth constantly at work I'm I'm trying to teach and emphasize and remind we've got to grow we've got to cross train we've got to develop we've got to become better why because the world's changing things are changing and and and you got to keep up I'm going to tell you the devil's got our number yes amen he knows how to discourage he knows how to get us off track he knows us how to get us distracted we got to press in all right this is the scripture second Peter chapter 1 this is the honestly the first scripture that I I I we didn't read last Sunday and I want to read it because to me this is part of the the re the re the renovation of our Tabernacles 1 Peter chapter 1:3 according as his divine power has given us all things that pertaineth unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that called us to Glory and strength whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises amen that by these ye might be partakers of the Divine of the divine nature catch this having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and besides this give all diligence add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance see we're seeing there there's a adding there's a building this this needs to transpire if we're going to become the complete Tabernacle of god let's say you had let's say you had uh 500 $500,000 and you were going to buy a house and you saw the pictures there in another state you couldn't get there but you know somebody they you just had confidence in them you saw pictures in this thing just you know had gated yard it had uh 300 acres it it had you know three four bathrooms whatever you want okay has this beautiful place and and so you got the pictures of the outside but you didn't have any pictures of the inside so you you you you pay this money or or let's say you just go out there and you got the money you're going to pay but when you walk inside it's not even finished the Plumbing's not there the Electric's not in the drywall ain't put on but the outside looks like so beautiful you're going to say wait a minute no way I'm not buying it God has the final say so who he's going to dwell in amen we've got to be so serious about getting our nature changed and begin to add these virtues to our life so that when God looks at us we're just like him we're changed from Glory onto Glory see you know we get in this habit we come to church and this is how we feel like you know when we come to church if I'm blessed I got something out of it if I feel his Spirit if I feel good when I leave I got something out of it I I I'm talking about building a house for God if you've ever built anything it ain't all easy peasy you sweat you you you get Cuts it's not easy but you work amen you you go through what you got to go through because you got a vision at the end I'm going to be prepared I'm going to be one of those residents inside God's Great residence amen so add these virtues verse seven and to Godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity that is the Capstone the Capstone we don't have a picture of the pyramid in here we got to keep adding until we get charity and for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful right in demonstrating the knowledge of Jesus Christ in your body amen they got to be in you and they got to be abounding you know what a boundy means right that means if you take a a pop and you go like this and then you open it it's abounding it's coming out amen is joy unspeakable full of Glory yes but he that lacks these virtues you know God is labeling him as being blind and cannot see a far off in fact he's forgotten what Calvary did in his own life right and I'll tell you Believers can get so caught up in their present life that they they forgot the original fact that happen to them because that needs to continually be happening come on when it's not happening you're you're dealing with the spirit of I'm in need of nothing and that's the worst Spirit of toia amen I'm in need of nothing wherefore the rather Brethren give diligence to make your calling and your election in other words you are the Bride of Jesus Christ for if you do these things you shall never fall amen amen for so look at this for so in entrance shall be ministered unto you we have a five-fold Ministry we have the prophet we have the word being ministered to us and that word is what's actually giv us entrance to God's kingdom amen wherefore I would rather I I will not be ne ne negligent to put you always in remembrance of these things though you know them I know you know them and you're already established in the present truth yeah I think at meet as long as I'm in this Tabernacle to stir you up by putting you in remembrance amen I think that's a good word for us don't you think amen amen all right second we're going to have to just go quickly on this stuff the holy spirit is wanting to direct Our Lives into all truth into all character into all the word and it's not just the knowledge of the word that don't get the job done we need the spirit of the word right that's that's what we need to follow okay Colossians 2:6 says as ye have therefore received Jesus Christ the lord now just walk in them follow the guide rooted and built up in him now notice that rooted what what what's the okay you got saved you started believing the word you got rooted you're you you you you you you you're when you're rooted you're there right there's your foundation but you don't stop there now now you're built up we're building the house for God to live in rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding there's that word abounding therein with Thanksgiving amen just you know all day long thank you Lord for doing this in my life thank you for thank you for deliverance thank you for helping me over this habit thank you for giving me Victory Amen abounding in Thanksgiving CU if you're not abounding in Thanksgiving I'm telling you you're complaining guaranteed beware lest any man spoil you through philosophy yeah that's not needed right vain deceit after the tradition of man after the rudiments of the world and not after Christ Christ wants us to abound with Thanksgiving amen for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead Bly and you are complete in him in other words God wants to fill you Soul full which is the head of all principalities and Powers okay Hebrews chapter three and you you're able to bear with me a little bit amen all right the the others amen and the the others amen Hebrews chapter 3 verse one where wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and the high high priest of our profession Jesus Christ now our our our our subject here is adding is keep adding okay who was faithful in him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all his house right for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he that had builded the house have more honor than the house right for every house is buil by some man but he that built all things is God right that we're talking about being built and Moses verily was faithful in all his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which uh were to be spoken after but Christ as a son over his house his own house whose house are we right if it's this is an important word can you imagine that two letters an i and an F could be so important this is important If We Hold Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the End Amen verse 14 for we are partakers of Christ it just kind of amens this if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end now when we came to Jesus Christ and we got saved you know you just couldn't shut up you had to tell somebody you you you couldn't wait to go back to to church to be around those that it had happened to amen because they knew what you were feeling and and you just you you you know you came to church and you got in the front row amen right you came with an expectation that you were going to receive more of what you just got but after a while you got mature I've been in this message for you understand what I'm saying and before you know it you lose that confidence our our our faith gets weakened we think well this is this is just me now we just wait we're just waiting for the Rapture just just waiting wait for what we got to we got to maintain the confidence that God is going to come amen God is going to do something in my life I'm going to come to church and God is going to do something because without faith we can't even make God happy amen I'll say why would we come to church knowing god requires faith and you're not going to bring any and I understand that we go through rough times but look we got a prayer room we we got we have an opportunity to show God we love him amen you know is this is a real thing and we need to hold our beginning conf confidence firm to them we need to keep adding to our life and becoming more like Jesus every day amen every day we have time for one more all right Joshua chapter 3:1 Joshua chapter 3:1 as you're turning there I'm just going to read two Psalms Psalms 48:14 for this God is our God forever and ever and he will he will be our guide unto the death Psalm 73:24 Thou shalt guide me with thy counsel and afterward receive me to Glory oh I love that all right Joshua 3:1 has has anybody has anybody I just want to ask a question has anybody uh gone to to heaven and and and uh become the the Tabernacle that God wants you to be yet have did did any anybody ever ever tell you how to how to become what God wants you to be yet has anybody has have you have you been this way before no that's the right answer that's what I want Joshua 3:1 and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from sham and came to Jordan and all the children of Israel en lodged there before they passed over and and it came to pass after 3 days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when ye see the Ark of the Covenant this represents the word of the Lord as you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priest the Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from that place and go after it in other words when they pick it up and they start moving you follow it right but if they don't move you stay yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 Cubit by measure and come near on uh come not near unto it that ye may know the way which you must go for ye have not passed this way there herefor Amen in other words you got to let the word guide you amen you can't say I know I know and you know you can't get ahead of the word you've got to let the word Lead You amen it don't have to you don't have to agree with it it's not going to fit into your schedule by the way I mean if you think about it God has messed up every one of our plans he's messed every one of my plans up he's given me a whole a list of things I never thought of it never even entered into my mind but you know what he revealed it by by his spirit and then then we manifest it let's Stand Together Saints we've never passed this way before we've got to come to church with a god fear trembling I just want to hear from what do you want me to work on this week and let God speak to us brother BR said in the message the rejected King he said yes they rejected it it certainly they do they don't want to come under jurisdiction of the Holy Ghost they don't want the spirit to guide them now that word jurisdiction means Authority control Dominion amen it's the official power to make a legal decision and judgments I say God wants he wants to make the decisions for your life right we have to come under subjection to that amen when when somebody is speaking to you this is what we need to do you need to be careful before you say no it could be the Holy Ghost speaking to you amen let's bow our hearts in a word of prayer if there's anyone here today that is God has spoke to you in a in a a a way about getting more serious about getting renovated in your life and you you feel provoked that you want to just raise your hands I want to pray for you all right you may put your hands down maybe there's someone today that you are serious but you want to get more serious and you just say Lord I Want to Be Remembered in Prayer by God Amen I'm going to pray with youen I believe we we are in one Accord of letting God have his way in our lives so let's let's believe as you believe the word this is God's desire for our life so as we pray in the will of God we can have confidence that God will hear and answer our prayers our heavenly father we thank you we thank you for hearing the prayers of Jesus yes he prayed for us one day and we just read that you're a high priest on the behalf of our profession our confession to you Lord we confess to you today we need you amen we can't make it without you we can't make it without you true I pray Lord that you would come and reveal yourself to each and every one of us show us the path Lord each step of the way your word is a is a a lamp unto our feet Lord a light to our path Lord I pray that you would continue to deal with us through the days help us to hear that voice Lord when we're not at church when we're at work when we're driving leading us every step amen showing us what you want us to work on letting us know the lateness of the hour there's not much time to get ready to get prepared for you spoke there said be ready in an hour I come where you think not Lord bless your people may each one be prepared you're coming for a bride that is prepared Lord by faith we believe we're that bride and we we want whatever it takes we don't want to miss it Lord be merciful and continue to lead and guide and speak to us forgive us of of putting you off Lord forgive us for just kind of putting things under the rug or putting it to a later day Lord help us to remember today is the day of salvation today is the day to build May these virtues continue to be added may we encourage one another in this path that you're leading us Lord we thank you for these things we commit oursel to you and we trust you that you'll guide us to the other side for we pray these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen praise the Lord let's just sing
