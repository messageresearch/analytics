example of Jesus in all of our routine and I tell him it's not just to believe the message it's not just to walk around to say I'm born in the message it's not just to say I am a preacher but he is to

wanted to show some some pictures in just a second here uh from Brother Boaz I I want to say special greetings to everyone that's at home that's live streaming um our prayers are with you we're praying that God will give you a speedy recovery and we appreciate each and every one of you that are um respecting others that are here trying to keep the sickness out of the church it's that time of the year where it's just now starting to get cold and things may get worse and worse and of course uh the the two that have been battling the the covid which continue to pray for the wensley family that it would uh just stop and not spread amen I know they would appreciate our prayers but I want to thank each of you for coming because you're healthy amen amen and we certainly appreciate uh and want to welcome our brother Joseph Ben with us from the Congo and we're just going to pray for you brother that God will lead and guide you into his perfect will for your life is something that we all need as continual leadership from God in our lives because he's always wanting to use us and direct us amen things that we may not even be thinking about um but brother Boaz had sent some some pictures and I like to if we could put those on the voices dear brothers and sisters greetings to you all in Jesus name by the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ uh four people were baptized today please pray for these new souls and thank you all for your love and your prayers brother Boaz so I just think it's encouraging to to show what uh the work of the Lord's being done I believe the Bible tells us that that um it's it's uh uh healthy for us it's good for us it's encouraging to get good news from a foreign land don't don't quite know how that that scripture goes but it is a blessing uh to know that um your support is um helping Brothers to um carry the gospel to new Souls and we may not have that reward right now but on the other side all these people that you've been attached to you can spend ten thousand years with every one of them and you're still going to have so much time when it's left over because there won't be no time it'll be eternity amen so we appreciate brother Boaz and you know today um brother Costco we've been working with him um nearly 25 years or so in today's his 76 75th birthday and so we appreciate all that he has done for the kingdom of God in in Central America amen God bless you let's stand together for the reading of the word um how many is thankful for the word of God amen where would we be without uh in absolute and where would we be without someone to open it to us amen so we're grateful for the prophet we're grateful for the fivefold ministry and we're grateful for the Holy Spirit amen that that does the Revelation amen does the revealing and and shows us we just want to read uh three verses here starting with verse uh 24 um and before we be read this if we could just look to the Lord in a word of prayer our heavenly father we thank you for your precious word and so many things can be gained uh in in every page of the Bible a reverse of the Bible and Lord we're wanting what you have for us today and it may not be what uh we were thinking about when we woke up today or perhaps even what we were praying about this week because we all have so many various needs and desires and directions for our life but Lord I believe that contained in the scriptures today and in the message today that you are here for your people to lead to guide to direct to encourage to strengthen and to fortify and to help us in the in the days to come not pray Lord that you would give us a little glimpse of the reward that you have for us at the end of the road father bless this word now be with each family in each home wherever they might be Lord I ask that the Holy Spirit would reveal yourself to each of them Lord those of us that have gathered here I pray Lord that we could feel your presence just the same Lord because you are the same yesterday today and forever and you promise to be we're just two or three were gathered and our brother even testified that he felt your presence Lord May each of us feel that same presence we give you ourselves forgive us of our sins forgive us of our trespasses forgive us of anything that would hinder uh you from doing what you desire to do in our hearts our minds and our lives and Lord the prayers that we have prayed for our loved ones that we long to see Lord uh walking in all the truth that has been given to them Father we are trusting you for all these things and we commit ourselves to you in this service receive praise now we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Hebrews chapter 11 starting here with verse number 24 by faith Moses when he had come to years he refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward amen God bless you may be seated amen well we live in the most comfortable age that has ever existed can you imagine Adam and Eve sitting down to watch TV in the garden or Joshua and Caleb under Apple cell phones doing some face time discussing the battle that they were ready to go into we have gone from hollowing out tree logs to make little boats to putting a 350 engine in the back of a ship and basically flying across the water we have more conveniences today than has ever existed in history and we've all been blessed with these conveniences to be honest with you but they can also be a curse and I think one of the greatest tricks the enemy has put in in the churches in in the world is that they feel they are blessed by getting what they want and and honestly it takes them away from needing God more right the more that you get what you want the less you think about what what you need and so it can be a great curse people want to live more comfortable the spirit of this ages is enticing people just to be more comfortable to take the easier path in life and and people have gotten to where they don't need uh others so that they feel that every every man is formed South it's about his own life that matters it's about his own family his own home and it's all about self it's always been about self in every age but it seems like this age people have such a vicious right they're willing to fight for what they want right and brother Brian Thomas this was a rights age a woman's age but it's also we see that sin has got to such a place that that people are willing to go to to court and change the laws and change the Constitution to get what they want we live in an age where people don't want to lay down their lives they don't want to give up their time they don't want to give up their resources just to help other people it just doesn't seem fun convenient to look on the things of others the easier way to serve God who would want to serve God if it's going to hurt and that's how the spirit has gotten in this age uh people are willing to serve God if it's convenient if it works out to their schedule if it doesn't hurt too much if they can gain something out of it then they see a willingness to serve God but this morning we want to talk about choosing to serve God his harder way entitle this message choosing to walk the harder way Walking with God his way is just simply not easy amen he will ask you to do things that you thought you'd never have to do I made some promises to my wife that I couldn't keep because it wasn't God's will and instead of me saying the Lord willing we're never going to have a business I said we're never going to have a business because my dad had a business and I saw what it did in the family and the separation the time and I just knew right off the bat I didn't want that we're never going to have that but that was not God's will because I believe that you can have a business and have it the way God wants it to be to put it in its place to have it's time for it and then time for God but most people don't ought to do that to be honest with you I didn't even know it even existed but we are seeing our opening scripture that Moses chose the harder way he chose to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season I mean why couldn't he just chose to be with the people of God without the suffering why does that all why does that have to be there because that's just the way it is he valued the reproach of Christ there's a reproach that comes from being a Christian amen greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the record Pence of the reward he watched the people of God suffer from the palace he knew it was wrong but honestly he didn't know how to handle it he didn't know how to handle the situation he didn't know how to trust God for the Deliverance so he took it upon himself during a time of his anger and he tried to set things straight and he ended up killing a man right amen amen but when the appointed time came Moses had enough Faith to choose the harder way to choose the harder way it wasn't at the beginning but Moses chose to be looked at as rejected a low lifer perhaps in the the sight of uh uh everyone in in in in in in the pharaoh's uh Camp uh stupid or dumb for his decisions to leave he was regarded as weak incapable and despised but he chose to be looked at as as ill-treated used scorned persecuted and Afflicted of a much greater value than popularity then fame or Fortune and to me we all have a choice in values what we what we value God God bless uh brother Batman uh this this this morning I I believe him or his wife sister Linda had given a pen to my wife to give to me that is a real old pen but it's of great great value and we we and we just appreciate that we're gonna hold on to that remember the story that brother Brown told about the one that had the violin most people didn't think it was worth anything and didn't want to pay much for it and and after the unveiling of what sound that violin made then it become of a greater value and all of us put a value on serving God on Christ and what it's worth to us right show them by the time that we we give but Moses considered being talked about abused oppressed more valuable than trying to prove he was right all the time as a Christian Moses knew that all the Vengeance belonged to God that God was a judge that it wasn't up to men to try to compensate for what he lost or or tried to make amends for things that that uh he got taken away from him that's why the scripture says give and don't expect in return Moses had respect that God was going to be the one to compensate him so he looked away from all that he could gain and he kept his eyes on Jesus he focused on the will of God for his life and I'll say it like this Moses chose the harder way brother Brandon said in the true Easter seal and he's talking about uh the prophecy that came to him and what God spoke to him and he said because those chosen the Narrow Path the heart away that thou was walked of thy known choosing and he says here see you choose it yourself we all got to make that choice are we going to choose to serve God his way the harder way are we going to keep trying to look for the easier way see you choose it yourself Moses made his own choice he didn't have to do it neither did I have to take this path I could have had big buildings out yonder like some of them has got I could be all across on television choice you know many people choose popularity they choose money they choose popularity they choose things to make it worthwhile to them but very few people look at serving God for one thing I just want to please him who saved me and I'll do it at all costs amen if there's nothing not enough getting out of it they're not going to serve God that that way and I'd say if you're going to serve God his way it will be the harder way yeah we all Satan's always trying to show us an easier way just like he did Eve just like he did all the the Angels when he stole the angels he's showing him an easier way you don't gotta listen to this guy you do what you want to do look I laughed it it was okay why don't you leave yeah well Lucifer he didn't get destroyed I'll follow him I I want to do my own thing the Temptation that we have is always to serve God the easier way and yeah I want I want us to be reminded that it's a harder way but I also want us to be reminded that there's a reward coming for us there is a reward for choosing the harder way we all want God to be with us like he was with Moses God told Joshua as I was with Moses so shall I be with you we all want that and honestly God had spoke that one time to me in Prophecy as I was with Moses so shall I be with you we all want that but are we all wanting to walk the hard way see it's like we want a part of God that's going to benefit us but the other part that doesn't benefit us we shy away from and you can't do that it's like separating God from his word you can't separate uh God's good way from his bad way everything about God is good we just have to come to grips with it that the harder way is the good way so if you want God to be with you like he was with Moses you must choose the harder way for yourself now I'm not talking about just attending a a message church and calling that the harder way I'm talking about choosing the harder way of life every single day just like the prophet taught us if there's a union in your heart to want to walk closer to God it'll be harder it won't be easier it'll be hard everyday choices are made people make thousands of decisions every day right I can imagine the devil giving them a lot to choose from every adult who makes dozens and dozens of informed decisions you don't change their mind a lot a recent study showed that of those informed decisions that every adult makes 87 percent of them change their minds after they already decided crazy you talk about people wandering around not knowing what they should be doing for which way to take in the same Study 37 percent of the people found it difficult to decide what to eat or what TV show to watch 29 struggle with what to wear each day now we've all done that should I wear this or should I wear that 27 struggle whether to buy something new or not eleven percent of those people are confused changing their minds at least five times per decision people are struggling to make all kinds of choices in their life and you think a person who's indecisive in the natural like that is going to choose to choose the harder way no they're not going to they're not going to be looking they're not going to want to sit down and and and and hear the scriptures talk about an a harder way when they can go next door to a church that's talking about the easier way the Hardaway is only chosen by those who love the Lord with all their heart amen it takes genuine love for God to choose the harder way to take the back seat to go the second mile to love those who despitefully use you and say oh a manner of evil against you to give up your life in order to hunt for Souls that already ordained have been ordained to eternal life they're out there we don't know who they are but to give up your life just to find one of them is a harder life without the mindset of Fame a fortune a recognition of reputation Paul was a man who chose the easier path of life before he met Christ he chose popularity with people great esteem to build a reputation for himself Saul wanted to stick out and be a a Hebrew of the Hebrews he considered himself blameless concerning the righteousness which is in the law he was a Pharisee of the Pharisees he had so much Zeal that he actually persecuted the Church of God the Bible tells us amen he set himself to the offense of what he believed in other words he couldn't trust God that all Vengeance belonged to God that God needed some help so he went out there and was offensive he had no understanding of spiritual warfare at that time he didn't he thought he thought we'd just fight against flesh and blood we'll just take these Christians and we'll kill him we'll put them in prison we'll do what we got to do to get this out of here amen biting devouring hating destroying killing the nature of man who hasn't been regenerated it's the way people think before their life becomes regenerated the scripture tells us that Saul was breathing out threatenings and Slaughter against the Disciples of the Lord and against them who were who who found choosing to live in this harder way the ball Paul calls it this way right or as he as he's as the book of Acts is being written Maybe by Luke if I could say it like this he said he got anybody that was in this way they threw him in prison well what is this way it's God's way right it's it's the harder way but there was a time that God got a hold of Saul I'll say it like this got a hold of his spiritual attention and said Saul Saul why are you persecuting me you're not persecuting humans other people you're persecuting me we got to think about that when we when we go and we say something about somebody do something that that's hurtful to somebody it ain't against them it's against God and Jesus said uh why why you're persecuting me I'm Jesus whom thou persecutest in other words what you've done to the least of these little ones you've really done it to me God feels every persecution that comes against us and if you value it as an honor or a greater treasure then being lifted up you have a great reward coming because to be mistreated is the way of a Christian Life I know it's not the modern terminology it's not what we want but it is remember when Jesus when he was talking and he uh uh about the the the the the the Pharisees and the people who wanted others to look up to them amen he said they have their reward that's what they their main motive their main focus was that they could be have some recognition down here where when we're serving God our reward doesn't come from this side it comes on the other side our reward comes later we just need to have respect unto the recompense of the reward have confidence that God is going to compensate you on the other side don't worry about this side you know I I talk to people for years and I've seen that it's all about settling things now having things to be right now that that that's not fair what what has happened and I'm I'm saying God rewards us on the other side God didn't go back in Paul's life Moses's life uh brother Brandon's life and make everybody pay for the wrong that was done against them God settles everything on the other side God judges who you want to judge here and and judges who he wants to on the other side that's just it's just the way it is but we need to focus on the harder way is between us and God it ain't between us and God and everybody else right and if somebody else mistreats us somebody else does something wrong that we need to like get all huffled and bothered and Feathers all fluffed up and you know got to say this got to say that got to tell this person got to tell that person you know that's not serving God the harder way serving God the hard way is go to that person in private have enough holy ghost in you and enough love of God in you to get things where they need to get to without anybody else hearing about it right that's the harder way but I don't feel I can do that they won't listen to me well then what you need to do is get down in your knees and get a hold of God [Music] don't make up some excuse for going talking about somebody one day God's mercy rewrote Saul's life and how did he do it he showed Saul that he wasn't what he thought he was that was really Mercy that was shown him that amen that he wasn't as great as he thought he was in fact he honestly got the Revelation that he was nothing and gave him a revelation that he literally had to give up everything he had his whole life his reputation everything had to become zero new plane I'm nothing I don't want nothing about my password and I couldn't talk about it it's all about a new creature now that's when mercy rewrote his life in fact one of the revelations that Saul got is when what Jesus told ananias when he said for I must show him how great things he must suffer he had to have that revelation here he was persecuting the Christians why because he didn't understand that was truly God's way well just because Saul became a Christian it does not mean that everybody knows he Paul's the right way now he's the one that's going to be persecuted from somebody else and I'm telling you if when we're walking god's way the devil's going to make sure he's got somebody on your tail right true because God wants to destroy anything that's authentic the devil wants to destroy anything that's authentic anything that's pure anything that's wonderful lovely anything that's true blue God mix it up and he don't care but the bride won't be mixed she's going to be a sold out group and she's paying the price now she's not taking the easy path she has chosen the harder way love can be the only motivation that's willing to suffer to help others I believe that love for Christ and a willingness to suffer for Christ they're in direct relationship if a person hardly loves the lord they're hardly going to be willing to suffer I believe if a person is loves the Lord with all everything they got they're willing to suffer whatever it takes is that that love is that unworthiness to give up more of your life and you know we all are in the message we all are Christians but we don't all love God the same we want to love God the same we want to get to that place where we love them with all of our heart with all of our soul with all of our might but the but the the fact is their internal choices and everybody makes a different decision the message is true we all say Amen to the word we all believe it's true but do we all love him the same because with every every encounter with the word is like when Jesus talked to the Rich Young Ruler and he said you know give up all that you got and go distribute it to the poor and when you've got rid of everything kind of like Saul then come follow me and there's things that we we hold on to and they may not be monetarily uh things they may be just simply like I don't I I I love who I am I want my reputation I don't want to give that up in fact I want people to know how great I am but you know friends it's hard to really serve God the harder way when that is important to you when that is important to you you're you're you're only going to go so far in serving God and after that you're going to stop amen you've got to be willing to Bear the reproach of just giving up everything for Christ so instead of Paul now being on the offense he goes on the defense he became wise as a serpent harmless as a dove in Philippians chapter 1 verse 12 if we could just begin reading there Philippians chapter 1 verse 12 but I would ye should understand brethren and I'm sorry for not giving you time to turn there in the scriptures but I would ye should be you should understand Brethren that the things which have happened unto me have fallen out rather unto the furthest of the Gospel so here's a man he's in prison the these things have come against him he gets thrown into prison and um it looks like a very shaky time we know that Timothy was a man that was greatly bothered because of what Paul went through and he began to fear and and Paul was trying to tell him look God has not given you the spirit of fear amen and anything uh perfect love cast that out God has given us the spirit of of a sound mind of of love and and a peace and and and and the things that come of the Holy Ghost the holy spirit this is what God has given us but Timothy battling in his flesh hadn't totally surrendered and and God told or or Paul told Timothy to embrace it to embrace this this is this harder way and you can read about this in second Timothy chapter uh Second Timothy chapter one so that my bonds he said that my Bonds in Christ are manifest in all the palace and in all other places everybody knows about it and as many and many of the brethren in the lord they're waxing confident buy my bonds and are much more bold to speak the word without fear in other words they saw some of these Brethren saw Paul being persecuted and yet he's standing for Christ he's now whining about how bad it is how hard it is and that boy ain't worth doing that and you know that's forget it no he embraced it he called it an honor he caught it of a greater value then all the fame out there without the problems with having the whole world behind me it was worth so much more to him look at those that were that were in prison and and they they were thrown into prison and they said that they counted an honor that they could suffer for the name of the Lord the reward was so much greater they valued suffering for Jesus more than not suffering amen and and this is the thing that our flesh is our flesh is looking for constant I don't want to suffer it's just part of God's way and as soon as you step out of that way and it's about convenience and it's about what you enjoy I want you to understand that God may not be in that way God may not be in that way now I understand he said he'd never leave us or forsake us but that doesn't mean we don't leave his way right right we got to stay in the way and it's a Hallelujah way it's a glorious way but it's also a way that's hard a way that you go through tests and trials and and and and and people do so much evil against you but you stand for the defense of the Gospel you don't prove you're right you don't prove they're wrong you just count it in honor to suffer for him because that's that just comes with the territory amen it really does now verse 15 now some indeed preach Christ even of envy and strife and some of good world will see you got people on both sides the one preached Christ of contention not sincerely supposing to add Affliction to my bonds so so when people are preaching their thoughts to you some have other agenda in their mind and uh you know people say things it's either gonna uh uh start a Strife between you know the Bible says Uh there's there's seven things that God hates and and and the seventh is an Abomination and he that stole a Discord that that that Vision that Strife amen and so God doesn't ever want a saying thing that's going to bring a division between one brother and another brother even though they're not around the spirit is wrong so verse 17 but the other of love knowing I am set or that word set means to outstretch you just you're just outstretched to help anybody come to Christ for the defense of the Gospel because I'm telling you people have to cross they have to they have to make the choice to come over to Christ and if you can just stretch out your life and and let them use you to see Christ manifested then all glory to God Amen as a complete servant of God Paul became a servant to all men knowing that he would only win a few but he became a servant to all not serving the Flesh of man right because you can't serve man and God but he became a servant unto man that man might find a way to God and he became all things to all men that he might win some of them and it really takes a servant's mentality to win souls to really win a soul it takes a a a a servant's mentality as God's servant you will be used you will be abused you will be mistreated you will be ill talked about you will be taken advantage of but as I said before it comes with the territory of choosing the harder way amen in Paul's old life he persecuted the church and Paul's new life he became persecuted and this is what I wanted us to understand that if we're not being persecuted for serving the lord because we'd be persecuted for being you know a Democrat a Republican for voting this way or that way but I'm talking about if we're not being persecuted for being a Christian we need to take a look at the way that we're walking even First Corinthians 15 9 says for I am the least of the Apostles that that am not meat to be called an apostle he wasn't didn't even feel worthy to be called Apostle because I persecuted the church look at Paul's humility and his unworthiness and indebtedness even after he repented he still felt the same way before he repented the reason he repented was because he he felt unworthy God got a hold of him said this is wrong but just because the blood of Christ covers you and that guilt is gone it doesn't mean you still don't feel unworthy amen that's where people miss it and they get rid of that and they they don't know how to they don't have no energy to serve the way God called him to but you when you realize that Christ is what Christ has done for you you are it's so easy to be sold out loud Stock and Barrel because you're not your own you've been bought with a price that's right but if you think God's given you salvation like some Christmas present you can go do what you want to do you never understand what it means to walk the hard way in one place Paul said that he persecuted the church be unmeasured and he wasted it but when God called Paul separated him from his mother's womb he had a revelation of how great things he was going to suffer and I I believe this is why so many people the majority of the people who come to Christ are not willing to walk the harder way and they stop serving God it's just the facts right and I'm I'm here not saying we don't understand those facts we do we do understand those those things here and and through our walk from here to when we're out of here the devil is going to be working very hard to get us to walk the easier path to step off the hard way and take the easier one this is what I want to say to those of you who choose to stay the harder path God will reward you but don't look for it here why do people leave now why do they quit why do they go to the Easter path because the reward isn't good enough there's it ain't worth it to them what do you get out of it no popularity no money you don't get anything out of it why do it why am I going to spend time helping somebody when I can help myself make it easier for me and this is this is what we're tempted with but our reward isn't on this side Paul never received his reward for what he went through on this side it's on the other side it's when you see the one that you brought to Christ there in eternity forever there's your reward there's your reward First Corinthians chapter 4 verse 10. we first Corinthians chapter 4 verse 10 Paul says we are fools for Christ we're fools for Christ why is Paul identifying himself as a fool for Christ because to the world only a fool would give up their life to walk the heart away because everybody in the world's look at it and says well that's crazy he didn't get nothing out of it everything he makes he's given away all his time his life what he has he's given it to help somebody that's so foolish to the world that's foolish but to those that understand that just one soul is worth it all Beyond it but we but ye are wise in Christ we are weak but you're strong you're honorable but we are despised even unto this present hour we both hunger and thirst and are naked and are buffeted and have no certain dwelling place now Paul is talking about this harder way that he chose and and labor working with our own hands not wanting somebody to give to us being reviled we bless being persecuted we suffer being defray be being defamed we entreat we are made as the filth of the world and are the off scouring of all things unto this day well Paul are you sure that you chose the right way how many people have deviated from this way and have started serving God easier still in a message church still claiming the message but the easier way says I write not these things to shame you but as my beloved Sons I warn you so Paul is sending a warning now for though you have 10 000 instructors in Christ have ye not many fathers for in Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel so he's taken these 10 000 instructors he's setting those aside and he says I am the one that begotten you in the gospel and he says wherefore I beseech you be ye followers of me in other words don't choose the easier path follow me as I have chosen the harder way he wasn't trying to get somebody to just you know I need more people in my camp I want more people in my church I want more people on my uh telegram my Facebook my following my Twitter my whatever he wasn't looking for that he was looking for those who who could catch a glimpse of what God really wanted for their life the harder path he doesn't talk well you know I got these I got these badges I got these plaques on the wall you know we blessed we get blessed more a nobody persecutes us we ain't suffering no that wasn't what he said and they'll come and follow me the easier path that's Satan baby That's what Satan told his angels angels he didn't convince a third of the angels to follow him because his way was harder and they were going to hell I don't care how many instructors there are in Christ I don't care how many fathers there are we got one true revelation of God's way and this way can only be walked of our own choosing let's follow Paul's heart away for just a moment we've read it many times in a second Corinthians chapter 11 verse 23 says are they Ministers of Christ speak as a fool he says I am more well what makes you more of a minister than somebody else Paul he says in laborers more abundant in Stripes hitting my back above measure being thrown into prison more often in dying going through the experience of death often in other Jews five times received I-40 Stripes save one Thrice I was beaten with rods once I was stoned Thrice I I suffered shipwreck a day and night have I been in the deep and Journeys often in Perils of water Perils of robbers and Perils of my own countrymen and Perils of the Heathen and perils in the city and in the country and in the wilderness and the Sea again must have went to see a lot in perils among brethren but believing falsely in weariness and painfulness and watchings often in hunger and thirst and fastings often in cold and nakedness man oh man this is the harder way amen and besides those things that are without that which comes upon me daily take care of all the churches so who is weak and I am not weak who is offended and I burn not if I'm going to Glory I'm going to glory in the things that concern my infirmities Moses counted it a greater rich or a greater value to suffer the reproach of the heart away as a Christian much greater than anything that he could get in this world and still serve God that sounds personal to me that sounds intimate to me that sounds like these men had a relationship like I want that I'm willing to give up more than I have given up this is why it's the harder way Paul chose it of his own choosing just like Moses did just like brother Brandon did now let's Embrace God's heart away for our life let's not be afraid of things being harder giving up a little bit more sacrificing a little bit more whatever you do do not compare yourself to the person you're sitting to Next in the church do not compare yourself to anybody that is so unwise we have this example in this Bible we have a Vindicated Prophet that came we have the word of God we do not need one another so we can just not have to try as hard right you look to me you may not want to go the harder way because I'm I may be going the easy way you understand what I'm saying if you look to somebody else who's not willing to pay the price and you're joining yourself with them don't you know you will become just like them you will follow whatever you hang out with the most whatever you watch whatever you listen to wherever you spend your time whatever you fellowship with that is what you will become that's why if you get into the word you dig and you say God is this the truth that I'm hearing today is this from you because there won't be very many in the Rapture I'm telling you how many will be taken from here I do not know we come here and we wonder who's going to come to church I'll say friends my precious Brothers and Sisters in Christ you need to be thinking about making a Rapture and keeping your eyes focused on what you got to do to make it because nothing else matters down here Acts chapter 24 verse 14. we need to stop looking at the easier path all the time the people we've got it easy God will reward you God will reward you know I wonder why people take the easier path because they feel there's no reward behind it they feel it's not worth it like what do I get out of it they just slap me in the face I'm not going to turn the other cheek I'm not going to go the Second Mile I'm not going to carry this brother's burden I don't get nothing out of it they don't even appreciate it they just go ahead and they do it again but if your relationship is with God oh my God's got a reward for you amen and just because you're not getting it now it doesn't mean it's not common but this I confess unto thee that after the way which they call heresy so worship I the god of my fathers believing all things that are written in the law and in the prophets Paul worshiped God by giving his life daily to convince others that Jesus Christ is the only way the only truth and the only life and he didn't just say you need to walk the harder way no he said you need Jesus Christ and his life displayed he was walking the hard way people call this giving more of your life to God a heresy you don't got to do that you don't got to do that it's unorthodox it's not the the mainstream of belief but it is God's way some people also view brother branham's way of Christianity as unorthodox as well and I've read this quote in the message of man running from the presence of God he said Christianity is an everyday rugged life living for God in this present world it is a constant burning of the fire and the love of God and the heart that sets you a fire and put you out yonder with people and making converts to Christ but the modern Church world says that's heresy I'm a Christian I don't have to do that and some people in this message look at that and say well I believe that's a an outstanding you know uh definition of a Christian and you know if it's just right and uh you know God lead me you know put something on my heart you know I'll just I'll just speak to somebody if that's not what the quote says amen right why don't we just stay with the message stay with what's written we don't want to make it something different we need to conform to it not try to get things to conform to our way of thinking that's what gets us in so much trouble amen it's good to hear some amens makes me feel like preaching [Laughter] God's harder way is to accept our responsibility amen as Christians and our responsibility is to win souls it's all there is to it we must choose the harder way make some converts for Christ while people persecute you you're blessing them we must make sure that we don't persecute others don't say negative things about others don't say any other things about brothers and sisters who we know or think we know they know better pray for them in fact you want to be a real servant get them and Unite with them in prayer say brother and sister brother sister whoever it may be I I so much believe that you're a child of God that I just want us to pray together that God will move mightily begin to build the spirit of the unity of Christ [Music] you know sometimes we just feel like well things got to get worked out here there and everything else before I'm going to be in unity with somebody brother sister if Christ had to do that for you you would have never came his love surrounded you for what his great love we're with he loved you showed he loved you first then you repented amen Galatians chapter 4 verse 28 now we Brethren as Isaac was are the children of Promise how many believes that you're a child of the promise but as then he that was born after the flesh persecuted him that was born after the spirit and Paul is saying to the galatian church even so it is now so I say unto you if you find yourself certain things slipping out about somebody according to the scriptures here it's a good indication that that's of the flesh and you're persecuting that which is of the spirit so I just say don't give a some excuse or some reason or why you think it's needed just stay with the word amen stay with the word you can't go wrong stay with the word if you let the devil begin to reason with you well this shouldn't have been and this was wrong and this has got to be you know somebody's got to do something about it really I think God has called us to the defense of the Gospel not the offense take a look at the Beatitudes a little bit we see in the Beatitudes boy time is just drifting so quickly we see that there's many Rewards or blessings that come from those who accept their Heavenly responsibilities is that true Matthew chapter 5. now I'll say it like this love the word love the word I'm going to go a little extra because um our brother Orlando he came in late and I just want to go over through these things so God bless our brother for pressing in and making it it just I'll tell you that ministers to me that ministers to me choosing the harder way but you see in the Beatitudes here he's talking about the the uh the the blessed are those are poor in spirit that that mourn that that are Meek that that hunger and thirst for God that are um that are merciful that are pure in heart that are the peacemakers he's speaking to all these who are blessed who do them but you notice that those things are the harder way it's much harder to be merciful than to just say it's just like it was reap what you sow you deserve that I told you I warned you it's it's this when he's speaking these beautiful Beatitudes it is the harder way it's so hard it's much harder to be meek when you just want to be loud and tell everybody you know who you are what you know and all this that and the other so it's the harder way and look what he says here in verse number nine okay blessed are the peacemakers for they shall be called the children of God now a peacemaker let's just say that brother Mark has a problem with Brother Joseph Ben and um a peacemaker doesn't come and say all right I know you'll give me Grace for saying this brother Mark you're wrong Brother Joseph Ben you're right that is not a peacemaker that's someone that's stating what's right or wrong a peacemaker honestly a peacemaker never ever finds uh uh the appreciation or gratitude by either party because both have to give up something because if they didn't if they didn't then the one who didn't have to do it would be able to make peace himself but you've got to humble yourself under your brother who's wrong you've got to get underneath you've got to wash their feet you you've got to with neatness and if you're not willing to do that then you can't make peace it's part of getting the peace and so this is the harder way all right go with me here verse number nine blessed are the peacemakers okay verse 10 blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake for theirs is the kingdom of heaven heaven not for a living your way but for a living God's way who in their right mind would want to go through persecution blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness sake you know a lot of times we get persecuted for our own mistakes but to go ahead and just you know go out there and you know you're going to get persecuted for it but you're blessed for doing it even though you're not getting anything at that moment even though you don't feel good about it but look at here it is blessed are ye when men shall revile you and persecute you and say all manner of evil against you falsely for my sake for my sake Pierce if you're trying to win souls and through this of of winning Souls you're going to get persecuted because the devil don't want you doing it that's why the persecution's coming but if you're you're you're going to win souls because that's really what the Christ's sake is that's what the the sake of the Gospel is that's why we hear it that's why Paul shared it with everyone was to win some Souls and if you're going to be sharing the gospel with others you're going to be persecuted you're going to be reviled you're going to be defamed you're you're going to get people saying evil things about you they're going to chide you they're going to taunt you they're going to rail against you you're going to go through persecutions people are going to say all manner of evil why because it's the harder way he said rejoice and be exceedingly glad for great is your reward in heaven notice where the reward comes for soul persecuted they the prophets which were before you see don't you think it would be an honor to be persecuted just like the prophets were amen I just believe it would be an honor and that's what Paul had that's what Moses had they they counted that a greater value to them than anything they could have gained without the persecution I just love the scriptures I say be like Moses choose the harder way choose to suffer Affliction with the real people of God than to enjoy some Pleasures for a season choose the reproach of Christ a greater value than all the riches that you can have keep your eyes on the reward that comes in the next life get a vision people who can't see beyond this aren't willing to do anything here if all you're going to do is work for a reward here you're not you're you won't be doing very much for Christ I I I believe this why did God why why did all in the Bible it was always the harder way the disciples Paul Moses why because God's way is higher than our way his thoughts are higher than our thoughts and and we don't see the way he sees we don't comprehend the way he does and Satan is always trying to with our human intellect and our human understanding to show us that there's an easier way to serve God especially in this Modern Age maybe a more intellectual more more uh you know you just go and you say the word to somebody and and and and if they're seed you know what do you need a life for just get them put them in a headlock play Push tape let him hear it let go if that's what it is no God wanted the World to See Jesus and Paul and God wants the world our world whoever we're around to see Christ in US amen all who choose the harder way is going to Bear the reproach of being a Christian look at Mary she bore a reproach she was persecuted for carrying a child without being married and then she had to bear that reproach all through her life even though the baby was born and to some who believed who who had a revelation this was a work of God but think about the Millions who knew about it who weren't who were who were Jews or whoever they were that did not would not believe she had to bear that reproach every time she went to the store and but that was of a greater value to her all the things that she went through having an illegitimate child yet God said she was highly favored she was blessed among women I'll tell you what she went through doesn't sound like it's highly favored to me a daughter sent this to me yesterday I just wanted to read it to you she was highly favored speaking of Mary but was almost put away by the man that she loved the most highly favored but she rejected by every person in Bethlehem highly favored but she laid on the dirt floor of a barn and gave birth to a baby she carried nine months highly favored but in the middle of the night had to leave all that she knew and moved to a strange city because God said so favor never looks like favor at first favor sometimes takes you through frustrations and failure and fear you want to be favored of God it may be the darkest night the deepest valley but they're in that place where no one sees you you will feel no one understands but hear a whisper to yourself this is only the beginning not the end this will turn out for your good and His glory because you're highly favored and we got to look at the end you got to look at the end I think you know Mary's life wasn't like she was some crown queen of of everyone it wasn't like that it's on the other side we got to keep our eyes on the reward that's going to come on the other side now God has choices as well as I'm closing up just please just a couple more minutes if you will bear with me God has choices as well he makes choices he's choosing a bride brother bran gave that message just like he chose Mary and I believe he's choosing a bride out of all the Believers who have chosen to go the harder way I believe that now they're ordained before the foundation where God knows who that they are predestined but I believe it is that group who will not be deceived who will go the harder way and God has chosen to reward those who choose to walk the hard way those who make the choice not to go the easy way those who make the choice not to persecute but to allow to be persecuted remember when Jesus was reviled he reviled not again not back he will reward you with a catching away with a Rapture with a wedding with sitting with them on the throne and we need to keep our eyes on that reward you need to be thinking about the people that you spoke to here even if it's just one that comes up to you on the other side and says I wouldn't have made it without you because nothing else down here matters just the souls that you will win to him look I can encourage a lot of people and I can help a lot of people and I can give to a lot of people but I'll tell you when it gets on the other side the only thing that's going to matter is the souls that have been won because that's so it will be there because of you and think about that think about that statement they that win souls is wise that's the harder way and to really win somebody you got to be willing to give up your time give up your resources give up what you have to see that person get to a a new birth or a regeneration a new nature to where his life has changed that's how we know that they're going to be there choose the harder way Enoch chose to walk the harder way every day and look it got him a private rapture brother Brandon chose the heart away and and God told him a huge portion of Heaven awaits him it wasn't because he was he spoke as a great minister no it was because he chose the harder way last scripture here in Romans chapter 8 verse 15 or chapter eight yeah verse 15 through 19 and I'm closing for ye have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we're crying Abba Father so I'll tell you just get rid of any fear don't have it part of your life the spirit itself and I'll tell you there's a big fear about going the harder way but God's in that way so there's nothing to fear the spirit itself bear with witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children then we're heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ we're looking at a reward right now if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together right doesn't the scripture say if we don't suffer we don't reign right for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in US so now here is you know Paul's telling us don't look at what you're going through down here it is not worthy to be comparative it's a much greater value or with the glory that's going to be revealed on the other side for the earnest expectation of the creature wadeth for the manifestations of the sons of God amen may God just so put his holy ghost inside inside of us that we can become a completely manifested Son of God amen let's Stand Together thank you for your patience this morning to each and every one of you choose to walk the harder way amen I know the Lord will make a way for me let's sing that little chorus [Music] Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord Lord will make a way for me if I live a holy life shun the wrong and do the right I know the Lord will make a way for me let's just say that a couple of times I know the Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord will make a way for me if I live a holy life shun the wrong and do the right I know the Lord will make a way for me I know the Lord will make a way for amen we are as chosen I know the Lord will make a way for me if I live a holy light shine the wrong and do the right I know the Lord will make a way for me amen as she
