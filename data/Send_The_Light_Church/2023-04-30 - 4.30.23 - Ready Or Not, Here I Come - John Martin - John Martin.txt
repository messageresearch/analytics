you for loving us Lord hallelujah none of us would be here today if it wasn't for God loving us first amen how many is glad to be here today I got a quote from a missionary in India and he it's from the message ever present water from the Rock brother Brian says every Sunday morning we go to church and sometimes we can get a rut amen and he says every Sunday morning back to church what do we hear the same thing the preachers stand up and preach songs go back so then you're just going as a line of duty you're not a worshiper a worshiper goes there to worship to express himself before his God to praise God for his goodness to every word he hangs on to it Just Like A Love Affair he goes on tell a little story about if if you just went out with this girl or or this girl went out with this boy because it was kind of like you were asked to do it you really wouldn't want to do it you couldn't wait till it's over you're just going through the motions he said that's the same way it is when you say or think why does he preach so long what is all this stuff and everything he says you're you're not in love but when you really hang on to every word as the spirit gave you warning this morning see hanging on to every word that might be what he has been talking to you about so hold on to it it's eternal life every word of God he said it's a joy to go to church under any circumstance this is where I want to get to whether it's hot or cold it's indifferent whether the people are fussing or growling whatever they're doing it's still a joy to hear the word of the Lord then you're in love with Christ see you love to go to church well honey here it's Sunday morning again I guess we have to wash up and get the youngins and get down there my it's it's so boring see you're not in love but if you're really in love you just can't wait till Sunday Morning Comes you just got to get down with them the people of God they don't bore you why they're your brothers and sisters amen I just say it's good to be gathered together with brothers and sisters of light precious Faith no matter what I'd rather be here and of course we're here we're here because we want to become more like Christ and uh God sent his word to do that a five-fold Ministry and it's I just counted a privilege to be with my precious brothers and sisters let's go to the Lord this morning in in a in a word of prayer before I pray I just want to say thank you I contacted a couple of years to pray for us yesterday and I believe God heard your prayers and I just want to say I don't understand how prayer works it's a supernatural thing but I do know that it works I do know that the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man it works more and and I just believe in prayer and I think the devil is trying to keep us from from praying and uh we had a a wonderful prayer meeting last prayer meeting and uh it's just good to see it's getting better and better and better and we're pressing in because if there's one thing we're going to need in this age before we get out of here is more prayer amen yes sir yeah amen let's look to him and in a word of prayer this morning our heavenly father we come to you because we have no one else that we can turn to and know that our need our every need can be met so we thank you this morning for letting us know who where our strength comes from where our help comes from where every everything that we would have need of Lord you can supply that answer you can supply that direction you can supply that need your word declares that my God shall supply all of your need according to thy riches in glory and father we just thank you this morning that you're here to do exceedly above all that we could ask or ever think of you to do so we come with faith this morning before you're thrown Lord we're applying our faith to this prayer knowing that you said Lord you're the one that said that whatever you desire When you pray believe and you shall have it and Lord we come as your believing children this morning may you meet the needs that would be amongst his father we want to be in your image and we pray that you just draw us all closer to you in doing so Lord we know that we'll be drawn closer to one another father we commit this service into your hands we just pray that you bless the reading of the word and father the the message that she sent for us this morning we just pray that you'd give us all ears to hear and to be able to to respond to your word with uh accepting it into our lives father we thank you now for these things we give you the praise for them all for we ask it in Jesus Christ precious name amen amen God bless you let's turn to Matthew chapter 24 we got just a little uh uh few four scriptures uh or four verses of scriptures this morning and we'll have you be see we know we you've been standing a little bit the first one is in Matthew chapter 24 verses 42-44 and then we're going to turn to Revelations 19. amen the scripture says started in verse 42 Jesus said watch therefore ye know not what our your lord doth come but know this that if the good man of the house had known what watched the thief would come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh amen now there's a little group of people that took heed to that scripture and we see him rejoicing here in chapter 19 of Revelations verse number 7 let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife have made herself ready amen praise the Lord God bless you may be seated now I know there's many needs amongst us and and we're all looking to the Lord for different request Direction in our lives Comfort understanding finances and the time that we're living in is probably the most hardest time that there ever been on the face of the Earth when you you talk about um everything there's such a snare that Satan has brought on this world and there's been so much confusion in in our medical field we just went through the most craziest thing with the Colvin and uh the the the the the the nation is getting in worse shape and we know that Satan is weakening the Nations and uh um Jesus told us that in the last days that um iniquity were to bound and hatred increase and it people Paul said people would become more unthankful in us they're just basically more unfriendly and and uh and I I believe there's many things that we could be talking about this morning but I I want to talk about being ready for the coming of the Lord because that's really there's there's come in a day and a time that it's going to happen and no matter what's going on out here we are not going to have everything taken care of it right it isn't like I'm going to have all this paid for and all the finances are taken care of and the the cars they got their oil changed and this ready now everything is good the beds are made and now we're ready and so we need to focus on what's really important that's us being ready and so I want to entitle this message ready or not here I come and this message I want to say this this message is the only thing that can get us ready for Rapture and I just want to let that be the subject for us today we all remember when we were younger we used to play a little game called hide and seek and when we were playing and there used to be someone that had to find somebody and we were trying to find the best spot and sometimes we didn't get ready in time and they say ready or not here I come and they would and you weren't ready yet you weren't fully hid all the leaves weren't on you and you were easy to be found and you said I wasn't ready yet you came too quick now when it comes to the coming of the Lord he's coming whether we're ready or not but the thing is we're not left without an opportunity to get ready he has given us that opportunity today now most of us feel confident that we are ready for the coming of the Lord how come we didn't have any amens for that statement I just want to know I want you to know I'm listening to you but are we really ready or do we think we're ready this message was sent to get us ready and it's imperative that this message is living out of our lives the laodicean church also feels that they're absolutely ready but it's a false sense of security just as every man is right in his own eyes the foolish versions where I talk a little bit about those this morning they feel that they're ready that they're in need of nothing but their whole way of thinking is it's lukewarm there's no fire in them there's no pressing towards the mark of the High Calling there's no desperation I got to get perfect love there's no urgency to align their lives up with the complete word of God they are battling and I don't know if you really really realize this but we all have Spirits coming against us telling us that you are okay the Way You Are there is no need to dig in anymore and if you need Scripture Satan will give you scripture he'll do whatever he has to do to cool your jets to keep you from being on fire for God so when we're thinking about being ready we should never base it on how we feel neither can we go by how much we know right brother Brian says we live in the most intellectual age there is we can't go by works alone although faithfulness is a must faithfulness is a must we shouldn't feel safe just because we're in a message Church message Believers can feel just as comfortable just as complacent as as Believers in the denominational Church Satan has mimicked God's spirit in this age so close that there's only a few elect that are ever going to see the difference if we're supposed to work out our own salvation with fear and trembling I believe we ought to be working out getting ready for the Rapture if you're in trembling our God is a consuming fire amen Jesus told us to be ready so if we're not ready the first thing we need to do is get ready and once we get ready we have to remain ready so if you get ready remain ready that means you're ready that's what Jesus meant when he said be ready but if the moment you don't remain ready you're not rapturable so this is a much more higher calling than just you know get baptized accept the message have an experience of the Holy Ghost that it's that is not good enough so I'm not an evangelist I'm not going to come across in an evangelistical way today but I want to provoke you to Good Works remaining rapturable means you're on fire your lamp is burning and people can see your light up for Christ so ready or not he's coming so I say we must remain ratchetable now how do we know we're really ready how do we know that this is the hour that he's supposed to come so in describing the the condition of the hour that Jesus would return the Bible gives us a number of indicators we see Israel's return into her Homeland in 1947 and Jesus said that that generation would not pass now we've talked about a generation being 40 years and 50 years and you know I'm so glad God interprets his word by bringing it to pass we don't need to know exactly the day in fact God himself kept the angels from knowing what day he's coming back why he wants to see a love affair take place he wants to see who is going to sell out be sold out and their focus is heaven come on their focus is it's so easy to just have uh well you know as long as I got that taken care of I'm going to live down here God's not looking for that another one Jesus said as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be in the coming of the son of man there is nothing but evil on the minds of the people during that day as it was of the days a lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man perversion was so so great that it vexed the home of the righteous think about that it grew right around the church homosexuality and the different things and today this transgender is nothing but an offshoot of homosexuality amen the Bible says for this call as God gave them up unto vile affections for even their women did change the natural use into which is against nature I know we can relate to this with what's going on and likewise also men leaving their natural use of the women burn in their lust one toward another men with men working that which is unseemly and receiving in themselves that recompense of their air which was meat and even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge God gave them over to a reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient now you want to write that down that's Romans 1 sometime you can go back and read that I was talking to someone yesterday just here in the church and he was telling me just saw in the news that there was this two couples they were um they lived in this kind of an apartment and this one person of this couple uh one one of the persons of the couple he went and killed his partner and then also killed the other couple in the apartment will come to find out the one that killed um him and his partner um one was a male in this marriage one was a male and and transgendered he didn't really become a woman but he wanted to be one and the woman she she was a transgender too and she became a man and they got married I I mean as it was in the days of lot we're living in the hour where the spirit brother by him says people die but Spirits do not die amen and we must take life seriously yeah we we don't want to be numb to what's happening right but these are signs for us to be ready another indicator is that there are so many people and Believers that are thinking that God's not coming for a while and Jesus said therefore be ready for in such an hour as you think not the son of man cometh and if there was ever an hour where people don't think God's coming this is the hour if they did they would get more serious Believers they're leaving Christianity by the multitudes pretty soon Christianity is going to be such a minute group there's a great falling away a great apostasy people who once were in this message have first are forsaking it and they're literally mocking the truth the scripture says knowing this first that there shall come in the last days scoffers walking after their own lust and saying where is the promise of his coming for since the fathers fell asleep all things continue as they were from the beginning of creation this is what's happening this is this is why it's so hard to go up to somebody and share the gospel with them now the spirit speaketh expressively that in the latter times some shall depart from the faith why giving heed to seducing spirits and doctrines of devils now seducing Spirits are nothing but Impostors misleading spirits their job is to mislead you Impostors these are spirits that act like they're right they don't even know they're necessarily the people that have these spirits on them they don't know that that spirit is even on them they act like they're right but that spirit is trying to mislead you doctrines of devil now I'll tell you what a doctrine of the devil is is someone who takes part of the word and refuses to take the rest of it that to me is a doctrine of the devil because men shall live by every word of God we need every word of God now God has a bride and the devil has a bride brother Brandon said in the message God of this evil age he said she is the devil's bride wrapped up in his religious sin loving knowledge for this present evil age to deceive you oh my a whole crochet cliche of seducing Spirits by in scientific knowledge and modern civilization there are so many weird things happening in this message things I would never ever believe would happen weird stuff we're certainly living in the closing hour of his return and I just say ready or not he's coming ready or not he's coming God is not waiting around for those who have been ignoring the truth to get ready he is not waiting around for those he's waiting for those who haven't had a chance to receive the truth to hear it so we can get out of here there will always be people who are going to be borderline believers who are not really serious about God right look we have they have a chance and Brother Band says no man is is should ever get to hear the gospel twice if everybody hasn't heard it once that's how important it is it only takes one message brother Brandon said there will be those that make it with one message so when we come here and we're blessed and we're blessed we pertain some we're blessed and we're blessed and then we still refuse to give everything to God that we can help us Lord help us Lord to get ready let's take a look at these ten virgins in Matthew chapter 25. I wasn't going to read this because I have so much stuff this morning and I'll tell you we got about 18 different quotes from different messages I mean 18 different messages and this is what happens when you you go on vacation for a month and you don't got nothing to do all right Matthew chapter 25 verses 1 through 13 then shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened to ten virgins which took their lambs and went forth to meet the bridegroom and five of them were wise and five were foolish they that were foolish took their lambs and they took no oil and took no oil with them but the wise took all in their vessels with their lamps now while the bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and slept and at midnight there was a cry made behold the bridegroom cometh go ye out to meet him now that is the message of the hour right now amen that is the message that brother Brandon set right there in verse 6 then all those versions they Rose and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said unto the wise give us of your oil for our Lambs are gone out now this is real important here a lamp can't go out unless it was on so it was burning at one time something was making that burn but the wise answer now the reason I'm saying this is because Satan has tricked a lot of people thinking they have enough to make it we don't want to sink under that delusion and I understand that we need Faith but what we need more is to have a heart that says God fill me so full of you that there is absolutely no question I am burning for you I'm winning souls for you yes sir amen but the wise answer is saying not Soul lest there be not enough for us and you but go ye rather to them that sell and buy for yourselves while they went to buy the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him with him to the marriage and the door was shut kind of like in the boat right in in the with uh no one the ark and preaching for 120 years and and finally God shut the door and it's going to happen with the Rapture the same way and afterwards came also the other virgin saying Lord open the door to us and he answered and said verily I say unto you I know you not and so he ends this Parable by saying watch therefore for ye know neither the day nor the hour we're in the son of man cometh now I believe that all of us would like to know when the coming of the Lord is I mean there have been preachers since brother random has left that has expressed when he's coming and when they didn't come to that day there was other ministers that rolls up and said he's coming at this date and people like to say what they feel what they think because they like a gathering they like people to to follow them to to look up to them but you know God don't want us to know but what he does want us to do is put our attention and making sure we're ready and not taking the bait that Satan offers us of oh don't worry you're ready don't worry you're ready many will come to me in that day I don't want to be part of that and I'm not saying any of you are that what I'm saying is we don't want to listen to the devil we want to expose the devil want to call them out now There Were Ten virgins in all of these were virgins meaning they were all clean living Christians they lived pure lives and all of them were on their way to meet the Lord Brother Bradham said they all preached the second coming of Christ his sacrifice in the atonement brother Branham alert to the the fact that the two Spirits were so close that it deceived everyone but the elected and he talked about those two the two spirits of those virgins were so close right brother Brandon compared it to a woman making a dress out of a a material and you sisters that have made dresses you go buy a big uh amount of grass that you need and you lay your pattern on it and you cut out what you need and you sew it together to make your dress are you with me all right we just need to say a little bit more amens because if not I'm gonna go sit there I'm gonna come back and say Amen I'm gonna so now the dress is made with this material what's left over are the remnants it is the same material but it has not been chosen it has not been elected it has not been predestinated but yet it's the same material so what are we looking at when we look at our lives and we say I'm predestinated I'm elected I'm chosen what are we looking at are we looking at that we're in the message and this is the way that I've been taught I've been taught to say I'm elected I'm taught to say I'm chosen I'm not trying to dischristianize anybody here I'm trying to provoke us to dig dig dig dig that's my motive that's where I'm at what separated them was the oil well you know that's the Holy Ghost the five that were foolish fought they had enough of God in their lives to make a rapture that's the truth they did but it was a trick of Satan it's a trick of Satan to get Believers to feel that they have enough to make it the foolish versions were deceived and are deceived in this age when it's happening they never recognize the devil in his tricks and if you don't recognize the devil trying to trick you you'll never be able to defeat him brother Gideon sent me a quote yesterday in the message he just how can I overcome and he says brother Brandon says overcome means to recognize the devil in every one of his tricks I responded back by saying without recognizing you can't annihilate them the last thing we want and we know our greatest enemies ourself right the last thing we want is the devil tricking us you know the you don't even have to be a believer in the devil teaches you to to look at to look at evil in somebody else you don't have to be in the message you don't have to be in the church but to recognize the devil and yourself takes a real spiritual humility the foolish versions they never overcame they never overcame Revelations 12 11 and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb by the word of their testimony they love not their lives unto death three things here brother Brown says the token must be applied it isn't just I Believe In The Blood I believe in Calvary but that life has to come upon back on the believer to overcome in this age and by the word of their testimony the testimony of the Bride will be the word the word the word the word their testimony is the word nothing else just the word because that's the only thing we can over and number three and they love not their lives unto death that is the hardest one that's getting up in the morning and meeting business when you say Lord I'm sick of my life I want you today but that's what it takes to overcome John 5 4 says and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith so it takes faith in all three of those things Faith to apply the Life of Christ to you Faith to take this word to believe what this word says about you more than how you feel about yourself it takes Faith to do that it takes Faith to lay your life down because how many times do we entertain the thought this isn't worth it nothing's going to change so it takes Faith this is the victory that overcometh Authority even our faith so half of the virgins thought they could make it with what Holy Ghost they had because they were clean living believers so what makes you better than me brother Brandon share something in questions and answers number four and 64. question came to brother and brother Branham is it possible for a person to be lost and end up in hell if he rejects the light of the word even though he has had a genuine experience of justification and sanctification brother Branham told us that justification and sanctification is a part of the Holy Ghost so the question is asked to brother Branham if a man has a genuine experience he's Justified a genuine experience he's been Sanctified can he still end up in hell let's see what he said yes sir that is exactly right it's just try to keep it real simple here yes that's right that means I must go on I must go on to perfection I must I must admit that what I have done is not enough and that if he gives me another day to get more of him I should seek it because a person has been Justified has a portion of the Holy Ghost or else he would have never repented right because it's the goodness of God that leads man to repent it's the same thing with saying these virgins were Sanctified they lived clean lives but they still missed it now according to the scriptures half of the virgins thought they could make it with what holy ghosts they had and the other half humbled himself to getting more and more of the Holy Ghost and that's what it takes a spirit of humility we need more Holy Ghost for our journey and we just think about when brother Branham went through those those seals and he talked about the horse riders how each horse rider came out with some deception against the church to knock the church down brother Brian said that God rose up the word to combat that horse and he gave more word to each age well in this age we have the complete word why because we're we're we're in combat with the complete devil on every hand I don't the news media everywhere you just look we're we're wrestling the devil we even come to church and the devil says Ah you don't have to believe that we're facing the devil everywhere we need the whole word of God Jesus said and while the foolish virgins finally humbled themselves to go by the oil the bridegroom came and they that were ready went in with him to the marriage and the door was shut so what's our solution to go buy the oil we got to buy the oil now that doesn't mean we're take up an offering doesn't mean we're in penance it doesn't mean burn candles but what you have to buy it there is no other way to get the Holy Ghost and buy it here is it we understand it's a free gift in other words there is nothing that you could muster up of your own to get it to purchase it but you still buy it and you buy it with your heart you can't get it without your heart he's standing at the door knocking the Holy Ghost wants to come in but you got to let them in you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart come by without money and without price the Bible says amen now was it that the foolish virgins didn't think they had oil they thought they had enough oil they thought they had enough of the Holy Ghost but their own testimony at the end was give us of your oil for our lamps are going out and if you just follow that what that really means is for our lamps are going out so it was in the process of the realization that I didn't quite have enough it was during that moment that time of realization that their lamps was not burning as bright as it should that Jesus came we don't want our labs to go out we want them to keep burning we need to get more oil we need to spend more time really getting down to business when we pray we can spend all day praying about all the things that we want in life or the needs of others that somebody asks us to pray about the needs in their life but we do need to spend some time praying about getting more Holy Ghost any man that's filled with the Holy Ghost have you ever met did brother Brandon say no wait a minute I have enough Holy Ghost don't do I do not need any more a man that's full of the Holy Ghost is not going to say I have enough you can't have enough of God but a man that doesn't have enough Holy Ghost he might fight you say don't you tell me that I have enough who are you to tell me now I'm telling you this is not for me to tell you this is this message is for you to get serious and ask God Amen man lean towards the air of getting more of God now the anointing is what keeps you burning oil sitting there doing nothing does nothing it's when it's burning that it gives light The Living Word it's what needs to be happening in our life Jesus said my words are spirit and their life but the word also says the letter killeth right and the spirit giveth life so what we're looking for is the anointing of the word that's what keeps your lamp burning amen it is what keeps you on fire for God is what keeps you away from when I went to church I did my duty I read the Bible I prayed today and I'm going to go do what I want to do it is that anointing that keeps you away from that the anointing of the Holy Ghost is the word for this hour amen or else Jesus wanted to send it to us Jesus is an I am God he's the same yesterday team forever and he sent the message behold the bridegroom cometh to get us ready I'll tell you what really really provoked this is that in my heart I have felt that we are not digging into this message enough we can't rely on a five-fold Ministry just to come and give us what we should be doing yes we want a five-fold Ministry and yeah they need to be preaching that message here or they shouldn't be here but we need to be digging into what's being spoken into what the prophet is taught because it's in that that gets us ready to not the prophet say rapturing faith lies in those tapes so we need to get in there yes sir the requirement of being ready with enough oil enough anointed oil to keep you on fire for God not well I'm saved I'm Justified I believe that I'm going to message Church and all the other things that the enemy tells us God's anointing is never going to come upon you to make you relax brother sister yeah I'm not saying God won't give you a revelation to give you security and to get make sure you have that peace of God Sherry will but he's never going to tell you something to make you relax that's another spirit we need to be on fire we need to be burning and if that's not happening check what's speaking to you because there's Impostors I want to take a look at the identification of being ready and number one is we need all the truth we need all the truth Jesus said when the Holy Ghost comes and starts dealing with you it's going to get all the world out of you right it's it's gonna it's gonna speak of the the things that's happening and and rebuke it out of your life and and separate you from the things of the world and he that loves the world the love of God can't be in them so he's going to get that out of there and when he the spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth so we we need all truth to be ready it's we're not living in Luther's age where we only need a part we need the truth living in US amen not just the knowledge of all the truth but we need it living in US according to Ephesians 5 27 God is going to present himself a glorious Church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish well you don't have to look very far to see blemishes right amen and yes we have the blood of Christ but we should also be pressing now we need number three we need to manifest His image Romans 8 29 for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren beloved now are we the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he show up here we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is Romans 8 tells us the whole creation is groaning and travailing in pain together until now for the earnest expectation of the creation waited for the manifestation of the sons of God so God is waiting for something the angels are waiting for some the whole creation of God is waiting for something to happen to us amen now Jesus didn't say I'll make you ready Jesus said be ready there's a part for us to play now I know I cannot create I do not have the power to speak the spoken word I cannot create squirrels to run down here jump up here go over there I do not have that brother Brandon said when he spoke of that he said notice that was me I never he said that was not me that said that he said God told me to do that was his will there's certain things we cannot do to change us that's the quick and you know the Holy Spirit but there are things that we can do like humble ourselves before the Lord get serious with God dig into the message say God I hunger I thirst for you if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and call on the Lord then I shall hear from heaven there is something we can do and I think if that's that part that God is looking for us to do they that hunger and thirst for righteousness shall be filled they that keep asking keep seeking keep knocking God will give more Holy Ghost if you want it but if you're content with where you're at notice what you're identifying yourself as whoa are you coming back to the services next Sunday just wanted to make I don't know if you're coming back to the anniversary Services we're having now the requirements that are ready hidden in the scriptures Jesus says search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life but they are they that testify me but it took a seventh age messenger to open the scriptures to us it took the Malik the ministry of Malachi for the ministry of Elijah to restore us back to the original word now without the message of the hour I'll say this we cannot be ready for a Rapture in this age it's the truth we must receive the life of the message now in the inside of us not the knowledge but but the life of the message we must receive the life of the message this message will preserve you unto the coming of the Lord [Music] now you couldn't you couldn't make it in the rapture in Luther's time if you did not receive the message the just shall live by faith amen amen you had to receive the message of the hour then and that's that was the message they're going to come up in the Rapture like we are we're going to be in the same Rapture together but we we've been blessed because God put us in this age brother Brian says there's no other there's no greater age to live in than this age because we have all the truth but too much is given much is required John Wesley's message the same you had to live a Sanctified life it was the expansion of the missionary work and it's really no different in this age that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever we must receive Christ's inner life to be the same as when he walked on the Earth brother Brandon said in the message end time evangelism he said the end time message is to get the bride ready and prepared for the rapture can't be any more plain than that Revelations 10 7 but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin the sound the mystery of God should be finished if he had declared to his servants of the prophets we're not looking for anything else we don't need any more knowledge we're not looking for something new to come we're not even looking for ministers to get up here and give us anything new and if that ever happens be careful they're to dig down and pull out the Nuggets of what was said out here that's what they're to do is it okay if I quote a lot of quotes here evening the evening messenger brother Brandon says notice the evening messenger his job will to will be to get the Saints ready they're bride ready for the bridegroom that will be his message now do you want to learn your ABCs so you can go study algebra later he asked the question do you want to learn these simple things that we that we're talking about so you can go on to do the algebra and then he describes the algebra what these other seals on the back is open the they'll only be revealed to them thank you if you do not take and start putting everything into what God has already shown you we call them ABCs brother Branham says you're not going to be able to receive the revelation of the algebra and we need the whole word to make it that's why I'm digging into these quotes So you can hear it from the prophet he said that's right when these other seals on the on the back is open there'll only be revealed to them that's right so learn your able ABC's first what is an ABC always believe Christ see believe what he says not what somebody else says United Signing Time United time and sign brother Brandon said but there's one little thing that's lacking in the church and he's referring to the uniting of the church with the word now the uniting time is at hand for God is getting the church together to be raptured to go into the wedding for the great Union but God and man will unite together when creatures of time Unite with the Eternal it was once done in the form of the son of man on Earth and he had to give his life to bring about a power to unite other men with the same power for the Bride of Jesus Christ I was referring to the Holy Ghost now and now the church is uniting itself to the body of Christ so it it's got itself free cut away from every little freder getting itself ready getting together uniting among them all a love and a joy and the Holy Spirit moving among them oh my what a time now that is what we should be seeing in our life a love and a joy and a holy spirit moving amongst us and if it ain't happening in our heart it's hard to be happening in our manifestation the invisible Union of the bride of Christ brothers and that's my message to you Church you that's a union a spiritual union by the word by the word is how we become Unified and you're dead to your old husband you're born Anew don't try to dig them up he's dead if you're born again Christian that little germ that was predestined to you it's word coming on word on word on word on word and come into the full statue of Christ that's right so he can get his bride so he can come down and get his bride now we're just ready for one thing that's the coming of the Lord the last thing we need to do is become United with the word all the word now you understand that what I'm speaking of the people that are in the flesh people that are in the the carnal churches out there they do not understand that statement because they already feel they're United with Christ when they repented and got baptized they washed their hands of anything else they got the most important thing done and they're comparing themselves with somebody who hasn't and we need to we need to look at our life every time we read something every time we hear brother Brandon say something every time a minister sits behind stands behind this pulpit and gives us the word we need to take the time to to to look at our lives and see if our life is lining up with that word we need to unite with the word word word word word not I I am I am I am there's no there's you're you're proving which version you are like that I'm not judging but look Jesus did say you'll know them by their fruits so if that ain't the fruit tell me what the fruit is I mean we can see the extremes right we can see the extremes but brother Ryan said those two Spirits would be so close amen that there's only one group of people not everybody in the church is going to know it used to be when they came into this message and I learned about this message in brother Johnson's church I tell you I used to think the foolish virgins were all in the denominations but you know they came out of mixed multitude just like they did out of Egypt and they're really sitting in the messages and I don't mean around but some of our children that were raising they're not being raised in the message not the way the message taught he said there is your name in The Book of Life there's your name in The Book of Life this really shocked me he said the Book of Life is the word of God why think about that book that's out there that's right hoping our name is in that just take this book and put your name in this book because if you see it here it'll be there but if you can't see it here we don't want to hope that it's there are you with me because the word is God and God is the only thing that is life so your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible became become unward and if you're here to do that won't it won't it be Vindicated word won't the church vindicate itself won't Malachi 4 and all these things be Vindicated so there is a vindication there is a Vindication for us for us all right Matthew 24 turn with me here is all right if I if you give me some some extra time today I mean I I did I did you know send all those preachers this way when I was gone so give me a little time uh because I won't be preaching this is I think maybe I got one service next Sunday to preach and that's it we got just visiting ministers coming Matthew 24 verse 42 watch watch that really means to be vigilant or to keep awake therefore watch therefore for you know not what hour your Lord come and know this that the good man of the house had known in what watch the thief were to come he would have watched and would not have suffered his house to be broken up therefore be also ready for in such an hours you think not the son of man cometh who then is a faithful and a wise servant who then is a faithful and a wife serve that's the question whom his Lord have made him rule over his household to give them meat in due season okay who are you who are you you are a soul brother by Adam where does your soul live inside of your body now you have to feed your soul you have to give your soul spiritual meat in due season and you have to be faithful to do that men look at these scriptures here who the who is his whom his Lord had made him rule over his household to give him meet them meet in due season now this is a faithful and a wise servant to me a faithful and a wise servant he is digging in that word he's applying himself into the word you don't have to be behind the pulpit to get in love with the word amen amen blessed is that servant whom his Lord when he cometh shall find Soul doing he's given us he's given us a clue what it means to be ready verily I say unto you that he shall make him ruler over all his Goods but but and if that evil servant shall say in his heart and there's no need to do that because he's not coming tomorrow it's delayed a little bit okay see how tricky that is we would not just come out and say those words but that spirit and those thoughts can get on us and shall begin to Smite his fellow servants and to eat and drink with a drunkard no wonder God wants us to love one another to be filled with the love of God to forgive one another to to wash one another's feet to care about one another to take an opportunity when somebody smikes you on the face to love them back to turn a cheek because as soon as I don't need to do that and you can Smite a fellow servant you know with your thoughts just your thoughts and today I don't need to be any better that's eating and drinking with the drunkard the Lord of that servant shall come in a day when he looked not for him and in an hour that you that he is not aware of I'll tell you if we knew the Lord was coming five days ago or today where we have done what we did the last two days think about that statement so it's a different way of thinking and she'll cut him asunder and appoint him his portion with the Hypocrites there shall be weeping and gnashing the teeth and brother Branham taught us that's the tribulation amen all right first Thessalonians chapter five first lesson chapter five but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourself know perfectly that the day of the Lord so cometh as a thief in the night he's not a thief but he comes as a thief he doesn't tell anybody and when they shall say peace and safety everything's going to be okay then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail on a woman with child and there and they shall not Escape but ye Brethren are not in darkness that that they should overtake you as a thief ye are all the children of light and the children of the day and we are not the of the night nor the darkness therefore let us not sleep as do others but let us watch let's be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and day they'll be drunken or drunken in the night but let us now that are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of faith and love for the helmet the hope of salvation for God have not appointed us to Wrath but until to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ who died for us whether we wake or sleep we should live together with him we're for Comfort yourselves together and edify one another even as you do so I'll say it like this hey let's do some more and some more edifying come on amen let's do some more edifying there's a lot of things we can talk about a lot of things we can share but let's satisfy one another we need to help get one another ready for the rapture all right now what measuring stick are we using to see if we're ready for a Rapture I wanna I want I want us to ask that question what measuring stick are we using brother Brandon said in the Israel and the church he said that the five foolish versions were a clean living people they didn't go to dances they didn't go to shows they didn't smolt they didn't drink they went to church they shouted they jumped they spoke in tongues but it's not any fleshly demonstration or emotion he said he said that's not the answer he said there must be a supernatural change in the whole nature a supernatural change in the whole nature so I know I've been changed a little bit but I'd only be foolish to say I've changed completely so now that thought just puts me in a sober state to dig in a sober state to you know press in towards the the mark let me just say this if Jesus doesn't tell anybody when he's coming there's a reason for it there's a reason that a prophet after surrendering his life to God and the road to Damascus and once churched out the thing and and repented got baptized and said okay I see now that after 33 years of his life he was still pressing in there's a reason that that's there and during his pressing in he was still reaching out still given the gospel out still trying to win souls he was he was trying to become all things to all men that he might win some now I understand there's going to be more people that hurt you and use you don't listen to you than ever help you that's just the way of Christianity you can't do nothing about that Paul knew that but he still said I become all things to all men that I might just win some brother Brandon said there's going to be a separation and God will separate the lukewarm church member that is only impersonating Christianity he said the lukewarm church member is only impersonating Christianity the sun secret going away of the church brother and said virgin means Purity they were all good people every one of them virgins Sanctified vessels of God people that you couldn't put your finger on for anything wrong wow they every one of them believed in the coming of the Lord they were ready to go meet him but some of them let their oil get out they had oil they let their oil get out that's why we need to keep getting oil it's awful quiet in here I'm just reading the quotes don't let that be your case keep oil on your lamp oil is the spirit the Holy Spirit never let it drain from you when you feel your love dying away your sincerity to Christ and to the cause quickly go to him who has the Fountain of oil and buy for yourself a filling of the Holy Ghost I just love that he gave me a track to run on handwriting on the wall brother and said in five were still virgins but but we're foolish virgins he said they didn't keep oil in their land the sudden secret going away at the church for the brand also went on to see be also ready according Jesus for you know not what minute or hour your lord does come be ready for you can't get ready then you can't get ready then he said you could not so in other words ready or not here I come oh my now I want you to know um I I just have to skip a lot but I can't skip at all but I will say this if you dig into that message you'll see these things in the patna's vision brother Ram says now I want to ask you something I'm speaking to the lukewarm Church where the Bible says where if the righteous will scarcely be saved where will the Sinner and the ungodly person appear the one who rejects who knows better and then rejects it where will he appear he says his feet like brass Divine judgment he says all right The Voice we heard about following the voice right following the way of the lord The Voice from from Brother Daniel what a horrible thing for a drifting soul on this sea of life no pilot to guide them loose floating with the ties to hear the Roar of the great cataracts The Falls what a horrible thing it would be for to a soul drifting the voice of many Waters brother John why are you reading that because I want us to get to this what is The Voice it's the judgment the voice of ministers through the Holy Spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many Waters Cried Out thickness and multitude the voice of those seven stars in the hand to every Church age preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost the baptism in Jesus name speak in tongues the power of God the resurrection of Christ the second coming Divine judgment the voice of many Waters came forth from this one that looked like the son of man many Waters what it'll be to know that you sit in you sat in the meetings and heard that you should get right with God and receive the Holy Spirit and a drifting soul to hear that voice speak out in the meetings that you sat in and heard the judgments of God preached and refused it the great fall is just below you the great cataracts it'll take you to the Eternal Doom the voice of many Waters when we come to church and we hear ministers stand behind the pulpit and preach to us in that Prophet when we listen to the tapes it is the Divine Judgment of God to the to the bride it is the Divine Judgment of God to the bride because that is her white Throne judgment she takes the word and corrects herself willingly through three more agency see it isn't to the foolish virgin it isn't to everybody else they get the white Throne judgment afterwards and brother Adam says they'll hear the same words come back and Echo them it's a privilege for us to to allow ourselves to be judged by the word of God today and every time we come to church it's an honor to be washed by the word now brother Graham said no matter what the Bradham Tabernacle ever turns out to be he says don't you let it be you the message wasn't Bradham Tabernacle the the message wasn't what the people that were closest to brother Brandon what they thought the message was the message is what brother ran and brought he says don't let it be you you be a servant of Christ no matter what their Church does you be a servant of Christ it's not up to Brandon Tab and I go neither is it up to any other church it's up to you as an individual to be ready at the coming of the Lord you must be ready I must be ready I'll sweep my own steps it's up to you to sweep your own steps leave mine alone me leave yours alone you've got to make your garment ready see we must the first thing we must do is we must identify that spirit that tells us uh you don't have nothing to do that message for somebody else you've got to identify that because if you you you listen to that thing you won't be trying any more than you have been this message was sent to stir us and I know it's not an Evangelistic message and I don't want you to be stirred for a little bit and leave and then I want it to be real to you next week next month and keep it going until the coming of the Lord amen my my all right I'm on your side I'm not reading a lot of the stuff but I want you to know that I did spend a lot of time studying for you uh I got to I got to read this and the conflict between God and Satan brother Brandon said fire is the confirmation of the light coming from the word so when we're burning it's a confirmation that the light from the word has come to you the smart version the wise virgin had oil in her lamp she trimmed her lamp and lit it now what is it God is the word the oil is the spirit and the fire is the gospel lit on the oil the fire is the gospel lit on the oil God said so that's the vessel all right the oil is in the vessel and the fire is burning it it shows that it's reflecting the light of what's what of what the word said that's the reflection now the wise virgin could do that but the other the foolish version was on the outside they had no aisle no oil and they couldn't reflect nothing but the church we're all reflecting you can't project something you can't get warm by a pain in fire right you can only project what's on the inside the true bride must be United by the word now remember if she's part of Christ she has to be the word of Christ has to be has to be and I'm just going to read a few more of these is that okay all right thank you for your patience with me in the message of the Rapture this is basically the last month of brother branham's uh one of his last message in in November of army December of 65. he says if you're in Christ there's not a word written in here but what you believe it I don't care what anybody else said and then God makes that thing manifested in other words if you truly believe the word it will become manifest in your life because you when he pours the spirit upon the word what happens it's like putting water on any other seed it'll live it'll bring forth of its kind now you say I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he says that don't mean that you're saved not by a long ways this is the last last month of his life he just preached the minute his his message and he says by you saying I got the baptism of the Holy Ghost that doesn't mean that you're saved not by a long ways he looky here he says you're a Triune being you are inside this little fella in here is a soul the next is the spirit and the next is the body now you got the five senses of the body to contact the Earthly home they don't contact the rest you've got five senses of the spirit here love conscious and so forth of that but here is where you live that's where you are didn't Jesus say the rain falls on the just and the unjust you put a cockapoo out there and a weed out there and pour water in them and keep them under the fertilizer and things like that won't they both live by the same water well sure what is it one of them because that's all it is the cockerborough will raise his hands and shout and just the same as the wheat unless that was God's seed his Gene from the beginning predestinated you're finished I don't care how much you shout speak in tongues run shout and that doesn't have anything to do with it now this is what he said I want to get to this he said it's your heart in that word it's your heart in that word that's Christ bring in there and watch it make itself known as it opens up like any other seed and declares itself for the agent that is living in oh my isn't that beautiful he said Esther purged her heart before God and you can stand up if you want to stand up Esther purged her heart before God walked up with a Meek and humble spirit the church that's going to be the bride of Christ now remember Esther refused the worldly adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king it's a sweet kind reverent Spirit to the word of God Washed by the Water of the word and that word's in you it's washing amen the church needs a washing a Full Gospel washing that's right not just a part washing but a Full Gospel washing clean up made new creatures in Christ Jesus now God don't look at members he's hunting character and that's what he places his word in somebody that'll believe him as I said the other night Eliezer squatted it out to till he found character for the bride uh for the bride that he had to make her stand still in order to get her dressed to meet the one they were talking about remember when brother Branham had that vision and he saw the bride get out of line remember that praise the Lord now to keep the things cool for uh for the for the hot people and he screamed out get back in line amen now he wasn't saying you're not bride he was speaking to the bride that got out of line and he screamed back get back in line this message when ministers come and are preaching this same message get back in line get back to where God has shown you because the devil is constantly drawing us away we have a message to get us ready and it's up to us the bride have his wife have made herself ready I can't do that for you the fivefold ministry can't do that for you they can present you with what God speaks to you but unless you believe it is personally for you and take it into your life and that you're serious with it it can't get you ready so may the Lord just Lift us up with a determination to ask for more of the Holy Ghost you don't got to do it right now and come to the Altar and you know make this decision I want you to just make this your life every day spend time at home seek the Holy Ghost I'll tell you it'll create such a hunger you can't wait to get to church amen amen let's just bow ourselves in a word of prayer before we sing a few courses I just wonder there be anybody in here that want to be remembered in prayer as we go before the Lord just God bless these hands God sees your heart amen amen so wonderful Lord we just thank you for the many hands that were lifted almost all hands Lord God I want to thank you for that still Small Voice that is speaking to our hearts Laura thank you for calling this to you

message and Lord we want to thank you for sending the seventh angel and thank you for bringing somebody by in our life to bring us the message or that we could hear it and now Lord we just thank you

in prayer for the some more special services coming up and uh we're always always good to have brother uh Daryl with us he's just a such a fine fine-spirited uh brother and I just love him I love them so much and let's pray uh for not only the services and the ministry and US hearing it to receive Revelation but would you pray with me for new Souls I got a commitment for one family amen I'm hoping for another and I got a neighbor that I want to see come and so if we all just do our part the part that Christ has asked us to do and to to to bring them up to go out bring them in give them a chance to hear the gospel because brother Daryl give us the gospel and give them a chance to be saved your laborers just to get a one Soul ten thousand worlds so let's be in special prayer for those people that are becoming to these Services we not only want revelation but we want them to receive it too I want to say I appreciate my wife you know I I hear that brother Paul calls his wife the eighth wonder of the world so but she is a wonder and she's a Wonder to me I wouldn't be here without her and I said honestly unless you're a pastor and I think there's one here unless you're a pastor you do not understand the pressure on a pastor you don't is it different than any of the other uh of course the prophet had a tremendous nothing compared to what the prophet went through but there are so many attacks so many burdens so many things that is required and she is literally giving up her life for me to be able to serve that's exactly what's happened and it whatever she asked me to do and I tell her this all the time it's a nun or whatever she asks but it doesn't even come close to what she deserves now I do believe that she has a reward coming on the other side God is Not forgetful to forget our labor of love is that right amen and I I failed to say at the beginning but I haven't failed to think about it throughout the service it's such a blessing to have brother and sister Johnson it's always a blessing to have brother and sister Johnson we love you so very much and just appreciate all that you have done for us for the kingdom of God and oh the half hasn't been told the eighth hasn't been told and what's beautiful about when you when you you save Souls right because brother Johnson has saved Souls they that save Soul they that win souls is wise right and what happens is that Soul now goes and tells another Soul so you're attached to people you don't even know and we just appreciate so much brother and sister Johnson amen amen if it's if it's okay and I just if it's okay to announce it I Brother Bruce would you be able to minister on Wednesday for us amen amen amen all right and so the reason I wanted to say it like that is I wanted all of us to know I was going to talk to him after the service but then you know we all wouldn't know but now that we know we can be praying for him and I know he'd appreciate that amen I wouldn't have said that if I didn't feel you would just so you know I respect you amen amen um all right so all Hearts clear amen praise the Lord let's be in prayer for sister Linda Helms let's be in prayer for the wensley family let's be in
