what you needed financially to take care of all your needs I mean every day they just came to your door gave you the money well you would you wouldn't just say I can't come to the door leave it there you would Express thankfulness and God gives us mercies and I believe he wants to hear how thankful we are first mercies amen amen well God bless you let's turn to the Book of Matthew chapter 15 and as you're turning there wanted to make mention um that we have the calendars out there's just been so much going on that we forgot to get the calendars out last month but there's three calendars out there that you can take a a few of each and share them with others and when those run out we have more in the back so I would say use them as a tool to invite somebody to church that's what they're there for and I hope that they'll be a blessing every year for many years brother Bill Sanchez many of you know him he always contacts us and says can you send out some more of those calendars to our church so their Church receives about 40 or 50 of them and they just love them uh just nice having a scripture for the day and I'll say it's good to be back in the house of the Lord amen amen Matthew chapter 15 before we begin reading let's just ask God to to bless this word and help us to to receive it amen Heavenly Father we are humans uh with the capabilities of just missing you false and failures and misunderstandings and Lord we're not uh we're not even smart lord and if we were smart it would not be uh the the intelligence of God the wisdom of God and Lord as we stand here's a body of Believers we're confessing that we are not uh capable of receiving uh the the Revelation without you giving it Lord we can't figure it out on our own and we're asking today that you prepare our hearts our minds our thoughts just take control of the atmosphere here take control of the atmosphere of our very being Lord our our Triune being our body our soul and our spirit just bring in our subjection to you and and help us to catch what you have for us today father that we could leave here a better better Christians Lord better people that we may serve you in the way that would be most pleasing father we ask that you be with those that could not be here today uh Lord those each and every one for various needs we just ask that your spirit would be with them that you would Supply every need father and we commit them to you that you give them the word of life as well father we love you we thank you for these things and we ask them in Jesus Christ's name amen amen Matthew chapter 15 starting with verse number one then came to Jesus scribes and Pharisees which were of Jerusalem saying why do thy disciples transgress the tradition of the elders for they wash not their hands when they eat bread but he answered and said unto them why do you also transgress the Commandment of God by your tradition for God commanded saying honor thy father and mother and he that curseth father or mother let him die the death but ye say whosoever shall say to his father or his mother I am a gift by whatsoever thou mayest be profited by me and on Earth not his father or his mother he shall be free thus have he made the Commandment of God of none effect by your tradition ye Hypocrites well did Isaiah's prophesy of you saying this people drawth nigh unto me with their mouth he honored me with their lips but their heart is far from me in vain they do worship me teaching for doctrines the Commandments of men amen God bless you may God add the his Revelation to the word to our hearts today we uh you may be seated you may be seated um I'm thinking this won't be a typical service but that's okay that's okay I think that last song that we we were singing there when I look into your Holiness was like the perfect song to for for this coming into this uh uh the word here today because we want to take our text there from verse number eight this people draw nine to me with their mouth and honored with me with their lips but their heart is far from me so we're going to be getting a little it's not a deep subject it's just a subject we don't think about very much so the these people even though they were drawing nigh to God they came to church they were drawing now to God with their mouth they were worshiping but their heart was in a different location so we can we can honor the Lord with songs with praises yet our heart may not be all the way in it and Jesus called this type of worship Vain and hypocritical Jesus often discerned those believers who acted religious but they really weren't in love with God they they were in love with the word and Jesus brought a clear teaching on the sin that really starts in the heart of man and not on the outside brother Branham had taught us that those were just attributes of unbelief but but truly it all uh sin starts in the heart when we disbelieve um in God's perfect will amen what I want to take away from these scriptures here is that we can be there can be a separation between saying things and doing things and what's really going on inside of us and uh even from an early age children learn to hide uh uh hide their feelings hide what they're doing uh they don't you know want to get caught um and there are various reasons that we hide things often people fear what others might say or do if they knew their true thoughts or fear what others might think of them and fear often motivates people to hide how they really feel so we just kind of build this shell around us an example of that is if a person was being judged uh if a person was going to be judgmental towards somebody like I don't feel that what they did was of the Lord was right but you know I'm not going to say anything I'm not going to do anything because I don't want them to think something different of me but you don't have a problem saying it to somebody else see it's a pretense or someone really doesn't care about somebody but you don't want that person to know about it when you're talking to them you can say there's many reasons for people not to be genuine with others and be no different than coming into church and acting differently when our heart really wasn't there are you with me that's what what happened here in these scriptures so I'd like to title this message this morning mixed motives and for a subject thought why do we do what we do so I just want to provoke us to be thinking about something that we don't often do and that's checking our emotives or thinking that our motives are okay um like it doesn't matter what's Happening Here because what's going on here is between me and God or me and myself and what I just play out here is between me and another person and yeah it's not right these people had enough desire for God to go to church to worship to express themselves outwardly to God but they had a greater desire inside their heart for something different a lot of times we find ourselves doing things because oh it's because it's Sunday we got to do it we got to go to church we got to read our Bible got to pray got you got got you got to say sorry oh sorry right but the heart isn't there so it they had a desire to go to church they had a desire to worship but their heart was somewhere else we can see that there could there's two motives there there's a mixed motives they were out in the bar they came to church they worshiped but their heart wasn't where their worship was you know it's okay if you get into the message it'll help us to get just a little bit more out of it now here I want to say this all we want to do today is we want to break down looking at our motives more we want to leave here understanding that it is really important to check our motives which we don't do very often why because every man is right in his own eyes and if every man's right in his own eyes why would he have a need to check his motive but it's not true our motives can be mixed because our desires can be mixed I'm doing this because but what are the other reasons you're doing this see the mixed motives here remember the angel of the Lord telling brother Brandon to remind the people that their thoughts that their their thoughts speak louder in heaven than their words do here on the Earth so God is you know no matter what we're saying outwardly here God is really zooming in on the heart right if Satan can get us to mix our motives now notice this to mix our motives things will become unclear to what's really going on inside of us see Satan is the author of confusion and he don't really want you to know when your heart is wrong he don't want you to know when when something isn't just right there because then there's a chance that you'll repent and get right so he wants it to kind of stay in a mixed state of just um a little this a little that and nobody really knows and the thing is you're not right and and Satan don't want you to know that he wants you to feel you know why why is every man right in his own eyes because that's the nature he's born with if a little child wants a cookie and and mama says uh don't take the cookie and he takes the cookie and Mom said did you take the cookie and he says no I didn't take the cookie that that boy no matter how much if you'll a long period of time of that happening that boy will literally think or that girl will actually think they're right taking that cookie because something inside of him says they want the cookie what they want is right and that's what can happen to any of our consciences when we be when we begin to not be honest with what's going on inside of us we can become just uh uh so away from the realness of what actually Things Are now when there are two or more motives for doing something things will often Cloud the true reason of why we're doing things ever been asked why are you doing this and you give the reason that's acceptable to the person that you're talking to but there's another reason inside that you're really doing it are you with me okay who's excited for the word the word is going to help us we can just focus on the on the one that seems to be more favorable for us at the time but God always knows our true motives for things yeah now our motives need to be one one motive I'm saying this there could be many reasons of why this you're doing this and how it could benefit so on and so forth but there needs to be one motive it needs to be clear it needs to be decisive it needs to be direct none of this mix motives mixed Motors makes it hard I'm giving you this birthday gift this Christmas gift this gift because well look it when you receive a gift you want to know that that gift is for one reason because you're being loved somebody wants to give to you that is it no other reason obviously these people that were worshiping God I need to stay here because everything's not perfect yet um these people thought they were doing adequate for God in their worshiping coming to church and what they were doing kind of going through the motions they weren't concerned that their heart wasn't in the right place they weren't concerned that their motive wasn't in the right place our motives are very important they are the true desire of what's going on inside of us the definition of motive is a reason for doing something especially one that is hidden or not obvious so when we think you know what's the person's motive I mean if you you see somebody that they're going to rob a bank you know what their motive is they want the money it could be for different reasons but then there's things where you know people walk in the bank and before they rob the bank they're acting like they're just you know normal people until everybody gets set and everybody's in their position and they pull out their guns okay motives are not always right they're not always good the definition of objective is something towards which effort is being directed something toward which effort is being directed in AIM a goal and end of an action a strategy position to attain or a purpose to achieve so you know if this guy loses that'll get this guy in you understand it's that strategy I'm probably not going to be well liked after this message but that's okay I want to get us closer to God and you can be doing the right thing and have absolutely the wrong motive here's the biggest thing it looks like you know we're coming across a certain way or but really because our motive is wrong the motive has to be pure it has to be right if the devil can get us to have a wrong motive and do the right thing he has succeeded because somewhere it's going to come back and come out and just you know totally show that it wasn't love in her heart that was actually doing it if the motive is wrong you're right doesn't count in the sight of God that's remember that if your motive is wrong your right doesn't count in the sight of God it it it means nothing this is why it's so important that our motives are right it would be better if we did less good and our motives were more good come on because it's not about pleasing people not about pleasing family it's not about pleasing you know it's not about being men Pleasers and it's not about you know showing something even in in the church if I could say it like this these people were they didn't mind praying they didn't mind fasting they didn't mind this is what I'm doing for God that in my worshiping but their heart was in a different place right they were having Church Without God and not saying that any of us are doing that but we can I'm sure we've been guilty of it I'm sure we've been guilty of it but uh I'm not just I'm not preaching this because I feel that there's you know two people in here or five people or whatever it might be that's that's doing this it's not this the motive for this thing is because we need to start paying attention to our motives if we're really going to grow in Christ if we're going to come to the place that God wants us to be where we're just genuine Christians one to another and and worshiping God in spirit and Truth we've just we've got to be looking at our motives because if we're a human being all of our motives are not right true with me if you would to Luke chapter 3 verse 2. Luke chapter 3 verse 2 . there's a lot of scriptures in the Bible that help us to see these things and oh I don't know how many services we're going to have on this but I want us to be at the end of this I want us to be checking our Motors more ananiacin sapphias being um the high priest the word of God came unto John the son of Zacharias in the wilderness Caiaphas I should say and he came unto all the country about Jordan preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission of sins as it is written in the book of the words of isaiahs the Prophet saying the voice of one crying in the wilderness prepare ye the way of the Lord make his path straight every Valley shall be filled Every Mountain and Hills shall be brought low and the Crooked shall be made straight in the rough ways shall be made smooth and all the flesh shall see the salvation of God now this is you know setting a a a scene here that there's seriousness John is preaching about the baptism of of uh of repentance and and that we need to get ready he's he's going to accomplish something if I could say you know what this place looked like uh before brother Stan was working on it right he was making the the rough places smooth and filling in the holes and and and he was making ready for church today okay so this is John the Baptist was making ready for the coming of the Lord there was a there's a serious situation then said he to the multitude that came to church to be baptized he said oh Generation of Vipers who warned you to flee from the Wrath to come you would think he would be excited about them just get baptized right but he wasn't he was thinking about their motive thinking about the motive of why they wanted to get baptized bring forth therefore fruits worthy of repentance and bring not to say look at within yourself we have Abraham to Our Father for I say unto you that God is able of these stones to raise up children unto Abraham and now also the axes light to the root of the trees every tree therefore which bringeth not for good fruit is hewed down and cast Into the Fire wow you you I don't think he was trying to build a church here I don't think he was trying to build a congregation and a gathering I don't think he was trying to get more people to follow where he was at I think he was giving a direct message from God to the people that your motive is important and our motives need to bring forth fruit right no matter where we're going we got to have fruit and the people answered and the people I asked him saying what shall we do then and he answered and saith so they're asking what kind of fruit are you looking for and he said he that have two coats let him impart to him that have none and he that had meat let him do likewise then came also so that was that was a fruit in other words I'm I'm making a change I'm making a change it's not going to be about me anymore then came also the publicans to be baptized and he said Master what shall we do and he said unto them exact no more than that which is appointed on to you exact no more than that which is appointed you and the soldiers likewise demented him saying and what shall we do and he said unto them do violence to no man neither accuse any falsely and be content with your wages so here John the Baptist is talking about what is really needed if you're going to repent and come to God your life has got to change there's got to be changes in the way that you're no longer in the flesh just doing what you want to make your life better it's not about you when you come to Christ anymore it's about others foreign so what is John getting at here what is the Holy Ghost speaking to these three groups of people repentance is right but without the fruit of turning our life around it's wrong baptism is right but without the fruit of sincerity it's not right brother Madam says you'll just go into the water a sinner and you'll come up a sinner things won't change in your natural life even though you have a desire to be baptized catch this even though you know it's right and even though I could say this even though you know God's pricking at your heart to be baptized it isn't just getting dunked in the water that he's pricking your heart with he's pricking your heart to turn your life around that you can look I don't care what age you are that you can look back three months later and say something is transpired in the last three months yeah yeah amen it's got to keep changing if it's not we're dictating that God is just a god of the Dead and God is a god of the living and he testifies to that every spring obeying the will of God is right but having mixed motives is wrong and always will be so I'll Wonder today if we just took a minute we asked how often is your motive wrong how often is our motive room well we know it's it's a lot more wrong than we realize but the true question is how often do we check our motive if we don't check it we don't check it that's what we're having this service because we don't check it we're still being we're decent we're doing good the footsteps of the righteous to order the Lord all things are working together for the good and you know we just we we roll with those well if we roll with those why did the prophet tell us to check our motives their motive wasn't completely pure maybe as brother uh Marty would say maybe they were just looking for fire insurance they wanted to make sure that when it came time to die they were going to be okay we could say they had a hidden agenda no wonder Jesus said all that ever came before me are thiefs and robbers and a thief comes not but for to steal and who wouldn't want eternal life and do whatever they want to do I mean if you think about it that's kind of what Lucifer hey man we can live just we do our own thing let's just blow this popcorn stand and leave this place do what you want to do and definitely those satanic angels that are following Satan are doing what they want to do but not the angels in heaven they're only doing the will of God amen there's only two Wills that's why we got free more agency we can have any motive we want come on we can have any motor we can go anywhere we want but you know what's really important is that we do the will of God that should be our only motive is the will of God to do the will of God and not just on two or three or four things but you know my will of God for our life there is there are so many things that we come across every day that is the will of God for our life and some we want to put attention to and some we don't but they're all important to God Motors are either selfish or they're totally for the Lord or they're a mixture and they can't be let me give an example you know Mission work is always in the will of the Lord right but it doesn't mean a man working for the Lord doesn't have selfish motives mixed while he's working for the Lord some people really enjoy taking credit for their work some like building their own reputation there are spirits of popularity in this message so here you are doing the will of the Lord and have mixed motives no wonder the prophets said check your motives God doesn't want our Motors mixed but purely the Lord nothing inside our motives for ourself there just can't be our life needs to become all of God that's what the Bible says when a man is Born Again All Things Are of God all of our motives are God if there is anything inside we just need to get rid of it that's what this is about it's about to make an awareness we need to get our our face seeking the Lord and saying Lord help me because God does not want you to come to the full New Birth he doesn't want you to get to the place where you're sold out to God Lock Stock and Barrel he wants you to stay in a place where you got God at your reach here but you can do what you want to do over here our mold is continually be all for the Lord that's why it's so hard to get some people to do things because they simply want to do their own will but brother Byron said if God could just get one man in his hand he turned the world upside down one man he wants to work his will in our lives completely now brother Branham taught us to check her motive a lot of things go wrong in life because we don't check our motives we all probably could stand up and speak for hours about the things that have gone wrong in our lives because our motive was wrong are you with me is it right if I just read some quotes and just this is kind of a Wednesday night thing but you know it just it just on my heart brother Brandon spoken questions and answers 61 the question comes brother Brandon if these questions are out of line then just disregard them and I won't feel bad about it for I'll know it was not in the hand of the Lord it says a real humble man here okay question number one brother random he says I have heard you say that I should be back in the ministry and I have thought upon it myself but have waited upon some definite word from him about it up to date it hasn't come now since I know the end is so near should I still wait for the Lord Jesus to speak to me or would he be pleased to tell you what to tell me since I know you are his spokesman for this day I I think this man was a it was a humble man well no before I got Brothers says now before I no no brother I got wrote down here my answer to it God calling this brother a call in life now there's one great thing we could just take as a text and preach all night on it it's just one thing a calling make your calling an election sure see we don't want to be just wandering if we're called wondering if we're called I'm sorry you must be called or you'll be defeated we're battle we're fighting a battle see and if you are positive sure brother that your calling is of God and you've been called of God to do a work dot dot dot now there is a great trick that the enemy can play on you and they say we all can relate to this we can he can make you think that you're not called when you are called then he can turn around turn right back around make you think that you're not called when you are called either way you have to watch it so he can make you think feel at times that you don't have the Holy Ghost when you got the Holy Ghost can make you think uh just the opposite he wants the devil wants most people to think they got the Holy Ghost because now there's their badge that they don't need to press unto Christ for anything more and it is it is that group of people that did not take an enough oil with them so this is a great trick and the devil can can mix up our motives now here's the way to do it first I'll find out first well now this is advice only thing I can give you is advice make sure that your calling comes from God and then check your motives and objectives see now you know what I mean by that what is your motive for preaching do you think it was an easier job than the one you have now he says then you better forget it because it wasn't a call what does brother Brandon teaching us here he's teaching us to try the spirit to see whether it's of God or not that's what it and this is something we don't we don't practice much of is trying to spirit because we feel that the things that we thoughts we think are okay there's songs that you know the songs that we like are the same ones God listens to in heaven you know we got that that thing that we we're just not wrong we don't want to assume that everything we think is of God many times the devil is trying to trick us into thinking that it's God speaking to us when really it's the devil who puts the thought there was camouflage so he has to give us some good with it right it's the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and it's a mixed tree right and the prophet taught us that if anything that is mixed it will come to death right and it's the same thing with a motive motives can't be just good I mean a lot of times we think well there's nothing wrong with what I'm doing I'm not talking about what's I'm not talking about that I want to know is it the will of God right that's what I want I want to know if it's a perfect will of God because it's our we're told by the scriptures to prove that which is good acceptable and perfect will God there's only one will of God that is acceptable to him and it's a perfect will of God and not to say that God won't use his permissive will but you can't make it into heaven on a permissive will so why flirt with it beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits we're there of God because many false prophets are gone out into the world not just a couple but many all right let's get back to the quote brother man says a call of God he said a call of God Burns so in your heart you can't rest day or night for it he says you just can't get away from it it's just a constant grinding at you and I'll say it's anything Sonia wants to get baptized somebody that that wants to do something for the Lord if it just comes and goes you know that happens all the time all the time but something that's of God you can't let go you can't let it go no matter how much you would run away from it you can't let it go because it's God uh often we think there's a call but we can let it go and then it pops up and then we let it go and then it pops up and let it go but you know it's got to be a burning it's got to be something that it just it takes over your life and it doesn't matter and it doesn't have to be preaching excuse me this does not have to do with preaching but there's so many Ministries and so many things that God wants us to do one for another for people that don't know the Lord sometimes we we care about reaching out to others and we can go weeks and don't even think about others we can go days and I care about a soul and then we don't even think about souls so brother Brandon says a call of God Burns so in your heart you can't rest day and night for it you just can't get away from it it's a constant grinding at you so if it's just a desire you'll get distracted if it's just a desire you'll eventually get distracted if it's a call you can't get rid of it no matter if you try to distract yourself with something different are you with me boy this this is a good solid teaching if I was on that side of the of of the pulpit I would be saying Amen to this now brother Brandon went on to say here in this message right after he said this he says and if you had to preach you say well no another objective is I believe if I could I I if I could be successful evangelist or a pastor and have a good set salary and have a home that I could go to and so forth and live and then I believe that it would be a good thing and much easier than what I'm doing right now he said see your objective is wrong to begin with see it's not right you're wrong there on that so it can't even be if I'm going to be successful if you're going to be a complete failure are you still going to do it eyes God has a whole group of different trees and and birds and a five-fold Ministry everybody is not called to have a church of many thousand yeah and not that only those that have it are the only ones that can do it it's just it's that God's choice it takes a whole heart of humility to check your motives because the flesh doesn't want to do it it's just staring at this one thing one reason I want to look and you want other people to look at why you're wanting to do it for the Rams went on to say then you would say well because I think maybe I'd be more popular amongst the people that's a really really catchy one see to do something for popularity see you'll find out you're just ready for a big flop he said really see now if your objective is that I don't care if I have to eat soda crackers and drink Branch water I'll preach the gospel anyhow in other words there's nothing in it for you that's when you know it's God and you just apply this to anything in your life that you think God wants you to do if you don't get nothing out of it will you still do it something just tearing into you I'll either preach the gospel or I'll die then you'll go somewhere because it's God dealing with you see God making himself known to you because God just won't let you rest and usually a god-cod man never wants to do it anyways he said did you ever think about that brother Branham is here that we can have mixed motives that there could be a God's will for our lives and that there can be a fleshly mixed motive in doing the same thing and it happens all the time and we've got to learn to separate the two hey man I I just I'll just wish I wish I had some buttons here to say amen amen amen amen because what we're if we don't if we don't take this in we're not going to grow spiritually we're just going to be religious we're going to be carnal we're going to stay at a play and God is wanting so to establish this but he's got to be able to deal with our hearts deal with the inside this is kind of a long quote here brother says just recently it was asked of Me by someone very precious precious Brethren that said no now that we come into the way brother Branham now that we have found the Lord and received the Holy Ghost shall we seek gifts for our ministry that that we should do so now that we're here we in the truth we receive more of God should we seek gifts for our ministry I said don't never do that don't never advise people to do something like that because usually that guy wants to do it is the guy that can't do it in other words he's wanting to do it for himself he's wanting to to use the gift that he's received and God doesn't want us to use our gift Brother John I'll say it again God does not want us to use our gift God wants to use our gift yeah that's right brother Ryan God wants to use the gift he gave us it's God it needs to be God in us using what he gave us it can't be us doing it can have no part of it it's the guy that's trying to run from it is the best one that God uses if he wants to do it so bad the first thing you know he'll find himself a stuffed shirt like you say God give you give me power to move mountains and I'll tell you I'll do something for you if you just let me move mountains no he wouldn't he can't even move himself in the right attitude see he would never move mountains for God so the attitude is important attitude shows where where our motives are at it really does just take for instance like Paul you think Paul could have gotten away from his calling oh brother he couldn't do it it was just grinding at him day and night till he left the church he left everything went down I believe to it was Asia but wasn't it question mark it was Arabia and and stayed there three years down there studying the scriptures to find out whether it was right or not and to find out whether God had already called them so if God is calling you brother and it keeps digging at your heart then I'd say lay aside every weight and every sin that does so easily besets you what an answer to give a man that's just asking if he should go lay aside every weight and every sin that's so easy beset you you see but if it's not digging at you and it just it's not digging at you there's a difference if somebody picks at you once in a while pinches you You Can Let It Go but if it's not digging at you and then I wouldn't think too much about it then see just let it come to its place the motive has to be purely God's will a love to do God's will okay so here these people were in church and they were worshiping but they didn't care to enter in right going through the formality of singing the song clapping a green but their heart didn't want to enter in because their heart could have been on their problems their heart could have been wanting to do something else be somewhere else and a lot of times we can be doing something for God and our Heart's Not There well let's do this as a church and I kind of don't want to do that what do you want to do how do you know what God wants you to do has he told you brother Branham says teaches us that we could be wrong we can't be the ones picking and choosing what we're going to do I'll tell you how that works we come to the church and if we feel like worshiping we'll worship and if we don't feel like worshiping we don't but what we're doing is we're making God lower than our feelings we're making God's word of none effect your tradition your tradition of only worshiping God when you feel like it it's a tradition [Music] making the word of God of no effect when he's worthy of all praise everything that has breath to praise the Lord to put your heart into worshiping don't leave your heart outside the door when you come in be prepared to give them your best to offer the sacrifice of praise Thanksgiving he's done so much for us but but we give them so little we give him so little and look I'm not pointing fingers at anybody but I just think we all need to say Amen from my heart and and not just I agree an amen not and I agree amen but a so be it amen how the prophet taught us in other words let it be in my life that I give more of my worship because our spirit that we bring in here whether it's half-hearted or wholehearted makes a difference in the atmosphere we create an atmosphere for him to come and it ain't just don't put it on the worship leader you can't pull on the piano player and you can't put it on the one or two or three five people we're a body we need one another's prayers well we we need one another to worship god with everything with all of our heart our motive cannot be mixed with any other desire most of our motives are mixed but it's only the one on the top that God is looking at we can't have any selfish desire mixed with it we can't have anything what can I get out of it nothing can be about us these believers who believed in God worshiped God but their love for doing what they were doing is what was missing how many times we come to church but our our heart really wasn't here come on so if Jesus looked at them and said in vain they're worshiping me Hypocrites what would he say to us what would he say to us what do you say something different because we're bride because we think we're bride so this you know we can really if we take the word to Heart it'll change us if it's just a sermon that's going to be over after you know an hour that we come and then we go back to doing our own thing then we're really not coming to the house of God for the right reasons [Music] God is looking for a a a a a a a spirit I'll just say a worship that's in spirit and in truth so God is a spirit they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit in other words we must get out of the Flesh and able to Worship in the spirit because gravity you wake up in the morning you're in the flesh you're tired you wish you didn't have to get up and go to the bathroom but you have to I mean we're in the flesh you have to get out of the Flesh in order to let the Spirit come out and worship God who is a spirit who's not in the flesh of course now if we were just a man-made church and we're going to have to we we're like everybody else and laodicea that's kicked God out of the church and we we don't want the word we're just going to have entertainment we're going to have a uh you know all this lights and and and and singing and all this entertainment well well then it doesn't matter but we it does matter to God it takes love our motive has to be love it takes love to crucify our flesh it takes a love for God to crucify our flesh because we don't want to our flesh doesn't want to be crucified all right another long quote if it's okay and we're going to try to close on this brother Brandon said in the message Christ is the mystery uh Christ is revealed in his own word so we're talking about motives here and objectives you pray what you do pray to well you pray what you pray to I asked for so and so and and certain things and I didn't get it how many has prayed for certain things and didn't get it while you pray what you pray to I ask for certain things uh uh I I pray just so and so for certain things and I didn't get it he said You Prayed wrong we should never pray to change God's mind we should pray to change our mind God's mind don't need any changing see that it's right he says I know a young Catholic boy one time and he had a prayer book saying prayers for his mother to live and she died and he threw the prayer book Into the Fire well you see I don't go for the prayer book but anyhow you see you take the wrong attitude you're trying to tell God what to do how many people do we know when something happened they just they they turned it back on God prayer should be Lord change me to fit your word not change let me change not let me change your mind but change my mind see you change my mind to do your will and your will is written here in the book and Lord don't let me don't let me go till my mind is set just like your mind the mind of Christ let the mind that was in Christ be in you and then when my mind is set like your mind then I'll believe every word you wrote and you said in there you don't make you'll make everything work together for the good to them that love you and I love you lord it's all working together for the good now I've been this week down in the country staying with some dear friends of mine I asked some of them at the table yesterday when we were eating we we always sat around and and have a little study on the Bible was talking about love and there was a certain person said to me he said I believe you're an antichrist that wouldn't be a good thing to call the prophet and I said if that would be pleasing to my Lord that's what I want to be now he's trying to teach something I want to be whatever he wants me to be I love him and if he would cast me into hell I would still love him if I go with the same spirit I have now he looked at me kind of strange of course anybody would saying that he said I seen four or five of them young men young wives fine women I know them boys and they love their wives so I said to them so he's trying to teach them what love really is he said here is the way to test it if your love if you love if your wife before you were married now you go back say before the married life so you're single now you've been dreaming you were married but you really wasn't married but you were dreaming you were and you woke up and you went and you talked it over with your girlfriend and you said you know I dreamed that we were married and we had children and we were happy and we were waiting for the coming of the Lord and everything and then this girl would say to you you know I love another man better than I love you now I could be happier with this other man brother man says could you from your heart love her well enough to say God's blessings rest upon you my dear go with this other man he says now check that every each of you men or women well if your love is correct you would do that for you are interested in her welfare what you know you could have her what you know you could have her you could live with her she could be your wife she'll marry you but she won't be happy she would be happier and then if you love her then you want her to be happy so true love is about others it's living for others and if we got eternal life we shouldn't be any problem for us living for others the problem is we want to claim eternal life but we don't mind living a selfish life and we we just tied behind that badge I'm a Christian I'm in the message but where's the fruit why is it so hard to enter into the spirit when we come to church Brother Band says even way before church you can't wait till those doors are open now check that each of you therefore whatever the will of God is let God's will be done whether I'm happy or not I want to live so he will be pleased with what I do therefore check your objective and your motive by that you know whether you love God or not in other words if at any time he told you not to do it could you just simply walk away or if he told you to do something that you're not happy or excited about do it would you just automatically do it see the our motive has to be the will of God not not whether we get what we're getting what we want to get out of it well if he would say you serve me you served me if I'll cast you away well if he'd say you serve me if I'm going to cast you away I love you anyhow therefore if the churches would see that and could believe in that manner so this is a lesson for us it wouldn't be one trying to jerk the football away from the other fella when he's running with it we would be protecting that one see real true motive and objective wouldn't be trying to say hey I got this too this is me this see God can't use that man there is so much impersonation follows it and that's Satan and the people can't realize it they're trying to take the ball from somebody it's football season you know they're trying to take the ball from somebody that has been given let God raise up a Ministry and watch how many goes after it see now genuine love for God no matter what part I Am Lord if I can only say a word for it help protect it let me do that my I read this and I think this is a pure message but this isn't what we see and this is the fruit we need to have the fruit of this message in our lives too often we're worried about recognition we're worried about things other than God I just wonder your will it doesn't matter how much I suffer there just seems to be a limit to everything that we're willing to do what about just being sown out what about that that's what God's calling us to and I'm okay that we're not there today but I'm not okay with us being okay with that there's the difference so I I ask you to check your Motors check your objectives and make sure that what you're doing is only because I want to please him I just want to please and that's the only thing I can see right now is pleasing him and then I believe that will grow will grow together will grow to that statue of a perfect man whose motives whose objective is only for the Lord amen amen let's Stand Together amen I wanted to seeing that little course that we were singing just before we came up here when I look into your holiness and just think of those words [Music] just try to enter into the everything you got just let go of everything everything
