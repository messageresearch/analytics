to receive from the Lord amen and we know he's here because you brought him and we get blessings when we come together the Bible says if just two or three agree in any touching any one thing it'll be established so I believe that we have so many Among Us that anything is possible am amen not like what Brother Bruce said of course I like a lot of things that Brother Bruce said up here but one thing we want to keep keep our faith going throughout this throughout the preaching of the word and the more that you enter into the word the more the word you were going to get amen right because we could be here and we could all take a nap we probably wouldn't receive as much so the more that we enter in amen amen God bless our our visitor God bless you thank you for coming and thank you brother Dennis for for bringing them amen amen amen well let's Stand Together how many has been praying for these Services amen amen amen I believe it was the camels that Rebecca watered carried her to her Isaac and may you be blessed according to your prayers for the services amen and if you haven't prayed as much as you wish you want to just start praying right now amen because we don't want to miss out we certainly appreciate brother darl Ward and you know he has been a blessing to people all over the world and I just feel so fortunate that he would come and be with us I really do I feel indebted every time he comes and he's he was just sharing with me he would he drove seven hours just to go speak to six people about six people the Lord that's that's that's a servant of Christ right there and uh we just appreciate him remembering us and uh let's just get right behind the word and pull it out of him amen amen I want to say it's so good to have brother Bill sister Sue we love you and so glad that you're healthy and strong to be here today amen and still ministering and helping uh the Bride of Jesus Christ amen God bless our brothers here um now I I don't know I we we don't do English real well right maybe may could do you think you could help Brother Joseph these brothers yeah maybe you could uh take them in the back and just uh may I don't know if there's if there's nobody in the cry room maybe right in there and you you Brothers could uh the he could help interpret the word for you okay all right God bless you let's just sing only believe as our brother darl comes to minister The Word of Life To Us amen only [Music] believe only believe all things are possible only believe only be only believe all things are possible only believe Lord I believe Lord I believe all things are possible I'm so glad that we know what to believe amen there's many people today don't have a clue what to believe amen they got so much fake news and false news and this that artificial intelligence what's that know what to believe no more but I'm so glad we've got the good news aren't you for he said in his word you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free amen I'm so glad we're free tonight amen free to worship Him in spirit and in truth knowing that our God does does not fail amen amen what a privilege it is to serve the Living God God bless you we greet you in the name of the Lord Jesus and count it such an honor to be with you and you say brother John was talking about being a small crowd but you know we just need two or three that's right we can have church amen we just put our shoulders to the will and believe God for the impossible so if you have your Bibles turn with us to the book of Acts tonight we want to read from Acts chapter 28 starting at verse one we greet in the name of the Lord Jesus and we appreciate brother John having us up to minister we always enjoy coming up this way and I think the the last time we supposed to come we had to cancel because I I think I scratch the corn is in my eyes or something if I remember right and I was helping my daughter scrape some popcorn off the ceiling and didn't wear no goggles dummy me and boy I sure lit them up but so we were sorry we wasn't able to come but we're here tonight and may the Lord richly bless you want to read from acts 28 we starting at verse one certainly enjoyed the the special tonight in the song service God is so good amen God bless you brother Bill good to see you sir appreciate you coming the Bible says this and when they're escaped then they knew that the island was called Mita and the barbarus people showed us no little kindness for they kindled a fire and received everyone because of the present rain and because of the cold and when Paul had gathered a bundle sticks and laid them on the fire there came a viper out of the Heat and fastened on his hand and when The Barbarians saw that the venomous Beast hang on his hand they said among themselves ain't it something how people always thinks the negative of you they said among themselves no doubt this man is a murderer whom though he has escaped the sea yet Vengeance have suffereth not to live and he shook off the Beast Into the Fire fire and felt no harm amen and how be it they looked when he should have swollen or fallen down dead suddenly but after they had looked a great while and saw no harm come to him they changed their minds and said that he was a God how fast their opinion changed from being a murderer to being a god when snake venom met faith and that's what we want to look at tonight if the Lord will help us When Faith was met Amen Let Us bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the word of God we thank you Lord for this hour that we're living in knowing that no matter how dark it gets or how violent or how evil it gets yet you will keep your word that you promised us Lord we believe tonight that we're gathered with the elect of God that you for ordained before the foundation of the world to be here God in this day Lord we do not believe that you put us here to fail but we believe that you placed us here because you had confidence that we could take your word and overcome this Leota age and Lord we pray tonight that your anointing would just come and take this feeble thought Lord and break it to the hearts of your children that our faith could rise up and receive that which you've already done for us for Father God your Prophet taught us many times that if you stood here in this suit that it was given to him he said Jesus could not heal you because you're already healed the word declares it so Lord tonight may we not look to symptoms may we not look to doctor's reports May we not look to anything that's contrary to your word may we just Look to You Lord and believe bless your children father in a great way those that were they here tonight and those that was unable to come Lord I pray that your spirit would just go to them and minister to them Lord we pray bless your children Lord that when we leave the building may we say did not our hearts burn within us as you walked and talked with us along the way bless us tonight Lord we pray in Jesus name and the bride says amen God bless you Saints you may be seated now I trust you don't mind me quoting the prophet but brother brenman taught us that perfect faith is the master of all circumstances perfect Faith Masters all circumstances well brother Daryl what about mine it Masters all circumstances no matter what it is Faith Masters it he says now watch when you believe anything or do anything you've got to have faith in what you're doing and Faith Masters that circumstance when you believe anything or do anything you've got to have faith in what you're doing then that tells me that when we come through those doors back there we need to come with the understanding of who we are we need to come with this understanding that we was born for a purpose we didn't stagger into this thing as I said in my prayer God knew before there was a star before there was an angel before there was a molecule he knew your name he knew knew the color of your hair he knew the color of your eyes and he wrote your name in his book Hallelujah and like I said we're not here by chance but he put us here not that we would be defeated but he put us here that we would overcome we need to realize we're not an organization we are not a denomination we are the body of Christ represented on the earth in the hour that we are living in is that right John reflected him in his day Wesley reflected him in his day Luther reflected him in this in his day but this is our day and he has called us here not to project some organization not to project some man's ideal but to project the word of God for this hour then we need to realize that we are here as the body of Christ to defeat Satan in this Leota age and when we understand who we are there comes a confidence that we can overcome because faith in the word of God will not fail you see faith is not a Hocus Pocus faith is not a magic wand that you wave over somebody faith is not what you feel it's what you believe and faith has to have a resting place amen and the word of God is the foundation that Faith rest upon the Bible says in Romans 3:4 let God be true but every man a liar the Bible also said heavens and earth shall pass away but not one word of God will fail then we can sit here tonight with this confidence that God's word does not lie Nations lie to us governments will lie to us politicians they'll lie to us that sometimes even people that are close to us will lie to us our feelings will lie to us come on somebody our emotions will lie to us Sensations will lie to us but the word of God will never lie to us thank you Lord and every word of God is just as true as every word of God it's either all the truth or none of it's the truth amen amen the same God that said let there be light is there light did God keep his word that same God said behold I send you Elijah did he keep his word did he send Elijah that same God said behold I give you the Holy Ghost did he keep that promise and that same God said I am the Lord thy God who heals all thy diseases Hallelujah then we can have confidence tonight then what God Said God will bring it to pass now how does God prove his word god proves his word by bringing it to pass thank you buddy oh the prophet said Oh my he he proves his word by bringing it to pass you see Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God when you hear what the word is saying to you then no matter what the circumstance is it's got nothing to do with it well the doctor says it's bad and the situation is impossible but circumstances has nothing to do with it because Faith Masters all circumstances amen Faith believes that God will work it out amen I don't know how he's going to work it out but the most wonderful thing is I don't have to know how he's going to work it out you see if I understand how he does it it's no longer Faith it's knowledge but we don't serve God by knowledge we serve God by faith amen and sometimes he don't ask us to understand he just says can you trust me amen oh my I don't know how he's going to do it but he'll do it anyhow because why Faith Masters all circumstances and you see faith and love is a relationship amen you see some people know everything about God but they're not in love with him amen but the Bible's not written in a book it's not just a book of knowledge but it a it's a love it's a love story to you am and faith and love is a relationship because you came have faith unless you've got love because because your faith you said because your faith is in a God Who is the very essence of love amen and faith and love works together you say what are you saying simply this if he loved me enough to die for me how many he believes he did if he loved me enough to die for me then he loves me enough to heal me to save me to deliver me to forgive me to Rapture me amen and you have faith in the God who loves you and faith in what the word is saying about you you see the Bible must become personal what is the new birth is Christ revealed to you personally you have met this person amen and when you read the Bible you've got to see your name in it if you can't see yourself in the word you'll never be victorious amen amen hallelujah brother Brenham said that Jesus never healed the sick to show his authority but he healed the sick to fulfill the scriptures right amen oh my think about that amen your faith is in a God who loves you and faith in what the word is saying about you you see Faith Masters every circumstance because it's not what you feel it's not what you see that's right it's not what you understand or what you can reason out it's what you believe right didn't we just sing it only believe all things are possible to them that believe amen amen when you hear what the word is saying about you then that word takes preeminence over every circumstance amen amen when you see yourself in the scriptures amen thank you brother when you see yourself in the scriptures that's right you know one of the most horrible things is amnesia one of the most cruelest diseases is not cancer it's Alzheimer's when people forget who they are right my daddy died from that it's a terrible disease the last communication I ever had with my daddy I had to go all the way back to his childhood and tell him things that I remember him telling me as a boy and it got to the place that he couldn't even remember to breathe think about that friends and to set and not know who you are but we're living in the hour that God wants us to know what the word is saying about us amen hallelujah amen hallelujah then that word takes prence over every circumstance when you see yourself in the scriptures like Paul did in Acts 23:10 it says and when they Rose their great dissension the chief Captain fearing least Paul should be pulled in pieces of them they going they're trying their best to kill him he said go there and get the man they're going to kill him so they went down there and got Paul because he SRA they's going to pull him into pieces and he commanded the soldiers go down and take him by force from among them and bring him into the castle and that night following the Lord stood by him and said be of good cheer Paul for as thou Hast testified of me in Jerusalem so must thou bear witness of me at Rome so where's Paul going Rome why God said so how's he going to get there circumstances doesn't matter right he'll get there because God said so well brother D how we ever go to Rapture it's getting so dark it's getting so evil and all how we ever going to do it I don't have to know how it's going to happen but I know it'll happen because God said so amen thou must bear witness to me at Rome so where's Paul headed Rome why the Lord said so how's he going to get there it don't matter circumstances don't matter he'll get there simply because God said so and God's word does not fail and on his way there there arose a great storm 14 days and nights no man ate any thing now I'm telling you right now that was some kind of storm right huh but after a long absence as Paul stood forth in the midst of him and said s you should have hearkened unto me and not loose from crate to have gained this harm and loss and now I exhort you to be of good cheer for there shall be no loss of any man's life among you but of the ship for there stood by me this night the angel of God who I am and whom I serve saying fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar L God have given thee all them that sell with thee now why would the angel tell him that the angel was only repeating to Paul what God had already told him you see some people misunderstand and they want to say that that that that the prophet messenger was a was a plous that he stoed from this one and and stoed from that one but they don't understand what the coming of Elijah was to do he didn't come to bring something new he come to restore us back to the word he come to Oh my he come to REM ESS of what was already been said and this angel that came from God he didn't give Paul a new revelation he just simply reminded Paul what God had already said to him amen oh my fear not Paul thou must be brought before Caesar Lo God hath given thee all them that sell with thee amen now why would he say that because Paul must go to Rome amen wherefor sir the Paul said wherefore sir be of good cheer for I I believe God that it shall be even as it was told to me how many beli what God's told you amen then be happy Hallelujah Paul said be of good cheer are you kidding we're in a category 6 hurricane we've not ate a bite in 14 days and you're telling us to be happy Paul wasn't looking at the storm Hallelujah he wasn't looking at any of that he was looking at what God Said Amen there shall be lost of no man's life among you whether you've ate 14 days or whether you ain't ain't nobody going to die we're all going to safely make it in oh my oh I love the word of God Amen wherefore sir be of good cheer are you happy amen then let your face know it amen and the ship finally broke up from the storm why the angel said it would and taking pieces of the ship Paul and the others got the shore now Building A Fire to dry out and get warm Paul goes to gather up some kenlin now here's a great Revelation right here you see Paul didn't say now look boys I'm the first age CH First Church age messenger I'm a prophet of God and I'm this and I'm a great this and now I'm just going to I can't get my nails dirty you boys go out there and get the wood and I no Paul had an understanding that he was a servant to the people and any true God called man the gift that in his life that gift is not for himself it's for God's people you see people's got it wrong the bride is not a is not a is not a servant to the ministry but the ministry is a servant to his bride and the gift that in that man's life is not for himself it's for you and if God has placed a gift among you in brother Bill and brother John and these other brothers that Minister if God has placed that gift in their life that gift is not for them is for you and you need to use that gift that God's put among you preach brother thank you I believe I will amen hallelujah he went and got some wood to get worn because Paul was a servant and Gathering up some kindling and as he went to put it on the fire this snake struck him right on the hand amen now this snake was so deadly they sat down to watch him die they said this man must have done some kind of evil to escape the storm and now be bit by this deadly snake yeah they wasn't thinking nothing positive of this poor man you see the Venom attacked the nervous system and it shut down the breathing and they would just swell up and die suddenly and fall down there was no need to call 911 you'd be dead before you got the one out right so they just sat down to watch him die right I think I preached in that church one time I'm not sure sometimes it's hard people just want to look at you we need to get involved in the service I'm not the only one that has to sweat you know he amen a good service is when you sweating from saying amen just just trying to loosen you up a little bit but it attacked the nervous system and and this Venom coming up through Paul's body doing exactly what the snake venom was designed to do it wasn't a different kind of snake that bit Paul it's just like the rest of them a deadly snake and as the Venom be to come up his arm and through Paul's body all at once Venom met faith faith in the word that said you've got to go to Rome and appear before Caesar and when Venom met Faith Hallelujah there was no more poison the Venom was still in his body but the poison wasn't in the Venom oh God Paul took the word of God over the fear of a deadly snake bite and he just pitched it into the fire and gathered up more wood and the people of the island said this man ain't a murderer he's a god think about that when a Son of God by faith takes the word of God into his heart and speaks it back upon his lips it's just the same as deity speaking amen Every Mountain has to move think about it when a Son of God by faith takes the word of God and expresses it the Heathen identifies it as deity in flesh Hallelujah he ain't a murderer he's a God oh my think about that the three Hebrew children they stay true to God's word they would not bow their knee to the king's commandment so what did he do he heated up the furnace seven times s hotter than it had ever been heated it was so hot it killed the men who threw them in it right that king must have been some kind of mad think about it they burned their own men trying to kill the three Hebrew children and let me say tonight the devil will destroy his own kingdom trying to stop this bride but he will never stop this bride she is unmovable she is Unstoppable she is is undefeatable amen and they threw those boys in that fire and they testified our God is able to Deliver Us from this fiery furnace Shadrach mesach abedo and they were the Seed of Abraham and they had a promise of God that his seed would possess the enemy's gate amen they had that promise from God and they went into the furnace believe even they were the Seed of Abraham and God would keep his promise that he made to their father and I say tonight we are the Royal Seed of Abraham through the blood of Jesus Christ and we can sit here tonight knowing that no weapon formed against us will prosper amen hallelujah and when the king's fiery furnace met faith faith took the Heat and the smoke out of the fire notice he never took the fire out of the furnace because you see as mad as he was if he had have looked into that furnace and saw there was no fire what do you think he would have done relit it cuz he wanted to burn these boys hides so he would have relit the fire but when he looked in oh God the miracle wasn't that there wasn't a fire in the furnace the wind could have blowed that out the miracle was that the fire was still there but there wasn't no heat amen oh come on somebody that's the God we serve tonight he can take the Heat and the smoke out of the fire amen hallelujah hallelujah what about Daniel thrown into a lion den and them Lions knew they had an easy meal nowhere for this man to go right you talking about a Happy Meal that was a Happy Meal you see no and no doubt these lines had ate several men in their lifetime and they had who' been thrown into the lion's den apparently this was something they likeed to do and these Lions had an appetite for human flesh right amen and when they saw Daniel there against the wall nowhere to go amen I said look out gums here he comes and when the hungry lies coming towards Daniel met faith faith locked their jaws the prophet said when the the pillar of fire stood between Daniel and the Lions the Lions went off and meowed like kittens yes and laid down by faith the Unseen Daniel wasn't afraid of the Lions now I don't know if you studied lies or not but do you know that a lion a wild lion can roar and his Roar can be heard between five and seven miles away I forget I think a l Roar is something like 114 decimals I believe it is I may be wrong about that but it's greater than 100 I do know that the Roar of the lon the prophet of God said you never feel the Lion's bite it's Roar scares you to death before it ever gets to you so the lon whose voice can be heard seven miles away met faith it went from a roar do meow meow meow when hungry lines met Faith they meowed like kittens with a woman with a blood issue 12 years of bleeding and it would not stop spit all her money and not only that but the humiliation of having to go into the village and to yell unclean unclean unclean 12 long years and the bleeding would not stop but she saw Jesus and pressing through the crowd she believed that Jesus was the Christ and she said if I can only touch the Hy of his garbage she believed if she touched him she'd get what she asked for amen and she slipped through the crowd and she reached over notice she must have been small in stature because the Bible said she didn't touch his shoulder she didn't touch his elbow but she slipped through the crowd she probably even had maybe to get in between their legs and just touch the hym right as he passed by just touched the hym of His Garment but she believed if she touched him she'd get what she asked for believing that it would happen notice think about this oh God this is so good think about this Jesus didn't say to her if you touch my garment you'll get well Peter didn't say listen listen to me ma'am I i' I've been with him I've been with his ministry I know how it operates touch His Garment touch His Garment you'll get what you need Jesus didn't say it Peter didn't say it who said if you'll touch the hym of his gar it if I could but touch the who said that she did and faith that he was the Christ yes brought her own words into manifestation and this do you know what her name was we don't even know her name but her faith and her words her words became the very word of God we read about this woman that's okay but that cell phone saying amen it's all right think about This Woman's faith not Peter not Jesus she said that and she brought her faith brought her own words into manifestation and if her faith can bring her words into manifestation your faith can bring your words into manifestation when you say he's my healer he's my deliverer he's my strength he's my joy he's my peace Hallelujah he's the answer to every problem that I have her faith that he was the Christ brought her own words into manifestation and when a blood issue that eluded the doctors for 12 years met Faith the bleeding stopped because Faith Masters every circumstance amen think of Joshua God told Joshua to March around the walls of Jericho and they would fall before him now the walls of Jericho they said that you could run chariot races around the top of them and them walls them big walls they estimate they was 46t high and 80 foot thick amen matter of fact these walls are so wide and so thick that if you remember right Bible readers know that rahab's house was built on top of the wall and God said to Joshua go up there March around so many times sound a trumpet let out a shout and the walls are going to fall down you want us to go up there March around the walls blow a trumpet let out a shout and the walls are going to fall down now I'm telling you that's about the most ridiculous thing to the carnal mind that you've ever heard of in your life some of you didn't even amen it 46t 80 foot thick and you want us to March blow a trumpet and shout and they're going to fall down amen and he asked us just to believe that he's a Healer amen you want to bring a Wrecking Bar backo bulldozzer case a dynamite that'll bring her down no March blow a trumpet and Shout am just obedience oh God just obedience to my word that's all you need well brother D I don't understand the MRI you don't have to understand it I don't understand you don't have to understand the X-ray just obedience to his word it's all we need so silly to the carnal mind but the river I found this the other day was so good Joshua the prophet said knowing how thick the walls was because he built plenty of walls down in Egypt he knew the cement that was in him he knew how tight they were he knew he knew how strong they were he knew that they ran chariot races around the top of them and even built houses on the top of it but he did not lean to his own understanding but he believed what God Said was the truth and he obeyed the word and when he obeyed God's word the walls will fall down maybe you feel like you're in trapped tonight maybe you feel like the walls will all around you but if you'll just believe God's word the walls will fall down Joshua looked at the Unseen he walked around the walls believing it would happen you see it all depends on what you're looking at yes you take the children of Israel came out of Egypt got to the Red Sea God parted the Red Sea after destroying every Egyptian God is that not right the things that he done down in Egypt and here they come up to the Red Sea God parted the sea and they went over on dry ground right grabbed the tambourines shouted and run up and down the bank shouting screaming dancing went out into the desert three days and all the shouting screaming and dancing turn to what are we going to drink how soon the Red Sea Revival died and there was out there with no water and the kids won't no know how do you can't drink that it's it's bitter it's bitter water why would he do that but you see if he can fix one water problem can he fix all water problems if he fixed the Red Sea that was a water problem was it not if he fixed that one couldn't he fix this one and you see here's the thing I'm trying to get you to understand that what did they do he Moses cried out to God God gave him the revelation of a tree and he cut the tree down and threw it into the bitter water and The Bitter Water became sweet what are you saying I'm simply saying this that tree was growing there while they were still in Egypt the answer to the problem was there before they ever knew they had a problem and the answer to your problem has been here all the time amen I got a ticket down in Louisiana here a few years ago to flying down there to preach a meeting and I went down there for two or three years every the second week in February every year I went down there preach with this brother so I got my ticket about four months in advance to try to get a cheaper price and I went ahead and got my seat where I was wanting to sit so I go down and preach come up get on the airplane to fly home there's a man come sits down beside me said good morning I I said howdy he said howd he said where you from I said Tennessee said Tennessee he said what brings you down here to Louisiana I said I'm a preacher oh you're a preacher I said yes sir he said well since you're a preacher let me ask you a question says well sir I'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer but if I can help you I'd be glad to do it he said my daughter was getting her kids ready to bring me to the airport he said I was looking on the internet and he said I come across something so unusual he said I'm going to ask you about it I said well sir if I can help you I'd be glad to do it he said if you ever heard of a man by the name of William brandom and I said yes sir his grand kids go to my church well from Alexander Louisiana to Atlanta I never got to say anything else he talked the whole time he was so excited and after we shook hands and left I got the thinking brother John that several months before that man ever knew he had a question God didn't had the answer sitting beside him oh I love you Lord and before they ever knew they had the bitter water God done have the answer the answer to every problem you have has been here the whole time amen he looked at the Unseen he walked around the walls believing it would happen it all depends on what you're looking at you see Satan think about this Satan does not care for you to see the bars on your sail door he loves to put every one of us in prison right and he don't care if you see the bars on your door of your prison cell but what the devil doesn't want you to see is that door is open oh God Amen it don't matter how many bars is around you if the doors open just walk out amen amen hallelujah amen and when walls 46 foot high 80 foot thick met Faith the walls came down gyrus his daughter laid dead the mourners gathered to mourn and said trouble not the master anymore your little girl is dead right there's something so final about the word dead but you see Jesus gave gyrus the remedy to every bad report when he touched him on the shoulder and he said two words only believe that's the answer to every problem we have what about my children only believe what about my health only what about my only believe amen Jesus standing at the grave of Lazarus a man that had been dead 4 days corruption had done set in his sister even said Lord he stinks right but when a dead man Hallelujah met a man who had faith in what the word said he was and when he cried Lazarus come forth death gave way to life when the maniac of gadera demons had him bound the Bible said he lived among the tubs and he cut himself he was a cutter they still have him today he cut himself with stones and they tried to chain him and they tried to tame him but he would break the chains and he would break the feathers and no man could tame this man but what man could not do Faith could do what brought Jesus to the Gans it wasn't the mayor of the city it wasn't an organization that invited him it wasn't the pig Farmers they never asked him to come if you'll read your Bible they asked him to leave who invited who invited Jesus he was on the other side out of the sea who invited him to the Gans it was a maniac who was living in the tombs cutting his flesh ripping off his clothes but he wanted help amen this needy Soul was crying out for deliverance and Jesus on the other side of the sea heard his invite of faith and Jesus cross the stormy sea to get to him and he's the same one tonight he will come from glory to one needy Soul sitting in this humble church tonight he'll ever time come to where he's wanted he will every time come to where he's wanted but he will never come to where he's doubted so if you're doubting him he will never be at your door well my problem's too bad and the doctor says it's the worst case as long as you believe that he'll never come to your door and look I'm not belittling doctors none at all I worked with doctor for 17 years I was a surgery I did thousands of operations with doctors but I do know doctors make mistakes and I do know for a fact that sometimes their diagnosis is completely wrong you said brother you go to doctor sure if I'm sick I go to the doctor you should too but when the doctor says he can't help me I know somebody who can is that all right but think about it doctors for example there's a man down home down in Greenville Tennessee he was a cow can can I have just a few more minutes he he he he he had a farm a cow farm and he went in for a test a PSA test you know for a prostate and they called him and said you your PSA level's really high it's up like 50 something 54 something like that you've got prostate cancer you need to come in and he said I've got a dairy farm I've got cows I got responsibility said give me a few days to get get some things worked out they said well don't wait too long we need to get started on this you prostate cancer so the man writes a note to his wife and his family and he said I'd rather die at my own hand than die of prostate cancer and he went out in the middle of his farm and took a gun and shot himself and they buried the poor man but it was only like a week after the funeral that the hospital called and said they made a terrible mistake the lab report that was on his chart belonged to another man he had no cancer at all but you see he believed the doctor's report what are you saying I'm simply saying this sometimes doctors are absolutely 100% correct and sometimes they're wrong but God's word is 100 times Amen brother said God will keep his word 100 times out of a 100 well Glory thank you Lord if you're doubting he'll never be at your door but if you love him and want him he'll come anytime you call for him to come he's ready to come he heard this maniac's Cry of faith and if he heard his Cry of Faith he'll hear your cry of Faith you see that great storm could not stop Jesus from coming it could not drowned out the Cry of Faith let me say tonight there is nothing that Satan has that can stop faith Faith from touching Jesus amen don't we sing that song Touching Jesus is all that really matters and then your life will never be the same there's only one way to touch him you must believe when you call on his name When Faith from an honest heart meets God them cogs just comes together like that something has to take place I challenge this audience tonight in the name of Jesus Christ let your faith connect with God like that and in a few minutes you'll have another Pentecost there'll be such a Revival breakout in this town there won't be enough cops in the country to keep them down that's right there'll be a real Revival when your faith meets God now let me have can I have just a few more minutes hang on to your false teeth now this is a good one you don't go to hell because you're a sinner you don't go to hell because you're a sinner you go to hell because you refus to accept the way away from hell you see we couldn't help how we was born we come into the world speaking lies shaped in iniquity that's what the Bible says every one of us come through a fallen State without a choice I had if I had a choice I would have never come this way would you I would have come God's perfect way would you but we had no choice so God don't condemn us because we had no choice we was born this way he condemns us because a way was provided to come away from that and we won't accept it there's a bypass from hell and Christ is that bypass there's a bypass from sickness a quick death a premature grave and that's through Christ now you sinned in the beginning and Christ died for your sins therefore he saved you when he died he saved you and he healed you when he died for he took your place now now all you have to do is accept it by faith and you'll receive it see what I mean now there's nothing more to be done because your healing is already paid for you can have it right this afternoon you can have it right now this very minute when you believe it amen when your faith meets God's requirement it's already paid for you can have it right now this very minute it's already paid for now the other day me and my wife and Jessica was in a was in a restaurant and the waitress come by and she said will there be anything else I said ' no ma'am just just the bill and she saidwell somebody saw you in here and they paid for your lunch she said so if there's nothing left if there's nothing else you can go I said well let me leave the tip she said no they took care of the tip too it's all been took care of Amen so if there's nothing else you can go now I can do one or two things I could say ma'am I don't see nobody in this restaurant that I know are you sure it's my table maybe it's somebody else I could have argued I could have debated I could have said I'm not worthy I could have said well I don't know about that you just want me to go out that door and go ding ding ding he stole a [Applause] steak or I could have accepted that someone cared enough for me to buy my meal and I could walk out thinking whoever it was that done it now if that's true for a steak dinner it's also true for what I'm telling you right now we can well I'm not worthy enough none of us is worthy enough but he's already done it and all he asked us to do was to believe it's already been paid for right just accept it amen it's I remember years ago I was in Romania a girl a young girl I think she's about 18 she she was she' had no hip she born without a hip she was on a crutch and she come up on a Friday night brother Kenny capap was preaching the morning Services I was preaching the night services and she come up on a Friday night and she wanted to repent of her sins and she's on this crutch and she tried to work this leg and get down on her knees and and I said no no no sis you don't have I said you can stand right here and accept Christ as your savior you don't have to get on your knees but she wanted to and she worked work that leg till she got down on her knees to repent and I thought my God how many people with two good knees will never bow and we prayed for her and she went out the next day on a Saturday after the service and went in an icy River with that crutch and was baptized in Jesus name amen and she came back on Saturday night and she came up to the altar on that crutch and she said I want God to heal me beautiful she said I want to be I want to be a wife I want to have children she said but who would marry me like this and I said sis you know what I do if I was you I quit asking God to heal me and I start thanking him for healing me I said everywhere you go you just thank God for healing you I said write it on your mirror and when you get up in the morning and you wash your face and you see it in the mirror take you some soap Rite it on your mirror thank God for healing me when you go to bed at night thank God for healing me and I said when God heals you I said you take this handkerchief and when God heals you you send it back to me as a testimony of what he done for you three years went by and I get an email from a girl named Christina who got my ID dress off of another brother she said brother Daryl I've been trying to find you she said I did what you told me to do said I went everywhere testifying of my healing and she said it got so bad that my parents said I want you to quit testifying because you're no better you're bearing a reproach upon the family she said but I didn't quit I didn't listen to my mom and daddy brother Daryl I kept testifying and she said I was in the young people's meet and said I stood up and I said I want to thank God for healing my hip and she said one of my friends I heard him say here she goes again and she said brother darl when I said that my hip popped amen and I laid down the crutch and I walked out of the church praise the Lord amen amen he's the same yesterday today and forever just be found believe in me sometimes I think we just should just start thanking him for it thank you for your goodness thank you for your mercy thank you for saving my children thank you for the Revival Lord amen can I look at this just before we close this oh my just just just about five more minutes I want to look at this right here I want to look right fast at at hope versus faith and I'll hurry now hope will agree with the Bible here's what we're looking at hope versus Faith now hope will agree with the Bible hope will say it's true hope will say I believe every bit of it hope will say I believe that's the word of God hope will say I believe that God will keep his promise hope believes all of that but then hope says now I believe that God will heal but look at my condition that's the difference hope believes everything that Faith believes but when hope sees the eye or hope sees the situation amen then it loses its theme that's what hope does Hope believes all that but then it says I believe God will heal but look at my condition and you can ask you believe God's A Healer everybody in the church will raise their hand you believe God will heal you and there's always a hesitancy but you've got to believe that there's only one person in Flint Michigan that God will heal it's you amen it's got to be a personal revelation that's what hope does but faith faith don't look at that faith comes around and says I don't care nothing about conditions God said so and it's mine see Faith's Burly as I once said faith has hair on his chest and when it stands up pulls its big muscles out everything else vanishes away it just flies away when Faith really takes hold nothing else stands when you believe it and take God at his word and say it so and believe it so God will bring it to pass Jesus promised he would heal us ask anything in my name and I'll do it when you pray believe that you receive it and you shall have what you asked for it's yours believe it comes to pass well brother darl I prayed and nothing happened you mean you've been waiting one day and nothing's happened Abraham waited 25 years amen amen remember if we pray and ask God sincerely this church we're a unit we're together if we ask God sincerely then God's obligated to take care of what we ask for if you ask anything in my name I'll do it is that the truth then take your faith and meet whatever it is that's bothering you in Jesus name you see when a demon possessed man who lived among the tombs and cut himself day and night when the bondage of chains and the afflictions met The Cry of Faith freedom and deliverance came when snake venom met Faith the poison was gone when a line met faith it purred like a kitten when fire met Faith the Heat and smoke was annihilated When Death met Faith Life came forth when sickness met Faith the bleeding stopped when walls met Faith they fell down when bondage met Faith the chains were broke if that's true friends if that's true for them then is it not true for us then I ask you tonight as we close whatever it is that's bothering you whatever is in your way whatever the circumstance may be whatever the bondage is the sickness is the fear is whatever it is what's going to happen when it meets your faith when it met their faith look what God done and that same God is here tonight and if your faith meets that challenge God will do for you what he did for them he's the same yesterday today and forever amen when you believe what the word says about you and have faith in The God Who made the promise the Seed of Abraham possesses the gates of their enemies amen let me say this sometimes we get in our minds a David and a Daniel and a Moses and we make these people some kind of a super being just like gono I can say the name gono to you and automatically you'll think of an Indian on a horse with feathers and flute music and a Warrior jono when I asked in the Army we yelled his name before they jumped out of airplanes gono you think of a warrior but how many knows jono drove a car do you know that you know Dr Mo rode a ferris wheel didn't know that you know Dr Mo rode in inaugurational parade I guess not what are you saying I'm simply saying this we get an image sometime in our mind of somebody but in reality jono was just a man fighting for his god-given rights he was a man just like me and you drove a car wro wore a top hat rode in a parade yes sir and David and Daniel and Moses they were just like me and you but they believed God for the word for their day and when they believed the god of their day and his word god did great things among them and if that same God can get us to believe the word for our day he can do great things among us what's going to happen when whatever it is that's bothering you meets your faith said brother Dar what if I let it go and it won't happen it'll never happen with that attitude just let the sling slot go the giant will fall in Jesus name do you love him tonight I pray I've not kept you too long I think I've been right out an hour or something but let's bow our heads amen amen man oh Lord Jesus father I know it's just simple just a simple word but God you hide and reveal yourself in Simplicity father
