Thanksgiving to to do it all um we don't really take off too many days in fact we usually have extra services and things so well praise the Lord how many's happy to be in God's house turn with me if you would to the book of Ephesians chapter 4 last week we spoke on recognizing our spiritual position and uh tonight we want to speak on part two uh stepping into our spirit spiritual position and so we're doing a little series on the function of a healthy body we kind of want to dig into some practical things that we run into and that we want to to try to follow the example in the Bible of how to work out things in the church amen amen let's just we'll read two verses and we'll have a word of prayer and then you'll be seated Ephesians chapter 4 starting with verse 15 and 16 but speaking the truth and love may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted by that which every joint supplieth according to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself amen let's look to the Lord in a word to pray Heavenly Father Lord we just read these two verses in your book and Lord there's so much into them God we really need you we really need you to break it to us we really need the Holy Ghost to come and make this so real to us Lord that we could be the type of church that you want us to be here in Fenton Michigan Lord we don't want to uh try to replicate as it were some other church but God we want to replicate the Church of God that's in this Bible God we need you the great Holy Spirit to come and break the bread of life to us reveal to us show us all individually Lord that we might be the church that you're pleased with that you could see us fitly joined together functioning in a healthy way when there would be problems that would arise that we would just be able to handle them and take care of them the way that the Holy Ghost does it Grant it father we commit the service to you and we thank you now for Revelation in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen God bless you may be seated at the beginning of this this chapter it's uh scoffield writes here in in my Bible uh the walk to a to to uh the walk to be worthy the position and we're talking about getting into our spiritual position so he starts out what is worthy to even get into that walk are you with me and he says therefore the prisoner of the Lord beseech you that you walk worthy of the vocation wherewith you are called and he says with all loneliness and meekness and longsuffering uh forbearing one another in love endeavoring to keep the unity of the spirit in the bond of Peace so this is what it this is part of being in our spiritual position you got to be walking in this and then he says it's not just for one person and he starts to express that there's one body one Spirit you're called into one hope if you're calling one Lord One Faith one baptism one God one father of all who is above all through all and in you all so it sounds like all of us if we're in our spiritual position in Christ we will be fulfilling walk with all loneliness and meekness with longsuffering and forbearance you just simply can't say you're in the spirit and not fulfill these scriptures because you're not walking worthy of the calling and then he goes on in this chapter to say that he had God has given us a five-fold Ministry to help us to do that right for our perfecting so he sends a five-fold Ministry to preach the word so we know how to walk so we so we so we understand what it means to be meek so we understand what it means to be longsuffering because they bring the examples out in the Bible and and breaks it down to us and this is how Moses walked he was the meekest man on the earth till Jesus Christ and and and this is how uh Jonah humbled himself and we see all these examples in the Bible the fful ministry breaks it down so we know how to walk in this age worthy of that calling amen so he said it's for the perfecting of the Saints the work of the ministry for the edifying of the body of Christ till we all come into the unity of the faith get it Unity Unity again unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ so to get in our spiritual position is to get to be more like Jesus that's the the the fullness of Christ that's what we're all longing for that when we see him we're going to be just like him and and if that's not our goal we we can't really step into our spiritual position we're we're we're we're coming to church for the for for other reasons now we want to take our subject from verse 16 from who the whole body is fitly joined together in order to function as a healthy body number one we must find our spiritual position and I want to I want to say this this um message is so simple it is so simple it is not complex there's not a lot of making it hard to understand but you can miss it you can miss it uh be God's hidden Simplicity and we can miss it but I want to say that we must find our spiritual position first so we want to to talk about what that spiritual position is a little bit more breaking it down it's not a title it's not an office it's not some Duty that you have in the church but it's when we're spiritually positioned meaning the Holy Ghost is controlling us or moving us to actually help the body now it can't get any simpler than that it ain't us helping the body it's the prepared and the Holy Ghost is using us to meet needs in the body amen supplying what every joint is needed so we're actively involved with our brothers and sisters in church we no longer just come to church about me it's about the body now stepping into our spiritual position is not hopping into church at the last minute a spiritual position requires us to be in the spirit to be out of the Flesh in the spirit instant in season out of season prepared for every good work the Bible says having the mind of Christ ready to help being conscious to help somebody see it's about the body that's what it means to be spiritually positioned in the body now we need to ask ourselves how can we be in our spiritual position in Christ if we're not in the spirit God is the spirit so if if we don't prepare ourselves we're exempt we cannot be spiritually positioned if we're not prepared for the Holy Ghost to work through us to move through us when he says hey there's a need you know it you know we've been used to having church more carnal more natural well there's a need oh boy they got a need but do I want to help do I not want to help and we we just try to carnally handle things Christ wants us to be fitly joined together if there's a need whether you want it or not that's your brother that's your sister we we need to do what we need to do to help that's all there is to it well I don't know what to do well that's why we're we're having this we we we're going to need to spend more time praying because the Holy Ghost is really I'm going to be honest with you if you're in your spiritual position the Holy Ghost is never just going to say don't worry about it leave it go I I'm not saying I'm not saying he would not do that once in a while because the Holy Ghost could I'm not saying it but what I am saying is Time After Time After Time or time and you just don't want to deal with things that is not the Holy Ghost that's the the point I'm trying to make and I think you you you see what I'm saying Christ must be preeminent we must be under his unction his authority his control a Believer cannot be spiritually positioned if he's not under proper headship of Christ Colossians 1:18 says and he is the head of the body the church it's all there is to it he is the head now your head tells you what to do if you didn't have a head you wouldn't be functioning and there's a lot of people who go to church that Christ is not the head they're in control well you're not spiritually positioned if you're in control Christ has to be in control so he is the head of the body of the church who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead that in all things he might have the preeminence so we're sitting here today we're in church and we know God's desire I I I can look at you and I have I have no idea what your desire is I don't know what's on your heart I I don't know where you're at but when we look at God today we know he's here he wants preeminence in all of our Lives amen and and if he gets preeminence what did Brother Ram say if he get one man his hand you turn the world upside down we know God is wanting to have preeminence here and if we don't give God that pre we're not too interested in helping the body so we're not functioning as a healthy body so when we're prepared or when the Holy Ghost has preeminence in us I can say like this real simply we're in our spiritual position that's how simple it is when we're prepared for God to use us and at any moment he's he sees a need you and you you got a hunger and a desire to help people your spirit spiritually in your position it is that simple it's not complexed being in our spiritual position is simply being spiritually prepared for God's use well we think about the three steps justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost sanctification is set aside for the Lord to use you spirit position for God to use you now we want to break it down obviously in this series but number one we must find our spiritual position in the body in other words we must get into the place that we're in the spirit God can use us at any moment to meet a need he doesn't have to hit us over the head we're looking to help one another right there it is you're looking you've come with a heart to help number two we must operate according to the word of God whatever we do to help somebody it has to be in line with the word of God you can't do it your way this is the way I see we want to do it the way the Holy Ghost sees it that's why we need to be prepared he told his disciples don't you go out witness until you get filled with the Holy Ghost first because the the Holy Ghost is the one that's got to be the witnessing and I'll say it like this if we're going to function as a healthy body the Holy Ghost has got to be functioning through US am in order to function as a healthy body I want you to think about this one word we need to function it's that simple do something to help do do do something to help you're functioning to help you're not just I'm spiritual no that's not helping you got to function you know a a a word of encouragement grab somebody pray with them a 30 second prayer it don't have to be long let's pray for this need right now let me help bear this burden with you it you're this is how a church becomes healthier when brother Brandon said the sickest body I know is the body of Christ right so it if we're just honest um there's enough needs in here we could be busy all day helping one another but you know what it is we just don't care I'm just being honest we don't care enough I mean just just try to be right down the middle of the the road here we don't want to sit around like a bump on the Rock we want to function now this spiritual position it's described in Ephesians 4:16 Christ is the head of the body he has uh he has free access to move us anytime he wants to us to effectually work through our lives to help somebody because remember brother bam says the devil can't do nothing to you unless he works through somebody is that what he said okay well Christ can't Christ don't want to help somebody unless he's working through somebody we all came to to Christ through somebody bringing Christ to us right so the body washes the body the body helps the body God is trying to get us to function like a body I'm telling you when you're when you're scrubbing yourself and cleaning yourself taking a shower you don't sit there and try to hit the Dirt Off Your it hurts so you know how to get it off nice and easy sometimes we just need to care about one another discern one another discern the body of Christ feel that's what it means to be in your spiritual position is to be have a heart of caring when Christ is preeminent in you he will freely make increase to the body here we know it's God's motive to love and the Bible says that the body edifies itself in love so when we're in our spiritual position we're fitly joined together the entire body what are we doing we're supplying every connection with what it needs so you see this brother you see this sister and you think I I don't know what I can say to to to Brother Bruce it doesn't look like he's got it needs and I he's much more spiritual than I what what Brother Bruce I want you to know I'm praying for you when I'm at home just supplying to that that joint right there supplying to that connection there's always something something we can do the scripture says we're compacted together now what does compacting mean well I would think that brother bman would know what a compactor is is the RADS have to be compacted before you put the cement on them and sometimes you have to compact sand or stone and what that that does is you're making it tighter you're crushing it you're making it stronger so that when you put the concrete on or the paving blocks whatever you're doing they don't just break apart because you got a good foundation now this word compacting in Ephesians it means to drive together to unite to show to teach to gather to instruct to knit together to prove right so it sounds like to me the body what our our our motive here is now we want to come together and help make things better better better for the church better for the body and it's without respect to persons come on God has no respect to persons why should you be right God wants us just helping everyone so we must recognize and move into our spiritual position position by just I'm prepared I am prepared I know why I'm here I know what I want to accomplish want God to use me second we're operating in the spirit we're operating in other words I see the need and I'm walking into it and I'm going to let the Lord just use my mind whatever thoughts come to my mind I'm going to try to just go with that now when we start doing this we're going to fumble and make mistakes things are not going to be perfect but we need to practice every gift that God gives a man or woman it needs to be practiced it needs to be developed this functioning as a healthy body it needs to be practiced you know we've all had pretty much upbringings that wasn't Godly or at least most of us I could say it like that and so we never learn how to function properly we yell we scream we put the fist up and don't you tell me and I remember my my dad bless his heart he's gone on now I shouldn't talk about him but I remember him shaking his hand right in the face yelling at the men at work that's how we function that's not how we function in Christ we shouldn't be doing that in our homes we shouldn't be doing it here and we should be functioning as a healthy body now when we're functioning as a healthy body does you know what we're actually doing we're setting an example of living for others right we really are now there are some things that affect the health of a body I want to speak on one of them because it's a big one and speaking as a whole it's selfishness big big big bad thing selfishness if a person is battling with selfishness he is exempt from being positionally placed in the body he can't be it's an it's an oxymoron um if I could say it like that to be in your placees I'm ready to be used to help somebody else well when you're selfish you're not even thinking about anybody else you're in a position to see what you can get out of the service or being here it's two different things so there may be some that like this service and there's going to be some that can't wait to Sunday service but I want to be clear about when we come to church we all have needs and I want to kind of put our needs in in a three Cate three priorities the first priority when we come to church I believe every person needs to come to church with humility and love to know where they stand with God that's got to be the number one part because that's what the prophet taught us we come here to find out where we're at with God so we need a humility what does that mean an attitude of I could be wrong about this situation I could have been walking the whole day and it might have not been in the will of God and I need to find out this thing I've been working on for the last three weeks the last two years I may be wrong I need to I need to just come and I need to be sure and you got to have that love God I need to hear from you amen this is the first priority why we should come to church and all the more as we see the day approaching now the second priority and our motive all to be to help minister to our spiritual family I know this is really rocking some but I'm saying it like it is the least we can do is pray for one another I remember we got a prophecy one time the Lord said that we need to come to gather together and pray one for another he said that there there shouldn't be any isms and schisms in the body and the remedy was to come together and pray for one another prayer is the most important thing we can do for one another now I want to talk about the number three priority that somehow we make it number one when we come to church there's a lot of reasons we can come to church some are good and some are bad sometimes we come because we have to the doors are open and well you know it's time to go and I got to go that's not a real good reason to come to church now when we have needs we ought to be looking to God in faith for God to meet those needs if we need healing for our body our mind our spirit our our relationships our homes our jobs whatever it might be if we're Desiring direction for something in our life we we want the the leadership of the Holy Ghost to to to lead us in what direction these are not selfish motives I want to make that real clear but they're not priority one and two you come to church and you make this your number one priority you are not spiritually in your position look if I was sitting on that front row I'd be saying Amen to this but you know I've but I've spent time studying it now these may not be spiritual motives but that doesn't make them selfish motives they needs the thing is we can become selfish about them that's the point I'm trying to make they're not selfish modes but we can become selfish about we can make them number one priority and that ain't what the prophet taught us to the unbeliever to the unbeliever that healing was just the B to get the attention of the bride and then they get hooked with the word and the word becomes their absolute then we can get to a place like job though he slay me I'm still going to trust him I'm hooked my heart is fixed this word is my everything and we're always going to have these things in our life they're like trials either coming in one you're in one or you're going out you're always going to have needs but we need to keep our priorities straight when we come to church so this is this service is about stepping in to your spiritual position you're not there because you were saved you're not there because you were saved 10 years ago you're there because today you made a decision to get out of your flesh to come to church with the right motives and that you got the mindset of supplying what is needed because everybody can't be up here at the pulpit preaching right this is where we come to hear from God and I'll be honest with you if you're not in the spirit hearing from God he could be speaking to you and you'd miss it so I give you another reason to get in the spirit amen so if we're going to function as a healthy body we're going to have to learn and put into practice to put other people before ours ourselves to put other people's needs before our own when we come to church I'll tell you to putting this in practice I see the whole church changing this th this is a reality this is what the Bible teaches and we have we have made things about herself that's selfishness that that will hurt the health of a church a healthy body works at helping others with their needs puts them before their own imagine everyone coming to church with a selfish motive now this shouldn't be too hard to do right now should it but everybody came to church with everything's about me if I don't get what I want I'm going to pout I'm going to show it I'm going to display my sa dissatisfaction well that's that's not going to be very healthy for the body that selfishness well why come to church uh for my family it's all about my family if you never teach your family to supply the needs of others at church how far is your family going to go Go That's not healthy for a body either why I come to church mainly because well I have to you ever come to church because you had to where there's no vision the health of the body perish you need a vision while you're coming to church you need to get rid of selfishness it's strong it is very very strong imagine coming to church to get something from somebody else maybe we're just wanting to get attention from somebody look at me look what I did look what I know attention Grabbers if we're not careful we're going to end up coming to church esteeming ourself better than others and the scripture teaches us plainly to esteem others better than ourselves it's about lifting one another up am it's about helping one another and if you're so stuck on yourself you're never going to help anybody when we think of a healthy body it's a body that is actually exercising helping others you're putting it to exercise I was talking to brother Ben about exercising it's it's about meeting needs it's about taking care of problems it's about working through differences that's a big one because a lot of times something said something's done something's misunderstood there's a a a a hurt feeling something a and and we we don't want to work through it we just you know we'd rather go home and talk bad about somebody that's not healthy just because you're spiritual and somebody did you wrong that doesn't give you a right to go talk about it it doesn't give you to feel bad about it God's calling you to be the bigger person and to to to go help that situation get resolved well brother John my parents never taught me I don't know how to do that we're going to start learning amen we're going to start learning the biggest thing we got to do is face the fear face the fear Satan doesn't want you to work things out Satan wants you to go home with a chip on your shoulder with with being hurt or offended because the pastor didn't shake my hand it's not healthy for the body so we got to think of the body not about oursel I know we're hurt I know we get hurt but think about the body live for the body live for others live to help that person that hurt you that offended you or if you know somebody that hurt somebody else get in there and be a peacemaker roll your sleeves up hey let's come together I want all three of us to pray come on this is the Holy Ghost he's hidden Simplicity but you know what we made Church different than what that Bible told us to make it we become so selfish that we don't want to put into practice these things how is God going to to make us into His Image I mean when we do something wrong doesn't the Holy Ghost come and knock on our heart they say you need to get that thing taken care of he don't just leave and and stay left I mean he may take his flight on the pole and be grieved for a second but he'll still speak to our heart and give us a chance because that's the love of God Amen so any kind of selfishness in the body will negatively affect the health of the body you know it's basically like eating processed foods with all the GMOs and all the bad things that we' you know are told not to eat so Safeguard yourself from any kind of selfishness remember the law of God every seed brings forth of its kind amen so we got to be careful about what we're sewing galaan Ians chapter 6 verse number 8 Galatians 6 chapter 6 verse number 8 I hope you brought your Bibles because we're going to get into them here in just a little bit for he that sth to his flesh this is selfishness I'm just going to stick that word in there right now for he that sth to his flesh selfishness shall reap of the flesh I'm sorry shall of the flesh reap corruption we're trying to get the corruption out of the church but he that sth to the spirit shall of the spirit reap life Everlasting amen when you help the body it's giving life to the body it's healthier it's stronger it's able to to do more now look what he says here and let us not be weary in doing this for in due season we shall reap if we fre how many times you said I've tried I tried I'm getting so tired of it hey you got a scripture right here let us not be weary in well-doing for in due season we shall reap if we faint not now look at verse 10 verse 10 this is for us as we have therefore opportunity let us do good unto all men especially especially unto them who are of the household of faith amen praise the Lord I tell you that just kicks selfishness right out the window see it's maturity here when you're in your spiritual position you're you're you're mature there's a a a a a spiritual place where God can use you to do good onto others a and to help as there's opportunity and God gives opportunity what do we know about opportunity opportunity is all around us Thomas Edison said it just it's hid because it's dressed with overalls and it looks like work and that's what this is you know what I I don't want to do that just not into that you know I got things going on in my life and I got to get out of here okay you know you can't force somebody to be spiritual you can't force somebody to get in their spiritual position it's something that the bride just does the and the bride is not going to not do it the bride is going to do it so it just it's showing where we're standing the word is the acid test so God gives us a five-fold Ministry for edifying the body till we all come into this Unity of doing the same thing Christ does in me he does in you right to help right to help now I'm not saying he says the exact same word or does it the same way or Smiles this way or puts his hand on the shoulder this way no when we sit at the table to go eat we got knives and forks and spoons and but we're still getting the food down our stomach you understand so we don't have to be um you know trying to mimic somebody but we do have to step out in faith I'm Lord I'm doing this according to your word now use me bring the results that you desire to bring and if it don't work we hey I'm sorry I'm sorry I meant this I meant this we that to me is love that's love that's what we're looking for we're no more children tossed to and fro there's there's stability now there's maturity happening while we're working through things and verse 15 of Ephesians 4 but speaking the truth in love may grow up into him in All Things wow I'll tell you you know what that right there that's it I just need one scripture right there to know that I'm going to work the rest of my life to fulfill that one every scripture I see when I read it I feel there's a lot for me to do to to come to that place you know we skip over things and we think well that's not for me that is for us we all got to grow up we all God is not marrying some little 13-year-old he's marrying a bride a mature woman and that's what we got to come to he's the head we're the body now he wants us to be a healthy body a healthy mature body Paul said when I was a child I spake as a child I understood as a child I thought as a child but when I became a man I put away childish things I I I I put away carnality and and look at me and it's it's about me and I'm coming with my selfish motives but now I'm a I'm a mature person and now it's about living for others I've caught the revelation now look God is not he's not taking any church in this whole world up in a Rapture not he's not taking one whole church in a whole Rapture he is taking individuals and so when I'm speaking here I'm speaking to the bride and and and the bride appreciates this word hallelujah the bride wants to become this word amen so as we're maturing we're helping to supply the needs of one another what can I give you can give because Christ is in you you have a lot to offer you can edify you can add how many times have you walked away from the church and just be honest with me I'm not going to call you out and ask you to say them but I want you to be honest and answer this question how many times have you walked away from the church and said well that church needs all that that that brother that sister oh you know what that church how many times now look if God shows you that God has put you you in the place of meeting that need you start with prayer and then he uses you to go meet that need but now if that's just Satan talking you don't have any kind of Faith to meet that need you're just dwelling by fear there's no confidence you're not working to meet that need You' just been listening to a devil and you thought it was God giving you a revelation how bad that church was or how bad that person was [Laughter] help us Lord we got to become fitly joined together and Supply every joint according to the effectual measure in every part making increase of the body so I say it like this if you see a need if you see that there is a need you become the help to that need because I tell you one man can't do it all if if if we could then it would not be a body but it's a body Ministry yes we have a five-fold Ministry that that preaches to us individually that we how to get ready but then we take that word and we exercise it amongst the body with a body Ministry you're ministering to this person you're ministering to this person the next day you're ministering to another person you go home and you say Lord I want you to use me at the church I want you to use me to help just one person it becomes real and then God lays burdens on your heart and you you walk in them and you you see God use you because you're in his hands and you you place in him to use you now verse 17 this I say therefore and testify in the Lord see so this is kind of like a conclusion from the first 17 verses that ye hence for forth walk not as other Gentiles walk and how do they walk in the vanity of their mind they're just selfish they're just selfish very selfish vain thinking that word vanity means excessive pride in or Adoration of one own appearance or achievements it's all about me right that's how people are not in their spiritual position walk they're walking with the mindset it's about them is it okay to preach this okay having the understanding darkened the way they see Church the way they see things being alienated from the life of God what does that mean alienated there's a separation right they're not seeing the life of God the way that it really is because if they did they would be Allowing God to work through them right so it's through the ignorance that is in them because of what the blindness of their heart their their love for God has has turned away and that's gotten more towards the things that they want right lovers of themselves more than lovers of God amen who being past feeling have given themselves over to lciv to work all uncleanness with what greediness if that ain't selfishness selfish motives people giving themselves over to what they want with all greediness now these are not Believers in their spiritual position they are out of position they may be in church because brother B says there's all kinds of Believers in the church but these are not spiritual Believers in their position now I love this verse 20 but ye have not so learned Christ in other words he's speaking to two groups here Church natural Church spiritual right before we get into the other church I just want to go to Jude can you let me go to Jude Jude Verse 18 still talking about this church natural for a second because this is what we got to safeguard against if we're Church natural when we pop in here we're not going to be in our spiritual position therefore God's not going to be able to use us the way we want him to use us how that they told you verse 18 how that they told you that there should should be mockers in the last time who should walk after their own ungodly Desires in the vanity of their mind right these be they who separate themselves Central having not the spirit what does that mean brother John that word separate means to disjoin they disjoin themselves from the body from the burden of helping from the from the opportunities that are before them as we have therefore opportunity let us do good they disjoin themselves from that natural Church natural Central what does that mean that means natural they're sensitive to only the natural things in life in other words their first two spiritual priorities they don't come to church with them Central just natural Carly minded having not the spirit being alienated from the life of God right and they choose this they separate themselves and this is a wonderful thing about serving God in this country we can do it from the dictates of our heart and you know we're not going to have that that that time forever Prophet said the doors are going to be closed and we're going to have to have the goods that's what I'm telling you we're going to have to have the goods all right verse 20 now here's Church spiritual but ye beloved building up yourselves on the Most Holy Faith I want you to not look at this personally but I want you to look at this just for a moment as a body as us God is speaking or Jude is speaking to the body but ye beloved body building up yourselves on the Most Holy Faith praying in the Holy Ghost keeping yourselves in the love of God not yourself yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of Our Lord uh Jesus Christ unto eternal life and some having compassion making a difference that's what makes a difference in a church is having the true compassion of God Amen and others saved with fear pulling them out of the fire hating even the garments that are spotted by the flesh see the body is working together to edify itself in love it's so simple God is hid in Simplicity it's not complex to get in your spiritual position you got one enemy standing in your way and that's your flesh your flesh don't want you in that spiritual position you got to crucify it you got to put it under your feet all right let's get back to Ephesians 4 we just got a few oh my my this verse 17 Ephesians 4 this I say therefore and testify in the Lord that ye henceforth not walk walk not as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind having their understanding darkened being aliened from the life of God through the inance that's in them because of their unbelief who being past feeling past feeling for others have given themselves over to themselves to work on cleanness with greediness but ye have not so learned Christ in other words you've been taught to not walk as other Gentiles walk in the vanity of their mind you've been taught to live for others you've been taught taught to love and edify one another you've been taught to feel for the body to to function as a body you've been taught we haven't alienated ourself from the gospel are you with me all right let's turn to Philippians chapter 2 and this is Paul's uh some verses here uh two the Philippian church as he he's teaching them so you've not so learned Christ so we're learning how to function as a body and this was this was already in my notes uh Brother Joseph when Brother Joseph read Philippians chapter 2 verse 7 in his Bible study today and starting with verse number two fulfill ye my joy that ye be likeminded right not the vanity of your own mind but to be like-minded and that mind is with Christ having the same love being of one Accord and of one mind oh I love this word let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in lonliness of Mind Let each esteem the other better than themselves amen look not every man on his own things there it is number three number three priority it's telling us don't look on the I know you have a need but don't don't look on your own things the scripture is telling us here but every man also on the things of others if there's a prayer request comes in get behind that that prayer request in prayer and say God meet that need for my brother meet that need for my sister let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus saw I'll say it like this Jesus Christ looked on everybody else's things and not his own and Paul's telling us to have that same mindset come to church with that same mindset it's not about what we can get out of service it's about it's about others you know God promised that if we put him first that all other things would be added and when you put others before you before you you're putting God that's just scripture who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant oh came to church with the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of man and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself even more and became obedient not just to coming to church but onto death even the death of the Cross so no matter how much we humble oursel I'm just going to say it like this there's probably we could go right the more humble we are the more we're going to recognize that there's others needs that we can that God can use us to help it's you know we you know carnally we can think being in our spiritual position is knowing you know what all the seals mean and you know uh the Thunders and um quote all these things from the prophet and that is not being in your spiritual position that's just knowledge of the of the message but you need to take that knowledge and start functioning with it start functioning with it amen Ephesians chapter 4: 21 we still have a few minutes here I wanted to finish this because in here you know Paul is talking about both Church natural and church spiritual and you'll see that as we go through here if so be that ye I'm going start with verse 20 but ye have not so learned Christ if so be that ye have heard of him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus so I want to say this who has taught you about Jesus has it been John Martin or has it been Jesus I hope Jesus is teaching you because that's the only way it's going to stick if it ain't on the foundation of Christ it won't stand that ye put off concerning the formal conversation the old man which is corrupt according to deceitful lust selfish selfish put it off and be renewed red in the spirit of your mind which we just read the mind of Christ be renewed in that Spirit by esteeming others and that you put on the new man which is after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness wherefore put away lying speaking every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another we're all one body we're supposed to be one not hiding things from somebody come on it's going to take the you know who's going to do this right here you know's going to fulfill the scripture the bride they have to the bride will become the word that's this is all there is to it and I want to encourage you bride to start practicing these things sometimes you know when it comes to lying they they're called like white lies what's a white lie but I really didn't want to tell my motive and I just you know was just trying to look we're all liars I'm just as big a liar as you are all men are liars sometimes my wife tells tell me we're having dinner at 600 and then at 6:00 she says well if you want dinner you better go out and get it because you know we don't got nothing made hey we all fall short but see we have scripture to tell us what we need to do just in front of one another be real be honest say it like it is all right so put away L speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be ye angry and sin not let not the sun go down upon your wrath neither give place to the devil in other words do never leave church with a chip on your shoulder God don't want the sun to go down say well you know I'm just going to pray about this for three months no just humble yourself to get things right well I didn't do nothing wrong well then maybe you just need to forgive maybe you need to love and forgive the person who did you wrong and they don't even know they did you wrong just you got to function as a healthy body because this this being Central and separating and kind of doing our own thing that's not Christ and as much as we think we're spiritual we're not in our spiritual position am let him that stole steal no more let's not steal any more Glory from god let's give him all the glory but rather let him labor working with his hands the thing that is good that he might have to give to him that needeth isn't that a good motive most people work so they can get a nest egg for the future and the scripture is telling us that we need to give we would probably have more today if we gave more before I believe that let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth that's not healthy for the body but that which is good to the use of the edifying that it may Minister Grace unto the person or people you are talking to Minister Grace now I believe we all can work on this can you say Amen be kind oh let me let me I got three verses here and I'm quitting and grieve not the holy spirit of God because you can't be in your spiritual position very long if you're going to grieve the Holy Spirit whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness let all wrath let all anger glamor evil speaking let it be put away from you with all malice don't hold any grudges get it away from you all of it it didn't say some of it all of it and be ye kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake have forgiven you now that's all if we just fulfill that everything's going to be all good everything's going to be good but as soon as you say well they that wasn't fair what they did to me you just made yourself a lousy excuse not to fulfill the word of God you just said you know what I'm going to get out of my spiritual position of following the word and I'm just going to carnally serve God my own way and that's what you're doing you're carnally serving God your way this is his way this is the way walk ye in it amen just follow it it's the pattern it's not me that wasn't my rules this isn't this is I'm not preaching from some booklet that says Sendel light rules this is the Bible we don't need anything there's nothing better than the Bible what we got to do is just humble ourself to say I want to start doing that am praying about getting in our our position first we recognize it this is what I need to do I'm recognizing that I need to be prepared to help the body that's recognizing your position and you step into that by saying I now am ready and then and then what do we do we start helping one another before you know it you were going home with your feeling so good because you help somebody you know how good it is when you're helping somebody you just feel real good about it it's a blessing when you know you help somebody because God's just going to give it right back to you and so these are the fundamental principle of a health function as a healthy body are you with me amen let's Stand Together praise the Lord it's practical very very practical amen let's just let's go to the Lord be how many wants to step up higher into this amen amen let's just unite in prayer our heavenly father we come to you with with what little we have Lord it's a heart that saysi want to be like you a heart that wants to help the church a heart that wants to be spiritually positioned a heart that wants you to use us Lord as you would use anybody Lord this little that we think we have as much it's very much if you're in it Lord so we pray pray that you take our lives Lord give us your mind every time we come to church help us to be prepared and Lord may we not leave the service without trying to reach out to one person and help them God we give you ourselves we give you this church Lord help us Lord that we can do our part to be a healthy Church functioning For Your Glory and for your honor we ask all these things in Jesus Christ's name we thank you for it Lord amen amen I believe that I believe in that prayer
