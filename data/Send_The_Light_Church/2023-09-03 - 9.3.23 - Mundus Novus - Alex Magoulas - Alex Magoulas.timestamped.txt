[32:23] shadow of turning and we thank you now
[32:26] bless each one we pray and bless the
[32:28] reading of your word and the utterance
[32:29] thereof in Jesus Christ's name we ask it
[32:31] amen amen God bless you if you have your
[32:34] Bibles today we're going to look in the
[32:36] Book of Revelation the 21st chapter
[32:37] again we're going to greet you all in
[32:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we are
[32:41] uh we're just uh we're happy in the Lord
[32:44] today amen God is good
[32:47] um man I just it's so good brother Mark
[32:50] how you doing man man you're just
[32:52] looking better all the time I'm going to
[32:54] look good one day well maybe not real
[32:56] good but like I look better than I do
[32:57] now anyway you know you're talking about
[32:59] being young and I I don't feel as young
[33:02] as I used to I guess that's probably
[33:03] most of us so I was talking to a good
[33:05] friend of mine while about a few weeks
[33:07] back here brother and he's in his he's
[33:10] in his 50s and he was talking to his
[33:13] Pastor who I believe is
[33:15] 10 years older than him or something
[33:17] like that man I feel like I'm only in my
[33:19] 50s but I feel like I'm in my 60s he's
[33:20] like how do you know how that feels
[33:22] brother so so he's like well I guess I
[33:24] don't and so you know you never know
[33:25] until you get there
[33:27] um so you know we could sit here and we
[33:29] could worry about back pains and feet
[33:31] and this and that but you know what
[33:33] that's all it's all settled amen it's
[33:36] it's a temporary thing our light
[33:38] afflictions here they're not worthy to
[33:39] be compared to the glory that will be
[33:41] revealed in us do you believe that today
[33:43] so I just want to encourage you today to
[33:45] press the battle God is faithful let's
[33:48] just look here in Revelation the 21st
[33:50] chapter we'll read the first five verses
[33:51] and then I'll have you be seated here
[33:53] the scripture says this and I saw a new
[33:56] Heaven and a new Earth for the first
[33:58] Heaven and the first Earth were passed
[34:00] away and there was no more sea and I
[34:03] John saw the holy city New Jerusalem
[34:06] coming down from God out of Heaven
[34:08] prepared as a bride adorned for her
[34:11] husband and I heard a great voice out of
[34:14] Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of
[34:17] God is with men and he will dwell with
[34:19] them and they shall be his people and
[34:22] God himself shall be with them and be
[34:25] their God and God shall wipe away all
[34:28] tears from their eyes and there shall be
[34:31] no more death neither sorrow nor crying
[34:36] neither shall there be any more pain for
[34:38] the former things are passed away I love
[34:40] this next part and he that sat upon the
[34:43] throne said behold I may call things new
[34:46] and he said unto me right for these
[34:49] words are true and faithful may the Lord
[34:53] bless the readings word you may be
[34:54] seated
[34:55] this morning
[34:57] so my title I handed it back there to
[34:59] him this morning my title for this
[35:00] morning is Mundus Novus it is a Latin
[35:04] phrase no we're not Catholic don't get
[35:07] worried
[35:08] there's a reason moon is Novus it's uh
[35:11] it's a it's a Latin phrase
[35:13] um
[35:14] to give you the the history of it or the
[35:16] idea behind it when Christopher Columbus
[35:18] landed in the Western Hemisphere and
[35:20] discovered what he thought was an
[35:21] alternate route to India you know a
[35:24] great deal of speculation began to take
[35:25] place as to what he had actually found
[35:27] and while most people were pretty
[35:28] certain he didn't actually find India
[35:30] they were persuaded perhaps he found the
[35:33] eastern part of Asia that he'd actually
[35:34] found something further east than even
[35:36] India and so he himself insisted this up
[35:39] until the time of his death in 1506 and
[35:42] at one point near the end of his life
[35:44] Columbus asserted that he he saw the
[35:47] beauty of of of the Western Hemisphere
[35:49] thinking it was the eastern part of Asia
[35:51] and he believed he'd found the garden of
[35:53] Edens what I actually thought he
[35:54] insisted for whatever reason that he
[35:56] found it up to the time of his death
[35:57] whether it was for fame or whatever but
[36:00] he insisted he'd found the Garden of
[36:01] Eden it was so beautiful and it was so
[36:03] pristine and Untouched by man that he
[36:06] looked there and believing he was in the
[36:07] East the scripture said that God put a
[36:09] garden in the East towards Eden so he
[36:12] thought well this must be the Garden of
[36:13] Eden and so that was his contention and
[36:16] about three years prior to his death
[36:17] another Explorer from Florentine Amerigo
[36:19] Vespucci he had wrote to one of his
[36:22] friends now he had also traveled over to
[36:24] this continent since that time he'd been
[36:25] there a couple different times and he
[36:27] made a bunch of different claims and
[36:28] some are a little more outrageous than
[36:30] others but he uh he writes to a friend
[36:33] of his that this was not Asia but in
[36:35] fact it was a new continent and he calls
[36:37] it uh Mundus Novus or a new world Amen
[36:41] it's a new world and so his writings
[36:43] they they put it in Latin because that
[36:45] was the the academic language at the
[36:46] time he wanted everybody to know amen
[36:49] that that was a new world and so it
[36:50] began to get circulated and it became
[36:52] accepted it became popular that they
[36:54] called this the new world and so it
[36:56] makes sense to me the reason I say all
[36:58] this is you know in a world that was
[37:00] largely unexplored in this side of the
[37:02] hemisphere this side of the world at the
[37:03] time you know it's understandable that
[37:06] men would be looking for a physical
[37:07] location to find the Garden of Eden amen
[37:10] they thought well if we could search it
[37:11] out and find it and we think about even
[37:13] Abraham and brother bam speaks about it
[37:15] in the future home message that Abraham
[37:17] he was looking as the scripture says for
[37:19] a city whose Builder and maker is God
[37:22] now why was he looking for it because he
[37:24] met the king of it already
[37:25] so he's looking thinking brother bam
[37:28] said it must be on the earth now that
[37:31] was his belief it's somewhere right now
[37:32] today on the earth and so he's looking
[37:34] for it and Men we're looking for even up
[37:37] to the time of Columbus they're looking
[37:38] for Eden they're looking for a physical
[37:40] location and it makes sense that they
[37:42] would do that they're they want to find
[37:44] it amen but we understand today what
[37:47] we're looking for we're not going to
[37:48] find it on Google Maps
[37:50] I mean you're not going to search it out
[37:52] by your human ability it's just like
[37:54] when they went into outer space when men
[37:56] went into space they were disappointed
[37:57] that God was up there waiting on them
[37:59] well God was no more up there than he is
[38:01] here today he's all around us it's just
[38:03] moving a little bit faster so it's not a
[38:06] matter of a physical geography or trying
[38:09] to locate it by some sort of a a
[38:11] latitude or a longitude or some sort of
[38:13] cardinal direction but we realize that
[38:15] God is going to bring this future home
[38:17] down from heaven as a as a bridegroom
[38:20] adorned for his bride as a bride rather
[38:22] Dawn for his bridegroom amen God's gonna
[38:25] bring it down amen so if if it was
[38:27] something that you and I could find it
[38:30] would be up to us to do it but this is
[38:32] something that God is going to bring to
[38:33] pass and since only God can do it you
[38:36] can't find it that way amen praise the
[38:39] Lord so it's to know him the one that's
[38:41] going to bring it down that's how you're
[38:43] going to find it amen praise the Lord so
[38:46] we look at the new heavens and the new
[38:47] Earth that we just read about here and
[38:49] God is going to bring it passed in a
[38:51] certain season and in his time and we
[38:53] understand according to the word of God
[38:55] and according to the message it's not a
[38:57] new lump of clay he's not going to take
[38:58] this Earth and dissolve it into like a
[39:01] million pieces and Scattered about and
[39:03] make a new one it's the same lump of
[39:04] clay it's the same attribute of God it's
[39:07] the same framework but he's going to
[39:09] renovate it with Holy Fire amen
[39:12] we know he can do it because he's done
[39:14] it in our lives we are the first fruits
[39:16] of a new creation today amen we're the
[39:19] firstborn of the Church of God
[39:21] hallelujah so we know what the Holy Fire
[39:24] can do because it's done something in
[39:25] our lives amen we weren't looking for
[39:28] God but God come to us God put his life
[39:32] in US amen when we were Sinners when we
[39:34] had gone astray like sheep there wasn't
[39:36] one of us looking for God God kept
[39:39] looking for us and we recognize today
[39:41] that just as the new heavens and the new
[39:44] Earth it's God's workmanship Jesus said
[39:46] I've gone to prepare a place for you
[39:48] amen just the same he has done things in
[39:51] your life God prepared things in your
[39:53] life God put gifts in your life amen
[39:55] before he formed you in the belly he
[39:58] knew you amen you ordained you for a
[40:00] purpose he brought you here today amen
[40:02] it wasn't whatever vehicle you wrote In
[40:04] God brought you here today whether you
[40:06] recognize it or not
[40:08] so what does our attitude or our
[40:10] response towards it today recognize that
[40:12] God has done this we could take credit
[40:14] for it if we wanted we could think that
[40:15] we did something we could recognize at
[40:17] the same God that's going to bring all
[40:19] these things to pass he's done something
[40:21] in our lives amen
[40:23] so we understand it's not a new Heaven
[40:25] or and a new Earth like a completely
[40:26] different uh framework and we look at
[40:29] the scripture in second Peter the Bible
[40:32] talks about the old world was destroyed
[40:33] by the waters amen what wasn't a
[40:35] different planet it's the same one but
[40:37] that Cosmos or that order or that system
[40:40] that was there at the time was destroyed
[40:43] by water just as the one that we're in
[40:45] today will be destroyed by Holy Fire
[40:48] amen
[40:49] and so when the new the New Jerusalem it
[40:52] comes down there's a there's a place on
[40:54] the earth over in the East amen that
[40:56] city is going to come down on brother
[40:57] Brandon said that heaven and Earth Kiss
[40:59] the Earth will push up and the city will
[41:01] come down not a square but a mountain
[41:03] Mount Zion the holy place of God so that
[41:06] means there's an attribute in heaven to
[41:08] display it but there's also an attribute
[41:10] in the earth amen
[41:12] we let me say this way we are the
[41:14] attribute in the Earth today of this
[41:16] generation that God has displayed
[41:18] himself in amen you're more than just a
[41:21] Pew warmer today you're more than just
[41:23] another church member you're more than
[41:24] just another Holy Roller you're the
[41:27] attribute of God out of the earth that
[41:29] he is pulled up from the clay and the
[41:31] calcium and the potash and the minerals
[41:33] in you God put in your mother and your
[41:36] mother's mother and all through the time
[41:37] and through history because he had an
[41:39] attribute of himself to display in this
[41:42] generation and you're that attribute
[41:44] so that makes you more than just another
[41:46] person that goes to church that makes
[41:48] you different than the church down the
[41:49] street you're the attribute of God in
[41:51] this generation
[41:53] God can no more fail to display himself
[41:56] in your life than he can the new heavens
[41:58] and the new Earth because there isn't a
[42:00] new heavens and a new Earth without a
[42:02] new people to dwell in it
[42:06] amen
[42:08] so it's not a new a completely new
[42:10] element plate so we could say this so
[42:12] it's a new paradigm it's a new it's a
[42:14] new uh expression of the things that are
[42:16] there and so we read the scripture and
[42:18] it sounds much like what the prophet
[42:19] Isaiah prophesied of if you if you have
[42:22] your Bibles you don't have to turn there
[42:23] if you want but it's in Isaiah it's the
[42:24] 65th chapter and uh really for the sake
[42:27] of time I'm not going to read the whole
[42:28] thing but the Bible says this in Isaiah
[42:30] 65 verse 14. he says behold my servants
[42:33] shall sing for Joy of heart but ye shall
[42:36] cry for sorrow of heart and shall how
[42:38] for vexation of spirit talk about those
[42:41] that have rejected him
[42:42] and ye shall leave your name for a curse
[42:44] unto my chosen for the Lord God shall
[42:46] slave thee and call his servants by
[42:48] another name that's us
[42:49] that he who blesseth himself and the
[42:51] Earth shall bless himself from the god
[42:53] of Truth and he that sweareth in the
[42:55] Earth shall swear by the god of truth
[42:57] because the former troubles are
[42:58] forgotten and because they are hit from
[43:00] mine eyes for behold I create new
[43:03] heavens and a new Earth and the former
[43:06] shall not be remembered nor come to mind
[43:09] now this is what I want us to consider
[43:11] today I want to to look at this for a
[43:13] little bit it's it's it's remarkable and
[43:15] remarkable to me I've been preaching
[43:16] about the different Redemptive names of
[43:18] God and and probably all of us have
[43:20] looked at some point or another
[43:21] hopefully but you know he's Jehovah
[43:22] shama Jehovah Jireh different things and
[43:25] and I've been ministering that a lot
[43:26] lately and uh you know there's there's
[43:28] many things about God that he displays
[43:31] and he continues to display them in the
[43:33] new heavens and the new Earth amen he
[43:34] continues to be a Healer of the Nations
[43:36] and the new heavens and the new Earth
[43:38] amen all that he expresses himself here
[43:40] he doesn't cease to be those things
[43:43] there but an expression remains of who
[43:45] he is and so the reason I'm saying this
[43:47] is that God expresses himself in these
[43:50] attributes and the Bible tells us here
[43:52] that the former things will not be
[43:54] remembered and I got to thinking you
[43:55] know it's a very mysterious thing
[43:56] because we could look at that one way or
[43:58] another amen you know what what is
[44:02] actually remembered and what is not
[44:03] remembered and I had a brother come to
[44:05] me years ago
[44:06] it's pretty funny he's uh he's the same
[44:08] guy that threw him out of a golf cart
[44:09] but that's a whole other story uh I had
[44:11] a brother coming years ago and he said
[44:13] no I was looking at the message and and
[44:14] brother Brahms talking about the
[44:15] Redemptive names of Jehovah and he
[44:17] mentions Jehovah Jireh and this that and
[44:19] brother bear says Jehovah Manasseh is
[44:21] one of the names and he's like well
[44:22] that's not one of the Redemptive names
[44:23] of Jehovah and so we've got to talking
[44:25] about it and then the name Manasseh
[44:27] means to forget or to cause to forget
[44:30] and I got pretty excited not because I
[44:32] found some new revelation that nobody's
[44:34] ever found before but you know I'm not
[44:35] here to preach the eighth name of
[44:37] Jehovah today but uh but it's it's
[44:39] interesting because you know brother man
[44:41] is 17 times the message I'm sure you
[44:43] could really spiritualize that but uh
[44:45] you know I'm not here to promote my new
[44:48] doctrine today but if you want to buy my
[44:49] book afterwards we can talk about it
[44:52] because of Jehovah Manassas and I think
[44:54] it's interesting because that's one of
[44:56] the attributes of God that we see here
[44:57] in the scripture God causes to forget
[45:00] certain things the former things will
[45:02] not be remembered and so I begin to
[45:04] think about it what does that actually
[45:05] mean because I think we get this idea
[45:08] sometimes which is not biblical that
[45:09] we're just going to get over there and
[45:11] have no recollection of anything that
[45:12] ever happened but that's not what the
[45:14] Bible the scripture is talking about and
[45:16] so if you look in the Book of Genesis
[45:18] the 41st chapter and the 51st verse this
[45:20] is where we see the name manasa now
[45:22] Joseph we all know the story of Joseph
[45:24] hopefully but Joseph you know he was the
[45:26] uh he was the second youngest of Jacob
[45:29] you know he was the Rachel's son and he
[45:31] was the favorite son he had the the coat
[45:33] of many colors you know uh and and
[45:36] brother Branham loved the story so much
[45:37] he named one of his kids after it even
[45:39] he loved the story of Joseph Joseph's a
[45:41] type of Christ amen a type of redemption
[45:44] he was clothed with many colors he was
[45:46] hated by his Brethren rejected and sold
[45:48] into slavery by his Brethren and he goes
[45:50] in the house of potiphar and and he's
[45:52] he's put in prison from there and
[45:55] Joseph's life up to that point didn't
[45:56] look anything like the dream was going
[45:58] to come to pass but God threw a butler
[46:00] in a baker he causes pharaoh to have a
[46:02] dream he takes Joseph and he elevates
[46:04] him to a place where he's the vice for
[46:07] always the he's the second hand man in
[46:09] Egypt he's he's basically King next to
[46:11] Joseph amen so you look at Joseph's
[46:13] story and look at all the hardship that
[46:15] he goes through and all the difficulty
[46:17] of being hated by his Brethren rejected
[46:19] left for dead put in prison and at the
[46:21] end of all these things Joseph he begins
[46:23] to prosper and he takes himself a wife
[46:25] there in Egypt and he has a son and the
[46:28] Bible says this Joseph called the name
[46:30] of his firstborn Manasseh for God said
[46:33] he hath caused me to forget all my Toil
[46:36] and all my father's house
[46:39] amen
[46:41] so this is his own testimony about God
[46:43] everything I went through and all the
[46:45] pain and all the suffering all the
[46:47] hardship now I'm in a place where I'm
[46:50] blessed now I'm in a place where I have
[46:52] fulfilled the will of God in my life and
[46:54] he's caused me to forget my toys cause
[46:58] me to forget my father's house now I
[47:00] want to stop for a second now the Bible
[47:03] says this he says he forgot his father's
[47:05] house but I want you to understand what
[47:07] his Brethren came to me recognized him
[47:09] hey man he didn't forget their existence
[47:12] that's not what it's saying amen you
[47:14] follow me now he didn't say Amen who are
[47:16] these strange people never met them
[47:18] before you know how it is you see
[47:20] somebody at the store and you're like
[47:21] man I don't know I'm just pretending I
[47:23] don't know who they are shame on you for
[47:25] that first of all
[47:27] I'm just going to pretend I don't know
[47:29] who they are listen he knew who they
[47:30] were he recognized them
[47:32] right he remembered what they'd done to
[47:36] him even
[47:37] amen
[47:39] but he forgot not not the knowledge of
[47:42] what had happened but but all the pain
[47:44] and the trouble and the toil that was
[47:46] attached to it amen it had bothered him
[47:49] it had troubled him and he acknowledges
[47:51] even when he meets his Brethren what
[47:53] they did they remember and it's
[47:56] interesting because if anybody had a
[47:57] right to be upset it would be Joseph and
[48:01] when they recognize their brother they
[48:03] despair they get worried they get scared
[48:07] but he Comforts them
[48:09] think about that he Comforts them when
[48:12] they're overwhelmed he says don't be
[48:13] grieved don't be angry with yourselves
[48:18] God sent me before you to preserve life
[48:21] what you meant for evil God meant it for
[48:24] good
[48:25] now the man that should have bothered it
[48:28] didn't bother he's comforting his
[48:30] persecutors
[48:31] now he knew what they did he remembered
[48:34] but on that side of his trial
[48:37] it didn't have the same effect on him
[48:40] amen
[48:42] see when you finally understand it
[48:43] better by and by it changes your whole
[48:45] perspective
[48:47] you look at trials you went through that
[48:49] kept you up at night
[48:51] you look at situations you went through
[48:52] that that drove you to your knees and
[48:54] about destroyed you and now you look
[48:56] back and it only brings a smile
[48:58] hey man did you look back and it was
[49:00] like it never happened
[49:02] what did that God did that for you
[49:05] sometimes we we look at our lives we
[49:08] grew up in maybe a bad home maybe we
[49:09] come from a bad church maybe we were
[49:12] mistreated whatever it is and we ask
[49:13] ourselves why was I treated this way why
[49:15] did I grow up in this situation why did
[49:17] I go through those things why was I
[49:19] treated that way
[49:21] why'd I have to deal with that sickness
[49:23] maybe God sent you that way because he
[49:24] knew that was the only place the only
[49:26] way to get you where he needed you to go
[49:30] hey man he couldn't get Joseph to the
[49:32] right hand of pharaoh without sending
[49:34] him through prison
[49:35] through rejection through a pit in the
[49:38] ground
[49:39] and Joseph probably wasn't sitting there
[49:41] shouting about it every day he got up in
[49:42] jail
[49:43] praise God I woke up in prison again
[49:45] today man it's been 13 years and they
[49:47] forgot about me two years ago glory to
[49:49] God
[49:51] well let's get real for a second people
[49:52] we don't look at our trials that way
[49:55] the Bible says it's worth more than gold
[49:57] trying to fire amen when was the last
[49:59] time you went to the bank and tried to
[50:01] cash in your trials to get a down
[50:03] payment on a new house
[50:05] the world don't see it that way and you
[50:07] probably don't see it that way but
[50:08] that's how God sees it and when you get
[50:10] on the other side that's how you'll see
[50:12] it
[50:13] you know what it was worth it all along
[50:14] or a light Affliction it really wasn't
[50:16] worthy to be compared to the glory
[50:19] that's to be revealed in US
[50:23] well it's easy to say that when it's not
[50:24] my trial I'll tell you that about your
[50:26] trials with a Joseph's trial man man
[50:29] look at what he went through wasn't that
[50:31] great well he didn't think it was so
[50:32] great at the time
[50:33] you don't think it's so great at the
[50:35] time
[50:36] amen
[50:38] you know and that's the thing that
[50:40] didn't affect how God
[50:42] treated Joseph
[50:44] well Lord maybe I just have to have a
[50:46] better attitude listen God understands
[50:48] the Bible says he pities us his small
[50:51] children he remembers a frame that we're
[50:53] but dust we we can get more down on
[50:55] Earth we get down on ourselves and we
[50:57] get down that we're down
[50:58] well I shouldn't be so discouraged I'm
[51:00] discouraged that I discouraged that's
[51:01] what we do we beat ourselves up and all
[51:04] the wild God's saying I've got something
[51:05] better for you if you just if you just
[51:07] hold fast
[51:09] just recognize there's a purpose you're
[51:11] not like the rest of the world I've got
[51:13] a purpose when you go through things I'm
[51:15] bringing something out you might have
[51:16] had to wait a long time for your
[51:18] blessing but I'll bring it
[51:19] Abraham had to wait a long time but he
[51:22] got his Blessing God's speaking to him
[51:24] you're a father of Nations and I ain't
[51:26] got one kid what are you talking about
[51:29] he laughed about it Sarah laughed about
[51:31] it God still give him a son
[51:38] I'm saying this they don't don't put
[51:39] confidence in your confidence
[51:41] put confidence in God
[51:43] we lose confidence in our confidence
[51:46] amen you just you see what I'm saying
[51:48] it's like it's like brother bazarus said
[51:49] don't put faith in your faith
[51:51] well I wish I had don't put faith in
[51:53] your faith put faith in God
[51:55] it's God that's gonna do it
[51:57] amen so God sends us listen we go
[52:01] through things sometime why do I have to
[52:02] go through this because you're going to
[52:03] meet somebody
[52:04] it's going to go through the same thing
[52:06] and they're going to need somebody like
[52:07] Joseph to encourage them you know what
[52:09] it all works out in the end for good
[52:11] man it's all for a purpose you might not
[52:13] know what it is you might not know in
[52:15] this life what it even is
[52:17] but you will find out
[52:20] amen
[52:23] Abraham didn't see all the nations that
[52:26] he was the father of and this in his
[52:28] first life when he come up out of the
[52:30] graves that when Jesus hung on the cross
[52:31] he saw a whole city around him he saw
[52:34] that you know what God was faithful to
[52:37] what he promised it might take a long
[52:39] time but God knows what he's doing amen
[52:41] amen so in this book of Isaiah 65 when
[52:43] it talks about the former things not
[52:45] being remembered several times in the in
[52:47] the chapter prior says the former
[52:48] troubles amen it's the former troubles
[52:51] the toil the thing that Joseph talked
[52:53] about the The Suffering The Pain that's
[52:56] the thing that's not remembered it's not
[52:58] that there's a complete lack of
[52:59] knowledge that it never exists in the
[53:01] first place amen
[53:03] in other words how if that was the case
[53:06] how would you tell me your story on the
[53:07] other side amen see in order for you to
[53:10] have a testimony you'd have to remember
[53:11] what God did for you in this life amen I
[53:15] love it because I've been reading out of
[53:16] the book of Nehemiah a bunch lately but
[53:17] Nehemiah I love this about him he he he
[53:20] goes through things and this man he he's
[53:22] you know he's got it rough from the time
[53:24] he rebuilds the wall That's when his
[53:25] trouble started is when he got done
[53:27] building the wall you would have thought
[53:28] that hey he's done the work's done we've
[53:30] got a restoration God's restored
[53:32] everything that's when the enemy really
[53:33] lays it on Amen and he's just wrestling
[53:36] with one thing after another but I love
[53:38] because Nehemiah he cries up to God God
[53:40] remember me for good
[53:43] God don't forget the thing that I did
[53:46] for you for good Lord I know there's
[53:48] lots of things you could remember about
[53:49] me for bad but I'm asking God remember
[53:51] me for God remember when I when I did
[53:54] something for your children remember
[53:55] when I laid it on the line for your
[53:58] purpose so don't forget me for good
[54:00] remember me for good amen
[54:05] praise the Lord
[54:07] so God remembers
[54:09] it's interesting because God can
[54:10] remember certain things and forget
[54:12] certain things amen
[54:13] he asked the same the same God that he
[54:16] asked to remember what he did for good
[54:17] he says remember what they did for evil
[54:19] I'll pray to the Lord that's that's the
[54:21] Jewish way of doing it amen
[54:23] well that's true you know they're crying
[54:25] out how long until you Avengers Lord
[54:26] right Revelation 18 says this I heard
[54:29] another voice from Heaven saying come
[54:31] over my people and be not ye partakers
[54:33] of our sins that you receive none of her
[54:35] plagues for her sins have reached unto
[54:37] heaven and God hath to remember
[54:40] her iniquities it's interesting because
[54:43] here you know some years back just a few
[54:44] years ago in the last decade you know
[54:46] you had this movement this charismatic
[54:48] movement they got the new pope in and
[54:50] all these Pentecostals and all these
[54:51] denominational preachers they're all
[54:53] saying you know what Luther's their
[54:55] votes over we're all going to be one
[54:57] group we're all going to be one church
[54:58] and these Pentecostals and all these
[55:01] people they all want to join up at the
[55:02] Catholic church and I'm thinking did you
[55:04] forget what they did
[55:06] a hundred years ago that it killed you
[55:08] if they could get away with it right see
[55:10] they forgot all the things that that
[55:12] Wicked system has done to the people of
[55:15] God they forgot about Dark Ages and
[55:18] persecutions but you know who didn't
[55:19] forget God didn't forget
[55:22] men forget but God didn't forget that
[55:24] part amen
[55:25] the Bible says
[55:27] God doesn't forget your labor of love
[55:29] praise the Lord
[55:31] amen isn't that amazing he can call us
[55:32] to forget he doesn't forget your labor
[55:34] of love but he does forget all your sins
[55:37] amen he remembers theirs but he forgot
[55:40] yours
[55:41] praise the Lord
[55:43] now it's like you never did it in the
[55:45] first place now remember it's not that
[55:47] you never did it it's like you never did
[55:49] because he has no recollection of it
[55:50] Amen brother Brandon says if we have
[55:52] confessed that he is we've been in his
[55:55] presence and we have confessed our sins
[55:57] they are blotted out of his book of his
[55:59] memory
[56:00] there's nobody but God could do that
[56:03] that's why he's Jehovah Manasseh listen
[56:06] you can't just do that on your own you
[56:08] deal with it every day probably you wake
[56:10] up and you remember stuff maybe you're
[56:11] going to happen it's funny it just hits
[56:13] you at the weirdest times oh man I
[56:15] remember I did that thing 30 years ago
[56:17] or whatever it is
[56:18] that's how the human memory is
[56:20] true nobody could do that but God he
[56:22] says
[56:23] now you can do anything to me I'll
[56:25] forgive you but I'll remember it
[56:29] if I do anything to you you'd forgive me
[56:31] but you'll remember it but God can
[56:34] forgive and forget
[56:37] think of that don't even remember it he
[56:39] says that makes me feel good praise the
[56:41] Lord I feel pretty good about that
[56:43] massage right now
[56:45] oh my my when it's not even remembered
[56:48] anymore nothing can do it but God
[56:50] nothing but God can do it he said he
[56:52] would blot it out of his memory book I
[56:54] can't do it you can't do it because
[56:56] we've got these little finite senses but
[56:58] he's infinite God he absolutely forget
[57:01] that it was ever done
[57:04] thank you Jesus so God actually
[57:06] possesses the power to cause himself
[57:10] to forget your sin now remember against
[57:12] it's not that there's no knowledge that
[57:14] you ever sin per se because he knew that
[57:16] about you before the foundation of the
[57:17] world
[57:18] that's why there was a lamb slain for
[57:21] you before the foundation of the world
[57:22] he knew there would be a need or a
[57:24] provision for it amen but the penalty of
[57:26] it in the attitude that would go with it
[57:28] he's forgotten all that amen that's why
[57:31] that lamb was prepared it has the power
[57:32] of the blood has the power today Amen to
[57:36] divorce or completely remit sin
[57:39] he's not just covering it up today he's
[57:41] not just whitewashing it he is
[57:43] separating the power of Sin from your
[57:45] past and from your soul and from your
[57:47] identity that's not who you are
[57:50] thank you Jesus
[57:53] it doesn't even come into His thought
[57:55] about you
[57:56] he actually never has because he sees
[57:58] you through the blood of Jesus Christ
[58:00] amen again brother Bram says in the
[58:02] Rapture 1965 he says for instance if
[58:05] brother green heard that I'd been
[58:06] drinking I've been doing bad things and
[58:07] he found out that I didn't do it he'd
[58:10] come say I forgive you brother random
[58:11] you forgive me I never done it
[58:15] what are you forgiving me about see if
[58:17] I'm guilty I can be forgiven but I'm
[58:19] still not just because I did it but the
[58:21] word Justified it's though you've never
[58:24] done it at all Justified and then the
[58:26] blood of Jesus Christ cleanse he says
[58:29] his cleanses us so from sin till it's
[58:31] put in God the book of God's
[58:33] forgetfulness he is the only one
[58:36] can do it now I keep emphasizing that
[58:38] for a reason because when we try to do
[58:40] it ourselves it doesn't work well I'm
[58:41] just going to pretend I don't know this
[58:42] listen you need God's help to do that
[58:44] you can't overcome bitterness through
[58:47] your willpower
[58:49] you can't overcome resentment through
[58:50] your own human ability God's got to do
[58:53] that for you how's he going to do it
[58:55] he's not going to erase the idea that
[58:57] ever happened he's going to give you a
[58:58] perspective he's going to change your
[59:00] outlook and realize you know what what
[59:02] was meant for evil God used it for good
[59:04] God takes trouble and he harnesses it
[59:07] and puts a bit in his mouth and he uses
[59:10] it to bring you closer to him closer to
[59:12] your purpose closer to what he saw you
[59:14] as before the foundation of the world
[59:16] [Music]
[59:18] amen
[59:20] he says this in the sight of God the
[59:22] bride is Justified she never done in the
[59:24] first place amen standing there married
[59:26] to The Virtuous Son of God never sin in
[59:28] the first place why she was four
[59:30] ordained she was trapped into this and
[59:32] now when she heard the truth and come
[59:34] forth the blood cleansed her
[59:37] and she stands there virtuous amen
[59:40] brother man says that's just like this
[59:42] little song that's a different sermon
[59:43] but just like this little song he used
[59:44] to hear Minister and his wife sing not
[59:46] as Mortals forgive one another Jesus
[59:49] forgives and forgets
[59:53] see we can't forget
[59:55] but he can
[59:57] he is God he can forget it it never was
[59:59] put in the sea of forgetfulness and not
[1:00:01] even remember it he's God he can take it
[1:00:03] from his complete memory but we can't do
[1:00:06] that see he can
[1:00:08] so he says we can't do that but he can
[1:00:10] now he can cause us to forget things and
[1:00:13] like I said it's not it's not the idea
[1:00:16] that we have no knowledge that took
[1:00:17] place amen that's what the new heavens
[1:00:19] and new earth we've read about it now
[1:00:20] that the former things won't be
[1:00:22] remembered it's not a lack of knowledge
[1:00:24] that they ever happen amen
[1:00:26] there's a memorial there and His Hands
[1:00:29] he has his scars nail scarred hands amen
[1:00:31] they the only man-made thing in heaven
[1:00:33] today is the scars of Jesus Christ amen
[1:00:36] there there's a memorial about the
[1:00:38] things he did we can talk about these
[1:00:39] reductive names and all these different
[1:00:41] things and and brother Brown lays us out
[1:00:43] the idea of the law of contrast why did
[1:00:46] God permit a fall in the first place
[1:00:47] because he was a Healer because he was a
[1:00:50] savior he was a deliverer but he
[1:00:53] couldn't tell Adam these things Adam
[1:00:54] listen I'm your healer I'm your savior
[1:00:57] he has no idea what he's talking about
[1:00:59] so by the law of contrast God permits a
[1:01:02] fall
[1:01:03] he permits it to happen to express
[1:01:06] himself and Redemption now what would
[1:01:09] the point of that be if he's going to
[1:01:10] cause you to forget that ever happened
[1:01:12] there's no point in expressing these
[1:01:14] attributes if he's going to erase the
[1:01:17] knowledge that he was ever a redeemer so
[1:01:20] there must be a recollection of what
[1:01:21] he's done
[1:01:23] there must be recollection that he was
[1:01:25] the Savior on Earth that you you had
[1:01:26] things happen but now you're over here
[1:01:28] and you look back and realize but God
[1:01:31] was in control the whole time God was
[1:01:33] faithful amen God was greater than sin
[1:01:36] not as the offense so much more is the
[1:01:39] gift of righteousness to us what he's
[1:01:41] done for us it's greater right
[1:01:43] it eclipses it it surpasses it amen
[1:01:48] so we we understand
[1:01:51] amen something the Angels don't
[1:01:52] understand
[1:01:54] when we sing Amazing Grace it means
[1:01:57] something to us
[1:01:58] I once was lost but now they have no
[1:02:00] idea what that means
[1:02:02] we do
[1:02:05] and we will
[1:02:07] amen we continue to have an
[1:02:09] understanding of that that before there
[1:02:11] was a sickness amen there was a Healer
[1:02:13] he didn't become the Healer when
[1:02:15] sickness said and he always was the
[1:02:17] Healer and he always will be the healer
[1:02:19] before there was one sickness he was the
[1:02:21] Healer before there was one sin he was
[1:02:23] always a savior and God permitted it all
[1:02:25] to magnify these attributes to show his
[1:02:27] love because without contrast you never
[1:02:30] know
[1:02:31] you'd never really understand amen you
[1:02:33] never know that he could he could bring
[1:02:35] life to death if he hadn't been in that
[1:02:37] situation
[1:02:38] amen so he did all these things to prove
[1:02:41] himself a redeemer to test your
[1:02:42] character then what profit would there
[1:02:44] be if the knowledge of that were to
[1:02:46] Simply disappear and that's why it
[1:02:49] continues to remain so when the
[1:02:50] scripture talks about him forgetting
[1:02:52] when the things that were former things
[1:02:54] are forgotten it's not that it never
[1:02:56] happened but it was superseded that's
[1:02:58] why I keep calling it it's it's not just
[1:03:00] another world Amen it's not just a new
[1:03:01] world it's a greater world and man this
[1:03:05] is the negative
[1:03:06] we get so we get so stuck on the
[1:03:08] material we see this Pulpit we see this
[1:03:10] church we look at these things this is
[1:03:12] just the shadow
[1:03:14] this is not the this is not the the real
[1:03:16] thing the things which you're seeing
[1:03:18] they're made up of things not seeing
[1:03:20] we're in the negative
[1:03:22] listen this is as negative it's never
[1:03:24] going to get for you if you're a
[1:03:25] Christian you're just moving towards the
[1:03:27] positive all the time amen and listen
[1:03:30] now the young people won't understand
[1:03:32] because we just do digital stuff
[1:03:33] nowadays but you know how I my my
[1:03:36] grandmother years ago you they used to
[1:03:37] them slides you probably know I'm not
[1:03:39] little things there in the little the
[1:03:40] wheel you look at the pictures well they
[1:03:43] have all the negatives well nobody looks
[1:03:45] at the negative when they get the
[1:03:45] positive you use the negative to develop
[1:03:48] the positive you don't keep them around
[1:03:49] like man look at that really dark smudge
[1:03:51] there
[1:03:52] it's only used to develop the positive
[1:03:55] because the positives what you're going
[1:03:57] to look at the positive is the memory
[1:03:59] you're going to see not the negative
[1:04:01] see it's just not developed yet but when
[1:04:04] it's developed in the way that God wants
[1:04:05] it to be you're looking at a completely
[1:04:07] different way
[1:04:09] amen amen
[1:04:11] Jesus says this a woman when she's in
[1:04:14] travail hath sorrow because her Hours
[1:04:17] come but as soon as she's deliberative
[1:04:19] no I'm not a woman so I'm just taking
[1:04:20] the Lord's word for it here so
[1:04:23] but as soon as she's delivered of the
[1:04:25] child she remembers no more her anguish
[1:04:28] for Joy than a man is Born Into the
[1:04:31] world and now he he says ye now have
[1:04:34] therefore sorrow but I will see you
[1:04:37] again and your heart shall rejoice and
[1:04:40] know and your joy no man taketh it from
[1:04:43] you amen
[1:04:45] now I don't know how my wife feels about
[1:04:46] it I didn't ask her this morning and
[1:04:47] perhaps I should have
[1:04:50] but when she looks at her four kids
[1:04:52] well they probably cause her different
[1:04:54] kinds of troubles than they did when
[1:04:55] they were born
[1:04:56] but I don't you know you don't look at
[1:04:57] your children and you know I've talked a
[1:04:59] little bit about the different
[1:05:00] difficulties that they had being born I
[1:05:02] don't look at them and say man that was
[1:05:03] awful what I went through I look I look
[1:05:05] at him and say what a blessing that
[1:05:07] they're here today I don't I don't I
[1:05:09] didn't forget that it happened but it's
[1:05:11] not it's not foremost in my mind right I
[1:05:14] look at the blessedness of it that God
[1:05:15] has blessed me with four healthy
[1:05:17] children they love the Lord that means
[1:05:19] something to me amen it eclipses it has
[1:05:22] caused me to forget
[1:05:24] the trouble that was behind it amen amen
[1:05:27] it's the same thing what Jesus is
[1:05:28] talking about you know Paul himself says
[1:05:30] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:05:33] apprehend it but this one thing I do
[1:05:34] forgetting those things which are behind
[1:05:36] and reaching forth unto the things which
[1:05:38] are before I press towards the mark for
[1:05:40] the prize the High Calling well see
[1:05:42] supposed to forget the former things but
[1:05:44] Paul also says in Ephesians chapter 2
[1:05:46] God who is rich in Mercy for his great
[1:05:49] love or worth he loved us even when we
[1:05:51] were dead in sins hath quickened us
[1:05:54] together with Christ by Grace you are
[1:05:56] saved has raised us up together and made
[1:05:59] us sit together in Heavenly places in
[1:06:00] Christ Jesus why that in the ages to
[1:06:04] come not just this one but in the ages
[1:06:06] to come he might show the exceeding
[1:06:09] Riches of his grace and his kindness
[1:06:11] towards us through Christ Jesus for
[1:06:14] right Grace you're saved through faith
[1:06:15] and not of yourselves it is the gift of
[1:06:17] God not of Works lest any mentioned
[1:06:19] boast for we are his workmanship created
[1:06:22] in Christ Jesus under good works which
[1:06:24] God hath before ordained that we should
[1:06:26] walk in them wherefore
[1:06:28] remember
[1:06:30] I thought I was supposed to forget well
[1:06:31] now he says remember now the Bible's not
[1:06:34] contradicting yourself it's all a matter
[1:06:36] of perspective remember that and being
[1:06:40] that ye being in time past Gentiles In
[1:06:43] the Flesh who are called uncircumcision
[1:06:45] by that which is called the circumcision
[1:06:48] in the flesh made by hands that at that
[1:06:50] time you were without Christ in other
[1:06:52] words remember that one time you were
[1:06:53] without Christ
[1:06:55] being aliens from the Commonwealth of
[1:06:57] Israel strangers from the covenants of
[1:06:59] Promise having no hope you remember when
[1:07:01] you had no hope
[1:07:03] yeah but now you got hope don't bother
[1:07:05] you now because you got hope
[1:07:06] you hadn't been there remember what it's
[1:07:09] like not to have hope
[1:07:12] because now you've got it having no hope
[1:07:15] without God in the world but now in
[1:07:18] Christ Jesus ye who sometimes were far
[1:07:22] off are made nigh by the blood of Christ
[1:07:25] amen
[1:07:26] so see when it comes to where you come
[1:07:28] from in this life remember where you
[1:07:30] come from but when you talk about where
[1:07:32] you're going forget where you come from
[1:07:34] remember where you're going amen
[1:07:37] don't let where you come from stop you
[1:07:39] from pressing towards the mark
[1:07:41] where you come from is not meant to stop
[1:07:43] you to get where you're going it was
[1:07:45] meant to propel you to where you're
[1:07:47] going amen
[1:07:48] so that's all I'm out of perspective you
[1:07:50] can look at your trials and see trials
[1:07:52] and see problems or you can see the
[1:07:55] glory of God you can see a testimony you
[1:07:57] can see a message of overcoming
[1:08:00] I live in brother Graham's life story
[1:08:01] because brother Brown himself now some
[1:08:03] people don't agree with this
[1:08:05] brother by himself said I made many
[1:08:07] mistakes in my life well I can you you
[1:08:09] can either look at a profit and say well
[1:08:11] man that guy made mistakes as a man and
[1:08:13] get discouraged by that or you could say
[1:08:15] oh praise God I made a few too
[1:08:19] he said I don't want them to be
[1:08:21] stumbling Stones that's what people done
[1:08:24] don't let them be stumbling Stones let
[1:08:26] them be stepping stones
[1:08:29] see it's all how you want to look at it
[1:08:31] you can let it stop you or you can let
[1:08:33] it Propel you it's all how you're gonna
[1:08:36] take your attitude towards it amen don't
[1:08:38] forget where you come from because God
[1:08:41] brought you out of it that's not where
[1:08:42] you are today remember what God did for
[1:08:45] you what you were is not where you're
[1:08:48] going to be that's not your final
[1:08:50] destination because God saw you before
[1:08:52] there was that little hiccup there
[1:08:54] called time God saw you in the Eternal
[1:08:56] thought as Victorious as holy as
[1:08:59] accepted
[1:09:00] [Applause]
[1:09:01] so whatever you went through was God
[1:09:03] using it as a stepping stone to propel
[1:09:06] you to where you're at say don't forget
[1:09:08] where you come from but do remember
[1:09:10] where you're going
[1:09:11] love
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:16] now like I said we don't have any more
[1:09:18] power
[1:09:19] to forget that in ourselves than Joseph
[1:09:21] did
[1:09:22] but that's God's power to do that yes
[1:09:26] you know what's interesting about this
[1:09:27] and I'm I just want to take a few
[1:09:29] moments on this you know I've been
[1:09:31] talking about God has the power to
[1:09:33] forget
[1:09:34] but God also has the power to remember
[1:09:36] things
[1:09:37] and to cause us to remember things
[1:09:40] amen that we forgot that we were
[1:09:42] supposed to remember
[1:09:44] now I'm talking about brother man's life
[1:09:46] story you know it absolutely astounds me
[1:09:48] what God remembers not because I thought
[1:09:50] he had a bad memory
[1:09:52] it astounds me what God remembers
[1:09:54] because God remembers certain things God
[1:09:58] finds certain things valuable that maybe
[1:10:00] we didn't think were so valuable
[1:10:03] and I was looking at this story you know
[1:10:04] brother and talks about when when Sharon
[1:10:06] Rose died and you know brother Brown he
[1:10:08] was just in a real bad way we'll just
[1:10:09] say it that way
[1:10:10] you know he had
[1:10:12] he had been so discouraged about his
[1:10:14] wife sister hope Diane then Sharon Rose
[1:10:17] died and you know he just couldn't go on
[1:10:19] without his little girl
[1:10:20] he was working as a lineman one morning
[1:10:22] he probably mostly know the story but he
[1:10:24] was he was working on his alignment one
[1:10:26] morning he was up there on the poll
[1:10:28] working on that and he's seeing his
[1:10:30] shadow it looked like a like Christ on
[1:10:31] the cross and he began to think about
[1:10:33] about on a hill far away
[1:10:35] right so an Old Rugged Cross
[1:10:37] and he began to think about that and he
[1:10:39] saw that shadow get cast there he
[1:10:41] remembered the cross of Jesus
[1:10:43] but then he got to remembering his
[1:10:44] little girl
[1:10:46] he said God you've got my little girl
[1:10:48] you know brother Brandy just couldn't
[1:10:49] take it he went to grab that line the
[1:10:50] next thing you know he was sitting on
[1:10:52] the ground it should have electrocuted
[1:10:53] him to death it should have broke every
[1:10:55] bone in his body when he fell but there
[1:10:57] he was he was just whole and so it's
[1:10:59] around Christmas time and you know
[1:11:01] brother Miami goes into his house he
[1:11:02] goes to grab the mail
[1:11:04] the first envelope he sees is Miss
[1:11:07] Sharon Rose 80 cents Christmas savings
[1:11:09] now I know some people aren't whatever
[1:11:11] about Christmas but that's what brother
[1:11:12] Brown saw
[1:11:13] there's 80 cents for Miss Sharon Rosie
[1:11:16] he sees that that envelope
[1:11:19] for his little girl 80 cents and you
[1:11:21] know that 80 cents might not be worth a
[1:11:22] lot to you and I today but
[1:11:24] it meant something when he saw his
[1:11:25] daughter's name on that envelope and it
[1:11:27] started all over again you know if you
[1:11:29] ever lost somebody real close to you a
[1:11:31] family member whatever you know how did
[1:11:32] you
[1:11:33] it's it's when you're not ready for it
[1:11:35] amen holidays and stuff you know you you
[1:11:38] know they're not there their birthday or
[1:11:39] whatever but when you just going through
[1:11:41] your daily life
[1:11:43] and there's just some little reminder
[1:11:44] that's when it hits you
[1:11:45] I mean we didn't ask to remember that
[1:11:49] see that's that's the thing with our
[1:11:50] memory we don't command its ability to
[1:11:52] work and not work when we want like God
[1:11:54] can do he just remembers that and it
[1:11:57] sets him off again and
[1:11:58] he just wasn't expecting it it hits him
[1:12:00] and he he's devastated he goes and he
[1:12:02] grabs his 38 Special he loads six rounds
[1:12:05] and it puts to his head and brother
[1:12:07] Brandon begins praying Our Father
[1:12:09] Who Art in Heaven
[1:12:10] Hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come
[1:12:12] thy will be done and he goes to pull
[1:12:14] that trigger and now if you know
[1:12:15] anything about a revolver they're not
[1:12:17] prone to misfiring
[1:12:18] amen but he pulls it just as hard as he
[1:12:21] can and it never Falls and I've I
[1:12:23] thought about it one day I said you know
[1:12:24] he prayed the opposite he said thy
[1:12:26] kingdom come thy will be done well for
[1:12:29] his will to be done he can't pull that
[1:12:30] trigger
[1:12:31] no matter how hard he wanted
[1:12:34] right no matter how bad he wanted to go
[1:12:35] on to the next life he's praying thy
[1:12:37] kingdom come thy will be done and he
[1:12:39] can't do it
[1:12:41] frosting he throws the gun down it
[1:12:44] discharges and the property he falls in
[1:12:46] the bed he's crying he said I couldn't
[1:12:47] remember I went to sleep or what but
[1:12:49] he's just crying on the bed he's
[1:12:50] overwhelmed with the memory
[1:12:53] of his grief
[1:12:55] so of course you know another message he
[1:12:57] next thing he knows he's he's gone
[1:12:58] beyond the time he's walking along down
[1:13:00] the Prairie and he's you know he's got
[1:13:02] his hat on sees the Wagon Wheel this
[1:13:03] that and he said there's this beautiful
[1:13:05] young blonde-headed woman just standing
[1:13:07] there and her hair is blown and she's
[1:13:08] dressed in white so the prettiest girl
[1:13:10] I've ever seen I tip my my hat said how
[1:13:12] do you do sister and she said hi Dad
[1:13:15] how looked around said dad said yes I
[1:13:18] said well I don't understand you call me
[1:13:20] daddy she said Dad don't you know where
[1:13:22] you're at this is heaven
[1:13:25] Donald how was your little Sharon Rose
[1:13:28] I love this don't you remember
[1:13:32] you're teaching on immortality now that
[1:13:33] blows my mind because she probably heard
[1:13:35] it when she's like three months old
[1:13:38] she's not gonna remember that but she
[1:13:39] remembered it she said don't you
[1:13:41] remember it how does she know because
[1:13:43] that's how it works there
[1:13:45] don't you remember what you thought
[1:13:46] about immortality I remember it and I
[1:13:49] was a little girl

[1:14:03] babies were all just one age
[1:14:05] the youth forever said don't you
[1:14:06] remember you're teaching of immortality

[1:14:54] there I got to the door and she'd come
[1:14:55] out to meet me and she always did not
[1:14:57] sickly not all dried up eat up with
[1:14:59] tubercular she come out with her arms
[1:15:02] out of that black hair hanging down her
[1:15:04] back dressed in white held on her arms
[1:15:06] and run to me grabbed by grabbed her by
[1:15:08] the hands and knelt down I said oh hope
[1:15:09] honey I met Sharon didn't our darling
[1:15:12] make a pretty woman
[1:15:14] yes Bill she says you're worrying too
[1:15:17] much honey
[1:15:19] now listen any of us would have
[1:15:21] understood hopefully
[1:15:22] I was worrying so much but she's over
[1:15:25] there he said you're worrying too much
[1:15:29] worried how could I keep from worrying I
[1:15:32] said look you're just worrying about
[1:15:33] Sharon and I don't worry about us we're
[1:15:36] so much better off than you are my my
[1:15:41] changes your perspective doesn't it
[1:15:44] we're better off than you are well honey
[1:15:46] everything's been going wrong and
[1:15:48] everything she said I know all about it
[1:15:51] see she wasn't ignorant they was going
[1:15:53] through things she was totally aware I
[1:15:56] know all about it well listen I'm
[1:15:58] looking at it different than you are
[1:16:00] I know all about it
[1:16:03] she says this now stand up and I stood
[1:16:05] up and I looked at her I said I look
[1:16:07] like she did the night
[1:16:08] she looked like she did the night I
[1:16:10] married her I looked at her building
[1:16:12] she said won't you sit down now ah this
[1:16:14] is this is something else he says I
[1:16:16] looked and there was like one of them
[1:16:16] great big Morris chairs sitting there I
[1:16:18] looked over her said she said I know
[1:16:20] what you're thinking he begins to tell
[1:16:22] this story and I'll just I'll paraphrase
[1:16:23] it here for the second time but he
[1:16:25] wanted to go buy this chair while he's
[1:16:26] on Earth and it I think it was 17 he
[1:16:28] didn't have 17 so he paid a dollar a
[1:16:31] week and he paid for this chair and he
[1:16:33] couldn't afford it one week they come
[1:16:34] and took the chair
[1:16:36] and so he come home and she's she was
[1:16:39] worried he was going to be upset so she
[1:16:41] makes some cherry pie says hey let's go
[1:16:43] fishing and finally's like he catches on
[1:16:46] like what's going on you've been real
[1:16:47] nice to me
[1:16:48] what's going on and she said well they
[1:16:50] come in they took that chair and stuff
[1:16:52] and and uh and he and she said let's he
[1:16:55] said let's go to the front room and she
[1:16:56] she says I want to go fishing first he
[1:16:59] said I know what it was I walked I got
[1:17:00] up started walking to the door and she'd
[1:17:02] come put her arms around me they'd come
[1:17:03] got my chair
[1:17:05] I worked all day and preach half the
[1:17:07] night and I'd sit in this chair and
[1:17:08] study where I'd rest and goes to sleep
[1:17:10] they'd come gotten it I owed money on it
[1:17:12] couldn't pay it they'd come to get it
[1:17:14] and I never will forget how we felt
[1:17:19] she recognized when we got there
[1:17:20] standing talking said do you remember
[1:17:22] that chair they come and go I said yes
[1:17:23] honey they'll never come and get this
[1:17:26] one
[1:17:28] sit down
[1:17:30] she said promise me you won't worry she
[1:17:33] put her arms around me said honey I
[1:17:34] promise you I'd never worry again what's
[1:17:36] funny to me is you read some of the
[1:17:37] other life stories is there's one here
[1:17:39] in particular they come and take his
[1:17:40] chair brother man tells his wife says
[1:17:43] sweetheart I just don't care about that
[1:17:45] chair just let it go
[1:17:47] now I don't know if he was trying to
[1:17:48] convince himself or he really didn't
[1:17:50] whatever but I'm saying this for a
[1:17:52] reason he had this chair on Earth it got
[1:17:55] reponey he didn't have a stone he got
[1:17:57] repossessed and yet he's got the same
[1:17:59] chair in heaven
[1:18:01] this is a man's chair I'm not talking
[1:18:03] about just his kids or whatever the
[1:18:05] man's chair is there
[1:18:07] he forgot about it said I don't care
[1:18:09] about it even but God so cared about a
[1:18:12] man's chair that he put it in heaven and
[1:18:16] when he got there oh Hallelujah
[1:18:18] he gets there and sees his chair that he
[1:18:21] didn't care about it wasn't a big deal
[1:18:22] he said don't worry you can sit in this
[1:18:24] one they won't come and take this one
[1:18:27] why it's paid for already
[1:18:31] my my he said well that's up in heaven
[1:18:33] well will that still exist in the new
[1:18:35] you know I got to thinking about that
[1:18:36] that's heaven but what about the new
[1:18:37] heavens and the new Earth well this
[1:18:39] one's paid for
[1:18:40] amen God didn't pay for it to get rid of
[1:18:42] it in fact you know what Jesus said you
[1:18:44] lay up your treasure up there
[1:18:46] and nothing will get to it see if we let
[1:18:49] our treasure up on the earth moths and
[1:18:52] and dust and rust can corrupt it but if
[1:18:54] you lay it up there God will preserve it
[1:18:57] I believe whatever brother Brennan is
[1:18:59] doing right now he's going to tear up
[1:19:00] there somewhere
[1:19:02] now that sure might not mean a lot to
[1:19:03] you that might not mean a lot to me but
[1:19:06] it's not enough to God
[1:19:08] to put him in his chair in heaven
[1:19:16] and we're worried how's God going to get
[1:19:18] this done
[1:19:19] well my loved ones are going to make it
[1:19:20] is this going to happen listen if he
[1:19:22] cares about a man's chair and his dog
[1:19:24] and his horse God will get you there God
[1:19:27] will get everything you need to have God
[1:19:29] will not forget one thing God remembers
[1:19:31] the things that you forgot
[1:19:33] but man probably forgot all about that
[1:19:35] chair amen but God remembered it so that
[1:19:38] means enough to me to put it there for
[1:19:40] him
[1:19:42] don't tell me God is forgetful of our
[1:19:44] Labor of Love Don't Tell Me God's not
[1:19:46] got you in the palm of his hand he knows
[1:19:48] exactly what he's doing he remembers
[1:19:49] things about you you forget
[1:19:53] and his in his life he would sit there
[1:19:55] and be like man I haven't done nothing
[1:19:57] for God I haven't done this and that man
[1:19:59] that one around the world seven times a
[1:20:01] man that brought him maybe a million
[1:20:03] souls to Christ he sees them beyond the
[1:20:05] curtain of time it's so easy for us to
[1:20:07] forget
[1:20:09] it's so easy for us to get weird and
[1:20:11] well doing because we forget what we
[1:20:13] have done what God has allowed us to do
[1:20:15] and we get discouraged and say you know
[1:20:17] what I ain't done nothing God remembers
[1:20:19] everything
[1:20:21] remembers a chair
[1:20:24] man I tell you what
[1:20:26] that's pretty humbling
[1:20:31] I had a brother coming a while back and
[1:20:34] he likes shooting his crossbow
[1:20:36] like brother you know I know that we're
[1:20:39] supposed to love the Lord first I love
[1:20:40] him too but and I really like my
[1:20:41] crossbow do you think I have in heaven
[1:20:43] I'm like well I don't know hahaha
[1:20:46] it seems silly but you get to read the
[1:20:48] message you think about what God is like
[1:20:50] that's not silly
[1:20:51] I don't know what he's going to have
[1:20:53] there exactly I'm not hearing him
[1:20:55] prophesy but uh God cares enough about
[1:20:58] little things and I really like that
[1:21:00] that chair or whatever and God put it
[1:21:02] there
[1:21:03] amen
[1:21:04] I was cleaning the house here a few
[1:21:06] weeks back brother Doug Siebert and I we
[1:21:07] were down in
[1:21:09] we were down in Dayton in this house
[1:21:11] like a half a million dollar home
[1:21:14] in Dayton and uh
[1:21:16] there have been a woman she was older
[1:21:17] she was living there couldn't take care
[1:21:18] of herself anymore and so they put her
[1:21:20] in the nursing home and her and her
[1:21:22] husband they're pretty well to do as you
[1:21:24] can probably gather from what I said
[1:21:25] already you know they had a bunch of
[1:21:27] money he traded stocks and stuff back in
[1:21:28] the 90s made a just a killing on on day
[1:21:31] trading I guess but uh they had all
[1:21:34] kinds of money and stuff and so we go in
[1:21:36] this house and it's got a basement and
[1:21:39] it's a first story a second story she
[1:21:41] wasn't able to go up and down the stairs
[1:21:42] for years so stuff just sat there
[1:21:43] there's all kinds of tools and equipment
[1:21:45] hundreds of thousands of dollars worth
[1:21:48] of stuff in this house it's it astounded
[1:21:51] me how much dust was on this stuff hey
[1:21:53] man all this money and all the stuff
[1:21:56] that they spent it's just collecting
[1:21:57] dust amen her husband's in another place
[1:22:00] and she they don't get along they had
[1:22:02] two kids a daughter and a son they're
[1:22:04] grown up the son lives in Japan and the
[1:22:07] daughter I think she lives in Hawaii or
[1:22:08] something like that they never come to
[1:22:10] see Mom and Dad they have nothing to do
[1:22:11] with them
[1:22:13] there's all kinds of pictures and family
[1:22:15] keepsakes and stuff and they come back
[1:22:17] didn't want any of it
[1:22:21] and uh
[1:22:23] you know it hits you a little bit you're
[1:22:24] sitting there you know they they made
[1:22:27] all this money they did all this stuff
[1:22:28] and yet they've got nothing to show for
[1:22:31] it at the end of the day
[1:22:32] and I got to thinking about brother
[1:22:34] Brandon you know he he married two young
[1:22:36] couples
[1:22:36] one was a couple of some rich people and
[1:22:39] he goes up to the house and they're
[1:22:40] fighting carrying on and then he goes
[1:22:42] down there in the valley goes that
[1:22:43] boxcar that poor couple they did the
[1:22:44] wedding for and you know they they
[1:22:46] didn't have enough money to buy a dress
[1:22:48] or do anything
[1:22:49] but you know what they had love in their
[1:22:51] home
[1:22:53] brother asked the question which one of
[1:22:55] them is the rich one
[1:22:56] William bran if you could take one of
[1:22:58] their places who just whose would you
[1:22:59] take I'd choose that one down there
[1:23:05] see friends it's all about where we lay
[1:23:07] our treasure up
[1:23:11] Martin Luther said I've held many things
[1:23:12] in my hand in my life and I've I've lost
[1:23:15] every one of them not holding one of
[1:23:16] them now but is it everything I've ever
[1:23:17] put in God's hands he's never
[1:23:19] lost
[1:23:22] what does it profit us to gain the world
[1:23:24] if we lose our soul
[1:23:26] what's it profit us to lay up treasure
[1:23:28] down here and get so worried and
[1:23:30] frustrated as brother Rand would say
[1:23:32] frustrated
[1:23:33] it's a couple it's hillbilly word there
[1:23:34] I guess but
[1:23:36] we get so frustrated we get so worked up
[1:23:37] friends lit Treasures where they matter
[1:23:39] that's why we're that's why we're here
[1:23:41] today that's right we believe if this
[1:23:43] has Eternal value to us amen when we get
[1:23:46] discouraged we we wonder we we lose
[1:23:49] sleep why but you're laying up treasure
[1:23:52] all the time
[1:23:53] friends there's dividends that pays out
[1:23:54] of the end
[1:23:56] amen God's mindful about that chair that
[1:23:59] you like
[1:23:59] amen God's mindful about that little
[1:24:02] thing in your life that maybe you even
[1:24:04] think it's insignificant
[1:24:08] amen but God says it's important
[1:24:12] I think of the thief on the cross
[1:24:15] in Luke 23 one of the male factors they
[1:24:18] rail against the Lord Jesus this
[1:24:20] criminal this man that was guilty and he
[1:24:22] knew he was guilty the first thing he
[1:24:24] says is don't you fear God that's quite
[1:24:26] a time to have a revelation
[1:24:28] you ought to fear God says the guy
[1:24:30] hanging on the cross because he's a
[1:24:32] thief
[1:24:33] he end up where is all said don't you
[1:24:36] fear God
[1:24:38] listen we deserve this this man's done
[1:24:42] nothing wrong and he looks at God he
[1:24:45] looks at the Lord Jesus and he what does
[1:24:47] he say he doesn't say listen can you can
[1:24:49] you coach me into this can you get me a
[1:24:51] 12-step program can you send me to a
[1:24:53] good church you know give me some more
[1:24:55] tapes he says remember me amen
[1:24:59] listen if you'll remember me there then
[1:25:02] I know I'll make it
[1:25:04] Remember Me this day in paradise like
[1:25:07] Nehemiah if you remember me Lord I know
[1:25:09] it'll be for good
[1:25:11] Lord if you remember nothing else please
[1:25:13] remember me and what does Jesus time
[1:25:16] this day you will be with me in Paradise
[1:25:20] Remember Me Lord
[1:25:23] forget my son I pray forget my failure
[1:25:26] forget what I've done on my pride and my
[1:25:28] arrogance but Lord remember me for good
[1:25:30] Lord if he can't remember anything else
[1:25:32] if there's one thing Lord please I cling
[1:25:36] to it in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:25:37] remember me for good
[1:25:41] didn't look like there was much for him
[1:25:42] to remember
[1:25:44] but Jesus remembered him
[1:25:47] he remembers us
[1:25:49] he can't forget us
[1:25:51] amen
[1:25:52] this day you'll be with me in Paradise
[1:25:57] perhaps
[1:25:59] perhaps if things had gone different
[1:26:01] that man's life maybe he would have
[1:26:02] spent his life serving God I don't know
[1:26:03] it's hard to know what he went through
[1:26:05] or how he got there and when he was
[1:26:07] getting ready to get crucified that day
[1:26:09] he probably wasn't planning to have an
[1:26:10] encounter with the divine
[1:26:12] but you know what God give him an
[1:26:13] opportunity
[1:26:15] remember me
[1:26:17] in your kingdom
[1:26:19] you know
[1:26:21] it's important today that we know the
[1:26:23] Lord but it's more important that he
[1:26:24] knows us
[1:26:25] we're known of him
[1:26:27] amasso Paul told the Galatians he knows
[1:26:29] you he remembers you he knows things
[1:26:31] about you you don't know about yourself
[1:26:33] he remembers things about you you don't
[1:26:35] remember about yourself
[1:26:38] amen I pray today for each of us God
[1:26:40] this church this assembly of these
[1:26:43] people remember us for good
[1:26:46] Lord help us to remember the good things
[1:26:48] you've done in our lives
[1:26:49] Lord help us to remember the things that
[1:26:52] we can be happy about in our lives
[1:26:55] we get so distracted with our own
[1:26:57] failures
[1:26:58] and our own abilities or what people
[1:26:59] have done to us Lord help us to remember
[1:27:01] the things that you remember help us to
[1:27:04] see things from your perspective I want
[1:27:06] to have a perspective like Sharon Rose
[1:27:09] like hope amen I want to see things the
[1:27:11] way God sees them today in my life
[1:27:14] in your life
[1:27:16] listen the older you get that more that
[1:27:18] means to you amen God remember me
[1:27:20] because I don't remember it myself I
[1:27:22] don't remember we'll put my keys half
[1:27:23] the time
[1:27:25] God remembers amen
[1:27:28] God forgives and he forgets but God
[1:27:30] remembers
[1:27:33] so whatever your trusting in Him today
[1:27:34] if he can take care of a chair he can
[1:27:37] take care of you
[1:27:38] that's my desire today
[1:27:40] my prayer for each of us I trust you be
[1:27:42] I trust you're comforted today
[1:27:44] amen we don't come asking for some great
[1:27:46] riches
[1:27:47] or some particular blessing we come
[1:27:49] today and we remember what he has done
[1:27:51] for us yes we have a memorial today God
[1:27:55] has been faithful
[1:27:56] in our lives
[1:27:58] he's been faithful to us Lord remember
[1:28:00] us and Lord help us never to forget you
[1:28:02] to always remember you everything you've
[1:28:04] done
[1:28:05] everything we go through in life it's
[1:28:07] all worth it in the end you believe that
[1:28:09] today God bless you stand to your feet
[1:28:13] it's a new world
[1:28:15] it's a better world
[1:28:18] this one will be remembered
[1:28:20] as a stepping stone
[1:28:22] to a greater glory
[1:28:24] a greater time
[1:28:28] it's very hard for us
[1:28:30] it's hard for me in this life to look at
[1:28:31] the things I go through every day
[1:28:33] and appreciate the the rough things that
[1:28:36] you go through why would you none of us
[1:28:39] enjoys it no no chastening seems
[1:28:41] Pleasant
[1:28:46] but think how different it would be if
[1:28:48] you never went through the trials you
[1:28:49] went through that's true if you never
[1:28:51] had a problem you never know that God
[1:28:52] could solve them
[1:28:53] you never know what faith in God could
[1:28:55] do amen how much is that worth for you
[1:28:57] to know that today was it worth what you
[1:28:59] went through
[1:29:01] listen it might not seem like it's worth
[1:29:02] what you're going through but wasn't
[1:29:03] worth what you went through already
[1:29:05] right
[1:29:06] that it's going to be worth whatever
[1:29:07] you're going through today that's right
[1:29:10] amen let's just pray father
[1:29:13] I pray you just take this simple thought
[1:29:16] Lord I think of
[1:29:18] your kindness to me
[1:29:21] Lord I think of your grace
[1:29:24] because I stood in that home
[1:29:26] with my son
[1:29:29] Lord I have a wife and a family
[1:29:33] there's men in this world that have got
[1:29:35] Untold riches they they can't even count
[1:29:37] their own money that's so there's so
[1:29:39] much wealth
[1:29:41] so much that they've achieved that
[1:29:43] they've accumulated
[1:29:45] but they don't have peace in their home
[1:29:48] we don't have the love of God in their
[1:29:50] home
[1:29:51] Lord that means more to me than all the
[1:29:52] money in the world
[1:29:56] Lord to have
[1:29:58] brothers and sisters of like Precious
[1:30:01] Faith here today they love you Lord they
[1:30:02] love this message they love the Gospel
[1:30:04] of Jesus Christ they want to serve you
[1:30:06] they want to they want to do right by
[1:30:07] you they testify that you've done right
[1:30:09] unto them you've been faithful Lord that
[1:30:11] means so much more to me today than
[1:30:13] money
[1:30:14] means more to me today than popularity
[1:30:16] means more to me today than anything the
[1:30:17] world can offer
[1:30:19] Lord I pray we just take a moment to
[1:30:21] remember
[1:30:23] all the good that you've done to us
[1:30:26] Lord as we go through trials
[1:30:29] Lord as we sometimes worry like the
[1:30:32] prophet worried
[1:30:35] maybe sometime in our life we felt like
[1:30:37] giving up like he did
[1:30:39] I don't know where each one's at today
[1:30:42] but I do know this if we saw the way
[1:30:45] that you see it Lord it would be all
[1:30:46] worth it to us
[1:30:49] Lord I pray you'd comfort each one in
[1:30:51] their trial
[1:30:53] may you encourage each one
[1:30:55] in the suffering they're going through
[1:30:57] Lord I'm not here today
[1:30:58] to marginalize what somebody's going
[1:31:00] through to tell them it's not a big deal
[1:31:02] it is a big deal I'm not here to make
[1:31:05] that to make light of that
[1:31:07] but I'm here today to magnify that
[1:31:09] whatever we go through you're greater
[1:31:12] and you're worth it you remember us for
[1:31:15] good you've forgotten all our yesterdays
[1:31:17] you forgot all of our heart and hearts
[1:31:19] and our bad attitudes and our sins and
[1:31:22] our iniquities which are many you've
[1:31:24] washed as wide as as wool
[1:31:27] white as snow today
[1:31:30] Lord I'm
[1:31:32] I pray you help us just to each get a
[1:31:34] little glimpse of what it's like
[1:31:37] I think of how it changed the prophet's
[1:31:39] own perspective
[1:31:40] he was worrying so much about it when he
[1:31:43] got over there there was nothing to
[1:31:44] worry about
[1:31:46] so many of our problems in our trials
[1:31:48] we make them bigger than they are
[1:31:51] father I pray you just help us today
[1:31:54] to be a little more grateful than we
[1:31:56] were yesterday to have a little more
[1:31:58] compassion than we did yesterday to to
[1:32:00] remember you a little more than we did
[1:32:01] yesterday Lord we we we
[1:32:03] ought to always just rehearse and
[1:32:05] remember we spend so much time in prayer
[1:32:08] asking for things
[1:32:10] and how often we forget to thank you
[1:32:12] how many times in our lives what have
[1:32:14] you brought to pass that thing that we
[1:32:16] were praying for and we forget all about
[1:32:18] what you did for us oh lord it's so easy
[1:32:21] for us we we're so forgetful at times
[1:32:24] we're so on grateful at times that I
[1:32:26] pray he'd help us today just to be a
[1:32:28] little more mindful our perspective is
[1:32:31] what changes everything
[1:32:33] Joseph's perspective changed his entire
[1:32:36] attitude towards his Brethren towards
[1:32:38] his circumstances I pray that the Mighty
[1:32:41] God of Joseph the the god of Manasseh
[1:32:45] may you cause us to forget our toils and
[1:32:48] our troubles for just a moment today it
[1:32:51] was we remember and look to you
[1:32:53] as being faithful and it's true your
[1:32:56] words they're true and faithful bless
[1:32:58] these people I pray I pray their hearts
[1:33:00] are encouraged you remember them for
[1:33:02] good just as you remembered a prophet's
[1:33:04] chair
[1:33:06] remember us I pray and we thank you
[1:33:08] father in Jesus Christ's name amen
