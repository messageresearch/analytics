[35:03] yesterday
[35:05] um that's just that's just what
[35:07] Christians do that's just scripture and
[35:10] uh we really
[35:12] appreciate him doing that uh brother
[35:15] brother um Marty's not with us uh today
[35:18] um today is one year since sister

[35:32] we we just love sister Kathleen I
[35:37] telling brother uh Mary uh earlier today

[35:48] Kathleen I said Lord would you bless
[35:50] sister Kathleen up in

[35:56] that desire I I uh I'll say it like this
[36:00] if Sister Kathleen was here let's just
[36:05] uh get into the word and and receive the
[36:09] word of God and and know that our sister
[36:12] is waiting for us to run the race am and
[36:15] get to the other side and as this race
[36:19] comes down to an end there's going to be
[36:21] fewer and fewer people amen amen well
[36:24] turn with me if you would to the book of
[36:27] First Corinthians chapter
[36:30] 15 and we'll have our opening scripture
[36:34] there we're going to start with verse
[36:36] number
[36:38] 50
[36:41] and read eight or nine verses there 1
[36:46] Corinthians chapter
[36:52] 15
[36:54] amen and we'll have a word of prayer
[36:56] starting starting with
[36:57] verse number 50 now this I say Brethren
[37:01] that flesh and blood cannot inherit the
[37:02] kingdom of
[37:04] God neither does corruption inherit
[37:07] incorruption behold I show you a mystery
[37:10] we shall not all sleep but we shall be
[37:14] changed in a moment in the twinkling of
[37:19] an eye at the last Trump for the Trump
[37:21] shall sound and the dead shall be raised
[37:24] Incorruptible and we shall be changed
[37:27] amen for this corruption must put on
[37:29] incorruption and this Mortal must put on
[37:33] immortality so when this corruptible
[37:36] shall have put on incorruption and this
[37:38] Mortal shall put on immoral immortality
[37:41] then shall it be brought to pass the
[37:44] saying that is written death is
[37:46] swallowed up in Victory oh death where
[37:50] is thy sting oh grave Wars th Victory
[37:53] The Sting of death is sin and the
[37:56] strength of sin is the law but thanks be
[37:59] to God which giveth us the victory
[38:03] through our Lord Jesus Christ can you
[38:05] say Amen now with this victory that we
[38:10] have
[38:11] therefore my beloved
[38:15] Brethren be ye steadfast
[38:18] unmovable always abounding in the work
[38:21] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[38:24] your labor is not in vain in the Lord

[38:29] word of prayer before we SE Heavenly
[38:31] Father we thank you Lord for this this
[38:35] new year that we're starting
[38:38] off
[38:42] 2024
[38:44] Lord we just need your grace more than
[38:46] we've ever needed it
[38:49] before and we pray father that you would
[38:52] so fill us with your Holy
[38:55] Spirit
[38:57] Lord let it let our cups like like David
[39:00] said that it would just
[39:02] overflow that'd be so much of your Holy
[39:05] Spirit in us that we could we could
[39:07] fulfill your will in our
[39:09] lives father as we look into the
[39:11] scriptures today we ask that you would
[39:14] come and help us as Brother Bruce said
[39:17] to look Beyond the Veil and see you
[39:19] speaking directly to our hearts
[39:23] Lord may your word become revealed to us
[39:26] and may you help us in this year to come
[39:29] may we get the instructions that we need
[39:32] Lord for this year in front of us God we
[39:36] thank you for this we're trusting you
[39:39] now as we wait further upon thee in the
[39:41] precious name of Jesus Christ we pray
[39:44] amen amen amen God bless you you may be
[39:46] seated there's a a scripture in the
[39:49] Bible and I would like to read it it's
[39:52] it's uh I'm just going to read it we're
[39:54] not going to put it up on the board you
[39:55] all know it all scripture is given by
[39:57] the inspiration of God Amen and it is
[40:01] profitable for Doctrine for Repro for
[40:03] correction for instruction and
[40:05] righteousness that the man of God may be
[40:08] perfect thoroughly furnished unto all
[40:11] good works I believe that this service
[40:13] today is for each and every one of us
[40:16] amen it's not just for a few people it's
[40:19] for each and every one of us and I
[40:21] believe that God wants us to be
[40:24] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[40:26] do you believe that now we read in our
[40:30] opening scripture that that we're to be
[40:34] steadfast unmovable and always abounding
[40:38] in the work of the Lord for as you know
[40:40] that your labor is not in vain in the
[40:44] Lord in the book of Hebrews I'm just
[40:47] going to read
[40:49] it uh the writer in the book of he
[40:53] Hebrews said for God is Not unrighteous
[40:55] to forgive get your work and labor of
[40:58] love that you have showed towards his
[41:00] name in that ye have ministered to the
[41:02] Saints and do Minister and we desire
[41:05] that every one of you do show the same
[41:07] diligence to the full Assurance of Hope
[41:11] unto the End Amen so we can't
[41:14] stop that ye be not slothful this is
[41:19] Hebrews 6:12 that you be not slothful
[41:22] but followers of them who through faith
[41:25] and patience inher the promises now I
[41:28] want to uh en title this wasting God's
[41:32] time and for a subject being faithful
[41:36] with God's
[41:39] time
[41:43] so as we get into that you'll see why
[41:47] I'm titling this wasting God's time we
[41:50] are let me let me just say it like
[41:53] this the life that we're living is the
[41:55] time that God is has given us amen we
[41:58] didn't make the time up we didn't make
[42:01] our lives up it it's God he made us our
[42:04] lives are bought by God that means our
[42:06] time belongs to
[42:10] God second Peter 38 says but beloved be
[42:13] not ignorant of this one thing that one
[42:16] day is with the Lord as a thousand years
[42:21] amen and a thousand years is one day
[42:24] it's all just one to the lord it's hard
[42:27] to Define eternity am if one day with
[42:31] the Lord is a thousand years for a man
[42:35] then an hour and 55 minutes is equal to
[42:41] an 80y old
[42:45] person now the life expectancy is going
[42:50] down and uh if if you live if we live to
[42:53] 80 we're literally a the average in
[42:59] America a person's life is a vapor that
[43:03] appear for a little time and then vanish
[43:06] away that's right is that what the
[43:08] scripture tells us amen James says go to
[43:12] now ye that say today or tomorrow we're
[43:14] going to go in such a city and continue
[43:16] there and buy and sell and get gain and
[43:18] this is what we're going to
[43:19] do whereas you know not what shall be of
[43:23] tomorrow for what is your life it's even
[43:25] a vapor that appear for a little time
[43:27] and then vanished way you ought to say
[43:29] if the Lord will why should we ought to
[43:31] say that because it's not our life to
[43:32] make the decision what we're going to do
[43:35] tomorrow it's God's decision he says but
[43:39] you but now you're rejoicing in your
[43:41] boasting for all such rejoicing he's
[43:43] defines as being evil you're going to
[43:46] take the time that I've given you and
[43:48] then you're going to tell me what you're
[43:49] going to do with
[43:51] it our life is a vapor of Vapor of smoke
[43:57] the whole life 80 years is but a
[44:03] vapor God looks at our life as such a
[44:07] small amount of
[44:10] time it's such a small amount of time
[44:12] our whole life you think about all the
[44:15] things we've done but he looks at it as
[44:17] such a small amount of time the reason I
[44:19] want to bring out this point is if if
[44:22] God expects God has an expectation with
[44:25] the small amount of time that he's given
[44:27] us that we should be able to live it for
[44:29] him
[44:33] amen and that this 80 years or whatever
[44:38] time that he's given us since we've
[44:40] known the Lord that that time needs to
[44:42] be given to
[44:44] him and if we give it to him and we do
[44:47] what he calls us to do to be steadfast
[44:50] unmovable always abounding in the work
[44:52] of the
[44:53] Lord then we'll be called
[44:57] faithful right amen and if we don't then
[45:01] we're literally wasting God's time that
[45:04] he given
[45:05] us have you ever experienced giving
[45:08] someone your time to try to help them or
[45:11] to uh try to teach them or try to get
[45:14] them to do something that you wanted
[45:16] them to do and when you got all done
[45:19] with it you just said well that was a
[45:21] waste of my
[45:23] time absolutely yeah well that's what
[45:28] God is trying to do with
[45:32] us God gives us all his time none of it
[45:37] is ours it's his our life belongs to him
[45:41] our time belongs to him amen and we're
[45:44] all living on the time that God has
[45:46] given to us those that never become
[45:50] fully Born Again truly completely Born
[45:53] Again actually use the time that God's
[45:56] given them for their own
[45:59] life and those that become born again
[46:02] they use the time that God has given him
[46:05] to do God's
[46:06] will is it is that
[46:09] simple turn with me if you would to
[46:12] Matthew 25 I hope you got your Bibles
[46:14] Matthew 25 we got some some b a lot of
[46:17] Bible reading today and I hope that's
[46:23] okay I believe that's what the
[46:25] scriptures are for to to to to make us
[46:32] complete Matthew 25 start with verse 14
[46:35] Jesus speaking here he says for the
[46:37] Kingdom of Heaven is as a man traveling
[46:40] into a far country not a close country
[46:44] but a far who called his own servants
[46:47] and delivered unto them his goods and
[46:51] unto one he gave five talents and to
[46:53] another two and to another one to every
[46:56] man according notice to his several
[47:00] ability and straight way he took his
[47:03] journey then he that had received the
[47:06] five talents went and traded notice
[47:09] traded with the same and made them five
[47:13] other talents now this word traded if
[47:16] you look it up it means to toil to labor
[47:20] to work or to minister
[47:23] about so this ser
[47:26] went and toiled and labored and worked
[47:29] and
[47:31] ministered and we might say is the our
[47:34] opening scripture to be steadfast
[47:36] unmovable always abounding in the work
[47:38] of the Lord amen for as much as you know
[47:40] that your labor is not in vain in the
[47:42] Lord now he traded with what God had
[47:46] given him with someone the same now
[47:50] notice that he traded with the
[47:54] same now if I have five talents and I
[47:58] trade with you five talents you give me
[48:00] five talents and I trade with you five
[48:02] talents I'm still going to have five
[48:04] talents when I'm done I'm not going to
[48:06] have
[48:07] 10 and the only way I'm going to get
[48:11] five talents from you or a a talent from
[48:14] you is to give you something that you
[48:17] want or else you wouldn't
[48:19] trade right I I mean if I have a a a
[48:24] shoe with a hole in it
[48:26] my toll sticks out I can't trade that to
[48:29] you for your card you're going to say
[48:32] I'm not trading you're
[48:35] crazy so this servant had to give
[48:38] something to somebody that was worth
[48:41] getting the talent back from are you
[48:43] with me and likewise he that had
[48:47] received two he also gained other two
[48:50] but he that received one so there was
[48:52] one out of the three Believers that went
[48:55] and died in the earth and hid his Lord's
[48:59] money it was never his to begin with now
[49:03] no this is a type of Our
[49:10] Lives it's not you know God gave us
[49:13] $1,000 Dollar in the bank and let's go
[49:15] see how we can get another
[49:17] thousand it's not what this is
[49:23] about this money never belonged to him
[49:26] in the first place he hid his Lord's
[49:31] money he had he with the money that God
[49:35] gave him with the talent that God gave
[49:37] him with the time that God G with the
[49:39] life that God gave him he had a
[49:41] responsibility to do something with it
[49:45] amen he couldn't get away with just well
[49:48] I didn't do nothing with it I went and
[49:49] hid you know I went and HIIT it now
[49:53] notice verse 19 after a
[49:56] long
[49:58] time another indication is talking about
[50:01] our
[50:02] life after a long time the Lord of those
[50:05] servants cometh and reckon with them he
[50:08] wanted to get account of what happened
[50:12] with what he gave them so he that had
[50:15] received five talents came and brought
[50:17] other five talents saying Lord thou
[50:19] deliver unto me five talents behold I
[50:23] gain beside them five Talent once
[50:26] more his lord said unto him well done
[50:29] thou good and faithful servant thou has
[50:32] been Faithful over a a few
[50:35] things and I will make thee ruler over
[50:39] many things enter thou into the joy of
[50:42] the Lord now you he's speaking at the
[50:44] end when we when we're we have to give
[50:48] an account well we know entering into
[50:50] the joy of the Lord is heaven and we
[50:54] understand that if we over overcome all
[50:56] things that he'll will he'll make us
[50:58] ruler with him we'll sit on the throne
[51:00] so this is referring to the end
[51:03] now so this this good and faithful
[51:06] servant he had to be good with what God
[51:09] gave him in his whole life now remember
[51:11] you got such a short time to live and in
[51:15] God's sight it's just a vapor right it
[51:18] ain't like well I've got 80 years I can
[51:20] put it off and I can you know start
[51:21] working for the
[51:23] no you're going to see
[51:27] we've we've wasted a some of us have
[51:29] wasted a lot of
[51:33] time now he also that received two
[51:36] talents came and said Lord thou deliver
[51:38] unto me two talents behold I have gained
[51:40] two other talents besides them and his
[51:44] lord said unto him well done good and
[51:47] faithful servant thou has been Faithful
[51:48] over a few things and I will make thee
[51:50] ruler over many things enter thou into
[51:53] the joy of the Lord and then he would
[51:55] which had received one Talent came and
[51:57] said Lord I knew that thou w a hard
[52:01] man reaping where thou has not swn and
[52:04] gather where thou has not straw and I
[52:07] was afraid and went and hid thy town in
[52:09] the earth and
[52:11] lo thou
[52:13] has that um there thou has that is
[52:18] thine we don't hide our light under a
[52:22] bushel amen and we don't don't seek to
[52:26] save our life because we're going to
[52:28] lose it and this this man the very fact
[52:31] that he said I was
[52:34] afraid he
[52:37] knew he had a
[52:40] responsibility but he made a
[52:43] choice not to use his life for
[52:48] God and His Lord answered in verse 26
[52:52] and said unto him notice his Lord the
[52:54] one that he
[52:56] professed thou Wicked and slothful
[53:00] servant thou knewest that I reap where I
[53:04] sold not and gather where I have not
[53:10] strawed God did not view this servant as
[53:15] good or
[53:17] faithful
[53:19] amen God viewed this servant as wicked
[53:25] wi and
[53:27] slothful I looked at that word wi Wicked
[53:30] and it means hurtful or evil
[53:36] influence in other words the attitude
[53:38] that he had of just I I don't need to
[53:41] work for the Lord was a hurtful and evil
[53:45] influence to be
[53:46] around and that word slothful simply
[53:49] means lazy or wanting to avoid activity
[53:57] this servant didn't want to
[54:01] work and God God used strong
[54:06] words you know he still went to church
[54:08] he still called him
[54:10] Lord but God viewed him as wicked and
[54:14] slothful there was no like switzeland in
[54:19] between it was you're on one side or the
[54:21] other
[54:23] amen thou all us therefore to have put
[54:27] my money notice he says my money what I
[54:29] gave you to the
[54:31] exchangers and then at my coming I
[54:34] should have received my own with Usery
[54:37] in other words you could have given your
[54:39] life you could have work with somebody
[54:41] who was working for the Lord you could
[54:43] have did something to just work with
[54:45] them help them do what they ask you to
[54:47] do at least I would have got something
[54:49] from your
[54:52] life take therefore the talent from
[54:55] him and give it unto him that has 10
[54:59] talents for unto everyone that have
[55:02] shall it be given and and shall have
[55:04] abundance but from him that have not
[55:07] shall be taken away even that which he
[55:11] have now look at this statement and cast
[55:15] ye the
[55:17] unprofitable servant into outer
[55:22] Darkness there shall be weeping and
[55:25] nashing of
[55:29] teeth
[55:32] unprofitable didn't do God any good just
[55:35] wasted what God gave him gave him this
[55:38] and he wasted it
[55:40] amen became identified as an
[55:42] unprofitable
[55:45] servant and was ordered to cast him into
[55:48] outer
[55:50] Darkness well the Weeping and nashing of
[55:52] teeth this refers or represents the time
[55:56] of the Great
[56:01] Tribulation this is called the parable
[56:03] of the talents but I would like to call
[56:05] it a parable of
[56:08] faithfulness God sees two types of
[56:10] servants here one is faithful and the
[56:13] other is wickedly slothful summed up as
[56:16] unprofitable
[56:18] amen Jesus never used the word
[56:21] Unfaithful
[56:23] servant in fact the word Unfaithful is
[56:27] only used one time in the Bible one time
[56:30] in the whole Bible it's in Proverbs
[56:32] 25:19 if you want to write it down and
[56:34] I'll tell you what it means it means
[56:39] faithlessness faithlessness so there was
[56:41] two types of servants one was full of
[56:43] Faith faithfulness and the other was
[56:46] missing Faith amen he he was he didn't
[56:50] have faith to make a decision I'm going
[56:52] to do what God wants me to do I was
[56:54] afraid afraid to give up my
[56:58] life and an Unfaithful servant is
[57:02] usually lazy or avoids
[57:07] activity we've heard the old
[57:10] story
[57:12] uh would you do something for me well it
[57:15] depends what it is tell me
[57:19] first now this
[57:21] man he
[57:23] knew
[57:25] thou
[57:27] knewest I'm going to tell you
[57:29] this faithfulness is a
[57:33] choice unfaithfulness if we could say
[57:36] that is a choice it's nothing more than
[57:39] a choice he that is faithful and little
[57:41] is faithful and much why is that why can
[57:45] I if if God looks at somebody and says
[57:47] well they're faithful at this little
[57:50] thing well they're going to be faithful
[57:52] in much how is that faith fness is
[57:55] simply a choice that we make yes or no
[57:57] I'm going to do it or I'm not going to
[57:59] do it there's nothing more to it than
[58:02] that if we can do little things in our
[58:04] life then we can do big things as well
[58:07] so whether you have one or two talents
[58:10] or God is giving you 10 or 20
[58:13] faithfulness is simply a choice and
[58:15] nothing more than a choice
[58:18] am now the devil has tricked a lot of
[58:21] people into making excuses about
[58:23] things
[58:25] for some everything becomes an ox in the
[58:29] ditch but it's really not a ditch the
[58:31] Bible says it's a pit because an ox can
[58:34] get in a ditch and get out but if he
[58:37] goes into a
[58:38] pit he can't get out and those pits were
[58:42] used for for holding water and things
[58:44] like that sometimes the covers got
[58:48] off so when
[58:51] people
[58:53] that don't make it to
[58:56] church or they don't pray before service
[58:58] or they don't want to give an
[59:00] offering they're excuses and they think
[59:04] that these excuses makes them exempt
[59:07] from the responsibility that God gave
[59:10] them I know this is strong but I believe
[59:13] in 2024 God wants us to move forward we
[59:17] got to move forward because the things
[59:19] that are attacking us are spirits that
[59:21] are trying to get us to
[59:23] withdraw always remember no matter what
[59:26] excuse we use we made a choice to make
[59:30] that
[59:31] excuse don't make everything about your
[59:33] Ox falling into the
[59:35] pit if you have problems being faithful
[59:38] then make better
[59:40] choices make better choices and don't
[59:43] wait till the till it's too late look
[59:46] ahead if you believe that you're a child
[59:48] of God I believe we
[59:50] do you believe the Bible says that they
[59:53] that are sons of God are L by the spirit
[59:55] of God then you ought to be allowed to
[59:58] stop making excuses and make a better
[1:00:01] plan amen make better choices for your
[1:00:05] life we need to learn from the Holy
[1:00:07] Spirit how to be faithful in just small
[1:00:10] things start really small don't worry
[1:00:13] about all these things that are are
[1:00:15] before you just pick one thing and I'll
[1:00:17] say that one thing be faithful with
[1:00:20] prayer be faithful with prayer be
[1:00:22] faithful to get into the presence of God
[1:00:25] because if you don't get into the
[1:00:26] presence of God there's not going to be
[1:00:27] change in your life am God's presence
[1:00:30] got to be real to you amen remember this
[1:00:33] faithfulness you look at somebody that's
[1:00:35] faithful I'm going to tell you this
[1:00:36] faithfulness is nothing more than a
[1:00:38] choice that we make
[1:00:42] amen I wonder how God feels about our
[1:00:45] excuses you ever wonder let's read about
[1:00:48] it Luke chapter 14 let's start with
[1:00:51] verse 12 Luke Chapter 14 verse number
[1:01:01] 12 then said he also to him that baade
[1:01:04] him when thou makest a dinner or a
[1:01:08] supper call not thy friends and thy
[1:01:12] Brethren neither thy Kinsmen nor thy
[1:01:15] Rich neighbors lest thou also lest
[1:01:19] also lest they also bid thee again and
[1:01:23] recompense be made thee you know a lot
[1:01:27] of times we want to have a get together
[1:01:29] you know who we
[1:01:30] call our
[1:01:32] friends our Brethren our
[1:01:36] Kinsmen or somebody that we can profit
[1:01:40] from
[1:01:42] and and hoping you know that it's going
[1:01:47] to be returned to
[1:01:49] us he says but when you make a feast you
[1:01:53] call the poor you call the man you call
[1:01:55] the lame you call the
[1:01:56] Blind and thou shalt be blessed for they
[1:02:00] cannot recompense thee for Thou shalt be
[1:02:03] recompensed at the resurrection of the
[1:02:06] just so in other words we receive a
[1:02:09] reward on the other side I'm G tell you
[1:02:11] the devil has shcked me on that
[1:02:14] one oh yeah you know because God wants
[1:02:16] us to prosper in this life and you know
[1:02:18] get all these blessings but I'll tell
[1:02:20] you you get a blessing on this side
[1:02:23] you're missing 10 times a what it could
[1:02:24] be on the other side that's all there is
[1:02:27] to
[1:02:28] it just be patient let God reward you on
[1:02:32] the other
[1:02:33] side and when one of them sat at meat
[1:02:37] with him heard these things he said unto
[1:02:40] to Jesus blessed is he that shall eat
[1:02:44] bread in the kingdom of God and then
[1:02:47] said he unto him a certain man b a great
[1:02:52] supper and and he B many
[1:02:55] and sent his servant at supper time to
[1:02:57] say unto them that we're bidden come for
[1:03:00] all things are now ready and they all
[1:03:04] with one consent they began to make
[1:03:07] excuse for the first said I bought a
[1:03:10] piece of ground and I must go and I must
[1:03:14] go and see it I pray have me excuse now
[1:03:19] notice in their
[1:03:20] prayer God forgive me I can't make it to
[1:03:24] church
[1:03:25] God I'm sorry I got here light I I don't
[1:03:28] I don't I I I I I don't have time to go
[1:03:31] on the I you know I just I don't have
[1:03:33] any more money this week I can't give an
[1:03:36] offering please have me
[1:03:39] excused and another said I have bought
[1:03:42] five yolk of oxen and I go to prove them
[1:03:44] I pray have me
[1:03:47] excused and another said I have married
[1:03:50] a
[1:03:51] wife and therefore I cannot come in
[1:03:55] other words I don't even need to pray to
[1:03:57] get excused on this one because this is
[1:04:00] you know no matter what I married a wife
[1:04:02] and I am I just can't
[1:04:06] come so that servant came and showed his
[1:04:10] Lord these things this is what's
[1:04:13] happening then the master of the house
[1:04:15] being angry notice he was
[1:04:18] angry about the
[1:04:20] excuses he was angry about the excuses
[1:04:24] now this is what God thinks about our
[1:04:26] excuses we think we're okay because
[1:04:28] we've laid out an
[1:04:30] excuse look you may never tell me and I
[1:04:33] may never ask you but to God the excuses
[1:04:35] makes him
[1:04:36] angry you have one life it belongs to
[1:04:39] God you ought to live it for God am
[1:04:42] that's all there is to
[1:04:49] it then the master of the house being
[1:04:51] angry said to his servants go out
[1:04:54] quickly into the streets into the lanes
[1:04:56] of the city and bring in hither the poor
[1:04:58] and the main and the Halt and the
[1:05:02] blind even though the Lord was angry
[1:05:04] about
[1:05:07] those that made excuses his first
[1:05:10] attention went to The Obedience of those
[1:05:14] to go get others focus on getting others
[1:05:17] to Christ focus on getting others
[1:05:21] saved God will deal with the slothful
[1:05:25] and the excuses at the end and the
[1:05:27] servant said Lord it is done as thou has
[1:05:30] commanded and yet there's room and the
[1:05:32] Lord said unto the servant go onto the
[1:05:34] highways and hedges and compel them to
[1:05:36] come in that my house may be filled for
[1:05:40] I say unto you that none of those men
[1:05:42] which were bidden shall even
[1:05:45] taste of my
[1:05:47] supper the ones that made
[1:05:50] excuses are the ones that didn't get to
[1:05:53] taste of the marriage supper of the
[1:05:57] Lamb I'll say like this let's start
[1:06:01] looking at our excuses and call them out
[1:06:04] for what they are I'm going to tell you
[1:06:06] they're not oxes in the ditch all the
[1:06:08] time or oxes in the pit they're not hey
[1:06:11] if you're if you can't start your car
[1:06:13] and there's no way to get to work and
[1:06:15] you've called somebody to ask or you
[1:06:17] called somebody not to get to work but
[1:06:19] to come to church and you called
[1:06:21] somebody they ask for a ride and you
[1:06:23] can't get there you know I think God
[1:06:26] understands but you start taking that
[1:06:29] and you start using that as an example
[1:06:31] why you just can't be faithful in your
[1:06:33] life you know what you're doing you're
[1:06:35] taking the one thing that God has given
[1:06:38] you and not being faithful to him
[1:06:42] with you know you you may think you've
[1:06:44] got tons of years to get start getting
[1:06:46] faithful but you don't in God sight he
[1:06:48] looks at you as an hour and 50 m 55
[1:06:51] minutes it's a vapor
[1:06:55] he didn't give you 300 years down here
[1:06:57] to live faithful he only gave you a
[1:07:00] short time and he expects you to live
[1:07:02] faithful to him
[1:07:05] amen I want to say this you can't get
[1:07:08] faithfulness
[1:07:10] back write that down you cannot get
[1:07:13] faithfulness back you can be
[1:07:16] forgiven you can get justification back
[1:07:19] but you can't get faithfulness
[1:07:22] back you have just One Life to prove to
[1:07:25] God you're faithful and you got to prove
[1:07:27] it with your life
[1:07:29] amen you can sin for a while and when
[1:07:33] you're done sinning you can ask God to
[1:07:35] forgive you and if you're sincere the
[1:07:39] Bible says if you confess your sins he
[1:07:41] is faithful and just to forgive us of
[1:07:43] our sins and to cleanse us from all
[1:07:46] unrighteousness so we can become
[1:07:48] justified in the sight of God just as if
[1:07:50] we never did it to begin with
[1:07:54] but we cannot ever become faithful when
[1:07:58] we haven't been faithful I want that to
[1:08:00] sink
[1:08:01] in it's a strong comment but
[1:08:05] look you when it when it came down at
[1:08:09] the end Jesus looked at their life and
[1:08:11] they had to give an account what they
[1:08:13] did with their life amen this is what I
[1:08:16] got to give you this is what I'm showing
[1:08:18] you there's no excuse that yeah I was
[1:08:21] afraid no I don't care if you're afraid
[1:08:23] and I don't care that time that God
[1:08:25] gives us is for his
[1:08:28] kingdom you can't get it back you can't
[1:08:31] get time back that means you can't get a
[1:08:34] a an opportunity to be faithful when you
[1:08:36] already wasted
[1:08:42] it we only have one life to use the time
[1:08:46] that God has given each of
[1:08:48] us if we end up using on ourselves we'll
[1:08:52] end up wasting God's
[1:08:55] time it's God's time and I want us you
[1:08:59] know the Bible says teach us to number
[1:09:02] our days you know there's wisdom in in
[1:09:04] numbering our days there's wisdom in
[1:09:06] realizing that the time that you're
[1:09:07] using right now don't belong you it
[1:09:09] belongs to God are you going to use it
[1:09:11] for him or you going to use it for you
[1:09:13] now look there is a difference
[1:09:15] between look we all have to work we all
[1:09:18] have to cut the
[1:09:21] grass we all have to shovel the snow
[1:09:23] when we get
[1:09:25] it today I walked out of the
[1:09:28] steps and I tell you see I I hit that
[1:09:32] steps and I just went I landed Brother
[1:09:36] Bruce I I was there for a while the pain
[1:09:38] was so great that I could not move it
[1:09:40] was so
[1:09:42] great so sometimes we have to Salt the
[1:09:48] steps but you know there is
[1:09:52] nothing that we should ever put before
[1:09:55] the work of the Lord
[1:09:58] nothing it must come first Colossians
[1:10:02] 1:16 says for by him were all things
[1:10:06] created that are in heaven that are in
[1:10:08] Earth visible invisible whether they be
[1:10:10] Thrones dominions principalities or
[1:10:12] Powers all things were created by Him
[1:10:15] and notice for him right that means I
[1:10:20] and you were created for him I was was
[1:10:23] not created for trust a to I was not
[1:10:27] created for the customers that trusted
[1:10:29] two
[1:10:30] serves I was created for God Amen so
[1:10:34] whether I work at McDonald's or I work
[1:10:37] at trusted
[1:10:39] two I belong to God my time belongs to
[1:10:43] God so I wonder what is the purpose that
[1:10:46] he created us
[1:10:48] for so when I walked into church tonight
[1:10:50] I looked at the little calendar over
[1:10:53] there
[1:10:54] Ephesians 2:10 was on there so I'm going
[1:10:56] to write that down for we are his
[1:10:59] workmanship right created in Christ
[1:11:02] Jesus unto good works now I love this
[1:11:06] part which God have
[1:11:09] before ordained that we should walk in
[1:11:12] them that's right this was his plan that
[1:11:16] he could take our lives and use it for
[1:11:18] his glory right so the more filled we
[1:11:22] are with the whole Holy Spirit I believe
[1:11:24] the more that we'll be using the time
[1:11:27] that God has given us for his
[1:11:31] purpose if we end up using his time or
[1:11:35] the time he has given us for our lives
[1:11:37] then we will lose the only
[1:11:40] chance that we have to be considered
[1:11:45] faithful by
[1:11:52] God look when it comes down to it is he
[1:11:55] going to just say I I'm faithful and I
[1:11:58] was good because I was covered by the
[1:12:00] blood because I ask for
[1:12:03] forgiveness no he's going to look at my
[1:12:06] life and the decisions I made every day
[1:12:09] with my
[1:12:11] time he's looking at the whole the whole
[1:12:14] thing which to us is a big thing but to
[1:12:18] him it's a vapor right amen it's it's
[1:12:22] nothing to him
[1:12:24] how can you compare our lives with
[1:12:27] eternity you we could live to
[1:12:30] 120 but it's a
[1:12:32] vapor it's nothing and he has this
[1:12:36] expectation that your time is his time
[1:12:40] your life is his
[1:12:42] life and we need to live it for him I'll
[1:12:46] tell you I I want him to say faithful to
[1:12:50] me I want to hear thou faithful
[1:12:55] I know there's nothing good in me
[1:12:57] outside of what is
[1:13:00] God but I have a choice to make whether
[1:13:03] I'm going to be faithful to the word of
[1:13:05] God or I'm not going to
[1:13:09] be brother brandom said in the message I
[1:13:11] know my redeemer liveth he says and we
[1:13:14] come on such a morning to gather hopes
[1:13:18] some new hopes of what we are here for
[1:13:21] and what is the purpose and I think that
[1:13:25] this is a wonderful time to think on the
[1:13:27] hopes that God has given us now we want
[1:13:31] to draw this first into our minds that
[1:13:35] there is not one thing that can destroy
[1:13:38] us until the purpose of he who has
[1:13:40] created us has been
[1:13:43] fulfilled I love that quote there could
[1:13:46] be nothing we are made for a purpose
[1:13:50] this church was built here for a purpose
[1:13:53] this Foundation was not dug or the
[1:13:57] Cornerstone laid or the blocks laid into
[1:13:59] the building in the roof and the
[1:14:01] interior was not put there just to see
[1:14:05] if it could be done it was put there for
[1:14:08] a purpose for a purpose now in the world
[1:14:12] hey they don't even know why they're
[1:14:14] born they don't even know why they're
[1:14:17] alive but we know God chose us one out
[1:14:19] of a million that we got a purpose
[1:14:22] that's right and that purpose is to
[1:14:24] fulfill his will we got to get serious
[1:14:27] about it we got to spend some time about
[1:14:29] it Lord help me to be faithful with the
[1:14:31] few things you've given me in my life
[1:14:34] right now everyone has a distinct role
[1:14:36] to
[1:14:37] play No Doubt God has equipped all of us
[1:14:41] with what we need to carry out a role
[1:14:44] amen 1 Corinthians 12:11 says God has
[1:14:48] divided up gifts to every man severally
[1:14:52] as he will so he just gives us some two
[1:14:54] some 10 some one he's given us what we
[1:14:57] need so God has given us all of us he's
[1:15:00] given us one
[1:15:02] time we've all got
[1:15:05] time and he's given us different
[1:15:08] abilities and different gifts but he's
[1:15:10] given us all one time amen and that's
[1:15:13] what we got to be faithful
[1:15:15] to well I'll say it like this if you
[1:15:19] give your time to God you will give your
[1:15:21] gifts to God you will give your talents
[1:15:23] to God yes you will be let God use you
[1:15:26] in any way he sees fit I always like
[1:15:28] what the god a minister said one time
[1:15:32] uh I think some Minister said it I don't
[1:15:35] know but I know I've said
[1:15:37] it God don't want your wallet he wants
[1:15:41] your heart if he gets your heart he'll
[1:15:42] get your
[1:15:43] wallet he'll get everything with you
[1:15:46] amen now no one can take our place no
[1:15:50] man can do the job that God has ordained
[1:15:52] you to do
[1:15:54] now we will either be found faithful or
[1:15:57] Unfaithful in what he has purposed in
[1:16:00] our lives now that's just the bottom
[1:16:02] line the blood is not going to cover it
[1:16:06] the blood is not going to say okay well
[1:16:09] uh you you were uh you're all
[1:16:19] faithful if we're faithful then let's be
[1:16:22] faithful amen come on if we're faithful
[1:16:25] then let's just be faithful amen let's
[1:16:27] not be unfaithful and then say we're
[1:16:30] faithful let's be a Christian let's be
[1:16:34] real about it right now I don't know
[1:16:36] what God has ordained you to do but I do
[1:16:38] know it's
[1:16:40] something God would never ordain us to
[1:16:43] sit around spiritually
[1:16:45] idle God has expressed in his word that
[1:16:48] he wants us to occupy until he
[1:16:52] comes so therefore my beloved Brethren
[1:16:55] be ye steadfast unmovable always
[1:16:58] abounding not in your work but the work
[1:17:01] of the Lord for as much as you know that
[1:17:03] your labor is not in vain in the Lord
[1:17:06] but I tell you if the Lord ain't in it
[1:17:08] in other words you make the wrong choice
[1:17:10] don't expect God to bless
[1:17:12] it I mean don't work Sundays and
[1:17:20] say don't work Sundays if you're not
[1:17:23] told you have to work Sundays and if you
[1:17:25] are told to work Sundays then you need
[1:17:27] to check to see if God doesn't have
[1:17:29] something better for you because he
[1:17:30] don't want you to work
[1:17:34] Sundays the thing is sometimes we have
[1:17:37] to but you know what some of us begin to
[1:17:41] make excuses of what we're going to do
[1:17:43] on the
[1:17:44] Sabbath be
[1:17:46] faithful be faithful the word encourages
[1:17:49] us to be faithful to the
[1:17:52] word now we only have one chance at
[1:17:55] life to fulfill his purpose to be found
[1:18:01] faithful now we believe that we've been
[1:18:04] called to
[1:18:05] live a life of service for the Lord the
[1:18:08] brother Ram says that eternal life is
[1:18:09] living for others amen now God doesn't
[1:18:13] want us to just do things for God he
[1:18:17] wants a service to him a life to him
[1:18:21] there's a big difference between I'm
[1:18:23] going to do this for God I'm going to do
[1:18:25] that for God then I'm going to go live
[1:18:26] my
[1:18:27] life that is not a faithful
[1:18:32] servant I want God to deal with our
[1:18:34] hearts of course there's many that are
[1:18:36] not here and I hope that there's people
[1:18:38] listening this sermon that has never
[1:18:41] been in this church
[1:18:44] before because I believe it's the
[1:18:47] truth God doesn't want us to occupy with
[1:18:50] our own things he want us to occupy with
[1:18:52] the things of God
[1:18:54] we were created for his glory his
[1:18:56] purpose and to do the things that he
[1:18:57] wants us to do you know we hardly have
[1:19:01] time to fit God in our lives especially
[1:19:04] around the holidays
[1:19:06] right you know I wish there was you know
[1:19:08] more people here that just say Amen but
[1:19:10] you know what we could what we could do
[1:19:12] is we could just say Amen a little bit
[1:19:13] more than it would help you
[1:19:16] know the Bible says look not every man
[1:19:19] on his own things but every man also on
[1:19:22] the things of others amen that's what I
[1:19:24] liked about you know brother Bruce going
[1:19:26] to see brother Johnson he was looking on
[1:19:29] another man's
[1:19:32] things Paul said let this mind be in you
[1:19:36] which was also in Christ Jesus we need
[1:19:39] the mind of Christ we need to see things
[1:19:41] the way the scriptures are teaching us
[1:19:43] to see
[1:19:44] them if we stay
[1:19:47] occupied with our own life or doing our
[1:19:51] own things in our life
[1:19:53] what's going to happen is we're going to
[1:19:56] miss what God has for us we're going to
[1:20:00] miss the very purpose that he ordained
[1:20:02] us for 1 Corinthians 1:7 says so that ye
[1:20:06] come
[1:20:08] behind in no gift that's right I love
[1:20:12] this scripture so that you come behind
[1:20:14] in no
[1:20:16] gift waiting for the coming of our Lord
[1:20:19] Jesus he don't want you to come behind
[1:20:21] in any gift that he's given
[1:20:23] you he wants you to use what he's given
[1:20:26] you amen who shall also confirm you unto
[1:20:30] the end that ye may be blameless in the
[1:20:33] day of the Lord Jesus Christ God is
[1:20:36] faithful by whom you were called unto
[1:20:38] the fellowship of his son Jesus Christ
[1:20:40] Our Lord amen turn with me to Luke
[1:20:43] Chapter
[1:20:44] 191 we got some more scriptures to get
[1:20:47] through and I just I want the Lord
[1:20:51] to give us timed about to get through
[1:20:54] them that means I need to go through
[1:20:56] them
[1:20:59] quicker and I'll go through quicker if
[1:21:01] you say Amen
[1:21:03] quicker all right Luke 19
[1:21:06] vers1 and as they heard these things he
[1:21:09] added and spake a parable because he was
[1:21:12] nigh to Jerusalem because they thought
[1:21:15] the kingdom of God should immediately
[1:21:16] appear and he said unto them a certain
[1:21:19] noble man went into again a far country
[1:21:22] to re receive for himself a kingdom and
[1:21:24] to
[1:21:26] return and he called his 10 servants and
[1:21:29] delivered them 10 pounds that's one
[1:21:32] pound per servant not five two and one
[1:21:36] but each one got one this time and said
[1:21:39] unto them I want you to occupy till I
[1:21:43] get
[1:21:45] back but now notice but the citizens
[1:21:48] hated him and sent a message after him
[1:21:50] saying we will not have this man to rule
[1:21:53] over us so this this message here is
[1:21:56] really
[1:21:57] indicating that these servants who had
[1:22:01] to go and occupy were really dwelling in
[1:22:04] a city of of great selfishness that
[1:22:07] people did not want the Lord Jesus to
[1:22:09] Reign Over their hearts so it wasn't an
[1:22:12] easy task for them to do are you with
[1:22:16] me and it came to pass as they
[1:22:20] went uh and it came to pass that when he
[1:22:22] was returned having received the kingdom
[1:22:26] then he commanded these servants to be
[1:22:28] called unto him to whom he had given the
[1:22:31] money that he might know how much every
[1:22:35] man had gained by here it is again
[1:22:39] trading so God is expecting these 10
[1:22:43] servants to trade what was delivered
[1:22:45] unto them for something
[1:22:49] more now there's no way that God was
[1:22:51] expecting these t servants to be to
[1:22:54] learn how to be stock
[1:22:57] Brokers to to to know how to to to to
[1:23:01] take money and get money I'm sorry we're
[1:23:04] not all called to do that some of us are
[1:23:07] just just simple Carpenters we don't
[1:23:10] know anything about money we don't know
[1:23:12] how to be a stock broker or to go into
[1:23:15] trading so this is not what he's talking
[1:23:18] about he's talking about
[1:23:21] time
[1:23:23] time occupy till I
[1:23:27] come and that word occupy to means to
[1:23:30] busy oneself or to trade oneself not
[1:23:35] money Amen to trade
[1:23:39] oneself will you keep your time for
[1:23:42] yourself or will you trade it to
[1:23:44] spiritually build the kingdom of God
[1:23:46] just think about it what one thing can
[1:23:49] you
[1:23:50] give to someone that you'll get
[1:23:55] back you give your life to present
[1:23:58] Christ to somebody and if they accept
[1:24:00] Christ then you win them that is a Jew
[1:24:03] in your crown that is what God looks at
[1:24:06] as a faithful
[1:24:11] servant then came the first saying Lord
[1:24:15] thy pound have gained 10
[1:24:18] pounds and he said unto them wow thou
[1:24:21] good ser vant now notice this because
[1:24:25] thou has been faithful here is the whole
[1:24:29] reason that God is calling him a good
[1:24:32] servant is because he was
[1:24:36] faithful he was faithful in a little
[1:24:39] have thou authority over 10 cities amen
[1:24:45] and the second came saying Lord thy
[1:24:48] pound have gained five pounds this one
[1:24:51] life G gained five the other one that
[1:24:54] one life gained 10 and he said likewise
[1:24:58] to him be thou also over five
[1:25:01] cities Jesus says behold I come quickly
[1:25:04] my reward is with me to give every man
[1:25:07] according to his
[1:25:10] work and another came saying Lord behold
[1:25:13] here is thy bound I've kept it light up
[1:25:16] in a
[1:25:17] napkin for I feared because Thou Art in
[1:25:22] Austria man thou take us up where thou
[1:25:25] layest not down and rapest where thou
[1:25:27] this not
[1:25:28] s and he saith unto him out of thine own
[1:25:32] mouth will I judge thee notice out of
[1:25:38] his own mouth and he says Thou Wicked
[1:25:41] servant now he didn't
[1:25:43] take this one thing and go kill
[1:25:50] himself he didn't just
[1:25:53] put it in the
[1:25:55] dumpster and it was destroyed he took it
[1:25:59] and he wrapped his own will in his life
[1:26:03] he did what he wanted to
[1:26:06] do and God viewed that as a wicked
[1:26:13] servant thou knewest what I expected
[1:26:17] that I was an Austra a man make taking
[1:26:19] up that I laid not down reaping that I
[1:26:23] did not sow wherefore thou gavest
[1:26:26] wherefore then gavest not thou my money
[1:26:29] into the bank that at my coming I might
[1:26:32] have required my own with
[1:26:35] Usery why don't we just give we don't
[1:26:38] know what to do ask somebody who's
[1:26:40] working for the Lord what you can
[1:26:42] do because honestly God can lead every
[1:26:45] one of us to go to a soul we don't
[1:26:48] really need to be told by anybody what
[1:26:50] to do we just need to go do it
[1:26:53] we can't be afraid of of of being turned
[1:26:55] down we can't be afraid that we're going
[1:26:57] to get rejected we can't be afraid well
[1:26:59] I'm not going to be able to watch my
[1:27:00] favorite TV
[1:27:02] show we just need to be faithful amen
[1:27:05] amen to God it's his life it ain't mine
[1:27:08] these are not my words these are God's
[1:27:10] words amen and he said unto them that
[1:27:13] stood by take from him the pound and
[1:27:16] give it to him that had 10 pounds and
[1:27:18] they said unto him Lord we don't
[1:27:21] understand he already has 10 PB for I
[1:27:24] say unto you that unto everyone which
[1:27:27] have shall be given and for him that
[1:27:29] have not even that he have shall be
[1:27:33] taken away from him but those mine
[1:27:37] enemies which would not that I should
[1:27:40] Reign Over them bring hither and
[1:27:43] I bring hither and slay them before me
[1:27:47] can you believe that this God of
[1:27:51] love
[1:27:53] is going to actually slay the ones that
[1:27:57] would not let him rule in their
[1:28:01] heart one day every knee is going to Bow
[1:28:03] every tongue's going to confess that
[1:28:05] Jesus Christ is Lord at that time it's
[1:28:08] too late but he'll still expect it you
[1:28:11] notice that he'll raise them up in that
[1:28:13] day and at that day they have to do it
[1:28:15] but it won't you
[1:28:17] know because his word cannot return void
[1:28:21] amen amen it cannot return void but now
[1:28:24] look we have a chance to serve god with
[1:28:26] our lives it it it's it's it's just not
[1:28:29] Church attendance it's just not giving
[1:28:31] ties it's it's it's your whole life and
[1:28:35] God is wanting you to take the talents
[1:28:37] the time the ability everything that God
[1:28:40] has placed in your heart and in your
[1:28:42] life to use it for a for to go win a
[1:28:45] soul for him that's it is that's all
[1:28:49] that matters and I'll tell you when you
[1:28:50] do it you'll get all heaven rejoicing
[1:28:53] amen all heaven will be rejoicing
[1:28:55] because of what you

[1:29:08] the time that God's given we don't even

[1:34:24] expectation God looks at us is mature
[1:34:27] enough to set time aside to go work for
[1:34:30] the
[1:34:30] Lord and if we do our life will be
[1:34:34] faithful and if we don't do
[1:34:36] that we won't be faithful and those are
[1:34:39] the choices that we have I I hope that
[1:34:43] this word has spoke to our hearts amen
[1:34:46] amen this is not a calling out of who's
[1:34:49] faithful and who's not what this is a is
[1:34:51] a calling out for God wanting us to be
[1:34:54] faithful that's what this word is and
[1:34:56] showing in the scriptures that we have
[1:34:57] to give an account for our lives amen
