[40:38] the father's
[40:39] Vision but it's a little bit we're take

[40:46] and for a subject walking in the
[40:48] father's
[40:49] Vision uh Jesus said this when he was
[40:52] talking about the coming of the Lord he
[40:55] said blessed is that that servant whom
[40:58] his Lord when he cometh shall find so
[41:03] doing so at the coming of the Lord God
[41:07] bless you Sister
[41:09] Judy at the coming of the lord we want
[41:12] to be doing what God wants us to be
[41:15] doing amen and I believe that is Walking
[41:19] In God's Eternal Vision that he had from
[41:22] the beginning and now this vision is so
[41:25] important because if there is no vision
[41:29] if people don't have a vision if we
[41:31] don't see God's Vision then then people
[41:34] are going to perish so this Vision has
[41:37] to be to be made known God has always
[41:41] wanted a family
[41:43] amen that's why he made man in his own
[41:46] image the Angels wasn't good enough and
[41:50] he didn't want just any old family but
[41:53] one that would walk in his character act
[41:56] like him handle obstacles and situations
[41:59] just the way he does Bible says that God
[42:03] is love so I believe that God wants his
[42:06] family to be a family of
[42:09] love God wanted to be a Jehovah father
[42:12] that would be able to provide everything
[42:15] that his family needed
[42:18] unfortunately uh with man being made in
[42:20] God's image and everything being perfect
[42:22] there was just attributes swelled up in
[42:25] God that he would never be able to
[42:26] express so he had to allow man to fall
[42:30] and man who was uh the the highest form
[42:34] the highest form that he had created
[42:37] amen uh became the most needful creature
[42:41] after the fall right and that opened the
[42:45] door for for for the father to be a a
[42:48] savior a redeemer A Healer a counselor a
[42:51] provider for his family to direct and
[42:54] lead to correct his family to come
[42:57] Comfort them to discipline them that
[42:59] they could walk together and be a family
[43:01] and grow and mature as as we all have
[43:04] had children and we want to see the same
[43:06] thing we don't we certainly don't never
[43:08] wanted our our children to to to go to
[43:12] to somebody else and say you know my
[43:14] father couldn't really handle it and I
[43:16] really I I see you handling being more
[43:19] of a father than my father no father
[43:22] would ever want to hear that right so it
[43:25] was in God's desire that he would be
[43:27] able to fulfill every need that we could
[43:30] ever have now because of of the Fall men
[43:35] began to be born out of the will of
[43:38] God they were born of another seed in
[43:42] other words it wasn't by the will of God
[43:45] but it was mixed in with man's will so
[43:48] it became a high-bred seed it wasn't by
[43:51] the spoken word of God like he created
[43:53] everything else and it's through this
[43:56] perverted Act
[43:57] that the the will of man was born as it
[44:00] were separated from God there was a
[44:03] separation and that is why man has to
[44:06] become born again if a man does not
[44:09] become Born Again correctly by the by if
[44:12] I could say it like this by the Spoken
[44:14] Word by God willing it by God speaking
[44:17] it we cannot enter the kingdom of God
[44:20] and I'll say it like this we our nature
[44:23] cannot be changed unless God wills it
[44:27] there's nothing inside of a man to to
[44:30] change his nature he can't even tame his
[44:32] own tongue it takes the power of God in
[44:34] a man to change
[44:37] him God provided a way he went to
[44:41] Calvary number one first to pay for our
[44:44] sins amen and then he sent back the Holy
[44:48] Ghost Upon Us in that Holy Ghost is what
[44:53] changes our nature from being worldly to
[44:57] being Godly
[44:58] amen now out in the world God is the
[45:02] only one that knows who's who not
[45:05] everybody belongs to God not everybody
[45:08] is a part of the family of God but God
[45:11] has been gathering together in every age
[45:14] his his elect uh through each Age and
[45:18] and this is the the vision that God has
[45:21] had and we see it here in Ephesians
[45:23] we're going to be a lot in Ephesians
[45:24] today this morning Ephesians chapter 1
[45:26] vers vers 10 says that in the
[45:28] dispensation of the fullness of time he
[45:31] might gather together in one all things
[45:36] in Christ that's right both which are in
[45:40] heaven those that have gone on before
[45:43] now they're in heaven right which and
[45:45] which are on earth those that's us and
[45:48] those that have not yet come in even in
[45:52] him there's the criteria his family is
[45:55] all into Christ amen
[45:58] no Jesus has been searching for his
[46:01] family through every age and he's been
[46:05] converting them to his own
[46:09] nature Matthew 4:
[46:13] 18 and Jesus walking by the Sea of
[46:17] Galilee he saw two Brethren Simon called
[46:19] Peter and Andrew his brother they were
[46:22] casting a net into the sea for they were
[46:25] Fishers amen and he saith unto them
[46:28] follow me and I will make you Fishers of
[46:32] Men and straightway they left their Nets
[46:36] and followed
[46:38] him now there there wasn't really
[46:40] anything more to it than
[46:43] that but what's so ironic about this is
[46:47] that there was already something inside
[46:49] of Peter and Andrew that represented or
[46:53] that rep recognized the call when it was
[46:55] spoken amen there was no need they
[47:00] didn't say well Jesus show me your
[47:03] credentials you have to prove to me this
[47:05] is the right thing for me to do before I
[47:07] follow you you need to show me a sign or
[47:11] I need to go home and I need to talk to
[47:13] my family or talk to my neighbors or
[47:15] talk to those I've Got Confidence in
[47:17] first and and see what they have to say
[47:19] and get their opinions before I make
[47:21] this decision no the Bible says they Dro
[47:24] their Nets and straightway they followed
[47:27] him and the only thing he said was
[47:29] follow
[47:32] me
[47:34] wow what was he doing he was gathering
[47:37] together those that belonged to him
[47:42] amen most people think that he would
[47:45] have been they would have been insane to
[47:47] do that but there was something in
[47:50] already inside of them a spiritual seed
[47:54] that
[47:55] recognized truth
[47:57] truth and that is the voice of God truth
[48:01] is the voice of God when pilate was
[48:04] trying to figure out who Jesus was Jesus
[48:06] said to him in John 18:37 to this end
[48:10] was I born for this cause came I into
[48:12] the world that I should bear witness
[48:14] unto the truth and every one that is of
[48:20] the truth heareth my voice that's right
[48:23] I just love that little scripture
[48:26] everyone that is of the truth heareth my
[48:30] voice amen and if you're not of the
[48:34] truth it's just going to be well that's
[48:36] just your opinion amen that's just what
[48:39] you think I me I just go find another
[48:42] church I I'll just believe you know
[48:44] there's so many churches out there with
[48:45] so many different
[48:47] beliefs Jesus said in John chapter 10 he
[48:52] that he calleth his own Sheep by name
[48:55] Peter Andrew John
[48:58] Ben Ron Charlie Mike he calleth them by
[49:03] name
[49:05] amen and leadth them
[49:09] out and the Sheep follow him for they
[49:12] know his
[49:16] voice who taught that to
[49:19] him inside there's a bearing of witness
[49:23] and he he said in John 10:16 and other
[49:26] sheep I have which are not of this
[49:30] fold them also I must bring in and they
[49:33] shall hear my voice and there shall be
[49:36] one fold and one Shepherd so he's
[49:39] gathering together this is the vision of
[49:41] God to gather his family together amen
[49:45] there's already a connection between God
[49:47] and his people it's a spiritual seed
[49:50] inside of them and they recognize the
[49:53] voice of the call of God's call and they
[49:56] just they just follow Jesus said many
[49:59] are called but few are
[50:02] chosen so everybody gets a
[50:06] chance but only a few are
[50:09] chosen in other words there's only a few
[50:12] that straightway drop their Nets leave
[50:14] their Pro their profession leave their
[50:16] family and they start following Christ
[50:18] with all their heart
[50:21] amen Peter heard the call from
[50:24] Heaven man okay let's follow on Matthew
[50:27] 4:21 and going on from then he saw other
[50:31] two
[50:32] Brethren James the son of zebede and
[50:35] John his brother in a ship with Zebedee
[50:38] their father mending their
[50:41] Nets doing their job it was their
[50:43] business and he called them and
[50:47] immediately they immediately left the
[50:52] ship and their father and followed him
[50:56] amen
[50:57] the call was so strong that they left
[51:00] their family they left their business
[51:04] and they started following amen wow
[51:07] that's
[51:09] strong there's something inside of these
[51:12] men that responded from the call that
[51:16] was from heaven and what that was was
[51:19] there was a part a small part of Heaven
[51:22] inside of them already they just didn't
[51:25] know it amen they didn't know
[51:29] it and we didn't know it
[51:32] either Matthew 9:9 and as Jesus passed
[51:37] forth from then he saw a man named
[51:39] Matthew sitting at the receipt of
[51:41] customs and he saith unto him follow me
[51:45] and he rose and followed him notice in
[51:48] these incidences there's nothing going
[51:50] on about let's talk about this I'm just
[51:52] not so weirdo that's just going to
[51:54] follow somebody
[51:58] amen I just love that I love that you
[52:01] know we are not weird we just know where
[52:04] we came
[52:05] from we just know who we belong to Luke
[52:10] 527 I like how it said here and after
[52:13] these things he went forth and saw a
[52:15] Publican named Levi sitting at the
[52:18] receit of customs and he said unto me
[52:20] follow me and he left all I love this
[52:23] way he left all rose up and followed
[52:26] followed him then he went home and had a
[52:27] great feast invited more publicans to to
[52:33] to help out and uh and we're coming in
[52:37] for another we're going to have two of
[52:39] these
[52:40] babies we're we're we're spreading we're
[52:43] spreading we want to spread it more
[52:46] twice as much
[52:50] amen all right so we can't get them with
[52:54] these two and this you know it's just
[52:55] meant for us that's all I can
[52:58] say John
[53:00] 1:43 the day following Jesus would go
[53:03] forth into Galilee and findeth Phillip
[53:06] and saith unto him follow
[53:09] me wow I just want you to think when God
[53:13] called you when God first spoke to
[53:17] you he's hid in Simplicity and revealed
[53:20] in the same amen there was a woman of
[53:24] Samaria and Jesus said I must needs go
[53:27] by
[53:27] Samaria he had a burden to give her the
[53:31] gospel now this woman as we know she had
[53:34] a bad reputation
[53:37] because she had a a number of different
[53:41] husbands in her
[53:43] life but yet there was a seed inside of
[53:50] her and when the gospel was ministered
[53:54] to her she
[53:57] recognized and she followed in fact she
[54:00] was so happy that she just had to go
[54:02] tell others
[54:04] amen come see a man that told me all
[54:07] that I've ever done amen all these had a
[54:10] representation of Truth inside of them
[54:14] and everyone that is of the truth Hearth
[54:17] my voice Jesus said Paul was another one
[54:22] the Bible says he was born out of due
[54:24] season but this was a man that you
[54:26] wouldn't think he was a a real loving
[54:29] Christian because at one time he was
[54:31] against the church he persecuted the
[54:32] church he wasted it he was he was about
[54:38] killing he was a man that had more
[54:41] education uh but yet he didn't even know
[54:44] God he really didn't have a personal
[54:46] relationship with
[54:48] God but he knew all these
[54:51] scriptures but he still didn't know
[54:54] them one day
[54:56] Paul heard the real voice of Jesus and
[55:01] his life was never the same but you know
[55:03] what Paul had to do like everybody else
[55:05] that we read he had to forsake
[55:09] all the Bible says that he suffered the
[55:11] loss of all things to follow
[55:16] Christ God's vision and eternal purpose
[55:19] in the dispensation of the fullness of
[55:21] times he might gather together in one
[55:24] all things in Christ both which are in
[55:27] heaven and which are on earth even in
[55:30] him and this is what God is still doing
[55:34] today he's Gathering his elect
[55:39] amen I think about the ones that he
[55:42] gathered in the first church age that
[55:47] you know they they didn't have all the
[55:49] light that we had but yet they're just
[55:53] as much Bride As we are amen
[55:56] the next age there was a little bit more
[55:58] light so God required a little bit more
[56:01] light and every age there became more
[56:05] light and God required of of them and in
[56:08] this age all the light is required amen
[56:12] all the light so we have to we have to
[56:15] live by every word of God we got to love
[56:17] every word of God we got to want to see
[56:19] that every word manifested inside of
[56:22] us now we are in the fullness of times
[56:25] we're at the end
[56:29] he gathered you and I out of this
[56:31] world we heard him say follow me and we
[56:35] forsook our dreams I had
[56:39] dreams we we forsook our plans our
[56:41] Ambitions what we were going to do oh I
[56:44] I I have a list of things that I was
[56:45] going to do and I also have a list of
[56:48] things that I was never going to do and
[56:51] they just didn't you know God didn't
[56:52] really care about any of that right
[56:55] because we are not born to our will
[56:58] anymore we've been born by the will of
[56:59] God and that's what becomes important to
[57:01] the
[57:03] Christian just like his
[57:06] disciples they recklessly abandoned
[57:08] everything we recklessly abandoned
[57:11] everything to follow God Amen there was
[57:13] no debate we didn't ask for
[57:17] proof we just dropped what we were doing
[57:20] and we started following Christ because
[57:23] something inside of us and and God is
[57:27] still Gathering his family
[57:30] together now sad part is that not
[57:34] everyone who wants to serve God is
[57:37] willing to forsake
[57:38] all they're not willing to forsake their
[57:41] will their life to follow Christ and
[57:44] they've been tricked in thinking that's
[57:47] okay and that's why we have so many
[57:48] different denominations out there so
[57:51] many different ideas out there but if
[57:54] you think Lucifer tricked
[57:56] that Fallen
[57:58] Angels he tricked Eve he tricked the
[58:00] children of Israel all of them were
[58:02] tricked by thinking that they could
[58:04] still have eternal life without doing
[58:08] the will of
[58:09] God that's the
[58:12] truth but you can't this is what Jesus
[58:15] said in Mark
[58:17] 8:34 and when he had called the people
[58:20] together unto him with his disciples
[58:23] also as he said unto them whosoever will
[58:25] come come after me let him deny himself
[58:28] take up his cross and follow me I
[58:32] believe when he called his disciples
[58:33] that they did
[58:36] that it didn't say it but they did it
[58:39] the proof is we got the the
[58:42] Bible we got we got we know what
[58:44] happened afterwards and Jesus said for
[58:47] whosoever will save his life he's going
[58:49] to lose
[58:51] it but if you just give up your life for
[58:55] the gospel
[58:56] for my sake and the gospels the same
[58:59] shall save it amen so that's the only
[59:03] way to be a part of the family of God is
[59:07] to forsake all that you have and follow
[59:10] God the only way and I know those are
[59:13] like hard
[59:14] words but you know what I'd rather have
[59:17] the truth than be comforted by some
[59:22] lie now everyone has a chance to hear
[59:25] the gospel at least once and here's an
[59:26] example in Matthew in Mark chap 10 of
[59:30] someone who had a strong desire for
[59:33] salvation but he wasn't willing to pay
[59:35] the price that God was
[59:37] requiring and when he had gone forth
[59:40] into the way there came one running and
[59:43] kneeled to him and asked him good
[59:47] Master what shall I do that I might
[59:49] inherit eternal life and Jesus said unto
[59:53] them why callest thou me good there's
[59:55] none
[59:57] uh good but one that is
[59:59] God Jesus said you know the Commandments
[1:00:02] do not commit adultery do not kill do
[1:00:03] not steal do not bear false witness
[1:00:05] defraud not honor thy father and thy
[1:00:07] mother and he answered and said Toto him
[1:00:09] master all these have I uh I've done
[1:00:13] these things since I was a young
[1:00:19] boy and Jesus beholding him now notice
[1:00:23] this he loved him
[1:00:27] he loved him so he's looking at him he's
[1:00:30] full of
[1:00:33] love and you would you would think we
[1:00:36] would look at our children who would
[1:00:38] answer that we would
[1:00:40] say good
[1:00:42] job we would say good
[1:00:46] job but not our heavenly father because
[1:00:48] his love is greater than our
[1:00:52] love Jesus behold and loved him and said
[1:00:54] unto him one thing thou
[1:00:57] lackest go thy way sell whatsoever thou
[1:01:00] has give it to the poor and thou shalt
[1:01:03] have Treasures in Heaven and come take
[1:01:07] up the cross and follow me man can I
[1:01:12] just follow you why do I got to go do
[1:01:15] why do I got to give this up why do I
[1:01:17] got to deny myself why do I got to take
[1:01:19] up the cross can I just follow you I got
[1:01:22] I want to I want to come to church I
[1:01:24] want to follow you and I want to go home
[1:01:26] and I want to live my
[1:01:31] life the requirement was forsake
[1:01:33] everything down to the one last
[1:01:39] thing and God
[1:01:42] sees clearly our
[1:01:45] life he sees if anything is standing in
[1:01:48] the way of following
[1:01:50] him now look what verse 22 says and he
[1:01:53] was sad at this saying and went away
[1:01:56] grieved notice
[1:01:58] grieved for he had great possessions he
[1:02:01] was bothered at the preaching that
[1:02:03] day he did not like the sermon it did
[1:02:07] not encourage him he went home
[1:02:09] discouraged instead of instead of
[1:02:11] hearing from the pastor oh you've been
[1:02:13] good you been doing all the Commandments
[1:02:15] from your youth good
[1:02:20] job I'm so glad I know my
[1:02:23] Jesus his nature and and how as many as
[1:02:27] I love I rebuke and chasen he
[1:02:31] said all that he had to do was give up
[1:02:36] one thing the one thing that stood
[1:02:39] between him and
[1:02:42] God but you know what it takes free more
[1:02:45] agency he had to be willing to do it God
[1:02:48] could have God could have took it God
[1:02:49] could have took all his riches away made
[1:02:51] them poor but he didn't
[1:02:56] see many are called but few are chosen
[1:02:59] the call goes out to many amen and all
[1:03:02] that the father's given me will come he
[1:03:04] will not lose a
[1:03:07] one but no matter how what we do how
[1:03:10] much we try if we're not willing to do
[1:03:13] all that God wants us to
[1:03:15] do how can we be a part of the family of
[1:03:20] God and I know this may seem strong but
[1:03:24] it's important
[1:03:26] God will not lose one of his family
[1:03:32] members it's not that I would want to
[1:03:35] judge this Rich Young Ruler that he
[1:03:36] wasn't part of the family of God I don't
[1:03:39] judge people whether they are or they're
[1:03:41] not but it's simple it's really really
[1:03:44] simple Jesus said you'll know them by
[1:03:46] their fruits it's that real hard to
[1:03:47] figure out if you see a person give up
[1:03:50] everything and follow God that's a good
[1:03:52] sign amen if you see somebody that's
[1:03:54] just trying to go halfway all the time
[1:03:56] only give part I'm telling you that's
[1:03:58] danger that's dangerous you can't end up
[1:04:01] doing
[1:04:03] that Paul said in 2 Timothy 2:19
[1:04:07] nevertheless the foundation of God stand
[1:04:09] sure having this seal the Lord knoweth
[1:04:12] them that are his he knows his family
[1:04:15] amen and let every one of those family
[1:04:18] members that say that they're a part of
[1:04:20] the family of God let him depart from
[1:04:23] iniquity amen there's no other options
[1:04:28] for the family of God
[1:04:33] am now there was a group of
[1:04:36] Believers disciples
[1:04:38] actually and they were following Jesus's
[1:04:41] Inner Circle for a great time and one
[1:04:44] day after the service they got offended
[1:04:48] by the word that had been
[1:04:50] preached just like the Rich Young Ruler
[1:04:52] there were 70 disciples and they walked
[1:04:55] away away from Jesus because of one
[1:04:58] sermon
[1:05:00] am John
[1:05:02] 6 66 you know the mark of the beast from
[1:05:06] that time many of his disciples went
[1:05:08] back and walked no more with
[1:05:10] him then Jesus said unto the 12 his
[1:05:15] family that he had chosen are you going
[1:05:17] to walk away
[1:05:19] also then Peter answered Lord to whom
[1:05:22] whom shall we go thou has has the words
[1:05:24] of eternal life
[1:05:28] now if you don't forsake everything for
[1:05:33] God the thing that you don't forsake
[1:05:37] becomes your God and you will
[1:05:40] never you will never be able to follow
[1:05:44] God into the
[1:05:45] kingdom because the requirement that God
[1:05:48] has is him and and only
[1:05:51] him now we got to
[1:05:54] work God wants us to have nice things
[1:05:57] God wants us to
[1:05:59] enjoy but God wants to be
[1:06:02] first God wants to be first he always
[1:06:05] wants to be first
[1:06:07] amen many will plead their cause the
[1:06:10] Bible says many will come to him in that
[1:06:14] day but they didn't forsake all to
[1:06:18] follow him the bottom line it's the
[1:06:20] requirement of God isn't the church's
[1:06:23] requirement it's God's requirement now
[1:06:25] the problem told us that these disciples
[1:06:27] who
[1:06:28] left that didn't have the understanding
[1:06:32] brother bandam said that Jesus's own
[1:06:34] disciples didn't have the understanding
[1:06:36] what he meant in that
[1:06:40] sermon but they knew it was
[1:06:42] true because whatever God says is
[1:06:46] true so just because we don't understand
[1:06:49] something it doesn't mean it's not true
[1:06:51] what's important is that you believe
[1:06:54] what Jesus said you believe the word of
[1:06:55] God you believe what's being
[1:06:58] said they had a representation of truth
[1:07:01] from Heaven already inside of
[1:07:05] them God is gathering together his whole
[1:07:08] family and I'm so glad that God gave
[1:07:13] us a part of
[1:07:17] Heaven think about your family members
[1:07:20] who haven't come in who don't see it who
[1:07:22] who didn't see it we are for fortunate
[1:07:26] that there's something inside of us
[1:07:29] that's much deeper than just a good
[1:07:31] churchgoer than someone that just knows
[1:07:34] the scriptures or someone that just uh
[1:07:37] has had many experiences with
[1:07:39] God I'd rather have no experiences with
[1:07:43] God don't misunderstand this I'd rather
[1:07:47] have no outside
[1:07:49] manifestations with God and have
[1:07:51] representation on the
[1:07:54] inside because that keeps me connected
[1:07:57] to a a real relationship with God on a
[1:07:59] daily basis my thoughts my intents I'm
[1:08:03] I'm caring about the way I'm carrying
[1:08:05] myself I I want to represent
[1:08:07] him now the book of Ephesians was
[1:08:10] written as we know to a more mature
[1:08:13] church right that's right am to me it
[1:08:15] depicts the father's Vision that he
[1:08:18] wants his church family to walk in you
[1:08:21] get time read the book of Ephesians it's
[1:08:23] it's not very many chapters
[1:08:25] right but it helps us to see the vision
[1:08:29] we don't have a a lot of time here
[1:08:32] that's the only thing about church it
[1:08:33] you know there's never enough time you
[1:08:35] know in
[1:08:37] church so we're going to get as far as
[1:08:39] we can with this but the key is that we
[1:08:42] really need to be in Christ not know him
[1:08:47] not have experiences but to be in him
[1:08:51] and to have him in me and that day
[1:08:53] you'll know that I'm in you and you in
[1:08:55] me me it's a Oneness amen if there's
[1:08:59] anything that we should be doing is
[1:09:00] praying for more of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:09:03] we don't want to be in a man-made Church
[1:09:05] man-made ideas opinions theology we just
[1:09:09] want a real relationship with God
[1:09:13] Ephesians chapter
[1:09:15] 3:9 tells us and to make all men see
[1:09:19] what is the Fellowship of the mystery
[1:09:22] which from the beginning of the world
[1:09:25] has been hidden God who created All
[1:09:28] Things by Jesus Christ and drop down to
[1:09:31] verse 11 according to his eternal
[1:09:33] purpose which he purposed in Christ
[1:09:36] Jesus our lord so Eternal purpose that
[1:09:39] mean it didn't have no
[1:09:41] beginning it doesn't have no end this
[1:09:43] thing goes way back and it's going way
[1:09:46] ahead it's got to be pretty important to
[1:09:49] God brother Bram said in the Samaran
[1:09:51] Church age he said the heart purpose the
[1:09:53] Eternal purpose of God was to take a
[1:09:56] bride of his own
[1:09:58] choosing that was that and that purpose
[1:10:02] was in
[1:10:04] himself and and being Eternal was
[1:10:08] decreed from the foundation of the world
[1:10:13] Amen he wanted a wife he wanted a
[1:10:16] family this is on the mind of God Amen
[1:10:20] when we're working when we're at the
[1:10:22] store when we're vacationing this is is
[1:10:25] on the mind of God
[1:10:27] Amen verse 14 for this cause I bow my
[1:10:32] knees unto the father of the Lord Jesus
[1:10:37] Christ of whom the whole family in
[1:10:41] Heaven and Earth is
[1:10:45] named praise the Lord praise the Lord
[1:10:49] the whole family in Heaven and Earth is
[1:10:53] named am
[1:10:56] we are of the family of Jesus Christ
[1:10:58] amen we are Brothers and Sisters in
[1:11:01] Christ we are the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:11:04] and of course we take his name in
[1:11:06] baptism amen now what kind of family are
[1:11:10] we going to be what kind of family does
[1:11:12] the father want us to
[1:11:15] be that's a good question isn't it let's
[1:11:18] drop down to verse
[1:11:20] 16 that the father would Grant you
[1:11:23] according to the riches of his glory to
[1:11:24] be strong strengthened with might by his
[1:11:28] spirit in the inner
[1:11:30] man that Christ May dwell in your hearts
[1:11:34] by
[1:11:35] faith that ye being rooted and
[1:11:39] grounded in
[1:11:45] theology in church being rooted and
[1:11:48] grounded in
[1:11:50] church being rooted and grounded in love
[1:11:58] love may be able to comprehend with All
[1:12:02] Saints what is the breadth the length
[1:12:04] the depth the height and to know the
[1:12:07] love of
[1:12:08] Christ which passes all knowledge that
[1:12:12] you might be filled with all the
[1:12:15] fullness of
[1:12:18] God the family of God is a family of
[1:12:23] love amen
[1:12:27] a family of
[1:12:30] love all what manner of love the father
[1:12:34] have bestowed upon us that we should be
[1:12:37] called the sons of
[1:12:40] God by this shall all men know you're my
[1:12:43] disciples when you have love one for
[1:12:46] another the family of God is identified
[1:12:49] by a gape
[1:12:51] love not by being nice to one another
[1:12:54] amen by a agapy love that's love without
[1:12:57] respect to persons that you're not going
[1:13:00] to get anything out of it by loving when
[1:13:03] you're not being loved
[1:13:06] back by love that can sincerely turn the
[1:13:09] cheek that can can go seven times
[1:13:13] 70 that kind of love is how the family
[1:13:16] of God is identified with that Jesus
[1:13:19] said be perfect even as your father
[1:13:21] which is in heaven is perfect that ye
[1:13:23] may be the children of of your father
[1:13:25] the family we're talking about family
[1:13:27] now which is in heaven for he maketh the
[1:13:30] son to rise on the evil and on the good
[1:13:32] and send the reign of the justice so I
[1:13:35] God expects his children his family to
[1:13:38] do the same thing amen don't be looking
[1:13:41] for somebody that likes you don't be
[1:13:44] looking for somebody that can give you
[1:13:45] something back be looking for the person
[1:13:47] who don't like you who won't give you
[1:13:49] something back and be good to them
[1:13:51] because that's what God's family doesen
[1:13:55] don't be claiming I'm part of the family
[1:13:56] of God not do
[1:13:58] that you're just making yourself not
[1:14:00] look too good I'm so glad we got the
[1:14:03] word of God today amen it lets us know
[1:14:06] where we're
[1:14:08] standing children that can love your
[1:14:11] enemy they can bless them that curse you
[1:14:15] do good to them that hate you pray for
[1:14:18] them that despitefully use you and even
[1:14:21] persecute
[1:14:22] you this is the vision
[1:14:25] that God has for his family the vision
[1:14:29] that he wants us to walk in to
[1:14:33] comprehend with All Saints the love of
[1:14:36] Christ to be rooted and grounded in love
[1:14:38] to be filled with the fullness of
[1:14:41] God to love everyone just the way he
[1:14:45] loves God had this vision from the
[1:14:50] beginning it will be that way in the
[1:14:53] end and Satan's trying trying to trick
[1:14:55] us up with a a confused Vision that
[1:14:58] that's not necessary God understands
[1:15:00] we're humans nobody can be
[1:15:04] perfect why don't you just say I need
[1:15:06] more of the Holy Ghost I need more of my
[1:15:09] nature changed why don't we just get
[1:15:12] back to the gospel that's really what's
[1:15:16] important there was a little girl her
[1:15:18] name was murth and this is a true story
[1:15:22] and uh she had a 14 year old dog that
[1:15:26] had passed away and that dog's name was
[1:15:28] Abby and because of the dog being older
[1:15:33] and she was young they they really grew
[1:15:37] very attached and you could just imagine
[1:15:39] her heart was just completely broken
[1:15:42] when the dog had
[1:15:44] died and she really wanted to see that
[1:15:46] dog in
[1:15:48] heaven and wanted God to take care of
[1:15:52] the dog so she actually asked her mom if
[1:15:54] she could write a Letter to God and and
[1:15:56] and and and and sent a picture of Abby
[1:15:59] that so so that when the dog got there
[1:16:03] you know would would recogniz God Jesus
[1:16:05] would recognize the dog and take good
[1:16:07] care of her so this is what she said in

[1:18:59] and remember that I love you very much
[1:19:01] and by the way I am with you everywhere
[1:19:06] there is
[1:19:09] love everywhere there is love that's
[1:19:13] where God is at
[1:19:19] amen that's the vision that God has for
[1:19:23] us to walk walk in his
[1:19:27] love Ephesians says for we are the
[1:19:30] workmanship we are his workmanship
[1:19:32] created in Christ Jesus unto good works
[1:19:36] which God had before ordained that we
[1:19:39] should walk in them this is the vision
[1:19:43] of God and he he's speaking to an
[1:19:45] Ephesian Church age an Ephesian Church
[1:19:49] which is a mature church but we know
[1:19:52] that not all people people want to walk
[1:19:56] in the
[1:19:58] truth he said Ephesians 5:14 wherefore
[1:20:01] the father saith awake thou that
[1:20:03] sleepest shall rise from the dead and
[1:20:05] Christ shall give thee
[1:20:08] light see then that you walk
[1:20:12] circumspectly not as fools but as wise
[1:20:17] Redeeming the time because the days are
[1:20:20] evil we don't want to waste the precious
[1:20:23] time that we have we even know how long
[1:20:25] we're going to live am wherefore be ye
[1:20:30] not unwise but
[1:20:33] understanding what the will of the Lord
[1:20:37] is the will of the Lord is for us to
[1:20:39] walk in the complete word of God Amen
[1:20:45] that's perfect
[1:20:46] love this is when you walk in this
[1:20:49] you're walking in
[1:20:52] love does no good to hear the word of
[1:20:55] God and not to follow
[1:20:58] it we got to manifest it the Bible says
[1:21:01] wherefore laying apart all filthiness
[1:21:05] and superfluity of naughtiness and
[1:21:06] receive with meekness the engrafted word
[1:21:08] which is able to save your souls but be
[1:21:11] ye doers of the word and not hearers
[1:21:15] only deceiving yourself so I say while
[1:21:18] you're sitting in the seats today while
[1:21:20] you're listening in the live stream
[1:21:22] today or while you're listening to the
[1:21:25] let me just say this be Desiring to live
[1:21:29] the word to manifest the word to walk in
[1:21:31] the word to do the word more than to
[1:21:33] hear it do not be satisfied with hearing
[1:21:36] it do not be satisfied till you awake in
[1:21:39] his likeness to you're living that word
[1:21:42] amen so as we hear the light of the word
[1:21:46] whatever God speaks however he speaks it
[1:21:48] to us when we obey it we become the word
[1:21:53] that's it it's so simple amen you don't
[1:21:56] need anybody else to tell you you're
[1:21:58] living the word you don't need anybody
[1:22:01] else to give you credentials you don't
[1:22:03] need to get anybody else's approval all
[1:22:06] you have to do is when you hear the
[1:22:08] gospel preached you say yes Lord I want
[1:22:10] to do that and you become the Living
[1:22:14] Word habach
[1:22:17] 2 ver uh chapter 2:2 says and the Lord
[1:22:20] answered me and said write the vision
[1:22:23] make it plain on the
[1:22:25] tables that he may run that readeth
[1:22:31] it write the
[1:22:34] vision make it plain on upon
[1:22:42] tables that ye may run that he may run
[1:22:46] that readeth it now this
[1:22:51] is
[1:22:53] we you know
[1:22:55] there's all sorts of things that we
[1:22:58] can write
[1:23:02] on but the the tables are really in our
[1:23:07] heart 2 Corinthians 3:2 says ye are our
[1:23:11] Epistles written in our hearts known and
[1:23:14] read of all
[1:23:16] men this Vision has to be wrote there
[1:23:19] right amen for as much as ye are
[1:23:21] manifestly declared to be the Epistles
[1:23:23] of Christ ministered by US Written not
[1:23:26] with ink but with the spirit of the
[1:23:29] Living God not in tables of stone but in
[1:23:33] fleshly tables of the
[1:23:37] heart so when you take this vision and
[1:23:40] you you this Vision of Love of a family
[1:23:43] that God is wanting to get his family
[1:23:45] together and the true family is a family
[1:23:47] of love and you write that in your your
[1:23:50] heart and your life is a life of
[1:23:53] love and and people who who read your
[1:23:56] life can say yes that's the way I'm
[1:24:00] catching it this is
[1:24:02] Christ by this shall all men know you're
[1:24:05] my
[1:24:07] disciples not when you can barely get
[1:24:09] along with one
[1:24:11] another not when you can turn your cheek
[1:24:14] because you don't want to look at the
[1:24:21] person Soul full of the love of
[1:24:25] God oh how many loves this word don't
[1:24:29] you get quiet you're not allowed to get
[1:24:32] quiet in here that's the rules it's my
[1:24:34] only
[1:24:35] rule 1 John chapter 1 verse5 1 John
[1:24:38] chapter 1 verse5 this then is the
[1:24:40] message which he heard of him and
[1:24:42] declare unto
[1:24:44] you that God is
[1:24:47] light and in him is no Darkness at all
[1:24:51] now now here's the thing this scripture
[1:24:53] is not for me to tell you what you're
[1:24:56] doing
[1:24:57] wrong this is not for me to tell you
[1:25:00] where you don't have the
[1:25:02] light or where you have
[1:25:05] Darkness this scripture is for me to
[1:25:07] know that God does not want me to walk
[1:25:09] in any
[1:25:12] Darkness that's what that scripture is
[1:25:15] for if we say that we have we have a
[1:25:19] relationship with Jesus Christ and we
[1:25:22] walk in
[1:25:26] Darkness we
[1:25:27] lie and do not the
[1:25:30] truth
[1:25:33] wow if you tell some people that they
[1:25:36] will get
[1:25:39] offended but you know what it's not my
[1:25:42] word I can't take credit I can't take
[1:25:45] credit nor should I be discouraged
[1:25:48] because they walk
[1:25:51] away but if we walk in the light as he
[1:25:54] is in the light we have fellowship with
[1:25:57] one another and the blood of Jesus
[1:26:01] Christ his son cleanses us from all
[1:26:06] sin we need to walk in the light of the
[1:26:09] word in order to stay under the blood we
[1:26:12] can't just do what we want and say cover
[1:26:14] me with your blood we literally have to
[1:26:16] walk in the light in order for the blood
[1:26:18] to keep us where it needs to
[1:26:20] be didn't the prophet say if you do not
[1:26:23] follow what God asked you to do he is
[1:26:26] not obligated to show you anything
[1:26:29] more when he the spirit of truth will
[1:26:31] come he will lead and guide you into
[1:26:33] some of the
[1:26:35] truth all the truth so when we come to
[1:26:38] church we should be able to expect to
[1:26:40] hear more truth amen and it may not be
[1:26:43] you know more Mysteries more knowledge
[1:26:46] more I never heard this before but God
[1:26:48] is speaking something to our heart that
[1:26:50] he wants us to do that's God speaking to
[1:26:53] us
[1:26:54] directly Ephesians chapter
[1:26:59] 4 Ephesians chap 4:1 17 this I say
[1:27:03] therefore in testifying the Lord that
[1:27:05] you henceforth walk
[1:27:08] not as other believers
[1:27:13] walk in the
[1:27:16] vanity of their mind you know I am not
[1:27:22] scared of the h
[1:27:26] juls I am not scared of these people who
[1:27:30] are so far out
[1:27:32] there that they're going to trick
[1:27:37] me is those ones who are willing to walk
[1:27:40] in 95% of the
[1:27:43] truth but the other 5% they say yeah you
[1:27:46] don't have to worry about that this is
[1:27:48] the main
[1:27:49] thing that's the spirit that'll get you
[1:27:53] off in the vanity of their own mind
[1:27:55] having the understand their
[1:27:57] understanding dark and being alienated
[1:27:59] from the life of
[1:28:01] God which we know is pure
[1:28:07] love God is love through the ignorance
[1:28:10] that is in them because of the blindness
[1:28:12] of their heart who being past feeling
[1:28:14] have given themselves over to lascivious
[1:28:16] to walk to work all uncleanness with
[1:28:18] greediness see it's so it's all about
[1:28:21] them it's a selfish person
[1:28:25] he says but you have not so learned
[1:28:30] Christ we don't teach Christ that way
[1:28:33] it's not about entertainment it's not
[1:28:35] about feeling good it's about a
[1:28:38] relationship that'll get you to heaven
[1:28:40] it's about making it in a Rapture that's
[1:28:43] what it's
[1:28:44] about Paul said in Galatians chapter 1
[1:28:48] verse 8 this is I I think was worth
[1:28:50] repeating
[1:28:52] here well Paul said follow me as I
[1:28:54] follow
[1:28:55] Christ but he also said But though we
[1:28:59] are an angel from heaven preach any
[1:29:02] other gospel unto you than what we have
[1:29:05] preached unto you let him be a
[1:29:12] cursed wow so having the supernatural
[1:29:16] experience felt your body leave go over
[1:29:19] here had this
[1:29:22] experience amen if it's anything other
[1:29:25] than the word of God let it be
[1:29:27] accursed and we said before so I now
[1:29:31] again I say say I say sorry so say I now
[1:29:34] again if any man preach any other gospel
[1:29:37] unto you than that ye have
[1:29:40] received let him be a
[1:29:43] cursed so we got to stay with the
[1:29:47] word we got to stay with the father's
[1:29:49] Vision we need to stay where Christ
[1:29:51] wants us to stay a Ephesians 4 just
[1:29:56] remember Ephesians 4 helps us to see the
[1:29:59] vision that God wants us to walk in I
[1:30:01] therefore the prisoner of the Lord
[1:30:03] beseech you that you walk
[1:30:06] worthy of the calling where ye are
[1:30:09] called with all loneliness with all
[1:30:11] meekness with all longsuffering with all
[1:30:14] forbearing one another in love amen
[1:30:17] endeavoring to keep the unity of the
[1:30:19] spirit in the bond of
[1:30:22] Peace God wants wants his
[1:30:26] family to love one
[1:30:30] another now whether you had one child or
[1:30:34] you had seven or however many children
[1:30:36] you had you never wanted to see your
[1:30:42] child uh fighting with
[1:30:45] anybody because they're representing you
[1:30:48] right they're representing you look we
[1:30:52] don't do that in the home what are you
[1:30:54] doing that
[1:30:57] for God does not want his
[1:31:01] children fussing and fighting and giving
[1:31:04] a cold shoulder and
[1:31:08] negative in fact God said I I'm I I'm
[1:31:12] not even going to have fellowship with
[1:31:14] you I don't care what offering you bring
[1:31:17] me I don't care how perfect it is I'm
[1:31:19] not gonna accept I'm not gonna have
[1:31:21] fellowship with you until you make that
[1:31:25] thing right with your your brother and
[1:31:27] sister
[1:31:30] amen God is putting a
[1:31:32] priority that he's not going to lower
[1:31:35] himself to have a subpar relationship if
[1:31:39] you don't want to put the word first are
[1:31:41] you with
[1:31:42] me look I think what we should do is
[1:31:45] just fall in love with the word forget
[1:31:47] about our theology forget about what we
[1:31:50] think we don't got much time to get
[1:31:52] ready some of us have really been
[1:31:56] dragging come on brother that's what we
[1:31:59] need we need some amens we we we need to
[1:32:01] get serious about falling in love with
[1:32:04] God so we can express love one to
[1:32:06] another amen so we can keep the father's
[1:32:09] Vision going so we can we didn't even
[1:32:12] get
[1:32:13] into reaching out to
[1:32:15] others because it's it's really part of
[1:32:18] the vision
[1:32:25] H Ephesians 1 verse I mean Ephesians 5
[1:32:30] verse 1 be ye therefore followers of God
[1:32:32] as dear children and walk in love
[1:32:36] Ephesians just just filled with how we
[1:32:39] need to walk in God's love as Christ
[1:32:41] also loved us and gave himself for us as
[1:32:44] an offering and a sacrifice to God for a
[1:32:47] sweet
[1:32:48] smelling uh smelling Savor
[1:32:51] amen so if we see the father's Eternal
[1:32:56] purpose that we're a family of love we
[1:32:59] need to walk in it we need to walk in
[1:33:03] love we need to walk in in truth amen
[1:33:06] amen our Heavenly father's Vision hasn't
[1:33:09] changed it it didn't change when he
[1:33:11] first called Peter Peter come follow me
[1:33:15] and I'll make you Fishers of Men what
[1:33:16] was the last thing that he said to Peter
[1:33:19] or that Great
[1:33:20] Commission go ye therefore and teach All
[1:33:23] Nations back baptizing them in the name
[1:33:25] of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost
[1:33:27] teaching them to observe all things
[1:33:29] whatsoever commanded you and lo I Am
[1:33:31] With You Always even to the end of the
[1:33:33] world now do you
[1:33:35] think he wants you to leave out some
[1:33:38] things
[1:33:41] there the Bible says teaching them to
[1:33:44] observe all things whatsoever I've
[1:33:45] commanded you
[1:33:48] amen now the
[1:33:51] first thing that he told Peter is is
[1:33:54] basically the last thing that he tells
[1:33:56] his
[1:33:57] disciples his vision hasn't changed he
[1:34:00] wants his whole family there he knows
[1:34:03] that we weren't even going to be born
[1:34:05] till this age
[1:34:08] right amen and you know there's people
[1:34:11] out there that need to
[1:34:13] hear but God's Vision hasn't
[1:34:16] changed and the Satan throws out a lot
[1:34:19] of lures get us
[1:34:22] distracted take our mind mind off of
[1:34:24] what's really important and I'll tell
[1:34:27] you I'm going to just say this the love
[1:34:29] of God is not a
[1:34:32] gift character is not a
[1:34:35] gift it's not it's a victory what do you
[1:34:39] have to do to get the character of God
[1:34:41] you have to deny yourself you have to
[1:34:44] pick up your cross and you have to
[1:34:46] follow him when your flesh says no I
[1:34:49] don't want to do
[1:34:50] it I don't feel like going to church I
[1:34:53] don't I don't feel like reading the word
[1:34:55] I don't feel like praying I don't feel
[1:34:57] like listening to the tapes that you got
[1:34:59] a job to do there you got to put that
[1:35:03] that old man where he belongs all right
[1:35:06] we need to follow just please bear with
[1:35:09] me brother Brandon went beyond the
[1:35:11] curtain of
[1:35:13] time he said he seen millions of people
[1:35:17] and there was a voice that spoke to him
[1:35:19] he says you've been gathered to your
[1:35:21] people like Jacob gathered to his
[1:35:26] people and brother bandam said all these
[1:35:30] my people are all these Broms are these
[1:35:35] my
[1:35:36] family and the voice said
[1:35:39] no they're your converts to Christ in
[1:35:43] other words they're part of the family
[1:35:44] of God
[1:35:46] Amen the ones that you led to the Lord
[1:35:49] some of these women you think are so
[1:35:51] young and beautiful were more than 90
[1:35:53] years old when you led them to the Lord
[1:35:56] no wonder they're crying out my precious
[1:36:03] brother can you imagine 90 years
[1:36:06] old you you
[1:36:09] just you you hardly living any more of
[1:36:11] your life over for some I'll just say it
[1:36:14] like that you lived your life kind of in
[1:36:17] the vanity of your own
[1:36:19] mind and this man comes by and tells you
[1:36:22] the truth
[1:36:26] and you accept it because something
[1:36:28] inside of you said it is the
[1:36:31] truth I can imagine they were so happy
[1:36:34] to be on the other
[1:36:37] side so
[1:36:39] happy part of the F he's gathering
[1:36:43] together now this is the the the vision
[1:36:46] that he stepped into
[1:36:51] right let's take a look what type of
[1:36:54] family this is he said from that time
[1:36:56] from that time in that message from that
[1:36:58] time he says I've been more determined
[1:37:01] to do everything that I can to persuade
[1:37:03] men and women to please be sure of this
[1:37:07] if God's love doesn't anchor in your
[1:37:09] heart
[1:37:10] supremely don't you take any sensation
[1:37:14] or motion you be sure that you can turn
[1:37:17] the other cheek that Christ is all in
[1:37:20] all to you don't you miss it my
[1:37:25] brother now just remember I'll say this
[1:37:28] with Faith that I have in that Vision
[1:37:31] whatever it was I speak it in the name
[1:37:34] of the Lord except you have that perfect
[1:37:37] love you'll never be
[1:37:41] there God's family is a family of love
[1:37:45] amen you know and it I I know I know
[1:37:49] look I know we all try to be nice to one
[1:37:52] another you know we really put our best
[1:37:55] our best but you
[1:37:59] understand we've got to come to this
[1:38:01] perfect
[1:38:03] love so what we got to focus on is where
[1:38:06] it seems to be
[1:38:07] slipping in our
[1:38:10] lives in our in our minds thoughts that
[1:38:13] we have things that we let get in
[1:38:17] there because we need to get to that
[1:38:20] place where the family needs to be now
[1:38:23] remember if we were just in Luther's age
[1:38:27] hey Justified I believe that' be it
[1:38:32] don't need to be
[1:38:33] Sanctified don't don't need the the the
[1:38:36] manifestation of many things but in this
[1:38:39] age we
[1:38:40] do except you have perfect love you'll
[1:38:43] never be there because nothing could
[1:38:45] ever be there without it amen he said
[1:38:49] your spirit will be out of place there
[1:38:52] it couldn't come there be no way for it
[1:38:54] to come beyond the curtain of time we're
[1:38:57] closing I am more convinced than ever in
[1:39:00] my life that don't take perfect love to
[1:39:02] enter in that place there was no
[1:39:05] jealousy there was no tiredness praise
[1:39:07] God for that right no sickness praise
[1:39:09] God for that no old age praise God for
[1:39:12] that no
[1:39:14] death only Supreme Beauty and joy
[1:39:20] whatever you do lay aside everything
[1:39:21] else until you get perfect love amen get
[1:39:25] to where you can love everybody even
[1:39:28] every
[1:39:30] enemy no matter if the plane is rocking
[1:39:32] the lights are flashing The Guns of the
[1:39:34] enemy are upon you these things do not
[1:39:39] matter forget the news forget what's
[1:39:42] happening I am telling you when the
[1:39:44] Rapture comes they will still be killing
[1:39:46] one
[1:39:51] another he said get perfect
[1:39:54] love if you're not saved accept Jesus
[1:39:57] Christ as your savior now if you have
[1:39:58] not been baptized in water be baptized
[1:40:01] now if you have not received the baptism
[1:40:04] in uh in the in the Holy Spirit receive
[1:40:07] it now press on to that perfect love
[1:40:11] which will take you to the beautiful and
[1:40:14] joyful place beyond the curtain of time
[1:40:17] now remember this is his Eternal Vision
[1:40:21] that he's had from the beginning amen
[1:40:23] amen and we're coming we're at the
[1:40:25] climax of it we're coming to where
[1:40:28] there's no more chance for anybody to be
[1:40:31] saved and he we get this one last
[1:40:34] commission after he goes and he he he he
[1:40:38] he he gets a the the the first
[1:40:41] fruits of what's on the other side he
[1:40:43] comes back just like Joshua and Caleb
[1:40:46] did when they they brought back the
[1:40:48] fruit and said we're it is the land that
[1:40:51] floweth with milk and honey and and it's
[1:40:53] ours and God gave it to the prophet came
[1:40:55] back and he said it is real that it is a
[1:40:58] place of perfect love and whatever you
[1:41:01] do make sure you get perfect love
[1:41:03] because you won't get it when you get
[1:41:07] there you got to get it
[1:41:11] first God's family is a family of
[1:41:15] love this is the Father's Vision let's
[1:41:18] stand
[1:41:19] together not many people have the vision
[1:41:24] but our heavenly father wants us to
[1:41:25] catch the vision walk in
[1:41:27] it walk in love redeem the time help
[1:41:31] others to get converted to
[1:41:33] Christ let people read the gospel in
[1:41:37] your life forget your words amen let

[1:41:55] full of
[1:41:56] Mercy speak the truth in love live for
[1:42:00] others share the gospel this is what God
[1:42:04] is looking at you know Saints we come
[1:42:07] here to hear not just hear from
[1:42:13] God but we come to receive from
[1:42:16] God and you've got to be the one that

[1:42:27] you're doing everything that all the
[1:42:29] ideas that you had and your plans at
[1:42:31] what you're going to do you just got to
[1:42:32] drop it and follow the
[1:42:35] word follow it because this is what will
[1:42:38] take you to where you want to go and I
[1:42:40] know nothing else that will take you
[1:42:43] there nothing else it's just the word
[1:42:47] and I'm so glad that God sent a prophet
[1:42:49] to make clear to us what the word really
[1:42:51] is what it really means
[1:42:56] amen let's sing that that
