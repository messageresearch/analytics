coming out for wednesday service amen turn with me if you would to the book of ecclesiastes and then also the book of psalms ecclesiastes chapter 9 and then psalms chapter 90 amen we are saddened for the brother tim pruitt and his family um it's always hard always hard for those that are left behind i'm sure our sister does not want to come back she's in peace and joy and that she's never experienced before but let's continue to pray for the family amen let's look to the lord in prayer before we read these scriptures our gracious heavenly father we thank you that you have watched over us all today and brought us here safe and sound and for that precious treasure inside our heart to want to be here to want to be in your presence and to be strengthened by your word and we pray for the holy spirit to come now this time of the service and let the word become a living word inside of us lord let us walk away with a substance that we didn't have when we came here lord we pray that you would remember brother tim lord and his family may your great comfort surround them as they need you in this this dark hour lord lord we pray that you'd be amongst the needy of our little flock lord that you would meet the needs that there would be amongst us lord thou knowest each one be with those that are not here those that are live streaming we just commit them all into your hands and ask your blessings lord on the reading of your word and the furtherance of this service now in jesus precious name we pray amen amen ecclesiastes chapter 9 verse number 10 whatsoever thy hand findeth to do do it with thy might for there is no work nor device nor knowledge nor wisdom in the grave whether thou goest and then the book of psalms chapter 90 and verse number 12. so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom amen god bless you may be seated brother branham in a prayer that he prayed in the hebrews series chapter 6 he says now father receive our worship this morning take the word and plant it into the believer's heart amen may they not just may they not be just tossed about and up today and top and down tomorrow but may these words find their resting place in every believer's heart that's right amen that's our goal not just to have a wonderful service but to take the word in our heart and become a different creature down the road this evening we want to entitle this message plant your potatoes i'm sure you've heard brother branham talk about that our opening scripture here it says whatsoever thy hand find it to do do it with all they might yes amen because there's coming a time that when when we're in the grave there is no work no device no knowledge no wisdom when we go into the grave so today is the day amen to work right it's true amen and all that we have is our life right it doesn't matter how much money you have that's true that's right it just matters what you're going to do with your life jesus gave us some parables about talents one had five one had two one had one and the one that had five he went and doubled the one that had two he went double the one that had won he pretty much used his life for himself he gave another parable about ten servants and those ten servants he gave them each one pound and he commanded them all ten servants to occupy till i come now he has given us all life we don't all have the same talents the same ability but we have to give the same accountability as the song goes only one life so soon it will pass only what's done for christ will last only one chance to do his will so give to jesus all your day it's the only life that pays when you recall you have just one life if you were to die today would you be happy with how you spent the last year would you be happy how you spent the last year this world's going insane i was so glad when the mass were over and now they're pointing right back and i don't know if we'll ever see the last of the vex uh the the viruses the mutations we don't know what's before us we just know there's a squeeze coming we know the n is coming we know it's going to be worse than it's ever been on the planet and all of us have this hope inside it can't be now we got more time we want to live there's more things we want to do but the end is soon amen and we we need to be occupying our time amen the very best that we can for the lord turn with me if you would to the book of john chapter 21. john chapter 21 starting with verse number 14. so here's a a time now that um jesus and and peter were alone and uh starting here at verse 14 the bible says this is now the third time that jesus showed himself to his disciples after that he had been risen from the dead kind of give us a time when this happened so when they had dying jesus saith to simon peter simon son of jonas loveth thou mean more than these must have been maybe went like this to all the other disciples he saith unto him yay lord thou knowest i love thee and he sayeth unto him feed my lambs and he sayeth unto him again the second time simon son of jonas loveth thou me he saith unto him yea lord thou knowest that i love thee and he saith unto him feed my sheep he sayeth unto him the third time simon son of jonas lovest thou me peter was grieved think about the statement he was grieved that means distressed and sorrowful yes amen at god speaking to him jesus question brought a heaviness to peter because he said unto him the third time loveth thou mean and he said unto him lord thou knowest all things they'll know us that i love thee don't question me about my love for jesus that's what he was saying don't question me jesus saith unto him feed my sheep now notice this question was more important to jesus than it was to peter do you love me it was really important to jesus but to peter that you know i do done subject we don't need to go any further brother branham said at the end of the a stirring message is this the sign of the end sir he said do you love him and the congregation said amen and brother branham said be real sure of that be real sure of it amen i'll say we're at the end time amen it's something that we got to be sure of right now more than anything amen the amount of love that you are actively manifesting shows just how close you're following jesus yes because if you say you've got love and you ain't manifesting what good is it it's it's love is active it's got to be something that it's just pulsating every opportunity just being expressed amen most people do not view their personal relationship like that but jesus does he wants to see it manifested he said statements like this if you love me keep my commandments he said you are my friends if you do whatsoever i ask you by the manifestation of god's love in your flesh wall men know that you belong to him if you truly love me like you say you do then feed god's lambs feed a what sheep food feed them what is needed to draw their relationship closer to god amen because that's all that matters that's what real sheep does need to be following jesus amen verse 18 verily verily i say unto thee when you were young thou girdest thyself and walketh whether thou would us but when thou shalt be old thou shall stretch forth thy hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whether thou wouldest not this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify god and when he had spoken this he saith unto him follow me so he he's he's telling peter what you need to focus on is following me amen when peter was first called to this relationship with god jesus said unto him follow me that's right peter follow me amen now after his death burial resurrection jesus is speaking the very same message to peter yes amen any different message the same message follow me amen amen the message if you love me completely you will follow me completely amen the bride will follow the bridegroom completely no matter no matter what where he leads i will follow she will follow amen so jesus tells peter how he's going to die but does not leave him in a mind battle about going forward you still got a job to do you still need to follow yes he tells peter to keep following right to the end of his life this is so important because we're going to such terrible times and it's only going to get worse 2022 will be worse i don't mean to be pro i'm not prophesying i'm not meeting trying to be negative what i am saying is do you believe we're in the end let's get ready to get out of here and peter got anxious in that moment about wanting to know the future of one of his good friends brother john and he asked jesus is john going to have to suffer like me let's pick it up in verse 20. then peter turning about seeth the disciple of jesus love falling which also leaned on the breast as supper and said lord which is he that betrayeth thee peter seeing him say it to jesus lord what shall this man do now jesus could have said a lot of things he could have told him exactly but look at his response jesus saith unto him if i will if it's my will that he tarry till i come what is it to you what is it to you it's none of your business follow me amen i understand that we all got some nosy noses at times not just about one another but about things and i want us to think about what is it to you was was peter trying to use jesus as cnn detroit news just to get some information it wasn't going to help peter we want to know things that don't help us then went this saying abroad among the brethren that that disciple should not die yet jesus did not did not said not unto him he shall not die but if i will that he territory come what is it to thee a notice the disciples weren't even understanding what jesus was saying these were his chosen disciples and they were you know trying to always figure things out it's amazing how easy it is for god's chosen to misunderstand what jesus is saying to them what jesus was really saying to peter and to all of us it's really none of our business what god is doing with one another it's god's business amen god can handle his business he's good at his business i'm terrible at his business i can barely handle my business let alone god's business in other words it's a private relationship between jesus and your brother and your sister amen don't meddle don't be a busybody in other people's business don't be telling others what to do and what not to do but it's perfectly in order if you want to pray with john peter if you want to go pray with john that's okay i think that's an order that would be so helpful and so encouraging to john but that's between jesus and john amen you know if we could just get that revelation just care about people amen pray with them we don't really care about anything else because god has not put it in our hands our job is whatever we find good to do do it with all our heart all of our might go wash somebody's feet help somebody pray with somebody that's what god's given you to do not tell them about something we don't even know look at peter walking around oh you know john he's not going to die jesus told me he's not going to die the bible says that's not what he said we could come to church and hear something and walk home with a wrong understanding of what was really even said and you could be sitting right next to the presence of jesus because peter was right next to jesus when that happened but he wasn't in the spirit he was in the flesh because if he would have been in the spirit that would have never been you don't misunderstand jesus is giving us a message and this is what our focus needs to be to fully completely follow jesus not half-hearted not on sundays and wednesdays not just when you need him amen not when it's convenient for you not just when your flesh gets something out of it or when you can know a little something about somebody else no but follow him completely get more serious about why you're here at church that you're going to leave church with something some instructions from jesus to follow him closer your job peter my chosen disciple with the keys of the kingdom is just to keep following me closer and closer and closer that's it it's the first instructions i gave you when i met you it's the last instructions i give you before i leave here [Music] we get to a place where we think well we're already following jesus something is wrong that's why we get off track i want you to keep planting your potatoes don't worry about other people's potatoes i just want you to focus on me on what i'm telling you to do don't be curious or concerned about what i tell your brothers and sisters just follow me you know we always want to be telling people what to do we ought to be more serious about getting instructions from jesus what he wants us to do too often our focus becomes anything but what christ wants us to do today we often end up pursuing our own goals following our own desires or wanting to know what's behind everything that's happening in the comos world cosmos world that's right what's happening out there what's happening out there well that thing is just ever evolving and ever growing and never getting weirder and we're just like so much want to know till we're never satisfied we wake up and want to know again what's more right true just follow me follow me not the world amen this world's falling apart we gotta focus on what god wants us to do amen don't even give two minutes about wha what about my brother what about my sister what are they gonna do if we're following christ we'll know what we'll do with our brother and sister all we need to do is hold the door open for him pray for them wash their feet that's what you do for your brother and sister well brother john i got barely got enough time to do my own stuff i can't be helping somebody like that i'd rather just sit and tell them what i think they should do think about what i'm saying follow me follow me not do what we want to do do what christ tells us to do amen you know when i say follow me i'm not telling you follow me and jesus saying follow me big difference don't ever follow me follow christ amen amen if you see i'm going towards christ then you follow christ if paul wants to say follow me as i follow christ that's good i'm not paul you follow christ amen yes god wants us focusing on our job and what he tells us to do it may seem like sometimes useless potatoes but plant them anyways god is looking for obedience he doesn't need our intelligence he needs us to follow him that's right when we look at our relationship with god we need to consider what is most important about that relationship and that is are we following what he told us to do do we even have a relationship to where we hear what he says and we actually do what he tells us to do that's a strong statement but it's a needful jesus says i have many things to tell you god is not lacking for things to tell us we may be lacking of wanting to know them we may be just concerned about making to church going to heaven that's it come on look at it the bride is going to be dressed and she's going to be just like jesus are we laying down our life for others or is it just the ones we choose to are we just getting others to lay down their lives for us where is our burden for souls we need to keep our eyes on the author and the finisher of our faith like many carnal or vanity relationships we're always wanting to get something from the other person our relationship with jesus can often slip in that category brother bam talks about making an iron boy out of him i read one quote brother brandon says god is not obligated to your desires he's obligated to his word so what about what jesus wants amen for you we're not serving some picture we're not serving some formal message we're not our relationship doesn't consist of some badge that says on bride i can prove it on bride god's alive and i'll say it like this that our relationship needs to be pulsating with instructions from jesus what he wants us to do now that's what our relationship should be something that's alive something that's real amen seeing we're in the message that you got this picture here we got the ten commandments here here's my badge i'm in the message no we don't understand testify anytime any day this is the last thing god told me this is what he wants me to do this is what i'm pursuing this is the change that's happening in my life that's where allah our relationship needs to be amen that's not happening that we need to press into christ you can't blame the preaching because i'm telling you ain't no different if you just sit and listen to the messages sit listen to messages live stream all you want i'm telling you the thing needs to be real to you that's true undoubtedly jesus has instructions for us he's not slack concerning his promises and he's not slack concerning giving us instructions we have instructions from god i remember as a young christian god was speaking to me and i didn't catch it and i'm sure it's happened many times since then but i just remember the remember at the beginning maybe we've been too busy for him to find our instructions maybe we've been too proud to receive them too tired when they're being spoken too angry or frustrated to even care think about it but god has given us instructions he has instructions for our relationship instructions that we need to be carrying out instructions to plant our potatoes that's right our potatoes do we care enough to pay the price to receive him to carry out the instructions until jesus comes because that's exactly what he told peter follow me peter could have said i am following you i'm here with you we never considered that we're not following jesus well that'd be a slap in the face of peter peter you weren't following jesus don't get focused on somebody else don't get focused on this world follow jesus there was a an ad in a paper and a fortune 500 company was needing an executive to fill a position and so as the people read the ad and they began to set up interviews and they came to this skyscraper and one by one they went in for interviews and as they came into the room they noticed that there was a pile of bricks sitting to the one side of the room and they thought well this is kind of odd because i'm here for an executive position and the man the the higher hiree asked the questions uh to try to get to know a little bit about this man and after a few questions he said okay we'd like you to go ahead and and just take these bricks over here and then move them all over to this side of the room would you do that for us and many of them were disgusted at the thought of doing that because they had their tie on they came in for an executive position it's not a labor and they stormed out mad and angry i i'm not a labor i didn't come here to do this this is a crazy place anyways i've never been in an interview like this yeah and so they kept going through a number of them and no one was willing to move those bricks until they found one that would move the bricks but when he was asked again to move him back over there he just ran out and just said forget this place so this one man came he moved the bricks and when they asked him to move him back he moved him back and he said hey is there anything else you want me to do he said yeah there's one more thing i want you to do i want you to get here tomorrow morning you're hired there's your office over there because he could follow instructions who cares about ability if you can't trust somebody it's worthless that's right and it's worthless to god if he can't trust us he just wants us to follow him amen plant potatoes it may seem so silly so much does it this is not what i'm a church for this is not why i come to church obviously the man was hungry to follow instructions he was willing to pay the price and that's what god is looking for someone who's willing to follow him like that not just wealth no way i'm not doing that i'm not doing that i'm not i am not i am not coming to church early to pray i am not going to say afterwards to pray move the bricks plant the potatoes we've got to trust god is leading his pride amen to get ready turn with me if you went to matthew chapter 19 verse 25 amen when jesus was expressing just how hard it was to be saved his disciples could hardly believe it they were just amazed when his disciples heard it they were exceeding amazed saying who then can be saved but jesus beheld them said unto them with men this is impossible with god all things are possible then peter said unto him behold we have forsaken all and follow thee what shall we have therefore in other words what more can we actually do than what we've done and jesus tells them and jesus said to them very i say unto you that ye which have followed me in the regeneration when the son of man sit shall sit in the throne of his glory that's your heart friends at your heart friends that's where god is glorified when he sits on the throne of your heart he also shall sit upon the twelve thrones judging the twelve trials of israel and everyone that have forsaken houses brothers and sisters fathers mothers wife children lands for my name's sake shall receive a hundredfold and shall inherit everlasting life that word regeneration is spiritual restoration of the new birth and we have to follow christ to that amen not just saying well i've been baptized i repented i've accepted the message and i'm born again that isn't it that is part of it but that is not it every day that you're alive you have a chance to become more like christ yes but if your vision that you're concerned you ain't worried about it you ain't interested in it it just happened if it's going to happen if it don't it don't you have to keep following me he has something special for us saints he has a nature change a nature think about that to a place where somebody can hit you and you don't hate them i'm talking about that you can't manufacture that amen somebody can can despitefully use you and it don't bother you you pray for them that's a nature change it's not just message joining regeneration is not message joining we need to keep following jesus to the end amen we need to not only be willing to follow the most ridiculous instructions of planting potatoes but we need to remember that god is leading us to get ready for a rapture amen some of the things that god asked us to do have nothing to do with itself nature change and rapture but has everything to do with our character change changing our character that he wants to be around in other words he may ask you to do something a little bit different than me and it may actually not even be spiritual but it has everything to do with our character he if you were going to have a business a family uh a kingdom would you want to be surrounded with people of light precious faith light precious character light precious love would you like somebody that was always stirring up the nest always trying to stir things up and no i mean jesus got rid of lucifer got him out of the kingdom you want to be proud i resist you so god is working on us amen he's getting us ready he knows what he's doing he's building a glorious church without spot or wrinkle amen a tabernacle not made with hands a magnificent cathedral for god to dwell in that's what god is building inside of each of us yes turn with me to first peter chapter two first peter chapter two verse five ye also as lively stones are built up a spiritual house uh a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god by jesus christ now how many today in church and just be honest you thought i i shouldn't have to praise god anymore than i'm doing right now i'm praising god enough i i i wasn't watching i i i i don't know who was praising god i don't know if it was brother mark or who it was but it was wonderful it was wonderful to build an atmosphere that god wants to be in yes it makes our flesh feel uncomfortable but it needs to be i feel i'm so short of god's glory so short of giving him the glory he's worthy of amen why would i entertain thoughts of i'm worshiping him enough i shouldn't have to do it anymore so may the praise be stronger more heartfelt more of a sacrifice [Music] that's what we're called to be to to offer up spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to god by jesus christ ephesians chapter 2 verse 19. ephesians 2 verse 19 now therefore year no more strangers and foreigners but fellow citizens with the saints and of the household of god and are built upon the foundation the apostles and prophets jesus christ himself being the chief cornerstone in whom all the building fitly framed together now what do they do they sit like a bump on log no they groweth onto a holy temple in the lord in whom you also are builded together for a habitation through the spirit god wants to use our vessels what may seem is idle potatoes or vain may be a very important part of our character building amen of god's tabernacle right now because it's about god's tabernacle did you ever have to do something and you wonder why you had to do it like this is crazy this is in vain god doesn't make us do anything in vain there's always something behind what god's asking us to do god is leading us to a complete regeneration a complete spiritual restoration of a new birth yes amen we didn't just join the message right yeah i don't want to be part of that group are you part of the message i don't know what does that mean there's a lot of weird things in the message i want what brother brandon brought through that message to be living in me after the great fire of 1666 in which london was just burnt really bad there was a traveler that was going by and they were building and they he came across this one area that they were trying to build and they were laying bricks and there was three bricklayers and he was wondering what they were going to build there so he just he asked the first one what are you doing and he said oh i'm laying bricks i'm working as hard as i can i'm trying to make a living for my family the man wasn't quite satisfied so he asked a second bricklayer what are you doing he said oh i'm a builder and i'm building this wall he still wasn't satisfied with what they were actually building there so he asked the third person the third bricklayer what are you doing and with the grin he looks at him and says oh i'm building a cathedral for the god almighty to dwell in [Music] and a lot of times we can just come to church because it's monday or wednesday or sunday and wednesday or we could just come to church because we're going to make a a career out of it i've said it i'm going to make a career we're just going to build this wall or we can come to church with a vision i've got to find out where i'm at with god because i'm going to build a cathedral for god to dwell in amen yes there ain't nothing more than satan would want us to think that well you know god's in you the moment you ask him in your heart and that's all you need to do just bypass everything else why does our life get to a place where we should just just bricks just laying bricks no vision just make a career to go to church i guess just take my family go to church but where is the interest of making your life a place for god almighty to have his way in don't you want god to make a cathedral to you first peter chapter two keep following god's instructions because he knows what he wants exactly you to be amen don't worry about your brother don't worry about your sister first peter chapter 2 verse 9 but you're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation a peculiar people that you should show forth the praises of him that called you out of darkness into his marvelous light which in times past were not a people but are now the people of god you ever had your parents tell you how old are you act your age well we're the people of god act like it right amen which have not which had had not obtained mercy but now have obtained mercy in other words that means you should be showing mercy to others yes at one time when you didn't have mercy i can see you beating somebody else over the head but now that you have obtained mercy you should be given mercy dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul now god purchased your soul at calvary but it still has a free more agent and when yielded to the wrong things it can bring you downs spiritually so we have to learn to crucify the flesh and abstain from fleshly lust which war against the soul even though your soul is saved they're still uh oh satan don't want to give up and he'll do everything to get you to lose your soul right yes but god not only purchased our souls he purchased our bodies it belongs to him god also not only bought your your soul at calvary but he bought your temple amen amen first corinthians chapter 6 verse 19. why do you buy your temple to dwell in it amen he wants to dwell in it amen first corinthians chapter 6 verse 19 what know ye not that your body is the temple of the holy ghost which is in you which ye have of god and you are not your own you were bought don't be telling god he can't do what he wants to do with you second corinthians chapter six second corinthians chapter six verse 16 what agreement at the temple of god with idols think about these things that war against your soul for ye are the temple of the living god as god has said i will dwell in them and i will walk in them and i will be their god and they shall be my people wherefore come out from among them and be separate saith the lord and touch not the unclean thing and i will receive you amen and will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the lord almighty now when we were in the did not when we were in the world i didn't even understand the difference between denomination and non-denomination well that scripture you know you come out of the world you start going to church you think you're separated and the prophet came and he taught us in the church of laodicea was a denomination and to come out of her my people we read it in revelations to be separated from that right well unfortunately when we left the world and we left the denominations the spirit of darkness didn't stay over there things that still war against us we constantly have to separate things jump on us we got to get them off don't get to a place where you think while you've separated enough you understand what i'm saying because things can get on us we could watch something all of a sudden before you know it we're not praying very much we're not interested in other people's souls we have no burden we don't want to come to church to to to pray it just before you know it it's just all about us we need to separate yes we need to separate to follow christ means to follow his instructions and god has instructions for us many of them the bride is not sitting down she's not idle she knows her days are numbered she has applied her heart to wisdom and whatsoever her hand's fine to do she's doing it with all her might yes amen i'm speaking to the bride this is sheep food the bride has received her instructions and has followed christ and the bride is receiving her instructions and is following those instructions and at times it may seem in vain what i got to do i just come and pray every time i come early what difference does it make nothing happens plant your potatoes nothing is in vain what god tells you to do amen in the message questions and answers on the seals brother and said jesus come tomorrow you be found faithful right at the duty you be found faithful at the duty if you're building a church go on and put it up so uh i told us talking to brother mike earlier today god and uh just talking a little bit about how close it is to the end and how crazy things are and and uh he said well by the time i get the church all done the doors will be closed we won't be able to use it anyways and i was just teasing but brother brandon put it real good here he says if you're building a church go on and put it up i'd rather be putting my money in something like that can be found with it in my pocket so keep on continue as you are everybody understand now congregation says amen continue right on just go right on as you are now just don't stop just go right on just as you are keep on serving the lord yes amen no for instance if you were working for a man and you known it was 15 minutes before quitting time well you'd say oh just 15 minutes now so i might as well just go over and sit down he says you'd get dot for those 15 minutes right right he says if you're planting wheat plant your wheat right right you're digging potatoes go on and dig them out you say well nobody will eat them anyways he said that don't make a difference right right dig them out anyways yes just continuous here see this is powerful to me because it doesn't matter if i can see with my eyes whether it's it's going to work or not if it's going to be useless or not or helpful or not god is looking for me to be obedient that's what the prophet is teaching me here we've gotten so much off into our own little thing that we left god's thing he said oh my if i know brother says he was coming to tomorrow and i was a farmer i'd put my crop in today now you tell me what sane man would do that nobody in the world would do that but the bride will because she ain't interested in what she's going to get out of that crop she's putting in she's interested in following him all the way sure he made me a farmer i'm going to stay right with at my duty that's right yes he said we must be a sane solid christian we can say amen in this hour to that one we must be a sane solid christian see amen that i'm put here to work right up to the last minute got a job to do i'll be right found faithful at my post of duty if he comes this morning i want to be standing right here in the pulpit you say brother branham if he was coming this morning shouldn't you be out there he said no sir this is my post of duty amen i'll be standing right here preaching when he comes saying the same things that i that's good i read that i thought you know we're all wanting to hear the most important thing it's got to be something that seems you know really important to me what's important is what god gives you not what you think is important it shouldn't have to go through your filter of wow this is important this isn't important you're like well it's not important for me to move those bricks over there what's important is you know what executive position am i going to be doing who am i going to be bossing around saying the same things i am then when he comes i'll just move right on out with him see he says if i'm holding potatoes i'll just be holding away just as hard as i can and when he comes i'll drop the hole and take off amen how important it is to be doing what jesus wants you to do amen amen and don't be thinking that it doesn't matter right it's true amen because you might get caught off wondering what's happening with brother so-and-so right what is it to thee what is it to you if i would will so and so right right is so-and-so going to be here when the rapture take what is it to you right follow me i got a job for you amen i gave you talents i gave you pounds what are you doing with what i've given you amen whatever your hands find to do do it with all your might yes you know i would love a relationship that i could get up in the morning and there'd be no doubt in my mind god just writes it on a piece of paper this is it son this is what your job is today that ain't going to happen how many times have you let your child do something just to watch them what they're going to do did you i'm sure we've all done this as parents you give a piece of candy to one of them and you say share it and you want to see if they share it if they break it in half if they give them the bigger half or they take it and you're watching all this stuff at least i did right well god hands us what we all have our space of time right and he says occupy i'm watching you what are you going to do whatever your hands find good to do you are not going to have a chance when this life is over to wish i would did a little bit more for jesus i looked for a soul that's right this is it there's only chance you have well he didn't tell me he didn't tell you he told all his disciples to go yelp always you're saying you're not his disciple we're all called to be missionaries what message what what message you listen what part of the message are you listening to plant your potatoes it may seem in vain but plant them whatever god told you to do do it do it with all your heart all your might do it do it do it pray with your brother pray with your sister get him going amen god's coming soon amen you got time for a couple quotes this should be encouraging this is a message called oneness he says we know we make mistakes but you must look at that it's not your mistakes because you're always going to have them but you see it's following his rules it's following what he said do stumble and falling doesn't have one thing to do with it a real true servant if he'll stumble he'll get up again if he wobbles god pulls him right back in the path yes now listen to this as long as he's in the path of duty that's so important because if you're all kind of doing your own thing this is this that little it's like the two little word if you got to be with all your heart wanting to be in god's duty your your place where you where he's called you to be what you should be doing and then if you wobble you stumble you fall god pick you up but your heart is somewhere else besides the duty of god god's not obligated to death that's good but but if he's off the path of duty god's not obligated to him brother branham said but as long as he's in the path of duty god's obligated to him knowing that he's just a man or a woman amen he's obligated that person as long as they're in the path of duty now i'll just say it like this follow me if you're following him with everything he told you to do you're in the path of duty right but you this that don't matter don't expect guys not obligated that right in other words you got to have the attitude a humble attitude all right one more this is in the message a court trial brother man says now when a man plants a seed if you're a farmer or know anything about planting any seed if you plant a seed today some corn say you put it in your garden and tomorrow morning you go out and dig it up and look at it and say well there's no difference in it you plant it back and the next day you you go back and look at it and say there's no difference in it it will never come up it can't do it when you dug it up you spoiled the picture right there you've got to commit it to the earth and then it's up to the earth to do the rest of it amen don't be double-minded amen you plant a seed you say amen to the word you say i'm gonna do it you do it don't dig it up amen committed to god commit your situation to god amen the bible says if you commit your ways to the lord he will direct your paths but you got to commit it to him don't dig it up the next day commit it and let it go god is looking for our faith and every time that you look at your symptoms every time you look at your symptoms and testify about them complain about them god can never heal you he says you committed to god and believe his word and he'll bring it to pass whether it's sprouting whether it's whatever it's doing you don't care god promised it and potentially you have your healing when you accept it in seed form yes i'll just say every promise in the book is like that amen look i know it's hard we all want feelings we all want something to associate that this stand that we're taking with god is the right one and that we're not going to be disappointed but you can't go there you just got to take god and his word and believe it with everything you've got inside of you and let the chips fall where they're going to fall because one thing god can't lie god cannot lie amen amen he's looking for us to to hold on he's looking for shall we find faith in the end time when he comes he said if i ask you for an oak tree and you give me an acorn potentially i have an oak tree that's right and if i asked you for an ear of corn and you gave me a grain of corn potentially i have an ear corn yes then i commit it to the ground and water it and keep all the weeds away from it that would draw the strength from the ground around it i keep the weeds out separate yourself amen i love that then it'll automatically grow because it's committed yes and it's a germatic seed now if the seed isn't germatized it won't that's right but if the seed is germ of life in it there's nothing that can keep it from growing what was that oh oh no i'm i'm so sorry if i my brother if i knew that was your phone i would have never said a word i thought it was my fault i was going to apologize for that well praise the lord saints god has given us a chance in our life to grow and to become his the very image of christ it's nothing that we can just well i got baptized and it's up to him if he's going to do it if i'm no you've got to care about this situation you got to be involved you got to be willing to make sacrifices you got to be willing to to do things that you don't want to do to bring to pass what god is called us to do if we are seed brother ram says we're going to come forth that's right but how many people are not seed that satan is told hey your seed don't worry about it it's going to come and what's he trying to do he's trying to get the people off from separating more from the world from from consecrating their lives more to god for more prayer more pressing into the kingdom that's what satan's doing all honesty we don't know who's who think about it right we don't know who's who brother branham didn't know who's who that's right when the spirit of the lord came he could tell if there was a a kindred spirit there if it was of god or not but he don't know who's who he says us ministers don't know we just throw the net out [Music] so it'd be wrong for just me to send a message to you oh yeah your bride don't matter what you do i'd rather send the message your bride no act like the bride not saying you're not bright and just saying we got to tally up to what the prophet taught us we got to start following jesus not just add more to doing that jesus he's given us instructions every time we come to church amen let's stand together god bless you amen let's go before the lord in prayer every eye close every head bound mine is as well in your heart you're desiring to follow the lord closer if your heart's been pricked and know that you've been following jesus from afar and you want to follow him closer maybe you've taken some certain things lightly maybe you've been interested in just other people's lives but today you just want to consecrate yourself and focus on following the lord closer just your heart you say brother john this is my heart i want you to pray unite with me i'm i'll say to you saints i'm here uniting with you in prayer this is your desire i believe the bible says if just two or three would agree on touching any one thing it'd be established i'll say if you feel strong about your relationship with the lord would you pray for me would you pray for me i want to follow jesus closer than i've been following him i want to hear his instructions i'm going to follow those instructions i'm going to plant my potatoes i want a home i want to do all that he's called me to do amen amen our gracious heavenly father we come to you at the close of the service i want to thank you for your word lord i want to thank you lord that even in this hour that we still hear you calling us to follow you that it's not a distant voice it's not something that was for somebody else but lord it was for us oh i thank you for that personal relationship that closeness lord thank you for drawing us close to you lord i pray for every heart here lord every every desire inside of each one that lord desires to follow you closer lord would you meet with them right now lord as we unite together in faith lord we we commit this to you lord that we will walk closer to you lord we'll get our eyes off the things of the world we'll get our eyes off of the the nonsense and the the the negativity lord the the things that would even be wrong in the church as it were just focus on following you lord praying one for another lord for that word declares it's a love that covers a multitude of sin amen lord we need your love this little church lord our lives we just need you lord strengthen us lord strengthen us heavenly father that we may follow you help us to be faithful lord even with those things that may seem not very important but yet they're important to you because you told us to do them lord and lord i pray that you reward us reward us lord with your presence reward us with strength lord with faith lord every time the enemy comes against us the things that the things that war against our soul lord oh god we need you and i pray that you'd reward us with more holy ghosts with more wisdom to to count our days nor dinner days are numbered remind us lord to to to to do all that we can while we have this life while we're still living remind us lord bring our our thoughts back to the things that you've spoken lord we commit ourselves to you lord we thank you for these things we thank you for what

days o teach us to number our day we may apply our hearts on to wisdom nor teach us to number our days one more time teach us to number our day o teach us to number our days that we may apply our heart son to wisdom lord teach us to number our days amen praise the lord you know what wisdom tells me wisdom tells me that when we get on the other side there will not be one person who wishes they spent less time looking for souls wisdom tells me today that if there are any regrets there'll be regrets that more time wasn't for the lord teach us a number of days amen can we sing that song he's the great example the pattern for me i don't know the name of that [Music] i love this [Music] sing it to him amen sweet are the promises mind is the word dare farther than any [Music] mind of message

the way all the way you know the most important thing was when we gave our heart to jesus isn't that the most important thing most important day of our life why don't we do that every day every day do the same thing and i think that's what it means to deny yourself pick up your cross and follow me amen can we just sing one more it's about uh the children of israel they didn't want to keep following all the all the way many started in the race but couldn't keep up with the pace i'm going through praise the lord [Music] praise the lord lord i have started to walk in the light [Music] [Music] and i'm going through i'm going through yes i'm going through i'll pay the price whatever others do i'll take the [Music] oh there are many who start in the race [Music] others accept it because it is true but not very many expect to go through what about you i'm going through yes i'm going through i'll pay the prize whatever others do i'll take the [Music] i'd rather walk with jesus [Music] my pathway [Music] whatever others do i'll take the way [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] despite [Music] amen i am determined i've made up my mind amen i hear hear brother branham saying get back in line get back in line thanks that's it that's it praise god praise god that he's alive and that we we still hear him we hear his voice i want to be louder and stronger and full feelings and emotions but this flesh doesn't want to pay that price but i think if i stay there long enough in prayer god will come amen may the lord be with you and bless you and give you many many blessings amen amen for following him amen could ask our precious brother bruce if he would close the service in when we prayer up in the morning say bless the lord amen the lord is
