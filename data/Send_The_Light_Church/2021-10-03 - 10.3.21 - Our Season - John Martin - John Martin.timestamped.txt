[10:24] amen well i just like to change the
[10:26] order of service a little bit here
[10:28] um our sister kathleen i believe is
[10:31] going to give a testimony
[10:33] and then we'll take up some prayer
[10:34] requests you want to come forth sister
[10:47] hi
[10:48] good to be back in the house of the lord
[10:51] um
[10:52] my testimony is about my illness
[10:55] and i just wanted to tell all of you at
[10:57] one time what's going on with me
[11:00] um
[11:01] first of all i'm not hoarse at all today
[11:03] praise the lord i've been up north for a
[11:05] week and
[11:06] haven't been around any cleaning fluids
[11:08] or any pts or anything and just relaxing
[11:11] so i'm sure that'll help but
[11:13] i know you've been praying for me all
[11:15] summer
[11:16] and
[11:17] i went to university of michigan
[11:20] about three weeks ago
[11:22] um i got an answer from
[11:24] and i know it was from the lord
[11:26] but i have a neurological disease called
[11:28] als
[11:30] um
[11:32] it's fatal
[11:33] there's um
[11:34] no one that's ever survived it
[11:36] um except one man who had stem cell
[11:39] excuse me i'm trying to get my cough
[11:41] drop
[11:43] disease and he lived about three years
[11:45] and then
[11:46] passed away from a brain tumor
[11:49] but
[11:49] [Music]
[11:53] i serve a great god
[11:55] and this is what i told the doctor
[11:57] when she asked me what was on my bucket
[11:59] list
[12:00] i said my bucket list
[12:02] there's nothing on my bucket list except
[12:04] making a rapture
[12:05] you know
[12:06] so but i think i should kind of shocked
[12:08] her but i just said there's nothing on
[12:10] my bucket list
[12:12] i i know the lord can do a work in me
[12:18] this is not like lou gehrig's disease
[12:20] it's different
[12:22] and the way she explained it to me was
[12:23] that there was
[12:25] an umbrella called als like there is flu
[12:28] and there's many different
[12:30] types of als that fall into that
[12:32] category
[12:33] mine is
[12:34] familiar or genetic
[12:36] they're thinking because my sister
[12:39] tomorrow will be at the same doctor
[12:42] getting her diagnosis
[12:44] she's been going through more than i've
[12:46] been going through she can hardly walk
[12:48] and so
[12:51] anyways it's a progressive disease
[12:53] mine has
[12:55] been my arm
[13:01] and
[13:02] so mine is right sided
[13:04] familiar genetic
[13:06] type of als
[13:08] which i never even heard of before
[13:10] there's only about 5 000 patients in
[13:13] the united states
[13:14] and in michigan i think about 200
[13:17] and i doubt if there's any two sisters
[13:20] that are going through this at the same
[13:21] time
[13:22] a long time ago
[13:25] i went before the lord
[13:27] because of this church
[13:31] like isaiah did
[13:32] and i said lord use me to save my family
[13:36] i'm the only one saved i have been for
[13:39] 38 years
[13:41] no
[13:42] and you see no hope on the horizon
[13:44] whatsoever
[13:45] until
[13:46] i got this diagnosis
[13:48] and i did testify a little bit on our
[13:50] stream about that how my sister
[13:53] she wanted a bible and she's been
[13:54] reading the bible she's given
[13:57] brought two of her friends bibles i mean
[13:59] it's just kind of crazy how the lord
[14:01] works you know i just you pray and you
[14:03] pray and you pray and you think lord are
[14:04] you ever going to answer my prayers
[14:07] but he has answered my prayers
[14:09] and
[14:11] i know you're praying for my healing and
[14:12] i'm praying for it too and i believe
[14:14] with all my heart
[14:16] that i will not die from als
[14:19] i i'm telling you right now i just
[14:21] believe it
[14:22] okay
[14:23] and and there's
[14:25] there's nothing else i can say when i
[14:27] say that to people they think i'm nuts
[14:29] but i'm telling you
[14:32] because of this church
[14:34] and the faith that god has put in my
[14:36] heart
[14:37] these last 19 years of being here
[14:40] i can stand up here and i can say that
[14:43] and
[14:46] with humility okay with god's grace and
[14:50] his mercy
[14:51] is that it will be
[14:54] a testimony to my sister for her
[14:57] salvation my other two sisters who are
[14:59] so liberal
[15:01] you can't even believe it
[15:04] but you know what
[15:06] their their hearts have turned because
[15:09] of this diagnosis
[15:10] and i've prayed that the lord
[15:14] would not take it from me
[15:16] until his will is accomplished
[15:19] in what he gave it to me for and i know
[15:21] that there is a purpose
[15:23] but when i stood before the lord and
[15:25] said lord send me
[15:27] i meant every
[15:28] everything about it
[15:30] and if this is what it has to be then so
[15:32] be it
[15:33] so be it
[15:35] i couldn't stand here and say that today
[15:38] if it wasn't for sin the light because
[15:40] then the light
[15:42] has brought
[15:43] that faith of a mustard seed to fruition
[15:48] and we have seen miracles
[15:50] we we have seen jessica ward walk in
[15:54] here who was hit by a train and has half
[15:56] a brain and shouldn't be and her blind
[15:59] she was blind she's not she's going to
[16:01] college she's a wonderful beautiful girl
[16:04] and so many other things
[16:06] have happened here maybe people will
[16:08] consider little miracles
[16:11] but anyways i want to just testify that
[16:15] this is what it is and and
[16:18] brother marty has been
[16:20] my rock through everything
[16:23] he shouldn't be sitting here either
[16:25] there's no reason why that man should
[16:27] have lived through an a triple a an
[16:30] abdominal aortic aneurysm except for
[16:32] god's grace
[16:33] and that he has a purpose here like
[16:36] every one of us here do
[16:39] so be faithful
[16:40] and and
[16:42] and just pray for me for strength sister
[16:44] cheryl gave me some good advice a couple
[16:46] months ago
[16:47] and she said i just quit praying for
[16:49] myself i just asked for god to give me
[16:52] strength to get through another day
[16:54] and be a witness for him and that's what
[16:56] i want
[16:58] i want to have her strength she's been
[16:59] going through this for 10 years
[17:01] you know and
[17:03] i can't say that
[17:05] my situation is any worse than hers or
[17:07] hers is worse than mine
[17:08] or any other of you here that suffer in
[17:11] any way shape or form be it mental
[17:13] physical
[17:14] or psychological or spiritual
[17:16] you know
[17:17] we all we all need the strength and i
[17:19] just asked brother john if i could
[17:22] tell you all at one time what i'm going
[17:24] through so you're not wondering
[17:26] um and yeah yeah i've had some bad days
[17:29] i'm not going to tell you i haven't had
[17:30] some bad days
[17:31] i can hardly reach my arm
[17:34] so it's really hard to get things out of
[17:35] the cover i'm in pt two and a half hours
[17:38] a couple times a week i can hardly
[17:40] breathe when i come out of there because
[17:41] of the cleaning and disinfectants and
[17:43] stuff i'm allergic to but i got to keep
[17:46] going
[17:47] and my doctor said my my dr brownstein
[17:50] who of my
[17:52] 30 years he's taken care of me
[17:54] holistically
[17:55] just keep walking kathleen
[17:57] and when he said keep walking kathleen
[18:00] that was the holy spirit saying just
[18:02] keep walking forward kathleen
[18:04] he's given me a promise and i'm going to
[18:06] stand on it
[18:07] and i thank you from the bottom of my
[18:09] heart that you believe
[18:12] that i have brothers and sisters of like
[18:14] faith that believe like
[18:16] i do and can lift we can lift one
[18:18] another up during these times
[18:21] so i'm sorry i can't be much help around
[18:23] here as much as i used to be but
[18:26] you have a wonderful sunday school
[18:27] teacher now
[18:29] and you have a beautiful music ministry
[18:31] here i am playing the dulcimer at home
[18:33] it's good for my hand and stuff but
[18:35] i'm just not coordinated enough to do
[18:38] a lot of things anymore that i used to
[18:39] do
[18:40] i'm still quilting
[18:43] it's good for my mind
[18:46] praise the lord cheryl has a greenhouse
[18:48] i have my quilts
[18:51] god bless you
[18:53] [Applause]
[19:02] hallelujah um
[19:05] you know
[19:08] it's pretty simple uh sometimes we make
[19:11] things complicated but uh
[19:13] we're just called to believe
[19:19] so sometimes you think well i don't see
[19:21] things happening
[19:23] and
[19:25] but you know you gotta look what spirit
[19:27] you gotta look with spiritual eyes you
[19:29] know so because you know god is a spirit
[19:32] right so
[19:34] we can't look with these carnal eyes or
[19:37] not only will you be discouraged
[19:39] but uh
[19:40] that's what the devil wants you to do he
[19:43] wants you to look with your natural eyes
[19:45] and not just spiritual eyes
[19:47] because
[19:48] god is a spirit and
[19:51] all things are possible and
[19:54] i think that's the testimony that they
[19:56] are
[19:58] we all have
[19:59] you know
[20:00] there's always been a time i think
[20:03] there's always a time in somebody's life
[20:04] where god speaks to him
[20:07] and shows them something
[20:10] and you just need to stand on that
[20:12] you know
[20:13] because it might be 20 years might be 30
[20:15] years it might
[20:17] you know you might not even see it in
[20:18] your lifetime but it will happen
[20:22] because god's the same yesterday today
[20:24] and he's not a liar
[20:27] so amen
[20:28] so just as we go into these other prayer
[20:30] requests just remember that uh it's in
[20:34] god's times but
[20:36] they are
[20:38] god answers prayers
[20:40] amen let's just remember to lift up

[38:59] what a blessing
[39:01] it is to see sister trina and at least
[39:03] two of her daughters here today
[39:06] amen
[39:10] ecclesiastes chapter three
[39:13] starting what verse 1
[39:18] to everything there is a season
[39:20] and a time to every purpose under the
[39:22] sun under the heaven
[39:24] a time to be born
[39:26] a time to die a time to plant a time to
[39:29] pluck up that
[39:31] which is planted
[39:33] and i want to drop down to verse 11
[39:36] he have made everything beautiful in his
[39:38] time
[39:40] also you have set the world in their
[39:42] hearts so that no man can find out the
[39:44] work that god
[39:47] maketh from the beginning
[39:49] to the end
[39:50] god bless you may be seated we want to
[39:52] entitle this message today our season
[39:56] as for a subject to become one
[40:00] there was a season for us to be here on
[40:02] leroy street
[40:04] this season started
[40:06] 20 years or over 20 years ago
[40:08] 20 years in february of 2001 actually
[40:12] and now that season has come to an end
[40:14] for all of us
[40:16] to everything there is a season
[40:19] and a time to every purpose under the
[40:21] heaven
[40:23] a time to be born a time to die a time
[40:25] to plant a time to pluck up
[40:28] that which is planted
[40:31] there are a lot of purposes under heaven
[40:34] we could say that god has used this
[40:36] season here for many purposes
[40:40] but i want to draw our attention
[40:42] to one particular that each of us have
[40:44] been predestined to
[40:46] and we find that in ephesians chapter 1
[40:48] verse 11
[40:50] in whom also we have obtained an
[40:53] inheritance
[40:54] being predestinated
[40:56] according to the purpose
[40:58] of him that worketh all things
[41:01] after the council of his own will amen
[41:06] even
[41:06] when we are so stubborn and we want to
[41:08] do our own thing
[41:12] god is really in control
[41:18] we
[41:18] may
[41:20] uh
[41:21] resist to do god's will in our life
[41:25] but god is going to fulfill his will
[41:28] he's going to make all things work
[41:30] together after the council of his will
[41:32] and we the elect of god
[41:34] i say the elect have been predestinated
[41:38] for that purpose
[41:41] amen
[41:43] god's purpose for our lives
[41:46] we've been predestined to carry it out
[41:48] not in just
[41:50] a general way but
[41:52] a particular purpose
[41:54] to everything there is a season and a
[41:56] time to every purpose under heaven amen
[42:00] but i want to draw our attention to a
[42:01] particular purpose that god had in his
[42:04] mind at the very beginning before there
[42:06] was a beginning amen god has always
[42:10] wanted a family
[42:14] ephesians 3 verse 14 says for this cause
[42:17] i bow my knees unto the father of our
[42:20] lord jesus christ
[42:22] of whom the whole family
[42:24] in heaven
[42:25] and earth
[42:26] is named
[42:29] we're all named jesus
[42:31] amen just like adam and eve they were
[42:33] both named adam
[42:38] we're a part of jesus
[42:41] amen there was a season that god
[42:43] actually hid his eternal desire about
[42:46] his family
[42:48] for a family amen
[42:50] i know a lot of people have speculated
[42:52] that
[42:53] god
[42:55] wants
[42:56] to do different things and
[42:58] certainly even in the world people
[43:01] wondered what does god really want
[43:04] what could he what does he really want
[43:06] got all these different churches and all
[43:08] these different beliefs and you got to
[43:10] do this you got to follow that the do's
[43:12] and don'ts
[43:15] but really god has just wanted a family
[43:19] amen
[43:20] god had angels and messengers and
[43:23] cherubians and seraphims and a whole
[43:24] host of angelic beings
[43:27] the bible tells us some just constantly
[43:29] are crying holy holy holy unto the lord
[43:32] amen
[43:33] but something was missing in the heart
[43:36] of god
[43:39] god wanted someone
[43:41] to be in his own image and in his own
[43:45] likeness
[43:48] and obviously those creatures those
[43:51] angelic creatures weren't like that
[43:56] but he wanted someone in his own image
[43:58] in his own likeness to share eternity
[44:01] with
[44:02] ephesians chapter 3 verse 1 says for
[44:05] this cause i paul the prisoner of jesus
[44:07] christ for you gentiles
[44:10] if you have heard of the dispensation
[44:11] the grace of god which is given to me to
[44:14] you word how that by revelation he made
[44:17] known unto me the mystery
[44:19] as i wrote a four
[44:21] in few words you can read a little bit
[44:23] about that in chapter one
[44:25] whereby when you read he may understand
[44:28] my knowledge in the mystery of christ
[44:30] which in other ages was not made known
[44:33] unto the sons of men
[44:35] as it is now revealed unto his holy
[44:38] apostles and prophets
[44:40] by the spirit
[44:42] that the gentiles should be fellow heirs
[44:46] and of the same body
[44:49] and partakers of his promise in christ
[44:52] by the gospel
[44:55] jesus said in john chapter 10 verse 16
[44:58] he said
[44:59] and other sheep i have which are not of
[45:02] this fold them also i must bring
[45:06] and they shall hear my voice
[45:09] and there shall be there shall be one
[45:13] fold and one shepherd amen
[45:16] so god was not only going to bring the
[45:19] jews and gentiles together but he was
[45:22] going to take a bride out of the
[45:24] gentiles to be his wife
[45:26] [Music]
[45:28] ephesians chapter 5 verse 30
[45:31] for we are members of his body
[45:33] and of his flesh
[45:35] and of his bones
[45:38] can you say amen to that
[45:40] for this cause shall a man leave his
[45:43] father
[45:44] and his mother and shall be joined
[45:46] together joined unto his wife and they
[45:49] too shall be one flesh
[45:54] this is a great mystery
[45:57] but really what i'm speaking is
[45:59] concerning christ
[46:00] and the church
[46:04] amen we are to leave our carnal
[46:07] self-centered fleshly
[46:09] will our first nature we're to leave it
[46:12] and be married to the will of christ
[46:16] i speak concerning christ and the church
[46:20] that's what he's talking about but he
[46:21] gave us an example in human life how we
[46:24] can understand how a marriage takes
[46:26] place
[46:29] and yes
[46:30] there are a lot of
[46:32] ruffles in our marriages
[46:36] ones we never thought
[46:39] on our wedding day yesterday we went to
[46:41] a wedding
[46:43] and saw them give their vows
[46:45] if we only knew the problems that we
[46:47] were going to happen after at that
[46:50] moment
[46:53] instead of do you take this
[46:56] woman to be your lawfully wedded wife
[46:58] yes i do
[47:00] we'd probably be saying i gotta think
[47:01] this thing through man i know what i'm
[47:03] gonna be going through
[47:08] god knew how many times we'd fall how
[47:10] many times we'd leave him how many times
[47:11] we feel like quitting right it's true
[47:18] but greater is he that's in you than he
[47:20] that's in the world
[47:23] god wants us to become one
[47:26] amen
[47:27] remember jesus and his disciples in the
[47:29] upper
[47:30] upper chamber at the end
[47:32] of his season on earth
[47:34] it was a very intimate personal time
[47:37] that jesus was having with his apostles
[47:41] with his disciples he said i'm going to
[47:43] come back in the form of the holy ghost
[47:46] and i'm going to be with you forever
[47:48] of course they didn't understand it they
[47:50] didn't they didn't they didn't know
[47:51] about it
[47:54] but he said here in verse 20 of chapter
[47:58] 17 of saint john i said that backwards
[48:02] john 17 verse 20
[48:05] very intimate
[48:07] at the end he's going to send a message
[48:09] he says neither pray i for these alone
[48:12] but i pray
[48:13] for them also which shall believe on me
[48:17] through their word
[48:21] so thankful
[48:23] for the new testament
[48:25] that word that they gave us that we
[48:28] could believe that word from the
[48:29] apostles
[48:31] because jesus was praying for us if we
[48:33] believe amen
[48:35] and he says that they all may be
[48:38] one
[48:39] the very motive that god has for us to
[48:42] become one with him amen
[48:45] as thou father art in me and i in thee
[48:49] that they also may be one in us
[48:53] that the world may believe that thou has
[48:55] sent me and the glory which those gives
[48:57] me i have given them
[48:59] that they may be one even as we are one
[49:01] now that's a very tall order
[49:06] to be one with god to be one with christ
[49:10] or to be one with the word as the word
[49:13] in christ was one with god amen the
[49:16] father
[49:17] that's a tall order amen amen it's much
[49:20] different than joining the church
[49:22] put your name on the book say i'm a
[49:24] believer
[49:30] i could see why the bible says the
[49:31] righteous scarcely make it right
[49:35] it's not as easy as the devil would tell
[49:37] you right it's true
[49:40] it takes a dying out every
[49:42] day this morning when i got on my knees
[49:45] i just
[49:48] when you get on your knees you see how
[49:50] real
[49:51] and rotten your flesh is
[49:53] you don't want to pray
[49:58] don't want to humble itself i don't want
[49:59] to yield to god
[50:02] it wants to go through the motions and
[50:03] say i prayed
[50:05] but god wants our hearts
[50:08] amen
[50:10] he says i in them
[50:13] and thou in me
[50:15] that they may be
[50:17] not just one but me be made perfect
[50:21] in one
[50:23] and that the world may know that thou
[50:26] has sent me
[50:27] and thou has loved them as thou has
[50:30] loved me
[50:32] i wasn't just praying for the apostles
[50:34] then
[50:35] he was praying for you and me amen
[50:41] god
[50:42] wants the world to see jesus in you
[50:46] to see the oneness that you have with
[50:48] christ
[50:51] getting back to ephesians chapter 3
[50:54] verse number 7
[50:56] whereof paul says i am made a minister
[50:59] according to the gift of the grace of
[51:01] god given unto me by the effectual
[51:03] working of his power not to me who am
[51:05] less than the least of all saints i
[51:08] wonder if there's anybody who would like
[51:09] to practice that in the church
[51:12] anybody want to practice being the least
[51:14] of all the saints
[51:17] i say there would be a good spirit among
[51:18] you
[51:20] amen
[51:22] is this grace given that i should preach
[51:25] among the gentiles the unsearchable
[51:28] riches of christ
[51:30] and to make all men see
[51:33] what is the fellowship of the mystery
[51:37] which from the beginning of the world
[51:39] had been hidden god who created all
[51:41] things by jesus christ
[51:43] to the intent
[51:45] that now unto the principalities and
[51:46] powers in heavenly places might be made
[51:49] known by the church
[51:51] who's supposed to let the world know
[51:54] the church
[51:55] the manifold wisdom of god
[52:00] he orchestrated this thing from the
[52:01] beginning
[52:04] hid it from the devil amen amen
[52:07] hit it through the ages
[52:09] but it's made known to us what god's
[52:11] real intent is with our lives
[52:14] according to the
[52:16] eternal purpose which he purposed in
[52:19] christ jesus our lord amen
[52:24] god had a season for our church here
[52:29] there was a time that this church was
[52:30] planted
[52:32] and there was the season to be here at
[52:34] 1542 north leroy street
[52:37] and it certainly didn't look like much
[52:39] from the world
[52:41] it was just
[52:44] another building
[52:49] but
[52:51] the church
[52:53] this room
[52:54] was dedicated to god
[52:58] nothing special outside when you
[53:01] dedicate something to god god takes it
[53:05] amen
[53:06] that's the beauty of dedicating your
[53:08] lives to god
[53:12] now a lot of times we've come into
[53:13] church with all types of spirits on us
[53:15] right
[53:16] all types of ideas all types of moods
[53:19] and all things
[53:23] and we we've all had a hard job keeping
[53:26] this place holy
[53:28] keeping it dedicated for god
[53:31] keeping him lifted up and first
[53:34] keeping ourselves last
[53:41] that their season is over
[53:46] god had a particular purpose for this
[53:48] church
[53:49] that was directly connected to his
[53:52] eternal purpose which he purposed in
[53:54] christ jesus our lord
[53:57] do you believe that
[53:59] there were a lot of people who came
[54:02] and were gone
[54:05] there are people who didn't want to go
[54:07] to hell
[54:09] there were people who just wanted to go
[54:10] to heaven
[54:13] but there was a lot more to it than that
[54:16] not very many people were interested in
[54:18] becoming in the image of god amen in the
[54:21] likeness of
[54:22] god they don't mind if they just
[54:26] you know repent get baptized put your
[54:28] name on the book say okay i believe the
[54:30] message
[54:31] that's right but that is not coming into
[54:33] the image of god that is not coming into
[54:35] the likeness of god that's you stating
[54:38] i'm gonna start and head in that
[54:40] direction
[54:45] there just weren't very many people were
[54:47] interested in becoming completely born
[54:49] again that's right it's not he that
[54:51] starts
[54:53] it's he that endure it to the end
[54:58] we got to keep moving forward
[55:02] i really enjoyed sister kathleen's
[55:04] testimony talking about
[55:06] our purpose
[55:07] talking about moving forward
[55:13] didn't seem like there were very many
[55:15] people who really wanted to act
[55:19] like jesus
[55:21] to love unconditionally like jesus
[55:25] to be perfect
[55:27] just
[55:28] as jesus told us to be perfect
[55:31] and love even our enemies just like his
[55:34] father loved his enemies
[55:37] to be patient and long-suffering and
[55:39] kind and merciful and delayed on our
[55:42] lives
[55:43] and to live for others amen
[55:47] but this is truly the eternal purpose
[55:50] that god had this church
[55:54] it doesn't fit everybody's purpose
[55:57] that's why they've come and they've gone
[56:02] but i'm so thankful for this bible
[56:05] it gives us an example of what we need
[56:07] to be
[56:08] amen the apostles
[56:11] and
[56:12] paul
[56:14] devoted his life
[56:16] to saving others
[56:18] think about that statement they devoted
[56:21] their life to get other family members
[56:24] in
[56:24] for god's eternal purpose to have a
[56:26] family
[56:29] it's awful quiet but i'll tell you
[56:32] to me this is what this whole thing's
[56:33] about amen
[56:35] i know we got other ideas we all we all
[56:37] want other things we want to we want to
[56:39] go other places and do other things but
[56:42] god is interested in his family
[56:47] there are souls out there that are not
[56:49] in
[56:52] god does not love me more than he loves
[56:54] them
[56:58] god wants them in as much as he wants me
[57:01] in amen
[57:05] now how is god going to get them in
[57:07] he's going to use us
[57:09] he's going to use us that are willing
[57:13] to get in the vein
[57:15] of god's eternal purpose
[57:19] to labor for him
[57:22] give up our time
[57:24] amen i'll say if your son
[57:28] was lost
[57:29] wouldn't you go get him amen
[57:33] reminds you of this story where the the
[57:35] whole
[57:36] this boy was lost in this village and
[57:39] the whole village went out looking for
[57:41] him because he was lost
[57:43] and they found him finally too much
[57:46] travail at night
[57:48] and they had a party they were rejoicing
[57:50] because he was okay
[57:54] but someone in that same village
[57:57] was lost going to hell and nobody seemed
[58:00] to care
[58:02] but our heavenly father he cares
[58:06] he cares amen because it's not about
[58:09] this life that he just cares about amen
[58:12] he said i'm not of this world amen amen
[58:16] it's about eternal life
[58:20] and it's hard to
[58:21] to get this across to people because
[58:24] everybody's involved in this life so
[58:26] much right so they think about it's not
[58:29] taught in the schools we need to look to
[58:31] god about eternal life we need to pray
[58:33] before we eat our food at lunchtime we
[58:35] need to give thanks to god for the day
[58:37] he's given us no let's take prayer out
[58:39] of the schools
[58:42] let's bring in evil
[58:46] the world's going down to two
[58:52] sounds like i am too
[58:58] devil didn't like that one
[59:10] it's hard to be a witness in this age
[59:11] for christ
[59:15] i want to give you some consolation
[59:17] jesus would not even allow his own
[59:20] apostles who he walked with
[59:22] the responsibility
[59:24] to go do it
[59:26] themselves
[59:28] he said you wait until i fill you with
[59:31] my spirit and then you shall be
[59:33] witnesses for me
[59:35] he won't entrust anybody to do it
[59:38] but himself amen inside of us
[59:44] not very many seem strongly interested
[59:47] in being in his image and being in his
[59:49] likeness
[59:51] but the purpose that god had ordained
[59:53] this church sunderland has always been
[59:58] to given to provide an opportunity
[1:00:02] for us
[1:00:04] to grow in christ
[1:00:06] to become one with him
[1:00:08] to become one with the word amen
[1:00:14] we can't do that until we find out where
[1:00:16] we're at with god right
[1:00:18] we can't come to church and just think
[1:00:20] oh i'm just completely fine with god
[1:00:22] just give me more information that is
[1:00:24] not how it works
[1:00:28] we should be interested in what happened
[1:00:30] the last week
[1:00:32] that's right yes
[1:00:34] god is interested not just
[1:00:37] just
[1:00:38] fixing the little bad things that we did
[1:00:40] last week
[1:00:42] how many prayed today lord forgive me
[1:00:44] for my thoughtfulness
[1:00:46] yeah god god just don't want that little
[1:00:49] bitty thing fixed i prayed that same
[1:00:50] prayer i'm with you you don't want just
[1:00:52] that little thing fixed he wants our
[1:00:54] life given to him amen
[1:00:56] he wants us to become one with him more
[1:00:58] than we've ever become amen not just
[1:01:00] saying i'm in the message
[1:01:03] but the message living in us and
[1:01:05] manifesting what god really sent malachi
[1:01:08] 4 5.
[1:01:12] to become in his image to become in his
[1:01:14] likeness
[1:01:19] amen
[1:01:21] this church
[1:01:22] has been providing us with an
[1:01:25] opportunity for over 20 years to become
[1:01:27] more and more in his image
[1:01:35] to think about some would make it when
[1:01:37] they just read one message
[1:01:41] to whom much is given
[1:01:43] much is required
[1:01:46] the hardest thing i believe
[1:01:49] is to hear the truth
[1:01:51] and not have a burning desire to live it
[1:01:53] that's true amen
[1:01:55] you go home and you live in misery
[1:01:59] because you refuse to lay down your life
[1:02:02] to love your enemy
[1:02:04] to reach out for souls
[1:02:06] so you just try to get by the best that
[1:02:08] you can and it is a miserable walk
[1:02:13] the prophet said you might as well just
[1:02:14] go back and live in the world if you're
[1:02:16] not going to give it all it's true amen
[1:02:18] that's right amen i'm just talking
[1:02:21] overall
[1:02:22] you got to come to grips with the
[1:02:24] situation that you're in
[1:02:26] take a stand drive a state downside i'm
[1:02:28] not going to listen to your devil amen
[1:02:30] yeah i've been listening your lives long
[1:02:31] enough i'm moving forward i'm gonna
[1:02:33] become one with christ i'm gonna i'm
[1:02:35] gonna really make a rapture
[1:02:39] and here's the thing
[1:02:40] who would want to make a rapture and not
[1:02:43] be in his likeness in his image
[1:02:44] beforehand i feel i'd be stealing the
[1:02:48] heaven i'll be stealing and be robbing
[1:02:50] god
[1:02:54] amen
[1:02:55] the bible says when he shall appear we
[1:02:57] shall be like him for we shall see him
[1:02:59] as he is amen i believe god has given us
[1:03:02] an opportunity to become more and more
[1:03:04] like jesus every time we come to church
[1:03:08] to take it seriously to take the word
[1:03:10] and say i don't know i'm going to do it
[1:03:12] lord but i want to live this word at
[1:03:14] home i want to do what you want me to do
[1:03:17] place yourself in the hands of god put
[1:03:20] your faith on the test that you can grow
[1:03:22] in christ that you can become more in
[1:03:24] his image
[1:03:25] don't let satan tell you all you got to
[1:03:27] do is this and all you got to do is that
[1:03:30] come on
[1:03:31] get by with just church attention get by
[1:03:33] with a little offering get by which is
[1:03:35] saying you believe the bible get by what
[1:03:37] you're saying i pray i pray no
[1:03:40] you've got to become in this image
[1:03:43] look in the mirror of his word
[1:03:45] amen that's what it's here for
[1:03:48] amen
[1:03:49] i mean sometimes our flesh wish we
[1:03:50] didn't hear the word
[1:03:54] now we become responsible responsible
[1:03:56] for it
[1:04:02] i like how brother branham said
[1:04:04] the character of the church
[1:04:07] he said the beauty of the church is the
[1:04:09] character of the people
[1:04:12] and
[1:04:13] i've always been okay
[1:04:16] with this place that looked like this
[1:04:22] to me
[1:04:23] if god wanted to be recognized what we
[1:04:26] learned as a barn
[1:04:29] a stable
[1:04:30] but we we know to be a little
[1:04:32] hole in the rocks
[1:04:39] god
[1:04:40] could be hid right here
[1:04:44] but he's here for a purpose that purpose
[1:04:46] is you amen for you
[1:04:49] to become him amen to become one with
[1:04:52] him not just to grow in knowledge
[1:04:56] amen because you grow in the
[1:04:58] manifestation of that knowledge amen
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:02] to say i'm like you jesus i'm a chip off
[1:05:05] the whole block put me through the test
[1:05:07] let me come through the fire let me love
[1:05:10] like you let me lay down my life let me
[1:05:12] give you myself let me give you my time
[1:05:14] amen
[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:17] not just an hour here and now we're
[1:05:19] there
[1:05:20] not saying oh that's the church i go to
[1:05:23] no
[1:05:24] this is the god i serve
[1:05:26] 24 7.
[1:05:28] it's in my life
[1:05:30] he's changed me
[1:05:31] from glory to glory
[1:05:37] we should all better look and see
[1:05:39] a growth happening in our lives a steady
[1:05:42] growth
[1:05:45] can you imagine if an oak tree just said
[1:05:47] you know i want to just
[1:05:49] stop growing for a couple years
[1:05:51] ain't gonna happen
[1:05:53] it's gonna
[1:05:55] come to out to the sun
[1:05:57] all right
[1:05:58] it's gonna drink in the rain
[1:06:01] because its roots are there and god is
[1:06:04] faithful amen
[1:06:08] we can't expect god just to always come
[1:06:11] to
[1:06:12] our little world
[1:06:14] right
[1:06:18] when god has provided a place to meet
[1:06:20] you amen
[1:06:24] it's our the bible says
[1:06:26] the bible does not say god will draw an
[1:06:29] eye to you and when he does you draw an
[1:06:30] eye to him
[1:06:33] bible says you get up go to church
[1:06:36] you draw an eye to god then he'll draw
[1:06:38] an eye to you
[1:06:40] now of course you do that in your home
[1:06:43] we should
[1:06:52] the part of his
[1:06:54] image and his likeness that we need to
[1:06:56] be is his character
[1:07:00] and brother branham said a christian
[1:07:03] life the real character of a christian
[1:07:08] he said it's a hard rugged life
[1:07:11] it's not an easy peasy
[1:07:14] you're full of the love of god
[1:07:17] right
[1:07:18] and it puts you out yonder winning souls
[1:07:22] for jesus christ amen
[1:07:25] because his
[1:07:26] eternal purpose
[1:07:28] that he had before adam was ever created
[1:07:32] was to have a family amen
[1:07:35] and we
[1:07:36] we were not
[1:07:38] born right after adam
[1:07:41] we were not born
[1:07:42] during
[1:07:43] jonah
[1:07:44] during noah
[1:07:47] during elijah right right
[1:07:50] during the times of jesus amen
[1:07:53] he saved us for the end amen
[1:07:58] and in the end
[1:08:01] we're to become more like him amen
[1:08:03] yes sir in this age we're to represent
[1:08:06] jesus christ more than any other age
[1:08:08] amen
[1:08:10] to whom much is given
[1:08:12] much is required
[1:08:14] if there's ever a time we need to press
[1:08:16] in
[1:08:17] to pray for our precious brothers and
[1:08:19] sisters that we sit next to
[1:08:22] amen that we worship with this is the
[1:08:24] hour
[1:08:25] we need one another
[1:08:28] because satan is stronger
[1:08:31] he's doing everything he can
[1:08:34] to stop god's eternal purpose
[1:08:37] that god ordained this church for a
[1:08:38] season to be used for his eternal
[1:08:40] purpose
[1:08:42] to make
[1:08:43] men see
[1:08:44] what god wants
[1:08:46] is a very
[1:08:48] special
[1:08:49] family
[1:08:50] relationship amen
[1:08:52] a fellowship that you can only have with
[1:08:55] a wife right
[1:08:59] and that fellowship
[1:09:00] can only go so far
[1:09:06] you know when your wife or your husband
[1:09:08] is being a little standoffish or a
[1:09:09] brother
[1:09:11] you just can't go up to them
[1:09:13] you don't feel like going up to them and
[1:09:15] just spilling out your whole heart
[1:09:17] is that true
[1:09:23] the bible says he hid himself from the
[1:09:25] wise and prudent right amen he reveals
[1:09:27] himself to babes yes
[1:09:31] the why is it prudent they're a little
[1:09:32] standoffish you know
[1:09:35] they got it all figured out they don't
[1:09:36] need you
[1:09:38] because they got it
[1:09:42] well sometimes it's really hard to say
[1:09:44] something to your your wife or your
[1:09:47] husband
[1:09:48] when they're being standoffish
[1:09:52] so until we become more and more in his
[1:09:55] likeness in his image
[1:09:57] we can't really have that fellowship
[1:09:59] that he wants to have with us we don't
[1:10:01] want to be satisfied with the blessing
[1:10:03] of god all right
[1:10:05] i found his presence
[1:10:07] came over me this happened in my life
[1:10:09] that
[1:10:10] no
[1:10:11] i want him with me all the time
[1:10:13] i want to feel him all the time i want
[1:10:15] to be led by his spirit all the time i
[1:10:17] want to know what he wants me to do and
[1:10:18] i want to do with all my heart amen
[1:10:22] i want that fellowship to be that close
[1:10:30] we've got to work on our adoption
[1:10:31] credentials
[1:10:34] we've got to press out of laodicea and
[1:10:36] press into god's kingdom
[1:10:38] we've got to press towards the mark amen
[1:10:41] verse 9 to make all men see what is the
[1:10:44] fellowship of the mystery which from the
[1:10:46] beginning of the world had been hid in
[1:10:48] god
[1:10:49] who created all things by jesus christ
[1:10:53] to the intent that noun to the
[1:10:55] principalities and powers in how many
[1:10:56] places might be made known by the church
[1:11:00] the manifold wisdom of god
[1:11:02] according to his eternal purpose which
[1:11:05] he purposed
[1:11:06] in jesus christ
[1:11:09] our lord
[1:11:11] now when you got time i'd like you to go
[1:11:12] ahead and read the rest of this
[1:11:15] because
[1:11:16] it talks
[1:11:18] about the family
[1:11:20] and how that we need to let's just read
[1:11:22] it i guess if we're going to be a little
[1:11:23] bit late tonight our last service we can
[1:11:25] do it right amen
[1:11:28] verse 14.
[1:11:30] well let's just keep read verse 12 in
[1:11:32] whom we have boldness and access with
[1:11:35] confidence by faith in him wherefore i
[1:11:38] desire that you faint not at my
[1:11:39] tribulations for you which is
[1:11:42] your glory in other words paul said i
[1:11:44] endure all things for the elect's sake
[1:11:46] don't feign over it don't worry about
[1:11:48] what i'm going through because i'm doing
[1:11:50] it for god's purpose
[1:11:52] he says for this cause i bow my knees
[1:11:54] unto the father of our lord jesus christ
[1:11:56] of whom the whole family
[1:11:58] in heaven and earth is named
[1:12:01] that he would grant you according to the
[1:12:03] riches of his glory to be strengthened
[1:12:05] with might by his spirit in the inner
[1:12:07] man
[1:12:08] now notice what he wants for his family
[1:12:10] that christ may dwell in your hearts by
[1:12:12] faith
[1:12:13] that you being rooted and grounded in
[1:12:16] love
[1:12:18] like if
[1:12:18] if the roots aren't love
[1:12:21] if you're not grounded in love it's just
[1:12:23] a matter before
[1:12:25] somebody's going to say something he's
[1:12:26] going to tip you over and you're going
[1:12:28] to get bothered all upset right right
[1:12:32] right
[1:12:34] but god wants us rooted and grounded in
[1:12:37] love
[1:12:39] may be able to comprehend
[1:12:42] with all the other believers
[1:12:44] that really believe the word
[1:12:47] what is the breath
[1:12:48] the length the depth and the height
[1:12:51] and to know the love of christ
[1:12:54] which passes knowledge
[1:12:57] that it that he might be filled with all
[1:13:00] the fullness of god
[1:13:04] when we know the love of christ it not
[1:13:06] only passes knowledge
[1:13:08] but it ushers in the fullness of god
[1:13:10] that's how important love is because god
[1:13:12] is love amen
[1:13:14] god wants a relationship it will be in
[1:13:16] love
[1:13:22] if satan could have got what he wanted
[1:13:24] in heaven
[1:13:26] he would have stayed there
[1:13:28] if god would allow
[1:13:30] him to be above him
[1:13:37] to let his
[1:13:38] selfish nature
[1:13:41] be the preeminence in the church there
[1:13:45] he would have stayed
[1:13:47] but number one god won't have it amen
[1:13:52] and god kicked him out
[1:13:56] amen
[1:13:58] my house shall be called a house of
[1:14:00] prayer
[1:14:01] it's god's house
[1:14:03] with god's family
[1:14:05] that is filled with his love
[1:14:07] so strong they can love their enemy yes
[1:14:12] they don't have to
[1:14:15] turn my no they turn the cheek and say
[1:14:18] they have a compassion inside i want you
[1:14:21] to know the god that i know
[1:14:26] amen to know that to be filled with the
[1:14:29] fullness of god amen now unto him that
[1:14:32] is able to do exceedingly above all that
[1:14:34] we ask or think according to the power
[1:14:36] the power that
[1:14:39] works
[1:14:40] in
[1:14:44] you
[1:14:46] should have an expectation of a power
[1:14:48] inside of you
[1:14:52] you want more power go to the source
[1:14:54] amen that's right
[1:14:57] i know if i want to plug the vacuum
[1:14:59] cleaner in
[1:15:00] i just can't put the the plug into
[1:15:03] stan's hand
[1:15:06] there's no power there i gotta i gotta
[1:15:08] put it in the receptacle and where the
[1:15:11] source of power is at right amen
[1:15:15] i don't care how much
[1:15:17] power brother my mark has
[1:15:19] but mike
[1:15:26] [Music]
[1:15:35] and i can't just say i'm in the message
[1:15:38] god i'm in the message many will come to
[1:15:39] me in that day say lord lord was i not
[1:15:41] in the message
[1:15:43] i've got to have the power in me
[1:15:46] the power to lay down my life
[1:15:49] the power to do his will right
[1:15:52] amen the power to exercise god's eternal
[1:15:55] purpose while i'm down here
[1:15:59] like it just breaks my heart i have
[1:16:01] children some serve the lord
[1:16:04] a few serve the lord a couple served the
[1:16:06] lord
[1:16:07] [Laughter]
[1:16:09] the majority do not
[1:16:12] as a as a parent it breaks my heart
[1:16:16] i would never want that if i had to do
[1:16:18] it all over i'd do the very same thing
[1:16:20] that i did try to be a better parent try
[1:16:22] it we'll try yeah
[1:16:24] but still in my bible studies i still
[1:16:26] pray with them you know i do my
[1:16:28] devotions
[1:16:31] but they themselves have to make their
[1:16:33] own decision
[1:16:35] amen
[1:16:38] but god has the same yearning
[1:16:41] in his heart for his lost children that
[1:16:43] we do for ours
[1:16:49] so we may not hear what we want to hear
[1:16:51] when we come to church but we're going
[1:16:53] to hear god's heart amen
[1:16:55] and it has to do with a relationship
[1:16:57] with him
[1:16:59] and for us doing his will about his
[1:17:01] eternal purpose
[1:17:02] now he taught us he taught us
[1:17:06] if we seek first the kingdom right
[1:17:09] and his righteousness
[1:17:11] then
[1:17:12] every thing else that we have on our
[1:17:16] bucket list
[1:17:18] shall be added
[1:17:20] amen do you believe that can you say
[1:17:22] amen to the word of god
[1:17:24] don't say amen to me say amen to the
[1:17:26] word of god
[1:17:28] we can't put the train before the engine
[1:17:31] right that's true
[1:17:32] we can't put the cart before the horses
[1:17:36] we can't put the engine in the trailer
[1:17:38] and no engine in the car right that's
[1:17:40] true we've got to put god first he wants
[1:17:43] to be first in the in the tithes and
[1:17:45] offerings
[1:17:46] he wants to be first in your life
[1:17:50] i'm not calling for money i'm just
[1:17:52] saying i'm trying to give a type that
[1:17:53] god wants to be first in everything amen
[1:17:57] you know
[1:17:59] this church would be so packed out if we
[1:18:01] did not preach that
[1:18:08] only thing you have to do is this just
[1:18:10] just just love god the best you can
[1:18:14] god knows god understands
[1:18:17] don't you worry you don't have to become
[1:18:19] everything like him just believe
[1:18:22] some kind of mixed up message
[1:18:25] that you really never get a good
[1:18:27] description who god is
[1:18:31] but if he wants us to become one with
[1:18:33] him then we got to know him
[1:18:35] right amen we got to know who he really
[1:18:37] is
[1:18:40] in order to become one with them
[1:18:43] that's why we we
[1:18:46] yes our flesh isn't yearning to die out
[1:18:48] our flesh is not yearning to be like
[1:18:50] jesus i understand that
[1:18:53] but the inner man
[1:18:56] that's the one this church is for
[1:18:58] it's for our souls
[1:19:01] that we can grow in christ
[1:19:03] we have a season god has given us a
[1:19:06] season here
[1:19:13] when you get time read philippians
[1:19:14] chapter 3 verse 10
[1:19:16] through 18
[1:19:19] to
[1:19:19] to press towards that mark
[1:19:22] that christ has given us
[1:19:24] i want you to know see all these these
[1:19:26] notes here
[1:19:41] our season
[1:19:42] here is over
[1:19:51] we've probably scrambled scramble
[1:19:54] scrabbled
[1:19:56] you all know what i'm trying to say
[1:19:59] [Music]
[1:20:00] scrabbled that's right we've all
[1:20:03] probably didn't put
[1:20:05] our heart
[1:20:07] into being here
[1:20:10] some of us sometimes just barely made it
[1:20:12] in
[1:20:15] and this god knows we're human
[1:20:19] god knows we're frail
[1:20:21] but god will not accept an attitude
[1:20:27] and all god has to do is say son
[1:20:30] daughter
[1:20:32] told me this is what i expect out of you
[1:20:35] right
[1:20:36] if a righteous man falls seven times he
[1:20:38] waits for god to come by and pick him up
[1:20:41] no that's not scripture
[1:20:47] the effectual power that's working in
[1:20:49] you
[1:20:51] amen amen something inside just stirs up
[1:20:55] right it says i'm a son of god i'm a
[1:20:57] daughter of god
[1:20:59] i'm not laying down here with the
[1:21:00] chickens today i'm going to come into
[1:21:02] church with faith amen i'm going to be a
[1:21:05] believer i'm going to believe god's word
[1:21:07] has never failed amen i'm not looking at
[1:21:09] john martin who's failed so many times i
[1:21:11] can't count it
[1:21:14] hey man it's okay to say amen i i know
[1:21:17] i'm a failure i'm okay with that you are
[1:21:20] too so what does it matter you're
[1:21:21] amongst failures
[1:21:26] we don't even think like
[1:21:28] some sort of graph
[1:21:30] right
[1:21:32] well since you don't have as many
[1:21:40] most
[1:21:41] turned down the opportunity that god
[1:21:43] provided
[1:21:46] but some stayed
[1:21:48] some grew
[1:21:50] the last 20 years more in the image of
[1:21:51] god
[1:21:53] some took advantage of the time to build
[1:21:55] a relationship with god
[1:21:58] while others stayed home
[1:22:01] viewed it a waste of time to go to
[1:22:03] service
[1:22:05] some wanted a place just for fellowship
[1:22:10] but some hungered for a place of worship
[1:22:12] amen
[1:22:14] some just wanted a place to hear what
[1:22:16] they wanted to hear
[1:22:19] but some thirsted for a place to hear
[1:22:20] from god
[1:22:23] our season here is over
[1:22:26] god has fulfilled his purpose you could
[1:22:28] sit back and say god has fulfilled his
[1:22:32] purpose
[1:22:33] because god can't lie
[1:22:35] right
[1:22:36] isaiah chapter 55 verse 8
[1:22:39] says for my thoughts
[1:22:42] are not your thoughts
[1:22:43] neither are your ways my ways saith the
[1:22:45] lord
[1:22:47] for as the heavens are higher than the
[1:22:48] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:22:50] ways and my thoughts and your thoughts
[1:22:53] for as the rain cometh down and the snow
[1:22:56] from heaven and return
[1:22:58] not neither but water the earth and make
[1:23:02] it that bring forth bud
[1:23:04] that it may give seed to the sower and
[1:23:06] bread to the eater in other words there
[1:23:08] is a very long purpose
[1:23:13] i was talking to my wife yesterday as we
[1:23:15] pulled in the driveway from a long trip
[1:23:18] to
[1:23:20] witness and celebrate this wedding that
[1:23:22] we went to
[1:23:24] and as i was pulling in
[1:23:25] i was saying
[1:23:26] think
[1:23:28] many years ago
[1:23:29] when we lived in brighton
[1:23:35] that god knew
[1:23:38] that we were going
[1:23:39] that there was going to be a church
[1:23:42] right on centerville
[1:23:45] that there was going to be a trusted two
[1:23:47] there was going to be a church here
[1:23:49] right
[1:23:49] right true
[1:23:53] she began to to share that she was so
[1:23:57] content
[1:23:58] living in
[1:23:59] in fentanyl or in brighton so content
[1:24:03] but something started stirring in her
[1:24:09] and it it became so strong that she just
[1:24:12] said lord i'm content staying here but
[1:24:14] if your will is something different your
[1:24:16] will be done
[1:24:19] god spoke to her and said that we should
[1:24:22] move from the
[1:24:23] move from the city to the country
[1:24:26] and i said i want you to think about
[1:24:28] that time that god spoke that to you god
[1:24:31] knew in his mind what would be happening
[1:24:33] today
[1:24:36] amen
[1:24:38] god has a purpose for every one of us
[1:24:40] god wants to use us in his kingdom god
[1:24:43] wants to use us to get the rest of the
[1:24:45] family in
[1:24:47] that's what it's about it's not about
[1:24:49] what we want it to be
[1:24:53] not about what our flesh wants it to be
[1:24:56] it's about his eternal purpose
[1:25:01] he's the one
[1:25:03] whose thoughts are higher and has
[1:25:05] something greater for us than our
[1:25:06] thoughts so when you get thoughts we
[1:25:08] always want to say well you got the mind
[1:25:10] of christ
[1:25:12] say lord
[1:25:15] help me lord i just want to be sure
[1:25:18] stay neutral to just
[1:25:20] the the over when you know you just want
[1:25:23] to lay down your life for a soul you
[1:25:27] know you're on the right track
[1:25:29] if that's your real motive
[1:25:31] you know you're on the right track
[1:25:34] verse 11 so shall my word be that go
[1:25:36] forth out of my mouth it shall not
[1:25:38] return unto me void
[1:25:43] but it shall accomplish that which i
[1:25:45] please and it shall prosper in a thing
[1:25:47] wherein two i sent it amen
[1:25:51] god has fulfilled his purpose in our
[1:25:53] season here
[1:25:57] our lives have prospered
[1:26:00] our spiritual lives have prospered in
[1:26:02] this season can you say amen
[1:26:05] god's word has not returned unto him
[1:26:08] void
[1:26:09] it has accomplished what pleased him
[1:26:13] and it has prospered in this place where
[1:26:16] unto his senate
[1:26:19] do you believe that
[1:26:20] i believe with all my heart
[1:26:26] when ten lepers
[1:26:28] pleaded for mercy
[1:26:32] jesus
[1:26:33] willingly healed all ten of them
[1:26:36] but only one of them turned back
[1:26:38] and glorified god
[1:26:40] with a loud voice
[1:26:43] the bible says that he fell down on his
[1:26:45] face at the feet of jesus and gave him
[1:26:49] but jesus's tension
[1:26:52] was not drawn to him
[1:26:54] jesus's tension was drawn to the nine
[1:26:57] that were not there
[1:27:01] because something was missing
[1:27:09] god wanted praise from all ten right
[1:27:13] amen
[1:27:14] and i'll tell you if nine of them would
[1:27:16] have came to praise him his attention
[1:27:18] would be drawn to that one
[1:27:20] amen
[1:27:22] i'll say today we have an opportunity to
[1:27:24] praise god for what he has done for us
[1:27:27] in this place
[1:27:31] don't let god's attention be drawn to
[1:27:33] you because you won't stand and testify
[1:27:35] for him right right
[1:27:37] right
[1:27:38] he's worthy
[1:27:41] he's worthy
[1:27:43] i believe that one was so thankful
[1:27:46] that he was willing
[1:27:48] to crucify his flesh
[1:27:50] whatever it took and express something
[1:27:53] that was so strong inside of him
[1:27:57] the other nine might have just had too
[1:28:00] much pride i got things going you know i
[1:28:03] got a business i married a wife i bought
[1:28:05] some oxen
[1:28:15] jesus
[1:28:16] did something for that man that he
[1:28:18] didn't do for the other nine
[1:28:22] that's right
[1:28:26] i don't think he was just made whole
[1:28:28] naturally right right amen
[1:28:33] god
[1:28:34] is a god that reciprocates
[1:28:37] in a relationship
[1:28:44] sometimes
[1:28:45] our battery just goes out we stop
[1:28:47] reciprocating
[1:28:50] god's waiting for us to make the first
[1:28:51] move draw nigh to god he'll draw an eye
[1:28:53] to you
[1:28:54] let's give thanks for the season that
[1:28:56] god has given us
[1:28:58] amen let's stand together
[1:29:08] there are a lot of things that we could
[1:29:09] testify of
[1:29:13] but we've dedicated just a little bit of
[1:29:15] time to just thank him for what he's
[1:29:17] done for us in this place
[1:29:19] because this place was dedicated to him
[1:29:24] and i'm thankful that he's given us a
[1:29:26] place

[1:29:46] thanksgiving
[1:29:48] lord we want to
[1:29:51] express to you
[1:29:53] a life
[1:29:55] of thankfulness

[1:30:32] mourn your likeness
[1:30:34] lord i pray that you'd help each one of
[1:30:36] us
[1:30:37] to dedicate herself to that purpose that
[1:30:40] eternal purpose

[1:35:19] but god almighty brought me up that's
[1:35:22] right
[1:35:22] praise the lord
[1:35:31] yes um
[1:35:32] we came
[1:35:33] to this church in 2005.
[1:35:37] um we had had a
[1:35:38] some of you know we had a tragic
[1:35:40] accident in our family
[1:35:42] um lost a eight-year-old daughter in a
[1:35:44] car accident and
[1:35:45] at that time i was just
[1:35:48] searching i went to baptist churches i
[1:35:50] went to catholic churches we were going
[1:35:52] to methodist churches
[1:35:53] and when it happened it was just our
[1:35:56] lives were just flipped upside down and
[1:35:58] i was just i didn't know what to do
[1:35:59] except i didn't know the lord
[1:36:01] um i did a little bit of
[1:36:04] when i was um
[1:36:06] i went to a baptist church when i was a
[1:36:07] child really young
[1:36:09] i remember sunday school and i remember
[1:36:12] jesus a little bit but i really never
[1:36:15] um
[1:36:16] i don't know we just we searched we came
[1:36:18] here
[1:36:19] and when we walked out of the first
[1:36:21] service here
[1:36:23] and we remember it like it was yesterday
[1:36:24] she looked right at me and she said well
[1:36:26] what'd you think and i was like well
[1:36:28] it was it was different
[1:36:30] it was it was different because
[1:36:33] the love that you guys had for the lord
[1:36:35] was just something that i never
[1:36:36] experienced i never went into a church
[1:36:39] where
[1:36:39] they were free to worship
[1:36:42] um it was different it was just totally
[1:36:44] different and i felt the presence of the
[1:36:46] lord
[1:36:47] and i told her that immediately
[1:36:49] immediately after all the churches we
[1:36:51] searched i told her the very first time
[1:36:53] we walked up this is home this is it
[1:36:56] i feel the lord i know he's there
[1:36:58] and i just
[1:37:00] i just felt the wholeness and it was
[1:37:02] and then ever since then it's this has
[1:37:04] been our
[1:37:05] our home
[1:37:06] our family amen and uh we just love
[1:37:09] ollie and just the lord is here
[1:37:11] he has done miracle things i mean it's
[1:37:13] just
[1:37:29] we came
[1:37:31] to this church i don't know how many
[1:37:33] years ago now it was
[1:37:35] it was before
[1:37:37] 2003 so i i don't remember what year we
[1:37:40] came
[1:37:42] but
[1:37:43] my son dennis finally found this church
[1:37:47] for us
[1:37:48] we have been searching we have been
[1:37:50] going to churches
[1:37:53] i had been baptized so every church i
[1:37:57] went
[1:38:01] and then
[1:38:03] they told me
[1:38:05] when you still have to get baptized
[1:38:07] again because you were never baptized in
[1:38:09] jesus name
[1:38:12] so anyways i got baptized again after
[1:38:19] but we searched in search until we
[1:38:21] thought you know
[1:38:23] this church is not right this was not
[1:38:25] right you know we just went back and
[1:38:27] forth
[1:38:28] and
[1:38:29] we found this and
[1:38:31] this church was more like a
[1:38:34] church home
[1:38:35] it was a family
[1:38:38] atmosphere and
[1:38:40] we we just enjoyed it and
[1:38:44] my um
[1:38:46] husband got sick
[1:38:49] in
[1:38:52] 2003 the ending of 2003
[1:38:57] and um
[1:38:59] brother john baptized my husband
[1:39:01] he had never been baptized
[1:39:04] i don't know if he had but not in jesus
[1:39:07] name i know we were sprinkled once
[1:39:10] in the methodist church so we didn't
[1:39:14] know you know we didn't know
[1:39:17] that
[1:39:18] nobody preached to us that we had to be
[1:39:20] baptized in jesus name you know
[1:39:24] so we did
[1:39:25] so um my husband um
[1:39:28] came one time
[1:39:30] he was too ill to uh come you know
[1:39:33] continue
[1:39:35] and but he he got baptized before he
[1:39:38] passed out amen
[1:39:40] praise the lord
[1:39:42] and
[1:39:43] a lot of people have come and gone since
[1:39:47] i've been here
[1:39:49] but
[1:39:50] i was determined i was going to stay
[1:39:53] amen i didn't want to go nowhere else
[1:39:58] i felt i was at the right place amen
[1:40:00] praise the lord
[1:40:08] oh well i just want you know there's a
[1:40:10] commonerity
[1:40:12] if you listen to everybody's message
[1:40:15] or testimony right
[1:40:17] and it's the same with mine
[1:40:19] but it comes from the word of god
[1:40:22] and that says
[1:40:24] you'll find me when you search with you
[1:40:26] with all your heart
[1:40:28] so
[1:40:29] the commonality is is
[1:40:31] people knew that wherever they were
[1:40:33] wasn't right and it was the same with me
[1:40:36] but
[1:40:37] when
[1:40:40] god is faithful to his word so when
[1:40:42] you're searching for god
[1:40:44] faithfully
[1:40:46] with all your heart he'll put you where
[1:40:48] you need to be
[1:40:49] and this is
[1:40:50] where
[1:40:53] he led us
[1:40:55] and
[1:40:56] like brother roger said you know uh it's
[1:40:59] pretty when you're searching and you
[1:41:01] find it
[1:41:02] there's
[1:41:03] you know your search is over yes
[1:41:06] so
[1:41:07] um all i can say is that
[1:41:11] for 20 some years however long it's been
[1:41:13] here you know the church is over
[1:41:18] now it's just a matter of applying the
[1:41:20] word
[1:41:21] and the spirit of the word amen
[1:41:24] amen
[1:41:25] amen praise the lord praise the lord
[1:41:32] i believe brother ron and sister trina
[1:41:34] were the
[1:41:36] one of the first three that we baptized
[1:41:39] i remember there were three people were
[1:41:40] baptized at the beginning and praise god
[1:41:42] for his faithfulness amen
[1:41:46] sister trina go ahead
[1:41:50] oh oh i'm sorry brother larry i i said i
[1:41:53] wouldn't let sister trina go first
[1:41:55] you'll go next i promise
[1:42:00] i could have many things to say but i'm
[1:42:02] just going to be a proxy for jim
[1:42:05] um i have a message from jim for a
[1:42:07] testimony jim kurtz kurzweil christ sir
[1:42:11] okay i spoke with him yesterday
[1:42:15] and so i'm checking on him seeing how
[1:42:18] he's doing so he gave a message and it's

[1:43:52] [Music]

[1:44:08] breathed pretty bad i was in the
[1:44:10] homeless
[1:44:11] situation and just down on my run
[1:44:14] or when i surrendered

[1:44:35] in your life and uh

[1:49:10] the whole
[1:49:11] church
[1:49:14] and printed out my hand

[1:50:21] back praise the lord amen praise the
[1:50:24] lord amen amen what we're doing is we
[1:50:26] are hearing from the light we are
[1:50:28] hearing about the keeping power of the
[1:50:30] holy ghost yes
[1:50:32] amen
[1:50:33] i just feel obligated to keep john over
[1:50:35] an hour so
[1:50:51] got involved in government
[1:50:53] some bad people
[1:50:55] in the world today
[1:50:56] real bad
[1:51:00] you know
[1:51:02] john has
[1:51:03] been christ to me and kind of like a dad
[1:51:06] to me whether he's realized it or not
[1:51:08] but
[1:51:09] i've always felt
[1:51:13] that
[1:51:14] the love of god
[1:51:16] has a domino effect you feel obligated
[1:51:20] and i feel part of me feels like i owe
[1:51:23] my life
[1:51:24] to the lord in john
[1:51:27] and to the martin family i feel like i
[1:51:29] can go to their house
[1:51:31] and get in the fridge and
[1:51:33] [Laughter]
[1:51:40] um
[1:51:44] [Laughter]
[1:51:49] but the love of god is really the it's
[1:51:52] the love of god that does does it
[1:51:55] in spite of whatever
[1:51:57] you know
[1:51:59] thing that
[1:52:00] failure or whatever you know whatever it
[1:52:02] is that people battle with temper or
[1:52:03] whatever
[1:52:05] that it is
[1:52:06] it's the love of god
[1:52:08] that
[1:52:09] surpasses the whole thing amen
[1:52:17] and when you don't have it growing up
[1:52:19] it just really makes you real clingy so
[1:52:21] you wanna
[1:52:22] you wanna you wanna maintain it amen
[1:52:26] when it's real
[1:52:28] to you you just feel indebted to god
[1:52:32] and to the people that led you
[1:52:34] to the lord amen there will be people
[1:52:37] that
[1:52:38] see or on the other side that i think
[1:52:41] they'll have a sense of indebtedness to
[1:52:43] us for
[1:52:44] not giving up on them
[1:52:46] amen
[1:52:47] underestimate the privilege of it
[1:52:50] you know the privilege that we have to
[1:52:52] be able to share the gospel
[1:52:53] with people and then the reward of
[1:52:56] having them spend eternity with us
[1:53:00] just something to say this no matter
[1:53:01] what satan says to you whoever you've
[1:53:03] been testifying to whoever you've been
[1:53:05] witnessing to whatever you've been doing
[1:53:06] for the lord
[1:53:08] it's not in vain amen
[1:53:10] satan is just angry
[1:53:12] he knows he has an end
[1:53:14] he's coming soon
[1:53:15] so he's fighting really hard against our
[1:53:17] loved ones and people
[1:53:19] but he's he's he's already defeated he's
[1:53:22] not going to win anything he doesn't
[1:53:23] even understand that so don't give up on
[1:53:25] who you're talking to
[1:53:27] who you're witnessing to
[1:53:29] it means something it means it
[1:53:30] absolutely means something amen praise
[1:53:33] the lord thank you brother
[1:53:38] thinking about what brother branham
[1:53:39] shared when he went came back from the
[1:53:41] curtain of time he's exp he's expressing
[1:53:45] just a few things
[1:53:47] and one of those things was they kept
[1:53:51] saying to him we wouldn't be here if it
[1:53:53] had not been for you
[1:53:56] and i think that's what brother mike was
[1:53:57] sharing
[1:53:58] amen you know
[1:54:00] how
[1:54:01] we're going to be just so full of
[1:54:03] thanksgiving over there
[1:54:05] for those who played a part in bringing
[1:54:07] us
[1:54:09] to heaven amen amen wonderful it was a
[1:54:12] family amen right
[1:54:14] it's a spiritual family giving birth
[1:54:17] amen
[1:54:19] well
[1:54:22] brother marty god bless you
[1:54:27] i just want to come to the front so i
[1:54:28] don't have to turn your heads
[1:54:30] um
[1:54:32] you know the
[1:54:34] church you are the church this is the
[1:54:36] church all of you my precious brothers
[1:54:39] and sisters and i really appreciate all
[1:54:41] of you
[1:54:42] and uh amen kathy and i are a couple of
[1:54:45] the old-timers here
[1:54:47] uh
[1:54:48] not quite the original but we came right
[1:54:50] after we have a lot of years here
[1:54:52] wonderful years and
[1:54:54] it's the best
[1:54:55] thing that's ever happened to us
[1:54:56] honestly and the prayers from all of you
[1:54:59] is just so wonderful it's kept us going
[1:55:01] and we have a revelation of who our
[1:55:03] pastor is i know you do that's brother
[1:55:05] john
[1:55:06] and when you get that it's a precious
[1:55:08] thing that's right and he deserves all
[1:55:10] of our prayers and all of our support
[1:55:14] in every aspect
[1:55:16] monetarily spiritually the whole the
[1:55:18] whole nine yards and we're so fortunate
[1:55:21] that we're going to be going to another
[1:55:22] church but you know we've got a big
[1:55:24] battle ahead of us spiritually it's very
[1:55:27] fun
[1:55:27] and i can't think of any a better group
[1:55:29] to go through the battle within this
[1:55:31] group
[1:55:32] i appreciate that i just do want to
[1:55:34] quickly tell a quick it's a typical
[1:55:36] brother john's story
[1:55:39] when i'm done with it you'll understand
[1:55:40] but
[1:55:41] about 20 years ago we were looking for a
[1:55:43] church and we weren't sure what to do
[1:55:45] and our uh many of you know my nephew
[1:55:48] jordan jordan romberger he had spent
[1:55:50] some time in
[1:55:51] arizona and he knew
[1:55:53] uh he had met at a meeting there of
[1:55:56] abigail their oldest daughter
[1:55:58] and uh
[1:55:59] and he's he found out about the church
[1:56:01] here and he said hey can you consider
[1:56:03] going to the church in fenton and he
[1:56:04] said we never even knew about it
[1:56:06] so he gave us the number kathleen called
[1:56:09] abigail and she was so sweet she was
[1:56:12] just a wonderful and i just
[1:56:14] it it just convinced us man we got to go
[1:56:17] to that church we got at least try it
[1:56:19] because she was just so wonderful so if
[1:56:21] you ever think about how you treat
[1:56:23] people
[1:56:24] it's so important to keep positive
[1:56:30] and so
[1:56:31] we started coming here we we
[1:56:33] enjoyed it we came here a couple times
[1:56:36] and uh
[1:56:37] hadn't quite made our mind up and then
[1:56:39] one sunday brother john just blurts out
[1:56:42] that he says well i just want to i'm so
[1:56:44] glad that marty and kathleen are here
[1:56:46] i'm so glad that they're joining our
[1:56:48] church
[1:56:51] and i looked at her i said did you tell
[1:56:53] him that
[1:56:54] she said no
[1:56:55] she said did you tell her that i said no
[1:57:00] so we both figured that it was probably
[1:57:02] god that told him
[1:57:04] all the time but that's a difficult
[1:57:07] [Laughter]
[1:57:08] [Music]
[1:57:10] yeah one more thing i don't take a lot
[1:57:12] of time here i'm kind of a numbers geek
[1:57:14] as you know i'm kind of a geek so but i
[1:57:16] kind of calculated very quickly
[1:57:19] how many uh
[1:57:21] sermons that this man has
[1:57:23] produced and prepared for over the 20
[1:57:25] years as well over 2000 of them and when
[1:57:29] you think about 2000
[1:57:31] over 2 000 sermons each one
[1:57:34] with many many hours of preparation and
[1:57:38] all this time he's got his big family
[1:57:39] he's got a job right right he's got all
[1:57:42] these things going on and he's committed
[1:57:44] all those
[1:57:45] countless hours
[1:57:46] it's just mind-boggling and so i wanted
[1:57:49] to
[1:57:50] and all we have in this life really is a
[1:57:52] certain amount of time he has given that
[1:57:54] time
[1:57:55] to us
[1:57:56] because he married us spiritually and so
[1:57:58] i wanted to thank him personally
[1:58:00] for that great sacrifice over all these
[1:58:03] years
[1:58:04] but also
[1:58:05] the great sacrifice that his wife yes
[1:58:08] that's right he had to share him with us
[1:58:11] and he might have not been there a few
[1:58:13] times when he needed to be
[1:58:15] but uh they gave that unto the lord and
[1:58:17] also for uh sister anne and her uh
[1:58:20] siblings the whole martin family for the
[1:58:23] sacrifice they made for all of us
[1:58:25] amen thank you i'm really looking
[1:58:27] forward to getting there yeah and just
[1:58:30] going on and i expect more and more
[1:58:32] things from the lord amen and our most
[1:58:34] with the
[1:58:36] rough waters that are ahead so thank you
[1:58:38] guys
[1:58:46] hey i really wish that brother marty
[1:58:49] would just preach
[1:58:52] i'd love to just sit down he just
[1:58:54] handled it
[1:58:56] he's just like our church would be full
[1:59:00] he just he is so
[1:59:02] so good
[1:59:04] we're un
[1:59:05] worthy to have
[1:59:07] not only him but honestly we feel
[1:59:10] every one of you
[1:59:12] that's how we feel
[1:59:14] i one thing i want to say amen to
[1:59:17] is this woman is sacrificed
[1:59:21] ready the life that she intended to have
[1:59:24] with me
[1:59:31] so
[1:59:32] i did my best to become multi-talented
[1:59:39] but i praise the lord for her sacrifice
[1:59:42] amen amen
[1:59:44] any any other yes sister laurie did i
[1:59:47] just say that
[1:59:49] um i do believe the word is here i may
[1:59:51] not be the best example but
[1:59:54] i will tell you
[1:59:56] that the word is here and if you stay
[1:59:59] and you dig in
[2:00:01] like stuff i need to dig in more but
[2:00:04] it is here amen
[2:00:06] i thank
[2:00:07] god for john crossing my path years ago
[2:00:11] so i don't know where i would have been
[2:00:14] you know what god is great
[2:00:16] he's merciful and yes i know
[2:00:21] just believe in what brother john is
[2:00:24] telling us and if he didn't the name
[2:00:27] will come in the rapture i don't touch
[2:00:29] you
[2:00:30] so i thank god for his grace and mercy
[2:00:33] thank you jesus
[2:00:40] my sister kelly
[2:00:42] i have so many things to give
[2:00:45] and praise the lord about
[2:00:47] so in 88 a week after i graduated from
[2:00:50] high school
[2:00:51] my mom all of a sudden had a heart
[2:00:53] attack and passed away
[2:00:55] my mom and i were the best of friends i
[2:00:58] mean
[2:00:59] i couldn't even
[2:01:01] ask for a better mom
[2:01:03] so
[2:01:04] as i started getting older and i had to
[2:01:07] realize i had to face life on my own
[2:01:10] i didn't even know how i was going to
[2:01:12] wake up each every and every day without
[2:01:15] her i didn't know the decisions to make
[2:01:17] the steps to me i didn't know anything
[2:01:20] so i was going down
[2:01:24] a spiral
[2:01:25] because i felt that the lord did not
[2:01:27] love me
[2:01:28] and
[2:01:29] i felt that he turned his back on me
[2:01:32] so it was extremely hard for me to give
[2:01:35] my
[2:01:36] life to the lord and to even love him
[2:01:39] because he took something so precious
[2:01:41] the only thing that i had away from me
[2:01:44] so
[2:01:47] along the way
[2:01:51] when i had a dream she died
[2:01:53] she had a tear and the tear
[2:01:56] shed over me
[2:01:57] and i knew
[2:01:59] that what she was saying was that
[2:02:02] she was there to protect me the whole
[2:02:05] entire way
[2:02:07] so
[2:02:08] i said okay
[2:02:10] i wanted to keep trying because i'm a
[2:02:12] fighter that's just who i've always been
[2:02:14] a survivor and a fighter
[2:02:16] so
[2:02:18] there were so many times i didn't want
[2:02:20] to live i just wanted to go because
[2:02:22] there was nothing to live in
[2:02:26] then
[2:02:28] the lord kept bringing angels to my
[2:02:30] different people people i didn't even
[2:02:32] know
[2:02:34] and they confirmed to me
[2:02:36] what my mom would say so i knew that my
[2:02:39] mom was always there with me
[2:02:41] well i moved to florida
[2:02:44] thinking that
[2:02:46] i was going to have a better life and
[2:02:48] everything was going to be wonderful and
[2:02:50] it was for a moment i had a time of my
[2:02:53] life
[2:02:54] but that was not where the lord wanted
[2:02:56] me to be
[2:02:58] he allowed me to get sick
[2:03:00] and i died on the table
[2:03:03] and the spirit came and told me
[2:03:06] that i was going to say three people
[2:03:08] that i was going to be a strong
[2:03:10] influence in three
[2:03:12] people's lives and i didn't know who it
[2:03:15] was
[2:03:17] he was one of them
[2:03:20] amen
[2:03:22] and
[2:03:23] i sacrificed so much
[2:03:25] of my spirit and
[2:03:27] soul
[2:03:29] and i'm so proud of him amen and he
[2:03:32] dedicated himself to the lord so i know
[2:03:35] that god put me in the right position
[2:03:38] if not just for me
[2:03:40] but other people
[2:03:42] and i know that i have been such a
[2:03:44] blessing to other people as much
[2:03:47] as patricia has been to me
[2:03:50] as much as sister kathleen has prayed
[2:03:52] over and over and over day after day
[2:03:57] after day
[2:03:58] for my son
[2:04:00] and i don't ever want you to feel that
[2:04:03] that
[2:04:05] does not
[2:04:07] miss me
[2:04:08] or
[2:04:09] i don't recognize that every day right
[2:04:12] amen trina
[2:04:15] we are kindred spirits honey and
[2:04:20] you know i love you and i love
[2:04:22] everything
[2:04:23] that you've done for me
[2:04:25] and for me to protect me
[2:04:28] right
[2:04:28] and
[2:04:30] um
[2:04:31] sister laurie
[2:04:34] laurie
[2:04:36] walking this journey with you
[2:04:38] has made me feel more grounded because
[2:04:41] there are so many times where i feel
[2:04:44] like sometimes i don't belong here
[2:04:46] and i'm the outsider here because maybe
[2:04:49] my faith is not as great as everyone
[2:04:52] else's but i do have faith i have my in
[2:04:56] my own faith
[2:04:57] and my faith
[2:05:00] is
[2:05:00] maybe not what you would call similar to
[2:05:03] yours
[2:05:04] but it's strong to me in the lord
[2:05:08] my son sterling
[2:05:11] has been
[2:05:12] a trial for me
[2:05:14] since the day he was born okay
[2:05:18] and mama can contest to that right
[2:05:20] i have worked so hard for this child
[2:05:23] this is my number two
[2:05:26] individual and
[2:05:28] i have worked so hard
[2:05:30] so hard so hard breathlessly
[2:05:33] the one thing that you have to
[2:05:35] understand i had to understand when
[2:05:38] you're dealing with men with boys and
[2:05:41] with children is that you have to stand
[2:05:43] firm that they don't take control over
[2:05:46] you
[2:05:46] you take control over them and that's
[2:05:49] one of the things that i had to learn
[2:05:52] growing up raising
[2:05:54] my son and i can tell you now even
[2:05:56] though
[2:05:57] he has not come to church
[2:05:59] does not mean that he does not love you
[2:06:01] any less okay
[2:06:03] he is going to school to become a
[2:06:05] computer uh informations
[2:06:08] person
[2:06:09] and he and he
[2:06:11] tutors japanese
[2:06:13] for students
[2:06:14] and i'm so proud of
[2:06:17] where we've come because we've come a
[2:06:19] long way
[2:06:20] and
[2:06:22] finally
[2:06:23] my husband
[2:06:25] you know there have been two
[2:06:27] big important people that has been in my
[2:06:30] life that's
[2:06:31] and that they have put me through hell
[2:06:34] and back
[2:06:35] and that's my husband
[2:06:37] and that is my dad
[2:06:39] and those are the two greatest men that
[2:06:41] i love with all my heart and i knew that
[2:06:45] the lord put me in their lives
[2:06:47] for a reason
[2:06:48] and i when my daddy died
[2:06:51] he started going to church
[2:06:53] and i was so thankful because we never
[2:06:56] went to church ever
[2:06:57] okay ever
[2:06:59] so that was important to me
[2:07:01] and you know and my husband
[2:07:04] his
[2:07:05] his spirit is
[2:07:07] getting um more sensitive about it i
[2:07:10] know we have some
[2:07:12] some things that we have to kind of you
[2:07:14] know swim through and i i know that god
[2:07:17] is going to um
[2:07:19] see us through
[2:07:21] but uh
[2:07:22] he blessed me with the house i'm still
[2:07:24] here living right
[2:07:26] man i i didn't have to be here you know
[2:07:29] what i mean i didn't even want to be
[2:07:30] here right
[2:07:32] and um
[2:07:34] the final thing is
[2:07:36] is that i love my pastor and i love his
[2:07:38] wife
[2:07:41] i know cheryl probably thinks
[2:07:44] that i don't love her
[2:07:47] but i do amen
[2:07:48] okay
[2:07:50] and i just want to thank everybody
[2:07:52] and i just wanted to tell everybody how
[2:07:54] much i love them and this lady here yes
[2:07:59] she is the reason that has kept me going
[2:08:02] amen
[2:08:03] i mean outside of course the lord
[2:08:06] because we do speak of the lord and she
[2:08:09] she keeps me
[2:08:11] she
[2:08:12] was the
[2:08:13] person that
[2:08:15] came in place of my mom
[2:08:17] so
[2:08:19] i don't know what i would do without
[2:08:21] mama i tell you the truth
[2:08:23] you know i don't know what we wouldn't
[2:08:25] be poor critters up in here
[2:08:29] but mama has been such um
[2:08:34] an angel for me
[2:08:36] that i just cherish everything about her
[2:08:38] i think she's the most magnificent
[2:08:40] person ever amen and if anybody haven't
[2:08:44] tasted her monster choli in her home
[2:08:56] but anyways i just want to say thank you
[2:08:59] guys and you know i'm you know
[2:09:02] i i will
[2:09:04] come be back more and
[2:09:07] um granted lord be a part of it but and
[2:09:10] and more of a
[2:09:12] i want to do something you know where
[2:09:14] i can bring more souls here amen and i
[2:09:17] would like to be in a position
[2:09:19] where i can feel confident in my spirit
[2:09:21] where i'm ready and able to do that so i
[2:09:24] just you know i pray for you you will
[2:09:26] pray for me
[2:09:28] i love you all and god
[2:09:30] amen praise the lord
[2:09:36] our sister was a another
[2:09:39] uh
[2:09:39] one that had been married here in this
[2:09:41] little church
[2:09:56] real quick
[2:10:00] you know
[2:10:01] the gratefulness that i had and now
[2:10:04] um accepting the way everyone treated
[2:10:06] david
[2:10:08] amen amen he was definitely had battles
[2:10:10] and struggles as we all do but
[2:10:13] amen he's always talk so highly of you
[2:10:16] and he's always praying for everyone he
[2:10:19] was a great example to me in my heart
[2:10:22] the importance of praying and not giving
[2:10:24] up in prayer
[2:10:26] right now i have davian at home laying
[2:10:28] in the bed and being tormented
[2:10:31] but i know he's coming amen that's right
[2:10:34] amen he's fighting with the nail
[2:10:36] but he's coming
[2:10:38] for sure so
[2:10:41] people that you bring in and they don't
[2:10:43] look like they're coming
[2:10:44] you just don't keep don't doubt it just
[2:10:47] keep trusting
[2:10:48] envision visualize i'm sitting here in
[2:10:51] church
[2:10:52] when mike was away for a while that's
[2:10:53] all i get every day i visualized him
[2:10:56] being back in church
[2:10:58] and i remember praying one night my turn
[2:11:00] out to the lord and saying lord put some
[2:11:02] song on his mind or his heart
[2:11:04] and two days later his wife called me
[2:11:06] and says mom mike's in your singing
[2:11:10] praises to the lord and you know see
[2:11:12] what god does
[2:11:13] bring them back in
[2:11:15] amen when we think about those that were
[2:11:18] here and they're not here because
[2:11:19] they've gone on
[2:11:21] they had a season to be with us
[2:11:24] and
[2:11:26] it is
[2:11:27] much more difficult than just telling
[2:11:29] somebody this is what you need to do
[2:11:32] right
[2:11:33] if you don't enjoy washing dirty feet if
[2:11:35] you don't enjoy
[2:11:38] really getting involved
[2:11:39] uh and helping them
[2:11:42] the only thing you can do is tell
[2:11:43] somebody when they're wrong this is what
[2:11:45] you need to do it it's very hard to see
[2:11:48] them grow
[2:11:50] and
[2:11:51] we never know whether one of us isn't
[2:11:53] going to be here next service
[2:11:55] and so while we have one another we
[2:11:57] really need to be jesus to one another
[2:11:59] amen amen now there was a few people
[2:12:03] at the same time that raised their hand
[2:12:05] so please
[2:12:06] forgive me if i'm not calling on you
[2:12:08] next because it's like simultaneously
[2:12:11] everybody went up at the same time
[2:12:13] hey man you're gonna ask
[2:12:14] um
[2:12:16] sister ann
[2:12:18] you were gonna work my way
[2:12:20] um
[2:12:22] i just wanted to say i'm grateful
[2:12:25] for the ministry here
[2:12:27] um
[2:12:29] i was
[2:12:31] this is kind of where i grew up both
[2:12:33] naturally and spiritually
[2:12:36] and i know that without this ministry
[2:12:39] i would not have a chance to make a
[2:12:41] rapture and i'm just so grateful for
[2:12:46] for what god has given here amen and um
[2:12:50] i just
[2:12:52] i just want to say thank you
[2:12:54] it's been an honor to leave her
[2:12:56] alongside of you yeah and
[2:12:59] good work in the kingdom amen and i just
[2:13:03] grateful for
[2:13:04] this body
[2:13:05] everybody that's represented here
[2:13:08] and
[2:13:09] i'm just thankful for your life so
[2:13:11] thankful that you've given your hearts
[2:13:13] to the lord
[2:13:14] and i just
[2:13:16] i can't wait for the future i'm really
[2:13:18] excited for
[2:13:20] all the contests
[2:13:24] i'm just just thankful to be fighting
[2:13:26] alongside you amen amen
[2:13:34] some may think that was kind of emotion
[2:13:36] talking
[2:13:37] but i'm going to tell you since i live
[2:13:39] with her i know her life
[2:13:42] and um
[2:13:45] her life is not emotion
[2:13:48] and she
[2:13:50] she's
[2:13:53] on her last trip that we just had
[2:13:56] um
[2:13:58] she's expressed that she has been to so
[2:14:00] many different churches
[2:14:01] so many different churches heard so many
[2:14:03] different ministers
[2:14:05] so many things are happening
[2:14:07] out there
[2:14:11] when she says she is truly grateful and
[2:14:13] that she doesn't believe she could make
[2:14:14] a rapture without the church she meant
[2:14:16] that the love of her heart
[2:14:18] not because of her death
[2:14:21] because of the ministry
[2:14:23] the ministry
[2:14:25] and the ministry is god's ministry as
[2:14:26] long as we keep god first
[2:14:30] that's right
[2:14:31] and
[2:14:33] i
[2:14:34] basically
[2:14:38] i bought miles on when elizabeth went
[2:14:41] because she was my right-hand man
[2:14:43] yeah and i didn't think you know there's
[2:14:45] just anybody that could
[2:14:47] help me as much as she did but
[2:14:49] this girl
[2:14:50] has been an energizer buddy whose
[2:14:53] batteries don't go out
[2:14:55] and she's
[2:14:56] she helps at work she helps at the house
[2:14:58] she helps with the church
[2:15:01] and
[2:15:03] she doesn't live for herself
[2:15:05] that's right and i'm grateful to be
[2:15:07] associated with her
[2:15:09] and to be
[2:15:10] to to labor with somebody like her and
[2:15:13] i'm grateful i just have to
[2:15:15] give thanks to the lord for her
[2:15:18] amen
[2:15:20] sister tricia
[2:15:22] i'm just gonna say if that's okay cause
[2:15:23] my back's been hurting me but um
[2:15:26] i just want to thank the lord for his
[2:15:28] faithfulness
[2:15:29] for his long suffering
[2:15:31] you know when you made a comment about
[2:15:33] before this church was even here god
[2:15:35] knew there was going to be a church on
[2:15:36] center road
[2:15:38] and
[2:15:39] i kind of feel like that throughout my
[2:15:40] life
[2:15:42] you know i was raised in church until i
[2:15:44] was 11. i knew the truth
[2:15:48] life circumstances happened and i went
[2:15:50] my own way
[2:15:54] even though i went my own way
[2:15:57] he never stopped watching me amen
[2:16:00] amen and while i was building a life
[2:16:03] he was preparing a place for me
[2:16:06] yes
[2:16:07] because he knew
[2:16:09] there would be a time and a season
[2:16:12] and a place
[2:16:13] and he was going to have something
[2:16:14] prepared for me
[2:16:16] and i remember my father would
[2:16:17] constantly
[2:16:19] talk about the word
[2:16:20] remind me where john martin was but the
[2:16:22] church was that it wasn't far
[2:16:25] and as much as
[2:16:26] it would aggravate me in the flesh
[2:16:29] don't ever be discouraged to keep
[2:16:30] telling somebody about jesus
[2:16:32] amen
[2:16:34] because it might in the moment be more
[2:16:36] than they want to hear
[2:16:38] but it could be the lifeline that saves
[2:16:39] them amen
[2:16:42] and how
[2:16:43] my entire life
[2:16:45] circled right back around
[2:16:47] and got prepared a place for me and not
[2:16:49] that this place isn't for everybody
[2:16:52] but when i found it it was personal to
[2:16:54] me praise god it was my place
[2:16:57] and god spoke to me here and god changed
[2:17:01] my life here
[2:17:03] and i'm thankful for the word
[2:17:06] i'm thankful that not only was it a
[2:17:07] refuge
[2:17:08] but he rebuilt my life amen and i'm so
[2:17:13] eternally grateful for that praise the
[2:17:15] lord
[2:17:15] praise the lord
[2:17:23] you know i don't like to say things
[2:17:25] about what the lord has shown me but you
[2:17:28] know as a shepherd
[2:17:29] we're taught that the shepherd knows the
[2:17:31] sheep right
[2:17:33] and
[2:17:35] i know that the lord had put
[2:17:38] her
[2:17:39] in in the church for us amen and i do
[2:17:42] believe that god puts
[2:17:45] we need one another
[2:17:46] that's right and um
[2:17:49] because we are a body
[2:17:50] a local body and that we we function
[2:17:53] together and
[2:17:54] learning how to function
[2:17:56] is is a growing process
[2:17:58] and um i'm just grateful for
[2:18:01] ev every member of the body
[2:18:03] of christ amen
[2:18:05] gabrielle you were gonna share something
[2:18:08] good to have you back been many years
[2:18:10] amen yeah it's been many years um so for
[2:18:12] anybody that doesn't know me um train is
[2:18:14] my mom
[2:18:16] and we started out coming to satellite i
[2:18:18] think before we
[2:18:20] were even in this building
[2:18:22] the very first
[2:18:24] services you know i remember being a kid
[2:18:26] and
[2:18:27] you know we were in the other room and
[2:18:29] then we outgrew that room and then we
[2:18:30] ended up getting the other side of the
[2:18:32] building for sunday school and extra
[2:18:34] space and
[2:18:36] i just want to share
[2:18:37] um because there's not very many of our
[2:18:39] youth that are
[2:18:41] that are here or even serving the lord
[2:18:44] but i just want to say everybody that's
[2:18:46] still here brother john and says gerald
[2:18:49] and brother martin's history between
[2:18:55] elders of the church
[2:18:57] you know the bible says that if you
[2:18:58] train up your child in the way that they
[2:19:00] will go they will never depart from it
[2:19:02] amen
[2:19:03] and all the elders that are here have
[2:19:05] shown me and the whole youth group
[2:19:08] the things that we were supposed to be
[2:19:10] doing to prepare to be that light that's
[2:19:13] supposed to go out into this world and
[2:19:14] even though i've been gone for a long
[2:19:16] time
[2:19:18] there were things that i learned helping
[2:19:20] doing the farmers market and the golf
[2:19:21] county
[2:19:22] working at the church working at brother
[2:19:24] john scissors cheryl's something as
[2:19:26] simple as washing the dishes for cheryl
[2:19:29] when we were preparing for the farmers
[2:19:31] market i remember just washing dishes
[2:19:34] and washing dishes and washing dishes
[2:19:35] and always just helping
[2:19:38] those things were preparing me to be
[2:19:40] where i'm at right now
[2:19:42] and even though i've been gone for so
[2:19:44] long i came with my son to be real on
[2:19:46] wednesday and it was a prayer meeting
[2:19:49] and my husband and i have been talking
[2:19:51] about
[2:19:52] church and the lord's been coming back
[2:19:54] and changing things in my life and
[2:19:56] cutting things off that i've been doing
[2:19:58] and
[2:19:59] just really hey man
[2:20:02] the last five years have been really
[2:20:04] difficult of things that i've struggled
[2:20:06] with i struggled with drinking i've
[2:20:07] struggled with
[2:20:09] smoking and
[2:20:10] the lord has totally just slapped those
[2:20:12] things right up out of my mind thank you
[2:20:14] lord
[2:20:16] and i just want to thank everybody
[2:20:17] that's here that ever spent five minutes
[2:20:20] sister lori we spent a lot of time
[2:20:22] sitting in the car talking by ourselves
[2:20:23] after church
[2:20:26] and i'll never forget those times that
[2:20:28] all of you guys had met with me to show
[2:20:30] me just a little bit of those lights in
[2:20:32] different areas amen praise god and all
[2:20:34] those things that i'm now sharing with
[2:20:36] my own kids
[2:20:38] and not just my three biological but
[2:20:40] five that were given to me that are
[2:20:42] extra special that are for me to help
[2:20:43] praise too amen
[2:20:46] so
[2:20:47] it's good to be back here i'm excited
[2:20:49] for the new building i'm excited to see
[2:20:51] what's coming amen
[2:20:54] you know just uh as soon as you said
[2:20:56] that we were gonna do testimonies
[2:20:58] get that feeling like okay you better
[2:21:00] get up there and say something
[2:21:02] if you don't know
[2:21:05] people just want to stay amen
[2:21:08] for everything that he's done here
[2:21:12] amen praise the lord
[2:21:19] there is a little bit of a common thread
[2:21:21] about
[2:21:24] even though you don't see the results
[2:21:26] that you want to see at the beginning
[2:21:28] you believe in them because we're not
[2:21:30] done until the rapture's open
[2:21:33] a lot of things can happen between now
[2:21:34] and then rapture may take place tomorrow
[2:21:36] but it may not for
[2:21:38] i don't know many more years you know we
[2:21:40] don't know but we just got to keep
[2:21:41] believing keep helping my my thinking
[2:21:44] has always been help as many people as
[2:21:46] you can in every way you can and just
[2:21:48] keep being christ everybody
[2:21:50] stay as far away as you can from any
[2:21:52] kind of partiality
[2:22:02] of course you are the
[2:22:06] queen just gonna say this from a little
[2:22:09] bit different perspective
[2:22:11] but
[2:22:12] i wasn't looking for a church
[2:22:15] obviously i was content where we were
[2:22:18] and
[2:22:19] the lord spoke to us both the same night
[2:22:22] we were in honduras
[2:22:24] and he told you that you were going to
[2:22:26] be starting a church here and
[2:22:28] he showed me in a vision it's the only
[2:22:30] vision i've ever had praise the lord but
[2:22:33] he showed me and we talked about it the
[2:22:35] next day and it was like
[2:22:38] a brand new world you know to come back
[2:22:40] here and planning this and we've gotten
[2:22:43] we got the building and
[2:22:45] started
[2:22:46] it was in february and you know we
[2:22:49] decided we were going to start having
[2:22:50] services in may
[2:22:52] and
[2:22:53] i learned all about a hard rugged life
[2:22:57] and i really learned what it meant to
[2:22:59] serve
[2:23:02] there were days i went to the airport
[2:23:03] twice you know taking missionaries
[2:23:06] picking up new missionaries whatever but
[2:23:10] that first service we had 17 people
[2:23:13] in addition to our family
[2:23:15] and
[2:23:17] it was just the beginning of
[2:23:20] planting seeds here in this area and
[2:23:25] i think that
[2:23:27] maybe it's been hard it's been super
[2:23:29] hard on my kids my family
[2:23:33] and
[2:23:36] i just have to agree with ann i've sat
[2:23:38] under other ministries and i know that
[2:23:42] i can make a rapture
[2:23:44] that's right
[2:23:50] and
[2:23:53] the lord has
[2:23:54] has done wonderful things here this
[2:23:57] building is kind of
[2:23:58] bittersweet amen
[2:24:04] praise god for all this stuff amen
[2:24:07] praise the lord
[2:24:15] okay
[2:24:16] that was very healthy
[2:24:18] so we started this church
[2:24:21] two weeks after we started i got
[2:24:23] pneumonia for the first time
[2:24:25] i've had it six times now in the last 20
[2:24:28] years
[2:24:29] my health is a mess
[2:24:31] terrible i
[2:24:33] have so many problems i've been through
[2:24:35] so much stuff
[2:24:37] but
[2:24:39] i believe that
[2:24:40] you know the lord is he's given me
[2:24:42] strength somehow amen amen
[2:24:46] thank you lord amen
[2:24:48] praise the lord
[2:24:50] you know it's like that means that i can
[2:24:51] only just pray for strength i have too
[2:24:53] many
[2:24:54] problems i can't even pray for all the
[2:24:57] problems that i have but praise god for
[2:25:00] all that he's done to help me amen amen
[2:25:02] thank you hallelujah
[2:25:04] praise the lord
[2:25:07] i know if i had a dollar for every time
[2:25:09] cheryl saw me study and she said that's
[2:25:11] enough you preach too long
[2:25:14] right now
[2:25:15] [Music]
[2:25:17] she said last night
[2:25:20] i'm so grateful for her because she's
[2:25:25] keeps me where i need to be
[2:25:27] [Music]
[2:25:31] amen
[2:25:39] isn't this a coincidence
[2:25:45] oh
[2:25:46] um
[2:25:48] i wasn't i wasn't i wasn't before
[2:25:56] many churches in my life
[2:26:03] i can't say that i've ever been to a
[2:26:05] church other than this one where
[2:26:08] i felt like a family
[2:26:14] had some bad experiences as a kid
[2:26:18] i've always believed in god
[2:26:25] well i'm being honest i felt like you
[2:26:27] know
[2:26:28] i'm just stuck in some
[2:26:30] in the light that
[2:26:32] it wasn't fair but
[2:26:35] now in my elder years i see that
[2:26:39] life isn't fair it's a
[2:26:46] struggle wasn't until i came here that i
[2:26:49] actually started to
[2:26:52] awaken i guess um
[2:27:08] i feel blessed
[2:27:12] i had this opportunity to be with you
[2:27:14] all
[2:27:25] um
[2:27:30] um
[2:27:32] i guess growing up i've always been
[2:27:34] the way in the
[2:27:43] not world by choice but by deception
[2:27:49] he has a way of
[2:27:51] grabbing a hold of people
[2:27:53] yeah
[2:27:56] and unless they
[2:27:58] run into
[2:28:00] a pastor like brother john or
[2:28:02] some kind of mentor
[2:28:06] it helps them to release the bondage
[2:28:08] yes amen
[2:28:22] anyway
[2:28:27] bless him jesus
[2:28:29] big inspiration amen praise god for the
[2:28:33] martyrdom
[2:28:35] brother roger
[2:28:40] well there's many here
[2:28:43] ryan
[2:28:45] i
[2:28:47] usually don't hear me say too much about
[2:28:49] anything
[2:28:51] i don't know if it's natural but i
[2:28:53] intend to be a little mysterious
[2:28:56] and then called vague and
[2:29:00] there's a lot going inside of my heart
[2:29:03] [Music]
[2:29:07] sister anne just recently helped me
[2:29:11] uh i've been
[2:29:14] grateful for helping at the church
[2:29:17] amen
[2:29:20] all the things that god has blessed me
[2:29:22] with our talents i've been able to share
[2:29:25] amen
[2:29:26] i'm really not looking for recognition
[2:29:28] for that what i am
[2:29:30] the
[2:29:32] blessings i'll be seeing you all
[2:29:34] amen
[2:29:42] [Music]
[2:29:48] to the new building without me having
[2:29:50] brother graham on it pretty pretty true
[2:29:53] i uh got caught up
[2:29:56] listening to the ways of the world and
[2:29:58] yeah
[2:29:59] angry about what's going on
[2:30:04] all right as i listen to brother branham
[2:30:06] i've listened to many messages in the
[2:30:09] last probably
[2:30:11] uh six months
[2:30:13] and uh starting to feel a joy in my
[2:30:16] heart amen
[2:30:27] if you just
[2:30:28] seek jesus yeah
[2:30:31] nothing else really matters amen that's
[2:30:33] right
[2:30:34] that's right amen
[2:30:38] i really don't want to take too much in
[2:30:40] time but
[2:30:42] i was baptized in this room
[2:30:47] i had been like sister joyce been
[2:30:49] baptized before two or three times
[2:30:54] [Music]
[2:30:56] didn't really mean much to me then i you
[2:30:58] know it was just what everybody did
[2:31:02] and like i said
[2:31:04] there's a lot of churches
[2:31:07] there's very few that
[2:31:09] truly
[2:31:11] are seeking
[2:31:26] you and your brother
[2:31:28] amen amen amen amen
[2:31:33] [Music]
[2:31:40] testimony from the heart
[2:31:42] amen
[2:31:44] it's just beautiful amen
[2:31:47] god's
[2:31:48] sure sister god taking our hearts and
[2:31:51] just squeezing them
[2:31:53] so love can come out and be expressed
[2:31:55] back to god amen
[2:31:59] um so i want to make this as as brief as
[2:32:02] i can
[2:32:03] summarize some of the things but i will
[2:32:06] just say that
[2:32:07] the service
[2:32:09] that you had ministered today really
[2:32:11] matches the testimony that i have for
[2:32:13] the church here
[2:32:15] as well
[2:32:17] so
[2:32:19] gabe
[2:32:21] some of you knew gabe um
[2:32:24] my children's father
[2:32:26] um and some of you didn't get an
[2:32:28] opportunity he passed away in 2005 but
[2:32:32] before we had moved out to the benton
[2:32:34] area
[2:32:35] i had been struggling in the world
[2:32:37] myself and in this
[2:32:40] very disturbed type of
[2:32:42] home life
[2:32:44] and i was at the time an at-home mom
[2:32:47] and
[2:32:49] and i had just been battling a lot of
[2:32:50] things and
[2:32:52] one night we went to bed and i had this
[2:32:54] dream
[2:32:55] that was so surreal
[2:32:59] the lord came to me in a dream and
[2:33:02] showed me in this dream that
[2:33:05] i was gonna go in this rapture
[2:33:07] and when i woke up i had no idea where i
[2:33:10] was it took me like five minutes to
[2:33:12] realize i was at home in my own bed and
[2:33:15] i started falling
[2:33:17] because i wasn't with god i thought i
[2:33:20] was going in the rapture when i was
[2:33:21] sleeping it was just that real i was
[2:33:24] there
[2:33:25] and so um
[2:33:28] it was
[2:33:29] maybe a few months later
[2:33:32] where we were living that um gabe had
[2:33:36] found us a place to live out on
[2:33:37] heartland road
[2:33:39] which just so happens to be about seven
[2:33:42] houses or so from john and cheryl
[2:33:45] and
[2:33:46] gabe lived or he worked for his father
[2:33:49] um which is the the lawn and snow
[2:33:51] business um
[2:33:54] and he had a lawn account at trusted
[2:33:56] tool
[2:33:57] and gabe used to come home and tell me
[2:33:59] that guy over there is talking to me
[2:34:01] about jesus
[2:34:03] [Music]
[2:34:06] talking to me about jesus
[2:34:08] so one night he comes home and he says
[2:34:11] well i talked to that guy again he said
[2:34:14] sometime him and another friend of his
[2:34:16] is gonna come to a bible study
[2:34:18] and i'm like oh okay no big deal and
[2:34:21] he's like well you better get ready
[2:34:23] you'll be here in 30 minutes
[2:34:29] so i was like feel me because you know
[2:34:32] he's bringing this me and i don't know
[2:34:34] and
[2:34:35] and another man too
[2:34:38] finished getting my kids ready for bed
[2:34:40] and
[2:34:41] okay so i'm like all right by the time
[2:34:43] they
[2:34:44] anybody knows me i can be very upset and
[2:34:47] then go to okay i'm calming down i'm
[2:34:50] trying to change my attitude whatever so
[2:34:53] that's how it was by the time they
[2:34:54] showed up
[2:34:55] they as in um brother john
[2:34:58] and uh brother casco
[2:35:00] who was the first
[2:35:02] people that i have met um that was my
[2:35:05] first introduction
[2:35:07] and um
[2:35:09] we sat down and had kitchen bible study
[2:35:12] and as we were i had already been to
[2:35:15] church
[2:35:16] who brother ben was talking about um
[2:35:18] earlier he went to
[2:35:20] south point tabernacle years ago and
[2:35:22] that's where i was initially grounded in
[2:35:25] any type of the word is that self blend
[2:35:28] tabernacle as well as a young girl
[2:35:31] and so when brother john and brother
[2:35:33] pascal were doing their bible study
[2:35:38] it started making sense and it was like
[2:35:40] something in me was just stirring with i
[2:35:43] know
[2:35:44] the i know these words i just haven't
[2:35:46] heard them in so long
[2:35:48] and um and at the same time we just you
[2:35:51] know uh it just blew up because um
[2:35:55] gabe uh didn't know the word at all and
[2:35:58] um
[2:36:00] so he was getting angry and just putting
[2:36:02] digs on me and i i left and
[2:36:05] uh i went and got a pack of cigarettes
[2:36:09] when got a pack of cigarettes a smoky
[2:36:11] cigarette on the way home
[2:36:13] and um by the time i walked in brother
[2:36:16] john brother casco had already had
[2:36:18] whatever part of the meeting they were
[2:36:19] gonna have with him
[2:36:21] and um
[2:36:23] and uh we got there for the remainder of
[2:36:25] the night i think until probably 11 or
[2:36:27] 11 30 that night uh we we sat there
[2:36:30] talking around the word and just it was
[2:36:34] it was at that point when gabe went to
[2:36:36] bed and i sat there the evening with
[2:36:38] them that my life started to change amen
[2:36:42] thank you jesus i was so grateful and so
[2:36:44] thankful and and brother john continued
[2:36:46] having
[2:36:48] some bible studies with me and and uh
[2:36:52] um talking to me um he takes some time
[2:36:55] and you know checked on me and see how i
[2:36:57] was doing and things
[2:36:59] and
[2:37:01] i recall um i called him up one day
[2:37:04] um at trusted tool i called him up and
[2:37:07] you might not even remember this i think
[2:37:09] i may have told you this before and you
[2:37:11] didn't remember so you probably don't
[2:37:12] still
[2:37:15] meant so much to me
[2:37:17] this is where i had an introduction
[2:37:21] to
[2:37:21] the messages
[2:37:23] i called brother john i said i had the
[2:37:25] strangest dream about you and another
[2:37:28] man in my dream last night
[2:37:31] and there was a storm brewing around me
[2:37:34] and uh and we came into this building
[2:37:36] and we sat down you and this man sat
[2:37:38] down with me and you started showing me
[2:37:41] this book it was like a real thin book
[2:37:43] it wasn't a bible
[2:37:45] but it was a real thin book
[2:37:47] and in the book it had like
[2:37:49] scripture words but like somebody else
[2:37:52] was talking
[2:37:54] and and it was i can't really understand
[2:37:57] exactly what it was
[2:38:00] but the one side it had like some white
[2:38:02] blue clouds it had clouds on it
[2:38:05] and you said
[2:38:08] i brought some books with me to work
[2:38:10] today
[2:38:11] i'll stop by and drop them off on my way
[2:38:13] home
[2:38:14] so you came to the house and you're
[2:38:16] standing at the back door there and
[2:38:18] you're like these are the books that i
[2:38:20] brought and you you showed me the front
[2:38:23] and you said is this the book you saw
[2:38:25] and all i saw on it was the clouds and i
[2:38:27] said that's the book that's what i saw
[2:38:31] and i opened the book and it was
[2:38:34] i saw there was scripture i thought it
[2:38:35] was like somebody was talking
[2:38:37] and i'm like this is when i stopped this
[2:38:39] is what i saw at my dreams amen
[2:38:42] and i didn't even know then those were
[2:38:44] message books of brother branches
[2:38:48] and so um you were asking me at that
[2:38:51] point who was this other man i said i
[2:38:53] don't know i've never seen this man
[2:38:55] before
[2:38:56] so it wasn't until a couple years after
[2:38:59] we started in
[2:39:00] our church here
[2:39:02] um we went to have like a sister church
[2:39:06] gathering
[2:39:08] i think at brother bailey's
[2:39:10] uh brother bill billy and when we went
[2:39:13] in there that day he for whatever reason
[2:39:15] he wasn't actually ministering somebody
[2:39:17] else was ministering but he was doing
[2:39:20] some sort of a
[2:39:21] song or a prayer surprise whatever and
[2:39:24] after that church service i told you i
[2:39:26] said brother john
[2:39:27] that's the man i saw in my dream that
[2:39:30] with you showing me these books and you
[2:39:33] said which one the one preaching i said
[2:39:35] no
[2:39:35] it was the one leading songs and you
[2:39:38] said that was my pastor
[2:39:40] and i had no idea that was the first
[2:39:42] time i had ever seen him
[2:39:44] so i just i don't know if that's like um
[2:39:47] a church order thing i had
[2:39:49] no idea still but i'm just saying it's
[2:39:52] just
[2:39:53] the message today about the lord
[2:39:55] reaching out and looking for the one
[2:39:57] lost
[2:39:58] uh while you have
[2:40:00] um the 99 here or by your first thought
[2:40:03] you have one but where are the nines and
[2:40:06] so it was like the lord was reaching out
[2:40:08] to me even though he didn't necessarily
[2:40:11] have
[2:40:12] um
[2:40:14] one of our brothers and sisters here to
[2:40:16] come in and get me
[2:40:18] but he used
[2:40:20] he used gate
[2:40:22] okay
[2:40:23] and he used that business to get a hold
[2:40:26] of you and
[2:40:27] um
[2:40:28] and those were all different tools
[2:40:30] the lord is going to accomplish whatever
[2:40:33] your destiny has already been laid out
[2:40:35] and you just
[2:40:36] pray
[2:40:38] uh that the lord will lead you in every
[2:40:40] footstep and you know and and we're just
[2:40:43] humans we make mistakes we fall we just
[2:40:46] pray that the lord will forgive us and
[2:40:48] help us to continue walking in that
[2:40:50] footsteps so that we can continue um
[2:40:54] you know walking in his will
[2:40:56] and you know so
[2:40:58] and pray for each other with
[2:41:01] that's what's important because we don't
[2:41:03] know
[2:41:04] a lot of times people look at somebody
[2:41:06] else's life
[2:41:08] and i know it's important that we want
[2:41:09] to be a reflection of the lord
[2:41:13] but sometimes you might look at someone
[2:41:15] and you're not seeing
[2:41:17] such a good reflection yeah um
[2:41:20] but there may be something else really
[2:41:22] brewing up inside here and we don't know
[2:41:24] what it is so we just need to keep
[2:41:25] praying for them
[2:41:27] and just pouring out the love
[2:41:30] that's right
[2:41:31] because uh you know i'm just as guilty
[2:41:33] as the next person right so i just want
[2:41:36] to encourage everybody to just keep
[2:41:39] praying for one another and keep
[2:41:41] pressing forward because god has he's
[2:41:44] going to use whatever he needs to to get
[2:41:46] your attention amen whatever he needs to
[2:41:49] to get your attention
[2:41:50] and um and bring you closer to him
[2:42:04] i was thinking
[2:42:05] on the way to church this morning
[2:42:08] i was thinking about my memory their
[2:42:11] sister
[2:42:12] brought out that
[2:42:14] so perfectly said that even though i
[2:42:17] reminded you you still probably forgot
[2:42:21] i was thinking this morning my way to
[2:42:23] church how
[2:42:25] many things i have forgotten
[2:42:27] and
[2:42:28] honestly
[2:42:30] i feel like i've forgotten every every
[2:42:33] good thing that i've ever done
[2:42:36] but satan will not let you know let you
[2:42:38] forget the bad things you need right now
[2:42:42] [Music]
[2:42:43] and uh
[2:42:45] that's his job that's right that's right
[2:42:47] that's his job amen
[2:42:50] but we need to
[2:42:51] press forward
[2:42:55] amen before we when i get dismissed i
[2:42:57] want to show you a little
[2:43:00] five minute of the pictures of the new
[2:43:01] church real quick and
[2:43:04] were we saving the best for last
[2:43:07] [Music]
[2:43:09] i just want to testify this church has
[2:43:11] meant so much to me
[2:43:13] i just remember uh my grandfather's
[2:43:15] funeral i just remember seeing him
[2:43:16] brother john just to cheryl there that's
[2:43:18] like the only thing i really remember is
[2:43:19] turning around and seeing them i had no
[2:43:21] idea who they were you know what their
[2:43:23] names even were
[2:43:24] and come to find out they'll be such a
[2:43:26] big part of my life you know my
[2:43:28] spiritual growth i remember uh youtube
[2:43:30] and ann would always constantly you know
[2:43:32] i was in the world just constantly you
[2:43:34] know try to reach out to me take me to
[2:43:35] dinner and you know a lot of times i'll
[2:43:38] brush it off but when i look back at it
[2:43:40] the lord was using you guys and all of
[2:43:42] you guys too in this church i know you
[2:43:44] guys were praying for me and i honor
[2:43:46] those prayers that's why i'm even here
[2:43:49] i today you know going here since 2004
[2:43:52] and when i turned 18 i don't know
[2:43:54] nothing to a church i just want to do my
[2:43:56] own thing i remember what i did that was
[2:43:57] like one of the worst years of my life
[2:43:59] and i always believed in god and
[2:44:02] always knew
[2:44:03] you know that guy you know had a plan
[2:44:05] for me but i just didn't want to submit
[2:44:07] to it
[2:44:08] and uh definitely thank kelly so much
[2:44:10] that guy put her in my life i don't know
[2:44:13] definitely sent her a mama uh she's done
[2:44:16] so much broke her back to you know
[2:44:18] provide for me on so many things in so
[2:44:20] many areas and i'm i'm turning grateful
[2:44:22] for my grandma as well she's been
[2:44:24] rocking my life as well
[2:44:26] and i'm still thinking towards the
[2:44:27] church you know these last four years i
[2:44:29] gave march to the lord at 17. these last
[2:44:31] four years have been the best four years
[2:44:33] of my life amen
[2:44:34] i remember before giving my heart to the
[2:44:35] lord each time i come here
[2:44:37] i would just
[2:44:39] like a question to pop my mind how can
[2:44:41] you not hear anymore you know this feels
[2:44:42] the spirit in here was just so sweet and
[2:44:45] so welcoming and so warming and every
[2:44:47] time i would come here i'm like man why
[2:44:48] am i staying away from here and even
[2:44:50] sometimes i was in the world like do a
[2:44:52] long trip off listen to her brother
[2:44:53] brains for the random tape here and
[2:44:54] there because i just knew this was the
[2:44:56] truth you know i was just running away
[2:44:57] from it
[2:44:58] these last four years have been the best
[2:45:00] four years of my life this ministry has
[2:45:02] challenged me
[2:45:03] uh to become closer in christ to
[2:45:05] manifest christ
[2:45:07] brother john is such a special
[2:45:10] pastor a minister you know to us he's
[2:45:12] not just some old minister
[2:45:20] he truly cares
[2:45:22] about my heart you know
[2:45:23] he's he wants what the lord wants you
[2:45:25] know he moves up all the way he studies
[2:45:28] many hours like brother marty says and
[2:45:29] he sacrificed him his wife and his
[2:45:31] daughters have sacrificed so much just
[2:45:33] for us
[2:45:35] and for the word and he could probably
[2:45:37] do so many things his wife had done so
[2:45:38] many things his daughter but they'd
[2:45:40] rather be servants for god you know it's
[2:45:42] like you know
[2:45:43] they care about the season of sin that's
[2:45:45] what
[2:45:46] the lord wants and i can say i'm truly
[2:45:48] grateful for each and every one of you
[2:45:49] this church
[2:45:50] i wouldn't be here today
[2:45:52] uh if god didn't honor your prayers
[2:45:55] and this church is very surreal to think
[2:45:57] that this is our last service you know i
[2:45:59] never would have thought about it
[2:46:01] and uh i can't wait for the the new
[2:46:03] growth that's going to happen in our new
[2:46:04] church i believe all my heart that the
[2:46:06] lord is through the fruit of our
[2:46:07] ministry is gonna
[2:46:09] have souls new souls there
[2:46:11] who have been met with more musicians
[2:46:14] assistant pastor guitar players
[2:46:17] i believe a backup piano player sister
[2:46:20] cheryl would love to worship i remember
[2:46:21] the only time i've ever seen a worship
[2:46:23] was when the fontaine's came and i've
[2:46:25] never seen worship because she's playing
[2:46:26] the piano all the time so i'm just
[2:46:28] leaving all my art that she's going to
[2:46:29] be able to take a break and just sit
[2:46:30] down
[2:46:33] i'm thankful for the martin family
[2:46:36] i'm indebted to you guys
[2:46:39] is that a two bucks for me hey man i
[2:46:41] thank you for that
[2:46:52] mother mark has been such a blessing
[2:46:55] to me personally
[2:46:56] because of his genuine desire
[2:47:01] it's always expressed that he wants to
[2:47:03] help
[2:47:04] amen
[2:47:05] it's just
[2:47:06] non-stop
[2:47:08] wanting to help
[2:47:10] and uh i do believe god put him in the
[2:47:13] church to help
[2:47:15] and
[2:47:16] i believe god is going to use him in
[2:47:18] great ways
[2:47:20] i believe that for sure give i give god
[2:47:23] thanks for free
[2:47:25] amen
[2:47:28] amen
[2:47:29] oh one more
[2:47:31] i just wanted to say this
[2:47:33] just something simple here
[2:47:35] the golf outings that we did
[2:47:38] the farmers markets you know all the
[2:47:41] people we witnessed to over the years
[2:47:44] we think well
[2:47:45] nobody came but that isn't the truth
[2:47:48] because
[2:47:49] many people that we had invited the gulf
[2:47:51] outing and whatever they're still
[2:47:53] talking about
[2:47:54] so all those years we did those things
[2:47:56] those are seeds
[2:47:58] cast your bread upon the water
[2:48:00] and said the light has certainly done
[2:48:02] that
[2:48:03] and i see
[2:48:04] a number of sunday school kids sitting
[2:48:06] here
[2:48:08] that have been prayed for for years
[2:48:10] amen
[2:48:12] elizabeth started the sunday school here
[2:48:14] she started a wonderful work here with
[2:48:17] um and she had brother mark and sister
[2:48:19] ann
[2:48:20] when they were small i inherited them a
[2:48:23] little bit when they got a little bit
[2:48:24] older but
[2:48:25] you know
[2:48:26] i can't even
[2:48:28] express to you
[2:48:30] the importance of your children being in
[2:48:32] church
[2:48:33] being brought up in the lord how that
[2:48:37] has made a difference in their lives
[2:48:40] amen and the sunday school is really
[2:48:43] it's a place where the kids need to be
[2:48:45] because it's an extension
[2:48:47] of
[2:48:48] the ministry here
[2:48:49] that's right and um
[2:48:51] i did it for many years i didn't want to
[2:48:54] do it at first i just got the mantle
[2:48:56] handed to me but it grew and the lord
[2:49:00] blessed it and then master tricia has
[2:49:02] taken that over and
[2:49:04] it's just
[2:49:06] your kids train up the children the way
[2:49:08] they should go when they get pulled to
[2:49:10] depart from that i don't care that
[2:49:12] they're not here yet that's right
[2:49:14] they're going to come together
[2:49:19] the prayers of
[2:49:20] the righteous we'll bring those kids
[2:49:22] back
[2:49:23] and um
[2:49:24] cheyenne has been in sunday school many
[2:49:26] times and
[2:49:27] you know the lord he has his ways of
[2:49:30] doing things and dealing with kids like
[2:49:32] his sister
[2:49:36] was saying about sterling you know and i
[2:49:38] do pray for him i pray for all the
[2:49:40] sunday school kids
[2:49:42] i can't forget them
[2:49:43] you know praise the lord maybe we're the
[2:49:45] only ones praying for them
[2:49:47] in the world and maybe we're the only
[2:49:49] ones gathering santa too and one husband
[2:49:53] had to have these older kids and
[2:49:56] it was just a blessing to do that and
[2:49:58] became an extension of the ministry
[2:50:01] and that was the vision that brother
[2:50:03] john has always said
[2:50:06] without a vision people perish with
[2:50:08] their vision the children will perish
[2:50:11] and we can see that happening in the
[2:50:12] world right now
[2:50:14] if that doesn't
[2:50:16] bring you in closer
[2:50:18] i don't know what's going on
[2:50:33] in this church if everybody that came he
[2:50:36] was here we'd have a great big mega
[2:50:38] church
[2:50:39] wow
[2:50:42] but you know not everybody can take the
[2:50:44] truth that's it
[2:50:46] they don't they can't can't sit under it
[2:50:48] but i'm thankful to go out there amen
[2:50:50] you've been able to sit under it and
[2:50:52] you've never spoken anything with the
[2:50:54] truth here yeah remember the bible
[2:50:56] ministry that's come through here
[2:50:58] unbelievable i don't know when another
[2:51:00] church has had an eiffel ministry like
[2:51:02] this and
[2:51:04] she goes to lots of different message
[2:51:06] churches but
[2:51:08] when i talk to people they're like what
[2:51:10] i'm like
[2:51:11] yeah
[2:51:12] puts his money where his mouth is
[2:51:15] i'm grateful for that
[2:51:22] we have our first missionary coming in
[2:51:24] november amen yeah it's been a while
[2:51:27] since you know since this culver thing
[2:51:28] had happened so we're looking forward to
[2:51:30] that we
[2:51:31] do have some um brothers lined up
[2:51:33] already next year
[2:51:36] and uh some that we've never had before
[2:51:39] and so we're we're excited about our
[2:51:41] future as well we need a five-fold
[2:51:43] ministry amen
[2:51:44] amen amen if all the hearts are oh
[2:51:48] brother jonathan i don't necessarily
[2:51:49] have a testimony that i want to thank
[2:51:51] the church for um you know at all you
[2:51:54] know pouring into my wife and her mom
[2:51:56] trina amen sisters but um
[2:51:58] you know i heard a little everybody
[2:52:00] speaking and
[2:52:02] you know just because some of those
[2:52:04] people aren't here
[2:52:06] doesn't mean they're not in another
[2:52:07] house doesn't mean they're not praying
[2:52:08] at night that's right you know
[2:52:10] doesn't mean that that god's numbers of
[2:52:13] the body of christ haven't grown that's
[2:52:15] right um i just felt like the holy
[2:52:17] spirit was you know stirring that in my
[2:52:18] heart that just because that you're not
[2:52:21] seeing
[2:52:22] maybe some of them you know but the ones
[2:52:24] you don't know and the golf outings and
[2:52:26] things just because you don't see those
[2:52:28] people in this house doesn't mean
[2:52:30] they're not in another state
[2:52:32] or another city serving the lord
[2:52:35] you know so i just wanted to say that
[2:52:44] that's very encouraging amen amen
[2:52:48] well if all hearts are feeling good um
[2:52:50] we wanted to show you something
[2:52:54] and it's
[2:52:56] it's a the new church
[2:52:59] and uh
[2:53:01] i want to thank ann
[2:53:04] uh
[2:53:05] for
[2:53:07] the
[2:53:08] putting this thing together for us
[2:53:09] yesterday
[2:53:10] and she's uh very
[2:53:13] shy to learn the program
[2:53:15] she's just
[2:53:17] so grateful
[2:53:18] for her amen
[2:53:21] now in building this church
[2:53:24] it's kind of been a building project
[2:53:26] hasn't it
[2:53:27] i mean it wasn't like starting from
[2:53:29] scratch but it kind of would have been
[2:53:30] easier in certain aspects
[2:53:39] um
[2:53:41] my dad's brother stand to work on an
[2:53:43] area just do this
[2:53:45] and he'd have to fix all the flaws
[2:53:47] that were there from before
[2:53:50] and that was you know would just add
[2:53:52] time and yeah sure but when we
[2:53:55] we had a number of
[2:53:57] employees if i could say like that
[2:53:59] people from our our shop we had certain
[2:54:02] brothers here that we've
[2:54:04] helped us and we've we believe
[2:54:07] a worker is worthy of his height
[2:54:12] and
