[25:39] here
[25:41] that know that my wife and myself
[25:44] years ago we had a promise given to us
[25:47] it's been about 13 years i believe right
[25:50] around 13 years
[25:52] and we've been holding on to a promise
[25:54] and there's been dreams that's come
[25:56] across
[25:57] there's been a couple prophecies and
[26:00] through the 13 years
[26:02] of waiting there has been times where we
[26:05] both our faith would
[26:07] would go down perhaps mine would go down
[26:09] and she would bring me up or vice versa
[26:11] because we are a help mate so when i'm
[26:13] down she brings me up
[26:14] and vice versa um but there are some
[26:17] believers in here that know the
[26:18] situation
[26:19] they have been praying with us for 13 14
[26:22] years
[26:23] but we are expecting so we are pregnant

[26:54] doing now i got people saying you're too
[26:55] old what are you doing so i mean
[26:57] my thing is is it's his timing he knows
[27:01] so i just want to give the lord all the
[27:04] praise for it
[27:05] because it was his timing
[27:08] amen
[27:10] [Applause]

[33:52] verse number 1 and you have he quickened
[33:56] who were dead in trespasses and sins
[34:00] where in times past you walked according
[34:03] to the course
[34:04] of this world everybody remember that
[34:07] according to the prince of the power of
[34:09] the air
[34:10] the spirit that is now working in
[34:13] children
[34:14] the children of disobedience among whom
[34:17] also we all had our conversation in
[34:19] times past
[34:20] in other words we could relate to these
[34:22] things
[34:23] and the lust of the flesh fulfilling the
[34:25] desires of the flesh and of the mind
[34:27] were by nature
[34:28] our very nature the children of wrath
[34:32] even as others but god who is rich
[34:36] in mercy he owns a cat on a thousand
[34:39] hills
[34:41] but he's also rich in mercy amen
[34:46] for his great love wherewith he loved us
[34:49] even when we were dead and sins have
[34:52] quickened us together
[34:53] with christ by grace
[34:56] ye are saved and have raised us up
[35:00] together and made us to sit together
[35:02] in heavenly places in christ jesus that
[35:05] in the ages to come he might show the
[35:07] exceeding riches
[35:08] of his grace in his kindness towards us
[35:12] through christ jesus for by grace are
[35:15] you saved
[35:16] through faith and that not of yourselves
[35:19] it is the gift of god
[35:21] not of works lest any man should boast
[35:25] about it
[35:26] for we are his workmanship created in
[35:29] christ jesus unto good works
[35:31] which god had before ordained that we
[35:34] should walk
[35:35] in them amen and god bless you may be
[35:42] seated
[35:45] for a subject today we'd like to take
[35:48] grace for growth
[35:52] god has given us grace to grow
[35:56] god is good it's one thing we can come
[36:00] together
[36:01] and agree on that god is good amen
[36:04] psalms 86 verse 15 says but thou
[36:06] o lord art a god full of compassion
[36:10] and gracious long-suffering and
[36:13] plenteous in mercy and in truth that's
[36:16] the god
[36:17] that we're serving this morning the god
[36:20] that we serve
[36:21] is full of grace amen he's rich in mercy
[36:25] one of the major reasons that almighty
[36:28] god allowed
[36:29] man to fall was to be able for him to
[36:32] express certain attributes
[36:34] that he had inside of him that he would
[36:36] never be able to express
[36:38] in a perfect setting so he had to allow
[36:42] a setting to happen where other
[36:44] attributes could come out
[36:46] and paul described it like this
[36:49] in our opening scripture he says to show
[36:52] the exceeding
[36:53] riches of his grace in his kindness
[36:57] towards us through christ jesus in other
[37:00] words if man would never about a fault
[37:01] those those riches of his grace
[37:05] would never be able to show towards his
[37:06] kindness through his kindness
[37:09] and he used it was all through jesus
[37:11] christ
[37:13] god is rich in mercy he's rich in grace
[37:16] for his great love we're with he loved
[37:19] us we could all
[37:20] say that god is good all the time
[37:24] even even when we're being corrected god
[37:27] is good
[37:28] amen he's worthy of our praise
[37:32] jesus became the very expression of the
[37:36] father's
[37:36] attribute of grace john chapter 1 verse
[37:40] 1 says in the beginning
[37:42] was the word and the word was with god
[37:44] and the word
[37:45] was with god in the word was god and in
[37:48] verse 14 that
[37:50] same word was made flesh and dwelt among
[37:53] us and we beheld the glory
[37:55] the glory is the only begotten of the
[37:57] father full
[37:59] of grace and truth that word
[38:03] manifested in the flesh was full of
[38:06] grace
[38:06] amen jesus became the very expression of
[38:10] his father
[38:11] which was full of grace right an
[38:13] abundance of it
[38:15] and and when we behold the glory of god
[38:18] today
[38:19] we will see that it is full of grace
[38:21] amen
[38:22] the father gave grace for his son jesus
[38:25] to grow
[38:29] in other words he gave him grace to grow
[38:32] luke chapter 2 verse 40 says jesus
[38:34] grew and wacked strong in spirit
[38:38] filled with wisdom and the grace of god
[38:41] was upon him from the get-go the grace
[38:45] of god
[38:46] was upon him and as jesus matured
[38:49] because we know that jesus
[38:50] learned obedience by the things he
[38:52] suffered he became
[38:54] the expression of the same grace that
[38:57] was in his father
[39:00] amen and the word that was made flesh in
[39:02] jesus christ was full
[39:04] of grace and that grace made a way and
[39:07] gave an
[39:07] opportunity for growth to take place
[39:10] that's what grace is for
[39:14] it gives a chance for growth there are
[39:17] many examples of god's grace
[39:19] manifested in the flesh when that woman
[39:22] was caught in adultery
[39:25] we don't have time to go through all the
[39:27] stories but you just read the new
[39:28] testament you'll see
[39:29] lots of examples of grace's seat in the
[39:32] old testament
[39:33] even the the god and the children of
[39:35] israel
[39:36] but here is this woman she was caught in
[39:38] the very act there's no doubt that
[39:40] she was wrong and and and and god
[39:43] gave grace and that grace was for growth
[39:46] because he said go
[39:47] and sin no more but see even her
[39:50] accusers receive grace on that day
[39:53] he could annihilated them all he could
[39:55] have said well i'm i'm judging you for
[39:57] this but i'm not going to because i
[39:59] haven't come here to judge
[40:00] i've come to to give a time of grace and
[40:03] just he that's without sin let him do it
[40:10] little zacchaeus in that tree
[40:14] he received grace to grow and when he
[40:16] received that grace he just
[40:18] he expressed it i'm gonna give back i'm
[40:20] gonna give four times as much
[40:22] because you know i i did this wrong and
[40:24] i want to i want to pay what i owe
[40:28] jesus faithfully went to nazareth the
[40:30] bible says and
[40:31] he read the scriptures in the synagogue
[40:34] yet he was rejected by the people by the
[40:38] majority of them
[40:39] one time after he read the scriptures he
[40:42] closed the book and he
[40:43] and you know the scripture and he gave
[40:45] it to the minister and he sat down and
[40:47] the eyes
[40:48] of all them that were in the synagogue
[40:51] were fastened on him
[40:53] in luke chapter 4 verse 21 we'll pick it
[40:55] up and he began to say unto them this
[40:57] day
[40:58] is the scripture fulfilled in your ears
[41:00] amen and
[41:01] all bear witness and wondered
[41:05] at the gracious words which proceeded
[41:09] out of his mouth and they said
[41:12] is this not this is this not
[41:16] i'm sorry is not this joseph's son
[41:20] just trying to relate
[41:23] him to joseph's son instead of our
[41:26] heavenly father
[41:28] and he said unto them look at the very
[41:30] next thing and he said unto them
[41:32] ye will surely say unto me this proverb
[41:35] position
[41:36] heal thyself whatsoever we have heard
[41:40] done in camponium do you also hear in
[41:43] thy country
[41:45] in other words they doubted him
[41:48] it was because of their own unbelief
[41:51] they couldn't get the blessing
[41:52] amen they were blaming it on him amen
[41:58] but gracious words still proceeded out
[42:01] of his mouth and it gave them an
[42:03] opportunity to grow amen
[42:07] so much of the father's grace was
[42:09] manifested
[42:10] in the life of jesus christ he said in
[42:12] matthew chapter 11 verse 28 come unto me
[42:15] all ye that labor and our heavy laden
[42:18] and i will give you rest
[42:20] take my yoke upon you learn to me for
[42:22] unique and
[42:23] lowly in heart ye shall find rest for
[42:25] your souls for my yoke is easy
[42:27] and my burden is light he said one time
[42:31] how often
[42:32] i would have uh gathered you together
[42:35] and
[42:35] or or uh yeah gathered you together as a
[42:39] a a a hen a check does this brew
[42:42] you know just come together and let's
[42:44] just be together a family
[42:48] but he would not he had so much grace he
[42:53] was given out he was just
[42:54] full of grace but but people are full of
[42:56] pride
[43:01] even up to the time of his crucifixion
[43:04] we
[43:05] i've you know me i always got lots of
[43:07] scriptures
[43:10] if we could just read a little bit here
[43:12] in isaiah 53 verses
[43:14] 1 through 10 i think we could do this of
[43:16] our father i think he would
[43:17] appreciate his word amen
[43:22] isaiah chapter 53 verse 1 who have
[43:25] believed
[43:26] our report and to whom is the arm of the
[43:29] lord revealed
[43:31] for he shall grow up before
[43:35] him as a tender plant and as a root out
[43:38] of the dry ground
[43:40] he have no form or commonness and when
[43:42] we shall see him there is no beauty that
[43:44] we should desire him
[43:47] he is despised and rejected of men
[43:50] a man of sorrows acquainted with greece
[43:53] and we hid it as it were our faces from
[43:56] him
[43:58] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[44:00] surely he had borne our griefs and
[44:02] carried our sorrows
[44:03] yet we did esteem him stricken
[44:06] smitten of god and afflicted but he was
[44:09] wounded for us
[44:11] for our transgressions he was bruised
[44:14] for our iniquities
[44:15] the chastisement of our peace was upon
[44:17] him and with the stripes we are healed
[44:19] you talk about the amazing grace we sung
[44:21] about
[44:23] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[44:26] have turned everyone
[44:27] to his own way and the lord have laid
[44:30] upon him the iniquity
[44:32] of us all in other words when we go do
[44:34] our own thing that's iniquity
[44:36] same thing as lucifer did he was
[44:40] oppressed
[44:41] and he was afflicted yet he opened out
[44:43] his mouth amen
[44:45] he was brought as a lamb to the
[44:46] slaughter and as the sheep before the
[44:48] shearers is dumb so he opened
[44:50] not his mouth grace grace
[44:54] grace he was taken from prison and from
[44:57] the judgment
[44:57] who shall declare his generation for he
[44:59] was cut off of the land of the living
[45:02] for the transgressions of my people was
[45:03] he straightened
[45:05] for he made his grave with the wicked
[45:09] and with the rich in his death because
[45:12] he had done
[45:13] no violence neither was deceit in his
[45:15] mouth any deceit in his mouth
[45:18] yet it pleased the lord to bruise him
[45:22] that was for you and me
[45:26] he have put him to grief when thou shalt
[45:29] make a
[45:30] and when thou shall make a soul
[45:35] make his soul an offering for sin his
[45:38] soul became the offering for
[45:41] adam and eve's sin in the garden we were
[45:46] trapped
[45:46] right we were just born with this nature
[45:48] that they entered into
[45:53] and this offering became
[45:56] his soul became the offering for you and
[45:59] i
[46:00] he shall see his seed i just want to
[46:02] read that yet it please the lord to
[46:04] bruise him
[46:05] he have put him to grief when thou shalt
[46:07] make his soul
[46:08] in offering for sin he shall see his
[46:12] seed that's you and i he shall prolong
[46:15] his days
[46:15] and the pleasure of the lord shall
[46:17] prosper in
[46:18] his hand we are the seed of god
[46:22] amen we are the seed
[46:26] of grace jesus
[46:29] became the very expression of his father
[46:32] full of grace and truth grace
[46:35] was abundantly manifested in the life of
[46:39] jesus christ
[46:41] and this grace gave an opportunity for
[46:43] everybody to change
[46:45] which is a a an opportunity to grow
[46:48] one of the first things that came out of
[46:50] brother ron's mouth
[46:52] when he was leading i don't know if be
[46:55] right at the beginning of the worship
[46:56] talking about an opportunity to worship
[46:58] the lord amen
[47:00] we have such an opportunity all the time
[47:04] i wonder if we if we just didn't take
[47:06] advantage more of
[47:07] of worshipping the lord more
[47:10] he would inhabit us more he would
[47:14] he would be faithful to his word because
[47:15] we're following the steps of his word
[47:17] amen
[47:21] brother branham says if you want to know
[47:23] who god really is
[47:25] you'll know him only through jesus
[47:27] christ
[47:29] matthew chapter 11 verse 27 jesus said
[47:32] all things
[47:34] are delivered unto me of my father and
[47:37] no man knoweth the son but the father
[47:39] neither knoweth any man the father saved
[47:42] the son
[47:43] and this is where we come in and he
[47:47] to whomsoever the son will reveal him
[47:51] so if we're going to know god we've got
[47:52] to know through the revelation that
[47:54] jesus christ gives us
[47:56] that's right brother man says all that
[47:59] was in god he poured
[48:00] in to christ and all that was in christ
[48:04] he poured into you and i yes
[48:07] now we're just like jesus
[48:11] just like jesus was just like the father
[48:15] as the father gave grace for his son
[48:17] jesus to grow
[48:18] jesus manifested that same grace
[48:21] towards others those same attributes
[48:24] that was in the father
[48:25] at the beginning when there was no sin
[48:27] when there was no world
[48:29] there was attributes in there and there
[48:31] were attributes of grace and he waited
[48:33] so long to
[48:34] express them and when jesus
[48:37] was manifested in the flesh we began to
[48:40] see that
[48:41] god was full of grace full of grace
[48:45] jesus was the very seed of god matured
[48:49] and manifested and he gave this same
[48:52] grace
[48:52] to his disciples to grow he chose them
[48:56] and they were just
[48:57] so full of sin and and and and yet
[49:00] he gave them grace to grow look at
[49:02] matthew
[49:03] he was just sitting at the seat of
[49:05] customs look at
[49:07] saul he was just he was on his his
[49:10] his high thinking his horse of high
[49:12] thinking thinking that he was
[49:14] something and he was so proud he just
[49:17] was compete with everybody
[49:18] and yet god gave that man grace to grow
[49:23] come on can you say amen we ought to be
[49:25] the most thankful people
[49:26] in the whole world that god gave us
[49:28] grace to grow
[49:33] we also are the seed of god
[49:36] that has received grace to grow amen and
[49:39] as we mature in christ
[49:41] we begin to manifest the same grace
[49:45] and eventually become the very
[49:47] expression of our heavenly father
[49:50] before there was ever a world yes think
[49:52] about it
[49:53] he's taken us back to where he was
[49:58] this is going to be a little bit
[49:59] different sermon about grace today
[50:03] as the word becomes flesh and you and i
[50:05] it will be full of grace and truth
[50:09] because jesus christ is the same
[50:10] yesterday today and forever
[50:14] we are an expression that's what this
[50:16] every seed brings forth of its own kind
[50:18] we will be like christ
[50:21] now before the seed is matured still a
[50:24] seed
[50:24] but before it's matured it will always
[50:27] want to take out the sword
[50:28] and cut the wrong things just like peter
[50:32] did
[50:33] peter not having enough power to stay
[50:36] with christ during his trial right
[50:38] it was just all coming at him at once
[50:40] you know the satan was coming in like a
[50:42] flood
[50:44] and he just denied him deny he knew him
[50:50] but god's grace was still with peter
[50:54] he gave him grace to grow he didn't call
[50:58] peter out on the spot and said
[51:00] you you changed rate this sucker i'm
[51:02] just i wouldn't i should have never
[51:03] chose you
[51:04] right right that's good but some reason
[51:08] we feel we're the vengeance of god or
[51:11] something
[51:13] i'm telling you jesus christ is full of
[51:15] grace
[51:16] he's full of grace today amen
[51:22] ephesians chapter 2 verse 4 god
[51:25] is rich in mercy
[51:29] for his great love we're with he loved
[51:32] us
[51:33] i'm so glad that god hasn't stopped
[51:36] loving us
[51:39] even when we were dead in sins have
[51:42] quickened us together
[51:44] he changed our nature that quickening it
[51:46] changed our nature
[51:48] by grace are you saved grace doesn't
[51:52] stop with us that's the thing that satan
[51:54] has plagued over the the world
[51:58] as far as uh a carnal believing what
[52:01] grace is for it
[52:02] it just it it saved me and that's all
[52:04] that matters
[52:08] as god wanted to express his amazing
[52:12] attributes of forgiveness of mercy
[52:15] and grace he has long to see those same
[52:19] amazing attributes being expressed
[52:22] through his children through his seed
[52:26] it didn't stop with us it continues out
[52:29] with us
[52:31] because god in us is the same as god
[52:34] that was in jesus
[52:35] name and have raised us
[52:38] up together and
[52:42] now we're not sitting in the carnality
[52:45] of the of the bible we're sitting
[52:48] in a heavenly realm together
[52:52] together when we get to heaven it's
[52:55] going to be together
[52:56] there won't be any of this it's going to
[52:59] be together
[53:03] i'm longing for that day that
[53:06] in the ages to come he might
[53:10] show the ages to come we're in those
[53:13] ages right now
[53:14] we're in those ages to come that he
[53:16] might show the exceeding
[53:18] riches of his grace in his kindness
[53:21] towards us through christ
[53:25] jesus exceeding
[53:28] riches yes that's
[53:31] that means to pass or
[53:34] throw beyond the usual mark
[53:38] in other words i did not deserve this
[53:42] he threw it beyond the angels amen he
[53:45] threw it beyond heaven
[53:48] and he he conned and sent it to men of
[53:50] low estate
[53:52] he lifted us up into a heavenly place
[53:54] with him that we could be with him
[53:56] because he wasn't coming to live down
[53:59] here in our muck
[54:00] right now we will meet him in the air
[54:05] for by grace are you saved amen and it's
[54:09] through faith
[54:10] we've got to believe it we can't be
[54:13] saved without believing it
[54:15] and that not of yourselves it is the
[54:17] gift of god not of works lest any man
[54:19] should boast no man will be able to say
[54:24] i did this i did that
[54:27] and it merited what god offered
[54:33] i love verse 10 because
[54:36] if i could just get us to have a
[54:39] revelation of this verse here
[54:41] for we are his workmanship
[54:45] created in christ jesus onto
[54:49] good works not
[54:52] stopping not just stopping we got
[54:55] salvation
[54:56] but just go on now and live our lives
[54:58] now we've been created in christ jesus
[55:00] unto good works
[55:02] which god have before the foundation of
[55:05] the world before
[55:06] ordained that we would walk in them
[55:12] now we got to just determine what is
[55:14] that good works are we talking about
[55:20] god not only wanted to show his grace
[55:23] and his kindness
[55:24] towards us through jesus christ but he
[55:26] also wanted us to show that same
[55:29] grace towards others
[55:33] we were ordained before the foundation
[55:35] in the world
[55:36] to walk in good graces expressing grace
[55:40] full of grace towards others how will
[55:42] the world ever see
[55:43] jesus if they don't see him in jew
[55:51] he saved us he redeemed us back
[55:55] he bought us with the price of his own
[55:58] blood that we don't even own herself
[56:00] anymore
[56:02] i wish we had a revelation of that one
[56:04] amen
[56:06] can you imagine going and buying a brand
[56:08] new car
[56:10] paying cash for it brother mark getting
[56:12] a new equinox is that what you have
[56:15] trained off the lot and you're driving
[56:18] by
[56:19] you're driving at home an hour after you
[56:21] get home
[56:22] they come by and they pick it up and
[56:24] they take it back to sell to somebody
[56:26] else
[56:28] i've got the deed i bought it it's right
[56:30] here
[56:32] well no no i want it we would fight
[56:34] tooth and nail
[56:35] because we bought it
[56:38] why are we fighting tooth and nail when
[56:40] god wants to use our life to show grace
[56:43] to somebody
[56:44] but we say no i'm not going to do it
[56:50] we belong to christ we have become his
[56:53] workmanship
[56:55] we start doing the things he wants we
[56:57] start acting the way he wants
[56:59] and he created us in christ right
[57:03] he created us in christ
[57:09] paul said it's not me anymore
[57:12] but the life that i now live in the
[57:13] flesh i live by the faith and son of god
[57:16] so now we begin to do as he does
[57:19] we're just another vessel if we all
[57:22] stood up and jesus came and he
[57:24] stepped inside of every one of us we'd
[57:26] end up acting the same way
[57:29] we really would we one of us still may
[57:33] be a carpenter one stone may be uh
[57:35] this or that a housewife but i'm telling
[57:37] you we still act the same way
[57:42] because it's christ that liveth in me
[57:43] amen and he created us and he has
[57:46] created us
[57:47] onto good works jesus said the
[57:51] the works that i do shall you do also in
[57:53] greater works
[57:55] that uh you shall do because i go to my
[57:57] father and i'm leaving you here to do
[57:59] them
[57:59] right amen so we're going to do the
[58:02] works of christ now the works of christ
[58:04] were full of grace
[58:09] that's something we all can do
[58:13] the word that was made flesh in jesus
[58:15] christ was full of grace
[58:16] and the living word today inside of us
[58:18] will be full of grace
[58:20] something that we maybe don't exercise
[58:23] very much
[58:24] something we don't think about sometimes
[58:26] very much
[58:27] something we just think is is uh not
[58:30] that big a deal
[58:31] as if grace stopped with you
[58:37] usually people that are judgmental grace
[58:39] stops with them
[58:42] but if you're not being judgmental
[58:44] towards other that's
[58:45] you're full of grace
[58:49] god gives grace for his children to grow
[58:52] and god is no respecter of persons
[58:55] he will abundantly pardon whosoever will
[58:58] just say lord
[58:59] i need you i'm a sinner and i need your
[59:01] grace come into my life lord
[59:04] and he will because he's no respecter of
[59:06] persons
[59:09] he will give every man grace to grow
[59:13] grace is like a time period
[59:18] in which god has allowed it for us
[59:21] to get things right amen to make things
[59:25] right
[59:25] that's what grace is yes
[59:29] and i'll tell you if it wasn't for the
[59:30] grace of god i wouldn't be here today
[59:40] i'd like to say that there are our men
[59:44] and women who are much more
[59:47] worthy than i
[59:51] but when it comes
[59:55] to worthiness
[59:59] none are worthy none are right
[1:00:02] none are righteous holy if it wasn't for
[1:00:05] the grace of god
[1:00:06] none of us could stand in this hour none
[1:00:09] of us
[1:00:14] but the devil would like us to get down
[1:00:15] here and just start showing
[1:00:17] who's got the bigger problems
[1:00:20] the bigger faults the bigger sins and
[1:00:22] before you know it we start exercising
[1:00:24] the greatness who's the greatest
[1:00:26] to be among us oh we need a jesus to
[1:00:29] come by
[1:00:29] and say let him that's greatest let him
[1:00:31] be the servant among you
[1:00:33] let him get down and wash the feet we
[1:00:35] need jesus here
[1:00:39] the majority of the human race will not
[1:00:41] benefit from the grace that god has
[1:00:42] given them
[1:00:44] they will spurn it they will waste
[1:00:47] precious
[1:00:48] time getting things right in their life
[1:00:53] they will ignore it they're too proud to
[1:00:56] think
[1:00:59] that they're a wretched sinner
[1:01:02] they're too proud to think that their
[1:01:04] nature is that bad
[1:01:06] that they need to do something about it
[1:01:10] brother branham taught us that a pardon
[1:01:13] is not a pardon
[1:01:14] unless it's received as a pardon
[1:01:18] so we have in order to receive it you
[1:01:20] gotta you gotta feel you gotta realize
[1:01:22] you're locked up
[1:01:24] that you're in prison with the devil
[1:01:26] john 3 16 for god so loved the world
[1:01:29] that he gave his only begotten son
[1:01:31] that whosoever believeth on him should
[1:01:33] not perish but have
[1:01:34] everlasting life amen for god sent
[1:01:38] not his son into the world to condemn it
[1:01:42] but that the world through him might be
[1:01:44] saved
[1:01:45] yes a time period a man
[1:01:49] that got a time period we don't know how
[1:01:52] long we're going to live but as the tree
[1:01:54] falls that's where it lies it can't
[1:01:55] change
[1:01:56] it cannot change after death
[1:01:59] everything that's determined for
[1:02:01] eternity is already done down here the
[1:02:03] only thing the white throne judgment
[1:02:04] does
[1:02:05] is tell us what what happened down here
[1:02:08] come on he that believeth on him
[1:02:12] is not condemned it's all you gotta do
[1:02:15] is believe
[1:02:16] but he that believeth not is condemned
[1:02:19] already
[1:02:20] because he have not believed in the name
[1:02:22] of the only begotten
[1:02:24] of the son of god so you see the
[1:02:26] majority of the people
[1:02:27] will not benefit from god's grace the
[1:02:29] bible says straight as the gate narrows
[1:02:31] away and
[1:02:32] that leads to life and few be that
[1:02:34] findeth and and broad is the way why
[1:02:35] does the
[1:02:36] least destruction and many many many
[1:02:38] many going there at
[1:02:41] yet the grace was for the world amen
[1:02:44] the pardon was available to everybody
[1:02:47] but only those who admitted their
[1:02:49] condition
[1:02:52] that repented that forsook their ways
[1:02:55] they were the ones that were abundantly
[1:02:57] pardoned
[1:02:59] and this is the only formula to becoming
[1:03:02] born again
[1:03:05] god hands out grace to grow into a
[1:03:07] mature
[1:03:08] son and daughter of god he gives us
[1:03:10] grace to grow
[1:03:12] we've all tasted that the lord is good
[1:03:14] we've all tasted the grace of god and
[1:03:16] today we're
[1:03:17] we're here as as testimonies of god's
[1:03:19] grace amen
[1:03:21] there had been traces throughout our
[1:03:23] life even before we knew god
[1:03:26] we could see traces of grace
[1:03:29] but you know none of us really met grace
[1:03:32] until we
[1:03:32] got salvation that's when we met grace
[1:03:35] face to face
[1:03:36] we'd received grace in a way that we've
[1:03:38] never experienced before
[1:03:41] it was unmerited grace
[1:03:44] wasn't anything that we could do at that
[1:03:46] time
[1:03:48] god didn't want us boasting
[1:03:51] a human nature is proud and it wants to
[1:03:55] oh yeah and i have something to do with
[1:03:57] it
[1:03:59] always wants to get that little thing in
[1:04:01] there i burnt so many candles
[1:04:05] i did all these deeds
[1:04:09] look at me god says i don't want anybody
[1:04:13] in heaven like that
[1:04:15] somebody that don't realize that they
[1:04:17] were lost
[1:04:18] and undone and had such an evil selfish
[1:04:21] nature
[1:04:21] and they don't want to even come to
[1:04:23] grips with that
[1:04:26] you don't want anybody boasting amen
[1:04:32] don't get quiet on me
[1:04:36] we did not go hunting for god
[1:04:40] he came hunting for us john 15 verse 16
[1:04:43] ye have not chosen me but i have chosen
[1:04:46] you
[1:04:47] and have ordained you that you should go
[1:04:49] and bring forth fruit
[1:04:51] and that your fruit should remain
[1:04:55] in other words don't stop amen
[1:04:59] that whatsoever you ask in the father's
[1:05:01] name he will give it to you
[1:05:04] for we are his workmanship created in
[1:05:07] christ jesus
[1:05:08] unto good works and god wants us to
[1:05:10] continue those good works
[1:05:17] to continue them
[1:05:20] we've all been blessed with god's grace
[1:05:24] but let us this morning be courageous
[1:05:27] enough to answer this question
[1:05:29] how amazing is god's grace to you
[1:05:35] how amazing is god's grace to you amen
[1:05:39] grace saved us but we know it doesn't
[1:05:41] stop there
[1:05:44] is it amazing enough to be full of grace
[1:05:51] is it amazing enough for you to be full
[1:05:53] of grace
[1:05:55] [Music]
[1:05:56] is it amazing enough to you to express
[1:05:58] grace to others
[1:06:00] is it amazing enough to provide others
[1:06:02] with time
[1:06:04] to get things right when they're not
[1:06:05] right or do you want to cut them off
[1:06:09] amen how amazing is grace to you
[1:06:14] grace allowed us time to get things
[1:06:17] right
[1:06:18] grace allowed us time to grow
[1:06:23] to become more mature
[1:06:26] and this is a great purpose of grace it
[1:06:29] is a great
[1:06:29] purpose of grace so my question to you
[1:06:32] is grace amazing
[1:06:34] enough to be gracious towards others
[1:06:37] to be a believer today that people can
[1:06:40] look at
[1:06:40] and say he's full of grace
[1:06:45] grace is given to us that we might grow
[1:06:52] but it's also given to us that we might
[1:06:54] be the express
[1:06:56] image of the almighty god who is full of
[1:06:59] grace
[1:07:03] i've always felt indebted to god and
[1:07:05] you've heard that many times from this
[1:07:07] pulpit
[1:07:10] indebted because of his amazing grace
[1:07:14] and to me it is that indebtedness in our
[1:07:18] lives
[1:07:19] that fuels personal growth
[1:07:24] and it distributes god's grace to others
[1:07:29] without feeling that indebtedness
[1:07:32] i don't need to i don't know
[1:07:41] just because a man receives the grace of
[1:07:43] god in his life it doesn't mean he feels
[1:07:45] greatly indebted
[1:07:51] or more in love with god
[1:07:54] you can receive the grace of god at your
[1:07:56] life and not even love god
[1:08:01] it is the truth matthew chapter 18 verse
[1:08:05] 21
[1:08:08] do you love the word amen i love the
[1:08:11] word
[1:08:13] i don't know where i'd be without it
[1:08:19] then came peter to him
[1:08:22] to jesus and said lord how often
[1:08:26] should my brother sin against me and i
[1:08:29] forgive him
[1:08:31] is seven times complete enough
[1:08:34] is seven times complete enough and jesus
[1:08:38] said unto him
[1:08:39] i say not unto thee until seven times it
[1:08:42] is not enough
[1:08:44] but if you want to talk about completion
[1:08:46] until seven times
[1:08:48] or seventy times seven get the idea
[1:08:51] peter
[1:08:55] peter you don't
[1:08:58] know my nature yet
[1:09:02] you think my nature is i only have to
[1:09:04] forgive somebody a little bit
[1:09:09] but i have ordained you to go on
[1:09:12] to good works you're going
[1:09:16] to be the workmanship of my hands i'm
[1:09:18] going to create in you
[1:09:20] the same nature that i have so you can
[1:09:22] do the same works that i do
[1:09:25] because it is not the work of god to
[1:09:28] forgive somebody only seven
[1:09:30] times that may be your works
[1:09:34] yes that may be your thoughts of god's
[1:09:36] nature but that is
[1:09:37] not god's nature amen
[1:09:42] here is the story of a man who rejoiced
[1:09:45] and believed in the grace and mercy of
[1:09:47] god for his life
[1:09:48] but didn't believe that he needed that
[1:09:50] same nature to be manifested
[1:09:53] through his life towards others
[1:09:57] in other words you you got this attitude
[1:10:00] of believing in grace one way towards
[1:10:02] god
[1:10:03] but then you have a different attitude
[1:10:05] with that same grace towards somebody
[1:10:07] else
[1:10:09] like we're not quite full of grace
[1:10:13] he rejoiced he rejoiced just like
[1:10:17] everyone else rejoices when they receive
[1:10:19] grace but because his nature
[1:10:21] never changed he was too selfish
[1:10:24] to forgive other people they're wrong oh
[1:10:30] i want that to sink in
[1:10:33] and it's hard in this age for people to
[1:10:35] manifest
[1:10:36] a life full of grace and mercy it's
[1:10:39] slayer to see a spirit so strong
[1:10:42] they're in need of nothing it's rights
[1:10:44] the spirit of the colonel church
[1:10:46] has become so unthankful
[1:10:50] one of the great attributes that's being
[1:10:52] expressed by the carnal church
[1:10:54] is unthankful and all because their own
[1:10:58] iniquity is out of control
[1:11:01] the love of many is waxing cold
[1:11:04] let's look at verse 23 therefore is the
[1:11:07] kingdom of heaven
[1:11:08] likened unto a certain king
[1:11:12] which would take account of his servants
[1:11:15] and when he had begun to reckon one was
[1:11:17] brought unto him that
[1:11:18] owed him ten thousand
[1:11:21] talents that's a lot
[1:11:27] but for as much as he had not to pay
[1:11:30] his lord commanded him to be sold and
[1:11:33] his wife
[1:11:34] and his children and all that he had and
[1:11:37] payment to be made
[1:11:38] right now
[1:11:42] and the servant now notice this is the
[1:11:45] kingdom of heaven he's likened it to the
[1:11:47] kingdom of heaven
[1:11:49] the servant therefore fell down and
[1:11:51] worshiped him saying
[1:11:53] lord have patience with me
[1:11:56] and i will pay thee all amen
[1:12:00] he was seeking the mercies of god amen
[1:12:04] now remember he asked for patience what
[1:12:07] is patience
[1:12:08] he was asking for grace a time to get
[1:12:11] things right
[1:12:15] then the lord of that servant was moved
[1:12:18] with compassion
[1:12:20] imagine what a humble and contrite
[1:12:22] spirit would do for the lord
[1:12:26] move with compassion and lose him and
[1:12:28] forgave him
[1:12:30] the debt didn't say okay start paying it
[1:12:32] he forgave
[1:12:33] him the debt god who is rich
[1:12:37] in mercy jesus christ is
[1:12:40] full of grace
[1:12:43] i want you to notice the attitude of
[1:12:45] this servant this
[1:12:47] this recipient of god's grace his life
[1:12:51] began to express just how amazing
[1:12:54] he thought god's grace was
[1:12:57] you know when you don't show the same
[1:12:59] grace god gives you you belittle his
[1:13:02] grace
[1:13:04] i know you don't want to hear it and you
[1:13:05] don't believe it but it's the truth
[1:13:09] but the same servant went out
[1:13:12] and found one of his fellow servants
[1:13:14] which owed him
[1:13:16] a hundred pence and he laid
[1:13:19] hands on him and he took him by the
[1:13:22] throat
[1:13:25] he must have meant business saying
[1:13:28] pay me that thou owest
[1:13:33] and the fellow servant fell down and his
[1:13:35] fellow servant
[1:13:36] fell down at his feet and besought him
[1:13:38] the same thing
[1:13:39] have patience with me and i will pay the
[1:13:42] all
[1:13:44] now look at the difference and he would
[1:13:47] not and he would not
[1:13:52] god has put in our hands the ability to
[1:13:55] love to hate
[1:13:56] to forgive to hold grudges to be
[1:13:59] graceful not to be graceful
[1:14:01] that's all in our power don't don't tell
[1:14:03] me the devil made you do it and
[1:14:05] that that that's that
[1:14:12] so when his fellow servants
[1:14:15] his other brothers and sisters saw what
[1:14:19] was done they were very sorry
[1:14:22] and came and told unto their lord
[1:14:26] all that was done and then his lord
[1:14:29] after that he had called him said unto
[1:14:32] him
[1:14:32] o thou wicked servant well here was
[1:14:36] at one time god was moved with
[1:14:39] compassion and just gave him grace
[1:14:42] but because of his attitude how he
[1:14:45] expressed grace to others he now became
[1:14:49] a wicked servant in the sight of god
[1:14:54] see your attitude really determines how
[1:14:56] god thinks about you
[1:14:58] not how you feel about god loving you
[1:15:04] notice this servant didn't turn around
[1:15:05] and say wait a minute you gave me grace
[1:15:07] to you
[1:15:07] i i you had compassion on me what do you
[1:15:09] do and call me wicked now
[1:15:11] because he knew he was wrong something
[1:15:14] inside of him
[1:15:15] told him he was wrong amen oh
[1:15:18] oh thou wicked servant i forgave all
[1:15:22] that debt because you desired me too
[1:15:28] now look at the expectation that god has
[1:15:30] from every one of us
[1:15:32] should us not thou also have had
[1:15:34] compassion
[1:15:35] on thy fellow brother and sister
[1:15:39] even as i had pity on thee
[1:15:42] amen sure is not my grace been amazing
[1:15:45] enough to have compassion on others
[1:15:47] to to forgive others
[1:15:50] now this wicked servant i went and did
[1:15:52] the math
[1:15:55] he owed 270 today's
[1:15:59] today's he would owe 271
[1:16:03] million dollars
[1:16:07] and his lord just forgave him
[1:16:11] but he came across a person who owed him
[1:16:14] just
[1:16:14] one dollar one dollar
[1:16:18] and he had such an ungracious
[1:16:22] attitude
[1:16:25] i just don't think that sits good with
[1:16:27] god do you
[1:16:30] and i'll tell you there you know there
[1:16:31] ain't a person in here
[1:16:33] a person in our world the life that we
[1:16:35] live in outside these buildings
[1:16:37] i don't care what wrong they do to us
[1:16:39] can compare
[1:16:40] with the debt that we owe god he
[1:16:43] forgives us
[1:16:43] daily amen amen his mercies are new
[1:16:46] every day
[1:16:48] god is full of grace who are we to say
[1:16:50] anything to anybody that does this any
[1:16:52] harm
[1:16:54] nothing
[1:16:58] but when we lift ourselves up to begin
[1:17:02] to be a judge over one dollar
[1:17:07] one little baby little thing that just
[1:17:09] wasn't
[1:17:10] he didn't he did he wore his his tie was
[1:17:13] too
[1:17:14] short come on
[1:17:20] let's hold it against him you're right
[1:17:23] that's
[1:17:24] that's not god that's the other god
[1:17:31] that's the other other guy trying to
[1:17:33] trick us
[1:17:36] verse 34 and his lord was wroth
[1:17:39] and delivered him to the tormentors till
[1:17:42] he should pay
[1:17:42] all that was due unto him so at one time
[1:17:45] when he received this amazing grace
[1:17:48] yes his name was taken out of the book
[1:17:51] of life
[1:17:58] he sent him back to prison and said
[1:18:00] you're going to pay back every
[1:18:02] 271 million dollars that you owe me
[1:18:05] well you knew he's going to rot in
[1:18:06] prison
[1:18:08] think about this god changes his
[1:18:11] attitude when you do
[1:18:13] when you're on your knees saying god i
[1:18:15] need your mercy i need your grace
[1:18:17] god will abundantly pardon but you walk
[1:18:19] up from there go through a little
[1:18:20] something somebody steps on your toe and
[1:18:22] all of a sudden you want to call down
[1:18:24] fire
[1:18:34] with your attitude changing god's
[1:18:36] attitude changes towards you
[1:18:46] god's grace stopped with this wicked
[1:18:50] servant
[1:18:53] think about that i don't want god's
[1:18:56] grace to stop with me
[1:18:59] i know the only chance i got is to let
[1:19:02] him
[1:19:03] live his life through me yes amen and
[1:19:06] when he does it
[1:19:07] he'll show mercy on who he wants to show
[1:19:09] mercy he'll be gracious to me once
[1:19:10] i'll tell you he is full of grace
[1:19:14] i don't want anybody looking at my life
[1:19:16] and say that was you were not very
[1:19:17] gracious
[1:19:20] i'd rather be guilty i always remember
[1:19:22] brother johnson brother brother
[1:19:24] bruce may remember he always says i want
[1:19:27] i'd rather be guilty of keeping the door
[1:19:28] open for somebody
[1:19:29] right then closing it on somebody right
[1:19:32] amen
[1:19:33] god give me that grace amen
[1:19:36] grace was not given to remain
[1:19:39] in the same nature think about that
[1:19:42] grace saves us
[1:19:43] but grace was never given to us to
[1:19:45] remain in the same nature that we have
[1:19:48] it was given to us as a space of time
[1:19:51] to change our nature and our nature is
[1:19:55] only going to change when we want to
[1:19:58] just this example you come up to the
[1:20:00] altar and you say god
[1:20:01] i need forgiveness i need your grace
[1:20:03] come and and
[1:20:04] please forgive me take this this guilt
[1:20:06] away from me and set me free and god
[1:20:08] comes and he blesses you
[1:20:10] amen and as soon as your attitude
[1:20:12] changes
[1:20:14] things begin to change in your life good
[1:20:16] or bad but if you would continue to come
[1:20:19] to god
[1:20:20] and say god change my nature i want to
[1:20:22] be more like you
[1:20:23] i i i thank you for helping me with that
[1:20:26] what you did for me there i know you can
[1:20:27] do with me for there
[1:20:28] and my my life i just want to be just
[1:20:30] like you and if you keep
[1:20:32] that humble desire in your life god will
[1:20:34] change you
[1:20:35] all things will become new in your life
[1:20:38] it's a promise of god
[1:20:40] amen god wants his grace to continue
[1:20:44] being expressed through his seed
[1:20:48] because we are the seed of god every
[1:20:50] seed brings forth of us
[1:20:51] of its own kind verse 35 so likewise
[1:20:54] shall my heavenly father
[1:20:56] do also unto you if you from your heart
[1:21:00] not your lips not your head
[1:21:04] but your heart where your love is at
[1:21:07] right
[1:21:08] if you from your heart forgive not
[1:21:10] everyone his brother
[1:21:12] their trespasses
[1:21:16] don't you feel like you know the lord
[1:21:20] you see these scriptures and it's like
[1:21:22] this is the god i know because this is
[1:21:24] the god
[1:21:24] who revealed to me who he was when he
[1:21:27] saved me when he had mercy on me
[1:21:30] it's okay for him to expect that same
[1:21:33] devotion and a commitment out of me
[1:21:36] towards others
[1:21:39] and if you let god have his way in your
[1:21:41] life he'll turn your world upside down
[1:21:46] god is expressing that his seed is
[1:21:50] been ordained to manifest his nature
[1:21:54] should is thou not have had compassion
[1:21:57] on thy fellow servant so next time you
[1:22:00] have a problem with somebody
[1:22:02] and you have these thoughts going on in
[1:22:04] your head
[1:22:05] i want you to remember the words of
[1:22:06] jesus
[1:22:08] should has not thou had compassion
[1:22:11] on thy fellow servant
[1:22:14] i want to be reminded by god when i get
[1:22:17] wrong thoughts
[1:22:18] yes if we're not careful to maintain
[1:22:22] these good works of grace
[1:22:25] god's compassion and god's mercy god
[1:22:28] will eventually ask
[1:22:29] us to give an account of our works
[1:22:34] if we're not careful to maintain good
[1:22:36] works we can lose
[1:22:37] the vision of what god had actually done
[1:22:40] for us at calvary
[1:22:42] if we're not careful to keep building up
[1:22:44] his nature
[1:22:45] inside of us if we're not careful to
[1:22:47] keep manifesting more of his grace
[1:22:50] we're going to lose the complete
[1:22:54] meaning of calvary now you may not
[1:22:58] lose the partial meaning of calvary
[1:23:03] but you'll lose the complete meaning
[1:23:06] 2 peter chapter 1 verse 9 says but he
[1:23:09] that lack of these
[1:23:10] things is blind and cannot see
[1:23:14] afar off and have forgotten
[1:23:17] that he was purged from his old
[1:23:20] sins that's exactly what this man had
[1:23:23] happened he was forgiven he went away
[1:23:26] rejoicing
[1:23:27] he had 271 utah that was a testimony in
[1:23:30] church he could
[1:23:30] you know god just i just i don't know
[1:23:32] that money anymore i'm i'm set free
[1:23:35] right but he forgot about that one
[1:23:38] he was reminded that somebody owed him
[1:23:40] something
[1:23:43] he forgot it he forgot that he was
[1:23:46] purged
[1:23:48] forgiven amen he
[1:23:51] lacketh he that lacketh these things
[1:23:53] like what are these things
[1:23:55] the good works of christ faith
[1:23:57] temperance patience
[1:23:58] kind kindness all these things if we
[1:24:02] lack the living word of god
[1:24:05] right right we can forget that we were
[1:24:08] even purged
[1:24:11] don't ever lose focus of the complete
[1:24:14] meaning of calvary paying off your debt
[1:24:18] was not the complete meaning of calvary
[1:24:22] it is a vital and crucial part but it's
[1:24:25] far
[1:24:25] from the complete meaning of calvary
[1:24:28] cavalry was to lead us to a complete
[1:24:30] nature change
[1:24:32] where all things become new all things
[1:24:34] become god
[1:24:36] everything about our old selfish nature
[1:24:40] is passed away
[1:24:43] holding grudges passed away respective
[1:24:47] persons passed away
[1:24:48] amen not caring passed away
[1:24:52] not being merciful pass away not wanting
[1:24:55] to forgive pass away
[1:24:56] not you know struggling with with with
[1:24:59] being thankful passed away
[1:25:03] it's gone because you are the seed of
[1:25:06] god and you are manifesting christ
[1:25:08] now shouldn't be hard for you to
[1:25:10] manifest christ
[1:25:12] if it is don't blame it on your
[1:25:14] circumstance
[1:25:16] don't blame it on those around you don't
[1:25:17] blame it on how people make you feel
[1:25:21] i'm gonna tell you one thing brother
[1:25:22] mark has no control
[1:25:24] over the way i feel like i don't care
[1:25:26] what he does to me
[1:25:30] i am not going to let anybody control me
[1:25:32] outside of god
[1:25:36] now he may step on my toe he may make me
[1:25:39] cry for a few
[1:25:40] minutes
[1:25:43] that's normal you ever just run into
[1:25:45] something you go ow
[1:25:46] normal right but you don't sit there for
[1:25:49] five days going ou wow
[1:25:55] well he pushed me into it he stepped on
[1:25:57] me
[1:26:00] full of grace amen full of grace turn
[1:26:03] with me to luke chapter 7
[1:26:05] verse 41.
[1:26:08] calvary led us to be just like jesus
[1:26:13] luke 7 verse 41 there was a certain
[1:26:16] creditor which had two debtors
[1:26:20] the one owed five hundred pence
[1:26:24] and the other fifty
[1:26:28] and when they had nothing to pay frankly
[1:26:30] forgave them both tell me therefore
[1:26:31] which of them will love
[1:26:33] him most
[1:26:37] jesus here is expecting a love
[1:26:41] in return for forgiveness we see that
[1:26:44] this is nature
[1:26:45] when he when when he forgives somebody
[1:26:47] he expects him to love him
[1:26:49] that's it it's none of this disgrace
[1:26:52] it's grace it wants to be recognized as
[1:26:55] the riches of god-giving
[1:26:59] it's terrible when somebody receives
[1:27:01] something and they're not thankful
[1:27:04] but god expects something out of this
[1:27:10] simon answered and said i suppose that
[1:27:12] he to whom
[1:27:14] he forgave most
[1:27:17] jesus answered him thou has rightly
[1:27:21] judged the situation
[1:27:24] love comes from a heart that's been
[1:27:27] forgiven
[1:27:30] and forgiveness comes from a heart that
[1:27:32] is learn
[1:27:33] how to feel
[1:27:36] in debt
[1:27:40] in other words if you walk around
[1:27:42] thinking you're not that bad at all
[1:27:45] you don't feel that much debt
[1:27:48] how are you going to love much
[1:27:52] i'd rather feel in debt so much lord i
[1:27:55] need you please forgive me
[1:27:56] i got a chance of loving god more
[1:28:00] her sins which are many
[1:28:04] are forgiven for she loved much
[1:28:08] but to whom little is forgiven
[1:28:11] the same loveth a little
[1:28:15] now we heard it from the creator's mouth
[1:28:22] the facts from the book
[1:28:25] do you want to be able to love more than
[1:28:27] you do
[1:28:29] here's the key take a good look at
[1:28:32] humbling yourself
[1:28:33] aware what you need from god
[1:28:38] try to discover a greater debt in your
[1:28:41] life
[1:28:43] i tell you i don't want others out
[1:28:45] loving me
[1:28:46] i don't want to be sitting in heaven
[1:28:48] with god and thinking look at all those
[1:28:50] people they're loving god more than me
[1:28:55] all you got to do is recognize how
[1:28:56] terrible you are amen
[1:28:58] how much you need him father forgive me
[1:29:02] and i'll tell you there'll be such a
[1:29:03] love that swells up inside of you
[1:29:05] you just want to worship him even if
[1:29:07] everybody else isn't
[1:29:11] that's right
[1:29:15] it was grace that saved a wretch like us
[1:29:20] it's going to be grace that takes us to
[1:29:21] the rapture
[1:29:25] we got to continue to build god has
[1:29:27] given us grace
[1:29:28] to grow take this time that that god has
[1:29:31] given you
[1:29:32] and grow grow don't don't use grace like
[1:29:36] a lot of people think grace is oh i need
[1:29:38] grace to forgive me when i do wrong
[1:29:40] i'm going to just keep going out there
[1:29:41] and doing what i want to it comes real
[1:29:43] bad and make the mess out of it and then
[1:29:44] i'm going to ask for grace
[1:29:45] no take this time grace is a time
[1:29:48] allowed
[1:29:49] to get your life closer to god to get
[1:29:50] things right
[1:29:53] this is the father's grace being
[1:29:55] bestowed upon us
[1:29:58] we're gonna need grace to grow we're
[1:30:00] gonna need more grace
[1:30:02] we all got the secret to get more grace
[1:30:04] right
[1:30:06] he giveth more grace to the humble
[1:30:09] humble more grace to grow i need more
[1:30:13] grace i'm running out of time
[1:30:16] peter said if these things be in you and
[1:30:18] abound they make you that you should be
[1:30:19] neither be
[1:30:20] barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge
[1:30:24] of our lord jesus christ
[1:30:27] many are called to this grace
[1:30:31] but few are chosen god has chosen us and
[1:30:35] ordained us
[1:30:36] the bible says that we should go and
[1:30:38] bring forth fruit and that our fruit
[1:30:40] should remain
[1:30:41] john 15 verse 8 says here is my father
[1:30:44] glorified
[1:30:45] that you bear much fruit and you shall
[1:30:48] be
[1:30:49] so shall ye be my disciples what kind of
[1:30:52] what kind of fruit
[1:30:57] hey men that's a right answer
[1:31:00] amen life in them you hold the words of
[1:31:03] life
[1:31:04] gracious words are full of life amen
[1:31:07] amen
[1:31:09] we're going to need grace for our lives
[1:31:14] i want to express more grace
[1:31:17] in my life i want to give opportunities
[1:31:19] we all have had most of us
[1:31:21] have had children if not we have played
[1:31:24] with children
[1:31:25] and sometimes the children do not do
[1:31:28] what
[1:31:29] we want them to do
[1:31:32] and but as a father as a mother you know
[1:31:35] that that child
[1:31:36] is going to grow up eventually
[1:31:40] not only when they're 35 but i i mean
[1:31:42] when they're when they're real
[1:31:44] little and um
[1:31:48] you as a father or a mother
[1:31:51] you understand the importance of grace
[1:31:55] it's needful for time to grow
[1:32:02] even in god's correction towards us
[1:32:06] it's full of grace amen there's nobody i
[1:32:09] know
[1:32:10] like god amen
[1:32:13] it's full of grace now when we get on
[1:32:15] the other side at the white throne
[1:32:16] judgment there will not be no grace
[1:32:18] there
[1:32:20] it's already done you're either on one
[1:32:22] side or the other
[1:32:26] but today we have a chance to grow in
[1:32:28] grace so take
[1:32:29] opportunity to grow and let god exercise
[1:32:32] his grace through through you if you can
[1:32:36] understand that through your by being a
[1:32:39] natural father and a mother
[1:32:40] it should be quite easy for you to
[1:32:42] understand that spiritually
[1:32:45] for your brothers and sisters in christ
[1:32:48] god is bringing the capstone of this
[1:32:52] building
[1:32:55] zechariah 4 7 says and he shall bring
[1:32:57] forth the headstone
[1:32:59] thereof with shoutings crying
[1:33:02] grace grace unto it
[1:33:05] that should be all that we want to
[1:33:07] express
[1:33:08] is grace grace god will take care of it
[1:33:12] the bible says my grace his grace is
[1:33:15] sufficient
[1:33:16] jesus said my grace is sufficient for
[1:33:19] thee amen
[1:33:19] his grace is all that we have need of
[1:33:22] yes
[1:33:24] last the very last verse in the whole
[1:33:28] bible the very last turn with me to the
[1:33:31] very last
[1:33:32] verse before we stand and have a word of
[1:33:35] prayer
[1:33:38] revelations chapter 22 verse 21
[1:33:41] how important is grace
[1:33:45] the grace of our lord jesus christ
[1:33:48] be with you all amen let's stand
[1:33:51] together
[1:33:53] amen
[1:33:59] amen let's just
[1:34:02] let's go to the lord in prayer i'm sure
[1:34:05] we all feel the same way just desiring
[1:34:08] more of the grace of god in our life
[1:34:12] he's been so good to us i'm just looking
[1:34:15] for an opportunity
[1:34:17] to express that grace to somebody amen
[1:34:20] heavenly father
[1:34:21] as we come to you today in prayer there
[1:34:23] is a thanksgiving in our heart because
[1:34:25] of
[1:34:26] the indebtedness that we feel lord we
[1:34:29] can't forget
[1:34:31] what you've done for us at calvary you
[1:34:33] paid a debt that we could not pay
[1:34:36] you didn't know it but you paid it
[1:34:38] freely for us
[1:34:40] what a great expression of your love
[1:34:44] and god we're on this side
[1:34:47] of this thought that you had before the
[1:34:51] foundation of the world
[1:34:52] where you wanted to express
[1:34:56] these attributes that you had
[1:35:00] there's a reason that you wanted to
[1:35:02] express them it wasn't to be some
[1:35:04] show-off or to act like you got
[1:35:07] something
[1:35:09] but you wanted to be loved back in a way
[1:35:11] that the angels couldn't love you
[1:35:15] loved back with
[1:35:19] from a condition of sin
[1:35:24] to be able to step out of that condition
[1:35:27] accept you as a savior as a redeemer
[1:35:32] and to be able to hear praises from the
[1:35:35] redeemed
[1:35:36] saying thank you jesus for saving my
[1:35:38] soul
[1:35:39] thank you for the grace that you've had
[1:35:42] in my life
[1:35:43] today thank you for the grace that you
[1:35:45] gave me yesterday amen thank you for
[1:35:47] helping me through
[1:35:49] all my tests and my trials for for
[1:35:52] providing a waving
[1:35:53] through lord the hardships your grace is
[1:35:55] always there
[1:35:57] we thank you for being full of grace
[1:36:00] lord as we approach you at this time
[1:36:02] we're we're asking
[1:36:03] lord that that same grace could now be
[1:36:06] manifested
[1:36:07] inside of each one of us lord that when
[1:36:10] the world looks at us
[1:36:12] they won't see us anymore but they'll
[1:36:14] see you in us
[1:36:15] full of grace expressing grace to them
[1:36:19] to situations lord that our conversation
[1:36:23] when we talk about
[1:36:24] others could also be full of grace
[1:36:27] oh god let us be a living testimony
[1:36:31] lord we don't want you to come back to
[1:36:33] us
[1:36:35] and say pay up because we were unwilling
[1:36:38] to consider
[1:36:39] what you've done for us when we talked
[1:36:41] about others
[1:36:43] oh god i know this isn't easy for our
[1:36:47] flesh
[1:36:48] but god we didn't come here for our
[1:36:50] flesh today we come here lord that we
