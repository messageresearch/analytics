[39:15] possible
[39:16] Jesus is
[39:20] here amen Let's Just Praise the Lord
[39:23] because he's here amen
[39:29] am just think he chose to be invisible
[39:32] all the
[39:33] time if he was if he was always in the
[39:37] form of someone you could see then you
[39:41] wouldn't need as much Faith you wouldn't
[39:42] need Faith but he wants us to believe
[39:46] amen
[39:48] well there a thinking about that thought
[39:51] that brother um Bruce made about life is
[39:54] full of Trials and then we die like uh
[39:58] so what's it all about it's amazing to
[40:02] me that God takes every one of our Lives
[40:04] that's full of Trials and he uses those
[40:07] as
[40:08] tools to build character his character
[40:11] inside of us and we know everybody the
[40:14] whole the world goes through trials but
[40:16] they don't get character they get bitter
[40:19] they get upset they blame God but to the
[40:21] believer they know God is working
[40:25] something inside of them amen and so
[40:28] it's a it's a paradox amen amen I say
[40:31] good morning to all of you God bless you
[40:33] it's so good to see sister Trina and
[40:35] brother Jonathan sister Gabrielle it's
[40:37] just seems like it's been a while and
[40:39] it's uh good to to have part of the
[40:41] family of God back amen if you would
[40:44] turn with me this morning we got two
[40:47] scripture readings one in Ephesians
[40:48] chapter 4 and then one in 1 Peter
[40:53] chapter
[40:55] 5 this morning we want to talk about
[40:57] about the office of a
[41:02] pastor this a couple years ago that I
[41:05] actually got the thought on this and I
[41:08] don't know what it was I just kind of I
[41:11] put it
[41:12] aside and then it just seemed like the
[41:14] Lord uh brought that thought to me and I
[41:17] went back and I thought yes I I did I
[41:20] did some some some notes on this and I
[41:25] just some thing I want to dig into is
[41:29] just the office of of a pastor and I
[41:31] want to I want to speak about our
[41:34] relationship I believe that we're
[41:36] spiritually connected in a very unique
[41:41] relationship amen before we begin
[41:43] reading let's look to the Lord in a word
[41:45] of prayer our heavenly father we want to
[41:48] thank you this morning that you've given
[41:50] us
[41:52] breath the Breath of
[41:54] Life strength and health to be here
[41:58] here Lord we thank you for giving us
[42:00] that that we could be in your house and
[42:04] we humbly pray that your presence would
[42:06] come in a very special way to every
[42:08] heart may they feel your presence may
[42:10] they know you're here and may you lift
[42:13] them up strengthen them and direct their
[42:16] lives Heavenly
[42:17] Father we ask that you would remember
[42:20] every need that would be among us Lord
[42:22] those that we're aware of those that
[42:24] were're not aware of amen and that you
[42:26] would come and bring victory for we ask
[42:31] these things in Jesus Christ's name amen
[42:35] amen Ephesians chapter 4 starting with
[42:37] verse number 11 and he gave some
[42:40] Apostles and some prophets and some
[42:42] evangelists and some pastors and
[42:45] teachers for the perfecting of the
[42:47] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[42:49] the edifying of the body of Christ till
[42:53] we all come into the unity of the faith
[42:57] and of the knowledge of the Son of God
[43:00] unto a perfect man unto the measure of
[43:03] the Statue of the fullness of
[43:05] Christ that we henceforth be no more
[43:09] children tossed to and fro carried about
[43:13] with every wind of Doctrine by the
[43:15] slight of men and the cunning craftiness
[43:19] whereby they lie in wait to dece that
[43:21] just sounds like the devil doesn't it am
[43:24] all right and then First Peter chapter 5
[43:27] we're going to read the first four
[43:28] verses
[43:30] there have you be seated the elders
[43:33] which are among you I
[43:36] exhort who am also an elder and a
[43:41] witness of the sufferings of Christ and
[43:44] also a partaker of the glory that shall
[43:47] be
[43:48] revealed feed the flock of God which is
[43:51] among you taking the oversight thereof
[43:55] not by constraint but willingly not by
[43:59] filthy lucer but of a ready mind neither
[44:03] as being Lords over God's Heritage but
[44:07] being examples to the flock and when the
[44:10] chief Shepherd shall
[44:12] appear ye shall receive a Crown of Glory
[44:15] that fadeth not away amen God bless you
[44:18] you may be seated love the
[44:20] scriptures amen first thing I want to
[44:22] talk about is God's order God has an
[44:24] order we remember when Jesus fed the
[44:28] 5,000 he had all the the the people sit
[44:31] down in groups of 50 I think it was and
[44:34] then uh he took one little lunch and he
[44:36] prayed over it and uh he handed it to
[44:40] his disciples and his disciples ended to
[44:42] hand it to the people so there was an
[44:44] order to how he did it
[44:46] amen 1 Corinthians 11:3 says but I would
[44:50] have you to know that the head of every
[44:54] man is Christ and the head of the woman
[44:59] is the man and the head of Christ is God
[45:03] so we see that there's even God's
[45:05] talking about a
[45:07] headship there's a a headship so to
[45:10] everything if there is no head it's it
[45:14] it it's it's either it's dead it's dead
[45:19] it you want to get a you want to kill a
[45:21] snake you don't want to chop off his
[45:22] tail he'll keep going right you got to
[45:25] get the head
[45:27] the Bible says that the spirit of the
[45:29] prophets is even subject to other
[45:32] prophets because God is not the author
[45:35] of confusion am so if someone doesn't
[45:38] take charge in a business it will turn
[45:40] into total chaos we've all work for
[45:43] places that just didn't seem to have it
[45:46] together if the head of a home doesn't
[45:48] take his position inside the home it'll
[45:50] become
[45:51] chaotic if a rest a restaurant doesn't
[45:54] have a manager in charge it's going to
[45:57] go down fast and if God doesn't have a
[46:00] pastor for us our lives can spiral out
[46:03] of his
[46:05] will and if God doesn't have a
[46:08] prophet then he would never then we
[46:10] would never be able to know the secrets
[46:12] of
[46:13] God so I want to take a look uh right
[46:17] now at at this at this Prophet God uses
[46:21] prophets to bring his message to the
[46:23] people I'm taking this from Amos 3:7
[46:27] it says surely the Lord God will do
[46:31] nothing but he revealeth his Secrets
[46:34] unto his servants the
[46:37] prophets that's just the order the way
[46:39] that God does things he's God he he he
[46:42] make up his own
[46:44] rules amen before God destroyed Sodom he
[46:48] revealed his secret to his prophet
[46:51] Abraham before God destroyed the
[46:54] prophets of ba he revealed his secret to
[46:56] his prophet elah before God destroyed
[46:59] Egypt he revealed his secret to the
[47:01] prophet Moses that's right amen and and
[47:05] when God introduced Jesus the uh he
[47:09] introduced him to the prophet John the
[47:11] Baptist he said Behold the Lamb of God
[47:13] that take away the sins of the world he
[47:16] must increase I must decrease amen so
[47:19] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[47:21] he reveal his Secrets unto his servants
[47:25] the prophets see a prophet is a Seer he
[47:28] sees things that everybody else does not
[47:32] see that's why he's a prophet God lifts
[47:35] him up in if I could say it like this in
[47:37] that office and he lifts them up shows
[47:39] them things he comes back and he tells
[47:41] the people and we just got a Bible full
[47:44] of examples of
[47:45] that Malachi 45 very important scripture
[47:49] here for us in the end times Malachi 45
[47:53] behold I send you Elijah the prophet
[47:56] before for the coming of the great and
[47:59] Dreadful day of the
[48:01] Lord now he's sending this Prophet
[48:05] before he burns the Earth with
[48:08] fire I I tell you this is not John the
[48:11] Baptist because that was not the great
[48:13] and Dreadful day of the Lord in fact
[48:15] when he showed up the Angels proclaimed
[48:17] I bring you good tidings of great joy
[48:20] amen so this is a prophet that's to be
[48:23] on the planet before his second coming
[48:26] amen and he shall turn the heart of the
[48:29] fathers to the children and the Heart of
[48:31] the children to their fathers lest I
[48:33] come and smite the Earth with a curse
[48:37] boy aren't you
[48:38] feeling aren't you feeling just even
[48:43] America just seems to be going down the
[48:46] tubes and and and the
[48:49] world I mean I believe that we're at the
[48:52] end times we don't need CNN to tell us
[48:56] that something
[48:58] inside now what is this end time Prophet
[49:01] going to
[49:05] do I I didn't hear but I he's going to
[49:09] get the bride ready for a Rapture he's
[49:12] going to catch that
[49:14] secret he's going to let the people know
[49:17] what they need to do to get ready amen
[49:20] he's going to turn the hearts of the
[49:22] Bride back to the word back to Christ
[49:25] the word now before the Rapture happen
[49:28] God Reveals His secrets to the prophets
[49:30] and how the body is going to be changed
[49:33] how their nature is going to be changed
[49:36] the Nature has changed first and then
[49:38] the body don't be forgetting about the
[49:41] nature and just be looking for the body
[49:43] change without the nature change it will
[49:45] not happen because the heart has to turn
[49:48] to
[49:50] God Revelations 10:7 but in the days of
[49:53] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[49:57] shall begin the sound the mystery of God
[50:01] should be finished as he has declared to
[50:04] his servants of prophets so we see here
[50:06] in these scriptures that it is very
[50:09] important to know God's prophets amen
[50:12] and and that without him we just can't
[50:16] come to Perfection amen we just can't
[50:18] come to Perfection now that's that's
[50:21] God's prophets but God has a five-fold
[50:23] Ministry and each one of this five they
[50:27] play a very important part in bringing
[50:29] us to Perfection and I want to take a
[50:31] look at the office of a pastor now and
[50:33] focus on our special relationship or the
[50:36] special relationship that you have with
[50:38] a pastor now according to our opening
[50:40] scriptures the pastor he's supposed to
[50:42] be a good
[50:45] guy God requires the pastor to take the
[50:48] oversight that's the overseer to be
[50:50] aware to look
[50:52] diligently Shepherds uh look for things
[50:55] that others do not not amen their senses
[50:59] are Keenan spirits that seem to develop
[51:03] in early stages they've been trained by
[51:06] the Holy Spirit to look for them and to
[51:09] when they see them begin to develop in
[51:11] the church and and he they've been
[51:13] trained to to know how to deal with
[51:16] them it's kind of taken the the
[51:19] oversight there now Shepherds must take
[51:22] this position on willingly amen with the
[51:26] right intentions the right motives the
[51:28] right objections they can't be they
[51:31] can't be thinking about
[51:32] money not for money that's right or
[51:36] attention or to gain popularity or to
[51:38] gain power or control over people Amen
[51:42] in other words they must have love for
[51:45] The Souls of
[51:50] people not by constraint but willingly
[51:53] that means with restriction control or
[51:57] limitations I'll get into that just a
[51:59] second neither as being
[52:04] Lords to exercise dominion over somebody
[52:07] to be Lord over somebody a true Shepherd
[52:10] knows God's nature is to work only
[52:13] through Freemore
[52:18] agency if people don't want to hear the
[52:22] word it is not the shepherd's job to for
[52:26] Force the word on
[52:27] somebody but if they're being unruly a
[52:31] true Shepherd's going to warn
[52:34] them but never Lord over
[52:36] them if they want to be rebellious which
[52:39] I'm telling you that's real easy to see
[52:43] it's a lot easier to see when you look
[52:44] for it for so many
[52:49] years so there's a fine
[52:52] line between having compassion on
[52:55] somebody's soul and and and and
[52:58] somebody's body and nature that's being
[53:02] uh affected so much by the devil that
[53:04] they don't even care about their soul
[53:06] condition are you with me can you say
[53:09] Amen now the pastor has been placed into
[53:12] an office by the Holy Spirit to oversee
[53:16] the
[53:17] church brother Brandon would make
[53:19] statements like the pastor is the head
[53:22] of the
[53:23] church right he has said that but we
[53:25] know the the holy spirit is the head of
[53:27] the church but God has placed an office
[53:30] in the church for
[53:33] headship and it's through this office
[53:35] that God has ordained to help lead us
[53:39] through to a nature change are you with
[53:44] me because God's not the author of
[53:47] confusion we we've you know before this
[53:49] message came along I've been in churches
[53:52] you know people stand up God told me to
[53:54] say this God told me to do this is what
[53:55] you needed other people stand up saying
[53:57] the same thing it's contradictory to one
[53:59] another it's like having a bunch of
[54:01] churches out there all saying they're of
[54:03] God but they're completely different
[54:04] from one another God is not the author
[54:07] of confusion am but of Peace as in all
[54:12] churches of the Saints the Bible
[54:14] says so a pastor's motive must be to
[54:17] help the flock of God get to where God
[54:22] is calling them right see most people
[54:26] want a pastor to help
[54:29] them
[54:31] period whatever is on their agenda but
[54:35] God has not called pastors to help them
[54:39] God has called pastors to help them get
[54:43] to where God's calling them
[54:45] to big
[54:48] difference God is interested in our
[54:50] souls above
[54:53] everything now understand it's it
[54:56] requires a lot of a pastor patience love
[54:59] care longsuffering forbearance
[55:01] comforting encouragement all these
[55:03] things it requires but the the the
[55:07] motive is to get God's sheep to where
[55:09] God's calling them to and it must remain
[55:12] their
[55:14] motive I believe where God's calling us
[55:17] to is a perfect Unity with Christ we
[55:18] just read it in the scriptures Ephesians
[55:20] a maturity adoption a Perfection perfect
[55:23] love
[55:31] people look at pastors for so many
[55:33] different
[55:38] reasons but I think it's important to
[55:40] know why God has given us a
[55:45] pastor now in order for a pastor to help
[55:47] God's sheep get to where God's calling
[55:49] them from calling them to first he must
[55:52] know where he's calling them
[55:54] to he needs a revelation of that I
[55:58] believe you can say Amen to that brother
[56:00] BR you can't live higher than than your
[56:02] pastor and if your pastor just has a
[56:04] revelation look the reason I'm here is
[56:06] because I want popularity or I want
[56:08] money I want people to look at me I I
[56:10] want to be looked at as a very popular
[56:11] funny uh reputation uh you know you're
[56:15] the congregation is not going to get
[56:16] very
[56:18] far amen so he needs to have a
[56:21] revelation of what his job is
[56:26] and second he must maintain that Vision
[56:30] through I'll say it like this through
[56:31] all the
[56:32] distractions all the distractions that
[56:34] come in a church and all the
[56:37] distractions that come in the sheep's
[56:41] life because they're both distracting I
[56:43] mean how many times we come into church
[56:45] we got so much baggage on
[56:47] us right we couldn't even hear from God
[56:50] we got so much baggage amen and and and
[56:54] and and a pastor must maintain the
[56:56] vision that God's getting through
[56:59] that and not get distracted he must stay
[57:02] the course he must stay faithful to the
[57:04] mission that God has called him
[57:06] to now what is that mission what is the
[57:09] purpose of a
[57:10] pastor now if we did a survey on that
[57:13] one we would get a variety of
[57:17] answers see brother Dennis knows that's
[57:22] true some might say well he has the
[57:25] responsibility of preaching to the
[57:29] congregation some would say well if
[57:32] there's a problem in the church you know
[57:34] it's the pastor's job to fix
[57:37] it others would say well if I have a
[57:40] problem I just go to my pastor and I
[57:42] expect him to handle
[57:45] it and and and some people like to pick
[57:48] pastors like they're buying a used car
[57:51] you use it for a little bit then you get
[57:53] on you buy another one
[57:58] some pick them like
[58:00] popcorn popping from pillar to pul from
[58:03] church to church amen looking for
[58:06] someone to appease their flesh rather
[58:09] than their
[58:10] soul now I'm really nailing this because
[58:15] we need a
[58:18] revelation God thought about your pastor
[58:20] before the world ever began
[58:23] amen I want that to sink in
[58:26] he thought about your pastor before you
[58:29] were
[58:33] born brother Brandon admonish us to
[58:35] choose our church as if it's the most
[58:37] important
[58:40] decision brother Brandon said that every
[58:42] Christian ought to have a pastor in a
[58:44] home Church a place where he's
[58:46] spiritually fed a place where he pays
[58:48] his tithe he gives offering and he
[58:50] supports the local body that means one
[58:53] another
[58:57] and it is the will of every
[58:59] Christian to do this it is the will of
[59:02] God that every Christian would do this
[59:05] and to also maintain a faithfulness in
[59:09] the church to forsake not the
[59:12] assemblying of ourselves together
[59:14] imagine you were at the times that Jesus
[59:17] was walking the
[59:18] Earth and Jesus chose you as one of the
[59:22] 12
[59:24] disciples and your attitude toward Jesus
[59:26] was well I'll just show up when I'm I'm
[59:29] it's so when I feel like
[59:31] it you know what I'm saying and I know
[59:34] that we're not living back then and but
[59:37] you've got to feel that calling that
[59:38] he's called you to a faithful walk amen
[59:41] you've got to if you don't hear
[59:44] that then it's just you trying to be a
[59:47] Christian you know God has called us to
[59:50] something
[59:52] greater something
[59:54] greater I want us to think of about God
[59:57] prepared a pastor tailored just for you
[1:00:01] before you were ever
[1:00:04] saved and brother Brandon said it like
[1:00:06] this and this is where I'm getting this
[1:00:08] from he said stay with your pastor he's
[1:00:11] ordained of God to lead you
[1:00:14] through I thought that's such a strong
[1:00:17] statement such a strong statement that
[1:00:20] word ordained means to fit in
[1:00:23] advance to fit up in advance or prepare
[1:00:27] a for time God decided which pasture he
[1:00:31] was going to use to lead you to a nature
[1:00:34] change amen amen he didn't say oh go
[1:00:38] ahead and just pick whatever you want to
[1:00:40] pick
[1:00:42] right we think we picked them but the
[1:00:46] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[1:00:48] of the Lord and God
[1:00:50] ordained that office to lead you through
[1:00:54] because he's not the author of confusion
[1:00:56] you know a lot of times people are so
[1:00:58] shallow in their walk with God if they
[1:00:59] don't get what they want they go talk to
[1:01:01] another brother if they don't get what
[1:01:03] they want there they go talk to somebody
[1:01:04] else another sister until they get what
[1:01:07] they want to hear
[1:01:09] right and then they wonder why they
[1:01:11] never grow up
[1:01:21] amen I want us to understand that it's
[1:01:24] not the man
[1:01:27] God did not it's not the man it's the
[1:01:31] office that God is
[1:01:37] behind just like uh you know the
[1:01:39] scripture says um touch not my anointed
[1:01:42] nor do my prophets any harm you don't
[1:01:44] mess with God's anointed right
[1:01:48] amen it's not because their name was
[1:01:51] William
[1:01:52] brandham was it you know he only had a
[1:01:54] seventh grade education and he you know
[1:01:56] he wasn't much to look at at Society but
[1:01:58] it was God's man it was God's office so
[1:02:02] the office of of a pastor is a very
[1:02:06] intimate relationship with your
[1:02:09] soul and and and God God is speaking all
[1:02:14] the time to
[1:02:16] you he may not call your
[1:02:21] name a lot of
[1:02:23] times if we're not in the Spirit we're
[1:02:27] not paying attention our mind is on
[1:02:28] other things didn't brother bam say the
[1:02:32] reason we come to the house of the Lord
[1:02:34] is to find out where we're standing with
[1:02:36] God Amen so that must mean he takes that
[1:02:40] that office and he's going to use it to
[1:02:42] speak to me now which way
[1:02:46] spiritually you know some people can
[1:02:48] come to church and they don't like being
[1:02:50] there so much they just kind of turn
[1:02:51] them
[1:02:52] off and you know what God still speaks
[1:02:54] in fact I believe this this even if
[1:02:56] you're not here God's speaking to you
[1:02:59] but if you're not in your position to
[1:03:00] receive
[1:03:02] it it's still on
[1:03:05] you and I'm just going to say this you
[1:03:08] know you know how the America but I'll
[1:03:12] just say the whole world I know you
[1:03:13] agree with this has has gone down the
[1:03:16] tubes as far as respect they have lost
[1:03:19] respect defund the police I mean just
[1:03:23] killing murdering doesn't matter what
[1:03:24] happens there're there's respect is
[1:03:27] going down
[1:03:29] amen there was a time in life when
[1:03:32] people would call me they would always
[1:03:34] leave a message half the time people
[1:03:36] don't leave a message
[1:03:38] anymore they brother Roger he knows that
[1:03:41] you know you know because it isn't like
[1:03:44] well you know 20 years have gone by and
[1:03:46] you know what I want to leave a better
[1:03:47] message I want to make sure I call back
[1:03:49] I want to make you know it's just
[1:03:52] down and you know what the
[1:03:56] it's the same thing but the office that
[1:03:57] God has given us to lead us
[1:04:01] through we begin to use that office or
[1:04:06] look
[1:04:07] to First we're not even recognizing the
[1:04:09] office we pay attention too much to
[1:04:11] Brother
[1:04:14] John but we start looking at that office
[1:04:17] of what it can do for my flesh it's not
[1:04:20] for your
[1:04:23] flesh it's not it's for your soul amen
[1:04:28] and that Soul needs a complete nature
[1:04:31] change so everything that God is dealing
[1:04:34] with is for your soul now I'm not saying
[1:04:37] that God couldn't uh uh speak to to you
[1:04:43] concerning natural needs I am not saying
[1:04:45] that what I am saying is let's focus on
[1:04:49] what's
[1:04:50] important you know we're coming to
[1:04:52] church and we're forgetting why we're
[1:04:53] even coming to church
[1:04:56] like we're not even interested in the
[1:04:57] nature change I'm saved so what does it
[1:05:00] matter Lord help
[1:05:03] us the office of your pastor is the
[1:05:06] ministry that God has chosen and
[1:05:09] ordained from the foundation of world to
[1:05:11] lead you to where God is calling you so
[1:05:13] I think we just need to ask the question
[1:05:15] where is God calling me where ises he
[1:05:17] calling
[1:05:20] me stay with your pastor he's ordained
[1:05:23] to lead you through I really appreciate
[1:05:25] these last couple weeks of messages that
[1:05:27] we've had I really really
[1:05:32] have now we know that God can use anyone
[1:05:35] to speak the word to us right amen God
[1:05:38] can even use a donkey to get our
[1:05:39] attention Amen brother Brandon makes
[1:05:41] this statement rapturing faith lies in
[1:05:43] the tapes so why in the world do I need
[1:05:46] a pastor to lead me
[1:05:49] through if I got if rapturing face and
[1:05:52] the tapes I mean you might think this is
[1:05:54] a good question
[1:05:56] there's something about this office that
[1:05:59] God has ordained to help you make the
[1:06:02] right decision
[1:06:03] amen see a past when it comes to a local
[1:06:07] body it's a
[1:06:09] family like it or not a
[1:06:13] family
[1:06:15] and just like any family I'm sure every
[1:06:18] father's had to sit down with his
[1:06:22] children his wife his wife sit down with
[1:06:24] the children you may not agree with me
[1:06:26] you may not like what I'm the rules are
[1:06:28] but these are the rules of the house
[1:06:30] this is the rules of the family they do
[1:06:32] what they want to do in their house we
[1:06:33] do what we want to do in our house this
[1:06:35] is just it it is no different than in
[1:06:38] the Church of
[1:06:41] God God is not the author of confusion
[1:06:45] God doesn't want us being children going
[1:06:48] around from pillar to pillar pillar to
[1:06:49] PO until we hear what we want to hear
[1:06:52] God has set up an office so we can get
[1:06:54] the message he's trying to get across to
[1:06:56] us and if you know just because you
[1:06:59] don't want to listen you're going to try
[1:07:00] to listen to a tape in another Direction
[1:07:03] I'm sorry God may be wanting to use the
[1:07:05] office he's given you to speak to you
[1:07:07] amen we got to get our attitudes right
[1:07:14] amen you know there's been believers who
[1:07:16] have done away with the ministry of
[1:07:18] pastors and just start listening to
[1:07:19] tapes it's kind of like a a onefold
[1:07:22] Ministry come on you know what I'm
[1:07:24] talking about amen it's a spirit but I
[1:07:26] want you to know that Spirit can get on
[1:07:28] somebody right inside the church they're
[1:07:30] still going to church but they're still
[1:07:32] not listening they've done away with the
[1:07:35] pastor as I'm just going to listen to
[1:07:36] the
[1:07:37] tapes or you know what they're going to
[1:07:39] pick what Pastor they're going to listen
[1:07:41] to you know what you're doing you're
[1:07:44] literally losing you're losing the very
[1:07:47] Avenue that God has ordained from the
[1:07:50] foundation of the world to speak to you
[1:07:56] now I know this is strong but we've got
[1:07:59] to we've got to keep everything in order
[1:08:01] the the the prophet has his place the
[1:08:04] Evangelist has his
[1:08:06] place every everyone has their
[1:08:11] place I want to know what God has made
[1:08:15] the pastor not what people have made the
[1:08:23] pastor it's important
[1:08:26] to feel
[1:08:29] headship you know at our work we work on
[1:08:33] jobs and and they're very very detailed
[1:08:36] and there's a lot of details to these
[1:08:38] jobs sometimes the the prints and the
[1:08:40] cads don't match uh sometimes
[1:08:43] instructions that are given by the
[1:08:45] customer don't match those two sometimes
[1:08:47] what the boss tells them uh doesn't
[1:08:50] match and and it's very easy brother Ry
[1:08:53] to go ahead and just assume something
[1:08:55] and make it a decision and when you get
[1:08:56] done find out to make say well I thought
[1:08:59] well this
[1:09:02] said and what you need is a headship to
[1:09:06] take responsibility and it's not scary
[1:09:09] because if I'm working on a job and I
[1:09:11] want this thing to turn out that's my
[1:09:12] motive and I don't know what to do and I
[1:09:15] think because I've got this experience
[1:09:17] and you know I own the business I should
[1:09:19] be able to figure it out my own and I
[1:09:21] take that
[1:09:22] chance find out that I'm wrong
[1:09:26] it messes things up I have no problem
[1:09:29] calling my customer humbling myself and
[1:09:32] says I I do not understand what you want
[1:09:35] me to do amen help me it seems
[1:09:40] confusing and as soon as he tells me I
[1:09:43] go and do it I'm happy I don't got Pride
[1:09:45] that I can't ask but I'm saying there's
[1:09:47] safety being under headship amen where
[1:09:50] if you're out on your own there is no
[1:09:52] safety amen
[1:09:57] you know some people are just so
[1:09:59] confident in themselves that they don't
[1:10:01] need a pastor to lead
[1:10:04] them now I believe in confidence I
[1:10:07] believe we must have confidence the
[1:10:10] Bible says we're we are partake we are
[1:10:12] made partakers of Christ if we hold the
[1:10:15] beginning of our confidence steadfast to
[1:10:18] the
[1:10:19] end so we need confidence but confidence
[1:10:22] and arrogance is two different things
[1:10:26] and our beginning confidence if you just
[1:10:28] think about it wasn't
[1:10:30] arrogance no we were like Lord I love
[1:10:34] you I'm subject to you I want to live
[1:10:35] for you just just I want to please you
[1:10:39] well after a while that begins to leave
[1:10:40] and we think we got
[1:10:42] it we were humbly
[1:10:45] trusting God for
[1:10:49] everything that was our beginning
[1:10:51] confidence I'm going to follow the word
[1:10:52] out of Egypt I'm going to follow the
[1:10:54] word through what I got to go through
[1:10:56] I'm going to get the Holy Ghost I'm mean
[1:10:58] business with God you've got to maintain
[1:11:01] that confidence don't be saying I got
[1:11:05] enough so there is underconfidence
[1:11:10] confident and
[1:11:12] overconfident underconfidence is being
[1:11:15] unsure uncertain pessim pessimistic
[1:11:20] indecisive overconfident is having if
[1:11:24] you look up the definition it is having
[1:11:27] unreasonable
[1:11:29] confidence unreasonable confidence being
[1:11:33] conceeded assuming self assured we could
[1:11:37] say it like brother ramam said of
[1:11:38] venturing without
[1:11:40] Authority and the Leo deia Church the
[1:11:43] spirit in leoa is filled with
[1:11:46] overconfident
[1:11:49] Believers in fact their own testimony is
[1:11:52] their Spirit now the spirit is speaking
[1:11:54] this yeah not their words their spirit
[1:11:57] is speaking this I'm in need of
[1:12:02] nothing I handle it on my
[1:12:04] own they don't even know that they're
[1:12:07] wretched miserable poor blind and naked
[1:12:09] that that's a testimony of Jesus Christ
[1:12:12] the very God they're claiming to serve
[1:12:14] has a different testimony about
[1:12:16] them now
[1:12:18] confidence is what we
[1:12:21] have and that we need to stay with
[1:12:25] when we have the word of
[1:12:32] God this is it Heaven and Earth will
[1:12:35] pass away but this word will never pass
[1:12:39] away so when you begin to make excuses
[1:12:42] of why you're not following every
[1:12:44] scripture with all your
[1:12:46] heart you're not walking with
[1:12:51] confidence maybe overconfident
[1:12:59] now no one's perfect but we should all
[1:13:01] have a perfect heart of whne to
[1:13:05] be soon as you step out on that limb
[1:13:07] well you know nobody can be
[1:13:11] perfect before you know it everything
[1:13:13] you're doing is
[1:13:14] imperfect a little leev leev at the
[1:13:17] whole lump we don't want to be blazing
[1:13:19] new trails we just want to stay with the
[1:13:22] word amen we want to believe with the
[1:13:25] the prophet said we need to let it be a
[1:13:27] testimony King Jehoshaphat said believe
[1:13:30] in the Lord your God so shall you be
[1:13:33] established I mean what a better world
[1:13:36] we'd live in if the people's lives were
[1:13:42] established believe His prophets so
[1:13:45] shall you prosper
[1:13:48] amen I don't
[1:13:50] mean
[1:13:53] monetarily God can prosper us with so
[1:13:56] many different
[1:14:00] things I want all that God had I want to
[1:14:03] prosper I want to have so much peace
[1:14:04] it's not even doesn't matter what
[1:14:06] happens to me throw me in the fire I
[1:14:08] want to have so much love I want to get
[1:14:10] kicked all around and still get up and
[1:14:12] still better love I want to prosper in
[1:14:15] the things of
[1:14:17] God now we need to have respect for what
[1:14:21] the prophet said God has ordained the
[1:14:23] office to lead us through we need to
[1:14:25] respect it we need to believe it we need
[1:14:27] to move forward we need to anticipate
[1:14:29] when we come to church that we're going
[1:14:31] to hear from God for our personal
[1:14:37] Soul the office of the pastor is not
[1:14:39] just behind the pulpit by the
[1:14:43] way right just like the office of a
[1:14:46] deacon is just not in
[1:14:49] church it's with him wherever he
[1:14:52] goes now if we can believe God honor our
[1:14:55] faith the key is being connected to God
[1:14:58] in the
[1:15:00] spirit but if we question or doubt God's
[1:15:03] use of the office we can end up missing
[1:15:06] God's
[1:15:07] visitation remember Jesus he was weeping
[1:15:10] over Jerusalem because he because thou
[1:15:12] knowest not the time of thy visitation
[1:15:16] be careful of how you entertain
[1:15:18] strangers because some of entertained
[1:15:19] angels unaware I think so often we can
[1:15:22] come into the presence of God and not
[1:15:23] even know we're in the presence of of
[1:15:25] God why because we we got to feel it we
[1:15:27] got we this is the way I picture God you
[1:15:29] know what God is not in your little
[1:15:31] square
[1:15:34] box God is much
[1:15:36] bigger and what we need to do is reduce
[1:15:39] ourselves humble ourselves in the sight
[1:15:41] of the Lord and then we're going to hear
[1:15:44] from
[1:15:45] God have you ever missed an
[1:15:50] appointment I I mean literally literally
[1:15:54] I've gone to the doctor's office this
[1:15:56] didn't happen too long ago and I said
[1:15:58] I'm I'm here for my appointment and they
[1:16:02] said your appointment is not till
[1:16:08] tomorrow or your time was
[1:16:11] off the time was off the day was off the
[1:16:14] time God is serious about giving us what
[1:16:17] we
[1:16:18] need to to help us get to where he's
[1:16:21] calling us to I think if we just take
[1:16:24] the time to Humble ourself and say God
[1:16:26] what are you calling me
[1:16:28] to instead of coming to church for our
[1:16:30] own
[1:16:31] reasons our own
[1:16:35] reasons our
[1:16:37] soul our soul needs to be
[1:16:40] fed now according to the opening
[1:16:42] scriptures the first requirement is to
[1:16:45] feed the
[1:16:48] sheep and sheep must be fed with what
[1:16:52] sheep food
[1:16:56] 100% pure alphalpha word
[1:17:01] seed must be a balanced diet that's why
[1:17:04] I'm a firm believer and a five-fold
[1:17:06] Ministry I am not worried about having
[1:17:10] to hit all five of them I'm just not I
[1:17:13] take that pressure right off of me but
[1:17:16] if I can just do the job he's called me
[1:17:18] to do you know it doesn't it don't line
[1:17:21] up with everybody's opinion what I
[1:17:24] should do how I should
[1:17:26] preach you know and I'm not here even to
[1:17:29] try to convince
[1:17:31] people but if I can just do what God
[1:17:34] wants me to do you know Jesus did a
[1:17:38] perfect job did he not amen but what was
[1:17:41] the Pharisees and the Sadducees and the
[1:17:43] lawyers and all those guys they were
[1:17:46] trying to trick them yes if you were
[1:17:49] really true blue if you were God's you
[1:17:52] know just something to find some sort of
[1:17:55] complaint
[1:18:00] about I like how brother darl he's a
[1:18:02] great evangelist I might well say it
[1:18:05] I'll say it when he's
[1:18:07] living sheep cannot just eat candy all
[1:18:11] the time they just can't live on that
[1:18:15] kind of
[1:18:15] sermon they need meat and potatoes he
[1:18:19] says that's where the real substance is
[1:18:22] at and I'm I'm telling you if we don't
[1:18:25] get back on track to what God has called
[1:18:28] us to get serious about church this
[1:18:32] isn't just a place a fundamental place
[1:18:34] that we come and hang out and you know
[1:18:36] just say this is where I go and it isn't
[1:18:39] that it's something more personal
[1:18:41] something more
[1:18:43] intimate it's between you and
[1:18:46] God and God can speak to you and I don't
[1:18:49] know one thing about
[1:18:51] it that's what I love about it it's awes
[1:18:55] awesome God is in
[1:18:58] control a pastor's job is more with the
[1:19:01] soul of a Believer than anything
[1:19:04] else God is calling our souls to get
[1:19:07] dressed in his character and I believe
[1:19:10] that's what God has ordained the pastor
[1:19:13] or the office of a pastor to lead us
[1:19:16] through what's he leading us
[1:19:18] through if we're going to make a rapture
[1:19:20] we first have to go through the nature
[1:19:23] change that's just all we are not living
[1:19:25] in the hour saints that all you have to
[1:19:28] do is be
[1:19:31] justified we are not living in the hour
[1:19:33] that all we got to do is sweep up a few
[1:19:35] things in our life no we have been
[1:19:37] called to a nature change and we've got
[1:19:40] to get serious about
[1:19:42] that we can see here turn with me to
[1:19:45] Romans chapter 13 can see here in the
[1:19:47] scriptures how God uses this office to
[1:19:49] lead
[1:19:52] us Romans chapter 13 starting with verse
[1:19:54] number one let every soul be subject
[1:19:59] unto the higher Powers
[1:20:01] am
[1:20:04] H for there is no power but of
[1:20:08] god the powers that be are ordained of
[1:20:13] God so if God ordained the office of a
[1:20:16] pastor to lead you then he ordained that
[1:20:19] that's his power that's not my power
[1:20:22] amen it's God's power
[1:20:25] amen and his in first instructions is
[1:20:29] just get this carried let's just get
[1:20:31] this straight let every soul be subject
[1:20:33] unto the higher
[1:20:35] Powers God has ordained the office of a
[1:20:38] pastor to complete to to get us to a
[1:20:40] complete conversion of the soul of the
[1:20:45] Soul so whosoever therefore resisteth
[1:20:47] the power
[1:20:50] resisteth
[1:20:51] God the very ordinance of God and they
[1:20:55] that
[1:20:56] resist what happens they shall receive
[1:20:59] to themselves damnation amen that's why
[1:21:02] I don't believe in manipulation or
[1:21:04] pressure or or or or or some power
[1:21:06] control it's through free and more
[1:21:09] agency God is a god of love I've I've
[1:21:12] I've I've had people you know I try
[1:21:15] telling them what to do and they don't
[1:21:17] want to listen and they just go
[1:21:21] on that's between them and God Amen God
[1:21:25] never put me in a
[1:21:29] position to do anything but to intercede
[1:21:31] for
[1:21:33] them to pray to believe that they will
[1:21:36] they will come around
[1:21:39] sometime because if not look if you
[1:21:42] resist God long enough you're just going
[1:21:44] to receive condemn uh damnation amen for
[1:21:48] the rulers are not a terror to good
[1:21:51] works but to evil in other words if
[1:21:54] you're going to just do nothing but be
[1:21:56] faithful and be good how are you going
[1:21:57] to get in trouble for
[1:21:59] that
[1:22:01] right wilt thou not be afraid of the
[1:22:04] power do that which is good and thou
[1:22:07] shalt have Praise of the same for he is
[1:22:09] the Minister of God to thee for
[1:22:12] good but if thou do that which is evil
[1:22:14] be afraid he beareth not the sword in
[1:22:16] vain for he is the Minister of God a
[1:22:18] Revenger a Revenger to execute wrath
[1:22:23] upon them upon him that doeth evil
[1:22:28] amen wherefore you must needs be subject
[1:22:31] not only for wrath but also for
[1:22:33] conscious
[1:22:34] sake and for this cause pay ye tribute
[1:22:41] uhoh now you know
[1:22:44] I
[1:22:46] uh
[1:22:51] um I'm just want you to see the word
[1:22:56] for this cause pay ye tribute
[1:23:00] also in other words when God does
[1:23:02] something for you you ought to say thank
[1:23:04] you
[1:23:06] Jesus when God is meeting your needs
[1:23:08] continually you should say thank you
[1:23:11] Lord for meeting all my needs when the
[1:23:13] sun comes up in the morning you should
[1:23:15] say thank you Jesus for the sunshine
[1:23:18] thank you for the health it's you're P
[1:23:20] you're giving paying tribute to whom
[1:23:23] tribute is due
[1:23:26] right for they are uh okay uh tribute to
[1:23:30] whom tributors do
[1:23:31] custom to whom custom Fear To whom fear
[1:23:34] and honor to whom
[1:23:38] honor unfortunately some Believers only
[1:23:40] want to render any dues when they feel
[1:23:43] like
[1:23:44] it but that's not what the scripture
[1:23:46] says in fact the Bible says owe no man
[1:23:50] anything but to love one another for he
[1:23:53] that loveth another has fulfilled the
[1:23:56] law when you express your love by giving
[1:24:01] tribute fear honor what you're doing is
[1:24:04] you're fulfilling the word of God well I
[1:24:07] don't want to do that because if I do
[1:24:09] that he's just going to get some big
[1:24:11] head and he's going to think he's
[1:24:16] something I don't think the scripture
[1:24:18] says that if he gets a big head that's
[1:24:22] his that's his problemen
[1:24:25] we we're called to esteem one another
[1:24:28] better than ourselves amen that's what
[1:24:30] we're called to do he didn't say only
[1:24:32] esteem others as long as you know
[1:24:36] they're not going to get a big head I
[1:24:38] mean we just we just need to start
[1:24:41] getting serious about the word of
[1:24:43] God honor the word and God will honor
[1:24:46] you that's all there is to it you start
[1:24:49] grabbing from God what you want leaving
[1:24:51] the rest you're only going to go so far
[1:24:53] with God
[1:24:56] I know brother BR talked about the
[1:24:58] pastors being that Lily and everybody
[1:24:59] comes the birds come the Beast come they
[1:25:01] take their little part that's
[1:25:02] understandable that that's fine but
[1:25:05] there's a higher calling there is a
[1:25:07] higher
[1:25:08] calling I believe God is is calling us
[1:25:10] that okay Hebrews chapter 13 verse
[1:25:14] 7 I want to read three verses there
[1:25:17] verses 716 and 17 remember them which
[1:25:20] have the rule over you who have spoken
[1:25:23] unto you the word of God whose Faith
[1:25:27] follow now consider the end of their
[1:25:31] conversation the end are they are they
[1:25:35] trying to get something out of you are
[1:25:39] they are they trying to get money
[1:25:42] popularity power control what are they
[1:25:45] trying to get out of you consider the
[1:25:47] end of their
[1:25:49] conversation well I don't got it here
[1:25:51] but verse eight says
[1:25:54] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[1:25:56] T if the end of the conversation is
[1:26:00] Christ manifested in the flesh
[1:26:03] then we can have confidence right in
[1:26:06] those that are trying to rule over us
[1:26:09] because they're watching over our souls
[1:26:12] let's Dro down to verse 16 but to do
[1:26:14] good and to communicate forget not for
[1:26:16] with such sacrifices God is well pleased
[1:26:19] obey them that have the rule over you
[1:26:20] and submit
[1:26:22] yourselves for they watch for your
[1:26:28] souls as they that as they that must
[1:26:32] give an account that they may do it with
[1:26:36] joy and not with grief for that is
[1:26:40] unprofitable for
[1:26:43] you God has ordained the office of a
[1:26:48] pastor to watch over our soul that's
[1:26:51] just
[1:26:52] it and and and and if we we just feel
[1:26:55] that we don't need anybody to watch over
[1:26:58] our soul because we're saved we're in
[1:26:59] big
[1:27:02] trouble I may not be too hip on the
[1:27:06] recent trends of the world I may not be
[1:27:09] up to date on the news or what's
[1:27:10] happening on the world scene I may not
[1:27:13] know who's winning who's losing who's
[1:27:16] being
[1:27:17] drafted I may not be a great
[1:27:21] Storyteller I could be probably if I
[1:27:23] wanted to but just don't want to or
[1:27:26] having fun behind the pulpit but I will
[1:27:28] say this I am watching over your
[1:27:34] soul I am carefully observing your soul
[1:27:39] now that word watch it really means
[1:27:46] Sleepless it means to keep awake in
[1:27:49] other words when you're not here or
[1:27:55] you're still a a you're still a burden
[1:28:00] on the pastor's
[1:28:06] heart so you may think well I'm not
[1:28:08] there it's not a big deal
[1:28:11] but if God wants you here and you're a
[1:28:14] part of this body
[1:28:21] right our souls may not be something we
[1:28:23] think about
[1:28:24] about very
[1:28:28] much and I'm sure we've had this thought
[1:28:32] since our soul is already saved we must
[1:28:35] be okay because we're not Believers that
[1:28:39] you know we're not saved
[1:28:41] right we believe we're
[1:28:43] saved we got I got saved I got baptized
[1:28:46] I got
[1:28:48] saved so why would I need anyone to
[1:28:51] watch over my soul
[1:28:55] I just want to say it like this it's not
[1:28:57] he that starts the race but he that
[1:28:58] finishes it yes amen it's not an
[1:29:02] automatic over the Finish Line because
[1:29:03] you repented and got
[1:29:06] baptized but it's he that runs the race
[1:29:09] and finishes the C the course now what's
[1:29:11] the course the course just so you
[1:29:13] understand it is a nature
[1:29:16] change it isn't just surviving into the
[1:29:20] Rapture keeping myself from going into
[1:29:23] the world I'm sorry that is not the
[1:29:26] race the race is to become just like him
[1:29:30] I will not be satisfied to awaken his
[1:29:32] likeness it does not yet appear what we
[1:29:34] shall be but we know that when he shall
[1:29:36] appear we shall be like him we shall see
[1:29:39] him as he is that is that is the
[1:29:46] race turn with me well I'm just going to
[1:29:49] quote it to you 2 Corinthians 511718 you
[1:29:53] write it down therefore If any man be in
[1:29:55] Christ he is a new creature old things
[1:29:57] are passed away behold All Things become
[1:30:01] new now that one word all that just like
[1:30:03] just like grips me there's like no
[1:30:06] satisfaction what about this and this I
[1:30:08] I got rid of this no everything's got to
[1:30:11] become like him and all things are of
[1:30:15] God who have G who have reconciled us to
[1:30:18] himself by Jesus Christ and had given to
[1:30:20] us a Ministry now now through this
[1:30:24] process of becoming more like him he he
[1:30:27] harnesses us with a Ministry that now we
[1:30:31] got to go out and share Jesus with other
[1:30:35] people that's an automatic by the way
[1:30:38] that is not just for the
[1:30:40] ministry for those that are called to
[1:30:42] the five-fold ministry that is every
[1:30:45] human being who's been changed by
[1:30:49] Christ now we all have confidence that
[1:30:52] we started the race
[1:30:54] Philippians 1:6 being confident of this
[1:30:56] very thing that he which had begun a
[1:30:59] good work in you will perform it or
[1:31:02] complete it until the J the day of Jesus
[1:31:05] Christ so God is looking for a
[1:31:07] completion
[1:31:09] here so we all have confidence that we
[1:31:12] started the race but our souls must keep
[1:31:15] running the race no time to slack we got
[1:31:19] to keep fighting the good fight of faith
[1:31:20] we got to keep pressing on to that
[1:31:23] nature change
[1:31:26] some may wonder why they need to have
[1:31:29] someone watch over their soul when
[1:31:31] they're already saved I think that's a
[1:31:32] good question and I want to address
[1:31:35] it like I received salvation in in
[1:31:39] 2012 in in May and it was the 14th I
[1:31:43] I'll never forget it Jesus came into my
[1:31:46] heart I got baptized at same day and you
[1:31:49] know my soul is saved so why do I need
[1:31:52] someone watching over my Soul that's
[1:31:54] already
[1:32:00] saved well did you know the Bible says
[1:32:04] that May 12 or whatever I said of
[1:32:09] 2012 is not the day of
[1:32:13] salvation do you know the Bible says
[1:32:15] today is the day of salvation amen and
[1:32:19] if you wake up tomorrow that day is
[1:32:21] going to be the day of salvation
[1:32:25] that means God has something for you am
[1:32:30] we need to keep looking to Jesus who's
[1:32:32] the author and the finisher of our faith
[1:32:36] not just the day he saved me well
[1:32:38] everything's okay no you just started a
[1:32:42] process
[1:32:46] Amen brother John are you bring
[1:32:48] preaching some strange Doctrine no it is
[1:32:50] the Bible
[1:32:51] Doctrine First Peter chapter 1: 6 we can
[1:32:55] put that up on the board 1 Peter chapter
[1:32:57] 1: 6 look at this wherein you greatly
[1:33:00] Rejoice though now for a season if need
[1:33:02] be ye are in heaviness through manifold
[1:33:05] Temptations right one after another that
[1:33:08] the trial of your faith be in much more
[1:33:10] precious than gold that perishes though
[1:33:11] it be tried with fire might be found
[1:33:14] into the praise and honor and Glory at
[1:33:15] the appearing of Jesus Christ
[1:33:18] notice the trials that you go through if
[1:33:21] you yield yourself to God and you
[1:33:23] develop the character that he's calling
[1:33:25] you
[1:33:26] to
[1:33:27] then it will be unto the praise and
[1:33:30] honor and that he be found unto praise
[1:33:35] honor and Glory at the appearing of
[1:33:37] Jesus Christ see it's at the end that
[1:33:39] he's looking to whom having not seen you
[1:33:42] love in whom though you see him not we
[1:33:46] talked about that at the beginning yet
[1:33:48] believing you rejoice with joy
[1:33:51] unspeakable and full of Glory
[1:33:55] now notice there's no period there it's
[1:33:56] a
[1:33:57] colon receiving the end of your faith
[1:34:01] but what is the end of your faith
[1:34:02] brother John even the
[1:34:06] salvation of your
[1:34:12] souls so I'm thankful for the day it
[1:34:15] started but that day is important amen
[1:34:20] because the way the tree falls that's
[1:34:22] the way it lies
[1:34:25] so I'm telling you when you come here
[1:34:27] God is speaking to your
[1:34:30] soul and there and I I I praise God for
[1:34:35] the fight we get we get missionaries we
[1:34:37] get evangelists we get we get a variety
[1:34:40] of people that come here but I'm telling
[1:34:42] you there is one office that I'm sure
[1:34:45] that if you're not getting the message
[1:34:47] some way God uses that office to speak
[1:34:50] to you he has to because he ordained it
[1:34:54] and it's up to us to be in tune
[1:35:00] amen we got to stay in tune
[1:35:05] amen all
[1:35:07] right you know what I did start a a
[1:35:11] little bit late did you all notice that
[1:35:13] praise God someone's paying attention I
[1:35:15] need somebody on my side now I know you
[1:35:16] had a couple services that were
[1:35:19] lengthy and my beautiful darling wife
[1:35:23] next to me me this morning said now
[1:35:26] remember it was last night she said now
[1:35:28] remember we had two long services and
[1:35:31] the people don't want to have a long
[1:35:32] sermon
[1:35:37] today so I'm very conscious of
[1:35:43] this turn with me if you would to
[1:35:45] Philippians chapter
[1:35:47] 2 now God's motive is to get preeminence
[1:35:51] in
[1:35:52] you is that where what first Colossians
[1:35:55] tells us his desire is to have the
[1:35:57] preeminence in the church now he can't
[1:36:00] get preeminence in us until there's a
[1:36:03] nature
[1:36:04] change now you can yield to them for a
[1:36:06] minute and get
[1:36:07] blessed but until you yield your life
[1:36:10] and your nature begins to change he
[1:36:12] really doesn't have preeminence in the
[1:36:14] church you understand what I'm saying so
[1:36:16] his goal is to get more and more of our
[1:36:19] nature changed and as that nature get
[1:36:22] changed he can now become preeminent and
[1:36:25] say you're going to do this today we're
[1:36:26] going to do that we're going to go here
[1:36:28] we're going to because now he's in
[1:36:30] charge amen all right so we're changed
[1:36:35] from Glory unto Glory a little bit every
[1:36:38] time we
[1:36:39] come but remember there's a there's a
[1:36:42] fleshly part of you that don't want this
[1:36:46] right all right Philippians chapter 2:2
[1:36:48] wherefore my beloved as ye have always
[1:36:52] obeyed not in my presence only but now
[1:36:56] much more my absence I want you to work
[1:36:58] out your own salvation with fear and
[1:37:01] trembling there is another scripture
[1:37:03] that tells me you know I just can't one
[1:37:07] saved always saved it doesn't matter
[1:37:08] what I
[1:37:09] do that there's something that you
[1:37:12] actually have to work through now if you
[1:37:14] remember when you first got saved you
[1:37:17] had fear and
[1:37:19] trembling you knew that if you didn't
[1:37:22] give your heart to God
[1:37:26] that was it there was no other way to
[1:37:28] get to
[1:37:30] heaven so there was that respect okay if
[1:37:33] this is what the Bible says I need to do
[1:37:35] if this is my first step then this is
[1:37:38] what I'm going to do I'm going to repent
[1:37:40] for my my sins I'm G I'm going to get
[1:37:42] baptized and I'm GNA ask Jesus Christ to
[1:37:45] come into my heart you work that out
[1:37:48] with fear and trembling respect to the
[1:37:50] word of God Amen it is no different
[1:37:53] today with today's day of salvation it
[1:37:55] will be no different
[1:37:58] tomorrow so we're here in church
[1:38:02] now but not just in church because it
[1:38:05] can be happened anytime God speaks to us
[1:38:07] for it is God which worketh in you
[1:38:11] inside of you both to Will and to do of
[1:38:15] his good pleasure now you you know what
[1:38:18] the best way to not be bothered by God
[1:38:22] is don't
[1:38:24] ask
[1:38:25] him what he wants you to
[1:38:28] do don't read the Bible don't come to
[1:38:31] church don't talk to a more spiritual
[1:38:34] believer than you
[1:38:35] are talk to somebody carnal so you're
[1:38:38] not held to anything accountable and you
[1:38:41] know what you'll go on thinking you know
[1:38:44] what God hasn't told me what to
[1:38:48] do
[1:38:51] God's God
[1:38:54] will speak to you
[1:38:56] amen and it'll be in your heart for it
[1:38:58] is God which worketh in you both to will
[1:39:00] and do of his good pleasure do do
[1:39:02] everything that God tells you to
[1:39:04] do without murmuring and
[1:39:08] disputing that you may have a testimony
[1:39:11] they may be blameless harmless as sons
[1:39:13] of God without rebuke in the midst of a
[1:39:15] crooked perverse Nation among whom you
[1:39:17] shine as lights in the world not just at
[1:39:21] church you don't just put on at church
[1:39:25] the real light is at
[1:39:27] home that's the real
[1:39:29] light that's where that's that's where
[1:39:32] you find out what your relationship is
[1:39:35] with God right there holding forth the
[1:39:38] word of life that I may rejoice in the
[1:39:41] day of Christ that I have I have not run
[1:39:44] in vain neither I have labored in vain
[1:39:46] I'm going to just finish the
[1:39:49] course so let's stand together so we
[1:39:52] want to come to church with fear and
[1:39:54] trembling we want to come with sincere
[1:39:56] Humble Hearts we want to come waiting to
[1:40:00] hear from
[1:40:04] God because we can have confidence that
[1:40:07] God has ordained this office to lead us
[1:40:11] through amen last scripture I want to
[1:40:14] give
[1:40:15] you it's Hebrews 2:1 therefore we ought
[1:40:18] to give the more Earnest heed to the
[1:40:21] things which we have heard
[1:40:24] lest at any time we should let them
[1:40:29] slip if God gave them to us it's
[1:40:37] important it's important that we are
[1:40:40] faithful with what God told us it's it's
[1:40:43] not
[1:40:45] important that you do everything that
[1:40:47] God told me to
[1:40:49] do or that you do everything God told
[1:40:52] somebody else to do it's a walk between
[1:40:55] you and God God may never ask you to do
[1:40:59] the things he's asking the person next
[1:41:01] to you to
[1:41:02] do but what is
[1:41:04] important is that you have this intimate
[1:41:07] relationship with Jesus Christ so
[1:41:09] intimate that when the word is being
[1:41:11] preached you hear the voice of God my
[1:41:15] sheep hear my voice and what do they do
[1:41:18] they follow me amen they follow me amen
[1:41:22] let's just bow our hearts for a word of
[1:41:28] prayer every eye closed every heart
[1:41:30] bowed no be looking
[1:41:34] around if someone just in their heart
[1:41:37] would you remember me in prayer God
[1:41:39] knows all about it just raise your hand
[1:41:41] God bless these hands bless these hands
[1:41:44] God sees your hearts it's beautiful
[1:41:46] absolutely
[1:41:48] beautiful think about
[1:41:50] these words that
[1:41:54] David spoke one thing if I desired of
[1:41:56] the
[1:41:57] Lord that will I seek after all the days
[1:42:00] of my H my life he said in there to
[1:42:03] behold the beauty of the
[1:42:07] Lord I don't know of anything more
[1:42:10] beautiful to to to
[1:42:12] witness than the very
[1:42:16] desires that were once selfish and all
[1:42:20] about ourselves being changed to want to
[1:42:22] please God
[1:42:24] I just believe that's a beautiful thing
[1:42:27] our heavenly father I believe that you
[1:42:30] believe that's a beautiful thing too to
[1:42:33] give you our lives to give you our
[1:42:36] hearts Lord we thank you for everything

[1:42:51] avenue to get perfected we thank you

[1:45:36] would be that you would return Lord my
[1:45:40] prayer is that we would all be ready in
[1:45:42] that day for that was what you you spoke
[1:45:46] be ready in in that hour Lord in order
[1:45:50] for us to be ready in that hour to have
[1:45:53] confidence that we be ready in that hour
[1:45:55] is to be ready the very best that we can
[1:45:58] today so I pray Lord that we would be
[1:46:02] ready if there's anyone that just is
[1:46:04] Desiring the blood of Jesus Christ to
[1:46:06] cleanse them from the past Lord I pray
[1:46:09] that you would just cover them with your
[1:46:10] blood I pray that you just wash away the
[1:46:14] past they could just have the confidence
[1:46:16] Lord that they're just moving forward
[1:46:18] with you bless us now as a
[1:46:21] body may we just continue to grow more
[1:46:24] in your image and your likeness to be
[1:46:27] mature and Lord help us to step up to
[1:46:30] the plate and help one another really
[1:46:32] prove what is that good and acceptable
[1:46:35] perfect will of
[1:46:36] God lord maybe there are some that are
[1:46:40] being
[1:46:41] called to be more faithful to the
[1:46:44] body maybe some are being called to to
[1:46:49] go out and
[1:46:50] share this message this truth that Jesus
[1:46:54] Christ is alive to other souls for you
[1:46:58] said they that say win souls is wise and

[1:47:18] Christ I pray Lord also this in this
[1:47:21] prayer standing here here unworthy to be
[1:47:24] behind the
[1:47:25] pulpit
[1:47:29] unworthy I know that
[1:47:34] Lord but
[1:47:36] Lord as you have chosen I pray that I
[1:47:40] could be
[1:47:42] faithful to make sure that your people
[1:47:46] get the
[1:47:48] message that you need them to get
[1:47:53] and Lord I know the Saints are praying
[1:47:55] for me may you grant this Lord I commit
[1:47:58] myself to you
