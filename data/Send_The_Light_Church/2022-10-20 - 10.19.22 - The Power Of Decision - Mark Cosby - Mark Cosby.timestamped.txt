[1:59] your control Lord and move in your way
[2:01] you would see fit Lord in Jesus Christ
[2:03] and we pray amen
[2:06] like to open up to opening scripture in
[2:08] Matthew chapter 4. in verses 18 through
[2:12] 20 very very familiar scriptures
[2:17] so Matthew 4 18 through 20.
[2:21] and please say Amen when you get there
[2:30] and it says in Jesus walking by the Sea
[2:33] of Galilee saw a two Brethren Simon
[2:36] called Peter and Andrew his brother
[2:38] casting a net into the sea for they were
[2:41] Fishers and he said unto them follow me
[2:44] and I will make you Fishers of Men
[2:47] amen God bless you let me the word just
[2:50] bless his word he may be seated
[2:52] and we're going to turn to Mark chapter
[2:54] one
[2:57] and we'll read verses 16 through 20 in
[2:59] Mark chapter 1.
[3:08] so it says the Bible says now as he
[3:11] walked by the Sea of Galilee he saw
[3:13] Simon and Andrea's brother casting a net
[3:16] into the sea for they were Fishers and
[3:18] Jesus said unto them Come Ye after me
[3:21] and I will make you to become Fishers of
[3:23] Men notice they had a choice it says
[3:26] Come Ye after me and they have to they
[3:27] had to make that choice just as we have
[3:29] them had to make that choice as well
[3:30] when we came to Christ and they straight
[3:33] away they forsook their Nets and
[3:34] followed him and we had gone a little
[3:37] far the events he saw James the son of
[3:38] Zebedee and John his brother who also
[3:41] were on the ship mending their Nets and
[3:43] straightway he called them and they left
[3:45] their fathers everybody in the ship with
[3:47] the higher servants and went after him
[3:49] and we'll go to one more scripture
[3:50] reading in Luke chapter 5.
[3:52] and reverses one through eleven
[3:56] only a little bit of foundation
[4:00] so chapter 5 verses 1-11 and it came to
[4:03] pass
[4:04] that as a people pressed upon him to
[4:06] hear the word of God he stood by the
[4:08] lake of guessing heart and saw two ships
[4:11] standing by the lake but the fishermen
[4:13] were gone out of them and were washing
[4:15] their Nets
[4:16] and they entered into one of the ships
[4:18] which was Simon's and he prayed to him
[4:21] that he would thirst a little farther
[4:22] from land and he sat down and taught the
[4:25] people out of the ship
[4:26] now when he left speaking he said unto
[4:28] Simon launch out into the deep and let
[4:31] down your nets for a drought and Simon
[4:33] answering said unto him Master we have
[4:35] toil all the night and have taken
[4:37] nothing nevertheless at Thy word I will
[4:40] let down the net amen and when they had
[4:43] done this they enclosed a great
[4:45] multitude of fishes and their net break
[4:47] and they bake it onto their Partners
[4:49] which were in the other ship that they
[4:51] should come and help and they came and
[4:52] filled both the ships so they began to
[4:54] seek I can relate in verse 8 what Simon
[4:56] Peters is going to say when Simon Peter
[4:58] saw it he fell down at Jesus knees and
[5:01] saying depart from me from a sinful man
[5:04] oh Lord for he was astonished and all
[5:06] that were with him at the drought of
[5:08] fishes when they had taken and so was
[5:10] also James and John the sons of Zebedee
[5:12] which were partners with Simon and Jesus
[5:15] said unto him fear not from henceforth
[5:16] thou shall catch men and they had
[5:19] brought their ships to land they forsook
[5:20] all and followed him now notice that we
[5:23] look at each rendition in Luke and
[5:25] Matthew and Mark they all had that same
[5:27] choice to follow Jesus or not and the
[5:30] title of our sermon is the power of
[5:32] decision
[5:33] and so at each instance Peter Andrew
[5:37] John they all had a choice whether it's
[5:40] a follow Jesus or Not Jesus never forced
[5:43] them to make that decision but he said
[5:45] come after me and just as the words
[5:47] being preached the Lord is saying come
[5:49] after me because he wants to speak to
[5:51] each one of us and now we all made that
[5:53] that decision when we gave our heart to
[5:55] Christ praise the Lord but we each day
[5:58] we have a decision whether we serve God
[6:00] or not for the day that's why Jesus said
[6:02] you must crucify daily you must deny
[6:04] yourself daily before you even pick your
[6:06] cross up so we don't realize how great
[6:09] our our power of decision is in our life
[6:12] because one bad decision can ruin your
[6:15] life years to come uh just like as we
[6:18] see many scriptural examples in the
[6:20] Bible of the power of decision and we're
[6:22] getting more into uh in the children of
[6:24] Israel later in the sermon praise God
[6:27] so I I this song I Really we like this
[6:29] song we all know what a friend we have
[6:31] in Jesus I'm reading a couple lines from
[6:33] it all our sins and griefs to Bear what
[6:35] a privilege to carry Everything To God
[6:37] In Prayer notice that the peace that we
[6:40] often forfeit so a lot of times we'll
[6:42] make a decision and not pray about it
[6:44] we'll just think oh it sounds good but
[6:47] we don't weigh the consequences of it
[6:49] because each decision that you make in
[6:51] your life is going to have consequences
[6:53] when you serve Christ it had positive
[6:57] consequences you may have lost some
[6:59] friends you may have lost some family
[7:01] members they made a cause separation but
[7:03] I believe that's the greatest decision
[7:05] that a Believer can ever make is to give
[7:07] his heart to Christ and to say Lord be
[7:10] the captain of my ship
[7:11] and so that's a beautiful decision but
[7:14] each day like I said before you have
[7:15] that decision whether you serve God or
[7:17] not because God is looking for a
[7:19] believer that he can fully use on a
[7:21] daily basis and you I can't make the
[7:24] decision for you but the Bruce can't
[7:25] make a decision for you you have to make
[7:27] that decision every day the things that
[7:29] you feed on you're making a decision to
[7:31] feed on them so if you're feeding on the
[7:33] things of God that's a good decision but
[7:35] if you're choosing to feed the things of
[7:37] the world then that's a bad decision it
[7:39] may not hurt you at that very moment but
[7:42] it will begin to affect you spiritually
[7:44] eventually
[7:45] praise God
[7:47] so I looked the word forsake it means to
[7:50] quit or leave entirely so when the Lord
[7:53] is asking us to forsake something they
[7:55] say maybe maybe you're a basketball
[7:58] player or whatever it was maybe you
[8:00] really loved music you had records like
[8:02] brother John said he's asking us to
[8:05] forsake that very thing and it says to
[8:07] quit or leave entirely see if you truly
[8:10] forsake something you can't hold on to
[8:12] it and still try to serve God Jesus told
[8:15] us it was impossible you can't serve
[8:17] Mammon and God at the same time so when
[8:19] the Lord is asking you to to leave
[8:21] something to give something up the best
[8:24] thing for you to do is to make that
[8:25] decision to do it right then and there
[8:27] because once again God is looking for
[8:30] obedience he's not looking for you to
[8:32] question him his every single move in
[8:34] your life a lot of times we may not get
[8:36] the answer right then and there but he
[8:38] says asking believe me trust me that's
[8:41] always asking for us to do notice like I
[8:44] said before Jesus is gave them a choice
[8:46] as he's given us a choice to let him
[8:49] into his heart and see that picture
[8:50] right there right now he's knocking at
[8:52] the door of our hearts and you have to
[8:54] make that decision to open that door
[8:56] it's up to you it's up to in my life
[8:59] it's a personal walk it's not a
[9:01] two-person walk but it's a personal walk
[9:02] with you and God that's the only two
[9:04] people can be on that road
[9:05] praise God
[9:07] let's keep going
[9:08] so I looked the word decision the action
[9:10] or process of deciding something or
[9:13] resolving a question and conclusion or
[9:16] resolution reached after consideration
[9:18] so a decision when we make a decision it
[9:21] could be your financial the first main
[9:24] decision is your Eternal destination
[9:26] that's the first decision that we had to
[9:28] make as Believers when you made Christ
[9:31] your first choice you chose your Eternal
[9:33] destination
[9:35] and now the next one is a church now you
[9:38] prayerfully went about choosing a church
[9:40] because God wants us to be in church for
[9:43] a reason not just because it sounds good
[9:45] but that's the chosen place he spoke to
[9:47] speak to us in church that's where we
[9:49] find out where we're at with God
[9:51] another thing we chose is a career
[9:54] a career is a very important thing you
[9:55] don't want this any old career but you
[9:57] want the career that God has for you
[9:59] and then another important thing is a
[10:01] spouse you don't want to just marry any
[10:03] old body but you want to make sure that
[10:05] you're going into what God has for your
[10:08] rib that's very important
[10:11] and there's going to be many more
[10:12] decisions that we're going to have to
[10:13] make in our life and not every time
[10:16] we're gonna have you know weeks and
[10:19] weeks to pray for a decision sometimes
[10:21] you got to make a decision right then
[10:22] and there it's so important to have the
[10:24] minded Christ at all times if you have
[10:27] the mind of Christ it's going to help
[10:29] lead your decision because Jesus he had
[10:32] the he had the mind of Christ he was
[10:34] Christ
[10:35] and he looked at every decision he made
[10:38] it was pleasing to the father because
[10:41] why he wanted to please the father he
[10:43] said I do nothing but what the father
[10:45] shows me
[10:46] so he had that plea yes he had he had a
[10:49] choice Jesus also had a choice he had
[10:51] the power of choice he had the choice
[10:53] not to go to Calvary for us but he made
[10:56] that choice because he loved you and me
[10:58] more than he loved staying here on Earth
[11:00] with his disciples he would so love to
[11:02] stay with his disciples and spend time
[11:03] with him but he knew that he had a
[11:05] greater higher calling that God was
[11:07] calling him to
[11:10] praise God so there's going to be many
[11:12] decisions you have to make in your life
[11:13] that's why it's so important to go about
[11:15] it prayerfully I can't I can't say it
[11:18] enough even when witnessing to somebody
[11:20] you want to make sure you're going about
[11:21] it prayerfully because if you're
[11:23] witnessing to them then you're not going
[11:25] to get the job done but if it's God
[11:27] through you witnessing him the job's
[11:29] going to get done
[11:30] and so that's why it's so important to
[11:33] prayer is so key in your life in fact
[11:36] prayer is the greatest weapon that God
[11:39] has put in the hands of mankind as a
[11:41] true sincere prayer to offer to God
[11:43] that's what God is looking for you're
[11:46] looking for in a prayer not how well and
[11:48] elegant you sound but is it really
[11:50] coming from the heart
[11:52] are you really pouring your heart out to
[11:54] God you know that's what it comes down
[11:56] to I'm reading a couple quotes
[11:58] how do you know your boundary line is
[12:00] not set tonight to make your decision
[12:02] for Christ so maybe some people out here
[12:05] listening on the live stream who maybe
[12:06] are on the boundary line but still we
[12:09] still had that same decision tonight
[12:13] are you gonna turn him away from the
[12:14] last time there's a line drawn a Plumb
[12:16] line and God sets his boundaries God is
[12:19] in his nature God is in his Universe
[12:21] moving among his people God moves out we
[12:24] look at it and see and behold how great
[12:26] his handiwork is what he does and how he
[12:29] works as nature to bring mankind to him
[12:31] I've seen him in tornadoes seen him in
[12:33] great things how that God moves so we we
[12:36] kind of put God in a box sometimes we
[12:38] think that God can just speak to us this
[12:40] this way but God speaks in so many ways
[12:43] he's in nature he's omnipresent he's
[12:45] everywhere
[12:47] so don't just think God uh can just
[12:49] speak to you this in X Y and Z but just
[12:52] be open God is he can use a billboard he
[12:55] can use he uses his word amen amen so
[13:00] one more quote and we'll keep it going
[13:01] and go to James chapter one she's on the
[13:03] evasion the hour is here now yes an hour
[13:06] of decision to an hour of decision not
[13:09] to come to church but an hour of
[13:10] decision whether we're going to serve
[13:12] Christ or stay lukewarm now we all made
[13:14] the decision to come to church tonight
[13:17] but did you make the decision not to
[13:19] just sit in a seat but to receive from
[13:21] God that's a decision right there
[13:22] because we can make a decision to go to
[13:24] church Wednesdays and Sundays praise God
[13:26] but if your heart's not in it then
[13:30] you're making that's a bad decision what
[13:31] if you're hard Senate you've made a good
[13:33] decision
[13:34] because God isn't calling us as to warm
[13:36] seats but he's calling us to live the
[13:38] word that he's preaching to us that's
[13:40] what he's calling us to and if we make
[13:42] it anything less than that we miss the
[13:45] reason why God set churches up for a
[13:47] reason he set the church is up for a
[13:49] reason to put us in order to help us to
[13:51] perfect us he's given us a five-fold
[13:53] Ministry for a reason to perfect the
[13:55] Saints because
[13:57] we're preparing for a rat in fact the
[13:59] Raptors happening right now everything
[14:00] every decision you make is either going
[14:03] to bring you one step closer to it or
[14:04] one step behind it so that's how it's so
[14:07] important if we can just get this
[14:08] decisions down each decision is so
[14:11] important in your life in fact one bad
[14:14] decision can affect not just you but
[14:16] your whole family around you we see that
[14:19] in when Aiken I was in the nose but
[14:21] Aiken he uh chose to steal some gold and
[14:26] it affected the whole Army of Israel
[14:28] they cannot win a battle think about
[14:30] that one decision that he made he
[14:31] probably thought oh is this a little
[14:33] gold here but in reality it affected
[14:36] those around him and he actually had to
[14:38] pay with his life for that decision
[14:41] now I'm not saying that that's going to
[14:43] happen to you but I'm gonna say in this
[14:45] that one wrong decision can impact your
[14:48] family from years down the line that's
[14:50] why it's so important to think about the
[14:53] decision you're going to make make sure
[14:55] it's a good decision I don't want it
[14:57] just to sound like a good decision but
[14:59] go about it prayerfully because it can
[15:01] not only affect your family but your
[15:03] church brothers and sisters as well
[15:04] that's how important it is one bad
[15:07] decision
[15:08] let's go to James one as I said James
[15:10] want to read chapter verses one through
[15:12] eight
[15:16] I I just think about how many times that
[15:19] we just forfeit the peace in our life by
[15:22] not Consulting God we try to handle all
[15:26] these things by ourselves and try to
[15:28] juggle it by ourself and and God didn't
[15:31] intend for it to be like that he
[15:33] intended for him to be the center of
[15:35] your life he wants to be the center of
[15:37] your decisions the center of everything
[15:39] at your job at your home at your work in
[15:41] your car God wants to be everything in
[15:44] your life but you have to make that
[15:46] decision to put him there you have to
[15:48] put him first on a daily basis don't
[15:50] just put him first on Wednesdays and
[15:51] Sundays but put them first seven days a
[15:54] week 24 hours a day that's what he's
[15:56] calling us too
[15:59] so James chapter 1.
[16:02] James a servant of God and the Lord
[16:04] Jesus Christ to the 12 tribes which are
[16:07] scattered abroad greeting my brethren
[16:10] counting all Joys when you fall into
[16:12] diverse Temptations I want to just point
[16:14] this out notice that he says counter all
[16:17] Joys so you have to make that that
[16:19] choice to be joyful in your diverse
[16:22] Temptations because it says it says in
[16:25] the scriptures telling me my brother
[16:26] accounted all Joys when you fall into
[16:29] diverse Temptations then it gives you
[16:32] why knowing this that the trying of your
[16:34] faith worketh patience
[16:36] see God has a purpose when you're going
[16:40] through your trials when everything
[16:41] around you feel like it's falling apart
[16:43] is for a reason God is this this isn't
[16:46] doing this to do it but he's doing it
[16:47] with a perfect purpose he's trying to
[16:49] it's potential inside of you he's trying
[16:52] to to mind that potential he's trying to
[16:54] perfect that potential inside of you
[16:56] because God sees something in you that
[16:58] we can't see sometimes
[17:00] and if God's living inside of you he
[17:02] wants to live more inside of you this as
[17:04] a minor is uh has gold he's trying to
[17:07] beat that goal to see his image so God
[17:09] is trying to see more of his image
[17:11] inside of us he wants to give us more
[17:13] patience he wants the fruits of the Holy
[17:15] Ghost to to work in our life on a daily
[17:16] basis not not just once a month not just
[17:19] twice a month but 31 days out of each
[17:22] month sometimes it's 28 29 days you know
[17:24] what I mean that's what God is looking
[17:25] for verse uh verse 4 but let patience
[17:28] have her perfect work that ye may be
[17:31] perfect and empowering wanting nothing
[17:33] see a lot of times we want to get out of
[17:35] a trial
[17:36] but is this uh this is I was in the
[17:39] men's meeting a couple weeks three weeks
[17:41] ago and this uh Minister said I never
[17:43] forget a lot of times we're looking for
[17:46] a miracle for our you know in our trial
[17:49] but God's looking for growth
[17:51] that we we want to get out the trouble
[17:52] one guy just to wave his hand and just
[17:54] take us out but God is looking for
[17:56] growth he's looking to build something
[17:58] inside of you that's that it's not there
[18:00] but he's trying to build it inside of
[18:02] you
[18:03] praise God he said verse five if any of
[18:06] you lack wisdom let them ask of God that
[18:08] give it to all men liberally in a
[18:10] bravest not and it shall be given him
[18:12] but let him ask nothing
[18:14] uh let him ask in faith nothing wavering
[18:17] for he that wavers like a wave of the
[18:19] sea driven with the wind and tossed for
[18:22] let not that man think that he shall
[18:24] receive anything of the Lord a
[18:26] double-minded man is unstable in all his
[18:28] ways
[18:29] so we can't have a double mind when
[18:31] we're making a decision well we can't
[18:32] say oh man this feels good to my flesh
[18:34] but you know you gotta we got to cut
[18:36] that out because not every decision
[18:38] you're gonna make is gonna be easy
[18:42] not everybody's going to agree with the
[18:43] decisions you're going to make now if
[18:45] it's from the Lord
[18:46] that's okay if everybody doesn't agree
[18:48] with it because some somebody the Lord
[18:50] can speak to directly
[18:52] and it's a personal walk but we say once
[18:54] again the Lord can speak to directly and
[18:56] not speak to another person about what
[18:58] you got to do
[18:59] but so if if it lines up with the word
[19:01] and if if it's thus saith the Lord in
[19:04] the word then go for it but if it's
[19:06] shaky then I would I would definitely go
[19:08] by the prayerfully
[19:10] praise God let's keep let's go to First
[19:12] Corinthians 10. so now we want to get
[19:14] into the children of Israel just that
[19:16] that great decision they had just look
[19:18] at the children of Israel they had uh
[19:21] they had God literally sent a prophet
[19:24] and delivered them from the Egyptians
[19:28] and we see all the mighty things that
[19:30] God did for them but they could never
[19:33] come to Grass to take God at his word
[19:36] fully and give their heart to god so
[19:38] let's go to First Corinthians 10.
[19:41] 1 through 15.
[19:45] so it says moreover Brethren I would not
[19:48] that ye should be ignorant how that all
[19:50] our fathers under the cloud and all pass
[19:53] through the sea we're all baptized unto
[19:55] Moses and the cloud and in the sea and
[19:57] it all eat the same spiritual meat and
[20:00] it all drank the same spiritual drink
[20:02] for they drink of that that spiritual
[20:05] rock that was uh followed them and that
[20:07] rock was Christ now notice they are all
[20:10] experienced the same things that Joshua
[20:12] and Caleb did they all saw everything
[20:14] that it's not one thing they didn't see
[20:16] together
[20:17] amen but notice there was only two
[20:21] that made it to the promised land out of
[20:23] the million out of two million no notice
[20:25] that and it just like uh I'm gonna took
[20:28] this class in college a long time ago
[20:29] and uh this statement I'll never forget
[20:31] they said how two kids can be raised in
[20:35] the same home
[20:36] same morals everything raise right and
[20:40] one can turn out bad and one can and one
[20:42] turns out good
[20:43] and it shows you that you have free more
[20:47] Agency for a reason that you make that
[20:50] choice whether you want to and the thing
[20:52] is a lot of times your decisions will be
[20:54] influenced
[20:55] by your your friend's Circle the people
[20:58] that are in your life well actually they
[20:59] can influence your decisions so if you
[21:01] choose to hang out with with people that
[21:04] bring you down and aren't going places
[21:05] then guess what eventually you will
[21:08] start thinking like that
[21:09] and it's so important who are you
[21:11] surrounding yourself with
[21:13] are you surrounded with yourself with
[21:15] people who are building you up and are
[21:17] going places spiritually and and
[21:19] naturally because it's a balance as well
[21:22] or are you surrounding yourself with uh
[21:25] people that make you feel better because
[21:26] you're better than them you see what I'm
[21:28] saying because they're either they're
[21:30] going to influence you are going to
[21:31] influence them so influence is a big
[21:35] part in decision making because you're
[21:37] very influenced by the wrong Spirit
[21:38] you're going to make the wrong decision
[21:40] now the children of Israel they were
[21:42] influenced by the wrong spirit because
[21:45] they saw God time and time again making
[21:48] things happen making a way with their
[21:50] sameth no way but they were spoiled
[21:53] brats and they didn't want to take God
[21:54] of his word they didn't want to play
[21:56] their part because we play a part in our
[21:58] walk with God we don't just sit down and
[22:01] just rest we gotta fight for every inch
[22:04] we gotta fight for every single inch yes
[22:06] the land is yours but you gotta fight
[22:08] for it tooth and nail because the devil
[22:11] does not want you to get to the source
[22:13] of God he knows when you get to that
[22:15] Source he is he is powerless he has no
[22:18] power over you he's powerless
[22:20] praise God let's go
[22:24] verse 4 and did and did all drink the
[22:27] same spiritual drink for the drink of
[22:29] that spiritual rock that followed them
[22:30] and that rock was Christ but with many
[22:33] of them God was not well pleased for
[22:35] they were overthrowing the Wilderness
[22:36] now these things were our examples now
[22:40] in this Bible isn't just some some uh
[22:43] book with just cool stories in it no
[22:46] this Bible this is real life this really
[22:48] happened it's really happened it says
[22:53] we should not lust after evil things as
[22:56] they also lusted how many times do we
[22:58] lust we we ask and we receive not
[23:00] because we we ask
[23:02] amiss
[23:04] a lot of times we make these decisions
[23:06] because all it feels good it feels good
[23:08] to my flesh I got stimulation
[23:11] but that's what God isn't asking us to
[23:13] make feel good decisions because I
[23:16] believe when you make a decision towards
[23:19] Christ your flesh shouldn't feel good
[23:22] because your your flesh is enmity
[23:24] against God your flesh hates to serve
[23:26] God right so if you're making a decision
[23:28] that's pleasing to God your flesh is
[23:30] definitely going to have a rebuttal
[23:32] rebellion and it's our job to crucify
[23:35] that
[23:36] verse seven neither be I idolaters as
[23:39] some of them were now we think I doubt
[23:42] idolatry is just you know uh making this
[23:44] microphone you know a god
[23:47] but in reality anything you put before
[23:50] God it can even be the business that God
[23:52] blessed you with I'm gonna say one more
[23:54] time it can even be the job that God
[23:57] blessed you with can become an idol in
[23:59] your life something that God has blessed
[24:01] you you can put before him
[24:04] and that's not right it's not right even
[24:07] a a brand new car that God has given you
[24:10] the finances to be able to buy it you
[24:12] could put that before God even your
[24:15] family your children your wife your
[24:17] husband you can put that before God even
[24:19] though that he blessed you with it
[24:22] so we have to have a balance of how
[24:24] we're doing things because God does not
[24:27] want to be second place not third not
[24:29] fourth but he wants to be first place no
[24:32] matter what
[24:34] and God isn't looking for your excuses
[24:36] he's not looking for my excuses he's
[24:38] looking for a believer that will put him
[24:40] first if you want growth in your life
[24:42] put God first on a daily basis every
[24:46] decision that you make every thought
[24:48] that you have even the scripture says
[24:50] put every thought into The Obedience of
[24:52] Christ that's what it tells us to do
[24:53] every thought not just some thoughts
[24:55] here and there but every thought
[24:57] challenge your mind challenge the way
[25:00] you think because the way you think is
[25:03] going to be you're going to become that
[25:04] so if you think uh if you think that
[25:07] should you amount to nothing then
[25:09] eventually you will amount to nothing
[25:10] but if you can take God in every single
[25:13] word the right mental attitude towards
[25:15] any Divine promise of God will bring it
[25:18] to pass it starts with the right mental
[25:20] attitude if your attitude is horrible
[25:23] and bad you you can never get anything
[25:25] from God how can God speak to you
[25:27] you can't
[25:28] and it's like the children of Israel
[25:30] they had a bad attitude notice that
[25:32] every time they would come against some
[25:36] trial some roadblock in their life they
[25:38] would have a bad attitude and that's
[25:41] what stopped them from going into the
[25:42] promised land yeah yeah they they could
[25:45] say uh a man from Heaven every day my
[25:47] clothes didn't wear out but when it came
[25:49] time to enter into the Holy Ghost they
[25:52] couldn't enter in because they were
[25:54] found wanting
[25:56] verse 8 neither let us commit
[25:58] fornication as some of them committed
[26:00] and fell in one day three and twenty
[26:02] thousand verse nine neither let us tempt
[26:05] Christ as some of them also tempted and
[26:07] were destroyed of serpents verse 10
[26:09] right here neither murmur yes some of
[26:12] them also murmured how how often do we
[26:15] really challenge ourselves when we start
[26:17] to murmur I think sometimes we just let
[26:19] it happen and say well I think it's okay
[26:22] in this instance you know a lot of
[26:23] things are happening to me at work and I
[26:25] think it's okay if I murmur and complain
[26:26] a little bit no but it's sitting right
[26:28] here neither murmur yes some of them
[26:30] also murmured and were destroyed of the
[26:32] Destroyer so you begin to murmur you
[26:35] lose sight of being grateful and
[26:37] thankful to God because you're
[26:39] complaining a complaining spirit is
[26:41] contagious it is it's very contagious
[26:45] now also uh now all these things happen
[26:48] unto them for end samples and they're
[26:50] written for admonition that means gentle
[26:52] reproof counseling against the fault
[26:54] instructions and duties caution and
[26:57] Direction upon whom the ends of the
[26:59] world are come so this right here was
[27:02] written for us to look at it not just to
[27:05] read it and just put it down but to
[27:07] actually study it read it so if the
[27:09] children of Israel had a same bad
[27:11] attitude then we can wind up in a
[27:13] similar situation as them not trusting
[27:16] God and wonder why our life is a
[27:17] shambles see a lot of times our life's
[27:19] in shambles because we aren't taking God
[27:21] at his word
[27:22] see it's one thing to say you believe
[27:24] but it's another thing to really believe
[27:26] I can say all day I believe but if my
[27:28] life is not lining up with God's word
[27:30] and that and it's not God's word lineup
[27:33] but your life but your life lying up
[27:35] with God's word that's the key you gotta
[27:37] mold to the word of God not the word of
[27:38] God mode to you see a lot of times
[27:40] people want to uh they want a gospel
[27:42] they wanna one of Jesus that that just
[27:45] supplies all their needs and they do
[27:46] nothing
[27:47] do it they accept them as Savior and oh
[27:50] I go to I'll go to church Jesus on
[27:51] Sunday but you know uh anything else
[27:53] outside of that other six days out the
[27:55] week I want to live for myself
[27:57] how do you ever expect your life to get
[27:58] in order I never will
[28:02] notice the children of Israel had a
[28:04] choice whether to take God of his word
[28:06] or doubt God that or doubt that God
[28:10] could take him to the promised land
[28:11] notice that the children made a decision
[28:14] based solely upon emotions they were
[28:17] always constantly basing their decision
[28:20] upon emotions that's why they complained
[28:22] and murmured all the time because they
[28:24] were looking at their emotions they
[28:25] weren't looking at The God Who Could
[28:26] solve their problem but they were
[28:28] looking at the circumstances around it a
[28:30] lot of times if you get your eyes off of
[28:31] God you will begin to look at the
[28:34] problems in your life that you can't
[28:35] overcome them but God has called us to
[28:37] be Overcomers we said to Satan before
[28:39] it's not you necessarily and overcoming
[28:42] but it's you getting out the way so God
[28:44] can overcome it in your life because
[28:46] within ourselves we don't have the power
[28:48] to overcome but through through Jesus
[28:50] Christ I can do anything
[28:53] is no mountains too big no Valley's too
[28:57] low
[28:57] God is a god of small problems and big
[29:00] problems a lot of times we don't come to
[29:01] God because we think our problem is too
[29:03] small that you know God does God cares
[29:05] about it all it matters to the master I
[29:07] love that song it matters to the master
[29:09] your small promise matter and your big
[29:11] problems matter to God he's a God who
[29:13] cares about your needs he's a God who
[29:16] cares about your current situation right
[29:18] now if you need peace he wants to give
[29:20] you peace if you need healing he'll he
[29:23] his fountains open tonight
[29:27] amen see and they made their decision
[29:30] upon emotions and not by faith
[29:32] faith says God said the land is ours and
[29:36] your life God is saying the land is
[29:38] yours
[29:39] those giants in your land don't be
[29:41] scared of them
[29:43] don't be David wasn't scared he said
[29:45] don't let this uncircumcised Philistine
[29:47] defile the armies of the Living God he
[29:49] didn't care he had Bulldog Faith he knew
[29:51] what God did in his life with the lion
[29:54] and the bear that he's going to do the
[29:55] same thing to his uncircumcised
[29:57] Philistine because he knew it was the
[30:00] will of God he didn't have no fear not
[30:02] one bit
[30:04] now notice
[30:05] Joshua and Caleb also had those same
[30:08] choices they could have doubted God or
[30:10] took God his word and we said before
[30:12] they saw all the same things the other
[30:14] ten spies saw they saw all the things
[30:18] God did to bring them to this very point
[30:21] they experienced the mighty hand of
[30:23] Jehovah just says the others did
[30:26] and we'll pick our reading up in numbers
[30:28] 13 26-33
[30:34] numbers 13 26-33
[30:39] and they went and came to Moses and to
[30:42] Aaron into all the congregation of the
[30:44] children of Israel Into the Wilderness
[30:46] of Quran
[30:47] to Kadesh and brought back the word unto
[30:50] them and to all the congregation and
[30:52] showed them the fruit of the Lamb and
[30:54] they told them
[30:55] and said we come into the land whether
[30:57] thou Sinners us and surely it flows with
[30:59] milk and honey and this is the fruit of
[31:01] it
[31:01] nevertheless the people be strong that
[31:04] dwell in the land and the cities are
[31:06] walled and every great uh and moreover
[31:08] we saw the children of anech there I
[31:10] want to stop right here and actually go
[31:11] to Exodus 23. I just want to see
[31:15] that they they forgot that quick of what
[31:17] God promised them and going to the land
[31:20] I want to say I always want to just show
[31:22] that how quick they forgot so Exodus 23
[31:25] and go to verse 20. behold I send an
[31:28] angel before thee to keep thee in the
[31:30] way and to bring me into a place which I
[31:32] have prepared
[31:33] beware of him and obey his voice provoke
[31:36] him not God was given a warning right
[31:38] then and there he says beware of him and
[31:41] obey his voice
[31:43] provoke him not for he will not pardon
[31:45] your transgressions for my name is in
[31:46] him
[31:47] but if thou shall indeed obey his voice
[31:50] and do all that I speak then I'll be an
[31:53] enemy unto thy enemies notice that
[31:56] promise he gave them and yet they forgot
[31:58] that he said it's simple it's so simple
[32:00] he said
[32:01] but if thou shall indeed obey his voice
[32:04] you want to type that to us right now if
[32:07] you obey God's voice be obedient to him
[32:10] he's going to do these things for you
[32:12] he's going to help you conquer those
[32:14] giants he's going to help you overcome
[32:16] the person at work that hates you hates
[32:18] you to the Bone amen
[32:22] and Amy's an adversary until I
[32:24] adversaries for my angel shall go before
[32:26] thee and bring me into the amorites and
[32:29] the high tights and the presides and the
[32:30] Canaanites and the halftites and
[32:32] jezebites and I will cut them off verse
[32:34] 24 thou shall not bow down to their gods
[32:37] nor serve them nor do after their works
[32:39] but thou shall utterly overthrow them
[32:42] and quite break down their images notice
[32:45] god promise them that and they they went
[32:47] over to the land and saw all these
[32:48] things and they forgot it
[32:51] how could they forget the most important
[32:54] thing that God told him right there he
[32:56] said the land is yours he promised in
[32:59] the land and when God made a promise he
[33:01] even he when God makes a promise
[33:04] is going to happen
[33:05] simple as that
[33:07] he may not give you a time frame or how
[33:09] it's going to happen but you take him at
[33:10] your word it's like brother Roger and
[33:12] sister Trisha they were promised the
[33:14] baby
[33:15] look what happened
[33:17] God one thing God can not do he can't
[33:19] fail
[33:20] you can't
[33:22] verse 26 or verse 26 there shall nothing
[33:26] you know verse 25 I'm sorry and you
[33:28] shall serve the Lord your God he shall
[33:29] bless thy bread and thy water and I will
[33:32] take sickness away from the midst of
[33:34] thee you still doing that tonight amen
[33:36] there shall nothing there shall nothing
[33:38] cast their young nor Barren in thy land
[33:40] the number of thy days I will fulfilled
[33:42] I will send my fear before thee and will
[33:45] destroy all the people to whom Thou
[33:46] shalt come and I will make all thy
[33:48] enemies turn their backs onto thee man
[33:50] I'm reading this I'm just like wow they
[33:53] miss this they they they don't remember
[33:55] this but Joshua and Caleb did I'll tell
[33:58] you that they caught the vision that God
[34:00] had they caught The Vision by faith and
[34:03] the same thing we have to do is catch
[34:05] that same vision by faith because God
[34:08] wants to
[34:09] take the Giants out your life but you
[34:11] have to be willing to recognize that he
[34:13] can destroy any Giant in your life and
[34:16] don't just live with the Giant
[34:18] but conquer that giant in your life
[34:21] and I will send the Hornets before thee
[34:23] which shall drive out the have lights
[34:24] and the canines look at all these things
[34:26] God promised to do and the High Tides
[34:27] but for before Thee I will not drive
[34:29] them up before thee in one year unless
[34:31] the land become desolate and the Beast
[34:32] of the field multiply against it by
[34:34] little and little I will drive them out
[34:36] from before thee until thou be increased
[34:38] and inherit the land I I just look God's
[34:41] faithful
[34:42] and notice a decision that the children
[34:45] of Israel made Joshua and Caleb had to
[34:48] bear the consequences of it but guess
[34:50] what I'll tell you one thing they did
[34:51] not murmur complain one time they didn't
[34:54] they were like okay
[34:56] hey we still believe God he's going to
[34:57] take us to the promised land he promised
[35:00] on where we at we were at um let's
[35:02] finish numbers uh 13. I'll go back to
[35:04] numbers 13.
[35:11] I think we're at verse 28 I believe
[35:13] I mean time just flies huh
[35:16] first uh verse uh 29 or verse 28
[35:18] nevertheless the people be strong that
[35:21] dwell in the land and the cities are
[35:22] walled in every great and wherever we
[35:24] saw the children of annex there notice
[35:26] the excuses if you begin to make excuses
[35:29] in your life that means you're doubting
[35:31] God
[35:32] you will start doubting God eventually
[35:35] if your life is just filled with excuses
[35:37] you will doubt God and not even realize
[35:39] it that's how dangerous that that spirit
[35:42] is
[35:46] and the Amica is the world on there land
[35:48] of the South and the high tides and
[35:49] jezebites and amorites and they they
[35:52] forgot God said I'm going to get you out
[35:54] this land I'm gonna I'm gonna get these
[35:55] people off the land for I'm gonna help
[35:56] you see I think what they wanted was
[35:58] they wanted to just sit back and relax
[36:00] and God just destroy everything they
[36:03] didn't want to do anything
[36:05] and same thing we feel that same way in
[36:07] our life when we got Giants in our life
[36:08] addictions Deliverance whatever it is we
[36:10] think that God should just you know wave
[36:12] some magic wand and say it'd be gone but
[36:15] God is looking for you to get serious
[36:17] about that thing in your life
[36:19] says draw nigh to God and he'll draw an
[36:21] eye to you it doesn't say you lay down
[36:24] in your bed and he's going to draw an
[36:25] eye to you and you do nothing it doesn't
[36:27] say that you gotta play you play a part
[36:29] you have to put the work in just like if
[36:32] I'm working out if I work out one one
[36:34] time a month
[36:35] and I eat fast food three times a day am
[36:38] I ever gonna get in shape no
[36:40] same thing with faith if you just take
[36:43] God sometimes at his word you're never
[36:45] going to have faith in fact it's
[36:46] impossible to please God without faith
[36:48] you can't please him without faith it's
[36:49] impossible you see you have them
[36:50] children of Israel they didn't make it
[36:53] they're carcasses in the wilderness
[36:57] I love Caleb right here and Caleb Still
[36:59] the people before Moses and said let us
[37:01] go up at once and possess it for we are
[37:04] able to overcome it
[37:06] they had that Vision they had Faith they
[37:09] knew that God
[37:10] could move
[37:11] but the men went up with him and said we
[37:14] be not able to go up against the people
[37:16] for they are stronger than we there is
[37:18] doubt and God right there doubting God's
[37:20] Mighty hand
[37:22] the very God that created heavens and
[37:24] earth they're doubting that they can't
[37:26] they can't they can't overcome that
[37:28] and they brought up an evil report of
[37:30] the land which they had searched unto
[37:32] the children of Israel saying the land
[37:34] through which we have gone to search it
[37:36] is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
[37:38] thereof and all the people that we saw
[37:40] in it are men of great stature and there
[37:44] we saw the Giants and Sons of anak which
[37:46] come of the giant so we're in our own
[37:47] sight as Grasshoppers and so we are on
[37:49] their site let's go to 14.
[37:52] Chapter 14 verse one and all the
[37:54] congregation lifted up their voices and
[37:56] cried and the people wept that night
[37:58] and all the children of Israel murmured
[38:00] against Moses and against Aaron in the
[38:02] whole congregation said unto them would
[38:04] God that we have died in the land of
[38:06] Egypt or would God we had died in the
[38:08] world of this wilderness
[38:09] and wherefore hath the Lord just noticed
[38:12] that wow after God has done all these
[38:14] things for him the Brazen serpent all
[38:17] these things gave them water out of a
[38:19] rock
[38:20] fed him with Mana oh Red Sea parted and
[38:24] just drowned the Egyptians all those
[38:26] things that were done but yet
[38:28] they always talked about oh we should go
[38:30] back to Egypt you know it's always it's
[38:32] like to me that their heart never left
[38:34] from Egypt
[38:35] that they were still in some of some of
[38:37] the Believers uh the make-believers they
[38:40] were their heart was still in Egypt
[38:42] but Joshua and Caleb's heart was to God
[38:45] they knew that what God did that he
[38:47] could keep doing things like that and
[38:49] they didn't serve God just because of
[38:51] the Miracles and the signs they serve
[38:52] God because they loved him and they
[38:54] believed him
[38:57] notice they walked in with us for 40
[38:59] years
[39:00] that's love to me
[39:02] because they could have said oh they
[39:04] could have said Joshua kept saying oh
[39:05] but I got to be these game-sane people
[39:07] they I didn't make this decision God you
[39:09] saw me I made this choice but that'll be
[39:12] Pride
[39:12] you know God doesn't work with pride
[39:16] and they said one to another let us make
[39:18] a Captain Let Us return into Egypt
[39:20] then Moses and Aaron fell on their face
[39:22] before all the assembly congregation the
[39:24] children of Israel and Joshua the son of
[39:26] none and Caleb the son of Jeff forgive
[39:29] me if I said that wrong which were the
[39:31] them that searched the land rent their
[39:32] clothes and they spake unto all the
[39:35] company the children of Israel saying
[39:37] the land which we pass through to search
[39:39] it is an exceeding good land
[39:42] if the Lord I love us if the Lord
[39:44] delighted us then he will bring us into
[39:47] the land and give it to us a land which
[39:50] flows the milk or honey only Rebellion
[39:52] ye not against the Lord neither fear ye
[39:54] the people of the land
[39:56] for they are bred for us their defenses
[39:58] is departed from them and the Lord Is
[40:00] With Us fear them not but all the
[40:03] congregation bathed them Stones uh
[40:05] stoned them with stones and the glory of
[40:07] the Lord appeared in the Tabernacle of
[40:08] the congregation for all the children of
[40:10] Israel and the Lord said to Moses how
[40:12] long will this
[40:13] I'm gonna stop right there actually
[40:15] because time is uh flying but uh we want
[40:18] to just notice Joshua and Caleb saw with
[40:20] the eyes of faith not with the eyes of
[40:23] doubt they knew that their current
[40:25] situation that they're in that God can
[40:27] get him out of it so tonight we may be
[40:29] in a certain situation in our personal
[40:31] lives like we feel like we we're in a
[40:33] box and we can't get out we feel like uh
[40:37] the enemies trapped Us in prison I'll
[40:39] tell you tonight you don't have to feel
[40:40] like that anymore God is still a
[40:42] deliverer he still wants to delivery out
[40:45] of the the problem you're in like I said
[40:47] before don't look at your problem as a
[40:50] children of Israel did but look at it
[40:52] with eyes of faith that Joshua and Caleb
[40:54] did God made a way for them it may not
[40:57] have been right that moment but they
[40:59] knew that God was going to make a way
[41:01] even says in scripture they that wait
[41:03] upon the Lord shall renew their strength
[41:05] they should met up with wings as eagles
[41:07] they show run and not be where they
[41:09] shall walk and not faint so notice
[41:11] there's no time table upon that it says
[41:14] they that wait
[41:15] so it could be a month it could be an
[41:17] hour it could be two weeks I don't know
[41:19] a year it could be but you keep
[41:21] believing God's word it's like sister
[41:22] Kathleen she's believing for God's
[41:24] healing
[41:25] I don't know why I don't know why what
[41:28] God does things he does but I know one
[41:30] thing he does it perfect he knows what
[41:31] he's doing it's not his first time
[41:33] around the block he knows God knows what
[41:35] he's doing
[41:37] so sometimes God does certain things
[41:41] for somebody else we may go through
[41:43] certain situations in our life to help
[41:46] somebody else down the road it could be
[41:48] five years down the road
[41:49] God knows what he's doing in your life
[41:52] give him control of your life let him be
[41:54] the captain of your ship
[41:58] let's go to Genesis 12.
[42:03] and go to chapter one or Genesis 12 1-5
[42:06] I want to just uh talk about the father
[42:09] of our faith he had a great decision he
[42:12] had to make in his life
[42:13] very great decision
[42:15] so we'll go to verse one now the Lord
[42:17] had said unto Abram get thee out of thy
[42:20] country and from thy Kindred I always
[42:22] want to end from my father's house into
[42:24] a land that I will show thee now notice
[42:25] this this decision he had to make
[42:28] so like in 75 years old he had loved
[42:31] ones he loved dearly he might even had
[42:34] plans to retire one day or maybe he was
[42:36] retired I don't know or maybe he had all
[42:38] these things he had planned out in his
[42:39] life you know I'm gonna do this for a
[42:41] certain amount of years I'm gonna live
[42:42] here then I'm gonna die at old age
[42:44] and notice this voice spoke to him God
[42:46] spoke to him
[42:48] and he hearkened to that voice
[42:51] never hearing God before in fact he was
[42:54] an idol worshiper as we we could come to
[42:56] the conclusion in the word that he was
[42:57] an idol worshiper but he was willing to
[43:00] make that great decision that changed
[43:02] his life and impacted not only him but
[43:04] us
[43:05] right he's the father of our faith
[43:08] instead of Abraham had to make that
[43:10] mindless decision we're going to have to
[43:12] make decisions similar to that in our
[43:13] life
[43:14] let's keep it going
[43:16] and I will make of thee a great nation I
[43:18] Will Bless thee and make thy name great
[43:19] and thou shall be a blessing and I will
[43:21] bless them that bless thee and curse
[43:23] them that cursed thee and in these shall
[43:25] all families of the earth be blessed
[43:27] so Abram departed as the Lord had spoken
[43:30] unto him and lot went with him now
[43:32] notice he didn't have to weigh it and
[43:34] say well I kind of love my family
[43:37] I kind of want to do this but he said
[43:40] God I'm taking out your word
[43:42] he didn't know where was going to take
[43:43] him he didn't know where to go
[43:45] he just walked
[43:46] by faith see eyes of Faith doesn't have
[43:50] to know where God is taking them but
[43:53] eyes of Faith believe that that God is
[43:56] going to direct their footsteps as they
[43:58] walk
[43:59] because he might only light you lights
[44:01] your way one or two steps at the time
[44:03] but that's okay now if he if God showed
[44:06] you every single thing then it wouldn't
[44:07] be a faith walk
[44:09] there's probably things in our lives
[44:10] that we question man why am I going
[44:12] through this my thing to you don't
[44:14] question God
[44:15] that's like a slap in his face don't
[44:17] question god notice Abraham didn't
[44:19] question God at that moment he could
[44:21] have said God who are you uh you know
[44:23] why why do I got to do this but no he
[44:25] just said God I'm going to do this
[44:28] so Abraham departed as the Lord has
[44:30] spoke unto him and lot went with him and
[44:32] Abram was 75 years old when he departed
[44:34] out of Iran and Abraham took Sarah his
[44:36] wife and a lot of his brother's son and
[44:38] all their substance they had gathered
[44:39] and the souls they had gotten haran they
[44:42] went forth to go into the land of Canaan
[44:44] into the land of Canaan they came maybe
[44:46] tonight you're looking for God to speak
[44:47] to you for a certain situation
[44:50] but is everything in your life in order
[44:51] is a question
[44:53] if you notice Abraham had to separate
[44:56] from lot and we'll read that real quick
[44:59] we'll read that uh verse Chapter 13
[45:01] Verse five and a lot also went with them
[45:03] Abraham had flocks and hers intents in
[45:06] Atlanta was not able to Bear them that
[45:07] they might dwell together for their
[45:09] substance was not was great so they
[45:11] could not dwell together there was a
[45:13] Strife between the herdmen of Abraham's
[45:15] cattle and the Herdman of lots cattle
[45:17] and the canine and the Press tights
[45:18] dwell in the land and Abraham said in a
[45:20] lot let there be no Strife I pray thee
[45:22] between me and me and between my herdmen
[45:24] and thy Herdman for we are brother
[45:27] it's not the whole land before thee
[45:29] separate thyself I pray thee from me if
[45:32] thou will take the left hand and I will
[45:34] go to the right or if thou depart in the
[45:36] right hand then I'll go to the left
[45:38] and lot lifted up his eyes beheld all
[45:40] the plane of Jordan and it was well
[45:41] watered now a lot made his decision
[45:44] based upon the the appealing of the land
[45:48] his lifestyle he he he had appealed onto
[45:52] him
[45:54] everywhere before the Lord destroyed
[45:55] Solomon and gomor even as a garden of
[45:57] the Lord like the land of Egypt as the
[45:59] land of his or then lot shows him all
[46:01] the plain of Jordan and lot Journey East
[46:03] and they separate themselves the one
[46:05] from another notice this and then
[46:08] notice after he separated himself and
[46:10] the Lord said unto Abraham after lot was
[46:13] separated from him see God
[46:16] is looking for us to separate from
[46:18] certain things he's asking to separate
[46:20] from how do you expect God to speak to
[46:22] you if you're not being obedient to him
[46:24] if he's telling you to leave something
[46:25] or leave somebody or whatever it is or
[46:28] to leave from your selfishness or to to
[46:31] choose him as your your savior in your
[46:33] lord
[46:34] then why are we expecting God to answer
[46:36] us if we're not doing the things he's
[46:37] asking us to do that's like brother Ron
[46:40] you're so when your your kids were
[46:42] growing up and you asked them to do
[46:43] chores and you say for instance you'll
[46:45] give them allowance they didn't do their
[46:46] chores but they're still expecting an
[46:48] allowance same thing with God how do we
[46:50] expect God to move in our lives if we're
[46:52] not following God the way he's telling
[46:54] us to
[46:54] we can't just make it up we can't just
[46:56] make up as we go we got to follow that's
[46:59] what Saul tried to do in in the Old
[47:01] Testament King Saul tried to do that
[47:02] well I sacrificed these things uh
[47:05] because I wanted to give it to you as a
[47:06] burnt offering and Samuel said obedience
[47:08] is greater than sacrifice that's what
[47:10] the Lord Delights in he doesn't
[47:12] enlightened how much you can do over
[47:14] here and there and there if you're not
[47:15] being obedient to him
[47:17] okay it's good to sacrifice but if
[47:20] you're if you're not being obedient to
[47:22] God it will do you no good listen to God
[47:25] don't make him repeat itself
[47:27] multiple multiple times just listening
[47:30] to God Saul had a chance and he he
[47:32] squanders opportunity
[47:36] praise God now
[47:38] the power of decision he's a decision
[47:40] you would say some more time will make
[47:42] will not only impact you but it'll
[47:43] impact your family
[47:45] and it may not I don't have a feeling
[47:47] right now but every decision that I make
[47:49] will impact my future defense my future
[47:50] family every fight every bad financial
[47:53] decision I make will impact my future
[47:56] family every bad funny decision that we
[47:58] make is going to impact those around us
[47:59] it may not hurt you right now but
[48:01] eventually it can
[48:03] the power of decision is so important
[48:06] they said well that's why it's so
[48:08] important to pray on decisions that we
[48:10] have to make don't just assume you're
[48:12] making the right decision
[48:13] take the time and ask the Lord is this
[48:15] your will for my life if you make the
[48:17] wrong decisions we will have to pay the
[48:19] consequences we see so many examples in
[48:22] the Bible Samson
[48:24] yes he was an elective of God
[48:27] but he gave his heart to Delilah and he
[48:30] had to pay with his life
[48:33] David David had to make David had
[48:36] consequences just because you are an
[48:38] elect child of God doesn't give you a
[48:41] free passage to make any old kind of
[48:43] decision you you want and not expect
[48:45] consequences in your life there's going
[48:46] to be consequences if you choose to to
[48:49] make a wrong decision knowingly make a
[48:52] wrong decision you're going to have to
[48:53] pay for that that decision
[48:56] and God is still gracious he will still
[48:58] help you but you still have to go
[49:00] through that
[49:02] so my
[49:04] my plea to you we all have made bad
[49:06] decisions in our lives okay
[49:09] raise is everybody being truthful all
[49:12] right we all made bad decisions in our
[49:13] life
[49:14] so let's stop making bad decisions let's
[49:17] start making decisions that will please
[49:19] let's start getting the mind to Christ
[49:20] all the time every day don't just wait
[49:23] until you got to make a big decision to
[49:25] get the mind of Christ
[49:26] but get the mind of Christ every day and
[49:28] something you got to fight for you got
[49:30] to strive for because the devil does not
[49:32] want you to get it he doesn't
[49:37] let's go to Galatians 5.
[49:41] so for instance so if I'm planting a
[49:43] garden
[49:44] and I plant all the seeds I till the
[49:47] ground make everything look nice but if
[49:49] I make the decision to not to water and
[49:51] take care of it guess what's going to
[49:52] happen
[49:54] I'm a Reaper I'm gonna sow I'm gonna get
[49:56] nothing
[49:57] so same thing in your life if you choose
[49:59] to reap little in your spiritual walk
[50:01] with God then guess what you're going to
[50:03] get little if you choose to reap nothing
[50:04] you're going to get nothing
[50:06] God isn't just going to just you know do
[50:08] everything for you yeah yeah He blesses
[50:10] the Justin unjust yes I believe that 100
[50:12] amen but I don't want to just be blessed
[50:14] in that situation I want to be blessed
[50:16] in here
[50:17] my soul needs to be prospering in order
[50:19] for your soul to prosper you have to
[50:21] reap a lot
[50:23] a lot of work comes into your soul
[50:24] prospering it's not just something that
[50:26] just happens overnight but it's an
[50:28] everyday rugged life of grinding being
[50:31] disciplined being faithful to God if
[50:33] you're faithful to God he'll be faithful
[50:35] to you
[50:37] go to Galatians 5 or I think relation
[50:40] six I'm sorry
[50:47] so it says
[50:51] be not deceived God is Not Mott for
[50:55] whatsoever a man's soul that shall he
[50:57] also reap for he that soweth to his
[51:00] flesh shall the flesh reap corruption be
[51:02] that soul to the spirit shall the spirit
[51:04] reap life Everlasting and let us not be
[51:07] wearing and well doing for in due season
[51:09] we shall reap if we faint not
[51:13] it's a promise
[51:15] it's a promise right there
[51:17] that's why it's so important we said
[51:19] before to have the mind of Christ Christ
[51:21] always wanted to please the father
[51:24] his life was a life of being a servant
[51:27] he wanted to help others he wanted to
[51:29] serve others and if he's our perfect
[51:31] example we have to do the same thing
[51:34] that's why the mind of Crisis isn't a
[51:36] isn't a take it or leave it but
[51:38] something you need to be striving for on
[51:39] a daily basis
[51:41] that's what Christ had
[51:44] except for God Knows Your Potential
[51:46] inside of you he does you have potential
[51:48] if you have the Holy Ghost Inside of You
[51:50] he wants that to grow see he doesn't
[51:52] want us just to be like a seed a seed
[51:55] has to get germanized and it starts to
[51:57] grow and eventually if that seeds of
[51:59] trees and grow into a tree so God is
[52:01] expecting us to be trees that's why I
[52:04] say it's like a tree that's planted by
[52:06] the rivers of water water is singular
[52:09] and the river is is plural because the
[52:12] water because the rivers are connected
[52:14] to One Source
[52:15] that's God we've got to be we got to be
[52:18] a tree we got to grow into a tree
[52:21] for maturity we need to God expects us
[52:23] to have fruit
[52:25] I don't want to if I have an apple tree
[52:28] I expect it one day to what to Bear
[52:30] apples
[52:31] so God expects us to Bear him fruits of
[52:34] the Holy Spirit right
[52:36] yeah and in order for us to do that and
[52:38] to keep preaching our potential we must
[52:40] die to ourselves die to your will to
[52:43] your thoughts your ideas and your plans
[52:46] I know we all have plans we got all
[52:49] planned out we want to do this and that
[52:50] with our lives but sometimes God is
[52:52] going to Halt those plans and you got to
[52:54] be willing to submit to that
[52:57] because if you're not willing to submit
[52:59] to that you will be most miserable I
[53:01] promise you
[53:03] if God has to drag you he'll drag you
[53:06] except Abraham probably had plans for
[53:09] his future right had hopes he had all
[53:11] figured out what he's going to do with
[53:12] his life but he was willing to forsake
[53:14] it all
[53:15] he was willing to make a choice make a
[53:17] decision that decision not only affected
[53:19] him but affected us after
[53:22] did it not and each trial you go through
[53:25] you have two choices one you can claim
[53:28] what it says in First Peter 1 verses 327
[53:31] and keep putting the board please
[53:33] First Peter 1 chapter 3 through or
[53:37] chapter one verses three through seven
[53:39] blessed be the god of our father Lord
[53:41] Jesus Christ which according to His
[53:43] abundant Mercy has been guiding us unto
[53:45] a lively Hope by the resurrection of
[53:47] Jesus Christ from the dead amen
[53:49] to inheritance Incorruptible and
[53:52] undefiled and fadeth not away reserved
[53:55] in Heaven For You Verse 5 please
[54:01] who are kept by the power of God
[54:04] through faith notice that who are kept
[54:06] by the power of God through faith you
[54:09] play a part unto salvation ready to be
[54:12] revealed in the last time verse 6.

[54:37] so it's telling me not to complain not
[54:40] to look at it as a bad thing in my life
[54:42] but says greatly rejoice
[54:44] it's verse 7 please
[54:47] that the trial of your faith being much
[54:50] more precious than of gold that perish
[54:52] it though betrayed with fire be found
[54:54] unto the praise and honor and Glory at
[54:57] the peering of Jesus Christ that's what
[54:59] the trials are there for
[55:00] now for anything it's not because you're
[55:02] a bad kid but even says the lord loves
[55:04] you if he rebukes him chasing you if he
[55:06] lets the devil move in your life with
[55:08] situations like that it's for a reason
[55:10] and the devil doesn't even realize he's
[55:12] being used as a tool
[55:14] to help you to be in more of the image
[55:16] of God think about that the devil is
[55:18] being used as a tool to help you to get
[55:21] you more in the image of Jesus Christ
[55:23] because if you're looking at the trial
[55:27] how hard it is then you're never going
[55:28] to grow because character is a victory
[55:31] some of you had to fight after
[55:33] every time you got to fight that that
[55:35] character is not just something that's
[55:37] given so you got to fight for it
[55:41] let's go to Second Corinthians uh
[55:44] chapter 12.
[55:45] verses 9 through 11.
[55:54] praise God so go to verse 9.
[55:57] and he said unto me my grace is
[56:00] sufficient for thee imagine if we went
[56:02] to every trial like that imagine
[56:06] he said for my strength is made perfect
[56:08] in weakness
[56:10] most gladly therefore will I rather
[56:12] glory in my affirmities that the power
[56:15] of Christ May rest upon me I want to get
[56:18] there and I believe by faith I'm going
[56:19] to get there I rather glory in my
[56:21] affirmities that the power of Christ may
[56:23] be rest upon me verse 10 please
[56:25] therefore I take pleasure check this out
[56:27] in affirmities in reproaches when's the
[56:30] last time have you took pleasure in your
[56:32] infirmities and your approaches and your
[56:34] necessities and persecutions
[56:36] therefore I take pleasure and
[56:38] infirmities and reproaches and
[56:39] Necessities in distresses for Christ's
[56:43] sake for when I am weak then I am made
[56:46] strong
[56:48] that's the time when when that strength
[56:50] when you feel weak and wore down
[56:53] Christ is being lifted up let him give
[56:56] you strength to carry on don't look at
[56:58] the trial how hard to look at God
[57:00] through the trial Lord where are you
[57:03] trying to mold and shape to me help me
[57:05] to be in the right position that I could
[57:07] receive what you want me to receive
[57:09] notice the attitude compared to that
[57:12] versus the other attitude
[57:13] or you can murmur and complain like the
[57:15] children of Israel did mermian
[57:17] complaining will get you nowhere instead
[57:19] just trust God he knows what you need
[57:22] you have a choice to look at the trial
[57:24] or how hard it is but look at Jesus he
[57:27] will get you through trust the process
[57:31] do you want to go around the mountain
[57:32] once or do you want to go around
[57:34] mountain twice you have the choice
[57:36] so either you can go one time or you can
[57:38] go twice you pick or you can go three
[57:40] times you can keep on going till you get
[57:42] it
[57:43] I'd rather just get it the first time
[57:44] than I have to keep going over and over
[57:46] I don't want to walk 40 years in the
[57:48] wilderness when I could have just you
[57:49] know have a two-day Journey you know
[57:51] just saying
[57:53] so there is gold in your life God wants
[57:56] to see and that and that is God Is His
[57:59] Image in you him being manifested in you
[58:02] so each choice you make is either going
[58:06] to lead you to more of his image being
[58:08] manifested or not
[58:10] let's go to Romans 8 and we'll close
[58:12] here and I can get five more minutes may
[58:13] I
[58:17] so Romans 8
[58:20] almost done Romans 8
[58:23] um 18-23.
[58:27] so it says
[58:32] so next time you're going through a
[58:34] trial and you just feel like everything
[58:36] is going wrong just remember this for I
[58:38] reckon that the suffering thing
[58:39] sufferings of this present time are not
[58:42] worthy to be compared with the glory
[58:45] which shall be revealed in US praise God
[58:49] for the earnest expectation of the
[58:51] creature waited for the manifestations
[58:53] of the sons of God they're waiting for
[58:55] us all of us that's what they're waiting
[58:57] for
[58:59] for the creature was made subject to Van
[59:01] Vanity not willing but by the reason of
[59:04] him who have subjected the same in Hope
[59:06] because the creature itself also shall
[59:08] be delivered from the bondage of
[59:10] corruption unto the Glorious Liberty of
[59:12] the children of God for we know
[59:15] we know that we uh the whole creation
[59:18] groaneth and travaileth in pain until
[59:20] now not only they but ourselves also
[59:23] which have the first fruits
[59:26] of the spirit even ourselves are grown
[59:28] within ourselves are waiting for the
[59:29] adoption to with the Redemption of our
[59:32] body so we go through a trial think
[59:34] about that it's not it's not even worthy
[59:37] to be compared of what you're going to
[59:39] inherit what you're going to receive
[59:41] think of every trial you go through
[59:43] you're growing to be more like him
[59:46] that's why I say with the Rapture is
[59:48] happening right now
[59:49] you don't just magically become in this
[59:51] image at that very moment but every
[59:53] decision every trial that you're making
[59:55] is shaping you he's using it to shape
[59:57] and mold you so you can be ready
[1:00:00] the the battle is we're still fighting
[1:00:03] we can still get Victory God is still
[1:00:06] calling us higher God isn't calling us
[1:00:09] to sit back and recline but he's calling
[1:00:10] us
[1:00:11] to take what's rightfully ours more of
[1:00:15] him
[1:00:16] he said blessed are they who hunger and
[1:00:18] throw us at the righteousness for they
[1:00:19] shall be filled
[1:00:22] amen
[1:00:23] I'm read a quote and we will close
[1:00:26] actually I think
[1:00:28] yes
[1:00:30] the time has now come now where he got
[1:00:32] to make a decision
[1:00:34] I put this challenge to anybody to
[1:00:36] accept God's word maybe some here
[1:00:37] listening tonight maybe for the first
[1:00:39] time I don't know
[1:00:40] but take God at his word
[1:00:43] no matter what's wrong with you if you
[1:00:45] make your heart right with God and
[1:00:47] promise God that you'll serve him and
[1:00:49] then he'll take him at his word don't
[1:00:51] pay no attention to the results you have
[1:00:53] then just believe and God will bring it
[1:00:55] to pass whatever things you desire When
[1:00:58] you pray believe you receive them and
[1:01:00] they shall be given to you you shall
[1:01:03] have them if you believe you'll receive
[1:01:05] them you see what what I mean the hour
[1:01:07] is here
[1:01:09] um Lord willing uh next time I Minister
[1:01:11] actually do a little series on the power
[1:01:14] of decision
[1:01:15] uh so it's just like kind of like the
[1:01:16] the foundation of it but I just felt my
[1:01:19] heart just to continue this
[1:01:21] so this the the main thing guys are
[1:01:22] going to get the power of your decision
[1:01:24] is so important
[1:01:26] it's not only going to affect you but
[1:01:28] it's going to affect those around you
[1:01:31] so if we would Rec it's going to affect
[1:01:33] your walk with God
[1:01:34] it's going to affect everything around
[1:01:35] you so next time we make a decision
[1:01:37] let's go about it prayerfully let's
[1:01:39] think about it don't just make these
[1:01:41] willy-nilly decisions yeah it may sound
[1:01:43] good for the moment but it can affect
[1:01:45] you in the long run
[1:01:47] doesn't matter how old you are in fact
[1:01:49] when you're I believe when you're a kid
[1:01:51] you should start making this make a good
[1:01:53] decisions listen to your parents because
[1:01:55] when you choose not to listen to your
[1:01:56] parents you're creating that bad habit
[1:01:59] and as you get older you're not going to
[1:02:01] start listening to God because God has
[1:02:03] placed your parents in your life for a
[1:02:04] reason for you to listen to them to
[1:02:07] respect them honor thy father and thy
[1:02:09] mother for a reason
[1:02:10] so you want to start start off good when
[1:02:13] your mom and dad's ask you to do
[1:02:15] something just do it don't question it
[1:02:16] because when you get older you can start
[1:02:18] questioning God
[1:02:19] it is it starts it starts as a habit
[1:02:22] and it becomes something you can't can't
[1:02:25] overcome if you just just cut off at the
[1:02:27] head right now maybe you guys have been
[1:02:30] disrespectful
[1:02:31] it's okay make that change right now
[1:02:34] I don't think you can respect too much
[1:02:36] I don't think I don't matter how old you
[1:02:38] are I don't think you can respect too
[1:02:40] much respect is a lost art
[1:02:43] I want us let's be respectful as we can
[1:02:45] because how you treat others is how
[1:02:47] you're going to treat God
[1:02:49] it's the truth
[1:02:50] it's the truth praise God there's a let
[1:02:53] us stand
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:00] I just uh we'll bow our heads
[1:03:03] dear Lord Jesus we uh
[1:03:06] are they so thankful Lord that

[1:04:07] a decision right then and there Lord we
[1:04:10] want to make sure that we have the mind
[1:04:11] of God when we're making that decision

[1:04:36] and Lord Jesus we thank you for the
[1:04:38] trials may we from this day forward Lord
