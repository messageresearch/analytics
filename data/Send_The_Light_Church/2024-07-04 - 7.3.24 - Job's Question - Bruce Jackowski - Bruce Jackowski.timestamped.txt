[1:52] scripture
[1:56] says praise the Lord amen amen
[2:02] Luke 21 let's start with verse
[2:04] 29 and he spake to them a parable behold
[2:08] the Fig Tree and all the trees and when
[2:11] they now shoot forth you see and know of
[2:14] your own selves that summer is now nigh
[2:17] at hand so likewise ye when you see
[2:21] these things come to pass know ye that
[2:24] the kingdom of God is nigh at hand and
[2:27] verily I say unto you this generation
[2:29] shall not pass away till all be
[2:32] fulfilled Heaven and Earth shall pass
[2:34] away but my words shall not pass
[2:37] away and take heed to yourselves lest at
[2:41] any time your hearts be overcharged with
[2:43] surfing and drunkenness and cares of
[2:46] this life and so that day come upon you
[2:49] unawares for as a snare shall it come on
[2:52] all them that dwell on the face of the
[2:54] whole earth watch ye therefore and pray
[2:58] always that you may be counted worthy to
[3:01] escape all these things that shall come
[3:03] to pass and to stand before the son of
[3:06] man let's bow our heads for a word of
[3:09] prayer dear Lord Jesus Heavenly Father
[3:13] we are grateful for your love and your
[3:16] mercy we're grateful Lord that
[3:20] you've sent a prophet Lord to open our
[3:22] eyes and you've been merciful to us and
[3:26] I pray father tonight that you be
[3:27] merciful to us again and Lord that
[3:30] you'll speak to every heart that's here
[3:33] Lord that you open our eyes and our
[3:35] understanding and I pray father that
[3:37] you'll be this the Unseen guest the
[3:41] Supreme King the Lord of lords speak
[3:44] through US Lord we love you and we thank
[3:46] you Father for all these things in Jesus
[3:49] Christ's name we ask it amen amen you
[3:53] may be
[3:54] seated praise the Lord so I'd like to
[3:58] speak to you for a little while on job's
[4:05] question
[4:09] amen so we all see and and another
[4:15] another thing I want to tell you is
[4:19] that this is this message I I want to
[4:23] get right in your
[4:26] face maybe not like that but
[4:29] I this message is for each one of you
[4:36] individually now you can can say no no
[4:39] no no but don't don't say no no no no no
[4:42] because there's no trick questions I
[4:44] always laugh when I go out some places
[4:47] and I'll I'll come up with some
[4:49] statement and then everybody will look
[4:51] at me and because there's no trick
[4:53] question this message is for you
[4:58] individually
[5:00] so I want you to listen
[5:04] carefully I do I want you to listen
[5:08] carefully so Jesus speaking to the
[5:11] disciples he says be told the Fig Tree
[5:13] and all the trees and when they now
[5:15] shoot forth you he didn't say I'm going
[5:19] to tell you but you
[5:21] yourself see and know of your own selves
[5:26] that summer is now nigh at hand
[5:30] you don't have to have somebody explain
[5:32] it to you you you already know in your
[5:35] own self that God is doing
[5:39] something and he makes this statement he
[5:41] says so this generation shall not pass
[5:43] away shall all be fulfilled and when Don
[5:46] and I were sitting on the front porch we
[5:47] were talking about that I said do you
[5:48] know all the people that we know that
[5:51] have passed on and have died and and
[5:55] we're still believing this
[5:57] scripture but Jesus Al also told all of
[6:01] us all of us together Heaven and Earth
[6:04] shall pass away but my word shall not
[6:08] pass away so take heed to
[6:11] yourselves so what that means he says so
[6:14] pay attention be cautious give
[6:19] attendance to
[6:21] yourself lest at any times your heart be
[6:24] overcharged and that means
[6:27] burdened with surfeiting and surfeiting
[6:30] is a headache or a seizure of pain from
[6:33] drunkenness commonly known as a
[6:37] hangover so the way things the tree and
[6:40] everything's come into bud and
[6:42] everything else and he says so when you
[6:44] see all these things you know yourself
[6:47] that the coming of the Lord is at is at
[6:49] hand so he says you need to pay
[6:51] attention you need to be
[6:54] cautious lest at any time you be
[6:57] burdened with a headache because of the
[7:00] things that are coming on the face of
[7:02] the
[7:03] Earth and if you've ever had a hangover
[7:06] which I don't know if you have or not
[7:08] but you're very
[7:10] useless everything in the room is
[7:12] spinning the loud noises really upset
[7:15] you and everything else and and that
[7:18] that is how
[7:20] people
[7:23] they've he says don't be like
[7:27] that don't let your heart hearts become
[7:30] burdened with a headache or a seizure of
[7:32] pain and and overtaken with drunkenness
[7:36] and of course drunkenness is is the
[7:39] right thing which is you know drinking
[7:43] wine Jesus drank wine they said here
[7:46] comes a wine bibber but he said be not
[7:49] drunk with wine in
[7:51] excess but he says don't be you know
[7:55] when people do that when they when they
[7:58] go on a binge drinking
[7:59] they lose control of their
[8:02] self-control and one of the steps on the
[8:05] statute of a perfect man is
[8:07] temperance which is
[8:09] self-control this is not an hour for you
[8:11] to lose your control right amen and be
[8:16] caught up with the cares of this life so
[8:19] that that day the problem is is that the
[8:23] pressures and everything because look at
[8:25] what he says here in in verse 35 he says
[8:28] for as a snare shall it come on all them
[8:32] that dwell on the face of the whole
[8:34] earth so it's it's coming there's
[8:38] nothing you can do about it and but make
[8:42] sure that you are keeping your focus
[8:46] where it needs to be
[8:48] amen he says watch ye therefore and pray
[8:51] always that you may be accounted worthy
[8:54] to escape all these things that shall
[8:58] come to pass
[9:01] you're not going to stop
[9:03] it it's
[9:06] coming amen it's
[9:09] common brother brandom in
[9:11] Hebrews he said he said brother and I'm
[9:14] going to say sister a long time ago
[9:17] before the world was ever had a
[9:19] foundation to it God through his eternal
[9:22] Grace he looked down and by for
[9:25] knowledge he seen you and I individually
[9:30] I don't want you to think of somebody
[9:31] else he saw you and
[9:37] I
[9:40] amen and he knew what age we would live
[9:46] in by his for knowledge he knew what
[9:49] hour to place
[9:52] you he placed you in this age he didn't
[9:56] place you in the age where they're going
[9:57] to burn you at the stake and that's to
[9:59] be the end of it he didn't put you in
[10:02] the age when when uh the black plague
[10:05] was going on and and other things were
[10:07] going on but he put you in this age by
[10:10] his foreign knowledge he saw you he
[10:13] knows you he knows you as an
[10:17] individual and he knew what age we would
[10:20] live in and he knew what we would be
[10:24] like he knew what brother Marty's going
[10:26] to be like he knew what I'm going to be
[10:28] like he even knows all my faults he
[10:31] knows brother beckman's faults he knows
[10:34] them brother Keith no sense hiding
[10:37] them he knows you and he placed you in
[10:43] this age with these pressures with these
[10:48] things he placed you
[10:51] here therefore by
[10:54] election he chose us before the
[10:57] foundation of the world to be with
[11:00] him without
[11:03] spy now his word says Heaven and Earth
[11:06] is going to pass away but he said my
[11:08] word will not pass away so individually
[11:12] he has already seen you perfected
[11:16] without
[11:20] spot don't put it on somebody else say
[11:23] oh no I don't want to I Brother Bruce I
[11:24] don't want to take I I'm just want to
[11:26] sit and listen no I want you to hear me
[11:29] hey he already seen you without
[11:32] spot and he placed you in this age in
[11:37] this hour at this
[11:41] time in the Rapture
[11:43] message brother Brom said so God leted
[11:46] his word out to each age in each one of
[11:51] those ages has to manifest
[11:54] that so the word that God has reserved
[11:58] for this this hour has to come to
[12:03] fruit they ate the fruit that that God
[12:06] was looking for the Peaceable fruit that
[12:08] he was looking for in Noah's age has
[12:11] already been
[12:13] harvested the fruit that God was looking
[12:15] for in Moses's age has already been
[12:19] harvested and now in this age God knows
[12:23] you and he's placed you here and he has
[12:28] word that that he's
[12:30] foreordained for you to
[12:32] fulfill nobody else can fulfill it
[12:36] nobody else can walk in your shoes
[12:38] nobody can walk in my
[12:40] shoes so brother brandham said he
[12:43] foreordained men for that age to fulfill
[12:46] that word every time he lied his word he
[12:49] lied a man for it and when he lied
[12:51] Moses's time he led Moses to it when he
[12:54] lotted the time for the Son of God to be
[12:56] born he led him to it every age he's
[12:59] sladed his man foreordained as the Bible
[13:02] has
[13:04] said so in the identified Masterpiece
[13:06] brother bandam says so it's all lotted
[13:09] out here in the Bible it's right all
[13:11] laid out and Jesus said that thing that
[13:15] Bible that word will not fall to the
[13:18] ground that word cannot be broken
[13:22] whatever I send it for it shall
[13:24] accomplish whatever I sent it for amen
[13:29] so he says so it's all LED out here in
[13:31] the Bible and we have got to know the
[13:34] age and the hour and what it is for
[13:39] us
[13:44] individually and there is where we're
[13:45] failing today we're reading everything
[13:49] else but the Bible oh wait a
[13:53] minute did you see that on Instagram
[13:55] brother ran did you see that just
[13:57] now oh man
[14:00] I had to get over to Twitter and see
[14:01] what's
[14:05] going yeah oh it must be real because
[14:08] it's on my phone and it's got 27,000
[14:11] likes and and 25 of those thousand are
[14:14] believers that I have personally
[14:21] met a prophet that God had sent to
[14:25] us said we are reading everything else
[14:28] but the
[14:30] Bible and this is the day that we should
[14:33] be living this is the day that God has
[14:36] placed us
[14:39] here so let's look in the word
[14:43] amen and then
[14:45] remember always remember this if you
[14:49] ever were in God's
[14:51] thinking you will always be
[14:55] there if he called you if you heard his
[15:00] voice one
[15:02] time you're far better than a lot of
[15:06] people amen you will always be there if
[15:11] you've got eternal life you are the
[15:14] expression or the attribute of his
[15:18] thought for this
[15:23] age because Wesley already played his
[15:26] part Luther already played his part
[15:30] brother brandom already played his part
[15:33] all the people that were in the healing
[15:34] campaigns they played their part all the
[15:37] ones that followed brother brandham and
[15:39] used to have the real real tapes and
[15:40] then they had the cassettes and then
[15:41] they had this and then they had that you
[15:43] know Billy Paul's passed on everyone has
[15:46] done their part but God has
[15:49] foreordained a word for each one of you
[15:55] individually to fulfill in this
[15:59] age and by his infinite wisdom and his
[16:03] wisdom is better than his ways are past
[16:05] finding out by his infinite wisdom by
[16:08] his infinite knowledge by his infinite
[16:11] intelligence he has chosen you above
[16:14] your brethren and placed you in this
[16:19] age in this
[16:23] hour praise the
[16:27] Lord got a nail that one down
[16:32] friends job we're talking about job
[16:37] right let's go back here to Job chapter
[16:41] 1
[16:44] amen so I want you to think about that
[16:51] when we we'll will'll when we get into
[16:55] some of
[16:56] this and job 1:1 it says there was a
[17:02] man in the land of O whose name was job
[17:07] and that man was perfect and upright and
[17:10] one that feared God and ued
[17:14] Evil now I want to break that down for
[17:16] you he was upright which means he was
[17:20] complete or morally usually morally
[17:23] Pious he was specifically
[17:26] gentle he was
[17:29] coupled together which he had his act
[17:31] together he was perfect he was plain he
[17:35] was undefiled and he was
[17:38] upright that is
[17:43] you that is
[17:46] you right now in this
[17:51] age that's what you
[17:55] are a perfect and upright man
[17:59] somebody who feared God and that means
[18:03] somebody who's morally
[18:05] reverent morally reverences God how many
[18:09] want to raise their hand and say no I
[18:10] don't believe this message I don't want
[18:12] to take I'm not job I'm not there I'm
[18:16] you well you're making the Bible a liar
[18:18] then
[18:20] you reverence God I don't have to ask
[18:24] you I know you reverence God you have
[18:27] trouble seeing yourself perfect but
[18:30] you're
[18:31] perfect you're not perfect in your own
[18:33] eyes you're perfect in his eyes you've
[18:36] been washed by the blood of the Lamb
[18:38] what did you think that
[18:40] was it made you perfect made you clean
[18:43] and asew he says one that feared God and
[18:47] ASU evil and ASU means to turn off
[18:51] literally or figuratively decline depart
[18:55] from turn away from which one of you
[18:59] today is running towards
[19:04] sin so you is Che
[19:07] evil you're just like
[19:10] job you're perfect in God's sight you're
[19:14] upright don't you strive to be upright
[19:16] if I mean I can't believe people would
[19:18] come to church and not strive to be
[19:21] upright when God saved me my whole life
[19:24] turned upside down everything became new
[19:27] I now long longer did the things I used
[19:30] to do I now do different
[19:32] things and I don't work towards being
[19:36] evil I decline that when I get the
[19:39] chance I turn it down am I get rid of it
[19:43] I don't have it
[19:44] around
[19:46] amen
[19:49] amen now I want you to notice because
[19:52] everybody pretty much knows the story of
[19:56] job if you go down to verse 8
[20:01] God the Bible says and the Lord said
[20:05] unto Satan hast thou considered my
[20:08] servant job that there is none like him
[20:11] in the
[20:13] earth a perfect and an upright man one
[20:17] that feareth God and asth Evil it's
[20:20] exactly the same thing that was written
[20:22] in verse
[20:24] one but in verse one the author was
[20:26] writing it we don't know who the author
[20:28] was
[20:29] but in verse 8 it was God testifying how
[20:33] great a servant job
[20:36] was
[20:40] Amen brother brandom says in the
[20:42] atonement he says so now when job the
[20:44] oldest book in the Bible that's written
[20:46] perhaps before Genesis was even written
[20:49] and it was included in the Bible you
[20:51] know Moses wrote The Genesis job in his
[20:54] book he rested solemnly upon the promise
[20:58] God had made
[21:01] him do you believe acts
[21:04] 238
[21:05] am right if I repent and I'm baptized in
[21:09] the name of Jesus Christ I shall receive
[21:12] the gift of the Holy
[21:14] Ghost and how many believe that they
[21:17] truly been born
[21:19] again and if you believe you've truly
[21:21] been born again then you're no longer a
[21:24] creature of this world you're a creature
[21:25] of God you are now a Son of God born In
[21:31] His
[21:32] Image praise the Lord
[21:34] amen amen and brother brandom says he
[21:38] says job only had one you know he only
[21:43] had one part of the word revealed to
[21:47] him so I want you to look at verse
[21:51] five so it says and it was so now
[21:54] remember this perfect man this man that
[21:56] is chewed evil and he loved God God and
[21:59] and he he he did all the right things
[22:02] and brother sister I know that's your
[22:04] heart I don't even have to wonder you
[22:07] know any I know that's your heart but
[22:10] you've got to believe it with all of
[22:12] your
[22:14] heart and it was so when the days of
[22:16] this feasting were gone about and this
[22:18] is talking about his children that job
[22:20] sent and Sanctified them and he rose up
[22:24] early in the morning and offered burnt
[22:25] offerings according to the number of
[22:27] them all
[22:29] job Sanctified his children by an
[22:34] offering they didn't do
[22:37] anything they weren't it was
[22:40] Job saying this sacrifice is what gives
[22:44] me favor with God and even though my
[22:47] children are not doing the right things
[22:49] I'm sanctifying them by offering the
[22:51] same thing for
[22:54] them he did that
[22:58] he said because it may be that my sons
[23:01] have sinned and cursed God in their
[23:04] hearts and thus did job
[23:08] continually job did
[23:10] that without any evidence from God that
[23:14] it
[23:17] worked because God brother brandom
[23:21] said if the church could ever get to the
[23:24] place to where it could solemnly rest
[23:27] upon God's Eternal Word to be the
[23:32] truth job had just a little bit of word
[23:35] to fulfill and that little bit of word
[23:38] was if I make this sacrifice Jehovah God
[23:42] will sanctify and forgive me of my sins
[23:46] and because my children they could have
[23:48] possibly done this I am going to do it
[23:51] and brother Brenham said you see the
[23:53] church if it could ever get to that
[23:57] place that they could solemnly rest upon
[24:00] the Eternal Word to be the truth what a
[24:02] difference there would be what a
[24:03] correcting there would be what a cutting
[24:05] away there would be what a joy there
[24:07] would be what a power there would be
[24:09] when men and women would take God at
[24:12] face value and what he said is the
[24:16] truth you wondering why you're
[24:18] discouraged and why you're down because
[24:20] you don't believe God and His word you
[24:24] need to take him at his word but I don't
[24:27] see any evidence of still take him at
[24:29] his word he cannot
[24:31] lie
[24:34] amen no matter what the circumstances
[24:37] look like that has nothing to do with it
[24:40] God said so and that should settle
[24:43] it and job when he was in the most
[24:46] trying time of all of his experiences
[24:49] when he had been found in the presence
[24:51] of God a just
[24:55] man in the presence of God job was
[25:00] justified in God's presence every one of
[25:04] you has been
[25:08] Justified
[25:12] amen even God said he was
[25:15] perfect wow there was none like him in
[25:19] the
[25:20] earth and Satan was given the privilege
[25:23] to tempt
[25:26] him amen
[25:30] the devil was given the privilege to
[25:33] tempt
[25:34] him and he said to God I'll make him
[25:37] curse you to his
[25:39] face and he almost took job's life and
[25:42] he would have done it but God draw a
[25:44] boundy line and said you can do nothing
[25:46] you can do anything you want to him but
[25:48] you can't take his
[25:50] life I I I remember this so clear in my
[25:54] mind I was I was at work I had all this
[25:56] pressure all these things going on
[25:58] things and things were really it was bad
[26:03] and I was under a lot of stress and
[26:05] everything else and all of a sudden in
[26:08] my the owner of the company called me on
[26:10] the phone and he says
[26:12] Bruce come up here to my office and I
[26:16] knew I was in
[26:17] trouble I said yes Vince I'll I'll and I
[26:20] hung up my phone and clear his
[26:25] day that scripture
[26:28] came to
[26:31] me pilate looked at Jesus and said do
[26:34] you know I have power over
[26:37] you and Jesus said you have no power
[26:39] over me except my Father in heaven give
[26:41] it to you and that scripture just came I
[26:45] mean it just blared me in my face and I
[26:49] just sat back and
[26:50] said what I never thought about
[26:54] that I didn't know he can't touch he
[26:56] can't touch me he can't even fire me he
[27:00] can't kick me out because I know God
[27:04] placed me here and when God's done with
[27:07] me he will take me away and give me
[27:09] something else to do amen that's the God
[27:13] I serve that's the god you
[27:16] serve you have to believe that that has
[27:20] to become part of your life not just oh

[27:25] songs I'm doing this I'm no brother it
[27:28] has to become part of your life
[27:33] Amen brother Brenham said he said in my
[27:36] redeemer liveth he says did you ever
[27:37] stop to think this morning as far as
[27:40] returning that is it had become visible
[27:43] and he's talking about the second coming
[27:45] of
[27:46] Christ he is already here with us
[27:50] now so I want you to look look at the
[27:54] chair next to
[27:56] you do you realize that angels are here
[28:01] right now in another
[28:06] dimension he said he's here with us now
[28:10] and he now today just imagine that his
[28:13] presence is here today the Lord Jesus is
[28:17] in another world or another dimension
[28:19] right here today in the form of his
[28:21] Spirit his spirit is blending in with
[28:24] our spirit and that's what makes us
[28:26] righteous
[28:28] because we can't be
[28:30] righteous we
[28:34] can't I SAR like a
[28:38] sailor I lost a promotion because I
[28:41] swore too
[28:42] [Laughter]
[28:43] much guy said I was going to make you
[28:45] assistant manager he says but there's
[28:47] something wrong with you
[28:48] Bruce you swear too
[28:51] much and when I started coming to the
[28:53] Lord and I heard a man preach and he
[28:56] said and if you want to change in your
[28:57] life he says you just come up here and
[28:59] pray he says we'll pray for you and I
[29:02] said oh you don't have to ask me twice I
[29:05] run up Donna was with me yeah I mean
[29:08] think she probably thought I was nuts I
[29:10] had never been I mean I was raised
[29:12] Presbyterian you don't do alter calls in
[29:14] the pray we don't do any of this stuff I
[29:16] came up front I didn't even know how to
[29:18] hold my
[29:19] hands I didn't even know how to pray I
[29:21] know the Lord's Prayer and I knew the
[29:24] Apostles Creed and and that's it and I
[29:28] got up front and this guy he prayed
[29:30] prayed over all of us and I said okay
[29:32] whatever
[29:34] help and I went home halfway through
[29:38] work the next day I wasn't even saved
[29:40] wasn't baptized wasn't n made no
[29:43] confession of Faith nothing else nothing
[29:45] nothing nothing swearing was gone
[29:51] God that is not just for
[29:56] me it's for for all of you amen
[30:02] this and his presence is here right now
[30:07] it's just in another
[30:10] dimension the Lord Jesus is in another
[30:12] dimension right here today in the form
[30:14] of his spirit and his spirit is blending
[30:16] in with our spirit and our eyes can't
[30:18] see him because well we're physical
[30:21] unless there would be something
[30:22] happening to us that we could see a
[30:24] vision but he is here just as visible
[30:27] he's just as real as he was on the day
[30:29] he spoke to Mary at the grave or when he
[30:31] met kopus on his road to EMAs his
[30:34] presence is
[30:36] here he's here he's sitting next to you
[30:41] he's walking with you sister
[30:43] Lyn everywhere I go he's by my
[30:48] side you know job that just think about
[30:52] that you think you think well here's job
[30:55] job's down here on Earth and then
[30:58] somewhere up in heaven the sons of God
[31:01] presented themselves before the Lord and
[31:03] Satan came along the way but it was just
[31:05] it was just as far away as job could
[31:08] have sucked his hand out and touched
[31:11] God because he's that close to us that's
[31:15] his
[31:17] promise and that conversation between
[31:20] job and Satan was right one arms one
[31:23] arms length
[31:24] away and God's looking at him said no no
[31:28] this
[31:29] guy he fears me he's
[31:33] Reverend now the thing
[31:36] is you have to step into
[31:39] that you can't just come and and listen
[31:43] and hope that it'll happen you've got to
[31:46] step into the word of
[31:49] God you've got to say you know what I
[31:52] have enough evidence I have enough
[31:54] things happen in my life that I am sure
[31:57] that God God has elected me I am sure
[32:00] that God knew me before the foundation
[32:02] of the world I am sure that he saved me
[32:06] I am sure amen amen
[32:13] amen but job had this
[32:16] question because all of us all of us
[32:20] everyone that's sitting here
[32:22] today we have an an kny problem that we
[32:27] can't get an answer
[32:29] to everybody us every one of us we got a
[32:33] question that we can't get an answer
[32:36] to I remember I I remember after we we
[32:40] had
[32:42] we our third
[32:44] child was a baby boy my wife miscarried
[32:48] at seven and a half
[32:49] months and that was our third
[32:53] miscarriage we're not even talking about
[32:55] the other ones but that one was that one
[32:56] and we had gone to at church service
[32:58] we're in this meeting and and the
[33:00] preaching it really it really got to me
[33:02] and I went up and I cried at the altar I
[33:05] probably cried at the altar for a half
[33:07] hour I wanted God talk to me what why
[33:11] why is all this you're killing my wife
[33:14] you're breaking her heart and and
[33:18] I
[33:20] and as a theologians have said the
[33:22] silent God sat with his arms crossed
[33:31] so we have to find ourselves in the
[33:34] scriptures and I didn't know these
[33:36] scriptures existed till I heard a
[33:38] brother preaching just a little while
[33:39] ago and I went I didn't know that was in
[33:43] there but let's go to job 23 we're going
[33:45] to look at the whole
[33:49] chapter so
[33:52] job everything was you know he knew he
[33:55] he feared God he
[33:58] he did the offering he did it in faith
[34:01] he did it in trust there God didn't come
[34:04] back and you know he just he was a
[34:06] successful businessman and he had a
[34:08] family and he had all these thing and
[34:10] all of a sudden everything turned upside
[34:13] down and everything went against him and
[34:16] then his friends
[34:19] came and he's got some great
[34:22] friends his friends showed up and they
[34:25] said you know if you'd have fasted more
[34:29] this would have never happened if You'
[34:32] have prayed more this would have never
[34:34] happened if you'd have done this if
[34:37] you'd have given more in ad missions and
[34:39] oh if you hadn't skipped paying your
[34:41] ties that time oh God would oh you know
[34:45] you're a secret
[34:47] sinner now think about Job who God had
[34:51] already testified as a upright man who
[34:55] feared God ASU evil and he's just an arm
[34:58] length away from his
[35:01] servant he's just an arm length
[35:05] away and now he's covered with
[35:08] boils and his wife's turned against him
[35:12] and he's out on the ash Heap and he's
[35:15] wandering but the one thing he's holding
[35:17] on to is the word of God the promise of
[35:21] God he's holding on to the promise of
[35:24] God but I want you to see how he answers
[35:27] this
[35:28] he says job answered and said even today
[35:32] my complaint is bitter my stroke is
[35:36] heavier than my
[35:37] groaning he was his complaint complaint
[35:41] means his
[35:43] contemplations his babblings his
[35:47] prayers my prayer is
[35:52] bitter he says and the stroke is heavier
[35:55] than my groaning the boils of around me
[35:58] and the trials of this problem that I
[36:01] can't get an answer
[36:03] because I I'm seeking you
[36:08] Lord but it's heavier than my groaning
[36:12] oh that I knew where I might find him
[36:15] that I might come even to his
[36:18] seat have you ever been like that you
[36:20] say oh Lord you've got to move on this
[36:22] situation you got to help me where is he
[36:26] how can I get to his feet seat how can I
[36:28] find
[36:30] him brother renam said he said and be
[36:33] certain of God he said those
[36:34] circumstances will seem to F fall from
[36:37] right to left but that faith never
[36:42] moves because you are certain that he is
[36:46] God and if he is God he will keep his
[36:51] promise he can't make a promise and
[36:54] break it if he's God he's got to keep
[36:58] his promise oh how I love
[37:03] that oh wait a minute I got another my
[37:06] Twitter feed just went
[37:10] off
[37:12] oh you
[37:17] see when the church quits reading their
[37:21] Twitter
[37:23] feed and starts reading the
[37:25] Bible and believing in the
[37:29] Bible
[37:32] amen but sometimes brother Bram said he
[37:35] said but sometimes God lets Affliction
[37:38] hit his people to test them for their
[37:44] faith test them for their
[37:48] faith now the devil will tell you it's
[37:51] because you do a secret sinner you did
[37:53] something wrong you didn't stand up you
[37:56] you know you're not perfect in all your
[37:58] ways but you're perfect in all your ways
[38:00] in God's sight Amen brother Brenham said
[38:04] he said so sometimes God lets
[38:06] afflictions HIIT his people to test them
[38:08] for their faith he was testing a saint
[38:12] not rebuking a sinner I like
[38:16] that he was testing him and God does
[38:20] that to test Jesus said the scripture
[38:22] says that every son that cometh to God
[38:24] must be tried and tested and child
[38:27] trained
[38:27] and then they're proven to be the right
[38:30] children of God are you the right
[38:32] children of God then why are you
[38:35] listening to a foster
[38:39] father the devil was my foster father he
[38:42] wasn't my real
[38:46] father why am I listening to
[38:50] him job said oh if I could if I could
[38:55] just pray through
[38:58] if I could find him that I might come
[39:00] even to a seat I would I would order my
[39:03] cause before him and fill my mouth with
[39:05] arguments I would tell him all the
[39:06] reasons why God you shouldn't do this to
[39:09] me don't do this to my family don't do
[39:11] this to my children don't
[39:18] don't I would know the words which he
[39:21] would answer me and then I would
[39:24] understand what he would say unto me I
[39:26] would know why I'm going through this
[39:28] trial I wouldn't know why that's all I
[39:30] want is I want to know
[39:32] why I just want to know why brother
[39:38] Mary will he plead against me with his
[39:42] great
[39:44] power will he slap me around because
[39:47] he's God and I'm just
[39:51] dust no but he will put strength in
[39:56] me amen
[39:58] look at no look at job he had an
[40:03] absolute amen do you have an absolute

[40:18] it he had an absolute everything that
[40:21] went wrong for that man and he was a
[40:24] just man and now we be D person to say
[40:27] that he wasn't just because God said he
[40:29] was and there was no one on earth like
[40:32] job he was perfect in the sight of God
[40:34] and he knew it because he had the
[40:36] ultimate he had an
[40:38] absolute you think he had an ultimate he
[40:41] had an absolute One

[41:04] Instagram brother
[41:08] Mary

[41:15] an absolute and when everything seemed
[41:17] to be contrary when sickness broke out

[42:33] find
[42:36] him I look behind

[42:44] him cuz he's that far
[42:51] away and on the left hand where he doth
[42:54] work but I cannot Behold Him
[42:58] I can't see what he's doing I can't see
[43:00] what the purpose is why would you drag
[43:02] me through this why would you turn
[43:04] everything upside down why why Lord

[43:45] steps his way have I kept and I have not
[43:50] declined I haven't deliberately broken
[43:52] any of the word of God I haven't I
[43:54] haven't cursed him to his face I you

[44:11] one scripture and yet he had the same
[44:14] questions that you have he just wanted
[44:17] an
[44:18] answer yet God didn't tell
[44:23] him my foot have held his steps his way
[44:27] have I kept and not declined and neither
[44:29] have I gone back from the Commandment of
[44:31] his lips see job knew his own heart he
[44:35] says I haven't I'm doing what he told me
[44:38] to do I have esteemed the words or the
[44:42] promise of his mouth more than my
[44:44] necessary food because he kept that word
[44:48] if I burn if I offer a burnt sacrifice I
[44:53] am
[44:54] justified and I will not turn from that
[44:57] that no matter what the devil does for
[44:59] me that's what job
[45:02] said
[45:06] amen but he is in he is in one mind and
[45:11] who can turn
[45:14] him yeah brother Bernie I mean really

[45:27] people don't want to hear that they
[45:28] don't want to hear preaching that really
[45:30] gets right down where you're
[45:32] living but you know that's that's the
[45:35] truth of
[45:36] it and when I looked for him I couldn't
[45:39] find him when I looked behind I couldn't
[45:42] see him I didn't know what he was
[45:44] working I didn't know what he wanted
[45:46] from
[45:48] me but I will not turn from his
[45:51] word I will not leave his
[45:55] side I will not leave this message I
[45:58] will not leave the word of
[46:01] God Amen you see it's right
[46:09] there he is of one mind and who can turn
[46:12] him and what his soul desireth even that
[46:17] he
[46:18] doeth for he performed a thing that he
[46:21] appointed for me and many such things
[46:24] are with
[46:25] him many many trials many tests many
[46:28] things that he's done things that we
[46:30] can't never explain and we pray and we
[46:33] ask God God why are you doing this why
[46:35] why is it got to be like this why did
[46:36] you take this away from me why did you
[46:38] do that why did you and he's of one mind
[46:40] because he's got some word that he's
[46:44] about to fulfill and you are the only
[46:47] vessel that can fulfill that
[46:51] word I can't do it for
[46:54] you amen
[47:03] Amen brother brandom
[47:05] says this I I read this uh testimony
[47:10] many many years ago and it always stuck
[47:13] with me I want you to listen this is a
[47:15] prophet I don't know what caused me to
[47:17] do it but I said Lord God you owe me an
[47:22] understanding after me going out there
[47:25] and telling that husband and him coming
[47:27] to the Lord after you done all these
[47:28] things for him and all like that and
[47:30] then you took that that girl's life like
[47:33] that I said you owe me an
[47:36] understanding how many of us are praying
[47:38] like that
[47:40] Lord Jesus in the garden he was trying
[47:44] to get out from underneath the burden of
[47:46] that word pressing on him and he was the
[47:49] only one that was a lotted for that word
[47:52] brother brandom said there was word
[47:54] lotted for that age and Jesus Christ was
[47:57] the only one that could could feel that
[47:59] word and he said Lord take it away from
[48:03] me until he came into the
[48:09] place not my will but let your word have
[48:13] its perfect place in my
[48:15] heart let me
[48:18] be that
[48:19] light let me be that Shining Light what
[48:23] about you
[48:33] amen and when you tell God something
[48:35] like that he'll leave you sitting there
[48:38] alone I don't you know he doesn't owe
[48:40] you a thing I'm in debt to him well he
[48:44] just let me PW it out for a few days you
[48:46] know and after about 3 to four months
[48:49] one day I was out on the creek bank and
[48:50] the Lord spoke to me in a vision so it
[48:53] wasn't brother brandom seeking the Lord
[48:54] the Lord came to him and spoke to him
[48:56] you know God will give you he you know
[48:58] he said he'll wipe away every tear he's
[49:01] going to wipe them away not because you
[49:02] want them wiped away when the time comes
[49:05] he'll come and wipe them away he'll turn
[49:07] your your weeping into joy in the
[49:10] morning he will do that you can't do
[49:13] that you can't even you can't even by
[49:15] taking thought you if you've got a
[49:18] toothache you can't even heal a
[49:23] toothache it's the truth
[49:29] amen the Lord spoke to me in a vision he
[49:32] said and he said to me he says now go to
[49:35] her mother and say this to her mother
[49:37] did not her time come the year before
[49:39] that when she was drowning in a creek on
[49:41] a picnic she should have went at that
[49:45] time but I had to take her when she was
[49:48] ready to go and that's why all this
[49:50] happened and why you went out there and
[49:53] then I got down and I cried and I said
[49:55] Lord Jesus forgive me your poor stupid
[49:57] servant I should have never said that
[49:59] Lord and I went back down to this lady
[50:02] and she lived over here on Market Street
[50:03] and I went over to her and I said I want
[50:05] to ask you a question she said sure
[50:07] brother Bill and I said Is it true that
[50:09] that girl almost drowned and she said
[50:11] you know what that's right brother
[50:12] brandom her husband they they had got
[50:15] her out to the creek they had to use
[50:17] artificial respiration and put on
[50:18] pressure they had to get a machine and
[50:20] pump the water out of her she had her
[50:22] skirt on and they was having a picnic
[50:24] and she was out there she stepped on
[50:25] some sand slipped over her head
[50:27] strangled in the water and they didn't
[50:29] notice her and directly they seen her
[50:30] coming up and going down and they run in
[50:32] they got her they brought her out she
[50:34] almost died and brother Ram said that
[50:37] was her time to
[50:41] go
[50:43] see God knows what he is
[50:50] doing in every
[50:52] situation in every trial in every prayer
[50:57] in everything God knows what he's doing
[51:02] if the church would just take him at his
[51:06] word and believe his word
[51:10] oh Instagram this
[51:15] time
[51:19] wow I can't show that one you with
[51:23] you God knows what he's doing
[51:27] the Lord probably would have told me
[51:29] that if I hadn't taken the attitude that
[51:31] I
[51:32] took you
[51:34] see Lord you owe me to tell me about
[51:37] that he doesn't owe you anything I stood
[51:39] in a meeting one night I heard an
[51:41] evangelist praying for the sick and he
[51:43] said God I command you to heal this
[51:45] person you command
[51:48] God do you ever think about that I think
[51:51] about that all the time I pray I get up
[51:53] in the morning I pray I pray I try I try
[51:56] to do my best brother John says you
[51:58] should have a conversation don't be an
[51:59] Aaron boy but if you analyze your prayer
[52:01] it's everything bless this brother bless
[52:04] that one heal this one do this do that
[52:06] do this do this and and I just want to
[52:08] stop and hear him talk to me but you
[52:11] know what it's just like job he's quiet
[52:15] he won't tell me I look for him on the
[52:18] left hand I look for him on the right I
[52:20] look behind me I said Lord why why is
[52:23] all this like this why is it like this
[52:26] and right there the scripture job went
[52:28] through the exact same
[52:31] thing job had the exact same
[52:36] question he says who commands God it
[52:40] isn't even intelligent because God he
[52:43] does what he wants
[52:47] to verse 14 says for he performthe
[52:58] the footsteps of the Lord are ordered of
[53:05] God well yeah sometimes Brother Bruce oh
[53:10] really are we sons of God or not well
[53:14] you know
[53:15] sometimes are we sons of God or
[53:20] not amen do we believe him or not
[53:26] and he performed a thing which is
[53:28] appointed for me and many such things
[53:31] are with him therefore am I troubled at
[53:35] his
[53:37] presence and when I consider I am afraid
[53:40] of him because he holds my life in his
[53:44] hand my very breath is in his hands I
[53:47] didn't know I had a bad heart a really
[53:50] bad heart he never told
[53:53] me and then when everything started
[53:56] happen happen and he never told me what
[53:57] to
[53:59] do and I told Donna she says what are
[54:01] you going to do I says uh well we're
[54:02] just we're just going to keep there's
[54:04] okay we're going to walk here okay then
[54:06] we're going we're going to walk here and
[54:08] I'm going to look to the left God are
[54:10] you here what do you want me to do are
[54:11] you
[54:13] here okay well I'm just going to keep
[54:17] walking because that's the way he
[54:19] works job said
[54:22] so I just read it to you
[54:28] and I'm afraid of him for God Will Make
[54:32] My Heart
[54:34] soft that's the problem most of us we
[54:37] had way too much
[54:39] pride way too much
[54:41] pride and the almighty troubleth me
[54:45] because I was not cut off before the
[54:47] darkness neither hath he covered the
[54:50] darkness from my faith he didn't take me
[54:53] he didn't bring me in this I I really
[54:54] wish that he'd do something different
[54:57] than the trial that he's taken me
[54:58] through right now but that isn't his
[55:03] way that isn't how he
[55:08] works and job
[55:10] 23 now tells me things that I didn't
[55:13] know
[55:14] about I had somebody call me a year or
[55:18] so back they called me up they said
[55:21] Brother Bruce can I I want to ask you a
[55:24] question and I said yeah okay and they
[55:26] started telling me this really bad thing
[55:28] that happened to them and and they they
[55:31] said why why would God do
[55:34] that and is it wrong for me to pray that
[55:37] God will be avenge me of this person and
[55:40] and all this other I said you know I
[55:44] said I'm just going to tell you right
[55:46] now I said you may never ever get an
[55:48] answer to what
[55:50] happened you may never get an answer you
[55:53] may never you you may vengeance is of
[55:58] God so don't try to don't try to don't
[56:01] don't don't try because we're Children
[56:04] of the
[56:06] king you it's not up to us to be judge
[56:10] it's not up to us to I'm gonna make this
[56:13] person I'm I'm gonna I'm gonna make it
[56:15] so they got to gravel at my feet in fact
[56:17] I'm going to give them so many glasses
[56:19] of water because you said when you give
[56:20] a your enemy a glass of water pours coal
[56:23] on his head and and and
[56:26] and really that's the way we
[56:29] act it's
[56:34] true I am glad that God doesn't hold us
[56:40] accountable I was I was thinking the
[56:43] other day I was thinking I
[56:45] thought I said I be
[56:48] glad you know I'm glad that when I die
[56:51] and I go to the Pearly
[56:53] Gates if there's Pearly Gates whatever
[56:56] they are but when I get there that he
[56:58] isn't going to come down to the gate and
[57:01] say Oh Brother Bruce yeah I remember
[57:05] you you remember that time do you
[57:09] remember that
[57:10] time and do you remember that do you I
[57:15] do I remember it did you make it
[57:20] right did
[57:24] you hm
[57:27] well you're not coming
[57:29] in I'm glad that his blood his promise
[57:34] is bigger than
[57:36] that when we get there he'll and he'll
[57:41] he'll greet us with open
[57:44] arms why because we've accepted his
[57:48] propitiation we've accepted his
[57:52] sacrifice my sacrifice was never good
[57:54] enough but but his sacrifice is amen
[57:59] praise the Lord let's go over here and
[58:01] look at Hebrews 12 I want to share just
[58:04] a couple more things but I really want
[58:07] you to spend some time looking at Job 23
[58:10] really look at
[58:12] it that's what we can see that in the
[58:16] book of that's why we started in Luke we
[58:19] can see the hour we're living in but
[58:22] Jesus said he said you know what's going
[58:23] to happen to you guys you're going to
[58:25] get all all burden and you're going to
[58:28] have a headache and you're not going to
[58:30] be able to walk right and you're not
[58:31] going to be able to do all these things
[58:33] and all of a sudden the snare you're
[58:35] going to get caught in a snare and that
[58:37] day will catch you
[58:38] unaware when you should have known
[58:41] better
[58:44] amen in Hebrews 12:3 it says for
[58:47] consider him that endured such
[58:49] contradiction of Sinners against
[58:53] himself so here's Jesus he's in the he's
[58:56] in the Judgment Hall and they bring him
[58:58] in the Judgment Hall the high priest is
[59:01] there all the other judges are there he
[59:04] knows he's right he knows they're wrong
[59:07] and they say well we're going to call up
[59:09] brother so and so and he comes up says
[59:11] well I heard I heard that he said that
[59:15] if you destroy this temple in three days
[59:17] I'll raise it back
[59:20] up did you say that and he never said
[59:24] nothing
[59:26] then they brought another guy in and he
[59:27] said can you collaborate because the we
[59:31] are the Pharisees and we know that Moses
[59:34] told us out of the mouth of two or three
[59:36] Witnesses let all things be
[59:39] established well he didn't really say it
[59:42] like
[59:43] that contradiction of
[59:46] Sinners said consider Jesus Christ who
[59:49] endured
[59:52] lies well you know he went and come down
[59:55] he he he did this he broke up this he
[59:58] did that he did all these other things
[1:00:01] and he said consider him consider him in
[1:00:05] the Judgment Hall consider the lies that
[1:00:08] were told about him consider all those
[1:00:11] things unless you become wearied and
[1:00:16] faint in your
[1:00:19] mind you think you got it
[1:00:22] bad because the first chance you get
[1:00:25] you'll blow your to I've done that a few
[1:00:28] times back me into a corner and after a
[1:00:31] while I
[1:00:35] can't and then I feel
[1:00:38] bad right because that's not a son of
[1:00:42] God it's not a son of
[1:00:46] God he says consider him consider Jesus
[1:00:49] Christ that endured such contradiction
[1:00:51] of Sinners against
[1:00:53] himself lest you be wearied and faint in
[1:00:59] your
[1:01:01] minds you have not yet resisted under
[1:01:07] blood you no uh-uh you haven't resisted
[1:01:11] under blood
[1:01:12] yet striving against
[1:01:15] sin he who knew no
[1:01:19] sin had to die even though he was
[1:01:22] completely
[1:01:23] Guiltless and that's not you because you
[1:01:26] are guilty I'm
[1:01:30] guilty and you have forgotten the
[1:01:32] exhortation which speaketh unto us as
[1:01:35] unto
[1:01:37] children my son despise not thou the
[1:01:40] chastening of the Lord nor faint when
[1:01:43] thou are rebuked of
[1:01:47] him God was just an arms length away
[1:01:51] from job and job wanted to talk to him
[1:01:54] job wanted to know why
[1:01:56] job wanted an answer to his prayers job
[1:01:59] couldn't see the purpose job but job
[1:02:02] would not walk over that word he had an
[1:02:05] absolute he said I'm sticking with this
[1:02:08] I I can't see what he's doing but I know
[1:02:10] that when it's over with I'll be like
[1:02:13] gold I know it's going to work for my
[1:02:15] good I know it it don't look like it
[1:02:17] right now but I know he's bringing me
[1:02:20] into His Image
[1:02:22] amen
[1:02:24] amen and chess izing here is used in
[1:02:27] verse 5 6 and 7even but I want you to I
[1:02:32] chastening every time I every time as
[1:02:34] long as I've served God which has since
[1:02:38] 1976 or so he says my son despise thou
[1:02:41] not the chastening of the Lord I always
[1:02:43] think of a beaten with a
[1:02:46] belt I always think of somebody just you
[1:02:50] know chastising me for for but
[1:02:56] the in the Greek it means
[1:02:59] tutorage that means education or
[1:03:01] training by Implement by implication
[1:03:05] disciplinary
[1:03:08] correction so God's
[1:03:10] correction seems heavy at times but he's
[1:03:14] trying to teach you
[1:03:16] something the trials that are coming
[1:03:18] your way he's trying to teach you
[1:03:22] something despise not thou the
[1:03:24] chastening or the teach teaching of the
[1:03:26] Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of
[1:03:29] him for when the for whom the Lord
[1:03:32] loveth he
[1:03:35] teaches and scourgeth every son whom he
[1:03:41] receiveth for if you endure these things
[1:03:45] chastening the schooling you know that's
[1:03:48] why that's why the church is still here
[1:03:49] because we have trouble taking
[1:03:53] chastisement we we do and as long as we
[1:03:56] don't take chastisement it doesn't bear
[1:03:59] Peaceable
[1:04:00] fruit that's what the Bible says the
[1:04:03] Bible says that we are the branches and
[1:04:05] he says a branch that's bringing forth
[1:04:07] just a little bit of fruit he comes by
[1:04:10] with a hatchet and cuts off he prunes it
[1:04:12] and prunes it back so it'll bear more
[1:04:17] fruit amen praise
[1:04:21] God
[1:04:23] Amen and if you endure
[1:04:26] chastening God deals with you as with a
[1:04:31] son not a
[1:04:34] sinner he's not doing this to you to
[1:04:37] destroy you I love that brother from
[1:04:40] Africa he he brought up a very excellent
[1:04:43] point the man that built this Pulpit has
[1:04:46] no interest in destroying
[1:04:49] it it's his
[1:04:52] Masterpiece and you are God's
[1:04:54] masterpiece
[1:04:58] he he brought us all this way not to
[1:05:00] destroy us but to display
[1:05:04] us
[1:05:06] amen amen praise
[1:05:09] God God deal dealth with you as with
[1:05:12] sons for what son is he whom the father
[1:05:16] chasteneth
[1:05:20] not brother brandham said in the evening
[1:05:22] messenger he says now remember job
[1:05:24] remember all this Tri
[1:05:27] that wasn't God chastening job that was
[1:05:30] God approving his
[1:05:35] servant approving his servant so it all
[1:05:39] worked out for good you see and then the
[1:05:42] book The Book of Job was written for all
[1:05:46] generations for a
[1:05:49] testimony and God's working it for our
[1:05:53] good amen amen
[1:05:56] I think that's a very fine example for
[1:05:58] us parents
[1:06:00] today let's set an example before our
[1:06:04] children you live your best and your
[1:06:06] worst at home
[1:06:10] yep and I think that our lives though
[1:06:13] the children may not exactly act like
[1:06:15] they're watching you but they're
[1:06:17] watching you don't you never think that
[1:06:20] they're not because they
[1:06:23] are and here's the kicker
[1:06:26] not are the CH not only are the children
[1:06:28] watching you but your neighbors are
[1:06:30] watching
[1:06:32] you and not only the neighbors but the
[1:06:35] people you associate
[1:06:38] with yeah they watch you the people at
[1:06:41] the church they watch you the people
[1:06:44] that you do business with in the market

[1:06:50] your confession even when you didn't
[1:06:53] confess they can see
[1:06:56] they can
[1:07:01] see we should always try to reflect
[1:07:05] Christ in everything that we
[1:07:09] do job had a
