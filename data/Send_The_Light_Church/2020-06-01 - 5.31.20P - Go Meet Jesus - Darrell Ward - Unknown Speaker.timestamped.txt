[28:11] to the end don't wait for if it has to
[28:13] do with a certain subject you like him

[28:19] sentence that comes out of his mouth
[28:21] that God wants to bless us abundantly

[28:28] I believe it has everything to do with

[32:51] Martha as soon as she heard that Jesus
[32:53] was coming she went and met him but Mary
[32:56] said still in the house
[32:59] this said Martha unto Jesus Lord if the
[33:03] house had been here my brother had not

[33:12] to thee and Jesus jesus said unto her
[33:15] thy brother shall rise again and Martha
[33:19] said unto him I know that he shall rise
[33:21] again in the resurrection at the last
[33:23] day and Jesus said unto her I am the
[33:27] resurrection and the life and he that
[33:29] believeth in me though he were dead yet

[33:57] hearts was just warmed as the songs of
[34:00] praise were saying to you this afternoon
[34:02] Lord God it sounds so wonderful to hear
[34:06] the voices of the saints uniting
[34:08] together as one to give you praise Lord
[34:11] father we long for the hour that we can
[34:13] all gather ourselves back together and
[34:16] Lord that may be those with with health
[34:19] issues not able to come Lord because of
[34:21] the virus Lord and the possibilities but
[34:24] Lord we long for that Howard or that
[34:26] get all gather ourselves back together
[34:28] again lift our voices of Thanksgiving
[34:31] unto the Lord but until that time we
[34:34] press on God we do Lord we trawl the
[34:37] sword and fight the good fight of faith
[34:38] I pray Lord Jesus that you'd come this
[34:42] evening God and take this little the
[34:44] scripture reading Lord and may you just
[34:46] make it so real that you just step out
[34:49] of the pages of the Bible and walk among
[34:51] us Lord and father we ask that you just
[34:53] bless brother John and but the officers
[34:55] here of the church Lord and this little
[34:57] assembly God may they reflect you in
[35:00] such a light in this evening hour that
[35:02] those down at Walmart and those old God
[35:04] down at the drugstore and at work that
[35:06] they could see Jesus once again living
[35:09] in the lives of our brothers and our
[35:11] sisters for Lord it's truly not
[35:12] ourselves that we want to represent but
[35:15] it's you Lord so father I pray to that
[35:17] may I just get myself out of the way god
[35:19] I have no ability Lord but I just get
[35:22] myself out of the way and ask your God
[35:24] that you would step in and speak out
[35:26] through my lips to your children Lord
[35:28] and all God may you not only be the
[35:29] speaker tonight but may you be the
[35:31] hearer of the words that are spoken may
[35:33] our souls cry out a man and Lord we
[35:36] receive that because it's the truth
[35:38] Lord bless those that are here those who
[35:40] wanted to be here your little bride all
[35:42] around the world Lord meet their needs
[35:44] tonight we pray and father once again as
[35:47] we've asked you so many times
[35:48] Lord lift this thing off of our nation
[35:50] we pray we just love you Lord we know
[35:53] God that our table for we ask these
[35:55] things in Jesus name and the bride says
[35:58] I mean God bless you say so you may be
[36:00] seated this evening huh I want you to
[36:03] draw your attention back to verse 20 I
[36:04] trust to get the right bottle of water
[36:09] Lord but I want to call your attention
[36:15] back to verse 20 this has been Martha as
[36:18] soon as she heard that Jesus was coming
[36:20] went out and met him but Mary sat still
[36:24] in the house now I believe that these
[36:28] two scriptures represent everyone that
[36:31] is in this church tonight for the way I
[36:35] see it we can do one or two things we
[36:38] can do like Martha when she heard that
[36:39] Jesus
[36:40] was coming she got up and went to medium
[36:42] or we can be like Mary and sit still in
[36:46] the house because you're going to do one
[36:49] or the other
[36:49] Jesus said where two or three are
[36:51] gathered in my name I will be in their
[36:54] midst you see he comes and the power of
[36:56] his resurrection he sees healing in the
[36:59] form of his word he comes to pour out
[37:01] the Holy Ghost he comes to fulfill every
[37:03] promise that he made to the believer he
[37:06] comes to bring deliverance he comes to
[37:08] bring healing he comes to bring
[37:09] forgiveness he gums to bring joy
[37:11] unspeakable and full of glory when Jesus
[37:14] comes the tempters power is broken and
[37:16] when he comes we can either get up and
[37:18] go meet him or we can sit still in the
[37:22] house but I say this afternoon let's not
[37:25] sit still in the house he's here
[37:27] his word says he's here then let us get
[37:30] up and step out and possess what belongs
[37:33] to us because this is our day this is
[37:36] our time this is our hour
[37:38] this is our moment to shine Eman the
[37:40] promises of God's Word for the believer
[37:42] they belong to us this is our generation
[37:46] like the sister that was in the
[37:47] communist country and they wasn't
[37:49] allowed to go to church and so they
[37:51] would go to a bread shop and the man
[37:53] would they have a secret place that they
[37:55] meet to have Church and he would put the
[37:57] address in bread and they would sell the
[37:59] brand and people would go into the bread
[38:01] shop and they would ask for a certain
[38:03] kind of bread and that's where they
[38:04] found out the meetings were to be held
[38:06] and so the sister found out where the
[38:08] meeting was going to be held because he
[38:09] was against the law just similar self
[38:11] aren't you glad we go to a country that
[38:13] we can still assume with ourselves
[38:15] together and so she was going to the
[38:17] secret church service and she run into a
[38:19] soldier and he took his rifle and he
[38:22] stuck it up to it he said where are you
[38:24] going
[38:25] and she said my brother died and I'm
[38:28] going for the reading of the wheel and
[38:31] when she got to the secret meeting coma
[38:33] they sang songs of worship she danced in
[38:37] the spirit a message of times before
[38:39] that somebody interpreted somebody was
[38:41] healed and somebody was delivered
[38:43] they had foot washing they had communion
[38:45] and on the way home she was just so
[38:47] happy that she was singing the Holy
[38:50] Ghost is mine
[38:51] joy is mine he's of his mind and she ran
[38:54] into the same soldier and he said what
[38:57] did your brother leave you she said all
[39:00] he left me everything I'm taking this
[39:04] afternoon hallelujah because of Calvary
[39:06] ever redemptive blessing belongs to us
[39:09] he left it to us let's leave let's take
[39:14] what God has given us by His grace I say
[39:16] let's get up and don't meet Jesus Jesus
[39:19] is the answer to every problem that we
[39:22] got I'm sick then let's go up just get
[39:24] up and go meet him I'm discouraged get
[39:26] up and go meet him I'm depressed then
[39:28] get up and go meet him you see
[39:30] hallelujah Mary he knew that death had
[39:33] come to their house and sorrow and fear
[39:35] had come to their house but Martha had
[39:38] called a revelation
[39:41] hallelujah she called a revelation that
[39:43] caused her to get up and go meet Jesus
[39:48] in our study our Bible story we find
[39:51] that death had struck the home of Mary
[39:53] and Martha and no doubt they thought how
[39:57] could this happen to us ain't it funny
[40:00] we always say that no how could you know
[40:04] Jesus is our friend he slept in our
[40:07] spare room that we had he he sat at her
[40:09] table and we're message believers we've
[40:12] left everything to follow him how could
[40:16] this sorrow come to us how could this
[40:18] doctor's report be so mad we're his
[40:22] people
[40:23] he's officers we should never have
[40:26] trials as I said this one we we should
[40:29] never have troubles every day should be
[40:30] blue skies and spooks every day should
[40:33] be a picnic He loves us we're his
[40:35] children those are wonderful thoughts
[40:38] but the problem is Jesus never said
[40:43] he never said that in fact he said still
[40:47] fishes
[40:48] you'll be persecuted laughs that monkey
[40:50] for my namesake
[40:52] they met he never said we wouldn't cry
[40:55] he never said we wouldn't have sorrow he
[40:57] never said we wouldn't suffer he never
[40:59] said we wouldn't get stinky he never
[41:01] promised smooth sailing but as I said
[41:04] this morning he just simply said I'll
[41:06] never leave you the way I forsake you
[41:09] when the storm is at its greatest I'll
[41:11] be right there with you
[41:13] you see sometimes God allows things to
[41:16] come into our lives so that he can come
[41:19] to us and show us just how great yes
[41:24] you see God can tell every one of us I'm
[41:26] the drink God I'm a great healer I'm I'm
[41:28] a great deliverer
[41:29] if we would have said Amen we believe
[41:31] that but you see God allows things to
[41:33] come into her life
[41:34] he moves upon that situation and he
[41:37] heals us of cancer when the doctor says
[41:39] there's no way he opens a blind eye when
[41:41] the doctor says there's no way he raises
[41:43] up the data then we say you are a healer
[41:46] you are our deliveryman there is no God
[41:49] like after all experience is the best
[41:53] teacher amen and sometimes God allows
[41:57] things to come into our life just to
[41:59] show us how great he is you may have a
[42:04] great cancer you may have a great trial
[42:05] you may have a great problem but our God
[42:08] is greater is that true yeah but no
[42:13] means taking light of your suffering we
[42:18] have real tears yes we did we have real
[42:22] pain who free I know what it's like
[42:26] otherwise like to lay your head on a
[42:28] third wheel of your car and cry

[42:34] bad going down your legs that you can't
[42:36] go in your neck you can't turn it left

[42:51] your legs is real the pain in your heart
[42:52] is real it's a real earth it's real
[42:56] it's real fear but I'm just trying to
[42:58] tell you we've got a real God who's
[43:00] bigger than overhead Mary and Martha in
[43:05] this great time of sorrow and in the
[43:07] great Dominique it was their darkest
[43:10] hour that was Mary and Martha left alone
[43:12] their mother and father was done dead in
[43:14] Dallas just in two girls their brother
[43:17] last week was gone and they were alone
[43:18] in the world
[43:19] their brother was gone then they set in
[43:21] sackcloth and black veils and weeping
[43:23] and mourning over the loss of their
[43:25] brother is how we gonna make this
[43:27] meeting what are we gonna do it was the
[43:29] very darkest hour they had ever
[43:31] experienced but let me tell you it's in
[43:34] those darkest hours that Jesus always
[43:37] shows up you still up brother Darrell
[43:40] it's such a dark time then I say to you
[43:42] it's about time for him to show up baby
[43:44] oh my brother said one time I heard him
[43:48] say that when Jesus shows up he always
[43:50] shows out oh that's just the way he
[43:54] doesn't hey man it may be your darkest
[43:57] hour but he comes along at the darkest
[43:59] hour it was the woman with the blood
[44:02] issue it was her doctor's darkest hour
[44:05] 12 years and the doctor said the blood
[44:08] issue would not stop 12 years of
[44:11] bleeding they work on you that'll make
[44:15] you weary amen 12 years of battling this
[44:21] sickness this blood issue it was her
[44:25] darkest hour had the doctors after the
[44:27] Bible said she spent all her money guess
[44:30] what the doctor said they couldn't help
[44:33] her now wouldn't it be nice if I told
[44:35] her that before but it was only after
[44:40] they had bled her bank account dry that
[44:42] they said we can't help you it was in
[44:44] her darkest hour when the doctors turned
[44:47] her down that Jesus showed up it was the
[44:50] darkest time for gyruss when his little
[44:52] girl his only little daughter lay dead
[44:55] and at that darkest hour Jesus came home
[44:59] it was the darkest hour that Peter and
[45:01] the Apostles had ever seen out there on
[45:03] the sea
[45:03] not with 10,000 demons for they would
[45:06] drown them it was the darkest hour but
[45:08] it was in that darkest hour that Jesus
[45:11] came walking on the water
[45:12] Oh hallelujah and it was the darkest
[45:16] hour for Martha hey man it was in that
[45:19] dark hour that Martha got word that
[45:22] Jesus had come
[45:26] you see Martha realized the answer to
[45:29] her sorrow the answer to her darkness
[45:31] the answer to her fear was Jesus
[45:35] she realized God had a provided way and
[45:39] Jesus was the answer for everything she
[45:42] was going through and I tell you if this
[45:44] nation would only receive it Jesus is
[45:47] the answer for every problem this nation
[45:49] faces today he's the answer the answer
[45:54] to everything that we're going through
[45:55] he was the answer then he's the answer
[45:57] now and if there is the tomorrow he'll
[45:59] be the answer tomorrow he's the same
[46:01] yesterday today and forever amen
[46:05] she got the word that he had come and
[46:08] when she heard that he had come she got
[46:11] up and went to meet him
[46:13] it reminds me of Barabbas sitting there
[46:16] on the rocks of the wall of Jericho and
[46:18] he wore a beggar's robe that identified
[46:22] him as a blind beggar must have been a
[46:25] certain color or a certain style he wore
[46:29] this Roman you could tell by the robe he
[46:31] was wearing what was wrong with you more
[46:33] than just a beggar he was a blind beggar
[46:35] and he wore the beggars robe identified
[46:38] him as a blind beggar
[46:41] Sani to the son tried to get a few
[46:44] pennies and he got to thinking about his
[46:48] life he got them thinking about the
[46:50] doves he'd once had and he remembered
[46:55] his little girl had got sick and he went
[46:59] behind the house there where he was
[47:01] headed fell his way out to the back and
[47:04] he lifted up those blind eyes to the sky
[47:08] he said father my little girls sick and
[47:13] Lord I'd meet her I see the world to her
[47:19] tell me about the treason she brings me
[47:22] such comfort say God I need her don't
[47:26] take her from me boy if you let her live
[47:32] if she got well then it wasn't long
[47:36] after that that his wife took sick and
[47:39] he goes back behind the house again this
[47:42] is his house up towards heaven he said
[47:43] Lord my wife is sick perhaps she had the
[47:47] same thing his daughter had I don't
[47:48] really know but that Lord my wife is
[47:51] sick doesn't what I need her she washes
[47:56] my clothes my lord please don't take my
[48:03] little Queen from me if you let her live
[48:06] Lord I'll give you my little if she got
[48:12] well and so keeping his word to God he
[48:16] headed down to the temple with his lamb
[48:18] and he run into the priest and the
[48:20] priest said by part of mass where are
[48:22] you going he said I'm going to the
[48:24] temple to offer my lamb he said you
[48:26] can't do that by Barmes you need that
[48:28] lamb because in that day lamps were
[48:31] seeing high animals like they used dogs
[48:32] today in the bible times they used the
[48:34] lamb said you need that lamb to help you
[48:36] get around here
[48:38] take this money and go buy you a lamb to
[48:40] give to God and blind bartimaeus old God
[48:43] give me faith like that he said I never
[48:44] promised God a lamb I promised God ditch
[48:47] lamb and I kept off this lamp he will
[48:50] give me a lamb for my HUS a man is
[48:54] sitting there on the rocks that day he
[48:57] got to thinking about these ways of a
[48:58] provided lamb and sitting there he began
[49:01] to hear a noise and he said what's going
[49:03] on some said it's Jesus of Nazareth the
[49:06] Lamb of God the Lamb of God
[49:10] the Lamb of God that's my lamb become
[49:15] that would bribe Bartimaeus heard the
[49:17] lamb the provided way keeping in the
[49:20] crowd Jesus thou son of David have mercy
[49:22] on me and someone said hey old man hold
[49:25] your peace
[49:26] or this is church he's mostly get
[49:27] excited to church but he cried the
[49:29] louder is that all Jesus thou son of
[49:32] David have mercy about me you see it
[49:35] wasn't his force that stopped Jesus it
[49:37] was his faith in Jesus and I say to you
[49:40] if this thing can't stop Jesus your fate
[49:43] could stop him tonight evening because
[49:46] he's the same yesterday forever the
[49:48] Bible said Jesus Stood Still
[49:50] they said he stopped he's calling for
[49:53] you be of good cheer you've stopped the
[49:57] master he's calling for you now blind
[50:00] Bartimaeus has left with this decision
[50:03] just like you are
[50:05] even the set steel most rocks or get up
[50:09] and go meet amen and the Bible says
[50:17] casting away his garment he arose he
[50:26] threw it off and he went to meet Jesus
[50:29] you know why because he knew ain't gonna
[50:31] need that behind Baker's robe no more a
[50:34] man that can see don't need a blind robe
[50:41] can you see what he saw he was blind as
[50:45] blind could be and yet he saw a lamb I
[50:48] know you can't give me that kind of
[50:51] vision hood amen blonder than anybody
[50:54] around him and yet he saw what they
[50:56] could not see they saw a man some of
[50:59] them several more rejected some of them
[51:02] was worshipping but by Bartimaeus saw a
[51:04] lamb providing for his eyes
[51:08] this afternoon a step towards the
[51:10] promise of word of God for your day that
[51:12] you're living in cast out the fear cast
[51:15] out the asthma gasps stop the high blood
[51:17] pressure
[51:17] cast out back trouble I don't need an
[51:19] offer on this road I don't need an
[51:21] oppression road because my god has
[51:24] provided aloud for me Amen you say how
[51:28] can you talk about healing when you're
[51:30] still hurting I'll talk about it till
[51:32] the hurt and stops a man because he
[51:39] shattered huge circumstances of
[51:42] situations there's nothing but lie
[51:43] advantages they provided lamb I've got a
[51:53] provided lamb to you that was God's
[51:56] provided way go meet Jesus that's right
[51:59] it's always his provided way when you
[52:01] got sorrow in your home go meet Jesus

[52:09] hallelujah if you got a need for
[52:11] anything go meet Jesus gomini
[52:14] he's got all the remedy he's not only
[52:16] the remedy he's the cure hey she got up
[52:22] and she went to meet you if God provided
[52:25] the way for us let's just bring a tire
[52:28] thing for just a minute we look at that
[52:29] what a wonderful example but now let's
[52:31] just bring it down to worry then if God
[52:33] provided a way for them and he's no
[52:35] respecter person's think he's also
[52:37] provided a way for us if you've done
[52:40] that back then he's gonna do it today or
[52:42] he's not the same right so God would not
[52:45] either way for us to go meet Jesus there
[52:48] has to be a way to do that in this day
[52:51] that we're living in if God provided the
[52:53] way for them to meet Jesus then he's
[52:55] obligated to provide a way for us to
[52:56] meet but in order to meet him you've got
[52:59] to know where he's at
[53:02] he said Jesus said in a little while the
[53:06] world sift me the Lord but ye shall see
[53:09] me power Lord how will we see you for
[53:13] I'll be with you even in you let us see
[53:27] that it's here now but you can only see
[53:33] him listen to me you can only see him
[53:35] and the manifestation of his word that
[53:38] is promised in the hour that you're
[53:39] living in that's the only way you'll
[53:43] ever see him it's when he comes to
[53:45] vindicate the word that's promised for
[53:47] the day you're living in
[53:48] you see if somebody come through that
[53:50] door driving across and come up the
[53:52] aisle blood borne out of his body and a
[53:54] crown of thorns a women would scream men
[53:56] would faint but then even Jesus don't
[53:59] care how real it looks that ain't him
[54:01] you know why how do you how can you say
[54:02] that's not Jesus because he so you've
[54:12] got to see how we would be here today
[54:14] how would we be here today if you can
[54:16] see the promise for today and when you
[54:17] see that promise manifested you have saw
[54:20] Christ restore you everybody's wearing
[54:24] masks now and it's something that's the
[54:26] only time you go to a bank with a mask
[54:28] on
[54:30] I was in the store the other day and I
[54:38] get this stuff this person you know they
[54:40] come in and I said well
[54:42] you've changed your mask and that's
[54:47] exactly what Jesus did twister get about
[54:57] two o'clock he's just changed his mask a
[55:04] little while the world see me no more
[55:06] but she shall see me how will we see but
[55:08] I'll be with you even in you then who is
[55:12] this mask where is your is masking

[55:18] wearing you thrill you that the world
[55:21] may see Jesus once again how through his
[55:23] people oh boy - good how do you Jesus
[55:28] said I'm behind you with the branches
[55:30] the bad does not bear the fruit man
[55:34] factors not even know Beauty in the vine
[55:35] that's true all the beauties in the
[55:38] grapes but we say Lord look at those
[55:46] grapes look at those leaves why it's the
[55:49] fruit of the fire that brings together
[55:51] don't you see you the beauty of Christ
[55:54] in this hour Abraham I am the vine and
[55:57] you are the branches define does not
[55:59] bear fruit therefore the only way Jesus
[56:01] could speak tonight it would be through
[56:03] my lips your lips my hands your hands my
[56:06] life your life why that's where he's
[56:08] failed in this hour I am the vine ye are

[56:15] the church bears the fruit what kind of
[56:17] tree classroom because the life of the
[56:19] fire how are you the life of the finest
[56:22] now in the branch Oh what kind of fruit
[56:28] would you bury if the lot that was in
[56:30] him is in his church then it would bear
[56:33] the same kind of life that he bore when
[56:35] he was here and that's the fulfillment
[56:37] of st. John 14:12 fairly verily I say
[56:39] unto you the works I do it
[56:41] so you do also why because I'm the vine
[56:44] and do the branches in life it's in the
[56:48] behind moves into the bricks to bear the
[56:50] fruit making him the same yesterday
[56:51] today and forever he's hearing the
[56:54] person of the Holy Spirit
[56:55] I'm the vine you are the branches the
[56:57] vine does not bear the fruit Saint John
[57:01] 15 define cannot bear fruit
[57:03] it's the branches that bears the fruit
[57:05] has its energized from the mind and
[57:07] Christ is our energy your lips is his
[57:13] lips when you're energized your hands is
[57:16] his hands when you're energized I'm not
[57:20] talking about the energize buddy I'm
[57:21] talking about the energized church ain't
[57:23] my head hallelujah your hands is his
[57:27] hands when you're energized from the
[57:28] vine Christ as the life on the bond of
[57:30] his church and each member is the branch
[57:33] of his church this ministry is in his
[57:36] pride which is his body we are his body
[57:41] on the earth today bone of his bone
[57:44] flesh of his flesh spirit of his spirit
[57:45] life of his life she is him expressed
[57:48] then where is he he's right here with us
[57:51] now just like he said he would be oh god
[57:57] help us catch that revelation when he
[58:07] was here he wasn't free of trouble the
[58:13] trouble that's what makes it a
[58:15] supersized it's so it's a paradox that
[58:19] God could dwell in the body the stewards
[58:21] that Jesus could raise the dead and
[58:23] grown with the headache but it's being
[58:27] manifested in flesh Christ in you the
[58:31] hope of all glory let's go back to Mary
[58:37] here just a little bit now
[58:38] Jesus centered the larger senator thy
[58:40] brother shall rise again and mark the
[58:42] center to him I know he shall rise again
[58:45] in the resurrection at the lat
[58:47] and Jesus sent into her I am the
[58:49] resurrection and the life he that
[58:51] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[58:53] shall he live and whosoever liveth and
[58:56] believeth in me shall never die
[58:57] believe us without this she said unto
[59:01] him yay Lord I believe yay Lord I
[59:10] believe that thou art the Christ the Son
[59:13] of God words had come into the world and
[59:16] when she had said so she went her way
[59:18] and called marry her sister secretly
[59:21] saying the Masters come and calleth for
[59:24] thee think about the Masters come and
[59:31] call it for thee and as soon as she
[59:34] heard as soon as she heard Mary rose
[59:37] quickly and came until you see Martha
[59:41] the church the woman touches the church
[59:42] Martha the church the church went to
[59:45] Mary with the message who was still
[59:47] sitting in the house because she didn't
[59:50] know are you listen to me Martha was
[59:54] back at the revelation
[59:55] he's not coming he's here it would Mary
[1:00:01] receive that message she comes to Mary
[1:00:05] she's still sitting in the house Martha
[1:00:08] comes just Mary listen listen to me I
[1:00:11] know you're hurting I know you have
[1:00:12] sorrow I know you feel depressed I know
[1:00:15] you're nervous I know you feel like the
[1:00:17] world's coming to lead in and caving in
[1:00:19] on you I know we're in a quarantine I
[1:00:20] know we're in a virus I know the hundred
[1:00:22] thousand of God I know it looks bad I
[1:00:24] know the economy is crashed but listen
[1:00:27] Mary listen
[1:00:42] he's hearing that when that revelation
[1:00:46] struck a heart she rose quickly Mary
[1:00:48] rose quickly and went out to meet he why
[1:00:50] she had the same revelation that marked
[1:00:53] the time I know it's an unusual time a
[1:00:57] dark time an evil time a time of unrest
[1:01:00] but he will be with us his spirit the
[1:01:08] Holy Spirit will leave in God this
[1:01:10] church until he comes in a physical body
[1:01:18] God's body United as his bride began one
[1:01:22] him and Christ together has the Spirit
[1:01:25] working in the flesh of the church like
[1:01:26] it worked in the flesh of Jesus Christ
[1:01:28] because it's a part of his body not
[1:01:30] Twain but one they are one a husband
[1:01:32] wife or one no longer two but the one
[1:01:34] Christ in his body is one the same
[1:01:37] spirit that was in crisis in his bride
[1:01:40] it's his body that unites them together
[1:01:43] with all the words God living in there
[1:01:46] himself manifested God manifesting
[1:01:49] himself through a mini member body what
[1:01:52] God did in one body called the body of
[1:01:54] Jesus he Nell does it in a mini membered
[1:01:56] body called the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:01:59] you see all God was he poured into
[1:02:03] Christ and all Christ was he poured into
[1:02:06] his church Christ was the mystery of God
[1:02:10] revealed and the church is the mystery
[1:02:12] or the revelation of Christ revealed in
[1:02:15] this hour
[1:02:16] oh god was he emptied into Christ and
[1:02:19] all Christ was he emptied into the
[1:02:22] church who are we more than just church
[1:02:28] members I'm not interested in being a
[1:02:30] church member side of my name on some
[1:02:32] role I want to know even the power of
[1:02:34] his resurrection
[1:02:35] I want that personal relationship with
[1:02:37] Jesus why can't we know him that way the
[1:02:44] only thing he ever asked the Father for
[1:02:47] when he was here he didn't have a coin
[1:02:48] and have a chair he walked everywhere he
[1:02:50] went
[1:02:51] he didn't have a change of clothes he
[1:02:52] wore the same clothes everywhere he went
[1:02:53] he said the birds have missed the Foxes
[1:02:56] have world but I the Son of Man have no
[1:02:57] place to lay my head and yet he never
[1:03:00] asked the father one time for him to Mew
[1:03:04] or a Cadillac the only thing he ever
[1:03:09] asked the father for what's it we have
[1:03:26] the house if he's here let's go meet him
[1:03:29] if you got a need just get up and go me
[1:03:34] thank God for every miracle that we've
[1:03:36] ever seen that miracles you thank God
[1:03:39] for every one of them thank God for the
[1:03:41] miracles that was done in the 60s but
[1:03:43] I'm so happy to know that we don't have
[1:03:45] to go all the way back to the days of a
[1:03:47] a Alan and some of these other people
[1:03:49] that had these great healing campaigns
[1:03:50] and brother branham and all these dear
[1:03:52] I'm so glad we don't have to go all the
[1:03:53] way back to their yeah to see that he's
[1:03:58] the same but I believe that saying God
[1:04:00] is doing things right now working
[1:04:04] through his body on the earth right now
[1:04:06] making st. John 14:12 the works I do she
[1:04:08] added also making that a reality greater

[1:05:49] this poor man and when we say they may
[1:05:52] God is my witness he got up he wiped the
[1:05:55] blood off of his nose he shook his hand

[1:09:07] there's not even a sign of where the
[1:09:08] rash was because God he said his people
[1:09:13] making himself the same yesterday today
[1:09:16] and forever you know a story my daughter
[1:09:20] Jessica struck by trains with my family
[1:09:22] killed left in a wheelchair blinded from
[1:09:25] the exit did couldn't swallow had to put
[1:09:27] a feeding tube in her but God rich in
[1:09:29] His mercy I was laying in the Chapel of
[1:09:33] the hospital on the floor praying I
[1:09:35] didn't care who hurt my babies upstairs
[1:09:37] they told me she had a severe brain
[1:09:39] injury she's on life support system they
[1:09:40] told me she if she if she even lives
[1:09:43] she'll be nothing but a vegetable but we
[1:09:44] don't even expect her to live and I
[1:09:46] worked at surgery in that time 19 years
[1:09:48] of surgery assistant doctors and and I
[1:09:51] knew I could see the CT scanner I could
[1:09:53] see all that myself I knew how bad it
[1:09:55] was and I was laying there on the floor
[1:09:56] and I was crying out to God and I said
[1:09:58] Lord if you was here like you worked
[1:10:00] 2,000 years ago I said all I have to do
[1:10:03] is like the woman with the blood issue I
[1:10:07] would take my baby home that's even Lord
[1:10:14] you're not here like you were 2000 years
[1:10:17] ago but God is my witness later on that
[1:10:19] floor I heard a voice it wasn't
[1:10:20] honourable but a voice you know how it
[1:10:22] is you've heard it before something
[1:10:23] speak in my heart and this boy
[1:10:25] said but my bride is here if you touch
[1:10:30] her you have touched me I jumped off the
[1:10:33] floor because I realized all I need to
[1:10:35] do is get brother mark get brother John
[1:10:37] get sister Cheryl just get somebody it
[1:10:42] was just the same as Jesus laying hands
[1:10:44] on her because and against all odds the
[1:10:52] Lord Jesus raised her up she started
[1:10:58] talking again
[1:10:58] she started swallowing again and one day
[1:11:01] he and when he left he took the
[1:11:04] blindness with him and today she sees
