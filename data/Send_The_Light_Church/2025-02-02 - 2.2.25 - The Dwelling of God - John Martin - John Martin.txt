there's been many times you've gotten on your knees and did not feel the presence of the Lord when you got there and you tried praying and you still didn't you just couldn't seem to feel his presence but then you make a decision I'm just going to start praising him right and and sometimes you feel like it's not really coming from my heart like I feel it you just keep praising him and you enter into that where he's there he says I'm meeting you and you know you've done the right thing because he requires us to enter into his gates with Thanksgiving into his courts with praise well God bless you this morning turn with me if you would in in the book of uh Psalms or one of great a great Psalm Psalms 91 for opening uh reading amen this is such a a beautiful Psalms amen let's look to the Lord

spirit Cal and may they feel your presence as we feel it here today Lord Lord may you touch their bodies may you meet every need may you lift them up and Lord as we've come our desire is to be drawn Closer to You Lord we're not looking for some great service but Lord if you would just speak to our hearts personally if you would just give us a revelation of yourself if you would just draw us closer to you if we could just walk from this building closer to you than when we came God we know that our travel is here would not be in vain God I just pray that you would look down upon the the many the many needs Lord that there be in our midst father Lord we don't want to just um just pick out one or two because there's so many but we just ask that you'd remember Sister Tasha this morning your loving kindness Lord just meet with her today Lord and touch her body raise her up for your honor and your glory we pray father come break the bread of life to us today Lord as we yield oursel to you and all of us together yielding oursel to you may you come you come and just show us how great thou art Lord we love you commit the service now to you every need amongst us we pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen we're going to read the entire Psalms here Psalms 91 he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the Almighty I will say of the Lord he is my refuge and my Fortress my God in him will I trust surely he shall deliver thee From The Snare of the Fowler and from the noisome pestilence he shall cover thee with his feathers and under his wing shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and and buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor for the arrow that flyth by day nor for the pestilence that walketh in darkness nor for the destruction that wasteth at Noonday A thousand shall fall at thy side and 10,000 at thy right hand but it shall not come nigh thee Oh what a precious promise Only With Thine Eyes shall thou behold and see the reward of the wicked now how do we get into the secret place love love SS out the directions because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation there shall no evil Beall thee neither shall any plague come nigh thy dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee in all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest thou Dash thy foot against the stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion the adder the Young Lion and the dragon shall thou trample on her feet because he ha set his love upon me therefore why deliver him I will set him on high because you have known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation amen God bless you you may be seated we want to entitle this this morning the dwelling of God and for a subject the secret place first thing I want to say is that the secret place is not a place it's a person is the person the Lord Jesus Christ I will say of the Lord he is my refuge he is my Fortress he is my God in him will I trust not the place but in him Colossians 2:10 says and we are complete in him which is the head of all principality and power he is our everything Philippians 4:19 but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches and Glory by Christ Jesus he is Jehovah Gyra the Lord will provide he is that secret place you know we come to a building here to gather together to have church here and we think sometimes that that God has a a place that if we can just um get to that we're going to be safe and I want us to and it's not so much um in a church building it's not so much listening to a tape it's it's it's not so much getting our hands and our knees at at home by our bed I want us to think of this place as God but not just God but a part of God the secret place is not a place it's a person surely he will deliver us he will cover you in your he will shield you in him we can trust Amen brother brandom shared the secret place places in Christ he says in the spiritual food do season he says what a wonderful thing a type of the spiritual place in Christ God's provided place of worship he says now the thing I want to speak about this morning is that God has only one place that the worshipper can meet God only one place and Through the Ages many have sought for this secret place of God through all ages even job wanted to know where he lived he says if I could only go to the house and knock at the door job wanted to find God's dwelling because their God and his family is worshiped together amen he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high the secret place of the most high is the very Heart Of God it is the very heart the very center of who God is so where are where are secrets kept that's right that's right secrets are kept in the heart how many times we've said this statement um why'd you keep that secret from me where was it kept it was kept in the heart the secret place of the most high is the very Heart Of God it's a precious place he that dwelleth in the heart of the most high shall abide under the Shadle or the defense of the almighty now that word dwelleth and I want to get into this a little bit later with some scriptures in the New Testament that word dwelleth it means to remain settle it means to marry it means to abide it means to continue too many people want to live their life and when they need help they want to go to God and God help me but that is not dwelling in the secret place he that dwelleth in the heart of the most high shall abide now that word abide means stay permanently stay permanently and we play a part of the dwelling we choose to dwell in the secret place we choose to dwell in the very desires of God's heart Psalm 178 says keep me as the apple of the eye hide me under the shadow of thy wings you're you're your eyes always stay there you don't take your eyes off your eyes are there they they're permanently there they're dwelling in your body God wants us to dwell in the in his heart now God's secret place isn't everywhere it isn't in every thought that we have we can take Corinthians 13 forces charity or the heart of God envieth not it vaunteth not itself it's not puffed up it does not behave itself unseemly it seeketh not her own it's not easily provoked it thinketh no evil so the heart of God is not in that amen so if we're doing that we're not dwelling in God right we're not dwelling in God's secret place when we're thinking ill about somebody or some something when we don't have the mind of Christ we're not in the secret place Philippians 2:3 says let nothing be done through Strife or vain Glory but in loneliness of Mind Let each esteem the other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but the but every man also on the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus so God is not in every thought we have God does not dwell in every thought we have I want us to separate well God is always with me the Holy Ghost is always with me God I I'm me and God are one but yet our thoughts are not God's thoughts and we we we don't want to go through life and and and and and not care about those thoughts because we want to learn to dwell we want to learn to dwell in the secret place in the heart of God not not just visit it when we need it not just use it for our gain to love God's heart now God is everywhere he's everywhere but there is only a secret place for the most high there is nowhere that God is not present in knowing god is I'm a present which means god is everywhere at all the times God's divine presence fills all space and time Psalms 139:7 says whether whether shall I go from thy Spirit or whether shall I flee from thy presence Jonah couldn't if I Ascend up into the heaven Thou Art there if I make my bed in hell behold th are there God can get right down into the inside of our motives and our intents Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing of Thunder of Soul and Spirit and the joints and the marrow and it is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart you know we need God to even know where we're at if if God does not come and show us what's inside of us we're lost we think we know so much we're that shows how much we don't know verse 13 neither is there anything that is that is not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open unto the eyes of him with whom we have to do amen obviously God is present everywhere nothing is hid from him even God's presence anoints and blesses his enemies his reain falls on the just and the unjust the good and the evil yet God has a dwelling place I want us to separate that we know God dwells in his word we also know that he has uh many mansions in his house the Bible tells us Isaiah 57:15 we going to think about this dwelling in our hearts here for thus saith the H the high and lofty one one that inhabit eternity whose name is Holy I dwell in the high and holy place and with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones so we see that that God has a dwelling place and it's high above everything he'll come down and he'll bless everybody he'll bless even his enemies he'll show he'll show his goodness to everybody because God is good all the time no one no one no matter what they say against God right many will come to to me in that day and say Lord Lord what about us no one there may be people saying God why weren't you as favorable to us to me as you were to others there'll be people that are actually accusing God just like Satan does but but God will just show them will revealed just how good he really was to them how many chances he really gave to everybody God is a good God but he doesn't dwell with everybody the secret place is with a contrite and a humble spirit that means somebody who chooses to have a spirit around their heart that is the spirit of Christ it isn't like well okay I live over here in Heartland Road and this is my dwelling over here but I'm going to come in I'm going to visit Church it isn't like God dwells in heaven but I'm going to come and I'm going to visit my children or my wife no they have the same Spirit or he's not going to dwell there the same spirit and God's spirit is a humble he's Meek learn of me I'm Meek I'm LLY you look at look at the picture so full of love and compassion yet such power could destroy everything at one moment could create the whole world but yet his Spirit wouldn't want to hurt anybody wouldn't want to do ill has no takes no no uh pleasure in the death of the wicked right there is a dwelling with God it's the very Heart Of God there's a place it's a secret place that he just doesn't unveil it to everybody but we know he Reveals His secrets to those that love him and that's the access into the secret place God dwells in the high and holy place and with a human heart that also is of a contrite and humble spirit it's not two different places it's not like you know some people have two homes well I have one home here I have one in Florida I dwell in both it's not like that we have become the The Dwelling Place of God the bride is the dwelling place of God Jesus said I go to prepare a place for you that where I am there you may be also but a preparation has to take place we have to be concerned about our thoughts we have to be concerned about what kind of spirit we display 24 hours a day we can't just be you know religious and claiming that we're we're we're God's bride because we're in the message and we know certain things it ain't about what we know it's it didn't say about what we know it's about what Spirit we have and and you you don't you don't have a and not display it we're written Epistles read of all men it takes trials to show what kind of spirit we are of it's really what it is without the trial you don't know what you are Paul said in Ephesians 26 that God have raised us up together and made us to sit in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now God is everywhere but there is a secret place for the most high and it is the very Heart Of God I want us when we visualize this secret place this this Heart Of God I want us to visualize the Tabernacle in the wilderness the Tabernacle it had three parts to it right it represented the dwelling of God where God met with his people it was the outer court and it consisted of the Brazen labor the the large water basin and the sacrificial altar that was the outer Court sacrifices were made there the blood was sprinkled there for the worshipper and inside the outer Court was called The Holy place or the sanctuary that's where the showbread was the the golden lampstand and the altar of incense but behind that next Veil inside of that now beyond that was the Ho EST of all that's where the Ark of the Covenant which God contained which contained the sto uh Stone ta tablets with the Ten Commandments the golden pot that had mana and Aaron's bod uh Aaron's Rod that always mded it was it showed that there was life in there because the Mana that was inside the the the second dwelling or the sanctuary it only lasted a week and it had to be changed but the manner that was inside the Ark of the Covenant it never went bad it was always fresh showing that there was life in there and that's where God dwelt see that secret place is where he dwelt Hebrews 93 says after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all and over it the cherabin of Glory shadowing the mercy seed of which we cannot speak particularly of that was the only place notice the the cherubin protected where God dwelt like you know it's protecting you remember when Adam and Eve they left the heart of God they left the heart of God they left the word of God and they fell and God said you know we got to put CH Cher cherubin Angels so they cannot come back and enter God wants all of us for him and our flesh um needs to die out to the word of God so God is everywh but there is a secret place of the most high and it is the very Heart Of God so we see God in the Tabernacle in the wilderness the outer the inner and the holiest of all let's take a look at the next Tabernacle that God met man with and that was in Jesus it was the outer flesh of Jesus and that really veiled God from the world and remember brother Ram taught us that the Pharisees the people that rejected Jesus they could not see God because of the veil because of the flesh but it was that outside flesh that was offered right that was offered at Calvary that outer Court correct it was a it was a flesh without sin now inside his flesh was veiled the sanctuary he spoke daily the bread of life to everyone he gave light to those that were ordained to see the word and he offered up prayers for the father for you and I amen and beyond that veil was the very heart of God the very life of God inside the heart of God was what the love of God that actually came down to offer that sinless body for the world so how many times people looked at Jesus and never saw the heart of God that's why you and I when we're trying to help people sometimes we we try to help them it's the very Heart Of God coming out of but they can't see it because they're looking at the veil God now dwelling in us the outer flesh which needs to be crucified crucified the Deeds of the Flesh and of our will in the inner Sanctuary where we feed on the word of God and we offer up prayers as incense unto the Lord and the holiest of all which is our heart it's where the Lord dwells by the presence of the Holy Spirit not on the flesh yeah he'll come and anoint everybody's flesh not just on the spirit realm not just on that inner realm where we can rejoice in the word but he comes and he dwells inside the very desire of man's heart and and man's desire and God's desire become one right a union takes place and unless that takes place we're missing the very secret place of the most high I inhabit eternity I dwell in the high and holy place and with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble to revive the heart of the contrite ones have you ever seen have you ever been okay I'm just going to say this i' I've said it before I've had people call me and and try to you know sell me something and just tell me that you know what they have to sell me is is really it's really going to be good for me and they're talking real nice to me like they're my friend and what they have to offer is going to help my life and when I tell them I'm not interested it's amazing how quick their Spirit changes well anybody can fake it right God knows the difference between someone who's trying to be it for a moment and him that just dwells in that place tell me who's faking it there's really nothing there to revive right because they're they're not really broken enough and and and God if I can say this understand God wants us to to always dwell in a place of Brokenness I believe you can dwell there and be full of joy you can be happy I don't want to be at a place that he's not dwelling and I know that if I remain humble if I remain contrite if I'm sincere in my heart that God is going to meet Me 2 Corinthians chapter 6:14 says be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship have righteousness with unrighteousness and what communion have light with darkness and what Concord have Christ with b or what part have he that believeth with someone that just doesn't believe and what agreement had the temple of God with Idols here it is for you are the Temple of the Living God and God have said I will dwell in them and walk in them and be their God and they shall be my people amen so what part do we have to play wherefore come out from among them and be ye separate sayeth the Lord and touch not the unclean thing in I will receive you and I will be a father unto you and you shall be my sons and daughters saith the Lord Almighty and he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high shall abide under the shadow of the almighty amen see there's a separation from the way that we normally think to subjecting our mind to the word of God Amen separating from things all the time we should be separating and here's the thing I'm not saying you're going back to drinking again you're going back to smoking again I'm not saying that what I'm saying is I know the devil's throwing thoughts at us all the time and we got to learn on a regular basis to separate from those thoughts keep our minds stay on him Hebrews 8:10 for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayeth the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and I will write them in their hearts that's right and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people you notice the difference there God people showing headship showing his will is above ours yes we are his wife but we need to know our place in the word you know too often we just want to do our thing and say I belong to God and it it just gets us in trouble he that dwelleth in the secret place dwell in the secret place Psalms 91:4 says he shall cover thee with his feathers and under under his wings shall thou trust his truth shall be thy shield and thy buckler Thou shalt not be afraid for the terror by night nor the arrow that fth by day you ever been bothered by the devil I'm all about rebuking the devil but I'm also all four dwelling under those cherubin with the Lord and and if we we get to put our mind on the things of the Lord amen God will meet us there because he's there understand he's not bothered by the terror by day or or by night he he's not bothered by the Enemy No matter how much the Devil comes to him what do he say to what do he say in job where you been Satan they going to and fro not bothered in fact God God prepares a table for us in the presence of our enemies amen he's not afraid we need to dwell in him we would not be afraid dwell in him the the key is learning to dwell in the heart of God and the only way to enter the dwelling place of the heart of the most high is through agape love I want to kind of catch this because you know we love God because he first loved us but understand in the world in the world I had love for people and they loved me people loved me but that is not the love of God there is a distinct difference between human love and God love human love always has boundaries it starts it stops but this agape love it's eternal it's unconditional and I can love you with aape unconditional love and never be loved back by you but when you love God with unconditional love the same love that he loves you with God will open more up to you because God wants to be loved more than just with human love it's all that's ever come before but God is looking for someone that wants his heart to love him unconditionally that I'll just say it like this everyone that ever came to Christ every single person that ever came to Christ and and heard the preaching of the Gospel there was some point in that person's life that they just said I don't want to do that I'm willing to do this but I don't want to do that I don't think I should have to do that are you with me but something inside of that person was attached to something Eternal amen and said even though my flesh I don't want to do this something inside says I love you unconditionally Lord and when we begin to enter into that place that's when a real a real closeness with God starts to happen because I'm telling you there's people that can walk into a church I don't care what kind of church it is and just because everybody's you know acting this way they start acting that way or what they wear they start wearing and I'm not talking about that I'm not trying to conform our flesh into some dos and don'ts and this is how you do things I'm talking about entering into a secret place where you hear the heart of God and something inside of you says I want to be there with him but the B says we could love God every day and still miss it I don't want that kind of love I want to love him with a love that Maps me to the secret place cuz you just don't get there because you just want to right just because your kids want to drive because they want this because they want that because say can I have this can I have that you just don't yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah no they got to prove themselves they be willing to pay the price to show that they can they can be faithful that they here that they're honest that they can handle what you're giving them because you know how many times we heard somebody got rich and the money went to their head somebody got a chance of popularity and what went to their head you understand what I'm saying so God is mapping out the weight into this secret place into the very Heart Of God but it's going to require our love for God not oh I got to go go to church got to pay my ties got to I got to I got to make sure that I'm I'm giving that is not the heart of God God loves a cheerful Giver that's the heart of God the heart of God as I shouldn't have to ask twice if you love me keep my Commandments it's not about just making it to heaven you're not going to make a Rapture without dwelling in the secret place of the most high we've got to to learn that the heart of God is where we want to be the heart of God and love Maps out the directions because he has set his love upon me because he set his love upon me I wonder where our love get set sometimes sometimes we could just trying to build such a future in this world and we can forget to set our love upon God you know we can fill our our our life with so many places we want to go so many things that we want to do so much money we want to make that we forget the heart of God I'll say it like this if what you're doing is getting you closer to God I'll say you're probably on the right track but if what you're doing is keeping you from the heart of God step back and get a better balance because I'm tell we do not have time to waste to get where we need to get to to get into a Rapture there is only just enough time I believe that with all my heart when we set our love upon the heart of God remain there dwell there that's when the blessings come he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble and I will deliver him and I will honor him with long life I will satisfy him and I will show him my salvation you know most people Miss what salvation is because they think salvation is something that happens to them so that they escaped hell they missed that today is the Salvation that I need salvation from all these thoughts I I need I need to be saved on a regular basis I need his peace on a regular basis I need his his healing his his I need his Deliverance I need I need to be under the his feathers I need him every hour you know so most people they come to church not most people excuse me a lot of people they'll come to church because it's time to go to church and they feel that you know they can get attitudes that they don't even really need to go but yet they hang on to this you know I got this salvation missing what salvation really is salvation is to save us from ourself because he has he has made the Lord because thou has made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation thy dwelling we have to make a choice Saints I am going to dwell in Christ I'm going to dwell in his word I'm going to dwell there I'm going to remain there I'm going to remain in the heart of God that's just the outskirts not just I'll tell you if the righteous scarcely make it to me would you want to marry somebody whose attitude was I'll just do barely what I need to do to get by I'll tell I want to marry somebody that's in love with me I don't want to marry somebody that just I don't know all the reasons people get married I don't know but I'll just say it like this with God God is interested in our heart and he wants to marry somebody he wants a bride whose heart is after him after him I want us to remember that's the only way into God's secret place which is the heart of God is through love through love so when you're wanting to get in that that secret place I want you to think about loving him I believer will never be able to find the secret place outside of the love of God love Maps out the directions Jesus said here in John 14 21 he that have my Commandments he that has my word he that that hears the word preached and and keeps them he it is that loveth me so he's identifying the true person that loves him and he that loveth me is going to be loved by my father I thought God loves everybody that there's a special love when you love God back with his word there is there's a reciprocation that comes back more I know he loves everybody but I'm telling you when you love him a reciprocation comes back and that love grows and I will love him and I will manifest myself to him there's something that happens when you take the word of God seriously that God will just take as it were his shirt open it up and manifest himself to us that's the kind of love that I want to be around am I want God to manifest himself to me now Judas we could say he's in church this morning Judas saith unto him not a scariot though a different Judas he said Lord how is it that thou are going to manifest thyself unto all of us but not unto the world here was the answer Jesus said if a man love me he will keep my words and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our Abode with him no more just the spirit jumping on us prophesying speaking in tugs dancing in the spirit doing many wonderful works not just a blessing on the outside because all that can happen without keeping God's word all of it but to be serious about God's word that's what opens the heart of God that says I will come and make my abold with him I tell you when you've been in the presence of the Lord you do not want to get out when you're there you say God don't ever let me leave this place we know that David was a man after God's Own Heart he sought the secret place of the most high God is as God is is seeking those that will worship Him in spirit truth God is also seeking those who is looking to dwell in his heart because not everybody wants to people don't mind doing their due Justice and go to church and listen to a tape and do some prayers but after they're done their their mind and their heart is in different areas and I'm not saying God is not thankful when we don't come to when we come to church or or when we read and when we pray I'm sure that God is but God is looking for a special relationship with his wife someone who says I am putting things aside to to reciprocate this unconditional love back to my heavenly father to my husband he that dwelleth in the secret place of the most high Colossians 3:2 says set your affections on things above not on the things of the Earth for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God hid in Christ with God I many times we are brother Brandon me even Jesus he' say this he said the world don't know you because it didn't know me Christ was hid from the world he hides himself from the wise and prudent you know some people I I'll tell you you know the Bible says the rich have many friends if somebody can use you they probably will true but if there's something in them that can't use you they won't people want God for many reasons and not that there's anything in God that he doesn't want want to help everybody for all the reasons but imagine God looking down all that ever came before me are thiefs and robbers he's looking who loves me who loves me with this unconditional love who's willing to give up more of their heart from me from my heart I believe God is calling the bride to a place that no other church member can go that's why this this this this kind of ministry can can maybe seem like a a little hard or a little a little too much but it's really to the bride he's calling a bride out of a church he will have a Rapture I believe with all my heart there will be people from this church that make a Rapture I believe that with all my heart there is no doubt about it love is the key into the secret place with God Psalms 18 vers1 says I will love thee oh Lord my strength I will love thee the Lord is my rock my Fortress my deliverer my God my strength in whom I will trust my buckler my horn of my salvation my high toow David said I will love thee oh Lord my strength too many people want God to be their Fortress their deliverer their strength their buckler their salvation they refuse to love them refuse to love them back enough enough to keep the word that God's been trying to tell them to do you know many you know many people come to church they have this attitude I love God I serve God my way refuse to line up with part of the word and say they love God you know the thing is there's many things that God wants to tell us right many things he wants us to do but if we don't come to church with that desire God help me to do the things that I'm not doing instead of I'm glad I'm here doing this and I feel this is good enough God is looking for such a closeness we don't want to miss it amen the dwelling place is the love of God to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might this is the heart of God Amen John 15 verse one time is slipping by and I want to try to get into this we know that was the Commandment that God wanted us to keep to love the Lord with all of our our heart now if I don't know my heart I need to ask God I need to be sincere and ask God God how much of my heart am I loving you with instead of just assuming I love God with all my heart because if I'm a human being I I probably needing to give up some more amen amen that's that's why that humble and contrite spirit is always needed right John 151 I am the True Vine my father's the husbandman every branch in me that beareth not fruit is he taketh away and every branch that does bear fruit he purchase it that he may bring forth more fruit see we see the very Heart Of God that he just wants more and more and more and more I'm okay with that I'm okay with that I need that my flesh May don't want that but I know that I need that now you are clean through the word which I spoken unto you why does the word clean you because when you say Amen you say so be it in my life clean me up Lord I accept the word I accept this it's not about the word clobbering you over the head it's about the word cleaning you right but here's the difference if you feel clobbered your heart's not in it because if you love the word you're you're not going to get offended right oh great peace have they that love my word nothing shall offend them so the word comes in and it it it cleans us a little bit more I tell you when you receive the word you know what you're doing you're loving God back with unconditional love that opens the door for him to manifest himself more to [Music] us verse four abide in me abide I'll say he says this like oh one two three four five six seven times in the next three verses seven times he uses this word abide abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the Vine no more can you except you abide in me now I'm the vine you're the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me you can do nothing if a man abide not in me in other words he just comes and goes just comes and goes to church just comes and goes to Christ just comes and goals with with the grips of I'm going to obey the Bible and I'm going to get in the message just comes and goes it's not abiding if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned but if you abide in me and my words abide in you then you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you look at the blessing that come from abiding you know too many people want to reject that and just say you know whatever you say in the name of the Lord you'll have it you got to take the whole word and God is really I'm not saying that God in my name they shall cast out Devils abiding or not yeah exactly but we're we're not talking about hey let's just get power over sharpens and you know uh Judas had all that but there there there there wasn't a a desire in his heart to abide and and this calling that God is calling the bride to is to abide now that word abide it has the same meaning as he that dwelleth in the secret place it means to stay in relation it means to continue to dwell to endure to be present to remain to stand to Tar same we got to stay there amen it's the hardest thing to do the easiest thing to do is repent get baptized I'm starting for you Lord and how Satan comes with his swiftness oh I'm there I'm I did it it's over I'm saved but if you really don't truly get saved you'll simply go back and your life will not be in Christ and how many people have done that more than ever did stay more than ever did stay now we need to dwell there because we need the presence of God it's our safety and we when we dwell or abide in the heart of of God the love of God the presence of God we have safety and also it's only in that place that true things can happen I mean God can deliver us God can Deliver Us from things we're not dwelling there God can God can Deliver Us from spirits but we do realize that seven worse Spirits demons can come back upon us because of not entering into that Dwelling Place that secret place to where you're dwelling with God now there is where life changes nature changes not only old things are passed away but behold All Things become new see there's a difference that takes place and we need to get in the presence of God more and more and learn how to dwell there how to how to remain there because Satan's flying with all these thoughts and trying to get us distracted and off track so we got to learn to dwell there you ever been driving down the road and listening to music talking to somebody maybe on your phone excuse me and um you get distracted the tires go off the road and all a sudden you hear the happens a couple times and then you realize I need to dwell right here in the middle it's just natural amen things happen it's it's not that we're bad it it just we we'll understand if we're going to get to the place we need to get to we need to be the ones putting forth the effort because God wants to help us with all that we need have need of but we got to we got to cry out to them right in the message invisible Union of the bride of Christ brother says we're at the end time so what does it have to do now he said let lay in the presence of the s o n to be Ren ripened that's exact the word to be ripened into your heart to bring forth and live what we're talking about amen it's one thing to agree with the word it's another thing to let that word sit there and just lay in the presence of the Holy Spirit and let it begin to ripen shape our heart change our thinking get us to a place where we begin to manifest the very thing we're saying Amen to are you with me he says but oh how the church needs to lay in the presence till it tenders up you know and gets sweet in the spirit so that it can just bathe down what a what a precious quote there are certain things that only happen in the presence of God Amen brother brandham said in the message Abraham he says here was Moses in the presence of the burning bush his was better equipped in five minutes in the presence of God than 80 years of schooling had given him and I hope that don't hurt but I hope it sinks in real deep he in Divine love he says one day God come down in a little Burning Bush Moses known more about what he had to do what his future was and what he had to do in five minutes in the presence of God than all his Egyptian strategy that had taught him in 40 years manifesting his gifts brother Braham says now his mother had taught him that he was to be the emancipator of amen all these things had been taught by his mother by teachers by the schools and yet he knew no more about God yet he knew more about God in just five minutes in the presence of that light yes so I'm going to say I want to say this to everybody it's wonderful that we listen to the tapes it's wonderful that we read our Bible it's wonderful that we come to church and we should but the thing that we should be seeking is the presence of God when that's happening because we could spend hours in church just like in schooling but just five minutes in his presence things open up Jehovah Gyra five minutes in the presence of Christ he took off his shoes and he respected it I don't understand you get people sometimes they come to church they don't have respect for God's house they don't come in they don't care what attitude they have they don't care what's hanging on them they don't care what spiritual clothes are on them because they're not walking they haven't come from God's presence they don't live in God's presence God's presence isn't in their home how we need the realness of God can you bear with me just a little bit Psalms 84:10 for a day in thy courts is better than a thousand I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God than to dwell in the tents of the wicked a doorkeeper you hardly can't get anybody to do anything for for the church anymore just too busy for the Lord God is the son and his shield the Lord will give Grace and Glory no good thing will he withhold from them that walk uprightly amen that doesn't mean do something uprightly once in a while it's a dwelling oh lord of hosts blessed is the man that trusteth thee Psalms 27:1 the Lord is my light and my salvation Whom Shall I Fear the Lord is my strength the strength of my life of whom shall I be afraid when the wicked even my enemies and my foes Came Upon me to eat up my flesh they stumbled and they fell though a host should encamp against me my heart shall not fear the heart shall not fear because that heart is dwelling with God Amen though War should rise up against me and this so I be confident one thing have I desired of the Lord and that why seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life to behold the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple I don't know what people do with that with they they dread going to church once a week you know I don't know what they do with that you know they go it's probably the most miserable place to to be for a Believer when they have to go to church when they feel they have to go to church but they're desire just isn't there a a a not a very very fun place to be but to have a heart to always want to dwell in the presence of God no matter where you're at no matter the store or the car wherever you're at you can dwell in his Tabernacle amen amen or in the time of trouble he shall hide thee in his Pavilion you know too too many people wait till they get in trouble and then here's another thing I don't want to keep preaching because my time is up but here's the the a thing when people begin to call on the Lord and he doesn't answer he doesn't help them in the time of trouble you know what some of those people do they quit they say see it doesn't matter in other words church or God just becomes of formality they never had that personal relationship with them that keeps them with our relationship with God you know why why do we expect God to just I mean God is merciful but we got to truly truly turn around truly repent truly make a decision I'm going to serve you and I'm going to dwell in your previl I'm going to dwell in your secret place for in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his Pavilion in the secret in the secret of his Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set me upon a revelation and now shall my head be lifted up above my enemies round about me therefore I offer in his Tabernacle sacrifices of Joy will sing yay will sing praises unto the Lord let's Stand Together Saints in the message DED dedication of the building to the Lord Brother BR says all that perfect rest that come from the congre ation to the altar from the altar to the bosom of Christ in the bed at night the secret place that resting place with Christ and in the hidden life just one quick word he says and every man or boy or woman or girl that is ever anointed of God and Walks Behind the temple the veil of God the Holy Ghost and puts him in a secret place the veil drops behind him and the world and all the things are cut off behind him there's a difference between dwelling and just checking it out and I believe that God is calling the bride to dwell and those of us that are dwelling to dwell more Amen to dwell more this I believe God just saying love me a little bit more he's just wanting to be loved A little bit more is there anybody here anybody here that doesn't want to hear the words I love you no we all want to hear the words I love you that's right so does God and you know what it's like for somebody to say I love you you but you don't feel it you can't get warned by a painted fire it needs to be real and and Jesus said why why you call me Lord Lord do not the things I say the love he wanting to feel from us is giving up our will to do his will that means we've got to find out what is it that he wants us to do that we're we're not quite doing the way he wants us to do and walk in that and that really shows him that's like saying I love you I love you let's just sing that little chorus I I I love him I love him I love him I love him cuz he first loved me aren't you thankful for that and purchase my [Music] Sal on tree I love him I love him [Music] because he first loved me purchase my Sal on calary free let's just close our eyes and lift our hands to him I love him I love him because he first

ever ever felt that kind of love before Paul did as much as Paul knew so much that he almost couldn't handle it right but something inside of him yearning to know the heart of God and we know we can't do 40 Years of learning you know we can study this message and never know God but if we could just seek to get into his presence things can change amen let's bow our heart I wonder if there be anyone here today say brother John do you remember me I want I want to dwell in this secret place so much more than I have been you in your homes you that are watching the archive just lift your heart before
