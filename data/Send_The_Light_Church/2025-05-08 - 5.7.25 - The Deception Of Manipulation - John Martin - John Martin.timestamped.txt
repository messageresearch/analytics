[33:09] Father, we count it a privilege to be
[33:12] your children
[33:14] today and to know that no matter what
[33:18] happens to us around us, that we have an
[33:24] anchor within the veil.
[33:28] that our soul is eternally attached to
[33:31] you and nothing can separate us from
[33:35] you. God, we thank you that we could
[33:38] come to your house
[33:39] today and feed upon the word of God that
[33:45] would help us to become more like you,
[33:48] that we might be in the place that you
[33:50] would have us to be. You we know that
[33:53] you're calling us, Lord. You're calling
[33:55] us and we remember the day that you
[33:58] called us unto
[34:00] salvation. And God, we're thankful for
[34:02] that day that we heard your voice. And
[34:05] we're thankful today that you're still
[34:07] calling. You're still calling us higher
[34:09] and closer. You're giving us a greater
[34:13] understanding of what it means to be in
[34:14] your image and your likeness. And one
[34:17] day, Lord, we'll be leaving in a
[34:18] rapture. And Father, we just want to
[34:21] thank you with all of our hearts today
[34:23] for you in our lives. We invite your
[34:26] presence in the remainder of this
[34:28] service. We thank you that we could
[34:30] worship you today and give our heart and
[34:34] this song. And Lord, I just pray that if
[34:37] there's any that just feel that
[34:40] something's hanging over them, I just
[34:42] pray that the blood of Jesus Christ
[34:44] would cover every one of us today, Lord.
[34:47] that we could be set free by your
[34:49] blood, Lord, that we could enter into
[34:52] your word at this time and and receive
[34:55] from you the things that we have need
[34:57] of. God, thou knows what we have need
[34:59] of. And though, Lord, the subject, Lord,
[35:02] that you would be given today, Lord, may
[35:05] not be perhaps what would be upon your
[35:08] people's heart, but there may be other
[35:10] needs. I pray not a need that there
[35:13] would be here today would not be met
[35:15] somehow spoken. Faith would be given
[35:18] through the word that would be
[35:20] ministered today that would go forth to
[35:22] anchor in the heart of your people that
[35:24] they could have confidence that Lord you
[35:27] will meet that need. Father we thank you
[35:30] for these things. Thank you for our
[35:31] brother Marty that he could be with us
[35:33] Lord. Now Lord, we just commit the
[35:36] furtherance of this service into your
[35:38] hands and ask your blessings now on the
[35:40] reading of the word. In Jesus Christ's
[35:42] name we pray. Amen. Amen. Turn with me
[35:45] if you would in the Bible to the book of
[35:48] Ephesians chapter
[35:50] 1. Ephesians chapter 1. We're going to
[35:53] read three verses there.
[36:08] Starting with verse number nine.
[36:10] Ephesians chapter 1 verse number nine.
[36:16] having made known unto us the mystery of
[36:19] his will, according to his good
[36:21] pleasure, which he hath purposed in
[36:24] himself, that in the dispensation of the
[36:28] fullness of times, he might gather
[36:31] together in one all things in Christ,
[36:35] both which are in heaven, which are on
[36:37] earth, even in him. In whom also we have
[36:41] obtained an inheritance, being
[36:44] predestinated according to the purpose
[36:47] of him who workketh all
[36:51] things after the counsel of his own
[36:55] will. Amen. God bless you. You may be
[36:57] seated
[36:59] today. We want to be focusing on here
[37:02] just a little bit. God who works all
[37:05] things after the counsel of his own
[37:08] will. With a showing of hands today, I
[37:12] would like to ask this question. Has any
[37:14] has anyone ever been manipulated
[37:21] before? It might be a common thing. It's
[37:25] a subject I never spoke on before, but
[37:27] we'd like to today. How many has ever
[37:31] manipulated someone
[37:34] before? Amen. So, we know that this is a
[37:37] a real situation. Manipulation is a real
[37:40] thing. And we like to entitle this the
[37:42] deception of man manipulation. And we
[37:44] want our subject to be on battling the
[37:46] spirit of manipulation. But as we before
[37:49] we get into that, I kind of want to lay
[37:50] a foundation. And I wanted to take both
[37:52] sides. And here in verse 11, the Bible
[37:55] says that God workketh all things after
[37:57] the counsel of his own will. He works
[38:00] everything after the council of his
[38:02] will.
[38:04] He gets in there and he works everything
[38:07] for his own will. Right? So when I look
[38:09] at this, I say, is this manipulation?
[38:14] Because he's actually getting there kind
[38:15] of controlling.
[38:18] That's right. Amen. Let's turn to
[38:21] Genesis chapter
[38:24] 27. Genesis chapter
[38:27] 27. And everybody knows the story. Most
[38:31] of us know the
[38:33] story
[38:34] about Jacob and and Esau.
[38:43] Um, and we know that
[38:52] um that Jacob stole the blessing from
[38:56] Esau and he was uh considered to be a
[39:00] suppler. Uhhuh.
[39:03] And and and I just I want to get into
[39:06] this because I want us to see what the
[39:08] real spirit of manipulation is. And I
[39:10] want to start with verse one. We're
[39:11] going to do a lot of reading here. And
[39:12] it came to pass when Isaac was old and
[39:15] his eyes were dimmed. So they could not
[39:17] see. He called Esau his eldest son, and
[39:20] said unto him, "My son." And he said
[39:22] unto him, "Behold, I am here." And he
[39:24] said, "Behold, now I am old. I'm not uh
[39:27] but the day of my death. And now
[39:30] therefore, take, I pray, thee, thy
[39:32] weapons, and quiver, and thy bow, and go
[39:34] out to the field, and take some of
[39:36] venison, and make me savor a meat such
[39:38] as I love, and bring it to me, and I
[39:40] pray, eat uh that I that my soul may
[39:43] bless thee before I die." And Rebecca
[39:45] heard when Isaac spake to Esau, his son,
[39:48] and and Esau went to the field to hunt
[39:50] for venison, and to bring it. And
[39:53] Rebecca spake unto Jacob her son,
[39:55] saying, Behold, I have heard thy father
[39:58] speak unto Esau, thy brother, saying,
[40:00] Bring me venison, and make me a savoring
[40:02] meat, that I may eat and bless thee
[40:04] before the Lord uh uh before the Lord
[40:08] before my death. Now therefore, my son,
[40:10] obey my voice according to that which I
[40:12] command thee. Go now to the flock, and
[40:14] fetch me from then two goat kids.
[40:19] uh two I'm sorry two good two two good
[40:23] kids of
[40:24] gold and I will make them savoring meat
[40:28] for thy father such as he loveth and
[40:30] thou shalt bring it to thy father that
[40:33] he may eat and that they may that he may
[40:37] bless thee before his death and Jacob
[40:40] said to his
[40:41] mother behold Esau my brother is a hairy
[40:45] man and I'm a smooth man and my father
[40:48] pre-venture will feel me, and I shall
[40:51] seem to him as a
[40:54] deceiver, and I shall bring a curse upon
[40:56] me, and not a blessing." And his mother
[40:59] said unto him, "Upon me be thy curse, my
[41:03] son. Only obey my voice, and go fetch me
[41:09] them." And he went, and he fetched, and
[41:12] brought them to his mother. And his
[41:13] mother made savory meat such as his
[41:16] father loved. And Rebecca took the
[41:18] goodly rayman of the eldest son, Esau,
[41:21] which was with her in the house, and uh
[41:23] put it on them, uh her on Jacob, her
[41:26] younger son. And she put uh the skins of
[41:30] the kids, goats, upon the hands, oh my.
[41:33] And upon the smooth of his neck. And she
[41:35] gave the savoring meat and the bread
[41:38] which he which she had prepared unto the
[41:41] hand of her son Jacob. And he came unto
[41:43] his father and said, "My father." And he
[41:46] said, "Here am I. Who art thou my son?"
[41:48] And Jacob said unto this father, "I am
[41:51] Esau, my f thy firstborn, and I have
[41:54] done according as thou as had bed uh
[41:57] baddest
[41:59] me arise, I pray thee, and sit and eat
[42:02] of my venison, that thy soul may bless
[42:06] me." And Isaac said unto his son, How is
[42:09] it that thou hast found it so quickly,
[42:11] my son? And he said, "Because the Lord
[42:13] thy God brought it to me." And Isaac
[42:16] said unto Jacob, "Come near, I pray
[42:18] thee, and I may feel thee, and my son,
[42:21] whether thou be my very son, Esau, or
[42:24] not." And Jacob went in and uh near unto
[42:27] his father, Isaac his father. And he
[42:30] felt him, and said, "The voice is
[42:32] Jacob's voice, but the hands are the
[42:34] hands of Esau." And he discerned him not
[42:37] because his hands were hairy. This his
[42:39] brother Esau's hands. So he blessed him
[42:42] and he said, "Art thou my very son
[42:45] Esau?" And he said, "I am." And he said,
[42:48] "Bring it near me that I may eat of the
[42:51] son venison of my son's venison, and my
[42:54] soul may bless thee." And it brought it
[42:57] to him near. And he did eat, and he
[42:59] brought him wine and drank. And his
[43:01] father Isaac said, "Come near." And
[43:04] kissed me, my son. And he came near and
[43:06] kissed him and smelt the remnant and
[43:08] blessed him and said, uh, the smell of
[43:11] my son is the smell of the field which
[43:13] the Lord have blessed. Therefore God
[43:15] give of the dew of heaven and the
[43:17] fatness of the earth and plenty of corn
[43:19] and wine. Let not uh let people serve
[43:22] thee, nations bow down to thee. Be lord
[43:26] over thy brethren, and let thy mother's
[43:28] son bow down to thee. Cursed be everyone
[43:31] that cursseeth thee, and blessed be he
[43:33] that blesseth thee. And it came to pass,
[43:37] we we know the story here that um Jacob
[43:41] came or Esau came in later and and and
[43:45] realized that the blessing
[43:48] um was really taken away from Esau. And
[43:53] he said to uh his father Isaac,
[43:58] um is it is it possible that there's one
[44:00] more blessing left for me? Just just
[44:03] bless me. And he said, I I cannot
[44:06] because the blessing already went to
[44:09] Esau. Now, when I look at this
[44:13] situation,
[44:15] was
[44:17] God
[44:19] manipulating the situation?
[44:25] Was
[44:27] um Jacob manipulating the
[44:31] situation? Was Rebecca manipulating the
[44:36] situation? We can look at this situation
[44:39] and say they really manipulated the
[44:44] situation. But I want to make it real
[44:46] clear. They were not manipulators.
[44:53] And we're going to find out why they
[44:55] this is not called manipulation.
[44:58] Romans chapter 9 verse 10 tells
[45:01] us and not only this but when Rebecca
[45:04] also conceived by one even by her father
[45:07] Isaac for the children being not yet
[45:10] born neither having done good or evil
[45:12] that the purpose of God according to
[45:13] election might stand out of works but of
[45:15] him that calleth. It was said unto her,
[45:18] "The elder shall serve the younger, and
[45:20] as it is written, Jacob have I loved,
[45:21] and Esau have I
[45:26] hated." What shall we say then? Is there
[45:28] unrighteousness with God?
[45:32] God
[45:34] forbid. God did not manipulate the
[45:37] situation.
[45:38] And
[45:40] Jacob did not steal the birthight. That
[45:45] is right. Genesis chapter 25 28 Genesis
[45:49] chapter 25 28 And Isaac loved Esau
[45:53] because he did eat of his venison, but
[45:55] Rebecca loved Jacob. And Jacob saw
[45:58] pottage and Esau came from the field and
[46:00] was faint. And Esau said to Jacob, "Feed
[46:04] me, I pray thee, with the same red
[46:07] pottage, for I faint." Therefore his
[46:10] name call his name called Edom. And
[46:14] Jacob said, "Sell me this day thy
[46:18] birthright." Sell me this day thy
[46:21] birthright. So this really happened
[46:24] quite a bit before the blessing that was
[46:26] given. Amen.
[46:28] And Esau said, "Behold, I'm at the point
[46:31] of to die, and what shall it profit me
[46:32] to have this birthright do to me?" And
[46:35] Jacob said, "Swear to me this day." And
[46:37] he swore unto him, and he sold his
[46:39] birthight unto Jacob. So, did Jacob
[46:43] steal it? No. No. He Esau freely gave
[46:47] him the birthright. Amen. And Jacob gave
[46:50] Esau bread and potted lentils. And he
[46:54] did eat and drink and rose up and went
[46:55] his way. And Esau despised his
[46:59] birthright. Esau despised the
[47:01] opportunity to be born right with a
[47:04] correct nature. Yes.
[47:07] He had the opportunity to come to church
[47:10] and get a new nature change and take
[47:13] advantage of of of of being like Christ,
[47:17] but he despised it. It didn't mean
[47:20] anything to
[47:21] him. And so it is with so many
[47:24] Christians today.
[47:26] They don't mind going to church. They
[47:28] don't mind being called a Christian. But
[47:31] they despise a nature change.
[47:34] Because they got to give up their life,
[47:36] their heart for it. Amen.
[47:40] Esau despised God's purpose for his
[47:43] life. And God hated him for that.
[47:47] But God loved
[47:48] Jacob because he would do whatever he
[47:51] had to do to get born again, to get that
[47:53] birthright.
[47:56] So I say to you, is God a manipulator?
[48:01] No, God did not
[48:07] manipulate. Neither did
[48:10] Rebecca. She heard from God.
[48:13] And it was God's will for Jacob to
[48:16] receive the birthright. Amen.
[48:20] You cannot
[48:22] manipulate God's will. Right?
[48:29] God is not a manipulator. Just because
[48:32] God works out all things after the
[48:33] council of his will, it doesn't mean
[48:35] he's a
[48:39] manipulator. God's own will ultimately
[48:42] will be done. Amen. God is the only one
[48:46] that's allowed to rearrange anything he
[48:48] wants to rearrange to accomplish what he
[48:51] wants because he's God and he's above
[48:53] everything. Amen.
[48:55] Colossians 1:15 says, "Who is in the
[48:57] image of the invisible God, the
[48:59] firstborn of every creature? For by him
[49:01] were all things created that are in
[49:04] heaven, that are in earth, visible and
[49:05] invisible, whether they be thrones,
[49:07] dominions, principalities, powers, all
[49:08] things were created by him." And what?
[49:12] For him. Amen. He created everything for
[49:15] himself. He is the only one that's
[49:18] allowed to rearrange everything to make
[49:20] it come out the way he wants it to come
[49:22] and not be a manipulator. Right. That is
[49:25] right. And he is before all things, and
[49:27] by him all things consist. And he is the
[49:29] head of the body, the the church, who is
[49:32] the beginning, the firstborn from the
[49:34] dead, that in all
[49:37] things he might have the preeminence.
[49:40] Amen. God is allowed to be God.
[49:44] He's allowed to do whatever he wants,
[49:46] and it's perfect when he does it. He's
[49:49] allow He's allowed to rearrange things.
[49:52] He's allowed to speak his word. He's
[49:54] allowed to work all things up to the
[49:55] council of his own will. For he is God.
[49:58] He is the Lord of lords. He's the King
[49:59] of Kings. His will will be done. When
[50:02] everything is done, the word of God will
[50:04] be standing and his will will be done.
[50:06] He works out everything after the
[50:08] council of his own will. It is not
[50:10] manipulation to do the will of God.
[50:13] That's right.
[50:16] God is not a manipulator.
[50:19] He does not
[50:21] abuse people.
[50:25] God respects free moral, free will, free
[50:28] moral agency. He respects
[50:31] it. God allows people to live in the
[50:34] world if that's where they want to live.
[50:36] If people want to be lukewarm, yes, he
[50:39] would rather have them cold or hot, but
[50:41] if they want to be lukewarm, he lets
[50:42] them be lukewarm. He doesn't manipulate
[50:45] them. He doesn't try to uh get them uh
[50:48] to control their lives.
[50:51] That is right. He's a
[50:54] gentleman. He doesn't try to control
[50:56] them against their will for God's
[50:59] personal gain. That's right.
[51:03] Look at the rich young ruler.
[51:06] Lived what what we say almost a perfect
[51:09] life. Kept the commandments for his his
[51:11] youth up. and he even come running uh
[51:15] what what what must I do to be saved to
[51:17] have eternal life and and and expressing
[51:20] all these great things that he did says
[51:23] look just one thing you got to do just
[51:24] get rid of this put your heart into
[51:26] serving me
[51:30] and that price was too great a price to
[51:33] pay right amen but God didn't manipulate
[51:36] him
[51:38] he let him go
[51:40] because God respects free more
[51:42] agency. God is not a
[51:45] manipulator. God doesn't try to control
[51:48] people's will against their free will.
[51:51] He just
[51:53] doesn't. So when God tells us to go into
[51:55] all the world and preach the gospel to
[51:57] every creature, it's not manipulation.
[51:59] It's the will of
[52:01] God. God has given us talents. And he
[52:04] says, "When I come back, I want to see
[52:06] something that's going to profit my
[52:07] kingdom."
[52:09] He wants to see souls. say that when
[52:11] souls is wise then the reward comes for
[52:13] them that does the will of God.
[52:17] God is not a manipulator.
[52:20] Second Corinthians 5:9 says, "Wherefore
[52:22] we labor that whether we be present or
[52:24] absent, we may be accepted of him."
[52:27] Amen. For we must all appear before the
[52:29] judgment seat of Christ, that everyone
[52:31] may receive of the things which he has
[52:33] done in his body, whether it be whe uh
[52:36] according to what they have done,
[52:37] whether it be good or bad. So there's
[52:39] always a reward coming, right? Amen.
[52:42] Knowing therefore the terror of the
[52:45] Lord, we persuade men.
[52:50] We are made manifest unto God. And I
[52:52] trust also manifest in your conscience.
[52:55] So when we persuade somebody, when we
[52:58] work and say, "Look, God is the only
[53:01] way. If you don't give your heart to
[53:02] Jesus Christ, he is the only way, the
[53:04] only truth, the only life. You got to
[53:06] give your heart before you die. You're
[53:07] not going to make it. When we do that,
[53:09] we're persuading men. We are not
[53:12] manipulating them. The truth. Why?
[53:15] Because that's the will of God.
[53:18] Because that's the will of God. I would
[53:20] that all men would be saved. And he
[53:22] gives a chance to call and and and
[53:25] and give every man a chance.
[53:29] He doesn't force them,
[53:32] but he deals with them.
[53:36] So when we're doing the will of God,
[53:38] it's never manipulation. Amen.
[53:42] God's spirit is not a manipulative
[53:44] spirit.
[53:47] Satan is a manipulator.
[53:50] Satan isn't
[53:53] God. The devil didn't create anything,
[53:56] nor can he create anything for his
[53:58] pleasure. That's right. Yet he still
[54:01] wants to have preeminence and he wants
[54:04] to have control over heaven and earth.
[54:08] So he'll manipulate every situation to
[54:10] get control for what? His personal gain.
[54:15] Amen.
[54:17] Isaiah 14:13, Lucifer said in his heart,
[54:20] I will ascend into heaven. I will exalt
[54:22] my throne above the th stars of God. I
[54:24] will sit upon the mountain of the
[54:26] congregation in the sides of the north.
[54:29] I will ascend above the heights of the
[54:31] clouds. I will be like the most high. I
[54:33] I I I For what reason? Personal gain.
[54:39] I can't create any angels. You know what
[54:40] I'm going to do? I'm going to go try to
[54:42] deceive a third of them.
[54:45] Personal gain. Can you imagine Satan
[54:47] alone with no
[54:49] angels? He can't be in all the places at
[54:51] one time. What a better world this we'd
[54:55] be in, right? Yeah.
[54:57] But he manipulated them. Said, "You know
[55:00] what? You can just have your own way.
[55:01] You don't have to listen to him. You can
[55:02] do what you want to do. I'm telling you,
[55:04] you're going to be so much happier with
[55:05] me."
[55:07] He manipulated him. Came down the most
[55:09] subto beast, manipulated that most
[55:11] subtile beast to do his will to get
[55:14] personal gain. Amen. Which in return
[55:16] received the same spirit, manipulated
[55:18] Eve.
[55:21] Amen. Satan is a manipulator.
[55:26] And in order to achieve his personal
[55:28] gain, he manipulates situations. All
[55:33] situations. And the only thing that can
[55:35] set a man free from manipulation is the
[55:38] word of God. That's right. Amen. The
[55:41] only thing that can set a man free from
[55:43] a spirit of manipulation is the word of
[55:45] God. Amen. You shall know the truth and
[55:49] the truth shall make you free.
[55:52] See, because here's the thing about
[55:54] manipulation. It's deceptive.
[56:00] It's deceptive.
[56:02] The devil does not want you to know what
[56:05] he's doing.
[56:09] Satan is always to try to keep the word
[56:12] of God from people because that's what
[56:14] sets him free. I read a couple decrees
[56:17] of the council of tool l in 1229 AD.
[56:23] This is when they were trying to keep
[56:25] the word from the people. He says we
[56:27] prohibit also that the leoty should be
[56:30] permitted to have the books of the old
[56:32] testament or the new testament but we
[56:35] strictly forbid their having any
[56:37] translation of these books.
[56:40] In 1234
[56:43] AD, another council, a ruling said, "No
[56:47] man may possess the books of the Old
[56:50] Testament or the New Testament in the
[56:53] Romans language. And if anyone possesses
[56:55] them, he must turn them over to the
[56:57] local bishop within eight days for
[57:01] progation of this decree so that they
[57:04] may be burned."
[57:09] God does not want the word in our heart
[57:14] because this word is what unveils what
[57:16] Satan's trying to do to us.
[57:20] And today people would rather go to
[57:22] church and have dogmas in the word.
[57:25] Amen. They'd rather have opinions,
[57:27] ideas, entertainment, enjoyment in
[57:29] church rather than just preach the
[57:31] truth. Amen. And it's a sad
[57:34] situation, but you know, to be honest
[57:36] with you, most people are uncomfortable
[57:38] with the truth.
[57:41] They they'd rather they'd rather sit
[57:43] without an uncomfortableness
[57:46] and never never grow with Christ
[57:49] and be okay with that.
[57:51] Satan set out to conquer the leoty. Y
[57:56] Jesus speaking in the first church age
[57:58] at Ephesus, Revelations 2:3, it says,
[58:01] "And has born and has patience and for
[58:04] my name's sake has labored and has not
[58:06] fainted." Speaking of the church, it's
[58:08] the first church age. Nevertheless, I
[58:11] have so much to say against thee,
[58:12] because thou has left thy first love. So
[58:14] here, the very first church age, they
[58:17] begin to leave their first love. Amen.
[58:20] Remember therefore from whence thou art
[58:22] fallen, repent and do thy first works,
[58:23] or else I come quickly. I come unto thee
[58:26] quickly, and will remove thy candlestick
[58:28] out of this place, except thou repent.
[58:30] But this thou
[58:32] has that thou hatest the deeds of the
[58:35] nickelans, which also I hate, which
[58:38] means to conquer the people, to conquer
[58:41] the leoty, to take control of the
[58:45] church. God does not, Satan does not
[58:48] want the Holy Spirit in control of the
[58:50] church. That's right.
[58:53] He just assumed everybody be suppressed.
[58:57] That's right.
[58:59] Well, you know, you go to some churches
[59:01] and you feel so
[59:04] good, but you're not set free. Hey, I
[59:08] can go to a concert. I can go to any
[59:09] worldly event and feel good and not be
[59:13] set free. It's not about feeling good.
[59:16] It's about the word delivering you from
[59:18] what Satan has put on your life. Amen.
[59:22] Now, Satan wanted to put the men in
[59:24] control of the church. Why? To
[59:26] manipulate people.
[59:28] We've heard of politics in the church
[59:30] before, have we not? What does it do? It
[59:34] manipulates things.
[59:36] We've heard of abusing the
[59:39] pulpit to manipulate for personal gain.
[59:43] We've heard of isms in the church,
[59:44] schisms in the church that can
[59:47] manipulate things. We've heard of gossip
[59:49] and backbiting in the church can
[59:51] manipulate
[59:53] things. The spirit of iniquity was
[59:56] already working in the first church age.
[59:58] Amen. The devil is getting the getting
[1:00:01] the people to fall out of love with
[1:00:03] Jesus. Just come to church. Just do
[1:00:05] these works. Same old, same
[1:00:07] old, but don't have your heart into it.
[1:00:09] Just come, but don't have your heart
[1:00:11] into it. and they began to fall out of
[1:00:14] love with Jesus. And by the time that
[1:00:17] the last church
[1:00:19] age was done, the people had
[1:00:23] literally completely fallen in love with
[1:00:25] themselves.
[1:00:27] That's right. Lovers of themselves more
[1:00:30] than lovers of
[1:00:33] God. And that's exactly what Satan
[1:00:36] wanted. Manipulating the church.
[1:00:40] The devil's number one job is to
[1:00:42] manipulate you. Amen. To control you. To
[1:00:46] get you to alter your decisions away
[1:00:48] from the truth.
[1:00:51] He's okay with our flesh controlling our
[1:00:54] lives. Just going to do what we want to
[1:00:55] do. He's okay with our flesh trying to
[1:00:58] control the
[1:00:59] church because he
[1:01:02] knows God can't be pleased with them
[1:01:05] that are in the flesh. The flesh is
[1:01:07] emnity with God. God can't even control
[1:01:09] the flesh. Do you know that?
[1:01:13] If you do not willingly die out to your
[1:01:15] will. Yeah.
[1:01:18] You're a target for the devil to use.
[1:01:20] Amen. True.
[1:01:23] God is not God's job to crucify your
[1:01:25] flesh. Amen. It is our personal job to
[1:01:29] let God use our lives.
[1:01:32] And if we
[1:01:33] don't, Satan will use us. Satan is a
[1:01:39] manipulator. Now, this is what it says
[1:01:42] about a manipulative behavior. So, we're
[1:01:43] speaking with Jesus now. We're speaking
[1:01:46] of the we're speaking of of what the
[1:01:49] truth is about a manipulative behavior.
[1:01:52] And we can go back to our our opening
[1:01:55] our opening with this, but we're going
[1:01:58] to try to enter in now to what how the
[1:02:01] enemy can use us and use other people
[1:02:04] against us. to manipulate us. So what is
[1:02:08] a manipulative
[1:02:09] behavior? You Google it. Manipulative
[1:02:12] behavior involves using deceptive or
[1:02:15] unethical tactics to control or
[1:02:18] influence others thoughts, feelings, and
[1:02:20] actions for personal gain.
[1:02:24] So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going
[1:02:26] to do some little things. Not for the
[1:02:28] word of God, not for the
[1:02:31] kingdom, not to help somebody to Christ,
[1:02:35] but so I can get some favor with you to
[1:02:37] get personal control,
[1:02:39] a personal game.
[1:02:42] That's
[1:02:44] manipulation. It often includes tactics
[1:02:46] like gaslightening,
[1:02:50] gaslighting, guilt tripping,
[1:02:53] blaming, and pretending to be innocent.
[1:02:57] Manipulators might use these techniques
[1:03:00] to avoid responsibility or to conceal
[1:03:02] their true intentions or cause doubt or
[1:03:04] confusion in their victims.
[1:03:06] So, we just want to talk about a few of
[1:03:08] these things. Is that okay as I go
[1:03:09] through these? Gas lightning. Gas light.
[1:03:15] Gaslighting is a form of psychological
[1:03:18] manipulation
[1:03:23] where someone tries to make another
[1:03:25] person doubt their own sanity, their own
[1:03:28] memory or their own reality.
[1:03:31] This is done by repeatedly denying,
[1:03:34] distorting or misrepresenting facts to
[1:03:36] create confusion and a sense of
[1:03:39] dependency on the manipulator.
[1:03:46] The manipulator is the one that wants
[1:03:48] you to depend on them so he can gain
[1:03:51] control.
[1:03:53] And so the way to do this is to make you
[1:03:55] feel bad, guilty, wrong, confused.
[1:04:01] So they don't know what to do. Oh, I'm
[1:04:02] looking to you.
[1:04:07] The goal is often to gain power and
[1:04:10] control over the victim.
[1:04:14] Undermining reality, gaslighters might
[1:04:17] deny the events that actually happen.
[1:04:20] Claim that the victim is imagining all
[1:04:22] these things and twist their words to
[1:04:24] make them seem like they're all the
[1:04:28] problem. Shift blaming.
[1:04:31] Gasers may blame the victim for their
[1:04:33] own actions or feelings. Well, the ways
[1:04:35] that you're feeling this way is you're
[1:04:37] the fault. And try to make them feel
[1:04:39] responsible for this treatment that the
[1:04:41] the manipulator is actually doing to
[1:04:43] them.
[1:04:53] Do you ever have like feelings and all
[1:04:55] of a sudden you can't have feelings with
[1:04:57] someone?
[1:05:00] Gasers might dismay the victim's
[1:05:02] emotions as
[1:05:04] unimportant,
[1:05:06] irrational, making them feel
[1:05:08] invalidated. It doesn't matter what you
[1:05:13] feel. Creating confusion by constantly
[1:05:16] questioning their perceptions of
[1:05:17] reality. The victim becomes confused,
[1:05:20] uncertain, and weakens their confidence
[1:05:22] and their judgment. What is the devil
[1:05:24] trying to do? He's trying to conquer
[1:05:28] us from being victorious in Christ. Now,
[1:05:32] what happens is when Satan's that same
[1:05:34] spirit gets on us, we can start to
[1:05:36] manipulate other people.
[1:05:41] Why? For personal gain. For personal
[1:05:45] gain. Amen.
[1:05:48] Not for God's will, but to gain
[1:05:51] something from that person. Yeah.
[1:05:55] Isolation. Gaslighters may isolate the
[1:05:57] victim from their support network,
[1:06:00] making them more reliant on the
[1:06:02] manipulator again for validation and a
[1:06:05] sense of reality. Right? Amen. Some
[1:06:07] examples they give is like this. Oh,
[1:06:10] you're just being
[1:06:12] oversensitive. or I never said
[1:06:15] that or you're imagining things. You're
[1:06:18] being dramatic. You're being crazy. Yes,
[1:06:22] these are just
[1:06:24] statements that
[1:06:26] happen to
[1:06:29] manipulate someone or some situation.
[1:06:34] Manipulation is a form of abuse.
[1:06:37] It's an abuse of power. Amen. Brother
[1:06:40] Brandon said, "Power without character
[1:06:41] is satanic." Right. Amen. Someone who's
[1:06:45] have been constantly manipulated can
[1:06:46] suffer with low self-esteem,
[1:06:50] selfworth, anxiety, depression,
[1:06:53] difficulty trusting others, emotional
[1:06:54] and psychological trauma, and a feeling
[1:06:56] of helplessness, and what a greater
[1:06:59] dependency on the manipulator. We've all
[1:07:02] heard of of violent abusers. We've we've
[1:07:05] we've heard we've seen where peop uh
[1:07:07] women who've been violent uh violently u
[1:07:11] abused. They try to get away and all of
[1:07:13] a sudden they feel this. Oh, I got to
[1:07:15] get back. He won't do it again. I
[1:07:16] forgive him. I know he's going to change
[1:07:19] and they gets she gets beat up over and
[1:07:21] over and over and
[1:07:23] over becoming a dependency on the a
[1:07:27] manipulator and the abuser.
[1:07:29] It's no different with verbal abuse.
[1:07:31] It's the same. It's no different with
[1:07:33] emotional abuse. It's no different with
[1:07:36] psychological abuse.
[1:07:39] And it's a real thing. We all raised our
[1:07:41] hands. We either know, we either going
[1:07:43] through it, we know somebody's going
[1:07:45] through it, we know the reality of it.
[1:07:47] And it's not but Satan trying to use
[1:07:51] somebody to get their personal gain.
[1:07:53] Yes.
[1:07:55] And we got to call it out.
[1:07:57] Nothing but the devil. This is not God
[1:08:00] trying to get his will done in our home.
[1:08:03] That's right.
[1:08:05] This is just the devil planting his seed
[1:08:07] in here of discord. Yeah, that is amen.
[1:08:10] If you're going to fight, fight for the
[1:08:12] will of God. Fight for the word of God.
[1:08:14] Fight for peace. Fight for love. Fight
[1:08:17] for unity.
[1:08:18] Don't be fighting to manipulate somebody
[1:08:20] to make them feel bad so you can get
[1:08:22] what you want to get on them. That is
[1:08:23] nothing but the devil.
[1:08:29] Balam was so spiritually bind that he
[1:08:31] couldn't discern the will of
[1:08:33] God. Think about it. He was a prophet.
[1:08:36] He was so
[1:08:38] anointed with this. I got to have what I
[1:08:41] want to
[1:08:45] have. He wanted money. But you don't
[1:08:48] have to have money. You can want
[1:08:49] anything. That's true. Balam was selfish
[1:08:52] and he was motivated by greed. Amen. And
[1:08:55] he was anointed with a manipulative
[1:08:57] spirit for a personal gain. And he used
[1:08:59] manipulation against God's
[1:09:01] people. How many times have we heard
[1:09:03] about churches robbing the people of
[1:09:06] their money? Yeah. Not caring about the
[1:09:09] kingdom, not caring about the flock, but
[1:09:12] just caring about getting their money.
[1:09:13] Yeah.
[1:09:15] Instead of what? Trusting God. Amen. Bam
[1:09:20] could have trusted God, but he didn't
[1:09:21] trust
[1:09:22] God. He wanted what he wanted. Cain was
[1:09:25] so spiritually blind that even after God
[1:09:27] talked to him, he walked away sad.
[1:09:30] Cain was selfish, motivated by a
[1:09:32] jealousy and resentment towards his
[1:09:34] brother, he was anointed with a
[1:09:36] manipulative spirit to get personal
[1:09:39] gain. And he manipulated the situation
[1:09:42] to get what he wanted when he could have
[1:09:44] just simply trusted the word of God when
[1:09:46] it was spoken to him.
[1:09:49] We can see how the spirit of
[1:09:50] manipulation can get on a believer and
[1:09:52] actually manipulate
[1:09:55] others. We're not allowed to manipulate
[1:09:58] people for personal gain. Amen.
[1:10:02] And I'm going to tell you, you might be
[1:10:03] in a situation you might be the only
[1:10:05] person that can stand up for yourself.
[1:10:07] Amen.
[1:10:13] We're not allowed to manipulate our
[1:10:15] spouses, our family for personal gain.
[1:10:19] We're not allowed to manipulate our
[1:10:21] brothers and sisters in the church for
[1:10:23] own personal interest.
[1:10:28] We're not allowed to go speaking bad
[1:10:30] things about people just so you can look
[1:10:33] better.
[1:10:37] That is not the will of
[1:10:39] God. That is nothing but pure
[1:10:42] manipulation of the devil hidden behind
[1:10:45] some religious
[1:10:48] person. Manipulation is nothing more
[1:10:50] than satanic.
[1:10:53] Amen. Manipulation is the power without
[1:10:59] character. In other words, I'm going to
[1:11:01] use what I have to get personal. Nothing
[1:11:04] different than what Lucifer did.
[1:11:06] True character of Christ doesn't
[1:11:08] manipulate others for personal gain.
[1:11:12] I'm gonna say it again because I didn't
[1:11:13] hear enough amen. The true character of
[1:11:15] Christ does not manipulate others for
[1:11:17] personal gain. It just doesn't. Amen.
[1:11:21] They don't persecute and downgrade
[1:11:22] others.
[1:11:24] They're not attention grabbers or
[1:11:26] self-reputation builders. Christ made
[1:11:29] himself of no reputation. I don't think
[1:11:31] his children do. No. Christ didn't need
[1:11:34] to sell himself. He was authentic. He
[1:11:38] was real. He was genuine.
[1:11:41] Amen. We need to stop using fear against
[1:11:45] others.
[1:11:46] That's right. Parents need to stop using
[1:11:48] fear against their children. Spouses
[1:11:51] need to stop using fear against one
[1:11:53] another. I am telling you, you'll never
[1:11:55] find God where you find fear. That is
[1:11:58] the truth.
[1:12:01] And here's the thing. You You want
[1:12:04] to You want to put some fear of God into
[1:12:08] your children or to someone? Make sure
[1:12:10] it's the fear of God, not the fear of
[1:12:13] the devil,
[1:12:15] not the fear of the world.
[1:12:19] How can you how can you how can you
[1:12:21] teach
[1:12:23] children
[1:12:26] to to uh the fear to to to to to fear?
[1:12:32] How can you teach them fear or how
[1:12:34] should I say this? How can you teach how
[1:12:35] can you bring them up in the in the way
[1:12:37] they should go when you're constantly
[1:12:38] putting fear upon them?
[1:12:42] The fear is the respect. How to respect
[1:12:45] God's word. How to handle situations.
[1:12:47] how to do things the right way, not
[1:12:50] manipulate
[1:12:52] them. Have enough love for them. That's
[1:12:55] what the deal is. Have enough love for
[1:12:57] them.
[1:13:00] We need to stop trying to influence
[1:13:02] others thoughts, feelings, and emotions
[1:13:04] and actions. For what reason? For
[1:13:06] personal gain. If you don't shut up, I'm
[1:13:08] going to send you through that wall.
[1:13:11] You don't stop doing what you're going
[1:13:12] to do. You know, my dad used to say to
[1:13:14] me, "Hey, you want something to cry
[1:13:16] about? But I'll give you something to
[1:13:17] cry about.
[1:13:20] You know what? I think I'll stop crying
[1:13:21] right now.
[1:13:26] One major reason people live
[1:13:28] manipulative lives,
[1:13:31] everything they got to manipulate
[1:13:33] situations is because they have so much
[1:13:36] fear abiding inside their own vessel.
[1:13:39] It's true.
[1:13:43] They're scared.
[1:13:46] They get scared. They get frightened
[1:13:47] that they won't have control. So, they
[1:13:49] have to actually use some sort of
[1:13:50] manipulation to control
[1:13:53] somebody. They'll use any means that
[1:13:55] they can to control a situation. They
[1:13:57] will try to manipulate other people's
[1:13:59] feelings. They'll perhaps uh use
[1:14:03] progressive I'm sorry, passive or
[1:14:05] aggressive
[1:14:06] behaviors, right? I like you. I don't
[1:14:08] like you.
[1:14:12] Using your emotions to gain control over
[1:14:14] you.
[1:14:15] pulling you from here to there, getting
[1:14:17] you so confused. Just be who you are.
[1:14:21] Just be who you are.
[1:14:23] I tell you, if you're going to be both
[1:14:25] sides, you're nothing but a hypocrite.
[1:14:28] I'd rather have you all one way and hate
[1:14:31] me. Yes.
[1:14:34] At least we know where you're standing.
[1:14:42] They'll try and make you feel bad.
[1:14:46] guilty, wrong, weak, unworthy, inferior.
[1:14:53] For what reason? So they can have
[1:14:55] control over you. Amen. Now you do what
[1:14:58] I want you to do.
[1:15:03] In other words, God is such a gentleman
[1:15:06] that he's not going to cross somebody's
[1:15:08] free will.
[1:15:10] But
[1:15:11] we are taking on this mindset of, you
[1:15:16] know, if I can't get you to do what I
[1:15:17] want you to do by asking, you know what?
[1:15:19] I'm going to put you through a lot of
[1:15:21] abuse.
[1:15:24] And this abuse is going to get what I
[1:15:26] really want out of you.
[1:15:31] It shows we need a good dose of the Holy
[1:15:33] Ghost. Amen.
[1:15:35] just in order to accomplish
[1:15:38] own personal gain.
[1:15:42] See,
[1:15:43] God, he's working out all things the
[1:15:45] counsel of his
[1:15:50] will. That's always the right thing.
[1:15:56] But trying to control
[1:15:58] things so we can get what we
[1:16:01] want through manipulation is nothing but
[1:16:05] the devil using us to get what we want.
[1:16:07] Yeah. It is not the Holy Ghost. It's not
[1:16:10] right. It's not
[1:16:11] God. It's not spiritual.
[1:16:15] Hey, the most worst spirit is a is a
[1:16:17] religious spirit. They'll use the word.
[1:16:21] They'll use the word to get personal
[1:16:22] gain. I mean, didn't didn't not Satan
[1:16:25] bring that to Jesus.
[1:16:27] Bring the word. They just jump off
[1:16:29] there. You know what the the angels are
[1:16:31] going to come and get you? Yeah. Right.
[1:16:34] Quoting the word
[1:16:37] for what? Personal gain. So that Jesus
[1:16:39] would bow before him. All about personal
[1:16:42] gain.
[1:16:45] Anyone that tries to manipulate you or
[1:16:49] the church truly doesn't care about you,
[1:16:53] no matter what they say.
[1:16:57] I don't care how much they say they
[1:16:58] care. If they try to manipulate you,
[1:17:01] they truly don't care.
[1:17:04] The Bible tells us that grievous wolf
[1:17:06] shall come in not sparing the
[1:17:09] flock, manipulating.
[1:17:12] So we know that this is a real spirit.
[1:17:14] Amen. They care about themselves.
[1:17:19] Manipulation
[1:17:21] is it reveals complete selfishness.
[1:17:25] That's what it does. Manipulation
[1:17:27] reveals complete
[1:17:29] selfishness. It's not eternal life. It's
[1:17:31] not living for others. It's all
[1:17:34] self-centered. It's natural. It's
[1:17:36] carnal. It's a get gain for now.
[1:17:42] and people who manipulate are lacking
[1:17:44] love to trust God in their situations.
[1:17:49] So, we want to just kind of turn this
[1:17:50] around a little bit right now. I know
[1:17:52] it's been a little bit strong.
[1:17:56] First time I've ever ministered on
[1:17:59] manipulation that I can recall.
[1:18:04] People who manipulate are lacking love
[1:18:07] to trust God in their
[1:18:10] situations. First John 4:18 says, "There
[1:18:12] is no fear in love, but perfect love
[1:18:14] cast out fear because fear of torment,
[1:18:15] and he that fearth is not made perfect
[1:18:17] in
[1:18:19] love."
[1:18:20] Love is what people need, not fear.
[1:18:26] You're if you love somebody, you'll
[1:18:27] never manipulate them. True. Never ever
[1:18:31] ever manipulate. If you love, I am
[1:18:35] sorry. It don't exist. Don't you tell me
[1:18:38] you love me and manip try to manipulate
[1:18:41] me. I'll call that out as the devil.
[1:18:48] Because if you love me, you'll do it the
[1:18:49] way God does it.
[1:18:54] We all go through various sufferings.
[1:18:57] We all get in situations. Well, I don't
[1:18:59] I I don't know how to do this. I don't
[1:19:00] know how to control this. What am I
[1:19:01] going to do? We all suffer.
[1:19:05] We all have to get to a place where
[1:19:07] we're going to either trust God or we
[1:19:08] don't. Either manipulate the situation
[1:19:10] or we don't. Look at with me to 1 Peter
[1:19:12] chapter 2 21. 1 Peter chapter 2
[1:19:16] 21-23. For even here too were you
[1:19:20] called. So Christ left us example
[1:19:22] because Christ also suffered for us. He
[1:19:25] left us an example of what to do when
[1:19:28] we're
[1:19:29] suffering and that we should follow his
[1:19:31] steps. How many's ever suffered
[1:19:35] before? John, brother John, you know
[1:19:37] that is a ridiculous question, right?
[1:19:40] We've all suffered. Here's what we do
[1:19:42] when we're suffering.
[1:19:47] Jesus who did no sin, neither was guile
[1:19:51] found in his mouth.
[1:19:54] Who when he was reviled, he reviled not
[1:19:57] again.
[1:19:59] When he suffered, he threatened
[1:20:02] not. What did he do? What did he do? He
[1:20:07] committed himself to him that judges
[1:20:11] righteously. Amen. He trusted in a God
[1:20:14] that could take care of the situation.
[1:20:18] Lord,
[1:20:20] so when we're being abused and
[1:20:22] criticized, disrespected, insulted,
[1:20:24] angrily treated, simply revile that
[1:20:29] back. When we're suffering because
[1:20:31] someone's abusive behavior towards us,
[1:20:34] don't engage or threaten them. We know a
[1:20:38] soft answer turns away a wrath. Well,
[1:20:40] brother John, what will I do with this
[1:20:44] person who's doing this thing to me?
[1:20:49] Commit yourself
[1:20:51] to him. Right. That's right. That
[1:20:53] judgeth righteously.
[1:20:56] He's a righteous judge. He'll take care
[1:20:57] of it. Amen. But as soon as you start
[1:21:00] taking control Amen, without the word of
[1:21:03] God,
[1:21:06] I mean, you might have to stand out and
[1:21:08] say, "You're wrong. you're abusing me.
[1:21:10] I'm not going to accept it.
[1:21:12] You might have to do
[1:21:14] that, but don't engage. Don't fight.
[1:21:17] Don't argue. Just call it out. Be done
[1:21:20] with it.
[1:21:22] We have to learn to start committing our
[1:21:24] life to the word of God. Amen. Don't
[1:21:26] wait for your children, your parents,
[1:21:28] your spouses, your brothers and sisters
[1:21:30] to all of a sudden be doing the right
[1:21:32] thing before you're going to start.
[1:21:34] That's right.
[1:21:35] You may be the only one that's standing
[1:21:37] for the word of God in this church.
[1:21:39] Stand. Stand. Stand for the word.
[1:21:43] Everybody else might only halfway be
[1:21:45] standing. You make sure you're the one
[1:21:46] that's going to stand. And then you
[1:21:49] stand for the word. God will stand for
[1:21:52] you. Amen. That's right. Psalms 37:1.
[1:21:56] Fret not. Fret not. Don't get upset.
[1:22:00] Don't get bothered. Don't burn. Don't
[1:22:02] get zeal against somebody. Fret not
[1:22:05] against uh fret thyself because of
[1:22:08] evildoers, neither be thou envious
[1:22:10] against the workers of iniquity, for
[1:22:13] they shall soon be cut off like the
[1:22:14] grass, whether uh and wither as a green
[1:22:17] herb. Trust in the Lord,
[1:22:20] and do good. So thou shalt uh so shalt
[1:22:24] thou dwell in the land, and verily thou
[1:22:26] shalt be fed. Delight thyself also in
[1:22:29] the Lord, and he shall give you the
[1:22:30] desire of your heart.
[1:22:33] commit thy way to the Lord. Trust also
[1:22:35] in him and he shall bring it to pass.
[1:22:39] Jesus committed himself to the father.
[1:22:42] Peter's telling us to do the same thing.
[1:22:44] He left us that example to commit oursel
[1:22:47] to him that judgeth righteously. And and
[1:22:49] and Psalms 37, commit thy way unto the
[1:22:52] Lord. So just spell it out. I'm being
[1:22:55] abused. This is what's happening to me.
[1:22:57] I'm I'm I'm my there there's not caring
[1:23:00] about anything I'm saying.
[1:23:03] Commit thy ways unto the Lord.
[1:23:07] Don't try to do it all yourself.
[1:23:11] The truth is what sets you free,
[1:23:12] friends. The truth is what sets you
[1:23:15] free. If you go and you engage, that's
[1:23:18] exactly what the devil wants you to do.
[1:23:20] That's right. Fight, fight, fight,
[1:23:23] fight, fight. Where does that get?
[1:23:26] Psalms 31 verse1. In thee, oh Lord, do I
[1:23:29] put my trust. Right. Amen. Let me be ne
[1:23:32] Let me never be ashamed. Deliver me in
[1:23:34] thy righteousness. Amen.
[1:23:37] Bow down thine ear to me. Deliver me
[1:23:40] speedily. Be thou my strong rock for a
[1:23:44] house of defense to save
[1:23:46] me. For thou art my rock and my
[1:23:49] fortress. Therefore, thy name's sake.
[1:23:51] Lead me and guide me in this situation.
[1:23:54] Lord, pull me out of the net that they
[1:23:57] have laid privately for me. For thou art
[1:24:00] my strength. Into thy hand I commit my
[1:24:05] spirit. Thou has redeemed me, oh Lord,
[1:24:09] God of truth. You know, see the thing is
[1:24:12] in the
[1:24:13] world, you know, we live in just such a
[1:24:18] confusing world. It is. I mean
[1:24:22] everything is confusing. Genders are
[1:24:25] confusing. Everything is is so
[1:24:28] confusing. Homes are confusing.
[1:24:30] Relationships are confusing. Marriages
[1:24:32] are confusing. I don't know what to do.
[1:24:34] The word of God is a light for us to
[1:24:36] walk in. It gets us out of darkness. It
[1:24:38] gets things straightened up.
[1:24:42] Yes, it does.
[1:24:44] Do it the word way.
[1:24:46] Amen. The word way. Not the John way.
[1:24:52] Not the Martin way. That's right. Do it
[1:24:55] the word way. The word is the way.
[1:24:59] The only way. Proverbs 16:2, "All the
[1:25:03] ways of a man are clean in his own
[1:25:06] eyes."
[1:25:09] How how many times have we felt
[1:25:11] self-righteous there? Amen. But the Lord
[1:25:14] weigh the spirits.
[1:25:17] So commit thy works unto the Lord. Amen.
[1:25:20] What happens? Our thoughts shall be
[1:25:23] established. That's right.
[1:25:25] The Lord hath made all things for
[1:25:27] himself.
[1:25:29] Yay, even the wicked for the day of
[1:25:30] evil.
[1:25:32] All right. 1 Peter chapter 4:1 16. We're
[1:25:35] doing really
[1:25:36] good. I don't see us going an extra 25
[1:25:41] minutes today.
[1:25:45] So, we need to learn to trust the Lord
[1:25:48] more. Right. Yes.
[1:25:51] So we we don't get caught up in the
[1:25:53] feeling that we need to manipulate other
[1:25:55] people.
[1:25:57] You ever been in a situation you wish it
[1:25:59] was different?
[1:26:04] When a person actually exercises a trust
[1:26:06] in the Holy Spirit, that shows
[1:26:09] character. But you got to do it from the
[1:26:11] heart. You can't be, you
[1:26:15] know, out here
[1:26:19] It's got to be, it's got to be
[1:26:21] genuine, a genuine trust. 1 Peter
[1:26:24] chapter 4:16. Yet if a man suffer as a
[1:26:28] Christian, 1 Peter chapter 4:16, if a if
[1:26:31] a man suffer as a Christian, how many's
[1:26:33] ever suffered as a Christian?
[1:26:36] And we all should have said amen that.
[1:26:38] Amen. Amen. I'll make you stay later
[1:26:41] today if you don't get involved.
[1:26:45] Yet if any man suffers a Christian, let
[1:26:47] him not be
[1:26:49] ashamed. But let him glorify God on this
[1:26:52] behalf.
[1:26:54] For the time has come that judgment must
[1:26:56] begin at the house of God. And if it
[1:26:57] first begin at us, what shall the end be
[1:27:00] of them that obey not the gospel of God?
[1:27:02] Right? And if the righteous scarcely be
[1:27:05] saved, where shall the ungodly and the
[1:27:06] sinner appear? Amen. Wherefore let him
[1:27:09] that suffer according to the will of God
[1:27:12] commit the keeping of their souls to him
[1:27:16] in welloing as unto a faithful creator.
[1:27:20] Amen. Every day I believe we need to
[1:27:22] commit amen ourselves to God, our homes
[1:27:25] to God, our marriages to God, our kids
[1:27:27] to God, our life to God, our thoughts to
[1:27:30] God. commit to God because if you don't
[1:27:33] learn to start get reliant on Holy
[1:27:35] Ghost, what you're going to end up doing
[1:27:37] is starting to take control yourself.
[1:27:40] As soon as you start taking control of
[1:27:42] the situation yourself, you're going to
[1:27:43] leave out God and you're going to say,
[1:27:44] "This is what I want. This is how it's
[1:27:46] going to be done. And if this don't
[1:27:47] happen, I'm going to really give it to
[1:27:49] you." Yeah.
[1:27:52] And all of a sudden, there's a fear of
[1:27:54] manipulation. Like, I'm scared to
[1:27:57] talk. I'm scared to
[1:27:59] discuss. I'm scared. You know, I've
[1:28:02] actually had people try to manipulate
[1:28:11] me. You know, Brother Brandham said it
[1:28:13] like
[1:28:14] this. I'd
[1:28:17] rather preach to empty pews,
[1:28:20] eat soda cracker, and blanch water than
[1:28:24] to
[1:28:25] compromise for
[1:28:28] anybody. Look, compromising ain't going
[1:28:30] to get anybody saved.
[1:28:33] It can give them a false hope, a false
[1:28:35] sense of security.
[1:28:37] What we need to do is we need to be real
[1:28:40] with God. We need to be real people, not
[1:28:41] manipulators.
[1:28:43] Real,
[1:28:46] genuine. Proverbs
[1:28:48] 3:4. I believe this is maybe sister
[1:28:51] Kathleen's or brother
[1:28:53] Marty's one of their favorite scriptures
[1:28:55] here. is for many of
[1:28:57] us. So shalt thou find favor and good
[1:29:00] understanding the sight of men and God.
[1:29:02] Trust in the Lord with all thine heart
[1:29:05] and lean not to thine own
[1:29:08] understanding. In all thy ways
[1:29:10] acknowledge him and he shall direct thy
[1:29:12] paths. Be not wise in thine own eyes,
[1:29:14] but fear the Lord and depart from evil.
[1:29:18] God is not a manipulator. His will is
[1:29:23] all that matters. And he works out
[1:29:25] everything after the council of his
[1:29:26] will. But as soon as we start doing our
[1:29:30] will, we're manipulating.
[1:29:35] I've seen this. I've seen this in
[1:29:36] ministers and there's just trying to
[1:29:39] conquer trying to control something in
[1:29:41] the church. Yeah. It's wrong.
[1:29:47] God's interest is get his whole family
[1:29:49] together. Yes. That's his purpose. I got
[1:29:52] to get all my all that that are in
[1:29:53] heaven that are under the earth and on
[1:29:55] earth. I got to get them all together.
[1:29:57] Everything that's in Christ, we got to
[1:29:58] be a family. That is what I'm working
[1:30:00] everything. That's my main purpose. Yes.
[1:30:04] But you
[1:30:05] know, people that don't have that their
[1:30:07] main purpose still want to work out
[1:30:11] everything for their own purpose. That's
[1:30:15] true. and they have to manipulate to get
[1:30:19] what they
[1:30:22] want. Now, the devil's trying to destroy
[1:30:24] God's
[1:30:26] family. He's working his deceptive or
[1:30:29] unethical tactics to control or
[1:30:31] influence the thoughts and feelings and
[1:30:33] actions for his own personal gain. Satan
[1:30:38] is a master manipulator.
[1:30:41] He is the author of confusion. And
[1:30:43] everyone who gets sucked into his fears
[1:30:46] will end up using the same tactics on
[1:30:48] others.
[1:30:50] See, you know, Satan is scared.
[1:30:54] He is scared.
[1:31:00] He's scared. You know, I think it was
[1:31:03] Brother Brandon who said, "Satan
[1:31:06] trembles when the weakest Christian is
[1:31:07] on his knees." Amen. He trembles. The
[1:31:11] devil believes and he trembles.
[1:31:16] And so what he tries to do, he he he
[1:31:18] tries to keep us away from the truth,
[1:31:20] the word. The only thing that can help
[1:31:23] save us. That's right. And if there's
[1:31:26] anything that we need to be promoting in
[1:31:27] our homes is the word of God. Amen. We
[1:31:30] need to be lifting that standard up.
[1:31:32] This is what's important. This is what
[1:31:34] this is what is needed. Amen. Not
[1:31:37] trying, well, I don't need the word. I'm
[1:31:39] just going to control. I'm going to do
[1:31:40] what I want. I'm going to control. I'm
[1:31:41] going to make things happen. You're
[1:31:43] going to make things happen without the
[1:31:45] word of God is nothing but Satan.
[1:31:49] That's not very popular. And I may not
[1:31:51] get any, you know, thumbs up on that
[1:31:54] one. Amen. But
[1:31:57] look, we we're we're God's creatures. We
[1:32:00] should be operating by the love of God.
[1:32:02] Yes.
[1:32:03] by a
[1:32:04] trust that if I commit my ways, I commit
[1:32:07] my home, I commit my marriage, I commit
[1:32:09] my children, I commit unto the Lord, God
[1:32:12] is going to take care of everything.
[1:32:20] There's going to be times that the
[1:32:22] person that you're dealing with is not
[1:32:24] reacting the way you want them to about
[1:32:26] something that needs to be done. Like,
[1:32:28] we need to pray. They don't want to
[1:32:29] pray. That's okay. Don't manipulate.
[1:32:34] Just go pray. I'll tell you today. Did
[1:32:36] not God answer prayer today? Yes. I'll
[1:32:38] tell you another brother came in and we
[1:32:40] heard uh we had another brother. Brother
[1:32:42] Ron was telling us about another brother
[1:32:44] who came to church. He didn't think we'd
[1:32:46] ever see him again. God answered prayer.
[1:32:48] He does. He does. I mean, God is real,
[1:32:52] but he doesn't need us to control. He
[1:32:54] just needs us to look to him. Amen.
[1:32:56] There's a big difference. God is in
[1:32:59] control.
[1:33:01] All right. 1 Peter chapter 5. We're
[1:33:03] going to end with
[1:33:05] this. 1 Peter chapter 5:8. I know I
[1:33:08] didn't have this on your your thing, but
[1:33:10] if you want to read it, put it up there.
[1:33:12] Be
[1:33:13] sober. Be
[1:33:15] vigilant because your adversary the
[1:33:18] devil, as a roaring lion, he walketh
[1:33:21] about seeking whom he may devour.
[1:33:25] whom resist steadfast in the faith,
[1:33:29] knowing that the same afflections are
[1:33:32] accomplished in your brethren that are
[1:33:34] in the world. Amen.
[1:33:37] What we need is simply to learn to trust
[1:33:40] God for our lives.
[1:33:43] Follow follow the
[1:33:46] blueprint. Don't force, don't push
[1:33:50] others. Don't try to put fear upon them
[1:33:54] to do something.
[1:33:56] If you're trying to put fear upon
[1:33:58] somebody, just realize that you're
[1:34:02] anointed by the devil.
[1:34:04] Just call it
[1:34:10] out. Let's stand together. God bless
[1:34:12] you. Speak the truth in love.
[1:34:15] Walk away committing things into God's
[1:34:17] hands.
[1:34:20] These same things are happening all over
[1:34:22] the world. And when we learn to to be
[1:34:26] victorious over this
[1:34:27] spirit, you'll be able to keep your
[1:34:30] house clean, keep your family clean,
[1:34:34] keep the church
[1:34:36] clean because Satan has no place in our
[1:34:40] lives. Manipulation has no place in our
[1:34:44] lives.
[1:34:46] God has called us unto peace.
[1:34:50] Amen. God has called us onto peace.
[1:34:55] Amen. How many How many want to step
[1:34:59] away from any kind of manipulation?
[1:35:01] Amen. How many How many don't want to
[1:35:06] manipulate anymore?
[1:35:09] We We never want to be manipulated.
[1:35:12] But but if we can just take a
[1:35:14] stand, then I'm going to just trust God
[1:35:17] a little bit more.
[1:35:19] I believe that God can lift us up above
[1:35:24] the powers of Satan. And that he that
[1:35:27] the son is set free can truly be free
[1:35:30] indeed. Amen. Amen. Let's just bow our
[1:35:32] heart in a word of prayer. our heavenly
[1:35:36] father. Lord, this is a very strong
[1:35:41] uh
[1:35:46] subject, one that we perhaps are
[1:35:50] acquainted with on a daily
[1:35:54] basis, hearing about things, knowing
[1:35:56] things, seeing things, experiencing
[1:35:58] things.
[1:36:01] God, I thank you that you've provided
[1:36:03] for us your word
[1:36:06] tonight. Not only to expose the
[1:36:09] devil, but to expose the devil in our
[1:36:13] own lives.
[1:36:18] Lord, you see our
[1:36:20] hearts, hearts behind our
[1:36:23] hands, Lord, that
[1:36:25] we we don't ever want to be used by the
[1:36:28] enemy to try to control a situation
[1:36:31] outside of your will.
[1:36:35] And I pray that you would fill us so
[1:36:36] full of a desire for more of your love
[1:36:40] and more of your Holy Spirit that we
[1:36:43] could literally trust you in front of
[1:36:45] others that they could see that we're
[1:36:48] trusting you above the fear that they're
[1:36:51] facing. No matter what we suffer as as a
[1:36:56] as your children, Lord, we know the end
[1:37:00] result is that we're going to be with
[1:37:02] you on the other side.
[1:37:05] That you have an expected end for us.
[1:37:08] And though we may not see why we're
[1:37:11] going through what we're going through
[1:37:12] or why things are happening or why
[1:37:14] people are acting the way they're
[1:37:15] acting, help us to trust you in those
[1:37:18] situations, Lord.
[1:37:20] I know as your prophet said, it's not
[1:37:23] the action, but it's the reaction.
[1:37:27] And just because someone else isn't
[1:37:29] trusting you, that doesn't mean we can't
[1:37:30] trust you, Lord.
[1:37:33] Bless your people. Strengthen them,
[1:37:35] fortify them. Amen. May they be ever
[1:37:38] sober, vigilant, and
[1:37:40] press the battle, knowing, Lord, that
[1:37:45] you're going to be there when they
[1:37:47] commit themselves unto you that judgeth
[1:37:50] all things righteously.
[1:37:53] We thank you now for these things, and
[1:37:54] we give you all the praise and honor.
[1:37:56] For we pray in Jesus Christ's precious
[1:37:58] name. Amen.
