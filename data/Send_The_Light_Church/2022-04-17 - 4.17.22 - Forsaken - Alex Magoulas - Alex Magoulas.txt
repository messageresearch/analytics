that you are alive forevermore and lord while the world many people in the world today they gather together for a traditional celebration i'm thankful to know that that there's a god that's come off the very pages of history lord you're not just and you're you're greater than just this book but you're the very author of it and you live inside of a people today testifying that you're the same

trespass of iniquity we pray you just forgive us each one lord we're just we're we're just full of mistakes the prophet said just full of mistakes but we're so grateful today that you proved on that resurrection day you're greater than all of our mistakes all of our weakness and all of our failure lord we're going to overcome today not by our might or by power but by your spirit the same spirit that raised jesus from the dead is with us today have your way and give utterance we pray and we thank you for all these things we magnify you now in jesus christ's name amen god bless you we uh like i said we're just real happy to be with you i i have a bucket list here i need to get through real quick i told the people i'd write stuff down so don't forget but i do want to greet all of you in the name of the lord jesus christ also greet you on behalf of my pastor ray erickson in the church at true word tabernacle i i communicate with brother john this morning he's down there in georgia so he wanted me to greet y'all as well so and i greeted him and now i'm greeting him as he wanted me to greet you on the camera so man i'm getting confused [Laughter] so we want to greet you and also brother jeff snodgrass i was just speaking to him a little bit this morning he wants to greet you all as well and we just are grateful that uh you know what god is doing here with you a lot of a lot of people here today we're so happy to see you all amen if you have your bibles i'll try not to be too poetic here i could just talk all day but that's not why we came here we're going to look into the book of hebrews the 13th chapter this morning and then we'll also look into the book of matthew the 27th chapter i am reminded of the apostle paul's words of the corinthians he told him to purge out uh the old leaven that you may be a new lump and of course he's he's speaking and type about the passover he says even christ our passover is sanctified for us and we know that easter and this time of the year it ties into the the passover celebration and uh let's just read here in hebrews 13. we'll read verses 10 to 14 then i'll have you turn to matthew 27 verse 10 says this he says we excuse me here he says we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the tabernacle for the bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp wherefore jesus also that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate let us amen let us go forth therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach for here we have no continuing city but we seek one to come matthew 27 as you're turning there speaking about the the passover and things and my wife she's at home to at the home church today doing a sunday school lesson she's wanting to speak on the token and i'm like well did you do that on purpose or watch like well i just kind of felt to do that i said well it ties right into the passover and these things and we're so thankful for that um and uh maybe look at a little bit of that here just a little bit i i did think it was uh it's it was noteworthy because we were reading through exodus chapter 12 where it talks about it and uh you know they were to eat the the lamb in haste amen and i made the point see he moses is not telling them to get ready for an exodus he's saying be ready for an exodus don't just have your shoes nearby where you can get ready in five minutes be ready to leave at a moment's notice and the bible that morning come because the scripture moses told them don't don't leave your house until morning and the bible says when the morning come that they they left the self same day amen so they left the self same day and and so it is with the token message you know i'll just say this a lot of preachers you know they uh they'll take things that brother bram said they'll take the message and and try to make different things out of it but uh i believe that the evening time we've had a rising of the sun i believe we've had a shalom it's a good morning to us and people try to make that and say well you know the church ages seats and this and that but we find that the bible tells us in the book of genesis that evening and day were the first day evening and day were the second day the day didn't end at the morning but it was the fulfillment because the light came i hope you see what i'm saying so in other words our light has come but it's the self same day the same message the same power the same resurrection amen matthew 27 i'm going to get ahead of myself here too much if i keep doing all this let's just read here matthew 27 we'll read verses 41 to 53 i think it just take a few moments to read the scripture i don't think we have an issue with reading too much scripture hopefully so but uh the bible here is talking about when jesus was crucified and they hung them between these transgressors the bible says this in verse 41 likewise also the chief priests mocking him with the scribes and elders said he saved others himself he cannot save now brother brahm talks about this it's interesting because they didn't realize that they paid him the greatest compliment they could have ever paid him they confess he saved others they actually confess he saved others but he cannot save himself and they actually complement him it said if he be the king of israel let him now come down from the cross and we will believe him he trusted in god let him deliver him now if he will have him for he said i am the son of god the thieves also which were crucified with him cast the same in his teeth now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land unto the ninth hour now keep in mind this is 12 hour increments in the day so we're looking actually it's what would now be like a six hour passage of time for us amen about the ninth hour jesus cried with a loud voice saying eli eli lama sabachthani that is to say my god my god why hast thou forsaken me some of them that stood there when they heard that said this man calls for elias or elijah and straightway one of them ran and took a sponge and filled it with vinegar and put it on a reed and gave him to drink the rest said let me let us see whether elias will come to save him jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up the ghost and behold the veil of the temple was rent in twain from the top to the bottom and the earth did quake and the rocks rent and the graves were opened hallelujah and many bodies of the saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection notice this and went into the holy city and appeared unto many may the lord bless the reading his word you may be seated a rather lengthy text to get to a very short title we look back here in the 46th verse and the lord jesus he's saying my god my god why hast thou forsaken me and my title for this morning is forsaken forsaken for something to be forsaken i looked up i don't know which dictionary i use i usually use the 1828 noah's webster's which i noticed brother john has in his office but i didn't look this morning thank you brother but to be forsaken is to give up something that was formally valued enjoyed or held dear and uh i take this first text this morning in the book of hebrews brother branham uses the same text when he preaches the sermon going beyond the camp and he presents the thought that we must leave a certain kind of a camp with the intention of entering into another amen there's an there's an intention or there's a deliberate action behind it because there's many kinds of camps today amen many voices and ideas and identifications in the world today brother bram says god has a camp for his people he says the denomination has their own camp and there's many other camps of course which he alludes to uh one one of my favorite ones he talks about people left the camp of common sense amen that's a good one amen and i think i think it's becoming more and more pronounced all the time if it wasn't evident in 1964 uh that people were leaving the camp of common sense perhaps 2022 has convinced you that maybe you finally convinced people have left the camp of common sense i mean when you have a and i don't mean to get political at this point but when you have a supreme court justice they can't tell you what the definition of a woman is implying you have to become a biologist which would make it scientific uh i think it's time to concede that people have left the camp of common sense hey man it should honestly should be called uncommon sense or super sense or rare sense or whatever because it's anything but common the the to reflect the scarcity of it amen i remember something smith wigglesworth said this is a hundred years ago now but wigglesworth made the point people need a revelation of common sense and it is it's almost it's like uh it's like a superpower it's really it's a misnomer it shouldn't be called common sense it should be something else amen but whatever you want to call it they've left it off amen they've left the right for the wrong they have forsaken reason for madness amen brother bram says they left the camp of of decency and reason amen now we look at the idea of reasoning many times we we tend to frown upon the idea of reasoning in the message because we know brother bram talks about people reasoning with the word but there's a right kind of a reasoning amen there's a right kind of a reasoning because the because god through the prophet isaiah he invites the people to come and reason with him amen so when we talk about the wrong kind of a reasoning what we're really talking about is the idea of of trying to rationalize our desire or our lust to do something wrong we'll take something and we're not really concerned about whether it's right or wrong we just want it to be right so people will rationalize it amen and listen you can do that with anything so let's not just leave that like it's some sort of a you know whatever where like you know that people can only do that with the word you can do that with anything but when you do it with the word and you compromise the word that's what brings death amen that's what happened in the garden well you'll not surely die yeah god said this but he didn't really mean it the way he said god says what he means and god means what he says he meant what he said when he said it and he proved it when they fell in the garden amen they were going to die amen and they did die so but but uh what i want you to understand is god is not also advocating that we forsake this sense of reason and and and and and be you know some sort of like i don't know crazy person or whatever i guess amen amen he's making listen to serve god is reasonable if you see the plan of god if you have revelation the plan of god is reasonable and that's what he's telling through the prophet isaiah listen it's reasonable to serve god if you obey me and you do these things you'll be blessed and if you rebel you'll be devoured so it's it's reasonable to serve god amen not trying to rationalize your own lust or your own disobedience but to have an understanding of god's will in your life amen we should have that kind of sense we should have an understanding we should be wise knowing what the will of the lord is the bible says amen so that kind of reason or common sense the reasonable kind of common sense amen the reasonable kind of reason i should put that on a piece of paper and and do something with it i guess amen but it comes with an understanding it will lead you to life and to wisdom amen you know when i we pray and we do devotions with the kids in the evening i pray different things with him and among the different things we pray about we talk about one of the things i i pray for my children is that god would help them to always discern between right and wrong and not only just between right and wrong but right and almost right because almost right is still wrong but it looks almost right listen this this is the most deceiving age there's ever been it's not just what's wrong it's what looks right but it's still wrong because listen there's all kinds of things that look good there's you know that old saying the road to hell is paid with good intentions that's true amen it's true there's there's all kinds of well-meaning deliberate ideas and it's just a snare of the devil and of the world that's what makes them so attractive they don't look wrong but they are and that's what makes it such a snare amen you you look at this scripture and you look at this time of of celebration we're talking about with easter and stuff when jesus came into that holy city at the beginning of the week the people gathered around they took palm leaves they laid him down at his feet they cried hosanna hosanna blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord and it wasn't just a few days later the very same people were there crying out crucify him amen now why was it because they were inspired by their leaders amen oh let's take this man he's a rebel he's this he's that crucified they're inspired and these common people they they they have no discernment to realize they're in sin doing this and the very one that they had propped up and they lauded over how great he was and bless he blessed is he that comes in the name of the lord just a few days later they chose they chose to release a murderer over the prince of life thinking it was a good idea then people didn't sit there saying oh we're a bunch of terrible heathen devil pagans and this is god's chosen people they didn't think they were wrong but they were wrong but yet it was the plan of god got ordained amen amen so they didn't just condemn the lord i want you to remember really remember this they didn't just condemn the lord they they they chose to free a murderer to do it amen they went out of their way to release this man to do it amen and you know people they sneer and say well well how could somebody do such a thing but the scribes of the pharisees said the same thing to jesus oh well listen if we lived in the days of our fathers they said we would have been partakers of their blood with the prophets and jesus said you're your own witness against yourself that you you fill up the measure of your fathers oh if i didn't live back there i didn't ever i didn't ever persecute the prophets you're doing the same thing today to jesus and so it is today still amen people they go to an easter service at a church somewhere they say listen if i had been in that crowd i just stood up i would have never condemned jesus i'd have never come against them and yet they'll stand right in a church and they'll crucify the word of fresh today they've crucified it with their own ideas their own dogmas their own interpretations they've crucified the word hebrews chapter 6. they crucify him today all the while saying oh we would have never done these things it's no different than the scribes and the pharisees amen and they fill up the measure of their fathers amen they've got a camp brother ram talks about the camp of tradition amen easter is just an annual observation they get together and they commemorate this traditional idea that the resurrection was a historical event brothers and sisters the resurrection is more than a historical event for you and i today if we receive the same spirit that was in christ that raised him from the dead if we've got the same thing we have entered into our easter easter's every day for us the resurrection is in you and i he's in you and i testifying he is a lie today go and tell the world go and tell everybody he's alive and well he's been resurrected how do you know because he lives in his people you think about this jesus told his own disciples listen it's expedient for me or actually i don't know he said it's exceeded for you if i go amen it's expedient oh if jesus were here today and if he were here and he could do these things oh what a great thing it would be if jesus was with us today jesus is with us today he said it's expedient in other words you're better off if i go what do you mean he says if i go i'll send you a comforter he will even guide you into all truth amen what you've seen me do you're going to go do it the works that i do you shall do and greater than these because i go to the father see how people they cling to this this historical idea oh if the lord jesus says man we're here listen if the lord jesus as a man were here today with nail scarred hands and wearing a robe he could no more heal you today than i could because he already did it 2 000 years ago when they bury the price on his own back you don't lack for anything today if his spirit is with you it's actually better now you can do the same things you can have the same life amen praise the lord we look at it and brother bram talks about in the rising of the sun what a resurrection that was and we thank god for it because if there wasn't we'd have no reason to be here today amen if christ has not risen of all men we are the most miserable i mean what a resurrection that was he says but what a resurrection this is to be resurrected out of dark denominationalism and man's ideas to know that he's the same today listen he didn't just it's not like lazarus he didn't just raise up and then die again listen lazarus raised up he come back from the grave four days later but he died again but jesus died he rose again and he's alive forevermore he didn't wander off somewhere and die of old age he's the same today as he was when he come out of that tomb that day [Music] we have found god has a camp for his people amen the shout of the kings in that camp he praise god amen this is a place this camp all things are possible amen in this camp everything is possible with men it's impossible but with god all things are possible amen god's come out of god's not limited to history amen he's found preeminence in the hearts of a believing people that's the true easter seal amen not just a bunch of lilies on the altar but souls on the altar souls that have given themselves holy to jesus christ that's the easter seal today we've gone beyond the camp with christ bearing his reproach we might be found in him amen what you know is when you truly go beyond the camp you must forsake everything that's there and everything that's there will forsake you well i said a lot there real quick but it's the truth amen paul said the world is crucified to me and i'm crucified to the world we've got nothing left to touch base on amen the children of obedience and disobedience they've got nothing in common you say well listen we all go to mcdonald's we all drive cars that's not what he's talking about he's talking about the divine nature your nature is not of this world it's a resurrected nature it's a living nature it's really regenerating nature it's god's nature all things are of him they're by him that he might have the preeminence amen hell praise the lord see you couldn't stay in that first camp if you're a son of god i mean jesus couldn't jesus could not stay there because his purpose his will was to be fulfilled outside the camp of man's ideas outside the camp of religion amen listen uh he he can't stay there why because a servant doesn't abide in the house forever but a son abides forever if you come into this house if you're a son of god not just a servant not just a good reformed church member if you're a son or daughter of god amen a son abides forever therefore if the son has set you free you are free indeed listen you might have served sin for a season but that's not your heritage you're the sons and daughters of god this house abides forever and neither they abide forever with it amen listen beloved you you might not you might not be the most popular people in the world today maybe you are i don't know chances are we're not the most popular people in the world today amen you might not all live lavish lifestyles listen a lot of us have probably had to pass up opportunities in our life as christians we had to pass up opportunities for things that would have benefited us naturally speaking but we would rather stay true to the word of god because we forsook all those things that we might have christ all the things that paul had is his position saul of tarsus a pharisee of the pharisees circumcised on the eighth day the stock of benjamin concerning the law he was blameless he forsook all those things to obtain christ amen it might not have benefited you as a natural person but it meant something to you to apprehend christ amen and listen what is the benefit what is what does it all mean for you you're free today oh hallelujah somebody you might not be the wealthiest or the most popular the most exciting but you're free amen you're the freest people that's on the face of the earth today amen listen they can lock you in a prison throw away the key they can chain you up like paul and silas you're the freest people in the world today you found liberty from your greatest enemy yourself god set you free from you from your past from your sin from your heritage all those things were against you but he set you free today amen if you're in christ you're the freest person there is amen well look at this idea this this morning so we're talking about forsaking things and i'm talking about we you know we've given up things many of us have amen this idea of sacrifice i mean the idea of sacrifice entails that you have to forsake something amen because then make it a sacrifice you have to offer up something of valuable and why would you give up something of value because you believe it's worthwhile to do it hey man this this idea of sacrifice is it's interesting because even in nature it's you don't see you know you know monkeys and dolphins and stuff it's not really imitating nature it's something about man something about man why because man was made in the image of god it's something about the divine nature that's portrayed a man this idea of sacrifice and you know i come in here and i got up this morning you're all really interested in this i'm sure i got up this morning and i've just put my clothes on and i've been doing this intermittent fasting i'm down like 15 pounds i felt real good about myself i went with my wife who still sleeps hey honey look at this i got all this room she didn't care she's like okay that's great i'm back to sleep i come in here and i man i feel like a million bucks i look at brother mark i'm like oh my goodness this guy looks like he's got anorexia i need to lay hands on him i see brother roger i'm like man i thought i was doing real well well praise the lord at least i'm going the right direction or whatever for once we'll see how long it lasts listen i had to give up all them late night snacks that wasn't easy because i'm used to doing that hey man i do my best eating between 11 and 12 o'clock at night get me a peanut butter sandwich get me some popcorn got some leftover steak throw a little bacon in there you know drink some lard eat some mayonnaise whatever well then you wonder why you're gaining 20 pounds a month i'm like i don't know lord what is it being dumb that's why and then i had to make some honestly i feel great you know just stop eating after 6 00 p.m well that's really that really shouldn't be that hard but it kind of was i'm doing a lot better listen look at him either the idea of dieting we you you give up certain foods you give up certain activities because it's beneficial to you in the long run amen that's just a natural cycle it's not like a sacrifice unto god amen but just to give you an idea amen that there's something about men they and women they see something noble they see something worthwhile maybe it's the country they live in or whatever it is they're willing to make a sacrifice that's going to cost them personally for something that is greater in the long run amen it takes a certain level of dedication and discipline because the real value of a sacrifice it's not so much what you're sacrificing it's what it means to you amen when you're whatever you're willing to forsake to obtain a goal or to please god whatever that sacrifice entails amen you look at abraham and his great test when god tells me to take i want you to take your only son isaac i want you to take him up and offer him as a sacrifice unto me listen he didn't ask abraham to go take a lamb or a goat or even one of his household servants i want you to take the most precious thing to you i want to take the dearest thing to you listen isaac is not just one of his many that's his son that's his promise god every promise god gave abraham was tied up in this isaac and he raises isaac and he loves isaac and that's his sword and at the end of it this child he's listen he's grown up enough to help his daddy take the wood up and lay himself down he knew what's going on hey man this is just a little boy but isaac goes up and and abraham says i want to take the isaac that you're attached to that you love that you've invested yourself in offer him as a sacrifice amen of course we know god stopped it but god required from him the most precious thing the very manifestation of god's promise to him god is requiring it back from him that's what makes it so significant amen so it's a real sacrifice to serve god amen listen it has to be or else everybody would do it if it was just a matter of going to church you just put your name on a book and this and that everybody would do that just to be safe amen but when you realize there's a reproach that comes with serving christ amen that's what moses saw in egypt he saw the riches of egypt but he saw the reproach of christ them slaves and a bunch of mud pits splashing around in bondage and he esteemed the reproach of christ greater than the riches of egypt amen so there's like there's a cost associated with it make no mistake you said well listen look what god offers you in return yeah that that's that's what makes it so great amen we esteem it like moses amen that's why we're willing to go beyond the camp with christ is to bear the reproach we're willing to suffer on his behalf because the bible says he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him we believe there's a greater reward in serving god even if it would cost us something in this life to do so listen it might cost you your life you say it's free it's paid for yeah but it might cost you something you might have to forfeit your life or you might lose friend listen brother brandon when he preaches the seals what's he saying he says i'm gonna i'll probably lose ten thousands of my friends hey man i don't have ten thousand friends they got like 300 facebook half of them i don't know who they are amen well praise the lord listen this guy had friends everybody wanted to come preach he said i'm going to lose all that just stay true to this word amen so there's a cost associated with it amen brother bram says this in 1959 dying living dying buried rising coming he says in the scriptures in the old testament this is the sin offering when they got the two goats he said these goats he said jesus represented both of them or they represented him rather he said the one goat was killed and the other was the sins of the nation was placed upon this goat called the scapegoat amen that goat had to go out in the wilderness to die and be out there alone amongst the beasts and so forth jesus had to be that goat he said i want you to notice he was a lamb he was sheep but he was made goat for you and i that we bingo might become sheep we being guilt sinners guilty of death subject to death all sold out under condemnation yet christ become me that i through his grace might become him a son of god seated at the right hand of glory paul makes this point in the book of hebrews where i read you look at all the different offerings that were done without the camp you look at the red heifer they took the red heifer out and they slayed it they burnt the ashes and what they did they made the waters of separation i mean there's a waters this words are waters of separation it distinct it distinguishes us it separates us from the rest of the world it sanctifies us we're marked we've been set apart by the waters of the washing the water of the word amen waters of separation where was it prepared outside the camp where the scapegoat go outside the camp amen christ could never fulfill his purpose in the camp that red heifer could never fulfill its purpose in the camp amen it had to go beyond the camp and bear reproach amen i'm saying all this for a reason i'm taking a few moments just to lay this out but to really forsake something talk about the idea of forsaking now to really forsake something like i talk about with this lamb i talk about isaac you have to to have some manner of attachment to it amen amen you know i i make this point frequently i said you know when i come to the lord i i had nothing so it was really easy to give up everything lord i'll give you everything that's easy to do when you got nothing but when you've got something when you've been blessed like abraham can you still give it all to god or did you just get too blessed for your own good we got so enlarged just like king saul when king saul was small in his own eyes it was an easy thing to serve god but when he had power when he had popularity when he had a success in the military and all these things he couldn't find that same kind of a surrender all of a sudden right right hey man but when you have a real attachment or something's really dear to you and you can still forfeit it to forsake it that's what makes it a sacrifice that's why god throughout the scripture whenever they're making a sacrifice they take their flock or their turtle does whatever god always required their best their worst he said i want to take the uh you know a lamb of the first year without blemish i wish amen don't don't take the one that nobody wants anyway the one that's lame he's only got one listen in the book of malachi that was the very thing god condemned the priesthood over there their offerings were profane they didn't bring their best they brought what nobody else wanted and what does god say he says listen if you took this to the governor if you took this to a king would he accept this offering he'd be insulted and yet you're gonna give it to me and i'm the judge of the whole earth i'm a great king i'm god almighty you give your best to your employer you give your best to your spouse and you're not you can't give the best to god something's wrong with your your testimony god's not requiring the least thing in your flock he's requiring your best men brother bram talks about blind bartimaeus before he was healed of his eyesight his wife had an issue brother ram said he had this little lamb it was like a seeing eye dog this little lamb was his guide he said and one day he he was praying to god said god if you'll heal my wife i'll give you this lamb as a sacrifice i'll give this unto you and god healed his wife so he's on his way to the temple to offer up this lamb and the priest now why not watch this that's what i'm talking about the priest said listen you need that lamb that's your eyes it's like you know that's how you get around that's your guide he said listen i'll give you the money and i'll buy you a lamb and you can offer that as a sacrifice to please god and blind barbarian said no i didn't promise god a lamb i promised him this lamb because it meant something to me that's why i promised this lamb amen that's what made it special amen you you look i was talking to brother john about this just the other day you look at david and in second samuel uh david uh you know he he he sees bathsheba he takes bathsheba to himself and then he he ends up having uriah the hit type murdered so he can marry this woman the prophet nathan comes to david and he gives him this parable he said you know there was a rich man and he had many sheep and he had great flocks and he was a rich man and one day a stranger come to visit him he said no i've got to fix some something to eat and rather than take from all of his sheep which he had there was a poor guy just down the street amen he said this man was poor he just had one little you lamb wander the lamb oh my think about this now he said he had one little lamb he said and it grew up with him it grew up with his children it ate from his bowl it drank from his cup it laid in his bosom it was his a daughter unto him some of you all pet owners know what i'm talking about somebody like i mean that's ridiculous well he was attached to his little lamb amen you say that i don't think that's that big of a deal well david did because when david heard how this rich man took it listen david said that man needs to die not knowing it was actually about himself it's a parable but i want you know david's reaction the man wasn't murdered it wasn't his natural children it was his lamb david as a shepherd he was so incensed to anger about this transgression that man deserves to die for taking that lamb why because it was special to him that lamb might not have been special to you it wasn't really special the rich man he just wanted to give up something of his own amen but it was special to that man and that's what made it such a transgression hey man david wasn't going to kill this rich man because he stole a human child or he's a murderer and that because he's robbed him of his dear lamb my wife and i we uh that's why i brought up brother john my wife and i we had a we had a little white fluffy dog we named her mita after sister meeting stuff and and uh maria actually bought her around the time we got engaged and uh that was that was over 15 years ago and uh just a few days ago after 15 years i we had to i had to go put our dog down and uh i don't care to tell you this really but i guess i'm going to you know i i've lost plenty of family members i've preached their funerals i've buried friends i had a friend when i was younger he was shot and killed he was just a teenager it was uh almost 18 years ago uh april 19th i believe you know i i've been through all those things but honestly that our dog died and that was probably one of the hardest things i've ever had to do i didn't know i'd take it so hard and like i said i don't hardly care to admit to be honest but i'm saying to make a point amen you get attached to something yeah something's dear to you and i wasn't offered as a sacrifice but you think about these that was that was the significance of offering these things brother graham said they take that land that they raise they take their bass they take their first sling or whatever and they'd offer it and watch it bleed and they'd watch it die and feel it and they realize this innocent creature had to pay a price for my sin it made you feel bad you realize listen my sin is a big deal we act like we just go to church oh well i went to church god forgive me i just god forgive me i'm fine somebody paid a price more than just a lamb the son of god the lamb of god paid a price amen that's what makes it you look and say you know what my sin was not a light issue my transgression and my rebellion against god it was not a simple thing it cost something there's a sincerity that comes with that amen that's why i say we forsake things amen uh listen i i really thought about this several years ago my my pastor he'd asked me to preach easter sunday at the home church and i had plenty of time to get ready and i had a few weeks and i'm steady and i'm praying like man i'm gonna preach easter sunday everybody's gonna be there even people that never come i was gonna say happy easter and merry christmas you know i'm getting ready and i'm studying oh man praise god we're going to have a good time we're going to be shouting we're going to be you know all this stuff and i'm sitting there and i'm listening to going beyond the camp like i've been talking about i'm i'm studying the message i'm reading through the bible i'm praying and i'm like i don't know where any of this is going amen i have no idea where i'm going with any of this and listen i was riding to church my i had my wife drive sunday morning easter morning i'm riding to church i have no idea what i'm preaching that day now i don't know if you can relate to that or not but i was a little nervous at that point hey man to be totally honest i was fit to be tied and then i'm like i i have done everything i can i have i have laid before the lord and i've prayed and i've tried and here i am i'm gonna look like a complete idiot i've got 66 books and 1100 messages you couldn't find anything to preach for easter sunday what kind of idiot are you hey man and i'm going there brother bruce you probably related a little bit you're just like pulling your hair out like lord what are you doing to me why why are you doing this to me and listen i i i won't forget it because i was sitting there and i was praying at that moment said lord i i feel i've i've done all these things i've consecrated myself for the people saying i have no idea what you want from me i say i felt like an orphan child and this is what i said i pray i said lord i feel so forsaken and right then god spoke to me said that's exactly what i was waiting on amen god's got a way of saying something to change the whole situation god said that's exactly what i was waiting for that's exactly what i wanted you to feel because that's what i want you to preach about and it begin to dawn and just begin to come together that amen we celebrate this great celebration of easter because god forsook his son jesus christ he offered him up and he made him a sacrifice his soul was an offering for sin amen you and i feel forsaken sometimes by friends by family by the world sometimes we feel forsaken by god but jesus was forsaken if he had not been forsaken there'd be no resurrection listen christ was forsaken by the religious people he came to his own and his own received him not he was forsaken by the religious people he was forsaken by his friends forsaken by the romans forsaken by his own disciples listen that would have been bad enough but they had to hang them between heaven and earth because even the earth in heaven didn't want him and finally the one person the one person you thought would take him in he cries out to his father and his own father turns his face away most of us would have broke under the friends and the disciples and the people amen most of us would just give up but here's christ on a cross and even his father forsakes him amen you imagine being forsaken but god almighty himself amen listen we frequently we meditate on the severity of christ's sacrifice we take the communion we look at his his broken body his shed blood when we do these things in remembrance of him amen we look at the we look at the nails on his hand the nail scars and the stripes on his back we think of the weight of the cross we think of all these things that he endured but i think many times we forget the greatest tragedy was separation amen brother bam says we bypassed the theophany we came here to be tested we don't remember anything before this life we were just in the mind of god we were thoughts of god there was nothing there i mean we've got no memory we've got no recollection listen you and i were born in sin we were shaped in iniquity we we know what that's like we didn't come to this world knowing all things and this you know what i'm saying we we know what it's like we feel that way even now we feel alone we feel abandoned at times amen but listen jesus never bypassed that amen even before the spirit descended on him at the jordan river amen when he was a boy he was teaching the teachers and the temples he said i'm about my father's business he knew who he was he knew where he'd been listen he knew he wasn't just saying because he read it somewhere he said listen i beheld satan fall from heaven like lightning i remember it they said before abraham was i am i was there i remember it that logos that proceeded from the father he'd always been together amen think about this he's never been separate from god we were born that way we're used to it he's never been separate from his father and now all of a sudden he he's he's been in glory he's seen the angels he's done all these things on this cross now even god separates from him yeah and for the first time in all of history jesus is alone amen brother represented that great crucial hour until he suffered knowing all things until the water and blood separated in his body great drops of sweat like blood dropped from his brow brother ram says this he died more death in gethsemane than he did on the cross what do you mean it was there he made a decision not my will listen he didn't he wasn't excited about easter he wasn't excited about good friday oh man i can't wait to get on the cross praise god father if it's possible if there's any way out of this let this cup pass for me nevertheless not my will but thing be done listen he looked at the cross he despised the shame but he endured it because of the joy because the prize was greater than the price the prize was greater than the price to him wants to hang on a cross and suffer and be rejected by everybody hanging on a cross naked to where even god the father forsakes you nobody does that with a you know spring in their step so to speak there is on the cross why why hast thou forsaken me brotherham says this that same sermon living dying he says the love that he had how he expressed it how he had to make his self himself what he was to die to save us his death when he died at calvary there was never a death could be like that death we are told when the roman soldier pierced his side there was water and blood came out of his side i asked a chemist one time ah there's a guy drove me on the way up here his his license plate was like c6 h it was a chemical oh my god must be a chemist i guess i didn't know you could get uh subscriptions on your license plate but i guess you could he had a chemical compound formula or whatever the message yeah that was free i asked the chemist one time was taking place this fellow being a christian he said that was not he said jesus did not jesus did not die because the spirit touched his side or pierced his side said jesus had been dead a long time before that but he died from grief remember no man could take his life he had to lay it down that's why he gave up the ghost you couldn't take it from him the spear the sword didn't kill the cross didn't kill he gave it up he laid it down it was grief that killed him when he looked out upon the ones that he loved and the ones he had worked his miracles on the ones he'd expressed his love toward and had fed and see that they had turned him down he said you and i might be grieved we might grieve but we could never grieve like that because we're not made up of that kind of material that we could have that much grief listen you and i we identify with the idea if we all know what it's like to grieve amen amen christ knows what it's like to grieve he can identify with our grief but we can't really identify with his remember because we we can't experience what he experienced there amen listen he for the first time like i said for the first time ever he's all alone listen you can be a crowd of people and be alone oh you're at a party and everyone's having a good time there's all kinds of people you can be alone listen there's plenty of onlookers there with christ there was thieves there was roman soldiers there was onlookers but he's alone in the midst of all those people and all those watchers he is alone for the first time truly alone amen we know what it's like to be alone but we don't know what it's like to be we might feel like we're that kind of alone but he was that kind of alone we can feel grief but we can't have that kind of grief amen listen we know what it's like to feel forsaken but he knows what it's like to be forsaken by god amen i had one of these weeks my computer stopped working i was trying to help my wife get the sunday school lesson ready my computer died i don't know if my motherboard burned out or what i can't get this thing to work amen i just i look at this you know uh my transmission went on my suv my dog died i thought man this make a bad country song dog died my truck you know i i had one of these weeks you know we we've been through weeks like that amen i thought at least my wife didn't leave me or something praise god she's faithfully man but i had a rough week amen but you know what god hasn't forsaken me amen service that day when i was driving to church i felt forsaken but i wasn't forsaken but he said i want you to realize what it's like to feel that way because that's how it was at calvary amen you look at the disciples and what they were going through amen they were they were having a bad week they felt forsaken but they hadn't been forsaken they felt that way but one was forsaken for them those disciples of 2000 years ago on that first easter they had good friday they're going into the weekend listen they felt forsaken they had given up jobs they had given up homes they had given up lands they had they had followed jesus they had been his disciples and now they they see all these things that happen here's jesus and they they know we forsook him in his hour of temptation now he's dead they're not getting up sunday morning sitting there getting the ham in out of the oven first of all they don't ham anywhere their juice but it's not kosher you know they're not getting the christmas men do you know the the meal ready and oh we're gonna have a good time at church today praise god it's resurrection sunday praise god that was not how their weekend was going they just had the worst week of their life everything they've done and everything they lay before now was all over it was all for nothing some women got up that morning for the sunrise service amen they're going to church listen they've been a lot of funerals before i doubt this is the first one they ever went to amen they'd been to tombs before they've been to funerals before they knew what it was like but they didn't expect when they went to this sunrise service they weren't going to a tomb with a body laying in there the tomb was empty before they got there he was already resurrected and when they got there there was an angel well hallelujah an angel was there to testify listen the stone's been rolled away he's not here why seek ye the living among the dead praise god somebody listen i've been to plenty of dead formal churches with their own ideas i've been in the world i've been in politics oh it's all death amen there's nothing there for you and i but praise god god sent us an angel to testify he is risen he's not here he's alive just like he said he would be praise god they weren't planning on having a celebration they took their spices they took their tribute they go there and the next thing they know they're running back to tell the disciples praise god we met somebody we've been an angel he let us know he's not dead christ is alive won't believe what happened today at church we found out he's not in the tomb you won't believe it guess what they didn't believe it oh that's just a bunch of women what are women though well they knew something they didn't hey man praise the lord it's the truth anyhow you won't believe it the bible said they didn't believe it meanwhile the jews have already started their false report they paid some people hey let them know that's all i just made listen fake news didn't just start five or six years ago they had fake news back there at the tomb i don't know if it's brian stealth or what amen one of these fake news pundits put up oh listen they just took his body and buried it or hated her something else amen there's nothing happened there listen the rumor was already busy that morning and crush was already out of the ground the rumors didn't hold him down the roman seal didn't hold him down death couldn't hold him down he was alive he's alive today it don't matter what the world says it don't matter what you tell people to say you can't hold it back even his own disciples didn't believe it didn't stop anything he's still alive whether they believe it or not later that day there's a couple disciples and they're walking on the road to emmaus not knowing church was going to last all afternoon i hope you i hope you brought your pillow if you need something for your back yes i hope servants don't go too long today mess and they they heard it from after the end of the evening that's all they heard for hours amen listen they were walking on the road to emmaus and there you this this man comes by the way somebody starts to draw on there amen they didn't recognize the very one they were sad about the very one that felt forsaken about they didn't realize he was right there the whole time oh i wish you were here his hair if you can recognize that you know i don't know what was in the mind of jesus but jesus but i just have to i just have to think you know god's got a sense of humor it had to be just a little almost amusing because jesus draws an ear and he sees them all sad and down-hearted what manner of communications are these that you're sad oh well are you a stranger in these parts everybody's how do you not know me and this guy don't know nothing are you a stranger and you don't know the news listen this this jesus of nazareth he was a mighty prophet word indeed but our leaders they condemned him and they killed him and and and and we believed he was the salvation of israel and now he's dead and besides this we've had some women come to us this morning and they told us he's alive but we went couldn't find him we just know what to make out of it i've not heard these things jesus says what things tell me about it you know you go to pray sometimes like lord i'm just going through so much like he don't know like he doesn't know already lord you just don't know what i've been through yeah he does the cross proved he knows exactly what you're going through lord i've just gone through so much oh yeah like like what oh lord they forsook you oh all these bad things happen we don't even know whether he's alive why would he be alive they killed him amen oh slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory and i love the scripture says he begins at moses and all the prophets and he preaches christ to them amen if you can't see jesus christ in every scripture in the bible go back and read it again because he starts from the very beginning and he goes through and said this was christ can i dramatize this a little bit i hope that's all right we're not worried about our time like i said we've got all afternoon we've got until evening i'm not going to keep it that long we've got till the evening when they go settle down amen mama dramatize us a little bit he began to start with moses and he went through the entire bible maybe he began to preach about the patriarch abraham god's covenant with abraham showing that god had made a grace covenant with abraham it was an unconditional covenant abraham didn't have anything to do with it god started it god was going to finish it god swore by himself he would give a promise to the earth the promise of abraham the holy ghost has been fulfilled through jesus christ how god was going to require a sacrifice from abraham and then god come and said i'll provide myself a lamb i provided it three days ago i'll provide for myself a sacrifice abraham you don't need to do it i'll provide one for you you just believe it probably come over and preach the prophet like unto moses shown moses deliver me preach why christ speak god's speaking through the message god's speaking through all these messages talking about how god had commissioned moses he had the authority to speak and go forward amen preach a second handed robe preach about elijah getting elijah's robe preparing him for the ministry that he given him the preaching about isaiah and the influence of another how isaiah had looked at that great king uzziah how he lifted him up as a man but one day isaiah chapter six one day after king josh died isaiah saw the real king he saw the lord high and lifted up and his train filled the temple isaiah thought that uzziah had been a great man he thought he had a great political kingdom but in the presence of god isaiah realized what was me i thought i was a great person i thought he was a great person but in the presence of that holy god he realized woe is me for i am a man of unclean lips i dwell in the midst of an unclean people but praise god there was a servant took a life call off that altar and touched his lips he said your iniquity is purged your sin is purged hallelujah hope you see where i'm going with this went through the scripture and he began to preach messages beginning to go home this was christ and that was christ joseph a perfect type of christ forsaken by his brethren but he was brought to redeem they meant it for evil but god intended it for god everything he had told him it pointed not to appointed to christ amen i believe that's what the message the hour is this to us today amen listen those men on the road to emmaus they understood and they even acknowledged everything that jesus told him in that form amen but they still didn't realize who was talking to him until the evening time amen many people walk along in this evening time they hear the message and they testify these disciples oh our hearts burned within us as they walked along the way they think that they they've got it oh i just i felt a tingle i felt great at church i had this burning in my heart but brother bram said that the baptism of holy ghost is the revelation of jesus christ to you personally what do you recognize it's christ in you the hope of glory that's the baptism of the holy ghost a lot of people hear the message they hear the bible they get excited and their hearts burn but when they got in that little room in the evening time and he began to break the bread and he blessed the bread he broke the bread to them then their eyes were opened brothers and sisters it's not enough for us just to get excited and have our hearts burn god open our eyes today if there'd be one here that doesn't see him today let him come and open your eyes they opened their eyes and they knew that was christ he's alive see until you see jesus christ personally this message is no different it's just the words of a man oh it's just a man preaching it's just somebody some preacher this and that but when your eyes are open you realize it was god speaking through a man not saith the lord listen when a prophet has got thus saith the lord like in this bible listen when he's got thus saith lord it's the same thing as god speaking it's got to be more than just a bunch of learning to us listen they understood all those things but their eyes weren't open amen there's a group of people and the bible testifies in the last days there's a group of people they're ever learning but they never come to a knowledge of the truth oh they've always got some new doctrine they're always picking up some new thing oh i've never heard it preached that way before probably because it's made up oh i had a brother one time he oh brother i've never heard anybody preach a message like this guy preached he's just so fearless and you need to go back and hear what he has i've never heard this preached before okay well let's uh let's go hear what it's about hey man i got my red flag up here now listen i'm not talking about if you just come to church you never know about somebody you study the bible and stuff and just got this wild idea nobody's ever had this before jesus because it's made up that's why you've never heard before amen well praise the lord this brother's like oh this guy you know most preachers that they've got too much fear to preach something like this guy preached i went back to the brother after i listened to his sermon i said brother i agree with you i i fear god too much to preach what that man preached i i'm not that brave i fear god brother what do you mean i'm like if i would say that i'd be i'd put my soul in hell preaching this kind of false nonsense amen i'm not going to tell you what's all about but i'm just making the point amen lots of people hear things they understand things but it's when you see christ for yourself that's what makes the difference it doesn't it's not good for me to tell you he's alive if you can't see him alive for yourself if that's your attitude towards the message it'll always just be what brother branham said brother branham said brother braham said what did god say god is speaking to us amen not the man the man's not god i hope you understand him now jesus is jesus was god he is god but it's more than just a man speaking to us see a lot of people look at they look at the a man's life they say well listen this man he he has faults his failures and mistakes i'm like oh you mean like every other man that's ever lived besides jesus oh well listen this guy lied one time just once and he's doing good i mean he's not but he is hey man i mean some people they lie every time they draw breath i know a couple of them praise the lord if i want to know the truth i just take everything they say and believe the opposite i'm closer you all laughing because you know some yourself well listen well brother branham he he did this wrong and this that brother brad makes this statement i really like this this all ties into being forsaken so don't think i've left my thought but the man talks about this in his life story he's telling 1959 i believe it's at the english temple in california but he said it was given out that today i was i was to kind of talk to you for a while on my life story he said that that's a hard thing for me this would be the first time i've tried to approach it for many years and i i would not have time to go into the details but just part of it now what this is what he says he says in here i've made many mistakes i've done many things that was wrong and i'll desire that you in the radio land and you that are present you will not take my mistakes to be stumbling stones but stepping stones that bring you closer to the lord jesus see sometimes people try to take the man william branham take his life and his mistakes as a man and try to disqualify the message well the man made mistakes so did abraham abraham listen abraham made some big mistakes so did isaiah i like how the prophet says you think those proud jews with their heritage and their their their ethnic pride do you think they would write those things about themselves listen there's lots of things about your life you would never write down to tell anybody amen amen abraham writing this listen even moses moses has to write down what he did wrong you think moses wanted to write down oh yeah i murdered an egyptian one day oh yeah i got mad and smoked the rock twice he didn't want to write those things he was inspired he said that man made mistakes yeah and god was greater than their mistakes that's what makes god so great nothing took a perfect man and did it then he could take us and do the same thing amen it's god strong even this is what i want you to catch even in our mistakes he'll never leave us or forsake us you say why was christ forsaken so you wouldn't have to be you can have a perfect assurance and a confidence every day for the rest of your life he was forsaken so i will never have to be no matter how alone i feel no matter how many mistakes i make no matter how bad i feel no matter what i go through i will never leave you i will never forsake you christ was forsaken so you never have to be oh but look how ugly and bad you know look look at all these things and god still loved him and god still used him and god still loves you and god still uses you yeah amen amen see we look at all these mistakes in people's life say well okay god use that person and then we get our own mistakes like well well listen there's there's a perfectly valid reason for why i made a mistake oh yeah i got it right yeah rules for thee but not for me praise the lord brother bram tells this story about this little girl i love this story maybe you know it brother ben tells this story this little girl she she went off to college and she was a bit of a smart aleck and she was in the popular group and this and that she'd come home one day she took the train home with one of her friends when to go back to the hometown and she gets off the train and her mama's waiting there for her now her mama is not pretty at all this little girl she's a young girl she's pretty all these things and her mom she's she's actually disfigured her skin's been burnt and she's she's covering all these things and mama comes to see her little girl at the train station and mama goes and throws her arms around and kisses her oh honey i missed you sweetie and that friend said who's who's this woman doing all this that little girl she was just a little bit of shame said i i don't know who this is i don't want to be identified with all of her ugliness she's got all this ugliness i don't want to be identified with it i want to be distinct from it and she she pretended like she didn't know who she was see look she looked at the ugly part of her mother she was a shame to be identified with that some people do that with the bible well listen this guy did this bad thing in the bible and they look at that and they say well then the bible you know these people they're not they look at the ugliness of it and they don't know the whole story they look at all the bad things associated with religion they throw out religion well listen this is not religion this is resurrection i'm talking about they'll take all the bad examples and use that and say well let's see there's just nothing to it i know a guy one time and this is 50 years ago one time one guy i prayed for and he didn't get better well god's not a healer and they'll ignore the thousands of times that god's healed people they don't even know the whole story but they just assume they're just looking at the ugliness listen if you just look at the cross and the ugliness and the reproach of this man and you stop there there's nothing to it but you don't know the whole story and that that little girl she she denied she even knew who her mother was and that train conductor was there he said you ought to be ashamed of yourself shame on you he said you ought to be ashamed how you're treating that's your mother he said listen you don't know but i know the whole story you don't remember because you were only six months old when it happened you were upstairs one day in the house when you were just six months old a little baby in the crib and you were upstairs sleeping and mama was outside she was hanging the laundry on the line hanging out on the line outside he said she's she was a beautiful the most beautiful woman i've ever met far more beautiful than you are sweetie i threw the sweetie in there she's way more beautiful than you are she was far more beautiful but she was outside one day hanging the laundry or you were just asleep a little baby and a fire started in the house and the wind kicked up and the house just burst into flames and all the neighbors come out and said something mama couldn't stand it she said i got to go in there and save my baby and she grabbed a wet a wet sheet from the line listen to neighbors and these people that tried to stop her from getting out you can't go up there i think of jesus on disciples you can't go to jerusalem you can't do this no i gotta go you can't stop me i gotta go there's a reason to go mama said i don't care she fought her way loose took that wet sheet and covered herself ran into that burning house ran upstairs got to her little baby and then she realized i got to get this baby out of here but i've only got one sheet to do it with so she took that sheet that had protected her all that time she took that sheet she wrapped that baby in that and she ran down the stairs and she fought through flames and fire and smoke and it bitter and it torched her body and the flames consumed her skin her cheek sunk in and the skin on her flesh melted down the bone just figured it for the rest of her life almost killed her to save her little baby and there's that same little baby all grown up and she's ashamed of mommy but you don't realize that man said she became ugly so you could be beautiful amen she was ugly so you could be beautiful she forfeited everything she had that you could live brother said that's what christ did for us he left glory he left power he left heaven to be wrapped in a swaddling cloth lay on a pile of manure be tempted as we are afflicted be hungry be tired be alone be rejected he chose to do that he became ugly so we could be beautiful listen he didn't have to come that way the bible says in isaiah 53 he is despised this is messiah now oh brother people mistreat me and stuff listen he was despised and rejected of men a man of sorrows oh man this hitting much of a shot in service i guess oh he's just always down trout he's always all sad listen he had a reason to be his man of sorrows hey man look what they put him through we act like we've got it rough and we do have it rough but he really had it rough a man of sorrows this is this is christ acquainted it was it was not an unfamiliar visitor to him acquainted with grief and we hid as it were our faces from him like that girl he was despised we esteemed him not surely he hath borne our griefs and carried our sorrows now you know why he was that way he bore your griefs he carried your sorrows and actually if you look in the hebrew he's actually talking about your your pains in your infirmities he's talking about divine healing amen not not just metaphysically he really did bear your it's the children's bread amen if you're sick today easter says you can be healed so how do i know if he approves whether i'll be healed or not easter approved it he approved his plan of salvation that day at calvary and he he verified on that resurrection amen what is divine healing it's the earnest of our inheritance it's the earnest of the resurrection amen amen he carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him in other words we decided we thought of him as stricken smitten of god and afflicted but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our somebody say our with me our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed with his strength this is everything christ did he did it for you he did not one thing for himself that's why a prophet can say eternal life is living for others he for us he for our everything he did was for you why would you be ashamed of that all but look how look look at how ugly it looks look how disfigured look at how humble and petty it looks look at how great it is he did it for you he did it for me he was forsaken like no man's ever ever could be forsaken for you and i brother brown says the spirit left this is rising of the sun 65. the spirit left him in the garden against somebody he had to die a man remember friends he didn't have to do that he had a choice in it but he submitted his choice he didn't have to do that that was god god anointed that flesh which is human flesh and he didn't if he went up there's god he had never died that kind of death can't kill god but he didn't he didn't have to do that but remember he went there with you in him see god had never separated the bride from the groom yet so when god looked down upon the body of christ he saw both male and female it was all redeemed in that one body they are one i tell you if that don't light your fire you would might be wet amen you say how we're gonna be one you were one back there you died with him you were banged with him but praise god you rose with him on the third day you didn't just raise up you have ascended with him into heavenly places you were sit down with him he has managed to sit down with him who is the head of all principality and power you were dead in sins and trespasses yet you has he quickened he has made you alive he's made you just sit in heavenly places together in christ jesus there's your resurrection today there's your easter today you're already risen amen oh hallelujah praise god somebody listen you didn't just get saved 10 years ago or 20 years ago or on a certain day you were saved 2 000 years ago when christ rose again you just recognized one day your eyes were open and you saw he was forsaken so that god would never leave me amen you'd never have to be those disciples were so discouraged that's when he appeared maybe you feel a little dejected today maybe you had a week-long guy did you say oh praise you know does god even love me why do i why do i even try sometimes well it had nothing to do with your effort in the first place now did it now you didn't start this why are you trying to finish it you act like you got all this all you have to do is present yourself a living sacrifice give it to god he paid for it he made a way for you to be free he appears to his disciples what's he say lo i am with you always no matter where you go don't ever fear to go anywhere or do anything the unfailing presence of the lord jesus christ is with you always as i was with moses so shall i be with you amen david said will my father and my mother forsake me god will take me up amen he said his goodness his mercy they followed me you didn't chase it down they even followed you all the days of your life i think of the prophet isaiah god said sing o heavens and be joyful o earth and break forth into singing o mountains for the lord hath comforted his people aren't you glad he's comforted us today he has comforted his people he'll have mercy upon the afflicted but zion said the lord hath forsaken me he's like i'm going to comfort you guys oh god's forsaking me he's not anywhere nearby did you just hear what i said he said i said i've not forgotten you i'm not forsaking you zion says oh the lord has forsaken me and my god has forgotten me he asked the question can a woman forget her sucking child that she should not have compassion on the son of a womb i used to think that was impossible but this world's taught me it's not it astounds me i was a little boy when i found out hey man they found some little baby in a dumpster somewhere mommy just tossed the baby in the dumpster he asked the question can a sucking mom forget her child he says they may forget but i will not forgive me even if mommy can't for if she can't keep with you if she forsakes you god still won't forget you he's the friend that sticks closer than a brother i will not forget thee behold i have graven me on the palms of my hands amen that's the true meaning of easter he's with us until the end of the world he promised he'd never leave us or forsake us he's not just not going to leave us in other words he's not just going to not be absent it sounds like a double negative it's not just that he's here he's here and he values you he's not going to give you up for something better he gave up everything to get you he'll not forsake you he doesn't look at you one day and say i found something better he's not looking for a new wife he's not look he's not going through a midlife crisis he's not looking to upgrade he likes his little bride just the way he always has she's the apple of his eye that's that's the very thunder of his heart i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you i don't want to break into 80s music here because that would be unbecoming of a minister but let's just stand our feet amen never going to leave you never gonna you know i was gonna touch help me jesus you love the lord today if you do it's because he loved you first he don't say that you know i thought about that but for years i used to feel bad about that like man i don't love god because he loved me first and one day the lord's like well yeah how are you gonna let me first i was before you like that's right fair point this he doesn't say that to make you feel like your love's unimportant he lets you know listen i loved you first what what a wonderful love affair we have with the lord jesus christ amen that's what easter really is to us today if if you're sick and body today if you just feel a little discouraged whatever you're going through he's here and he's for you if god be for us who can be against us amen amen let's just bow our heads gracious father we thank you today for this precious gift thanks be to god for your unspeakable gift to us lord we are now today in this place beneficiaries of the resurrection we've got a blessed assurance a life assurance plan it pertains to all things that pertain to life and godliness lord you've given us everything we need for our earthly journey today you paid for it you made the payment for it that day at calvary a great deposit of the spirit the very life of god more than just a lamb or a goat or a bull the very divine life in human form come back upon us as believers that we could walk in newness of life today that's what that's easter to us newness of life resurrection power oh may we be as paul today and forsake everything to hold fast eternal life to cut them all lost that we might know you in the power of your resurrection and the fellowship of your sufferings lord there's no price too great in our life nothing so great that we could not forfeit that we might apprehend this great kingdom of which we have already been apprehended lord may we fix our eyes may we set our sights on things above oh god we have received a kingdom which cannot be removed hallelujah oh lord there's no move in this kingdom oh god we'd count not even our own lives dear to us lord today i pray for these dear children they're your children these are your people bought with a price the precious blood of god lord may thee holy sanctify their body and spirit and soul blameless at your coming may you strengthen establish and settle each one in your purpose and your will as the world is carrying on in traditions today that's all right we're not for against it's it's whatever they want to do lord we want to see there's a real meaning to this passover this is what it's about our passover has been sanctified unto us forsaken and cast out into a wilderness cast outside of religion left alone that's where we find you today that's where we meet you today that's where we abide with you today outside of man's ideas outside of the traditions of men which make the word of god of none effect we found a living reality in your presence oh god i pray we would just always be mindful of this great well spring of life that you've placed inside of us maybe we draw a refreshment from your presence knowing that you you'll gather salt together in one those that are dead there's a great resurrection coming just like there was when you gave up the ghost and the graves are open so shall be again lord i believe our loved ones i believe those that have gone on before us i believe we'll meet them in the air and so shall we ever be with you wherever you go we'll be there wherever we go now you're there lord i think of david he said lo i made my bed in hell but you were there lord at the lowest point of my life lord when i had nothing left to live for no desire when i cursed the very dead i was born lord you were there you weren't just looking over my shoulder or watching from afar off you were right there you're alive i know you're alive you're alive at me i should be dead today but there's been a a transformation by the holy ghost lord that's not just my testimony i believe there's many here just like it's the same jesus christ that met them in the garden the same jesus christ that talked with them along the way you're the same today and you do the same things bless these people we pray we commit them into your hands
