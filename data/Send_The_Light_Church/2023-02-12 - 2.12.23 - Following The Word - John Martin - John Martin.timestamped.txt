[32:14] to the Book of John chapter 10 we know

[32:36] the word

[32:44] read let's look to the author of this
[32:46] precious book Heavenly Father we stand
[32:49] here
[32:50] in need of the great Holy Spirit to come
[32:55] down
[32:57] you authored the word
[32:59] you give understanding of the word you
[33:01] give revelation of the word
[33:05] and Lord we are depending upon you today
[33:08] Lord we've we've prayed we've studied
[33:12] the Saints have prepared their hearts
[33:16] and they have come into your house with
[33:20] an expectation they're ready
[33:23] for you Lord and now God our dependency
[33:26] is upon you that you break the bread of
[33:29] life to us
[33:30] that you'd show us out of these
[33:32] scriptures Lord
[33:34] where we need to be where you would have
[33:37] us to be where we can find you in your
[33:40] will
[33:41] take this word Lord
[33:43] and let it
[33:45] let it become a part of each of Our
[33:47] Lives
[33:48] Lord we commit ourselves in this time
[33:52] into your hands that's your blessings on
[33:53] the reading of the word now for each one
[33:56] of us we pray in Jesus Christ's name
[33:58] amen amen
[34:01] Saint John chapter 10
[34:04] starting with verse number one verily
[34:05] verily I say unto you
[34:09] he that entereth not by the door of the
[34:11] Sheepfold but clineth up some other way
[34:15] the same as a thief and a robber
[34:18] but he that in Earth in by the door to
[34:20] the
[34:21] is The Shepherd of the Sheep
[34:23] and to him the Porter openeth and the
[34:25] Sheep heareth his voice and he called
[34:28] his own Sheep by name
[34:30] and leadeth them out
[34:33] and he puteth forth his own sheep he
[34:35] goeth before them and the Sheep follow
[34:38] him
[34:39] for they know his voice
[34:43] and his stranger will they not follow
[34:46] but will flee from him for they know not
[34:49] The Voice
[34:51] of strangers
[34:53] this Parable spake Jesus onto them
[34:56] but they understood not what things they
[35:00] were which he spake unto them then said
[35:03] Jesus onto them again verily verily I am
[35:08] I say unto you I am the door of the
[35:11] Sheep amen amen in verse 11 now I am the
[35:16] Good Shepherd the Good Shepherd giveth
[35:19] his life for the sheep and God bless you
[35:22] may be seated
[35:26] now back in the day the Shepherds
[35:28] would go to a pen where all the Sheep
[35:31] were mixed together and what it was is
[35:33] that there wasn't a lot of different
[35:35] areas so they would make these pens big
[35:38] enough for a number of shepherds sheep
[35:42] so all the sheep that were in this pen
[35:44] did not belong to one Shepherd
[35:47] and then each of the Shepherds would
[35:49] come up to the door or to the gate and
[35:52] he would call the Sheep by name he would
[35:56] say things that were by the Sheep knew
[35:59] that this was our Shepherd the Sheep
[36:01] recognized the voice of their Shepherd
[36:04] and they came out of the pen and then
[36:07] the shepherd would take these sheep and
[36:09] he would lead them into the place that
[36:12] the shepherd wanted them to go to for
[36:13] pasture and things
[36:15] and the illustration here is that there
[36:18] is
[36:20] um a an awareness between the sheep and
[36:24] the shepherd there's a distinct
[36:26] awareness there and
[36:29] um
[36:30] it wasn't even really matter so much uh
[36:34] what the shepherd was wearing the
[36:37] attraction was to The Voice
[36:40] and there was a tight connection between
[36:43] the two the sheep can tell the
[36:45] difference between the voices of the
[36:48] different Shepherds
[36:51] the Good Shepherd is Jesus Christ
[36:54] the voice of the Good Shepherd is his
[36:57] word
[36:58] it's not a feeling it's not an emotion
[37:02] it's simply the word of God
[37:05] we are his sheep
[37:08] and even this morning here at church we
[37:11] are in the pen
[37:16] we are in the pen and the shepherd is
[37:19] here speaking to his sheep
[37:23] and
[37:24] he is calling us out
[37:28] to go
[37:30] he's calling us out of the world
[37:34] to go where he's leading us to
[37:37] and it's all individual
[37:40] it's all it's all individual now we're
[37:42] we're
[37:44] going into a Rapture so ultimately
[37:46] that's where he's calling us too brother
[37:48] Brandon said God put something inside of
[37:51] his own that will recognize him
[37:54] he placed something there
[37:56] and when the hour comes he calls
[38:00] and they will come out of whatever
[38:02] they're doing
[38:03] to follow the voice which is the word of
[38:06] God Jesus said no man can come to me
[38:08] except the father draws him first so
[38:12] there's an appointed time for the call
[38:15] but the brand said in the message
[38:16] leadership and if the word of God is in
[38:19] you from the foundation of God in you he
[38:24] said my sheep hear my voice
[38:26] they know my hour
[38:29] a stranger will they not follow see it's
[38:32] got to be that first and all that the
[38:36] father has given me they will come every
[38:39] one of them see
[38:41] sir amen
[38:44] it's just like every seed brings forth
[38:46] of its own kind
[38:50] God placed something inside of his own
[38:55] which is a part of God Amen there are a
[38:57] lot of people who follow their emotions
[39:00] their feelings their senses some follow
[39:03] signs and miracles and wonders
[39:05] some follow their own understanding
[39:07] their own ideas their own knowledge
[39:10] and oftentimes they think it's God
[39:13] but only the Sheep
[39:16] only his sheep the Sheep of God
[39:18] recognize his voice
[39:22] that's right it's the word of God they
[39:25] recognize the importance of the word
[39:27] this is God to them
[39:31] not what their feelings say because
[39:33] their feelings could be contrary
[39:36] look Peter's feelings was contrary to
[39:38] the word
[39:39] you can't go by feelings
[39:45] the word is his voice to who the Sheep
[39:50] to the Sheep
[39:51] amen the word is the voice to a sheep it
[39:55] trumps feelings you've all played cards
[39:57] before right
[39:59] and there's something that trumps
[40:01] something else right
[40:04] right and many card games
[40:06] and the word of God trumps our feelings
[40:09] Trump's emotions it trumps signs that
[40:12] Trump's understanding
[40:15] the word is personal
[40:17] to them and they follow the word no
[40:22] matter what
[40:24] no matter how they feel no matter what
[40:26] they think no matter what they
[40:28] understand
[40:29] they follow the word that's why Church
[40:31] order is important
[40:33] because it's the word
[40:37] everyone is following someone
[40:40] another Brandon asked this question in
[40:42] the message leadership he says but now
[40:44] who leads you
[40:46] that's the question now
[40:48] we're all led by something tonight we
[40:51] have to be we're LED
[40:55] we're all following someone we could be
[40:57] following our wife
[40:58] we could be following her husband we
[41:01] could be following a close friend a
[41:03] certain author
[41:05] we could be we could have a favorite
[41:07] minister
[41:10] we're all following someone
[41:13] everyone is following someone and behind
[41:15] that someone is a voice
[41:18] and behind that voice is a spirit
[41:22] and there are only two spirits
[41:25] the spirit of error
[41:27] and the spirit of Truth
[41:30] there are many voices but there's only
[41:32] two Spirits behind all those voices
[41:35] and these voices can create a lot of
[41:37] confusion
[41:39] but we know God is not the author of
[41:42] confusion
[41:44] so one of the motives
[41:47] of all those voices is to confuse us
[41:51] now these two Spirits have two different
[41:53] agendas one
[41:55] is to get your soul ready for heaven
[41:59] a rapture a spiritual marriage for
[42:03] eternity
[42:04] this spirit is showing the bride is
[42:07] simply showing the bride how to make
[42:10] herself ready
[42:12] now the other is simply to keep that
[42:16] from happening
[42:17] just trying to keep it simple God's
[42:19] hidden Simplicity the other is just
[42:23] simply trying to keep it from happening
[42:24] and one common way to achieve this is to
[42:27] make the believer feel he's already
[42:30] ready
[42:32] that's true that's what laodicea is
[42:34] right in need of nothing
[42:38] now look at this
[42:40] first Spirit that's trying to make us
[42:42] ready Jesus said in John 16 13 how be it
[42:46] when he the spirit of Truth has come he
[42:49] will guide you into all truth
[42:56] no not just part of the truth
[42:59] the motive is all the truth
[43:03] now the other Spirit the spirit of air
[43:05] will guide you
[43:07] slightly off the path
[43:10] of all truth
[43:13] it's not going to necessarily
[43:15] necessarily send you into the bars
[43:19] it's just gonna
[43:20] slightly get you off of the path of all
[43:24] truth
[43:26] and put you on a path with mostly truth
[43:30] remember in the garden there was a mixed
[43:35] tree yes
[43:36] it was
[43:38] the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil
[43:43] and Eve lusted for that knowledge he she
[43:47] lusted for that understanding and and
[43:49] Lucifer who was that tree he was perfect
[43:53] when God created him
[43:55] but he chose to do his own will at that
[43:58] point he became a mixed tree
[44:01] that was the tree that God said don't
[44:03] partake of because that'll definitely
[44:05] destroy you
[44:06] now it had partial truth
[44:10] it was that spirit that spoke out and
[44:12] said we are we know you're the most high
[44:14] God but but
[44:18] there was something that wasn't right
[44:21] there they spoke part truth but not part
[44:24] truth
[44:28] so
[44:29] when they came out of Egypt
[44:32] they came out of Egypt a mixed multitude
[44:36] when the when
[44:38] Believers when humans come out of the
[44:41] world they come out as a mixed group
[44:45] lot pitched his tent towards Sodom mixed
[44:50] right balen pitched his tent towards
[44:52] exercising his gift for himself see
[44:55] mixed
[44:57] and there's two trees one is mixed
[45:01] and one is all truth
[45:03] and we're talking about following
[45:06] the word amen
[45:08] because the word is not mixed
[45:10] but Satan wants us to mix things with
[45:14] the word
[45:19] First Timothy 4 1 says we're not some of
[45:22] these scriptures we're not putting up on
[45:23] the board but you can write them down if
[45:25] you want he says now the spirit speaketh
[45:28] expressively that in the latter times
[45:30] some shall depart from the faith giving
[45:32] heed to what
[45:34] seducing spirits
[45:36] and doctrines of devils see they're
[45:39] mixing they were with
[45:41] the spirit they were with the faith but
[45:46] they started giving heed to other
[45:47] spirits
[45:49] mixing
[45:50] second Timothy 3 1 this no also that in
[45:54] the latter days perilous times shall
[45:57] come
[45:58] for men shall be lovers of their own
[46:00] self Covetous bolsters proud unthankful
[46:02] false accusations how do you high Mighty
[46:04] lovers of pleasure more than lovers of
[46:06] God see this there's a mixture
[46:08] mixing
[46:11] having a form of godliness but denying
[46:14] the power seeing a mixture right having
[46:17] part but not the other part
[46:19] and and this is
[46:22] this is the spirit of error
[46:26] it's wanting us to mix
[46:29] it's a mixed tree
[46:32] and that's why it's hard to tell the
[46:33] difference between the two
[46:35] this is what makes it real hard because
[46:37] it has part truth in it
[46:40] but the spirit of air the job of the
[46:43] spirit of error is to to guide you
[46:47] slightly off the path of all truth
[46:53] just slightly off the path of all truth
[46:56] just enough to where the devil can
[46:58] convince you that you're still following
[47:00] the Lord
[47:02] that you're still on the right path
[47:04] because of this this this this and this
[47:06] and he doesn't want you to look at this
[47:10] are you with me amen
[47:13] now both of these Spirits have an
[47:15] anointing
[47:16] they have an unction
[47:18] they have a power to express its plan to
[47:23] make you feel
[47:25] the way they want you to feel
[47:28] Matthew 24 24 says that these two
[47:32] Spirits or these two anointings would be
[47:35] so close in so much that if it were
[47:37] possible
[47:38] they shall deceive the very elect
[47:42] these two Spirits behind all these
[47:44] voices and behind people we are
[47:47] following
[47:50] now I don't think Jesus told us this
[47:52] that so we'd have to so we didn't have
[47:55] to worry because we're elect right now I
[47:57] don't think that's why that is there
[48:00] No in fact Jesus said when those well no
[48:04] Spirits tell you to go here or go there
[48:07] or this is where God wants you or that's
[48:09] where God wants you he said believe it
[48:12] not
[48:14] believe it not for where the carcass is
[48:17] there where the Eagles be gathered
[48:18] together
[48:19] where the true breaking of the bread of
[48:22] life is there is where you will find
[48:24] God's Believers God's children
[48:29] just gather in his name and you will
[48:32] find the true anointing of God
[48:35] in his what in his word
[48:37] in his word
[48:40] it isn't so important
[48:43] if I could say it like this
[48:46] the place that your physical body is at
[48:50] as much as where your soul is at
[48:55] amen because God is here
[48:58] to lead and guide us into all truth
[49:00] that's his
[49:01] that's why that was the definition that
[49:04] Jesus gave for sending the Holy Ghost
[49:07] was to send us
[49:10] to lead and guide us into all the truth
[49:12] that he has for us amen now in the
[49:14] course of the day
[49:16] we will hear many voices
[49:20] and the voices have a spirit behind them
[49:22] we've been instructed by the scriptures
[49:24] to try or test the spirit in order to
[49:28] know if it's really God or not
[49:31] and this takes effort
[49:33] because if we just go by our feelings
[49:35] whatever our feelings say that's it
[49:38] but you can't use your feelings
[49:40] can't choose your own your understanding
[49:42] you you can't use your your own ideas I
[49:46] mean how many times have you gotten up
[49:48] and you were just a little bit
[49:51] you know
[49:53] rough
[49:56] and your spouse says uh
[49:59] did you wake up on the wrong side of the
[50:01] bed
[50:02] foreign
[50:03] but you're the same person that woke up
[50:06] on the right side of the bed the day
[50:08] before
[50:09] and that's why we can't judge Spirits by
[50:11] how we feel
[50:13] we can't judge thoughts and Things by
[50:16] how we're feeling inside we need
[50:19] something so much greater than that
[50:23] the spirit of air being so close has the
[50:28] ability
[50:29] to mimic the spirit of Truth
[50:33] it is so close it has the ability to
[50:36] mimic the spirit of Truth the spirit of
[50:38] air brother Brandon said it can be 99.9
[50:42] 7 right
[50:45] but the spirit of truth will lead you
[50:47] into 100 percent truth
[50:50] wow I mean this is it this devil just he
[50:54] doesn't care that you're
[50:56] 0.03 percent off or 99 off he don't care
[51:02] true
[51:05] but God does care
[51:08] first John chapter 4.
[51:11] verse 1.
[51:13] beloved
[51:15] believe not every spirit
[51:20] but try the spirits
[51:24] whether they are of God
[51:27] because many
[51:30] false
[51:31] spirits
[51:33] are gone out into the world
[51:36] there are many voices many spirits many
[51:40] false prophets
[51:42] no
[51:45] this word Prophet is not someone that's
[51:47] out there proclaiming
[51:49] I am a prophet of God
[51:53] these are spirits that are trying to
[51:56] tell you
[51:58] that they are of God when they are not
[52:03] hereby know ye the spirit of God
[52:06] every spirit that confesseth that Jesus
[52:09] Christ has come into the flesh is of God
[52:15] but we know Jesus has come in the flesh
[52:19] but do we know that Jesus is the same
[52:21] yesterday today and forever
[52:25] that means Jesus in his flesh
[52:28] is the same as in our flesh
[52:32] he will he will do the same thing he did
[52:35] in US
[52:38] it doesn't stop
[52:40] it's the manifestation
[52:43] of Christ
[52:44] but if the spirit is speaking the word
[52:48] and it isn't moving to live out that
[52:51] word
[52:53] in you
[52:55] then it's not
[52:57] the spirit of Christ
[52:59] remember that
[53:01] this is so important
[53:05] it's a mixed spirit it's a spirit of
[53:07] error
[53:09] any spirit that is speaking part of the
[53:12] word but denying another part is mixed
[53:24] any spirit that speaks to you and will
[53:27] not manifest it right now get away from
[53:30] it
[53:36] see because when the word is manifested
[53:38] in you that's Christ
[53:40] amen
[53:42] but if the word is not manifested in you
[53:45] how can you trust the word that's being
[53:46] spoken out of your mouth
[53:50] now it has nothing to do with whether
[53:53] we're children of God or not children of
[53:55] God it has to do about trying the spirit
[53:57] that gets on us
[53:59] brother Branham talked about we can get
[54:01] a rough Spirit and the Lord just leaves
[54:03] and he goes sits on a on a on a pole
[54:06] somewhere and he waits for the our
[54:08] nature to kind of uh calm down
[54:12] so he feels more at home
[54:15] to come live on us in spirits they get
[54:20] on us all different times and they
[54:21] motivate us
[54:23] and and we you know we we get angry at
[54:26] something we lash out start yelling
[54:28] or get upset or storm out or walk out of
[54:31] the room or quit
[54:33] how how can that be Christ even if we're
[54:38] right
[54:39] even if we're right in how we're looking
[54:41] at the situation how can that be Christ
[54:44] in US
[54:45] because the word isn't being manifested
[54:49] it now if the word is manifested and
[54:51] you're speaking the same words
[54:54] then that's the right Spirit that's God
[54:57] see the word has to be manifested and
[55:00] this is how you try the spirit
[55:04] and and mainly your spirit but you can
[55:06] see it in others of course
[55:09] so having a form of godliness but
[55:12] denying the manifestation
[55:15] of it
[55:17] is a mixed treat
[55:20] this is not manifested and Paul said
[55:23] from such turn away
[55:25] get away from that that type of person
[55:28] remember the devil's religious
[55:32] the Bible says that he believes
[55:35] and he trembles
[55:37] so the spirit of air is the most
[55:41] religious spirit right
[55:45] it's why it's so hard to see the
[55:46] difference verse 3 and every spirit that
[55:50] confesseth not that Jesus Christ has
[55:52] come in the flesh is not of God and this
[55:56] is the spirit of antichrist we're of ye
[56:00] have heard that it should come and now
[56:02] already and even now already it it it
[56:05] it's in the world is it in the world the
[56:09] way we want to look at the Spirit of
[56:11] antichrist is any spirit that refuses to
[56:14] manifest Christ in you
[56:17] right it's not of God that's a that's a
[56:19] spirit of antichrist
[56:21] any spirit that refuses to manifest
[56:24] Christ in your body
[56:26] any spirit that says it's okay don't
[56:28] worry it's true what you're saying it
[56:29] doesn't matter
[56:36] like I'm gonna go blow up some
[56:38] abortion clinics
[56:40] because I know it shouldn't be
[56:43] well Christ wouldn't blow up abortion
[56:46] clinics
[56:48] even though abortion clinics are wrong
[56:54] so it's not about being right or wrong
[56:57] it's about having the right spirit
[57:00] I'd rather be wrong in my Doctrine but
[57:03] have the right spirit because the right
[57:05] Spirit Will Lead Me
[57:06] to the right Doctrine eventually I'll
[57:08] get my act straight
[57:10] but a wrong Spirit no matter how
[57:13] self-righteous I am
[57:16] it will lead me just off
[57:18] slightly off
[57:24] so any spirit that denies living out the
[57:27] word right now presently is an
[57:30] antichrist spirit
[57:31] it's strong it's a true statement amen
[57:35] any spirit that doesn't want you to live
[57:38] for others is an antichrist spirit
[57:42] because the spirit of Christ lives for
[57:43] others that's it's eternal life
[57:46] any spirit that doesn't want you to pay
[57:48] your tithes today is Antichrist spirit
[57:51] we're just trying to bring the word as
[57:54] it is
[57:55] because the spirit of Christ will never
[57:58] deny its word amen
[58:02] amen any spirit that enjoys skipping
[58:04] Church
[58:07] do you hear me enjoy skipping church is
[58:09] the Antichrist spirit
[58:12] because the spirit of God moved on holy
[58:14] men of old
[58:16] as they wrote the word
[58:19] and the word says forsaking not the
[58:22] assembling of ourselves together and all
[58:24] the more as we see the day approaching
[58:26] so we've got to recognize the spirit
[58:29] that is anointing us amen that's just
[58:33] getting us slightly off all the truth
[58:38] Satan is accuser of the brother right
[58:41] right so when any Spirit speaks to us
[58:43] about somebody else
[58:46] something ill
[58:48] something somebody did to us
[58:51] something that just wasn't right
[58:52] something that wasn't fair shouldn't be
[58:58] and we begin to agree with that spirit
[59:04] and think evil
[59:08] think evil
[59:11] agree with that
[59:14] or eventually open our mouth and say
[59:17] something we shouldn't say
[59:19] that is an antichrist spirit
[59:24] but see it's so close to the very light
[59:27] because it uses a truth
[59:30] it uses the truth
[59:33] where if it's God you're going to get on
[59:36] your knees and pray for that person
[59:38] you're going to be calling on God for
[59:40] Mercy to help that person you're going
[59:42] to want to see that person restored
[59:44] you're going to want to manifest Mercy
[59:46] you're going to want to manifest Grace
[59:47] you're going to want to see God moving
[59:49] on the scene if it's the right spirit
[59:51] out around
[59:54] but because we're not taking the word as
[59:57] our absolute and and going by our
[59:59] feelings and our emotions and our we get
[1:00:01] so caught so tricked by the spirit of
[1:00:05] error
[1:00:11] the Devil comes into your mind into your
[1:00:14] thoughts he's trying to start a battle
[1:00:16] with you
[1:00:18] he's trying to start a battle second
[1:00:20] Corinthians chapter 10 verse 3 says for
[1:00:22] though we walk in the flesh we do not
[1:00:24] war after the flesh
[1:00:26] for the weapons of our Warfare they're
[1:00:28] not carnal
[1:00:29] but they're Mighty through God to the
[1:00:31] pulling down to the strongholds these
[1:00:34] strongholds cast down imaginations
[1:00:38] and every High thing that exalteth
[1:00:41] itself against the what the knowledge of
[1:00:44] God
[1:00:46] I always remember brother Hankins he
[1:00:48] used to tell us he says when you get a
[1:00:50] thought about somebody quickly pray for
[1:00:51] them quickly because if you don't sister
[1:00:55] Jeannie probably remembers that if you
[1:00:58] don't you'll end up probably thinking
[1:01:00] something bad about them
[1:01:05] and bring into captivity every thought
[1:01:09] to what to obedience
[1:01:13] God you still have a responsibility
[1:01:16] to in in the Warfare to every thought
[1:01:19] that comes into your head you still have
[1:01:21] to deal with it the right way
[1:01:23] and God is looking for you to be
[1:01:25] obedient in that in that battle
[1:01:28] even though somebody else did you wrong
[1:01:32] for instance they came to Jesus they
[1:01:34] spit on them
[1:01:36] they slapped them
[1:01:38] they made them bleed
[1:01:41] they made fun of them
[1:01:43] but he reviled not against them
[1:01:47] he was obedient to the word he he kept
[1:01:51] himself under subjection to the word of
[1:01:55] how to act
[1:01:56] right he didn't say I know you I know
[1:01:58] where you live and you know what you're
[1:02:00] when this thing's all over you're going
[1:02:02] to hell
[1:02:03] he didn't act like that
[1:02:08] either should we
[1:02:11] and having in a Readiness to Revenge all
[1:02:15] Disobedience when your obedience is
[1:02:19] fulfilled
[1:02:22] when we're truly following the word
[1:02:25] we're truly following his voice
[1:02:30] and we're we're truly obeying the word
[1:02:35] that's how you know you're following the
[1:02:37] word is when you're obeying it so now
[1:02:41] all of us obeyed are obeying the word
[1:02:44] in some part of it
[1:02:47] what we want to do is be obeying the
[1:02:49] word in the part that we're not amen now
[1:02:52] best case scenario
[1:02:54] we don't know any part of our life that
[1:02:56] we're not obeying
[1:02:58] that's best case scenario
[1:03:01] and then you come to church and then you
[1:03:03] find out the part you need to build vain
[1:03:08] worst case scenario is that
[1:03:11] you know there's a part of the word of
[1:03:13] God that you're not following
[1:03:16] but you've been okay with that
[1:03:19] you're under the influence of a spirit
[1:03:21] of error
[1:03:23] that's that anointing that I was telling
[1:03:25] you about
[1:03:29] we must learn to try the voices that are
[1:03:31] speaking to our hearts
[1:03:33] try them test them how do you do that
[1:03:36] with the rest of the word we don't want
[1:03:38] to rely on our feelings or ideas or
[1:03:40] circumstances or our opinions
[1:03:43] but we must try them verse 4 ye are of
[1:03:48] God little children and have overcome
[1:03:49] them because greater
[1:03:52] is he that is in you than he that is in
[1:03:55] the world so we don't have an excuse for
[1:03:57] not living the word
[1:03:59] we don't have an excuse for not obeying
[1:04:02] this word
[1:04:03] if we are overcomed
[1:04:06] and all of a sudden
[1:04:08] we begin to act unchristianized
[1:04:12] we simply need to repent and say sorry
[1:04:15] Lord and quickly get back to the word
[1:04:18] do not wallow in that thing right
[1:04:21] do not live in that thing do not do not
[1:04:24] let the sun go down upon your wrath do
[1:04:26] not allow Satan to take the upper hand
[1:04:29] of the upper advantage in your life
[1:04:35] they are of the world therefore speak
[1:04:38] they of the world and the world notice
[1:04:40] here at them so who gets caught up in
[1:04:44] the spirit of air
[1:04:45] who listens to the spirit who follows
[1:04:48] this is they that are of the world
[1:04:51] the majority of the spirits that speak
[1:04:55] to us are of the world
[1:05:00] the majority of the voices that we hear
[1:05:03] in our head are of the world
[1:05:06] it's the truth
[1:05:08] it's the truth now if you're walking in
[1:05:11] the spirit I mean you are walking in the
[1:05:14] spirit well I'll just say it like this
[1:05:16] the devil don't want to be around you
[1:05:17] right
[1:05:19] you'll probably have a lot less I know
[1:05:22] you will you will have a lot less
[1:05:24] problems
[1:05:25] because you're walking in the spirit
[1:05:29] but you don't walk in the spirit because
[1:05:31] you're a child of God that's not what
[1:05:32] you don't find any scripture in the
[1:05:34] Bible that says that
[1:05:37] you have to walk in the spirit to not
[1:05:38] fulfill the lust of the flesh
[1:05:40] you have to press in
[1:05:43] Vite God in make them part of everything
[1:05:46] verse six now we we are of God and he
[1:05:49] that knoweth God heareth us
[1:05:52] he that
[1:05:54] he that is not of God they don't listen
[1:05:56] to us
[1:05:57] hereby know we the spirit of Truth
[1:06:00] and look the spirit of air
[1:06:03] there's your two spirits
[1:06:06] any Spirit wants you to compromise
[1:06:09] with the word
[1:06:11] mix with the word
[1:06:14] Paul said it like this let him be
[1:06:17] accursed
[1:06:20] if a man come preaching or Spirit come
[1:06:22] preaching any other thing that what's
[1:06:25] already been written that's why it's
[1:06:28] important for us to spend time in the
[1:06:30] word
[1:06:31] it isn't that we have it right it before
[1:06:33] it isn't that we haven't heard it before
[1:06:37] but we need God to bring things to our
[1:06:39] remembrance which he promised to do
[1:06:42] and and we hide that word it becomes
[1:06:44] important to us and that we don't want
[1:06:46] to miss him because
[1:06:49] he's leading us into all truth
[1:06:53] amen
[1:06:55] now Jesus said in Saint John chapter 10
[1:06:58] he said I am the door
[1:07:02] I in the door verse that very very not
[1:07:04] saying to you I'm the door of the Sheep
[1:07:07] verse 8 and all that ever came before me
[1:07:09] are thieves and robbers but the Sheep
[1:07:10] did not hear them I am the door for if
[1:07:13] for for by me if any man enter in he
[1:07:17] shall be saved and shall go in and out
[1:07:19] and find pasture
[1:07:23] so this is you know what a blessing that
[1:07:26] we just come in and we feed on the word
[1:07:27] of God amen amen
[1:07:31] the thief cometh not but to steal to
[1:07:33] kill destroy and I've come that they
[1:07:35] might have life and that they might have
[1:07:37] it more abundantly
[1:07:41] thank God he's here to give his life
[1:07:43] more abundant than what we already have
[1:07:48] I want it I want more
[1:07:50] I want more joy I want more peace I want
[1:07:53] more love I want I want honestly I want
[1:07:56] to be able to love the person who almost
[1:07:59] kills me
[1:08:04] because if I have that then I know I
[1:08:07] have what Jesus had amen
[1:08:10] but anything short of that is really not
[1:08:12] the Abundant Life that he's promised
[1:08:15] says I am the Good Shepherd the Good
[1:08:17] Shepherd giveth his life for the Sheep
[1:08:21] are there so many subjects in these
[1:08:23] scriptures but turn with me if you would
[1:08:25] if you got your Bibles with you I trust
[1:08:27] it you brought your swords Psalms 23.
[1:08:32] Psalms 23 following we're following the
[1:08:35] word now right
[1:08:43] Psalms 23 the Lord is my shepherd notice
[1:08:49] my it's a personal
[1:08:52] the Lord is my shepherd he's the Good
[1:08:54] Shepherd he's the the door of the sheep
[1:08:56] and the very next words is I shall not
[1:09:00] want
[1:09:02] if God is your personal Shepherd then
[1:09:05] he's your boss
[1:09:11] whatever you want outside of him
[1:09:14] becomes your struggle in life
[1:09:17] and eventually will become your downfall
[1:09:21] so this these four words that we want to
[1:09:24] just bypass
[1:09:25] are really crucial to the rest of the
[1:09:27] Psalms
[1:09:29] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not one
[1:09:33] now that needs to be exercised
[1:09:37] a one good way to do it is is as our
[1:09:39] brother Mark was saying seek ye first
[1:09:42] seek ye first the kingdom
[1:09:45] and everything else is going to be added
[1:09:47] to your life
[1:09:50] now
[1:09:52] if if God is your personal Shepherd
[1:09:54] you're not seeking your will
[1:09:58] think about it
[1:09:59] you're not seeking your wants you're not
[1:10:01] seeking your way you're not seeking your
[1:10:03] ideas in this personal relationship that
[1:10:06] you have with your Shepherd
[1:10:11] we don't have anything to do with God's
[1:10:13] leadership for our life
[1:10:15] it's his leadership
[1:10:17] we don't go into a meeting like they do
[1:10:21] when they're going to go to war
[1:10:24] or we're gonna go into a company meeting
[1:10:27] and we're going to talk about what we
[1:10:28] want to do
[1:10:30] where we want the company to go
[1:10:32] what how we want to surprise them in War
[1:10:35] and what angle we want to come from
[1:10:37] we're not having a meeting with God
[1:10:40] about what we are going to do in our
[1:10:42] life
[1:10:45] we didn't pitch in and create us
[1:10:49] we didn't give God some ideas or things
[1:10:52] or faith to build us
[1:10:54] right it's all him
[1:10:58] we are the Sheep of his pasture
[1:11:02] we are his creation
[1:11:06] so he's called the shots in her life I
[1:11:09] shall not want verse two he maketh me to
[1:11:12] lie down
[1:11:13] in church
[1:11:17] notice he maketh me
[1:11:21] to lie down in Green Pastures because
[1:11:23] you've forfeited your will now
[1:11:25] he leadeth me beside the Still Waters
[1:11:29] praise God for that you ever just get so
[1:11:31] busy
[1:11:33] and you know the only answer is settle
[1:11:35] down
[1:11:36] just settle down
[1:11:39] slow down
[1:11:42] it's quite easy to see why a lot of
[1:11:43] Believers are not faithful to church
[1:11:46] they have not completely forfeited their
[1:11:49] will
[1:11:51] because when you forfeit your will he
[1:11:54] maketh me to lay down in Green Pastures
[1:11:57] he will bring you that brother Brandon
[1:12:00] said it like this
[1:12:02] he says you can't wait to get there
[1:12:06] just him inside of you drawing you to
[1:12:10] the place he's at
[1:12:12] so notice we're in a battle these
[1:12:14] Spirits are so close they will deceive
[1:12:16] you
[1:12:17] you'll end up getting to the place of
[1:12:19] missing church and you'll think it's
[1:12:20] okay
[1:12:23] look it's never God's will
[1:12:26] it's never God's will now I'm not saying
[1:12:29] that there's not times that
[1:12:33] God won't allow it
[1:12:36] and that it's just literally impossible
[1:12:39] something has come up
[1:12:41] I mean that's called life
[1:12:43] but I'm not talking about that
[1:12:46] I'm talking about when you have
[1:12:49] the the capability of making something
[1:12:52] happen and you don't that's the
[1:12:55] Antichrist spirit
[1:12:57] and if we if we do not get a hold of
[1:13:00] that thing then we're really not being
[1:13:02] led by God
[1:13:05] we're really not following the word
[1:13:07] right
[1:13:09] we're following a spirit that is getting
[1:13:11] us slightly away from all truth
[1:13:21] we got to allow the spirit of God to
[1:13:23] make us lay down in Green Pastures
[1:13:26] to set us by Still Waters
[1:13:29] to lead us to the place where we can
[1:13:32] drink from him amen now notice the
[1:13:36] reason that we're following him is not
[1:13:38] for the benefits of our Natural Life
[1:13:40] is for the benefits of our soul
[1:13:43] verse 3 he restoreth my soul
[1:13:49] he leadeth me in Paths of righteousness
[1:13:52] for his name's sake
[1:13:55] if you're really following Christ the
[1:13:58] word he's calling the shots
[1:14:02] and what he's wanting to do is to
[1:14:04] restore our soul to the place it needs
[1:14:07] to be we think our soul got restored
[1:14:10] when we repented and got baptized
[1:14:15] that just put us on the track
[1:14:19] that just put us on the track that put
[1:14:22] us on the right track
[1:14:24] and if we died at that moment praise God
[1:14:26] to whom little was given little is
[1:14:30] required
[1:14:31] but if you got more days to live it
[1:14:34] ain't for you it ain't for your life
[1:14:37] it's for your soul
[1:14:40] God wants more
[1:14:42] he wants to see her soul totally
[1:14:45] restored I believe that with all my
[1:14:48] heart
[1:14:49] ye though I walk through the valley of
[1:14:52] the shadow of death I will fear no evil
[1:14:55] thou art with me thy rod and thy staff
[1:14:58] they Comfort now what is that Valley of
[1:15:00] the shadow of death
[1:15:02] it's really not death but it's the
[1:15:04] Valley of the Shadow
[1:15:06] of death it's the shadow of death so
[1:15:08] what is that what is that that's you
[1:15:11] dying out to your will
[1:15:13] you're really not dead
[1:15:15] right
[1:15:16] but you're dying out to your will and as
[1:15:19] you walk through that you know what the
[1:15:20] hardest thing is
[1:15:22] you know that you that have helped your
[1:15:26] children with driver's ed and let giving
[1:15:29] them the wheel for the first time and
[1:15:31] you're sitting in the passenger seat
[1:15:33] you're really wanting them
[1:15:36] you're really wanting the driver's ed
[1:15:37] teacher to spend more time with them
[1:15:39] first
[1:15:41] but Driver's Ed wants the parent to be
[1:15:44] responsible for spending time
[1:15:47] so you're putting
[1:15:49] your life in their hands
[1:15:53] and when you die out to your will when
[1:15:56] you say God I'm going to do your will
[1:15:58] it's a scary thing
[1:16:00] you don't get to do what you wanted to
[1:16:02] do
[1:16:05] I mean I I wanted to do some I wanted to
[1:16:09] do things
[1:16:10] that I God didn't want me to do I mean I
[1:16:13] wanted to be a doctor
[1:16:15] I wanted to be a musician I wanted to be
[1:16:18] a hockey player
[1:16:20] I did not want to be a business owner
[1:16:24] it's like I had to surrender
[1:16:31] I'll say it today that God wants us to
[1:16:34] surrender every day to him
[1:16:38] and it it's like you're walking through
[1:16:40] a valley
[1:16:42] of a shadow of death but here's the
[1:16:44] thing I will fear no evil
[1:16:48] I don't I don't have to worry what's
[1:16:50] going to happen to me God is with me
[1:16:54] the rod of Correction it comforts me
[1:16:58] the staff the staff in which I lean on
[1:17:01] when I'm tired and I need a break and
[1:17:04] it's there to comfort me
[1:17:07] thou preparest a table
[1:17:10] before me in the presence of my enemies
[1:17:14] see I don't have to worry about the
[1:17:17] enemy
[1:17:18] because God's with me
[1:17:20] because greater is he that's in me
[1:17:24] then this outside man amen
[1:17:27] thou anointest my head with oil praise
[1:17:31] God he has a work for you to do your
[1:17:34] Kings and Priests
[1:17:35] just like David was anointed to be king
[1:17:38] he has an oil for us
[1:17:41] because he has a job for us to do for
[1:17:44] him
[1:17:45] for my cup
[1:17:47] runeth over
[1:17:49] God has joy unspeakable for us
[1:17:53] he wants you to get so full of him that
[1:17:56] you're just bubbling over
[1:18:00] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:18:04] me
[1:18:06] notice you're not following it it's fall
[1:18:08] it's following you
[1:18:10] because you're following God
[1:18:12] God is good
[1:18:15] surely goodness and mercy shall follow
[1:18:17] me all the days of my life and I will
[1:18:21] dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[1:18:26] praise the lord I can't wait to get
[1:18:28] there
[1:18:30] the word of God needs to become our
[1:18:32] absolute if we're going to follow
[1:18:36] the word
[1:18:37] follow his voice it needs to become our
[1:18:41] absolute
[1:18:43] not just when it's convenient for us
[1:18:48] not just when we want to use it to judge
[1:18:50] somebody else you know how quick we are
[1:18:52] to use the word
[1:18:54] to judge somebody right that's true
[1:18:57] not only when we are claiming God's
[1:19:00] promises
[1:19:02] but it needs to be our absolute in
[1:19:05] everything
[1:19:06] not just use it for our own benefits but
[1:19:10] use it for correction
[1:19:13] use it to get our life more pleasing to
[1:19:16] him I mean Jesus went up and he said
[1:19:18] these words if you love me keep my
[1:19:19] Commandments he's sending us a message
[1:19:26] that it doesn't matter what you feel
[1:19:29] like towards me I'm looking at I'm
[1:19:31] staring at one thing I am not staring at
[1:19:33] your feelings I'm not staring at your
[1:19:35] emotions
[1:19:36] yes I am touched by all the Affliction
[1:19:39] that you're going through
[1:19:41] and he sees our emotions he sees our
[1:19:43] feelings
[1:19:45] but when it comes to the love
[1:19:46] relationship he's looking at one thing
[1:19:49] are you doing everything that I've asked
[1:19:51] you to do
[1:19:54] therein is where you're showing your
[1:19:57] your love for God
[1:20:00] you know that I'm sorry Lord you know
[1:20:03] that I'm sorry and I didn't mean to do
[1:20:05] that please have mercy on me I don't
[1:20:07] care
[1:20:08] because until you learn to have mercy on
[1:20:11] somebody else I'm not going to have
[1:20:12] mercy on you amen
[1:20:15] amen see we want to take part of the
[1:20:17] word and claim part of the word and
[1:20:19] saying I'm following the word but God is
[1:20:22] wanting us to follow all the word
[1:20:24] the part that we're not given much
[1:20:26] attention to give much attention to it
[1:20:33] the word needs to become our absolute
[1:20:37] for our lives
[1:20:39] not just part of it but all of it
[1:20:44] if the word
[1:20:46] of God is forever settle in heaven it
[1:20:49] needs to be forever settled in her heart
[1:20:52] and there and here's the key we all
[1:20:54] believe that this word is true
[1:20:57] we do
[1:20:59] we all
[1:21:00] say yes amen the word is true say Amen
[1:21:03] to that
[1:21:07] I want you to say I am doing everything
[1:21:09] that I possibly can to follow every word
[1:21:11] of God
[1:21:13] that's what we should be saying Amen to
[1:21:17] because that's the part
[1:21:20] that's important it's the life not not a
[1:21:24] spirit that says I believe but is
[1:21:26] denying the life
[1:21:29] we're looking for the spirit that says
[1:21:32] it and lives it
[1:21:34] that spirit
[1:21:37] and there's a lot of spirits that come
[1:21:38] to us
[1:21:39] and quotes it
[1:21:43] but is it willing to come submission to
[1:21:44] it
[1:21:49] and I'll say when the word of God
[1:21:52] becomes personal to you
[1:21:57] your personal absolute
[1:21:59] you can you'll know you'll you'll
[1:22:02] recognize God leading you more
[1:22:05] but if the word is not really important
[1:22:08] to you and you just kind of want God to
[1:22:10] help you with things in life
[1:22:14] and you're wanting help with that you're
[1:22:16] wanting God or the word of God to be
[1:22:18] used to help you with things in your
[1:22:20] life you're going to miss God's
[1:22:21] leadership for your life
[1:22:25] because the word is everything to God
[1:22:29] the word is everything to God
[1:22:32] and what he's trying to get his sheep
[1:22:35] on the same page with is that the word
[1:22:38] becomes everything to the Sheep
[1:22:42] the word has to become everything to the
[1:22:44] Sheep
[1:22:45] and when it becomes your personal
[1:22:47] absolute you'll recognize him leading
[1:22:50] you more
[1:22:52] because people are looking for God but
[1:22:54] they're not recognizing him in his word
[1:22:58] I could go to God all day long about
[1:23:03] something
[1:23:04] and he may or may not give it to me
[1:23:07] he may lead me in that and he may not
[1:23:10] lead me in that
[1:23:11] and I could literally write a list of
[1:23:13] 100 things that I want
[1:23:16] I could I could write 200 things at the
[1:23:20] shop that I want
[1:23:22] I can write
[1:23:24] 500 things at home that I want
[1:23:27] of course the first one would be the
[1:23:28] greenhouse
[1:23:29] yeah
[1:23:32] but you know what
[1:23:34] to me
[1:23:36] wanting
[1:23:39] what does God want amen
[1:23:41] what does God want
[1:23:45] the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want
[1:23:47] he's leading so if we can recognize the
[1:23:50] importance of this word that we've been
[1:23:53] maybe not putting enough emphasis in
[1:23:55] this is not a religion this is not just
[1:23:58] oh we're behind the message we believe
[1:24:00] in the Prophet this is our denomination
[1:24:02] that is not the message the message that
[1:24:06] Prophet The Prophet brought was that
[1:24:08] Jesus Christ was the same in you today
[1:24:11] as he was back then
[1:24:14] and if we never get him to manifest his
[1:24:17] word inside of us what does it matter if
[1:24:20] your brother and your sister isn't doing
[1:24:22] it
[1:24:25] matter
[1:24:27] what really matters is the word
[1:24:29] manifested in you
[1:24:32] my sheep hear my voice and they follow
[1:24:34] me
[1:24:36] God has not made us to just be
[1:24:41] to call out who's on sheepers
[1:24:47] no he's caught his sheep to follow him
[1:24:50] amen
[1:24:52] like to the place though he slay me yet
[1:24:54] why trust him
[1:24:57] so I go through the valley of the shadow
[1:24:59] that I will fear no evil
[1:25:01] where he leads I will follow
[1:25:05] whatever his word says no matter how
[1:25:08] small it may be no matter how
[1:25:10] insignificant no matter how minute
[1:25:13] it needs to become our absolute
[1:25:16] we don't know what God is speaking to
[1:25:18] every one of us in here
[1:25:22] but here's the thing the devil really
[1:25:24] wants to do he wants to take and dilute
[1:25:27] the word
[1:25:32] like you're doing the most important
[1:25:34] things
[1:25:36] this other stuff God understands see
[1:25:39] that Spirit of error
[1:25:42] where we got to have a hunger to please
[1:25:44] God and everything now look it's
[1:25:47] impossible for me to give every one of
[1:25:50] you a million dollars
[1:25:53] so that pressure is off of me
[1:25:56] that's gone
[1:25:58] because I don't have a million dollars
[1:26:00] to give everybody
[1:26:03] so God knows our limitations
[1:26:07] but I can spend some time praying amen
[1:26:10] am I doing that
[1:26:13] I can spend some time saying God
[1:26:16] there's part of this word that I am not
[1:26:18] obeying and I need your help
[1:26:21] I can't do that
[1:26:24] see it's all about your personal
[1:26:26] relationship with God
[1:26:29] God help us
[1:26:32] God help us
[1:26:35] Psalms 119 105 says Thy word is a lamp
[1:26:39] unto my feet
[1:26:41] a light unto my path I never I'll never
[1:26:44] forget brother Johnson talking about uh
[1:26:48] when he went in the mission field that
[1:26:50] there was uh some places that he went to
[1:26:53] where they would actually strap lanterns
[1:26:56] on their ankles or on their legs
[1:26:59] and as they walked through the jungle uh
[1:27:03] they had just enough light to see what
[1:27:05] was in front of them
[1:27:07] so they wouldn't be stepping on any
[1:27:09] wrong thing
[1:27:11] and when we come to church
[1:27:15] this word is a lamp for our feet
[1:27:20] it gives light to the path around now
[1:27:22] what is the path we're on he lead us is
[1:27:24] he he restores our soul he leads us in
[1:27:27] Paths of righteousness for so this word
[1:27:30] is to help us in the right way
[1:27:33] that's what the light is for that's what
[1:27:36] the word being preached for the word
[1:27:37] gives life
[1:27:39] to our walk
[1:27:42] God is leading you down a path to to
[1:27:47] Soul restoration
[1:27:49] that's the path he's leading you down
[1:27:51] Paths of righteousness he's he's making
[1:27:53] you to lay down in Green Pastures and
[1:27:56] he's leading you besides Still Water
[1:27:58] that's what the light is for
[1:28:03] my sheep hear my voice
[1:28:05] and they follow me down this path
[1:28:15] now here's the hardest thing for us to
[1:28:18] do
[1:28:19] is we're trying
[1:28:21] we're trying so hard
[1:28:24] to hear God speak something personal to
[1:28:26] us when we're at church
[1:28:31] like God you know my struggles you know
[1:28:34] what I'm going through or God you know
[1:28:35] what I want
[1:28:37] or you know
[1:28:38] I I didn't read chapter 10 and this is
[1:28:41] not I was reading chapter nine
[1:28:46] seasons
[1:28:50] why we're having a hard time connecting
[1:28:53] with hearing God's personal voice to us
[1:28:56] but just trying to keep this simple
[1:28:59] your God wants our heart
[1:29:04] to follow this word
[1:29:08] and I don't care if we're on chapter 10
[1:29:10] chapter 11 12 13 14 it's all important
[1:29:13] to him
[1:29:15] and our longing needs to be God whatever
[1:29:20] you tell me I'm going to follow because
[1:29:24] if we don't
[1:29:26] we're just we're like a thief and robber
[1:29:29] that wants the good things of God
[1:29:32] but not willing to walk into the door
[1:29:35] not willing to go the right way Jesus is
[1:29:37] the door
[1:29:38] and he is the word
[1:29:41] there's not one scripture in here that
[1:29:44] isn't Jesus Christ in fact the prophet
[1:29:47] says if you don't see Jesus in that
[1:29:48] scripture go back and read it so all the
[1:29:51] word is important to God it needs to
[1:29:54] become important to us if we lose that
[1:29:56] importance if we shy away from that if
[1:29:59] we allow the things of the world to just
[1:30:01] kind of overshadow Our Lives
[1:30:05] become consumed
[1:30:07] we get off the path
[1:30:10] and that's only a spirit of air that
[1:30:13] will do that
[1:30:15] let's take a look at Peter for a moment
[1:30:18] when Jesus came to Peter
[1:30:20] he said come on Peter follow me I'm the
[1:30:23] Good Shepherd and you know what I'm
[1:30:25] going to make you
[1:30:26] a very rich person
[1:30:29] did he say that
[1:30:31] no no
[1:30:33] he said I'm going to make you real
[1:30:34] popular
[1:30:36] no
[1:30:41] Fishers of men's souls in other words
[1:30:45] you're going to be in the restoration
[1:30:46] business with me
[1:30:49] and you know straightway the Bible says
[1:30:52] straight away they left their occupation
[1:30:54] they left their business
[1:30:57] to follow him kind of a reckless
[1:30:59] abandonment wouldn't you say
[1:31:02] but there was something inside of Peter
[1:31:05] something inside of his brother
[1:31:08] my sheep hear my voice and they follow
[1:31:11] me
[1:31:12] and so Peter they began to follow
[1:31:15] the Lord and he followed him through
[1:31:18] discipleship Jesus taught them and they
[1:31:21] they went out two by two and they they
[1:31:23] casting out devils and healing all men
[1:31:25] are sicknesses
[1:31:27] and the word began to get hard to them
[1:31:31] all sudden they thought they were doing
[1:31:33] the right thing and Jesus said you don't
[1:31:34] even know what Spirit you're of don't
[1:31:35] act like that
[1:31:39] and did you know the majority of Jesus's
[1:31:42] disciples left him
[1:31:43] the majority
[1:31:46] let's pick it up in in John chapter 6.
[1:31:52] remember many are called if you are
[1:31:53] chosen the word keeps getting harder and
[1:31:55] harder as we follow him from that time
[1:31:57] many of his disciples went back and
[1:32:00] walked no more with him
[1:32:03] now I want you to think about this these
[1:32:05] disciples never thought
[1:32:07] they were leaving God foreign
[1:32:14] they just thought that this man that
[1:32:16] they were following
[1:32:18] wasn't
[1:32:20] all of God
[1:32:22] wasn't all of God
[1:32:27] and there's the trick
[1:32:32] Satan wants us to make some reason why
[1:32:36] we're not going to keep following him
[1:32:38] but we're going to step back while we're
[1:32:40] going to take it easy
[1:32:42] why we're going to follow him from afar
[1:32:44] or why we're just going to start see
[1:32:47] they lean to their own understanding
[1:32:49] they had their own ideas their own
[1:32:51] thoughts their own feelings about the
[1:32:54] word that was being preached the Bible
[1:32:56] made it real clear that they did not
[1:32:58] understand the word that was being
[1:33:00] preached
[1:33:02] and we don't praise God we don't have to
[1:33:05] understand it
[1:33:06] how many times did the Bible say after
[1:33:09] Jesus got done talking about Parables
[1:33:11] and things he said and his disciples
[1:33:13] didn't understand it
[1:33:15] that's okay
[1:33:17] understanding comes it will come
[1:33:20] but you got to believe it
[1:33:23] there's many things you know the prophet
[1:33:26] went a long time
[1:33:28] not clearly understanding certain things
[1:33:31] in the scriptures
[1:33:34] God's the only one that can break it to
[1:33:36] us amen
[1:33:38] all right verse 67 then said Jesus unto
[1:33:41] the twelve are you going to go away also
[1:33:44] are you going to step back slide back
[1:33:46] are you going to start not being
[1:33:47] faithful
[1:33:49] and then Simon Peter answered
[1:33:52] Lord to whom shall we go thou has the
[1:33:56] words of eternal life
[1:33:59] amen and we believe and are sure that
[1:34:01] though at the Christ the son of the
[1:34:02] Living God
[1:34:03] and Jesus answered said I have have not
[1:34:06] a chosen to have not I chosen you 12 and
[1:34:10] one of you is a devil that's a whole
[1:34:12] nother sermon
[1:34:13] that's a whole another sermon notice
[1:34:15] many are called few are chosen he uses
[1:34:18] that word chosen here and it's not the
[1:34:21] same word
[1:34:23] not the same meaning
[1:34:25] he spake or judasized Gary at the son of
[1:34:27] Simon for he it is that should betray
[1:34:30] him being one of the twelve
[1:34:34] so the more that Peter followed the word
[1:34:37] the harder it got for him
[1:34:40] the word kept getting harder and harder
[1:34:43] to follow there's no problem casting out
[1:34:45] Devils but when the word began to say
[1:34:48] that you need to suffer for the word
[1:34:51] and that was it when Jesus said look I'm
[1:34:54] going to die I'm going to be taken away
[1:34:56] I'm going to suffer from the high priest
[1:35:00] no that ain't going to happen
[1:35:02] Peter rolls up no that ain't going to
[1:35:04] happen
[1:35:05] Jesus said look I'm not the only one
[1:35:07] that's going to have to go through this
[1:35:09] you're going to have to go through this
[1:35:11] no way we're going to band together
[1:35:12] we're going to be United together we're
[1:35:14] going to fight this thing together
[1:35:16] I'm never going to leave you I'm never
[1:35:18] going to deny you I want nothing to
[1:35:20] happen to you
[1:35:22] you know that was an antichrist spirit
[1:35:25] here is his own disciple
[1:35:28] trying to stay
[1:35:32] in unity
[1:35:34] in in unity with Christ but noticed it
[1:35:39] was the Flesh of Christ
[1:35:43] it wasn't the spirit of Christ
[1:35:45] because the spirit of Christ was
[1:35:47] speaking
[1:35:49] and what the word says it's going to
[1:35:51] happen
[1:35:52] and Earth will pass away but the word is
[1:35:54] not going to pass away amen but see we
[1:35:56] can become attached to the Natural
[1:36:01] the natural
[1:36:03] and Jesus was speaking to the spiritual
[1:36:07] are you with me
[1:36:11] anytime we disagree with the word
[1:36:13] it's the wrong spirit
[1:36:17] that's why we need to to go on and get
[1:36:20] the Holy Ghost for ourselves and let God
[1:36:22] have preemness because that's what was
[1:36:24] really really missing and I'm not saying
[1:36:26] that I feel that all of us here have a
[1:36:31] portion of the Holy Ghost
[1:36:33] amen
[1:36:36] and I if I could say this
[1:36:39] if I could say we are all sealed with
[1:36:42] the Holy Ghost
[1:36:43] if I could say that
[1:36:46] I would still say to you you need to go
[1:36:49] on and get more Holy Ghost
[1:36:51] my message is not going to change
[1:36:55] because see it's only the devil that's
[1:36:57] wanting to make you feel like you have
[1:36:59] enough it is not the spirit of God
[1:37:02] God has wanted us to press in now the
[1:37:04] word is leading us to a complete
[1:37:07] restoration of our soul a complete
[1:37:09] manifestation of the word it is Christ
[1:37:12] in you the hope of glory and all the
[1:37:14] Earth is groaning waiting for this
[1:37:17] manifestation to take place
[1:37:19] we're kind of waiting around for this
[1:37:22] and that and
[1:37:23] God is waiting for his seed to come
[1:37:27] forth
[1:37:28] no
[1:37:30] it's not for everybody
[1:37:32] how many times we talk to some people
[1:37:34] and they turn us down it's sad
[1:37:37] but we are his sheep we're the Sheep of
[1:37:41] his pasture
[1:37:42] he has he has brought us in to feed on
[1:37:45] the word to get in his presence and to
[1:37:49] leave here
[1:37:50] manifesting the word that we hear here
[1:37:54] that we hear hear
[1:37:56] you know what I'm saying
[1:37:58] all right
[1:38:00] I'm going to stop there I have three
[1:38:01] more pages but time is up and I don't
[1:38:05] want to you get time read Matthew 19 27
[1:38:08] 229
[1:38:11] can I at least read one quote
[1:38:14] Matthew 18 30. oh that is so hard to
[1:38:18] leave that one
[1:38:19] uh John 18. let me just at least read
[1:38:23] this I want to bring bring a a thought
[1:38:25] to you here
[1:38:27] Matthew 18 37 pilate therefore said unto
[1:38:31] Jesus art thou a a kingdom and Jesus
[1:38:36] answered thou says that I I'm a king to
[1:38:39] this and was I born for this cause came
[1:38:41] into the world that I should bear
[1:38:42] witness of the truth now notice the next
[1:38:44] sentence
[1:38:46] everyone that is of Truth
[1:38:49] heareth my voice
[1:38:53] if I know God's word says something and
[1:38:56] I'm not doing it all's I'm doing is
[1:38:58] declaring that I am not of Truth
[1:39:01] and that is scary
[1:39:05] but if I am of Truth
[1:39:08] I will hear that voice and I will bring
[1:39:11] this body under subjection and I will
[1:39:13] follow that word
[1:39:15] because he's leading us to Restoration
[1:39:18] do you believe that my sheep hear my
[1:39:20] voice I know them and they follow me all
[1:39:23] right relax
[1:39:24] just a moment I want to read this
[1:39:27] uh quote out of the message leadership
[1:39:31] Bible says but he refused to be guided
[1:39:34] speaking of the Rich Young Ruler he
[1:39:36] refused to accept the real leadership of
[1:39:39] Jesus Christ to give him
[1:39:41] eternal life
[1:39:42] the other leaders now this is important
[1:39:45] the other leaders that had been in his
[1:39:47] youthful days
[1:39:50] had such an influence on him
[1:39:54] till he refused to accept God's provided
[1:39:58] way which was Jesus Christ now the other
[1:40:01] leaders you see they had such a hold on
[1:40:05] him
[1:40:06] their people is taught well we belong to
[1:40:09] this and we belong to that and had such
[1:40:12] a hold on him
[1:40:13] but what a fatal thing to reject
[1:40:17] the leadership of eternal life
[1:40:21] now that life is present tonight that's
[1:40:25] right
[1:40:25] the holy spirit is here
[1:40:28] which is Christ in spirit form the the
[1:40:31] Holy Spirit the anointing is here
[1:40:34] a little while and the world seeth me no
[1:40:37] more but you shall see me my sheep know
[1:40:40] my voice
[1:40:41] they know God
[1:40:44] but I'll be with you even in you to the
[1:40:46] consummation of the end of the world now
[1:40:47] Jesus alone listen to this Jesus alone
[1:40:50] can lead you to eternal life
[1:40:54] forget about following anybody but the
[1:40:57] word
[1:40:59] now you can follow Paul as he followeth
[1:41:02] Christ
[1:41:03] but you cannot follow a man
[1:41:07] you have to make sure you have to make
[1:41:10] sure it's the word being spoken through
[1:41:12] the man
[1:41:14] even if they're speaking the word if
[1:41:15] they're not living it stay away from it
[1:41:18] because eventually it's going to get you
[1:41:20] off
[1:41:22] so Jesus alone can lead you to an
[1:41:24] eternal life there's no church no
[1:41:26] denomination no preacher no priest no
[1:41:29] nothing else can lead you to it you must
[1:41:32] be led by him and only
[1:41:36] the only one that can lead you don't you
[1:41:39] love that I'm so glad God sent a prophet
[1:41:43] could you imagine him leading you out of
[1:41:45] his word
[1:41:49] I can't imagine
[1:41:51] but some people
[1:41:53] are being let out of the word and they
[1:41:56] don't think they're wrong
[1:41:58] that's not
[1:42:00] God could you imagine him leading you
[1:42:03] out of his word
[1:42:06] that's why every word's important
[1:42:08] now maybe you think I got the baptism of
[1:42:11] the Holy Ghost and I'm going to heaven
[1:42:13] that don't mean one thing
[1:42:15] that you're going to heaven no sir
[1:42:18] you can have the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:19] Ghost every day every hour in your life
[1:42:22] and still be lost and go to hell
[1:42:25] the Bible says so exactly right
[1:42:28] and when a man has been born again by
[1:42:30] the word of God
[1:42:33] there's a difference between a true
[1:42:35] birth
[1:42:36] and being baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:42:38] every day
[1:42:41] but when a man has been born again by
[1:42:43] the word of God predestined to eternal
[1:42:45] life called the elect
[1:42:48] it'll be word of God on top of word word
[1:42:52] on Word
[1:42:54] that's what our brother Mark was saying
[1:42:56] Wednesday
[1:42:59] what I'm looking at maybe you don't see
[1:43:03] that's why I'm here to try to tell you
[1:43:06] it's not because I don't love people
[1:43:09] it's because I do love people it's
[1:43:11] corrective
[1:43:13] when I see the slipping of the church
[1:43:15] going off see
[1:43:17] well we see we did this and we did that
[1:43:20] look around other over the church and
[1:43:23] see it just won't work
[1:43:27] then look here in the Bible and see it's
[1:43:30] got to be that way at the end the
[1:43:33] lukewarm laodicean Church age putting
[1:43:35] Jesus out the word
[1:43:37] putting the word out
[1:43:40] he ain't going to call no church he said
[1:43:43] as many as I love I rebuke and chasten
[1:43:47] I love that he's calling individuals
[1:43:49] taking the word and pounding on it
[1:43:52] telling you're wrong in it that's the
[1:43:55] reason I love you
[1:43:57] if you'll open the door and let me in
[1:44:00] I'll come in and I'll sup with you not a
[1:44:03] church he'd done been put out of that
[1:44:06] God's calling individuals I stand at the
[1:44:09] door and I knock If any man any person
[1:44:13] you see if you're ordained to see it
[1:44:18] you see if you're ordained to see it if
[1:44:22] you're not ordained to see it you won't
[1:44:23] see it said
[1:44:25] they have eyes to see but they can't see
[1:44:27] they have ears but they can't hear how
[1:44:28] thankful
[1:44:29] you should be Church
[1:44:32] how thankful you should be Church how
[1:44:34] you should straighten yourselves up from
[1:44:37] these things how you should be on fire
[1:44:39] for God
[1:44:43] that your eyes behold what you see in
[1:44:45] your ears here with the the things they
[1:44:48] see and the things they see leadership
[1:44:51] why did you come here tonight to hear
[1:44:54] the message like this I'm branded across
[1:44:57] the world by Churches as fanatic
[1:45:00] why did you come
[1:45:02] the Holy Spirit Led you here
[1:45:05] to listen
[1:45:07] to be circumcised
[1:45:09] to cut away the things of the world
[1:45:11] except the leadership of Jesus Christ or
[1:45:15] you'll perish as sure as the world
[1:45:18] that that
[1:45:19] that's
[1:45:21] our Our Shepherd
[1:45:23] our Good Shepherd
[1:45:25] who's trying to help us
[1:45:27] to get back to the word that we're part
[1:45:30] that were not fallen so it's up to all
[1:45:32] of us as we stand together as we stand
[1:45:34] together it's up to all of us
[1:45:39] to take time and evaluate which part of
[1:45:42] the word
[1:45:44] have we just let slip
[1:45:48] which part of the word have we not given
[1:45:51] much attention to
[1:45:54] which part
[1:45:56] have we not been following
[1:45:59] because this message following the word
[1:46:05] is man shall not live thy bread alone
[1:46:07] but by every word that proceedeth out
[1:46:10] the mouth of God
[1:46:11] now I'll say like this God is presented
[1:46:14] his word to us
[1:46:17] he's given us his will for our lives
[1:46:21] it's up to you to want God
[1:46:25] to
[1:46:26] bring the conviction
[1:46:29] to allow it to deal with you or
[1:46:33] to just leave church
[1:46:35] without that
[1:46:38] so as we go to the Lord we're going to
[1:46:40] just spend just a little bit of time
[1:46:42] praying I want you to be thinking about
[1:46:45] what God
[1:46:46] is trying to speak to you what is he
[1:46:50] wanting you to do
[1:46:51] because
[1:46:53] my sheep hear my voice
[1:46:55] and they follow me and I believe I do
[1:46:56] believe when we come to church God has
[1:46:58] something personal for every one of us
[1:46:59] amen I just believe that he's I don't
[1:47:03] know I don't know what's on your minds I
[1:47:05] don't know where you're at but I know
[1:47:07] God does
[1:47:08] and he's able to take this word and and
[1:47:12] deal with us let's if we could just see
[1:47:14] real quietly pleasing
[1:47:17] pleasing it's just maybe bow our heads
[1:47:19] for just a moment and
[1:47:22] close our eyes and just
[1:47:25] think on him
[1:47:37] maybe you've been running from something
[1:47:43] and it's it's time to stop running
[1:47:47] Just Surrender to him
[1:47:53] maybe you've been making excuses
[1:47:59] you heard from God today that he wants
[1:48:01] you to be faithful to him faithful to
[1:48:03] read the Bible
[1:48:04] faithful to get back to the tapes
[1:48:08] faithful to start supporting the
[1:48:10] ministry
[1:48:11] [Music]
[1:48:13] maybe maybe we've gotten away from
[1:48:15] prayer
[1:48:18] praying one for another
[1:48:19] thank you
[1:48:22] maybe we just been confused
[1:48:25] by so many commit or see things going on
[1:48:31] you hear God calling you back
[1:48:33] [Music]
[1:48:38] maybe you haven't been wanting to lay
[1:48:40] down in Green Pastures
[1:48:45] you
[1:48:46] you feel him
[1:48:49] wanting to make you to lay down Green
[1:48:51] Pastures today
[1:48:54] friend
[1:48:58] um I don't know what God's been speaking
[1:49:01] to you
[1:49:01] [Music]
[1:49:05] my advice to you is take heed to what he
[1:49:09] has spoken say yes Lord I I Surrender it
[1:49:14] to you I I I give you my will I I will
[1:49:19] walk in your word I will take your word

[1:50:28] you that they've been in the palm of
[1:50:30] your hand but Lord through that time

[1:50:38] Amazing Grace says it was your grace
[1:50:40] that taught our Heart To Fear
[1:50:44] and it's your grace that brought us out
[1:50:48] from that fear
[1:50:50] you brought us too many dangers many
[1:50:53] toils you set our feet upon a rock
[1:50:57] and God here we've subjected ourselves
