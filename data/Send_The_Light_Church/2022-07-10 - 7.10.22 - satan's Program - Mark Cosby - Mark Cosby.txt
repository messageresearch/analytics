jesus such a blessing to be in the house of god once again how many has come hungry and prepared amen well thank you guys for all being here and uh it's a pleasure to be here once again in the name of the lord jesus christ and let's continue to lift up those who are sick and afflicted who want to be here and can't and let's just feed on the word today we gotta turn our bibles into genesis chapter three verse one probably very familiar scripture and when you get there say amen and get there myself so start off in verse 1 take our reading now the serpent was more susceptible than any beast of the field which the lord god had made and he said unto the woman yea hath god said he shall not eat of every tree of the garden verse 2 and the woman said unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden for the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said ye shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it lest ye die and the serpent said unto the woman you shall not surely die for god doth know that in the day you eat thereof then your eyes shall be open you shall be as gods knowing good and evil verse 6 and the woman saw that the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes in a tree to be desired to make one wise she took of the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also unto her husband with her and he did eat and the eyes of them both were open and they knew that they were naked and they threw fig leaves together and made themselves aprons and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord god amongst the trees of the garden and the lord god called unto adam and said unto him where art thou and he said i heard that voice in the garden and i was afraid because i was naked and i hid myself and he said who told thee that thou was naked has thou eaten of the tree wherefore i commanded it commanded thee that thou shouldest not eat and the man said the woman whom thou gave us to be with she gave me the tree and i did eat and the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou hast done and the woman said the serpent begot me and i did eat let's bow our heads before receded o lord jesus uh you're such a mighty god and we just thank you lord just for letting us be here lord another time just to to fellowship with you lord we don't come here to fellowship with one another when we come here primarily lord to this fellowship with you i pray you send your spirit lord and let us have such sweet communion with you lord let us come away closer to you lord let us come hungry your lord let us come more desperate lord for you and lord these scriptures as we read them lord i pray that you send your holy spirit lord and you bring them to life lord because only you can bring life to this word lord i pray each quote to life lord and i pray you just direct the service how you would feel to go lord we just want you to have control of every spirit and we give you control of ourselves lord and just have your preeminence lord from the beginning of servant to the end of the service and we love you and thank you and have your wonderful most precious way in jesus christ's name we pray amen may be seated so wednesday night we uh talked about god's program and how it's important if you have not received the seal of the holy spirit you need to receive it that's the only way you can get in god's program to be born again and filled with the holy spirit the baptism of the holy ghost and today we want to talk about satan's program satan's program is a counterfeit of god's program and he wants he wants you to take this program instead of god's program because if you get into god's program then you're in that holy ghost channel but the thing is when you get into god's program satan's still going to try to distract you with whatever whatever you can family uh your work uh things are on the house you name it he wants to distract you so uh as i was reading i think it was yesterday i was just noticing in verse six of uh genesis chapter three when he said uh and the woman saw the tree was good for food and it was pleasant to the eyes see what drew with the thing with drew her in that tree was it was all carnal things it was things that stimulated her flesh it tasted good it looked it good but in reality she didn't realize the consequences that it was going to have in the short term and long-term futures a lot of times we make decisions hastily and we don't take time to pray about it and we start reaping the consequences the scripture says you reap what you sow so it's so important to every decision that you make go about it prayerfully use wisdom pray for wisdom even says in james to pray for a wisdom if you lack wisdom if you have wisdom pray for more wisdom so in this day and age this is the hardest age to live in because we have all these things at our fingertips we have uh phones computers techno all these things we have to try to make our lives easier what it's doing is making our lives lazier that's what it's doing so we'll keep going that scripture and and make one wise so it made her wise but not not the wisdom that comes from above it didn't make her that kind of that kind of wise it made a worldly wisdom and that's what satan is trying to get us to have is worldly wisdom because worldly wisdom likes to put says i know how to do everything if we have that kind of spirit god cannot teach you anything as we said on wednesday so we think about this satan's test program started in heaven he used it to deceive a third of the angels and the enemy he's cunning and crafty and today we want to expose the enemy because he needs to be exposed if we never expose him to how we're going to recognize them you need to study your enemy you need to recognize paul said we're not ignorant of satan's devices so in order for you to be aware of his devices you have to be in the spirit constantly if you're not in the spirit then satan has you in his trap already so he painted such a pretty picture to the angels and to eve it looks so good it's like a pain in fire it looks so good but in reality it's not going to do anything for you but cause death so if he can get you if satan can get you to reason and to make you think that he has something better for you to offer then he has you in his trap every time so satan is kind of constantly trying to sell you a a better life but in reality is this death and the more we can come to that realization that all he has for you is death the quicker we can get back to god's program and stay there so satan makes this program look so good it's like one of those contracts that looks like it will benefit you but in a real fine print there's many things that will harm you in the long run see satan never mentioned eve the consequences of making the decision and when he tries to tempt us he will use those same tactics to appeal the flesh he's using those same tactics to appeal to your flesh and my flesh it's no different just a different age he's going to use different tools but the same result is going to have in your life now satan's program caused that the begin at the beginning then guess what is going to keep causing death to mankind and the the thing what i don't understand why we keep doing is we keep trying to feed off of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil when god says it brings death we need to be feeding off the tree of life god is calling us to be back how we used to before the fall so why don't why are we not feeding more on the tree of of life it's going to bring life see god wants to restore you but he's not going to force himself upon you you have to make that decision to feed off the tree of life see eve she had a a decision she had an option she had a choice satan never forced her to make that choice she made that choice so each day that we wake up we have a choice whether we feed on the tree of life or the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and if you feed on that tree of knowledge good and evil you will lose the battle for today you can have a victorious life every day but what are you willing to put in to achieve that victorious life so the thing the devil has been so with the way to study them the devil has many years working on this program since the since the garden of eden he's been working on his program constantly trying to fine tune it and the thing is if we can realize that he satan knows your weaknesses so if you if you get from underneath the power of god then guess what he has you so we constantly have to stay connected in that vein of the holy ghost channel we constantly have to stay connected with each other to build one another to lift one another up that that's how the if we can do that then this chord will be gone then division will be gone a lot of times we have discord and division because we're not connected to one another and we assume things so here's some tools of the devil death destruction confusion discord and idleness things that he will not tell you about but you'll be doing them and not realizing it and we all realize the devil's kingdom is not divided if any kingdom is divided then it's going to fall and we'll read that in matthew 12. so it may look like satan is all over here and there but that's that's his his motive that's his goal is to get people divided and he's working together with his demons to get people divided matthew 12. i'll go with 25-26 so it says we'll pick up and jesus knew their thoughts and said unto him every kingdom divided against itself is brought to desolation and every city or house divided against itself shall not stand so we as the body of christ need to stand together we need to come together in the unity of our lord and savior jesus christ if we want to stand and if satan cast out satan he is divided against himself how should that his kingdom stand and if i buy beelzebub cast out devils by whom do your children cast them out therefore shall they be your judges but if i cast out devils by the spirit of god then the kingdom of god is come unto you amen so the devil wants to pervert what god has created for good that's his motive he hates the very fact of what god does and he wanted to be like god and he realized that he couldn't so now he's trying to take everybody with him that he can so don't let him take you don't let him distract you like he distract eve because even adam was the son of god made perfect and he had that choice god didn't force to make their choice but he made that choice to listen to his wife and you have the choice whether you want to listen to satan or not you kick kick the enemy out of your mind don't don't let your mind be a devil's playground so that's his motive he wants to give you counterfeit and now as we said if you go to the bank and give them counterfeit money they will not receive it no matter how bad you beg and plead well i got this from somewhere they can't accept it because it's counterfeit and god is not going to accept a counterfeit relationship he's not god is looking for he in fact he refuses to accept it he's not going to accept your lukewarm relationship and neither is he going to accept my do not take the easy street take the straight and narrow any other way than through him is a false way we have we have come too far to give god not our best he deserves our best every day he deserves your best and my best no matter how you're feeling or what you're going through he deserves your best in fact i believe the the growth really happens when we don't feel like serving them that's when you press in because we said last week it's easy to press in when you have all the extra time in the world when you have you're on vacation that's the easiest time to do it but when everything's falling apart the walls the building the the tire blew up if you can still praise him and worship him see praise and worship isn't just lifting your hands as we said it's a life that you live that's praise and worship let's go to matthew 7 a couple pages over very familiar scripture we uh read verse 21 to 23 but we're going to read 13-14 in matthew 7. so it says enter ye in at the straight gate straight gate for wide is the gate and broad is the way that lead to destruction see the broad way it feels good to your flesh it looks good every man's right in his own eyes right but the broad way is going to lead to death and destruction and may there be what's going there at because straight is the gate and narrow is the way and check this out which leadeth unto life and few there be that find it so it shows me i need to be constantly looking the way that i'm going i can't assume that i'm going to straighten there away i need to be constantly checking my motives daily i need to be looking and what direction am i going what is my purpose in this life am i just living life or am i actually doing the purpose that the lord has called me to go so let's keep going praise god let's go to proverbs 14 12. we just read that we'll read it again 14 12. there is a way which seemeth right unto a man but the end thereof are the ways of death so there's many people that are going to go the the broad way the wide way and they thought that it was a good way they thought of it they they probably were even reading the word every day and praying but in reality it led to death so there's going to be many good people in hell there's going to be many so-called christians in hell there's going to be many people that had good intentions to be a christian but just good good intentions alone will not get the job done because you can have a good idea but never manifest that idea so the thing is don't wait until tomorrow your life's a vapor praise god so revelations chapter three so we're living in a laodicean age one of the hardest ages to overcome but not impossible there's if we're going through god nothing's impossible it all depends your attitude your attitude is so important if you want to have an overcoming an overcoming life your attitude is either going to cause you to succeed or to fail so let's go to chapter 3 verse 14. unto the angel of the church of the lay of the saints write these things saith the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of god i know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot i would that were cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot i will spew thee out of my mouth because thou says i am rich and increased with goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou are wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked so if you wake up and do not crucify your flesh you said you you are saying you are in need of nothing you're good to go i'm good i'm good to go lord for the day i don't need you today that's what you're saying i'm not trying to me but that's what you're saying thou wretched and miserable poor blind and naked if you saw me on the street and i was naked you would want to say something to me right so why are we walking around naked without the lord each day we choose not to crucify our flesh that's what you're doing you're walking around naked and you're blind you don't even know it i counseled you to buy of me gold tried in the fire he's called he's counseling us that thou mayest be rich and white and remnant that thou mayest be clothed and at the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thy eyes with eyes said thou may see verse 19 as many as i love i rebuke and chase and he says be zealous therefore and repent so repentance every day is a key don't just wait to the end of the day but repent throughout the day because we're constantly making mistakes we're constantly doing things we shouldn't be doing and we need to be repenting on a daily basis don't just say i'm gonna repent on sunday and then i'm gonna wait until next sunday it doesn't work that way verse 20. so right now he's standing at the door behold i stay at the door and knock if any man hear my voice any man he doesn't he doesn't say just a jews a gentile he doesn't say it's the jews just brother ron or the sister laurie but anyone open the door and i will come into him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh allah grant to sit with me in my throne even as i also overcame and set down with my father in his throne verse 22 is so key he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit is saying to the churches let's go to matthew 11. i noticed jesus mentioned that a lot of times you know in this in the gospel about heath that hath an ear so we have to have ears we have to pray lord give me ears to hear because our carnal ears is not going to get the job done we need spiritual ears to be able to hear god's word so verse 11 uh sorry matthew 11 verse and from the days of the john the baptist until now the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force for all the prophets and all the law prophesied until john and if you will receive it this is lies i'm so glad that he sent elias in this day and age was for to come and check this out and he that hath ears to hear let them hear so god is speaking to us right now but if we're not in the right spiritual state then we can't receive it so as i said on wednesday it's so important every time the door is open you need to constantly be preparing your heart so that ground can be that good ground as jesus spoke of in matthew chapter 13 because the good ground is the only ground that fruit's going to produce every other ground the cares of life choke the word out the thorns choked it choked it out so we can't let our busy lives choke the word of god out in our life so we'll go to matthew 13 a couple uh scriptures over and we're going to see jesus say this again talking about ears so in verse 9 it says who hath ears to hear let him hear and the disciples came and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in parables and he answered and said to them because it is given unto you it's given to you to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven but to them it is not given for whosoever hath to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever hath not from him shall be taken away even that he hath verse 13 therefore speak out of them in parables because they seeing see not in hearing they hear not neither do they understand and in them is fulfilled the prophecy of isaias which saith by hearing ye shall hear and shall not understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive for the people's heart is wax gross and their ears are dull of hearing in their eyes they have clothes at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and should understand with their heart and should be converted look at that converted again and i should heal them but blessed are your eyes for they see in your ears for they hear verse 17 for verily i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desire to see those things which you see check that out many prophets and righteous men so why are we just coming to church and plopping in the sea why are we doing that many many people in the bible want to see these things that we see we're coming to the closing of the age we're coming to the close to the rapture so why are we lazy why are we just limping to the finish line we should be finishing strong jesus said he that endureth unto the end not he that endured to the beginning you got to hold steadfast your confidence from the beginning to the end you got to be pressing into the kingdom of god daily fighting every inch every mile putting the full armor of god on that's the only way you're going to win this battle if you going to war we said wednesday and you're not properly uh fitted with the right attire you're going to lose you've got to follow the chief captain's orders on a daily basis he's given us orders he's given us commandments and we have to follow them don't don't just pick a day to take off i'm gonna take wednesday i'm gonna take thursday off but no work hard seven days a week that's what's gonna get your results but rarely i say unto you that many prophets and righteous men have desired to see those things which you see and have not seen them and to hear those things which you hear and have not heard them praise god so we talked about god has a program and he created before the foundation in the world he knew that mankind was going to fall and the program he's given to us is to restore you so he can use you and satan has a program in this to bring you like we said before undercover death the program that satan has is that stimulates your carnal flesh to give you entertainment to get you to follow most of the work that's the dangerous part but not all of it just like he did to eve eve could say i followed most of god's word but god didn't call us to follow most of the word he's called us to follow all of the word so like it's not a math test it's not a gpa a 3.9.999 we need a 4.0 gpa every time all a's so he wants to he wants you to enjoy the pleasure of sin for a season in fact moses in his uh commentary he didn't want to he didn't choose his pleasures of sin for a season he chose the reproaches of god he chose the harder way because he knew that the sin for a season would only last for a season and then his destination would be hell but he knew that if he went god's provided way it was the right way it may have been the harder way but it was the way that's going to be worth it in the end of your life because in any if you take satan's way you may be rich maybe famous but when you come into god's judgment throne you can't say well god i live the best life you know i i gave to the poor sometimes but that's not going to matter we read in first corinthians 13 you can give to the poor your body can be burned but if you have not charity you can't even enter in the king you can't even enter in as our prophet said so notice in the garden what we said before there is some it's consequences eve made a decision and it directly impacted you and me to the future years and each decision that you make today is going to affect your family it's going to affect the body of christ here so it's so important when you're making a decision don't just make it willy-nilly you think about it you write it down write the pros and cons of it you pray about it most importantly so he painted eve a picture and the thing is it was how good it was to partake from the tree he painted such a good picture that tree just he he advertised it to her he blew it up how good it was you could be as guys knowing good and evil and she was eating it up but the thing is he's still doing the same thing today he's still trying to how he's still trying to portray how good this tree is it's going to get you fame it's going to get you fortune you have a high position in the church everybody can look at you and if it sounds all good to the flesh but what it's doing is is feeding your pride and god hates pride he hates a proud look god is a million miles away from pride and pride comes from the devil so i don't want to be anywhere the devil is i don't want to be like him not even one iota amen so the thing is a lot of times we keep making these same decisions and they the same outcome failure we have to stop making the same decisions and we have to rethink what we're thinking because god is trying to change the way we think he says my ways are not your ways and my thoughts are not your thoughts so not every thought you think is you're thinking like god that's why you have to try that thought it says in john 1 john 4 1. so each day you have a choice of what program you follow are you following after the spirit or are you following after the flesh it's one of the others not in between not mixed it's one thing to know that satan has a program it's one thing and it's good to know that but if you're still going this program then what's the point of even knowing that information so it's like you know you have a math test but you didn't take any time to study it you're gonna fail most of the time you might get lucky but i'm not here for luck i'm here but we're here for we're here to receive what god has for us let's go to first peter chapter five man time flies first peter 5. and we'll start reverse five likewise younger submit yourselves unto the elder so not just it's talking about me but yeah all of you be subject one children so it's calling all of us to be subject in one to another so younger older in between and be clothed with humility for god resisted the proud so it's so important humility if you want to get somewhere with god a humble and contrite spirit in no wise will despise god is looking for a vessel that will lay down before his feet and say lord use me lord i'm here for you and only you whatever your will be for my life let it be and verse six says humble yourselves so you have to humble yourself not not brother john not sister and they can't humble yourself you have to humble yourself therefore under the mighty hand of god and he may exalt you into time he's going to exalt you in due time don't exalt yourself exalt him says casting all your care upon him for he careth for you so it says be so be sober and be vigilant i look the word up sober is regular calm not under the influence of passion as sober judge judgment so when you're sober you know when somebody is drunk they're not they're not sober under the influence they they see things in a different way they're distracted so when you're drunk on the things of satan you're not going to be able to see things in your life things are going to slip the marker is going to get moved and you may not recognize it right away but in the end what it's going to do to you is going to cause big destruction and you're going to be going down a broad way and that's why the scripture is telling us to be sober and he says vigilant i watched i looked that word up as well it says watchful circumspect a tentative to discover and avoid danger so when you're sober and vigilant you're constantly going to be looking for the things of satan because satan has devices hey ben can you wake luke up for me shouldn't be sleeping in church gotta be awake so you're sober and vigilant so like i said before you're constantly looking you're constantly watching looking around corners because you know your enemy is cunning and crafting and he's smarter than you but when you're sober and vigilant you're in the spirit and god's gonna let think you can you could see things that normally you wouldn't see with your own carnal eyes because the current lie we don't serve god by carnality we serve them in the spirit cardinality would only get you to be a nominal christian they go to church wednesdays and sundays but that word is not lived out they just they just slap their name on the book so let's just keep going so notice it says casting all your cares upon him and the thing is if you don't cast all your cares upon him then the cares of this life will eat you up and your walk with god will be choked out and you won't have a walk so that's why even jesus said in matthew 11. come on come on to me all you they're heavy late and i will give you rest and notice he wants to give you rest of the soul if we don't have rest of the soul we can't have a walk because because god is trying to restore what's in here he didn't come to save these bodies we have a body waiting for us that's not that's not corrupted it's perfect and we're gonna be just like him but until that time that space we have work to do there's things that we need to be doing in this in this life like i said before we have a church body we need to be connecting there's lost sheep out there we need to be witnessing to and your life is going to do so much more than you cramming scriptures down somebody's throat your life should prove what you are you should be a living epistle as paul said that's how you're going to win somebody over the love of god should be ready got radiating out of you on a daily basis as brother boaz said you're that revival you bring that revival to somebody you bring life to somebody i remember the disciples they wanted to uh cast uh didn't elias cast fire down he said i didn't come to destroy men's lives i come to save them so we had that same authority through jesus christ to save lives you can create love in a situation create peace create happiness a soft answer turneth away wrath it's not you that's saying it but the holy ghost through you that's doing it but if you're not connected to the holy ghost and it's you and you're going to cause death in somebody's life so a big part of satan's program is to get you distracted that's what he wants to do to distract you any way he can it could be the cares of life to put little to no effort in or to make you so busy that you don't have time for anything or just to get through or go through the motions well i'm gonna go on my knees and pray tonight about about 10 minutes i give god at least 10 minutes it's better than zero minutes i'm gonna read once i'm gonna read one chapter in my bible today and i'm gonna read it i'm doing my christian duties i'm a good i'm a good christian good message believer no can't be doing that it'd be better for you not to do it at all like i said like i said on wednesday you get on your knees don't make a time limit just say lord i'm here when you're reading the word lord where would you want me to read that lord please bring this word to life i don't want to just read this and forget about it as i go my day i want this word that i read i want to bring it to life and then finish uh the scripture we'll go to verse 9 or verse 8. be sober and be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking whom he may devour the devil wants to devour you he wants to put destruction discord in your life so we said before if you're not sober and vigilant then he's gonna have a field day in your life he's gonna take spit you up and keep doing it verse 10 or verse nine whom resists steadfast in the faith knowing the same afflictions are accomplishing your brother and the world he's doing it not just in your life my everybody's life he's trying to do it in he's trying to start each one of us well if we can unite together i say prayer is so key if you want to defeat satan prayer is so key you need prayer you have to it says draw an eye to god and he'll draw an eye to you go to romans 7 14. actually i think i missed something actually okay i mean one second all right let's go back to i'm sorry go back to first peter 5 10 is something i want to point out but the god of all grace who hath called us unto us eternal glory by christ jesus after you have suffered a while make you perfect establish strengthen and settle you so i was reading that so notice in order to be perfect established strengthen and settle you suffering is required you have to suffer in order for that that christ-like character to come out so if you want to be established you have to get in the presence of god it's going to cause pain to your flesh every time because your flesh doesn't want to take the time to spend time with god it wants just to you to open the bible and put it away so the thing is there must come it's the right kind of suffering the kind of suffering that's going to bring christ-like character brother branham said character is a victory god is not going to hand you in a silver platter here you go here's character but you have to fight every inch and every ground you notice in world war ii they had to fight for every inch and every ground and that's in the natural so what makes you thinking the spirits you want to fight for every inch and every ground because the greatest battle ever fought is inside your mind right now you have the decision either to accept what's being preached or to reject it and it's going to prove when you leave these doors it's going to prove if you were accepted or rejected it monday is going to prove are you going to just go about your daily business and forget all about god and then come back wednesday because right there you just proved to me that you rejected the word of god you choose who you serve today as for me me and my house we're going to serve the lord so go to romans 7. praise god romans 7. so constantly every day we have a war that's going inside of us daily counseling your spirit man and your colonel man are constantly clashing one another and whatever you feed there's a black dog and a white dog that's inside of you and whatever you're feeding on for that day is what's going to be is going to manifest that dog see that white dog is your spirit man jesus said watch and pray he said the spirit is willing but the flesh is weak so if you're feeding on the flesh and your spirit man is gonna be malnourished so if i don't eat i'm gonna be i'm gonna be malnourished if i don't eat in the spirit i'm gonna be spiritually malnourished so you gotta have a healthy spiritual diet you need to be listening to the tapes studying the tapes don't just put a tape on to listen to it but you take the time lord what are you trying to say to me through your prophet lord while i'm reading this word what are you trying to speak to me this is a love letter that's written back to me help me to receive that love letter write the laws upon my heart and upon my mind and that's how it has to be has to be that has to be that serious we can't just be barely skating by god didn't call you and fill you with the holy ghost for you is to skate by he's called you to live a victorious life that will win souls what's the talents that he's giving you how are you using them what are you using them for there's probably like sister cheryl said there's probably talents in this church that we're scared to use why are we scared you give it back to god and say lord let me use this gift this talent that you've given to me it's going to use it for the kingdom of god use it for the glory of god there's many people many artists music musicians who are using their talent for the satan and making money with it let us use our gifts and our talents and we think that gifts and talents are just singing you have a gift of help you can have you can be be a people person that's a wonderful way to win a soul get to paul said i became all things to all men that i might win some praise god i forgot where i was at set oh roman seven or yeah romans seven and go to 14. so it says for we know that the law is spiritual but i am carnal soul under sin i think if we would just come to realization that every day we'll realize that the law that i'm i'm carnal and i need to get into god's presence if i want to be effective in his kingdom for that which i do i allow not for that what i would that do i not but what i hate that do i so is that constant that's that battle he's trying to tell us that's going on if then i do that which i would not i can sit unto the law that is good now there is no more i that do it but sin that dwelt in me for i know that in me that is in my flesh dwelt no good thing see paul realized that in his flesh there's no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good i find not for the good that i would i do not but the evil i would not that i do now if i do that i would not it is no more i that do it but sin that dwell within me said i find the law that when i would do good evil is present with me for right here's the key right here frauds light in the law of god after the inward man if you try to do the if you try to do god's laws and commandments with the flesh you're going to fail every time we see in the bible the children of israel they failed every time god would have to send a judge a prophet to bring them back on things they would always go back in to their old carnal ways and the same thing with us if you're trying to serve god in the flesh the same thing is going to happen to you that's why do everything in the spirit pray in the spirit sing in the spirit do everything in the spirit verse 23 but i see another law in my members warning against the law of my mind bringing me into the captivity of the law of sin which is in my members verse 24 o wretched man that i am who shall deliver me from the body of this death i thank god through jesus christ our lord so with the law so with the so with the mind i myself serve the law of god both the flesh the law of sin and go to romans 8 verse 5 so for they that after the flesh do you mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit so verse 6 right here for to be carnally minded is death so each time you're in your carnal mindset death for is not subject to the law of god neither in indeed can be so we if you're in the flesh in church right now then you are harming the working of god in your life verse 8 so then they there in the flesh cannot please god you can't even please god even a man at his best is vanity think about that a dirty rag even the scripture says so you can be a good little message believer in the in carnality and do no no good in your life in fact you're further away from god than when you started actually verse 8 or verse 9 but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be it the spirit of god dwell within you now if any man have not the spirit of christ he is none of his amen let's keep going so your flesh and my flesh are the same they are lazy and want to go satan's program the easy street as we would say the way of least resistance right and so it's so important this little quota i think i made up i think but the more areas that you can be disciplined in the less chances you're being lazy in other areas so how you do anything is how you do everything so if you're a lazy businessman if you have a lazy prayer life lazy and all these kind of areas they're going to eventually trick over into your spiritual life so it's so important to make yourself disciplined and we'll read that in 2nd corinthians 10. second corinthians 10 verse 1. now i paul beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of christ who in the presence am i based among you but being absent and bold towards you but i beseech you but i beseech you that i may not be bold i am present with that confidence wherewith i think to be bold against some with some think of us as we walked according to the flesh verse three for though we walk in the flesh we do not war after the flesh we may be in his fleshly bodies but it gives us no green past to live in cardinality no green pass for the weapons of our warfare are not carnal but mighty through god to the pulling downs of strongholds in your strongholds says five casting down all imaginations and every high thing that exalted itself against the knowledge of god and bring it to captivity every thought every thought not just one here one there but every thought to the obedience of christ and having in readiness to revenge all disobedience when your obedience is fulfilled do you look on things after the outward appearance if any man trust to himself that he is christ let himself think this again that as he is a he is christ even so we are christ so this is from satan's eden uh 1965-829 then when he went to take a little rest his enemies slipped in with the seat and took it over by misinterpreting his program to his children so satan's trying to do the same thing in your life he's trying to get you to misinterpret god's word well god meant this but no when god says something he means it he doesn't need you to interpret it he doesn't need you to to try to put your own little twist around it now if we notice satan is always trying to improve his tactics you ever notice uh say you like this like a candy bar says new and improved recipe why do they mess it up because they usually mess the recipe up when they do that or even like a new and improved scent we have a new improved computer all these things see satan is constantly trying to evolve god doesn't need to evolve he says i change not so why are we always trying to go the way satan is trying to go see if you look at technology in the last 15 years satan has become an advertiser he's trying to push things down your throat he's trying to push his agenda we got lgb q t r z x y z and everything you see they're trying to push the agenda and say satan's behind it and the enemy has become a marketer nowadays for most companies to survive they have to use marketing and now satan has become an advertiser using billboards sex sales using women to sell things i was a kid i used to watch all kind of commercials like cereal commercials and that influences you to go to your parents like hey mom can i have this new cereal and that's what satan's trying to get you he's trying to influence you so you can influence someone else with his program that's what he's doing having a bad attitude you're causing somebody to be influenced by your attitude and that's satan behind that so basically satan is using your vessel to influence another vessel think about that so next time you have a bad attitude i want you to think about that so the carnal flesh will always want to gravitate to satan's program because the natures are the same so if you're in cardinality you're just like satan at that time think about that so we can see why jesus said we must crucify the flesh daily luke 9. i'm going 23-26 luke 9. so it says and he said to them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself that's the first thing you got to do and take up his cross daily so in order for you to take up your cross daily you have to deny yourself first before you even come to jesus christ for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake the same shall save it for what is a man advantage if he gain the whole world and lose himself or be a castaway for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and of my words of him shall a son of man be ashamed don't ever be ashamed for standing up for your convictions i don't care don't let any of your friends at work ever get you to let down your convictions you stand up for jesus and he'll stand up for you because people think is god isn't looking for mixers god's looking for separators from this world don't be like of the world because he said we're not of the world we're from a heavenly kingdom act like that live like that dress like a saint talk like a saint think like a saint walk like a saint amen for whosoever shall be ashamed of me and my words of him shall son of man be ashamed we shall come in his own glory and in his fathers and of the holy angels and go to mark i think mark 8 actually i believe mark 8. i think it's 34-38 so it's a similar so similar what jesus is saying it once again and when he called the people unto him with his disciples and he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever will lose his life for my sake in the gospels the same shall be saved for sure the profit of man if he gained the whole world and lose his own soul so you can have every nice car you want you can have a a 10 bedroom house you can even have we'll cut that out you can even have be popular amongst your co-workers and your people because that could be exchanging your soul this prosperity alone doesn't have to be this in financial it could be in friends it could be in trying to keep up with the joneses get that charging on the credit card even though you don't have the money to get that nice fancy car it could be anything what shall a man give you in exchange for his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and my words in this adulterous and sinful generation of him shall the son of man be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of the father with his holy angels amen let's keep now we see why brother branham said the greatest battle ever fought is in the mind satan is constantly trying to sell you his program in your mind trying to sugarcoat it to make it look appealing you have probably heard this quote before that mind is a terrible thing to waste what are you a question i'm gonna ask you don't answer it out loud please what are you wasting your mind on what kind of things are you thinking on that are harming your growth with the lord as a man think of so easy so when this when is this great battle started on earth there had to be mutual meeting place there had to be a place selected for the battle to begin and for the battle to rage and the battlegrounds begin in the human mind there is where the battle starts the human mind was chosen for this the place of the battle where it was begin and this is because the decisions are made from the mind the head now they never started from some organization they never started from some mechanical affair the grounds never started there therefore the organization can never do the work of god because the battlegrounds or if you got to meet your enemy is in the mind you got to make your choice it meets you so decisions are made in the head that's where satan meets you he's constantly trying to get you to look away from jesus christ he's constantly trying to get you to to still follow some of the word but not all of it and that's his program and what whose program are you working towards today the enemy wants you to to make you think you're always working towards god's program the enemy will get you so busy in this life that god's programs begin to slip from your mind that's his job is getting so busy and so distracted that god's put on the back burner but anything put before god is an idol i don't care what it is it could be your wife your husband a chair a car anything you put before god as an idol don't get distracted in this life by the pleasures of this life by your work by your job because at the end of the day it's all going to pass away what's done for jesus christ is the only thing that's going to last spend some extra time spend 20 minutes extra time in prayer spend 20 minutes studying the word of god spend 20 extra minutes listen to the message of the hour it's going to only benefit you it's going to grow that spiritual man inside of you just because you're busy does not always mean you're busy on the right things i've been there recently who must constantly check our motors on a daily basis why am i making myself so busy and find out is it just to get a financial freedom in this world i'm not saying it's not bad to have a little financial freedom but that's the only thing you're thinking about then you're as an idol see it's your mind that opens the door or closes the door and listens to your conscience listens to your memory listens to your affections but when your mind hallelujah closes itself to these things and let god the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of that stuff out praise god every feeling is gone there's nothing standing there but the word of god check this out and satan cannot battle against that i'm read that one more time one more time there is nothing there but the word of god and satan cannot battle against that no sir he can't battle against it now we know that's true my grandfather wrote an ox card just a quote my grandfather wrote an ox crap that i know of i'm driving a ford v8 my son will fly a jet plane that's they're moving on that's what religion ought to be the coming of the lord is at hand amen can i get amen the church ought to be moving on to their power uh onto in their powers science can only climb so far and then it has to drop off but we we got untapped sources that's never been touched of the power unlimited of god that we ought to be moving into we're living a million miles under our privilege tonight of privileges of christians to be enjoying i feel ashamed of myself when i look out here and see the institutions and the sicknesses and the trouble that's going on right now our church ought to be walking the street healing the sick raising the dead casting out devils doing signs and wonders making the whole world realize that jesus christ lives praise god that's what we need to be doing it all comes down to our attitude what kind of attitude do we have towards christ you're at the way you're living the conversations you're having at work is going to prove to me what your attitude is of jesus christ is he just your savior or is he your lord he wants to be both attitude is everything a bad attitude will get you deceived by the enemy the enemy's goal is to take away your strength and the only way he can do that is get you to disbelieve one percent of the word that's your strength and power right there and if he gets you to take that word from you then you are helpless and weak see the thing is to combat the enemy's program we must have the mind of christ every day let's go to philippians 2. and the mind of christ isn't something you just take out your closet and put on it's something that you have to strive for on a daily basis something you have to press into in prayer i'm gonna close here in a couple minutes philippians 2 verse 1 there be therefore any consolation in christ if any co any comfort of love any fellowship of the spirit of any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy they be like-minded having the same love being a one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory but in lowliness of mind let each other esteem better than themselves lifting once again up looking at every man of his own things but every man also in the things of others let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus amen who being in the form of god thought it not robbery to be equal with god but check this out but made himself of no reputation no reputation he wasn't trying to vaunt that he was i'm the son of god i'm jesus christ no but he came in the form as a servant and we have to serve one another we have to build one another go out and serve somebody in the world lift them up become all things to them that you might win them no reputation took the form of a servant was made in the likeness of men and being found in the fascism of a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto the even the death of the cross let us stand and read this last quote musicians can come up jesus gave us an example how to do it now we want to know how to overcome check this out amen jesus told us how to do it see check this out humility one more time jesus gave us an example how to do it now we want to know how to overcome jesus told us how to do it see humility gird himself took a towel and washed the disciples feet the very god of heaven humiliated himself we don't want to be humiliated that's the reason women don't want their hair to grow i'll see the reason they don't want to dress like ladies should you got men wearing tight clothes looking like a hot dog it's just it's so it's so perverted they want to dress like ladies should they don't want men to see the same thing they don't want to get humiliated but jesus constantly look who he was greatness i'm going to say something greatness humiliates itself great great humbles itself greatness i've had the privilege of getting meeting some great men and it's the guys that got a change of clothes and 50 cents in their pocket in toronto that's the guy who thinks he's something when he's nothing but i stood by great men i mean great men with ragged cuff sleeves they don't think you're the great person greatness is humility don't forget that church he's speaking to us right now greatness is expressed in humility not how fine you can be amen let's bow our heads lord we're just so thankful that you just send words that we need lord you just know how to speak to us lord and we're here today lord we thank you for just helping us to remember that satan has a program as well and is counseling to get us to look away from your program lord may we never look away from you lord i remember peter he was walking on the water and soon as he took his eyes off you he began to sink and lord we will be the same way if we take our eyes off for you lord we will begin to sink lord may we always keep our eyes on you no matter the circumstance the situation may we always feed from the the source of life which is you lord and lord we come here today united as one body lord lord we want to grow because you can do so you can do so many mighty things in this church if we just get connected with one another and most of all connected with you lord let us not forget the power of unity lord it's so powerful lord if we get a hold of the source we even touch the hem of your garments the things that you can do lord that lady that laid the blood issue made up in her mind that was the only way that was going to work if we get that made up on our minds lord the only way we can have you move in this church is to be united in prayer to be in one accord that's how things are going to happen in this church mighty things we've never experienced before things that we even can't even fathom and lord we don't we just we want your pouring just to pour out in our service lord just take control let your perfect will be done just lead this church the way you wanted to be led lord bless our pastor and his family all the laborers they did over the years just praying for things like this to happen lord i pray that it wouldn't just be a dream but it'll be a reality because they prayed it with faith and lord as we come here today lord we don't want to just hear a good sermon but lord we want to be not only hears but doers of your word let each individual who's the live stream in this service today let them go on to do this work let them after service not just think about what's for dinner or what's for lunch but let them think lord how can i manifest this word that you've spoken to me how can i make this a a reality and lord we want to thank you once again lord just for being here lord just help us i pray the coming days the enemy would love to come and destroy and kill but lord we won't be connected to you lord and once again we thank you and love you and ask all these things in your holy most precious name in jesus christ let me pray amen you'll be saying humble yourself humble yourself before your lord hand came give him your heart offer your everything [Music] there's no limit on the love he has [Music] yourself and see what god will do homeboy yourself and let him have his way love his word and his will obey his worship for his eyes are on the one whose heart is true

the power [Music] we've got the power in the name of jesus we've got the power in the name of the lord those satan rages we shall not be defeated we've got the power in the name of the lord lift it up if you got it we've got the powers in his name in the name of jesus [Music] we've got the power in the name of the lord though satan rage we shall not be defeated we've got the power in the name of the lord once again we've got the power in the name of jesus we've got the power in the name of the lord those saints and rages we shall not be defeated [Music] this is thinking about that song what brother branham said we live a million miles below our privilege we've got all the power we need when the tree is when the tree's planted has every seed that is every fruit is going to bear in that seed so god has prepared you but you have to get in the channel of the holy ghost he he's given you the authority and the power but you have to recognize it you have to use it the right way use it the way that he wants to so we sing that song once again just remember you have the power to change people's lives through jesus christ that's what god wants to use you that's what he's given the holy ghost back for not for our selfishness but for you to go restore somebody else he's giving you the ministry of reconciliation for a reason go out and use it for lost souls go out and use it on your
