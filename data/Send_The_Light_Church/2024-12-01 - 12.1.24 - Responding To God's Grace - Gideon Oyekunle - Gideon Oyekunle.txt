amen that from this place you know support should go you know all over the world not just only in Nigeria but all over the world is a great thing that you have done the prophet of the almighty God said you know that the reward shall be shared together in glory am so we look forward to that great time when we shall receive our reward and we believe you know that by the grace of God we will not lose our reward God bless you amen let's read The Word of Life Romans chapter 7 and Romans chapter 6 I will read Romans chapter 6 first and and then I will read chapter 7 Romans chapter 6 from verse 1 to 4 what shall we say then shall we continue in saying that Grace May abound God forbid how shall we that we that are dead to sin live any longer daring God know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of Life Romans 7 know ye not brethren for I speak to them that know the law how that the law had dominion over a man as long as he liveth for the woman which ha an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead CH is losed from the law of her husband so then if why her husband leaveth she be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man wherefore my brethren you also have become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh theem motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were heard that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in the Hess of the letter and may the Lord bless the reading of his holy word amen God bless you may be seated in this morning we want to speak on the subject of uh responding to God's Saving Grace responding to God's Saving Grace amen uh this morning you know I think you know the Tabernacle the church at home should be with us under the service only that uh we may not we will not be able to see them amen but I think you know they are with us this morning and some people you know that are connected to the service so we want to greet every one of you this morning that are with us amen so here we are at uh uh Fenton uh Michigan uh sendal light family church amen so we want to say that God bless you all all right they are him amen so and uh we want to say you know that God bless all the saints amen so only thatth we cannot get connected to see them but they are watching amen God bless you so God bless you all the saints amen so we are speaking this morning on the subject of responding you know to God's Saving Grace Hallelujah and you know we could not you know talk about it all because it's much amen just like what Apostle Paul said you know over then the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 9:1 15 it said thanks be to God for his unspeakable gift amen so you know they are too many Hallelujah but we want to call our attention Amen to something you know that is very important and what is it Grace Hallelujah Grace amen you know uh the prophet of God told us you know the story story of the conversion of DW Moody brother Braham told us how that woman you know was a wash woman and then you know she washed she had an inspiration you know to get something done for the Lord and then you know she washed to save you know some some some some some money and then when she has saved those the the money then she invited the preacher to come and hold a meeting and then when the preacher came for the meeting then you know nobody came but God in his Divine Mercy has ordained that somebody will come to the meeting that you know the labor of this little woman will not be in vain and then you know what happened God you know inspired you know somebody an insignificant person amen you know but predestinated and ordained before the foundation of the world with a message you know to generation to his people remember that each day ends a generation today a generation is ending tomorrow a generation will end and every one of us we are messenger of this message Hallelujah therefore if we are messengers of this message then I can tell you my brothers and sisters in this morning that you have a message Hallelujah for you can never be a messenger without a message message and if you have a message you will have some audience to listen to it Hallelujah you will have some audience to hear your voice because it is not your voice but it is the voice of him who sent you amen hallelujah and the God sent you here on Earth Hallelujah for a purpose amen and the purpose of God can never be defeated Hallelujah you will serve that purpose that God has Ed D you foren Hallelujah and the prophet of God said No Death nothing can hurt you until you serve God's purpose Hallelujah and then when you have served God's purpose then you go to your reward Hallelujah so therefore you know this man D Moody came into the meeting and then when he got into the meeting then you know the preacher preached and this young Dwight Moody overed his life that day you know to the Lord Jesus Christ and when he hovered his life to the Lord Jesus Christ can you just imagine all the labor that this woman has ever done it was only one Hallelujah just because of one and then you know he hovered his life onto girl and became a great servant of God a great missionary Hallelujah and the true Dwight Mist Foundation Hallelujah an Institute then millions of souls were W on to God why the woman did it hallelujah oh glory to God what if that woman has not done it that woman did it Hallelujah and then may I tell you this morning church little is much if God is in it Hallelujah little is much if God is in there the little little thing that we do for God it matters Hallelujah it can never go unrewarded it matters it will go a long way to serve somebody to get somebody you know back you know with to God Hallelujah to turn somebody Oh Glory to God Amen and then you know friends it will happen that day that if you had not gone I wouldn't be here if that woman you know had not done that that M would not be saved then true Hallelujah but brothers that woman did it and then God used her Hallelujah to save Dwight Moody and the Dwight Moody you know turn several Millions Hallelujah onto God oh what a great dividend hallelujah what a great dividend yes it is amen it's a great inment yes I don't know any business you know greater than the business of the Gospel amen the business of the Cross hallelujah hallelujah for a s safe is worth more than 10,000 word Glory Hallelujah can't you see brothers and sisters you know that I'm sorry but I want to say this not to bring down anybody the president of the best world of the best country in the world United States right you know if you are a soul winner you are occupying and offies that's greater than that Hallelujah why because you are saving a soul and you have a soul Sav and the soul save is better than 10,000 word hallelujah the whole word the whole world Hallelujah 10,000 word is amazing yes it what a great business and there what a great dividend you know that for this woman to pull a little ever into the kingdom of God and to you know to to to draw the dividend of this in vement Hallelujah and the one day dght Moody was you know right there in his office and was studying the word of God Amen and then you know he came you know to the Book of Romans chapter 7 and when he read the book of Romans chapter 7 you know what an inspiration you know it was to Young Moody amen he read it and he saw what Apostle Paul said how we were separated Glory amen we were separated amen from law amen onto grace through the death of our Lord Jesus Christ how you know we became separated you know from our former husband Hallelujah and then you know we were married you know to the new husband actually not a separation you know but it's a separation also because death means separation and the death is a total separation ation and the year Apostle Paul was showing how you know that we become you know separated by death amen you know from The Works of the flesh from the things of the world from the things that once rule over us you know onto the other side amen God in his infinite grace and mercy called you and high out of the world and then you know in death with our former husband our first husband God dealt with it by death Hallelujah God killed it at the cross Hallelujah he bruised the head of the serpent at the cross Hallelujah he bruised the head of the serpent the root of sin God bruised it he killed it right there at the cross for the Bible said in the Book of Genesis chter 3:15 that shall bruised Hallelujah the head of The Serpent and the serpent will bruise his ear that's the reason why you know the devil you know he cannot kill Christ and make him to remain in the grave Jesus said I have power to lay down my life and to take it up again Hallelujah and then you know that was at the cross Genesis 3:15 the seed of the woman Hallelujah bruise the head of the serpent the serpent bruis his heill amen when he died but brother he rose again for he is the head of the body the church Hallelujah and he said because I live ye shall live also amen and the brothers the death of Christ is a pointer Amen to what you know God intended to do Hallelujah because it could have been you it could have been me but friends he took your place and my place Hallelujah and when he took your place and my place then brothers and sisters what happened we become the righteousness of God for the Bible says he was made sin for us hallelujah he did not become sinner but he became sin Hallelujah he took our peny our punishment upon himself to God be the glory for for ever Oh Glory Hallelujah M par me please hallelujah praise the Lord I feel good I feel good the Pastor said take your Liberty amen and I feel good friends I have the Liberty this morning hallelujah hallelujah it's like my home church amen Hallelujah God bless you so therefore you know we become the righteousness of God Amen so we are the righteousness of God Amen right now amen we he took our place we become his righteousness for he became sin for us amen and the brothers and sisters death has occur and the went M him when he saw and understand what what it means to be saved by grace he saw what it is what it was what Christ of God has done is struck him he forget about himself he forget about his unworthiness he forget about whatever he has ever done and I tell you this morning friends don't look down on yourself don't look at whatever you have done don't look at your action or your reaction in the past amen you don't have to look at that for God doesn't look at what you have done what God is looking at the prophet of the almighty God said God did not even see you what God sees he sees amen you white as no for God looked down on you through the blood of Jesus Christ and the if you sin be as red as Crimson or as Scarlet they shall be white as snow Hallelujah why because God had a spectacle amen God has a glasses amen through which he can look down on a repentant Sinner and then you

amazing wo Amazing Grace it's amazing grace that is amazing God's prophet of God's Prophet told us one day of the story of a guy this guy got so nervous and what did he do he killed a boy and that boy was the King's son and they got him arrested for killing the King's son and he must be executed he must be killed for that heinous crime for that was the only son of the king and then when the king came riding in his Chariot he stopped over there he looked at him said come on why did you kill my son you kill my son the King's son and he was humble and he said I'm sorry your majesty it's my Hunger just came over me and I lost the control cannot hold myself I killed your son oh king and the King looked at him ought to die said but come on your sins are forgiven you are pardoned come over here and ride with me in my Chariot and he turned around to The Record Keeper destroy the record destroy the record for he has become in the stead of my son that he has killed and that that is the grace of God upon your life the grace of God upon my life we killed the King's son our sin killed him our hanger killed him our sin killed him our sicknesses killed the King's son hallelujah oh Brothers for he was wounded for our transgression bruised for our iniquity the chastisements of our peace was upon him and by is right we are you amen hallelujah I tell you this morning church the King's son has died for you and I amen he has taken your place he has taken my place amen and the brothers the record were against us there was an unting against us burn in sin shap in iniquity come to the word speaking lie deserve of fa Hallelujah but Brothers the king in his divine mercy and Grace has given you pardon and the prophet said pardon means a release from guilt Hallelujah that you are pardoned you have been released you know from your guilt You Killed The King's son but you are pardoned tonight you are pardon this morning you are free this morning you are coming home to rise in The Chariot Hallelujah with the king so that you become in the stad of the king son forever hallelujah oh my God I feel so good this morning amen you are pardoned release from guilt you have been discharged and acquitted amen discharged and acquitted amen you never never done it in the first place Hallelujah and the prophet said that's the meaning of the word Justified Justified you never done it in the first place that's justification if brother Ron you saw Brother Martin is right there in the church right everybody here BR Martin BR Joe Martin is right here in the church right and I'm here right and then you know if after the service maybe an heavier agent came and he said so one of you Brethren right that you were in Los angelist at this so so time the exact time that you were in the church and that you did so so cry and we are here witnesses that you never done it but it was proved Beyond any reasonable doubt after you have been accused that you never done it and the judge says you are pardoned that's not correct correct right you are forgiven you are forgiven that's not correct the judge cannot forgive you for the CME that you have never done what the judge can say is that you are discharged and you are quitted of this offenses for you have never done it to begin with amen hallelujah you were not guilty Hall Hallelujah glory and that's what Christ has done for you and high that's what Grace has done for you and I even though we were guilty even though we have done it even though we were unworthy even though you know we cannot say we have never done it but God in his book Hallelujah written before the foundation of the world by the blood of the Lamb God said you have never done it in the first place aren't you happy this morning aren't you glad that the Lord brought you out aren't you glad that the price is paid aren't you glad you know for what he has done for you amen amen you've never done it in the first place so therefore brothers and sister you are what Justified you are freed amen you are not just only forgiven you are Justified you have been discharged you've been acquitted amen amen amen so therefore regardless this morning of your circumstance of your situation you can tell the devil I have never done it I was not sick I don't have cancer I don't have HIV h I don't have Corona virus I don't have hat I don't have anything amen why because God said you don't have it and then you know Jesus Christ said you don't have it and the Bible says he is the high priest of our prion Hebrews chapter 3:1 that is to say whatsoever you profess that's what he will confess before God in heaven that he has done for you and but Abraham said God will never do for you what he has already done hallelujah it's already done you are already healed you have been set free you have been made whole you are perfect Hallelujah Oh [Applause] Glory no wonder the Bible say who can lay charge on God's elect amen hallelujah God bless you you love him this morning you believe his word this is nothing but the truth and the friends if that is the truth then we should lay our life down to God and serve him with our whole heart we should move away from the things of the world we should move closer to God and save him all the Days of Our Lives the prophet used this illustration he said it's like husband and wife he said that was what Apostle Paul was saying here in Romans he said the law has power over a woman in as long as a husband live but if a husband be dead dead she's free to remarry but if she goes and marry why her husband is still living she will be called an adulterous woman that's the Bible but if her husband be dead she's no longer under the law of a husband she can be married to another man and that exactly what happened to you between you and Christ the nature that's adamic nature you were married to it you were a liar you were a sinner you a fornicator you an adulter you are an adulteress you are whatever it is all sins all hearts that are there in the calendar of sin they are all against you you've done everything it's because of the first husband which is adamic nature yes that's it but if you come to the cross of Jesus Christ and you accepted the forar suffering of Christ and all those that He took and nailed them to the Cross crucified dead you come onto the other side in the newness of life amen the desire has been taken away from you to never do them anymore yes yes the root of sin has been de with by fire amen the Holy Ghost Fire Burns it yes cleanse you Hallelujah make you hold Hallelujah and pure your name is now revealed to you in the Lamb's Book of Life which the lamb himself redeemed for himself Hallelujah you can see yourself in the marriage certificate that exist between you and the land oh hallelujah what a glorious thing it is to know that you are passed from Death onto life e Grace and then we can show more love Grace and then we can show more love unto God by living the right Life by walking in the right way Hallelujah that is what it means for us to respond you know to God's Saving Grace Hallelujah moving away from all the things of the world and getting Anor away in Christ Hallelujah every day of Our Lives Let It Be Lord let it be Lord let it be Just A Closer Walk with You granded Jesus is my ple daily walking close today let it be Lord let

husband because I'll just say it like this every one of us got married at 13 at the age of accountability we now had that old satanic nature and it's self-will it's the self-will nature and here's the thing that is the thing that you you have to die out too God is saying that he will not marry us if we're still have the old nature because he's not going to marry an adulteress we have to separate from the old nature the old will and say not my will but thy will be done hallelujah and brother B says we have to lay in the presence of the son we sung about it but as you lay in the presence of God you die out out to your will so he can become more of our husband it's not just a claiming God is our husband but our life has to die out to the old nature glory and then his nature lives inside and we do what our brother just said we go out we win souls we live for him we we start manifesting more of the Christ right and so we want to we can easily it's easy to say you know Christ is mine but we got to we just got to die out to the flesh and I believe God has you know given us this message today to to to recognize what our what our what our true position is and what we need to do amen amen
