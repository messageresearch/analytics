we certainly appreciate that worship amen that worship time that we had with the Lord just now amen amen we want to talk about act activating our faith amen amen I believe that faith is is the one thing that we need to overcome amen amen amen before we begin reading let's look to the author here our heavenly father we thank you that you've you've given us health and strength to be here today Lord what a grand privilege was and is to have worshiped you Lord in in song and and and to have these words that we're singing Just minister to our hearts and Lord to about express our love to you

service for each and every one of us here those that would be watching Lord we pray that you would just speak your word to our hearts and give us the ears to hear what your spirit would be speaking Lord we'll give you the praise now and in the time to come for we ask these things in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen Hebrews are are I should say Romans Romans what am I doing in Hebrews I tell you Hebrews is a good book but we need to be in Romans sorry for using my pages like that Romans chapter 12 starting with verse number one I beseech you therefore Brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a Living Sacrifice holy and acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God for I say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as God have dealt to every man The Measure of Faith amen God bless you may be seated brother bandam said in the message have faith in God he said faith is not something that you imagine in your mind he says it's something that absolutely you have if we believe the scriptures the scriptures says God is dealt to every man The Measure of Faith right now Faith is an actual substance that comes from God Amen we can say that this actual substance if you look it up is an assurance or a confidence the Bible says that the substance is this substance is is things hoped for it is the substance that things hope for so when we all have situations in our life that we want to turn out a certain way amen and we have hope in them that they will turn out a certain way uh whether we're praying for people that are sick or there's basically any possible thing that you could desire of the Lord you have a hope that it's going to turn out a right a certain way even people in the world have hope that things will be uh I mean people hope that you know things are going to turn around for this world or turn around for America they have this this hope but faith is something different amen faith has a substance that hope doesn't have right that's right so when we hope for something this element is missing this element which is an absolute assurance that it's going to happen right there's the difference is there's an absolute Assurance now how can I have that absolute Assurance how can I know I'm not a Seer I can't see the future how can I have it God can give it to you amen God can give it to you Hebrews 11 uh verse three says through faith we understand that the world's were framed by the word of God that's right so when God said let there be whatever let there be light Let There Be animals there was an absolute assurance that it was going to happen amen because faith comes from God and God God don't just hope it's going to happen he knows if it's going to happen amen his word will not return void amen when God told man don't eat of the devil's knowledge or you'll die there was an absolute assurance that it was going to happen when God spoke it he knew that if man would eat then he would die because God spoke it and when God spoke it it was faith it was not hope amen when Jesus said destroy this Temple and in three days I'll raise it up there was an absolute Assurance in Jesus Christ that it was going to happen it wasn't just I hope it happens I hope the father comes through no it was going to happen amen amen and when Jesus uh looked at Peter Peter's good intentions when Peter said that you know I'm going to die with you he said before the crawls Thou shalt deny me Thrice there was an absolute Assurance in Jesus Christ that it was going to happen now Peter didn't have it he did did not have that he was kind of hoping it wouldn't happen but you understand when God speaks it's Faith that's why it's so important that when we come to church or we're listening to a tape or we get on our knees to pray that we hear the voice of God because that's what gives Faith amen we can say through absolute Assurance of God we understand that the things happened the things that God did happen by the word of God when he spoke it it happened it was absolute Assurance he said my word will not return unto me void we we don't have to worry about God coming through with his word right amen amen the struggle is is is is our word and other people's words but but but we don't ever have to worry about God's word now God according to the scriptures has dealt like playing cards he's dealt to every one of us a Measure of Faith I want you to know this it is exactly this the faith that he has given each of us is exactly the same faith that he used to create the world yes it's not a different Faith amen it is the same exact faith if you look it up it's pistis which means Assurance so God has given us the same thing that he used to create the worlds he's given us a measure of absolute Assurance of God am now it may not seem like it we may not realize it but the word of God is true and this is what we've got to We've Got to Believe the word more than how we feel CU so often we we we question we doubt we're we're wondering where we're standing but we know that inside of us somewhere is an absolute Assurance of God I want to give you an example of that you got saved that's I mean just to put it in simplicity at one time we didn't even know God we didn't even think about God Amen and something inside of us believed that if we repented and we gave our heart to God that God would save us that was the that was that measure of faith that God gave us so it is there we're living proof that it's there amen when God delivered us of filthy habits that was the faith that was once delivered to us desires we have desires that we we've been delivered of we have our lives that have been changed our Nature has been changed things have happened in our life that has happened through faith amen and through faith alone now all these examples is a measure of absolute assurance that God is inside of you absolute assurance that God is inside of you you took God at his word and when you activate that measure your life changes when you activated it I believe the word of God that if I Repent that God's blood will cover my sins he won't hold it against me on the day of judgment you activated that Measure of Faith and it brought forth a life inside of you it wasn't just some imagination there was something that concretely happened in our lives now you activate the measure that you have by simp simp L uniting with what God has already said it is that simple you've got to unite with it you've got to become one with it in other words if you just went to church all your life but you never really wanted to give your your heart to God you really never wanted to be saved you wouldn't ignite Unite with the word that's being preached but when you want what that word is saying you agree with it and the faith inside of you is activated to take a hold of God's word and then it becomes a reality amen now I know that you know this is very simplistic but I'll tell you I'm tell you the devil is so great at at taking our lives and getting them so con so confused and twisted and and messed up with many different types of thoughts that we can't seem to have faith to do anything but we got to get back to the basics just call the devil out and tell him he's a liar the faith is already there just agree with the word Unite with the word God's word is really the only thing that's absolute Assurance right everything's got everything else has got holes in it yes but God's word is yay and it's amen amen we probably didn't realize it at one point in our lives but something triggered that faith that dealt to us and that is when we heard the voice of God spoken to us personally think about this I never got saved when God spoke to Brother Bruce Brother Bruce didn't get saved when God spoke to brother Beckman see it's personal this is why it's so important that even though we're here collectively as a as a body we've got to be so in tune with God because I tell you the one thing that the devil can't stand against is you believing to the word and we've got to hear that personally so everybody else can be in la la land but you're so in tune with God that you hear the voice of God spoken to you and that's what what triggers it that's what what activates your faith it becomes real amen and Jesus said everyone that is of Truth Hearth my voice amen do you belong to God Amen you anchor it you you hear his voice don't this is the truth there's so many examples in the Bible when uh the Lord speaks to you the devil wants to come right behind that and get you all confused and a lot of times the Devil comes and he says this is the voice of God to do the same thing to confuse you but Jesus said my sheep hear my voice and they follow me amen so this you know we can just tell the devil get behind me am now we need to remember that this Measure of Faith is still in us today amen it didn't go away after we got saved it's still in US and Peter says that we are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation so when things just seem to be falling out it's through your faith that you're kept by the power of God if you do not if you start to lose Faith what's going to keep you right because without faith it's impossible to please God you've got to trust God just like you're when it comes time to take communion that's the acid test whether you're walking with God it's not good enough to say well I don't feel worthy I haven't lived right and and I'm not going to take it that's damnation to you you've got to take it so you've got to get you've got to have get that thing right so you can take communion because God expects it and demands that and I say it's the same thing with faith we've got to have faith in God and it's what keeps us we don't believe in the power of God keeping us then how can we be kept we are kept by the power of God through the measure of the absolute Assurance of God now now a lot of times we look at Faith and we there's parables in the Bible that talks about how it's just the the the smallest of all the uh herbs seeds it is the smallest one yet it grows into be the biggest one right and so here's the thing often we look at ourselves as heav you know where's our faith and I'm just trying look we don't need something more than what we got we need to believe in what we have the devil wants to keep us to you know put the carrot out there look I'm just going to take God at his word today that's all I got to do take him at his word today we can still activate the measure of faith that we have any time in our life we can take God at his word we just have that absolute assurance that he's given each and every one of us how many times that we just say boy I just I just don't feel like I got any faith we've all been there that's the moment that we got to say no I have faith because God gave it to me amen you don't have to feel it faith is a sick sense that goes beyond feelings it is let's take a a couple examples in the Bible there was a woman with a blood issue I believe she had it for 12 years she activated the measure of absolute assurance that God had given her she activated it she said within her heart if I could just touch His Garment I shall be made whole that was that was in her heart she she believed that if she could do that it would happen and Jesus said who touched me am and they kind of rebuked him everybody's touching you what do you mean who's touched you and he said somebody have touched me for I perceive that virtue is gone out of me amen you know people can go like this all day long no strength virtues going out of you but Faith took strength out of Jesus Faith did she activated the faith that she had she was the one that said if I can just Touch the Hem of His Garment brother brah said that a person's Faith pulls on God think about it we've heard him say that you you pull on the gift you operate the gift well I'm just going to say your faith pull God and and if if your faith is going to sit there and not take a hold of the word we're not going to we're not going to get from it what we can be getting from it see we've got to do our part and after she came trembling the Bible says Jesus said daughter be of good cheer thy faith have made thee whole now notice this he said thy faith he didn't say God's faith he had already dealt that to her you understand we all have faith yes it originated from God it is originated from God but he gave it to you amen and you got to claim it you got to use your faith and he said thy faith have made thee whole go in peace we've got to activate our our faith amen she activate the measure that God gave her and we've got to do it also there was a woman of Canaan she had a sick daughter we all know the story she came to Jesus crying have mercy on me oh Lord thou son of David my daughter is grievously vexed with the Devil the Bible says that he would not even answer her a word in fact his disciples said look you better just rebuke her and send her away trying to keep order finally Jesus told the woman look I am here to help only the people of Israel that's what he said that's I'm only here to help them you would have thought that would have been enough but that woman actually came closer to Jesus and start worshiping am said Lord help me but Jesus had to step up the Annie at the pulpit he said it is not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs wow he he got a little stronger he got a little stronger and she agreed with the word she agreed what was being preached and she said truth Lord yet the dogs they eat of the crumbs which fall from the master's table and Jesus said unto her oh woman great is thy faith great is thy faith be it unto thee even as thou Wilt she activated the faith that was inside of her she would not be discouraged amen she held her confidence she had absolute Assurance of God and I believe that's what God was seen when he said great is thy faith you know a lot of times we'll start out to believe something but we get a little hurt or a little offended that we stop believing look this is a perfect example for the Bride of Jesus Christ we will not take a backseat we will take God no matter what we're called what we are absolute Assurance of God he's taken me through she would not be sh shaken I think that would shake some people in this message today instead of just you're right that's that's what I am it's like who are you to tell me that who are you you the very fact that you're saying that you're denying who even spoke to you all right Hebrews chapter 12 verse 26 don't you think we're in a a shaking time in the world right now I just is not exactly the subject but I I just want you to know how important faith is Hebrews 12:26 now God has promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only but also heaven right amen think of all the things that are happening in the world the devil's really messing things up but you know God's allowing it and this word yet once more signifying the removing of those things that are shaken as of the things which are made that the things which cannot be shaken May remain amen well this woman remained she couldn't be shaken because faith comes from God it is not man-made the faith that you hold inside of you it's it's God's faith in other words that faith is so powerful that it created the world and he gave you a med of it you should just tell the devil I will not be moved I will not be shaken I'm holding to God's unchanging hand wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear you know it takes a right spirit to know how to serve god with reverence and godly fear for our God is a consuming fire if he wants to shake the whole world if he wants to do what he's doing if he every time you turn on the news there's threats coming from North Korea or from Russia from China you know they all got their target on who cares it's going to happen the thing is the devil can't take what God gave inside of me yes the world's going to blow up yes it is and it is sad that our kids or our grandkids are maybe not going to see and and have a a a nice place as we did because the world's getting worse but I'll tell you the sooner we get out of here the sooner we get to Heaven There won't yeah I just let that go we're all going through tough situations at one time or another we go through them but God would never put anything on us that his grace would not be able to see us through amen and our faith in God will see us through amen but if we come up to that place just say oh yeah I am just a dog I'm not of Israel I'm not going to get this blessing I'm asking for it and you walk away you're you're the shoes the souls of your feet have not claimed that ground that's and no matter what your situation is you got to claim it that God is with you that God will see you through you have to have absolute Assurance of God in that situation now here's the thing I know that don't come easy sometimes you have to pray with desperation you have to call upon God you say God I got to hear from you today but that's okay that's what God wants you to do that's why he puts you you in those situations it's not bad and it's not wrong there's times we don't even get everything we want but we still have absolute assurance that God is in control and he gives us peace that passeth all understanding I want to spend just a couple minutes talking about the law of faith has anybody ever heard of that the law of faith if you never activate your faith it can never help you you cannot please God the Bible says whatsoever is not of faith is sin Romans 3 mentions the law of faith brother Ram talked about the law of faith in the message ever present water from the rock you want to read that sometime or listen to it but brother bam says and the power that will raise us up is right in us now right amen we're now in Heavenly places we are now in the power of the Resurrection if there wasn't a law to that Sons and Daughters of God would create them a world out there and go live a private life on it but there's a law says you have the power in you to do it if you've got a shadow of the power of God in you you've got power to do it God is omnipotent see what I mean the power that's in you you could speak a word world into existence and go live on it Hallelujah there you are brother Brandon must have got excited with that but you know there's a law there something is keeping us from going speaking the world into existence didn't brother bandam talk about power without character satanic the character is the will of God and that's honestly this is the first thing that we need to understand about the law of faith faith comes from God not us am it's it's got to be God's will amen and the second thing is we must Unite with what God Said faith comes from God but it goes through a free more agency and it has to come out the other side with an agreement with God not a yeah it's it's God's word I know it's true and you know that's what brother BR said that's what they preach and yeah I've heard it for so no You' got to have an absolute Assurance you're holding on to that with everything that you got in you remember how Jesus would say if thou can't believe there's that variable or he would say according to thy faith not according to me because I already wish above all things that you would prosper and be in hell I I want you to not have the devil uh putting chains of Doubt on you right we know God's will but we've got to unite with the word we got to we got to tell the devil to get behind us the Bible says submit yourself therefore to God resist the devil and he will flee from you that's a promise of God you got to unite with that Amen brother Braham said faith is a direct Revelation boy we've heard you know faith is a revelation but he says here faith is a direct Revelation in other words God has something just for you amen just for you personally for you it's not for the person sitting next to you he's God's got a different Revelation for that person but for you he has something direct for you for years I quoted quoted a defined faith is when God speaks personally to us those of you that have been with us a long time know that to be true we've never changed that it's when God speaks to you directly and you Unite with what God said to you amen because God can speak to you directly and you don't Unite with him that's not Faith Peter had a direct re ation of who Jesus was and Jesus said for Flesh and Blood have not revealed it unto thee but my Father which is in heaven a direct Revelation for Peter and Jesus was asking who does who do other people say they had ideas from hearing people with knowledge and understanding because they were saying well he's probably you know maybe uh one of the prophets Elias uh Jeremiah I mean the these were people that were spiritual people spiritual believers they they they they understood the word and they their whole uh their their whole word was this has to be uh one of God's people but un but but but they didn't get a a direct Revelation from God it was their own concept well that won't take you through it will it you got to hear directly from God can you say amen amen all right Romans chap 10 verse 16 Romans 10:16 says but they have not all obeyed the gospel for Isaiah saith Lord who have believed our report they all went to church but who believed it they all heard it but who believed it so then Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God Jesus said my word words are spirit and they are life amen we can hear the word of God being preached but if all you're doing is hearing the word of God being preached by a man it's not personal to you how is that going to give you Faith how is that going to build your faith you've got to hear it personally from God even though it's coming out of a human being it's God using that human being to speak to your heart personally then it becomes real to You Verse 18 but I say have they not heard yes verily their sound went into all the earth and the word and their words unto the ends of the world everyone is going to have a chance everyone has a chance to hear the voice of God Amen if not then they how could God judge him right so everybody's going to have a chance amen and we believe that we have an opportunity right here to build ourselves up in the Most Holy Faith every time we hear the word of God being preached we're so close to him so tight with him so in tune with him we don't care what John's wearing we don't care if he's Whispering we don't care if he's yell we don't care if he's going from this end to that end we are so locked into the word of God that we're hearing the voice of God speak to us and we do that by keeping ourselves the Bible says in the love of God be so in love with him you're here because you're in love with him amen just want to have his word now I'll tell you the Bible says in Jude 1 uh verse 20 but ye beloved building up yourselves on what your Most Holy Faith yours building yourself up on your Most Holy Faith you can't rely how many times we hear the prophet say you can't you can't make it on somebody else's shirt tail you've got to have your own praying now notice this praying in the Holy Ghost so when you're praying and you haven't reached that place I just say keep praying going keep going yes keep going keep yourselves in the love of God looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life that is the right Spirit I'll tell you if I if I get eternal life I'm saying like that it'll be the mercy of God yes I don't deserve it I'm looking I'm looking to it looking for the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ and to etern life but notice just hearing the voice of God is Not Enough we got to unite with it let's take Jonah for example Jonah heard the voice of the Lord but he didn't activate his faith that was given to him he didn't Unite with the word he didn't say yes Lord no he ran the other way right so he didn't have faith even though God spoke to him I'm trying to show the importance of how important it is for you to really Unite with the words you know some so many people just go to church and they feel so great that they went to church I did my part I went to church I feel better but look God wants us to unite with the world right Cain he heard the voice of the Lord but he never United with what God said he didn't have faith and it didn't please God either balum he heard the voice of the Lord but he didn't Unite with it he had a different agenda he he had a an interest for personal gain yes but he heard the voice of the Lord the Rich Young Ruler he heard the voice of the Lord Lord but he didn't Unite with what God told him to do so he didn't have faith so it's not just hearing God speak to you it's when you say yes Lord I accept that I believe it then that becomes faith faith is activated I'll tell you it will bring to pass the thing that you're looking for because God spoke it look at Pharaoh he heard the voice of the Lord he did it wasn't directly from God it was through a prophet but he heard and if he would have obeyed everything would have been okay but he never United with what God Said So hearing from God is essential because without hearing from God we're not going to get Faith Faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God but uniting with what God Said is just as essential if you don't Unite with it if you don't say I in this word that he has spoken to me have become one it won't profit us anything but they have not all obeyed the gospel see they heard the report but they didn't obey it so it wasn't Faith to them true belief of God's report is when you accept the word enough to that you obey whatever he tells you to do and sometimes he doesn't sometimes he doesn't say well you got to go do this sometimes he just wants to see if you're going to hold there when the Devil comes knocking on your door are you going to O are you going to obey and hold to that word turn with me if you would to Hebrews chapter 4 for Faith to be activated the voice of God must go through free more agency and be United you must Unite with what God Said through Freemore agency this is so critical because I think a lot of times you know we want God to give us Faith but we're unwilling to unite with the word or we're just going to you know see something in the scriptures oh it'd be nice to have that but we don't even we don't fall in love with God in that word and say God I want to be that I want you if that's what you have for me God that's what I accept you know we've got to build the relationship for Faith to to be real for our lives we're not of those that just we're we're we want to build a relationship to make a Rapture that's what we're looking for I mean there's churches out there that are just full of um signs and wonders and and um they're believing for this and that is wonderful but look I want Faith to take me through that's what I need I could get healed of whatever I'm sick of I'm probably sick of a lot of things don't know yet but you know what I can get healed of every one of those things I still need Faith to take me through it's more important all right Hebrews 42 For unto us was the Gospel preached as well as unto them but the word preached did not profit them not being mixed with faith in them that heard it so they heard the word but they didn't mix it with faith they didn't mix it with that is for me that is for me Joshua and Caleb had it but there was what 1.88 million that didn't have it I'll tell you they had another Spirit that's the spirit I want amen that's the spirit I want we've got to unite with what God is saying that's why it's important know brother brother brandham said that the Holy Ghost says Amen to every word of God there's a uniting there going on and you know a lot of times God will speak to us something that we don't want okay like um I want you to do this I don't want to do that see you just let it go you need to do this I want you to do this I want you to I want you to go here turn there do this I want you to pray I want you to call I want you to reach I want and don't got time don't feel like it don't believe in it you know God's going to have to if it's really God he's going to have to tell me in a different way because I don't believe in this stuff think about it the Holy Ghost is sent to lead and guide us into all truth I am telling you here today we are not living in all the truth so I can expect God to lead me into more truth amen so he's going to speak things to me that I don't accept that I don't agree with that doesn't make sense to my understanding but yet it's still the voice of God Amen but if we're not in love with him if we're not willing to to lay down our lives and do what he's asked us to do we'll miss it we'll never have faith for the word Joshua and Caleb had absolute Assurance of God they really did they went how many years 40 years they didn't change their testimony in fact they were just as strong at the end as they they were at the beginning that's absolute you know a lot of times we get on well I think you know God told me this and two weeks later and we're thinking that's Faith that's not faith that was hope faith is [Music] different faith is you could be told by everybody in the world they're not standing with you but you heard from God and you're standing on it that's what faith is now look we cannot just expect God to give that to us with any old kind of attitude we got to Humble ourselves before he gives more grace to the humble so we got to get in a place where we're seeking him more we're calling on God we're putting forth the effort God I want this thing to be personal I want to make it personal I I mean yes this is my home Church yes this is my pastor yes this is this is what a fine family but you know we need a personalness with God Amen so it's got to go beyond those things in order for God to move in our behalf his word spoken to us personally must go through freeo agency and we think it does but it doesn't just think of all the times God asked you to do something and you didn't do it it doesn't easily go through there even though we love God even though we're saved you know we got this cockabur nature that just there's a reason Jesus said Die daily it requires that we hey just die once a week and you'll be good for the week right you you that take pills you got to take them every day don't you wish you just take them once be done you know for a week or something but you know we got to Die daily we need to activate our faith faith is is important the just shall live by faith all right I promised shook hands with brother Mike got to make sure that this doesn't go one minute over he was just teasing me but we're doing good just so you know brother bandam said in the message Moses he says now remember if you can think maybe there's just some of it you don't understand how's got things in their life you just don't understand we all got them and I'll tell you when you get understanding for a couple of them there's going to be more that you don't understand it's just the way life is he says brother BR says frankly friends there's much of it that I do not understand I just accept it don't never try to figure God out says you can't do it God is not understood by knowledge God is understood by faith it's a trust I you know what I find there's so much more peace if I can just trust him amen because the more you try to figure out something the more confused you get the more you feel so condemned so hopeless so there's no help in the situation but if you can trust God just believe we'll understand it better by and by in the message led by the spirit brother B says only faith is the only thing can help you tonight is isn't that right he says then why don't you believe God's word only faith can help you no matter no ma no wonder the angel told Brother bam I like that song only believe that's all we got to do is only believe activate your faith with absolute Assurance of God activate your faith by only believing only believing to sing the song it's easy to only believe the word is hard because the devil is there in your mind thrown thoughts reasons and you've got to resist those things and just say get behind me Satan I'm I'm standing on the word of God today so let's get desperate to hear God's voice amen hey let's get desperate this is the only way that we'll be to activate our faith in God's word spend more time in prayer spend more more time preparing for service come early in prayer when you come into God's Sanctuary be prepared to enter his Gates properly amen amen you too often I don't think we enter the gates properly we just come in we say we're here we entered we walk through the door that's naturally spiritually he demands he demands praise he demand man's a thankful heart enter his gates with Thanksgiving enter his courts with praise there's got to be a a thankfulness there now look God demands it he expects it brother bam talked about how if you're going to go see uh the Pope that you had to do these different things to approach him remember that okay we got some and you have to walk backwards you have to do this and I don't remember all the things but one of them he had to he he did them all and he got to the end where he had to like get on his knee and kisses and he said I won't do that but he had a in order to see the pope you had to do these things and many people do that presence people would do that yeah here's the thing if you really want to get into into God's presence start entering him his Gates properly give them your best when you come in yes I don't it doesn't matter if you had a bad day bad day has nothing to do with giving God what he deserves because when you enter the gates properly God has something special for you I believe that when you read God's word listen for God to speak to you about your life amen God wants to speak speak something to you about your life and what it is it's God's will for your life a lot of times we have a whole list of things that we want God to take care of it's true we do but what is the will of God for those things amen we can't just assume because this is what I desire every time and just tell God you give me the desires of my heart I mean it my heart's deceitful I already know that I don't want to keep learning that one so God's desire for me may be different than mine when you listen to the message Listen for God's will for your life Lord what would there's something in here that you want me to become some some some some nature that I'm not developing that you want me to do something you want me to start doing see that's the right attitude ude you don't want to I want to get this knowledge and I want to learn about this no I want to learn how I can please him now a person's Faith creates the atmosphere for God to come and do the impossible and this is why it's important to build your faith brother Ram said in the message it wasn't sold from the beginning he said people create an atmosphere by the way they live amen whoa you mean I can go home and create an atmosphere and my home that God will come and do the impossible I don't have to be in church and be in front of people we create an atmosphere it's in our it's our in our mind right the right mental attitude we we create an atmosphere where God will come and Grant the promise that we're looking for most of us have heard that faith is a revelation brother B said in the message anointed ones at the other time he say he said faith is a revelation of the will of God whoa whoa this is this is getting personal not just about knowledge of all these things but it's the the will of God that's why it's important to unite with what God is saying learn to be faithful with the things that are are small things that are little in your life things small things that God has asked you to do do them because if you can do the little things then God will give you Faith to do the bigger things but sometimes we look at our life as there's so many needs and I don't know where to start and I've got so many problems and I just don't know you know if God's going to you know just be faithful to what you could be faithful with amen and and and build let's stand together brother Brandon said in the message of Victory is a uh faith is our Victory he said faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer we need [Music] faith we need Faith to conquer we need Faith to overcome amen look a lot of times we're facing a a devil who's just ruthless doesn't care I think about this woman whose daughter was grievously vexed and even Jesus was coming against her look God's on our side we got him on our side we should be able to overcome come the devil I want to leave you this last verse it's 1 John 5:4 and I didn't have you write it but if you want to put it up there that's up to you it says for whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith not God's faith the one that he's already given you he's given you everything you need to overcome brother brenon makes a solid statement that that that power is in you that you could create a world and go live on it you surely got power to tell the devil to get behind you Amen to stop listening to the devil to start becoming more serious with the word of God do you believe that amen let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer Heavenly Father we come to you this evening thanking you for the faith that you have given us we certainly don't deserve the measure of faith that you've given us but Lord we can question ourself we might better to question others but Lord you said you gave Every Man a Measure of Faith what we do with it is up to us some despise it get to a place that they don't have faith anymore some build themsel up in that Most Holy Faith Lord your Prophet came and he gave us a message on perfect faith and how we needed perfect Faith to make a Rapture Lord I pray here for every brother every sister those that perhaps are watching and saying God I want this for my life I pray that you would give them the assurance that as they put one step forward towards you and your word and what you have spoken to them just to obey that Lord that you increase their relationship with you make it so strong Lord that when the devil would come and hiss some lie that the faith inside of them would be so strong that they could just resist that devil rebuke that devil and command the enemy what to do Lord I pray that you'd help us in our endeavors Lord to activate the faith that you've given us whether we be in our homes or workplaces whether we be here in church Lord May the faith be activated in every one of us that our church would grow in faith that we could see you do the things Lord that you desire to do amongst us Lord we never want chains of to hinder you Lord we we want to be free from that so I pray let this word that was spoken today by you Lord let it find a place of Refuge in every one of us help us Lord to take it serious to to build up ourselves upon that Most Holy Faith that you have given us already Lord may we never forget it's inside of us Lord we commit oursel to you Lord we thank you Lord that you've equipped us and given us everything that we need to make a Rapture and now Lord by your grace Lord we're going to continue to grow our faith from day to day we ask all these things and give you the praise for them all in The Wonderful Name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen let's sing uh living by faith living by faith amen I care

world blows up uh there's people that are building bunkers miles deep into the Earth preparing for this thing but brother brandom had wisdom some would even want to be in heaven but he shaken the heaven right he's shaking the Earth but the word that's where he said I'd rather be I just want to be in the word want to be in the voice of God spoken to me personally may the Lord be with you and bless bless you amen Let's uh pray for our our special services coming up and that God would just have his way Among Us
