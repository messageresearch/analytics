[2:23] and
[2:24] they just wanted to greet all of you
[2:26] praise the lord
[2:28] this morning
[2:31] we have a little video clip
[2:35] some time ago you've heard that
[2:39] we were we're going to show some things
[2:43] what was happening in central america
[2:46] and the they sent us a big
[2:50] long i mean a very long video clip
[2:54] but it's all in spanish and i didn't
[2:57] know what they were saying
[2:58] but it was about the work of the lord
[3:01] that's going down there
[3:02] so we had thoughts about trying to get
[3:04] brother bill sanchez up here
[3:06] and but it would be a lot of work so we
[3:09] asked them if they could find a way to
[3:11] interpret so we got just one church and
[3:14] one
[3:14] selection to show but for those of you
[3:18] that don't know before
[3:21] church we ever started this church we
[3:24] were doing work in the mission field
[3:29] and we had a burden
[3:33] uh quite a long time ago it started to
[3:36] to help out uh in
[3:40] central america and we had an
[3:42] opportunity through
[3:43] brother melchizedek um casco
[3:47] and he had started a
[3:50] foundation there called illusma which
[3:53] simply means send the light
[3:54] in spanish and they have a board of
[3:57] directors
[3:58] and he was the the the president and he
[4:01] had
[4:02] stepped down since then and there's
[4:03] other brothers there they elect
[4:06] and these brothers honestly just take
[4:09] care
[4:10] of making sure the finances get to the
[4:12] many many churches that are down there
[4:14] in central america
[4:16] we don't know them all and so for us to
[4:19] be involved as far as who's worthy and
[4:22] who should be getting that we just
[4:25] we don't put any uh of our
[4:28] uh thoughts into that outside of our our
[4:31] prayers that god would direct the
[4:32] brothers there
[4:34] i feel that our job is just to get the
[4:37] money down there so they can use it
[4:39] of course they they've also been in
[4:40] charge of distributing all the bibles
[4:43] and that we've sent over the years
[4:44] hundreds of thousands of bibles
[4:47] um food we've sent down and all the
[4:49] semis
[4:50] and distributing all the the instruments
[4:53] it's it's been
[4:55] quite an ordeal well for many years
[4:59] now we've been supporting radio
[5:02] broadcast
[5:03] and as these go out to different areas
[5:07] groups start churches start and this
[5:10] is just a video clip of just one of
[5:12] those
[5:13] and we're going to play that for you now
[5:18] amen amen praise the lord
[5:21] amen hope you enjoy it
[5:43] i just want to say it's very hard to
[5:46] if she's got an accent and it's very
[5:48] hard to understand so just do your best
[5:50] for the first three minutes
[5:52] to to try to listen to her voice the
[5:54] best you can
[6:04] dulcino it is a municipality located in
[6:07] the eastern part of pholancho department
[6:10] in our country the missionary work in
[6:12] this locality
[6:14] begins through the initiative of our
[6:16] brother margarita costa
[6:17] who at that time was pastor of lords
[6:20] george
[6:21] implant grande in the same area his
[6:23] decision was to open a radio program in
[6:26] 2014
[6:27] on a local stations in this community
[6:30] under the coverage of the elusive
[6:32] ministry
[6:34] when the radio program began to be
[6:36] transmitted over time
[6:38] souls began to come to the feet of lorne
[6:42] and that is how services began to be
[6:45] held in the home of our brother acosta
[6:47] but due to the rapid road of lourdes
[6:50] work
[6:51] in this place the need arrives for the
[6:54] construction for a tabernacle
[6:56] for which brother margarito costa
[6:58] donated a fraction of land and requests
[7:00] in
[7:01] 2017 to esparzen de luz masaya and luzma
[7:05] ministry
[7:06] the support of the pushes of materials
[7:09] for the
[7:10] aforementioned tabernacle which was
[7:12] built by the brothers from the local
[7:14] church
[7:16] currently the church continues to
[7:18] function always begin your prayers so
[7:21] that the lord continues to add to his
[7:23] church
[7:24] those who are to be saved in this place
[7:27] god bless you
[7:33] [Music]
[8:10] do
[8:16] [Music]
[9:06] do
[9:15] [Music]
[11:54] we're just grateful to
[11:58] the brethren down there that had a
[11:59] vision
[12:01] to spread the gospel and i told
[12:05] them at the very beginning the very very
[12:07] beginning it says
[12:09] i'm all for helping churches that are
[12:12] already established but my true burden
[12:15] is for the souls that have not come in
[12:17] yet
[12:18] of course once they come in then you
[12:20] you're obligated to get them a place of
[12:23] worship
[12:24] so they can continue to meet and grow
[12:26] it's part of the responsibility
[12:29] but we're grateful to the lord that
[12:31] there's faithful brethren around the
[12:33] world that are spreading the gospel
[12:35] and just to be a part of that i'll never
[12:38] forget as long as i lived before this
[12:40] ever started brother casco we invited
[12:43] him over
[12:43] to our house he was in the basement i
[12:45] went down the basement one day
[12:47] and they said brother
[12:51] melchizedek would it would it be okay
[12:54] if we begin to support you
[12:58] and his question to me he says what is
[13:00] your purpose
[13:02] and i'll never forget as long as i live
[13:04] because your motive is everything
[13:09] and if god is in it he'll bless it
[13:13] and he promised to bless this work
[13:15] beyond
[13:18] that beyond that what we could ever
[13:20] imagine
[13:22] that's what he promised and uh i think
[13:25] uh
[13:25] i i was telling ann um when i seen it
[13:28] the first time i just cried
[13:30] because i and i told her this yesterday
[13:32] i was at work
[13:34] i says nobody knows nobody knows
[13:39] the work that's being done
[13:42] by losema nobody knows
[13:46] i says i don't even know
[13:50] and i don't want to know i don't want
[13:52] the right hand to know what the left
[13:53] hand is doing as it were
[13:56] but this i say we can't do enough
[13:59] for the souls that need to come in we
[14:01] cannot do enough
[14:02] [Music]
[14:04] and uh i just say plant seeds now
[14:07] because they make a difference down the
[14:09] road as we can see
[14:11] amen this is just one of many many areas
[14:14] in different countries down there
[14:17] give all you can because you'll receive
[14:20] the benefits on the other side amen
[14:23] amen let's stand together for the
[14:24] reading of god's word galatians chapter
[14:28] 5.
[14:35] uh last
[14:39] wednesday we spoke on joy
[14:42] and it just it sprung a little thought
[14:45] here
[14:46] for today on the fruit of god
[14:49] before we begin reading here in
[14:50] galatians chapter 5 verse 22 let's
[14:53] look to the author just a moment
[14:57] in prayer heavenly father this
[15:00] this perhaps would be the most important
[15:03] part lord is praying before we
[15:06] read your word knowing lord unless you
[15:10] come and reveal the word
[15:12] we just won't grab exactly
[15:16] what it's for and we need this word
[15:19] living inside of us
[15:20] we need the manifestation of it we
[15:23] humbly pray lord as we look into your
[15:25] word
[15:26] that we could become your word we look
[15:29] in this
[15:30] mirror lords of your word today perhaps
[15:34] as we often have have seen things there
[15:37] that we haven't liked
[15:39] lord we don't want to walk away and
[15:40] forget those things
[15:42] we want to we want to keep them
[15:46] ever before us that we might become in
[15:49] your
[15:49] more in your image and in your likeness
[15:52] your completeness
[15:54] father fill us all with the revelation
[15:57] of your word this morning
[15:59] pray lord god that the power of almighty
[16:02] god would be amongst us in every heart
[16:04] and every life
[16:05] for there are many needs lord
[16:08] there's many of us that need a healing
[16:10] touch from you
[16:13] god our dependency is on you
[16:16] come and touch each life father be with
[16:19] those that are not
[16:21] uh here today lord pray that thy holy
[16:25] ghost surround them today and bless them
[16:28] we commit this service in your hands
[16:31] thank you lord for all that you're doing
[16:33] here
[16:34] in jesus precious name we pray amen
[16:38] amen galatians chapter 5
[16:42] we can see that there is a a
[16:45] a very struggle uh paul talking about in
[16:49] this
[16:50] uh chapter that that uh
[16:54] we we started out in liberty and
[16:57] and not to be under the yoke of of
[17:01] bondage of this world anymore and that
[17:03] there's spirits out there that would try
[17:04] to
[17:05] persuade us off to be off track and
[17:08] and then he talks about the uh that
[17:11] there's a struggle between the flesh and
[17:13] the spirit and that we got to walk in
[17:15] the spirit and
[17:17] and and serve one another in love and
[17:19] then he
[17:20] he talks about what happens when you're
[17:22] in the flesh and then as it were the
[17:24] fruit of the flesh and then
[17:26] he comes in in verse number two
[17:29] 22 and talks about the fruit of the
[17:32] spirit is love
[17:33] it's joy it's peace longsuffering
[17:37] gentleness goodness faith meekness
[17:39] temperance
[17:40] against such there is no law
[17:43] and they that are christ have crucified
[17:47] the flesh with the affections and lust
[17:50] if we live in the spirit let us also
[17:53] walk in the spirit
[17:55] let us not be desirous of vain glory
[17:58] uh provoking one another and envying
[18:02] one another amen god bless you may be
[18:04] seated
[18:06] simply want to call this entitle this
[18:08] the fruit
[18:09] of god the fruit of god and for a
[18:12] subject hebrews 13
[18:14] 8 for god is the same yesterday today
[18:17] and forever amen now
[18:20] uh there is a lot of information and it
[18:23] won't hurt my feelings if nobody took
[18:25] notes but you you may
[18:26] but all i can say is we've got a lot of
[18:28] scriptures to go through and i i
[18:30] kind of want you to catch the spirit
[18:33] basically of the word today
[18:35] can always uh go back i can give you
[18:38] copies you can listen to it again i just
[18:40] i want you to grab this but as we go
[18:43] through these
[18:44] i want us to notice that this is
[18:47] this is god in spirit form god is the
[18:50] spirit
[18:51] he's specifically known as the holy
[18:53] spirit of truth
[18:54] often referred to as the comforter the
[18:57] very nature of god
[18:58] is described here or better yet
[19:00] displayed
[19:01] by the fruit of the spirit this is the
[19:04] fruit
[19:05] of god amen love first and foremost
[19:10] god is love first john chapter 4 verse 8
[19:12] he that loveth not
[19:14] knoweth not god for god is love
[19:17] one of the great characteristics between
[19:21] the spirit of of god and not the spirit
[19:24] of god
[19:24] uh it is simply um
[19:28] god he lives for others
[19:31] and and satan he lives for himself
[19:35] god loves others and satan loves himself
[19:40] is just that simple god's love seeketh
[19:43] not her own where the devil's loves
[19:46] seeks love seeks for himself amen
[19:49] the characteristic of god's nature is
[19:51] displayed in his love because god's
[19:53] nature is
[19:54] truly for the welfare of others
[19:57] and i think if we at time first
[19:59] corinthians chapter 13 would
[20:02] explain and show us a little bit about
[20:04] god's love god is not trying
[20:06] ever to vaulteth himself he's not puffed
[20:09] up
[20:10] to try to be someone he's willing to
[20:12] take a backseat
[20:13] he was born in a manger god sees uh
[20:17] things are not always going to be
[20:19] perfect so he handles them
[20:21] with grace he doesn't act unseemly or
[20:24] inappropriate or offensive he doesn't
[20:27] act out of place
[20:28] he has the ability in all types of
[20:31] problems and situations
[20:32] to endure all sorts of hardships
[20:36] amen all sorts of problems while
[20:39] thinking
[20:40] no evil he's hoping for the best in
[20:43] every situation
[20:45] god has that ability
[20:49] that's why love is so important first
[20:52] and foremost
[20:53] joy we talked about it last service
[20:56] we're reminded of the power
[20:58] that lies within the joy of god
[21:01] god's joy psalms 116 verse 11 thou
[21:05] shalt show the path of life amen he
[21:08] showed us wednesday the path of life in
[21:11] thy presence is fullness of joy
[21:15] at the right hand there are pleasures
[21:17] forevermore
[21:19] for the joy of the lord is our strength
[21:22] showing
[21:23] we need the joy of the lord so we can
[21:26] have strength
[21:27] whatever is going on in our life amen
[21:29] the joy of the lord is what we need
[21:32] peace isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 for unto
[21:36] us a child is born
[21:37] unto us a son is given the government
[21:39] shall be upon his shoulders and his
[21:41] his name shall be called wonderful
[21:43] counselor of the mighty god the
[21:44] everlasting father
[21:45] the prince of peace
[21:49] god is known as the prince of peace
[21:52] think about that
[21:53] a fruit of the spirit he is the
[21:55] principal of peace as much
[21:57] as god is the self-existing one
[22:00] and no one can live without him
[22:06] he will not force his truth upon
[22:08] somebody
[22:09] else for he is the prince of peace he's
[22:11] the god of peace
[22:15] it doesn't force
[22:18] that's what people want to be separated
[22:20] from him that's fine
[22:22] he's a god of peace god wanted
[22:26] abraham and lot servants to be at peace
[22:31] god is truly a peacemaker
[22:36] he broke down the center wall partition
[22:39] between god
[22:40] and man making peace with man
[22:44] he's a peacemaker god is long suffering
[22:48] god has suffered for mankind so long we
[22:51] would have to go back to the garden of
[22:53] eden
[22:53] to see he's been suffering so long
[22:57] god lowered himself and became a human
[23:01] being
[23:01] subject to all the elements that we
[23:04] deal with and he continued to lower
[23:08] himself and humble himself as we sung
[23:10] about it he became obedient unto death
[23:13] the bible says
[23:15] the death of his own will the death of
[23:17] his own body
[23:19] for you and i that's what he humbled
[23:22] himself to
[23:23] [Music]
[23:26] god is very long-suffering
[23:29] not willing the bible says that any
[23:31] should perish
[23:33] and the bible tells us that he's he's
[23:35] patiently waiting
[23:37] today for the precious fruit to come
[23:39] forth
[23:41] so god is is definitely a god that's
[23:44] long suffering
[23:45] we can see the very nature of god
[23:46] displayed in christ as he suffered for
[23:49] our sins and
[23:50] luke 24 verse 26 says ought
[23:53] not christ you have suffered these
[23:55] things and to enter into his glory
[23:58] christ suffered for us amen
[24:02] matthew 23 verse 37 o jerusalem
[24:06] jerusalem thou that kill us the prophets
[24:09] and stone us them
[24:10] that are sent to thee how often would i
[24:12] have gathered
[24:14] thy children together even as a hand
[24:17] gathereth thy chickens
[24:18] under her wings and he
[24:22] would not look at the long suffering of
[24:25] god
[24:25] every time we come to church the word is
[24:28] the word the word can change our lives
[24:31] but he's waiting he's suffering he's
[24:33] waiting for our hearts to get right
[24:37] man it would be
[24:40] better for you to come to church and say
[24:43] my heart
[24:44] is not right rather than come to church
[24:46] and gamble that my heart is right
[24:50] because the fruit can only come forth if
[24:53] the ground is good
[24:54] and sometimes you got to take the hard
[24:56] ground and you got to till it up with
[24:58] prayer
[24:58] and get in there and let god just begin
[25:01] to
[25:02] take that hard clumps and make it such a
[25:05] powder that he can lay the word of his
[25:07] his seed of his word right there and let
[25:09] it come forth
[25:10] you know what happens when you got hard
[25:12] ground i've i've laid grass seed
[25:14] on hard ground so many times i come by
[25:17] and i see it kind of washed to the side
[25:20] just to the wayside but if you can till
[25:22] that up put the seed in there
[25:24] it's got a chance to grow
[25:28] revelations chapter 6 verse 9
[25:32] and when he opened the fifth seal
[25:36] i saw under the altar the souls of them
[25:38] that were slain
[25:39] for the word of god and for the
[25:41] testimony which they held
[25:43] and they cried with a loud voice saying
[25:46] how long oh lord holy and true
[25:49] does thou not judge and avenge our blood
[25:52] on them
[25:53] that dwell on the earth
[25:56] god is still long-suffering today
[26:00] with each of us think about it not just
[26:03] them
[26:04] i think about the long-suffering that
[26:06] god has on me
[26:08] and it makes me cry i'm so unworthy i'm
[26:11] not where i need to be with god
[26:15] the very nature of god is manifested
[26:19] in long suffering praise god
[26:22] gentleness god is a real
[26:26] genuine gentleman
[26:29] he doesn't force his agenda on humanity
[26:32] james chapter 3 verse 17 but the wisdom
[26:36] that is from above
[26:38] is first pure peaceable
[26:42] gentle
[26:46] god is gentle easy to be entreated full
[26:49] of mercy
[26:50] and good fruits without partiality and
[26:53] what
[26:54] without hypocrisy
[26:57] god doesn't push himself or his agenda
[27:01] on anybody and we shouldn't have to do
[27:04] that either
[27:05] he has respect and he shows
[27:08] respect now think about this here's the
[27:10] god that
[27:11] deserves all respect
[27:15] he deserved respect from pilate
[27:21] there were two thieves on the cross next
[27:23] to him one was shown respect
[27:25] one was not but god did not disrespect
[27:28] either
[27:32] he's a real gentleman and he's got
[27:34] gentleness about him amen
[27:37] he didn't force himself on the rich
[27:40] young ruler to force him
[27:43] he gave him a choice here it is this is
[27:46] what you need to do
[27:48] and he started walking away he didn't
[27:51] clobber him
[27:52] he didn't do it he just had compassion
[27:54] on him
[27:55] because he was turning around his only
[27:58] chance for eternal life
[28:03] there was no guile found
[28:07] in the mouth of jesus
[28:11] a real gentleness first peter chapter 2
[28:14] verse 23 when he revived when he was
[28:17] reviled
[28:18] he didn't revile back when he suffered
[28:20] he didn't threaten
[28:22] he was gentle the nature of god is to be
[28:26] gentle and harmless
[28:31] the goodness of god god is so good
[28:35] he's good all the time he's not just
[28:38] good
[28:38] some of the time he's good all the time
[28:41] can you say amen to that
[28:43] every time god created something if you
[28:45] go to the book of genesis
[28:47] every time he created something he
[28:49] stepped back and the bible says
[28:50] and god saw that it was good everything
[28:53] he does
[28:54] is good psalms 31 19 said oh
[28:58] how great is thy goodness psalms 33 5
[29:02] the earth is
[29:03] full of the goodness of the lord psalms
[29:05] 107 verse 8
[29:07] how all that men would praise the lord
[29:10] for his goodness
[29:11] and his wonderful works to the children
[29:13] of men
[29:14] every one of us can testify today how
[29:17] good god
[29:17] has been in our life god is good to us
[29:25] faith god is faith
[29:30] that's right god is faith he he operates
[29:33] through faith hebrews chapter
[29:34] 11 verse 3 through faith we understand
[29:37] that the worlds were framed
[29:39] by the word of god so that the things
[29:41] which
[29:43] are seen were not made of things which
[29:45] do appear so when god looks at your life
[29:48] and he speaks to you his word
[29:51] you can't see it it's invisible but it
[29:55] will come to pass amen i know the
[29:58] thoughts i think towards you saith the
[30:00] lord
[30:00] you can't see them it does not yet
[30:02] appear
[30:03] but we know when he comes we shall be
[30:06] like him
[30:07] he's going to give us an expected end
[30:10] because he speaks things into existence
[30:14] not just the mountains not just the
[30:16] animals
[30:18] but he's speaking a restored soul
[30:21] into your life today and his word is
[30:25] doing it little by little
[30:27] as you can receive it
[30:30] everything that god does is through
[30:32] faith
[30:33] whatever he speaks will come to pass
[30:36] because he possesses the substance
[30:40] amen that substance is faith isaiah
[30:43] chapter 55 verse 11
[30:45] so shall my word be that goeth forth out
[30:48] of my mouth
[30:49] it shall not return unto me void
[30:53] but it shall accomplish that which i
[30:56] please
[30:56] and it shall prosper in the thing
[30:59] wherein to
[31:00] i sent it now don't we want god to send
[31:03] his word
[31:04] right here send it lord
[31:07] prosper here change my nature
[31:11] because if he only sends it here
[31:17] right knowledge it just puffs you up
[31:20] but true love and i'll say a revelation
[31:25] from god is true love
[31:27] it'll edify it'll edify
[31:32] amen oftentimes you can see god's faith
[31:36] displayed through his longsuffering
[31:40] anybody can love those that are loving
[31:42] them and patent them on the back
[31:45] but what about when you're going through
[31:46] something amen
[31:48] matthew chapter 17 verse 15 lord
[31:53] have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic
[31:56] and sore vaccine oftentimes
[31:58] he falleth into the fire and often into
[32:01] the water
[32:02] and i brought him to thy disciples and
[32:05] they could not
[32:06] cure him
[32:10] imagine how this was making jesus feel
[32:16] then said gee then jesus answered and
[32:19] said
[32:19] all faithless and perverse
[32:23] generation how long shall i
[32:26] be with you how long shall i
[32:30] suffer you bring him hither
[32:33] to me and jesus rebuked the devil and he
[32:37] departed on him and the child was cured
[32:39] from that very
[32:40] hour now notice jesus took care of the
[32:43] problem
[32:44] because he possessed faith
[32:53] i don't need us to straighten things out
[32:58] just fix the problem
[33:04] i know the only way i can fix the
[33:06] problem is if the problem fixer is in me
[33:13] our faith can be on display even
[33:16] during our trials and our sufferings
[33:20] faith isn't just for hey let's pray over
[33:22] this person and watch this thing happen
[33:25] and everybody sees it and it's
[33:26] like this big thing no
[33:32] it's between you and god amen it's god
[33:35] in you
[33:38] god is not a shulman meekness
[33:42] meekness getting down there meekness
[33:44] means
[33:45] humbleness
[33:48] or matthew 11 verse 29 take my
[33:52] yoke upon you god wants us to take
[33:56] something
[33:56] upon us you know when you go to a
[33:59] college or something
[34:00] all you do is you get money and you
[34:03] learn about god
[34:06] no yolk
[34:09] bunch of head knowledge but he said take
[34:12] my yoke upon you
[34:13] it's the only way you can learn of me
[34:17] for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye
[34:20] shall find
[34:21] rest for your souls
[34:26] god is humble born
[34:29] in a manger as the song goes to his own
[34:33] a stranger he lived
[34:36] with a reputation of being illegitimate
[34:41] amen can you imagine him to live your
[34:44] whole life but he never proved anything
[34:46] never run around trying to prove it he
[34:49] let it be
[34:52] isaiah 53 verse 3. isaiah 53 verse 3
[34:56] he was despised
[35:00] he was rejected of men
[35:03] a man of sorrows acquainted with
[35:06] grief and we hid our faces from him
[35:15] he was despised and we
[35:18] esteemed him not
[35:22] so as this man
[35:26] that was all god stood
[35:31] and every time we heard about jesus
[35:34] oh we just wanted a hotter face
[35:37] we just wanted to run we didn't want to
[35:39] hear it
[35:40] he was despised and we didn't even care
[35:44] we didn't even esteem him look what
[35:47] happened
[35:48] when he walked but yet it happened in
[35:51] our life as well
[35:53] surely he bore greece and he carried our
[35:56] sorrows
[35:56] yet we did esteem him stricken
[36:00] stricken smitten of god inflicted
[36:03] in other words that he hung there on the
[36:07] cross
[36:08] and they said he's getting
[36:12] what he deserves
[36:15] yes that's what this is saying
[36:22] but he was wounded for our
[36:25] transgressions
[36:26] he was bruised for our iniquities it
[36:29] wasn't yet what he deserved
[36:32] he was taking it for us the chastisement
[36:36] of our peace was upon him
[36:37] and with his tribes we are
[36:40] healed we just got to claim it don't let
[36:44] the devil keep telling you
[36:45] no just say i'm standing on him
[36:48] he died for me in 2020
[36:52] he bore those stripes for me in 2020
[36:57] wasn't just for the past they go all the
[37:00] way up
[37:01] amen to the rapture
[37:06] all we like sheep have gone astray
[37:10] we have turned every one of his all
[37:13] uh everyone to his own way
[37:17] and the lord laid on him
[37:20] the iniquity of us all
[37:24] you talk about the love of god
[37:28] he was oppressed he was afflicted
[37:33] yet he opened not his mouth
[37:36] now we're talking about the meekness of
[37:38] god here
[37:40] he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter
[37:43] and as the sheep before his shears is
[37:46] dumb
[37:47] so he opened not his mouth
[37:51] god is meek
[37:54] god is humble we need to take more time
[37:58] to learn about god so we can know what
[38:00] we need to be
[38:03] temperance simply means self-control
[38:09] god is in control
[38:13] he knows he's in control
[38:18] so he just simply controls himself
[38:24] he knows nothing is out of control so
[38:26] there's no need to get really
[38:28] bothered in fact ephesians chapter 1
[38:32] verse 11 tells us
[38:33] that god worketh all things after the
[38:36] council
[38:37] of his will so when we when we look at
[38:40] this world
[38:42] we look at all just everything whether
[38:44] it's the
[38:46] the wars and the pandemic and whether we
[38:49] should do this
[38:50] and whether we should do that and the
[38:52] rise of this and the
[38:53] politics and all it just wow it looks
[38:57] like such a mess
[39:01] like if i was of the world i guess i
[39:04] would get excited
[39:06] when our president would say we're
[39:08] beefing up our
[39:09] army we got more tanks we got more guns
[39:12] we've got
[39:13] but i am not of this world that doesn't
[39:16] appeal to me
[39:22] but in the midst of all the chaos that
[39:24] we look at
[39:25] in the world god has got it under
[39:28] control
[39:29] god is still making everything work out
[39:32] for his purpose
[39:34] that's how much he's in control
[39:39] pharaoh was just a tool that god used to
[39:43] get glory
[39:44] for himself think about all the plagues
[39:48] and
[39:49] the crossing over the red sea
[39:52] all this that that moses really didn't
[39:55] know
[39:56] what was going on he had to walk by
[39:59] faith one step at a time
[40:01] until god showed him but god
[40:04] was in control
[40:10] wants total control of the church
[40:17] because this is a place where it's free
[40:18] more agency we can sit here and yield
[40:21] our heart and yield our life
[40:23] or we can sit here just like a bump on a
[40:25] log and say
[40:26] i'm not going any further than my church
[40:28] attendance
[40:31] colossians chapter 1 verse 16.
[40:34] colossians chapter 1 verse 16 for by him
[40:37] were all things created
[40:41] that are in heaven that are in the earth
[40:44] visible and invisible whether they be
[40:46] thrones or dominions or principalities
[40:48] or powers
[40:49] all things were created by him and
[40:52] for him i i'm thinking that
[40:56] that includes me and he
[40:59] is before all things and by him all
[41:02] things consist
[41:03] and he is the head of the body
[41:06] the church praise god send the light
[41:10] amen amen who is the beginning the
[41:14] firstborn of the dead
[41:15] that in all things he might have
[41:19] what the preeminence
[41:23] he wants to be more than just a picture
[41:25] on a wall at church
[41:28] he wants more than just to be able
[41:31] to to to be uh songs in the book that we
[41:35] sing about
[41:36] he wants he wants it to be more than
[41:39] just
[41:39] reading from the bible
[41:43] he don't want just the sermon to just be
[41:46] preached
[41:46] uh about him
[41:50] no sir he wants the preeminence
[41:53] in the heart of his church
[41:56] wow this this responsibility just got
[41:59] off of the pulpit
[42:01] and it went into the congregation
[42:05] i can't make that for you and i'll tell
[42:08] you
[42:08] if i could i'd spend thousands tens of
[42:12] thousands i'd spend hundreds of
[42:13] thousands of dollars to get you
[42:15] entertainment in here to get god to be
[42:17] preeminent in your life but god would
[42:19] never get preeminent in your life doing
[42:21] that
[42:24] it's about your seriousness with god
[42:34] now when believers don't want to give
[42:37] god
[42:38] preeminence
[42:42] or things are out of control in the
[42:44] church
[42:46] that ever happened
[42:49] god doesn't force his control
[42:52] listen to me he has self-control
[42:57] he displays a temperance
[43:00] so how does god take control what does
[43:02] he do he
[43:04] leads and guides us back into
[43:07] order
[43:10] how does he do it he works on our hearts
[43:14] he deals with our hearts he takes
[43:17] preeminence
[43:20] he does everything decently and in order
[43:23] he's an awesome god i love the nature of
[43:26] god god is love
[43:28] joy peace long-suffering gentleness
[43:30] goodness faith meekness temperance
[43:32] against such there is no law
[43:36] there's no law against the nature of god
[43:41] how can there be anything against the
[43:43] nature of god
[43:45] god is every one of these this is the
[43:49] living spirit of god that's bearing its
[43:52] own
[43:52] fruit every single one of these
[43:55] they are the fruit of god now we are
[43:58] promised the same holy spirit
[44:01] if we repent we get baptized and i'll
[44:04] tell you
[44:05] sometimes there's things in her life
[44:08] from the time you get baptized
[44:11] you are going to prove your repentance
[44:19] we're told if we're baptized a sinner
[44:23] will come up a wet center
[44:27] now it is not for me to ever judge
[44:30] another man
[44:32] these are for you
[44:36] but i'm going to tell you your life is
[44:38] going to prove where you're at
[44:43] and that's why it'd be good for us to
[44:44] judge ourselves
[44:46] using this precious word i want to
[44:49] encourage
[44:50] every one of us today to seek more of
[44:52] the holy spirit
[44:54] we are promised the same holy spirit
[44:57] that we just read about
[45:00] amen i think we can become too content
[45:04] with how much of god's spirit we really
[45:06] have
[45:09] too satisfied with just saying oh i've
[45:12] got the holy ghost
[45:16] or trying to make others think
[45:19] and believe that you got it
[45:23] oh yeah i've got the holy spirit
[45:27] no one can talk me out of it
[45:30] i know it i know i for sure got it
[45:34] and sometimes the believers can get
[45:36] offended when you challenge them
[45:38] about something that's going on in their
[45:40] life
[45:43] the fact is most of the time believers
[45:47] don't even pay attention
[45:48] to their own fruit
[45:52] of their spirit
[45:56] many times they feel completely
[45:57] justified defending
[45:59] the things that they've said the actions
[46:02] they've taken the behavior they've
[46:04] displayed
[46:06] just as if the holy ghost inside of them
[46:08] was doing it
[46:12] wow too many believers ignore
[46:15] their own spirit they
[46:18] ignore the fruit of their own spirit
[46:23] now i'm so glad that jesus taught us
[46:26] we shall know what's going on by the
[46:28] fruit that's being born
[46:34] you can know a lot what's going on by
[46:36] the fruit that's coming forth
[46:40] james told us you can't get sweet water
[46:43] and
[46:44] bitter water coming from the same
[46:47] fountain
[46:51] i don't see anything in these fruits
[46:53] that's talking about uh
[46:56] dinner
[46:59] now look at these these are all sweet
[47:02] love
[47:02] joy peace i just want to be filled with
[47:06] them
[47:09] now we can start moving away from that
[47:12] type of thinking
[47:13] of all that matters is that i can just
[47:16] stand and say i've got the holy ghost
[47:20] there's no need to brag about how much
[47:22] holy spirit we have
[47:25] all that we need to do is start bearing
[47:27] the actual fruit
[47:28] of the spirit for everyone to see
[47:33] and for everyone to partake of you see
[47:35] because the fruit of the holy spirit
[47:37] is for others the seed is in the fruit
[47:41] and when they see the life they're going
[47:43] to want the seed they're going to want
[47:44] to eat that
[47:45] and when they eat it they've got to eat
[47:46] the word because the fruit comes from
[47:49] the word
[47:51] jesus is the word
[47:57] people don't want my love
[48:01] people don't want your love they don't
[48:04] want your joy your peace
[48:06] why because it's limited
[48:12] they can get that anywhere what people
[48:15] really want to see is the fruit of god
[48:18] in your life
[48:20] that never stops that endures all things
[48:24] that
[48:24] that believeth all things that hopeth
[48:26] all things that's that stands the test
[48:29] that has
[48:29] the temperance the patience the love the
[48:32] joy the peace
[48:33] that god has that's what people are
[48:35] looking for
[48:37] the fruit of god is for others to eat
[48:39] and live
[48:42] the holy spirit inside of us will bear
[48:45] the same fruit
[48:46] of god's spirit amen now
[48:50] i really want that to sink home because
[48:54] jesus is the same yesterday today and
[48:57] forever
[48:58] if that same spirit that we just read
[49:02] about lives in us
[49:03] it can't but help to bear the same fruit
[49:09] and if it's not it's up to you
[49:12] to ask for more don't just say
[49:16] i got it anyways
[49:20] just ask god for more
[49:24] it will automatically bear sheep
[49:27] don't have to force to grow the wall it
[49:30] just
[49:30] bears it it's an automatic
[49:35] god don't try to bear these fruits
[49:38] they're just automatic
[49:42] now there's a lot of spirits out in the
[49:44] world they try to mimic
[49:46] the holy ghost when it speaks to us
[49:49] first john chapter 4 verse 1. and if you
[49:52] would
[49:53] i'd like to go to this one on the screen
[49:54] if i could at least to kind of pay
[49:56] attention this
[49:57] beloved don't believe every spirit that
[49:59] speaks to you
[50:02] but try the spirit whether it's of god
[50:06] because many false spirits are gone out
[50:10] into
[50:11] the world in other words it's not
[50:14] trying to be a respecter of persons the
[50:16] devil's seeking whom he may devour
[50:19] whoever he can get so how do i know
[50:23] what's speaking to me
[50:25] hereby know ye the spirit of god
[50:28] every spirit that confesseth that jesus
[50:31] has come into your flesh
[50:33] is of god in other words if your flesh
[50:36] is bearing the fruit of the spirit
[50:40] then go on and say what you're saying
[50:43] act the way you're acting
[50:44] do what you're doing but if it's not you
[50:47] pay attention to that spirit
[50:53] because if god's spirit isn't in my
[50:55] flesh the but let's read it and every
[50:57] spirit that confesseth
[50:58] not if your spirit is not confessing
[51:01] jesus christ has come into your flesh
[51:04] it is not of god now notice what's
[51:06] confessing
[51:07] it's the spirit it is not the words
[51:10] it's not your ideas it's the spirit
[51:13] that's coming forth
[51:18] and this is that spirit of antichrist
[51:22] wherever you have heard that it should
[51:23] come and even now already is in the
[51:25] world
[51:26] ye are of god little children and you've
[51:29] overcome those spirits
[51:30] that lie to you why because there's
[51:33] something greater in you
[51:35] than he that is in the world in other
[51:38] words the spirit that's inside of you
[51:40] is bearing god's fruit
[51:45] you know to me it doesn't matter how
[51:47] much i confess i've got the holy spirit
[51:49] i am not going to be satisfied until i
[51:51] awake in his likeness
[51:53] until i'm bearing the fruit of the holy
[51:55] ghost that's all that matters
[51:58] and the thing is i can't tell if i'm
[52:00] bearing it until i go through a trial
[52:02] until i go through a test and then it
[52:05] really shows what i got
[52:07] shows what the tea bags ready made when
[52:09] i get in the hot water
[52:13] we are of god
[52:17] verse 4 ye are of god little children
[52:19] and have overcome them because greater
[52:21] is he that is in you that he that is in
[52:22] the world
[52:23] they are of the world therefore they
[52:24] speak of the world
[52:26] and the world heareth them
[52:29] you know so many people get you know
[52:31] we've had
[52:32] i don't just speak it's history bill
[52:34] clinton got up and said i'm born again
[52:38] and you know what the world here with
[52:40] them
[52:42] the world here with them a lot of people
[52:45] oh i got the holy ghost i got the holy
[52:46] ghost
[52:47] people here the world heareth them
[52:50] but the bride sees the fruit
[52:54] because jesus taught us by their fruit
[52:56] you shall know them
[52:58] and there's a lot of false spirits there
[53:01] going out there
[53:01] lying to the church all you got to do is
[53:05] speak in tongues
[53:06] just one time that's the proof
[53:17] we are so blessed
[53:21] today
[53:25] because we have a revelation
[53:29] of the truth
[53:32] it should put us in debt to the lord
[53:35] amen
[53:37] that we should want to get the truth to
[53:40] somebody
[53:43] and it it takes time
[53:46] you got to lay season you got to keep it
[53:48] going keep it going
[53:51] we are of god and he that knoweth god
[53:53] heareth us and he
[53:54] that and he that is not of god here is
[53:56] not us
[53:58] you know you've got the truth
[54:01] somebody rejects you they're rejecting
[54:04] god
[54:04] think about that you hold the word of
[54:07] truth
[54:08] inside of you you have a treasure in
[54:10] earth and vessels amen
[54:13] hereby know we the spirit of truth and
[54:15] the spirit of air
[54:18] wow you know i remember going to school
[54:22] and they've just always used to be
[54:24] afraid of taking tests
[54:28] i need to continue preaching not talk
[54:30] about my stories because it's getting
[54:31] late
[54:33] but i was always afraid
[54:37] i don't know if i know it but when you
[54:40] know the spirit of god is in you
[54:42] you don't have to worry about
[54:43] controlling yourself
[54:46] because god's inside you doing it
[54:52] fear is gone perfect love casts out all
[54:54] fear amen
[54:56] the fruits ought to be for our lives
[54:59] saints
[55:00] and we need to keep pressing in to them
[55:03] until
[55:04] we see them manifest in their life
[55:07] the fruit of the spirit is love
[55:11] first or saint john 3 16 for god so
[55:14] loved the world that he gave his only
[55:16] begotten son
[55:17] that showing god's love but first john
[55:20] chapter 3
[55:22] says that we he lay down his life for us
[55:26] we ought to lay down our lives for the
[55:27] brethren
[55:28] hereby is
[55:33] hereby we perceive we the love of god we
[55:36] perceive god's love in one another
[55:38] when we see them lay down their life for
[55:41] one another
[55:42] i'm sorry that's scripture anything else
[55:45] is not scripture to me
[55:48] you know we want about to treat anybody
[55:50] any old way we want to
[55:51] and say we've got the love of god i
[55:53] can't see that in the bible
[55:56] i see that we're blind the bible says
[55:58] i'm blind
[56:02] i want to perceive god's love in every
[56:04] single one of you
[56:06] i want to perceive it and you perceive
[56:10] it too
[56:11] we all are written epistles read of all
[56:14] men
[56:15] scene of all men we don't have to open
[56:17] our mouth and we're talking
[56:24] now love inside of us will
[56:27] not think ill of his neighbor
[56:31] will not talk behind their back well not
[56:33] gossip about somebody
[56:35] is not going to badger someone's
[56:37] testimony or reputation
[56:40] the love of god inside of us will lay
[56:42] down our life for everyone
[56:44] jesus gave us the great commandment that
[56:46] we love one another
[56:48] as he has loved us brother branham says
[56:51] that we need to get to the spot
[56:52] to where we can love everyone the same
[56:55] get to the place
[56:56] it's not just talk now but when you're
[56:59] tested
[57:00] and your life proves out that you got it
[57:04] by this fruit of god shall all mankind
[57:07] know that you're a disciple of christ
[57:09] when you have god's great love what on
[57:12] display on display
[57:15] by the same manifestation
[57:18] of his love when you're laying down your
[57:22] life for somebody
[57:23] for a for mankind for a soul
[57:27] to help somebody's character
[57:32] joy well we heard a lot about joy on
[57:35] wednesday
[57:36] the difference between god's joy and our
[57:39] own joy
[57:41] we learned where it comes from and how
[57:43] to get it
[57:44] we learned how important and how
[57:45] powerful it is
[57:47] that the joy of the lord is our strength
[57:49] we've also learned
[57:50] that we have to stay connected to the
[57:52] vine and keep his commandments
[57:54] in order for god's joy to remain with us
[57:57] amen
[57:58] and we have a god-given promise that
[58:02] our sorrow will return into joy i want
[58:04] to read it
[58:05] john chapter 16 verse 20 verily verily i
[58:08] say unto you
[58:10] that ye shall weep and lament and the
[58:13] world will rejoice
[58:15] the world will rejoice and ye shall be
[58:18] sorrowful
[58:20] but your sorrow shall be turned
[58:23] into joy there's something
[58:27] about god wanting
[58:30] he has compassion on those
[58:35] that are out of the way
[58:38] he wants to revive him something about
[58:40] inside of god he just wants to help
[58:41] people
[58:45] a woman when she is in travail have
[58:47] sorrow because your hours come
[58:50] but as soon as she is delivered of the
[58:51] child she remembers no more the anguish
[58:54] for joy that a man is born into the
[58:57] world
[58:58] praise god and ye
[59:01] now uh and ye
[59:04] now therefore have sorrow but i
[59:08] will see you again and your heart
[59:11] shall rejoice and your joy no man
[59:15] taketh from you think about that
[59:19] blessed are the pure in heart
[59:22] for they shall see god
[59:26] you want to see god today you the only
[59:30] way you can really see god is
[59:32] to get a revelation from him
[59:35] that's where you see god clearly you
[59:38] want to see god clearly
[59:39] he's interested in the heart blessed are
[59:42] the pure
[59:43] in heart for they shall see god and i'll
[59:45] tell you when god gives you a revelation
[59:47] you've got joy it does not matter if
[59:50] that revelation tells you
[59:52] you need to lay down your life more you
[59:53] need to pray more i'm telling you
[59:55] there'll be
[59:56] tears of joy flowing because you're
[59:58] seeing god
[59:59] face to face david said i want to get to
[1:00:03] the house of the lord i want to behold
[1:00:04] the beauty of the lord in the temple
[1:00:06] i want to see it with my eyes
[1:00:09] we're not looking at the outside we're
[1:00:11] not looking for some entertainment or
[1:00:13] how smooth
[1:00:14] the the service goes we're looking to
[1:00:17] see
[1:00:17] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:00:20] and forever
[1:00:20] revealing his words in our hearts
[1:00:24] that's the beauty i want to see
[1:00:30] peace when jesus ascended on high
[1:00:33] he didn't take his peace with him he
[1:00:36] didn't say
[1:00:37] sorry buds i'm taking this with me no
[1:00:40] sir
[1:00:41] john 14 27 saint john 14 27
[1:00:45] peace i leave with you
[1:00:49] my peace i give unto you
[1:00:53] not as the world giveth give i unto you
[1:00:56] let not your heart be troubled
[1:00:58] neither let it be afraid
[1:01:01] god left his peace for the church
[1:01:07] he left it for his children he left it
[1:01:10] for his wife
[1:01:13] we need the peace of god in our church
[1:01:15] we
[1:01:16] and i'll tell you this is how you get it
[1:01:18] get the peace of god in your heart
[1:01:22] john 16 33 these things have i
[1:01:25] spoken unto you that ye might have
[1:01:28] peace what things in the world
[1:01:32] you're gonna have a lot of problems but
[1:01:35] be of good cheer
[1:01:36] i've overcome the world and if i live in
[1:01:39] you you ain't got nothing to worry about
[1:01:41] i've got it all under control
[1:01:45] ephesians chapter 2 verse 14 he is
[1:01:48] our peace amen he
[1:01:51] is our peace so when we don't got peace
[1:01:56] just get in god's presence i'll tell you
[1:01:59] there's one thing that has always helped
[1:02:01] me
[1:02:03] is prayer it doesn't always change the
[1:02:07] circumstance
[1:02:09] but it changed what's happening right
[1:02:10] here it changes how
[1:02:12] i see and i react to what's happening
[1:02:15] out here
[1:02:16] isaiah 55 verse 12 for ye shall
[1:02:20] go out with joy and be
[1:02:23] led forth what with peace
[1:02:27] i wish i had time to teach this and i
[1:02:30] don't
[1:02:32] but maybe you could go back and get into
[1:02:34] dig into it
[1:02:36] too often we're not led by the right
[1:02:38] spirit
[1:02:40] but we need to be led with peace the
[1:02:42] mountains and the hills shall break
[1:02:44] forth until singing and all the trees of
[1:02:46] the field
[1:02:47] shall clap their hands amen
[1:02:52] matthew 5 9 blessed are the peacemakers
[1:02:57] for those are the ones that are going to
[1:02:59] be called the children of god
[1:03:02] a peacemaker i certainly don't want to
[1:03:05] be guilty
[1:03:07] of starting a fight
[1:03:16] but i want to be a peacemaker
[1:03:20] in order to be a peacemaker i got to get
[1:03:21] my hands dirty
[1:03:24] because there already is in peace i
[1:03:27] gotta make it
[1:03:29] to get my hands dirty i may look
[1:03:32] bad in both parties eyes
[1:03:40] but eventually when there's peace
[1:03:43] they may completely forget about me and
[1:03:46] that's okay
[1:03:49] as long as god doesn't forget
[1:03:53] you know a lot of times god's done stuff
[1:03:55] for people
[1:03:56] there were nine lepers one time they got
[1:03:59] healed
[1:04:00] all nine of them didn't come back
[1:04:03] but there was one there was one that was
[1:04:07] grateful
[1:04:08] there was one that was thankful there
[1:04:10] was one that wanted to give god
[1:04:12] more
[1:04:17] and god he really shined the light on
[1:04:20] his
[1:04:20] character when he said were there not
[1:04:22] ten
[1:04:23] where are the other nine
[1:04:28] god deserves to give to be given all the
[1:04:31] praise as often as we can
[1:04:33] for everything he does for us
[1:04:36] count your blessings name them one by
[1:04:38] one it will surprise you what god has
[1:04:40] done
[1:04:41] long suffering no one wants to suffer
[1:04:45] everyone wants to sit at the table next
[1:04:48] to jesus
[1:04:50] jesus his response to that was
[1:04:54] can you drink the cup that i drink
[1:04:58] when somebody wanted to sit next to
[1:05:00] jesus on the other side
[1:05:01] well that cup was a cup of suffering
[1:05:05] we all want to be next to jesus but
[1:05:07] nobody wants to suffer
[1:05:09] if we don't suffer with him we don't
[1:05:10] reign with him
[1:05:12] if we're not willing to to to lay down
[1:05:14] our life so that christ can be
[1:05:16] seen by others how is god going to look
[1:05:18] at that and say you know what i want to
[1:05:20] be by that
[1:05:21] because that's exactly what jesus did
[1:05:23] for you
[1:05:25] i am telling you this is a fruit of the
[1:05:27] holy ghost
[1:05:28] it may not be a fruit of our life and we
[1:05:30] may not want to suffer and i
[1:05:32] understand that but if christ is in you
[1:05:34] he will suffer
[1:05:36] he will gladly lay down his life he will
[1:05:38] gladly take the
[1:05:40] blood for something he didn't do wrong
[1:05:44] and he'll take it patiently and this is
[1:05:46] acceptable with god
[1:05:48] but if you've got to prove who's right
[1:05:50] all the time i say there's something
[1:05:52] wrong with your spirit
[1:05:53] there is something wrong with it
[1:05:57] you know many times god is buffeted and
[1:05:59] turned away and
[1:06:01] discredited men take glory from god all
[1:06:04] the time
[1:06:06] just let them do it
[1:06:11] the spirit of god and a human being i'm
[1:06:14] telling you
[1:06:15] it will change our nature we will become
[1:06:18] like
[1:06:18] jesus christ because he is the same
[1:06:21] yesterday today and forever
[1:06:22] if that same spirit that rose jesus
[1:06:24] christ from the dead
[1:06:26] quickens your moral body lives inside
[1:06:28] your body it'll quicken your nature
[1:06:30] it'll make you just like jesus and you
[1:06:33] can't do nothing about it
[1:06:35] you'll get slapped in the face and you
[1:06:37] won't even have a thought well i'll tell
[1:06:39] you if i had
[1:06:43] something inside he says oh god forgive
[1:06:45] they don't know what they're doing
[1:06:48] i'll give one more chance peter in the
[1:06:51] flesh said
[1:06:53] seven times
[1:06:56] seven times what are you talking about
[1:06:59] that's not the right
[1:07:00] spirit seven times 70 is the right
[1:07:03] spirit
[1:07:10] it's not us trying to build
[1:07:15] is us displaying what we are yeah
[1:07:19] that's what's happening
[1:07:24] to the spiritual eye it's not hard to
[1:07:27] see
[1:07:29] when jesus said you shall know them by
[1:07:31] their fruits
[1:07:32] i don't listen to a people's to a
[1:07:34] person's words
[1:07:39] i'll sure pay attention to the fruit
[1:07:41] they're barren
[1:07:45] because words are deceiving
[1:07:49] but you know satan used them on jesus
[1:07:53] to try to trick him
[1:07:57] you know he's used them on me and he has
[1:07:59] deceived me
[1:08:04] you know the elect won't be deceived but
[1:08:07] did you know
[1:08:09] until the rapture they can be
[1:08:16] the thing about being elect eventually
[1:08:18] you're going to come out of whatever
[1:08:19] deception you've been in
[1:08:22] that's the beauty about being elected
[1:08:26] it's not being so perfect today
[1:08:30] you know saints i am like so sorry i
[1:08:33] i i don't know what time i started but
[1:08:37] i'm nowhere near going through
[1:08:40] and i just feel
[1:08:44] always bad about taking too long i just
[1:08:52] say if anybody
[1:08:53] feels you know to leave then i want you
[1:08:55] to feel
[1:08:56] that liberty i don't want you to feel
[1:08:59] forced to stay here for any
[1:09:01] any reason but i do believe and i
[1:09:05] from the beginning of the service i know
[1:09:08] god is
[1:09:08] in this and he has this
[1:09:12] for the hearts of those that are his
[1:09:15] amen
[1:09:15] i believe that
[1:09:19] first peter chapter 2 verse 21
[1:09:22] for even her and two were you called
[1:09:24] because christ also suffered for us
[1:09:26] leaving us an example that we need to
[1:09:29] follow his steps
[1:09:32] you know too many people they're like
[1:09:36] oh that that's a step of suffering oh
[1:09:38] i'm getting over that one
[1:09:42] they don't want to follow his steps
[1:09:48] second timothy chapter 2 verse 29
[1:09:50] wherein i suffer trouble
[1:09:51] even as an evil doer unto my bonds but
[1:09:53] the word of god is not bound therefore
[1:09:56] i endure all things from my brother
[1:10:00] from my sister well they're not even in
[1:10:02] the message it doesn't they could be the
[1:10:04] elect's sake
[1:10:07] i endure a bunch of junk for the elect's
[1:10:10] sake
[1:10:14] that they may also obtain the salvation
[1:10:17] which is in christ jesus
[1:10:19] with eternal glory it is a faithful
[1:10:22] saiyan for if we be dead with him we
[1:10:23] should also
[1:10:24] live with him if we suffer we shall also
[1:10:27] reign if we deny him
[1:10:28] or deny us i don't want to deny the lord
[1:10:34] if i step over that step of suffering
[1:10:37] i'm denying him come on
[1:10:42] if he's like he led jesus to the
[1:10:44] slaughter
[1:10:48] we gotta cross the bear too if we're
[1:10:51] gonna just oh let this cut pass from me
[1:10:54] how are we going to be a partaker
[1:10:59] amen of long suffering i mean
[1:11:03] you don't have to be a christian people
[1:11:05] are suffering like crazy out there in
[1:11:06] the world
[1:11:08] but they're not suffering as a christian
[1:11:12] there's no character involved there's no
[1:11:15] building there's
[1:11:15] no purpose they re they they resent the
[1:11:18] fact that they're suffering
[1:11:22] they can't see the elect's sake they
[1:11:25] can't see a reason
[1:11:26] to lay down their life to reach out
[1:11:29] to to go the second mile because they're
[1:11:32] blind
[1:11:37] help us lord gentleness the holy spirit
[1:11:40] inside of a human being
[1:11:43] will be a gentle
[1:11:46] lamb nature
[1:11:51] nobody wants to be around somebody
[1:11:55] that you're scared
[1:11:59] you're afraid
[1:12:04] but a gentle nature yeah easy to being
[1:12:07] treated sounds like the wisdom of god
[1:12:11] matthew 10 verse 16. now we live in a
[1:12:14] real bad world out here right
[1:12:18] put yourself where jesus is speaking to
[1:12:21] your heart right now
[1:12:22] behold i send you forth
[1:12:25] as sheeps as sheeps no as sheep
[1:12:29] in the midst of wolves
[1:12:33] now that's a scary situation right there
[1:12:36] listen i don't want you to get your
[1:12:38] baseball bats out i don't want you to
[1:12:40] get your boxing gloves on i don't want
[1:12:41] you to get your machine guns
[1:12:45] be ye therefore wise as serpents and
[1:12:50] harmless as dubs
[1:12:54] because if god is in you you have
[1:12:56] nothing to worry about
[1:13:01] but if god ain't with you you know
[1:13:04] i don't think there's enough guns you
[1:13:06] can carry
[1:13:10] he says but be aware of men
[1:13:14] for they will deliver you up to council
[1:13:18] and they will scourge you right in
[1:13:21] their church
[1:13:29] what's the evidence why is this a
[1:13:33] serpent
[1:13:35] harmless as a delft that's what the holy
[1:13:38] spirit's for
[1:13:42] god will work it out he
[1:13:46] tell them take no thought what you will

[1:14:18] second timothy chapter 2 verse 24
[1:14:23] and the serpent of the lord how many is
[1:14:26] a servant of god today praise god
[1:14:29] and the servant of the lord must not
[1:14:32] strive that means quarrel
[1:14:36] dispute or fight
[1:14:40] but be gentle
[1:14:43] unto all men apt
[1:14:46] to teach patient
[1:14:51] patient
[1:14:54] god work it out that's what the patience
[1:14:56] is for i have to teach
[1:15:00] sometimes i don't know what to do
[1:15:02] sometimes i don't know what to say
[1:15:05] you know what that does drives me to
[1:15:07] prayer
[1:15:09] that's where i need to be i need to get
[1:15:11] with the instructor
[1:15:14] he's the professor he's the captain of
[1:15:17] our salvation
[1:15:18] he's the rock amen he's all i need
[1:15:24] chapter 3 verse 2
[1:15:27] to speak evil of no man
[1:15:30] to be no brawlers but gentle
[1:15:35] showing all meekness unto your best
[1:15:39] friends
[1:15:42] oh that's not i'm sorry unto all men
[1:15:45] what about the evil men the mean men
[1:15:49] the forward i think the bible tells me
[1:15:52] that i'm supposed to be subject to the
[1:15:54] forward not like just the good bosses
[1:15:59] all men god wants us representing him he
[1:16:03] does not really care about what problem
[1:16:05] that we're in
[1:16:07] we all want to whine complain about our
[1:16:09] problems
[1:16:10] well you know you you anybody come up
[1:16:13] here
[1:16:14] and tell me who's got the biggest
[1:16:15] problem in the church who's got the
[1:16:17] worst one
[1:16:21] because as soon as you determine which
[1:16:23] is that it's going to change in about
[1:16:25] an hour
[1:16:28] so god is not interested in that he's
[1:16:32] interested in being on display in those
[1:16:34] problems
[1:16:37] that's what he wants he wants a
[1:16:38] preeminence in that situation
[1:16:42] you can't be let god have preeminence if
[1:16:45] you're not willing
[1:16:46] to suffer if you're not willing to be
[1:16:48] gentle if you're not willing to be meek
[1:16:49] and humble and
[1:16:50] lay down your life amen
[1:16:54] goodness proverbs 20 verse 6 most men
[1:16:57] will proclaim
[1:16:58] everyone his own goodness
[1:17:02] but a faithful man who can find
[1:17:09] one who displays
[1:17:14] god who
[1:17:16] the one who displays the goodness of god
[1:17:19] that's a faithful man but a man that
[1:17:22] displays his own goodness
[1:17:25] proclaims his own goodness that's not
[1:17:28] faithful
[1:17:30] everybody wants to do that romans
[1:17:33] chapter 2 verse 3
[1:17:35] and think as thou this old man that
[1:17:37] judgeth them
[1:17:38] which do such things and do us the same
[1:17:43] how in the world are you going to escape
[1:17:44] the judgment of god
[1:17:47] or despises thou the riches
[1:17:51] of his goodness and forbearance
[1:17:55] and long-suffering you know sometimes we
[1:17:57] just despise
[1:17:58] having to be long suffering despising
[1:18:01] to be forbearance with somebody
[1:18:03] despising to be
[1:18:04] good to your enemy like jesus taught us
[1:18:07] to
[1:18:09] not knowing this is the ignorance not
[1:18:12] knowing it's the goodness of god that
[1:18:15] leads
[1:18:16] a man to repentance
[1:18:21] it's the very goodness of god that turns
[1:18:23] people around
[1:18:25] it's not his threats right
[1:18:29] when they came against him he didn't
[1:18:31] threaten back
[1:18:34] when you're trying to turn somebody
[1:18:36] around or lead them in a better way
[1:18:39] be good to them be good to them
[1:18:42] it's the goodness of god that can turn
[1:18:44] the situation around
[1:18:48] faith hebrews chapter 11 verse says
[1:18:51] without faith
[1:18:52] we can't even make god happy
[1:18:58] you ever try to do some for somebody and
[1:19:00] they just can't seem to get happy with
[1:19:02] it
[1:19:03] no matter what you do we've all been in
[1:19:06] that spot i did what you asked me to do
[1:19:09] i
[1:19:09] you're still not happy
[1:19:14] god will not be happy with us until we
[1:19:17] believe him
[1:19:21] we can't stay in a in a mental
[1:19:24] spiritual frame of mind that's filled
[1:19:27] with
[1:19:28] doubt or or or negative thinking or
[1:19:31] double-minded
[1:19:32] the bible says let not that man think
[1:19:35] that he'll receive anything of the lord
[1:19:39] we've got to believe the word i don't
[1:19:41] know if i can live it god is not
[1:19:42] asking you to to
[1:19:46] to uh prophesy the future just say
[1:19:49] amen to the word amen to the word
[1:19:52] be like that barber yeah
[1:19:55] uh read all about it
[1:20:00] i can see blind is a bat yeah but still
[1:20:04] testifying
[1:20:05] is faith amen
[1:20:08] amen i just say brother ben testify more
[1:20:11] of what god's doing what you've already
[1:20:14] prayed for
[1:20:15] believe it believe it testify stand
[1:20:19] on it there's a period there that after
[1:20:22] you get prayed for
[1:20:24] god's gonna god wants to see if you're
[1:20:26] gonna testify
[1:20:27] of what you've already prayed for
[1:20:34] jesus said they think they'll be heard
[1:20:36] for their much speaking
[1:20:39] but you're really going to be hurt for
[1:20:40] your much faith
[1:20:46] sometimes the prophet has said this if
[1:20:48] you pray over and over it weakens your
[1:20:51] faith
[1:20:56] what you need to do is be testifying
[1:21:00] of your faith i believe
[1:21:03] by not allowing doubt to come in and
[1:21:05] cloud your thoughts in
[1:21:07] in imagination you got to possess the
[1:21:10] gate of the enemy amen
[1:21:11] you got to stand there and say this is
[1:21:13] mine
[1:21:15] give me this mountain i'm a i'm a i'm a
[1:21:18] seed of god
[1:21:19] i'm with joshua and caleb i'm not with
[1:21:21] all those that are questioning
[1:21:23] they're doubting they're full of fear i
[1:21:25] stand
[1:21:26] with god's chosen few
[1:21:29] we're children of abraham
[1:21:35] the bible says we're saved by faith
[1:21:38] the bible says we live by faith
[1:21:46] the only way god's going to be happy
[1:21:47] with us galatians 2 verse 20
[1:21:51] i am crucified with christ nevertheless
[1:21:54] i lived
[1:21:55] yet not i but it's christ that liveth in
[1:21:58] me
[1:22:00] so paul was actually saying here because
[1:22:02] he's the one that wrote this to the
[1:22:04] galatians
[1:22:07] these fruits that i'm bearing this
[1:22:08] ability
[1:22:10] to lay down my life to get stoned and
[1:22:14] whipped and kicked and talked of and
[1:22:17] deceived by
[1:22:18] my own brethren in the
[1:22:23] he church it's not me it's not me and my
[1:22:26] moral ability to
[1:22:28] to be something no
[1:22:32] it's christ he's living in me
[1:22:39] that's why it's so important to seek the
[1:22:42] holy ghost
[1:22:44] you get that you get the whole package
[1:22:48] you get the benefits
[1:22:50] [Music]
[1:22:51] you know some some people they don't
[1:22:54] even care about the money
[1:22:55] they just want the benefits get that
[1:22:58] health insurance you know get the
[1:22:59] retirement get the aflac
[1:23:04] 401k matching funds
[1:23:09] tell you this honestly you know this
[1:23:11] work doesn't pay very good here
[1:23:13] but the benefits are out of this world
[1:23:16] get the holy ghost you got the benefits
[1:23:20] who cares about saying i got it your
[1:23:23] life will be able to display it nobody
[1:23:24] will bow to deny it
[1:23:29] that will speak louder than your words
[1:23:37] faith comes from god
[1:23:41] it does not come from the pulpit
[1:23:47] flesh and blood does not reveal to you
[1:23:49] the word
[1:23:52] it's god and you while the word is
[1:23:55] coming
[1:23:56] where are you in god when the word is
[1:23:58] being preached
[1:24:00] because that's faith faith is a
[1:24:03] revelation
[1:24:06] all things are possible to them
[1:24:09] that believe well i have this need
[1:24:14] believe believe
[1:24:17] i believe testify
[1:24:20] stan don't let satan come well he's just
[1:24:23] you know this is just not
[1:24:24] my thing
[1:24:28] right it's impossible for any minister
[1:24:31] up here
[1:24:32] to get any to get everybody's thing
[1:24:37] right let's all go to a restaurant
[1:24:40] and see how many get your thing
[1:24:48] most are going to order something
[1:24:49] different
[1:24:52] what's important they were in the upper
[1:24:54] room they were all wanted
[1:24:56] god
[1:24:59] didn't matter how it came they wanted
[1:25:01] god
[1:25:04] to me our thoughts should be when we
[1:25:06] come to church
[1:25:07] i'm going into the upper room i just
[1:25:09] want more of god i want more of the
[1:25:11] living word inside of me
[1:25:14] amen i'm sorry i have to close
[1:25:17] i i can't i can't finish let's stand
[1:25:20] together
[1:25:20] i just want to say a couple things i and
[1:25:23] i'm sorry
[1:25:24] i'm sorry but i just
[1:25:28] i know the preachers here i know he's
[1:25:32] here
[1:25:32] because i couldn't even get through my
[1:25:34] notes
[1:25:38] you say you belong to christ
[1:25:42] and that you've got the holy ghost
[1:25:47] if you look at galatians chapter 5
[1:25:50] verse 22 and 23 they tell us what the
[1:25:53] fruits of the spirit is if i can just
[1:25:54] get that up there in for just a second
[1:25:59] i'm so sorry here are the fruits of the
[1:26:02] spirit
[1:26:06] now we say we belong to christ and we've
[1:26:08] got the holy ghost
[1:26:09] can you say amen to that statement all
[1:26:12] right let's look at the very
[1:26:14] next verse verse 24 and they that are
[1:26:17] christ
[1:26:18] have crucified the flesh with the
[1:26:22] affections
[1:26:23] and the lust if we live in the spirit
[1:26:26] let us also walk in the spirit
[1:26:28] let us not be desirous of vain glory
[1:26:32] provoking one another or envying one
[1:26:35] another
[1:26:36] now if we have the holy spirit if we are
[1:26:41] christ i'm telling you what's happening
[1:26:43] there is a self-crucifixion
[1:26:46] in your life because there's no way
[1:26:49] that god is able to be
[1:26:52] preeminent unless you do your part
[1:26:55] and be crucified crucify your
[1:26:59] god ain't gonna do that for you you have
[1:27:04] got
[1:27:06] to crucify your flesh with the
[1:27:08] affections
[1:27:10] and the desires in order to let the
[1:27:13] spirit
[1:27:14] walk through you and display this fruit
[1:27:18] brother gideon sent me a quote the day
[1:27:21] before yesterday and i want to read it
[1:27:22] in closing
[1:27:23] in the message is your life worthy of
[1:27:25] the gospel brother iran said
[1:27:27] pray god to let the light of this day
[1:27:31] rise in you to be obedient
[1:27:35] servants to god and then let the fruit
[1:27:39] of the spirit ever remain in your life
[1:27:44] and this and that is a life
[1:27:48] worthy of the gospel
[1:27:54] let me say this in closing brother
[1:27:55] branham said
[1:27:58] the only way the only way
[1:28:02] he says it two times the only way
[1:28:05] that you can live a life that's worthy
[1:28:07] of the gospel
[1:28:09] is to let the gospel itself every bit of
[1:28:12] that gospel
[1:28:14] come into you and reflect
[1:28:17] his promise back
[1:28:20] we're the moon or not the sun
[1:28:24] sun just reflects i mean the moon just
[1:28:26] reflects what the sun gives
[1:28:28] the only way that we can bear this is to
[1:28:32] let
[1:28:32] god the gospel the living word come and
[1:28:35] live inside of us
[1:28:37] and reflect back that's what god wants
[1:28:40] to see right when he shines down
[1:28:45] if that goal has got a lot of pyrite
[1:28:46] into it
[1:28:48] he's not seeing his reflection very good
[1:28:51] he got to keep beating
[1:28:54] until he can see himself god wants
[1:28:59] to see himself reflect off of you
[1:29:03] boom there's little jesus little
[1:29:06] messiahs
[1:29:06] look how they're loving one another look
[1:29:08] how they're talking look how they're
[1:29:10] laying down their life look how they
[1:29:11] understand that the other person
[1:29:13] isn't where they need to be but they're
[1:29:15] still loving
[1:29:17] amen that's a life that he says is
[1:29:20] worthy of the gospel
[1:29:24] that's the life i want is that the life
[1:29:25] you want amen bow your heart with me
[1:29:29] heavenly father we come to you in the
[1:29:31] close of the service
[1:29:35] knowing lord as we look in
[1:29:39] as we've looked into your word
[1:29:46] we're seeing
[1:29:50] our shortcomings
[1:29:55] we've seen lord sometimes
