morning it's good to be with you it's good to be gathered together in god's house where he promised to meet with us there amen god can be anywhere meet us anywhere but he didn't say go to the bars set aside a place that's dedicated to the to him and uh i'm so thankful that he's given us a revelation and we're growing in that revelation what that means as we're going through this little series on church order i want to say before we begin it's it's a great blessing to see sister joyce and sister kelly god bless each of you it's been a long time and i'm thankful that god has kept you especially what you've gone what you went through sister joyce and uh to think that god is is is keeping us in this hour we we don't know the extent of of this thing and i don't know if we will even years down the road to be honest with you it's a crazy thing um but we we serve a god who keeps us and a god that we trust in and the god that made promises to us that he's never lied and we're holding to his unchanging hand today amen we certainly appreciated that little not little that great big song special it was really really good and uh we want to encourage you to keep up the great work for the lord amen there are many blessings down the road the more that we can teach one another the things of the lord amen well if you have your bibles today you'd like to turn with us in our opening scripture and as we've been looking into a church order we kind of want to get down to business today uh we we spoke on god as a god of order we we've uh touched on um that the order that god has is is reverence and respect that's the first thing he wants to us to recognize when we come to his presence that um it's he's no one to to play around with our god is a consuming fire and he's he deserves holiness and righteousness and that we need to behave ourself in that way amen before we read here this scripture let's look to the lord in prayer heavenly father we thank you that you've made it possible for us once more to gather together in your house and we thank you that we have the the promise that you would be here when we would come here for you said even the angels are encamped around about them that fear thee lord you bring a whole host amongst with you lord you have seraphins and cherubians and angels of all kinds lord we thank you for the angel that you sent in this age to help us to know how we ought to conduct ourselves and kind of order to have in your house we humbly pray today that you'd come in this this service today and that you'd make known to us by a way of revelation lord the direction that you have for us that lies ahead lord bless each one bless those that are in their homes father those that are live streaming lord those lord that have prepared themselves for the service today just pray that you would meet with them in a very special way lord we commit ourselves to you give you the praise and honor for these things now we ask in jesus name amen amen starting with first corinthians chapter 14 verse number 33 and verse 40 33 reads for god is not the author of confusion but the peace is in all churches of the saints so no different this church is no different than what god wants in another church he doesn't want any confusion he wants there to be peace amen verse 40 let all things be done decently and in order that's a tall order to fill but i believe god can help us with that and then first timothy chapter 3 verse number 15. first timothy chapter 3 verse number 15. there will have you be seated but if i tarry long that thou mayest know how thou ought is to behave thyself in the house of god which is the church of the living god the pillars and ground of the truth amen god bless you may be seated we've established undolly that god is a god of order it's not just part of him it is him and he is in his order is with reverence and respect he never wants to be approached uh with any kind of haphazard uncaring um i don't need to humble myself in fact the bible says every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess uh god wants to hear from each of us as we enter into his uh the bible says enter into his gates with thanksgiving to his courts with praise god wants us to come into his presence with worship just like when isaiah came into the presence of the lord he saw that there was worship constantly happening and when you know we live in this natural life and we got to deal with things and it's hard uh to always have that spirit of praise on you but i think that we should um it should we should press towards that the bible says that we pray should continually come forth from us so when we come into god's house god doesn't want us come sitting like a bump on a log we have a job to do we have to reverence and respect him and and come in with worship and we cannot rely on uh brother ron to get us to that place to where we feel like doing it we need to come in with a mindset that this is what god expects out of me and and we need to give him our very best amen god also deals with us in a way of order not not ours i'm just going to throw some scriptures out real quick acts 2 38 then peter said unto them repent be baptized every one of you in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins and you shall receive the gift of the holy ghost now notice there is an order here to repent to get baptized and then receive the holy ghost acts 5 32 god gave uh god have given to them the holy ghost to them that obey him so in other words we have to obey then the holy ghost comes uh hebrews 10 36 after you have done the will of god you might receive the promise we all want promises of god but we have a job to do right we we have to do the will of god acts 1 8 but ye shall receive power after the holy ghost has come upon you we want power well we need the holy ghost seek the holy ghost power will come isaiah 40 31 but they that wait upon the lord shall renew their strength we all want strength we want to be strong but how many of us are willing to wait on the lord so there's an order that god has for us and how he deals with us brother brahm taught us that god is not obligated to show us any more until we've walked in the light that god has given us think about that the order we want we want we want we're not short of wanting but god says look this is what i've given you i expect you to do this don't ask for anything more until you have done this brother brandon said when um perfect love is projected and has come to its end and sovereign grace will step in and grant what love was projected for we all want the grace of god in our life we want needs met but god says love has to be projected first amen showing in order he also said nothing but perfect love will enter in so what do we do with that statement brother brandon gave us the uh the advice when he said uh whatever you do lay everything else aside in your life tell me what's important to you if you're if your whole life is so important that you really don't care about getting perfect love you're not a candidate you're not a candidate for the rapture we've got to get our priorities set there's an order with god and god deals with the sword and he wants us to keep order there would be times that god would show brother branham a vision before it happened and then when time would go on brother brandon would realize that he's in that vision that the vision is actually presently taking place and he would know what was going to happen and we all remember the story about the the hat and he he says that can't happen till the hat would move and brother ryan would wanted he would he'd want to take that hat but he knew that he couldn't do it he couldn't interfere that god had to do it in his order not our order this is so important to understand that god is particular about order and that we need to to fall in line with the vision of this word and the vision of this message and the and have our church the way that that god set it to be not the way we would like it because look there's there's so many different churches and denominations out there that you could go find something that really fits your fancy it really fits your fa flesh in the way that you want things to be but you know that is not what god's coming for that may be what the world is looking for is something for now but we're looking for a church that will get us ready for a rapture that'll get us ready for his presence to come and do exploits amongst us amen so it all has to do with what we're looking for there's no confusion or misunderstanding in heaven there's no backbiting no murmuring no complaining no sowing discord we know what happened to lucifer as soon as he began to sow discord god threw him out proverbs 6 verse 16 these six things stuff the lord hate so in other words they're out of order here yay seven are an abomination to him a proud look think about it a proud look what's that matter to god you don't stand in the presence of god with a proud look friend you may have it out there in the world and in the flesh but in god's presence you don't a lying tongue and hands that shed innocent blood a heart that deviseth wicked imaginations feet that be swift to run into mischief a false witness that speaketh lies and he that soweth discord among the brethren this is out of god's order we maybe feel comfortable with it we may feel like we have our rights but god has always been a god of order he always will be a god of order he will deal with us in an orderly fashion this morning we want to take a subject learning how to behave in the house of god how we behave ourselves in this church has a direct effect in the decision-making of the holy spirit in how or even if he will move amongst us the next time everybody should have said amen to that the prophet said how we act in god's house could hinder the next service so we think what does it matter as long as i'm here you're not here in my house this is god's house this isn't a worldly church the thing is we've gotten away from the way that god's house should be partly partly because it's the way that we have been serving god outside of the church and partly it's because the job of this pastor has not kept before the people how god's house needs to be which is not on you that's on me so we're going through it and by the grace of god i i would like to invite you to pray that that we're reminded of these things because that's that's that's that was the downfall as we're going through these series as we're going through this series and learning about god's order and of and and that we need to keep reverence and respect into his house i think we just we need to recognize that god is here sometimes we come into church and we just we come with such a carnality that uh we think it's just church in other words god's not really here and we come so caught up in our own life that we we we always come with uh this is what i expect out of the church this is what i want to get out of this i'm looking for this answer i'm looking for this direction and we we miss the reverence and respect of coming into god's house to find out where we're out of order where we stand with you lord we've we've made church different than what it should be holiness is the opposite of carnality of course you've got a carnal carnal spirit and and god's spirit they're opposites the carnal mind isn't even subject to god it'll just sit there and hear the word and do nothing about it but it's also the opposite of holiness and and and this is why we need to be serious about learning who god is and what he expects in his house i have so i don't know maybe 30 quotes 30 different messages 30 different messages how about that now i want to go through them just as quick as i can but this is i want to start out by describing the nature the lamb nature of the holy spirit brother iran said in the queen of sheba he says why you couldn't preach or pray for the sick like that there's too much confusion the holy spirit is timid everything must be done decently and in order for the holy spirit brother brother ron was praying in his prayer that or i i believe he was either praying or asking us to pray that um the the utterance that would come forth would be from the lord and what i like about this brother ryan is is got a whole bunch of quotes from the prophet i feel very i feel very comfortable hiding behind this message of knowing that it is the inspiration of the holy ghost in the message and from that time brother bram says see i have been in this world this work for 15 years and it causes confusion and it's not an arena or a playground it's the house of god reverence and respected the holy spirit is timid in the message the lamb and the dove brother brahman says the church of god is sitting in here so we want everything just in order you let it get out of order that's what happened you let it get out of order and watch how quickly the holy spirit will take its flight oh it's tim did you ever notice we've all sat here and we've watched things happen we we saw the spirit move something happened and and in a very strange things take place and all of a sudden it's just like it's just a formality what's going on you know we're responsible for the presence of the lord he says you let someone start disbelieving just watch how it leaves me just as quick as it came a spirit of unbelief in the sanctuary affects the moving of god i'll tell you when every man stands before the lord on that day there won't be no baloney you will not be able at that time to shrug off a negative i don't care what's the matter attitude at that point you will have to stand there and reverence god no matter what we can get away with it here we can have attitudes and negativity and and come into church the wrong way but there it won't happen it will not happen and we might as well get used to reverencing god the correct way now in the message of testimony on the sea brother adam said be alert the holy spirit is very timid i mean know that very timid it won't tolerate nothing wrong god's provided healing for this generation now we just got plenty of he says now we just got plenty of time don't be in any rush see see you get to rushing the holy spirit is very timid and i don't want you to rush i want you to be reverent like you have plenty of time how many times we just want to get out of service we want to get off this subject don't rush the lord he's doing something amen sirs be of good cheer brother brahman said sometimes in moving the holy spirit is very timid very timid the bible said grieve not the holy spirit of god be reverent now faith is moving all through the building so god is moving god is doing a wonderful thing in our midst and one person is any age grieve the spirit so we must be in charge what's going around us in charge it's not well you know here's this excuse and that excuse and the holy spirit's timid if you don't care why should he care you're going to over you're going to overlook your response he's just going to overlook you're look he's going to overlook your overlooking being led by the holy spirit brother says so you see it's so timid the holy spirit just the least little thing grieves it he says now be real reverent and jesus will come to you if you're all excited he can't come to you i'm speaking about being in the flesh i'm not speaking of the expectation of god now be reverent and believe in the message possessing the enemy's gate brethren says now be real reverent everybody now just be real reverend just keep quiet see the holy spirit is so timid let me know that just real timid the holy spirit see just any little interruption bothers him wow look how many quotes we quoted from on this subject and we think it's not a big deal what happens in the church but that's a man-made church that's a man-made thinking but it matters to god and that's what this church should be that's what this church was dedicated for for god to be the head of our church even if we could find the greatest man on the planet i personally i mean i would i would have no problem that man uh being uh the pastor of you all but i'm just speaking this i would rather have the holy ghost be the head of a church than the greatest man on the planet because man can only go so far just like love the human love only goes so far we need the love of god now there are two reasons for church order in our church one by far the most important we must maintain a reverence and respect to god in his house amen thank you brother the more you say amen the more this will become a part of your life if not we will grieve him away from here and not even know it how many times we just leave and come back and i wish we all had spiritual glasses so we could see what's going on in that spiritual realm so we must learn to respect god more by respecting his sanctuary his sanctuary aren't you glad that nobody can come in your house and tell you how to run your house aren't you glad that you are in charge of the decision-making in your house you wouldn't want somebody coming over there drinking and throwing the bottles around right be grateful that we have a place that we can have god's house exactly the way he wants it to be number two we must respect others who are perhaps more serious about god than we are in his house we got we got to respect his house for other people here who perhaps are more serious about god than you are so don't grieve the lord for their sake as well eternal life is living for others spiritual well-being and we can show eternal life right here in the church by respecting god's house our first subject is getting up during service do i hear four that's two three four every time you get up during the preaching you're disturbing someone you could very well be keeping someone from receiving you may not believe that or realize it but it is the truth it does it disrupts the holy ghost each time you get up if you're sick if you're pregnant or you have a small child sit in the back are you with me we're going to kind of get done to the nuts and bolts if you need to take a baby out due to noise it's best to stay out unless the baby quietens down the whole reason you're taking the baby out is to quiet the baby down get the baby quiet then you come back in i've had many practices with that through the years after you do it a couple times i mean if you do it two times and it's still i think then just walk with them in the hall try to try to keep them out and work with them out that's you know babies are babies they just they they don't know how to control themselves as they get older they will push that button as long as i can i don't know how to help myself please use the bathroom and get a drink before service i want to say this unless you're using the bathroom 30 times a day once every half hour whatever i'm sure you can wait an hour and a half if you honestly you have to go every half hour i mean boom boom boom boom boom boom sit in the back but if you can go you know three hours through the course of the day because you're working but you're having a hard time sitting still in church it's a different problem and all i'm saying is i'm trying to get rid of excuses and and don't get upset at me we're trying to establish the house of god there's a big difference i i know there's that feeling that wants to rise up and just but i'm being honest with you you know i would do nothing ever to bother anybody so it's not about me and my opinion or my pride or what i think it's about we need to start shaping this place in which there's as less disturbance less moving around less papers less as much as we can get so the lord feels welcome amen praise the lord in the message the voice of the sign brother brahman says see there's one thing you can't do you can't have a disturbance the holy spirit is timid see you must be obedient during the time and it's hard to be obedient i mean when we're at home we would just love to get on that lazy boy get a cup of coffee listen to a tape and i i feel that we're we're we could be exercising more reverence instead of like less in saying well god knows my heart yes god knows our god knows our heart and i'm so glad that god sent a prophet with not just isolated quotes but sending us a clear cut message of of how the sanctuary needs to be in the message taking god at his word brother brandon says now be just reverent just be as reverent as you can i ask you as christian people to be reverent don't move around love it jesus christ the same yesterday and forever brother says just be real reverend watch now if you want to praise god that's all right but don't get up and walk around you know and things like that it interferes the holy spirit is very timid real timid of course you didn't know it maybe till now but be real reverend oh i love the way he said that in other words okay this is the first time you're hearing about this it's okay but now that we heard see the hard work is going to be how you react to this next week the week after next month that's going to be the hard work because right now nobody is going to move everybody's going to they're going to do everything they can to hold it you know sometimes we just have to learn not to eat and drink so much right before service i mean just try to use wisdom to think about this i want to try to help to think that you're honoring respecting god more doesn't that please you you think about making god happy that that should make us happy so we're we're we're doing this for all the right reasons in the message spiritual signs of the time brother branham says after nine o'clock i noticed that the people begin one getting up walking here going out why see that disturbs it distracts from the meeting so now he's pinpointing a time that usually it begins to happen i love that he doesn't say oh that's okay the meeting's almost over he says don't do that in the message god being misunderstood brother brahm said the least you can do is be reverent be quiet get you a drink of water before church starts i know little ones has to have drinks mothers they got little fellas if you sit near the back keep them just as quiet as possible and there should never be a whisper never one whisper he says we're all guilty but when that bible is read and the minister enters the pulpit we should be silent waiting on the lord now please try to do that and i know i got little ones too that squirm around and joseph and and mita says i don't get anything out of the service trying to keep joe quiet well she's trying to do that so somebody else can get something out of the service see she's doing her job even though she's not able to get something out she's doing her job so somebody else can so just because you're not getting something out of it doesn't mean we can let our children just do whatever they're doing it's not the right motive first is our responsibility to keep things in order with what belongs to us and then and we always want to respect one another same quote and we always want right there right underneath and we always want to respect one another honor one another and above all things honor god and honor his house amen i love that because so many people had this mentality of oh it's just between me and god and nothing else matters it's just it's all between me and god nothing matters out here i don't understand that what about a life what about the holy ghost inside of you where where does that come in well it's not necessary it's not we're missing it we're on trial here when god says well done thou good and faithful servant what is he referring to this private relationship that we have with him and nothing else matters out here no he's looking for this to be put in order so he can say to us well done amen and the message sure we would see jesus brother bran says now please i ask again don't walk around please see the holy spirit is just as timid as it can be and sometimes when you're moving see you're a spirit you're a soul then when you move that interferes see so just be real quiet be real reverent so even though we're walking around walking out whatever we're doing we don't realize that it's interfering in the spiritual realm i just love this and the quotes are coming from so many different messages in the message but it wasn't so from the beginning brother branham said the reason i didn't have a healing service and i can't have it when people are moving around think about it the holy spirit is timid anybody knows that he just leaves like he did in the bible now he's trying now he's pointing us that what he's doing in brother ben is the same thing that he did in the bible and when you move around it just interferes you just can't do it so i know we got these urges and we're you know what we have so many urges right well recognize that's the enemy urging you and what's happening right now the holy spirit is urging you to to be still to be reverent because god wants to do something i'll say it like this they if you just wait on the lord you know you know brother branham speaks many times about when you come to deceit the lord and you want something from him and you think you got it he says you need to stay there and make sure that you get it and then after you think you've got it after that you need to stay there a little bit longer and make sure you got it it's all about forcing yourself to stay before the lord more than your flesh wants to we all deal with this every morning when we get up to pray we only want to pray so long and god we know something inside of us is telling us we need to spend more time with the lord but the flesh is saying no i get going i'll finish the rest in the car eat my bowl of cheerios or whatever it might be in the message be be not afraid it is i now i'm just going to wait a moment i'm waiting for the audience to get quiet i wonder how many times the lord is waiting here for us to get in order he says i'm waiting for the audience to get quiet to get reverent the holy spirit is so timid just one little thing he will go away he will just leave me the message that identified christ of all ages brother abraham said the holy spirit is timid very very timid and where you have just one unbeliever or a skeptic sitting around and the holy spirit just can't work hardly remember jesus let a man plum out of the city to heal him one time get him away from the unbelief he come into his own sitting the bible says and many mighty works he could not do we don't want to think in that way but the bible said he couldn't do it see he cannot do anything against your belief you've got to believe it so we if you don't believe god's here and wants to be reverent you know that just messes up and also in the message it is i be not afraid but it was a different time that he preached it so it's still a different message i love this we're not reading any from the same message so far he says now be real reverent now we want to worship we want god worshipped he said we want god worship we like to worship him but the holy spirit is so timid just be real quiet now you little fellows be nice down here down here now in front real nice now be real quiet everybody start praying now i think it's okay for the children to sit in front absolutely but brother man says got to be quiet you got to be still everybody start praying now father i am needy set in the atmosphere you with me everybody know what to do about moving around in the church how many is with me to put start putting this in practice amen in the message not in the message the next topic we'll get into that the next topic is talking in the sanctuary we should never be talking in the sanctuary we've read a couple quotes but we're going to read some more when you bring visitors with you you are responsible for letting them know that this is the place that we meet god the sanctuary is holy and we keep it quiet and reverent here while we're here you can't expect them to know it so we want to bring visitors but we also need to take the time to tell them well i'm afraid they're going to get offended well okay would you rather offend them or offend god we need to be in prayer in reading our bible before service and listening to what the spirit is saying during the ministry of the word god we're preparing to meet god in the message god being misunderstood brother brahman says children do you not know how to obey yourself in the house of god so he's talking to the children he says do you not know that this is the sanctuary of god god is in his holy temple let everybody keep quiet everybody that's not just the children that's adults it's the place of god where people are coming meditating trying to find salvation to their soul trying to find the problems of people's lives trying to help someone the least that you can do is be reverent be quiet and there should never be a whisper never one whisper this is something that we got to talk about in our homes this is something that we got to remind one another because we we forget and things slip and then we begin to make excuses in the message god hiding himself in simplicity and revealing himself in the same brother brandon says and now this may seem a little rude but it's not the place to visit it's a place of worship we should never even murmur a word inside of here outside of worship to one another unless it's absolutely necessary well you know what in our mind every time we do it we think it's absolutely necessary and all i'm asking you to do is think again if we need to talk to our children carry him out talk to him out there now i just i i it is probably not the perfect time to say this i don't know if it is or not i'm just going to say it but sister ann was sharing with me something that brother roger had uh shared with me back when we were having services in our homes and we weren't gathering together and and that was james was preparing for church in his home and that he would dress up and he'd be ready for church as if he was coming to church he didn't stain his jammies and say church at home but he he got himself in order and he did that because he has parents that wanted to encourage that now what was so wonderful about that is that when he came back to church it wasn't like he missed church for a few weeks and didn't know how to sit still i know since then there's been some times that have slipped but it shows you that if we spend time training at home that we can have things better in church and that's why i'm saying we need to take time to talk about these things at home and joe don't just expect you know church to keep you know saying it because we want to go on to to to other things amen amen so brethren says god is in his holy temple let everybody be quiet it's the place of god okay i've read that i'm so sorry i'm so god hid in simplicity unless it's absolutely necessary don't murmur a word he said see what we should never rally around we should never run through the building or let our children run through the building of course many of you are strangers and the tabernacle folks know this that the building is going to be dedicated to the service of almighty therefore dedicate dedicating ourselves let's remember when we enter the sanctuary keep still to one another and to worship god so it's part of our dedicating our lives is how we're dedicating our life to the tabernacle of god see it's so much noise and things it's it's just humanly and i've seen it in churches until it's made me feel real bad because we do not come into the sanctuary of the lord to meet each other we come here to worship god then go to our homes the sanctuary is dedicated to worship stand outside and talk anything you wish as long as it's right and holy go to one another's homes visit with one another in place but when you enter that door be quiet sometimes you know people enter this door just because they're not in here we'll get into that can't do that you come here to talk to him see and let him talk back to you the trouble of it is we do too much talking and don't listen enough then when you come in here wait on him i stood behind three crosses here to dedicate the place i would not permit anybody the usher stood at the door to see that nobody talked and when you're done do your talking outside you come in you desire too silently you come to the altar and pray silently you walk back to your seat and open your bible this is before the service now what your neighbor done that's up to him you had nothing to say if you want to talk to him say i'll see him outside i'm here to worship the lord you read his word and sit quietly now notice brother branham wasn't worried about that person getting offended how are you going to compare offending a person against offending god i mean yeah we want to say things nicely but the thing is we're all we're so scared to do things to keep things in order because we don't want to offend anybody it's like our witnessing we don't want to witness to anybody because we're afraid of offending them so you're going to let them go to hell because you're afraid offending them it just doesn't make sense tell them the truth that's the only thing that'll set them free talking by the bathrooms or prayer rooms before service so this is now talking in the hall by the bathroom outside of the prayer rooms here not in the sanctuary this also is going to tie into church preparation when we're talking outside of the prayer rooms or the halls or even by the bathroom door before service our voice carries into the sanctuary and into the prayer rooms and i'm sorry about that when we get the other church there'll be a little bit more liberty things are a little bit we've got some concrete blocks and i think uh we're gonna be a lot better shape in this direction and we'll be able to have maybe little places uh but it's something that the more we talk now the more you're convincing the person you're talking to that you're here for other reasons than to meet with god by you keeping your focus on god your reason why you're here the more that you're going to be able to be a testimony for the lord and the more we're going to get from god because remember if god's a god of order he deals with us in order maybe we haven't been able to receive from the lord the way we want because things just haven't been in order are you with me it's okay if more of you say amen so always remember you can be heard we want to learn to be reverent and to save our talking for after service this is all about learning we're here about learning how to be reverent in god's house and to maintain this reverence wherever at in the building talking about the service talking before the service is going to disrupt those preparing for the service i don't know how many times i've been in prayer and here talking but i feel not so much for me but for those who are really trying to enter in trying to get a hold of god trying to prepare their heart and a lot of time some of these faithful prayer wars you know what they're doing they're praying for you because you're not in the prayer room and then you don't care enough to be quiet but want to talk think about what i'm saying here be mindful that even after service has ended there could still be someone here in the sanctuary seeking the lord trying to get a need met for their life trying to get deliverance seeking the holy ghost praying for praying to get in contact with god for a certain thing and your voice is carrying after service so i'll say it like this make sure service is really over for everybody but you before you begin to talk are you with me all right you're not mad at me right you love me right all right in the message god hiding himself in simplicity again reviewing himself the same brother brandon says but when you enter the door be quiet you come in here to talk to god to let them talk back to you the trouble is we do too much talk and we don't listen enough i want to get to a certain point here in this quote um he says but there is nobody but there is nobody worships the lord while you're talking passing notes and you're helping someone else get away from the worship of the lord see so that's what's happening when you're out of and you're in the flesh dealing with something you're actually helping another person get out of contact with god see so we feel that would be wrong and we want to make that a ruling in our church that in our congregation that to this building this church we will dedicate to the kingdom of god and to the preaching of the word pray worship that's the reason you come here to worship them so we don't pass notes i'd like to say it at any age and here's why i'm saying it if we let a child pass a no a lot of times going to pass it to an adult and then now adults are passing notes and when at what age do we tell them no we don't pass notes in church you understand what i'm saying so i'm just we're trying to use wisdom about about the subject if we just shy away from it then we don't gotta worry about retraining he says and then i've seen churches though to where the children were permitted to run all over the sanctuary and adults standing and hollering across the room to one another he said that's a good way to ruin the service for that night for the next service or whatever time it is so in other words it could be another day so as soon as service is dismissed leave the auditorium you're through in the worshipping then then go out and talk to one another and whatever you want to or and whatever you want to do if you get something you want to talk to somebody about to see them well you go with them and go to their homes or whatever it is but don't do it in the auditorium let's dedicate this to god see i always like brother ben says ccc all the time he wants to make sure we get it this is the meeting place this is his meeting place where we meet with him see and the law goes forth from the sanctuary of course and i believe that would be pleasing to our heavenly father and i just say amen i believe what we're saying today would be pleasing to god all right you know we got a lot of stuff here and is it okay that if we just you know go with it i'm just by faith i believe everyone said amen in their heart at that point you know i just i feel it all right cell phone use we do not have any scriptures on cell phones we do not have any quotes on cell phones they weren't around when brother branham was ministering if he was though i believe i'd have a lot of them they have caused so much disturbance i do know that we've had many distractions and interruptions through the years and unfortunately it's added to the confusion in the sanctuary it's leaving things more out of order now of course no cell phone goes off because you wanted to it's the fact as a child you have a responsibility with that cell phone i i don't care if you don't mean it i don't care if you didn't attend it i care that you learn to take care of it before you enter into the sanctuary it would be great if it's turned off then you never have to worry about it at the very least is put on silent not vibrant it if the slightest little thing disrupts the holy spirit hey god i didn't think it mattered it's not a big deal it's a big deal we want to take care of big deals now i'm okay things are going to slip all of us are going to slip what i'm not okay with is the spirit and the attitude that we bring in the church that nothing matters that's the same thing lucifer had it's the same thing laodiceans have need of nothing it's lacking the fear and reverence respect that god deserves so we want to do all things decently in order with our cell phones cell phones should be turned off amen if it's too if it's too dangerous to text and drive which we know it is why would we think it's not too dangerous to have our cell phone on in god's sanctuary and i'm going to tell you why because you don't think this is god's house you in your mind in your heart you have belittled this place to what you have made it and that shows that why god's not moving amongst us like he could because we're not coming with the expectation that god's here we're coming because it's church it's time just remember every time you want to text when you drive think of this god doesn't want us texting and dealing with our phones hearing our phones have anything to do with our phones he didn't invent the phones that's your own business for your own work for your own personal god it's between us and god when we come here amen now when you're using your cell phone as a bible you are appearing to be on your phone during service which is not the best example the best example would be for you to bring your bible to church and read it well brother john i don't think there's a difference really can i prove you wrong how many times have you looked at the wrong thing on your cell phone well we're all guilty we all should raise our heads we should all say amen now i know you're withholding from me how many times have you opened this book and looked at something wrong let's keep the sanctuary just like this book are you with me we have to use our cell phones sometimes for recording i've been number of times that somebody in our church could not make it to church and i've set my phone right up here so they could hear the service and most the times we have to use the cell phone in the back for the live streaming now so if you see that happening no it's for the work of the lord and only for the work of the lord eating and drinking in the church we don't have time but you can write this down there's a scripture first corinthians chapter 11 17-34 it's about not having the right motive when we come to church it's about eating and drinking in church and having a judgmental spirit when we come to church and paul said you have houses to eat and to drink in and don't come to church with a judgmental or critical spirit but he said let everyone examine themselves that's why we come find out where they're at with god and then we can truly partake of the bread of life the word of god amen i believe it would be pleasing to the lord not to have any eating or drinking of any sorts going on inside the sanctuary if we need to eat something or drink something let's do it before we enter the sanctuary now i've seen people come in here with pops and coffees and the whole nine yards and the thing is can you imagine isaiah hey i just you know if it's okay i want to bring my mountain dew i believe we're expressing to god respect and offering god reverence when we keep that stuff out of the sanctuary now we do need to offer water to the ministers and to the worship team because we're coming here to worship the lord and they need that but that's the line that's the line um honestly i'd rather be pouched dry and not move until service is over than to get up because you're thirsty before you know it you're always thirsty you don't realize it's the spirit that god gets on you just wants to disrupt the service and you know what's going on and the message influences brother bran says now no wonder they can't believe a real true message no wonder they can't have these things in church no wonder they have to put him on the outside in the last days there's no reverence in his presence notice there's no reverence in his presence his presence came can come down and they'll laugh and and pop chewing gum and walk around and carry on and i don't know what not no more reverence than nothing in his presence now no reverence at all for god and his people why why do they do this now listen close why do they do it they are not conscience of his presence they don't think that god is here in the message why brother brahman says then you'll have your church setting in order then you'll have your church setting how many want your church in order amen that's why we're doing this but the way it is they just fly loose anywhere somebody chewing gum in another eating popcorn and one talking and another whispering and someone trying to speak in times in three and four in time and this one trying and oh my it becomes a corinthian affair again he says you ought to get back in order back with the holy spirit the message hear ye him brother bram says in the lame walked and the blind seeing the spirit of god fall into the meeting discern the very thoughts in their hearts and great prophetic things will go forth that's perfect every time just exactly and the church says well that's all right big wad of chewing gum sitting there you know yeah that's all right but we're going to see lucy tomorrow night remember i love lucy and we just we we're just not going to church see the pastor he just wants to condemn us let him condemn us we'll go over to another denomination if he wants to condemn us we'll just go over there and join that church if they run out of that out of the church of god uh we'll go over to the assemblies and if we run out of the assemblies we'll go to the oneness and we run out of the oneness we'll go to the two nests and we'll run from the tunis and we'll go to the three nests and we got plenty of room see in other words there's a spirit on them that don't want to be subject and the attitude that the pastor just wants to condemn us it you got to recognize thoughts that come because if you don't bring them under subjection quickly they will become a part of your thinking and somewhere down the road it'll come out of your mouth talking to somebody oh yeah they'll come out like uh i don't even want to say but it'll come out in a very negative way when i and and it's not what i wanted to say is not is not wrong it's just we need to respect the house of god more and stop thinking and talking as if it's a man at the pulpit because that's the true problem if it's god we wouldn't take it lightly if we think it's god we wouldn't take it lightly we wouldn't talk about it lightly we wouldn't joke about it and laugh about it because it's because it's god's presence here he says yes you you got a room brother there's just room for christ in you if you want to come in to him oh god have mercy on the church of this day i'll stop after tonight because i don't want to make you angry brother brandon said but i just had to use these nights to drill this into you to let you know that the church is in a terrible condition you want to drill it in it certainly is our zeal we're just slothful you know just sloppy-like god don't want us to be like that so hey let's be soldiers let's be soldiers and the message questions and answers on the holy ghost brother brandon says then after a while they began to hear the bell ring church has begun to take up then they bring these messages lay them right there on the on on the desk right there where they're supposed to be laying and i'm somewhere studying and praying after a while walk out after the songs are being sung the church is all in order people coming sitting meditating praying that's what they're supposed to do not to come to the church and talk to one another come to church to talk to god have your fellowship out there see we're fellowshipping with god now and we come here talking and everything quietly reverently and the spirit moving the pianist come to the piano about five minutes before the song service starts just real sweetly down at the cross where my savior died down wherefore cleansing from sin i cried or some good sweet song real quiet it brings the presence of the holy ghost into the meeting i don't know how many times i've been in the back just you know praying praying and sister cheryl gets up here and starts playing and all of a sudden the presence of god comes over there how does that happen i've been praying for so long and i didn't feel it i never told her that i guess i should have but it's something about building the presence of of the lord and that's what what brother branham is talking about here he says now the people are sitting there some of them are real they just start weeping they come up to the altar and repent before the service ever starts that somebody brother branham calls them real people there's a realness about them they come to church for the right reason it's not just i don't know why we come to church we all come for different reasons you understand what i'm saying i've seen i've been in churches mainly mainly overseas and i'll see people come to the altar before service and just seek the lord the holy spirit's there see the churches in travail christians are praying they got their positions they're not sitting there with chewing gum saying hey liddy give me some of your lipstick i want you know you know i need you know the other day when i was down there shopping i tell you i almost stepped on your toes did i ever see such what do you think about this or that he's just expressing how people just talk about anything but god he says oh mercy and call it the house of god why it's a disgrace the body of christ coming together there we sit the man sitting by say you know when we were over there this so and so and and so and so and and that so and so that's all right outside but in here it's the house of god come in praying take your positions i'm talking now not to your churches brethren i don't know what you do i'm talking to this tabernacle i'm talking to my own back door see that's right isn't that beautiful well it's up to you i've got about uh i'm gonna say 12 minutes more for for the last one or i can stop here you tell me is that the best you can do the reason i want to get through i'm just being honest with you um i want to get through this church order just as quickly as i can there's probably nobody wants to get through it quicker than i do but i don't want to stop short of being able to to teach it right and be thorough this last subject is being on time for church being on time for church and i know it's customary for some of you to say that you've been preparing your heart at home before you get here that's fine there's nothing wrong with that but that is not the excuse to be late for church your position and your pulse of duty is here at the church a half hour before service begins and i'll tell you we have gotten so far out of order with this i don't know how many times my wife has begun to play the piano and there's one or two people in the church and it's so sad to me we have gotten out of our position we've gotten out of our our our post of duty it's like not even our duty and we've made church something different than what it is if you have an expectation that you're going to receive a god you can't wait to get there brother brian says you can't wait till the doors are open should not be hard to get there on time but if you're so filled with the world always recuperating from the night before now i know we don't we're not drunk and hungover from the night before but we can get drunk on the world and the things of the world and and we forgot about this and forgot about that how to do this and how to do that before you know it becomes a habitual habit and we have what we have today starting to prepare and pray at home or at work or in your car before you get here is perfectly in order but next we need to get to church a half hour before service begins brother john why are you saying that believe me things will be so much better here at church it will be better for church it'll be better for you it'll honor god's house more god will be more pleased with it i think brother it was brother uh mark was telling me no maybe sister ann sorry sorry but sister ann said one of them too said i don't know which one to say so i'm going to try listening to a spoken word as the original seed it's this six hour message so going a few minutes over ain't going to be that big a deal is it we'll get more out of the word the realness the spiritual of coming to church now of course if we don't come to church for those reasons then then it becomes a this becomes a law and a pain and we really don't want to do it but if you're really coming with the right motives and the right reasons this will benefit you and it'll benefit the other person sitting next to you so why what are we going to do with our half hour before we come to church if we're honest most of times when we get here we still have things hanging on us even if you spent time preparing it'll give you time to to get them out of you well brother john i i got them off before i got to church well it's still a good time to search your heart because your heart is deceitful right and there could be some things there you don't even realize it can be very very deceitful plus god has a lot of things he wants to say to us right but we can't we're not ready for it so it's all about getting ready this half hour is preparation you think about it how many hours that a minister actually spends studying for the message and we can't give a half hour preparation for it don't you think god's going to hold you accountable to that now it'd be different if we just came here and popcorn toad jokes made everybody feel good say a little something but if god is really trying to get a message across to us the least we can do is prepare for it amen thank you brothers another thing you can do is you can begin to pray for your brother and sister who needs help you can pray for the mission field for lost souls to be one to jesus your time isn't in vain you can pray for a burden to pray more we need to get to church a half hour early if anybody wonders because my wife is probably one of the most faithful come to church and uh and i know sickness has really hindered her but uh i'm sure most of you notice cheryl was sitting out in her car and everybody's working through their own thoughts about how they want to deal with the covet virus we have people that are are staying at home and live streaming we have people that have stayed home a while that have come today and i respect every single person support every single person every person's got to work out their own salvation with fair trade i think you know we shouldn't be telling other people how to deal with covet i think we should just let believe that god is able to lead and guide us amen but but she's out there half hour before service starts for sure and she's preparing before she comes in here just the same as when she's in here preparation is important brother branham said in the message experiences he says don't be late at your church you have to go to church you get right on don't miss your church now brother branham said in the message experiences at the same time later in the message sorry he says don't never miss going to church on sunday or for your prayer meeting and you people who have little churches here that's us who's struggling that's us my advice would be for you to stand at your post of duty just as loyal as you can to the cause of christ back up your minister and everything that's going on for the cause of christ and do that and god will bless you the only way that you can respect god is to respect one another i'll say saints we've got so many excuses for missing church i'm just going to say it like this you do not have a revelation you don't know your position if you're not going to be at your post of duty how do you expect god just to grab you on rapture mourning every chance you have to come here to church and be on time and be at your post of duty is is actually you know who has a revelation of of their post of duty it's the person who's here all the time it's the person who's faithful all the time they have a revelation the people that are not here at their posted duty all the time are the people who have excuses all the time ain't no different with paying your tithes it's no different with anything how do you know you got a revelation you manifest it we all have heard we need a revelation of our pastor right why is that so we're not listening to 15 different pastors trying to get what we want looking for what we want well we need a revelation of being at our post not just say well i know i belong to this church and when i can make it i'll be here now of course i am not saying this i'm just real real clear i'm not saying this because of our sister joyce or sister kelly i didn't know they were going to be here you just happen to plop in right down the middle of church order but i'm speaking to those who faithfully come here i read i'm speaking to the whole church but we need to be here it shows god i reverence you i respect you i respect my position in christ with you i respect being in my post of duty with you don't make this your carnal denominational church that you want to come when you want to come and have an excuse when you don't want to it's a shame it's a disrespect every time you're not here i understand if you're in the bathroom and you're throwing up and you can't make it i understand but if i use a work excuse every time and i've got more work excuses than anybody in fact from the get-go i think it was ann telling me who told me this now i understand why brother johnson said if you want to get anything done always give it to the person who's the busiest because they'll find a way to get it done but you know what god don't take excuses you may want to dish them out carnally but god don't take them i just say it like this you need to pray about the revelation you think you have about being at your post of duty every time the door is open because that's what the prophet said amen and i'm just saying what the word says i'm not trying to create something different than the prophet created i'm not trying to create my own colony or my own way of thinking or my own view on the message i'm just trying to echo what the prophet said in the message why brother branham said now you're here you here that have churches that you go to we wouldn't want you to miss your own service you stand at your post of duty always when your church has services why you're here locally why it's your place to stay at your church in the message last last quote the way of a true prophet says so now if you if you have had to miss work i want to read this good so now if you have had if you've had to miss work to hear to be here with us and pray with us and so forth you have to miss work he said that's all right he says you just go ahead and miss work he says but don't you miss church now what more do you want me to read for you to have a revelation of what god is requiring the thing is brother sister i have tried so hard to tell you all along what to be doing and you still refuse to line up don't you see we're all responsible for the for the atmosphere here and keeping god's house the way it's supposed to be we don't want a private revelation or private interpretation of what we think holiness is or what the church needs to be we need to keep it what the prophet taught us not just an internal belief but living the word out showing it with your life showing it with your faithfulness anybody can come when they want when it works into their own schedule but to do it when you don't feel like doing it to doing it we got other things that are really important i'm so glad the prophet said you can miss work but you don't miss church set a priority well brother john he don't that's the problem cast down all reasoning everything that exalts itself against this message don't he says don't miss church don't miss church i i won't make you late enough to miss church but if you do have to miss work once in a while he says that won't hurt how many times do we mister or miss work for something we want to do right come on we should have that same hunger for wanting to be in god's house that's really what's missing it's your relationship with god that's lacking now because work that's just your daily bread and the lord promised to provide that so this you must really be sure you come to church you see amen let's stand together we must make sure that we come to church by by doing these things the cell phone the church the talking what we're doing by just coming to church and being on time being at your post of duty praying you know what you're doing you're reverending god you're getting things in order well what if church hasn't been doing as good because you haven't been here because you haven't been here a half hour to pray because you're so busy with your life well i'm doing the most important thing i'm barely that's good that's good but this is better this is god we just read god's perfect will it's about behaving ourself not being here at church when you should be here is not behaving yourself in the church of god didn't brother johnson used to tell us if somebody wasn't here and they didn't hear the word preached they were still responsible for what god preached because they weren't at their post of duty i think now look about this we've all leaned towards the side of making an excuse not to be a church why don't we lean to the other side what do you mean a half hour i'm getting here 45 minutes early i'm i really want to pray for my brothers i really want to see the presence of god move what about lean to the other side what's what what's wrong with it if we excuse the one side why can't we ex we're showing where we're at with god i want you to take these words take this message become more serious with the lord apply it don't just have a hard heart excuses unharden that heart let the tears begin to roll let your yourself lord i've come short i want to start honoring your house don't tell me you're honoring god and you're not honoring this word you're not honoring this message that don't work it's it's a wrong spirit we honor god by honoring the word and this is your chance to step up not only to your post of duty but to your position in christ where you can be a lighthouse for somebody in this church you can be an example for somebody in this church you can be someone that people look to and say this is the way i thought i need to act this is the way i needed to be i need to be faithful i need to do this i i need to do that if i was if look i think when i met her i had a long hair and i wasn't quite as as long as sister amanda's but definitely wasn't as long as citrutricious but it was long and i had to cut it and i looked like a girl and i didn't know i thought it was a cool guy and she had to get her friend and said is that no that's good imagine me coming to the pulpit every day with long hair this was the example i'm going to set for you don't you see how that would affect you it wouldn't make the guys the brothers the guys would make the brothers want to cut their hair is that true okay what about you and your example why do you belittle that why doesn't it mean anything to you this is your chance to serve god in his house what an honor it would be to serve in the house of god i thoroughly thoroughly enjoy love doing everything except preaching when it comes to working for the lord but to stare at faces that i know the flesh is not happy with me i know that i'll work on my personal relationship with you outside here but this is what the lord wants and i want you to work with me okay amen let's bound the word of prayer lord we could ask today for a show of hands those that perhaps need to fit into these quotes that we've read today to be more in church order and every hand would be lifted lord you see that already you know that lord we're asking today that you would look in our hearts for this strong desire that we have to be back in order as we move forward here lord we don't want to forget these things we don't want to let them become secondary or or talk light about them or to think light about them but lord we're asking today that you take this word this so many of these uh things that we've said we're right from the message that your prophet taught lord we're asking that you'd engrave them upon our hearts today lord that we wouldn't have to be reminded but that literally we could become written epistles that when people see our life they would see that it's written on our heart it's written in our life in our faithfulness here at church and how we behave ourself in your house lord i pray for every brother and every sister here lord for those that are live streaming perhaps those that will listen in the future i pray lord there's that desire inside of them to walk in this truth and this message lord that you'd give them the um that measure of grace lord that all sufficient grace to to please you because lord this is what you want when we read the scriptures when we read that paul taught this same thing in all churches it wasn't just one church but he taught the word of god in all churches and brother branham said this is not for anybody's church but for my church what he was really saying there is that i'm responsible for my church and that the other believers that were there in that service they couldn't speak for their pastor lord may it be so of our church may it reflect the message of the hour the message that the prophet gave may we still be that shining light may we be that lighthouse when other uh believers come from other churches and and lord when other sinners come into this church and the next church that we're going to have lord that they would they would feel the presence of god and want to seek you lord and want to open their hearts and lord let the tears begin to roll you squeeze their hearts lord father we need you in this hour i pray that the all the holy spirit would just come now and soothe every heart touch every mind may there be no one offended no one going in that direction but come lord jesus be merciful to each of us you see where your children were wanting to please you give us the revelation the understanding of how we can do it in a better way lord that we may walk pleasing in your sight we love you now we commit ourselves to you lord for we humbly pray these things in jesus christ's name amen can the church say amen amen let's play sing that way you were playing there yourself before our lord and kings give him your heart offer your everything there's no limit on the love he has for

was heard he rolled back the water of the mighty red sea and he said i will lead you put your trust in me one more time how great is our god great is his word he's the greatest one that ever was heard he rolled back the water of the mighty red sea [Music] and he said i will lead you put your trust in me amen praise the lord uh this service like many we have to learn to trust the lord above our feelings and to me this is part of the promised land this is part of the promised land this is this is god this is his will this is what he wants and we have to by faith just do it and not try to reason scribulate and allow a chance for the enemy to get in there and get you off course amen is saying so be it so bad let this word be born in me and i i believe with all my heart that this has everything to do with god blessing our church it has everything to do with unity this what we preach today propagates unity real unity not well i like brother ron more than brother mark because i'm talking about i do not like brother ron in the flesh more than i like uh brother mark but i respect brother iran just as much as i do brother mark they're equal and that's what this message will do for our church there's so much more to it than what we see and that's why we need to stay laser focused on just following through with it and don't let anything else try to creep in no other reasoning let the word change you do not change the church amen because satan would like to do that he'd like to get in here and just kind of have a man-made church may the lord be with you bless you and uh make you happy make you happy and that's that's that's my my my desire for you brother stan i want to say it's so good to see this brother here today um i want you to pray for brother stan for a number of reasons but he's has been battling a lot of physical needs in his body and he is my family he is my family he is my brother and uh he needs us he needs our prayers um and i i believe with all my heart he'd be able to to do a little bit more at the church if he physically felt better but uh i'll say um he's been doing a perfect job there the the work the quality uh it's just been i believe the lord is pleased with it so i can say the lord is pleased with it um brother brahman says if you're going to do something don't do it shoddy do it with all your heart or don't do it and uh it's it's a great quality to have but if you would please pray for our brother amen and i want us to pray for brother travis i know that you know he hasn't been baptized yet you know he hasn't just
