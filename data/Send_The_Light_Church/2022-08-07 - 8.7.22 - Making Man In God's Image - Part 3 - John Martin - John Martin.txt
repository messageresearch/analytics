ask him to come and tell us what the how the goodness of the lord it's been on his heart amen to be in the house of the lord this morning and thank god for his presence thank god for his spirit i'm just going to make it very short i'm going to read us some verses of scripture in james chapter 5 beginning in verse 13. is it he among you afflicted let him pray you see mary let him sing psalms send his sick among you let him call for the elders of the church and let them pray over him anointing him with oil in the name of the lord and the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that he may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much and i just wanted to you know i promised the lord that i i'm not going to i'm not going to try to hide anything any imperfection in my life and he said confess your faults i wish i didn't have any but uh you know here about a month ago i went to the grocery store and i went to that self checkout and i got to an item that that i needed very much but the machine would not register it i tried three or four times then i looked for the i looked for the person who was happy in the in the store i couldn't find them i waited i couldn't find anyone and so it was an item that i needed so i just put it in the basket all the way out the store i said lord you forgive me i'm not going to take this without paying but there's no one here to help me and uh i just asked i just uh oh about a week or two later i went by to pick up another one so i could so i could pay for two that way i would know that i had paid for the one and uh so uh there was none there what the item i i wanted wasn't there so in the store so i waited about two weeks i went back again and it was there so i i paid twice you know so i just feel like i want to ask the people you know i'm glad the lord gave me the strength to do that because because to take it without paying would be definitely wrong and so i think that next time i'll just leave it on the shelf somewhere and come back later but uh but anyway he said confess your faults one to another so that's what i'm doing this morning i'm not going to take your time but i do want to say i appreciate the prayers of the church here and i appreciate the ministry and i'm looking forward to the message this morning may the lord bless you and may he guide each one amen amen well you know that's hard for anybody to do so we just appreciate our brothers love for the lord that would seem sometimes that it might be not very much to somebody else it's a lot to him so we just humble ourselves before the lord this morning let us stand as our our brother comes and lord we just thank you lord jesus that for the for our brother lord and just all the tender hearts here this morning that you have a table set for us let us come to you with a clean heart this morning lord we also want to just thank you for this building and all the things that went into it all the effort lord god but lord jesus we just want to give you a greater effort to come into your presence this morning that your word would not come back for white lord for you said it would so lord this morning we just pray that you would just have your precious way with each and every one of us this morning lord and as our brother comes lord let us just uh let us just sing sanctuary lord come into us lord let us be a sanctuary for your word this morning amen [Music] [Music] tried and true with thanksgiving will be your living sanctuary for you just for you lord lord prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and holy tried and true [Music] let's believe it with all of our heart [Music] prepare me to be a sanctuary pure and [Music] holy tried and true with faith [Music] i'll be a living [Music] amen let's look to the lord in prayer heavenly father we we thank you lord that lord you promised that if we would uh yield our life to you that you would take our life and make us what we ought to be you lord you gave us that free more agent to make that decision in this morning lord with our hands lifted up our our voice and heart filled with song lord we're praying lord make us a sanctuary that your word could come into you right now and make its abold oh god we want you on the inside and we want less of ourselves and more of you and lord we as our brother as lord we all could stand here literally for hours and confess our faults and our shortcomings for there are so many in our lives lord the god what you're looking for is that true heart that one that will confess that will lay down his life that you may come and make your character inside of us lord we thank you for your holy spirit we thank you for the part of our nature that has been changed but lord we're here to see you completely manifested in our life we want to be just like you would we pray lord that you just take our lives now take our vessels lord may they be prepared for your word that is to come lord we pray that you bless the reading of your word and give us the revelation thereof personally for our lives that we may we may become all that you'd have us to be give you the praise for these things now in jesus christ precious name we pray amen amen uh we'd like we have also a scripture reading in james chapter 5. amen i'm not sure okay yes my brother brother johnson had had stopped at verse 16 and the two verses that i have are verses 19 and 20 verses 19 and 20 of james chapter 5. brethren if any of you do err from the truth and one converteth him let him know that he which converteth the sinner from the air of his way shall save a soul from death and shall hide a multitude of sins amen god bless you you may be seated well we want to welcome our brother josue with us we had a chance to have some fellowship with him and he is just a real uh fun brother but he has the holy ghost inside of him he loves the lord with all of his heart you just spent a little bit of time with him and you know he loves the word and it's a great privilege to have them and we appreciate the song amen amen well we want to continue on uh god's image in part three and just trying to break down who we are we've been dividing asunder the soul and spirit if we just eliminated our bodies for a moment uh there's a soul and spirit in us and the word of god is able to take the two and and separate it and we've been learning the difference between the thoughts that we have in our heart and the intents behind those thoughts what we're going to do and there is a difference between the two and it really takes the word of god to to do this we can't do it on our own we actually need god to uh to not only to discern those things for us but to take this triune being that we are and to bring a separation to help us know who we really are because most of us are geared up to just thinking we're in a body and we're functioning in the body we need jobs we need money we need health we need all these things for the natural man and we kind of we don't put a whole lot of emphasis on the spiritual part of us now we need the lord's help to help us and uh we can't do it on our own our our our our heart and our motives are very selfish and our heart is actually wicked jeremiah 17 verse 9 says the heart is deceitful above all the things and we think we got a pretty good heart and it's deceitful above all things and desperately wicked who can know it amen you know who can know it there's only one person here that can know it it's the word amen the word of god god in word form now i don't mean bible form but what i do mean is the living word the holy spirit form verse 10 says i the lord search the heart i try the reigns even to give every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings the lord is here to search us to try us and i'm so grateful that god loves us that much he says as many as i love rebuke i chase him i want a relationship with us he wants a relationship with us but you know he he can't and refuses to have a relationship with a satanic nature a selfish nature a nature that is it's about self in fact when man uh lowered himself to his own will that is when god's separated from man and he's been trying to to have the preeminence in man's life ever since then now we're taught that animals do not have a soul but they do have some sort of affection at times anybody got an animal you ever feel affection from your animal they they have uh some sort of ability to reason certain things and to to even remember certain things we've all watched a national geographic and scene where uh certain animals they will they'll hide in the weeds and or they'll go down by the the the water where the other animal they'll wait for their time to to take its prey you might think well brother john that's just instinct they're born with that well i'm not saying they don't have instincts i believe they do but i also believe humans have instincts our dog sophie she was not born with the instinct to know where our treats are at she learned where they were at right brother mark has seen it a sophie will go over there and she'll she'll sit right there like this and she'll look up at the treats and then she'll look at my eyes she'll look back at the traits she won't do anything else but she's uh connecting she's reasoning if i can get his attention and of course we reward her with the treat that reward is she just asking for and i give it to her i didn't make her speak or jump or do any of that stuff that most people do and you got even these dogs that are uh blind eye leading not blind eye blind they lead the blind people and you got these police dogs they got the ability to to to sniff out uh drugs and um even uh criminals and all things they they've been trained so there's something in animals that they got ability to to um reason things through but nothing like a human nothing they're they're drastically different they're they're limited now the highest form of all the animals was the more uh he was more subtle than any beast of the field the bible says which the lord god had made and uh he had the ability to talk that's how high he was he could reason and imagine he had affection he could walk uprightly like adam and eve he had the ability to under intermingle with human reproduction so close he was he was the closest to a human that there was of all the animals but there was something about him he was more subtle than any beast now that word subtle means cunning crafty prudent he had the skill in achieving his ends what he wanted by deceit or evasion he talked out of two sides of his mouth he could speak the truth and say did not god say we could eat of every tree of the garden but then he had the ability to speak out of the other side of his mouth and said thou shall not surely die and when he was cursed he was cursed into something that had a fork ton given the representative that he was a creature that could speak both ways that he acted both ways think about that even this day and what he was turned to there's no more subtle beast but there there is what was turned into what he was turned into it's still around in fact i had to get one out of the barn just yesterday it's real satan is real there's a long-standing tradition of many native american tribes speaking with fork tongue you've all heard of that now even though this natural beast is missing from the planet this beast-like spirit is still here it's still among us today and we have contact with them a lot more than we realize as great as this animal was man had dominion over him the problem wasn't still is that the devil can use just about anything uh to deceive man he can even use the word of god by twisting it humans need god they can't make it on their own they can't outsmart out do out figure out the devil the thing is too many a sheep want to try to make it on their own but we need a shepherd we need the shepherd to lead us well what does sheep do she are submissive and it's very easy to submit to the wrong thing that's why we need to be so in love with god's word so in love that that becomes our motive for the decisions that we make in life because if we're going to intellectually try to make it on our own figure it out you're certainly going to miss it the reason that the elect won't be deceived is that they're the only group that will humbly submit themselves to the word people think they're they're not going to be deceived because they're elected well that's not the case because many will come to me in that day and say lord lord i thought i was elected you would god is hid in simplicity he's just looking for his sheep to follow the word amen that's right we make it complex when we don't want to follow the word we want to do it our way the most subtle beast was convinced that he had something to gain by bringing forth a seed that was mixed with uh a a a seed that was in the image of god see what he had to gain his children were going to be more like the image of god so he had something to gain but to to lend his body over to the devil to this idea of mixing with the human race are you with me so he reasoned with the idea genesis chapter 3 verse 13 says and the lord god after the fall now after this all happened the lord god said unto the woman what is this that thou has done and the woman said the serpent beguiled me now did he beguile that means led astray it led me astray from the word of what god originally told me you understand when you're here you're hearing the word of god but understand this the devil's here too and he's he's trying to lead you astray with another gospel and the lord god said unto the serpent and that's the purpose of satan and he will always do that because thou has done this thou art cursed above all cattle and above all the beasts of the field upon thy belly shall thou go and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life so he wasn't on his belly when the act was committed it was afterwards it was part of the curse right the serpent got punished for doing this think about that he got punished for doing this he should have obeyed the word which said every seed shall bring forth of its own kind but he was trying to bring forth of a different kind he reasoned to mingle his seed with man who was in the image of god and god cursed him for it now satan is still trying to mix his seed now what is his seed self-will he's trying to mix his seed with man trying to get people who want to do the will of god and mix his seed with it of course we're we're all born in sin shape and iniquity just because we come to church we come into the truth we repent get baptized it doesn't mean we're scot-free and we don't have to worry about our will no more no jesus said you've got to die daily to that thing you got to deny yourself it's it's there whether you want to accept it or not you want to put blinders on you want to think it's not there it's there that's the tree of knowledge of good and evil you have the knowledge that the will of god is the only will but it's also a tree of evil which means you're going to do your will instead what is the mark of the beast it is the number of the or the name of the beast and the the number of that name they're all three the same the mark of the beast the name of the beast and the number of the name revelation 13 8 says here is wisdom let him that understandeth count the number of the beasts for it is what the number of a man a man's got the same number well what is in common what does man have in common that the most subtle beast has the the the image of the beast what is the same thing the nature that he's born with he's born with the nature to do his will and all the churches out there they're having church without the full word which means they're man-made churches which says the prophet taught us the mark of the beast now man was born with the same image to do his will instead of god's image that's why we must be born again of god's holy spirit which will produce doing his will it's not about just repenting get baptized we're in the kingdom i'm sorry get rid of the thinking that is just the beginning brother branham said to not go on and receive the holy ghost is to automatically or by default receive the mark of the beast which means you have the mark to begin with you're born with the mark that's why the nature of the soul has to be changed are you with me second corinthians chapter 11 verse 2. second corinthians chapter 11 verse 2 says for i am jealous paul said over you with a godly jealousy forever i have espoused you to one husband that i may present you as a chaste virgin to christ okay so we're not allowed to have two husbands we're not allowed to do our will and god's will and the majority of people are satisfied with that the majority of the people have been deceived into thinking that everything's going to be okay as long as you're doing this with god well where do we find that in the bible where do we find those scriptures in the bible we don't find those scriptures in the bible but the devil is able to take the word of god and twist it just like he did with eve he says but i fear lest by any means as the serpent beguiled eve through his septility so your minds should be corrupted corrupted from what not the complex part of being a christian but from the simplicity that's in christ hallelujah the simplicity for if he that cometh preacheth another jesus whom we have not preached see another word the same thing that that the most subtle beast did to eve you will not surely die you don't got to get that serious you don't got to be that faithful you don't got to get that dedicated you don't got to give all of your will all you need to do is this that's how a mind becomes corrupted from the simplicity that's in christ don't let satan tell you anything less than what the word says i'll tell you this is you know jesus said that you need to strive to enter in you're not going to coast your way in just because you're in the message you've got to press in the the the bible says the the kingdom of god suffered violence and the violence they take it by four they say satan get out of my life get behind me i'm pressing into into the complete image of jesus christ we get that soft lukewarm spirit on us now listen to this satan's subtility comes in in our minds through the preaching of another gospel now the thing is i am not saying that any of us sit and we listen to other sermons what i am saying is that spirit that was talking to eve talks to us tries to get us to compromise compromise compromise compromise compromise on this you know this is the main the most important thing that's all you got to worry about as soon as you compromise you slipped away from the simplicity that is in christ you allowed your mind to be corrupted now what is the simplicity that is in christ it's to believe the word of god it's to believe it not intellectually right amen but to believe it unto for obedience to where you're you subject your life to the word you you you do whatever you have to do to obey that word and where you mess up you pick yourself up if a righteous man falls seven times seven times he'll get back up but his pursuit is to do the will of god it's not to get by and to act how righteous we are or how perfect we are or or how much we know the more you know the easier it is for you to get tricked by the devil that's the truth paul had to conclude i know nothing except jesus christ and him being crucified i'm staying near the cross i'm staying where the simplicity of christ is at i'm just going to believe the word of god i'm going to go to church i'm going to hear the word and god's going to speak something to me that he wants me to do in my life when i leave the doors and you know what i'm going to do it i'm not just going to say amen to it and i believe intellectually but i'm going to let this body know who's in charge i'm taking possession of my soul i'm in your patience taki uh possess your souls the bible says we've got to take possession that's where this whole series is going we're just laying the foundation but god wants us to take possession of these gates anything that comes short of complete obedience means that our minds have been beguiled by the same spirit that begot eve we think well that could never happen to me well we have a chance every day to prove that but we need the word to show us if we're doing it or not now when god created man he had given him a soul that's what made him different than everything else that he created on the planet all the other animals and the only way to get into the soul god gave that soul a free more agency free will he himself will not even come in there that's why he stands at the door and he knocks he'll knock he'll call but he will not force himself to go in there he respects your choice he respected cain's choice hey if you do well you're going to be accepted because it's the right way it's the word but if you choose not sin lies at the door that's the only thing left when you if you do not accept god there is only one thing left that's satan that's your will he wanted his will and he was willing to kill to get first place he wanted the inheritance he wanted to be accepted and he was jealous because his brother was accepted because his offering that he brought to the off to the altar was accepted and his wasn't his countenance went down he was discouraged he got jealous and he can he thought of a way how he could remove abel now wonder how many times we've gotten that spirit on us think about that well if we can just get so and so out of the way you know i could get a raise come on you're awful quiet these are real spirits and and they want to dominate now god created our soul so he could live in it he's only going to come and live in it through self uh through the three more agency we've we've got to open the door and let him in you know brother branham said this that there's only two things in our heart and our soul it's either faith or doubt and we were born in doubt we question that's where darwin's theory came from everything come through doubt we question everything it wasn't long before we're calling our mother and father a liar because they promised us something and they never followed through right now we thought we were better and then they showed us that we were liars and then the conflict happened and then we met jesus christ we believed the word we believed that we were sinners we believed we needed saving grace we believed the word the word came inside amen but we've got to receive not just part of the word jesus said man shall not live by part of the word man he's got to live by all the word of god that's the only way we can manifest all the word of god is by receiving it we can't receive a part of god and then expect to manifest all of god brother branham said in a number of cases he said how can you say you have the holy ghost in your life and deny the word it can't be done because the word the holy ghost wrote the word and if the holy ghost is in us then we'll act like the holy ghost we'll act like those we'll paint like beethoven we'll paint like rim bar and we'll play like beethoven you know what i'm saying well i like the image that god created us to be in so i see we all i look at myself i think i need to be pressing towards the mark i didn't wake up this morning i looked in the mirror and said oh there's jesus christ you just lay back you're good there no i i i don't know what you i looked at my all my imperfections today we come here because there's a long name inside of us a longing to be in his image and and the more i hunger the more i thirst the more i'll get filled the more i allow the world to satisfy me to numb me a spiritual amnesia a lukewarm laodicea the harder it will be for me to manifest christ our self-will is exercised every time we come to church god presents us with his word then we exercise our self will to let god's will come in amen to let the word take preeminence in our life not just to kind of talk it and well you know so many people take their bible and they just tuck it on the shelf put it on the shelf wait to the next service that is not what you do when you take the word amen that's right amen you can't wait to live it david said i can't wait till those doors are open one thing i've longed for that way seek after all the days of my life that i will dwell in the house of the lord to behold the beauty of the lord and it wasn't just church time it was so when we got to church when he got to church he could receive what god had for that he could take it out and become the church to the world become the church to those that are around him wants to be expressed he's no longer here in his corporal body he's now hearing you and i yeah and there's something about jesus he wants to be expressed in every way not just through the mouth right not just through the preaching but the life has to preach it and then the life has to preach it brother brad says i'd rather have a sherman live before me than to be preached to me amen you know we all have that choice we all have that free more agency to let that happen to let some life be changed because of the way that you act of the choices you make in front of somebody of how you respond when riled against are you gonna rile back are you going to go the second mile are you going to love your enemy are you going to lay down your are you going to live through others are you going to just be selfish to do your own will see sermons are much more readable than we realize we have an opportunity to preach them every day in our homes on our jobs those are the hardest places to preach them come on the hardest place is to preach them is rape with those that you live with you want to know why because you can't just muster up a little energy to do it once and then leave the store or to leave that fine fellowship you just had or to to leave dinner but now you have to live it day in and day out but isn't that what brother branham said a christian really was a hard rugged life living for god every day amen every day brother brahm said in the message you must be born again he said a soul good or bad death doesn't change it how many people think everything's going to be okay when i die god loves me everything's going to be okay he says i had a lot of scriptures wrote down here on this one that i wanted to comment on what a soul is what is a soul it's you you are a soul so today as we're sitting here we have these nice clothes on we shake we're going to shake hands with one another when we leave and watch our brothers sing and our brother testify and we watch their musicians you're up here looking at me you're looking to the right and left and you see one another's body i want you to take your eyes off the body i want you to when you look at one another to look at their soul because that's who you are you are not a body with the soul in it you are a soul with a body around you the emphasis needs to be on your nature it's who you are you are a soul the part inside of you and when you die ever what shape that soul is in that's the way it goes right is the way the tree falls that's the way lies it goes to its destination he says you couldn't pull it up no matter how much you do for it that soul's got to be changed here born again it's got to be changed here so the emphasis the hunger the thirst the desire of our purpose and our reason of coming to church is to get filled with the holy ghost the living word filled why do we struggle seeking god why do we struggle why is it tell me one other place on the planet besides the house of god that you can come and feel at home seeking the lord you can't even do that in some churches you certainly can't do that in restaurants the stores your neighbors i'm saying you can't but you have such an opportunity to get serious with the word here and sometimes we just can't wait till the service is over and i got this i got this you don't understand my busy schedule the word is not for everybody it's for the elect it's those who are hungering to become the word and my job is not to get your body to feel like doing what your soul should be doing we're not entertainers if i'll tell you if we were here to to help make the body feel better i definitely i would become a guest speaker and we would have other people up here who were much better at doing that than i would be i'm just not good at that because i care about your soul and your flesh hates me but that's okay god hates your flesh it's enmity that that that that nature yeah there's a battle that's why when you look at one another love one another's soul not the body fall in love with their soul you'll pray for them you'll help them you'll get down in your knees and you'll wash their feet spiritually our nature has to be changed here brother brahm says the only thing we're taking with us when we leave here is our character it's developed here it's developed here you know you can take remember in those days you take pictures then you go in the dark room and you get into the lights and you put it into the water and you you develop what the picture is it's a process and and every day we go through things and we're so bothered by the things that we go through that we're not even recognizing that god is trying to give us an opportunity to develop our character how we gonna handle that situation are we gonna fret are we gonna be bothered are we gonna get caught up in anxiety are we just gonna say lord you are king of kings and lord of lords uh you're gonna make this work out just the way you want it to work out because i trusted you lord now it don't work out for our flesh it don't it didn't work out for anybody's flesh in the bible it didn't it didn't work out for peter's it didn't work out for paul's it didn't work out for job it didn't work out for nobody's flesh i didn't get to do what i wanted you had to do everything i didn't want to do it's just the way it is get over it [Laughter] start letting your soul become what's most important god knows what your soul needs in the message the ensign 62 brother branham said and death does not change the soul it only changes its dwelling place so i'm interested in changing my so we should have testimonies about our soul changing we should have testimonies we should have people rising up and say my soul has is being changed because there's so many things that can be changed in so many opportunities that god we should come and testify of it i'm all i'm all for testifying for for healings and and getting jobs and and god blessing us i am i am i think we should just always be praising god but there needs to be some some testimonies about soul changing about the nature changing it shouldn't be so quiet and inclusive and and don't want to talk about it god wants us to testify of his greatness not just to help a body but to help a soul well if i was listening this i'd be excited if i was out there and i was listening i'd be excited in the message water separations in 55 brothers brother branham says right in the middle of the heart is a little place in a human being that isn't in an animal a little place in there which is they think it's a soul of man there is not a blood cell touches it or anything and in there is the human soul praise the lord in the message the end time sign seed in 62 brother bryan said but there is only one channel to the inside of that soul show that you're a seed you're a soul body and spirit and then the one channel and avenue one way to into that is your free more agency that is you can receive it or reject it whatever you want to do let me ask you a question you ever sat in church heard the word of god and just kind of been bothered by what was just said would you be honest with me for a moment have you ever felt like that yes okay what's happening at that point is you are exercising your free more agency your free will maybe you thought it was personal maybe you thought it was wrong who knows but that was if it was god i'll just say it like this if it was god you're rejecting god think about it you may think it was brother john or some preacher you know we spend too much time sitting on the seat of judgment instead of just being that humble child of god that says lord not my will but thine be done our self-will will determine where we're at forget about unpredestinated if we're so predestinated why in the world do we got a self-will you got a self-will to exercise it amen and that's great that you can tell me you're predestinated that's wonderful but i'll tell you don't you think your self-will should line up with what you're saying is predestinated that's why the prophet said those preachers should stay away from predestination it confuses more than it helps i'm not saying it don't have its place and there's times that we need to just know that we know that we know that we know that we're predestinated i understand that but don't you understand that the devil preaches another gospel that you can do whatever you want to do you're still predestinated fourth tongue right right fork tongue predestinated but you can do what you want to do act the way you want to act you just serve god your way we've got to have our life line up from cover to cover it's only going to happen if that is your will if it's only your if it's your will and then if it's your will you've got to stay focused on it and desire it and hunger for it so much you've literally got to be sober be vigilant because you're adversary the devil he's walking around seeking whom he can get off track because that's what happened to eve took her away from the road that she should have been walking on and he uses all the senses uses our outside senses and then that second round senses okay it's we'll get into that more but nothing can separate us from the love of god if we do his will nothing if we will to do our will instead of god's will then by default we will become separated from god how many people claim the promises of god and they are not submissive to the word of god and jesus made it real clear if you love me just keep my commandments we are where we're at right now in our walk with god simply by our choice the choices that we've made we're here today because of the choices we've made if you want to be in a different spot make a different decision if you always do what you always done you're always going to get what you always got so simply choose differently choose differently and uh this is how real it has to be if everybody in the church here decides to stay in a lukewarm condition oh that's not implying that you're in a lukewarm condition if everybody in the church decides to stay in the condition that they're in let's say they were in a lukewarm condition what choice will you make what choice are you going to make this word is not for everybody in here there's in every church there's three types of beliefs right there's the mixed belief called the mate believer there's i don't believe that and then don't have to be with the whole gospel i could just be part of it but just literally coming out and saying i don't believe that and then you've got the believer who believes every word of god amen no if everybody falls asleep as it were are you going to be the one that says i'm making a different decision for my future i don't want to be in the same spot that i was in we made that same decision when we all came to christ did we not that's what that's what took us from a world of sin to where we're where we're at but it doesn't stop here that decision has to be made every day as as god gives us new word and and a new and further direction for our walk because he's leading us to the statue of a perfect man to the character of jesus christ and he's speaking something directly to us but if we're so caught up in the flesh you're so tired or just in another place you're going to miss it you're going to miss it you have to be prepared for the word and you know what prepares you for the word is the hunger it's hunger it's not just uh i'm going to go to church and pray for a little bit and try to get prepared that is not good enough because you're not preparing just a part of you you're preparing the whole you the whole you you you you you could try to prepare your heart but if your body isn't rested your mind is going to be in rough shape are you with me you know how hard it is to do something when you're you're in pain or or your head is just beaten with a terrible headache how hard it is to function well if you're just not prepared how are you going to receive the word sitting here in church doesn't make you prepared you're not prepared just because you're here getting here plopping in the seat going through the exercise of the songs and the hearing the word and and leaving church it doesn't mean we've received amen that's right and even if you do receive i'm not saying we won't receive something but the thing is god has something special and it's for your soul and and he and i'm not saying god wants to heal our bodies he wished we'd prosper at all things be in health he wants to bless us in every direction but i'll tell you one thing brother branham said this statement he said you can be healed by god almighty and you will get sick and you will die again you will eventually die but he said that soul will continue to live forever that's where we need the healing to take place is in the soul and our soul we can get vexed daily like lot did and so we need to get into that word and shake off the world amen shake off the things of the world so we're here by the choice that we have made and if we make the choice to draw nigh to god he will draw an eye to us but if we just make the choice to sit here go through the emotion of just being here that doesn't mean we're going to draw an eye to god i don't care how much knowledge we get of the word and i'll tell you the knowledge of the word is dangerous it'll kill you it'll definitely haunt you when you're in your home and you don't want to obey it it'll bring condemnation so something in something in this room praise god something is here called the living word and that's looking to make contact with your soul he wants to come in that little compartment in a greater measure now not saying he's not there i'm saying in the measure he wants to be there in he wants to come in there in a greater measure push out the stuff that shouldn't be there make the changes in your life hallelujah instead of you saying i'm going to go here and i'm going to go there and i'm going to do this and i'm going to do that god says no way he said that's that that both that evil is bolstein it's wrong he said you should say if it be the will of the lord if it be the will of the lord god wants to come in and have his will with your life i i i'm going to just be first to make it real clear i need to do more of the will of god i need to let god's will be more preeminent in my life i know there's things that i hold back so this word isn't just for you this word is for me i need this word i need my soul completely like the image of christ so if we really want to draw closer to god then we'll just simply start seeking him more we'll keep seeking and searching until we with all of our heart and then we'll have it but god is requiring us to do our part in this wonderful relationship but if we choose to love our will more than to seek him well we're going to come short of what all of us want and all of us really want god the peace of god the love of god the joy of the lord in our life we want the power to dominate every spirit right in my name they'll cast out devils but we don't want to be someone who's not living the life and then have some deep devil look at us and laugh and say jesus i know paul i know brother branham i know brother johnson i know but who are you i don't want that i want him on the inside when i'm not dealing with the demon instead of just calling on him when there's a demon around are you with me praise the lord brother braham said it's easy to know where we're going when we leave here it's very easy he says look at where you're being drawn to i love the simplicity in christ just look look what happens when you wake up on monday and where you're being drawn to that that shows you where you're being pulled to there's there's a deep calling there's a deep to respond no wonder brother adam could say eternal life is living for others because you're no longer living for your will but the will of god is to live for others are you with me nothing nothing is stopping us from a closer walk with god nothing nothing nothing nothing nothing no devil no demon no wife no husband no job just your choice you can't get away from the fact of your calling the shots if you want more of god choose to pay the price if you're content and you're going to put it all on the preacher put it all on the feel good message you're going to come short because you need to be a person that if the whole world went to hell you would still serve god that you would still choose to live for him every single day in the midst of babylon it's fallen one day nothing is stopping us from more of the love of god for more of the holy ghost from more of the power of god to be used by god more homie wants to be used by god more nothing is stopping that except us right you don't don't don't let bleed the devil and says well you know you you just you don't deserve joy you can't love you don't you don't got power because choose to spend more time with god choose to get in prayer with the lord choose to meet him and choose to just open up your heart to him amen he's going like this he wants to come in and give us the holy ghost so much more than we want it let's face the fact but he can't give it to us he's not going to slide it under the door or press his way in he's not going to burglar his way into our heart he loves us but the relationship that he requires is free more agency you've got to love him back now satan's different he's a manipulator he will show you pictures of how good it is if you take this liquor he'll show you a beautiful woman dressed in velvet showing every part of her body but will not show you the cancer your liver will get he'll not show you the lung cancer you'll get with those pretty uh mountains and glistening white teeth somebody's selling a pack of cigarettes but you know he's speaking that same agenda to all of our minds every day and it's up to us to call it out it's us up to to recognize that i am a soul that belongs to god my soul was created for god to live in to manifest himself in just a little bit more in the message the messiah in 61 brother branham said then on the inside he's got one gate one entrance to go into the shekinah glory where god can enter into him and take over in the control tower now he's saying it's the control tower and that way is through will you want god dad control your life self will give him self give him your will you can't barter with him i try to barter with him don't work whether you will or not will that's up to you but that's the only avenue that opens to the man that god can come into his heart is by self will puts them back like adam and eve on freemore agency again you can choose right or wrong either one you want i just want to inject this choose you this day whom you'll serve you can literally have that question given to you every single day you got to make the choice every day you make the choice those of you that work you make the choice to get up and go to work those that don't go to work you choose to get up and feed the birds you choose you choose to do something every day we choose to serve the lord it's not an automatic if you want the automatic default is that cockaburn nature that wants to do its own will he says now self will then god comes into the man to the heart now when a man is converted say just like that little white button starts in his heart now that part is god and when he's born again with the spirit of god god's spirit dwells in him now he can let the spirit grow and take out all the roots of bitterness press god's way through again amen he could become back in the same condition that he was when he was in the garden of eden you notice he uses the word grow grow it's not it's not automatic when you're not feeding on the word but you feed on the word and you pray and you hunger and you thirst you will become but you stop short and you just let church attendance be your only feeding you're gonna come short the whole laodicea is deceived in need of nothing we are need of god we must remember who we really are we are a soul inside of a body brother branham said that soul that's inside of you is worth ten thousand worlds you know a lot of times we'll disrespect other humans it's like we forget they have a soul or we feel that where our soul is worth ten thousand and one i don't know what it is disrespect is to me it's a great trait of lucifer that's true right because that's what he had when he disrespected god he left heaven we need to value one another value the soul that's inside of one another this week and every time you talk to somebody don't imagine what they look like imagine that soul every time you look at them get your eyes off their body just kind of look into their heart try to help that one because a body that's functioning together is helping one another it's not about i just want my platform and i don't care about anybody else it's if in fact if god is really really there preeminent you'll go after the one that needs to help the most and you won't be saying that's not my job you won't be telling god what your job is you will allow god to tell you what your job is amen let's stand together god bless you we were going to continue on who we really are how many is enjoying hearing who you really are part of the reason that we're getting into this is that there is a part of us that has been tricked by the enemy and we just got to unveil that we've got to take the cover off of satan who's tricking us there is a reason that you ever do something you just think oh that was so stupid why did i do that i should have never done that and then you ever let god just he just uses your body and some beautiful thing happens and you feel good now when both of those happen can it become confusing when you're going through trial that's what this series is about it's to help us to identify how they both can happen and how to keep only one to to happen in our life because you know free more agency we can get things mixed up you know god is is not so in control of our life that we we we we're sinless it's not like that and it and and i'm i'm really glad for this and i'm gonna tell you why it makes our dependency so much more in god and that's what god really wants he wants us to depend on him and trust him and say god i need you because if we're not activating that thing then we're falling into the lukewarm amen i am so needy so needy of you i am so needy lord [Music] to be more like you share all my rights away in this world of sin i am so needy lord be pure within [Music] i am so needy lord so needy of you i am so needy lord to be more like you share all my rights away in this world of sin i am so needy lord to be pure with me [Music] amen if i could just for a moment and hope this is okay with you if i could get every eye to be closed every eye to be closed just for a moment maybe just if you can if you got the strength to lift your hands towards heaven and i don't want you to be thinking that we're in a room full of bodies i want you to just imagine the very best that you can it is the hands of your soul that are being lifted up and that we're in a room of other souls that are hungering for the same thing that you're hungering for to be more like jesus and i want you just to pray with me our heavenly father we're coming to you with all of our hearts lord we are opening wide that that door of free more agency we're welcoming you to come into our hearts lord in ways that we've never experienced before we're longing for you to to take such a a control in our life lord

live for god the way they want to that they can't have the victory the way they want to that they're like stuck in a certain place and if you're here today and you feel like you're stuck like you just
