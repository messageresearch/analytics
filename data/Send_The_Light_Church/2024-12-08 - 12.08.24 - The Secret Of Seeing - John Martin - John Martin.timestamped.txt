[36:14] we need to do so we humbly submit oursel
[36:19] to you this morning for our hearts
[36:22] prepared ready to receive you Lord may
[36:24] you come now and break the bread of life
[36:26] to us
[36:28] and we'll be careful to appreciate you
[36:33] well after the service today for we ask
[36:36] these things in Jesus Christ's name amen
[36:39] amen amen turn with me if you would to 1
[36:41] Corinthians chapter
[36:44] 2en 1 Corinthians chapter
[36:48] 2 and we've read this scripture not too
[36:51] long ago but we want to title the
[36:54] message The Secret of
[36:56] seeing the secet secret of
[37:01] seeing and for a subject loving Christ
[37:05] is the secret to
[37:08] seen amen 1 Corinthians chapter
[37:11] 2 verse number
[37:14] nine but as it is written I have not
[37:17] seen nor ear heard neither have it
[37:19] entered into the heart of man the things
[37:21] which God have prepared for them that
[37:24] love
[37:25] him but God have revealed them them unto
[37:28] us by his spirit for the spirit
[37:29] searcheth all things ye the Deep things
[37:32] of God Amen God bless you you may be
[37:39] seated without spiritual eyes we simply
[37:42] cannot see
[37:44] reality Jesus said it like this you'll
[37:47] see but you do not
[37:49] understand so in other words you can't
[37:52] see with
[37:53] accuracy everybody's got an opinion when
[37:57] they said
[37:57] who do men say that I am they all had an
[38:01] opinion they weren't lacking
[38:03] opinion but they they didn't have eyes
[38:06] to see therefore they they weren't seen
[38:10] with accuracy they didn't understand and
[38:13] it really takes God's holy spirit to
[38:15] open our eyes so we can see
[38:19] correctly I think the most important
[38:21] thing I believe for a Believer is to
[38:23] know really who Jesus is
[38:27] because the Bible says when he comes
[38:29] we're going to be just like
[38:30] him so if our vision of Jesus is
[38:33] something less than what he is then
[38:36] we'll just become what we what we view
[38:38] him as if we just think he's someone
[38:41] that just daddy old grandfather or or
[38:44] Santa Claus then he just there to supply
[38:47] our needs then that's all he's going to
[38:48] be if he's just going to be out there to
[38:50] to be a Healer then it's always going to
[38:52] be but the Bible teaches us who Jesus
[38:56] Christ really
[38:58] is and it's from cover to cover and he's
[39:00] a lot more than what we visualize him
[39:03] being and I think it's just important
[39:05] for us to always be praying Lord open my
[39:09] eyes that I can see you
[39:12] plainly one time Elisha's servant gesley
[39:16] he looked through carnal eyes when he
[39:19] saw that he was surrounded by the enemy
[39:21] and Elijah prayed that God would open
[39:23] his eyes so that he could see the hills
[39:26] were full of horses and Chariots of Fire
[39:30] from
[39:31] Heaven Elijah said fear not for they
[39:34] that be with us are more than they that
[39:36] be with
[39:37] them and this morning if we could look
[39:40] into that Dimension we would see that
[39:43] there would be Angels camped round about
[39:46] us today they're here brother B said the
[39:49] angel of the Lord that God is
[39:51] represented here where the message is
[39:54] being
[39:55] preached and so though we came can't see
[39:57] it we believe
[40:00] it 2 Kings 6:18 says and when the enemy
[40:04] came down to them Elisha prayed unto the
[40:06] Lord and said Smite this people I pray
[40:11] thee with blindness and he smoke them
[40:13] with blindness according to the word of
[40:15] Elisha so here God purposely blinds
[40:18] people and purposely opens the
[40:22] eyes oh what we want to do is find out
[40:25] what makes it go either way we want to
[40:28] find how we can get on the side of
[40:30] making sure that God is opening our eyes
[40:33] amen this man of God had a love
[40:37] relationship with God and through prayer
[40:40] his eyes were open I'll say that is the
[40:42] secret for us we're never ever going to
[40:46] know God without a love relationship it
[40:48] is
[40:49] impossible because that is the the first
[40:52] criteria love the Lord thy God with all
[40:54] thy heart with all th might with
[40:56] everything that you have
[40:57] Amen brother Bram says I'd rather just
[41:00] spend five minutes with him in his
[41:02] presence than to spend five years in
[41:04] some Seminary learning about
[41:08] God his presence and that takes a love
[41:11] to get into his presence because the
[41:13] flesh just doesn't want
[41:15] to Matthew
[41:17] 11:20 then began he to upgrade the
[41:20] cities wherein most of his mighty Works
[41:22] were done because they repented not so
[41:24] in other words Jesus was really helping
[41:27] the people and showing that God was
[41:29] alive among them and they didn't believe
[41:32] the words that he was speaking we have a
[41:34] lot to learn just by that statement
[41:36] there he says woe unto thee coren woe
[41:40] unto thee Bethesda for if the mighty
[41:42] Works had been done in you that had been
[41:46] done in tyri and sidon they would be
[41:47] they were repented long ago in sackcloth
[41:50] and Ashes so here Works were done among
[41:55] them and and they didn't repent but if
[41:59] the same Works would have been done in
[42:01] another place they would have repented
[42:03] it's shown that there's a greater
[42:05] judgment coming but I say to you it
[42:08] shall be more tolerable for Tyrie and
[42:10] siden at the day of judgment than for
[42:13] you do you know there's more truth given
[42:16] in this hour than any other hour we'll
[42:18] be held accountable more amen there's a
[42:21] lot more to repent for amen but thou
[42:25] cernium which are exalted unto heaven
[42:27] shall be brought down to hell for if the
[42:29] mighty Works which had been done in thee
[42:31] had been done in Sodom it would have
[42:34] remained unto this day think about that
[42:36] statement because we know how Wicked
[42:38] Sodom
[42:39] was all the
[42:42] perversion just burned and and Lot's
[42:45] wife turned into salt and here Jesus is
[42:48] saying
[42:50] that if if the works that the people
[42:54] experienced when Jesus was there had
[42:56] been done at that time it would remain
[42:58] to this
[43:00] day and what what what would have
[43:02] changed it one thing
[43:04] repentance repentance turn it
[43:07] around for I say to you that it shall be
[43:10] more tolerable for the land of Sodom in
[43:13] the day of judgment than for
[43:16] thee wow and they they didn't see the
[43:18] the thing was to hear Jesus is saying it
[43:20] but they didn't think that right their
[43:22] eyes were blind and so he says here in
[43:25] his prayer the very next verse ver at
[43:28] that time at that particular time Jesus
[43:32] answered the situation and said I thank
[43:35] the oh Father Lord of Heaven and Earth
[43:37] because thou has hid these things from
[43:38] the wise and The
[43:41] Prudent a group of people that were wise
[43:45] and prudent in their own
[43:47] eyes and is revealed them unto babes
[43:50] which babes don't think they got it all
[43:53] together and he said even so father for
[43:56] it seemed good in thy sight and all
[43:58] things are delivered unto me of the
[43:59] father and no man knoweth the son but
[44:01] the father neither knoweth any man the
[44:03] father Sav the son and he to who soever
[44:08] the son will
[44:10] reveal him we are at the mercies of
[44:14] Jesus Christ today opening our eyes to
[44:17] see him we could sit here and we could
[44:20] try to understand the scriptures that
[44:22] are being said intellectually make sense
[44:26] put them together
[44:27] logically look at them but unless God
[44:31] opens them to us we really can't see
[44:35] there's a secret to all the truth and
[44:39] it's right here that God would reveal
[44:43] himself to us to become like a babe be
[44:47] humble a
[44:49] babe babe is always
[44:52] dependent I mean if we we let amariah
[44:57] just here we say find your own way
[44:59] home it's just not going to
[45:02] happen but we that are older are old
[45:06] enough to know how to get home but a
[45:08] babe is
[45:10] dependent dependent on on clothes what
[45:12] we going to eat and just to a rough over
[45:16] my head amen and this is the type of a
[45:19] Christian that God reveals himself to
[45:21] one that is dependent on him amen don't
[45:25] be a old all
[45:27] don't talk like you got it all figured
[45:30] out don't talk like you know
[45:33] everything be
[45:35] meek Jesus said take my yoke upon you
[45:38] and learn of me for I am meek and low in
[45:43] heart and you shall find rest unto your
[45:47] souls Jesus said learn of me I he
[45:51] identifies himself with
[45:54] meekness he wasn't worried about his
[45:56] reput
[45:57] utation he took upon himself the form of
[46:00] a servant he humbled himself he was Meek
[46:04] God is
[46:06] Meek if God is Meek it'll take meekness
[46:09] to learn who God
[46:12] is you're not going to find out how Meek
[46:15] God is through some arrogancy or Pride
[46:18] if God is lowly in heart it will take a
[46:20] lowly heart to find rest for our
[46:23] souls about the very fact when we first
[46:25] gave our heart to God where worry we
[46:27] were
[46:28] broken we were needy we were we knew we
[46:32] had a revelation that we were lost
[46:34] without Jesus Christ amen and in that
[46:37] condition God came down because you were
[46:40] lowly he dwells with them of a humble
[46:42] and contrite
[46:44] heart and he lifted you up set you
[46:48] free the way that God does things hasn't
[46:51] changed since that day friends he is the
[46:54] same yesterday today and forever he
[46:55] still dwells on among the the lowly
[46:58] that's who he is he does not feel
[46:59] comfortable with
[47:01] Satan no th those those demons got
[47:05] kicked
[47:07] out evil spirits you don't feel
[47:10] comfortable with evil
[47:13] spirits you you you got to get serious
[47:15] with them because they'll do you
[47:18] damage now God hides himself from the
[47:21] wise and The
[47:23] Prudent prudent is someone who can
[47:25] mentally he able to put things together
[47:29] to make them sound the way they should
[47:32] be Proverbs 3:7 says be not wise in
[47:35] thine own eyes but fear the lord and
[47:37] depart from Evil is literally evil to be
[47:41] wise in your own
[47:42] eyes Isaiah
[47:44] 5:21 woe unto them that are wise in
[47:48] thine own eyes and prudent in their own
[47:53] sight whoa God will keep him self from
[47:57] those who are wise and and and prudent
[48:01] in their own eyes that's why it's
[48:03] important for you not to look at
[48:05] yourself as something even in the
[48:07] slightest little
[48:09] way and here the way to do it is don't
[48:13] look at somebody who is in worse
[48:15] condition than
[48:17] you that'll help you if you look at
[48:20] somebody that you want to be like right
[48:22] I want to be like Paul I want to be like
[48:24] Jesus well that'll help you to stay
[48:27] humble amen there's a secret to seeing
[48:30] all the truth and the secret is getting
[48:33] humble enough that God will reveal the
[48:35] treasures of his character to you
[48:38] because that's all he's coming back for
[48:40] he's not coming back for our money he's
[48:42] not coming back for our successes he's
[48:45] not coming back for a list of
[48:47] achievements he's coming back to marry a
[48:50] bride with his character and that's it
[48:53] he's looking for character brother
[48:55] that's the only thing we're taking with
[48:56] this woman
[48:57] believe what what is character character
[48:59] is Jesus Christ in your flesh that's
[49:01] what character is power without it is
[49:07] satanic he to whomsoever the son will
[49:11] reveal
[49:13] him don't you want to be the one that
[49:15] God reveals Amen brother Braham said
[49:19] pray for
[49:21] Revelation it's the most important thing
[49:23] that we could pray for but if you don't
[49:25] humble yourself
[49:28] you're not going to get
[49:30] Revelation because we've been told he
[49:33] hides from the wise and
[49:34] prudent he hides himself from the proud
[49:37] and the
[49:38] Arrogant he resists them so yes we got
[49:42] to pray for Revelation but we must pray
[49:44] with
[49:46] humility with with humbleness and
[49:48] loneliness and in a
[49:53] need the the time that you think you
[49:55] don't need anymore is the time you need
[49:57] to get to the altar get right with God
[50:00] because the spirit is
[50:04] wrong Paul said 2 Corinthians 4 but if
[50:08] our gospel be hid it is hid to them that
[50:11] are
[50:12] lost not hid to them that are
[50:15] saved that's why we should have this
[50:18] expectation that God wants to reveal all
[50:20] himself to us but if her if in whom the
[50:24] God of this world have blinded the minds
[50:27] of them which believe not lest the light
[50:29] of the Glorious gospel of Christ who is
[50:31] in the image of God should shine upon
[50:34] them blindness sets in when a person
[50:37] doesn't believe the truth and I don't
[50:40] care who's telling it to you I don't
[50:42] care if it's a 4-year-old an 8-year-old
[50:44] a 12y old a 100y old if the truth is
[50:47] being spoken to you if you do not
[50:49] receive that truth and walk in blindness
[50:52] is automatically going to set in your
[50:53] life amen
[50:56] we're told that blindness sets in when a
[50:59] spirit of hate gets on any one of
[51:02] us automatically blindness sets in
[51:05] because when you start to love less or
[51:07] give respect to persons to anybody God
[51:10] says that's a no no that's not my spirit
[51:12] that is the spirit of the
[51:14] devil blindness sets in when we are
[51:17] satisfied with just hearing the
[51:21] word right just satisfi what hearing I
[51:24] don't really need to like put this into
[51:25] practice so you you you here's some
[51:29] ammonition to get blind that's what I
[51:32] just gave
[51:34] you it's it isn't somebody coming to you
[51:37] and preaching to you some false Doctrine
[51:39] no you can see that thing on my all
[51:41] way but this Spirit of I don't have
[51:47] to because you know who's going to be in
[51:50] heaven brother BR says it's those that
[51:53] want to be
[51:54] there those that are
[51:57] are hungering to be like God thirsting
[52:00] to be like
[52:04] God God is more eager this morning to
[52:07] reveal himself to us than we are to have
[52:11] him now I not I'm just I'm talking
[52:13] spiritually now because we know that the
[52:16] seminaries and the colleges and all
[52:18] these places are filled with people who
[52:20] give money to go to them to learn about
[52:22] God build they have that desire
[52:27] but unwilling to Humble
[52:30] themselves to get some neology instead
[52:33] of some
[52:34] theology you understand I'm saying if
[52:37] you get Ser if you really want to know
[52:39] God get in that prayer room just spend
[52:41] five minutes get in his presence spend
[52:43] five minutes and I'm going to tell you
[52:44] you're going to feel a lot
[52:46] better you just can't go in there and
[52:48] pray you got to break through you got to
[52:50] pray through until the Holy Ghost
[52:53] comes you got to meet God
[52:58] I wish I could just say every time you
[53:00] pray you met
[53:08] God David said if I make my bed in hell
[53:12] God is there yes God is everywhere he
[53:13] knows everything but you know what I
[53:15] want to be I want to be lifted up into
[53:18] his presence I want to be caught up into
[53:20] Heavenly places with Jesus Christ that
[53:23] means I got to get out of the the
[53:25] carnality of of of Just My
[53:29] Flesh blessed are they that hunger and
[53:33] thirst after
[53:35] righteousness blessed are the meat for
[53:37] they shall inherit the earth blessed are
[53:39] your eyes for they see God is more eager
[53:43] to reveal himself to us than we want I
[53:46] think we just need to increase our
[53:47] hunger and
[53:49] thirst Jesus said blessed are thou Simon
[53:52] bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood have not
[53:55] revealed the secrets unto
[53:59] you but my Father which is in heaven
[54:02] Upon This Rock The Rock of whom God
[54:05] reveals truth to which is Jesus Christ
[54:10] he's the only
[54:11] truth upon the revealing of who Jesus is
[54:16] is The Rock in which he builds his
[54:17] church in other words he's building
[54:19] Jesus Christ in
[54:24] you you are the tab of God it's not
[54:28] about claiming I I'm in the
[54:32] message I've been there five years it's
[54:35] not claiming that it's when you can get
[54:38] up in the morning look in the mirror and
[54:39] say I'm so sick of you I don't want I
[54:41] want Jesus Christ to be I want to look
[54:43] at Jesus Christ I want people to see
[54:45] Christ in me I want them to see the
[54:46] character in me I want better to handle
[54:48] things the way that Jesus handles them
[54:51] with the the right character the right
[54:53] the right spirit
[54:57] because the Pharisees could put us to
[55:02] shame they just didn't have the right
[55:05] Spirit Jesus said I will build my church
[55:09] and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail
[55:11] against it this is the
[55:15] secret the
[55:18] secret to receiving truth Nicodemus was
[55:23] I'll say a top-notch Pharisee
[55:28] he was a ruler of the Jews the Bible
[55:30] says in other words he taught
[55:32] others yet when he came to church Jesus
[55:36] was preaching his spiritual eyes could
[55:39] not understand what the new birth
[55:42] meant he couldn't understand what it
[55:45] means to be born again by God's word he
[55:48] automatically went to Natural thinking
[55:50] when the word was being preached just
[55:52] being natural
[55:53] natural and God was speaking in the
[56:01] spiritual he knew the Bible but he
[56:04] didn't know
[56:06] God I mean think about it Satan knows
[56:10] the Bible better than
[56:12] anybody but he's not walking he's not
[56:14] born
[56:16] again so it's not about
[56:20] knowing knowing the
[56:23] word the letter of the word but knowing
[56:25] the Spirit of the word that's what's
[56:28] important the
[56:31] spirit Jesus said art thou a master of
[56:35] Israel a master and knowest not these
[56:38] things see there's a secret to knowing
[56:41] the
[56:45] truth I I don't want to go through all
[56:47] my life trying learning and not knowing
[56:54] him it's scary
[56:58] 1 Peter 1 verse 22 says seen ye have
[57:01] purified your souls this is how you do
[57:04] it you want your soul purified how many
[57:05] wants your soul purified listen to this
[57:09] scripture seeing you purified your souls
[57:12] how in obeying the
[57:17] word you simply take Serious the word
[57:20] that's preached to you and you say I
[57:22] want to do that and you start doing it
[57:25] amen and you don't know where to start
[57:26] but you go home and you dedicate
[57:28] yourself to spending 20 minutes a day in
[57:31] prayer just start with
[57:34] that open your Bible and say God open my
[57:38] eyes to see you because obviously I'm
[57:40] not seeing you the way I need to and
[57:43] when God says something to you start
[57:45] obeying it and automatically your soul
[57:47] will become more
[57:51] purified through the Holy Spirit unto
[57:55] unfeigned love of the Brethren see that
[57:57] you love one another with a pure
[58:02] heart I don't want anybody loving me
[58:05] with an unpure
[58:07] heart you know it just feels
[58:10] ugly but a pure heart fervently being
[58:14] born again not of a corruptible seed but
[58:17] Incorruptible by the word of God which
[58:21] liveth and abideth forever it's the only
[58:23] thing that can change I mean the word is
[58:24] going to be there when the dust all
[58:26] settles Revelation Armageddon is all
[58:30] over with who's going to be standing
[58:31] there the word of God is going to be
[58:33] standing
[58:36] there that's why they said to brother
[58:38] Brandon when the bombs fa fall where do
[58:40] you want to be would you want to be in
[58:41] the bomb shelter you want to be in
[58:43] heaven he says no no no I want to be in
[58:45] a bomb shelter and I only want to be in
[58:47] heaven because heaven and Earth's going
[58:49] to pass away say I want to be in the
[58:53] word I want to be clothed with the word
[58:55] I want to be the word that don't happen
[58:57] unless there's a love relationship God
[59:00] is not going to force himself he's not
[59:02] going to force the word in us we've got
[59:04] to develop a love for the word and in
[59:08] order for that to De you've got to deny
[59:10] the flesh who doesn't love the word amen
[59:13] there's the
[59:17] battle Paul was taught the things of God
[59:20] by
[59:21] Gia who is one of the most noble
[59:24] teachers of his day right amen I'm told
[59:28] that he was the first Paul was the first
[59:32] designated uh Rabin a title that
[59:35] indicated greater knowledge of the
[59:38] scriptures than a
[59:41] rabbi so he was up
[59:43] there he he was up
[59:46] there but this is what Paul
[59:50] said you know I usually don't get um
[59:56] you know warm you know what that
[1:00:01] means Philippians
[1:00:03] 3:5 so he was way up
[1:00:08] there but this is what and he's given
[1:00:11] his credentials some of his credentials
[1:00:13] here he was circumcised the eth day the
[1:00:15] stock of Israel The Tribe of Benjamin a
[1:00:16] Hebrew of the Hebrews as touching the
[1:00:18] law of Pharisee concerning Zeal he
[1:00:20] persecuted the church touching the
[1:00:22] righteousness which was in the law he
[1:00:24] was blameless When anybody looked at
[1:00:26] this man they said yes he's going to be
[1:00:27] our next
[1:00:29] president we want him to lead
[1:00:32] us he's the one that we know he knows
[1:00:37] the way to
[1:00:40] God and he was talking to King Agrippa
[1:00:43] in Acts chapter
[1:00:45] 26:5 and they which knew Paul from the
[1:00:49] beginning could testify that after the
[1:00:51] most strictest sect of religion he lived
[1:00:54] a Pharisee and many of the Saints did he
[1:00:58] said I shut up in the
[1:01:00] prison you talk about the doors
[1:01:03] closing somebody coming in
[1:01:06] here Paul was one of those guys who went
[1:01:09] into the church dragged him
[1:01:13] out killed
[1:01:15] them that's the truth many of the saints
[1:01:17] that I shut up in prisons having
[1:01:19] received Authority from the chief priest
[1:01:21] and when they were put to death I gave
[1:01:24] my voice against them he he was guilty
[1:01:26] of killing the
[1:01:29] Christians and I punish them often in
[1:01:31] the synagogues and compel them to
[1:01:33] blaspheme trying to get them to say
[1:01:36] something against God against the Holy
[1:01:40] Ghost and be can you imagine can you
[1:01:43] imagine anybody trying to do good and
[1:01:47] somebody comes by and says that's not
[1:01:50] really necessary
[1:01:56] you know they don't have to take a you
[1:01:57] know Pitchfork or a gun but just Ah
[1:01:59] that's not necessary you know that's the
[1:02:01] same thing as a
[1:02:02] gun it's the same
[1:02:09] Spirit compel them to blaspheming being
[1:02:12] exceeding mad against them I persecuted
[1:02:14] them even unto strange
[1:02:18] cities all this happened because Paul
[1:02:22] was blind
[1:02:26] even though he was taught by the best
[1:02:28] amen given
[1:02:31] papers go carry out this great thing for
[1:02:35] your religion he was literally blind
[1:02:37] from knowing
[1:02:39] god but he could tell you everything
[1:02:41] that happened with the children of
[1:02:42] Israel when they came out when they came
[1:02:44] out of Egypt he could tell you what
[1:02:46] happened but he was blind to spiritually
[1:02:50] what was happening yes spiritually blind
[1:02:53] to seeing all the truth it was wasn't
[1:02:56] until Paul met Jesus Christ in the
[1:03:00] spiritual realm
[1:03:03] yes what's important here is you're
[1:03:06] you're hearing words spoken you're
[1:03:07] hearing the the Bible
[1:03:10] preached but until you get into that
[1:03:12] spiritual realm where you hear from
[1:03:14] God the eyes are not going to come open
[1:03:17] naturally I'm sorry you can't go to a
[1:03:19] seminary you can't go to a a teaching
[1:03:22] you can't even put on a tape and
[1:03:24] intellectually try to receive from God
[1:03:26] it just doesn't work you've got to enter
[1:03:28] into the spiritual realm because God is
[1:03:31] a spirit and they that worship me must
[1:03:33] worship me in spirit and in truth that's
[1:03:35] where you're going to meet God right it
[1:03:38] wasn't until Paul had a supernatural
[1:03:41] experience where did he have that
[1:03:42] experience brother around he had it in
[1:03:44] his
[1:03:45] heart yes we look at it yeah he got
[1:03:47] kicked off his high horse there was a
[1:03:49] light came he fell down he became blind
[1:03:52] that all happened but you know what that
[1:03:54] could have happened and could have got
[1:03:56] on his horse like all the other men did
[1:03:58] that didn't
[1:04:00] change right the natural thing happened
[1:04:03] but what really happened to Paul is
[1:04:05] something happened inside of his heart
[1:04:08] amen that made him say who art thou Lord
[1:04:11] in other words I thought I knew you but
[1:04:14] I really didn't and and Jesus said I'm
[1:04:18] Jesus who you
[1:04:20] persecuted why you doing what you're
[1:04:22] doing why aren't you trying to do the
[1:04:25] right thing I'm telling you over and
[1:04:27] over and
[1:04:29] over what's it going to take for you to
[1:04:32] get your heart
[1:04:37] right Paul tapped into the secret to
[1:04:41] seen what did he
[1:04:42] do he humbled
[1:04:45] himself the time to humble yourself is
[1:04:48] when really all time is a good time to
[1:04:51] humble yourself but I'm telling you when
[1:04:53] God got your attention and you got
[1:04:55] kicked off your horse that is the time
[1:04:57] to submit to
[1:04:59] God humble
[1:05:02] yourself he was no more wise and prudent
[1:05:05] in his own eyes his spiritual eyes came
[1:05:09] open and he saw Jesus Christ for the
[1:05:12] first
[1:05:13] time now he didn't see him with these
[1:05:16] eyes like the other
[1:05:18] Apostles he saw he saw Jesus with these
[1:05:21] eyes right
[1:05:23] here and I believe this morning we can
[1:05:25] see Jes Jesus with those same eyes
[1:05:27] because he's here he's here you brought
[1:05:31] him he's the word declares that he's
[1:05:36] here he said I'll never leave you I'll
[1:05:38] never forsake you I'll be with you even
[1:05:39] in you to the end we can't deny that God
[1:05:42] is
[1:05:43] here but what we need to do is humble
[1:05:46] ourselves to
[1:05:49] him there was no doubt about his
[1:05:52] experience in Philippians chapter 3:8 he
[1:05:54] says yay
[1:05:56] doubtless there's no more
[1:05:58] doubt I and I count all things but loss
[1:06:04] for the Excellency of the knowledge of
[1:06:06] Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I've
[1:06:07] suffered the loss of all things and I do
[1:06:10] count them but dung that I might win
[1:06:16] Christ now this to
[1:06:20] me is really the example for every
[1:06:23] Christian
[1:06:26] Paul counted the
[1:06:30] cost what it would take for him to
[1:06:33] finish his
[1:06:35] course that he couldn't really find
[1:06:38] Christ if he hung on to some of the
[1:06:41] things that the devil gave
[1:06:45] him you know the devil he loves to fill
[1:06:48] your head with knowledge he wants to
[1:06:50] Puff you
[1:06:52] up with
[1:06:54] knowledge and he actually had to get rid
[1:06:56] of all of it amen in order to win Christ
[1:07:01] to
[1:07:05] win
[1:07:07] everything this is the
[1:07:09] secret to seeing all that Christ is in
[1:07:13] US is count all things
[1:07:16] lost be willing to look at your life and
[1:07:19] say is there things that I'm hanging on
[1:07:21] to that I need to give
[1:07:22] up amen I'm going start amen I'm going
[1:07:26] to start Amen in my own
[1:07:31] word count everything in your life as
[1:07:35] useless just to get Christ remember that
[1:07:39] you can't get Christ with only given
[1:07:41] part of your
[1:07:44] heart if there's a revelation that we
[1:07:46] could really use in this Century that
[1:07:50] we're in is that one we need to Humble
[1:07:54] ourselves
[1:07:56] under the mighty hand of God that he may
[1:07:59] exalt Us in due season and that's
[1:08:02] exactly what God did to
[1:08:05] Paul he got his
[1:08:07] attention but he had to make the choice
[1:08:09] free more agency in his heart to Humble
[1:08:11] himself under the mighty hand of God and
[1:08:15] then he exalted him in due
[1:08:18] season it's truly the example for every
[1:08:20] one of us every day in our life amen
[1:08:23] Luke 14:
[1:08:26] 28 Jesus speaking here in Luke 14:28 he
[1:08:29] says for which of you intend to build a
[1:08:34] tower sth not down first and cth the
[1:08:38] cost whether he have sufficient to
[1:08:41] finish it less happily after he had laid
[1:08:43] the foundation and is not able to finish
[1:08:46] it all that behold it began to what mock
[1:08:50] him saying this man began to build and
[1:08:54] was not able to finish when I was a boy
[1:08:59] I lived
[1:09:00] on a Norway
[1:09:03] Drive no Birch no Norway Drive I'm sorry
[1:09:07] I lived in Norway I had to turn on Birch
[1:09:09] to get to Norway
[1:09:11] Drive and there was a house right on the
[1:09:13] corner of M59 and Birch Road that a man
[1:09:18] had
[1:09:21] built and for all the time that I was
[1:09:23] going through school it just seemed like
[1:09:25] the the thing never got
[1:09:27] built you know like he started it but he
[1:09:30] couldn't finish
[1:09:31] it and I never got any good thoughts
[1:09:34] about
[1:09:35] it I never got any good thoughts like
[1:09:38] well that's wonderful what a good job he
[1:09:41] finished no my thoughts were he wasn't
[1:09:44] able to finish
[1:09:46] amen it's all the same thing here on
[1:09:49] us23 just
[1:09:54] passed ter Road up there for a long time
[1:09:57] a house just
[1:10:01] left you look at somebody who does isn't
[1:10:04] committed to Christ and they're not
[1:10:06] willing to finish their
[1:10:13] building too many people start out and
[1:10:15] say I want to be saved but they don't
[1:10:18] sit down first and seriously consider
[1:10:21] the
[1:10:23] cost are they they willing to walk with
[1:10:26] Christ the rest of their life or they
[1:10:28] just have this somehow mentality if I
[1:10:30] Repent I get baptized I'm saved and you
[1:10:34] know once saved always saved and that's
[1:10:35] really all that matters with my life God
[1:10:38] is not going to look at you like that
[1:10:39] that's why it's important to really know
[1:10:41] who God
[1:10:44] is you know too many people are
[1:10:47] just they've laid the foundation of
[1:10:50] repentance
[1:10:52] baptism but they don't have sufficient
[1:10:55] love
[1:10:57] to finish the course to get the
[1:10:59] character of Jesus Christ inside of them
[1:11:02] am to come to the Statue of a perfect
[1:11:05] man amen the cost is all your
[1:11:09] heart love the Lord thy God with all th
[1:11:12] heart not 5% not even
[1:11:15] [Music]
[1:11:16] 90% it's a serious thing the Bible talks
[1:11:20] about to stand before that Pillar of
[1:11:24] Fire
[1:11:26] it's a how's the scripture say it's a
[1:11:30] our God is a consuming fire it's a
[1:11:33] fearful
[1:11:35] thing we got to give an account one day
[1:11:38] I'll take a look at our how how is
[1:11:41] anybody here under
[1:11:44] 13
[1:11:46] two do you know um right
[1:11:50] now uh you you two have made a lot of
[1:11:53] mistakes
[1:11:55] I put you in the same category as
[1:12:00] Emma and uh
[1:12:03] amariah they've made a lot of
[1:12:06] mistakes they they I'm
[1:12:08] sure that your parents at one time or
[1:12:11] another have not been happy with
[1:12:17] you so as a
[1:12:19] child we do
[1:12:22] things that we shouldn't do but yet God
[1:12:26] looks at us as it's okay because they're
[1:12:31] not at the age of
[1:12:34] accountability but soon as we
[1:12:37] turn whatever that age is it's not
[1:12:40] exactly 1 I'm just going to say that for
[1:12:42] now but maybe it is every I think it
[1:12:44] might be different a little bit for
[1:12:46] everybody but there comes a time where
[1:12:48] god holds us accountable for the things
[1:12:51] that we did
[1:12:58] amen we got to make sure that we're
[1:13:01] willing to give our All to
[1:13:04] Jesus Paul had to sell out everything to
[1:13:08] win Christ and if he had to we have
[1:13:11] to too many people who confess Christ
[1:13:14] only want to give as little as possible
[1:13:17] Right amen but think about this that
[1:13:21] person really is not saying I want a
[1:13:24] love AFF with
[1:13:27] you because A Love Affair means if God
[1:13:31] asks you to sell out you will sell
[1:13:34] out but if you don't want to sell out
[1:13:36] what you're really saying is I don't
[1:13:38] want this strong love affair with you
[1:13:40] and I'm telling you that is the secret
[1:13:42] to knowing god is a love affair with
[1:13:51] him now I remember when I was in the
[1:13:53] world
[1:13:55] I remember being your ages you young
[1:13:58] ones I remember the terrible things I
[1:14:03] did see your
[1:14:05] memory can also be used for the
[1:14:08] bad brother Marty I I I remember the
[1:14:11] songs that we used to listen to that we
[1:14:13] used to dance to that we used to smoke
[1:14:15] to that we used to drink
[1:14:22] to there came a time a a decision had to
[1:14:25] be made in my
[1:14:27] life when God called
[1:14:29] me and I remember the battle going
[1:14:36] on it was a fearful thing I wasn't
[1:14:40] brought up in the truth I was brought up
[1:14:43] in Catholicism which you know pretty
[1:14:44] much you could do whatever you want and
[1:14:46] you're still saved live any kind of life
[1:14:48] you want I went to a funeral my neighbor
[1:14:51] funeral one time oh they they dressed
[1:14:54] them up in a suit he cussed swear did
[1:14:57] everything that had a cigar in his
[1:15:02] mouth I mean people are thinking a
[1:15:06] certain way as it's truth but it's not
[1:15:10] they can't see
[1:15:15] clearly you just have to make the
[1:15:18] decision to be all in for Christ you
[1:15:20] make that decision you don't have to sit
[1:15:23] there and make a decision every time
[1:15:26] about doing it you just do it once and
[1:15:27] you're it's over it's done you just
[1:15:28] serve the
[1:15:30] Lord every thought that comes in your
[1:15:32] head you you you put it towards serving
[1:15:35] God too many people who confess Christ
[1:15:38] only they want to get very little you've
[1:15:40] got to give everything to God you got to
[1:15:43] have sufficient love sufficient oil you
[1:15:46] got to have a sufficiency to make it
[1:15:49] remember the five foolish virgins they
[1:15:51] didn't have sufficient
[1:15:53] oil they had an attitude well I can make
[1:15:56] it without it or I have
[1:15:59] enough you
[1:16:01] can't you need all of God I believe God
[1:16:04] sent the message in this hour to get us
[1:16:07] more filled up amen we can't not make it
[1:16:10] without this message in this
[1:16:12] hour people don't like hearing that
[1:16:15] because they're they're they're they're
[1:16:17] living in a past age right they're
[1:16:20] living in a a past
[1:16:22] age but to whom much is given much is
[1:16:25] required and if God sent a message in
[1:16:28] this hour we got to walk in the light as
[1:16:29] he's in the light and all that God has
[1:16:32] just given us opportunity people that
[1:16:34] want to believe that that's fine that's
[1:16:35] up to them but for me in my house I'll
[1:16:37] serve the
[1:16:39] Lord but it's important for you your
[1:16:42] vessel you're the house of
[1:16:44] God you get a people in your own
[1:16:47] home you know Jesus
[1:16:50] said people of your own household will
[1:16:53] be your enemy that's exactly what he
[1:16:56] said but you know you can still stand
[1:16:58] and say for me in my house I'll serve
[1:17:00] the Lord
[1:17:04] amen we all want to wish everybody's
[1:17:08] going to be saved and everybody's going
[1:17:09] to come in and everybody's going to
[1:17:10] serve we and everybody's going to go on
[1:17:13] the
[1:17:14] Rapture but you know we'd have to throw
[1:17:16] out part of the message we'd have to
[1:17:18] throw out the other two Believers we'd
[1:17:20] have to throw up part of the Bible we'd
[1:17:22] have to throw up the parable of the 10
[1:17:24] virgins
[1:17:26] and the reality is this message this
[1:17:30] ministry is to get a bride ready from
[1:17:32] this church that's what it's for it's
[1:17:35] not for anything else it's not it's not
[1:17:37] for anything
[1:17:41] else brother brandham said in time
[1:17:43] tested Memorials of God he says when you
[1:17:45] come to Christ if you can't absolutely
[1:17:49] sell out Lock Stock and Barrel and come
[1:17:52] to Christ he said don't come at
[1:17:58] all he's saying it like it is but when
[1:18:01] you really want to be a Christian Stand
[1:18:02] Out make it real that's what God wants
[1:18:05] you to be he says that will prove your
[1:18:08] Works will prove what your character is
[1:18:11] I want think about that your Works how
[1:18:14] you live how you act is going to prove
[1:18:18] what spirit is inside of you what
[1:18:20] character you
[1:18:21] have you know God's coming back for
[1:18:23] character right he says your character
[1:18:26] is known by The Works that you do not by
[1:18:30] the words that you
[1:18:31] say not by what you confess with your
[1:18:34] mouth amen it's easy for me to say I
[1:18:38] love you brother the Ron and hate you in
[1:18:42] my
[1:18:43] heart it's easy to do
[1:18:45] that because I'm I'm good at saying I
[1:18:49] love
[1:18:50] you as long as I say
[1:18:52] it how about don't say it but show it
[1:18:56] how about
[1:19:00] that
[1:19:02] there's that's what Jesus had for us he
[1:19:05] didn't just say it he lived it
[1:19:10] amen your character is known by how much
[1:19:13] you love God his
[1:19:16] word god hides himself from certain
[1:19:18] individuals who refuse to deny their own
[1:19:22] Pride look at all the other men that
[1:19:25] were with Paul they were all they all
[1:19:27] fell off their high horse they all heard
[1:19:30] a voice but saw no man the Bible says
[1:19:35] right but they weren't standing with
[1:19:38] Paul it was only Paul that was before
[1:19:42] King
[1:19:45] agria there lays the secret to
[1:19:47] possessing all the truth is humble
[1:19:50] yourself before the Lord Philippians 3:9
[1:19:53] and be found in him not having my own
[1:19:57] righteousness which is of the law but
[1:19:59] that which is which is through the Faith
[1:20:03] of Christ that's God revealing himself
[1:20:06] to you remember Paul said I uh I Live
[1:20:11] Now by the faith of the son of
[1:20:14] man it's not living by our faith but he
[1:20:19] speaks the word to us that's the Faith
[1:20:23] of Christ through the Faith of Christ
[1:20:25] the righteousness which is of god by
[1:20:28] faith that I might know
[1:20:30] him and the power of his resurrection
[1:20:33] and the fellowship of his sufferings
[1:20:34] being made conformable unto his death
[1:20:36] see here's Paul 33 years later after
[1:20:38] that
[1:20:39] experience on the road to Damascus when
[1:20:42] he gave his heart to God he's still
[1:20:44] acting like a
[1:20:47] babe he's still saying oh that I might
[1:20:50] know you Lord I don't know
[1:20:52] you yeah most people I wrote WR 14 books
[1:20:55] of the Bible and I know so much and you
[1:20:57] better listen to me now he didn't have
[1:20:59] that
[1:21:00] Spirit he had the spirit of oh that I
[1:21:03] might know
[1:21:05] him and he goes as far as saying this
[1:21:09] I'm going to know God in the power of
[1:21:11] his
[1:21:12] resurrection then I'm going to have to
[1:21:15] come to know him in the fellowship of
[1:21:19] his sufferings he had to be willing to
[1:21:22] Humble himself to suffer to put him down
[1:21:26] put himself so low that God could be
[1:21:29] exalted in
[1:21:31] him that's the key amen you know people
[1:21:35] want a gospel we could just come and we
[1:21:37] hear the word and that should be good
[1:21:38] enough they don't want to get underneath
[1:21:40] the word amen you got to get underneath
[1:21:43] the
[1:21:44] word Lord pour it in my heart it's the
[1:21:48] secret to knowing Christ die out to self
[1:21:52] if by any means I might attain unto the
[1:21:54] resurrection C of the
[1:21:56] Dead look at the secret to see seeing
[1:21:59] more of God here verse 12 not as though
[1:22:02] I already
[1:22:05] attained he he wasn't a know at all
[1:22:08] either were already
[1:22:11] perfect in other words he wasn't saying
[1:22:13] that he was better than others he says
[1:22:16] but I follow after if I may apprehend
[1:22:19] that which also I'm apprehended of Jesus
[1:22:22] Christ
[1:22:24] Brethren I count not myself to have
[1:22:26] apprehended but this one thing I do I do
[1:22:29] it I do it I live it I don't think it I
[1:22:31] live it forget those things which are
[1:22:36] behind and reach forth unto those things
[1:22:40] which are before I want to become more
[1:22:42] like
[1:22:43] Jesus he said I press towards the mark
[1:22:47] there's a prize of the High Calling God
[1:22:51] is calling us higher than anybody else
[1:22:54] we've been chosen to be his bride not
[1:22:57] servants not foolish virgins but a bride
[1:23:00] amen I'll tell you if there's anything
[1:23:01] that we need to believe of oursel we
[1:23:03] need to believe that we're the
[1:23:05] bride and hold ourselves accountable to
[1:23:07] the message that God sent for his bride
[1:23:10] amen because he didn't send that message
[1:23:12] for the foolish
[1:23:14] virgin he did not send it for the
[1:23:16] foolish virgin is it get us
[1:23:20] ready I press towards the mark for the
[1:23:22] prize of the High Calling of God in
[1:23:24] Christ
[1:23:30] Jesus you see I got notes Here
[1:23:35] Right got lots of notes I'm just trying
[1:23:38] to like forar you this could
[1:23:44] be I'm glad today
[1:23:49] Sunday turn with me if you would to Luke
[1:23:51] chapter 24 just kind of follow along
[1:23:53] with me I'll try to go througho fast
[1:23:55] here's two disciples that were walking
[1:23:58] with
[1:23:58] Jesus Jesus was right next to them the
[1:24:01] reason I want to get into this is I
[1:24:02] think a lot of times we don't recognize
[1:24:04] that Jesus is right here next to us in
[1:24:08] church verse 15 says and it came to pass
[1:24:10] that while they communed together and
[1:24:14] reason Jesus himself Drew near and went
[1:24:18] with them I believe that Jesus is here I
[1:24:22] think I believe that Jesus Jesus is
[1:24:25] happy that we're that we're wanting to
[1:24:29] lift him up and
[1:24:31] wanting he that that words are being
[1:24:34] spoken to his
[1:24:36] bride the secrets to knowing more about
[1:24:41] God like he wants we we hear the
[1:24:43] statement that brother Bri want brother
[1:24:45] bran said that God wants to give us the
[1:24:47] the Holy Ghost more than what we want so
[1:24:50] much that if you put pressure in in a at
[1:24:52] a tube one mile high foreign diameter
[1:24:55] there' be so much pressure at the bottom
[1:24:56] of it that is nothing compared to all
[1:25:00] the pressure that God wants to give us
[1:25:02] the Holy Ghost
[1:25:03] right but do we want it enough so I
[1:25:07] believe that what God is really looking
[1:25:09] for in the response to the word that's
[1:25:11] being ministered today is that he's
[1:25:13] looking for a hunger for to to want to
[1:25:15] know him
[1:25:17] more verse 16 but their eyes were Holden
[1:25:20] that they should not know him notice
[1:25:22] that their eyes were Holden I wonder why
[1:25:26] I wonder why eyes are Holden and he said
[1:25:29] unto them what manner of communications
[1:25:30] are these that one that you have one
[1:25:32] with another as as you walk and are sad
[1:25:35] remember he came to uh God came to um
[1:25:42] um Adam and Eve had two sons Cain and
[1:25:45] Abel so Cain God came to Cain and his
[1:25:49] countenance was sad as
[1:25:51] well and he tried to minister to him why
[1:25:54] you
[1:25:54] sad you you shouldn't be in this
[1:25:56] condition you have a free mow agency you
[1:25:59] have a choice to make you do the right
[1:26:01] thing and you're you're in you do the
[1:26:03] wrong thing sin lies at the door after
[1:26:05] that is death right we all have that
[1:26:08] same
[1:26:10] choice so Jesus was walking with two of
[1:26:13] his disciples and they didn't even know
[1:26:14] Jesus was with them wow what a paradox
[1:26:18] and Copus asked Jesus art thou only a
[1:26:21] stranger in Jerusalem and has not known
[1:26:22] the things which are come to pass in
[1:26:24] these days and he said what things and
[1:26:27] they said unto him concerning Jesus of
[1:26:29] Nazareth which was a prophet Mighty in
[1:26:31] deed and word before God and all the
[1:26:33] people and how the chief priest and the
[1:26:35] rulers delivered him to be condemned to
[1:26:37] death and have crucified him but we
[1:26:39] trusted but we trusted in other words it
[1:26:43] wasn't we
[1:26:44] trust it's I we trusted passed we
[1:26:49] trusted that it had been he which should
[1:26:52] have redeemed Israel and besides all
[1:26:55] this today is the third day since these
[1:26:57] things have done and certain women also
[1:26:59] the company made were uh made us
[1:27:01] astonished uh which were early at the
[1:27:04] septier and when they found not his body
[1:27:07] they came saying they had also seen a
[1:27:11] vision of angels which said unto him
[1:27:14] he's alive and certain of them which
[1:27:16] were with us went to the septier and
[1:27:17] found it was as the women had said but
[1:27:21] him they saw not and after they got done
[1:27:24] explaining all this you would think that
[1:27:26] Jesus would just want to go to them and
[1:27:28] put his arms around them and say come on
[1:27:30] boys hey come on you know kind of
[1:27:32] comfort them console them encourage
[1:27:38] them no he said oh fools he called his
[1:27:41] own disciples fools th this is like
[1:27:46] wow oh fools and slow of heart to
[1:27:51] believe the message of the hour all that
[1:27:53] the prophets
[1:27:54] spoken ought not Christ to have suffered
[1:27:57] these things and to enter his glory of
[1:27:59] course because Jesus had told him how
[1:28:01] many times I'm going to suffer I'm going
[1:28:03] to raise again the third day he already
[1:28:05] told them but they did not believe right
[1:28:08] amen and at the beginning and beginning
[1:28:11] at Moses and all the prophets he has
[1:28:13] founded unto them in all the scriptures
[1:28:15] of the things concerning himself and
[1:28:17] they drew nine to the Village whether
[1:28:19] they went and he made as though he was
[1:28:21] just going to keep on going further but
[1:28:23] the two disciples had constrained him
[1:28:25] saying abide with us for it is towards
[1:28:28] evening and the day is far spent and he
[1:28:30] went and he carried with
[1:28:32] them there was just something inside
[1:28:35] these men that when they heard the word
[1:28:39] it sounded so much like what they heard
[1:28:43] before just the way that Jesus had spoke
[1:28:45] to
[1:28:46] them and it came to pass as he sat at
[1:28:49] meat with them he took bread and he
[1:28:51] blessed it and break it and gave it to
[1:28:53] them and their eyes were
[1:28:55] opened and they knew him and immediately
[1:28:59] he vanished out of their
[1:29:01] sight how important it is for personally
[1:29:05] Jesus to break the word to you
[1:29:09] personally to take this big bread break
[1:29:13] it off and say Gabe this is for you this
[1:29:15] is for you Jonathan this is for
[1:29:19] you Aurora this is for
[1:29:21] you how important is it for you to be
[1:29:25] looking God break a piece of bread off
[1:29:28] for
[1:29:30] me if not we're just sitting as
[1:29:33] bystanders church is going
[1:29:36] on not really recognizing what's
[1:29:38] happening in the spiritual
[1:29:41] realm The Secret of seeing is when God
[1:29:44] breaks the bread of life to you
[1:29:47] personally personally Upon This Rock
[1:29:51] I'll build my church in the gates of
[1:29:53] hell when not Prevail against it we need
[1:29:55] to become so strong that the devil can't
[1:29:57] come against us he can't break our life
[1:29:59] he can't break our home he can't break
[1:30:02] our church he can't break us because
[1:30:04] Christ we're built upon the solid rock
[1:30:06] of Revelation and that isn't going to
[1:30:08] come just because your name is John
[1:30:10] Martin you got to hunger you got to
[1:30:12] thirst you got to get on your knees and
[1:30:14] say God I need more of you in my life
[1:30:19] amen John
[1:30:21] 9:39 Jesus speaking
[1:30:25] he said for judgment I am come into the
[1:30:27] world that they which see not might
[1:30:32] see and they which see might be made
[1:30:39] blind and some of the Pharisees which
[1:30:41] were with him heard these words and said
[1:30:44] unto him are we blind
[1:30:46] also they were
[1:30:48] offended at the
[1:30:51] truth that God had spoke to
[1:30:57] them and they were just
[1:30:59] being
[1:31:03] sarcastic they were being sarcastic they
[1:31:05] didn't think they were
[1:31:07] blind they thought they saw just fine it
[1:31:10] was Jesus that had the
[1:31:12] problem are we blind also and Jesus said
[1:31:15] if you were blind you should have no sin
[1:31:19] but now you say we see Therefore your
[1:31:22] sin remainest
[1:31:25] see it's your
[1:31:26] attitude your attitude is I need more of
[1:31:29] God praise God your eyes are coming open
[1:31:32] you say well I don't you know today I'm
[1:31:33] I'm pretty good you know I'm just going
[1:31:35] to go
[1:31:39] home then your sin remain it that's what
[1:31:42] Jesus is
[1:31:43] saying brother Braham says we never
[1:31:46] leave church the same way can you
[1:31:51] imagine someone getting so far from
[1:31:56] God that they end up stop coming to
[1:32:01] church I mean this happens right
[1:32:05] amen so people end up coming to church
[1:32:08] they leave church further away from God
[1:32:11] but they don't realize it they're
[1:32:13] they're blind to that but eventually
[1:32:16] they say what why do I even go I don't
[1:32:18] get nothing out of
[1:32:20] it where the bride said I can't wait to
[1:32:22] get there
[1:32:24] I can't wait for the word there's
[1:32:26] there's something there's a Jesus is
[1:32:28] truly going to break a piece of bread
[1:32:30] off for
[1:32:34] me this age that we're living in now
[1:32:37] just so you know I started a little bit
[1:32:39] later today because I had to you
[1:32:43] know had to thank everybody I had to
[1:32:47] sing that one song but we're really not
[1:32:49] behind schedule I just want you to know
[1:32:52] that in this age there's a a hideous
[1:32:57] spirit in
[1:33:01] leoa and it's a it's an arrogant
[1:33:04] spirit it's an I don't
[1:33:09] need you got to
[1:33:15] say and Jesus says that
[1:33:18] spirit is identified as being blind they
[1:33:22] don't even know it amen they're
[1:33:26] blind and he tells them what your
[1:33:29] antidote is what the answer is what the
[1:33:31] secret to being able to see is come by
[1:33:35] of me gold which we know is only God God
[1:33:39] is the only gold is the only deity we
[1:33:41] have to buy God now we can't put money
[1:33:43] in the back and buy God we can't do a
[1:33:47] bunch of Works in by
[1:33:48] God but we can give our heart and soul
[1:33:51] to him
[1:33:54] yes right you can give
[1:33:58] yourself let them come in your heart and
[1:34:01] put gold in there amen put gold on the
[1:34:04] outside put gold
[1:34:08] everywhere and he
[1:34:10] says that that the uh oil the anointing
[1:34:16] that comes from me from the deity the
[1:34:19] oil that comes will anoint your eyes
[1:34:24] that you may
[1:34:27] see if we want to see we've got to
[1:34:30] humble oursel and say God I need
[1:34:32] you now remember I'm not we're not in a
[1:34:35] denomination or church that we can
[1:34:37] identify oh yeah they're in
[1:34:39] leoa I think there's a lot of message
[1:34:41] Believers in leod DEA I think there's a
[1:34:44] lot of people that go to message
[1:34:46] churches in leod
[1:34:49] deia they heard a a natural Voice come
[1:34:52] out and they all they heard was the the
[1:34:55] the the the leoan church was some
[1:34:58] denomination but brother Brandon was
[1:35:00] really saying that was the
[1:35:02] spirit you got to come out of the spirit
[1:35:06] amen come out of the spirit of
[1:35:11] lukewarmness be clothed with deity that
[1:35:14] the
[1:35:16] shame of your first nature does not
[1:35:22] appear this shame of your nakedness the
[1:35:25] the the the shame of your worldly nature
[1:35:28] does not appear that needs to be covered
[1:35:31] we need to be that needs to be gone we
[1:35:33] need the nature of
[1:35:36] God God will not accept anything but
[1:35:39] himself we need the character of God
[1:35:41] it's the only thing that we're taking
[1:35:43] with us when we leave do you believe
[1:35:48] that God hides things
[1:35:53] God hasn't even told the Angels when
[1:35:55] he's coming
[1:36:00] right God had
[1:36:03] hid from the
[1:36:05] Devil the deepness of his love to
[1:36:13] Satan he didn't
[1:36:15] know he didn't know he knew the law but
[1:36:18] he didn't know the
[1:36:20] deepness he didn't know the the fullness
[1:36:23] of the law he didn't know the
[1:36:25] deepness think about
[1:36:27] this Lucifer looked at God as being a
[1:36:32] god of love because that's what the word
[1:36:34] identifies him as God is love but the
[1:36:38] thing
[1:36:40] is God was able to hide from Satan
[1:36:46] Calvary he didn't know that when Calvary
[1:36:49] happened that he was going to lose all
[1:36:51] those Souls all his hard work that he
[1:36:54] put
[1:36:54] in he was going because you know Jesus
[1:36:58] is just coming back for his own right
[1:37:00] he's not coming back for anything else
[1:37:07] amen God has the
[1:37:09] ability to hide the Deep
[1:37:13] things but he's revealed them unto
[1:37:16] us and when his love comes into our
[1:37:18] heart and swells
[1:37:21] up that we're able to to to love the way
[1:37:24] that he loved right to lay down our life
[1:37:27] the way that he laid down his life to do
[1:37:30] the end of the of the royal
[1:37:34] law fulfill the scriptures that when
[1:37:37] somebody else can't make it your love
[1:37:40] Picks Them Up and makes it for them
[1:37:44] that's what Christ did for us that's
[1:37:45] what the bride does for everybody else
[1:37:48] amen and that's what he's called us to
[1:37:50] this is the
[1:37:52] secret amen
[1:37:54] of seeing God let's Stand Together God
[1:37:56] bless
[1:37:57] you the secret of seeing God is to fall
