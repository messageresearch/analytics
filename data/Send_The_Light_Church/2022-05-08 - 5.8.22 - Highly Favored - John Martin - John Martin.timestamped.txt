[34:50] amen saint luke chapter 1
[34:54] verse number 26
[34:57] and in the sixth month
[34:59] the angel gabriel
[35:01] was sent from god unto a city of galilee
[35:05] named
[35:05] nazareth
[35:07] to a virgin espoused to a man whose name
[35:10] was joseph of the house of david
[35:13] and
[35:14] the virgin's name was mary
[35:17] and the angel came in onto her and said
[35:20] hail
[35:21] in other words stop
[35:23] thou art highly favored the lord is with
[35:26] thee
[35:27] blessed art thou among women
[35:30] and then
[35:32] she saw him and when she saw him she was
[35:35] troubled at his saying and cast in her
[35:38] mind what manner of salutation this
[35:40] should be
[35:42] and the angel said unto her
[35:44] fear not mary
[35:46] for thou hast
[35:47] found
[35:48] favor with god
[35:50] behold thou has conceived in thy womb
[35:53] and bring
[35:54] forth a son
[35:56] and behold thou shalt conceive in thy
[35:58] womb and bring forth a son and shall
[35:59] call his name jesus and he shall be
[36:02] great and shall be called the son of the
[36:04] highest and the lord god shall give unto
[36:06] him
[36:07] the throne of his father david
[36:10] and he shall reign over the house of
[36:11] jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[36:14] shall be no end
[36:15] then mary said unto the angel
[36:18] how
[36:19] shall this be seen
[36:21] i've not been with a man
[36:24] and the angel answered and said unto her
[36:26] the holy ghost shall come upon thee and
[36:29] the power of the highest shall
[36:31] overshadow thee
[36:33] therefore also that holy thing
[36:35] which shall be borne of thee shall be
[36:38] called the son of god
[36:41] behold thy cousin elizabeth
[36:43] she have also conceived a son in her old
[36:46] age
[36:47] and this is the sixth month with her
[36:50] who was called barren for with god
[36:53] nothing shall be impossible
[36:55] and mary said behold the handmaid of the
[36:58] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[37:02] and the angel departed from her
[37:04] amen god bless you may be seated
[37:08] i want to say it's good to see
[37:10] my brother tyler and sister brooke here
[37:12] in church
[37:19] what a great day it is
[37:23] for our mothers
[37:28] i was thinking today
[37:30] what would be a good mother's day
[37:31] message
[37:33] and
[37:36] what would be a a good example in the
[37:39] bible that we could look to is as far as
[37:41] a mother
[37:44] and i
[37:46] obviously thought of mary the one that
[37:48] god chose
[37:50] and we want to entitle this message
[37:52] highly favored
[37:54] i'd like to honor all the mothers today
[37:58] uh i wonder if everyone could stand up
[38:00] except the mothers
[38:05] and i just want to honor our mothers
[38:10] praise the lord for our mothers
[38:12] [Applause]
[38:13] amen
[38:17] i know it may seem a little backwards
[38:19] but they deserve to have a seat once in
[38:21] a while
[38:23] and you may be seated
[38:25] it's a grand day for our mothers
[38:29] mother's day is celebrated across the
[38:31] world in over 50 countries
[38:35] and brother ron made a little note here
[38:37] about the phone calls
[38:39] more phone calls are made on mother's
[38:41] day than any other day in the world
[38:46] this this holiday
[38:48] the chats with mom often spike up to 37
[38:53] more
[38:56] what our mothers deserve though is more
[38:59] than just one day
[39:04] the lq
[39:06] no the lgbtq
[39:10] get a whole month of june
[39:15] that's what they
[39:17] promote
[39:24] when i looked at my my phone it
[39:26] automatically came up on my calendar
[39:30] and so brother mark was there i said
[39:31] brother mark you could help me get this
[39:33] off my phone i've tried to erase it i
[39:35] can't get it off but it's stuck there
[39:39] in june of 2000 president bill clinton
[39:43] declared june as the official gay month
[39:45] and lesbian lesbian pride month
[39:49] they say the purpose of this month is to
[39:51] recognize the impact that lesbians gays
[39:54] bisexuals transgender individuals have
[39:57] had on history
[39:59] nationally and internationally
[40:03] but for some reason mr clinton
[40:06] allowed the lgbq a whole month of
[40:10] recognition
[40:11] and our mothers
[40:12] only get a day
[40:17] mr clinton
[40:19] who claimed to be born again i heard it
[40:21] myself
[40:22] should have read his bible before he
[40:24] signed off on it
[40:28] because we know god signed off on his
[40:29] word on the subject
[40:31] before the foundation of the world
[40:34] revelations 21 18 19 tells us that we
[40:37] can't add or take away from god's word
[40:39] without judgment
[40:41] jesus himself said in matthew 4 4 man
[40:43] shall not live by bread alone but by
[40:45] every word that proceedeth out of the
[40:47] mouth of god
[40:49] in psalms 119 89 for ever o lord thy
[40:52] word
[40:53] is settled
[40:55] in heaven amen
[40:57] our mothers deserve to be honored and
[40:59] respected every day amen
[41:02] in fact the bible commands us to honor
[41:04] our mothers
[41:07] i want us to realize whether we're
[41:09] children
[41:10] or young adults
[41:12] that when we respect our mothers
[41:15] we're actually adding more years to our
[41:17] life
[41:21] you're going to exist longer
[41:23] that's how important it is to god for us
[41:24] to honor mothers
[41:26] it's the first commandment with promise
[41:30] not just a day to celebrate
[41:34] god has
[41:35] designated or designed our mothers to
[41:38] carry out a very important role in our
[41:40] life
[41:42] brother brandon said in the message
[41:44] mother's day he says i might pass this
[41:45] on to the young people he says do you
[41:47] know that abraham lincoln never owned a
[41:50] book in his life until he was about 21
[41:54] years old
[41:56] of course
[41:58] see that mothers give the kids
[42:01] a telephone when they're about
[42:04] two
[42:09] but the bible
[42:10] in the fox's book of martyrs that was
[42:12] the two books that he
[42:14] got see
[42:18] you uh what you
[42:20] read
[42:21] molds the character that you are
[42:26] no wonder we got a bunch of neurotics
[42:27] today
[42:29] little old fiction magazines vulgarity
[42:32] and nonsense is placed upon the new
[42:34] stands
[42:35] he owned the bible in the fox's book of
[42:37] martyrs and look what it made him
[42:41] but in the face of all that one day he
[42:43] made a statement like this he said if
[42:46] there could be any good thing found in
[42:49] me it's because
[42:51] of a godly mother
[42:54] that reared him to serve the lord
[42:59] you see a child listens to its mother
[43:02] some little touch about that mother
[43:05] that a child will listen to
[43:08] when it's hurt it'll go to its mother
[43:10] for consolation before it will go to its
[43:12] father
[43:16] because she was first with it you know
[43:20] and there's some gift that god gives a
[43:22] mother to be that way
[43:24] i mean a real mother now i believe that
[43:26] mothers are honorable and godly
[43:30] but i believe that such a mother's day
[43:32] like this
[43:33] is a racket made
[43:35] a lot of money out of flowers and things
[43:39] mother's day should be every day
[43:43] not to send her a bunch of flowers on
[43:45] mother's day
[43:46] but to love her
[43:48] and to care for her
[43:51] 365 days and nights
[43:54] through the year
[43:56] but of course the commercial world has a
[43:58] great hold in things like this and it
[44:02] depreciates depreciates
[44:05] mothers
[44:08] so i was thinking
[44:10] this morning
[44:12] what could we
[44:14] go through that we could
[44:15] really
[44:17] find out what god
[44:19] thinks
[44:20] about a mother
[44:23] and looking at
[44:24] mary because god had chosen mary to
[44:26] carry out a very important role in her
[44:29] life and i want to dive into some things
[44:32] that we haven't really looked at about
[44:35] mary
[44:37] for a mother's day theme here
[44:40] mary was chosen of god
[44:42] now we don't want to make something out
[44:44] of mary that she wasn't
[44:47] some churches uh
[44:49] make her the mother of god
[44:52] but she was not the mother of god i was
[44:54] raised catholic
[44:56] their catechism teaches that mary is
[44:59] truly mother of god since
[45:03] she is the mother of the eternal son of
[45:05] god
[45:07] who was made man and who is god himself
[45:11] see how ridiculous this is
[45:15] putting mary before
[45:18] mary was not the mother of god
[45:20] we don't want to make her something that
[45:22] she's not
[45:24] she did mother god almighty
[45:27] she was chosen of god for an important
[45:30] role
[45:31] we all know that god used her vessel to
[45:34] conceive a seed and to bring forth a
[45:37] perfect human being that he could become
[45:40] the sacrifice for our sins
[45:43] isaiah 7 14 says therefore the lord
[45:45] himself shall give you a sign behold a
[45:47] virgin shall conceive and bear a son and
[45:50] shall call his name emmanuel
[45:52] but in our reading this morning
[45:55] the angel said you should call his name
[45:58] jesus so jesus
[46:01] is emmanuel
[46:03] which is god with us
[46:06] and this son
[46:08] was not the son of joseph and mary
[46:11] the angel said this was the son of the
[46:13] highest
[46:17] there were many
[46:19] virgins
[46:22] at that time
[46:24] why
[46:25] choose this
[46:26] virgin was it because her name was mary
[46:29] from what i understand in that century
[46:31] so many people were called mary in fact
[46:32] there were three marys at the cross
[46:37] mary was a very common name
[46:40] why not even choose another virgin
[46:42] called mary so why was it this mary
[46:45] the bible says that this mary had found
[46:47] favor with god
[46:49] not just a little bit of favor now
[46:51] but she was highly favored of the lord
[46:55] she was blessed among women the bible
[46:58] says
[46:59] now she may have not have felt it but
[47:01] the bible says the lord was with her
[47:06] mary was chosen to carry out a very
[47:08] special role god chose her body to
[47:11] develop a temple that would be a place
[47:14] where the fullness of god's measure
[47:17] could dwell in there
[47:19] he became the tabernacle which would
[47:22] manifest the very existence of the
[47:24] invisible god
[47:26] and this temple one day would be offered
[47:28] as a perfect sacrifice for our sins
[47:32] so it was an important job
[47:35] but that wasn't her only job and that's
[47:38] what kind of one i want to dive into
[47:39] when we think about mary and her role
[47:41] and
[47:42] you know she was just uh a virgin that
[47:44] god had used
[47:47] to bring forth his son but it was much
[47:48] more than that mothers i said it was
[47:50] much more than that fathers and brothers
[47:52] and sisters
[47:57] it wasn't just because she was a virgin
[47:59] or that her name was mary she was highly
[48:01] favored but god used mary to bring this
[48:05] vessel up
[48:07] in the fear of the lord
[48:09] there was a a role to play after the
[48:11] birth
[48:12] to nurture in the admonition of the lord
[48:16] in the message mary's belief brethren
[48:19] said hail mary or stop you're highly
[48:23] favored before god oh i like that
[48:26] that little woman in the meanest
[48:29] city there was in the world at that time
[48:33] known the meanest city anyhow in
[48:35] palestine
[48:36] and in there
[48:39] she had lived such a life
[48:42] until god chose her
[48:45] wow
[48:47] chose her for a certain work that he was
[48:50] going to do
[48:52] now the key here is that she lived such
[48:56] a life
[48:59] one of the reasons that she was chosen
[49:01] because she lives such a life before the
[49:04] lord
[49:06] i'll say
[49:07] us don't underestimate the importance of
[49:09] living the life
[49:11] before god uses you for something before
[49:13] god chooses you to do something
[49:16] it's the little things what we heard
[49:18] from brother josiah it's the little
[49:20] foxes that smell the vine but the
[49:22] prophet has preached that i'll say it's
[49:24] the little things that we do for god
[49:25] that really makes a difference
[49:29] just do the very best that you can do
[49:30] every day
[49:34] i believe that there are many things
[49:36] that god would choose us for if we could
[49:38] just as brother and said live
[49:41] such a life
[49:43] to live such a life
[49:45] you know we we come to church we hear
[49:47] the things that we hear hoping to hear
[49:49] maybe something different something to
[49:50] encourage us something to help us
[49:52] understand we're looking for all good
[49:54] things when we come to church
[49:56] and then we leave here
[49:59] and we don't put enough time
[50:01] in implementing the things
[50:03] that we hear from god
[50:05] because it's those things
[50:07] that bring us into a closer fellowship
[50:10] with god
[50:14] we need to just
[50:15] live closer to god in our heart brother
[50:17] branham or not brother brand but the
[50:19] bible says ephesians 4 1
[50:22] that we need to walk worthy of the
[50:24] invitation we're with we're called
[50:27] i believe this is where mary was walking
[50:30] with all loneliness and meekness and
[50:32] long suffering for bearing one another
[50:34] love for endeavoring to keep the unity
[50:36] of the spirit in the bond of peace
[50:39] i believe mary walked this kind of walk
[50:42] it wasn't just all talk with her
[50:45] it was the life that she lived
[50:49] god chose her
[50:52] so
[50:53] you know
[50:54] god is not going to bring forth
[50:57] another natural man
[51:02] but he is going to bring forth a bride
[51:06] and that bride is a type of mary
[51:09] she will have to do the same thing mary
[51:11] did walk worthy
[51:14] to walk humbly
[51:18] to have the same mind that christ has
[51:22] we could say that mary fulfilled
[51:24] colossians 1 10 that she walked worthy
[51:26] of the lord unto all pleasing
[51:29] being fruitful in every good work
[51:32] and increasing in the knowledge of god i
[51:34] just wonder how many times we actually
[51:37] took time to think about what kind of
[51:39] life did mary live after jesus was born
[51:45] i believe she lived humbly
[51:48] she lived a humble life every day
[51:51] she practiced it
[51:53] her thoughts were humble her actions
[51:54] were humble
[51:56] the bible says that god resists the
[51:58] proud but he giveth grace
[52:00] uh to the humble and she found favor
[52:02] with god
[52:04] the bible also says a humble and
[52:06] contrite spirit are not despised and i
[52:08] dwell with them that are humble
[52:11] so i believe that mary this mother
[52:15] was a humble lady
[52:20] god knew mary was going to act like she
[52:24] was something special
[52:26] more special than the others
[52:28] even though the angel told her that i
[52:30] don't believe she went around saying
[52:32] that
[52:35] like everybody should esteem her look at
[52:37] me
[52:40] god knew mary wasn't going to be lifted
[52:42] up in pride just because she was chosen
[52:46] god also knew that mary wasn't going to
[52:49] stop or even slow down
[52:52] after
[52:53] the baby was born
[52:57] you know too many christians after they
[53:01] start the race
[53:04] get baptized
[53:06] get borned again
[53:08] for some reason they slow down
[53:13] got the promise that wasn't mary
[53:19] yes god used her to bring forth the son
[53:22] but when that baby jesus was placed in
[53:25] her hand she was found faithful to raise
[53:27] him the right way
[53:31] that's what really sticks out to me
[53:32] about mary
[53:35] it was there was a lot of virgins
[53:37] brother branham said out there
[53:39] could have chose any of them and still
[53:40] brought forth isaiah 7 14.
[53:44] but there was something more to it than
[53:46] that
[53:48] praise the lord
[53:51] god had confidence in mary
[53:53] that she would continue to grow
[53:56] in the love of god even after the birth
[53:59] deuteronomy 6 5 and thou shalt love the
[54:02] lord thy god with all thy heart with all
[54:04] they soul with all they might i believe
[54:05] that that god had confidence in mary
[54:08] that she would fulfill this
[54:10] and that these words which i command
[54:12] thee this day shall be in thy heart and
[54:14] thou shalt teach them diligently unto
[54:17] thy children and thou shalt talk of them
[54:20] when thou sittest in thine house
[54:22] and when they'll walk us by the way and
[54:24] when they'll lay us down when thou rise
[54:26] us up and not just when they're being
[54:28] bad
[54:29] but when they're being good and when
[54:31] they're all the time talk to them about
[54:33] the love of god amen
[54:36] and thou shalt bind them for a sign upon
[54:39] thy hand
[54:41] and they shall be in the frontless
[54:42] between thy and eyes and thou shall
[54:43] write them upon the pulse of the house
[54:45] and on thy gates tonight obviously we we
[54:47] know that brother branham brother
[54:49] branham said that god chose her because
[54:51] the life that she was living
[54:55] and we know that if we're jesus said if
[54:58] you're faithful and little you'll be
[55:00] faithful and much
[55:02] and she was faithful
[55:04] to what god had given her
[55:07] she didn't even battle
[55:09] this well my human understanding doesn't
[55:11] understand how i can have a baby this
[55:13] just hasn't happened
[55:15] well the angel the lord said well
[55:18] elizabeth didn't she have a baby in her
[55:20] old age trying to increase her faith
[55:22] but you notice she didn't say yeah angel
[55:25] but at least she had a husband and she
[55:27] knew him they had something to try but i
[55:29] haven't had a husband she didn't go down
[55:31] that path she didn't lead her own
[55:33] understanding
[55:34] she trusted in god she believed the word
[55:39] she was faithful with what she had
[55:42] and i believe that she carried out this
[55:45] same belief in what the word said
[55:50] god knew mary would be serious
[55:53] with always teaching the love of god now
[55:56] you got to remember
[55:58] it wasn't like well jesus you know he's
[56:00] a perfect little three-year-old or
[56:02] four-year-old or six-year-old
[56:05] me mary i'm gonna just deal with james
[56:07] and and and
[56:09] the other brothers and sisters of jesus
[56:12] no it was a whole house
[56:14] i believe she she taught the same thing
[56:17] the whole way to all of them
[56:23] we can never teach enough nor
[56:25] demonstrate enough
[56:27] the love of god to our children
[56:30] but we can often come short of it
[56:34] mary was faithful to attend church
[56:36] services with jesus every time the doors
[56:40] were open
[56:42] amen the bible says the lord was with
[56:45] her and mary went to church with jesus
[56:53] i'll tell you
[56:54] that's the kind of mother i want to be
[56:57] brother john that's a little silly
[56:59] you're a man
[57:04] but we men we brothers we sisters still
[57:09] are mothering somebody
[57:13] i believe mary taught jesus as a little
[57:15] boy to act respectful
[57:20] now what does that mean brother john
[57:22] respectful
[57:23] hope you don't spend much time on that
[57:27] what does that really mean it means a
[57:28] whole lot
[57:31] it means not to curse
[57:34] not to use profanity
[57:36] or inappropriate language
[57:40] not to be rude
[57:42] or crude
[57:43] or vulgar
[57:46] not to push or shove
[57:48] not to scream yell
[57:50] fight argue
[57:53] not to steal
[57:54] take things
[57:56] not to throw rocks at others or talk
[57:58] behind people's backs
[58:01] not to take that eye for an eye or two
[58:03] for a tooth
[58:06] not to be selfish or stingy
[58:09] i believe
[58:11] mary spent a lot of time
[58:13] teaching
[58:15] how to respect
[58:17] the bible tells us that jesus learned
[58:20] obedience by the things that he suffered
[58:22] i believe that mary spent a lot of time
[58:24] teaching
[58:27] just because
[58:29] god has brought forth
[58:31] his word and and and and you believe
[58:34] that the child that you have
[58:36] is
[58:37] uh as as as a
[58:40] a god-promised child
[58:42] it doesn't mean that they're so special
[58:44] you don't got to do anything
[58:46] you spare the rod you spoil the child
[58:51] there's some teaching that needs to be
[58:53] done
[58:56] mary helped
[58:58] jesus
[58:59] in every way i like that's how i like
[59:00] the look of it was a help
[59:04] it wasn't being some
[59:07] a help
[59:09] you really really want to help somebody
[59:11] you got to get under them even your
[59:12] children
[59:14] feel for them amen
[59:16] mary lived such a life till god chose
[59:19] her
[59:20] god could trust mary to live out this
[59:23] life as an example for the boy
[59:26] as well to teach i believe that mary
[59:30] didn't have bad language i believe mary
[59:33] was respectful
[59:37] i i don't believe that mary took out her
[59:40] frustrations on jesus
[59:42] every time things got out of control i
[59:46] don't believe she flew off the handle
[59:50] started dragging him out of the house by
[59:52] the collar
[59:54] slapping on the side of the head
[59:56] i'm sorry
[59:57] that was not mary
[1:00:02] that's not the way that you bring your
[1:00:03] children up in the fear of the lord
[1:00:05] i believe in correction but i believe in
[1:00:08] godly correction
[1:00:13] i believe as a mother mary often looked
[1:00:16] to god in prayer
[1:00:18] can you say amen
[1:00:20] seeking wisdom from above how to raise
[1:00:22] them amen
[1:00:24] she didn't want to do the wrong thing
[1:00:26] she didn't want to pull that trump card
[1:00:28] well i'm your mother i'm your father i'm
[1:00:30] your parent
[1:00:32] you listen to me god chose me you better
[1:00:34] listen to me
[1:00:37] i'm the holy ghost to you do you get it
[1:00:42] a lot of times we act like that
[1:00:45] that's not the spirit of god
[1:00:47] he may be speaking true words but it's
[1:00:49] not the spirit of god
[1:00:50] [Music]
[1:00:54] i believe mary prayed with jesus
[1:00:58] faithfully
[1:01:00] she was highly favored for reasons that
[1:01:02] we don't think much about
[1:01:04] i just think she was a a virgin she was
[1:01:06] chosen by god and and that was it to the
[1:01:09] story
[1:01:10] but there was so much more to the story
[1:01:13] and if we dive into the story
[1:01:16] i believe it'll help us don't you
[1:01:19] and by the way this message is not just
[1:01:21] for the mothers and you'll see that this
[1:01:23] is just as much for the fathers and for
[1:01:25] the brothers and to them that will be
[1:01:29] as the mothers
[1:01:30] it's for all of us
[1:01:32] if it wasn't then i would just have the
[1:01:35] have the brothers stay home and
[1:01:37] kids stay home and just the mothers come
[1:01:42] i believe there are many reasons
[1:01:46] that god
[1:01:48] chose her
[1:01:53] i wonder how many women through the time
[1:01:54] through ages have
[1:01:56] have wished
[1:01:57] oh i wish i could have been married
[1:02:00] i wish i
[1:02:02] could have been the one
[1:02:04] i think there i think there's been a lot
[1:02:06] i think there's been a fair share what
[1:02:08] it would be like to bend mary
[1:02:11] to be chosen by god to bring forth a son
[1:02:14] that was
[1:02:16] without sin
[1:02:20] i wonder if they would i would just
[1:02:22] raise them right i would just i would
[1:02:24] just be the best
[1:02:28] come on you know that's the way we think
[1:02:32] like i would try harder with him than i
[1:02:34] would my own children
[1:02:38] see how corrupt our thinking is
[1:02:45] i got to believe that my children are of
[1:02:47] the lord
[1:02:51] i mean he he chose them out of one
[1:02:53] million of them he could have brought
[1:02:54] forth another one
[1:02:56] he brought forth the right ones
[1:02:58] do you believe that
[1:03:00] i believe it you got to believe your
[1:03:03] whole house is going to be saved amen
[1:03:06] never underestimate the importance
[1:03:09] of being faithful with what god has
[1:03:11] given you
[1:03:14] and god will give you more if you're
[1:03:16] faithful for what you have
[1:03:20] as a christian mother
[1:03:22] the greatest thing that we can do for
[1:03:24] our children is honestly to love god
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:29] as a mother the greatest thing that we
[1:03:31] can do for our children is ourself love
[1:03:33] god
[1:03:35] because if you truly truly love god
[1:03:39] with all your heart with all your might
[1:03:41] with all your soul
[1:03:43] god's going to be so much in you the
[1:03:45] love of god is going to be pouring out
[1:03:46] so much in you that you will want to
[1:03:49] teach that same love to your children
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:53] amen
[1:03:54] but to be
[1:03:56] distant from that love relationship with
[1:04:00] god and to try to teach your children
[1:04:02] right is worldly
[1:04:10] because the whole world is trying to
[1:04:12] teach their children
[1:04:15] but they're trying to do it without the
[1:04:17] love of god
[1:04:20] so
[1:04:21] for us who want to be
[1:04:23] like mary
[1:04:25] it's so simple
[1:04:28] just fall in love with jesus
[1:04:32] well brother john i'm already 61 years
[1:04:35] old i can't do it
[1:04:38] you're not too old to love god more
[1:04:43] no matter how much you love them
[1:04:45] you can love them more
[1:04:48] and the more you love them the more your
[1:04:50] kids will see jesus is important
[1:04:53] jesus is really important they don't
[1:04:56] talk about them at school they don't
[1:04:57] talk about them in the neighborhood they
[1:04:59] don't talk about them in the restaurant
[1:05:00] they don't talk about them at my
[1:05:01] friend's house but my mother
[1:05:05] right there in the front lips the front
[1:05:07] lips
[1:05:09] all over her life i see the love of god
[1:05:12] and everything she says everything she
[1:05:14] considers god
[1:05:18] it isn't just church
[1:05:23] it isn't just sending your kids to
[1:05:24] school on a bus
[1:05:28] it's bringing jesus in the home
[1:05:30] and no matter how much jesus is in your
[1:05:33] home i'm not discrediting any of it but
[1:05:35] i know this of a surety god could be
[1:05:38] more in my bedroom amen god could be
[1:05:40] more in my home
[1:05:42] god could be more in my car god could be
[1:05:44] more my thoughts
[1:05:48] it's always the right time
[1:05:51] to teach your children to love jesus
[1:05:54] more amen and more
[1:05:57] and more
[1:05:58] get to a place
[1:06:01] where they're
[1:06:02] more
[1:06:03] is there more yes i got your attention
[1:06:06] there's more of the love of god
[1:06:11] john what if they think i'm a fanatic
[1:06:13] that's look it either way they're going
[1:06:15] to think something of you
[1:06:18] i mean with seven kids there were a lot
[1:06:21] of things that i could
[1:06:23] get him involved with
[1:06:26] and i knew that i only had a short space
[1:06:28] of time with him
[1:06:31] yeah i let some
[1:06:33] play instruments uh or
[1:06:35] lessons and and and and sports and and
[1:06:39] different clubs and things
[1:06:41] but i wasn't going to run around 24 7
[1:06:43] going to this thing this thing taking
[1:06:44] them here and there i had to make a
[1:06:46] decision god first we're going to church
[1:06:48] every day we're going to be faithful
[1:06:49] we're going to have bible studies at
[1:06:51] night i myself went all my life without
[1:06:54] joining some sort of
[1:06:56] baseball or something from myself
[1:07:00] i gave up my life for my kids
[1:07:03] i really did
[1:07:07] don't regret one thing
[1:07:09] outside of wishing i could have did a
[1:07:10] better job
[1:07:13] it's always there
[1:07:17] you only got one one life and it's so
[1:07:20] short
[1:07:24] the more that you you help them
[1:07:27] remind them
[1:07:28] about the love of god
[1:07:30] the more it will become the theme in
[1:07:32] their life
[1:07:33] the bible says does a man think it's so
[1:07:35] busy
[1:07:39] you are what you think or you are or you
[1:07:42] will become what you think
[1:07:45] so we need to watch our thoughts
[1:07:50] look at the men today they're thinking
[1:07:52] about being a woman
[1:07:55] look at the women they're thinking about
[1:07:57] being a man
[1:07:59] watch your thoughts
[1:08:01] the bible says we're transformed by the
[1:08:03] renewing of our mind
[1:08:05] that's good or bad that you know bad
[1:08:07] stuff can happen if you put bad stuff in
[1:08:09] your mind
[1:08:11] we want to put the love of god in our
[1:08:13] mind it will affect our little ones it
[1:08:15] will affect those around us the more we
[1:08:17] think about the love of god the more
[1:08:19] people will feel it around us
[1:08:25] when mary finished hearing the angel's
[1:08:28] message she understood her role
[1:08:34] this is very important
[1:08:36] she did not
[1:08:37] comprehend or understand
[1:08:40] how that baby was going to happen inside
[1:08:43] her
[1:08:44] because it had never been done before
[1:08:45] never been taught by her pastor in the
[1:08:47] church
[1:08:50] but she understood her role and this is
[1:08:52] what's important
[1:08:57] when she finished listening to all the
[1:08:59] message
[1:09:00] she understood a role and i'll tell you
[1:09:02] when we
[1:09:04] listen to all the message that god has
[1:09:06] sent in this hour we're gonna understand
[1:09:08] our role
[1:09:10] too many people are sitting there
[1:09:12] talking about things
[1:09:14] talking about what god meant here and i
[1:09:16] wonder this and i wonder that and
[1:09:18] they're missing the simplicity of just
[1:09:20] believing what the angel said
[1:09:27] it wasn't mary's responsibility to bring
[1:09:30] forth the son
[1:09:32] that was the responsibility of the holy
[1:09:34] ghost
[1:09:35] come on amen
[1:09:37] it was it was mary's responsibility to
[1:09:40] believe god first
[1:09:44] and then when jesus was placed
[1:09:46] she
[1:09:47] the baby was born and that baby was
[1:09:50] placed in mary's hands
[1:09:52] then
[1:09:53] her role was to carry out being the very
[1:09:57] best
[1:09:58] mother in the natural that she could for
[1:10:01] that little boy
[1:10:03] she understood her role we've got to
[1:10:06] understand our role as parents us
[1:10:09] grandparents
[1:10:11] us young people we got to understand our
[1:10:13] role and not try to uh
[1:10:16] understand what god's doing just do what
[1:10:18] he said
[1:10:19] just do what he said
[1:10:27] we've got to believe jesus will manifest
[1:10:32] in our
[1:10:33] his nature inside of us
[1:10:35] because that's what the word says
[1:10:38] it's
[1:10:39] not our job to supernaturally do
[1:10:42] it it's our job to believe in the
[1:10:45] supernatural and he will do it
[1:10:49] all we got to do is when jesus the word
[1:10:53] is placed into your hands like jesus was
[1:10:56] placed into mary's hand to follow
[1:10:59] through with what the word says
[1:11:04] that was special about mary
[1:11:07] she always believed jesus
[1:11:13] one of the greatest things that stand
[1:11:15] out to me about mary
[1:11:16] was her belief
[1:11:18] in the message of the hour
[1:11:21] she abandoned all unbelief all human
[1:11:24] reasoning all of her understanding all
[1:11:26] of her intellect
[1:11:28] mary asked one question how shall this
[1:11:31] be
[1:11:33] and when she was told the holy ghost is
[1:11:35] going to handle it
[1:11:38] oh the holy ghost is going to handle it
[1:11:41] yes
[1:11:42] she said i'm a believer of the lord
[1:11:45] be it unto me according to thy word
[1:11:48] that's it
[1:11:49] why figure it out why figure it out oh
[1:11:52] when's he coming oh it's going to be in
[1:11:53] 77 it's going to be in 84 it's going to
[1:11:55] be in 2000 it's going to be don't figure
[1:11:57] it out just
[1:11:59] live this word focus on being faithful
[1:12:01] to the word that the fivefold ministry
[1:12:04] has given us
[1:12:05] be faithful to
[1:12:06] it he'll do the supernatural
[1:12:15] i didn't
[1:12:17] choose mary to do some
[1:12:19] super duper things
[1:12:23] was it like everybody came over mary's
[1:12:25] house to watch her do these super duper
[1:12:27] things
[1:12:29] she was just faithful to the word
[1:12:32] we've got to be like mary amen
[1:12:35] she's the type of the bride in this age
[1:12:38] we must abandon
[1:12:40] our unbelief
[1:12:42] and look no matter what you abandoned
[1:12:44] yesterday the devil's creeping in the
[1:12:46] next day we gotta abandon it every day
[1:12:50] abandon our intellect when the the enemy
[1:12:52] comes and he's trying to get us to
[1:12:55] reason certain things we gotta abandon
[1:12:57] that thing
[1:13:01] we gotta
[1:13:02] learn to lean to the word of god amen
[1:13:09] be sensitive to what the holy spirit
[1:13:12] is saying
[1:13:14] we must receive the message
[1:13:18] of the hour
[1:13:19] the message that was given
[1:13:21] to us by the seventh age messenger
[1:13:25] as an angel
[1:13:27] as a messenger angel
[1:13:31] well it wasn't really as important
[1:13:33] but
[1:13:35] it's just as important
[1:13:37] because it's part of the word it's part
[1:13:39] of god
[1:13:41] don't be taking part out and say that's
[1:13:42] not as important as that
[1:13:44] part we're gonna miss
[1:13:47] the very thing
[1:13:48] that'll help us manifest christ
[1:13:51] we're hurting ourselves
[1:13:53] i believe that the holy ghost is
[1:13:56] overshadowing us
[1:13:59] i believe it
[1:14:01] i believe the holy ghost is actually
[1:14:04] quickening the word to our nature
[1:14:07] and things are changing in our lives
[1:14:10] it isn't just
[1:14:12] certain desires he's taken away
[1:14:15] and that's wonderful
[1:14:17] certain deliverances and certain desires
[1:14:20] but we're looking for a full
[1:14:22] manifestation here
[1:14:24] the whole earth is waiting groaning
[1:14:26] waiting for the manifestations of the
[1:14:28] sons of god
[1:14:29] where
[1:14:30] it's coming right before us it's not far
[1:14:34] down the road we're all talking about
[1:14:36] how corrupt this world is getting you
[1:14:38] can't hardly go one day without having a
[1:14:41] conversation about how bad this world is
[1:14:44] come on
[1:14:46] but how many days do we go not thinking
[1:14:48] about i should be manifesting more of
[1:14:50] christ
[1:14:52] us the bride should be focused on the
[1:14:54] word amen
[1:14:58] i like our brother
[1:15:01] um
[1:15:02] josiah said we need to lie in the
[1:15:04] presence of the son reading that quote
[1:15:08] how do we do that how do we get in his
[1:15:09] presence brother john
[1:15:14] well how about pray more
[1:15:17] how about when you're in prayer
[1:15:18] literally say god i need you
[1:15:22] the bible says draw a night of god he'll
[1:15:24] draw an eye to you
[1:15:26] how about praise him he inhabits the
[1:15:27] praises of his saying praise him more
[1:15:30] brother john are you trying to say i i'm
[1:15:32] not doing enough
[1:15:34] i'm just saying this is the way to get
[1:15:35] into the presence of the son
[1:15:37] that's what i'm saying you want to ripen
[1:15:39] more you want to be more like jesus
[1:15:41] just follow the simple word
[1:15:44] we got to die out to our flesh and jesus
[1:15:47] made it real clear it's got to be daily
[1:15:52] i believe god sent
[1:15:53] a an angel
[1:15:55] a messenger a message to us
[1:15:59] to an angel but i say it like this it's
[1:16:02] directly from god
[1:16:06] it didn't go
[1:16:07] through
[1:16:08] uh
[1:16:10] a channel
[1:16:12] that
[1:16:14] um
[1:16:15] misinterpreted the word
[1:16:19] in fact
[1:16:20] it went to a vessel that was a proper
[1:16:24] interpreter of the word
[1:16:27] a divine
[1:16:29] interpretation of the word without
[1:16:31] brother brandon we wouldn't even
[1:16:33] understand
[1:16:34] amen amen i was baptized father son of
[1:16:37] god probably still be there
[1:16:41] and the catholic church is the first
[1:16:43] church i believe in it without the
[1:16:44] prophet where would we be today
[1:16:48] he opened the word to us so we can
[1:16:51] understand it
[1:16:54] that god is still alive today
[1:16:58] we don't have to just believe that one
[1:17:00] day we're going to kind of all figure it
[1:17:02] out when we get on the other side
[1:17:04] no we can know god today we can have
[1:17:05] personal experience we can feel the
[1:17:07] presence of god today we can we know how
[1:17:09] to go in and come out we know how to go
[1:17:12] before the lord
[1:17:13] we know what kind of spirit to have what
[1:17:15] kind of attitude to have when we
[1:17:17] approach him
[1:17:18] we know what he'll accept what he won't
[1:17:20] accept we know the importance of
[1:17:22] faithfulness to god
[1:17:24] the bible said he's faithful i believe
[1:17:26] he wants us to be faithful
[1:17:28] brother branham said in the message
[1:17:30] questions and answers number two he says
[1:17:32] if you believe me
[1:17:35] to be what you say
[1:17:38] god's servant
[1:17:39] a prophet
[1:17:41] he says listen to what i'm telling you
[1:17:44] see
[1:17:46] says you not might not be able to
[1:17:48] understand it mary
[1:17:51] and if you can't
[1:17:52] then
[1:17:53] you just do what i tell you to do
[1:17:58] wow
[1:17:59] and do you think
[1:18:01] that i am going to take a second in my
[1:18:04] life and consider that the way that i
[1:18:07] understand it is so different than his
[1:18:15] if you do not have a revelation of who
[1:18:17] god's prophet is
[1:18:19] you will stumble through life
[1:18:23] you will end up coming into situations
[1:18:27] and the devil knows
[1:18:29] how to get you to question
[1:18:34] but did you know the bible if you read
[1:18:36] the bible real thoroughly
[1:18:38] you could read things in there that
[1:18:40] are contradictory that sound
[1:18:41] contradictory too
[1:18:43] it isn't just in the message
[1:18:49] he
[1:18:50] god has laid it out there to where
[1:18:51] either we're going to believe it or we
[1:18:53] don't
[1:18:55] but he made it real clear
[1:18:57] you might not better understand it and
[1:18:58] if you can't then just do what i tell
[1:19:00] you to do god will hold me responsible
[1:19:02] for what i say
[1:19:03] he said see
[1:19:05] you listen real close and remember that
[1:19:08] those things
[1:19:10] are spirit.
[1:19:14] where would i be that's that's why i'm
[1:19:16] so grateful for for the lord for this
[1:19:18] message
[1:19:20] don't lean to your own understanding
[1:19:23] god has sent an angel messenger in our
[1:19:25] age just like to mary
[1:19:28] and we must do what god has spoken
[1:19:31] through the prophet
[1:19:32] amen don't just depend on
[1:19:35] what you hear come across this pulpit
[1:19:37] what i am telling you to do is go home
[1:19:40] and put a tape on
[1:19:44] read it listen to it
[1:19:46] well brother john i don't got much time
[1:19:48] well i'll tell you the only reason that
[1:19:50] god sent a prophet in this age was to
[1:19:52] make sure a bride would be ready
[1:19:55] and if we ain't got time to get ready
[1:19:57] what are we saying
[1:20:03] the word that was sent through
[1:20:06] his message
[1:20:08] was what we need to get ready
[1:20:11] i'm talking to the mothers here
[1:20:13] i'm not talking to the females
[1:20:17] i'm talking to the bride of christ
[1:20:21] god has sent us a perfect message
[1:20:26] don't depend on coming hearing at all
[1:20:28] when you come to church
[1:20:30] don't do that it's not good enough
[1:20:35] and it's not good enough to to to to
[1:20:38] just read your bible once a week or look
[1:20:40] at the daily bread
[1:20:42] i'm grateful for the prophet the prophet
[1:20:43] said we need to read our bible and pray
[1:20:45] every day
[1:20:46] he's the one that's leading us to christ
[1:20:50] you read i tell you i can't listen to a
[1:20:52] tape without being provoked to love god
[1:20:55] more to live more true to god
[1:20:57] i can't listen to without being
[1:20:59] convicted in my heart and know that this
[1:21:02] this word is christ speaking to me not a
[1:21:05] man
[1:21:06] with some great ministry
[1:21:13] we need to have a heart like mary
[1:21:15] when we hear the word
[1:21:17] be it unto me lord
[1:21:19] according to thy word
[1:21:21] it was mary's faith in god
[1:21:25] that was so pleasing to god
[1:21:27] the bible tells us that without faith
[1:21:30] we can't please them and i don't believe
[1:21:32] she was highly favored right
[1:21:35] she had to have faith it's what really
[1:21:38] brought the attention
[1:21:41] that that
[1:21:42] please god
[1:21:46] he knew
[1:21:47] that she wasn't going to sit there and
[1:21:48] argue with the morning's message from
[1:21:50] the angel
[1:21:53] wouldn't go home you know just trying to
[1:21:55] talk about no this was an important
[1:21:57] issue be it unto me i want everything
[1:22:00] that you're saying i agree with the word
[1:22:03] me and the word are one
[1:22:08] and please god we got to believe every
[1:22:11] word of god that's spoken to us
[1:22:13] every word
[1:22:16] well brother john
[1:22:18] it's never happened to me before in my
[1:22:19] life it didn't either to mary
[1:22:22] but she was faithful
[1:22:24] to what god had given her all along
[1:22:28] she just didn't live any old kind of
[1:22:29] life she wanted to and then when it was
[1:22:32] time for god to use her okay she's going
[1:22:34] to get real serious with god
[1:22:37] no she was just she was faithful to keep
[1:22:39] the house clean
[1:22:42] faithful and everything
[1:22:44] in this message mary's belief brother
[1:22:46] bran said she threw her little hands up
[1:22:49] and tears running out of those beautiful
[1:22:51] eyes said behold the handmaid of the
[1:22:53] lord be it unto me according to thy word
[1:22:56] she didn't wait
[1:22:58] till she was positive of this
[1:23:01] she didn't wait till she felt life
[1:23:05] or some kind of sensation
[1:23:07] to prove
[1:23:09] that she was to be a mother
[1:23:12] she took his word and that was enough
[1:23:15] and that's what god wants us to do today
[1:23:18] amen
[1:23:19] not wait till we feel better
[1:23:21] not wait till you can move your your
[1:23:24] hand better or or walk a good step
[1:23:28] not wait till the doctor says you're
[1:23:29] improving
[1:23:31] but take god at his word and begin to
[1:23:33] believe it
[1:23:35] that's the only way to please him
[1:23:37] is take his word
[1:23:40] that's the way miracles are performed
[1:23:44] when god took
[1:23:45] when god is took by his word the
[1:23:49] impossibilities or the impossibles are
[1:23:52] made real
[1:23:53] and when god is took at his word not
[1:23:56] question
[1:23:57] just get it from your mind don't
[1:23:59] question it even in your mind you know a
[1:24:01] lot of times we as we know this when we
[1:24:04] go up to somebody a lot of times
[1:24:07] we have the ability
[1:24:09] to have a storefront presence
[1:24:12] while other things are happening up here
[1:24:16] and what brother branham is saying get
[1:24:18] all the doubts out of your mind
[1:24:21] just be one with the word what you see
[1:24:23] is what there is what i'm thinking
[1:24:25] you're hearing it's coming out of my
[1:24:26] mouth
[1:24:32] behold the hand me of the lord
[1:24:34] why she was so happy about it she just
[1:24:37] couldn't stand still and nothing had
[1:24:39] shown up yet but she knew it was going
[1:24:41] to be because god said so
[1:24:45] that's why you can stand up praise the
[1:24:47] lord and know that you're in god's
[1:24:50] presence when you don't feel it
[1:24:54] that god is going to perform his word
[1:24:56] because
[1:24:57] not that you heard an audible voice
[1:25:00] but because god's word said it and you
[1:25:02] chose to believe it
[1:25:04] because god's word isn't dead just
[1:25:06] because you haven't heard it audible
[1:25:08] today it's alive today you don't need to
[1:25:10] keep speaking the whole word audible
[1:25:12] it's already been spoken it's forever
[1:25:15] settled he's looking for us to just
[1:25:16] claim it now
[1:25:18] to grow up and claim the word
[1:25:22] luke 2 verse 41
[1:25:24] luke chapter 2 verse 41
[1:25:27] now his parents
[1:25:28] went to jerusalem every year at the
[1:25:30] feast of the passover
[1:25:32] notice here mary was faithful every year
[1:25:36] and when jesus was 12 years old so
[1:25:38] imagine this who's 12 years old here any
[1:25:40] 12 year olds
[1:25:43] okay 11
[1:25:44] 13
[1:25:47] what how old are you
[1:25:49] 11.
[1:25:51] see
[1:25:52] one year younger than jesus in this
[1:25:55] story
[1:26:01] and when jesus was 12 years old they
[1:26:03] went up to jerusalem at the custom
[1:26:06] after the custom of the feast and when
[1:26:08] they had fulfilled the days as they
[1:26:10] returned the child jesus terry behind
[1:26:13] in jerusalem
[1:26:15] and
[1:26:18] jonathan
[1:26:19] gabriel knew it not
[1:26:24] this is not funny
[1:26:26] we went to a funeral
[1:26:32] and we left without one of our children
[1:26:36] her name is rosemary
[1:26:39] and i thought she was with another
[1:26:41] company
[1:26:44] that had already left
[1:26:47] but she wasn't she was in another room
[1:26:49] checking things out she always wanted to
[1:26:51] be a spy
[1:26:55] so i could relate to this situation
[1:26:58] i think a lot of times we assume jesus
[1:27:01] is with us but he's really not
[1:27:07] but they supposing him to have been in
[1:27:09] the company went a day's journey and
[1:27:11] they sought him among their kins folks
[1:27:14] and acquaintance
[1:27:16] and when they found him not they turned
[1:27:18] back to the place they left him
[1:27:21] in jerusalem seeking him
[1:27:24] that's usually where we're seeking
[1:27:25] wherever you left him he'll be right
[1:27:27] there waiting for you
[1:27:29] and it came to pass
[1:27:30] that after three days
[1:27:32] they finally found him in the temple
[1:27:35] that's usually where you'll find him is
[1:27:36] in church
[1:27:40] sitting in the midst of doctors
[1:27:43] both hearing them
[1:27:45] and asking them questions
[1:27:48] i like that
[1:27:50] i can imagine
[1:27:51] a 12 year old
[1:27:53] listening
[1:27:54] asking questions
[1:27:58] and you know when you can tell how smart
[1:28:01] somebody is by the question they ask
[1:28:06] are they asking like a dummy
[1:28:08] are they asking like some like they know
[1:28:10] something
[1:28:12] kind of put things together
[1:28:16] like there are certain things you could
[1:28:18] ask me and i would go whoa
[1:28:23] because i just don't know
[1:28:28] you want to
[1:28:32] we got many examples in here of people
[1:28:34] who know their stuff
[1:28:37] i'm not the guy to go to to learn how to
[1:28:40] get bugs out
[1:28:42] in fact i wish brother roger would have
[1:28:44] been in our place that we stayed
[1:28:47] because we found about 12 cockroaches
[1:28:53] and they were not all dead
[1:28:56] now where's brother roger when you need
[1:28:58] him i was going to fly him out take care
[1:29:00] of the situation
[1:29:03] but jesus must have been asking the
[1:29:05] right questions
[1:29:08] and all that heard him were astonished
[1:29:11] at his understanding
[1:29:13] and answers
[1:29:15] and when they saw him they were amazed
[1:29:19] this is my 12 year old boy
[1:29:22] and his mother said unto him son
[1:29:27] why
[1:29:28] has thou
[1:29:30] dealt with us in this manner why are you
[1:29:32] treating us like this why
[1:29:35] are you not with us what are you kind of
[1:29:38] doing your own thing
[1:29:44] thy father
[1:29:46] and i
[1:29:47] have sought thee
[1:29:50] sorrowing they were definitely
[1:29:56] moved
[1:29:57] naturally can you say that
[1:30:00] can you say amen to that
[1:30:02] and the 12 year old boy said unto them
[1:30:05] how is it that you sought me
[1:30:08] wish ye not that i must be
[1:30:11] about my father's business
[1:30:15] and here her natural father
[1:30:18] was trying to tell
[1:30:20] jesus about his business
[1:30:22] you know he had a carpenter business too
[1:30:24] you know
[1:30:26] we got to get back to work gotta get
[1:30:28] back to galilee nazareth
[1:30:30] we gotta get back and start
[1:30:32] judea judah
[1:30:35] wherever it was at that time
[1:30:40] but
[1:30:42] we see here
[1:30:43] two fathers coming into the same scene
[1:30:45] here
[1:30:47] the natural
[1:30:48] and the spiritual
[1:30:52] and here jesus was so focused
[1:30:55] on the spiritual
[1:30:58] that his delight was i can't wait to get
[1:31:01] to church
[1:31:03] i can't wait to get to the men's meeting
[1:31:06] can't wait to talk about the lord
[1:31:09] can't wait to inquire is that what david
[1:31:11] said one thing if i desire to the lord
[1:31:13] that why seek after all the days of my
[1:31:16] life
[1:31:18] he wanted to inquire in that temple
[1:31:22] to behold the beauty of the lord
[1:31:26] and here were some men as a 12 year old
[1:31:29] that we're looking at
[1:31:31] wow wow wow this little 12 year old was
[1:31:35] sharing
[1:31:36] his understanding
[1:31:39] from his heavenly father
[1:31:43] wow
[1:31:47] i can you imagine that happened to you
[1:31:51] i think some of us would have just
[1:31:53] looked at
[1:31:55] mary joseph and said look
[1:31:58] you did your job
[1:32:00] don't you be telling me what you don't
[1:32:02] working for my father
[1:32:06] seriously that's kind of spirit
[1:32:08] sometimes we see manifest
[1:32:10] but that is not the spirit that jesus
[1:32:12] had
[1:32:14] now he just asked the question don't you
[1:32:16] realize i must be about my father's
[1:32:18] business
[1:32:19] is this is there is no concept why isn't
[1:32:22] this concept is here
[1:32:24] it's part of part of my my calling
[1:32:29] and we can lose track spiritually what
[1:32:32] should be happening in our homes if we
[1:32:34] get too much in the flesh just a routine
[1:32:37] go to church come home go to jerusalem
[1:32:39] go to the feast come back and just
[1:32:42] natural
[1:32:44] not recognize that god is really
[1:32:48] preparing us for something greater amen
[1:32:50] amen
[1:32:53] the bible says and they understood not
[1:32:56] the sayings which he spake unto them
[1:33:00] they weren't connected
[1:33:04] they were in the flesh
[1:33:06] jesus was in the spirit
[1:33:09] and if we when we come to church we need
[1:33:11] to get in the spirit or it's just going
[1:33:13] to be some natural story
[1:33:17] and he went down with them and he came
[1:33:19] to nazareth and was what subject unto
[1:33:22] them
[1:33:23] but his mother kept all these sayings in
[1:33:26] her heart
[1:33:27] and jesus increased in wisdom and statue
[1:33:30] and favor with god and man
[1:33:35] notice
[1:33:38] no matter how right you are
[1:33:40] or how wrong
[1:33:42] you may think someone is
[1:33:45] the the bible says the younger submit
[1:33:47] yourself to the elder
[1:33:51] be subject one to another
[1:33:53] the word was being manifested even
[1:33:56] though there was a a
[1:33:58] a
[1:33:59] a kind of like a conflict that was
[1:34:01] happening
[1:34:03] there was
[1:34:05] there was really a tr i feel that there
[1:34:07] was like a trial right now
[1:34:09] that it transpired
[1:34:13] because jesus he didn't say oh you know
[1:34:16] i just got two more minutes and i was
[1:34:18] planning on coming home anyways
[1:34:21] he didn't do that
[1:34:24] and mary didn't understand
[1:34:28] so there was a battle going on did she
[1:34:30] ever urge to say you don't do this to
[1:34:32] your parents
[1:34:34] there was a battle there notice how it
[1:34:37] was handled
[1:34:38] the bible says that mary kept all these
[1:34:40] sayings in her heart
[1:34:43] in other words she didn't lean to her
[1:34:44] own understanding
[1:34:47] she didn't voice it out there she didn't
[1:34:49] yell at the young boy and drag him by
[1:34:51] the collar and say let's get back you
[1:34:53] should know better than that
[1:34:56] mary trusted in the holy spirit to work
[1:35:00] this out
[1:35:03] this is important for us to understand
[1:35:04] there's certain times we just really
[1:35:06] want to grind it into our kids
[1:35:10] grind it into our brother our sister
[1:35:13] but we got to learn to trust the holy
[1:35:14] ghost
[1:35:16] look at jesus he was right in the will
[1:35:19] of his heavenly father doing the work of
[1:35:22] his heavenly father
[1:35:24] but he didn't fight with his natural
[1:35:26] parents
[1:35:28] he didn't contradict them
[1:35:32] he didn't try to prove how right he was
[1:35:34] wrong and how or how right he was or how
[1:35:36] wrong they were
[1:35:37] he didn't act stubborn or resentful
[1:35:41] but he trusted the father for the
[1:35:43] situation when he he committed himself
[1:35:46] to the father and was subject to his
[1:35:47] parents
[1:35:50] see it wasn't just a easy bowl of
[1:35:52] cherries a lot of times when we have
[1:35:53] problems with our children they don't
[1:35:55] understand
[1:35:58] and when you're in perfectly in the will
[1:36:00] of the lord they may not understand
[1:36:04] this is where we need god in our home
[1:36:06] and in our lives to handle things the
[1:36:08] way the holy ghost handles them
[1:36:11] mary abandoned all her reasonings her
[1:36:13] understanding in the situation she
[1:36:16] trusted the lord to direct her
[1:36:18] she stayed sensitive to the holy ghost
[1:36:22] i believe mary maintained her faith in
[1:36:24] the word
[1:36:25] of god even at that moment be it unto me
[1:36:28] according to thy word
[1:36:31] through every thing mary held true to
[1:36:34] trusting the word
[1:36:36] she didn't hesitate to tell others to
[1:36:38] trust the lord either
[1:36:40] even before jesus started performing
[1:36:42] miracles she was pointing people to
[1:36:45] jesus did you know that
[1:36:47] before she even saw the miracles in john
[1:36:49] chapter 2 verse 1 and the third day
[1:36:52] there was a marriage in
[1:36:54] cain of galilee cana of galilee and the
[1:36:57] ma and we know that was the first
[1:36:58] miracle right that he started doing and
[1:37:00] the mother of jesus was there
[1:37:02] and both jesus
[1:37:05] and both jesus was called and and his
[1:37:07] disciples to the marriage and when they
[1:37:09] and when they wanted wine the mother of
[1:37:11] jesus said on
[1:37:13] on to jesus
[1:37:15] um
[1:37:16] they have no wine
[1:37:19] and jesus saith unto her woman
[1:37:21] what am i to do with thee my hour has
[1:37:24] not yet come notice how spiritual he was
[1:37:29] it was all and we we sometimes live so
[1:37:31] much in the flesh that we forget what
[1:37:33] god's called us to do
[1:37:37] and his mother saith on the to the
[1:37:39] servants to the servants
[1:37:41] look whatever he says just do it it's
[1:37:44] going to work
[1:37:46] the greatest thing that we can do as a
[1:37:48] mother is tell others to trust jesus
[1:37:51] that whatever jesus says just do it i'll
[1:37:53] tell you as a mother as a father as a
[1:37:56] brother as a sister that is the greatest
[1:37:58] thing that you can tell anybody whatever
[1:38:01] the word says just do it it'll work
[1:38:08] she didn't sit here and try to tell the
[1:38:10] servant well you know just going to do
[1:38:12] it like this and this and that you know
[1:38:13] it's going to no
[1:38:18] what what
[1:38:20] did um
[1:38:25] was it the john telling his disciples
[1:38:29] there's jesus follow him
[1:38:31] that's what a true servant will do is
[1:38:34] point even those that are following you
[1:38:36] to jesus
[1:38:39] it's the greatest thing we can do as a
[1:38:41] mother as a father
[1:38:48] would you
[1:38:50] would you ever want to be
[1:38:53] a brother to jesus
[1:38:55] a sister
[1:38:56] a mother just kin wouldn't it be just
[1:38:59] wonderful to be kin
[1:39:01] i know i'm stepping a little bit beyond
[1:39:03] boundaries but
[1:39:05] bear with me because we have a chance to
[1:39:08] literally
[1:39:10] be kin to jesus today today
[1:39:14] matthew chapter 12 verse 43.
[1:39:18] i'm just going to skip a few verses here
[1:39:19] but he's talking uh about an unclean
[1:39:23] spirit
[1:39:24] that uh if it goes out
[1:39:27] we got to get filled with the holy ghost
[1:39:28] quickly
[1:39:30] if not where spirits are going to come
[1:39:33] in verse 46 and while he yet talked to
[1:39:35] the people behold his mother and his
[1:39:36] brother and stood without desiring to
[1:39:38] speak with him and one said unto him
[1:39:40] behold thy mother and thy brother and
[1:39:42] stand without their desire to speak with
[1:39:44] you
[1:39:46] and he answered and said unto him that
[1:39:49] was speaking
[1:39:50] that told him
[1:39:53] who is my mother let's just get this
[1:39:56] thing straight
[1:39:57] who is my mother
[1:39:59] and who are my brethren
[1:40:02] and he stretched forth
[1:40:03] his hand towards his disciples i don't
[1:40:06] know how many were there
[1:40:10] and he said behold
[1:40:13] my mother
[1:40:15] my brethren
[1:40:18] for whosoever shall do the will of my
[1:40:20] father which is in heaven
[1:40:22] the same as my brother
[1:40:24] the same as my sister the same is my
[1:40:27] mother
[1:40:29] you have a chance to exceed
[1:40:34] we all have an opportunity to be the
[1:40:36] very best mother
[1:40:39] sister brother
[1:40:41] to our lord
[1:40:42] yes
[1:40:43] today amen don't wait
[1:40:46] today is the day i want to do more for
[1:40:49] the lord
[1:40:51] turn with me if you would to luke
[1:40:52] chapter 11.
[1:40:54] it's not about being naturally connected
[1:40:58] it's about being spiritually connected
[1:41:00] right
[1:41:00] luke 11 27 and it came to pass as he
[1:41:03] spake these things a certain woman
[1:41:06] of the company lifted up her voice and
[1:41:08] said unto him blessed is the womb that
[1:41:10] bear thee in the paths that thou sucked
[1:41:14] but jesus said
[1:41:15] ye rather
[1:41:17] rather
[1:41:18] blessed are they that hear the word of
[1:41:21] god and keep it amen
[1:41:25] it's greater to hear the word and to
[1:41:28] keep it
[1:41:29] than to think of a natural relationship
[1:41:31] with jesus
[1:41:32] come on can you say amen
[1:41:36] our job as a mother
[1:41:38] mothers is not over
[1:41:41] ever over
[1:41:43] our job as a brother is never old as a
[1:41:47] son it's never over
[1:41:49] john chapter 19 verse 25 this could be
[1:41:52] my last set of scriptures
[1:41:55] now there stood by the cross of jesus
[1:41:57] his mother
[1:41:59] and his mother sister and mary
[1:42:01] the wife of clappes and mary magdalene
[1:42:05] and when jesus therefore saw his mother
[1:42:08] and his disciples standing by whom he
[1:42:10] loved
[1:42:13] john was so humble he didn't want to say
[1:42:14] it was even him
[1:42:17] he saith unto them his mother woman
[1:42:21] behold thy son now notice the bible
[1:42:24] always
[1:42:25] called
[1:42:26] mary the mother
[1:42:30] always the word that's what the word
[1:42:31] says but jesus never called mary his
[1:42:34] mother
[1:42:37] even right here on the cross at the very
[1:42:39] end
[1:42:40] because it would take away from deity
[1:42:43] it would take away from god that he he
[1:42:46] is
[1:42:48] the bible says the beginning
[1:42:50] but he's really front before that
[1:42:55] we just we just can't comprehend it
[1:42:59] so harry's he's he's pointing to his
[1:43:02] natural
[1:43:03] mother
[1:43:04] natural one that brought him in and to
[1:43:07] the natural son
[1:43:09] not not spiritual here but this is
[1:43:11] natural woman
[1:43:13] behold thy son
[1:43:16] then saith he to the disciple behold thy
[1:43:18] mother and from that hour that disciple
[1:43:21] took her onto his own home
[1:43:26] so i'll say here
[1:43:27] here we see the love that jesus had for
[1:43:31] mary
[1:43:32] and even the love that jesus had for for
[1:43:35] his disciple john
[1:43:38] where
[1:43:39] i don't care how old we are
[1:43:41] we need a mother
[1:43:52] don't tell me
[1:43:53] there's never a time
[1:43:55] that you don't wish
[1:43:57] someone would talk to you like a mother
[1:44:02] i don't care if she's gone like my
[1:44:05] mother's past and i'll tell you when
[1:44:06] someone's feeling that role of a mother
[1:44:08] to me
[1:44:10] i i appreciate that
[1:44:13] god was looking out after
[1:44:15] john
[1:44:16] and
[1:44:17] and and mary
[1:44:18] and they wanted
[1:44:20] that relationship
[1:44:24] to keep going even though he was leaving
[1:44:29] and that's how we need to be thinking
[1:44:32] with one another
[1:44:34] most of us know whether our parents are
[1:44:36] are living not living
[1:44:38] somebody's got to step in the gap
[1:44:41] be christ to that person amen
[1:44:44] amen be christ to that person in every
[1:44:46] possible way that you can
[1:44:53] let it be on the inside of every mother
[1:44:55] to care for the younger
[1:44:58] always no matter what i don't care if
[1:45:00] it's your child or not
[1:45:03] and may it be on the inside of every
[1:45:04] child to respect and honor take care of
[1:45:07] our mothers
[1:45:08] and if it's not your mother it's
[1:45:10] somebody's mother
[1:45:11] respect them
[1:45:14] god has put us
[1:45:15] in this church
[1:45:18] to edify one another amen
[1:45:21] to build one another up
[1:45:24] and we need natural encouragement we
[1:45:27] need spiritual encouragement
[1:45:31] and let god use you
[1:45:34] to edify and to help
[1:45:38] we don't
[1:45:40] stop
[1:45:42] just because we're 30 or 40.
[1:45:46] amen
[1:45:48] don't ever stop taking care of one
[1:45:50] another
[1:45:52] don't ever slow down your respect for
[1:45:54] one another
[1:45:56] we don't know how much time we're gonna
[1:45:58] have i just got one more quote i want
[1:46:00] you to think about this my most my
[1:46:02] children are gone i got a heavy
[1:46:04] influence on anne because she's still in
[1:46:05] the home
[1:46:07] so what i do with my influence is i make
[1:46:09] sure she cleans my room takes care of my
[1:46:11] lawn does the dishes washes the windows
[1:46:14] and i'm such an influence to her
[1:46:17] no i'm talking about we have a chance to
[1:46:19] bring
[1:46:20] more of christ
[1:46:24] but we're fortunate that we got this
[1:46:26] time
[1:46:27] with her
[1:46:28] we are so fortunate
[1:46:30] i remember i've told this story
[1:46:32] with my daughter abigail my first one
[1:46:34] even all my kids were not born at this
[1:46:36] time but she was nine years old i was
[1:46:38] sitting there on the swing and we were
[1:46:39] just waiting for the rest of the family
[1:46:40] to get ready before we stepped into the
[1:46:42] car to go to church
[1:46:44] and i remember sitting there in a swing
[1:46:45] just just me and her and
[1:46:47] his birds were singing it was in the
[1:46:49] spring and it was just so beautiful but
[1:46:51] this overwhelmingness of empty syndrome
[1:46:55] empty nest syndrome came over me
[1:46:57] at that point i just knew that one day
[1:47:00] i'm not going to be with her
[1:47:01] i remember sitting in the car as sure as
[1:47:04] anything the holy ghost came in that
[1:47:05] room in that room that car i'll never
[1:47:08] forget it i've never i don't know if
[1:47:10] i've ever said it
[1:47:12] but god came in that in that car and
[1:47:15] spoke and that car was full of people
[1:47:18] and he spoke exactly that i had to let
[1:47:21] elizabeth go
[1:47:24] and it needed that for me
[1:47:26] i needed to hear that not that i was
[1:47:28] seeking it not that i was wanting it
[1:47:31] because i was so attached to her
[1:47:35] but it took the grace of god
[1:47:38] it took the great god gave me grace thy
[1:47:41] will be done be it unto me according to
[1:47:43] that word
[1:47:48] we only got a short time this is the
[1:47:50] point that i'm trying to say i got one
[1:47:52] quote i want to leave you with
[1:47:56] moses
[1:47:57] only had a short time i'm sorry jacob
[1:48:00] jacobin
[1:48:01] moses mother only had a short time with
[1:48:03] moses
[1:48:06] because they were killing all the babies
[1:48:10] and even though
[1:48:12] she found favor
[1:48:14] because moses found favor with feral's
[1:48:17] daughter
[1:48:20] and she got to raise them
[1:48:22] she knew
[1:48:23] it was just a matter of time that she
[1:48:25] wouldn't have them
[1:48:26] i mean i i believe as as soon as
[1:48:29] pharaoh's daughter wanted him in that
[1:48:31] in that in pharaoh's castle was going to
[1:48:33] happen
[1:48:37] so she had such a little bit of time and
[1:48:39] i believe she poured everything she had
[1:48:42] into her child about jesus
[1:48:45] about god about jehovah about about the
[1:48:48] the truth
[1:48:51] didn't let time go by and watch movies
[1:48:53] and it didn't matter what you did
[1:48:56] no it mattered
[1:48:58] it mattered
[1:49:00] we only have a little bit of time to
[1:49:03] influence one another
[1:49:05] pretty soon our children are going to be
[1:49:06] gone those of you that your children are
[1:49:08] gone i'm sure you can relate to this
[1:49:10] brother brandon said in the message the
[1:49:12] invasion of the united states
[1:49:15] that jacob taught moses he said that's a
[1:49:18] real mother she taught him the precepts
[1:49:20] of the lord
[1:49:22] she told him let's stand together she
[1:49:24] told him how he must be
[1:49:27] holy
[1:49:31] think about that she told him how he
[1:49:33] must be holy
[1:49:35] she told him
[1:49:37] and what he must live
[1:49:39] and how and what god must do
[1:49:42] would do for him it stuck with moses
[1:49:45] all the days of his life
[1:49:49] and any good true loyal mother ought to
[1:49:52] take her little babies
[1:49:53] instead of sending them to the picture
[1:49:55] shows and the dances and so forth like
[1:49:58] that and she'll put them on her lap and
[1:50:00] teach them about the lord jesus
[1:50:04] i'll say it like this
[1:50:07] we have been chosen by god we're highly
[1:50:10] favored
[1:50:12] we only have a little bit of time to get
[1:50:14] ready
[1:50:16] and we only have a little bit of time
[1:50:19] to teach our children amen
[1:50:22] to be
[1:50:25] a father
[1:50:28] to not only our natural children
[1:50:31] but our
[1:50:32] our children among us
[1:50:35] are as mothers or as a brother there's
[1:50:38] only so much time
[1:50:41] god has given us an
[1:50:43] open door here
[1:50:45] to let this be
[1:50:48] a greater part of our our life
[1:50:53] i believe our sister
[1:50:55] linda sister lynn
[1:50:57] she doesn't have any children
[1:51:01] but she spent time
[1:51:04] helping children in some way is that
[1:51:05] right
[1:51:06] amen
[1:51:11] brother bruce spent time
[1:51:15] doing sunday school
[1:51:19] we
[1:51:20] can be all things to all to one another
[1:51:23] amen let's say we can be christ to one
[1:51:26] another no matter who we're talking to
[1:51:29] god has chosen us may we
[1:51:32] we be the very best we can with what
[1:51:34] time we have
[1:51:36] don't wait till you feel like
[1:51:39] energized and uh
[1:51:42] just believe the word be it unto me
[1:51:45] according to thy word
[1:51:47] amen
[1:51:48] let's bow our hearts and just a word of
[1:51:50] prayer

[1:52:13] us

[1:52:18] there's going to be jesus christ
[1:52:20] manifested in our life as the word says
[1:52:23] that you are the same yesterday today
[1:52:25] and forever and though lord we don't we
[1:52:27] don't understand how that will happen we
[1:52:29] do understand our role
