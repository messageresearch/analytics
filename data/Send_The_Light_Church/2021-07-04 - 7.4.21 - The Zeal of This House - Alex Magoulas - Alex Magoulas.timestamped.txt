[34:48] are on the very cusp
[34:50] of a world entering the darkest and most
[34:53] deceitful
[34:54] the most wicked tribulation father in an
[34:56] age when
[34:57] when men will look for death and not be
[34:59] able to find it
[35:00] but father we're so grateful that in
[35:02] this very perilous hour there's a
[35:04] place of refuge there's a place of
[35:07] safety in our lord jesus christ
[35:08] lord we would not be taken in the hour
[35:10] of temptation the hour of wrath to come
[35:13] you've made a way of escape for us
[35:15] father we not have to be bound by
[35:17] chains of sin snared in satan's eden
[35:20] today

[35:23] now by your spirit may you quicken us
[35:26] lord in these mortal bodies
[35:27] follow me you're quick in our spirits
[35:29] may we come up higher today in
[35:30] revelation
[35:31] and in light and in wisdom by the power
[35:34] of the holy ghost
[35:35] in the name of jesus christ in so much
[35:38] lord that would just continue into the
[35:39] changing of these bodies
[35:41] lord we are in an hour when death shall
[35:43] be put off
[35:44] we should put on immortality lord though
[35:46] it's been sown in weakness to be raised
[35:48] in power
[35:49] though it was certain corruption will be
[35:51] raised incorruptible father we believe
[35:53] it with all of our hearts lord
[35:55] we testify but as witnesses today lord
[35:58] not just
[35:59] observers but witnesses of the
[36:00] resurrection in our own lives father i
[36:03] pray you bless the reading
[36:04] and the ministering the word of god
[36:06] today father there is many needs present
[36:08] in this building that i
[36:09] as a man i'm not aware of lord maybe
[36:12] even in my own life needs that i'm not
[36:14] aware of father but
[36:15] you knew each knee before we come before
[36:17] you lord you knew each knee before the
[36:19] foundation of the world before we asked
[36:22] lord you made a divine appointment for
[36:24] us today to stand here on july 4th of
[36:27] 2021
[36:28] and hear the word of god father may you

[37:04] i feel a little patriotic i was telling
[37:06] the brothers and sisters yesterday
[37:07] i always feel a little patriotic of
[37:08] course i guess that's the idea

[37:12] feel this patriotic is

[37:40] i love being able to shoot a gun and all
[37:42] my american things and praise god well
[37:44] anyway hallelujah if i feel that way
[37:46] about it in the natural how much more
[37:47] the kingdom of god
[37:49] listen we're no longer strangers or
[37:51] aliens aliens from the covenants of
[37:53] promise
[37:53] we are fellow citizens of the kingdom of
[37:56] god we're actually
[37:57] part of the family amen amen st john the
[38:00] second chapter
[38:01] and we'll start here in verse and uh
[38:04] we'll read down to verse 17. the bible
[38:06] says here
[38:07] speaking of our lord jesus uh in verse
[38:10] 13 it says here in the jews passover
[38:12] was at hand notice the jews passover
[38:15] because here comes the actual passover
[38:17] the jews passover was at hand and jesus
[38:19] went up to jerusalem
[38:21] and found in the temple those that sold
[38:23] oxen
[38:24] and sheep and dubs and the changes of
[38:27] money
[38:28] sitting and when he had made a scourge
[38:30] of small
[38:31] cords he drove them all out of the
[38:33] temple and the sheep and the oxen and
[38:35] poured out the changers money
[38:37] and overthrew the tables and he said
[38:40] unto them that sold doves take
[38:41] these things hence make not my father's
[38:45] house
[38:45] and house of merchandise now jesus does
[38:49] this at the end of his ministry before
[38:50] he's crucified but
[38:52] here in john the second chapter he's
[38:54] also done at the beginning of his
[38:55] ministry
[38:56] and i want you to notice the 17th verse
[38:57] here the disciples they saw jesus doing
[39:00] this and it brought to their remembrance
[39:02] something
[39:02] it says and his disciples remembered
[39:05] that it was written the zeal of thine
[39:07] house
[39:08] hath eaten me up amen turn with me to
[39:11] the 69th psalm
[39:13] we're going to look at the scripture
[39:14] that this reminded them of
[39:16] for a context for this morning i'd like
[39:18] to take a thought from my service today
[39:20] the zeal of this house the zeal of
[39:24] this house amen and then the 69th psalm
[39:27] now i went to the wrong bookmark here we
[39:28] go
[39:29] and the 69th psalm and we'll start in
[39:31] verse 6 and go down to verse 9.
[39:33] make things real even here amen the
[39:35] bible says here and this is the psalm of
[39:37] david
[39:38] it says let not them that wait on thee
[39:40] oh lord god of hosts be ashamed for my
[39:43] sake
[39:44] let not those that seek thee be
[39:46] confounded for my sake o
[39:48] god of israel because for thy
[39:51] sake i have borne reproach
[39:55] shame hath covered my face i am become a
[39:58] stranger unto my brethren and an alien
[40:01] unto my mother's children
[40:03] why for the zeal of thine
[40:06] house hath eaten me up and the
[40:09] reproaches of them that reproached thee
[40:12] are fallen upon me may the lord bless
[40:14] the reading of his word
[40:16] you may be seated today while i remain
[40:18] standing for
[40:19] some time
[40:23] if you want to stand or whatever that's
[40:24] all right you know if the lord's in it i
[40:26] mean
[40:26] i wouldn't get up and uh shoot any
[40:28] firecrackers off yet but
[40:30] we do some spiritual uh jubilee here
[40:32] amen but
[40:33] uh we're talking about the zeal of this
[40:35] house and i think it's interesting when
[40:36] we read the scripture when we read about
[40:38] jesus coming into the temple it's a very
[40:39] portrait of a religious gathering
[40:42] we understand by the message that satan
[40:44] is not a creator
[40:45] amen he can only pervert what god has
[40:47] done even even everything that satan
[40:49] does is just a perversion
[40:50] what is adultery it's a right act done
[40:52] wrong what is a lie it's a truth
[40:53] perverted so
[40:54] satan is not a creator he there's
[40:56] nothing original
[40:57] in the kingdom of of the powers of
[40:59] darkness so we
[41:00] look at what he's doing here it's a
[41:02] religious gathering because that's what
[41:03] satan's always desired
[41:04] he's always desired worship he's he's
[41:06] religious he's you know he's a worship
[41:08] leader he's a
[41:09] he's a deacon he's everything else i
[41:11] mean he he wants everything that god has
[41:12] he wants a man in the pulpit he's got
[41:14] men in the pulpit today
[41:15] they're transformed as ministers of
[41:17] righteousness because he himself
[41:19] is transformed as an angel of light and
[41:21] so we look today and we can
[41:23] as as church going people church going
[41:26] people tend to look on the world as
[41:27] that guy out there it's the movies and
[41:30] the drugs and the alcohol
[41:32] but i want you always notice where the
[41:33] world is at it's right in church
[41:36] amen it's right there because the world
[41:38] loves to worship
[41:40] the world loves to praise god it just
[41:41] does it according to its own dictates
[41:43] amen
[41:44] so we look at this gathering like i said
[41:45] it's the jews passover
[41:47] they had their own concept of the
[41:48] passover the passover
[41:50] was an observance to them and yet our
[41:52] passover jesus christ
[41:54] the very one that the passover was
[41:56] testifying of was
[41:57] right there in their midst and they
[41:59] missed him so they're celebrating the
[42:01] passover
[42:02] but the passover himself is right there
[42:04] and they missed it
[42:05] amen they're going about their business
[42:08] making business in the temple
[42:10] but jesus is going about his father's
[42:12] business
[42:13] and then there's a group of people
[42:15] they're very zealous the bible says
[42:17] for their traditions but jesus was
[42:19] zealous that day as well
[42:21] not for the traditions and for selling
[42:22] some dubs but there was a zeal of this
[42:25] house the scripture testified of him
[42:26] that the zeal of this house
[42:28] it had eaten him up so we noticed and we
[42:31] noticed
[42:31] all through the scripture god and satan
[42:33] they're actually doing the same thing
[42:34] amen because satan's just trying to copy
[42:36] god listen the bible says that satan's
[42:38] going about the earth to and fro
[42:40] the book of job says he's going to and
[42:42] fro he's seeking someone peter says
[42:45] seeking someone to devour but the eyes
[42:47] of the lord are also going to and fro
[42:50] throughout the whole earth looking for
[42:52] someone i believe there's someone like
[42:54] that here today
[42:55] looking for someone to show himself
[42:57] mighty on their behalf
[42:59] he's looking for somebody to believe
[43:01] this word in the midst of the darkest
[43:03] most perverse
[43:04] religious gathering the world's ever had
[43:07] satan's eden
[43:08] yet there's a people that are going to
[43:10] believe god and stand for the word of
[43:11] god
[43:14] brother brahman says this he says the
[43:16] same people that believed in god
[43:18] and were zealous of god killed jesus
[43:23] i mean listen who killed jesus it wasn't
[43:25] the guy down the bootlegger store
[43:27] it wasn't the al capone of the guy then
[43:29] taxes it was the pastor in church
[43:32] it was a guy claiming to believe the
[43:34] word of god it was the guy who stood up
[43:36] there and read the bible every week
[43:38] he was the one that killed jesus i'm
[43:41] going somewhere with this for a reason
[43:42] amen
[43:43] because paul would testify years later
[43:45] they've got a zeal
[43:46] but it's not after knowledge he said
[43:48] they being
[43:50] ignorant of god's righteousness would
[43:52] not submit to god
[43:54] amen they're ignorant of god's
[43:55] righteousness and he said they weren't
[43:57] about to establish their
[43:58] own righteousness well i know a couple
[44:00] of people like that praise the lord
[44:02] not trying to it's true they're trying
[44:04] to establish their own righteousness
[44:05] their own ability their own purpose
[44:08] their own kingdom
[44:09] because they're ignorant well i'm
[44:12] already off on a tangent praise the lord
[44:13] listen i'm marvel when i see so much go
[44:15] on in churches that calls itself jesus
[44:17] christ
[44:18] calls itself message all this perversion
[44:20] and nonsense i'm thinking or do
[44:22] people just not fear god anymore what
[44:25] what would go through a man's mind and
[44:26] make him turn his back on god like that
[44:28] they're ignorant of god's righteousness
[44:30] they're ignorant of god's purpose
[44:32] because if you knew
[44:33] what this if you had a glimpse of it
[44:35] amen not just a taste of it but if you
[44:37] walked in the fullness of it
[44:39] you would recognize the only thing that
[44:40] awaits is judgment
[44:42] for those that turn down god brother
[44:44] brahm says in the church book he says
[44:46] now
[44:46] this false church has zeal can you name
[44:49] in somebody
[44:50] they have zeal he says make no mistake
[44:53] about that
[44:54] her zeal has literally been that of the
[44:56] jews he quotes saint john 2 17 like i
[44:58] did
[44:58] the zeal of that house of eat me up he
[45:01] says but it is a
[45:02] wrong zeal it is for the house of their
[45:05] own
[45:05] building it is for their own creeds
[45:09] dogmas organizations their own
[45:11] righteousness
[45:13] watch as they have put the word of god
[45:15] out for their own ideas he says they
[45:18] depose
[45:19] the holy ghost and made men leaders amen
[45:23] now we're there's been so much talk
[45:24] about insurrection here back in january
[45:26] and we live in a day where this country
[45:28] rebelled
[45:28] against certain leaders amen but i want
[45:30] you to know what the church world has
[45:32] done they have rebelled against the
[45:34] headship of the word of god
[45:36] the bro the prophet said they deposed
[45:38] the holy ghost
[45:39] i hope you catch what i'm saying they
[45:40] didn't politely ask jesus to step down
[45:43] they didn't ask him hey can you
[45:44] compromise a little bit can you move
[45:46] they deposed the holy ghost
[45:48] they forced them out violently they
[45:49] would not have
[45:51] anything to do with this man called
[45:53] jesus they shoved him out and now he's
[45:55] on the outside
[45:56] knocking on the door they pushed him out
[45:59] he didn't leave on his own they pushed
[46:01] him out
[46:03] they says this they have put aside
[46:05] eternal life as a person
[46:06] and make it good works or even church
[46:09] conformity rather than good works
[46:11] well we gotta look like the message we
[46:13] gotta act like the message hey i'm not
[46:14] against that you should look a certain
[46:16] way
[46:16] you should act a certain way but it does
[46:18] no good unless the life is in you to
[46:20] produce it
[46:22] listen if you put a bunch of of doves
[46:24] feathers on a raven guess what
[46:26] that raven's just a hypocrite we've got
[46:29] to have the oil coming out from the
[46:31] inside to clean this thing on the
[46:32] outside amen
[46:34] he says this god is calling for another
[46:37] zeal maybe we should name it that
[46:38] another zeal
[46:40] it called for another it is a zeal to
[46:42] cry i
[46:43] am wrong oh that's where we get excited
[46:46] we love being wrong don't we
[46:48] he says the question who's going to say
[46:50] he's wrong hey man
[46:51] not thinking about it that's a pretty
[46:52] tall question because who's going to say
[46:54] they're wrong
[46:55] that's we live in 2021 you've got more
[46:57] information
[46:58] you've got more technology listen you if
[47:01] you want to fix your car you can diy it
[47:03] on youtube
[47:04] you can be an expert in anything
[47:06] overnight and you let everybody know
[47:07] you're an expert
[47:09] well i know more about the message than
[47:10] the pastor i know more about them
[47:12] brothers so and so on and i know about
[47:14] and i know this and i know that mutant
[47:16] god we got an understanding
[47:17] it's contrary to the word of god after
[47:19] all but but we got an understanding
[47:21] everybody's right it's no different than
[47:24] the book of judges
[47:25] everybody did what was right in their
[47:27] own eyes that's not
[47:29] special
[47:32] everybody's always right and everyone
[47:34] always takes their time to let you know
[47:35] they're always right but where
[47:38] somebody's gonna say i'm wrong
[47:41] not me lord i'm wrong you're right
[47:44] my opinion my thoughts my feelings it
[47:48] doesn't matter that's why i say
[47:49] listen i'm not moved today by what i
[47:51] feel i'm not moved today by what i see
[47:54] i'm moved
[47:55] by what i believe no matter the
[47:58] circumstances
[47:59] no matter what anybody else says about
[48:01] it god is still right
[48:04] let every man's word be a lie
[48:07] and gods be true
[48:11] listen christ is always right and more
[48:13] importantly he's always righteous
[48:16] i mean see we're so worried about being
[48:17] right these jews were we're right and
[48:19] you're wrong
[48:20] listen they thought being right made
[48:22] them righteous but it's not the same
[48:24] only christ can make you righteous jesus
[48:26] said if your righteousness does not
[48:28] exceed that of the pharisees you can't
[48:30] even make it in the kingdom
[48:36] listen when jesus made a call in this
[48:38] hour
[48:39] revelation 3 what do you say be zealous
[48:41] therefore and repent
[48:43] because you're wrong amen we've got to
[48:46] make it right with god amen
[48:48] he made a call on this hour as many as i
[48:50] love i rebuke and chasten
[48:52] beas out that's another zeal be selfish
[48:55] therefore
[48:55] and repent now i marvel at this and i
[48:59] was studying this a little while back
[49:01] hearing things
[49:02] because he says if any man hears my
[49:04] voice he says
[49:05] i will open up the door and he says
[49:07] behold i stand at the door at night
[49:10] behold i stand at the door and knock
[49:11] anyone hears my voice
[49:13] and i begin to think about i'm like wait
[49:14] a minute he didn't say nothing he's
[49:16] knocking you know if i come to the door
[49:19] brother mark opens the door i'm like oh
[49:20] you heard my voice
[49:21] he's like well no i heard you knocking
[49:23] it was really strange i'm like wait he's
[49:24] knocking at the door he says well man
[49:26] here's my voice
[49:27] and i begin to think about that now
[49:28] that's striking to me because he's
[49:30] knocking at the door and he says if you
[49:32] hear my voice that means somewhere
[49:34] god was speaking amen and i thought
[49:37] about it i remember brother branham in
[49:38] the seventh seal
[49:39] he begins to tell us these seven
[49:40] thunders what did they come to do
[49:42] to wake up the church and he says they
[49:45] don't they don't come at once it says
[49:46] it's one after the
[49:48] the prophet actually begins to tap on
[49:49] the pulpit one
[49:51] two three explain what the thunders are
[49:53] and it dawned on me what is the thunders
[49:55] just it's the voice of god brother
[49:56] branham said in other words the thunders
[49:59] was god
[50:00] knocking out the door that's why brother
[50:02] brady when he preaches the seal says
[50:04] i'll lose
[50:04] ten thousand friends over this he knew
[50:07] that christ
[50:08] knocking by a seventh under revelation
[50:11] would be pushed
[50:12] out of the church it has to happen it
[50:14] was prophesied in this day
[50:16] but praise god there is a people when
[50:19] they heard those thunders
[50:20] it was more than a prophet speaking it
[50:22] was more than thunder
[50:24] it was more than noise it was more than
[50:25] a tape ministry it was the son of man
[50:28] speaking to us in this hour through a
[50:31] son of man
[50:32] we've recognized the voice that's why we
[50:34] open the door
[50:36] it's more than a man speaking god spoke
[50:38] through that man
[50:41] amen see the world just thinks it's a
[50:44] bunch of nonsense
[50:45] they look at the message they see some
[50:46] tape call they see some evangelists to
[50:48] see a
[50:48] healing ministry they hear the noise but
[50:50] they don't hear the voice
[50:52] it's just like what peter dealt with
[50:53] there on the road to damascus they all
[50:55] heard a noise but they didn't hear the
[50:56] voice
[50:57] they didn't see a man but paul had
[50:59] brother graham said he had spiritual
[51:00] understanding
[51:01] he recognized god had spoken to him oh
[51:03] praise god aren't you so thankful
[51:05] that god has given you an ability when
[51:07] the churches and the world have pushed
[51:09] christ out
[51:10] there's a people they've been
[51:11] preordained to receive him
[51:14] listen he's not come to make a house
[51:16] call he's come to inhabit this place
[51:19] i preach this all the time there's too
[51:21] many people that want a visitation from
[51:23] god
[51:24] god send us a visitation we need a
[51:26] visitation of god
[51:27] what we really need is a habitation
[51:30] let's quit inviting them over once a
[51:32] week
[51:33] let's quit having them over every now
[51:34] and then let him live in your house
[51:36] let him sit down and break bread in your
[51:39] house
[51:41] we got enough of this part-time
[51:42] christianity i worked with a guy like
[51:44] that years ago in the factory
[51:46] he'd been warned about me i was training
[51:48] him one day and he'd been warned about
[51:49] me i worked with him for about half a
[51:51] day or so he said
[51:52] you're not you're not one of them
[51:53] part-time christians are you said no sir
[51:56] no sir i'm full time in the kingdom of
[51:58] god amen i live and breathe jesus christ
[52:01] my very uprising mother renowned setting
[52:03] up jesus christ
[52:04] when i go out as jesus christ when i
[52:06] enter him it's jesus christ
[52:09] hallelujah
[52:12] praise the lord that same god that spoke
[52:15] i've talked about that and
[52:16] brother mark and sister ann were there
[52:18] john 12 when the cloud overshadowed them
[52:20] the different ones heard a voice is that
[52:22] right they said seriously we would see
[52:23] jesus
[52:24] and jesus is there and he's talking to
[52:26] him in the cloud he said father glorify
[52:28] your name and god speaks
[52:29] different ones heard different things
[52:31] different ones all different things but
[52:32] jesus lets you know
[52:33] the voice came for your sakes this is
[52:36] the voice of god in this day what do we
[52:37] have through a prophet's ministry it's
[52:39] for us
[52:41] many people say it's against us or it's
[52:43] not this or it's not that
[52:44] let me testify this message is for me
[52:48] it's not against me it's god he's for
[52:50] you
[52:51] he's for me and if god be for us who
[52:54] can be against us
[52:58] my am i he's done the same thing in this
[53:01] day satan's done the same thing god's
[53:03] done the same thing in this day
[53:04] the conditions are the same the
[53:06] religious world brother bram talks about
[53:08] it
[53:08] they're looking for what they're looking
[53:09] for an awakening they're looking for a
[53:11] great move of god
[53:12] they missed it already happened it's
[53:14] already taken place
[53:16] and even people in a message church will
[53:18] sit there we're waiting for this
[53:20] we're looking for a revival we're
[53:21] looking for the move of god god sent it
[53:23] to you already that's what the message
[53:25] was about the move is on right now
[53:28] that's 1965.
[53:30] the move is on for the bride that's thus
[53:33] saith the lord
[53:35] i like the way william booth said i'm
[53:36] not looking for a move of god
[53:38] i am a move of god this bride is the
[53:41] move of god today
[53:43] she's not waiting for god to come and do
[53:45] something he's already done it
[53:48] we believe it we stand on it we'll live
[53:50] and die on it
[53:54] it's like what brother man preaching the
[53:56] third exodus they were out there in the
[53:57] wilderness
[53:58] waiting on god and brother bam said god
[54:01] was waiting on them

[54:12] creation is groaning
[54:13] and travailing looking for the
[54:16] manifestation of the sons of god

[56:44] room you just don't realize it and let
[56:46] me say this at a little faster frequency
[56:49] a little higher rotation everything you

[56:58] untapped resources
[57:02] man i i'm way off here but i'm going
[57:04] here anyway listen i live in
[57:06] i live in vancouver ohio i grew up in
[57:08] antwerp ohio next town north of us in
[57:10] ohio it's called hicksville
[57:11] what a great name for a town i wonder
[57:13] who lives there
[57:15] hicksville ohio there's an old man that
[57:18] died there when i was a
[57:19] teenager and old man died there they
[57:20] found him in his house one day this old
[57:22] man
[57:22] he didn't have water in his house he'd
[57:24] go take his neighbors running water
[57:26] didn't have electricity he was such a
[57:27] miser he lived through the depression
[57:29] he was such a miser he wouldn't spend
[57:31] money on bills or anything else he'd get
[57:33] ketchup practice from the restaurant she
[57:34] didn't have to buy cats
[57:35] all this stuff just as miserly as you
[57:38] could be and when he died
[57:39] his kids were in the house and guess
[57:40] what the man was a millionaire
[57:43] living in a shack had millions of
[57:45] dollars stuffed in the long coffee cans
[57:47] and under his mattress and everything
[57:48] else
[57:49] but he lived like that listen untapped
[57:51] resources you say
[57:52] we would look at that as individuals in
[57:54] the natural say man there's something
[57:56] wrong with that guy
[57:57] man go buy yourself a new pillow or
[58:00] something get a my pillow or something
[58:01] you know
[58:02] why why live like a beggar when you've
[58:04] got millions of dollars but
[58:05] how often do we as christians we sit in
[58:08] a message church
[58:08] and we live like beggars and we live
[58:10] like paupers listen we are not servants
[58:12] we're not beggars we are sons and
[58:15] daughters of god
[58:17] [Music]
[58:20] listen we're that cloud testify in 1963
[58:22] brother ram told you what it is
[58:24] that's our lord up there listen don't
[58:27] leave him up there
[58:28] 30 miles in the air he's not there today
[58:30] he's in the bride
[58:36] now he's not in the church he's in the
[58:39] bride amen
[58:40] if someone's opened the door someone's
[58:42] going to let him come in
[58:43] someone's going to make him king
[58:45] someone's going to let him sit down a
[58:46] while
[58:47] not just visit for the weekend
[58:49] somebody's going to let him live in the
[58:50] house
[58:52] amen listen there's many that speak of
[58:55] christ
[58:55] but we have christ we have life
[58:59] we have the mind of christ the bible
[59:01] says that is that right
[59:02] we have the mind of christ let this mind
[59:05] that was in christ
[59:06] be in you we're looking for peace
[59:10] let the peace of god rule in your heart
[59:13] you let it it's here if you can receive
[59:17] oh it the lord i don't know what has to
[59:20] do with the rest of my text but
[59:22] i guess that's free brother bam says
[59:24] this he says remember jesus said
[59:26] when he was here on earth talking to a
[59:28] bunch of people
[59:29] who was very religious very fine
[59:32] very cultured a very zealous people of
[59:35] god
[59:36] but jesus said to them in vain you
[59:38] worship me
[59:40] teaching for doctrine their traditions
[59:42] of man
[59:43] he says remember i'm gonna do this now
[59:46] man
[59:46] it's really hot remember how pious those
[59:50] people was
[59:51] and how zealous of god watch this he
[59:54] says i believe if we were counting the
[59:56] people
[59:56] who were more zealous of today or that
[59:58] day they would be more
[1:00:00] zealous than we are far more
[1:00:03] when it comes to keeping the traditions
[1:00:05] and laws and things they
[1:00:06] live by those listen these guys weren't
[1:00:08] playing church
[1:00:10] they were serious about what they did
[1:00:11] but they were just seriously wrong
[1:00:14] they were sincerely wrong he says this
[1:00:16] he says this and they were very souls of
[1:00:18] god
[1:00:19] and they believed in god but jesus god
[1:00:22] made flesh
[1:00:23] among them said in vain you worship me
[1:00:27] i'll catch you since
[1:00:28] i talked about a little bit last week
[1:00:29] too he says now he didn't say they
[1:00:32] didn't worship him
[1:00:33] they was worshiping him but in vain
[1:00:37] can you imagine a lifetime of religious
[1:00:40] service and works and things
[1:00:42] all for nothing what's the point of it
[1:00:44] all this is where they were
[1:00:47] the jews in that temple were very
[1:00:49] zealous for their traditions but i want
[1:00:51] you to notice i pointed this out at the
[1:00:52] beginning
[1:00:53] there was a difference between their
[1:00:54] zeal and jesus's because when the
[1:00:56] disciples saw
[1:00:57] jesus watch they remembered what was
[1:01:00] written
[1:01:01] in other words his deal testified of the
[1:01:04] word of god
[1:01:06] it didn't testify of a man's ability or
[1:01:08] of a man's righteousness or of religion
[1:01:10] it testified the word of god amen that's
[1:01:13] another zeal that's the kind of zeal
[1:01:15] i want to have i don't want people
[1:01:17] saying oh man he's out for his church
[1:01:18] he's zealous for his ministry he zealous
[1:01:21] for this now
[1:01:21] let me be zealous in so much that
[1:01:24] produces the word of god in my life
[1:01:26] every time
[1:01:30] amen they saw a zeal something had
[1:01:33] devoured him amen
[1:01:34] it had consumed him it was the zeal for
[1:01:37] his house
[1:01:38] amen now i just want to use this as a uh
[1:01:42] a
[1:01:42] example for a moment as an illustration
[1:01:44] because you look at a man like saul of
[1:01:46] tarsus who was later the apostle paul
[1:01:48] and when he was a pharisee he was
[1:01:50] zealous then
[1:01:51] and then the bible says that he was
[1:01:53] exceedingly zealous
[1:01:55] so i was like here's the guy that
[1:01:56] zealous then saul's like no i'm i'm
[1:01:58] exceedingly zealous like you look like a
[1:01:59] scrub compared to me
[1:02:01] newbie you know what i'm saying he was
[1:02:03] exceeding sauce galatians 1 14
[1:02:06] i profited in the jews religion above
[1:02:08] many mine equals in my own nation
[1:02:11] being more exceedingly zealous man he's
[1:02:13] really letting you know
[1:02:14] i was he was something else i was being
[1:02:17] more
[1:02:18] exceedingly zealous of the tradition of
[1:02:20] their fathers
[1:02:21] amen now listen i don't want to be
[1:02:22] zealous of a tradition amen
[1:02:25] listen people are zealous of traditions
[1:02:28] in the message people are zealous of
[1:02:30] traditions listen they will fight you
[1:02:32] over christmas
[1:02:33] they'll fight you over their seat in
[1:02:35] church they'll fight you over every
[1:02:36] little thing amen
[1:02:38] listen if we're at thanksgiving and
[1:02:39] there's one piece of turkey left they'll
[1:02:41] fight you for that piece of turkey
[1:02:44] listen people fight over everything all
[1:02:45] the time we'll fight over this light or
[1:02:47] this tree or this or not having it
[1:02:49] we fight over everything else i mean
[1:02:51] listen these jews fought over everything
[1:02:53] they were as divided as any other group
[1:02:55] of people amen
[1:02:57] because they were zealous about their
[1:02:59] traditions
[1:03:00] they say the results about god amen and
[1:03:02] listen we'll stand here
[1:03:04] and we'll get worked up about our
[1:03:05] favorite team we'll get worked up about
[1:03:07] our favorite
[1:03:07] holiday and everything else and praise
[1:03:10] god for america
[1:03:11] we get worked up about all this stuff
[1:03:12] but jesus was worked up about the house
[1:03:14] of god
[1:03:16] listen he was sitting there folding his
[1:03:17] hands he got up and got mad about it
[1:03:19] and he did something about it
[1:03:22] amen praise the lord these jews in the
[1:03:25] temple they were zealous over the
[1:03:26] traditions
[1:03:27] and i want you to notice why they were
[1:03:29] zealous now i already talked about here
[1:03:30] in galatians one
[1:03:32] but we'll talk about this again in
[1:03:34] philippians chapter three paul talks
[1:03:35] about this as well
[1:03:36] why were the jews so zealous for their
[1:03:39] traditions
[1:03:40] there's a actually it's a pretty simple
[1:03:42] reason
[1:03:43] paul tells you i profited in the jewish
[1:03:45] religion
[1:03:47] amen paul says in philippians 3 those
[1:03:49] things were game to me
[1:03:51] in other words man they were zealous
[1:03:53] their traditions because they made money
[1:03:54] doing it
[1:03:56] i tell you what you give a man some
[1:03:57] money he'll get zealous he might not
[1:03:59] come to church
[1:04:00] he might not want to serve god but give
[1:04:02] us some free food or give him a hundred
[1:04:03] dollars
[1:04:04] man he'll be there praise god i love the
[1:04:06] lord jesus
[1:04:07] i love my pastor i love my church i tell
[1:04:09] you what it's a good motivator isn't it
[1:04:11] amen
[1:04:12] it motivated paul it motivated these men
[1:04:14] they were sitting there
[1:04:15] making a bunch of money well that's why
[1:04:17] they were zealous they made money
[1:04:19] at it it was their livelihood amen well
[1:04:22] praise the lord
[1:04:24] listen well that's just the truth anyhow
[1:04:25] amen they were zealous
[1:04:28] because it profited them and when jesus
[1:04:30] appeared they were zealous for their
[1:04:31] traditions
[1:04:32] and jesus was against everything they
[1:04:34] preached and everything they did
[1:04:36] and so you notice this they were zealous
[1:04:38] and then they became jealous
[1:04:40] they became jealous because listen jesus
[1:04:42] was not just another preacher to them
[1:04:44] jesus was not just another man to them
[1:04:46] jesus represented an existential threat
[1:04:49] to everything they did
[1:04:51] because for them to admit they were
[1:04:52] wrong
[1:04:54] i am wrong is that right for them to
[1:04:56] admit they were wrong and repent and
[1:04:58] serve jesus
[1:04:59] would not be to just change churches it
[1:05:01] wouldn't be just to change how they
[1:05:02] worship
[1:05:03] it will be a drastic lifestyle change
[1:05:05] their entire livelihood
[1:05:06] their entire way of life they're
[1:05:08] standing in the community
[1:05:09] they would have to forsake everything
[1:05:13] that's why they couldn't receive them
[1:05:14] listen it was not a minor inconvenience
[1:05:17] listen i've been to countries like afro
[1:05:18] like uh india africa is a continent
[1:05:21] been to countries like india amen where
[1:05:23] christianity is not well received
[1:05:25] listen if you as a as a person born in a
[1:05:28] hindu home
[1:05:29] you become a christian in a country like
[1:05:30] india you lose all kinds of government
[1:05:32] entitlements and education
[1:05:34] everything for them to become a
[1:05:35] christian is not just changing churches
[1:05:37] like it is in america
[1:05:39] it is a drastic is a forsaking their own
[1:05:42] families will forsake them and abandon
[1:05:44] them they've got to change their name
[1:05:46] to show they're not even hindu anymore
[1:05:48] you say what are you doing listen
[1:05:50] you know when they convert they're
[1:05:51] sincere because they have to lose
[1:05:53] something to do it unfortunately i said
[1:05:57] unfortunately i mean i'm not
[1:05:58] i'm not wishing for persecution but it
[1:06:00] seems like we get so complacent
[1:06:02] well i'm going to go to this church and
[1:06:04] i'm going to do this i'm going to do
[1:06:05] that we're going to do what's convenient
[1:06:07] listen
[1:06:07] it was not convenient for these jews to
[1:06:10] receive jesus
[1:06:11] that's why they forsook it that's why
[1:06:13] they rejected it
[1:06:15] paul told me listen it didn't profit me
[1:06:17] to do this
[1:06:18] it profited me to be a jew i profited in
[1:06:21] the religious it was gained to me
[1:06:22] i had status i had money i had
[1:06:25] popularity
[1:06:28] but but the things that were gaining me
[1:06:32] i counted them loss
[1:06:33] [Music]
[1:06:36] amen think about these pharisees jesus
[1:06:40] tells you what it is
[1:06:41] brother says it's an actor right
[1:06:44] jesus tells you why they do what they
[1:06:46] did they love the chief of seats in the
[1:06:48] synagogues they
[1:06:49] love to be seen devouring windows houses
[1:06:51] that for pre-tests they make long
[1:06:53] prayers
[1:06:55] amen everything they did they did
[1:06:57] because it benefited them listen if
[1:07:00] that's the only reason you serve god
[1:07:02] if that's the only reason you're in
[1:07:03] church you're no different than the rest
[1:07:05] of the world
[1:07:08] i'm going somewhere now listen i don't
[1:07:10] know what happened listen this country
[1:07:11] was founded because men made a sacrifice
[1:07:15] we are here today because men and women
[1:07:16] made sacrifices
[1:07:18] and then we got to a place where nobody
[1:07:20] wants to offer sacrifice anymore
[1:07:22] amen we're not going to go to church if
[1:07:23] it's not convenient or if it don't work
[1:07:25] out if nobody pats me on the back
[1:07:26] if i'm not famous if they don't give me
[1:07:28] a bunch of money well i'm not going to
[1:07:29] serve god
[1:07:30] you're no different than a pharisee
[1:07:33] you're not different than a sadducee
[1:07:35] right well i believe if we just
[1:07:36] compromise on the message a little bit
[1:07:38] we could have a bigger class of church
[1:07:39] and a better kind of people
[1:07:42] if that's your motivation you might as
[1:07:44] well be a publican
[1:07:45] or heathen
[1:07:50] see they were zealous for the traditions
[1:07:51] that's why they were jealous of jesus
[1:07:52] christ
[1:07:54] amen they won't have nothing to do with
[1:07:56] church if it don't benefit them
[1:08:00] but here's what i love about paul a man
[1:08:02] he he was
[1:08:03] zealous as a pharisee but look at him as
[1:08:05] a christian
[1:08:06] when god strikes him down off his high
[1:08:08] horse and that pillar of fire meets them
[1:08:10] what i love about paul is not like some
[1:08:12] of these people they go to church and
[1:08:13] they
[1:08:14] they they wait till the church falls
[1:08:15] apart and then just church hop and we're
[1:08:17] gonna go to this next church because
[1:08:18] it's popular it's convenient no paul
[1:08:20] wanted to make sure this time
[1:08:22] he said i didn't confer with man he said
[1:08:24] i went down to arabia for three years
[1:08:26] he started digging he started searching
[1:08:29] he wanted to make sure this time was
[1:08:31] different
[1:08:31] i want to make sure when i get up off
[1:08:33] the ground and i go out and preach this
[1:08:35] i'm not just caught up in the next fad
[1:08:38] some people just move from one message
[1:08:40] fad to another message fad
[1:08:42] some people just live from a trial to
[1:08:43] another trial from one church split to
[1:08:45] another church various
[1:08:47] from one false preacher to another false
[1:08:49] preacher we are called and ordained to
[1:08:51] be changed
[1:08:52] from glory unto glory by the spirit of
[1:08:55] god
[1:09:00] you start digging that's what i'm saying
[1:09:01] some people get very casual
[1:09:03] that's why i talk about devotion last
[1:09:04] week some people get very casual in
[1:09:06] their christian experience
[1:09:07] they go they go through something they
[1:09:09] sit in the church and they preach all
[1:09:10] kinds of blasphemy
[1:09:11] and heresy and they just walk out like
[1:09:14] well pretty good i'll just go somewhere
[1:09:15] else
[1:09:15] and they never sit there and question
[1:09:17] man well i something should have worn me
[1:09:20] i've got to have a deeper experience
[1:09:22] where it don't matter what the pastor
[1:09:23] says
[1:09:23] it don't matter what the deacon says it
[1:09:25] doesn't matter what everybody else says
[1:09:26] i've got to hear from god what is the
[1:09:28] truth
[1:09:29] where i can stand like daniel i can
[1:09:31] stand like elijah
[1:09:32] i can stand when nobody else wants to
[1:09:34] believe it i still believe it because
[1:09:36] god has spoken unto me
[1:09:40] amen brother bram says that's the
[1:09:42] problem we got people that go to church
[1:09:44] i'm methodist to the core
[1:09:45] i'm presbyterian to the core brother
[1:09:47] brahman says i want to be god to the
[1:09:49] core
[1:09:50] give us some god-called christians from
[1:09:52] hardcore die-hard christians and no
[1:09:55] matter what the world says
[1:09:56] it doesn't matter what the church says
[1:09:58] they're gonna live christianity
[1:09:59] they're gonna they're gonna be consumed
[1:10:02] by it
[1:10:07] listen this apostle when he when he when
[1:10:10] he became a christian
[1:10:11] listen he went through the ringer a time
[1:10:13] or two some of you won't get that but
[1:10:14] that's one of the american youth the
[1:10:16] ringer like the old laundry thing and
[1:10:17] praise a lot
[1:10:18] listen paul went through a couple things
[1:10:22] actually paul went through a lot of
[1:10:23] things actually he was warned he would
[1:10:26] go through a lot of things
[1:10:27] think about this imagine a man coming to
[1:10:29] light hands and anonymized come to lay
[1:10:30] hands on him and pray for him to receive
[1:10:32] the holy ghost imagine the man coming to
[1:10:34] lay hands on you as a minister
[1:10:35] and say by the way just so you know god
[1:10:37] has told me you're going to suffer a lot
[1:10:39] of things
[1:10:39] for his name's sake oh praise god i
[1:10:41] can't
[1:10:43] yes i get to suffer from god
[1:10:47] now a lot of us might not have had that
[1:10:48] attitude but that's what the disciples
[1:10:50] thought about it
[1:10:52] listen when they were beaten and they
[1:10:53] were imprisoned and called out for
[1:10:55] preaching in this name
[1:10:56] and they were commanded not to teach in
[1:10:58] this name anymore they went
[1:11:00] out rejoicing listen jesus said rejoice
[1:11:04] when men revile you and persecute you
[1:11:07] and say all manner of evil against you
[1:11:09] falsely for my namesake
[1:11:11] rejoice and be exceeding love for great
[1:11:14] is your reward in heaven
[1:11:17] listen if you stand for this gospel
[1:11:18] you're going to be lied on
[1:11:20] you're going to be called names you're
[1:11:21] going to be treated funny but rejoice
[1:11:24] when it happens for great is your reward
[1:11:33] paul listen paul didn't just get made
[1:11:35] fun of at church
[1:11:36] he was beaten he was afflicted he was
[1:11:39] they put him in prisons and atonements
[1:11:41] and fastings and hungers and stripes his
[1:11:43] shipwrecks
[1:11:44] and everywhere he went he was in trouble
[1:11:47] trouble just seemed to follow him
[1:11:48] everywhere he went
[1:11:50] amen but you know what he wasn't doing
[1:11:53] it because it profited him
[1:11:55] amen the zeal of this house i believe
[1:11:57] it's the same as the our lord jesus had
[1:11:58] that day in the temple
[1:11:59] the zeal for this house had eaten him up
[1:12:02] it was his passion
[1:12:03] it was his drive his ambition his
[1:12:06] all-consuming desire was to present
[1:12:08] a chaste virgin unto bride unto jesus
[1:12:11] christ
[1:12:12] a spouse that chased virgins as a bride
[1:12:14] to jesus christ amen
[1:12:16] that was his whole imperative his life
[1:12:17] was tied up in this it consumed them
[1:12:22] amen
[1:12:26] what caused this man i want you to catch
[1:12:27] this now what caused a man like paul
[1:12:30] who had been a great man a man of status
[1:12:32] and acumen and education and
[1:12:35] all these things what caused this man to
[1:12:38] have such a consuming imperative in his
[1:12:39] life
[1:12:40] he was jealous i'll let that hang there
[1:12:44] saying
[1:12:44] what he was jealous listen he wasn't
[1:12:47] jealous of a man
[1:12:50] amen somebody he wasn't jealous of
[1:12:52] popularity he wasn't jealous of money
[1:12:53] he was jealous over the people of god
[1:12:56] he was jealous for god's sake he said
[1:12:58] i'm jealous over you
[1:13:00] with a godly jealousy because he was
[1:13:03] jealous over god's people because he was
[1:13:05] jealous for god
[1:13:06] that's what made him zealous see the
[1:13:08] jews were zealous and it made him
[1:13:10] jealous
[1:13:10] but paul was jealous that's what made
[1:13:12] him so zealous
[1:13:14] he wasn't jealous over money he wasn't
[1:13:16] jealous over position
[1:13:17] he was just for the lord of hosts and
[1:13:20] his jealousy over god's people
[1:13:22] that nobody would manhandle the purchase
[1:13:25] of god's possession
[1:13:26] that's that jealousy is what drove him
[1:13:29] that jealousy is what consumed him
[1:13:31] that jealousy is what caused him to
[1:13:33] throw himself into harm's way
[1:13:35] despite the circumstances despite the
[1:13:37] peril he would throw himself into the
[1:13:39] breach
[1:13:40] for the people of god
[1:13:44] he goes to the corinthian church he
[1:13:45] tells him that he said i've been jealous
[1:13:46] over you
[1:13:48] with a godly jealousy these other men
[1:13:50] come in and they preach this stuff and
[1:13:52] they loved it they loved all this extra
[1:13:54] nonsense these chiefest apostles
[1:13:55] he said why is the more i love you the
[1:13:57] less i'm loved but so be it
[1:14:00] he said for the father ought to lay up
[1:14:02] for the children and not the children
[1:14:03] for the father there was something
[1:14:05] important even when he was rejected
[1:14:07] by his own brethren like david like
[1:14:10] jesus wrote
[1:14:11] even when he was rejected he had a steal
[1:14:18] i was a stranger to my brother and the
[1:14:20] scripture says
[1:14:21] the reproach of the lord fell upon me
[1:14:25] but the zeal of that house have to eat
[1:14:27] me up
[1:14:29] hey man hey man so
[1:14:32] the question is where is his house today
[1:14:34] listen i can't build a house
[1:14:36] hey man but you can give him one
[1:14:39] can't build him one can't fast one for
[1:14:40] him can't make him one but a body amen
[1:14:44] amen he's not looking for a house made
[1:14:45] with hands but a body's been prepared
[1:14:47] amen
[1:14:48] what is the purpose of that body lo i
[1:14:50] come in the volume of the book it is
[1:14:52] written to me
[1:14:53] i've come to do thy will oh lord
[1:14:56] i believe his body today has come to
[1:14:58] fulfill his will
[1:15:00] on the earth amen
[1:15:03] praise the lord i believe that's why
[1:15:05] prophet would preach this myth listen to
[1:15:06] prophet we talk about sacrifice
[1:15:08] talking about the natural but i want you
[1:15:09] to think about this it cost a profit
[1:15:11] something to preach this message
[1:15:12] it cost some friends it cost them
[1:15:14] influence it cost some money
[1:15:16] listen we look at oral roberts and we
[1:15:18] look at tommy osborne and these men
[1:15:20] listen to prophet he could have had a
[1:15:21] ministry like that
[1:15:23] he could have been the most famous
[1:15:24] popular name there ever was
[1:15:26] but he knew what this word meant god
[1:15:29] knew what this word meant there was a
[1:15:32] little itty bitty people that the world
[1:15:33] rejected
[1:15:34] but you're precious in the sight of god
[1:15:36] and god said i will allow that man to
[1:15:38] compromise
[1:15:39] i won't allow him to preach his own
[1:15:41] thought because there must
[1:15:43] be a bride present on the earth
[1:15:46] to fulfill the will of god my my
[1:15:50] amen so listen it's like this
[1:15:54] hey man when a man receives jesus christ
[1:15:57] in his life it does something for him
[1:15:58] there's a zeal for this house amen
[1:16:00] you're the house of god
[1:16:02] amen you're the thing he's zealous for
[1:16:05] because you're the thing he's
[1:16:06] jealous over his purchase of the
[1:16:08] redemption of his of what he's paid for
[1:16:10] amen
[1:16:11] listen you hear this all the time i hear
[1:16:13] people say this they go to church say
[1:16:14] you know what
[1:16:15] i just i love the church and i love the
[1:16:17] family of god i love getting together i
[1:16:20] love going to service i love my church
[1:16:22] most of them don't love church they just
[1:16:24] love their position
[1:16:26] they just love their fellowship i mean
[1:16:28] they just love what it means to them
[1:16:29] amen
[1:16:30] you want to know if you love the church
[1:16:31] that's not how much you love your pastor
[1:16:34] it's not how much you love the guy with
[1:16:35] the most money it's not how much you
[1:16:37] love your best friend at church
[1:16:38] how much do you love the most least
[1:16:40] insignificant most carnal
[1:16:42] person in your church the one nobody
[1:16:44] else thinks about than one nobody else
[1:16:46] cares about
[1:16:47] can you love them the same way that'll
[1:16:49] show you whether you really love the
[1:16:50] church or not
[1:16:52] listen i had a man coming in one time
[1:16:54] and i'm not trying to speak ill of him
[1:16:55] but it's just the truth
[1:16:56] he come to me one time he said you know
[1:16:58] what brother alex said i just
[1:16:59] and i'm not saying this to both i'm just
[1:17:01] telling you the story he said i just
[1:17:02] really appreciate brother alex
[1:17:03] you always think about you take care of
[1:17:05] these people in the church that other
[1:17:06] people forget about
[1:17:08] the ones that nobody else thinks about
[1:17:10] and i'm thinking he meant that as a
[1:17:12] compliment
[1:17:13] but actually just reflects badly on of
[1:17:15] him
[1:17:17] hey man that doesn't really make me look
[1:17:19] good that just makes other people look
[1:17:21] bad
[1:17:22] amen we're all supposed to do that
[1:17:26] that's not special that's christianity
[1:17:29] eternal life's living for others listen
[1:17:32] the
[1:17:32] least of us should do that that's not oh
[1:17:34] man this preacher he just loves people
[1:17:36] you're supposed to love everybody
[1:17:39] you're supposed to do it what is that
[1:17:41] listen nobody praises the mountain
[1:17:43] because it stood in the distance in the
[1:17:44] morning out in arizona i'm in the
[1:17:46] mountain
[1:17:46] praise god it's stan it just does what
[1:17:48] it does that's not special
[1:17:53] oh man this brother he he just loves
[1:17:55] people
[1:17:56] you're supposed to love people
[1:17:59] that doesn't make me good that makes you
[1:18:01] not as good
[1:18:04] i mean but i'll be honest he said that
[1:18:06] and i know he meant as a compliment that
[1:18:07] devastated me it devastated me
[1:18:09] i said what kind of a testimony is that
[1:18:14] you should be able to say it about
[1:18:15] yourself it didn't make me feel good at
[1:18:16] all
[1:18:17] and i don't need it anyway hey man it's
[1:18:18] like oh you know i always tell that
[1:18:20] story about martin luther or maybe you
[1:18:21] know this one but martin luther talked
[1:18:22] about a man
[1:18:24] i'm getting all kinds of stories today i
[1:18:25] guess hey happy independence day
[1:18:28] martin luther said a man laying in a
[1:18:29] casket it doesn't matter where his best
[1:18:30] friend comes up
[1:18:31] his worst enemy he can slander that man
[1:18:33] he can call him all kinds of names in
[1:18:35] that casket
[1:18:36] you can prop him up say oh he was a good
[1:18:37] man he was just the best of friend
[1:18:39] it doesn't matter what you say to him
[1:18:40] he's dead he doesn't care
[1:18:43] he's not moved by criticism and he's not
[1:18:45] moved by flattery
[1:18:47] and listen when a man is dead in christ
[1:18:49] he's not moved by criticism
[1:18:50] he's not moved by flattery he's moved by
[1:18:53] jesus
[1:18:54] christ because he's actually dead the
[1:18:56] only thing that can move him is
[1:18:57] resurrection
[1:19:01] is that right listen satan can't push
[1:19:02] you down and push you up
[1:19:04] oh you're just the best this and you're
[1:19:05] the greatest and yes now
[1:19:09] i don't need it i don't want it either
[1:19:12] i'm looking for one man to compliment me
[1:19:16] i'm looking for one praise at the end of
[1:19:17] the day when i stand before the lord
[1:19:19] that day
[1:19:20] and i go to my reward i'm looking for
[1:19:22] him to say well done
[1:19:25] it doesn't matter what the critics say
[1:19:27] it doesn't matter what the flatteries
[1:19:28] have to say
[1:19:29] i'm looking for him to say well done
[1:19:32] his voice is the voice that moves me
[1:19:37] you can still say nice things about each
[1:19:38] other that's okay
[1:19:40] don't don't get me wrong well i'm not
[1:19:41] gonna say anything next to that guy i
[1:19:43] wasn't saying that either but
[1:19:45] listen that's what moved these pharisees
[1:19:47] oh man it's just a great man of god what
[1:19:48] a what a powerful what
[1:19:50] a what a praiseworthy man of god that's
[1:19:51] a move then
[1:19:53] that's why they did it listen that's why
[1:19:56] if we just go to church to be seen and
[1:19:57] hurt
[1:19:57] we're here for the wrong reason
[1:20:03] amen they love their church they love
[1:20:05] their position they love this
[1:20:07] but how do you love the least esteemed
[1:20:09] lowest most carnal
[1:20:10] christian in your church that's the
[1:20:12] question amen
[1:20:14] i tell this story sometimes and
[1:20:17] i can't remember if i read the fox book
[1:20:18] of martyrs it's in the histories but uh
[1:20:20] saint lawrence was a deacon in the
[1:20:22] church of roma i believe it was and
[1:20:23] during the great persecution the church
[1:20:25] emperor valerian
[1:20:27] he called saint lawrence to come forth
[1:20:29] on behalf of the church there in rome
[1:20:30] he said now listen he said i'm emperor
[1:20:32] now in rome
[1:20:33] and if you want me to wipe your people
[1:20:35] out you've got to pay tribute to me
[1:20:37] so emperor valerian tells saint lawrence
[1:20:40] that i want you to go back to your
[1:20:41] church
[1:20:41] and bring me the riches of your church
[1:20:44] it's tribute
[1:20:45] it's a tribute to my greatness so st
[1:20:47] lawrence says all right i'll abide by
[1:20:49] your wish great sees her
[1:20:50] and he goes and he comes back three days
[1:20:52] later and he brings you know what he
[1:20:53] does
[1:20:54] he brings every person that's lame every
[1:20:55] person is blind every person that's
[1:20:57] hauled
[1:20:58] all the weak all the infirm and the
[1:21:00] emperor he just he's just fit to be tied
[1:21:02] he's just mad he said you insult me i'm
[1:21:04] an emperor
[1:21:05] i will have you killed for this how dare
[1:21:07] you mock me i said bring me the
[1:21:09] treasures of your church
[1:21:10] not this rabble and saint lawrence i
[1:21:12] love his responses oh great
[1:21:14] emperor live forever these are the
[1:21:16] treasures
[1:21:17] of the church this is the treasure of
[1:21:20] the church
[1:21:21] listen you might feel like you're the
[1:21:22] least least most least esteemed
[1:21:24] christian in church
[1:21:25] but you're a treasure in the sight of
[1:21:26] god

[1:21:49] children and if he really loves god's
[1:21:51] children

[1:22:38] life that bother us to where we can't
[1:22:40] sleep at night
[1:22:41] we just can't even hardly eat a meal
[1:22:43] we're so distraught we're so broke up
[1:22:45] because this person
[1:22:46] didn't shake our hand or this person did
[1:22:48] something to us and it just eats us up
[1:22:50] to where we can't even go on with our
[1:22:51] lives like we used to we can't sleep we
[1:22:54] can't function
[1:22:55] listen if that negative thing would eat
[1:22:57] you up like that
[1:22:58] what's gonna happen when the zeal of
[1:23:00] this house eats you up
[1:23:02] and then quit flirting with it on the
[1:23:04] weekend let it consume
[1:23:06] you let it eat you up till there's
[1:23:08] nothing left
[1:23:10] praise god it's a fire don't just leave
[1:23:12] it shut up in your bones

[1:23:15] in his bones one day he couldn't
[1:23:17] forebear
[1:23:18] i tell you what if i got up one day and
[1:23:20] i said man i just don't feel like
[1:23:21] serving god today
[1:23:22] something in me wouldn't let me stop
[1:23:25] it's like a fire shut up in my bones
[1:23:27] listen god's been too good to me
[1:23:30] god's been too good to me he's been
[1:23:33] better to me than i've been to myself
[1:23:35] i know what i used to be i know what i
[1:23:38] know it was
[1:23:38] i know where i come from i know that
[1:23:40] even at my very best we are all together
[1:23:43] vanity
[1:23:44] but yet god knew our frame that we're
[1:23:47] but gush
[1:23:48] he pities us as the father pities his
[1:23:50] children i know what he's done for me
[1:23:56] that's why i love his children because
[1:23:58] god loves his children because he loves
[1:24:00] me and i'm his child
[1:24:02] amen listen if you love god
[1:24:07] i don't have to make you pray for one
[1:24:08] another
[1:24:10] i don't have to make you take care of
[1:24:12] one another the zeal of this house will
[1:24:14] eat you up
[1:24:15] you'll listen you'll do it when you
[1:24:16] don't even feel like it
[1:24:18] man well so-and-so they just wronged me
[1:24:21] and they just mistreated me
[1:24:22] and now that listen something in you
[1:24:23] will stop that something in you will
[1:24:25] bring this moral body subject say you
[1:24:26] know what i'm going to turn the cheek
[1:24:28] i'm going to pray for those that curse
[1:24:29] me i'm gonna bless those that
[1:24:31] despitefully use me
[1:24:34] listen many of us have been hurt we've
[1:24:35] all been hurt somewhere
[1:24:37] and we go through things that just gnaws
[1:24:39] at us consumes our thinking
[1:24:41] but when this zeal let the zeal be the
[1:24:43] thing that consumes you
[1:24:46] amen david had a desire he said i've got
[1:24:48] one desire
[1:24:50] amen is that right psalm 27 i've got one
[1:24:53] desire is to dwell
[1:24:54] in the house of the lord forever
[1:24:57] hot the natural house the natural temple
[1:24:59] was his zeal
[1:25:01] listen it's a whole other sermon but
[1:25:02] listen this is the reason god made a
[1:25:04] covenant with him
[1:25:05] he wanted to build god a house second
[1:25:07] samuel chapter seven amen he wanted to
[1:25:09] build god a house listen i can't build
[1:25:11] him one but i can get him one
[1:25:12] amen and i can take care of the one he's
[1:25:14] got
[1:25:17] amen praise the lord
[1:25:21] the zeal of this house you think about
[1:25:23] elijah the great
[1:25:24] mount carmel showdown he meets god
[1:25:26] afterwards what does he tell god lord i
[1:25:28] did all this
[1:25:29] because i'm very jealous for the lord of
[1:25:31] hosts
[1:25:32] i'm jealous for the lord of hosts amen i
[1:25:35] believe our elijah this day was such a
[1:25:37] man he was zealous
[1:25:38] for this message because he was jealous
[1:25:40] over this bride amen
[1:25:42] that's what paul you remember preaching
[1:25:43] about jehu here a couple weeks ago
[1:25:45] jehu amen he was a man that was zealous
[1:25:47] because he was jealous for the lord
[1:25:49] because he'd been anointed by that
[1:25:50] prophet amen
[1:25:52] and i thought and i'm not going to reach
[1:25:53] that whole sermon again but you look at
[1:25:55] jehu he's anointed destroyed jezebel
[1:25:57] when he goes to destroy jezebel he
[1:25:59] doesn't renegotiate
[1:26:00] he doesn't stop to to fuss and argue and
[1:26:03] fight about it he just goes and runs
[1:26:04] down everything that gets in his way
[1:26:06] why because they said come up here and
[1:26:08] see my zeal for the lord of hosts
[1:26:10] and then when a man's got a zeal for god
[1:26:12] ain't nothing going to stand in his way
[1:26:14] well praise the lord
[1:26:16] i tell you what you get zealous for a
[1:26:18] rock bane you'll be at every concert you
[1:26:20] get zealous for drugs
[1:26:21] you'll find money if you got a bum for
[1:26:23] it amen but when you get zealous
[1:26:24] for the kingdom of god nobody's gonna
[1:26:26] stop you from serving god
[1:26:28] nobody can stop you from praying amen
[1:26:30] and don't matter if you're the only one
[1:26:32] you'll throw your doors open like daniel
[1:26:34] and pray like you've always prayed
[1:26:36] you'll see god's face when nobody else
[1:26:38] wants to do it amen
[1:26:39] nothing going to stop you
[1:26:43] amen too many people they're playing
[1:26:45] with church hey man
[1:26:46] playing with the world hop in the
[1:26:47] chariot and run over all that nonsense
[1:26:50] it's time to go destroy jezebel it's
[1:26:52] time to show them our zeal amen
[1:26:54] we're here to stand up for an
[1:26:56] everlasting kingdom
[1:26:57] we have received a kingdom that cannot
[1:27:00] be moved
[1:27:01] when everything else that can be shaken
[1:27:04] is being shaken
[1:27:05] in 2021 we have received the one thing
[1:27:08] the one thing that can't be moved we are
[1:27:10] a part of it
[1:27:12] that's why paul could testify none of
[1:27:14] these things move me
[1:27:19] well praise the lord amen oh praise the
[1:27:21] lord
[1:27:22] amen listen jesus
[1:27:25] jesus is jealous for his church listen
[1:27:28] he didn't just go
[1:27:29] collect it from the bargain bin he
[1:27:31] didn't get a good deal on amazon prime
[1:27:33] for you
[1:27:34] he bled for you he suffered for you
[1:27:37] he died for you he sent prophets he sent
[1:27:39] preachers
[1:27:40] he sent his word he sent gifts he'd done
[1:27:42] everything he could do
[1:27:44] listen there's nothing else he could do
[1:27:46] anymore that he's already done
[1:27:48] to testify you were worth it to him
[1:27:51] listen he didn't go up there
[1:27:52] begrudgingly on the cross and say man
[1:27:54] why am i stuck here
[1:27:55] man this is a mistake no he didn't want
[1:27:58] to go there he despised the shame but he
[1:28:00] endured
[1:28:01] why for the joy
[1:28:05] for the joy that was set before him he's
[1:28:07] talking about you
[1:28:09] he's talking about you you are the joy
[1:28:17] jesus was jealous over the people of god
[1:28:20] that's why he wouldn't allow the things
[1:28:23] that were going on in the house of god
[1:28:24] to go on any longer
[1:28:26] hey man i want you to catch this now
[1:28:30] cause we talk about zeal a lot well some
[1:28:32] of us do i guess
[1:28:34] hopefully we talk about zeal we
[1:28:37] as as as american church-going
[1:28:39] christians
[1:28:40] we look at zeal a little bit different
[1:28:42] way than the bible looks at it
[1:28:44] amen we look at zeal as the man that's
[1:28:46] in church and
[1:28:47] he praises god the most and he hey
[1:28:49] praise god
[1:28:50] shouts and praises god and moves around
[1:28:52] oh man he's giving money and he's doing
[1:28:54] this
[1:28:54] oh he's just so zealous i want you to
[1:28:56] notice every example in the bible of a
[1:28:58] man being zealous
[1:28:59] he was mad hey man listen
[1:29:02] listen i tell you what i i guess i got a
[1:29:05] confession to make i'm a little bit of
[1:29:06] an angry person sometimes amen
[1:29:08] because i'm zealous for the lord of
[1:29:09] hosts i'm jealous over god's people amen
[1:29:12] when jehu was asked it made him mad when
[1:29:15] elijah was us that made him met with
[1:29:16] jesus
[1:29:17] listen jesus got mad jesus got mad
[1:29:21] paul got mad about it that because they
[1:29:23] were zealous
[1:29:24] their zeal wasn't tied to how much they
[1:29:26] could shout or dance or move
[1:29:28] it was tied to how their righteous
[1:29:30] indignation was stirred up
[1:29:31] that they would not allow god's bride to
[1:29:34] be manhandled
[1:29:35] amen listen you get a deal for god
[1:29:37] you're going to get angry
[1:29:39] i don't know where we got this this this
[1:29:43] i tell you what we live in a day and age
[1:29:44] or the only person that's not allowed to
[1:29:46] be masculine
[1:29:46] is a man everybody else is allowed to be
[1:29:50] masculine
[1:29:50] but if a man acts like a man we penalize
[1:29:53] him in this country
[1:29:54] oh he's just toxic and he's this and
[1:29:56] that nobody's got a backbone
[1:29:59] and too many men in the church they got
[1:30:00] a wishbone instead of a backbone
[1:30:03] let's throw the wishbone out let's get
[1:30:05] them back bone listen these men that sit
[1:30:07] here and pander to the masses
[1:30:09] they didn't try to play knives they
[1:30:11] stood on the unfailing word of god
[1:30:13] when it cost them their reputation cost
[1:30:15] them influence
[1:30:16] cost them their lives because the
[1:30:18] righteous in the nation would not allow
[1:30:20] them to hold their peace
[1:30:24] praise the lord listen yeah i used this
[1:30:27] example amen
[1:30:29] i said if a man if i was at home today
[1:30:31] and i was in the front yard
[1:30:32] in some white van with no symbols or
[1:30:34] anything on it some white van pulled up
[1:30:36] in front of the yard and they tried to
[1:30:37] take my kids
[1:30:38] or they tried to take my wife i tell you
[1:30:39] what i wouldn't do i wouldn't fold my
[1:30:41] hands and say well i hope they make it
[1:30:43] out
[1:30:44] i hope where they're going to a better
[1:30:46] place oh
[1:30:48] maybe i'll pray for him no i'd walk over
[1:30:50] there and pummel the guy or shoot the
[1:30:51] guy or something
[1:30:53] listen that's my wife that's my kids and
[1:30:55] man it's not because i'm mad or i'm
[1:30:57] trying to hate the guy
[1:30:58] but i i love my wife i love my kids
[1:31:01] i wouldn't let that go on and yet we do
[1:31:03] that in church well the devil come into
[1:31:04] our home
[1:31:05] he'll try to take our prayer life
[1:31:06] they'll try to ruin our church we just
[1:31:08] fold our hands well
[1:31:09] well i just you know i'll be praying for
[1:31:11] him i hope somebody comes along and
[1:31:12] helps him out
[1:31:13] stand up and be a man
[1:31:16] the devil wants to take your devotion
[1:31:18] out of your home stand up and rebuild
[1:31:20] the family altar
[1:31:21] the devil wants to come and take your
[1:31:23] prayer lines get on your knees and pray
[1:31:26] well nobody else in church wants to
[1:31:27] serve god serve god anyhow
[1:31:30] look the devil right in the eye and let
[1:31:33] him know i don't care
[1:31:35] what you have to say about it i don't
[1:31:37] care what you say
[1:31:39] i'm gonna praise him anyway
[1:31:43] man we're gonna wish you ashley it's
[1:31:44] just like this country man man
[1:31:46] we used to shoot people for raising our
[1:31:48] taxes
[1:31:51] it's the truth anyhow no taxation
[1:31:54] without representation
[1:31:55] listen you think your country represents
[1:31:57] you today you're living in a daydream
[1:32:01] that only represents one thing money
[1:32:03] amen
[1:32:05] i'm not here to preach politics but it's
[1:32:07] all faith it's all nonsense
[1:32:09] i think i said this last week but the
[1:32:10] prophet said if abraham lincoln
[1:32:12] and george washington were in every
[1:32:14] county in this country you still
[1:32:15] couldn't bring it back
[1:32:17] it's bought sold and locked out to the
[1:32:19] devil
[1:32:20] [Music]
[1:32:23] but you've got all the men they're all
[1:32:24] like well you know i don't want to hurt
[1:32:25] somebody's feelings
[1:32:27] they won't listen patrick henry and
[1:32:30] george washington
[1:32:31] and paul revere weren't worried if they
[1:32:32] hurt the king of england's feelings
[1:32:34] they'd shoot him and he was there i'm
[1:32:37] not advocating
[1:32:38] physical violence but i'm making a point
[1:32:41] hey man
[1:32:42] listen when you really love something
[1:32:44] and you're really zealous over something
[1:32:45] you'll stand and fight for it you'll die
[1:32:47] if you've got you'll live down your life
[1:32:49] where our lord laid down his life
[1:32:51] for this church and when a man gets god
[1:32:53] on the inside he'll lay down his
[1:32:55] life for the church of god he's got to
[1:32:57] he'll lead on his life for the kingdom
[1:32:59] of god
[1:33:00] because he knows that the kingdom of god
[1:33:01] is greater than any one of us
[1:33:04] your life your purpose your ambition
[1:33:07] it's nothing without the kingdom of god
[1:33:12] well i just don't know about that listen

[1:38:29] ordained us to speak on behalf of those
[1:38:31] that cannot speak

[1:39:51] of you

[1:39:59] you're not here on your own today you're
[1:40:01] representing somebody

[1:40:12] i'm just going to ask him
[1:40:13] no he's got a job to do he represents
[1:40:16] something
[1:40:17] so he's going to exercise some authority
[1:40:19] listen let's exercise some authority in
[1:40:21] our homes
[1:40:22] let's quit negotiating with the anime
[1:40:26] let's stand up and mean business listen
[1:40:28] i'll say it this way
[1:40:30] amen like i said earlier if you're
[1:40:31] jealous over god's people you'll fight
[1:40:33] for them
[1:40:34] you'll have a zeal for them if you don't
[1:40:35] listen i feel that way about my wife my
[1:40:37] kids if you don't feel that way
[1:40:40] there's something wrong with you say it
[1:40:41] that way if you don't feel that way
[1:40:43] there's something wrong with you
[1:40:45] these men felt that way these men elijah
[1:40:48] was upset
[1:40:48] jesus was upset paul was upset phineas
[1:40:51] in the bible was upset
[1:40:53] when he saw the plight of the enemy come
[1:40:54] in they got mad and did something
[1:40:57] amen listen even jesus
[1:41:01] pilate talks to jesus and jesus says if
[1:41:03] my kingdom were of this world
[1:41:04] then my servants would fight amen listen
[1:41:08] he didn't say they can't fight or that
[1:41:09] the pacifist
[1:41:10] he just said they won't fight because
[1:41:12] it's not this world amen so listen
[1:41:14] they do have fight in them there's not
[1:41:16] fight in this world the natural they're
[1:41:18] the weapons of our warfare they're not
[1:41:19] carnal but they are mighty
[1:41:21] listen god's put a sword in your hand
[1:41:23] god has given you armor to do something
[1:41:25] with
[1:41:26] it it's not to polish it and set it on
[1:41:28] the rock
[1:41:29] it's to go find a good fight listen if
[1:41:32] you fight people in the natural for your
[1:41:33] family
[1:41:34] how much more in the supernatural
[1:41:38] listen god's people fight for what's
[1:41:40] right amen
[1:41:42] listen there's all kinds of stuff that
[1:41:43] goes on call itself message
[1:41:46] i was thinking about this i had a
[1:41:47] brother coming years ago
[1:41:50] we were talking about these different
[1:41:51] things that rise up in the message and
[1:41:52] this and that
[1:41:54] and he said brother there seems to be so
[1:41:55] much that it calls up christians says
[1:41:57] how do you tell the difference
[1:41:59] you know the obvious answer is well the
[1:42:00] spirit of god and the word of god but
[1:42:02] he was talking about a certain thing i
[1:42:03] said i said well here's the thing
[1:42:05] brother
[1:42:06] the bible says that knowledge puffeth up
[1:42:09] but love edifies i said so if his
[1:42:13] preaching
[1:42:14] just puffs you up or makes him look
[1:42:15] great or that's all it's for
[1:42:17] that's just knowledge but love will
[1:42:19] edify the here
[1:42:22] why do you say this brother what's your
[1:42:23] point this is what i'm getting at with
[1:42:24] this
[1:42:25] people don't care how much you know they
[1:42:28] want to know how much you care
[1:42:31] we're too busy trying to be right all
[1:42:33] the time like i said the beginning well
[1:42:34] i know the message and i know this and i
[1:42:36] know that people are not impressed by
[1:42:38] how much you know
[1:42:40] but what they want to know is how much
[1:42:41] you care
[1:42:43] by this shall all men know that you're
[1:42:46] my disciples
[1:42:47] that they have love one to another
[1:42:52] amen god give us a message
[1:42:56] to resurrect us out of dark
[1:42:58] denominationalism he give us the spirit
[1:43:00] why now i'm bringing it down home today
[1:43:01] amen
[1:43:02] because where the spirit of the lord is
[1:43:04] there is
[1:43:05] liberty amen god did not come to set us
[1:43:10] free in our sin
[1:43:11] he come to set us free from our sins
[1:43:14] amen it is the glorious liberty the
[1:43:16] bible says the glorious
[1:43:18] liberty of the sons of god that's what
[1:43:21] the message has come to do to give us
[1:43:23] liberty not to
[1:43:24] put us under some other some guy it's to
[1:43:27] set us free to be sons of god
[1:43:29] to be daughters of god amen we have
[1:43:31] liberty
[1:43:32] and paul tells the galatians in the
[1:43:34] fifth chapter
[1:43:35] he warns them stand fast in the liberty
[1:43:39] wherein christ has set you free don't be
[1:43:42] entangled again
[1:43:44] with a yuck of bondage listen god had
[1:43:47] set these galatians free
[1:43:49] and the desire to go back under bondage
[1:43:51] he said don't do that
[1:43:52] stand don't sit there don't wait for
[1:43:55] paul to do it
[1:43:56] you stand in the liberty when god has
[1:43:59] set you free
[1:44:02] you stand for this message you stand for
[1:44:04] the spirit of god
[1:44:05] you stand for that which is right
[1:44:07] because listen there's all kinds of
[1:44:08] people the bible says they promise
[1:44:09] liberty
[1:44:10] the scripture says they promise liberty
[1:44:12] but they are the servants of corruption
[1:44:18] hey man you look at people that they
[1:44:20] leave church they leave the message they
[1:44:21] leave christian whatever
[1:44:23] and they're going on about oh you know
[1:44:25] i'm finally free on this then i'm free
[1:44:26] i'm like man you're more bound than
[1:44:27] you've ever been in your life
[1:44:29] listen i used to be bound that way when
[1:44:31] i was in the world that's why i had no
[1:44:32] desire to go back to egypt
[1:44:34] i've got no desire to live under a task
[1:44:36] master i did that for 24 years of my
[1:44:38] life
[1:44:38] i never want to do it another day of my
[1:44:40] life i'd rather die
[1:44:42] than go back to egypt i'd rather die
[1:44:45] than be a slave another day
[1:44:47] oh i'm so free i'm so this stuff listen
[1:44:49] i know what it's like to be mine
[1:44:51] this message this jesus christ that i'm
[1:44:54] preaching
[1:44:54] he set me free you can lock me up in a
[1:44:58] prison
[1:44:59] you can shove me in a cold cold grave i
[1:45:01] don't care if you lock the key
[1:45:03] lock it up throw away the key i don't
[1:45:05] care if you're burying me
[1:45:06] i'm as free today as i've ever been amen
[1:45:08] i'm the freest man there's ever been
[1:45:10] it doesn't matter whether the outlaw in
[1:45:12] this country what they say about it i've
[1:45:14] got liberty today
[1:45:16] in jesus christ
[1:45:19] stand fast in this liberty i think of
[1:45:22] men
[1:45:23] even the natural i think of this country
[1:45:24] men that suffered and died
[1:45:26] so we could stand here today and have
[1:45:27] freedom of religion i think of a man by
[1:45:29] the name of patrick henry
[1:45:31] stood in saint john's church in virginia
[1:45:33] one day and he stood there a man
[1:45:35] and he told them people is life so dear
[1:45:38] is peace so sweet that we could purchase
[1:45:41] it
[1:45:42] with the price of chains and slavery he
[1:45:44] said forbidden almighty god
[1:45:48] he says i know not what course others
[1:45:50] will take but as for me
[1:45:52] give me liberty or give me death
[1:45:57] i don't know what others will say but as
[1:45:58] for me and my house we will serve the
[1:46:01] lord
[1:46:02] amen give me liberty or give me death
[1:46:05] hey man listen if i feel that way in the
[1:46:07] natural how much more in this
[1:46:09] supernatural way man
[1:46:10] if i listen i'd rather die standing for
[1:46:13] jesus christ
[1:46:14] than to bend the knee to some backslid
[1:46:16] devil somewhere
[1:46:18] amen i bend the knee to only one
[1:46:22] jesus christ and one day everybody's
[1:46:24] gonna bend their knee to him
[1:46:27] i don't bend the knee to satan i don't
[1:46:29] bend the knee a letter to see it
[1:46:30] i don't bend the need of money or women
[1:46:32] or popularity
[1:46:34] amen i only bend my knee to jesus christ
[1:46:37] and if i'm gonna die standing i'd rather
[1:46:39] die
[1:46:40] standing for jesus than live on my knees
[1:46:41] a slave to satan
[1:46:44] amen i'd rather be
[1:46:47] dead than serve the devil another day of
[1:46:50] my life
[1:46:51] i've done that i don't want nothing to
[1:46:52] do with it again death is preferable
[1:46:55] to slavery
[1:46:59] not everybody feels that way that's why
[1:47:00] they live as slaves that's why schanger
[1:47:02] lived that way
[1:47:03] but he got to place one day in his life
[1:47:04] said you know what i'd rather die than
[1:47:06] live this way anymore
[1:47:07] listen you want to serve god you've got
[1:47:08] to die to that old self you've got to
[1:47:10] get a place where you would rather die
[1:47:12] than live as that man
[1:47:13] that's why so many people they're all
[1:47:14] scribbled up in church they still love
[1:47:16] their lives too much
[1:47:18] but jesus said unless you take up your
[1:47:19] cross and you die you can't be my
[1:47:22] disciple listen if you're not willing to
[1:47:24] die for it you're not going to be
[1:47:26] able to live for it
