[1:18] 1.
[1:22] now the feast of unleavened bread drew
[1:25] nigh which is called the passover
[1:28] amen
[1:30] let's just bow our heads for a word of
[1:31] prayer
[1:33] dear lord jesus
[1:35] heavenly father
[1:37] we're counting on you
[1:39] lord you said wherever two or three are
[1:40] gathered in your name lord you'd be in
[1:43] the midst
[1:44] so lord jesus we pray that you'll just
[1:46] reveal yourself to each and every one
[1:49] lord sometimes you can be here and and
[1:51] we miss you
[1:53] the lord we just pray tonight that none
[1:56] will leave but all will say
[1:58] it was good to be in the house of the
[2:00] lord
[2:01] i just pray you'll come and break the
[2:02] bread of life with us lord may you just
[2:05] walk with us lord through your word in
[2:07] jesus christ's name we ask it amen amen
[2:10] you may be seated amen
[2:13] so it's good to see you with your bibles
[2:19] don and i specifically were talking
[2:21] about that the other
[2:22] the other day and uh
[2:25] so
[2:26] we're gonna we're gonna do a little
[2:28] bible study tonight
[2:30] um
[2:31] and
[2:32] and it's gonna particularly be in
[2:34] matthew and luke and mark
[2:37] so it would be to your advantage
[2:40] to follow in your bible
[2:43] when we get there
[2:45] amen so i'd like to speak to you tonight
[2:48] about the last passover
[2:51] amen
[2:52] so we know in the religious world today
[2:55] we're in a most
[2:56] holy week is what they call it
[2:58] because we know that um
[3:01] next sunday or this coming up sunday is
[3:03] easter
[3:05] so that makes friday good friday
[3:08] i don't know why they call it good
[3:12] because they crucified him on that day
[3:15] and so that means last sunday was palm
[3:18] sunday
[3:19] and now we're in that week
[3:22] so
[3:23] a little bit of history
[3:25] the naming of the celebration we call
[3:27] easter easter's nowhere in the bible
[3:30] it's not even in the greek it's not in
[3:32] it's not
[3:35] the word easter goes back to the name of
[3:38] a pre-christian goddess in england
[3:40] esther who was celebrated at the
[3:43] beginning of spring
[3:47] so
[3:48] so easter really is
[3:50] rejoicing over the birth of esther
[3:53] or the birth of spring
[3:56] easter is celebrated on the first sunday
[3:59] after the full moon that occurs on or
[4:02] just after the spring equinox
[4:04] so if the full moon falls on a sunday
[4:06] then easter is on the next sunday
[4:09] so
[4:10] when we look i used to always laugh with
[4:13] my friends at work you know because
[4:16] just think about it we're all born we
[4:17] all have a birthday
[4:19] and if we've ever put somebody in the
[4:21] ground we have a day that we put them in
[4:23] the ground if you go and look at a
[4:24] tombstone it has a birthday
[4:27] and an end it looks a beginning date and
[4:29] an end date
[4:31] so we all know
[4:32] in the religious world jesus was born on
[4:35] the 25th of december right
[4:38] that's when we celebrate him at his
[4:39] birthday
[4:41] what is his death day
[4:46] it moves
[4:49] it moves and the reason it moves is that
[4:51] we're worshiping the birth of the son of
[4:54] the of the of spring
[4:58] the the spring equinox which happened
[5:01] this year
[5:02] um
[5:04] was on march 20th
[5:06] and the equinox is when the earth has
[5:10] the sunlight is the same amount during
[5:12] the day as it is at the night
[5:15] and
[5:16] the nicean council decided that well
[5:19] they wanted to make you know a lot of
[5:21] the pagan things come in to the church
[5:24] let's get you know to get the the
[5:26] unbelievers to become believers
[5:28] so
[5:29] they said they decided that the first
[5:32] full moon that occurs on or after the
[5:35] spring equinox
[5:37] the next sunday will be easter
[5:40] so the full moon for this year
[5:43] after the spring equinox which was on
[5:44] march 20th is this saturday
[5:48] so easter is this sunday
[5:51] so easter
[5:52] can float all the way
[5:55] from
[5:56] march 22nd
[5:58] all the way to april 25th
[6:04] now you think of thanksgiving
[6:05] thanksgiving is what always the third
[6:07] weekend or the third friday thursday and
[6:10] friday
[6:12] of november
[6:13] it's always then so if your argument is
[6:16] well we should we should have a
[6:17] celebration of the resurrection of
[6:19] christ which we should have
[6:22] and
[6:23] if we think why don't we just make it
[6:24] always the third weekend in april
[6:28] but they don't
[6:30] it's based on phases of the moon when i
[6:34] first was talking to a
[6:36] a catholic girl that was a good friend
[6:39] of mine
[6:41] when i told her that she said
[6:43] oh oh she said bruce she says the pope's
[6:45] gonna get you for this
[6:48] and then when we got close because most
[6:50] people even if you look in the
[6:51] newspapers and you look at everything
[6:53] there is nothing talking about the
[6:55] resurrection coming up this weekend
[6:57] lowe's having its spring sale
[7:00] target's having its spring sale
[7:02] everything is about the spring sale it's
[7:04] not about the resurrection of christ
[7:07] but we just believe it
[7:09] and when i think about it this this
[7:12] goddess who turned into diana in
[7:15] different cultures and that is the
[7:16] goddess of fertility
[7:19] and that's why there's eggs just as
[7:20] sister cheryl she told my wife she's
[7:22] getting 20 eggs a day
[7:25] from the chickens the chickens are
[7:27] laying like crazy
[7:28] so a chicken is a thing of of a
[7:31] fertility
[7:33] now i like peeps and i like chocolate
[7:36] candy
[7:38] i like all that stuff but
[7:41] as we progress because most all of us
[7:45] will spend time with our family this
[7:47] weekend
[7:50] it may become something that you
[7:52] be very careful with because you'll get
[7:54] eggs thrown at you
[7:57] but you'll you'll see
[8:00] the world is lost
[8:02] in the book of revelation it said the
[8:04] great she said she has become
[8:07] the she's made the nations of the world
[8:09] drunk with her doctrine her wine
[8:12] and and then her also her commerce
[8:15] and everything is all about generating
[8:17] money you know that's why that's the
[8:19] reason why
[8:20] culver's is having fish fries on friday
[8:22] night
[8:24] this is the only time of the year that
[8:25] culvers and burger king and everybody
[8:28] all they push fish
[8:30] all their commercials all change the
[8:31] fish they get it all on the outside and
[8:34] it's all based
[8:36] on the celebration of easter they want
[8:38] some of that money too
[8:41] amen
[8:44] so i really appreciate the resurrection
[8:48] if we don't have a resurrection on
[8:50] sunday if we don't celebrate the
[8:51] resurrection every day with our lives
[8:53] but you know the res without the
[8:56] resurrection we are totally lost
[8:58] if we don't have the sacrifice that
[9:01] takes place on friday evening we're lost
[9:04] there has to be these things
[9:06] amen so our opening scripture said so so
[9:10] we're going to take a little walk
[9:11] through the bible
[9:12] so it says the feast of unleavened bread
[9:14] drew nigh which is called the passover
[9:17] brother branham preached a message
[9:19] called the indictment and he said he
[9:22] quoted luke 23 33
[9:25] where it says in there it says there
[9:27] they crucified him
[9:29] and brother branham said so there the
[9:31] greatest religious city
[9:33] they
[9:34] the most religious people
[9:36] crucified the most shameful death
[9:40] him
[9:41] the most precious person and that that
[9:44] if that ain't enough to condemn this
[9:46] generation
[9:48] their the most religious organization
[9:50] the biggest of all the churches gathered
[9:52] together in its one place and we're
[9:54] going to see it in the scriptures
[9:56] they the most religious people of all
[9:58] the races the people who were supposed
[10:00] to be the very worshipers of god
[10:04] they gathered in the greatest holy feast
[10:06] that they got the cleansing or the the
[10:08] passover when there was brought from
[10:11] bondage into liberty and there in that
[10:13] time
[10:14] they
[10:15] at that time the most religious people
[10:18] the most religious feast at the most
[10:20] religious place brought upon the prince
[10:23] of life the most shameful thing that
[10:26] could be done to strip a man and hang
[10:28] him on a tree because cursed is he
[10:31] says the law that they worshipped by
[10:34] cursed is he that hangs upon a tree and
[10:37] he was made a curse for us stripping his
[10:40] clothes beating him and mocking him the
[10:43] very god of heaven taking his clothes
[10:46] from him
[10:47] nailing him nailing him to a cross
[10:50] there they crucified him
[10:52] amen
[10:54] amen praise the lord
[10:57] let's start let's look here at saint
[10:59] john 12
[11:01] amen
[11:07] so we're going to read here from verse
[11:09] 1.
[11:11] so we realize
[11:13] we're gonna just
[11:14] walk right into this
[11:17] we know that
[11:18] friday night
[11:20] they're gonna crucify him
[11:23] we know that
[11:24] we know that what happens in the garden
[11:26] the prayers in the garden and and the
[11:28] priests coming and getting him and him
[11:31] going in the judgment hall that happens
[11:33] tomorrow which is thursday
[11:36] but today we're at wednesday
[11:38] so the the scriptures opens up in saint
[11:40] john 12 1 it says then jesus
[11:44] six days before the passover
[11:47] and the passover lamb was going to be
[11:48] sacrificed on friday so six days before
[11:52] that which would have been last saturday
[11:57] he came to bethany
[11:59] where lazarus was which had been dead
[12:02] whom he raised from the dead
[12:04] amen and there they made him a supper
[12:07] and martha served but lazarus was one of
[12:10] them that sat at the table with him
[12:12] and then took mary a pound of ointment
[12:15] of spikard very costly and anointed the
[12:18] feet of jesus and wiped his feet with
[12:20] her hair and the house was filled with
[12:23] the odor of the ointment
[12:25] then saith one of the disciples judas
[12:27] iscariot simon's son which should betray
[12:30] him why was not this ointment sold for
[12:32] 300 pence and given to the poor
[12:35] thus he said not that he cared for the
[12:37] poor but because he was a thief
[12:40] and he had the bag and bare what was put
[12:42] there in
[12:44] then said jesus let her alone against
[12:46] the day of my burying she hath done this
[12:50] for the
[12:51] the poor always you have with you but me
[12:54] you have not always
[12:56] and much people of the jews therefore
[12:58] knew that he was there so this is
[13:00] important
[13:01] here even on saturday this brother
[13:03] branham in the indictment he said it was
[13:06] the greatest religious feast that they'd
[13:09] ever had
[13:11] and we're going to see that in the
[13:12] scriptures
[13:14] so
[13:15] there was many people had all come
[13:18] together
[13:19] pick to lazarus house because they
[13:21] wanted to see this man that had been
[13:23] dead
[13:24] four days
[13:27] four days he'd been dead and he was
[13:29] raised up
[13:30] and many people had come in and seen it
[13:32] and they'd heard about jesus and they
[13:34] heard about him breaking the loaves and
[13:36] the fishes and feeding the five thousand
[13:38] and feeding the four thousand and
[13:39] healing them the halt and then blind and
[13:42] and all these different ones they they
[13:45] saw that and then it attracted them amen
[13:49] so he says much people of the jews
[13:51] therefore knew that he was there and
[13:53] they came not for jesus's sake only but
[13:56] they might see lazarus
[13:58] also whom he had raised from the dead
[14:01] but the chief priests consulted that
[14:04] they might put lazarus
[14:06] also to death because that by the reason
[14:08] of him many of the jews went away and
[14:10] believed on him amen
[14:13] amen
[14:14] i want you to notice there's a very
[14:16] particular thing that happens here at
[14:19] lazarus house
[14:20] dr schofield and if you've got a
[14:22] scofield bible
[14:24] he puts this note in there he says take
[14:26] a look at the three characters
[14:29] you have martha
[14:31] you have lazarus and you have mary
[14:35] you have martha who stands in a type as
[14:38] a servant
[14:39] she's waiting on all of them
[14:42] they've done this meal as a as a re as a
[14:46] respect and out of honor to jesus christ
[14:50] so martha stands and she serves them
[14:53] lazarus is sitting at the table that's
[14:55] what the scripture says
[14:57] and he
[14:58] types the believer who is having
[15:00] communion at the table
[15:02] and mary
[15:03] mary comes in
[15:05] and she's got this alabaster box
[15:08] and she pours it on his feet
[15:11] and she starts
[15:12] to wash his feet and with her tears and
[15:15] also to wipe it with her hair
[15:18] and that shows the real
[15:20] worship of the real believer
[15:23] the real believer comes to his feet and
[15:25] worships him
[15:26] many people came to his feet but all
[15:29] they wanted was something from him
[15:31] they came to his feet and said oh do
[15:33] this for me come to my you know the all
[15:35] this but mary at this meal
[15:39] she types the believer's
[15:41] true worship amen
[15:44] amen praise the lord amen
[15:47] so we see on saturday night
[15:50] jesus
[15:51] is there mary's there martha's there
[15:54] lazarus there the 12 disciples are there
[15:56] there's a great multitude has come in
[15:59] you know and they've all come to see who
[16:01] is this man jesus christ amen
[16:04] so in john's gospel when you get to
[16:07] verse 11 it says because now they're
[16:09] they're talking about how
[16:11] this gathering together even on saturday
[16:15] made the pharisees mad
[16:17] they didn't like it
[16:20] and they said they're going to get
[16:21] together
[16:22] and it says oh it doesn't it didn't even
[16:24] say the pharisees it just says the chief
[16:26] priests
[16:28] consulted how they might put lazarus to
[16:30] death because by reason of its many of
[16:33] the jews went away and believed on jesus
[16:36] verse 12 says on the next day
[16:38] much people that were come to the feast
[16:41] when they heard that jesus was coming to
[16:43] jerusalem
[16:44] remember brother branham said he said it
[16:47] was the most religious people
[16:50] coming to the most religious feast
[16:54] but this feast the next setting of
[16:56] scriptures cannot take place without
[16:59] some very key things happening
[17:02] amen
[17:04] brother branham in the attraction on the
[17:06] mountain he says what is the attraction
[17:08] the attraction is the predestinated seed
[17:11] of god who can't do nothing else but
[17:14] follow the attraction means mortal life
[17:17] to us take our lives but you can't take
[17:20] that what is the attraction
[17:22] god as usual he's fulfilling his word he
[17:26] is fulfilling the word of zachariah
[17:29] again of the prophet zechariah
[17:32] so let's go back here to zechariah 9.
[17:37] amen
[17:44] zachariah 9 verse 9
[17:48] says rejoice greatly o daughter of zion
[17:53] shout o daughter of jerusalem behold thy
[17:56] king cometh unto thee he is just and
[18:00] having salvation
[18:02] lowly and riding upon an ass and upon a
[18:05] cult the fowl of an ass
[18:07] so
[18:10] zachariah gave this prophecy and
[18:12] identified
[18:14] jesus not as a rabbi
[18:17] it doesn't say behold the rabbis coming
[18:21] he said your king's coming
[18:25] your king's coming amen
[18:30] brother branham said he says so he says
[18:32] when i read
[18:34] on the ninth verse as a while ago when
[18:36] jesus entered his temple
[18:38] riding or entered into jerusalem writing
[18:40] on a little white donkey the prophecy
[18:43] was fulfilled
[18:45] that zachariah said here it is rejoice
[18:48] greatly o daughters of zion shout o
[18:50] daughters of jerusalem behold thy king
[18:52] is coming unto thee he is just and
[18:55] having salvation lowly riding upon an
[18:58] ass and upon the cult of the fowl of an
[19:00] ass that's what the attraction was at
[19:03] jerusalem
[19:04] at that religious headquarters
[19:08] amen so let's take a look here
[19:12] at matthew 21.
[19:24] and i'm looking through my bible too so
[19:27] matthew 21 verse 1 says and when they
[19:30] drew nigh unto jerusalem
[19:33] and were come to beth edge unto the
[19:35] mount of olives then sent jesus to
[19:39] disciples
[19:40] so you want to see so saturday they have
[19:43] this feast they have it at lazarus house
[19:46] but jesus had already if the prior
[19:48] scriptures and the other the prior
[19:50] places in the gospels had already said
[19:52] his eyes he was steadfast to go to
[19:56] jerusalem
[19:57] so he stopped off at lazarus house they
[20:00] hang in his on his way
[20:02] to jerusalem and he has to make a stop
[20:06] he has to make a stop
[20:08] look at mark 11 1.
[20:14] so mark 11 1 says
[20:17] and when they came nigh to jerusalem
[20:19] unto beth edge and bethany
[20:21] at the mount of olives
[20:23] so he comes to the mount of olives
[20:26] and then he stops
[20:28] he stops
[20:30] he has to stop at the mount of olives
[20:32] look at luke 19.
[20:34] let's go over there now
[20:37] am i going too fast
[20:39] okay
[20:40] roger says i'm not going too fast so
[20:42] we're all right
[20:46] now we're going to be down at verse 28
[20:49] and when he had thus spoken
[20:52] he went before
[20:54] ascending up to jerusalem
[20:57] and it came to pass when he came nigh to
[20:59] beth edge and bethany at the mount
[21:01] called the mount of olives he sent two
[21:04] of his disciples
[21:06] why
[21:07] why did he stop there
[21:09] brother branham said
[21:11] he said in he says so now he had been
[21:15] a very
[21:17] weary nervous day
[21:19] it was an unusual day
[21:21] and we find jesus here coming up to
[21:23] jerusalem
[21:24] ready to attend the passover and the
[21:27] passover is where the paschal lamb was
[21:29] to be killed and the blood would be
[21:31] spread upon the mercy seat for the
[21:33] atonement of the people
[21:35] and he had come to from bethage and had
[21:39] come to the top of the mount of olives
[21:41] which looks down upon another little
[21:43] hill where jerusalem was built and as he
[21:46] looked he know that this was his final
[21:49] visit
[21:51] now john john records
[21:54] he he just goes he says okay the priest
[21:57] got all mad
[21:58] the next day he's on the donkey
[22:02] but there's something that god has to do
[22:04] here
[22:05] we're starting at verse 29 in luke
[22:08] 19 verse 29
[22:10] he says and it came to pass as he was
[22:12] nigh to bethage in bethany at the mount
[22:15] called the mount of olives he sent two
[22:17] of his disciples
[22:18] saying go ye into the village over
[22:21] against you and the witch that you're
[22:23] entering in you shall find a colt tide
[22:26] whereon yet never a man set loose him
[22:29] and bring him here
[22:31] and if any man ask you why do you loose
[22:33] him
[22:34] thus show you saying to him because the
[22:37] lord hath need of him
[22:38] and they that were sent went their way
[22:41] and found even as he had said unto them
[22:44] and as they were loosing the cold the
[22:46] owners thereof said unto them
[22:49] why lucie the cold
[22:51] and they said the lord hath need of him
[22:54] and they brought him to jesus and they
[22:56] cast their garments upon the cult and
[22:58] they sent jesus thereon
[23:01] so i want to read all three of these
[23:02] before i
[23:04] tell you let's go back now to luke 11.
[23:08] you'll notice that
[23:10] mark 11
[23:12] in in luke 19
[23:14] he doesn't talk about
[23:16] the the donkey
[23:17] and the fool of the donkey
[23:20] but zechariah was very specific
[23:24] he was very specific
[23:26] in mark 11
[23:32] it says
[23:33] um we started verse
[23:35] and when they came nigh to jerusalem
[23:37] unto beth edge and bethany at the mount
[23:39] of olives he sent forth two of his
[23:41] disciples
[23:43] and he said unto them
[23:45] go your way into the village over
[23:46] against you and as soon as you be
[23:49] entered into it you should find a cold
[23:51] tide whereupon never a man set loose him
[23:55] and bring him
[23:56] and if any man say unto you why do you
[23:58] do this
[24:00] say ye that the lord hath need of him
[24:02] and straightway he will send him here
[24:05] and they went their way and they found
[24:06] the cult tied by the door without in a
[24:10] place where two ways meet and they loose
[24:12] him
[24:13] and certain of them that stood there
[24:15] said unto them what do you
[24:17] loosen the coal
[24:19] and they said unto them
[24:20] even as jesus had commanded and they let
[24:23] them go
[24:24] and they brought the cult to jesus and
[24:27] cast their garments on him and he sat
[24:29] upon him
[24:30] amen
[24:32] so let's go to matthew 21
[24:36] and see how matthew records this
[24:43] matthew 21 starting with verse 1.
[24:46] so he says and when they drew nyan to
[24:48] jerusalem and they had come to beth edge
[24:50] unto the mount of olives then sent jesus
[24:53] two disciples
[24:55] so you notice that in all three of these
[24:58] when they got to the mount of olives
[25:00] jesus stopped
[25:03] jesus stopped
[25:06] he turned to two of his disciples and he
[25:08] said
[25:09] i want you to go into a city
[25:12] i want you to take a little walk
[25:14] i want you to go down there
[25:17] and well let's go to verse two it says
[25:19] so saying unto them go into the village
[25:22] over against you
[25:23] and straightway you shall find an ass
[25:25] tide and a cult with her loose them and
[25:29] bring them unto me
[25:32] matthew sees that there's two
[25:36] and if any men say odd unto you
[25:39] you shall say the lord hath need of them
[25:41] and straightway he will send them
[25:44] and all of this was done
[25:47] that it might be fulfilled which was
[25:49] spoken by the prophet saying
[25:51] tell ye the daughter of zion behold thy
[25:55] king cometh unto thee meek and sitting
[25:58] on an ass and the colt the fowl of an
[26:01] ass and the disciples went and did as
[26:04] jesus commanded them
[26:05] and brought the ass and the colt both of
[26:08] them
[26:09] and put their clothes
[26:12] on them
[26:13] and they said him
[26:14] aren't there on they said him thereon
[26:18] jesus comes up
[26:20] to
[26:25] brother branham and things that are to
[26:27] be says god in the beginning
[26:30] being the infinite god he is he is
[26:32] infinite
[26:33] rather and we're finite
[26:36] his mind is so much greater and we in
[26:38] our little finite minds we can't
[26:40] understand his great infinite wisdom
[26:44] his ways are past finding out
[26:48] but therefore
[26:50] when he speaks anything it may seem very
[26:52] strange to us
[26:54] to hear him say a certain thing in the
[26:56] scripture but then it's got to happen
[26:59] i believe that his words will never pass
[27:02] away
[27:02] and therefore i believe that god knowing
[27:04] that we are in our own little finite
[27:06] minds and we cannot interpret his his
[27:10] great mind
[27:11] he interprets his own word then
[27:14] he doesn't need any interpreter he
[27:16] interprets his own word by vindicating
[27:19] that word in its season
[27:22] after zechariah prophesied there was
[27:25] many
[27:26] men
[27:28] who thought they could buy a a donkey
[27:32] and then have a fall of a donkey
[27:34] and place any religious leader
[27:38] on it
[27:39] and say behold your king
[27:42] but that would not have been zechariah's
[27:45] prophecy
[27:47] because god's word has to be fulfilled
[27:50] in its season
[27:51] at its right time
[27:53] brother branham says we can't even
[27:55] comprehend god's ways of doing things
[27:59] so jesus being the word of god
[28:02] when he came up to the mount of olives
[28:05] he could have walked all the way into
[28:06] jerusalem but the word of god
[28:09] constrained him
[28:13] the word of god
[28:15] zechariah one day when he was out and
[28:17] he's maybe he's at church maybe he's in
[28:19] the parking lot i don't know exactly
[28:21] where he was at but the spirit of god
[28:23] fell on zechariah and he prophesied
[28:27] and when he prophesied the thoughts of
[28:29] god was now being revealed
[28:33] but the word being spoke is not the same
[28:36] as the word being fulfilled
[28:39] so the word was spoken by zechariah the
[28:42] prophet
[28:44] jesus being the god prophet
[28:48] they went to him many times and said why
[28:50] isn't this one healed why don't you do
[28:52] this why don't you go over here if
[28:53] you're this or that you know like the
[28:55] devil took him to the top of the of the
[28:57] temple and he showed him he says look he
[28:58] says if you're the son of god he says
[29:01] just cast yourself down doesn't the word
[29:03] say that your feet will not dash against
[29:05] a stone that angels will lift you up
[29:08] he said aren't you hungry turn these
[29:10] stones into bread
[29:13] jesus had the power to do that because
[29:14] he took two loaves and five fishes
[29:17] and fed five thousand so he could have
[29:19] done that
[29:22] but he said no
[29:25] the word of god has to be fulfilled in
[29:28] its season in its time
[29:32] jesus said he said i can do nothing
[29:34] unless the father shows me first
[29:39] amen
[29:42] so jesus saw a vision
[29:46] and he picked two of his disciples
[29:49] and the disciples being men who didn't
[29:52] understand god in their midst
[29:55] they weren't converted yet
[29:58] they never understood jesus he was a
[30:00] mystery to them
[30:02] they they
[30:04] here they are there's two brothers
[30:06] he calls them aside he said this is what
[30:08] i want you to do
[30:10] i want you to go into a city
[30:13] i want you to go this city over here
[30:14] it's near us
[30:16] he says when you get to the city he says
[30:19] you will find a cult
[30:21] and the foul you'll find a donkey in a
[30:23] in its offspring you will find them tied
[30:26] up
[30:27] and he says and when you find them i
[30:29] want you to loose them
[30:31] and bring them here
[30:33] and he says and he says if anybody comes
[30:36] up to you
[30:38] and asks you why are you doing this
[30:41] this is what you should tell them
[30:44] the lord hath need of these
[30:47] and straightway
[30:49] they will let you come
[30:53] these brothers only had jesus's words
[30:58] that's all they had
[31:00] but jesus had the mind of the father
[31:04] and when they started to walk
[31:06] and they walked into the city and found
[31:09] the cult just exactly like he said
[31:13] they started walking right into the
[31:16] thoughts of god
[31:17] and god's thoughts were now being
[31:19] manifested
[31:21] by these men
[31:22] and when they got to the cult you'll
[31:24] notice that the one
[31:26] gospel evangelist that's what they call
[31:29] him
[31:30] mark said he says he found him at the
[31:32] corner of two ways
[31:35] belief
[31:36] faith and unbelief
[31:39] because when they got to the cult they
[31:41] must have said wow this is this is
[31:43] exactly what he told us
[31:46] and now they're they're in between
[31:48] because the owner of the cult comes out
[31:50] and says hey hey hey hey you know what
[31:52] are you doing
[31:54] and now they're going to make up their
[31:55] mind
[31:57] god won't ever reveal anything to you
[31:59] that won't bring you to a place of
[32:01] decision
[32:03] where you have to make up your mind
[32:05] are you going to believe the word of god
[32:07] or are you going to walk away from it
[32:09] they could have said well
[32:11] well i'm sorry i didn't mean it i didn't
[32:12] mean it bye maybe i misunderstood maybe
[32:14] i didn't maybe i didn't get the message
[32:16] right you know and they could have left
[32:19] but they said no
[32:21] he told us what to say
[32:25] and when they said exactly what jesus
[32:27] told them what to say
[32:30] the men said
[32:31] god bless you
[32:33] and they took the cult and the foul
[32:37] they took them and they brought them
[32:39] back to jesus
[32:41] and they put the things they put their
[32:43] garments on them
[32:45] and now
[32:46] zachariah zechariah's prophecy
[32:50] could be fulfilled
[32:52] because now jesus is at the mount of
[32:54] olives jerusalem's the next mountain
[32:56] down
[32:57] and zechariah's prophecy said behold thy
[33:01] king cometh
[33:02] riding on a donkey
[33:04] and the fall of a donkey
[33:07] and he said rejoice saying hosanna in
[33:11] the highest amen
[33:14] and he could not move until all those
[33:17] scriptural things were in their right
[33:19] place amen
[33:21] praise the lord
[33:22] praise the lord
[33:25] brother branham said see it may be
[33:26] strange to us to hear him say a certain
[33:29] thing in the scripture but you see it's
[33:31] got to happen and i believe that his
[33:33] word will never pass away therefore i
[33:36] believe that god knowing that we are
[33:39] with our little finite minds and we
[33:41] cannot interpret his great mind
[33:44] he will interpret his own word he
[33:46] doesn't need any interpreter he'll
[33:48] interpret his own word by vindicating
[33:50] that word in its season
[33:53] praise the lord
[33:55] so in matthew 21 because that's what
[33:57] we're at
[33:58] let's continue on
[34:00] so in verse seven it says and they
[34:02] brought the ass and the colt and put him
[34:04] on
[34:05] set their um put on them their clothes
[34:08] and they sent him there on and a great
[34:10] multitude spread their garments in the
[34:12] way and others cut down branches from
[34:15] the trees and strawed them in the way
[34:17] and the multiple two that went before
[34:20] and that followed cried saying hosanna
[34:23] to the son of david blessed is he that
[34:25] cometh in the name of the lord hosanna
[34:28] in the highest
[34:29] and when he was coming to jerusalem all
[34:32] the city was moved saying who is this
[34:37] because whenever jesus comes around
[34:39] you have the elect
[34:41] you have the unbelievers you have the
[34:43] make-believers everybody the whole city
[34:46] was moved when they heard all this noise
[34:48] and him coming down the mount
[34:51] and there are the religious leaders
[34:52] standing there watching him and he's
[34:54] coming down and everybody is screaming
[34:57] saying hosanna to the
[34:59] glory to god in heaven amen
[35:02] because
[35:04] zachariah said they said oh this is the
[35:06] son of david which is the king and they
[35:08] knew that was the king
[35:10] and he was coming down
[35:12] to
[35:12] the passover
[35:14] amen
[35:17] amen
[35:19] let's take a look at mark 11. so we read
[35:21] matthew 21 let's see how mark 11
[35:24] talks about the same thing
[35:27] mark 11 starting at verse 8
[35:33] and many spread their garments in the
[35:34] way and others cut down the branches of
[35:37] the tree and straw them in the way and
[35:40] they that went before and they that
[35:41] followed cried saying hosanna blessed is
[35:45] he that cometh in the name of the lord
[35:47] blessed be the kingdom of our father
[35:49] david that cometh in the name of the
[35:51] lord hosanna in the highest and jesus
[35:54] entered into jerusalem and straight away
[35:58] went into the temple
[36:00] and when he had looked around and bound
[36:02] upon all things
[36:04] he came down he went directly he didn't
[36:07] go to the palace he didn't go to where
[36:09] herod was
[36:11] he went to where his throne was
[36:15] he went down there
[36:17] and you'll notice
[36:18] that in mark
[36:20] he just quotes
[36:22] the people that are saying hosanna
[36:24] blessed be the name of the lord
[36:27] matthew
[36:28] quotes the make-believers
[36:31] because they don't know who he is
[36:34] they go who is he
[36:36] who is this guy
[36:39] and of course the pharisees the
[36:40] sadducees and herodians and all the
[36:42] denominations they didn't know who he
[36:43] was anyway so
[36:45] so let's go here to luke let's look at
[36:48] luke 19.
[36:50] praise the lord
[36:55] amen
[36:58] so in luke 19
[37:00] starting with um
[37:02] verse 36 well let's start with verse 35
[37:06] and they brought him they brought the
[37:08] colt and the fowl
[37:10] the the
[37:11] the baby they brought him to jesus and
[37:13] they set their garments upon the colt
[37:15] and they led jesus there on and as he
[37:17] went they spread their clothes in the
[37:19] way and when he was come nigh even now
[37:22] to the descent of the mount of olives
[37:24] you see why he had to stop
[37:29] he had to stop right there
[37:32] he had to be at the right place at the
[37:35] right time the word of god has to be
[37:38] fulfilled
[37:39] amen
[37:41] and it says when he started to descend
[37:44] out of the mount of olives the whole
[37:46] multitude of the disciples began to
[37:49] rejoice and praise god with a loud voice
[37:51] for all the mighty works that they had
[37:53] seen saying blessed be the king that
[37:56] cometh in the name of the lord peace in
[37:58] heaven and glory in the highest
[38:01] and
[38:02] the unbelievers some of the pharisees
[38:05] which were among the multitudes said
[38:07] unto him master rebuke your disciples
[38:12] tell them to be quiet
[38:15] you see in all three of these
[38:17] different settings in the bible you see
[38:19] a different set of people
[38:22] they're all worshiping god but some are
[38:24] saying i don't know who he is who is he
[38:27] the pharisees and sadducees and they're
[38:29] going no no no this is this you
[38:31] know you shouldn't be like this out
[38:33] outside of the temple you shouldn't even
[38:35] do this telling them to be quiet and
[38:39] jesus answered and said unto them i tell
[38:41] you that if they should hold their peace
[38:44] the stones would immediately cry out
[38:47] amen praise the lord
[38:49] amen
[38:52] amen
[38:56] and go tell my disciples when jesus came
[38:58] walking into jerusalem and they cut down
[39:00] the palms and they begin to scream and
[39:02] cry and carry on like that some of those
[39:04] starchy pharisees they said make them
[39:06] hold their peace why they give us the
[39:08] shivers oh how them people are screaming
[39:10] and carrying on and he said to them he
[39:13] says if they hold their peace the rocks
[39:15] will immediately cry out something has
[39:17] to come when life comes amongst death
[39:21] there is a resurrection there's bound to
[39:23] be amen
[39:25] so when jesus come down the mount the
[39:27] believers got fired up because they saw
[39:30] the word of god being made manifest
[39:33] amen the make-believer said i don't get
[39:36] it
[39:37] the pharisees said i get it he's not
[39:39] right
[39:41] they saw it right away amen praise the
[39:44] lord
[39:46] and who do you say this is brother
[39:48] brethren says so now watch
[39:50] now here he comes writing into the city
[39:52] and just exactly what the word said he
[39:54] would do
[39:55] riding on a little donkey coming into
[39:57] the city and those who were not looking
[40:00] at the creed and not looking at the
[40:02] temple not looking at these other things
[40:04] not looking at the priests whatever they
[40:06] had to say those that believed him they
[40:08] were standing there with their palm on
[40:10] their
[40:11] in their hand just
[40:12] waiting the first move you never heard
[40:15] them say who is this
[40:17] no
[40:18] because they knew who he was
[40:20] they knew what the word said and the
[40:22] other class you see them back there in
[40:24] the city and then when they heard the
[40:26] noise hosanna to the king hosanna to the
[40:28] king that comes in the name of the lord
[40:30] hosanna hosanna and all the screaming
[40:32] and the priests run out there to see
[40:34] what the religious commotion was all
[40:36] about and the people said who is this
[40:39] what
[40:40] what were they there for friends
[40:42] they had all come together for a
[40:44] religious feast the very god that had
[40:48] them to ordain this feast told him that
[40:51] he was going to come to the feast
[40:56] and they didn't know
[40:57] who he was
[41:02] they didn't know
[41:05] amen
[41:08] now we're still in luke right
[41:10] so if you look at luke 19 so in verse 40
[41:14] and he answered and so he's speaking to
[41:16] the pharisees to the unbelievers
[41:18] i tell you that if these should hold
[41:20] their peace
[41:21] the stones would immediately cry out
[41:25] and when he was come near he's still
[41:28] coming down out of the mount of olives
[41:31] as he comes down and approaches
[41:33] jerusalem
[41:35] and he sees the city
[41:37] he weeps
[41:38] saying if thou hast known even thou at
[41:42] least in this thy day
[41:44] the things which belong unto thy peace
[41:47] but now they are hid from thine eyes
[41:51] because they could not place the word of
[41:53] god in its rightful place
[41:57] and because they rejected him as a king
[42:01] look what he says in verse 43 he says
[42:03] for the day shall come upon thee that
[42:05] thine enemies shall cast a trench about
[42:08] thee encompass thee round and keep thee
[42:10] in on every side and shall lay thee even
[42:13] with the ground and thy children within
[42:16] thee and they shall not leave in thee
[42:18] one stone upon another because thou
[42:21] knewest not the time of thy visitation
[42:25] amen
[42:27] amen
[42:28] they couldn't see it
[42:30] blessed are your eyes for you see
[42:34] praise the lord amen
[42:36] amen
[42:38] so
[42:39] um
[42:42] so look at what happened so he's he's
[42:44] coming down he's coming down off the
[42:46] mount of olives and now he gets to verse
[42:48] 45 and where does he go he goes right
[42:52] into the temple
[42:54] and when he gets to the temple because
[42:55] remember we read the out of the
[42:57] scripture i believe it was in mark
[42:59] and it said when he got there he got to
[43:02] jerusalem he went to the temple
[43:04] he looked around
[43:06] and he left
[43:08] but the scriptures here says when he
[43:11] went to the temple
[43:12] and he began to cast them out that sold
[43:15] therein and them that bought
[43:18] saying unto them it is written my house
[43:21] is the house of prayer but you have made
[43:23] it a den of thieves
[43:25] and he taught daily in the temple but
[43:28] the chief priests and the scribes and
[43:30] the chief of the people sought to
[43:32] destroy him
[43:33] you know when the word of god is being
[43:35] made manifest people that don't
[43:38] agree the pharisees didn't agree with
[43:41] the sadducees they didn't agree with the
[43:43] herodians
[43:44] they didn't agree with the scribes they
[43:47] didn't agree but when they saw jesus and
[43:49] the influence that the word of god had
[43:51] when it was made manifest they could all
[43:54] come together and agree on one thing
[43:57] we're getting rid of this guy
[43:59] we've got to get rid of him
[44:01] amen
[44:03] praise the lord amen
[44:08] and they could not find a um but the
[44:10] chief priests and the scribes and the
[44:12] chief of the people sought to destroy
[44:14] him and could not find
[44:16] what they might do for all the people
[44:19] were very attentive to hear him
[44:22] so how far have we come
[44:24] we know that saturday he went down to
[44:26] bethany and he was at lazarus house
[44:30] this is the very next day
[44:33] this is just sunday
[44:35] and he's already caused all this
[44:36] commotion
[44:38] and when he gets to the temple the very
[44:40] first thing is he cleans it out but the
[44:42] bible says that he's continue
[44:45] in the temple teaching
[44:48] daily
[44:51] so now you got
[44:52] monday he's teaching
[44:54] tuesdays he's teaching
[44:56] wednesday he's teaching
[44:58] he stays there right
[45:00] amen
[45:02] praise the lord let's take a look at
[45:04] what
[45:06] mark 11 says about this thing
[45:09] amen
[45:13] hopefully
[45:15] you're seeing a nice picture
[45:18] praise the lord
[45:28] mark 11
[45:29] starting at verse 15.
[45:33] and you'll see here
[45:35] and they came to jerusalem and jesus
[45:37] went into the temple and began to cast
[45:40] out them that sold and bought in the
[45:41] temple and overthrew the tables of the
[45:43] money changers and the seats of them
[45:45] that sold doves and would not suffer
[45:48] that any man should carry any vessel
[45:50] through the temple
[45:51] and he taught saying unto them it is it
[45:54] not written my house shall be called of
[45:57] all nations the house of prayers but you
[45:59] have made it into a den of thieves and
[46:01] the scribes and the chief priests heard
[46:03] it and they sought how they might
[46:04] destroy him for they feared him because
[46:07] all the people were astonished at his
[46:10] doctrine
[46:11] and when even was come he went out of
[46:14] the city
[46:15] amen
[46:16] amen so every night we're going to see
[46:19] in the scriptures that every night so he
[46:22] went in on sunday he came down
[46:25] he came riding in on on the donkey and
[46:28] we and he he went and he went straight
[46:31] to the temple and when he got to the
[46:33] temple
[46:34] he cleaned the place up
[46:36] and then he went back out to lazarus
[46:38] house
[46:39] then he comes back the next day and he's
[46:41] teaching in the temple and then he goes
[46:43] back out to lazarus house and then he
[46:45] comes back and he teaches in the temple
[46:48] and then he goes back to lazarus house
[46:50] because you'll see that in every one of
[46:51] these scriptures he always goes back to
[46:53] bethany and beth edge amen
[46:57] praise the lord
[47:01] so we read mark so let's take a look at
[47:03] matthew 21
[47:06] amen
[47:12] matthew 21 starting with verse 12.
[47:19] and jesus went into the temple of god
[47:22] and cast out all of them that sold and
[47:23] bought in the temple and overthrew the
[47:26] tables of the money changers and the
[47:27] seats of them that sold doves and he
[47:29] said unto them it is written my house
[47:31] should be called the house of prayer but
[47:33] you have made it a den of thieves and
[47:36] the blind and the lame came to him in
[47:37] the temple and he healed them
[47:39] see he was even doing healing services
[47:41] in the temple praise the lord
[47:44] praise the lord amen
[47:46] and when the chief priests and the
[47:47] scribes saw these wonderful things oh
[47:49] they got really mad and the children
[47:51] crying in the temple saying hosanna to
[47:53] the son of david
[47:54] they were so displeased
[47:58] amen
[48:00] they were not happy with that
[48:03] and they said unto him hearst now what
[48:04] these people are saying
[48:06] and jesus said unto them yea have you
[48:08] never read out of the mouth of babes and
[48:10] sucklings that was perfected phrase
[48:12] praise
[48:13] and he left them and went out of the
[48:16] city into bethany and he lodged there
[48:20] you see
[48:21] so he keeps going back out
[48:25] so he comes out
[48:27] and remember that when he came to
[48:29] jerusalem
[48:30] at this feast
[48:33] was the only time that he came to
[48:35] jerusalem
[48:36] as behold thy king
[48:41] before he came as rabbi
[48:43] before he came as you know some other
[48:46] office
[48:47] but when zachariah prophesied
[48:50] said behold thy king
[48:52] and the king came
[48:55] malachi 3 verse 1 says and the king will
[48:58] suddenly appear at the temple
[49:03] he will come suddenly
[49:06] and the king came
[49:09] and the king came and judged the temple
[49:14] and what did he find
[49:17] did he find a house of prayer a place of
[49:19] worship
[49:20] did he find what the temple in jerusalem
[49:23] was supposed to be
[49:24] i will only meet you in the place where
[49:27] my name is
[49:29] that was that was the promise to solomon
[49:31] and everybody else you know jonah when
[49:34] jonah said i will now turn my eyes
[49:36] towards thy holy temple and when i pray
[49:39] you'll hear me and when jesus the king
[49:42] came on the donkey and he fulfilled the
[49:44] scriptures and he came in and he came
[49:47] and he looked around he said this is not
[49:50] what my word said it should be
[49:54] and he left he cleaned it out and then
[49:56] he left
[49:59] and verse 17 so we're still in matthew
[50:04] and he and he left them and he went out
[50:06] of the city into bethany and he lodged
[50:09] there
[50:10] now in the morning and we don't know
[50:12] whether it's monday or tuesday or
[50:14] wednesday
[50:15] but we know it was morning
[50:19] and when it was morning he returned into
[50:21] the city he was a hungered
[50:23] and when he saw a fig tree in the way
[50:26] he came to it and found nothing there on
[50:29] but leaves only
[50:31] and he said unto it let no fruit grow on
[50:34] thee henceforth forever and presently
[50:37] the fig tree withered away
[50:40] amen
[50:42] amen
[50:44] i want you to look at mark
[50:47] uh no i got here i suppose all right
[50:49] let's
[50:50] and when the disciples saw it they
[50:51] marveled saying how soon is the fig tree
[50:53] withered away
[50:55] and jesus answered and said unto them
[50:56] verily i say unto you if you have faith
[50:59] and doubt not it shall not only do this
[51:02] which is done to the fig tree but also
[51:04] if you shall say unto this mountain be
[51:05] thou removed and be thou cast into the
[51:08] sea it shall be done and all things
[51:10] whatsoever you shall ask in prayer
[51:12] believing you shall receive
[51:15] amen
[51:17] but why is he picking on the fig tree
[51:22] at mark 11.
[51:25] amen
[51:27] amen mark 11
[51:32] verse 12.
[51:35] now
[51:36] mark the way he records this
[51:39] is different than the way matthew
[51:41] recorded it
[51:43] because verse 11
[51:46] says and jesus entered into jerusalem
[51:48] and into the temple and when he had
[51:49] looked around about
[51:51] upon all things and now it was evening
[51:53] time
[51:55] he went out onto bethany with the twelve
[51:57] and on the morrow
[51:59] when they were come from bethany he was
[52:01] hungry and seeing a fig tree afar off
[52:04] having leaves he came if happily he
[52:06] might find anything thereon and when he
[52:09] came to it he found nothing but leaves
[52:12] for the times of figs was not yet
[52:14] and jesus answered and said unto it no
[52:17] man eat fruit of thee hereafter forever
[52:20] and his disciples heard it and look what
[52:23] he does
[52:24] he goes to the jerusalem
[52:27] goes to the temple
[52:30] and what does he find
[52:34] a fig tree with no fruit
[52:41] let's go to luke 21
[52:45] amen
[52:49] luke 21
[52:52] verse 29
[52:54] and he said he spake to them a parable
[52:56] saying behold the fig
[52:58] tree and all the other trees
[53:03] but the fig tree
[53:05] was his
[53:06] his bride
[53:09] israel is my firstborn
[53:12] israel
[53:13] this is my people that's who the fig
[53:16] tree is
[53:17] the fig trees jerusalem the fig tree is
[53:21] israel
[53:22] fig tree is abraham's children that's
[53:24] who i'm coming for
[53:26] i'm your king don't you know who i am
[53:30] and when you come to the fig tree look
[53:31] at what jesus says he says behold the
[53:33] fig tree
[53:35] and now
[53:36] when it when it now shall shoot
[53:38] forth you see and know it is your own
[53:40] selves that summer is now nigh at hand
[53:43] so likewise when you see these things
[53:46] come to pass
[53:47] know that the kingdom of god is nigh at
[53:49] hand
[53:50] when
[53:52] what did jesus say he told him he says
[53:54] when he lamented over israel right they
[53:58] rejected him as king and he said if
[54:00] you'd have recognized the day of your
[54:02] visitation
[54:05] it would have been well with you
[54:08] it would have been well with you if i
[54:10] came and you hadn't desecrated the
[54:13] temple
[54:14] amen
[54:17] the leaves on a fig tree
[54:20] indicate that summer was nigh and that
[54:22] fruit might be reasonably expected
[54:26] especially since a fig tree bears fruit
[54:30] before
[54:31] leaves
[54:39] why don't you just shrivel up the vine
[54:42] i mean right
[54:44] i am the vine you're the branches isn't
[54:45] that that's not figs
[54:47] that's a wine
[54:49] grapes
[54:51] so when he came down to jerusalem why
[54:53] didn't he say oh look there's there's a
[54:54] vineyard here oh and there's no grapes
[54:59] when he comes down off the mountain and
[55:00] he and he goes out he comes back
[55:04] matthew said when he came in he looked
[55:06] around and he said i cannot believe you
[55:09] call this my house
[55:11] and he walks out he comes back he cleans
[55:15] the place out he walks out he comes back
[55:18] sees the fig tree
[55:21] and because it's got leaves on it he's
[55:24] expecting fruit on his tree
[55:28] and when he comes and he looks and he
[55:30] sees there's no more fruit
[55:32] he already knows he's been judged
[55:35] unworthy of his kingship
[55:38] he rejects israel right there
[55:45] amen
[55:47] praise the lord
[55:49] amen
[55:52] when you go back and look at this you'll
[55:53] see that mark
[55:55] splits the death of the tree
[55:57] between the entry and the cleansing of
[56:00] the temple
[56:02] matthew just kind of puts it in there
[56:07] he puts it in there amen
[56:09] amen praise the lord
[56:12] and when he curses the fig tree he goes
[56:15] back in and you know his message kind of
[56:18] changed after the fig tree died
[56:20] because he went and if you go and take
[56:22] him we're not going to do it tonight but
[56:24] you go home tonight
[56:25] tomorrow and now you probably got good
[56:27] friday off
[56:31] you should have good friday off because
[56:32] it's a good friday right
[56:34] but see the world doesn't even believe
[56:36] in easter anymore
[56:38] we just we're just thinking about bunny
[56:40] rabbits and cadbury eggs and and you
[56:43] know kit kat candy bars and and peeps
[56:46] love peeps
[56:48] you know you're just thinking about all
[56:50] these things but brother and sister this
[56:52] is supposed to be the the time for us to
[56:54] worship god because god is getting ready
[56:57] to fulfill his word amen
[56:59] amen and we only got to wednesday
[57:03] it started
[57:04] on saturday
[57:06] he started on saturday at lazarus house
[57:09] and i'm showing you he came up the very
[57:11] next day the scripture says it very next
[57:14] day very next day very next day
[57:18] it says there in in john 12 he says six
[57:21] days before the passover which is
[57:24] thursday right
[57:26] and they killed the lamb on friday
[57:29] amen
[57:31] amen praise the lord amen
[57:34] judgment's preached
[57:36] jesus's authority is questioned and if
[57:38] you go and look at all the scriptures
[57:40] you start with with matthew 26 and read
[57:43] the next couple of chapters
[57:45] the very first thing that the the
[57:48] religious leaders they all band together
[57:51] oh they couldn't agree on anything
[57:53] before the god had ah baptism they can't
[57:56] agree on nothing
[57:57] but once jesus started to do the things
[58:00] that he did
[58:01] oh okay yeah
[58:04] we can we can get together on this guy
[58:07] he's a little bit too much for our taste
[58:09] amen
[58:11] he rebuked all the religions in
[58:13] jerusalem it's in matthew mark luke john
[58:16] every one of them right after palm
[58:19] sunday
[58:21] going look
[58:23] right after palm sunday he's preaching
[58:26] judgment judgment judgment judgment
[58:29] judgment because they rejected him as he
[58:32] came down out of the mount of olives
[58:35] because they rejected him as their king
[58:38] amen because they rejected him as
[58:41] malachi 3 saying behold thy king will
[58:45] suddenly appear at his temple
[58:47] amen
[58:49] amen
[58:50] and also in all that time when he's
[58:52] preaching those things he starts
[58:54] preaching about the gentiles and what
[58:56] they're going to do and the gentile
[58:58] kingdoms and everything else amen
[59:01] amen
[59:03] praise god
[59:04] praise the lord amen
[59:07] amen let's go to matthew 26
[59:10] amen
[59:15] so now
[59:17] during this short time
[59:22] matthew 26 verse 1
[59:27] amen
[59:32] look at how this is written
[59:34] verse one it says and it came to pass
[59:36] when jesus had finished all these
[59:38] sayings he said unto his disciples
[59:40] you know that after two days is the
[59:43] feast of the passover
[59:48] so it's today
[59:51] he tells them today's the day guys
[59:56] and the son of man is betrayed to be
[59:58] crucified you remember when i read that
[1:00:00] quote brother branham said our finite
[1:00:01] minds can't understand god
[1:00:04] we can't figure him out at all
[1:00:06] he's telling them exactly what's going
[1:00:10] to happen
[1:00:12] and they didn't believe him
[1:00:16] even when they were running away and
[1:00:17] hiding
[1:00:19] he told him that in the garden he says
[1:00:20] you know what he says the shepherd's
[1:00:22] going to be smote and you guys are all
[1:00:23] going to run away and they said
[1:00:25] not me i ain't running away nope nope
[1:00:27] peter said i got a sword
[1:00:30] i'll stick it out oh i promise jesus
[1:00:33] looked at him and said peter you know
[1:00:35] what
[1:00:36] they that live by the sword die by the
[1:00:37] sword
[1:00:38] by the time the crows
[1:00:40] he said you'll deny me three times and
[1:00:42] peter said not on your life
[1:00:46] not on your life i'm not going back on
[1:00:49] this
[1:00:52] well yeah that's a whole nother message
[1:00:54] but
[1:00:56] yeah they all ran away they didn't they
[1:00:58] could not understand god's word until
[1:01:02] after pentecost when the god that was
[1:01:05] that wrote the word came into their
[1:01:08] hearts to live the word amen because you
[1:01:10] can't live this thing without it
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:15] you know that after two days
[1:01:18] the feast of the passover and the son of
[1:01:20] man is betrayed to be crucified
[1:01:23] then assembled don't you see look
[1:01:25] he says then assembled together the
[1:01:28] chief priests the scribes the elders
[1:01:32] under the palace of the high priest who
[1:01:34] was called cahiaphus
[1:01:36] and they consulted how they might make
[1:01:38] jesus take jesus by subtility and kill
[1:01:40] him how do you sneak up on this guy
[1:01:44] he's the god of heaven
[1:01:47] he's the god of heaven how do you sneak
[1:01:49] up on him by subtility huh let me tell
[1:01:52] you let me see how that works out
[1:01:55] praise the lord amen
[1:01:59] 26 okay
[1:02:01] so it's
[1:02:02] so they decided they said well we don't
[1:02:05] want to do it at the feast day which is
[1:02:08] friday
[1:02:10] don't do it friday
[1:02:12] lest there be an uproar among the people
[1:02:14] because everybody's here
[1:02:17] brother branham said the most religious
[1:02:19] people
[1:02:20] the most religious city
[1:02:22] the most religious feast
[1:02:24] everybody's here
[1:02:25] let's not let's not do it then
[1:02:28] we got it because when they took him was
[1:02:30] thursday
[1:02:32] they didn't take him friday they took
[1:02:34] him thursday
[1:02:36] and they took him by subtility they took
[1:02:38] him in the garden when he was in prayer
[1:02:41] it wasn't out in the open they didn't
[1:02:43] you know because at one time they came
[1:02:45] and they confronted him and he said look
[1:02:47] he said didn't i teach daily in the
[1:02:49] temple and none of you touched me
[1:02:52] and they are sneaky politicians
[1:02:55] they said well we got to do stuff in the
[1:02:57] dark because that's where we live
[1:02:59] amen
[1:03:01] now i want you to notice
[1:03:03] so now when jesus was in bethany in the
[1:03:06] house of simon the leper
[1:03:08] so now
[1:03:09] we found in in saint john 12
[1:03:13] that before on saturday jesus was at
[1:03:16] lazarus house
[1:03:18] and on saturday martha was there mary
[1:03:21] was there
[1:03:23] and lazarus was there
[1:03:25] and we told you how the types of the
[1:03:27] believer
[1:03:28] and the worshiper
[1:03:30] and and the servant they were all there
[1:03:33] amen
[1:03:36] and
[1:03:38] so now it says in jesus was in bethany
[1:03:41] at the house of simon the leper so so
[1:03:43] one of his trips back out of the city i
[1:03:45] don't know on monday or tuesday or
[1:03:47] wednesday when he went out he goes to
[1:03:49] simon the leper's house
[1:03:53] and there came into him or unto him a
[1:03:55] woman having an alabaster box a very
[1:03:58] precious ointment
[1:04:00] and poured it on his
[1:04:01] head
[1:04:04] not
[1:04:05] on his feet
[1:04:10] before this whole drama started
[1:04:15] mary came and anointed his feet
[1:04:17] and after all this has taken place the
[1:04:20] fig tree being cursed and all of that
[1:04:23] he goes to simon the leper's house and
[1:04:26] some other woman comes in
[1:04:28] and anoints his head
[1:04:31] it's very specific
[1:04:34] it is very specific because i went back
[1:04:36] and looked at it i said wait a minute i
[1:04:38] okay
[1:04:39] because the theologians all say that
[1:04:42] this is the same mary lazarus
[1:04:45] sister
[1:04:47] because martha and mary and lazarus were
[1:04:49] brothers and sisters
[1:04:51] but this mary is not that mary
[1:04:54] because the other one is very specific
[1:04:56] john says it's her feet
[1:04:58] and here
[1:04:59] it's not even in the same house
[1:05:01] it's very specific
[1:05:03] and it's on her head his head
[1:05:07] but when his disciples saw it they had
[1:05:08] indignation and saying to what purpose
[1:05:10] is this waste for the ointment might
[1:05:13] have been sold for much and given to the
[1:05:14] poor and when jesus understood it he
[1:05:17] said unto them why trouble ye this woman
[1:05:20] for she hath wrought a good work unto me
[1:05:22] for you have the poor always with you
[1:05:24] but me you have not always for in that
[1:05:27] she hath poured this ointment on my body
[1:05:30] she did it for my burial
[1:05:31] verily i say unto you wherever this
[1:05:33] gospel shall be preached in the whole
[1:05:35] world there shall also this that this
[1:05:38] woman hath done to be told for a
[1:05:40] memorial of her amen
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:45] let's go to mark
[1:05:46] um 14.
[1:05:49] let's take a look here
[1:05:52] praise the lord i haven't worn you out
[1:05:54] yet have i
[1:05:57] amen
[1:06:00] mark 14.
[1:06:04] starting in verse 1 it says
[1:06:06] in two days
[1:06:07] was the feast of the passover and an
[1:06:10] unleavened bread
[1:06:11] okay
[1:06:13] so
[1:06:14] this is two days
[1:06:15] before the feast of the passover so we
[1:06:17] know that's well we know the passover
[1:06:20] that was the meal that was thursday
[1:06:22] night
[1:06:23] so thursday night tuesday night say an
[1:06:26] hour on tuesday night
[1:06:28] and the chief priests and the scribes
[1:06:29] saw it how that they might take him by
[1:06:31] craft and put him to death but they said
[1:06:33] not on the feast day unless there be an
[1:06:34] uproar of the people so that's the exact
[1:06:36] same recording we wrote read elsewhere
[1:06:39] and verse 3 says and being in bethany in
[1:06:42] the house of simon the leper
[1:06:44] as he sat at me there came a woman
[1:06:46] having an alabaster box of ointment of
[1:06:48] spiker very precious and she break the
[1:06:51] box and poured it on his head
[1:06:54] and there were some that had ignation
[1:06:56] within themselves and said why was this
[1:06:58] waste of the ointment made see they were
[1:07:01] believers but they were still upset
[1:07:05] they were upset
[1:07:06] for it might have been sold more
[1:07:09] for more than 300 pence and could have
[1:07:11] been given to the poor and they murmured
[1:07:13] against her and jesus said let her alone
[1:07:15] why trouble ye her she hath wrought a
[1:07:17] good work on me for you have the poor
[1:07:19] with you always and wheresoever you will
[1:07:22] and
[1:07:23] whensoever ye will you may do them good
[1:07:26] but me you have not always
[1:07:29] and she has done that what she could she
[1:07:31] has come beforehand to anoint my body to
[1:07:34] the bearing verily i say unto you
[1:07:37] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[1:07:38] preached throughout the whole world this
[1:07:40] also should be done shall be spoken as a
[1:07:44] memorial of her amen
[1:07:47] amen praise god
[1:07:49] amen
[1:07:52] so let's go to
[1:07:53] matthew 26.
[1:07:57] praise the lord
[1:07:59] so we see
[1:08:01] we see that this whole week
[1:08:05] started on saturday with a feast
[1:08:08] and everybody was there all the
[1:08:09] believers were there and a whole bunch
[1:08:11] of other people that were just curious
[1:08:12] were there
[1:08:13] and then jesus got up the next day and
[1:08:15] he he walked up he got close to the
[1:08:17] mount of olives he got to the mount of
[1:08:19] olives and he said oh wait a minute
[1:08:20] there's scriptures that have to be
[1:08:22] fulfilled
[1:08:24] i can't just go down
[1:08:27] with zechariah standing there
[1:08:29] because those are my thoughts
[1:08:32] and my thoughts have to be fulfilled
[1:08:36] praise the lord i just when i think of
[1:08:38] that it just makes me happy
[1:08:41] when i think i'm free from sin and death
[1:08:43] that makes me happy too
[1:08:46] and if i get a bunny rabbit out of it
[1:08:48] too then i'm okay with that
[1:08:51] amen you see god is trying to show us
[1:08:55] something amen
[1:08:57] so in matthew 26 starting at verse um
[1:09:01] 17
[1:09:04] amen
[1:09:08] now the first day of the feast of
[1:09:10] unleavened bread the disciples came to
[1:09:12] jesus so it's during
[1:09:15] this period of time
[1:09:18] they come to jesus saying unto him
[1:09:20] where wilt thou that we prepare for thee
[1:09:23] to eat the passover
[1:09:26] and jesus said go into the city to such
[1:09:28] a man go to a specific man
[1:09:32] see he says that to such a man
[1:09:34] and say unto him
[1:09:36] the master saith
[1:09:38] my time is at hand i will keep the
[1:09:40] passover at thy house with my disciples
[1:09:44] and the disciples did as jesus had
[1:09:46] appointed appointed them and they made
[1:09:48] ready the passover okay
[1:09:51] now let's look at mark 14.
[1:09:54] praise the lord
[1:09:56] mark 14
[1:09:58] verse 12
[1:10:00] and on the first day of unleavened bread
[1:10:03] when they killed the passover his
[1:10:05] disciples said unto him where wilt thou
[1:10:07] that we go and prepare that thou mayest
[1:10:09] eat the passover
[1:10:11] and he saith
[1:10:12] he sendeth forth two of his disciples
[1:10:15] and he saith unto them
[1:10:17] go into the city
[1:10:19] and there shall you meet a man bearing a
[1:10:21] pitcher of water
[1:10:22] follow him
[1:10:25] and wheresoever he shall go in
[1:10:27] say to the good man of the house the
[1:10:30] master saith where is the guest chamber
[1:10:33] where i shall eat the passover with my
[1:10:34] disciples
[1:10:36] and he will show you a large upper room
[1:10:38] furnished and prepared there make ready
[1:10:41] for us
[1:10:42] and his disciples went forth and came
[1:10:44] into the city and found as he had said
[1:10:46] unto them and they made ready the
[1:10:48] passover
[1:10:50] amen
[1:10:51] so now let's go to luke 22.
[1:10:54] amen
[1:10:56] praise the lord
[1:10:58] let's go to luke 22.
[1:11:01] god's so wonderful
[1:11:03] he's got all these little
[1:11:06] nuggets
[1:11:07] he just all these
[1:11:12] then came the day of unleavened bread
[1:11:14] when the passover must be killed
[1:11:17] and he sent peter
[1:11:18] and john
[1:11:22] before just said two of his disciples
[1:11:24] but now in luke he says these are the
[1:11:28] guys that i'm sending
[1:11:30] i'm sending peter
[1:11:33] because i trust him and i'm sending john
[1:11:35] because i love him
[1:11:37] and i'm sending them
[1:11:39] go and prepare
[1:11:41] us the passover that we may eat
[1:11:44] now if you were paying attention and you
[1:11:45] remember what we said before
[1:11:48] this could not happen without jesus
[1:11:52] seeing a vision
[1:11:56] and when he spoke the word to them
[1:11:59] they were at a crossroads
[1:12:02] they had to believe him
[1:12:04] or doubt him
[1:12:06] but because they're believers
[1:12:08] they believed him right
[1:12:10] they believed him
[1:12:13] and they in they said unto him well
[1:12:16] where where are we going to go
[1:12:18] tell us what you want us to do
[1:12:21] and he says unto them behold when you
[1:12:23] are entered into the city this is
[1:12:25] jerusalem
[1:12:26] there shall a man meet you
[1:12:29] bearing a pitcher of water
[1:12:31] follow him into the house where he
[1:12:33] entereth into
[1:12:35] and you shall say unto the good men of
[1:12:37] the house this is the second guy
[1:12:40] the master saith unto thee where is the
[1:12:42] guest chamber where i shall eat the
[1:12:44] passover with my disciples
[1:12:46] and he shall show you a large upper room
[1:12:49] furnished
[1:12:50] their make ready
[1:12:52] and they went
[1:12:55] and they found
[1:12:58] as he had said unto them
[1:13:00] and they made ready the passover
[1:13:03] amen
[1:13:05] amen
[1:13:08] they went into this city
[1:13:11] and they started looking
[1:13:12] you know in all the bible
[1:13:15] and all the bible and all the scriptures
[1:13:17] you can look anywhere you want brother
[1:13:19] mark
[1:13:20] there are no men with pictures of water
[1:13:28] rebecca went out to the well
[1:13:34] the woman that had seven husbands went
[1:13:36] out to the well
[1:13:40] there's no men with a pitcher of water
[1:13:46] what a strange thing
[1:13:50] to go into a city
[1:13:52] and find a man with a pitcher of water
[1:13:55] and he's singing
[1:13:59] it shall be light
[1:14:01] about the evening time

[1:14:06] you will surely find
[1:14:10] the waterway

[1:14:23] repent of all your sins
[1:14:26] the holy ghost will surely enter in
[1:14:31] the evening time has come

[1:14:37] are
[1:14:39] one

[1:14:44] the evening time
[1:14:46] who is the man with the water pot

[1:14:57] the householder the guy that owns the
[1:14:59] house
[1:15:02] but if you don't get your baptism right
[1:15:04] you can't go the next step
[1:15:07] if you still and under father son and
[1:15:09] holy ghost or under sprinkling or
[1:15:11] something else and you haven't heard the
[1:15:13] man singing the song
[1:15:15] you can't go in
[1:15:18] you can't go in
[1:15:19] they went down they found the man with
[1:15:22] the water pot and they went and when
[1:15:23] they got there they found
