========================================
daily lives Lord and to assure their final destination Lord there's and be certain of their salvation father and their relationship with you for granted dear Lord may they be certain other relationship with each other Lord when they leave this place Lord to know that all hearts are clear Lord there's no barriers between you vertically and there's no barriers horizontally between them and another person Lord or just to live clear and purposeful Lord as as you would have us to live granted Lord we pray that you'd open this word now to us Lord and open your heart father and may each heart be here be open to you in Jesus Christ's name amen amen God bless you as you received this morning praise the Lord we've got the wireless microphone I need to take my jacket it's no good to uh I guess some advances can work with one one arm tie behind their back like that but I'm some something in my bloodline maybe the Italian or the Irish or something I have to move my hands around when I talk right brother Bruce so we we like to have those hands-free but what I'd like to preach on this morning if I could have your attention and I certainly appreciate you coming out to hear the word this morning but I'd like to preach and take the topic of under the influence under the influence and we take this scripture here this morning on wine to not be drunk with wine whereas in excess but to be filled with the spirit and there's something about wine there's something about wine that it it has a power to bring us under some kind of an influence that's why when you drink too much of it well not you I'm sure that you all wouldn't drink too much of it but when a person would drink too much of it they come underneath what they call Under the Influence that's why you get a DIY for driving Under the Influence is that right you're driving intoxicated you're driving under the influence of alcohol but and that's the thing about wine is the wine itself is there's nothing wrong with with what the wine originally was right but there's there's a power behind the wine that power of the alcohol that's inside the wine to bring you under its influence and matter of fact when wine started out it was something very innocent just sitting on a table somewhere and it was just a bunch of grape juice but you give it the right atmosphere you give it the right conditions you give it the right amount of time and you find that it develops within it some kind of an influence and there's certain things that I think that if we allow in our lives and we allow them to sit there in our lives and sit there long enough there becomes an influence that comes underneath that an influence that can when we look back along our life's Trail and if we if we don't pay attention we get our kids are all grown up and we see them going certain ways and we we see them doing certain things even as they start to learn how to talk and start to say things they're like where did you get that from I've got a five-year-old back there and sometimes like where did you get that from and you start being a little circumspect and you look back and said oh there's something that I let sit there and he he got it from that so there's there's a power that like wine there's things that we allow into our lives that if we're not careful they have the power to bring an influence in us and we have to be looking at that from a thinking man's filter is that influence something that's influencing me towards eternity or has it influence me toward damnation is it influencing my family who's not yet saved yet not yet filled with the Holy Ghost these little children is it influencing them towards eternity or is it influencing them towards accepting the ways the world which goes down to the pit so wine itself is not the issue but there's something behind that wine that gives its power over us and likewise when we talk about let's say a TV a TV is not the issue in itself brother Brandon even said that it could have been used for great good but what happened is people let something else come behind that technology and now we see by and large the bulk of what comes out of Hollywood is something that will send your soul to hell it has an influence behind it you look at some modern examples for today you look at advertising and culture even and you see that there's an influence behind what the advertiser is trying to get to you they flash up so many pictures of of women on the Billboards and women here and and women in advertising until it's it's nothing to see someone in their underwear anymore it's nothing to walk through Nordstroms or Walmart or or wherever you would frequent and and pass by and see a woman completely scanly dressed down to her just her underneath garments and because of that regular putting it in front of people it dumbs down the culture so there's no more shock value but yet there's an influence there still residing amen that's not grape juice that's sitting on your counter but there's an influence behind that that if you allow it to stay in your life and you allow that to be your normal along with this culture's normal then it has the possibility to ruin your life you look at maybe for example what this world is now doing they they take what was once completely socially taboo and they first start to rationalize it like oh the animals do that the animal kingdom they work in this sort of way and they'll take homosexuality and they'll start to rationalize it well I I want to tell you first of all I'm not an animal and I didn't come from animal matter of fact animal was underneath me and when I fell when human race fell underneath Adam all animal kind fell but yet they'll take those things and they'll rationalize it and it goes from rationalized to being accepted and from being accepted it goes to being normalized and it's no longer just normalized anymore today now it's celebrated now it's now it's it's it's thrown out in the open not just we want to we we we want to be accepted but we want to be proud full of this and and this is something to be you know to say oh that's how you are oh you're gay you're this that or the other you let's let's celebrate that let's let's let's recognize this person as the woman of the year and that's not even a woman that's a man tried to make themselves look like a woman but we'll celebrate it now no longer accepting it not not just saying on the sidelines that's okay but we're bringing you into our culture and saying that's wonderful it goes from rationalized to being okay to being wonderful to being pervasive because once you make something wonderful other people want it and so now our whole culture is being brought underneath the influence of this Modern Age the influence of the lgbtq movement the influence of what this culture says normal have you ever heard the term culture shock how many has ever traveled to another country we've got a few and how when when you landed in the other country I'm not talking Canada I'm talking like another continent or something they have a different way of doing things don't they and you come to that country and you say my they they do that their their weddings are like that that's how their wedding ceremony is that's that's how they conduct business and everything about it everything about that Society shocks you doesn't it there's there's that culture shock and maybe you're a little bit judgy and you say well I that's not the right way to get married and that's not the right way to close a deal and that's not the right way to go about your regular life inside your family and and you find out that's just culture but there is a Godly culture and there is a culture of the world and we have to be careful that we don't just start accepting our culture as being the right way of doing things and and that's why I think it's for one thing it's it's so great to know what other cultures are because it gives you some kind of perspective to judge your own Culture by and to realize that your culture is not the the de facto standard for judging how to do things and neither is their culture you find out that all men have gone astray all men need salvation all men need God and all cultures are corrupt but don't let your culture become so normal to you that you just keep on accepting these things so what else is out there right now I I I turn to what we look at the the online influencers today if they're not even they're not even considered uh wolf in the sheep's clothing anymore they're actually saying hey my name is an influencer that's what I'm doing it's like it's like I'm going to take the sheep's clothing off and I'm going to tell you I am here to influence your life right I am here on YouTube and I am here to make money to influence your life and yet our society and it's in its crazed fashion drives to YouTube and drives to Instagram and drives to tick tock in Hoards so that they can find someone to influence their life and why is that it's because people are sheep I'm not saying people and sheep like the Republicans talk about people being sheep oh that's just a sheep you're just a sheep you just need to be led by somebody no no no God was the first one to call us sheep and when God called us sheep he said it in a loving way he said I built you to be a sheep I designed you to be a sheep because I want to be your Shepherd I made you I made your heart in a way that it looks for someone to lead you but when this culture when this society when this world goes to someone on YouTube and goes to some other Fallen man and says I'm going to look for them to them for my lifestyle you're going to the wrong source go on to YouTube and you finally find all sorts of parents that want to tell tell you how to be a parent tell you how to parent your child and they'll they'll say let we just bought this 500 000 RV and we're gonna pack up our whole family and we're going to go around the entire country and spend our life just going places and that's the ideal of a family let's do stuff and see things and that's the ideal and we'll look at that and we'll say my they're getting to see the world they're getting to do all the things I I I wish I could have done when I was little I I could do that for my family if I could just you know find a five thousand dollar camper off of Facebook Marketplace and attach it to my little run-down rusty truck and try to make it out west and and now we're we're building all these things in our mind how we can emulate these big images that we see online right without stopping to ask ourselves what is it about that family that they could pull up all the roots and unplug from a church family unplug from a community unplug from grandmas and their grandpas that would influence their children and just leave everyone behind there's something that's not being shown it's like a magic trick you you get everybody's attention over here but there's something over here that's making it work and when somebody shows you a bunch of Disney Magic a bunch of magic that looks so wonderful that you want to sh that you want to seek after it you got to ask yourself what is it over here that you're not seeing and there's something in those people's hearts that's causing them to do those things when you jump on there and you see the girls that look so fashionable and and they're wearing the clothes on Tick Tock and they've got all the dance moves and they've got all the and they've got all the lifestyle and they've got the health activity and they've they've seen like they've got all the organizational smarts together and their children are like little ducks in a row that are just they jump right out of the front page of some kind of clothing advertisement and everything's perfect and you want to make your family just like that remember it's a magic act they're showing you this but remember there's something over here that's causing their family to balance way over here and you've got to ask yourself is that what I want to follow after is that the influence that I want to bring my family under and so they'll they'll they'll tell you what you should do for your health and how to organize your home and how to make it just look like like uh like it just jumped off of HDTV and all the time there's these subtle signals going out this is the important things these are the Ten Commandments for your life and the Ten Commandment isn't to honor God it's not to come to church it's not to not commit adultery it's not to not steal or have false witness it's these are our priorities we want to look good we want to feel good we want to have other people see us as good we want to experience things whether it's in an RV or some kind of um some kind of party life or whatever it is they're trying to show you their priorities but you've got to ask yourself what priorities and all of this are being left behind Psalm says it this way blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly and you might say but it's also written in the multitude of counselors there's safety I just want to get on YouTube I just want to get on Facebook and see what people are doing but remember and when you walk in the Council of the ungodly you won't be blessed amen we're not even talking you read that scripture there and you read down in Psalms 1 that's the first level walking the counseling Godly later on it stocks talks about sitting in the seat of the scornful and and so on we're not talking about scornful people we're not talking about the mockers we're not talking about the base of society we're just saying the person who doesn't want who walks in the Council of the ungodly he's not going to be blessed what's the ungodly it just simply means those without God because they are sheep without a shepherd the blind following the blind yeah and they may be good people they may be moral people that that hold to Conventional morals like the Golden Rule and being nice and kind and being contributors to society and being generous but if they don't have God in their lives they are sheep without a Shepherd they're blind fall in the Blind and if you walk in their counsel you'll be following the blind fall in the blind following the blind matter of fact you'll be worse because you have sight this morning you have the word of God you have the light of the end time this morning and yet you would choose to be the sight of those who have sight walking after the blind who are walking off the blind why would you turn away from that and close your eyes in this last day and walk after those who are walking after the blind don't be found one with sight who is walking after the sightless but make sure that you're not walking the counsel of the ungodly amen Amen in Proverbs it says that wine is a mocker and strong drink raging he who is deceived thereby is not wise the influences of this world want to mock your life can I just bring it real this morning give you a little bit of a real example you know what I found to be a mocker in my life HGTV you know what HGTV was a mocker in my life because I I got this uh I got this this subscription to the Discovery Channel for my kid I wanted to show them these these uh uh what do you call the documentaries and the sea creatures and so on I thought that Discovery Channel would have a lot of that so I got a free subscription to Discovery Channel and I loaded it up and just one click over was HGTV and you know you've got all the Home Improvement stuff I didn't want to watch too much of that because if if Joanna Gaines got on there she might influence my wife and then I'd have to all these home projects and a big honey-do list and I I didn't want that but there they had you know that they had the the real estate and I loved every house I ever bought in my life I I loved buying it the whole process I I loved it and now I can watch other people go through the process of buying a house and of course on HGTV none of them have budgets like I have you know you just you just like as soon as they say uh the whole the whole format if you've never watched it they come in and they they meet at the realtor and they say this the budget we have and this is the house that we're happy that we want to look for and then they go and look for three houses and then they're like hmm what kind of house am I gonna pick and you're cheering for the house that you want the whole time and then they pick the other house that you don't want and um and that's how it works well as soon as they say a budget that's like less than half a million dollars you're like next episode nobody wants to watch that I I don't want to watch me I want to I want to watch the guy that's the next step above me right so that's how the human mind is working I wanna what do the rich guys have so we I watched a couple of those and come to find out they they don't just have regular episodes they've got cabins in the Rockies episodes and they've got cabins in Montana episodes and then they've got uh you know Timber framed housing episodes and the whole season is dedicated to just exactly the kind of house that you would want if you were to buy your dream house and you know some people get in the teeth into into sports and things and and get all excited I got excited about HGTV and these guys were on there and and they'd buy this they look at this cabin they look at the one with 15 acres and the one with three acres and the one with half an acre on the lake and then they go with the one with half an acre on the lake and I just about take my shoe off and throw it at the screen because why would you buy a cabin with half an acre if you're gonna buy a half million dollar quarter Mill a million and a quarter buy something with some land get some Forest out there buy an ATV it's like well money was wasted on the wrong people and I thought this is all good fun until I pull up my phone a few days into watching these episodes and you know it's it's kind of funny when you get on your phone you're not really thinking it's kind of you watch your thumb and it kind of shows you what your heart's thinking and I kind of watched my thumb and it clicked over to Zillow and clicked over to Toledo Ohio typed in cabins as a filter I'm like there's no cabins in Toledo Ohio why do I even live in Toledo Ohio why didn't my family raise me in this area why couldn't we have moved out to Colorado in the first place and and and and and and why do I have to have such a small budget for a house and why is my house the way I had to stop myself because something was becoming a mocker in my life because I know that God gave me the house I'm in God God put it in my heart to live closer to my church community and we sold our home two years ago and and moved closer and and we gave up the property that we had and and sized down from 10 acres to one acre and and and and and and left it all behind us and said we want to be where the church family is we want the fellowship we want to be in communication we want to be in connection with our church and and the whole testimony from beginning to end how that whole thing played out I know that was the testimony of Jesus Christ in my in my life and now something's coming along HGD HGTV is coming along and mocking the testimony of God in my life oh I wonder if this is starting to hit home with someone this morning do you see how our culture wants to mock God's testimony in your life he wants to mock the very gifts that God gives you that's Satan's goal not just not just a physical gift like your first home or or whatever family Homestead you have he wants to mock the holy ghost in your life he wants to mock the upbringing that's in your life he wants to mock the good things they've been put in your life and cause you to go out and throw those in the street and follow after the world like some kind of a prodigal but God says the prodigal come home they're still riches here there's still a family here there's still open arms to receive you here this morning and there's still a life for you and I've made it good and all that that's out in the world that wants to mock you and will one day not just mock what you had but mock what you are because wasn't that the end of The Prodigal Son when he followed that road to its terminal destination he had friends and he had a good time for a while but at the end of the road he was spent and he was left with no friends wine is a mocker you know what else is a mocker Facebook and social media is a mocker you know because when I get on Facebook and I can have just come off a greatest family vacation of my life I'll get on Facebook Monday morning at work not at work you know lunch hour come on give me a break I'll be like man that crate was a great family vacation but I could load up Facebook and see somebody else bragging about their family vacation they're on right now and I'll be like that wasn't such a great family vacation they're in Florida and I'm stuck up here in Michigan still and it's still cold Facebook is a mocker social media Will Mock your life and make the blessings of God look small in comparison with somebody else's highlight reels and we know at least the if we have wisdom about us we know that that's not truth we know they're not showing us their bad days they're only showing us their good days there's a reason why their post is the first post in 37 days it's because the other 37 Days weren't worth bragging about but now they've got something worth bragging about so they are they've got something worth sharing we'll say but yet we'll let social media get up there and and tear us down and mock us do you know that our suicide rate among young children and and even even Generation Z is skyrocketing depression during covet was out of hand because people get on these devices and they have no life and they look at other people who they perceive do have a life and they said what's my life worth living so it's time for us to set down these devices and go find a life in Jesus Christ to not let ourselves be brought underneath these influences you know it's it's um it's remarkable to me we talk about wine being a mocker as a as an as an analogy this morning if I was talking to my friend over in in Maine and he's he's a part of a church over there and they get a lot of people that come over from the Congo in different places and you know I'd always hear about the people in other countries and especially third world countries how they would walk both ways to to church and they would walk all days all day to get there and there was something that was so remarkable in my heart that someone would spend their whole Sunday just to get to church and in the Congo if you if you know the the the the the the the light that we have is is so remarkably spread throughout the Congo it's it's one of the if it was to be called the denomination it's one of the top denominations in the area so one of the top ways of faith if you can say that of course we we understand that it's not a denomination but the people that make the record books there in that area don't understand that and churches are in the thousands and but yet in every Church you have a make-believer you have an unbeliever and you have a True Believer in every Church and so they're all walking to church maybe but I was I was I was so impressed with just just that that sacrifice that diligence but yet my friend in Maine was telling me that you can see some of them when they came over they seemed the first thing that they wanted to try was alcohol because they couldn't get their hands on it back in their home country or they they kind of got underneath out from under the influencer of mom and dad from their home country and now they're they found their way to America and and they have access to it and as soon as they as soon as they got a hold that you see you say the next thing I saw is they they were out of church and so it it's our society right and we always want to imagine what our what our struggle with maybe and downplay what God has put us in say well those people over there in Africa they're they're such real true Christians and and I'm over here in America and what am I doing for the Lord but just the fact that you're called for laodicea this day and again that that thing about that thing about it's culture shock you don't realize how much pressure you are under every single day because you're climatized to it it's normal for you but this is just a reminder the kind of pressure you can you are under every single day someone from Africa comes over and it's enough to break them if they're not strong but yet you are strong you hear this you were strong enough to get out of bed on a Sunday morning at 9 00 a.m and get to church by 9 30. and be here this morning to hear the word and take it home in your hearts and and be stronger for the Lord tomorrow so there's something in you that that was enough to get you here this morning there was something in you that that no matter what this no matter what this culture is the the darkest days that there ever was with high suicide rates and people that don't understand what their purpose in life is and they're just losing all hope and and depression when when America is the richest country in the world and yet we're dealing with depression like never before why is that it's because the age is dark and man has lost their way and their sheep without a shepherd but yet there was something strong enough in your heart this morning to reach out and say I'm going to church I'm going to find a way I'm not going to find my way I'm not going to find the way of the influencers I'm going to find the way of the Lord because I know that in that way there is salvation and that way there's goodness and that way there is happiness and joy and peace and prosperity in the Holy Spirit the Bible says this in first Timothy they that be rich fall into temptation and the snare and into many foolish and hurtful lusts which drown men in destruction and perdition they that be rich you say oh yeah I believe Elon Musk is having a real hard time with foolish and hurtful losts but did you know that the median income of the world globally after adjusting for cost of living in the disparate regions is about twenty thousand dollars I'm sorry ten thousand dollars per household or about 2 900 per capita that's a after adjusting for cost of living that means in most the world people figure out how to live with their family on ten thousand dollars imagine that you'd be saying well I I couldn't even pay the electric bill they don't that's why most the world doesn't have electricity if you're looking on a per capita basis well I'd be living in a hut a lot of people do live in a hut so who I'm speaking to this morning is the people that first Timothy is talking about they that be rich Fallen Temptation the snare there are many foolish and hurtful lost out there and these devices that we have this is Satan's primary doorway to his primary snare if I can put it this way to capture you into the foolish and hurtful loss that are out there you know we talked about the door of Sodom and being at the door of Sodom how many remembers that story of lot and he there he was in the midst of Sodom and all these homosexuals were knocking down the door trying to get in and grab away his guest and he had to offer them his own family members they were knocking down the door now we have this phrase you know of for a dad to be at the door of Sodom to protect his family but you know the front door is not our doorway now well we'll have men with her big strong chest and go out and they'll buy a gun they'll buy a shotguns to say that I can protect my household and you know the I have a castle right and everything else but you're missing the right door you'll have a man that has a shotgun protecting the front door of his home and yet in the back room his children are loading up some device with a bunch of pornography on it and he's let every single other door in his house every single other door in his house wide open because he's not being circumspect he's not really guarding his household he's not applying the token he's not watching where those children are going right and wine is mocking his family that influence is mocking his family and those children are growing up underneath the influence of who knows what if he's not careful and they're walking out and they're saying how how do I ever get these things out of my mind right and and if he's not careful that that child is one day going to look back at him and say you let it in I didn't know how to deal with it I I when that popped up the first time I didn't know how to deal with it I wasn't even looking for it it came looking for me it came hunting me and there was no protector for me there was no one to cover me and you didn't do your job father you didn't do your job mother and I was left as a sheep without a shepherd and the walls were all around I succumbed to it and wine is a mocker and it mocks your family because we didn't rise to the occasion and I'm saying this is a clear message the fathers and the mothers that have little children this morning you need to rise to the occasion if you haven't beaten this mocker in your own life it's time to tear down that mocker it's time to submit your life over to the Lord and say Lord let me defeat this influence in my own life that I may cover my own children that they wouldn't fall prey to this because Satan wants to mock your life and he's not just content with that he wants to mock your family and he wants to turn your children to mockers that when they grow up one day they'll look back at you and mock everything that you believe and throw it in your face because you did not guard your children right to begin with be careful don't let the influence of this world get into your family don't let it become a mocker to you don't let it be that one day your kids are talking about my old man this and you're in your 80s and they're talking about my old man this and my old man this and when they talk to their friends at work they they just kind of joke about you let it be that you become a man of God friends that when your children grow up they'll talk about you and say yeah you might think I'm weird and yeah I don't I don't participate on all the jokes and I don't go to your drinking parties but I know that I'm going to be able to be in heaven one day I know where I stand I know my purpose in life I've got my head on my shoulders and I've got his word in my heart and I can say that because of my father because of my mother doing family devotions with me guarding me instilling the word of God In My Heart from when I was young I had that today I had that treasure and your children can exhibit a treasure to the world the world knows nothing about and it's they may never respect it in the way that they respect the online influencer but we're not here to win the awe and the accolades of the world we're here is that one day when we walk through those Pearly Gates we can hear the words well done my good and faithful servant amen enter into the joy of your reward kind of touch on just a couple more things this morning gateways that I see that this world is having its influence on us you know what is another huge mocker besides the internet and besides social media I see that Hollywood is a great mocker in our time I think it's gone even more so since covid when we were all locked in we had nothing to do we had to find some way to spend all that time I'll just be honest my wife and I have been going through this conversation a lot lately and I'm really sharing with you a lot that has been going on in our our home because during coven there were things that we just wanted some entertainment we just wanted a relief from pressure and we didn't always go to the right sources for that and I don't say there's no place for entertainment I don't say that there's no place for cartoons for your children I don't say there's no place for a a a an innocent movie but most of what Hollywood brings into our home Is Not Innocent and because of our culture and because of our lack of culture shock many Christians in the church today have lost their sense of judgment for what is innocent versus what the world calls innocent the world Hollywood wants to make a mockery of holiness in your family and wants to come in and you might say well I I I don't believe in adultery that's one of the Ten Commandments and I would never have that in my home but you'll come in and you'll let some man slop all over some woman right in your home and if it happened with your guest you'd throw them out but if it's happening on your screen well I'll just maybe turn my head for that but while you're turning your head your family's seeing that and there's something that rises up in the heart of a child when they see your values in contrast to your life and it's going to put mockery into their hearts and saying there's something there's something that doesn't add up and if you let that Fester that's a great way to raise a little mocker that one day looks back and say yeah Dad you preached it but you didn't live it you might say well that seems kind of strong but isn't it true that the world celebrates fornication today it it celebrates promiscuity it celebrates man and woman touching each other and they they may not show everything on screen but they sure allude to it they sure talk about it and if you don't rise to the occasion say well we're just kind of going to let that go through one ear and out the other it doesn't work that way it doesn't go through one ear and out the other just the fact that you're low in your guards it becomes normal is a problem in itself but with children and with adults it goes in one ear a little bit filters down on the heart on its way out the other year don't think you can just filter it out like that Ephesians 4 29 says let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but how much communication proceeds out of Hollywood how many corrupt words proceed across the video screen I don't know what you do in your home friends and and some of you may be looking at me like brother Josiah I don't know what you're talking about and that's fine I I I applaud you if you're doing well here but I know that not everyone is and those little four-letter words and it's not just the four letter words but it's the attitude in which people speak corrupt communication only for the use of edifying I'll tell you what a lot of what I hear on the uh on on the movie feeds is not for the use of edifying that it may Minister Grace under the hearers and grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby your seal in the day of redemption and that all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you not just don't do it but be put away from you not bringing into your home but put it away from you make your home sanctified make your home a place that God's presence would be free to dwell Galatians 5 19 says it like this the works of the flesh are manifest which are these adultery and fornication we covered those but also uncleanliness loose living idolatry witchcraft sorcery magic spells things that worship or bring praise honor and glory to the occult I could name a few shows but I don't think I have to I'm not here to give you a list of what's of what's a good show and what's a bad show but what I'd like you to do is take the word today and bring the conversation home and say hey is what we're watching is what we're letting into our home is it is it matching up to God's word is it matching up to fruits of the spirit or could it be defined as adultery and fornication loose living idolatry witchcraft hatred variance emulations Wrath there's a lot of Wrath on movies today strife you know what Ella Strife means it means electioneering and partisanship my doesn't Fox News and CNN just ring of that today see I only I only watch the news brother yeah but if you if you if you watch the news 24 7 if all you watch is Fox there are Republicans that's as close to Christians you can get well I don't think so because I can watch the fruit of that if you if you stay on those talk shows and and listen to Fox all the time what comes out of that is Strife in your life all that lux nearing and all that partisanship it brings out frustration and anger at the system and anger at the other side and where's the love if you can't if you if the first thing that you do when you talk to someone on the other side of the political aisle from you is start talking about how they're wrong and you're right instead of how they need Jesus Christ there's something wrong in your life what Rises up first endings murders and drunkenness reveling and such like I feel like he just described everything that comes out of Hollywood but yet Hollywood comes out and he'll they'll make an entire docu-series of True Crime and people will feed on Dahmer or or or some kind of True Crime series and it's not just that they're educating themselves oh I want to know what happened no there's something in the on the inside that's feeding that you're making it your entertainment that you're making murder and some some some sick man Your Entertainment but the Bible says that when we look unto Jesus Christ who have changed from Glory unto Glory be careful what you're looking at friends be careful what your kids see not just in adult movies but kid movies and what kind of attitudes those kids have not just what they're saying but what kind of attitudes are those cartoons having what kind of ideologies is Disney trying to get across to your children you've got to guard the gates of your home friends apply the token to your home and that's not just the front door that's the video screens that's computer screens that's everything every every telephone that's in your in your home but wine is a mocker and strong drink is Raging whoever is deceived thereby is not wise the Bible says I've talked about a lot of the regular things the internet and the devices but really anything in life can have an influence behind it and that's why we need to have a thinking man's filter that's Washed by the washing of the word of God and that's the only way that you'll not be deceived by these things that's the only way you can be wise is to have the word of God in your heart who's writing you can think of it this way who's who's writing the books that you read not just television programming you might watch or the entertainment that's before your family or what website you go to but who's who's writing the books you read you know I give an example I I had a little book I opened and it was a family book that I I grabbed off the shelf it was you know talking about how to be a better Family Guy I've said well I want to be a better family I want to be a better dad I I'll grab this book real quick from the library I open up the front cover and first introduction says to my wife Susie who no to my former wife Susie as a former wife a poor guy maybe he lost her trying to give him the benefit of Doubt here he's writing a family book maybe he lost her and to my former wife Susie who never stops extending the hand of friendship towards me and you're writing a family book I not that not that a divorcee could have learned his lesson and and write a fine book but he's celebrating his divorce he's saying this is this isn't okay in a normal situation and we're and he she still extends the hand of friendship towards me and he's making it sound like it's normal I'm like well you know God bless him and I hope he's doing okay and that the Lord continues to lead his life but I'm not going to have that life leading me there's better books out there I closed it and I found a different book to read but who's writing the things that we read and where are you getting your advice from not just off the influencers but the blogs that you read and the books that you read brother Branham had this to say about the the marriage advice and what happens within a marriage between a man and woman he said don't pay attention to the nonsense in these sexy books and the things that you read all this stuff about I'm just going to let that sink in for the married folks this is 1964. saying don't pay attention to all the nonsense in the sexy books we've got a lot more nonsense since 1964. and all this stuff and everything like that get that filthy stuff out of your mind and don't try none of these new things and I know what I'm talking about just be a husband a genuine Christian a genuine brother my goodness that that resets you doesn't it reading that almost sounds like culture shock a genuine brother treat my wife like a sister but Solomon said my sister my spouse there's a lot more that I could say there what's the solution solution is found back in our opening scripture be not drunk with wine whereas in excess but be filled with a spirit amen what does it mean to be filled it means to thoroughly furnace it means like when you buy your house ever you ever bought a house and it just feels so empty and and six months later you've got all your furniture in it and you're like wow it feels like a home now it feels like something I can rest and I can relax here that's what it means it means to furnish your heart furnace your heart with the Holy Spirit don't furnish it with all these other things you won't find relaxation or peace there furnish it with the Holy Spirit because remember God made that heart he's the designer of the of his own home he's the very architect in it and when he made the architecture of your heart he made it so that he could live there he didn't make it with anyone else in mind he didn't make it with the devil in mind matter of fact he made it such that the devil would never be fully comfortable in that art he made it such that would never be peace when the devil resides there he made it such the only time peace could reside in your heart was when you opened up the door and let him in that's what it means to have a god-sized hole in your heart a little Keyhole is God made your heart and when he made it he made it the same way that a man goes and makes his dream heart he says my wife and I you might say we always dreamed of balcony out on the master bedroom and we always dreamed of a child's room over here and we always dreamed of having a living room set up and a kitchen set just like this that's what God did when he made the human heart so I always dreamed of being able to dwell with man and when he made your heart he made it for his Dwelling Place and then you can read the Bible in 4 000 years of history is God coming to his Dwelling Place he sets up his Tabernacle and says yes this is a tabernacle made with hands but one day I'm going to dwell on a tabernacle not made with hands and at the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit poured out that was God taking occupancy the keys the kingdom as it were being used open the very door of your heart and saying this is now my home I'm going to reside there and he's a jealous God he doesn't want to share it with another he's not taking up a condominium he's not taking up an apartment he wants every room in your heart he doesn't want to share it with any other influence but he promises the fruits the spirit love joy peace patience long-suffering Temperance goodness in your life Faith and meekness so what's the solution then against all these things just be filled with the spirit just love God more well how do I do that Josiah how do I how do I love God well he's made you in such a way that the more that you look at him the more you'll fall in love with him amen you know there's there's two things you can't do too much of you can't read your Bible too much and you can't pray too much the Apostle when he was writing says when we're looking into the face of Christ we're changed maybe you don't know who maybe you don't like what your family is right now maybe you don't like who you are right now but that's okay because he says looking the face of Christ we all are changed from Glory unto Glory and there's one day that we shall see him even as he sees us we shall know them even as he knows us you say well brother Josiah what about that other script you said all things are lawful but not all things are expedient and many people will take that scripture to say well all things are lawful for me so I'm just going to do all things and then the legalist will take that same scripture and say but not all things are expedient so I'm gonna I'm gonna go home today and I'm gonna I'm gonna shoot the television out with a shotgun I'm going to throw everything to the curb and it's just going to be like a nuclear bomb dropped in our house and there goes all the hearts of your family along with it so you might say well it's not expedient so we're just going to cut it right out if it doesn't if it doesn't if it doesn't bless then it must be a curse well now wait a second brother Brandon when he talked about what all things are expedient with it it's interesting whenever he brought up this verse he talked about him going away with it to another country with his wife and and he'd say what kind of a home would it be if my wife would come up to me now you listen here Mr Branham you do this when you get over there and you don't do this and he says well miss listen here Mrs Branham he's like that wouldn't be any kind of a home but love will prevent you from taking that which is lawful and abusing it so don't look at the law you'll become a legalist but look at Christ had this little thing to share he said a woman came up to him as he said do you think it's wrong for a Christian girl to wear a scandal skirt and as I understand that's just a script that's got to split up the side or some rise that shows the underneath garments we basically do the same thing except we don't wear the underneath garments anymore so we still have the Scandal skirt today but he said what in the world does a Christian girl need with a scandal skirt even the name the title should be should be a little bit of an indicator right if she's a Christian she'll be so far away from that thing unto why it'll be just as dead to her her love is for is for Christ not to be a scandaler that's right that's quartz the shorts don't he says that's right if you love the Lord you'll be so far away from that you'll be doing something else besides that so that's where it really comes down to is just simply turn away from the things that are causing you to look away from Christ and look towards Jesus Christ and fill your home up with goodness don't fill your home up with little trinkets bought at Target don't fill your home up with your hobbies in your Workshop don't fill your heart up with all the things on the internet and all the displays that would come across that screen start putting that behind you and say I'm going to fill my I'm gonna we're gonna go home maybe like my wife and I've been doing and we're gonna start talking about what kind of entertainment we watch and wherever we can we're trying to bring before our kids Bible cartoons instead of just random cartoons that YouTube generates from us and we're learning how to control the technology so our kids don't stumble upon things because I want to be a guardian to my parents my kids I want to be that kind of parent that kind of father and looking at my own heart and saying Lord there's still things in my heart but please take it out I want to do I want to be have that love for Christ so much that it just puts everything else behind me so that expediency that yes all things are lawful but it's not expedient it's not expedient like expediency is could be defined by well expedient to what end right Paul is not talking about the kind of expediency that expedient to the end of being a polished good-looking Christian when you show up for church on Sunday or invite the pastor over on Tuesday he's saying what what is the expedient all things are a lot are lawful but not all things are expedient for what for relationship with Jesus Christ you know there are certain things that I could do that that would be totally lawful for me to do there would be nothing wrong in the law in the eyes of law but it doesn't benefit my relationship with my wife I can say well I don't hit her I don't abuse her I don't do this that or the other so everything else then is lawful yeah I could hurt her feelings that's lawful by the eyes of our law in the land I could do a lot of things that wouldn't bring me before the Barrister's Court but not all those things are expedient for our relationship and that's really what it comes down to friends and as it comes down to relationship and even if you're out of relationship with Jesus Christ this morning or you say I don't see Jesus and I I don't know how to I don't know how to have that relationship with Jesus Christ how many has ever had a really how many has ever had a friend or a brother or a mother should be all of you all had a mother come on now come on God taught you how to have relationship and even if those relationships are broke you can still look at those and say what a relationship is not and what a relationship is so you can start having a relationship with Jesus Christ just based on the fundamental laws of nature that God put in you in you start having that talk with God and saying Lord I just want to I just want to know who you are I want to be pleasing to you I want a life that's LED of the spirit I want to welcome you into my heart more than you've ever been before I'm talking I'm talking the youngest person here this morning but I'm also talking to the oldest I want God in my life more than he was yesterday isn't that your desire I want less the world in there more than it was yesterday even though it's pressing in more than it was yesterday I'm gonna press back by the help of God even more so and keep that thing out and let the Holy Spirit have resonance in my heart amen I pray that's your desire this morning as the musicians would come if you would stand with me this morning can I give you another tip for how to engender the love of Christ in your home the same chapter in Ephesians going further down right right after he says to be filled with the spirit he says speaking to yourself in Psalms and hymns and spiritual songs singing and making Mel in your heart that notice you didn't say hey Alexa sing the song for me he said you sing it you said you bring back the sing in your homes friends bring back Thanksgiving in your homes bring back the prayer in your homes bring back the random talking to Jesus throughout the day what is it it's it's relationship it's just saying Lord I know you're present let me talk to you for a while let me let me encourage your presence Let Me Entertain your presence giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen let's go before the Lord this morning I wonder if there would be anyone here this morning felt the Lord knock on their hearts door every head bowed and it's just come before the Lord this morning this is a special point in the service for me because I've shared what God gave me on my heart and now it's time for me to just simply bring you immune with the Lord and give you that special moment say Lord while he was talking there were some seeds that fell into my heart into my soil I want to water them this morning perhaps they would play something softly their sister is there any siege that fell this morning that you'd like to water with a little bit of Prayer just bring before the Lord and start talking to him this morning friends and you know the wonderful thing about a relationship is it's not like you're coming before a CEO when you have five minutes in front of the present the company to present your case and get agreement and walk away this is a relationship with Jesus Christ you know some of the best conversations I ever had with my wife took not days or or hours but some of the best most fruitful conversations I've I have had with my wife have taken weeks months some of them we've been married for seven years the conversations are still going on and there hasn't been a conclusion to all those conversations but there's been a lot of fruit along the way I wonder if there's some conversations you feel you need to have with your family when you get home this morning would you raise your hand if that's the case that we need to change some ways I wonder if you would commit to the Lord this morning if you would commit to the Lord this morning by a raising of your hand Lord when I get home I'm going to talk to my wife I'm going to talk to my husband and start the conversation I don't know where to lead but I believe that there's fruit that you want out of this and I want that fruit for our family look over at your your husband sister look over at your wife brother they're raising their hands [Music] I wonder if you would raise your hand before the Lord and say Lord I I want to talk I want to begin that conversation with you Lord I I've I've opened the door of Sodom in my life I didn't apply the token of your blood to my computer screen all my life there's things that slipped through their influences whether from YouTube or from Google searches or from blogs there there's things that I recognize that are not your influence and I Want to Be Free of them Lord but I also don't know how to wash the pervasive effect out of my life would you help me if that's your desire this morning raise your hand the Lord he wants to start that conversation with you he wants to clean your heart he so much so that he he ingrained it in his word that he wherewith shall a young man cleanse his way he saith the scripture by taking heed according to your word Paul said it this way that the Christ so much loved the church that he gave himself for the church that they would be washed by the washing of your word God gave his life for you that you could be washed from the sin and smut of this world not just that you could have eternal life but that you could have goodness in this life and be washed from the filth of this world that's your desire this morning would you go before the Lord and have that conversation with him now dear Lord Jesus we just come before you father Lord I see a lot of hearts Lord that are just being honest before you this morning Lord there's there is a wine that would make mockery today Lord influence of this Cosmos all around us they make mockery of gender and the natural order between the Sexes they make mockery of wholeness they make mockery of clean living and clean speaking they make mockery of everything the Christian stands for and then they try to stand up and make themselves influencers amongst us but Lord you're calling us out from Egypt Lord you're calling us into the promised land of your Holy Ghost where there flows milk and honey Lord goodness Lord that the influencers know nothing about that Hollywood knows nothing about Lord that the content creators know nothing about Lord You've created a content for us Lord in your word that's meant to feed our souls Lord the souls that you design and I'm so happy this morning Lord to be preaching to a group of people that want that content Lord that want that influence in their lives father would you help them now Lord as they begin that conversation or perhaps it's a conversation they've been encouraged to continue Lord already happening in their home I pray that there would be some tools in the word this morning that would Aid them in that conversation Lord and Lord because it's your word and your spirit this morning I believe Lord that'll bring forth fruit we commit it to you Lord just exactly as you would have it to be in their lives in Jesus Christ name amen God bless you friends brother Mark if you would
