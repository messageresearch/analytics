have worth being together amen because we don't come for the natural man we come for the spiritual man amen amen his presence is here we certainly appreciate you bringing it with you bringing the praise in your heart into god's house because he's worthy of our all of our praise amen that's every single one of us amen we so good to see sister linda helms here it's been a while since she's been here it's good to see your god bless you sister and appreciate that song from our brother tyler amen how how nervous it is doing doing that but he just did such a fine job and and we really appreciate the desire in his heart to want to give his gift to the lord to be used for the glory of god and and it's just a wonderful thing uh brother gideon uh and also brother jeff snodgrass wanted to send their greetings to you um we are in touch with him this week and they just wanted to greet all of you praise the lord this morning we have a little video clip some time ago you've heard that we were we're going to show some things what was happening in central america and the they sent us a big long i mean a very long video clip but it's all in spanish and i didn't know what they were saying but it was about the work of the lord that's going down there so we had thoughts about trying to get brother bill sanchez up here and but it would be a lot of work so we asked them if they could find a way to interpret so we got just one church and one selection to show but for those of you that don't know before church we ever started this church we were doing work in the mission field and we had a burden uh quite a long time ago it started to to help out uh in central america and we had an opportunity through brother melchizedek um casco and he had started a foundation there called illusma which simply means send the light in spanish and they have a board of directors and he was the the the president and he had stepped down since then and there's other brothers there they elect and these brothers honestly just take care of making sure the finances get to the many many churches that are down there in central america we don't know them all and so for us to be involved as far as who's worthy and who should be getting that we just we don't put any uh of our uh thoughts into that outside of our our prayers that god would direct the brothers there i feel that our job is just to get the money down there so they can use it of course they they've also been in charge of distributing all the bibles and that we've sent over the years hundreds of thousands of bibles um food we've sent down and all the semis and distributing all the the instruments it's it's been quite an ordeal well for many years now we've been supporting radio broadcast and as these go out to different areas groups start churches start and this is just a video clip of just one of those and we're going to play that for you now amen amen praise the lord amen hope you enjoy it i just want to say it's very hard to if she's got an accent and it's very hard to understand so just do your best for the first three minutes to to try to listen to her voice the best you can dulcino it is a municipality located in the eastern part of pholancho department in our country the missionary work in this locality begins through the initiative of our brother margarita costa who at that time was pastor of lords george implant grande in the same area his decision was to open a radio program in 2014 on a local stations in this community under the coverage of the elusive ministry when the radio program began to be transmitted over time souls began to come to the feet of lorne and that is how services began to be held in the home of our brother acosta but due to the rapid road of lourdes work in this place the need arrives for the construction for a tabernacle for which brother margarito costa donated a fraction of land and requests in 2017 to esparzen de luz masaya and luzma ministry the support of the pushes of materials for the aforementioned tabernacle which was built by the brothers from the local church currently the church continues to function always begin your prayers so that the lord continues to add to his church those who are to be saved in this place god bless you [Music] do [Music] do [Music] we're just grateful to the brethren down there that had a vision to spread the gospel and i told them at the very beginning the very very beginning it says i'm all for helping churches that are already established but my true burden is for the souls that have not come in yet of course once they come in then you you're obligated to get them a place of worship so they can continue to meet and grow it's part of the responsibility but we're grateful to the lord that there's faithful brethren around the world that are spreading the gospel and just to be a part of that i'll never forget as long as i lived before this ever started brother casco we invited him over to our house he was in the basement i went down the basement one day and they said brother melchizedek would it would it be okay if we begin to support you and his question to me he says what is your purpose and i'll never forget as long as i live because your motive is everything and if god is in it he'll bless it and he promised to bless this work beyond that beyond that what we could ever imagine that's what he promised and uh i think uh i i was telling ann um when i seen it the first time i just cried because i and i told her this yesterday i was at work i says nobody knows nobody knows the work that's being done by losema nobody knows i says i don't even know and i don't want to know i don't want the right hand to know what the left hand is doing as it were but this i say we can't do enough for the souls that need to come in we cannot do enough [Music] and uh i just say plant seeds now because they make a difference down the road as we can see amen this is just one of many many areas in different countries down there give all you can because you'll receive the benefits on the other side amen amen let's stand together for the reading of god's word galatians chapter 5. uh last wednesday we spoke on joy and it just it sprung a little thought here for today on the fruit of god before we begin reading here in galatians chapter 5 verse 22 let's look to the author just a moment in prayer heavenly father this this perhaps would be the most important part lord is praying before we read your word knowing lord unless you come and reveal the word we just won't grab exactly what it's for and we need this word living inside of us we need the manifestation of it we humbly pray lord as we look into your word that we could become your word we look in this mirror lords of your word today perhaps as we often have have seen things there that we haven't liked lord we don't want to walk away and forget those things we want to we want to keep them ever before us that we might become in your more in your image and in your likeness your completeness father fill us all with the revelation of your word this morning pray lord god that the power of almighty god would be amongst us in every heart and every life for there are many needs lord there's many of us that need a healing touch from you god our dependency is on you come and touch each life father be with those that are not uh here today lord pray that thy holy ghost surround them today and bless them we commit this service in your hands thank you lord for all that you're doing here in jesus precious name we pray amen amen galatians chapter 5 we can see that there is a a a very struggle uh paul talking about in this uh chapter that that uh we we started out in liberty and and not to be under the yoke of of bondage of this world anymore and that there's spirits out there that would try to persuade us off to be off track and and then he talks about the uh that there's a struggle between the flesh and the spirit and that we got to walk in the spirit and and and serve one another in love and then he he talks about what happens when you're in the flesh and then as it were the fruit of the flesh and then he comes in in verse number two 22 and talks about the fruit of the spirit is love it's joy it's peace longsuffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory uh provoking one another and envying one another amen god bless you may be seated simply want to call this entitle this the fruit of god the fruit of god and for a subject hebrews 13 8 for god is the same yesterday today and forever amen now uh there is a lot of information and it won't hurt my feelings if nobody took notes but you you may but all i can say is we've got a lot of scriptures to go through and i i kind of want you to catch the spirit basically of the word today can always uh go back i can give you copies you can listen to it again i just i want you to grab this but as we go through these i want us to notice that this is this is god in spirit form god is the spirit he's specifically known as the holy spirit of truth often referred to as the comforter the very nature of god is described here or better yet displayed by the fruit of the spirit this is the fruit of god amen love first and foremost god is love first john chapter 4 verse 8 he that loveth not knoweth not god for god is love one of the great characteristics between the spirit of of god and not the spirit of god uh it is simply um god he lives for others and and satan he lives for himself god loves others and satan loves himself is just that simple god's love seeketh not her own where the devil's loves seeks love seeks for himself amen the characteristic of god's nature is displayed in his love because god's nature is truly for the welfare of others and i think if we at time first corinthians chapter 13 would explain and show us a little bit about god's love god is not trying ever to vaulteth himself he's not puffed up to try to be someone he's willing to take a backseat he was born in a manger god sees uh things are not always going to be perfect so he handles them with grace he doesn't act unseemly or inappropriate or offensive he doesn't act out of place he has the ability in all types of problems and situations to endure all sorts of hardships amen all sorts of problems while thinking no evil he's hoping for the best in every situation god has that ability that's why love is so important first and foremost joy we talked about it last service we're reminded of the power that lies within the joy of god god's joy psalms 116 verse 11 thou shalt show the path of life amen he showed us wednesday the path of life in thy presence is fullness of joy at the right hand there are pleasures forevermore for the joy of the lord is our strength showing we need the joy of the lord so we can have strength whatever is going on in our life amen the joy of the lord is what we need peace isaiah chapter 9 verse 6 for unto us a child is born unto us a son is given the government shall be upon his shoulders and his his name shall be called wonderful counselor of the mighty god the everlasting father the prince of peace god is known as the prince of peace think about that a fruit of the spirit he is the principal of peace as much as god is the self-existing one and no one can live without him he will not force his truth upon somebody else for he is the prince of peace he's the god of peace it doesn't force that's what people want to be separated from him that's fine he's a god of peace god wanted abraham and lot servants to be at peace god is truly a peacemaker he broke down the center wall partition between god and man making peace with man he's a peacemaker god is long suffering god has suffered for mankind so long we would have to go back to the garden of eden to see he's been suffering so long god lowered himself and became a human being subject to all the elements that we deal with and he continued to lower himself and humble himself as we sung about it he became obedient unto death the bible says the death of his own will the death of his own body for you and i that's what he humbled himself to [Music] god is very long-suffering not willing the bible says that any should perish and the bible tells us that he's he's patiently waiting today for the precious fruit to come forth so god is is definitely a god that's long suffering we can see the very nature of god displayed in christ as he suffered for our sins and luke 24 verse 26 says ought not christ you have suffered these things and to enter into his glory christ suffered for us amen matthew 23 verse 37 o jerusalem jerusalem thou that kill us the prophets and stone us them that are sent to thee how often would i have gathered thy children together even as a hand gathereth thy chickens under her wings and he would not look at the long suffering of god every time we come to church the word is the word the word can change our lives but he's waiting he's suffering he's waiting for our hearts to get right man it would be better for you to come to church and say my heart is not right rather than come to church and gamble that my heart is right because the fruit can only come forth if the ground is good and sometimes you got to take the hard ground and you got to till it up with prayer and get in there and let god just begin to take that hard clumps and make it such a powder that he can lay the word of his his seed of his word right there and let it come forth you know what happens when you got hard ground i've i've laid grass seed on hard ground so many times i come by and i see it kind of washed to the side just to the wayside but if you can till that up put the seed in there it's got a chance to grow revelations chapter 6 verse 9 and when he opened the fifth seal i saw under the altar the souls of them that were slain for the word of god and for the testimony which they held and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh lord holy and true does thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth god is still long-suffering today with each of us think about it not just them i think about the long-suffering that god has on me and it makes me cry i'm so unworthy i'm not where i need to be with god the very nature of god is manifested in long suffering praise god gentleness god is a real genuine gentleman he doesn't force his agenda on humanity james chapter 3 verse 17 but the wisdom that is from above is first pure peaceable gentle god is gentle easy to be entreated full of mercy and good fruits without partiality and what without hypocrisy god doesn't push himself or his agenda on anybody and we shouldn't have to do that either he has respect and he shows respect now think about this here's the god that deserves all respect he deserved respect from pilate there were two thieves on the cross next to him one was shown respect one was not but god did not disrespect either he's a real gentleman and he's got gentleness about him amen he didn't force himself on the rich young ruler to force him he gave him a choice here it is this is what you need to do and he started walking away he didn't clobber him he didn't do it he just had compassion on him because he was turning around his only chance for eternal life there was no guile found in the mouth of jesus a real gentleness first peter chapter 2 verse 23 when he revived when he was reviled he didn't revile back when he suffered he didn't threaten he was gentle the nature of god is to be gentle and harmless the goodness of god god is so good he's good all the time he's not just good some of the time he's good all the time can you say amen to that every time god created something if you go to the book of genesis every time he created something he stepped back and the bible says and god saw that it was good everything he does is good psalms 31 19 said oh how great is thy goodness psalms 33 5 the earth is full of the goodness of the lord psalms 107 verse 8 how all that men would praise the lord for his goodness and his wonderful works to the children of men every one of us can testify today how good god has been in our life god is good to us faith god is faith that's right god is faith he he operates through faith hebrews chapter 11 verse 3 through faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of god so that the things which are seen were not made of things which do appear so when god looks at your life and he speaks to you his word you can't see it it's invisible but it will come to pass amen i know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord you can't see them it does not yet appear but we know when he comes we shall be like him he's going to give us an expected end because he speaks things into existence not just the mountains not just the animals but he's speaking a restored soul into your life today and his word is doing it little by little as you can receive it everything that god does is through faith whatever he speaks will come to pass because he possesses the substance amen that substance is faith isaiah chapter 55 verse 11 so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which i please and it shall prosper in the thing wherein to i sent it now don't we want god to send his word right here send it lord prosper here change my nature because if he only sends it here right knowledge it just puffs you up but true love and i'll say a revelation from god is true love it'll edify it'll edify amen oftentimes you can see god's faith displayed through his longsuffering anybody can love those that are loving them and patent them on the back but what about when you're going through something amen matthew chapter 17 verse 15 lord have mercy on my son for he is a lunatic and sore vaccine oftentimes he falleth into the fire and often into the water and i brought him to thy disciples and they could not cure him imagine how this was making jesus feel then said gee then jesus answered and said all faithless and perverse generation how long shall i be with you how long shall i suffer you bring him hither to me and jesus rebuked the devil and he departed on him and the child was cured from that very hour now notice jesus took care of the problem because he possessed faith i don't need us to straighten things out just fix the problem i know the only way i can fix the problem is if the problem fixer is in me our faith can be on display even during our trials and our sufferings faith isn't just for hey let's pray over this person and watch this thing happen and everybody sees it and it's like this big thing no it's between you and god amen it's god in you god is not a shulman meekness meekness getting down there meekness means humbleness or matthew 11 verse 29 take my yoke upon you god wants us to take something upon us you know when you go to a college or something all you do is you get money and you learn about god no yolk bunch of head knowledge but he said take my yoke upon you it's the only way you can learn of me for i am meek and lowly in heart and ye shall find rest for your souls god is humble born in a manger as the song goes to his own a stranger he lived with a reputation of being illegitimate amen can you imagine him to live your whole life but he never proved anything never run around trying to prove it he let it be isaiah 53 verse 3. isaiah 53 verse 3 he was despised he was rejected of men a man of sorrows acquainted with grief and we hid our faces from him he was despised and we esteemed him not so as this man that was all god stood and every time we heard about jesus oh we just wanted a hotter face we just wanted to run we didn't want to hear it he was despised and we didn't even care we didn't even esteem him look what happened when he walked but yet it happened in our life as well surely he bore greece and he carried our sorrows yet we did esteem him stricken stricken smitten of god inflicted in other words that he hung there on the cross and they said he's getting what he deserves yes that's what this is saying but he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities it wasn't yet what he deserved he was taking it for us the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his tribes we are healed we just got to claim it don't let the devil keep telling you no just say i'm standing on him he died for me in 2020 he bore those stripes for me in 2020 wasn't just for the past they go all the way up amen to the rapture all we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one of his all uh everyone to his own way and the lord laid on him the iniquity of us all you talk about the love of god he was oppressed he was afflicted yet he opened not his mouth now we're talking about the meekness of god here he is brought as a lamb to the slaughter and as the sheep before his shears is dumb so he opened not his mouth god is meek god is humble we need to take more time to learn about god so we can know what we need to be temperance simply means self-control god is in control he knows he's in control so he just simply controls himself he knows nothing is out of control so there's no need to get really bothered in fact ephesians chapter 1 verse 11 tells us that god worketh all things after the council of his will so when we when we look at this world we look at all just everything whether it's the the wars and the pandemic and whether we should do this and whether we should do that and the rise of this and the politics and all it just wow it looks like such a mess like if i was of the world i guess i would get excited when our president would say we're beefing up our army we got more tanks we got more guns we've got but i am not of this world that doesn't appeal to me but in the midst of all the chaos that we look at in the world god has got it under control god is still making everything work out for his purpose that's how much he's in control pharaoh was just a tool that god used to get glory for himself think about all the plagues and the crossing over the red sea all this that that moses really didn't know what was going on he had to walk by faith one step at a time until god showed him but god was in control wants total control of the church because this is a place where it's free more agency we can sit here and yield our heart and yield our life or we can sit here just like a bump on a log and say i'm not going any further than my church attendance colossians chapter 1 verse 16. colossians chapter 1 verse 16 for by him were all things created that are in heaven that are in the earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions or principalities or powers all things were created by him and for him i i'm thinking that that includes me and he is before all things and by him all things consist and he is the head of the body the church praise god send the light amen amen who is the beginning the firstborn of the dead that in all things he might have what the preeminence he wants to be more than just a picture on a wall at church he wants more than just to be able to to to be uh songs in the book that we sing about he wants he wants it to be more than just reading from the bible he don't want just the sermon to just be preached uh about him no sir he wants the preeminence in the heart of his church wow this this responsibility just got off of the pulpit and it went into the congregation i can't make that for you and i'll tell you if i could i'd spend thousands tens of thousands i'd spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to get you entertainment in here to get god to be preeminent in your life but god would never get preeminent in your life doing that it's about your seriousness with god now when believers don't want to give god preeminence or things are out of control in the church that ever happened god doesn't force his control listen to me he has self-control he displays a temperance so how does god take control what does he do he leads and guides us back into order how does he do it he works on our hearts he deals with our hearts he takes preeminence he does everything decently and in order he's an awesome god i love the nature of god god is love joy peace long-suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is no law there's no law against the nature of god how can there be anything against the nature of god god is every one of these this is the living spirit of god that's bearing its own fruit every single one of these they are the fruit of god now we are promised the same holy spirit if we repent we get baptized and i'll tell you sometimes there's things in her life from the time you get baptized you are going to prove your repentance we're told if we're baptized a sinner will come up a wet center now it is not for me to ever judge another man these are for you but i'm going to tell you your life is going to prove where you're at and that's why it'd be good for us to judge ourselves using this precious word i want to encourage every one of us today to seek more of the holy spirit we are promised the same holy spirit that we just read about amen i think we can become too content with how much of god's spirit we really have too satisfied with just saying oh i've got the holy ghost or trying to make others think and believe that you got it oh yeah i've got the holy spirit no one can talk me out of it i know it i know i for sure got it and sometimes the believers can get offended when you challenge them about something that's going on in their life the fact is most of the time believers don't even pay attention to their own fruit of their spirit many times they feel completely justified defending the things that they've said the actions they've taken the behavior they've displayed just as if the holy ghost inside of them was doing it wow too many believers ignore their own spirit they ignore the fruit of their own spirit now i'm so glad that jesus taught us we shall know what's going on by the fruit that's being born you can know a lot what's going on by the fruit that's coming forth james told us you can't get sweet water and bitter water coming from the same fountain i don't see anything in these fruits that's talking about uh dinner now look at these these are all sweet love joy peace i just want to be filled with them now we can start moving away from that type of thinking of all that matters is that i can just stand and say i've got the holy ghost there's no need to brag about how much holy spirit we have all that we need to do is start bearing the actual fruit of the spirit for everyone to see and for everyone to partake of you see because the fruit of the holy spirit is for others the seed is in the fruit and when they see the life they're going to want the seed they're going to want to eat that and when they eat it they've got to eat the word because the fruit comes from the word jesus is the word people don't want my love people don't want your love they don't want your joy your peace why because it's limited they can get that anywhere what people really want to see is the fruit of god in your life that never stops that endures all things that that believeth all things that hopeth all things that's that stands the test that has the temperance the patience the love the joy the peace that god has that's what people are looking for the fruit of god is for others to eat and live the holy spirit inside of us will bear the same fruit of god's spirit amen now i really want that to sink home because jesus is the same yesterday today and forever if that same spirit that we just read about lives in us it can't but help to bear the same fruit and if it's not it's up to you to ask for more don't just say i got it anyways just ask god for more it will automatically bear sheep don't have to force to grow the wall it just bears it it's an automatic god don't try to bear these fruits they're just automatic now there's a lot of spirits out in the world they try to mimic the holy ghost when it speaks to us first john chapter 4 verse 1. and if you would i'd like to go to this one on the screen if i could at least to kind of pay attention this beloved don't believe every spirit that speaks to you but try the spirit whether it's of god because many false spirits are gone out into the world in other words it's not trying to be a respecter of persons the devil's seeking whom he may devour whoever he can get so how do i know what's speaking to me hereby know ye the spirit of god every spirit that confesseth that jesus has come into your flesh is of god in other words if your flesh is bearing the fruit of the spirit then go on and say what you're saying act the way you're acting do what you're doing but if it's not you pay attention to that spirit because if god's spirit isn't in my flesh the but let's read it and every spirit that confesseth not if your spirit is not confessing jesus christ has come into your flesh it is not of god now notice what's confessing it's the spirit it is not the words it's not your ideas it's the spirit that's coming forth and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world ye are of god little children and you've overcome those spirits that lie to you why because there's something greater in you than he that is in the world in other words the spirit that's inside of you is bearing god's fruit you know to me it doesn't matter how much i confess i've got the holy spirit i am not going to be satisfied until i awake in his likeness until i'm bearing the fruit of the holy ghost that's all that matters and the thing is i can't tell if i'm bearing it until i go through a trial until i go through a test and then it really shows what i got shows what the tea bags ready made when i get in the hot water we are of god verse 4 ye are of god little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you that he that is in the world they are of the world therefore they speak of the world and the world heareth them you know so many people get you know we've had i don't just speak it's history bill clinton got up and said i'm born again and you know what the world here with them the world here with them a lot of people oh i got the holy ghost i got the holy ghost people here the world heareth them but the bride sees the fruit because jesus taught us by their fruit you shall know them and there's a lot of false spirits there going out there lying to the church all you got to do is speak in tongues just one time that's the proof we are so blessed today because we have a revelation of the truth it should put us in debt to the lord amen that we should want to get the truth to somebody and it it takes time you got to lay season you got to keep it going keep it going we are of god and he that knoweth god heareth us and he that and he that is not of god here is not us you know you've got the truth somebody rejects you they're rejecting god think about that you hold the word of truth inside of you you have a treasure in earth and vessels amen hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of air wow you know i remember going to school and they've just always used to be afraid of taking tests i need to continue preaching not talk about my stories because it's getting late but i was always afraid i don't know if i know it but when you know the spirit of god is in you you don't have to worry about controlling yourself because god's inside you doing it fear is gone perfect love casts out all fear amen the fruits ought to be for our lives saints and we need to keep pressing in to them until we see them manifest in their life the fruit of the spirit is love first or saint john 3 16 for god so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that showing god's love but first john chapter 3 says that we he lay down his life for us we ought to lay down our lives for the brethren hereby is hereby we perceive we the love of god we perceive god's love in one another when we see them lay down their life for one another i'm sorry that's scripture anything else is not scripture to me you know we want about to treat anybody any old way we want to and say we've got the love of god i can't see that in the bible i see that we're blind the bible says i'm blind i want to perceive god's love in every single one of you i want to perceive it and you perceive it too we all are written epistles read of all men scene of all men we don't have to open our mouth and we're talking now love inside of us will not think ill of his neighbor will not talk behind their back well not gossip about somebody is not going to badger someone's testimony or reputation the love of god inside of us will lay down our life for everyone jesus gave us the great commandment that we love one another as he has loved us brother branham says that we need to get to the spot to where we can love everyone the same get to the place it's not just talk now but when you're tested and your life proves out that you got it by this fruit of god shall all mankind know that you're a disciple of christ when you have god's great love what on display on display by the same manifestation of his love when you're laying down your life for somebody for a for mankind for a soul to help somebody's character joy well we heard a lot about joy on wednesday the difference between god's joy and our own joy we learned where it comes from and how to get it we learned how important and how powerful it is that the joy of the lord is our strength we've also learned that we have to stay connected to the vine and keep his commandments in order for god's joy to remain with us amen and we have a god-given promise that our sorrow will return into joy i want to read it john chapter 16 verse 20 verily verily i say unto you that ye shall weep and lament and the world will rejoice the world will rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but your sorrow shall be turned into joy there's something about god wanting he has compassion on those that are out of the way he wants to revive him something about inside of god he just wants to help people a woman when she is in travail have sorrow because your hours come but as soon as she is delivered of the child she remembers no more the anguish for joy that a man is born into the world praise god and ye now uh and ye now therefore have sorrow but i will see you again and your heart shall rejoice and your joy no man taketh from you think about that blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god you want to see god today you the only way you can really see god is to get a revelation from him that's where you see god clearly you want to see god clearly he's interested in the heart blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see god and i'll tell you when god gives you a revelation you've got joy it does not matter if that revelation tells you you need to lay down your life more you need to pray more i'm telling you there'll be tears of joy flowing because you're seeing god face to face david said i want to get to the house of the lord i want to behold the beauty of the lord in the temple i want to see it with my eyes we're not looking at the outside we're not looking for some entertainment or how smooth the the service goes we're looking to see jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever revealing his words in our hearts that's the beauty i want to see peace when jesus ascended on high he didn't take his peace with him he didn't say sorry buds i'm taking this with me no sir john 14 27 saint john 14 27 peace i leave with you my peace i give unto you not as the world giveth give i unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid god left his peace for the church he left it for his children he left it for his wife we need the peace of god in our church we and i'll tell you this is how you get it get the peace of god in your heart john 16 33 these things have i spoken unto you that ye might have peace what things in the world you're gonna have a lot of problems but be of good cheer i've overcome the world and if i live in you you ain't got nothing to worry about i've got it all under control ephesians chapter 2 verse 14 he is our peace amen he is our peace so when we don't got peace just get in god's presence i'll tell you there's one thing that has always helped me is prayer it doesn't always change the circumstance but it changed what's happening right here it changes how i see and i react to what's happening out here isaiah 55 verse 12 for ye shall go out with joy and be led forth what with peace i wish i had time to teach this and i don't but maybe you could go back and get into dig into it too often we're not led by the right spirit but we need to be led with peace the mountains and the hills shall break forth until singing and all the trees of the field shall clap their hands amen matthew 5 9 blessed are the peacemakers for those are the ones that are going to be called the children of god a peacemaker i certainly don't want to be guilty of starting a fight but i want to be a peacemaker in order to be a peacemaker i got to get my hands dirty because there already is in peace i gotta make it to get my hands dirty i may look bad in both parties eyes but eventually when there's peace they may completely forget about me and that's okay as long as god doesn't forget you know a lot of times god's done stuff for people there were nine lepers one time they got healed all nine of them didn't come back but there was one there was one that was grateful there was one that was thankful there was one that wanted to give god more and god he really shined the light on his character when he said were there not ten where are the other nine god deserves to give to be given all the praise as often as we can for everything he does for us count your blessings name them one by one it will surprise you what god has done long suffering no one wants to suffer everyone wants to sit at the table next to jesus jesus his response to that was can you drink the cup that i drink when somebody wanted to sit next to jesus on the other side well that cup was a cup of suffering we all want to be next to jesus but nobody wants to suffer if we don't suffer with him we don't reign with him if we're not willing to to to lay down our life so that christ can be seen by others how is god going to look at that and say you know what i want to be by that because that's exactly what jesus did for you i am telling you this is a fruit of the holy ghost it may not be a fruit of our life and we may not want to suffer and i understand that but if christ is in you he will suffer he will gladly lay down his life he will gladly take the blood for something he didn't do wrong and he'll take it patiently and this is acceptable with god but if you've got to prove who's right all the time i say there's something wrong with your spirit there is something wrong with it you know many times god is buffeted and turned away and discredited men take glory from god all the time just let them do it the spirit of god and a human being i'm telling you it will change our nature we will become like jesus christ because he is the same yesterday today and forever if that same spirit that rose jesus christ from the dead quickens your moral body lives inside your body it'll quicken your nature it'll make you just like jesus and you can't do nothing about it you'll get slapped in the face and you won't even have a thought well i'll tell you if i had something inside he says oh god forgive they don't know what they're doing i'll give one more chance peter in the flesh said seven times seven times what are you talking about that's not the right spirit seven times 70 is the right spirit it's not us trying to build is us displaying what we are yeah that's what's happening to the spiritual eye it's not hard to see when jesus said you shall know them by their fruits i don't listen to a people's to a person's words i'll sure pay attention to the fruit they're barren because words are deceiving but you know satan used them on jesus to try to trick him you know he's used them on me and he has deceived me you know the elect won't be deceived but did you know until the rapture they can be the thing about being elect eventually you're going to come out of whatever deception you've been in that's the beauty about being elected it's not being so perfect today you know saints i am like so sorry i i i don't know what time i started but i'm nowhere near going through and i just feel always bad about taking too long i just say if anybody feels you know to leave then i want you to feel that liberty i don't want you to feel forced to stay here for any any reason but i do believe and i from the beginning of the service i know god is in this and he has this for the hearts of those that are his amen i believe that first peter chapter 2 verse 21 for even her and two were you called because christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that we need to follow his steps you know too many people they're like oh that that's a step of suffering oh i'm getting over that one they don't want to follow his steps second timothy chapter 2 verse 29 wherein i suffer trouble even as an evil doer unto my bonds but the word of god is not bound therefore i endure all things from my brother from my sister well they're not even in the message it doesn't they could be the elect's sake i endure a bunch of junk for the elect's sake that they may also obtain the salvation which is in christ jesus with eternal glory it is a faithful saiyan for if we be dead with him we should also live with him if we suffer we shall also reign if we deny him or deny us i don't want to deny the lord if i step over that step of suffering i'm denying him come on if he's like he led jesus to the slaughter we gotta cross the bear too if we're gonna just oh let this cut pass from me how are we going to be a partaker amen of long suffering i mean you don't have to be a christian people are suffering like crazy out there in the world but they're not suffering as a christian there's no character involved there's no building there's no purpose they re they they resent the fact that they're suffering they can't see the elect's sake they can't see a reason to lay down their life to reach out to to go the second mile because they're blind help us lord gentleness the holy spirit inside of a human being will be a gentle lamb nature nobody wants to be around somebody that you're scared you're afraid but a gentle nature yeah easy to being treated sounds like the wisdom of god matthew 10 verse 16. now we live in a real bad world out here right put yourself where jesus is speaking to your heart right now behold i send you forth as sheeps as sheeps no as sheep in the midst of wolves now that's a scary situation right there listen i don't want you to get your baseball bats out i don't want you to get your boxing gloves on i don't want you to get your machine guns be ye therefore wise as serpents and harmless as dubs because if god is in you you have nothing to worry about but if god ain't with you you know i don't think there's enough guns you can carry he says but be aware of men for they will deliver you up to council and they will scourge you right in their church what's the evidence why is this a serpent harmless as a delft that's what the holy spirit's for god will work it out he tell them take no thought what you will think what you will say when they deliver you i will give you words of wisdom at that moment when you need it this is the holy ghost i want i want the old-fashioned holy ghost i want something that really has meat to it something that can change my nature something where i got peace inside second timothy chapter 2 verse 24 and the serpent of the lord how many is a servant of god today praise god and the servant of the lord must not strive that means quarrel dispute or fight but be gentle unto all men apt to teach patient patient god work it out that's what the patience is for i have to teach sometimes i don't know what to do sometimes i don't know what to say you know what that does drives me to prayer that's where i need to be i need to get with the instructor he's the professor he's the captain of our salvation he's the rock amen he's all i need chapter 3 verse 2 to speak evil of no man to be no brawlers but gentle showing all meekness unto your best friends oh that's not i'm sorry unto all men what about the evil men the mean men the forward i think the bible tells me that i'm supposed to be subject to the forward not like just the good bosses all men god wants us representing him he does not really care about what problem that we're in we all want to whine complain about our problems well you know you you anybody come up here and tell me who's got the biggest problem in the church who's got the worst one because as soon as you determine which is that it's going to change in about an hour so god is not interested in that he's interested in being on display in those problems that's what he wants he wants a preeminence in that situation you can't be let god have preeminence if you're not willing to suffer if you're not willing to be gentle if you're not willing to be meek and humble and lay down your life amen goodness proverbs 20 verse 6 most men will proclaim everyone his own goodness but a faithful man who can find one who displays god who the one who displays the goodness of god that's a faithful man but a man that displays his own goodness proclaims his own goodness that's not faithful everybody wants to do that romans chapter 2 verse 3 and think as thou this old man that judgeth them which do such things and do us the same how in the world are you going to escape the judgment of god or despises thou the riches of his goodness and forbearance and long-suffering you know sometimes we just despise having to be long suffering despising to be forbearance with somebody despising to be good to your enemy like jesus taught us to not knowing this is the ignorance not knowing it's the goodness of god that leads a man to repentance it's the very goodness of god that turns people around it's not his threats right when they came against him he didn't threaten back when you're trying to turn somebody around or lead them in a better way be good to them be good to them it's the goodness of god that can turn the situation around faith hebrews chapter 11 verse says without faith we can't even make god happy you ever try to do some for somebody and they just can't seem to get happy with it no matter what you do we've all been in that spot i did what you asked me to do i you're still not happy god will not be happy with us until we believe him we can't stay in a in a mental spiritual frame of mind that's filled with doubt or or or negative thinking or double-minded the bible says let not that man think that he'll receive anything of the lord we've got to believe the word i don't know if i can live it god is not asking you to to to uh prophesy the future just say amen to the word amen to the word be like that barber yeah uh read all about it i can see blind is a bat yeah but still testifying is faith amen amen i just say brother ben testify more of what god's doing what you've already prayed for believe it believe it testify stand on it there's a period there that after you get prayed for god's gonna god wants to see if you're gonna testify of what you've already prayed for jesus said they think they'll be heard for their much speaking but you're really going to be hurt for your much faith sometimes the prophet has said this if you pray over and over it weakens your faith what you need to do is be testifying of your faith i believe by not allowing doubt to come in and cloud your thoughts in in imagination you got to possess the gate of the enemy amen you got to stand there and say this is mine give me this mountain i'm a i'm a i'm a seed of god i'm with joshua and caleb i'm not with all those that are questioning they're doubting they're full of fear i stand with god's chosen few we're children of abraham the bible says we're saved by faith the bible says we live by faith the only way god's going to be happy with us galatians 2 verse 20 i am crucified with christ nevertheless i lived yet not i but it's christ that liveth in me so paul was actually saying here because he's the one that wrote this to the galatians these fruits that i'm bearing this ability to lay down my life to get stoned and whipped and kicked and talked of and deceived by my own brethren in the he church it's not me it's not me and my moral ability to to be something no it's christ he's living in me that's why it's so important to seek the holy ghost you get that you get the whole package you get the benefits [Music] you know some some people they don't even care about the money they just want the benefits get that health insurance you know get the retirement get the aflac 401k matching funds tell you this honestly you know this work doesn't pay very good here but the benefits are out of this world get the holy ghost you got the benefits who cares about saying i got it your life will be able to display it nobody will bow to deny it that will speak louder than your words faith comes from god it does not come from the pulpit flesh and blood does not reveal to you the word it's god and you while the word is coming where are you in god when the word is being preached because that's faith faith is a revelation all things are possible to them that believe well i have this need believe believe i believe testify stan don't let satan come well he's just you know this is just not my thing right it's impossible for any minister up here to get any to get everybody's thing right let's all go to a restaurant and see how many get your thing most are going to order something different what's important they were in the upper room they were all wanted god didn't matter how it came they wanted god to me our thoughts should be when we come to church i'm going into the upper room i just want more of god i want more of the living word inside of me amen i'm sorry i have to close i i can't i can't finish let's stand together i just want to say a couple things i and i'm sorry i'm sorry but i just i know the preachers here i know he's here because i couldn't even get through my notes you say you belong to christ and that you've got the holy ghost if you look at galatians chapter 5 verse 22 and 23 they tell us what the fruits of the spirit is if i can just get that up there in for just a second i'm so sorry here are the fruits of the spirit now we say we belong to christ and we've got the holy ghost can you say amen to that statement all right let's look at the very next verse verse 24 and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and the lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us not be desirous of vain glory provoking one another or envying one another now if we have the holy spirit if we are christ i'm telling you what's happening there is a self-crucifixion in your life because there's no way that god is able to be preeminent unless you do your part and be crucified crucify your god ain't gonna do that for you you have got to crucify your flesh with the affections and the desires in order to let the spirit walk through you and display this fruit brother gideon sent me a quote the day before yesterday and i want to read it in closing in the message is your life worthy of the gospel brother iran said pray god to let the light of this day rise in you to be obedient servants to god and then let the fruit of the spirit ever remain in your life and this and that is a life worthy of the gospel let me say this in closing brother branham said the only way the only way he says it two times the only way that you can live a life that's worthy of the gospel is to let the gospel itself every bit of that gospel come into you and reflect his promise back we're the moon or not the sun sun just reflects i mean the moon just reflects what the sun gives the only way that we can bear this is to let god the gospel the living word come and live inside of us and reflect back that's what god wants to see right when he shines down if that goal has got a lot of pyrite into it he's not seeing his reflection very good he got to keep beating until he can see himself god wants to see himself reflect off of you boom there's little jesus little messiahs look how they're loving one another look how they're talking look how they're laying down their life look how they understand that the other person isn't where they need to be but they're still loving amen that's a life that he says is worthy of the gospel that's the life i want is that the life you want amen bow your heart with me heavenly father we come to you in the close of the service knowing lord as we look in as we've looked into your word we're seeing our shortcomings we've seen lord sometimes emphasizing we have your spirit and neglecting the fruit of our lives lord we're asking that you would take all of our hearts right now as certainly they're in one mind and one accord we're so sorry for coming short of your glory for not reflecting the life that you want us to we know you sent that holy spirit back for the church lord we want you to have preeminence in our life we want you like you bragged to lucifer about job he said have you not considered my servant job there is none like him he's perfect he's complete he has he has all of me and he was put through the test because the devil did not believe the word of god today lord we know that you still want to break about your bride in this hour living in this horrible evil age i believe there's some hearts here that want to be able to stand and say i want to pass that test i want to be a representative lord that you could look to and say there's my first string there's my luck lady there's my bride i'm calling on her i know she can win this for us she can see us or she can pass the test god i pray for every heart i know inside their hands are their hands are lifted their their desires to be all of you lord i pray that you'd give them the desire of their hearts may they have confidence that you're you're seeing their desire today bless them with faith that as they leave here today that without some under intellectual understanding but of faith that they will manifest you lord in that hour god let there be testimonies let there be testimonies god that you're manifesting your life in the middle of test and trials oh god i know that's what you want to see may the does this the spirit of god bring forth the fruit of god in each one of our lives we pray we thank you for these things lord we ask in jesus christ's name amen praise the lord fill my cup lord i lift it up lord come and quench this thirsting of my soul [Music] here's my car pill it up you
