precious faith that love you and want to give you the praise that you're worthy of lord we thank you for this opportunity lord we know that it may not uh be long before it'll be so difficult lord to come and have this liberty so we are extra grateful for it today lord and all the more as we see the day approaching fathers we enter into this part of the service lord we're asking you to continue to have your own way may you speak the word of life to us may it become revealed to us may we see more plainly more clearly our position with you lord lord we commit the furtherance of the service in your hands we ask god that you meet the many needs that would be amongst us for we commit them all into your hands now by faith in jesus christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you turn with me if you would to the book of second corinthians chapter four we're going to have three scriptural readings before we have you be seated amen and as we're as you're turning there i want to let you know the the subject today is the process of manifesting christ so as we're reading these scriptures i want us to be thinking about the process of manifesting christ entitled this message unveiling of christ in your life amen second corinthians chapter four starting with verse number 16 for which calls we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight of glory while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are eternal amen and then colossians chapter one colossians chapter one i'm wondering how come i'm not hearing very many of the pages you know turning you all got your bible don't you colossians chapter 1 starting with verse number 26 even the mystery which have been hid from ages and from generations but now is made manifest to his saints to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory whom we preach warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom for the purpose that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus whereunto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily amen and then just first john chapter 3 first john chapter 3. very familiar scripture of course this whole book ought to become feel very familiar to us amen first john chapter 3 verse number 1 behold verse 1 behold what matter of love the father bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of god therefore the world knoweth us not because it knew him not beloved now are we the sons of god and it doth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we shall see him as he is and every man that have this hope in him purifyeth himself even as he is pure amen god bless you you may be seated may the lord have his way with each of us tonight amen i really like what brother ron said it's our responsibility to lift up christ that's right if we don't do it nobody else is going to that's right amen how many has been trying to remember all the benefits of the lord since last service it's not always easy when we're caught up in different things but i want us to remember it is our responsibility to the lord he said forget not putting the responsibility upon us means we no longer can say oh i'm sorry i forgot you know how often we've said that to one another oh i'm sorry i forgot lord put the responsibility in us to remember all the benefits that he's given us it's a benefit just to come here to the house of the lord that's why brother branham said we ought to have that attitude i can't wait to get there i can't wait to those doors because of the benefit that we have amen well i want to start off by saying we are a seed of god amen and it brings comfort and security to know that now are we the sons of god that's right amen right now right now we are a son of god amen but it also brings forth the responsibility to manifest that just not get quiet on that part because we have to manifest what we say we are and every man that has this hope inside of him he purifies himself if we always remain a seed and never manifest it will never fulfill the purpose in which it was brought forth jesus said unless the seed dies and falls into the ground unless it rots it abides alone so our death is this outside nature has to come off to manifest christ amen so the seed of god is not satisfied with just saying i'm a seed of god amen it just it doesn't work anymore there's a deep calling inside of the bride to manifest christ and it's an honor it's a privilege we've got to manifest christ in the flesh in this age more than any other age that there's been more word has been given so more more of manifestation is required in the age of pentecost well we can manifest the gifts and it wouldn't even really matter what seed you were because the rain falls on the just in the unjust sea and gifts are given out elvis presley had a gift that's true but in this age the last age the bride will be like christ will manifest the nature of christ and it's a responsibility in the day that john lived he said it did not yet appear what we shall be but the mystery had been hid from ages and from generation and now is made manifest to the saints to whom god would make known the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory that's the whole mystery now amen how hard it is to to get somebody to believe that god is in you trying to talk to them about what they need to be doing god is making this mystery known he's unveiling himself not just behind a pulpit but he's unveiling himself in the pride we are his bride he's unveiling in your temple whom we preach warning every man and teaching every man in all wisdom that we may present every man perfect in christ jesus we see the reason of a fivefold ministry because that five-fold ministry is to present us perfect yes amen the message of the hour was not to warn every man about denominations and that god sent a prophet that was not the reason this message was to present us perfect to jesus christ a bride without spot or wrinkle that's what this message was for so we could manifest that jesus is the same yesterday today and forever yes part of that that message that message that the prophet brought showing that the discernment and speaking at the well and telling what's happening in your life and those were the the things that attracted that attracted the woman at the well that attracted the people in this age and he tried and he said look jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever but that was not the end of hebrews 13 8 that was the beginning for the bride we now have to become the manifestation of that we too have to manifest christ brother branham was the sh the wave chief for this age whereunto i also labor striving according to his working which worketh in me mightily paul was faithful warning every man teaching every man in all wisdom and he didn't have a respect to persons he wanted everyone to be perfect he carried a burden he didn't have favorites just like jesus he don't got favorites he gives everybody a chance he gave judas a chance he didn't treat the others better than judas and when the the power of god is so strong in your life you can't even think with respect to persons you don't think about what somebody did to use you to hurt you to talk behind your back you don't even think like that because the love of god think is no evil all these warnings and teaching and wisdom and sanctifying and cleansing with the washing of the water by the word can often seem overwhelming as we're going through the process we barely make it through the day we think we've achieved something by making it to church but i'll just say it like this these warnings and these teachings and this correcting the sanctifying this washing it's needful in the process of manifesting christ will never be able to let christ shine forth without it second corinthians chapter 4 verse 16 for which calls we faint not for the which cause we faint not but though our outward man perish yet the inward man is renewed day by day amen how is that outward man perishing the word comes forth and it cuts off the carnality the flesh that old nature that word does the carving and the old man is perishing and you feel so like i'm losing control of my life and i don't get to do what i want and but the inward man is being renewed god don't leave you they're cut his life shines forth for our light affliction which is but for a moment worketh for us a far more exceeding an eternal weight of glory so you know it's on the balance here right i'm going to make a trade with you i'm going to sell my car to you i'm going to sell my car for five hundred thousand dollars and you're going to buy it well he's going to get a a a fifty thousand dollar car and i'm gonna get five hundred thousand dollars that's a good deal for me not a good deal for him not a good deal for our flesh but it's a real good deal for our inner man the things that we got to give up the obedience to the word of god the the laying down our lord it's a light affliction it's only going to last a little bit but what's going to we're gonna get out of it amen is love joy peace i'll tell you to be about to have love no matter what anybody does to me the the value of the realness of that cannot be bought or compared with anything in this world because you cannot mimic that you can try you can't get worn by a painted picture amen this process of putting off the old and letting the seed of god manifest it's like you're a seed of god you're uh god is in you the light's in you the holy ghost is in you and all you have to do is take the bushel off the light you just got to take the flesh off of god i hope you're catching it verse 18 while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal i got this going on i've got that going on i got that's our all scene we've got to look at what's not seen we've got to have a vision of christ in us the hope of glory [Music] i want to say a few things about michelangelo brother branham talked about michelangelo brother alex talked about michelangelo brother bruce talked about michelangelo i would like to say a few things about michelangelo he was a famous italian renaissance artist and considered by some to be the greatest sculptor of all times of history amen now i can relate to some of the things that he believed in one of those things is he believed in a continual process his parting words at age 88 which at that time you were fortunate if you lived to 40. his parting words at 88 this is his parting words at 88 years old he said i'm still learning he believed in the continual process he was a visionary he didn't have an attitude of let's just get this thing done and get out of the way let's just get church done you know i got things i got to do one of his famous quotes couple of i'm going to read two of them he said every block of stone has a statue inside of it it is the task of the sculpture to discover it another one is i saw the angel in the marble and i carved until i set him free he saw moses inside that marble and he chipped away until moses was there that's exactly what god wants to do in our lives he has a vision the image of his son inside of us amen and he wants to chip away that old carnal nature until only thing left is the image of jesus christ now he has predestinated us to this image yes he sees his son in you and wants to carve away until you have been set free from your flesh it's the only thing that's holding his back his flesh set free to serve him in the way that you've been predestinated to serve him we believe in predestination amen not just salvation what predestinated to manifest christ and we have that opportunity all day long in every situation especially when we're going into the furnace when we're getting thrown in the lion's den when we're god uses the tools of the fivefold ministry to keep chick chipping away and carving away at the things that are in our life he's the potter we're the clay the song goes have thine own way thou at the potter i am the clay mow me and make me after thy will while i am waiting yielded and still we need to be still know that it's god who's doing the chipping away it isn't some man behind the pulpit say you need to be better [Music] listen there's a man here and there's a man there we are in the flesh but we are also a spirit man we have an inward man and it's up to us to be in the spirit when the word of the spirit of the word is being preached amen because if it falls on the wrong ground a carnal mindset well then we're gonna have a pitchfork that belongs to somebody else i'm not do i'm fine or we're going to become judgmental about what's being said i want you to think about this the only thing that the sculpture does is carve away what isn't the image he never cuts away at the image itself he leaves the image intact so you don't have to worry about the word unchristianizing you how many wants to be in his image then you say amen to the word and don't get critical of the preaching great peace have they that loved thy law and nothing shall offend them i want you to think about your your your walk with the lord god is wanting to carve away everything that's around you that nature that anything that isn't of god to take it away so he can shine out of you that's all he's trying to do amen the thing is that old nature ain't coming off in you unless you say yes lord yes take it lord take it take it take it i'm sick of it take it out of here he can't go against your will if your heart's desires to be in his image then eagerly hunger for the word to carve away every part that's hiding the image of christ inside you because now you are the son of god today you are well what are we waiting for we're waiting for that to manifest to so the world can see you know they're not going to see until you get hot water when everything's going good oh yes i'm a christian i love everybody but just wait everything's against you wait till the chips are down that is the time to shine arise and shine the prophet said instead of sitting at the seed of judgment in church dissecting the preaching let the word carve away your carnality your old nature your excuses your selfishness your pride and anything that god's speaking to you just let him have his way hold over my being absolute sway filled with thy spirit till all shall see christ only always living in me yeah we can go out there and we can leave here and we can be so determined that we're going to do something for christ be be something handle a certain situation and the rest of time just be yourself this is the hour of the unveiling of christ in the bride this is where we shine amen this is our hour more than any other hour it's like i don't want to know what i know and i want to know what you know i want to see christ in you you want to see christ in me i want to see christ in me because it is the hope of glory christ in me not christ knowledge not quoting but christ in me manifested because if christ is in you he will manifest you walk around a person that's so full of the love of god and tell me you won't feel it brother branham just let me just talk to you just a moment he would know what spirit he's dealing with it's invisible but you can see there's the fruit of the spirit right now you cannot see joy or peace in my heart you give me enough time it will be manifested we just want this shell to come off you've got to vision what god visions of you god knows exactly the image we are to be and how our nature is supposed to be did you know god is excited to go to church i want you to think about that we often think about whether we want to go whether we're excited to go is there we've even been to a place of trying to make an excuse so we didn't have to go but god is actually excited for church to meet with us and to work with us because he sees a masterpiece coming and he's inspired to carve away the worldly nature he's the anointed word not a dead letter an anointed word of power hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 says for the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing that's under the soul and spirit the joints of marrow and as a discerner the thoughts and intents of the heart amen god comes to carve away everything that's not his image that's what the word does now you respect the word and you say that's god or you dilute the word and you say that's just a man come on what's he doing when he's going to church he's cutting away everything that's not him he so long wants to see himself in us now we've already testified we are a seed we are a son of god it's time to let everything else go so it can shine it's it there's nothing more to this it's simple god is hid in simplicity we keep wrestling god don't want isms in the church that's not manifesting christ well i wouldn't do this if they wouldn't do this that's like saying i'd be a christian if everybody else was your light supposed to shine when there's not you know the true church is not the building you're in charge of your church you're in charge of your church let it shine let your church be full praises to god amen god is inspired every time you come to church he's inspired to carve away your nature he knows how to do it just like michelangelo he just he he saw the angel in there he saw moses in there he saw what he wanted to see in that marble and he did not want to come close to chipping at the real image that he saw god don't want to chip away at what is good that's going on in your life he's not trying to chip away christ he's trying to chip away the things that aren't amen we just got to get out of the carnality of you know why does he keep saying this and why is it why isn't it just uplifting can you imagine the marbles hey put that back that hurt it wasn't part of the image god knows what he's doing we just got to be serious mature about what church is about amen when we listen to a tape it isn't to find something just encouraging it isn't just about finding something new or verifying something we want verified it's about becoming more in his image and that takes a dying and a rottening out god is coming to church to unveil christ in you the hope of glory he wants to see himself reflected in our lives christ only always living in me amen and that's through the power it can only be through the power of the holy ghost living inside of us now he wants to speak his word and he wants you to speak the word yes remember at the at the end of this masterpiece of the fine-tuning of the sandpapers and the files and the polishing it was so real i've actually spent time uh studying the the sculpture moles i don't know if you've ever seen pictures of it but it is amazing it is amazing you look at it and it shows power in his muscles horns coming from his head he's getting ready to get off the seat he's got the commandments it's just powerful at the end this is as far you know legend says but it was so real to him he wanted moses to speak when we become so much in his image brother adam says he gives you the chapbook whatever you see wants you to speak the word it takes a maturity to take that word and believe it it is jesus christ speaking it out of your mouth and not just you it needs to become that real to you romans chapter 8 verse 29 says for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among us right so we're predestinated not just to be a child of god but a manifested child of god yes there's the responsibility comes in we can say amen to the i'm a child of god amen i'm predestinated now we need to say amen i'm going to manifest more i'm going to allow that word to carve away what's what's not him in my life and though none go with me if i'm the only one in the church lord let it be me that's what we need don't look to the left don't look to the right don't don't compare yourself with anybody what's important is that this word is number one in your life brother branham speaking on michelangelo and enticing spirits he said it cost him his life and when he got to where he thought it was so perfect he become so thrilled at the image of moses so he struck it uh struck the knee of it and said speak moses it looked so real it was so patterned so perfect until it looked so much like moses to his thought that he struck it with the hammer to make it have feeling god wants you to feel like you are his bride amen that there is nothing to fear that you can stand upon the word and that word is for you to have the feeling of christ living inside of you that then somebody slaps you on the cheek you can turn the other one if somebody asks you to do something you say no i'll do that i'll give two miles for you feeling with it he wants you to believe that you're a believer that you can live this word not just some religious talk but a christ like walk he said puts in the mind of the church no matter how much you substitute how big a congregation you get or how well you sing songs or how good your congregation dresses how much you got this that or the other you could strike and feel whatever i'll never it'll never take the place of the life until christ comes down in the form of the holy ghost into that church and gives it a new experience of being born again amen it'll never take place of god's word god's word stands alone so notice what we're trying to get is the realness of christ to come forth the whole world is oh yeah i got christ and i can prove it some prove it with tongues some prove it their names on the book some prove it with my mom and my dad and and i've gotten baptized and i had this thing happen to me and god used me and god did this and that's wonderful but what about just simply your life being lived in a mess messy world where are you standing in those situations we don't want to turn it on and off this is the time to to get to for us to look at our lives and realize that we're not where we need to be and what we need to do is get rid of this old nature so christ can shine and women he can come into church with that and say god share all my rights away amen that just pleases the lord god's hidden simplicity like that you know god is not wanting to carve a little of your flesh away just so we can pretend we got the rest he doesn't want to dress you in some kind of carnal form of godliness he doesn't want a substitute he wants us to have the genuine image shining forth and the only way it can happen is for us to get this out of the way you think about this i want you to think of your your your carnal nature as clouds the sun was shining so beautiful today and yesterday i i don't know if y'all seen it probably didn't because there's all the clouds in the way but it was still shining amen it was still the sun was out there for you to say i wish the sun would shine it's just silly the sun is shining it didn't get turned off behind the clouds god is still in you the hope of glory still in you you just got to get the clouds out of the way and let them shine it will create an atmosphere it will create a home it'll create what's needed in every relationship he wants our life to speak his word to the lost and to the dying christ in you the hope of glory i'll say it like this christ in you is the only is is the only hope that anybody will have of making it to glory god does not give us a ministry of reconciliation and say no you don't have to do it if you don't want to there is a purpose in you sharing god with somebody think about this it's not just the job of the ministry imagine right now if there was no ministry behind the pulpit you got you just think about the twelve disciples never said okay well we're gonna have church come gather they went out go he out one on one one on two get three or four you all can be doing this outside of this church and that is your responsibility to god and when you get them hooked say come come but it's all of our responsibility romans chapter 8 verse 20 for the creature was made subject to vanity that's us not willing we didn't want it but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope there was a reason god allowed us to be born in sin shapened in iniquity the the the wonder and the pleasure the honor the glory that god gets from seeing his seed fight through that carnality of of of of a selfish flesh and to blew forth of serving god and living for others what an awesome thing that god experiences he's not just pleased with me saying i know i'm a seed of god it's got to start with that but it don't end with that it's got to end with the manifestation of that just give me a chance to show christ is in me you know what you're asking for right it's the same thing as asking for patience because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage we are going to be delivered from this bondage and if you can believe you can have more deliverance you will and the more you're waiting around for the rapture to happen to do it all you're going to miss out of what how much christ can be manifested and how much you can be delivered today amen it's okay in this age to be expecting god doing more in your life this age you can because this is the age we're fully supposed to manifest christ because the creature itself shall also be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god amen not the glorious liberty to do what your flesh wants to the children friend no the children of god what they do they're born of god's will for we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth something's going on in pain together until now they're waiting for this unveiling of christ in you and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit even we ourselves grown within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our bodies i can't stand this pest house i want to manifest christ yep i i'm flesh too and i would like to escape the pain of just wishing that i was out of here and that i could just get out of here without having to manifest it i'm so sick of this world when i get out of here how about i'm so full of christ i just manifested no matter what but god has us here for a reason groaning and travailing in pain until now what's happening it's the unveiling of christ i can say for all of our lives there's more of the marble of the old nature than taken off of us we're a lot closer to manifesting christ the way he wants us to than we've ever been but we can't stop mike and joel didn't stop not until he saw perfection we need to go on to perfection let us go on to perfection let god continue to have his way don't question what god is speaking to you if it's the word just say amen and move forward even we ourselves are groaning within ourselves we are waiting for christ to be unveiled how many times you're talking to somebody and you said i just wish i they could see it well people believe more what they see manifested than what they hear spoken and the only way that you can manifest it is have something so contrary to what you believe that you stand as a shining light in the midst of that situation because of you saying what you believe and what you know that just doesn't mean anything it's manifesting time not knowledge time manifesting time this robe of flesh i'll drop and rise to seize the everlasting prize because we've been predestined to the statue of a perfect man everything in our carnal nature has to be stripped away you know the problem is brother marty i think so often we think well my carnal nature i got most of it out and what we do is we cease to get more like christ and then we substitute it with knowledge i'm gonna listen this tape and get knowledge it's gonna make me more like christ well just tell me is it making you more humble are you laying your life down more you're serving others are you still you're still selfish and spending all your time doing what you want to do after that tape you don't get rapturing faith by listening here and knowledge here you get faith to start living what you're hearing and it just keeps building until before you know it your faith becomes a perfect faith ready for rapture you fall so perfectly in love with god you just take him at his word we are not only predestined to be the bride of christ but we have been predestined to go through things that only the bride is ordained to go through the chipping away of the carnal nature many can't take it it's too hard they get their mind off of it they just go on to something different but god is here wanting to bring forth that image out of out of you with this great vision that he has it's not the preacher brawling us over the head making us feel like we're nothing no it's christ wanting to see himself in you i you've heard that honey attracts more bees so sister kathleen help me with that honey attracts more than vinegar very good very good and the point of that is is that you you want to uh embrace but but honestly the only way that you're going to get to the statue the image of moses is to chip away what isn't moses the only way you're going to get to the image of christ is to chip away what's not christ and it hurts though our outward man perished the inward man is renewed day by day we just can't get away we can't get away from it it's okay love the word great peace have they that love my law and nothing shall offend them every time you allow god to chip away at something in your life more of the image of christ is being unveiled think about that in other words embrace it embrace if you hear the preacher say we need to pray more embrace it amen let that carnal man die christ is going to shine if you hear the if you hear the word telling you don't just listen to a message and try to do two or three other things focus on what's being said then just do it just do it because he's trying to get something to you god says so many things in the course of a service he speaks to all of us differently takes the same word the same scripture and he speaks something personal to us because he knows where we're at amen i just want to say it's perfectly in order to come to church and feel the lord is chipping away at your carnal nature it's perfectly in order to feel that because that's exactly what he's doing can you imagine coming to church and hearing the message of needing to get baptized over and over and over you've already been baptized it just wouldn't make any sense would it i mean at first you'd feel pretty good oh yeah i've already been baptized i don't have to do that but after a while it's like hey do you know your congregation we've all been baptized here are you with me and there just wouldn't be a need for the message every time to come to church if all you're going to do is say you need to be baptized in the name of the lord jesus it's the same way with having to be reminded that you're the bride or that you've been predestinated you've already been told that over and over you've already accepted it you've already said amen to it so it just wouldn't make much sense to keep telling you that i'm going to bring a balance to all this so just bear with me if you keep feeling like you need to be baptized every time you come to church when you've already been baptized something is wrong somewhere and if you keep feeling like you need to be told that you're the elected you're the chosen you're predestined when you've already testified that god spoke it to you something is wrong somewhere i want to bring a balance to what i said we can't forget we will need our minds to be stirred up and stimulated we got the example of that in the scriptures there was a time that john the baptist's vision got clouded over and jesus said go tell him what's happening we can get overtaken in the cares of life things will happen to us and we will need to be stirred up in our minds but we won't need that every single week if so there's something wrong somewhere it's time to get a hold of the lord paul admonished us to keep moving forward hebrews chapter six my i don't know if we're going to be able to get through everything but you know that is definitely not the first time that's ever happened to us in our lives brother uh mark asked me today he said do you ever get through your notes i said well it's about 50 50. no i said it's about 40 60. i don't i don't usually get through them all all right hebrews chapter 6 verse 1. therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of christ let us go on onto perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance and dead works and faith toward god of that doctrine of baptism and laying on the hands of the resurrection of the dead and the eternal judgment and this we will do if god repents permits so there is times that we need to be stirred reminded but we come to church to go forward if we are keep having problems and we're having a hard time going forward because we need to hear we need our faith to be stirred we need to be reminded that we're proud that we're predestinated we need to look at what's happening in the process when we're not at church i'll say it again it's the god's truth we need to come with a mindset of moving forward that's what the scripture says it's in this age we can't be waiting around i'll tell you i don't got a calendar and i cannot tell you what day the rapture is going to happen but as sure as anything it's already set it is already set it does not keep moving out in our mind it does just like our age tell me when you wake up and all day long and all you want to say is i'm old i'm old i'm old i'm going to die die die no you don't when my dad was 35 he was an old man forty-five fifty and then i become thirty-five four yeah who wants to say i'm an old man we want we will put that date up but god is not putting the rapture data waiting for you he's not delaying his coming we need to set this this thing's real it's going to happen i need to get serious about the word i need to go on what things are my life you got to chip off lord for it is impossible for those who once enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift and were i'm sorry if you want to put this up there's this is hebrews chapter six verse four tastes of the heavenly gift and were made partakers of the holy ghost and have tasted the good word of god and the powers of the world to come if they shall fall away to renew again unto them repentance seeing they have crucified to themselves the son of god afresh and put him to an open chain for the urge with drinketh in the rain that cometh often upon it bring forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dress receiving blessing from god but that which beareth thorns and briars is rejected is not into cursing whose end is to be burned but beloved we are persuaded something better of you now what church do you want to be in do you want to be in the church that nothing more is is expected of you i mean it would be easier in our flesh it's easier to go to church when the old man is not suffering that's really good but god your husband is looking at you and saying there's greater things per he's persuaded greater things out of you the things that accompany the image of christ the manifestation of christ for god is not unrighteous to forget your work and labor of love which you have shown toward his name in that he administered to the saints and do minister and we desire that every one of you in this church show the same diligence to the full assurance of hope until the end now what about everybody that left what about everybody who is not pressing in today i understand there's a lot of stuff but we've got the word our husband is telling us what to do hold that same confidence till we're out of here amen can you say amen to the word that ye be not slothful not me brother john not me i'm building three houses that's not the salt it's talking about but followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promises amen every promise in the book is mine amen praise the lord how many loves the word let's go on to perfection what is that the image of christ pressing towards that mark for the prize of the high calling it's the unveiling of christ in you we don't want to put peacock feathers on and try to do this and try to do that try to be this that and the other it's not real it just takes a little bit of test you'll fly off the handle but you just say lord share on my right so i share that nature away i just want you to shine forth amen amen amen god had a vision for us that vision is the same vision that he had in the garden when he said let us make man in our image he had the image and he made it perfect adam was perfect yes today he has the same image adam is our brother not our flash no talk about the inward man he has that same image of us that he did of of adam we've got to allow this carnal nature to be carved away whatever he speaks that's him carving he's a a discerner of the thoughts and tense and art he takes that knife of the word he says get this out of your life i'm speaking to you today go home and sh carve it out and you just got to believe that's christ speaking to you and not john martin's idea or some brother bruce or some minister it's got to be personal jeremiah says i know the thoughts i think towards you saith the lord he wants to give us an expected end he doesn't want us coming into church we're the only 15 coming into church that's not quite in his image or coming into heaven not quite in his image amen no his vision for you is to be without spot without wrinkle you're the bride you are making yourselves ready let's rejoice and be glad for his wife have made herself ready she had this hope she purified herself by knocking off this old nature even as she already was pure she's still knocking off the other stuff being confident of this very thing he which had begun a good work in you he's going to perform it amen for we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning of our confidence steadfast to the end let him chip away don't get offended don't get bothered don't say that don't encourage me we don't have time but i'd like you to read hebrews chapter 12 you'll see that every son and daughter of god as many as i love i rebuke chasing he doesn't want us to be weary and faint in our minds and get offended because we think this is something personal and directed and this is the do's and don'ts of a church and it's just religion and it's not god and god has set me free you gotta get away from that garbage satan will plant his his theology inside of you to keep you away from living this word and dine out to the flesh let them carve away the world the worldly nature that nothing's left don't you when people see you um don't when people see you don't you want them saying i i really see christ in you not whoa not the mood to talk to him i better wait that thing's got to get carved off we could go the rest of our life and say we're human it's always going to be there and say amen to that and feel just as good and don't have to worry about going home and doing any better that's right there's truth that we will have this cockabur nature but where's our attitude about it do you got faith to have the image of christ shining forth more be it unto you according to your faith that's why i'm saying if the 15 people next to me don't want to believe for their life as as much as i do i'm not going to let them stand in my way then brother branham said if if i can't uh when i pray for this man if i can't do anything i'm not going to stand in the way of somebody's got faith to do something to pray and believe this is an individual work a work god deals with us as individuals yes we're we're a body but not everybody in the body is saying lord have thy no way amen they all might be saying lord have thou wait to this point to this point to this room in my heart to this room in my heart that's why it needs to become more real to us personally getting ready to close in just another hour or two lord help me the unveiling of christ in our lives it's it's very similar to the things that we deal with in society and you take any sports team when they go to draft somebody they really don't know what they're getting they do not draft somebody just haphazard oh yeah whoever whatever come on give me a chance they go and they uh they got scouts and they they they look at how they handle themselves at the age that they're at and they give their their opinion on whether this would be a good candidate for their team and so they'll draft them but just because they got drafted to some professional team it doesn't mean they're going to play professional in fact the majority of the people that get drafted never make it to the teams and the ones that do make it well there's a lot of them are still borderline after a couple years they ain't towing the rope they trade them put them on waivers get rid of them it takes time to unveil who they are everybody is not a bradley what's the quarterback tom brady everybody's not a tom brady i should know tom brady everybody know that suit from the wings most everybody he was a very talented player he was known for going to the game for the mission to just watch him at how good he was well he was drafted in the 200s nobody knew he would be unveiled to be this great one of the greatest players talented we don't know this is the time to unveil what's inside you it's manifesting time amen those players can't go to the team and say coach look i'm just as good as anybody else on this team that don't work words are words put them through the test see if they can do it god is putting us through the test to see if we're going to manifest him or we're going to manifest you talk to me that way i'm not going to talk to you anymore i'm not going to shake hands with you i'm going to be christians who i want to be and not to you because i don't think you're one the carnality that comes out of what we think is christian it's manifesting time have you ever heard these words if i knew the way that you were i would have never married you brother john that's a sticky subject it's so sticky that we don't want to talk about the truth well it was different words that i heard john in other words love is blind but marriage is an eye-opener it's manifesting what's really an inside society it's it's manifested the devil hell is uh opened up enlarged and and the world is manifesting more and more evil the bride should be manifesting more and more the love of god not just saying well not part of that no manifest a greater love not what you had 10 years ago more times been given more is expected too much is given much is required it's an opportunity for us to be christ to a dying world god's got a vision for you he's waited a long time for this fruit to come forth amen let's stand together the rest of my sermon is going to be you standing we all have heard the scripture god knoweth them that are his he knows those that are his but what does he tell them that are his he's not telling the world this now but what is he telling those that are his he's telling them to depart from iniquity nevertheless the foundation of god says you're having this healed the lord knoweth them that are his and let everyone that nameth the name of christ depart from the nickname so what is he saying shave off those things that you know that need to get away amen and unveil who you are because you belong to christ what's not him we don't gotta try to figure things out more and have more mysteries and have go down this trail on that trail have been able to figure things out no let go of everything that's not him it's okay to be weak paul said god told paul when my my strength is made perfect in weakness he said i will gladly therefore glory in my infirmities this outward man perish oh i'll i'll glory in that because i know christ is gonna shine forth and this his life was just lived for others reaching out for the souls of others why he was being plastered by the world we have this before us this opportunity that's why i look at it it's an opportunity to take our lives from where they're at to say lord i'm committed i'm committed to chipping away i want you to chip more away lord the real you is going to come out which is the re miss jesus amen let's borrow hearts in a word of prayer our gracious heavenly father we want to thank you today that we are your sons and your daughters we thank you for giving us that revelation that we belong to
