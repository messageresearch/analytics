[0:00] him and show him that we have faith
[0:02] because we don't have to feel good
[0:04] to know he's amongst us amen amen
[0:08] we think it would be a wonderful thing
[0:10] an amazing thing if we were in heaven
[0:11] right now
[0:13] right it'd be like but heaven is here
[0:17] for if we'll just worship him and praise
[0:19] him in that way
[0:20] it's basic brother man says that realm
[0:22] that's just a little bit away from us
[0:25] right and as we worship him what we're
[0:27] doing is we're entering
[0:29] into that realm that's really what's
[0:31] happening so
[0:32] and it's up to us as individuals to
[0:35] enter into that amen well god bless you
[0:38] turn with me if you would or opening
[0:40] scripture in saint john chapter 3 verse
[0:43] 27 and
[0:46] i want to say is with brother brown's
[0:48] good to see
[0:50] brother bruce and his precious wife
[0:54] sister donna with us
[0:55] we got to see a few pictures
[0:58] it's you know what was really good is
[1:00] just to know that you were able to get
[1:02] away
[1:03] finally and enjoy a little bit of time
[1:07] because you've been
[1:09] you've still been like working after
[1:12] everything and and may it be
[1:18] well may it be the beginning of many
[1:21] amen
[1:22] um and i just want to let you know
[1:26] brother daniel darko
[1:28] called uh from ghana and wanted to send
[1:31] his greetings and want us to pray for
[1:33] him he's going to be doing a little
[1:34] outreach and
[1:35] wants to share some bibles so that's
[1:38] always good we told him we'd be praying
[1:40] for him amen amen and let's
[1:44] look to the lord in prayer before we
[1:46] read this verse
[1:47] our dear heavenly father we thank you
[1:51] lord as i believe brother bruce said
[1:53] pray that you've given us a desire to be
[1:56] here today to worship you
[1:58] to praise you to lift you up and
[2:01] lord we know that when we worship you
[2:04] and lift you up you just have a
[2:06] a way of lifting us up and bringing us
[2:09] above our situations lord we pray
[2:13] tonight that we could be lifted up into
[2:15] heavenly places with you
[2:17] and lord that we would be able to
[2:20] have a one-on-one contact everyone in
[2:22] this building everyone that might
[2:24] be uh on the live stream each one that
[2:27] perhaps would listen uh to the cd
[2:31] lord may it be one on one with
[2:34] each one today we're depending on you
[2:37] for that lord
[2:39] we ask that you would help us to get out
[2:40] of the way that you would have your way
[2:42] in our hearts today
[2:43] cleanse us all of our sins our
[2:45] iniquities lord as we
[2:47] enter into this place lord may you come
[2:51] and do the work that you desire to do in
[2:53] our lives make us more like you lord
[2:56] we pray that lord you take the words
[2:58] that are spoken today
[3:00] lord may they not be man's words may
[3:02] they not be received as man's words but
[3:05] lord may it be you speaking your word to
[3:07] our hearts
[3:09] we'll give be careful to give you the
[3:10] praise for this
[3:12] and continue to worship you now in
[3:14] spirit and truth for we ask it in jesus
[3:17] christ's name
[3:18] amen amen
[3:21] saint john chapter 3 just one verse
[3:24] there verse 27 and
[3:25] john answered and said a man can receive
[3:29] nothing except to be given from heaven
[3:33] amen god bless you may be seated
[3:37] we want to entitle this message walking
[3:39] by revelation
[3:43] exactly the men's meeting you would
[3:46] think that we just took a little bit off
[3:48] of the men's meeting but
[3:50] actually i don't know it just seems to
[3:52] be here of late but
[3:54] uh the men's meeting seems to be just
[3:57] preparing us for the service
[4:00] amen but john said
[4:04] a man can receive nothing except to be
[4:07] given
[4:08] him from heaven amen and
[4:11] that includes faith
[4:16] includes revelation which faith is a
[4:18] revelation brother bryan said
[4:21] and the voice of god spoken to us
[4:23] personally
[4:26] is a faith personal to us
[4:29] faith is a substance that comes from
[4:32] god it comes from heaven
[4:36] and if i could say it like this a man
[4:38] cannot receive
[4:40] faith unless it's given to him from
[4:42] heaven
[4:44] god used the substance of faith
[4:48] to frame the world that were that we
[4:50] live in
[4:52] god operates by faith every day when
[4:55] we're
[4:56] needing god help me with this situation
[4:59] it is faith that moves in our behalf
[5:03] amen without this
[5:06] real substance called faith we cannot
[5:09] please god
[5:10] these things were already in our notes
[5:12] before you brothers has
[5:14] quoted these scriptures romans chapter 1
[5:18] verse 16 and just laying
[5:19] a quick foundation but paul was saying
[5:22] here about faith for i am
[5:23] not ashamed of the gospel of christ for
[5:25] it is the power of god unto salvation
[5:28] to every one that believeth to the jew
[5:31] first and then also to the greek
[5:33] salvation cannot come
[5:35] without faith without believing and then
[5:38] he says here in verse 17 for therein is
[5:40] the righteousness of god
[5:42] revealed from faith
[5:45] to faith as it is written the just
[5:48] shall live by faith so faith isn't just
[5:51] something that we have
[5:53] with god in a religious way
[5:57] but it's something that we live by it's
[5:59] not something that we just have at the
[6:01] beginning when we make
[6:02] our initial commitment to god but it is
[6:05] something
[6:06] that we live with every day amen
[6:09] and what's so beautiful about this is
[6:11] that
[6:13] god can be here right today
[6:16] and speak to us
[6:19] too often we get caught up in what's
[6:22] being said
[6:23] as just information good
[6:27] information true information uh these
[6:30] are things that uh
[6:31] brother john has been studying and and
[6:33] we can benefit from these things
[6:35] and and be helped from these things but
[6:38] that is not what church is about
[6:40] that's not what the preaching of the
[6:41] gospel is about
[6:43] revelation doesn't come in that format
[6:46] later in the book of romans chapter 4 we
[6:49] find that faith counted david
[6:51] and abraham both justified amen
[6:54] in chapter 5 we understand that we're
[6:57] justified
[6:58] by faith and we have access thank you my
[7:01] brother i can see better now
[7:02] we have access into god's grace by faith
[7:06] we all want grace
[7:08] right but we need faith to enter into
[7:10] that
[7:11] and what verse i wanted to get to is in
[7:13] romans chapter 10 verse 17
[7:16] faith cometh by hearing
[7:21] you can't just hear truth and expect to
[7:24] have faith
[7:26] i want you to think about that statement
[7:30] you can't just hear truth and expect to
[7:33] have faith
[7:37] it's the source that you're hearing it
[7:39] from that's
[7:40] important amen who's telling
[7:44] you about the truth
[7:48] it will determine whether you get faith
[7:50] or not
[7:51] faith cometh by hearing god's word not
[7:54] man speaking god's word
[7:58] that's why it's important that you get
[8:00] your eyes
[8:01] and your mind off of john martin or
[8:04] who's ever standing up here
[8:06] you've got to focus on the word
[8:09] on the word and how it and how it um
[8:12] how it's dealing with you
[8:15] because you know when when jesus was
[8:18] speaking
[8:19] they would want to catch jesus in
[8:21] something they were saying wrong you
[8:22] know they come to brother brennan's
[8:24] meetings they want to catch them in
[8:25] something that he's saying wrong
[8:27] their whole motive was off of hearing
[8:29] from god they had to prove
[8:31] something and even if we're trying to
[8:33] prove it ourself
[8:37] there's no uh he
[8:40] he that have an ear let him hear
[8:43] what the spirit or what god is speaking
[8:46] to the church
[8:48] not what man is saying and somehow it's
[8:51] the
[8:51] spirit of god no get man out of the way
[8:54] get him completely up the more you can
[8:56] get man
[8:57] out of the way the more you're going to
[8:59] hear from god personally
[9:01] god can use somebody like me
[9:06] if he can use a donkey he can use me
[9:12] not worthy that he would use it think
[9:14] about this if if god could
[9:16] uh use if god uses you right
[9:21] yeah well why couldn't he use me
[9:24] and it really it does not matter the
[9:27] vessel that stands here
[9:29] it's your faith in what word is being
[9:33] spoken to your heart
[9:34] it all has to do with your heart and the
[9:36] word that's being spoken
[9:38] that is the real focus and where the
[9:41] focus needs to be
[9:43] faith is important brother brother mike
[9:45] reminded us something that the prophet
[9:46] said in our men's meaning he said
[9:48] faith is the most important thing
[9:51] that we can pray for and i just wonder
[9:55] how often we're praying for it because
[9:58] he
[10:01] as long as we can figure it out and
[10:03] understand it
[10:04] i got it
[10:07] that's the same thing that we can learn
[10:09] in school or in college
[10:10] or at work
[10:13] but what source is it coming from well
[10:16] it's got to be coming from god because
[10:18] brother john's saying it
[10:19] no no
[10:23] no it's got to be spoken to you
[10:25] personally
[10:27] or you can't receive it
[10:33] learning of god has been in interest
[10:36] of mankind since god put him out
[10:39] of the garden and placed flaming swords
[10:43] to protect the way of life amen
[10:46] in other words you won't be able to find
[10:49] a way to god
[10:50] on your terms right right
[10:53] because that was the whole the whole
[10:55] thing was no we got to do something here
[10:57] because otherwise
[11:00] they're gonna they've already made a
[11:02] decision to choose evil
[11:03] and now they're gonna come and approach
[11:05] us we can't have that right
[11:10] we can't come on our terms to god amen
[11:17] god made a way for us to come properly
[11:20] amen and it was through his only
[11:22] begotten son jesus christ full of grace
[11:24] and full truth
[11:25] jesus said i am the way to god he said i
[11:29] am the truth of god
[11:30] he said i am the life of god my words
[11:33] are spirit in their life
[11:35] and no man cometh to the father but by
[11:37] me he
[11:38] is the way back to god
[11:44] man will have to come god's way or he
[11:47] won't come at all
[11:48] amen when jesus described
[11:52] this way of himself
[11:55] he said that the way isn't easy
[11:59] it's a hard way you have to give up your
[12:02] will
[12:03] to walk in this way one place jesus
[12:06] described
[12:07] the way is straight and narrow it was
[12:09] crowded with afflictions and troubles
[12:12] he said but it's the way that leads to
[12:15] life
[12:15] amen god provided a way for us
[12:19] his love was manifested at calvary
[12:23] and that veil was rent in two it's that
[12:26] separated
[12:27] man from god and the the bible says i
[12:30] believe it was peter says
[12:32] uh he broke the middle wall of partition
[12:35] between us and he reconciled man back to
[12:39] god
[12:40] amen god did this freely for us
[12:43] but we understand a pardon is not a
[12:45] pardon unless it's received as a pardon
[12:48] otherwise the whole world would be saved
[12:51] so this life that god has given this way
[12:54] that he has provided
[12:56] it's not given to us like a christmas
[12:58] gift
[13:00] or some born-again birthday gift
[13:07] the whole world would be saved at that
[13:09] point
[13:11] it's god's desire but we
[13:14] must have the desire as well amen
[13:18] so strong that we're willing to give up
[13:22] our will for god's will
[13:25] it's absolutely true all we have to do
[13:28] is believe
[13:29] but we must believe as the scriptures
[13:32] teach us to believe
[13:34] there's no private interpretations with
[13:36] the scriptures
[13:37] to fully receive what god has for us we
[13:40] must
[13:40] give up all of our will
[13:43] i just got a few scriptures for that
[13:45] luke 14 33
[13:47] so likewise whosoever be of you that
[13:50] forsaketh not all
[13:52] that he have he cannot be my disciple
[13:56] now we're talking about that way that
[13:59] for god so love
[14:01] that he gave revelations chapter 12
[14:04] verse 11
[14:05] and they overcame them by the blood of
[14:07] the lamb and by the word of their
[14:09] testimony and they love not their lives
[14:11] unto death we must learn
[14:15] to believe like the scriptures teach us
[14:18] to believe amen can't believe in some
[14:21] other
[14:22] fashion some other way the way
[14:26] to god is through jesus christ we know
[14:28] that
[14:29] and jesus said the way to god is to give
[14:32] up our lives
[14:33] and to become born again that is
[14:36] the way you can't approach god
[14:40] on your terms you can't just
[14:43] build your own tower of babel to god
[14:47] your own tower of confusion to god
[14:51] you'll get so tied up and confused in
[14:53] your mind
[14:54] that you'll never get to god
[15:05] we've defined the way now i want to
[15:08] define our approach
[15:10] to that way man has
[15:13] access to approach god now but only on
[15:16] god's terms people have tried so many
[15:20] different approaches to god through
[15:23] their knowledge
[15:25] intellect understanding their talent
[15:28] their ability their reputation
[15:30] their works burning candles
[15:35] much speaking prayers
[15:38] money you name it man has tried it
[15:42] yes but there is only one
[15:45] approach acceptable to god and that is a
[15:48] humble
[15:49] contrite approach
[15:54] oh yes you can come boldly before the
[15:56] throne because of calvary
[15:58] but it still must be a humble
[16:02] approach
[16:06] the boldness is the way has made
[16:09] not the spirit that you have
[16:13] james chapter 4 verse 6 but he giveth
[16:17] more grace oh my my did not brother ron
[16:20] quote this
[16:22] in the men's meme but he giveth more
[16:24] grace wherefore he saith god
[16:26] resisteth the proud but
[16:30] giveth grace unto the humble amen
[16:34] submit yourselves therefore to god
[16:35] resist the devil and he'll flee from you
[16:37] draw
[16:37] nigh to god and he'll draw nigh to you
[16:41] how do you do that you cleanse your
[16:42] hands you purify your hearts
[16:46] you afflict yourself you mourn you weep
[16:49] you let your
[16:50] laughter be turned to mourning your joy
[16:51] to heaviness
[16:53] that is humbling yourself in the sight
[16:56] of the lord what is the end result he
[16:58] lifts you up
[16:59] amen he lifts you up speak not evil
[17:02] one of another that's a that's another
[17:05] thing
[17:06] that goes against the grain of god
[17:10] he that speaketh evil of his brother
[17:12] judgeth his brother
[17:15] he did and and speaking evil of the law
[17:19] because the law says don't do that right
[17:21] and judge the law but
[17:23] if thou judge the law thou no more doer
[17:25] the law but a judge
[17:27] so where does that put you with god
[17:30] god's going to look over at you and say
[17:31] what
[17:33] i'm the one that made the law not you
[17:37] that's why you can never judge somebody
[17:39] in the presence of the lord
[17:41] we all can judge somebody and we've all
[17:43] judged somebody
[17:46] but you can't be in the presence of the
[17:48] lord and do it
[17:49] so if you find yourself doing it you're
[17:51] out of that
[17:52] dimension you're out of that presence
[17:54] you're out of walking in the spirit
[18:01] do you want to get somewhere with god
[18:03] humble yourself
[18:05] humble your approach and you'll find a
[18:08] way to having more of the lord now
[18:10] here's
[18:10] here's where we're at today we're all
[18:12] christians today
[18:14] we're all serving the lord we all got a
[18:15] revelation and we're all saved
[18:19] now that we got that out of the way
[18:22] how many wants more of the lord this is
[18:25] the
[18:25] same exact recipe for us
[18:28] the same exact recipe
[18:32] knowing god is completely reserved
[18:36] by god
[18:40] no man can have anything except it be
[18:43] received from heaven
[18:46] we cannot make it force it do it
[18:50] anything amen it's up to god's grace
[18:55] revelation is a grace faith is is grace
[18:58] to us
[19:02] it's up to god if he chooses to unveil
[19:04] himself to anybody
[19:05] amen in fact he decided long ago
[19:09] to build his church completely on the
[19:11] choice
[19:12] that he would make who would be in his
[19:22] church
[19:26] we should have had more hallelujahs when
[19:29] brother
[19:30] ron was leading the worship
[19:33] instead of sitting there and looking at
[19:35] brother ron wondering
[19:37] you know what kind of job he's doing
[19:41] let's just help him let's just create
[19:44] let's do our part to create the
[19:45] atmosphere
[19:48] and and when you think you've done
[19:50] enough then help the brother sister
[19:52] that's next to you but if we just all
[19:55] put in 100
[19:57] god will honor the atmosphere
[20:01] matthew chapter 16 verse 13 very
[20:04] familiar scriptures here
[20:07] when jesus came to the coast of caesarea
[20:10] philippi asked his disciples saying
[20:12] who do men say that i the son of man am
[20:17] and they said some say that our john the
[20:19] baptist
[20:20] elias jeremias or one of the prophets
[20:24] some today might say that jesus is a
[20:26] methodist
[20:29] he's a catholic he's a lutheran
[20:33] or others pentecostal or one of those
[20:36] religions out there
[20:37] that's right
[20:40] and we learn from this that there's a
[20:44] lot of different opinions that people
[20:46] have about who god is right
[20:48] amen amen
[20:52] and he saith unto them but whom say ye
[20:55] that i
[20:55] am so the first question is what other
[20:58] people say
[20:59] now it's to you personally and if i can
[21:01] say
[21:02] this if this is an individual fair what
[21:05] did god speak to you at the service
[21:07] tonight
[21:10] not what did he say
[21:15] not the understanding or what you got
[21:18] out of it but what did he speak to
[21:20] you personally amen that's all that's
[21:24] important
[21:25] because if that don't happen we've
[21:27] missed it we've missed hearing what the
[21:29] spirit
[21:30] said to us because you're the church
[21:32] right
[21:33] you're the church amen so what did the
[21:35] spirit say to you
[21:37] amen well he didn't say anything to me
[21:40] right you sure you
[21:44] sure he's never failed
[21:47] that's right right that's right he's
[21:49] never come
[21:50] short
[21:54] that's right he that have ears it's my
[21:57] responsibility
[21:58] to get proper ears yes
[22:03] in fact he told the laodicean church
[22:06] that you need to get isaf and you need
[22:08] to you need to take care of yourself
[22:11] and do your part if you're going to see
[22:12] me in the church
[22:15] and what is he what is he dealing with
[22:17] their attitude it was all about attitude
[22:20] you know you say you you are in need of
[22:22] nothing and you can kick me out of the
[22:24] church
[22:29] you're the one that don't realize that
[22:32] you're you're blind
[22:33] jesus said to those pharisees because
[22:36] you say you see
[22:37] you're blind if you would say i can't
[22:39] see then i would give you sight
[22:41] it's all to do with attitude amen
[22:44] so to really receive revelation
[22:48] personally the thing you want to work on
[22:50] is your attitude and of course what does
[22:52] pride say
[22:52] pride says my attitude is fine my
[22:55] motives are right my
[22:56] my attitude is right and i'm basically
[22:59] in need of nothing sitting here
[23:00] amen
[23:05] it's an individual fair it doesn't
[23:07] matter the person's attitude sitting
[23:08] next to you
[23:09] what's important is what is your
[23:11] attitude amen
[23:14] so i believe he's asking us the same
[23:16] question tonight
[23:18] who do we say he is
[23:25] somebody brought up in our men's meeting
[23:28] brother ron
[23:30] it honestly brother ron but brother ron
[23:32] was not leading the men's meeting
[23:35] it was brother mark but we heard a lot
[23:36] from brother ron
[23:39] that was not in any negative way brother
[23:42] ron
[23:42] at all because everything that he had to
[23:44] say was
[23:46] perfectly in line with the message
[23:47] tonight
[23:49] amen but he made mention about the
[23:53] challenge
[23:54] of reading every verse in the bible and
[23:56] not seeing jesus in it
[24:00] he said it caused him to want to go back
[24:02] and read it
[24:03] until he found jesus in it
[24:09] and i believe that when we come to
[24:10] church and we're hearing the word
[24:12] spoken we need to see jesus
[24:15] speaking to us
[24:18] because we can get in the in the mindset
[24:21] or the
[24:22] attitude well i wish so and so was here
[24:25] i hope
[24:26] they caught this and before you know it
[24:29] the whole service is about
[24:31] just one thing i i i
[24:35] instead of that love letter that love
[24:38] relationship
[24:39] that lord you know exactly what i've
[24:41] been going through you know what i have
[24:43] need of amen
[24:47] it's like we should get rid of all
[24:50] pitchforks
[24:54] and have rakes
[25:00] amen verse 16 simon peter answered and
[25:03] said
[25:04] thou art the christ the son of the
[25:06] living god
[25:11] remember peter once said thou alone has
[25:15] the words of eternal life
[25:21] when you're hearing the word
[25:26] are you are you agreeing that the word
[25:29] is true
[25:32] or are you saying that word is for me
[25:37] it's two different things yes it's two
[25:39] different things
[25:42] the debate is not going to be whether
[25:44] the word is right
[25:45] right that's not the debate but
[25:49] knowing that the word is right will
[25:50] never make us go out and live it
[25:54] we've got to hear from god personally
[25:57] speak to our heart
[25:59] amen
[26:03] verse 17 jesus answered and said
[26:06] on tim blessed art thou simon bar jonah
[26:09] for flesh and blood have not revealed it
[26:11] unto thee but my father
[26:13] which is in heaven now i want to
[26:17] to bring our attention to what's really
[26:19] more important
[26:20] is hearing the truth all that matters or
[26:24] is it more important who's speaking to
[26:26] you
[26:27] amen because you notice jesus didn't say
[26:31] you got it right
[26:35] that's all that matters you got it right
[26:39] no he brought attention to where the
[26:41] information came from
[26:43] so i say today um
[26:46] don't ever leave the church and say
[26:50] well brother john said
[26:56] unless it was wrong and then you can say
[26:58] that then i want you to say that
[27:01] but it's more important of knowing who
[27:04] you're hearing it from
[27:06] amen
[27:09] what what brother branham say just five
[27:11] minutes in his presence
[27:13] where he's speaking to us can do more
[27:15] than five years in a seminary
[27:17] hearing all about god hearing all about
[27:19] the truth
[27:24] amen it's about a personal relationship
[27:26] that's what this is about
[27:28] amen
[27:32] when god knocked on saul's heart he
[27:35] didn't get lazy
[27:36] and just go to church and hear what the
[27:38] disciples had to say about this new
[27:39] jesus he heard about
[27:40] right he went alone into the desert
[27:45] and he sought the voice of the lord
[27:48] personally
[27:49] [Music]
[27:52] and after three and a half years he came
[27:55] out
[27:56] and there was nothing that the disciples
[27:58] could add unto his ministry
[28:00] of what god had spoke to him personally
[28:03] that's the power
[28:04] of the voice of god spoken personally
[28:07] and he had so much faith in god
[28:10] amen galatians chapter 1 verse 15
[28:14] but when it please god who separated me
[28:16] from my mother's room and called me
[28:18] into his grace called me by his grace to
[28:21] reveal
[28:22] his son notice in me the word is in me
[28:27] because when you get a revelation it
[28:29] becomes part of you it's what you eat
[28:31] amen you become what he speaks
[28:35] amen because he all that god has ever
[28:39] ever
[28:39] looked for is a desire in a man's heart
[28:45] why did he let lucifer go lucifer wasn't
[28:48] like that at the beginning
[28:51] he worshipped god right and he did it
[28:54] from his heart
[28:56] he really did and we don't know for how
[28:59] many
[29:00] millions of years he did that
[29:04] but he got to a place where he wanted to
[29:07] do his own thing and god let him do it
[29:09] just like god lets every human being
[29:11] do what he wants to do
[29:15] because that's a gentleman god wants a
[29:17] love relationship
[29:18] if somebody's going to approach him and
[29:20] have a relationship
[29:22] it's going to be on the basis of love
[29:23] and desire because that's what god has
[29:26] for us
[29:26] [Music]
[29:29] amen to reveal his son in me that i
[29:34] might preach
[29:35] him among the heathen immediately
[29:38] immediately i didn't think about finding
[29:40] out what somebody else had to say about
[29:42] it
[29:43] i conferred not with flesh and blood
[29:46] neither when i went up to jerusalem to
[29:49] them which were apostles before me
[29:51] but i went into arabia and returned into
[29:53] damascus then after
[29:54] three years i went up to jerusalem to
[29:57] see
[29:58] peter and i bowled with him two weeks
[30:00] right
[30:02] but other but other of the apostles
[30:06] saw i
[30:09] save james the lord's brother
[30:13] so he didn't have really a whole lot of
[30:15] contact
[30:19] can you imagine
[30:23] if you had to hear from god
[30:28] without the preaching of the word
[30:34] peter did not go to a message church in
[30:37] his hour
[30:39] paul did not go to a message church in
[30:41] his hour that was in arabia
[30:44] he went to be alone with god yes
[30:48] in order for us to really hear from god
[30:50] without preaching we got to get serious
[30:52] now god does speak
[30:53] he spoke when we were all sinners we
[30:54] heard his voice but we get to a place
[30:57] where god expects us
[30:58] to humble ourself and spend time with
[31:00] him seeking his voice
[31:03] he wants that private time amen
[31:08] but he had so much confidence
[31:12] in verse 11 of that same chapter he says
[31:14] but i certify you brother
[31:16] that the gospel which was preached of me
[31:18] is not after man
[31:21] for i neither received it of man
[31:24] just like peter didn't receive it of man
[31:26] who jesus was
[31:28] neither was i taught it this is
[31:31] important
[31:32] we come to church and we learn so much
[31:34] at church
[31:38] but we're being taught it by man
[31:41] too much too much relying on it amen
[31:48] we need to hear the truth there's no
[31:50] doubt about
[31:51] it but you need to take the truth home
[31:53] and go seek the lord about it
[31:56] and hear from god personally make sure
[31:59] it's him
[32:01] and be able to come back and and know
[32:04] that you heard from heaven
[32:08] now to do the thing correctly
[32:13] to do it correctly we need to come more
[32:16] prepared for the word
[32:18] the bible says be more ready to hear the
[32:20] word
[32:21] and if if we got a good grill right
[32:24] then we know we're here and we're going
[32:26] to hear from heaven because it it's just
[32:28] going to connect
[32:29] it's going to bear witness the holy
[32:31] ghost that lives inside of you
[32:32] is going to bear witness with the holy
[32:34] ghost says speaking
[32:35] amen because you're both god
[32:42] i'm scared of being taught by a man
[32:47] because you can begin to rely on the man
[32:52] and miss the revelation amen
[32:59] okay this word is not the word of man
[33:04] it's the word of god but it was spoken
[33:07] of holy men of old as they were moved on
[33:09] by the holy ghost
[33:10] amen now if we have that same spirit
[33:13] when we're reading it
[33:19] but just because i have the holy ghost
[33:21] it doesn't mean
[33:23] that the holy ghost is reading the word
[33:24] right now
[33:26] doesn't mean i'm in this spirit right
[33:28] now reading the word
[33:32] it is so easy to pick up the bible
[33:35] and read it and feel good it is so hard
[33:39] to get on your knees
[33:40] and humble yourself and say god help me
[33:43] in my condition
[33:44] i need to hear from you we want to hear
[33:48] from god when we open that bible and
[33:49] read it without any kind of change
[33:52] or preparation here and it's not good
[33:55] enough to say
[33:56] lord forgive me i'm sorry my sins speak
[33:57] to me now
[34:01] it's like to speak to me now that our my
[34:03] death
[34:04] how's that go those prayers
[34:09] it can become
[34:15] out of the heart that god is looking for
[34:17] let me just say it like that out of the
[34:19] heart that god is looking for
[34:20] he's looking for love
[34:24] taking your time and wanting to hear
[34:26] from him
[34:28] he was patient with us amen that is
[34:31] right
[34:32] why can't we be patient with him why
[34:34] can't we wait on the lord why can't we
[34:36] make
[34:36] sacrifices and and just get desperate to
[34:40] want to
[34:41] hear stay there until we hear from him
[34:45] amen revelation isn't going to come
[34:50] i want to ask you this question when's
[34:52] the last time you received a revelation
[35:04] i yes i want to challenge you but not in
[35:06] a mean way
[35:10] what revelation did you receive
[35:16] did you walk in it are you a part of it
[35:18] has it become a part of your life
[35:22] i mean it's not about being taught the
[35:25] bible
[35:27] it's about a relationship that you have
[35:29] with god and when he speaks to you and
[35:31] it becomes real to you
[35:34] you ought to be able to testify god
[35:37] spoke this
[35:38] i'm the church he spoke this to me
[35:41] and it become a part of my life is
[35:43] changing from faith
[35:45] unto faith amen the just shall live by
[35:49] faith
[35:52] amen i want you to go home and i want
[35:55] you to think about these things i want
[35:57] you to
[35:58] think about the faith that god has given
[36:00] you
[36:02] and you're walking in that faith
[36:08] too often we're using god
[36:12] as somebody to help us with our natural
[36:14] life
[36:16] completely off balance of what what
[36:19] faith is for
[36:24] we want to get out of here we want to
[36:26] become more in his image
[36:28] we want to be able to be an overcomer
[36:31] amen we need faith for that amen
[36:35] paul started out his walk correctly
[36:38] and that was by faith it was a
[36:40] foundation of faith
[36:43] he sought god he got faith
[36:47] and he believed in god
[36:52] faith isn't a religion
[36:58] he continued his walk every day by faith
[37:02] galatians chapter 2 verse 20.
[37:04] he said the life which i now live in the
[37:06] flesh i live by the faith of the son of
[37:08] god
[37:10] and he ended his walk in faith
[37:14] second timothy chapter four verse seven
[37:16] second timothy
[37:17] chapter four verse seven i have fought
[37:20] a good fight i have
[37:24] finished my course i have
[37:27] kept the faith you can't lose it
[37:33] [Music]
[37:34] amen
[37:38] just get so involved in the world
[37:42] henceforth there is laid up for me a
[37:45] crown of righteousness which the lord
[37:48] the righteous shall give me at that day
[37:50] and not
[37:51] to me only but everyone
[37:54] that's here tonight that loves
[37:58] his appearing amen
[38:04] when's the last time you said lord i
[38:06] just want to see you
[38:07] all right you know what we probably all
[38:09] said i'm
[38:10] so sick of this world i'm so sick of
[38:13] what i'm going through i'm so sick of
[38:15] this i just want to get out of here
[38:19] i don't see any love and disappearing in
[38:21] that
[38:22] what i see is the frustration of what
[38:24] this world can do to a person
[38:26] amen but what god is wanting to see is
[38:28] that love affair
[38:31] the bride and the spirit they say come
[38:33] there's that
[38:34] longing for jesus can't wait till those
[38:37] doors are open so i can come in
[38:39] and worship the lord amen
[38:42] not sit there and just wait for
[38:44] something to be spoken to me to kind of
[38:45] help me make me feel better
[38:49] i mean i understand that we need that
[38:51] sometimes but if that becomes your
[38:53] attitude most of the time
[38:54] something is wrong with your walk
[38:58] something is missing in your watch
[39:01] because it's not lining up with i can't
[39:03] wait till the doors are open
[39:05] amen it's got to line up
[39:14] when god speaks to you personally it
[39:17] becomes
[39:18] your faith
[39:21] it becomes your substance it becomes
[39:25] your anchor
[39:28] when you hear the preaching of the word
[39:31] i want you to visualize it being more
[39:34] as it is god using just a vessel
[39:37] to speak to you it's just a vessel
[39:42] but visualize it's going to be god
[39:44] speaking to you
[39:46] sec first thessalonians chapter 2 verse
[39:48] 13.
[39:50] for this cause also thank we god without
[39:53] ceasing because when ye
[39:54] receive the word of god which he heard
[39:57] of us
[39:58] ye received it not as the word of men
[40:02] right but
[40:05] as it is in truth the word of god which
[40:08] effectually worketh
[40:10] also in you that believe
[40:13] if you're just believing you're hearing
[40:15] the truth from a man
[40:17] you're probably going to walk out of
[40:19] here about the same as you came in
[40:23] even though brother ram says you never
[40:25] are the same when you walk out
[40:27] you're either closer to god which is you
[40:30] have more faith because you heard from
[40:32] god
[40:33] or you're further away which means
[40:38] you've got more knowledge
[40:42] you've got more knowledge you're just
[40:45] you're hearing from a man
[40:46] and it's it's taking you away from god
[40:50] yes it's going to come to a man we're
[40:52] not up here listening to some we're not
[40:54] a tape
[40:56] we're hearing god's using a vessel
[40:59] but you're a vessel too
[41:03] if god in the speaker and the god
[41:06] and the listener are connected
[41:12] there's something that god has for you
[41:14] amen
[41:16] amen he's not one to waste your time
[41:18] amen
[41:21] and he cares about you so much more than
[41:23] any human being can ever care about you
[41:25] amen and that's why your faith
[41:29] it rests in god in the word not a man
[41:33] amen
[41:37] this is not a school of learning
[41:41] this we don't come here some night class
[41:45] we're not here to learn about god
[41:48] we're here to meet god one-on-one
[41:53] when you go home you should better talk
[41:54] to the person next to you and say
[41:57] this is what god spoke to me yes this is
[41:59] what god spoke to me
[42:04] not this why would you get out of that
[42:06] service
[42:07] yeah right let you get out of the
[42:11] service
[42:15] we come to meet with him yes amen amen
[42:19] amen i'm telling you it's all about
[42:22] attitude change
[42:23] amen the more our attitude
[42:26] can become humble i need you lord
[42:30] god we'll hear god speak so much more
[42:36] amen this private communication
[42:39] between you and god is your lifeline to
[42:42] heaven
[42:44] god must be privately speaking to your
[42:47] heart
[42:48] or you are without god
[42:51] in the service right
[42:56] and we've all we've all experienced this
[42:59] we've sat in church we've heard the word
[43:01] and felt like nothing happened
[43:07] we've all sat in church felt the
[43:10] presence
[43:10] of the lord right and said god was there
[43:17] because we found his presence
[43:21] but how often can we testify
[43:25] god spoke to my heart i knew it was him
[43:28] and this is what he's called me to do
[43:30] and i'm going to do it
[43:31] amen because that's what the word is for
[43:35] right it's not about feelings whether we
[43:38] don't feel or we feel
[43:40] right it's about he
[43:43] my sheep feel my spirit
[43:48] my sheep hear my voice and they follow
[43:51] me
[43:53] we got to get excited about hearing his
[43:56] voice
[43:56] [Music]
[43:58] put more faith in god
[44:01] not the pastor
[44:05] amen it's just an office
[44:09] that god uses yes but it's just as human
[44:13] as you
[44:14] yeah it's just as human as you it has
[44:17] just as many
[44:18] thoughts as you yes it's true probably
[44:21] more
[44:24] hey our faith should not rely
[44:28] in man our faith needs to be in god
[44:34] amen
[44:37] god is not going to let anyone into his
[44:40] church
[44:41] without his say so now that's scary
[44:48] god is not going to give anybody a
[44:50] revelation
[44:52] without his say-so that's a better way
[44:55] to say it because we all are in his
[44:57] church
[45:01] but if you ask the question
[45:04] how come i haven't been getting
[45:05] revelation at church
[45:10] well he is the one that says whether
[45:13] you're going to get it or not
[45:18] and he'll give it if we meet his
[45:21] requirement
[45:23] we need to be humble we need to be
[45:25] contrite we need to be needy
[45:27] he's come to revive those that are
[45:29] broken
[45:30] needy of that relationship
[45:35] not just to the hardships that going on
[45:37] at work
[45:38] man we got a lot of them yeah we all got
[45:42] them
[45:42] we all got them and if it ain't work
[45:44] it's of something else
[45:46] but in the midst of all that we ought to
[45:49] be zooming
[45:50] in on a relationship with god to get to
[45:52] make a rapture and get out of here
[45:55] and that's what our focus needs to be
[46:00] verse 18 and i say unto thee that thou
[46:02] art peter and upon
[46:04] this rock of revelation
[46:07] i will build my church amen and the
[46:11] gates of hell
[46:12] shall not prevail against it
[46:16] we must be looking hungering thirsting
[46:19] desiring for god to come and speak to us
[46:24] because this is god's time of visitation
[46:31] and we don't want to miss it
[46:35] amen we don't want to just show up
[46:37] because this church
[46:40] because if we miss church and we feel
[46:41] bad what's the
[46:43] truth so if we show up then we want to
[46:46] deal with that
[46:49] but we still missed him
[46:54] he walked with those two disciples on
[46:56] the road to emmaus and they didn't even
[46:58] recognize him
[47:01] he could be right here in our midst
[47:04] standing on holy ground and we don't
[47:05] even know it
[47:06] yes amen
[47:10] and not because god's lacking
[47:13] amen god reserves who is going to
[47:16] show himself to who he's going to unveil
[47:20] himself
[47:22] to
[47:30] you know there's certain people in life
[47:32] that you cannot trust
[47:36] everybody should have said amen to that
[47:39] there's very few people
[47:41] in life that you can trust
[47:43] [Music]
[47:45] because you know they won't hurt you
[47:49] that's right
[47:54] amen well god
[47:58] knows whose motive is just for him
[48:03] and whose motive is a little bit mixed
[48:07] or mixed up amen
[48:11] and so god is waiting for our motives
[48:14] to be right amen our hearts to be right
[48:18] amen because i'll say this
[48:21] the whole heaven is full of so much
[48:25] joy peace and the unveiling of christ
[48:30] i think it'll take eternity and we still
[48:32] won't know all about god
[48:35] how can we come to church and not
[48:37] receive
[48:38] it has to be a loss
[48:48] now at the same time that god is wanting
[48:50] to speak to us
[48:52] he's wanting to keep his truth from the
[48:55] majority of people
[48:58] he's literally hiding himself i say this
[49:01] because the
[49:02] the majority of people go to hell
[49:05] it's the broad way
[49:09] it's awful quiet i don't got time to go
[49:11] into all this i'm not gonna have time to
[49:13] you need to say amen so i can keep going
[49:17] as jesus finishes his sermon
[49:20] where he's expressing the need
[49:24] that people need to repent more they
[49:27] need to be
[49:28] more zealous about repenting
[49:33] or else the day of judgment is going to
[49:35] be real bad for them
[49:39] he ends up praying in matthew chapter 11
[49:41] verse 25
[49:43] at that time jesus answered and said i
[49:45] thank thee
[49:46] oh father lord of heaven and of earth
[49:49] because
[49:50] thou has hid these things from a group
[49:53] of people
[49:54] they're wise and they're prudent yes and
[49:57] he's
[49:58] revealed them to another group of people
[50:01] who are like babes yes
[50:04] even so father for so it seemed good
[50:07] in thy sight he holds the control
[50:11] of who he's going to unveil himself
[50:13] who's going to be in the church
[50:15] and who's not yes amen so we're not
[50:18] questioning whether we're in the church
[50:20] today
[50:20] but we need to understand how can i get
[50:23] more revelation
[50:24] what is what do i do what can i do to
[50:27] get more revelation
[50:29] is god hiding something from me is god
[50:32] keeping something from me
[50:34] i've been praying i've been seeking i've
[50:36] been asking is god hiding from me
[50:42] all things are delivered unto me of my
[50:45] father and no man knoweth the son but
[50:47] the father neither knoweth any man but
[50:49] the father saved the son
[50:50] and to he to whomsoever the son will
[50:53] reveal him
[50:55] he's holding that today yes
[50:58] amen you know the bible says the rich
[51:01] have many friends excuse me for getting
[51:04] off the pulpit so much but i just want
[51:06] to get kind of close to you but i don't
[51:07] want to preach loud or anything
[51:09] you know the bible says the rich have
[51:10] many friends if there's somebody that's
[51:13] got something
[51:14] a lot of people like them
[51:17] it's just natural i can benefit from
[51:20] knowing this person
[51:23] i can climb up the corporate ladder
[51:26] quicker
[51:28] it's not what you know it's who you know
[51:35] jesus has what we have need of
[51:38] amen we don't need to impress one
[51:42] another
[51:42] all right thank you jesus
[51:46] it's not about what you think about me
[51:49] or what i think about you
[51:51] [Music]
[51:52] we're here because of god amen
[51:56] i want to get in contact with him and i
[51:58] need to hear from him amen
[52:01] that's why brother branham said we don't
[52:04] come here to fellowship with one another
[52:06] we come to fellowship with god we need
[52:09] just a word from him
[52:11] amen so i'm saying he has all the riches
[52:15] he has everything that we have need of
[52:17] right
[52:18] why wouldn't we want to just buddy up to
[52:21] him
[52:25] i mean john he kind of leaned on the
[52:28] bosom of jesus
[52:29] right he knew where the goods came from
[52:33] and he could whisper little things and
[52:36] find out the secrets
[52:38] that he would maybe not tell everybody
[52:41] because of that closeness right
[52:44] amen and i'll say the more you you
[52:46] notice john
[52:48] he didn't go like this over jesus what
[52:51] are these other disciples they're still
[52:55] no he humbled himself and got under his
[52:57] bosom and is close to his heart
[53:01] because he knew he'd have a better
[53:04] chance remember they
[53:05] didn't peter brother bruce you probably
[53:08] know this i'm sorry that
[53:09] wasn't it peter that came to john
[53:12] and asked john talk to jesus and see
[53:14] what he says about something
[53:17] wasn't that right because he couldn't do
[53:19] it himself but he knew john was close to
[53:21] him
[53:22] and what happens when there's a need you
[53:25] know who just to call
[53:29] jesus is here and he wants to speak to
[53:32] us
[53:32] amen but he's looking for us
[53:36] to get in personal contact with him
[53:39] amen and you can't do that outside of a
[53:43] humble and contrite spirit
[53:45] i don't matter what you know how much
[53:46] you know i don't care what's been
[53:48] revealed to you
[53:49] i don't care how long you've been
[53:50] serving the lord i don't care if you've
[53:52] been certain more
[53:53] longer than lucifer did
[53:58] because you can get to a place where
[54:00] your attitude isn't exactly where it
[54:02] needs to be
[54:03] [Music]
[54:06] and then you know what develops religion
[54:11] i'm in the message that's right i follow
[54:14] this
[54:15] right but what about
[54:18] the love of god
[54:22] where's that relationship to where all
[54:24] men see
[54:27] it isn't just a denomination it isn't
[54:29] just a message believer
[54:34] the true message will never become
[54:36] denominationalized but they will take
[54:38] this message
[54:39] and make a personal denomination out of
[54:42] it
[54:42] because they don't have a revelation of
[54:45] who the
[54:46] who brother branham was talking about
[54:48] [Music]
[54:50] it's like amen they've you know what it
[54:52] is they come to they come to the tapes
[54:55] they're listening to the tapes and they
[54:58] they want to be just like
[55:02] they want to be like brother brandon
[55:04] absolutely
[55:09] cowboy hats
[55:12] whatever it might be nowadays
[55:16] they're quoting the quotes
[55:19] oh yes quote the quotes it is true right
[55:22] it's like a belt buckle it can be
[55:26] you know what i'm saying if you quote
[55:28] the quote but you're not
[55:30] living the quote
[55:34] that's right and i understand that we
[55:36] can't live the whole message i
[55:38] understand that but it's not about
[55:42] quoting the prophet
[55:47] it's about becoming what that prophet
[55:49] quoted
[55:53] it's about living the word amen
[56:04] god is literally hiding himself from one
[56:07] group of people
[56:08] and revealing himself to another group
[56:14] amen
[56:16] and it all has to do with the condition
[56:19] of heart
[56:20] amen because remember the four
[56:23] conditions of the heart the word was
[56:24] still preached
[56:25] right yes yes it it hit
[56:29] yes but they they were all
[56:32] it affected each one differently amen
[56:37] so we want it to profit us right we want
[56:40] it to
[56:40] bring forth through whatever god speaks
[56:43] to us if god speaks to me
[56:45] john martin i want you to stop doing
[56:46] that i want
[56:48] the fruit of me stop doing that right
[56:53] i don't want just well i know not to do
[56:55] that
[56:56] there's no and have no fruit of it
[56:58] continue to do it you understand what
[57:00] i'm saying
[57:01] but a good ground will make me stop
[57:03] doing it
[57:05] that's why it's important that we hear
[57:07] from god personally
[57:10] right and there's a
[57:12] lot of things that we all need to stop
[57:14] doing amen
[57:19] god is working to hide himself from a
[57:21] wise
[57:22] and prudent a proud and arrogant
[57:26] from those who aren't zealous about
[57:38] repenting
[57:40] god gives a chance
[57:43] but people refuse to deal
[57:46] with the chance that god gives them
[57:51] but to the humble heart the babes
[57:54] who realize that they need to know god
[57:56] more he says in verse 28 the next verse
[57:58] come unto me
[58:00] all ye that labor and are heavy laden
[58:03] and i will give you rest
[58:06] see that before this is a group of
[58:08] people who were just
[58:09] would not repent right who would not
[58:13] repent and he said it's going to be more
[58:14] tolerable
[58:16] for these that had already their
[58:19] judgment then for
[58:20] the new people were hearing the word
[58:23] and not repenting
[58:28] right a greater than solomon was amongst
[58:30] them
[58:33] so he says i'm going to reveal myself to
[58:35] babes now babe is
[58:38] you just i need you lord i'm coming to
[58:41] you because i know that
[58:42] no one else can help me
[58:44] [Music]
[58:45] i'm coming to church for one reason i
[58:47] need you lord
[58:49] nobody else can help me come unto me all
[58:52] you that labor and heavy laden i will
[58:54] give you rest
[58:54] take my yoke upon you learn of me learn
[58:58] of me do not learn
[59:01] what john martin says about jesus
[59:04] learn from jesus amen
[59:08] we've got to get our eyes off of flesh
[59:10] and get our eyes on jesus
[59:14] it's it's a catching away time we've
[59:18] made
[59:18] church too much about a denominational
[59:21] system in our mind of going to church
[59:25] and it's we've gotten out of the spirit
[59:28] amen end up coming to church not in the
[59:30] spirit struggling
[59:32] to get in the spirit when we're here
[59:36] and then finding ourselves content with
[59:38] the knowledge of truth
[59:40] and not even at least interested in
[59:42] where that truth came from
[59:44] who's whose voice that spoke to you
[59:49] when god speaks it it becomes a part of
[59:50] you you walk out you're thinking about
[59:52] it you want to do it you're you're
[59:54] activating it you think about the next
[59:56] day it becomes real
[59:58] i want to say today when's the last time
[1:00:00] you got a revelation
[1:00:03] we probably can all talk about the
[1:00:04] things that we've learned
[1:00:06] right oh man i i got a rev i didn't know
[1:00:09] that about the bible
[1:00:14] but what about god dealing with you and
[1:00:16] your relationship with him
[1:00:18] isn't that what this is for if it's not
[1:00:22] for that we
[1:00:23] all can go to a seminary and they teach
[1:00:25] a lot better than i can
[1:00:28] but what good would that do
[1:00:31] it wouldn't get us in a rapture because
[1:00:33] they don't deal with the relationship
[1:00:36] it deals with knowledge about god that's
[1:00:38] right
[1:00:39] and that just will puff you up because
[1:00:41] you'll know more than the next guy
[1:00:44] but love in the relationship
[1:00:48] that's what it defies yes amen let's
[1:00:50] stand together
[1:00:53] i want you to know there were four we
[1:00:56] were
[1:00:57] just beat the 50 mark on that one
[1:01:05] but we trust that there was enough there
[1:01:09] because my prayer was lord
[1:01:12] speak what you want
[1:01:16] and if we're provoked to get more
[1:01:19] serious about hearing his voice we spend
[1:01:24] more time seeking
[1:01:25] revelation then i've achieved my goal
[1:01:29] my desire
[1:01:32] we can't rely on church
[1:01:36] that's this is just the vehicle
[1:01:39] the tool that's god has provided for us
[1:01:43] and we can have confidence when we come
[1:01:45] we're not hearing some twisted up
[1:01:47] thing that you got to die aside to
[1:01:48] figure out what's word what's not
[1:01:50] but still we've got to hear him speak to
[1:01:53] us personally which has everything
[1:01:56] to do with the condition of our heart
[1:01:58] the attitude of our heart
[1:01:59] and where our expectation is when we
[1:02:01] come
[1:02:03] amen amen let's bow our heart
[1:02:07] pray with me dear father
[1:02:12] we want to thank you for the living word
[1:02:16] we want to thank you that you have a
[1:02:18] voice that we can hear
[1:02:22] you said my sheep hear my voice and they
[1:02:25] follow they follow me they follow the
[1:02:28] revelation
[1:02:29] they follow what's being spoken
[1:02:34] and lord i know it's a lot to ask
[1:02:39] but i believe it's your will that we
[1:02:42] spend
[1:02:43] time seeking you like
[1:02:46] like like paul sought you
[1:02:50] to hear your voice personally
[1:02:56] lord we weren't able to get to it
[1:02:59] but when we hear your voice
[1:03:02] oh your word says the
[1:03:06] righteous or as bold as a lion
[1:03:09] a revelation becomes unmovable and god
[1:03:16] we need that for our lives because the
[1:03:18] enemy is
[1:03:20] does a lot of stuff to us to try to get
[1:03:22] us off track
[1:03:24] amen so it truly is the most important
[1:03:28] thing that we can pray for
[1:03:31] i pray for every heart here lord
[1:03:34] and lord we're all different ages as it
[1:03:36] were in our relationship with you
[1:03:40] god i believe that you're able to break
[1:03:43] down to each of us wherever we're at
[1:03:45] or walk what you would have us to do
[1:03:49] to get to know you a little bit more
[1:03:52] calls us all to spend time praying
[1:03:56] lord and your word declares that you are
[1:03:59] a rewarder
[1:04:01] of them that diligently seek you
[1:04:04] what greater reward could we have than
[1:04:06] hearing you speak to us personally
[1:04:09] lord we want to become more like babes
[1:04:12] in
[1:04:13] the way that our attitudes
[1:04:17] need to be
[1:04:20] the lord we want to become more mature
[1:04:25] and obeying that word and walking
[1:04:28] faithfully to that word
[1:04:32] god give us that proper balance
[1:04:37] i humbly pray that you'd grant the
[1:04:39] desire of every heart here that's
[1:04:42] wanting to hear more from you personally
[1:04:44] lord
[1:04:46] bless each life at least each family
[1:04:50] each home lords
[1:04:55] help us to pray more in our homes
[1:04:59] god as we see this hour approaching
[1:05:06] lord all's we have is you you're the
[1:05:09] only
[1:05:10] thing in our lives that's we can counter
[1:05:14] it's true that's honest
[1:05:16] [Music]
[1:05:18] it's always a good report
[1:05:23] bless us lord as we're desiring
[1:05:27] to mature and get ready for this rapture
[1:05:31] god we want to hear from you more
[1:05:33] personally lord let there be some
[1:05:35] testimonies of you dealing with
[1:05:37] us in a personal way
[1:05:41] god i believe that would give us all of
[1:05:44] a greater
[1:05:44] faith what to be looking for
[1:05:49] change our our lives lord to be a little
[1:05:51] bit more like you
[1:05:53] amen we need you lord we need you
[1:05:59] we commit ourself your hands we trust
[1:06:02] lord that you bring to pass
[1:06:06] more revelation for us that we could
[1:06:09] keep walking day by day
[1:06:15] faith by faith personally
[1:06:18] spoken to us day by day
[1:06:23] god will be careful to give you the
[1:06:25] praise for all these things
[1:06:27] we're in debt to you form lord
[1:06:30] we ask it now in jesus christ's name
[1:06:33] amen amen thank you lord

[1:10:26] sermon

[1:10:30] afraid
[1:10:33] of even losing his life because he would
[1:10:36] have got to know
[1:10:37] jesus in giving his life physically

[1:12:15] i'm thinking about years back
[1:12:18] i was in the hospital and i remember i
[1:12:20] didn't have my bible with
[1:12:22] me and i was just so frustrated with
[1:12:25] that
[1:12:26] the lord spoke to me in my heart at that
[1:12:27] moment you are i am in you
[1:12:30] you know my word just stand on it
[1:12:34] take it take it to heart believe it and
[1:12:37] so even though it's in too much pain and
[1:12:39] frustration i just said okay lord
[1:12:42] i'm gonna sit up on the side of god
[1:12:44] thank you jesus for helping me sit on
[1:12:45] the back
[1:12:46] next thing lord help me take two steps
[1:12:48] thank you jesus
[1:12:50] you know and the more i get it the more
[1:12:52] i knew
[1:12:53] that within my soul jesus amen
[1:12:58] my faith just kept growing and growing
[1:13:01] up walking down the hall the walker it's
[1:13:04] wonderful
[1:13:10] that's beautiful
[1:13:14] man the bible does say that his word is
[1:13:17] in us amen we don't got to go to heaven
[1:13:20] to bring him down
[1:13:23] he it's nigh in our hearts amen yes
[1:13:26] sister
[1:13:27] yes you may be seated
[1:13:30] for just a second if you'd like um
[1:13:39] like last week one on the ground
[1:13:43] then like a couple days later i see this
[1:13:45] red stain on it
[1:13:49] how do i get this out what is it doing
[1:13:50] here i'm trying to move the lamp shade
[1:13:53] so
[1:13:53] i can figure out how to hide it
[1:13:56] it doesn't work
[1:14:00] so it's like all right i'm gonna get
[1:14:01] this light shade i'm gonna
[1:14:03] put the arsenal to it i'm gonna get this
[1:14:05] red stain out this is what i'm gonna do
[1:14:08] all right so i get all this stuff i mean
[1:14:10] i used everything on it
[1:14:12] nothing wrong
[1:14:27] this is
[1:14:54] amen
[1:15:09] wonderful praise god
[1:15:18] or whatever he does amen
[1:15:21] i love that i just i just want to
[1:15:26] give her uh or give a scripture for what
[1:15:29] our sister said
[1:15:32] says beloved now are we the sons of god
[1:15:35] right
[1:15:35] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:15:38] be but we know that when he shall appear
[1:15:40] we shall be like him
[1:15:42] and we shall see him as he is and every
[1:15:45] man
[1:15:46] that have this hope in him purifieth
[1:15:49] himself even as he is pure
[1:15:53] and i think we do that when we hear the
[1:15:55] word and god says this is what i want
[1:15:56] you to start working on
[1:15:58] real hard in your life because we
[1:16:02] we want things to be easy for us we we
[1:16:05] hear the word we get a revelation
[1:16:07] and it's always gone and sometimes god
[1:16:10] wants us to work at it
[1:16:12] yeah who oh yeah
[1:16:26] sure he did a good job
[1:17:00] and then i told her that she should give
[1:17:02] the testimony tonight and then when you
[1:17:04] and she decided but then when you said i
[1:17:07] want to hear more testimonies
[1:17:09] about what the went to laura
[1:17:14] she looked at me we didn't say anything
[1:17:16] but i said you should probably just give
[1:17:18] because you want to bless people that
[1:17:21] god is speaking
[1:17:22] and i need to help you with the
[1:17:24] absolutely stuff that's wrong in your
[1:17:26] heart in your life
[1:17:27] that's the whole reason you give you
[1:17:29] want one of bless people you want
[1:17:32] people need to know that god is real and
[1:17:34] that he is
[1:17:36] moving and speaking and changing that he
[1:17:38] has the power to do that just in the
[1:17:40] mundane thing of picking up
[1:17:42] a lampshade
[1:17:53] the beginning of what god wants he he'll
[1:17:56] use that to speak the same thing about
[1:17:57] this
[1:17:58] if god can do that in our home what all
[1:18:00] he'd be able to do in church
[1:18:02] you know what i'm saying and what makes
[1:18:03] church difficult is there's a lot of
[1:18:05] noises going on when you're just dealing
[1:18:07] with this landscape it's real quiet you
[1:18:09] know just you
[1:18:10] focus on the lord but when we come to
[1:18:12] church we got a lot of things going on a
[1:18:13] lot of
[1:18:14] a lot of people a lot of and you've got
[1:18:16] to stay real focused with you in the
[1:18:18] lord
[1:18:20] amen we're going to say something okay
[1:18:24] to thank the um of the world that's been
[1:18:26] coming across
[1:18:28] um you know when you were ministering
[1:18:30] the lord was just dealing with my heart
[1:18:32] about praise god living the life
[1:18:35] of christ and more with my life than my
[1:18:39] mouth
[1:18:40] beautiful when you read that quote about
[1:18:42] and i'll probably get wrong but
[1:18:43] that said live every day or preach a
[1:18:47] sermon every day and when necessary use
[1:18:48] words
[1:18:49] yeah you know that really spoke to my
[1:18:51] heart and
[1:18:52] i began to meditate upon the people that
[1:18:55] yielded to god
[1:18:56] when i came along and that helped me
[1:18:59] find christ
[1:19:00] and i began thinking about how
[1:19:03] just to show my gratitude i want to do
[1:19:06] that for somebody else
[1:19:07] amen praise god so i was meditating on
[1:19:10] that and
[1:19:11] tuesday came along and i woke up and of
[1:19:13] course you got a list of things to do
[1:19:16] and i just thought you know what there's
[1:19:19] always going to be a list of things to
[1:19:20] do in a world where you don't have a lot
[1:19:22] of choices
[1:19:23] i'm going to choose just not to do that
[1:19:25] right now that's good
[1:19:27] just spend some time with the lord so i
[1:19:29] went to the living room
[1:19:31] i called james out we just took a little
[1:19:33] bible study topic of
[1:19:35] a child hearing his mom's voice and once
[1:19:37] it gets older mom no longer needs to say
[1:19:39] her name when she leaves a message
[1:19:41] because
[1:19:41] that child knows that mom's voice and
[1:19:44] how we need to know jesus's voice and
[1:19:46] our heart like that not our mind not our
[1:19:48] understanding
[1:19:50] that connection is so clear he doesn't
[1:19:52] need to say it's him we know
[1:19:54] amen so after the bible study i going to
[1:19:57] do my dishes and
[1:19:58] that thought was just in my heart and
[1:20:02] my heart's desires i just want to get so
[1:20:04] close to him again
[1:20:05] amen it's beautiful connected
[1:20:08] so i put a sermon on and i was washing
[1:20:11] dishes and i'm listening to the song
[1:20:13] service that
[1:20:14] i just felt so overwhelmed by his
[1:20:17] presence
[1:20:18] and i'm i'm washing dishes and i'm like
[1:20:20] what am i going to do with this like
[1:20:22] who am going to tell like because
[1:20:23] there's nobody around and i'm just
[1:20:25] worshiping him and
[1:20:26] i'm almost feeling like i'm just going
[1:20:28] to come bust because i'm so thankful for
[1:20:30] his
[1:20:30] love and
[1:20:34] i said in my heart lord what did i do
[1:20:35] with this
[1:20:37] and my phone went off
[1:20:40] and it was this soul looking for help
[1:20:43] and prayer
[1:20:44] but in that moment i heard what you said
[1:20:46] in that sermon i talked about every time
[1:20:48] i talk to somebody i'm really dealing
[1:20:49] with their soul
[1:20:50] not whatever they're doing needing help
[1:20:53] with
[1:20:54] and they needed help but in that moment
[1:20:56] it was like the lord said you desire to
[1:20:58] help
[1:20:59] here's your door and so i began just
[1:21:02] giving the word to them and you know
[1:21:03] praying with them and helping them
[1:21:05] and of course trisha took over and i
[1:21:07] wanted to fix it you know i want to give
[1:21:08] him all of it
[1:21:09] real quick and the lord just spoke and
[1:21:12] said no
[1:21:13] no remember i am the one
[1:21:16] just put their hand in mind it's
[1:21:19] beautiful
[1:21:20] that's a beautiful testament i was so
[1:21:22] overwhelmed that i took all of that
[1:21:24] wanting to fix all of that
[1:21:25] energy and i just went tanner's seating
[1:21:28] for them
[1:21:29] and it fell in my heart lord i found one
[1:21:31] i found one of your sheeps they're over
[1:21:33] here
[1:21:34] here they are overwhelmed that like you
[1:21:36] just overwhelmed me
[1:21:37] [Music]
[1:21:38] and i sat in awe the very thing i was
[1:21:41] meditating
[1:21:42] and desiring to be god didn't
[1:21:46] honor my works of looking for somebody
[1:21:48] to talk to he didn't honor
[1:21:49] my thoughts or knowledge of how i was
[1:21:51] going to do it
[1:21:52] but just when i was focused on wanting
[1:21:54] to love him yes
[1:21:56] he brought the opportunity right for me
[1:21:58] it's beautiful
[1:21:59] beautiful i was just talking to anne i
[1:22:02] think it was yesterday
[1:22:04] about how we need to pray
[1:22:07] put our confidence in praying
[1:22:10] for the need because
[1:22:14] ian is she'll do anything anything
[1:22:17] for anybody she's just that way she's
[1:22:20] that way
[1:22:20] and she wants to do more when she's done
[1:22:22] doing she wants to do more
[1:22:25] and she has a burden for a number
[1:22:28] of people and i love that and wants to
[1:22:30] do more
[1:22:32] and sometimes we just we just gotta
[1:22:34] trust the lord
[1:22:36] just pray just pray that god would move
[1:22:39] in that behalf so i appreciate that that
[1:22:42] testimony
[1:22:43] and you you venturing off into trust
[1:22:46] more than hand doing it
[1:22:50] and brother i know brother ryan really
[1:22:52] appreciate this testimony no because he
[1:22:54] shared so many testimonies like this in
[1:22:56] our men's meeting
[1:22:57] about trying to do the testifying and
[1:23:00] not letting the testifier
[1:23:03] you know do it all and and staying out
[1:23:05] of it
[1:23:06] so it's just beautiful we're growing
[1:23:10] we're growing in the lord and that's
[1:23:12] what's important here
[1:23:15] and i i love it i love these testimonies
[1:23:18] and we just we just keep growing keep
[1:23:20] growing before you know it
[1:23:23] we're going to be ready amen sister
[1:23:32] kathleen
[1:23:45] but the scripture that keeps coming to
[1:23:47] me and it's just like
[1:23:48] like it's all over the place when god's
[1:23:51] trying to tell you something it won't
[1:23:52] just be one thing
[1:24:00] um
[1:24:11] that's good in the discouragement
[1:24:16] um
[1:24:19] the physical realm with the health
[1:24:21] issues
[1:24:22] that are going on in the world in my own
[1:24:24] things
[1:24:25] but in just everyday life and walking as
[1:24:30] a christian and
[1:24:32] how long lord you know am i am i really
[1:24:36] the person that's longing to see you
[1:24:40] and am i the person in my longing
[1:24:56] um
[1:24:58] yeah and amen that's the word that kept
[1:24:59] coming to me as you were satisfied is
[1:25:01] that word
[1:25:02] trust and whether it was
[1:25:05] our sister just having faith to get up
[1:25:08] out of this edge of the bed and start
[1:25:11] walking
