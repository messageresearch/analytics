changed our vow nature to a Christ Christlike nature today we're so grateful to the Lord to praise him for this well I don't believe we'll ever be uh that that debt will ever be paid we'll ever feel satisfied I think they'll be getting Praises throughout eternity I believe that with all my heart well God bless you so good to be in the house of the Lord today and want to welcome our guests with us Ryan was able to spend some time with us in the men's meeting we sh certainly enjoyed sharing the Plan of Salvation with our brother and I believe that God has something special for him he seems to be just a a nice young man amen before we enter into the scriptures let's look to the Lord in a word of prayer and just ask His blessings on the reading of the word heavenly father thank you that you've given us all health and strength to be here know that some Lord are not here uh for uh the reasons of sickness but Lord you've given us strength and we appreciate that thank you for all your blessings thank you for safe travels getting here and thank you Lord that we have the promise that as we have gathered here that you promis to be in the midst now Lord maybe our eyes and our ears sometimes our feelings don't often uh vindicate that but by faith we believe it and that settles it Lord may you come in a special way now and unveil your word to us encourage us we've come tonight to be encouraged to be strengthened in you to be drawn Closer to You Lord we just ask that you'd meet the needs that we would have in our lives there's some standing here that just Lord need to walk in the Plan of Salvation there's some here Lord that need a real sanctify and a real Deliverance in their life Lord there's some here today that that need the baptism of the Holy Ghost Lord there's needs that we have and Lord we know that we've come to the right source for you uh are the one that can supply every need according to your riches and Glory so we commit this service with all of our needs into your hands and we trust you now in Jesus precious name amen amen in the book of 2 Corinthians chapter 3 we're going to read one verse of scripture there and have you be seated 2 Corinthians chapter 3 praise the Lord good is he sister Lori how's the temperature everybody we can get it up just a little bit if anybody's uh little nippy as long as you promise not to get tired amen second Corinthians chapter 3 verse number five reads not that we are sufficient icient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God Amen God bless you you may be seated we want to talk about our sufficiency where it comes from and just entitle this message if we could little is sufficient if God is in it little is sufficient if God is in it you ever been in a situation where you just you're just gonna like you're going to take charge and you're going to handle it and you you just feel like you can just do this thing but you find out that you weren't able to take care of it sometimes we look to ourselves as that we're able to handle a situation without God but I believe with God we can have confidence in handling the situation but it's recognizing where our help really does come from because sometimes our our own intelligence even sometimes our past experiences if we think we had something to do with something that good that had had happened even that thought can get us to thinking that our sufficiency is in ourselves in our own ability and um you know when Paul said forgetting those things which are behind I think there's certain things that we we should set behind us and and not think about them any bit more and uh and and and look to the Lord for our sufficiency for the future amen so we know the scriptures here it's talking about the the ministry that God is has given us that we are able ministers and and that our sufficiency is not of ourselves to think anything of ourselves but our sufficiency is of God and as long as we can keep focused that God is the reason for every victory in our life I believe we can keep moving forward with the Lord It's a time that we begin to want people to look at us to to think that there's something about us that they should look to I remember one one time there was a a man that he was begging and he looked to Peter and John and said you know give us something and he said don't look upon us as if if we have anything to give but what we have is is of god such as I have give I Thee in the name of the Lord Jesus or this this one and there was a big thing where they came and you know what what caused this this this man to to be able to see when he couldn't see before or to be healed when he wasn't healed before and they they they kept saying don't look at us it was Jesus and we need to remember Jesus is the answer to take care of all of our problems in life all of them amen let's take a look here at this story in St John chapter 6 verse2 for a little bit the story of Jesus feeding the 5000 with just a boy's lunch everybody remember that story what about the rest of you did you forget it that's why we're reading it today because you forgot the story all right St John chapter 6 verse number two and a great multitude followed Jesus because they saw his miracles which he had did on them that were diseased and Jesus went up into the mountain and there he sat with his disciples and the Passover and the Passover a feast of the Jews was nine and when Jesus then lifted up his eyes and saw a great company unto him he saith unto Phillip whence shall we buy bread that these may eat so Jesus cared about the people that were with him just naturally that they needed to be fed and look at verse six and this he said to prove him for he himself knew what he would do Jesus Jesus knew how these people were going to be fed but he was trying to put this responsibility upon Phillip that something needs to be done because he had compassion upon these people he kep and I think one place it talked about that he had he saw them as sheep having no Shepherd that they needed someone but Jesus wanted to prove to his disciples just how great he is he wanted to prove that to Phillip and to his disciples the Bible tells us that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever he is a great God Jesus is the key to success the Bible tells us that all things were and are created by Him including the squirrels that brother Brandon spoke into existence they really came from the word of God and his disciples were not the answer notice the disciples were not the answer Philip wasn't the answer the money was not the answer but the disciples were actually the instrument that God used to provide food to the people God was the answer the disciples were the instrument that God used to get the food to the people it's really no different than today but the food came from God and Jesus created the bread I meant to bring some bread today we got from Panera Bread my son asked me if I wanted he couldn't eat it so I ate half of it I thought well I could just use this today because this is a a really good prop we could use this but Jesus created the bread and the disciples passed it out and it's no different than this very moment we're sitting here in church the real bread the real breaking the real Revelation the real unveiling the real word comes from God but it's the disciples that hand out the bread to us right in John 6:35 says Jesus said I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never thirst so Jesus Christ is the bread of life amen he's the spiritual Mana so at this this this which we're reading this great this great story that is known all over the world that Jesus fed 5,000 uh men with just a boy's a lad's lunch the Bible says but it was a perfect type of Christ being able to supply everybody's need spiritually and Christ is the spiritual man or he's the word of God and that every man must live by and he breaks the bread of life he gives it to his disciples through the five-fold ministry and they give it to the body and I just want to read this I want to if I could go off here to Ephesians 4:1 we'll just look at this and come back to the story and God gave some he didn't give everybody that claims it but he gave some Apostles and some prophets and some evangelists and some pastors and teachers and what did he give them for to use them to give the word of God out to the people so that there would be a perfecting of the Saints right not not just to eat about some ideas and learn but to perfect us to work the ministry and for the edifying of the whole body of Christ and I want you to put yourself in this condition here I think that all of us should have a goal to be perfected amen I think we should all roll up our sleeves and say I owe it to Jesus Christ to work in the ministry amen and I believe that we should be willing when we come to church to not worry only about us that we should actually try to ify somebody else we should have a concern for the other part of the body it's called love and how long do we got to do this we got to do this every day till we all come into the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man unto the measure of the Statue of the fullness of Christ now has anybody seen this person yet that we're describing and this got to become the whole body but I just want to say it like this we need to be continue having the mindset of perfection and working the ministry and edifying the body until we see this transpire amen and in other words you don't do it until you feel like it when you don't feel like it this needs to become the purpose of the Christian because this is the reason that God sent a fful Ministry this is the reason that God gives the bread of life and here's the end result here he wants to get us away from being little children that we henceforth be no more children tossed to and fro carried about with every wind you ever you ever see a leaf in the wind and it blows from here and then over here and then over there just it's not stable the word of God is to stable the Christian amen it's to make them solid by the sight of men and the cunning craftiness whereby they lie in we to deceive we know that is just the enemy isn't that not right so God's goal for us is to speak the truth in love and that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ from whom the whole body fitly joined together compacted by every by that which which every joint supplieth to the effectual working in the measure of every part making increase of the body unto the edifying of itself you know verse 16 just seems to me like a machine like an automatic machine like automated automation we are all supposed to fit together amen not well you need to fit me and if you don't fit me it's your problem that ain't Christianity the whole body fitly joined together anybody ever try to put a piece of thread in a needle it's not easy you're going like this like I don't know how many times you're liing it you're trying to get it in there sometimes it's not very easy working with others with other Christians but you know what if you just speak the truth and Love and You grow up in Christ you can usually get it right in there the whole body fitly joined together every joint supplieth that means I need you to supply love grace mercy I need you to supply Christ because that's what my joint needs well I I think think we should have a Hallelujah on that one myself that's how I feel I know it's it's hard but you know what Christ supplies Christ the flesh supplies flesh Christ supplies Christ according to the effectual working the effectual working I mean some good things are happening when every joint is supplying the love of God effectual working in the measure of every part making an increase of the body amen it's not all about you it's not about you increasing it's about you having a heart for others if there's one thing I know about Jesus Christ it is this Christ lived for others amen if that is the nature that's inside of you that is Christ amen no greater love than a man have this and he lay down his life for his friends to the edifying of itself all right let's go back to John there John we're going to pick that up in verse number seven chapter 6 Philip answered him 200 penny worth of bread is not sufficient for them that everyone of them may take even a little and eat and one of his disciples and Andrew Simon Peter uh brother saith unto him there is a lad here which have five barley Loaves and two small fishes but what are they among so many and Jesus said make the men to sit down and I think in Luke we could find out that's in groups of 50 he had him sit down now there was much grass in the place so the men sat down in in number about 5,000 so we know here that there was 5,000 men but if you go to Matthew you'll find out there was 5,000 men besides the women and the children so I want to tell you there is about 15 20 possibly 25,000 people that are sitting in the grass in groups of 50 just want to get a a little concept of what this miracle really was and Jesus had compassion on the multitude because he saw them as as no one directed over their lives can you imagine somebody that is your headship that is just leading you all over the place can you imagine a president leading his country down the tubes nobody would want that nobody would want to work for a boss who the boss the only thing he thought about was himself and didn't care about the people we wouldn't want to go to a church where the pastor really didn't know what he was talking about or his only motive was to get money or a big following or who knows what he was after so Jesus J has compassion upon everybody's soul and he wants everybody's soul to follow the Right leader amen Paul said follow me as I follow Christ it's okay to follow somebody but I am telling you if they're not following Christ step back because Christ is not going to lead somebody who's being led by the devil to lead you to Christ in everything they do I'm saying God can't use them once in a while because he can he can use a donkey but be in in reality we need to get serious about leadership we need to get serious about leadership so Jesus made them to sit down where there was much grass and Psalms 23 tells us the Lord is my shepherd I shall not want he maketh me to lie down in Green Pastures amen he leadth me beside Still Waters he restoreth my soul he leadth me in Paths of righteousness for his name's sake and I believe that Jesus really had a heart to help others he didn't have a heart to say look at me what I can do a heart to help others all right verse 11 and Jesus Took the loaves when he had given thanks he distributed to his disciples and his disciples to them that were set down and likewise of the fishes as many as they would whatever they wanted they could have can you imagine all you can eat smoggers Borg you ever go to smoggers Borg and you but you could only get one plate this is all you want you could have that's the God we serve amen we serve a god that is able to give us whatever we want right he said I'll do exceedingly above all that you would ask or even think and they the Bible says verse 12 when they were filled [Applause] filled it takes a lot to be filled doesn't it it does I mean 20,000 people come on that that's I don't think Franken MTH goes through that in a day when they were filled he said unto his disciples gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost now those that don't like leftovers we got to look at this scripture here gather up the fragments that remain that nothing be lost therefore they gathered them together and filled 12 baskets with the fragments of the five barley Loaves and the REM and which remained over and above that which they had eaten I just think this is an amazing miracle I would happen to believe if there were 25,000 people that there were many people that didn't see Jesus multiply the bread they were too far away but it happened and when the disciples went over there to that 4,000 people over there I'm sure they were saying Jesus created this bread and then they were there thinking did he really do it because I didn't see it imagine there were some Phillips wasn't it Phillip I won't believe Oh Thomas that's right it was Thomas I won't believe unless I see and I feel and we're here as Believers today we're not here as sightseers or feelers we're here as Believers in the church if one lad could eat two fishes and Five Loaves of of bread through my calculations Jesus probably created 40,000 to 50,000 fish and 100,000 to 125,000 loaves of bread for about 20,000 people this was no small miracle that happened this was a big thing and I'll say it like this God took something that was so small now do you think he really even needed the boy's lunch to do what he did he created heavens and earth but he used the boy's lunch he took something that was so little would look insufficient to meet the need amen little is sufficient if God is in it little is all you need if God is in it you don't need anything great you don't need anything big you don't need about to see it you just need to get God in your problems God in your problems if God is able to take five loaves of bread and two fish and make it sufficient enough to feed 20,000 people then don't you think that God is sufficient enough to meet every possible need you would have amen that's we're serving the same God he's not here in a natural form but he is here in a spiritual form and all he's looking is for someone to because as he wanted to prove to Phillip and The Disciples of just how great he is God wants to prove to us right and he wants us to take him at his word he doesn't want us to look at our abilities how much money we got how much popularity we got how many friends we got he wants us to recognize that we are insufficient of what we have to do anything and our sufficiency is of god am and that is enough that is enough if you could have Faith as a grain of mustard seed you can say unto this mountain be thou removed am little is sufficient if God is in it Philippians 4:19 says but my God shall supply all your need according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus I like the way Paul said that he said my God my God shall supply all your need and that's the god that we need to look to to supply our needs if we're ever going to grow and become into the statue of a perfect man or or be able to handle situations better and I I'm all for falling I am because it's impossible for us not to fall what's important is that when we fall we get back back up if a righteous man falls seven times seven times he'll get back up God wants us to grow how are we going to grow if we don't make mistakes we don't fall but we got to start looking to him to supply our needs amen you know what God wants us to do just for a second God tells us pay your ties you know what that means to somebody to give a little bit of money in the office offering once in a while that's what that means to some people but we're promised that if we do our part that our barns will just overflow and that we'll have to build new barns I never made that promise and I never concocted the idea that's just what I found in the word of God and you think about the little bit that you you got to give to God Faithfully that little bit that little bit we hang on to is what could be the difference of being blessed by God look if I told you look I want you to give me $100 and by next week Wednesday you come here I'll I'll make sure you got a thousand you would sayyou know what that sounds like a good deal James would be coming to me in the office in the back and he' say can I borrow 100 bucks from you I want to give it to you we would do that it's a good deal but if we don't believe that we'll be blessed by giving ties we won't give our ties and I'm not saying we should ever give money because of getting blessed I'm not saying that I'm just saying God blesses you for obeying his word little is sufficient if God is in it amen doesn't matter how little you got God will bless you amen let's when Sarah laughed remember Sarah she laughed within herself about conceiving a child in her old age the Lord said un to Abraham is there anything too hard for the the Lord is there not one thing is too hard for God but for what for whatever re reason we lose contact with God and we try to start handling things ourselves now Sarah didn't have much to work with she was an old AG sister with a dead womb there was no medical help for her there was no scientific help for her everything was stacked against her she had little to work with but little is sufficient if God is in it and if God speaks to you and says it's going to happen you're a child of the king we sung about it then you believe it if you believe God's going to take care of you you believe it amen because you just need his word on it and my God shall supply all your need is there anything too hard for the Lord God we we you know we can actually take a god who's capable of doing exceedingly above all that we could ask and think we can take an amazing God who created the Earth that we stand on eat the food he created we can take an amazing God like that and we can handcuff him to where he can't move in our life because of unbelief now Abraham's testimony in Romans 4:20 says he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God you ever go through a trial and you're just feeling like I don't feel like praising God come on now it's time to wake up in church today we're CH we're we're we're children of Abraham amen he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God you want to know if you're strong in the faith you're praising God in your trial because it you know you got to go beyond how you feel you got to go beyond what you can see you got to go beyond what you can hear and you're looking to the Unseen through eyes of faith and Just Praise Him for the finished product you know what I'm so glad that there's a God that we can serve he's a real God am he's not some picture on a wall he's some not some religion but there's a realness to almighty God that you can you can serve with all your heart and being fully persuaded that what he had promised what God had promised he was able also to perform God is able sometimes all we have to all we have to hang on to is a promise in his word we don't even hear it like an audible voice we don't have a dream we don't have a prophecy alls we have is a promise in the word amen to hang on to and it seems so little but I'll say it like this little is sufficient if God is in it and he is in his word we can have confidence in that and we need to be looking to the word to take care of our needs care of our problems is there anything too hard for the Lord Jeremiah 32:17 Jeremiah 32:17 we were close to that in Jeremiah 29 ah Lord God behold thou has made the Heaven and the Earth by thy great power and stretched out arm and there there is nothing too hard for thee what a testimony now we would we would it would do us good if we literally got up and we read that scripture every day than wondering how in the world we're going to get out of our problems we just need to testify about how great God is there is no situation that is too difficult for God to handle not one when our our backs remember the the children children of Israel their backs well I don't know if their backs I think their their back was facing Pharaoh's Army and they were staring at the Red Sea and they had no place to go right but what they did have is they had god with them they had the word of God and the word of God now God never told the children of Israel hey when you leave when you leave out of Egypt I'm going to have I'm going to put you right in the pickle and you're you're not you're not going to you're not going to know what to do he didn't say that because he wants to prove himself we cannot expect God to tell us how to fix our problems he brings us to the Red Sea he brings us to uh Wilderness experiences for the purpose to prove himself and to prove us whether we're going to trust him and whether we're going to believe and I'll say it like this God knew what he was going to do when they got into the Red Sea just like he he knew what he was going to do with the children of Israel or like what he was going to do with his disciples with the with the boy's lunch he knew what he was going to do little is sufficient of God's in it they didn't need a bridge that went over the Red Sea they didn't need a map to go some other way what they needed is a relationship with God to trust God that's what we need today we need a relationship with God that'll help us to trust him more the Bible tells us in 2 Corinthians 9:8 that God is able to make all grace abound towards you that you may always having all sufficiency in all things may abound to every good work God is able to do this for you I can't do that for myself I can't Supply everybody need I can't do that but God can you know the song goes I can't make the Stars to shine I can't make the moon to shine I I can't I can't make the moon to I can't make the wind to blow I can't heal bodies brother B often said I can't heal man doctors can't heal they can put together they can take out but it takes God to heal and God is our provider he's Jehovah Gyra God is able to make all Grace sufficient to your personal life to your needs I mean if we want to see God more in our life then we need to to trust God with what little we have and what little we have is God we have God that's all we need we don't need some Arnold short singer with his built and you know his ability to to fly here here and there and superm's and Batman's and all the mans out there we have Jesus Christ he's our man amen amen it's all we need little is sufficient if God is in he's all we need Philippians 4:13 says I can do all things through Christ which strengtheneth me I'm okay with being dumb I am I I am okay with that I've always been okay with that because the more talent you have the more you begin to you know depend on your talent and to be honest with you I want to be able to do everything through Christ amen everything through Christ he deserves the glory for it all anyways with what little I have I can do all things because little is sufficient if God is in it real some quick scriptures here before we get to a story I want to spend a few minutes on Jude 1:24 says God is able to keep you from falling you talk about sufficiency God is the one that keeps you from falling amen James 1:21 that the word of God is able to save your soul that's a good one for brother Ryan here God the word of God is able to save our souls 2 Timothy 1:12 for the which cause I also suffer these things nevertheless I am not ashamed for I know in whom I have believed and am persuaded that he he is able to keep that which I have committed unto him unto him against that day I'm so glad that I have someone watching over my soul amen he's the keeper of my soul he's the Lover of My Soul he is the soul maker he's the one that's going to take us through yes but what we have to do is commit oursel to him amen commit the soul to him amen not just commit salvation to him commit our soul to him commit commit our life to him am and then he'll keep us Ephesians 3:20 now unto him that is able you can write this one down if you'd like now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above everything all that we could ask or think according to the power that worketh where in us you know there's a power in us that's not of ourselves there's a power in us that's not of ourselves it's of God he is the one that keeps us amen all right 2 Corinthians 12:7 we'll have to go through this kind of fast second Corinthians 12:7 and this is here the story of Paul talking again about the sufficiency and lest I should remember he was one that had a lot of Revelations is caught up to the third heaven and God blessed him to to what so much word that he had confidence that he wrote 14 books of the Bible that you and I basically Liv by we live by amen andless I should be exalted above measure through the abundance of Revelations there was given to me a thorn in the flesh does anybody have a thorn in the flesh a thorn in the flesh the messenger of Satan to Buffet me lest I should be exalted above measure for this thing for this thing I besought the Lord three times that he would just take it away from me and he said unto me my grace is really what's sufficient for you for my strength is made perfect in your situation my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore I rather glory in my infirmities that the power of Christ May rest upon me therefore I take pleasure in infirmities in reproaches and necessities and persecutions and distress what for Christ's sake it needs to be for the reason of Christ though for when I am weak then I am strong amen now the whole world is suffering but they're not suffering for Christ's sake but when it's talking about the furtherance of the kingdom of God or the furtherance of coming to the Statue of a perfect man we should take pleasure and the the things that we go through and Jesus Is Telling Paul here that my grace is sufficient for thee God was teaching Paul to recognize that there was something greater than every need that he had in his life and that need was God's grace that's what was sufficient they don't need need to look to your own abilities little is enough little is enough if God is in it amen and God was also teaching Paul how to be content because he prayed three times here's the prophet of God he wanted it for the right reasons and God said no after three times of praying I believe God was also teaching Paul how to be content he says here in Philippians 4:11 not that I speak in respect of want for I have learned in whatsoever State I am in there with to be content I like how the NIV puts this he says I know what it what it is to be in need Paul says I know what it is to be in need for I have learned to be content with whatsoever the circumstance you talk about the power of God is learning to trust God that much and you know something you got to learn you're not born with that amen all right let's try to look at this last story before we leave it's in 1 Corinthians chapter or 1 Samuel chapter 16 this is a story of David here David when he's chosen to be king what I like about this story is that there was nothing in it that David had that really shows his sufficiency of himself but he was just one that trusted God and starting off with verse verse one and the Lord said unto Samuel how long will thou mourn for Saul seeing I have rejected him from reigning over Israel fill thy horn with oil and go I will send thee to Jesse the betham for I have provided me a king among his sons and Samuel said how can I go if Saul hears about it he will kill me and the Lord said take a heer with thee and say I am come to sacrifice to the Lord the Lord has his way of getting the thing done right and called Jesse to the sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou shalt do and thou shall anoint unto me him whom I name unto thee what I love about this is God did not even tell his profit everything he didn't just do this be faithful with this when you get done doing this I will meet you here and I will tell you what to do next we don't need to know everything we need to be faithful with what God tells us to do and Samuel did that which the Lord spake and came to Bethlehem and the Elders of the Town actually trembled at his coming and said you you come you are you coming peacefully is everything okay and he said peacefully I am come to sacrifice unto the Lord sanctify yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice and he Sanctified Jesse and his sons and called them to the sacrifice and it came to pass when they were come that he looked on elab Eli and said surely the Lord's anointed is before him now this is the Prophet this is this is the one and the Lord said unto Samuel here it is brother Ron you quoted it in men me look not on his countenance or his height or the statue because I have refused him for the Lord seeth not as man seeth for man lookth on the outward appearance but the Lord lookth on the heart remember David was a man after God's Own Heart isn't that beautiful you can come to church and be a man after God's Own Heart I think that's one thing that God wants us to give more to him is a heart amen then Jesse called aadab and made him pass before Samuel and he said neither have the Lord chosen this then Jesse made shama to pass by and he said said neither have the Lord chosen this again Jesse made Seven of his sons to pass before Samuel and Samuel said unto Jesse the Lord have not chosen these wow and Samuel said unto Jesse are here all thy sons and he said There remaineth Yet the youngest and behold he keepeth the sheep and Samuel said unto Jesse send forth and tou him for we will not sit down till he come hither Samuel was there on a mission and he sent and brought him in now he was Ruddy he was readyy and with all of a beautiful countenance and goodly to look to and the Lord said arise anoint him for this is he and Samuel took the Horn of oil and anointed him in the midst of the Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came Upon David from that day forward so Samuel rose up and went to Rama I'll just say it like this in everybody's mind David was not the guy he didn't look the part he didn't even play the part but you know what he had the heart of the part he had the heart of a part his heart and I'll say it like this God is teaching Samuel don't look at the outside but look at the heart man looks on the outside God looks on the heart and when I thought about this story I thought you know what little is sufficient if God is in it the other brothers were they were bigger they were taller they were stronger but God wasn't in that God isn't in a ability God's in the heart I think about David's life David was in trouble with a bear with a lion with Goliath he was in trouble with Saul even his own men rejected him as a king he became the rejected King he really didn't have a lot going for him but you know what his sufficiency was in Christ he trusted in God and we can do that you know David was King for quite a while while there was Saul was still there and Saul was not a very humble man was he he was a proud man and he actually wanted to kill David and David didn't do anything wrong the Bible says that God that evil spirit went from the Lord unto Saul to to to torment him and David actually God gave David a gift and then a desire to help Saul to calm him down it was like God had this whole thing in in in motion of what he was doing and it took time and it wasn't just David was King and okay we kick Saul out and you know we got a new president it didn't happen like that but if we can learn anything from the story of David's life that David didn't have a lot of backing he didn't have a lot of help he didn't have a lot going for him in fact I when I look at David's life I say he had more problems and trials than he ever had victories but you know his character grew quite a bit he didn't only get himself in trouble he he got in trouble by by so many means but God provided for him through every situation little is sufficient if God is in it let's Stand Together little is sufficient if God is in it I want God in my life I want to start trusting him more you know most everything we do we do by feel I feel like pizza tonight you do too okay I feel like a Hershey bar I feel but when it comes to God we just got to trust him trust are sufficient ienc Y is in God Amen let's sing How Great Is Our God how great is our God how great is our God how great is his word he's the greatest one that ever was heard he rolled back the water of the mighty Red Sea and he said I will lead you put your trust in me how great is our God how great is his

of David Lord you are all that we have need of father I pray that you would bless each one of us to depend upon you a little bit more to trust in you a little bit more no matter if we don't got everything we feel that we need to have to help through our situations maybe maybe there's some here today Lord that's just Desiring something in their nature uh to be dealt with to be taken care of maybe there's someone here that says I just I want to drop off this one Habit in my life and I want to have the habit of Christ to replace that Lord I pray that this these this one or these ones who whatever it might be whoever it might be that they could look to you as their sufficiency to see that accomplished that they wouldn't be looking at their ability but that just be looking looking to trust in you a little bit more to be serious about how great you really are father maybe there's someone here that's just been they they've been struggling physically and they they've been doing the things that they feel that they they need to do to take care of the situation and nothing's transpiring may they they remember Lord that you you took a lad's lunch and you were able to Prov divide the needs of many thousands of people you're no different today you're the same yesterday today and forever Lord I just pray for every heart here every believer here Lord may we all stretch forth our confidence in you because you truly are the one that is our sufficiency we love you we commit ourselves to you today and trust you for these things in Jesus Christ
