prepare you to Worship in heaven you got to get used to be worshiping down here with the Saints down here because up there you're I don't if you're inhibited here you're going to be inhibited there

Hebrews chapter 3 going to read verse 1 through six amen amen wherefore holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him as also Moses was faithful in all of his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much that he who hath built the house hath more honor than the house for every house is builded by some man but he that has built all things is God and Moses verily was faithful in all of his house as a servant for a testimony of those things which are be spoken after but Christ as a son over his own house whose house we are If We Hold Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end amen shall we bow our heads just a moment our heavenly father we thank thee tonight for the love of God that shed abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost and how that Jesus came into the world and died for us sinners and rose again the third day according to the scriptures and set at the right hand of the Majesty of high tonight making living to make intercessions Upon Our confession and tonight we confess all of our sins and our trespasses and the sins of our transgression the sin of omission whatever it might have been that we've done or said or thought that was displeasing to our Heavenly Father we now humbly come to the Lord Jesus and ask that his blood atone for our sins we didn't mean to do it Lord forgive us you know our hearts and we pray that you'll sanctify every person in here tonight with the holy's presence and may thy great August presence baptize everyone with the Holy Spirit and may great signs and wonders be wrought for the glory of God through doing this may The Sinner man or woman or the alien away from God may they come and sweetly and humbly bow at the foot of the cross and give their lives to him who died for this purpose for we ask it in his name amen amen you may be seated amen praise the Lord amen nobody can pray as good as brother brandom amen so I want to speak a little text out of verse one here where it says consider the Apostle and high priest of our profession the other day I was I was working out and normally when I get on my elliptical and and start running to keep my heart nice and healthy I put a tape on and brother Brandon it was it was preaching a message it was called a power of decision and in there he said living to make intercessions Upon Our confession and I got to thinking about that how that God can only move based on our confession amen hadn't really thought about it too much so Paul when he wrote here to the Hebrews I want you to just notice he says where for Holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling and that's us amen it's a blessing that God knows us as holy Brethren partakers of the Heavenly calling he says consider the Apostle and the high priest of our profession Christ Jesus who was faithful to him that appointed him Jesus was faithful to God himself amen he says as also Moses was faithful in all of his house for this man was counted worthy of more Glory than Moses in as much as he who hath built the house hath more honor than the house itself amen you can always tell the quality of the house based on the Builder some Builders are big well-known but they build junk houses it is it's very true I'm not going to say any names but amen so he says every house is built by some man but he that built all things is God and Moses verily was faithful in all of his house as a servant for the testimony of those things which were to be spoken after so Moses he had a office that he was supposed to fulfill and he's referred to as the lawgiver and he was faithful in giving the law but that as far as he could take the children of God Amen he says but Christ as a son over his own house whose house we are praise the Lord praise the Lord amen If We Hold Fast the confidence and the rejoicing of the Hope firm unto the end so we just want I I was in the office and I was reviewing my notes and all of a sudden I realized I was like I'm as guilty as brother I said oh my we're not talking about the high priest we're talking about confession and that God is making intercession for you based on your confession so we're going to just zero in on that there's much to be said about Jesus Christ the high priest but first we need to go back and look in Leviticus chapter 16 we need to look we're going to read just a few scriptures here and this is when the high priest was first revealed up to this time there was not a high priest there was not there was not an approach to God they they knew God as the pillar of fire and they knew God because God was in Moses doing things but they didn't know how to approach God you know when they went to the to mount C and they saw the Thunder and the lightning and everything else and they saw what God was they were all afraid and said don't speak to us let this man speak to us so God said okay this is what I'm going to do then so in verse 29 he says and this should be a statue for every what no I said verse 30 I'm sorry verse 30 for on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you to cleanse you that you may be clean from all of your sins for the Lord now you notice in this scripture just leave that up there when you right now there's lots of things that you can watch on the news about courts and who's in the courts and and you know things that are going on well the way a Court is set up is you have a judge you have a jury and then they have you the guilty party and then you have to plead your case but you're not allowed to plead your case the way the law is set up the law says this isn't the place for you to talk and if you can afford an attorney we will provide you an attorney and your attorney will talk for you and if you jump up and you start beating on the table and everything else while the proceedings going on the judge has the right to say sit down this isn't a place for you your attorney's got the floor so if you notice that's exactly what verse 30 says verse 30 says on that day shall the priest make an atonement for you you can't go in and make an atonement for yourself you'd like to plead your case before God but you can't you cannot plead your case before God because all men is guilty man has no right to no right to even approach God right I mean if a Holy Angel is filthy in his sight where are we even standing amen amen so he says on that day the day that that priest will make an atonement for you to cleanse you that you may be clean from all your sins before the Lord it shall be a Sabbath of rest unto you praise the Lord it'll be a time when you no longer are worried about whether I'm I am righteous or not because it when you find out that God has has a high priest has somebody who's going to make an atonement for your sins and he has accepted that to cleanse you in his sight he said you're going to rest it's going to be a Sabbath to you amen and you shall afflict your souls by a statute forever and the reason that you afflict your souls is because your soul is very prideful given the first chance it gets up and says look at that I'm free from [Laughter] sin but Moses God told Moses he said no no it'll be a Sabbath but you should afflict your soul forever and the priest whom he shall anoint so see even the priest has to be anointed by a higher power I want you to notice how this is worded in verse 32 it says the priest whom he shall anoint and whom he shall consecrate to minister in the priest's office in his father's stead shall make the atonement and shall put on the linen clothes even the holy garments amen and he shall make an atonement now watch watch this he shall make an atonement for the holy Sanctuary that's the inner place and he shall make an atonement for the Tabernacle of the congregation and he shall make an atonement for the Altar and he shall make an atonement for all of the priests the priests can't even make an atonement for themselves only the high priest can do this amen and for all the people of the congregation and this should be an everlasting statute unto you to make an atonement for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year and he did as the Lord commanded Moses Amen brother Brenham said as I was with with Moses he says remember he can never do anything for you until first you have to say he's done it you have to believe him it's called client privilege whatever you say in the secret chamber in the closet between you and God is between you and God and in that that bond between you and God cannot be broken they can come and say oh no no no we want to know what what did he say in the secret place don't talk to me talk to my lawyer talk to my high priest but at the same time if I refuse to talk to my high priest my high priest is bound he can't defend me what if I go in and and I I get a high priest and he comes in and he says Bruce I'm here to represent you well Bruce did you do it or not I don't need to talk to you who are you I didn't pay for you what do you want he can't do anything for you how do you want me to plead your case I don't care how you plead my case you see you bind his hands up you make it to where he can't do brother brandom said so remember he can never do anything for you until first you say that he has done it believe him and accept it and testify it do you know that he's the high priest of our what our confession Hebrews 31 says now he's sitting at the right hand of the father to make intercessions Upon Our confession if we have the wrong type of confession how can he intercede for us if if we're praying for healing and then we walk out the door and you say well I don't know I know brother John anointed me with oil and all the brothers came up and prayed for me and you say brother that's what the scripture says do and you go oh yeah but I still feel really bad your confession is hindering his intercession he cannot intercede for you if you carrying around some of your sins we already saw in the opening scripture that the high priest will make atonement for your sins but if you're carrying around your sins you're binding him to where he can intercede if you come every day and say Lord I'm sorry I know I stole when I was a young boy and tomorrow I come back and sayl I'm sorry I I stole as young boy and he says but I forgive you he's making an intercession because you can't make intercession you there's no way that you can pray enough to what can wash away my sin right my intellect my studying the Bible praying fast until I die Faith confidence amen amen he's the high priest of our what our confession to make intercessions Upon Our confession you see we've got to believe it then accept it and then confess it and he's before the father to make good anything that we confess in the Redemptive blessings amen so you have to remember the high priest he makes an atonement for the believer he makes an atonement for the sanctuary he makes atonement for the Tabernacle of the congregation he makes an atonement for the altar he makes an atonement for the priesthood he makes an atonment for all the congregation it's mainly what I'm worried about is me I mean I like your brother Dennis but I'm not really worried about you I'm worried about me I'm worried about I'm very selfish when it comes to Salvation for me amen because I don't really care about how salvation affects you it's my life that's on the line if I don't if I don't confess the right thing and he cast me away from his presence he's not casting you away from his presence he's casting me away amen amen so Jesus is the high priest of our confession sitting at the right hand of God to make intercession Upon Our confession I know what King James says profess and confess he says it's the same word but it's a confession and he cannot do anything for you until first you believe it and then accept it amen it's wonderful to get baptized it's wonderful to ask Jesus Christ to be your savior it's wonderful to say come into my heart and everything else but until he accepts you and comes into your heart it's all in vain you're stepping in the right direction you're moving in the right direction but there's no partial Credit in this class we don't we don't give half points for showing up for church there there's you know there nothing like that It's All or Nothing amen amen you must believe it accept it and confess that it's right and then he's the high priest to make intercessions on what you confess that he has done for you and that's just as plain as I know the gospel frankly that's all I know that's the only gospel that there is is that that's what he said he said that's it so let's just take a look at some of this let's go to Hebrews 7 amen praise the Lord in Hebrews 7 and verse 19 it says for the law made nothing perfect so I want you to remember that we're just we're going to talk a little bit about the high priest and the difference between the old levitical high priest and Jesus Jesus but we're not staying there because the thing that you need to remember tonight is that your walk with God is all based on your confession it's based on your confession if you hide your confession he can't move if you if you aren't willing to confess your sins he can't forgive you he just he can't if if you if you don't move in the right direction I mean the intercession when I I mean this was at the beginning I'm working out and I'm thinking about this I'm going I can't hear the rest of the tape because I'm thinking about I'm thinking about I am hindering God for interceding for me on my confession and I never really thought just about that Little Nugget verse 19 says for the law made nothing perfect but the bringing in of a better hope did so he Paul is telling them he says the law did absolutely nothing for us because it couldn't change us but it pointed that one day a perfect lamb would come and because we had that hope we could we had something forward to look forward to by he says and the bringing in of a better hope did and that is how or why how we draw nigh unto God and in as much as not without an oath he was made a priest so Paul starts to make this difference between a priest that was made by a bloodline election and a priest that was called into an office by an oath amen for those priests were made without an oath the priests in the Old Testament Aaron was chosen by God he was elected to be the high priest and then he was went through all of the the ritual and the ceremony and everything else and set up as the high priest and then when Aaron got old and died his son took over now when that son got old and died his son took over and then another son took over and another son took over and there was never any accounting about their relationship with God he says for those priests were made without an oath but this Jesus Christ with an oath by that by him which is God Elohim that said unto him the Lord swear and will not repent thou art a priest Forever After the order of MDC so the high priest in the Old Testament was a a Earthly priesthood that was based on flesh MDC now there's an interesting guy no father no mother No Beginning No End yet he existed and when God spoke to Jesus Christ he said thou art a priest not till you die but Forever After the order of MDC and by so much was Jesus made aurity of a better Testament Jesus Christ can do for you what brother John and brother Ron and me and brother Keith and if we all get together and pray for you we can't do for you what this high priest can do for you what this high priest can do don't make him mad don't lie to him I don't know why you try to lie to God anyways God knows amen and they truly were many priests in verse 23 so he says they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death but this man Jesus Christ because he continu forever has an unchangeable priesthood praise the Lord can you imagine every year so okay so we got brother the pastor so brother John's going to be our high priest but one day brother John Dies so he's got to take his son because that's the only one that could be the next Pastor is his son so his son comes in and we vote him in well we don't vote him in God already did because the levitical law said so what kind of a relationship what kind of an attitude does he have towards God because if he follows all the rules and the regulations and goes in and puts Blood On The Mercy Seat God's Duty bound to accept him but Jesus Christ praise the Lord who is an unchangeable high priest amen wherefore he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them Lord his whole life he's making intercession it doesn't say that about the levitical priesthood the levitical priesthood goes in one time puts Blood On The Mercy Seat comes out and says man I'm glad I lived through that because and you'll see you'll see Paul talks about he says for such a high priest became us the high priest stepped down from glory and became us and it's not that we Are Holy but he was holy he was harmless he was undefiled he was separate from Sinners cuz he was no he didn't even know sin he was separate from Sinners and he was made higher than the heavens that's my high priest amen who needeth not daily as those High priests those in the Old Testament to offer up sacrifice first for his own sins the priest got to atone for himself then he's got to atone for this the priesthood then he's got to atone for the Tabernacle then he's got to atone for all the goods he's got to do all of that continually year after year year after year he's going to come in and every once in a while they messed up cuz there were a couple of high priests who got killed there was also people who thought they could just hey I can just go in here and offer fire on the altar of God I have a i God knows me I'm the king amen first for his own sins and then for the peoples for this he did once when he offered up himself you see the difference Paul's talking about he says for Jesus Christ did this once when he offered up himself for the law maketh men High priests which have infir infirmity they you know and that means I'm sick right if you have an infirmity you're sick there's something wrong with you maybe you're missing an arm maybe you got a bad heart maybe you got therosis of the liver maybe your blood pressure is way too high but you could still be a high priest but Jesus Christ is perfect praise the Lord amen but the word of the oath see he said this oath that God made with him which was since the law maketh the son who is consecrated not for every year but forever praise God amen amen so turn back here to Hebrews 4 just one page back ver verse 14 it says seeing then then that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens Jesus the son of God let us hold fast our profession let us have a consistent confession yes you can't be in and out and up and down and left and right and everything else because every time you're in the down and the dumps you're hindering your intercessor your are hindering your lawyer from going to bat for you amen when you doubt him see that's why brother John just did a a good message on predestination but he also did a good message you know on the if if we well we we'll go into it later says for we have not a high priest which cannot be touched with the feeling of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin Let Us therefore come boldly into the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find Grace to help in time of need amen what good is it if you have a scripture but you never use it you never use it you need get a flat tire on the side of the road and you go get out of the car and you slam the door and then you open up the trunk and the spare is flat that's the time when the word of God should be in your mouth and say he is a present help in a time of trouble if I don't confess that he cannot intercede for me it cannot I want you to look at Romans 10 amen and then praise the Lord amen in Romans 10 um verse 8 it says but what saith it the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart so if you don't read your Bible every day like like when I was a young Christian once I still feel like I'm pretty a failure but I was a young Christian once and the brother that I used to fellowship with a lot he said well I said well I know I'm born again because I said I've see the works so like on my way to getting born again I went to watch uh brother brandom's movie Deep call to the Deep so we went to a church and Don and I showed up and we were Sinners we were living together Sinners and and but there was something in me stirring about the end time and I got there and at the end this this preacher that played the song and played the movie the movie and then he sung a song and everything else he says if you want to change in your life he says come up here and stand and we'll pray for you well I I went up front and I felt like brother Brandon told the story but when I went up front well I was Presbyterian Presbyterians don't go up front we don't we just sit and go to whatever you go you know so I I came up front I put my hands together and uh and I I don't know any prayers Our Father are heart in heaven I know that I used to know the Apostles Creed but I don't I don't never pray to this who I don't even know who God is but there's something tugging inside of me because this man this man he got up we showed the movie and he got up and he said you know he says the devil we're like a cow on the end of a rope and he says the devil's got the other end of the rope and he says he'll let us graze around here but he says we can see that there's better grass over there and he says and every time we go over there he says he pulls on a rope and he said one day Jesus Christ came down and cut the rope and set us free and you know what crazy old brother Bruce did I shouted [Laughter] amen I didn't even know what that was and I came up front and I I this the guy came we prayed for us prayed for all of us and no lightning bolts nothing happened nothing I said okay went back sat down we all got in the car we're driving home they asked me about the movie and I said well I really wasn't impressed with the movie because I didn't see any Miracles I thought I going to see some Miracles I thought I was going to see you know the dead Ray I thought I but I said I didn't see any of that and and I said but I said it was I I believe I I do and about halfway through the next day I realized I was no longer swearing and I never swear since he's a faithful high priest later on when I got born again that wasn't born again that was God vindicating to me that he is real if he's never Vindicated to you real you better find him you better find him because he's got to be real to you can't be real to Mom or Dad or the Deacon board or the Pastor they don't work like that it's got to be real to you to make it to it to it work and then so so then I just know that so so later on I I was telling to this brother and he said well brother Ru says you got to read your Bible and pray every day and I said how thick that book is and it's pretty boring and I'm not going to read read it I mean and he goes well he says so God is a spirit right he's a spirit and he's the author of this word so I said if you don't read the word and get it inside of you and when you need help the Holy Spirit has nothing to anoint because he can only anoint his word and when he anoints his word it does exactly what Romans 10 says the word is nigh thee even in thy mouth and in thy heart and if it's in your heart then it will come out of your mouth if evil is in your heart it will come out of your mouth if unclean thoughts are in your mind it will come out of your mouth and your confession will hinder the work of the Holy Ghost amen verse 9 says that if Thou shalt confess with the mouth the Lord Jesus and shalt believe in thy heart that God has raised him from the dead Thou shalt be saved amen the only evidence that I have that he rose from the dead is the works that he's done inside of me because anybody's works that's done inside of somebody else doesn't count I mean it's wonderful it's wonderful brother Ryan you prayed and God did something for you but I want it for me that's what I want amen for with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation praise the Lord amen now turn back a couple more pages to Romans 8 so verse 26 says this and brother John just just taught on these scriptures two weeks ago he says but look verse 26 says likewise the spirit also helpeth our infirmities that's our mistakes our failures I can't get over my temper I can't get over my lusting thoughts I can't get over this I can't get over I I got I got these things these problems but the spirit of God can help you with your infirmities for we know not what we should pray for and as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession the spirit is the high priest he maketh intercession he goes before the father see Jesus Christ is just the veil Jesus Christ is just the the image of the invisible God but there's an invisible God that worked through that man amen and that invisible God has to have something to work through and so the spirit itself maketh intercession for us and he that searches the hearts knoweth what the mind is of the spirit God remember remember what he said there in Hebrews 3 he said the guy that built the house has got more power than the house and Jesus Christ is the author of the house whose house ye are amen I'm God's house amen praise the Lord Brother Denis he is I'm his house and he knows what the mind of the spirit is because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and that answers a lot of problems because you pray and you say oh Lord pray I got to have this happen pray I need this I need this I need this but but when you confess if your confession is correct and he goes to the father because the the carcass the body that Jesus Christ is laying on the throne it's the bleeding lamb and the spirit is making intercession and the spirit so when Jesus's blood he can't see your mistakes brother brandom said that perfectly he says because he hears your voice but it's filtered through the body of Jesus Christ he says that's my son speaking to me his confession is right but you know what my will is my will is bigger than him and that's what the scripture says because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God not according to your will oh yeah we all want to live forever we do but we don't want to live forever old who wants to do that I mean I don't want to get older I want to live forever yes all right so let's uh so look down at verse 34 says so he says who is he that condemneth it is Christ that died yay rather that is risen again because none of us have right who is even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us and if we confess the right things then God can move and make intercession for us so that's why the Bible says cast down imagination well everybody has an imagination and you'd be walking along and just imagination turns on it just it just turns on but if you haven't hid the word of God in your heart then there's nothing in there for the spirit to anoint to cast that thing down because you thought oh that's just me no cast it down if it doesn't line up with the word of God cast it down and he can make intercession he say he he say oh Father my son down there is having a problem with his imagination he needs a little more power and then he can he can give that to you because that's what the high priest does amen amen so I want to spend the next 20 minutes or so speaking about Abraham now Abraham is known as the father of our faith amen and he was called by by God at 75 years old how many people here are older than 75 oh they're over there but that means the rest of us never even heard a voice of God yet think about that 75 was when God first spoke to Abraham before that he was nothing but uh Heathen did his own thing walked his own way did everything but his confession now notice also Abraham when Abraham was alive there was no high priest so when God called Abraham God became his high priest and everything that Abraham confessed God could intercede for him brother bramman Israel and the church he says so now I want you to notice that in the beginning of this is the beginning of Christianity of the church wow so I want you to notice it wasn't because Abraham was a good man it was because God elected and chose Abraham it wasn't Abraham choosing God it was God choosing Abraham can you see it so the very first question you have to ask yourself yourself if you are the children of of Abraham it's a hard question did you choose God or did God choose you because if God didn't choose you there's no hope God is he has to act you you know that he chose you amen amen thank you Lord it wasn't because Abraham was a good man it was because God elected and chose Abraham it wasn't Abraham choosing God it was God choosing Abraham can you see it and now watch now as it was then so is it today it isn't you choosing God it's God choosing you now this might be very strong but I want you to notice immediately after choice election it's separation from everything else as soon as he calls he elects then he calls and when he calls he separates you from everything that hangs on to you now that's God's program that proves it isn't a denomination it isn't two or three people together he he expects every individual amen it's an individual affair with every person amen so if you if we're not going to turn there but in Genesis 12 veres 1-3 God calls Abraham or calls Abram out of Earth the cheles he calls him and the very first thing now God called Abraham and Abraham confessed that he heard the voice of God and God moved on Abraham to help him leave his family because sometimes that's kind of hard to do but he took a lot with him anyways because he felt sorry for him he took a couple other people with him and he went on his way that's not the point the point is is that when he confessed that God had spoke to him God interceded for him and when he left the very first thing he did was he backslid famine came into land things got hard God never told him it was going to get hard never told him about that it got hard Abraham went down into Egypt lived down there told lies did all kinds of bad things but it never stopped the election of God when he came back then God he still had heard the voice of God he said I still believe God called me but God started to prosper him because he had that testimony that he believed God and God started to prosper him well then God made a contention between him and his buddy and he said you know what JN we we can't walk together anymore you got way too much money things aren't going well for us so because I'm a good Christian you pick whichever way you want to go and I'll go the other way and sometimes we think said this is horrible these have been friends I've had all through my whole life now all of a sudden I can't be their friend anymore cuz God wants you and him alone he don't want you and the pastor in between he doesn't want you and the Deacon board in between your wife in between he don't want anybody between you he wants you and him alone and he will bring things around oh you think he's going to destroy your marriage uh no I didn't say that he's not going to say that that ain't happening but God wants you to stay so he puts him under preparation Under Pressure he puts pressure on Abram the elect he puts pressure on him they get in a fight and they separate as soon as he separates and he follows the plan of God God comes down and reviews again the promise that he made to him when he first heard him he reviews the promise that I'm going to make you the father of many nations I'm going to bless you and everything else amen and he also tells him so we want to look at this one this is Genesis 13 because there's there's a nice little there is one in here brother brandom called it one in Genesis 13 starting with verse 14 it says and the Lord said unto Abram after that lot was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward Southward Eastward and Westward for all the land which thou seest to thee will I give it and to thy seed for ever and I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth so that if a man can number the dust of the earth then shalt thy seed also be numbered arise and walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it for I will give it unto thee then Abram re removed his tent and came and dwelt in the plain of mamry which is in heon and built there an altar unto the Lord you will notice that there is no mention here of the the stars of heaven right but verse 16 back up there thy seed is the dust of the earth brother random said you know this is kind of an interesting thing because he said the thing about the Dust of the earth is that it can be blown around by every wind of Doctrine don't build your things on the house on sifting Sands of the Sea of time but Abraham when he was first called was just like the sand of the sea he hadn't come to Perfection yet he had a lot of years that God had a chisel away with him God never mentioned it to him amen amen let's go over here to Genesis 15 we'll skip some things but so Abraham he went and and God spoke to him and because Abraham believed that prophecy and confessed it God went to work to make it come to pass amen now things got bad because got lot got hauled away and Abraham had to go go and fight for him and bring him back and he fought against the 12 Kings and then on his way back he met MDC who was the Visage he wasn't Jesus Christ when he was MDC because Jesus Christ wasn't born yet he was born of a virgin but he was sworn to be in the image after the order after the order of MDC yeah wish I had all the time in the world but I don't so he met MDC and then in verse in chapter 15 God reiterates again he reminds Abram of his promise again verse 15 say orif chapter 15 verse one says after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abram in a vision saying fear not Abram I am thy shield and thy exceedingly great reward well what was he before God wanted Abram to fight he wanted to see what Abraham would do and then God revealed to him later on he said Abram he said if you now you can confess I am God is my shield God is my great reward and I will intercede for that that battle wasn't place there just why wasn't that battle placed after chapter 15 because God had not revealed it yet but he also says so Abram Abram starts to argue with the Lord that's why it's important to go back and study Abram because you and I argue with God all the time and we hinder our walk because our confession is not correct and Abraham said to God he says okay I know but you know what I'm childless and the only person that's going to be my Heir is Eliezer of Damascus and he says and then God spoke back to him because God does not look at your failures and your frustrations because you are the elect of God he has a word that he is going to fulfill and it's not based on you it's based on your confession amen behold of the word of the Lord came to him again saying this shall not be thine error but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels should be thine air and he brought him forth abroad God brought Abraham out in maybe on the hillside and he said now take a look up he said do you see those stars do you know what the sons of God are stars we started out as Sin but we're going to be Stars if our confession will match amen God told Abraham he said first of all he says yeah Abraham you're a mess you're like the sand of the sea every Wind Blows you around you all everywhere but there's com in a day when you will shine like a star in the firmine amen amen amen it's written in there that way Amen in Abraham's Covenant confirmed brother brandom says so now we notice also in Genesis 155 when he confirmed the Covenant or spoke to him again about it he said go outside look up can you Number the Stars how that there's so many stars innumerable look from dust to Stars oh my from Earth to grave to Glory praise the Lord amen I didn't make it up amen amen so he says in the wings of a snow white dove he says so after these things the word of the Lord came unto Abraham and a vision so you see Abraham was a prophet so he saw Visions fear not Abraham I am thy Shield thy exceeding reward which is Jehovah Manasses see God has to reveal himself to us over under every seven Redemptive names I'm not going to name them all but God is going the reason why some of us we say oh Lord you're taking so long Lord I I really want to get out here I want to do all these things no what you need to be doing is saying Lord I want to manifest your word whatever part of my life I'm at right now I want to manifest God whatever he's got for me when I'm working then I want to manifest God if I was raising kids I want to manifest God if I get up in the morning I want to manifest God because God is very patient he's made a covenant amen amen D made him a promise you know see right then Abraham would have failed I like that he says but the promise is unconditional the Covenant is unconditional brother John read to us Romans 8 and he said be when did he write your name on the Lamb's Book of Life that's what it says in Revelation he wrote it from the foundation of the world if your name's on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world if you were in the thoughts of God before the foundation of the world how why are you even saying I'm not going to make it Jesus stands back and says well I guess there going to be another 6 months might be a year here till they finally get to where they finally say yes I'm going to make it I can do all things through Christ that strengthe me amen I can overcome I can cast down reasoning I can cast down my imagination I can control this situation I can do these things because the word of God tells me I can amen amen praise the Lord an unconditional PR Pro but you see he had to come forth out of his own bows and be an heir and he says so he's 100 years old now and he brought him forth abroad and said look up towards the heavens amen if you look at he Hebrews 11:13 it says they were persuaded of them convinced they embraced them the promises of God and then they confessed that's what that Hebrews 11:13 that's what it says said they persuaded of them they embraced them and then they confessed now in amongst all of that we think oh Abraham he's doing good he's doing great he's doing who does anybody care about the time he's doing great he's doing great you know what he does next he goes out and creates ishma what a failure God didn't see him as a failure ishmail is not a failure ishmail is the Seed of Abraham and because of that God has to intercede for ishmail oh yeah God God blessed ishma out of he became the father of many nations all the promises that God gave Abraham he had to give them ishma amen but it didn't stop God from keeping Abraham promise he revealed himself to him as Al shedi and then he changed his name because he was getting closer to that star he was getting farther away when God first found us we were really a mess but as we continue to walk with him and we continue to confess and positively believe the word of God we keep getting higher and higher and closer and closer to that star amen amen so when brother brandham said he said so he says God finally came down and he met Abraham face to face you know he had never met him face to face till he met him outside the tent and he said when he saw the three men coming and he started to speak to him I want to show you I want to show you what brother brandom says here he says Abraham I'm going to visit you according to my promise the promise that he made way back when he first called him who was it who was it no wonder Abraham called him Elohim I'm going to make my promise fulfilled and Sarah excuse me young ladies Sarah was back in the tent a lovely woman but she said me an old woman nearly hundred years old and my Lord her husband 1002 and have pleasure with him again you understand what I mean husband and wife it had ceased to be said have pleasure as a young woman again with my husband out there when that may have been 20 years passed on before a family relationship see me an old woman have pleasure with my husband and him an old man she said yeah now brother brandom said that when God called Abraham he was the elect and that was the beginning of the church and that angel Elohim In the Flesh looked to Abraham and said why did Sarah laugh saying within herself that these things could not be amen so he says so now let me just go a little piece further he said she's in the tent behind you now look god listen up God would have condemned the woman right there for disbelieving that angel do you believe that but he could not do it the same way some of you Pentecostals us Pentecostals are acting our confession is wrong our confession is wrong we say the wrong things we believe the wrong things we have bad attitudes to any body disagrees with this ought to get out of the church ought to do this all of that our confession is wrong and he cannot intercede for us if our confession is wrong we'd have been kicked out of the church a long time ago but God can't do it why if he'd had kicked out if he'd have kicked out Sarah she was a part of Abraham so she was an heir with him just like ishmail was the heir with Abraham and God he could not if he kicked out her he'd have to kick Abraham out too so he couldn't do it on account of his wife or on account of the husband and that is the way it's because Christ can't kick us out for having a bad confession because we are part of him amen amen he can't throw us away because we don't do the right things we are his sons and daughters our unbelief doesn't mean nothing praise the Lord praise the Lord amen it doesn't mean nothing the real true Seed of Abraham will shine anywhere anyhow there it was so listen close now and the angel said I'm going to visit you according that to the time of life and this thing will happen the Rapture is going to happen we don't know when don't really too worried about it I have this confidence that he's called me to it amen so then it's in his hands then what I got to do is confess the right thing not say oh Lord why is this going wrong oh why is this and that and the next thing and start believing the word amen am man that's the thing I I I wish you could I wish you could get the revelation of that that when you sing the songs of Zion we should be rejoicing I mean David danced and jumped before the Lord I don't even know what you guys would do if I'd run around here and dance and jump and praise the Lord you know I mean if I start yeah most of you go what what is he doing you see brother Brenham said there he is let us consider our high priest maybe you know like I say sometimes the prayers don't look like they're being answered but the scripture says that it's based on on the will of God not on what our prayers are all he you know like brother John told us last week he said he said pray here's the lord of the Harvest the lord of the Harvest has spiritualized he can see that the Harvest is white and he can send laborers he's got the power to do that he's got to send them but you know what he said he said you ask me to send and then I'll send so in the meantime I'm not sending cuz your confession is wrong true and when you start asking me to send I will that's what the Bible says you got to believe it in your heart then you got to confess it with your mouth and then he'll move you ask not you receive not right you ask because you pray and you pray to consume your own lust you're mad at that brother over there oh I wish he'd get cancer you know what I mean you pray for the wrong things you don't pray to get through a battle or through a Strife you see your confession is wrong and Jesus steps back and just says okay it'll just be another six months maybe another year cuz how many times have we heard we come to church all the time here he's waiting on us well then you you got to find out what what the problem is what's the root cause I used to do that root cause analysis well part of the root cause is that our confession is not right and Abraham proves it Abraham proved it amen I love how brother brandom says this he he talks about Abraham he says in Abraham and his seed after him yeah this is my last quote I don't May any apologies or anything because I want you to get that in your head your confession is what's hindering your walk that is what's doing it your prayers they're good the things you're doing but if you don't walk in faith and confess in faith you're not going to get anywhere and look now we're all waiting for a body change right that's what we want is a body change brother brandham said and Abraham and his seat after him he says so look what if he had just turned them back to a young man and a young woman again like they was at the first time what if he'd had turned Abraham and Sarah right back we all believe he turned him back right but he didn't turn him just back it didn't just turn him back because brother brandham said if he turned him back they' have still been childless he healed him he turned him back and turned him into the Stars turned them back into their glorified bodies because then she brought forth children he had lived with her since she was in teenage that's what the prophet said he says they couldn't had the baby anyhow because they'd lived together when they was young man and woman he had to change their body in a different way in order to receive to get the sun is that right their body had to be changed in another way to receive the Sun and we cannot if we go back to being young men and women we still cannot meet the Son of God I don't want to go back and be this body is corruption this body is hybrid this body the devil has a right to it i' go into the science and show you all of the but he is going to push all the corruption away the corruption will go away and this that is corruptible will take on incorruption when he changes me back and when he changes me back I can walk right through that wall I can think and be there if we would go back to being young men and women we still can't meet the sun because we're going to meet him in the air we got to have a changed body to meet him in the air the Rapture so that's the next thing for the children of Abraham the trumpet sound the next thing The Real Children of Abraham shall be changed this body will be made light and we'll go right up and if we go back to being young men and women we'd still be Earthbound we'd still just think about that brother John if he takes us back to 21 we still have our tempers I don't want that we'd still have our bad attitudes I don't want that we'd go back and we'd still we'd have no do you want to change then the word of God is in your heart confess it and the high priest will go to work for you praise the Lord amen let us consider Jesus Christ the Apostle and high priest of our profession our conf confession brother and sister come on it's not how long we have to stay here it's it has nothing to do with it it don't matter if it's another 10 years you're going to quit I'm not 10 more years I'll be here just older because I heard his voice he took I mean he changed me and if Abraham could continue to follow God and still make all those mistakes and God ever cast him away then there's hope for all of us praise the Lord amen amen let's Stand Together amen let's bow our heads dear Lord Jesus Heavenly Father Lord we read that prayer in the opening and the prophet said forgive us of our trespasses forgive us of our sins of omission forgive us of our having the wrong confession the wrong words are in our mouth the right words are in our heart but make the right words come out of our mouths give us Faith to give Grace to those that are less fortunate than us give us that love that will go out and it won't be with respective persons it won't be the corruption that we were born in Lord this is a simple message and I pray father Lord that you'll challenge us that you'll go home with us tonight you'll go home with us you'll get in our memories and in the morning wake up and go really am I really confessing the wrong thing that's what it means to take the message home with you am I really confessing in the wrong thing forgive me Lord forgive me Lord Jesus we're all undone without you without the sacrifice without that Supreme blood Lord without that to cleanse us we have no hope there's nothing we can bring there's nothing we can bring we can only say Lord I'm guilty and I I accept I accept the high priest I accept the Lamb of God that you provided for me I accept the sacrifice that you made for me he that was without sin became sin that I might become him I gave him my old tattered garment he gave me one that was brand new he took my old attitude he took my old ideas my old ways and he changed me into the image of the invisible God lord I pray father I can't make any of this come to pass but I pray that you will that each and everyone can come again rejoicing saying oh the word of God has changed my life amen Lord we love you we commit everything into your hands father for your safe keeping take us to those stars make us shine as son Sons and Daughters of God let us rejoice in what you've done for us we love you father in Jesus Christ's name we ask it amen
