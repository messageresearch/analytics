mission field there among all those that are out there work for christ and then we look them up for all those that are sick or failing one way or another our sister cheryl just wants to see her here

shine the wrong and do the rhyme no the lord will make a way for me amen we all are in that place of learning to shun the wrong and do the right and where we mess up we have the blood of christ to claim and but i believe he wants us to continue to strive to live a holy life i think the bible declares without holiness no man shall see the lord and it's just it's a striving it's not a comparing with one another it's a striving to become more like jesus well god bless you this evening sure good to see everyone in god's house and good to see sister linda back amen praise god we're grateful to see you amen and sister cheryl wanted me to make mention if you see her get cut out here a little bit from time to time the doctor has asked her to limit her exposure with her immune system she really doesn't go out anywhere and do anything i mean this is this is it and she's comes here to to be a blessing to us to help us if we had a full orchestra here you know it would be different but let's just pray that god continues to put a hedge of protection around her amen i wouldn't want to have her immune system you know we are we're fortunate to have a strong immune system brother roger and sister trisha wanted us to express their gratefulness for your continued prayers for them during this time and as you know this is not something that gets over in any time soon things get easier but then thoughts would come and it would become very hard and so i'll just say anytime that the lord would put them on your heart please continue to pray for them they appreciate your continued prayers and for the kindness that everybody is shown towards them in various ways it has touched their hearts and they wanted uh you to know how much it meant to them so god bless you for that and you know we're a small church but uh when you when you stay united you can be a great blessing one to another and we're just appreciate every one of you just loving the lord by loving god's children amen turn with me if you would to the book of galatians chapter 2 very familiar scripture we've read it many times i could say this that i believe ann told me this is her favorite scripture in the bible amen galatians chapter 2 verse number 20. amen let's read this scripture and then we'll go to the lord in prayer amen paul saying to the galatian church i am crucified with christ nevertheless i live yet it's not i but it's christ that lives in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i live by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me amen let's bow to the author father we've looked into your word we've read this scripture many times it means very much to us lord we're asking humbly that you would unveil just a little bit more of yourself to us today give us eyes to see ears to hear a heart that understands and lord that we could become more like you that's our prayer today to the ministry of the word may you you you meet needs in all of our lives lord you can take just one word from this precious book of yours and quicken it to all of our hearts and meet all of our needs lord in an hour when our faith is being tested and and fear in men's hearts is on a rise we need you the author and the finisher of our faith god increase faith in our hearts and help us to see you living in your word today bless this word to our hearts quicken it to us and we commit this now into your hands in jesus precious name we pray amen god bless you may be seated i just want to say how thankful i am to everybody that's live streaming amen may the lord jesus continue to meet with you in your homes and bless you with his presence and just reveal the word there to you now we want to entitle this message living a crucified life this is i'll say not a popular subject and not one that we feel um real comfortable with and we've kind of given it a negative connotation about suffering and i would like uh to go beyond that to go beyond that and i just need you to be patient with me this is uh such an important subject when we get into the depth of the meaning and when it's faithfully executed in her life it can yield benefits that can only be that can only come forth from living a crucified life so one aspect is i i'm suffering in this moment i'm crucifying myself in this moment and paul i believe was referring to a crucified life not just a certain situation or a certain period in his life but a life that he lived so i'd like to start out by making this statement to properly live for christ means to live a crucified life that's a strong statement but that's how important it is it may seem like an oxymoron to to live for christ and to be crucified to live and to die but it's a simultaneously because we have a carnal nature that that we're born with and that even though we become born again it's it wants to creep its head out we know paul was born again amen yet he had to continue to keep his flesh under subjection the entire church world would most likely defend that they live for christ regardless of whether they are crucifying their flesh at all but to properly properly live for christ means we need to live a crucified life brother brandon helped bring a little light to this statement when he said it took a hundred lots to make just one abraham a hundred lots to make one abraham so there's different degrees of living a crucified life abraham was completely sold out to god he did what god told him to do he obeyed not even knowing where he was going he learned not to lean to his own understanding he separated from everything and he walked with a burden for others now a lot on the other hand he was not completely sold out right he was a believer but he wasn't sold out he he leaned to his own understanding he chose the easier path right he chose the easier way to serve the lord he didn't separate from everything his burden was for himself it was he wanted to become a mayor i mean it was about him and building his kingdom right true so there are simply different degrees of living a crucified life and what we want to do is try to just get into this a little bit because you know when we when we hear scriptures like this or we talk about this you know there's that cringe and that's oh no not again you know we don't have to be afraid of dying out there's benefits there's such benefits jesus was well aware of the different degrees and how men would uh look view and understand that people are not going to know what it really means to die out for him nor to live for him even his own disciples remember peter he thought he would go so far that he would be willing to die and then we found out he was denied that he even had a relationship with jesus god understands that people do not see clearly what it means to live for god to die out for god mark chapter 10 verse 35. and james and john the sons of zebedee they came to jesus saying master we would that thou should has do for us whatsoever we shall desire isn't that the typical carnal christian and he said unto them what would ye that i should do for you and they said unto him grant unto us that we may sit one on my right hand and one on thy left hand in thy glory now was that fair to you brother mark was there no consideration for the other children but see this is how we can get sometimes in our desires for god are just about us now if they said you know we just we want to better serve you better please you better understand how to serve you well that's not selfish and that's not wrong look how jesus answered in verse 38 he said you know not what you're asking can you drink of the cup that that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism that i am baptized with can you completely crucify yourself and surrender yourself over to the will of god that's what he was asking because they're wanting to sit right next to jesus and then he asked if you want to sit next to me can you crucify your flesh like i can can you give up your will completely to the father because if you want the reward didn't jesus say to him that overcometh i'll grant to sit with me on my throne as i have overcame and sat with my father and his amen so this is the question he goes right back and he talks to them about the sacrifice a sacrificial life that they would live not how many great deeds he would do but a life of crucifixion that's what he's staring at and that's what he's wanting them to to to to view it's why he asked the question romans we're going to go back uh to this but i just want to read romans chapter six verses number three and number four because it's it's an important question that jesus asked he says and paul said here to the romans he says know ye not that so many of us as were baptized into jesus christ were baptized into his death therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we should walk in newness of life now what most people want to do is they want to become the perfect christian without any crucifixion it it just can't be done going back i just want to finish that up there in mark chapter 10 verse 39 and verse 40 and they said and they said unto him we can not knowing exactly and jesus said unto him ye shall indeed drink of the cup that i drink of and be baptized with the baptism where shall he be baptized but to sit on my right hand and on my left hand is not for me to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared notice it's not handed out like you know i know i'm sorry i know to the best of my ability of knowing i will not be sitting on the right hand and on the left or the left hand i'm pretty sure that is prepared for those who have given who've partook of self-crucifixion the most who have given their life over to do the will of the father the most i think that's who it's prepared for because that's the question that jesus asked in luke chapter 9 jesus shows how people are willing to follow him but they don't realize the cost behind it the cost that's involved with following the lord properly because there's a proper way to follow the lord and not a proper way to follow the lord properly is you are right there following his steps as he's taking them one step at a time the improper way is to follow jesus from afar like peter did still following his heart's not there he doesn't have faith in what he's doing he's full of fear there's our way that we want to follow the lord and then there's his way that he wants us to follow the lord it's true amen the cause to follow the lord our way is much cheaper than the cost of following the lord his way the cost of following the lord his way is a crucified life luke chapter 9 verse 57 if we could go through these scriptures luke chapter 9 verse 57 and it came to pass that as they went in the way a certain man said unto him lord i will follow thee whether so ever thou goest so there's this i'm gonna do it and look how jesus responds he didn't say oh that's great i'm looking for followers he says i want you to understand that the foxes have holes and the birds of the air have nests but the son of man have not where to lay his head in other words it's not going to be easy the birds got it easier the foxes they got a place just i don't have that it's not going to be easy it's going to be a straight and narrow path you're going to be forced to do things that you don't want to do and i'll say it like this there are some people that catch a glimpse that it's going to be a harder way but you know what they want to do other things first he talks about that right here in the next four verses and then he said to another follow me and he said lord suffer me first to go and bury my father no i don't know what this was really referring to because i didn't was he wanting to stay home for a while until his dad had passed away and then he would go follow i don't know i don't know what he meant but one thing is sure he wanted to put something else first jesus said unto him let the dead bury the dead but go thou and preach the kingdom of god in other words that's what's important amen and another said also lord i will follow thee but let me first go bid them farewell which are at home at my house and jesus said unto him no man haven't put his hand to the plow looking back is fit for the kingdom of god think about how god is viewing your intentions in following him he doesn't want second place now this is just not a denomination or belief or a non-denominational belief or a message belief this is a jesus belief like a god belief this is what the bible says now to come to grips with this you can't really do it in your flesh the majority of the people who start out to follow jesus do not continue that's just the facts they don't endure to the end they don't hold that confidence they had at the beginning jesus said in matthew 24 13 but he that shall endure to the end the same shall be saved now notice when a a a a lot of ministers are given the invitation to come and give your heart to jesus none of them say if you come now make sure you understand you're not going to get saved until you endure to the end but it's part of the gospel it's part of the gospel god is looking for commitment you know that's right i don't know how to say it it's just it's just it's just it's commitment and we all want that we even want that in our friendships with one another if i make a mistake and i i say something wrong or i get upset at you i i i don't want you to just leave me we got to be willing to to go through hebrews chapter 3 verse 14. the writers say in the book of hebrews we are made partakers of christ if we hold the beginning confidence steadfast unto the end of our walk we can't just you know i'm a partaker as soon as i got baptized as soon as i repented as soon as i that's good for that part but every day that goes by is another day of salvation because today is the day of salvation i mean yes we've started the walk yes this is where it started we can say that but the next day is a new day where you make choices about your will to do god's will or to do your own hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 and we're just again laying one of these lengthy foundations hebrews chapter 10 verse 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which have great recompense of reward for you have need of patience and that after you've done the will of god you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry now the just shall live by faith is that not what our opening scripture said paul lived by the faith of the son of god now the judge shall live by faith but if any man draw back in other words he begins to not live by faith that's really good maybe a carnal understanding maybe a feeling maybe uh well just see what happens right my soul shall have no pleasure in him but we are none of them that draw back unto perdition but of them that believe to the saving of the soul which is in the end i'm really not you know it would be wrong for me to just say i know that i'm saved no matter what i'm saved and then just go out live in the world but every time you talk to me i'm going to tell you i'm safe i think we should just settle on every day we need to live for jesus just settle on it and and let the end be the end let it let it be our testimony the end of course we're going to have pitfalls along the but i i i tell you just get back up you get back up yeah he never said he that never falls to the end is going to be saved that's not what he said just to get back up we're not perfect but we learn to get back up and and be faithful at serving the lord even i believe the lord is pleased with that now most of us have heard the prophet say that we were with him at calvary we were with him when he rose out of the tomb remember when he spoke like that yeah we could not only identify with him at that point but we were also with him at calvary we were apart inside of him is that true therefore we when he was crucified we were crucified with him at calvary in message spiritual amnesia brother branham said i most surely with him at calvary i must be identified with him at calvary i must be there to a place that where not also was i identified with him at calvary i died with him at calvary and every christian must die with him at calvary if you don't die with him at calvary you can't be none of his i was there when he died i died with him i was and then i was with him when he raised up from the dead and i come up on easter morning with him in the resurrection whatever he did i was right there with him every believer was the same now brother branham is referring to i being identified with christ in the past and most believers can identify with that but paul in our opening scripture was not identifying a past tense he was identifying being crucified with christ in a present tense i just want to read another one more quote brother branham said in the message the cruelty of sin and the penalty that it caused to rid sin from our lives brother man says oh why don't you crawl up calvary yonder tonight hallelujah let your own life be hacked out and die yonder on the cross with him throw your arms around the rock of angels cleft for me let me hide myself in thee while the near old waters roll while the tempest still is high hide me oh my savior hide me let the world do whatever they want to do let the theologians do what they want to do i don't want their theology i want what i want is jesus christ in my heart let me die with the lamb oh i know how hard it was that night he's referring to when he gave his heart to the lord when i walked into that little old colored mission church out there and all the white folks who are standing out there said there he goes into a colored mission wow brother brandon says it was hard i walked up there with my with a whole lot of kentucky pride in me yeah like that but god said if you want it walk right on in there and i walked right in there and knelt down at the altar and there i stayed until the lamb i died to my old self bill branham 20 years old hallelujah it was about a dying out to receive christ amen and he says these words i was crucified with christ i was crucified with christ amen but paul speaking here in a present tense galatians chapter 2 verse 20 he said i am crucified with christ i am crucified with christ but he wanted to make it clear that he that he was alive so there was a crucifixion going on and there was a life going on happening all at the same time in his life in his body and he's trying to explain it uh yet it's not i but it's christ that liveth in me and the life which i now live in the flesh i lived by the faith of the son of god who loved me and gave himself for me it was almost like he was expressing another life was taking over another life was taking over inside of him amen so it's not a natural physical crucifixion right you couldn't be physically crucified and be alive at the same time paul said in second timothy chapter four verse number six for i am now ready to be offered in the time of my departures at hand so paul at this place was offering his body so because you know once you once you die that's it you you die once the bible says and then the judgment so paul's not referring to the physical death paul is referring to living a crucified life where christ was able to live inside of him now our thinking that the devil wants to tell us is that christ can live in you regardless of whether you live a crucified life or not and all i'm going to say to that statement because i don't want to debate it but all i'm going to tell you is there's different degrees there's different degrees and god is calling the bride to a total sell-off christ can only be presently manifested in our lives to the amount that we are presently crucified we do not ever get to the place that we do not need to ever be crucified anymore that would mean that your selfish nature would have been permanently annihilated and if you just want to know the truth all you got to do is get up the next morning paul never thought nor preached that christ could live in him outside of his flesh being crucified first paul said that he died on a daily basis most people want to believe that regardless of living a crucified life they that christ is still living inside of them okay so if i get really mad and upset and i hit somebody and i knock him down my question to you is is christ living in me come on am i am i born again is christ living in me do you see how hard and confusing the question is that christ wouldn't do that but yet i'll defend that christ is living in me no matter what i will never say no christ wasn't in me but we do see this one thing that if i do do that you see a need that i my flesh needs to be crucified that we do see clearly and that's really the the message is so we can understand that we need to live a crucified life to stay in the state of a crucified mindset we're going to get to the good stuff this is the hard stuff as believers oftentimes we can fight a negative connotation about dying daily about denying our flesh mortifying the deeds of the body crucifying our wealth or picking up our cross just a negativity that goes with that that i don't want to hear that no more whereas sermons that refer to walking in the spirit praying in the spirit being led more of the spirit god using us in the spirit has a more positive acceptance but in reality they work hand in hand one opens the door to the other we don't want to bypass one and try just to the other because then it becomes a carnal a carnality of serving god a carnality of god's in me if christ is going to be seen in you it's it's because you're dead to the flesh i see two mainstreams of thinking when it comes to living a crucified life one is negative and the other is positive i want to talk about the negative one first when you're fighting the crucified of yourself while walking in the will of your flesh it is a negativity you you don't want to do it because you're in your flesh your flesh wants to have its way it's not encouraging it's not exciting and quite frankly i don't want to be reminded about it anymore thank you in other words there isn't anything positive about the subject so get off of it and that's good and i like just want to say that this is a a negative way of viewing living a crucified life but i want to talk about a positive way it's where you're focused on how much more you'll be able to do for the lord amen how much more you'll be able to please the lord that you're not able to do when you're in the flesh it is the answer to walking closer to jesus it will make jesus smile towards you when your flesh has been crucified it will bring more of a spiritual purpose to your life it will open the door for spiritual fulfillment it opens a door to joy to peace and being able to love amen love everyone the way that he loves to think of others without respect to persons or without judgment and this can't happen if you haven't crucified the flesh so i want to look at this tonight in a positive manner the benefits that you get from doing it the negative view is always about what you have to give up which is your will but a positive view is about what you can gain it's about what you're gaining by doing it the focus is on what you get out of it not what you got to give up and when you exercise the love part of your relationship with god giving up your flesh becomes easier if it's just a law i got to do this i got to do that but you don't see the purpose of god behind it you don't see the fulfillment of god's joy behind that right i have no greater joy than to hear my children walk in truth god gets happy when we do things and and sad when we don't do the right things it's part of our relationship and we're it's we're just growing saints we're growing there on mount olive in the garden named gethsemane jesus agonized and he battled in prayer he had spent years in his ministry sharing that he would be crucified and it didn't seem to be much of a problem to him just to those that he spoke right no this ain't going to happen we're not going to let it happen but when the time had come when he was in that garden he battled a great warfare in his mind he searched for ways in his mind to bypass this cup of crucifixion now i'm sure the devil was right there bringing more confusion to his mind the bible said that jesus fell on his face and prayed saying oh father if it be possible let this cup pass from me it wasn't just a cup of suffering friends it was a cup of self-crucifixion let this cup of self-crucifixion pass from me now when we're asked to go the second mile to give up your time for somebody else to reach a soul to spend more time to to to to pray for somebody to to turn your cheek to not get mad at somebody when they did you wrong your flesh is always wanting that cup to pass from you it's the human nature that we have if we let it have its way then christ cannot be manifested we don't gain anything but in our carnality satan would teach us well you just prove to them that they're wrong and that they shouldn't have done that and that's all you need to do because it's the truth is that what jesus did when they pulled his beard and mocked him and no he did he opened out his mouth but the glory of god was being manifested there are benefits to letting your life be crucified it's not don't let it be scary right there in the garden in the midst of the greatest battle ever being fought there was a joy that was set before him it was the salvation of man's souls and that joy is what gave him strength and power to lay down his will that's the same thing that we got to do every day as soon as you're coming into a rough trial it's right there are you going to lay down your life are you going to crucify your flesh are you going to let them have it it was the love for the father's will in jesus heart that allowed him to say nevertheless not my will but thy will be done it was the love for the father's will that's what we need to live a crucified life that is our victory when we can love the father's will to gain the father's will in our life then you can live that crucified life without feeling any kind of hurt or pain or scare or fear it's a love relationship it was love and joy that brought the power of calvary it will be no different for you and i it will be our love for the father's will that will give us power to lay down our life to self-crucify and to be willing to live a crucified life when i think that god refused to use my vessel when i would rather have my fleshly will and i just want you to think about this god does not cross our freemore agency this has such great respect for that but when i think about that god refuses to use me when my the will of my flesh is to do what i want rather than what he wants when i realize that i'm restraining god from using me when i can see clearly that is that is only going to use me if i surrender myself to him it's in that moment of realization it does something to my heart it makes me realize that i love him more and that love for him makes me want to die out to what i want to do and gain his will in my life now friends i'll say this we go through this dozens of times a day you know we might be thinking of some you know big things but if you just you know if the prophet said we backslide 100 times a day i want you to think how many opportunities that god wants to use us but our will is in the way so we've got to get excited about letting god using our life and as we get excited about god using our life then we're willing to lay down ours and living that self-crucified life is is is nothing to be scared of look god took us on when he did and look how many times he failed did god say no way i don't want to do it no he's still interested i believe that he's proud of the church that overcomes in laodicea the hardest age of all ages could go right back could just get just like they are in need of nothing i'm just going to do my own thing but we are blessed because god's given us eyes to see and we're overcoming the greatest enemy which is herself you know it's hard to die out to yourself the greater your pride is the greater you want to do your will right the greater you want to be first but first lord let me the greater that is the harder it is but the more you look what i can gain i can gain pleasing the lord i can gain doing his will he may want you just to chop wood that's really good amen but it don't matter well lord i want to go i want to go preach the 5 000. chop wood for that little woman that's the will of the lord you gain his will i don't i'm sorry it just naturally don't happen i don't naturally do the will of god it just doesn't come to me my flesh is just against god's will as it was before i ever met the lord that's why it has to be crucified that's why we got to learn to not enjoy heaven its way right when we want the lord to have his way in our life think about not what you're giving up but what you can gain outside of living a crucified life we have limited ourself from gaining all of god's will right but living a crucified life is living dead to your will it's living dead to your will it's living not my will thy will be done to live a crucified life it means you're living not my will thy will be done it's not automatic philippians chapter 2 verse 5. now we've got to start hurrying let this mind be in you which was also in christ jesus not my will but thine be done who being in the form of god thought of not robbery to be equal with god but he made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in the likeness of banff he was so humble and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross now notice this starts out let this mind be in you which was in christ jesus now that mind humbles itself continually until it becomes completely completely sold out to god and it is certainly easier for any man to preach the gospel than it is to live the gospel romans chapter 8 verse 7. i'm going to talk about the other mind that we deal with because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh they cannot please god so now if i take my fist and i hit this person we know that i was in the flesh and that i did not please god but if i don't hit this man outwardly but inwardly nobody knows about it except me now you take that line and you just keep running it right back to what you're doing with your time they that are in the flesh they cannot please god being in the flesh is not just doing the most horrible things that you can think of and comparing yourself with those that do the most horrible things we've got to think about the mind of christ what did he do with his time right amen and was he looking to gain the will of the father or was he just looking to get by with as easy as he could so the carnal mind has wrote down a few things between the carnal mind versus the mind of christ the carnal mind is proud it wants to be served it's self-willed it it loves walking in the flesh it's it's living without crucifixion now the mind of christ as we just read in the scriptures is humble it serves it obeys god's will it walks in the spirit and it's living a crucified life right to the end right to the end it doesn't stop it doesn't say i've done this i've gone this far i've done this deed it keeps going galatians chapter 5 verse 6 this i say them walk in the spirit and ye shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh surrendering our will to god is the greatest privilege a believer can experience it's what happens when you first got saved and the wonderful thing about it is you can you can experience that same experience as you surrender your will what did jesus say the father doth loved me because i lay down my life the father loves us when we live it a crucified life because now he says there is a vessel that i could work he did not the prophet say if i could just if god could just find one man one man get him in his hands he could turn the world upside down and that's what a crucified life does turn with me if you would to second corinthians chapter four second corinthians chapter four verse number seven we read the scripture and maybe even been last service and you know a lot of times when the lord this was not even in my thoughts of what we were this whole sermon was not even my thoughts or what we were going to preach it didn't transpire for a couple days but what i notice when you start looking at these sermons in sync in in order you can see a continuity in them and you don't even to me i don't even know what's happening as it's happening as it's unfolding but when you look back you can see it much easier but i think we read the scripture second corinthians chapter 4 verse 7 but we have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of god not of us we're troubled on every side yet we're not distressed we're perplexed but not in despair what a testimony to have persecuted but we're not forsaken cast down but not destroyed always bearing about in the body the dying of the lord jesus for a purpose look at the purpose look what we gain that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our body but the devil tricks us and he gets us to think that we can still manifest christ in your life without dying out and that is not scriptural that's another gospel i know the more that i'm dead the more jesus is going to be seen and the more i'm worried about my reputation the less people are going to see jesus they may see a better john martin but who cares who cares 16 elements how much are we worth less than a buck it's that soul the character of that soul that's what's important all right verse 11 for we which live are always delivered unto death paul said i am crucified with christ now that was i'm living that life why that the life also of jesus might be made manifest in our mortal flesh now look at what we gain we gain christ in our life it goes beyond knowledge about what we beyond what we know it goes to a life lived for others brother brandon said eternal life is living for others it's manifesting christ to a world so verse 12 so then death it works in us but life in you and if i don't die i'm sorry you're not going to get life out of me we may get you know a friendship you may get my knowledge changing at life because i'm still in the way look at what we gain don't look about what we got to give up i am crucified with christ ending with this nevertheless i live yet not i but christ he's living in me and the life which i'm now living in the flesh i live by god by god not believing in jesus but by jesus in me believing there's a difference who loved me and he gave himself for me so why wouldn't we want to crucify ourselves and give ourselves back to god that his will could be accomplished it is no different than what jesus had to go through in the garden that great battle there of giving up your will that god's will could be done amen god bless you let's stand together praise the lord we did that under 60 minutes praise the lord amen let's just go to him in prayer how many desires in your heart to find that place where dying out is not so scary that you counted a privilege amen praise the lord amen let's look to him in prayer heavenly father we want to thank you today for showing us the positive part drinking that cup that we we gain more of your will in our life a greater degree of your will being accomplished in your life lord we ask that you remember every hand that was lifted expressing to you expressing to you lord desire all my thoughts go to where paul said all that i might know him he wanted to know you in the fellowship of sufferings that you might be resurrected in his life he didn't stop with just saying that he lived a very good life as a christian at the end of his journey he still wanted to offer his body what a love a mortal man can have for his creator lord we thank you that you first loved us that we could love you back lord may we never be scared or afraid anymore of this subject may we never feel like we're being hurt or but may we realize that it's a chance for you to live in our life be proud about i'm being crucified with christ proud that you would i i don't mean proud in a bad way lord thou knowest but just honor that you would use our vessel to shine your glory through keep us positive lord about your will being done in our life bless each heart you see the desire the yearning that each one has for a greater degree grant to them their hearts desire bless them lord and as they they would sojourn in the days that would lay before and they have that opportunity lord to bear in their body the dying of you lord may you give them joy and strength to lay down their life that you could be resurrected inside them to meet whatever need it would have whatever problem difficulty or barrier that they would be facing lord what we're wanting is you to be seen you to be manifested oh we love you and we thank you for these things lord in the precious name of jesus christ we pray amen amen i remember the story that when peter heard they were going to crucify him that he escaped and when he was walking out of the city the lord jesus appeared to him and he asked he looked so surprised and he asked jesus what are you doing here and jesus responded i've come to be crucified again every situation and at that i'll just let me finish that story at that moment peter turned right back around and he went back to be crucified and he said i am not worthy he was so full of god he said i'm not worthy to be crucified straight up turn me upside down what he would gain is the will of god that's what we're gaining by laying down our life is the will of god yes and that let that joy let that be the strength to move forward with the lord amen amen let's sing i am one of them i'm one of them it's a peppier song amen there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all aflame with the fire that fell at pentecost with cleansed and made them clean it is burning now within my heart all glory to his name i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them one of them one of them oh i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of them [Music] i'm so glad that i can say i'm one of

bride lord jesus we're one of them that are filled with your spirit lord god that are walking in the spirit of god and we're so glad we're so glad lord jesus amen praise the lord i want to sing deeper deeper and as we say it this time i want us to think about when we are facing a situation where we we know we have to die out to our will i want you to think i'm going deeper in the love of christ i'm not going deeper in suffering and hurting and but i'm going deeper in love amen praise the lord deeper deeper in the love of jesus daily let me go higher higher in the school of wisdom [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen hallelujah still my life is holy lost in jesus and his [Applause] every day oh [Music] amen praise the lord blessed lord in thy precious holy word deeper higher every day in jesus our conflict finds me a conqueror and it is [Applause] perfected [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey men i'll tell you i signed that song and i thought that was like made for this service it's like a deeper revelation of going deeper in the love of god well i want to say how blessed we are to have a wife in multiple ways but we i just i i fell in love with the worship service before the word today and uh being able to just express your love to god through worship i just it it's great it's great and uh we just appreciate what the music does to help us enter into that spirit because he inhabits the praises of his people and we just want to keep if if for some reason we don't have a muse musicians here we just want to double up behind brother ron and just worship with more of our heart and sing it louder and clap twice as loud and just put put put everything into it because it makes the difference it makes a difference amen yes it's something i hope it said to me she's been expressing over and over again the appreciation of me which is able to be here and she said one thing that's spoke to her so much was our worship amen we worship the lord she said she had never heard like that before and she's the strong presence of god comes over her every time she comes in praise god so i just wanted to share the testimony of that yes he inhabits the praises of his people and if we can believe we'll i believe we'll experience it we'll feel it we'll well no more it's not just one day um you know the sacrifice of just giving of yourself whether you have to go clean or you just go do something that you know denying that flesh that the woman is not wanting to go you know you're tired you don't feel good or whatever just ignoring that and going forth in the lord to do what he wants you to do brains about change in people's lives amen i just see it over and over again the more i say nobody yes to someone else the lord just becomes so evident and it's a domino effect because now hope is telling your brother who is wanting to come to service before you know it it's just going to keep on going yeah you know that's the way it's supposed to amen praise the lord thank you for sharing that yeah just second for the run it's like dominoes it's like when you said the first time these we see the holy ghost and they and they go out and they would nerve to attend to god and they bring their family into the soul and that and then god when he does that's right amen amen that's right what we gain what we can gain by dying out and when you know us as a congregation are out here that when you know and amen it's perfect perfect amen well praise the lord lord be with you till we meet again and we'll be dismissed in the word of prayer goodness our brother larry if you would to close in prayer god bless you brother thank you lord amen we thank you for giving us yes
