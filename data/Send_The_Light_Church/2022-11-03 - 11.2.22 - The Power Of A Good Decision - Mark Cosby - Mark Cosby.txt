wonderful most precious way in Jesus Christ let me pray amen if we could turn to the book of Hebrews and we'll read uh in chapter 11. a little bit of lengthy opening for opening scripture but just bear with me amen who's thankful being the house of God tonight amen so Hebrews 11 and we'll start off with verse 17 probably very very familiar scriptures they've been read many times by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac and he that received the promises offered up his only begotten son a full moon was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence he also he received him in a figure verse 22 or verse 23 by faith Moses when he was born was hit three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction notice he had to make a choice there choosing red to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season is stimula approaches of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured seeing as him who was invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the bloodless Destroyer the firstborn should touch him by faith they pass through the Red Sea as by dry land which Egyptians are saying to do were drowned verse 30. by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believe not when she had received the spies with peace verse 32 and what shall I say more the time would fail me to tell of Gideon of Barack and of Samson of jephthah of David also Samuel and of the prophets who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stop the mouth of lions quenched the violence of fire escape the edge of sword out of weakness were made strong wax valid and fight turn to fight the armies of the aliens women received their dead race to life and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they obtained a better Resurrection verse 36 and others had a trial of cruel mockings and scourgings gave moreover of bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sauna Sunder they were tempted were slain with sword they wandered about the Sheep's sheepskins goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us should not be perfect amen you may be seated so the top the tower the the title of this uh sermon so it's part two of our series The Power of a good decision so I read this interesting fact uh let's just dive into the scriptures so just noticed Moses he had a choice when he was of age he had a choice whether to choose Egypt and the riches and my angel Egypt had many riches wealth Untold they were the most high-powered Nation at that time and Moses even had an opportunity to be next in line to Pharaoh so imagine all those things the devil was tempting him with had any woman he want but rather he made the choice to suffer Affliction with the people of God because he knew that the choice of sin only lasts for a certain amount of time it may feel good you may get millions of dollars have all these accolades Nobel Peace Prize whatever it is but those things will pass away but he knew Christ would never pass away he knew that opportunity would never ever pass away of him taking that so just a look a fun fact I looked up in fact some sources suggest that the average person makes an eye-popping 35 000 choices per day so assuming that most people spend around seven hours per day sleeping this blissfully Choice free makes roughly 2 000 decisions per hour or one decision every two seconds I never thought of that I was just like just imagine all the decisions that we make I was just like and so I wanted to read a quote get really tied along with the scripture because uh you guys probably remember his brother Branham uh when he was in the service and they spoke in French and he thought somebody spoken in tongues and somebody interpret it from the U.N but I just thought it was a perfect lined up with it because thou has chosen the narrow way the harder way that was walked in your own choosing now I can see that Moses had to make this choice too see thou has picked the precise and correct way correct decision and it is my way underline my way the Holy Spirit speaking back because of this mountainous decision a huge portion of Heaven awaits you awaits thee what a glorious decision now listen close what a glorious decision now has made this in itself is that which will make and come to pass a tremendous victory in love divine so brother Branham had to make a decision it's like Moses had to make a decision and just as Moses and brother better make a decision we have to make that same decision because the straight and narrow way is the harder way the the Broadway the wide way is easy I mean it's it's easy to your flesh because your flesh gravitates towards stimulation and whatever stimulates the flesh the flesh wants to gravitate towards that whatever it is you can fill in the blank whatever it could be pleasures of this world and so we have to make that same decision every day which path are you going to walk and the power of a good choice this isn't well I guess I'm trying to hit home is it's a spiritual choice because you can make a good choice in a grocery store oh that's five dollars off comparison to three dollars off but that doesn't really matter necessarily or you can make this choice in a car or this Choice well I want this car over this car yes I believe God can be in those things but we want to go focus on the spiritual decision of a good choice because each decision you make a good decision spiritually is going to lead you one step closer to being more in the image of God and that's what that's what God is looking for is for us to be more In His Image but we have to make a good choice that's what God has placed in our hands see God isn't just expecting us to sit in our Lazy Boy and relax but we play a part in making a good decision everything is laid before us God has given us a blueprint of what to do examples in the Bible see there's examples in the Bible for us to follow and not to follow like Samson he chose to he gave his heart to Delilah but not to God but he gave his strength so we have to give our heart to God every single day that's the power of a good choice you give your heart every day to God is a choice that we have to make every day because Satan wants to trick you he wants to use you use your emotions because emotions can be good feelings can be good but they I guarantee they're not always going to line up with God's word because once again these were used to contact our Earthly home these senses so amen so let's go to Romans Chapter 4 Verse 18 to 25. amen this is very familiar scripture as well the father of our faith so Romans 4. amen we'll start with verse 18 I said all right actually let's go to verse 17 actually as it is written I have made thee a father of many nations before him we believed even God who quickened the dead called those things which be is not they were let's go to verse 16 as well therefore it is a faith that it might be by grace to the end of the promise be sure to all the seed he's talking to us not to that only which is of the law but that's also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all Verse 18 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to the that which was spoken so shall as seed be and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah as well must stop right there and we'll keep going we just want to point out now Abraham had had never saw this thing come to pass he've only heard God speak to him so Abraham had a choice either to take God at his word or to stay where he was but Abraham made that hard choice now choosing a good decision you're choosing the harder way spiritually speaking and every day we need to choose the harder way because a harder way is what's going to cause growth in your life so Abraham made a good decision he made the decision that was pleasing to God all God ask of us is to be obedient to his word you may not have seen see God is calling us to things that we've never been so we have we have to trust God on the process it's like he's calling me if I if the Lord tells I get married he's calling me to be a father he's calling me to uh to give more of myself to him see these things I've never seen or experienced but if I trust God he's going to take me through these things but I have a part to play in making that decision every day so each good decision I make is going to lead to a closer walk with God Let's Go reverse uh 19. and being that weak in faith he considered his own body now dead Abraham had to deny all senses or reasons because they did not go with the word of God as he was getting older I imagine Satan was saying think you're really going to have this baby you're an old man you're walking on crutches and Canes you think you're really going to have this baby but Abraham had to cast that aside and say God said this God said I'm having this baby I don't care what the doctors say I don't care what Satan says I don't care uh what lot says his wife says I'm claiming this babe because God has promised he's led me this far he's going to lead me to the finish line and that's how we have to be as well believe that God if he called you then he's going to finish a good work in you you're still here for a reason God still wants to use you because where his hands his feet he's you use his vessel he's in his spirit so he can use our bodies if God can get his hands upon one man or a woman fully surrendered just imagine the things he can do in your community your homes uh everything he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God verse 21 and being fully persuaded so you must be fully persuaded that God can move in your life but you have to recognize and see Lord what are you trying to do in my life right now what things do I need to let go what things do I need to add to my life this that open honesty that's what God is looking for that's what touches the heart of God we truly want to be pleasing to him and it's the motive don't be pleased because the Pastor said so but you be pleasing because you wouldn't be pleasing to God that's what's going to touch the heart of God I can't write the coattails off for brother John's uh walk and neither can we amen verse 22 and therefore is imputed to him for righteousness now it was not written for his sake alone that was imputed to him but for us also you got to place your name in there but for also for Brother Bruce for sister Donna brother James brother Roger sister Trisha so you got to put yourself in the word because God is speaking to you you got to recognize and realize he wants to speak to us personally man but for also to whom it shall be imputed if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our lord from the dead who is the who was delivered for our offenses and was raised again for our justifications I just want to read this familiar scripture verse Romans 3 uh Romans 8 28 it's not in the notes but and we know that all things work together for the good to them that love God and people stop right there but notice this to them who are the called according to his purpose so God wants all things to work together for your good yet praise God but are you recognizing that you're called to a certain purpose a Heavenly purpose that it's not about you anymore but it's about others around you it's about helping reconcile others around you it's about making sure that your soul is prospering because if your soul is not prospering how can you help somebody else I'm pretty sure we all flown before when it says get your mask on first before you help others because that's your life support so we need to make sure that Christ is at the center of our life before we try to stop helping people because if you're not connected with the Life Source then you can't get anybody life you can only give them death because Mark Cosby can't do anything but if God is leading and directing and God in my life and using my lips then I can give life to somebody then I can reconcile somebody amen so Abraham when it seemed like so Abraham he he he had all he could have all excuses in the world right he could he's never seen these things but he didn't use excuses and who are we to use excuses we have all this example of people we know personally we got people in the scripture all these examples that we have so we need to Cast Away all doubt all unbelief and just put nothing this is around atmosphere of faith I don't know when God is going to do it but I know he's going to do it in his appointed time that's we need to have faith in those things and it takes us to make takes a decision to have faith it's something you can't even please God without faith the scripture tells us so Abraham what if he would have stoned with his Stone he would stop for reasoning when he told him he's going to have a baby by Sarah and she was 65 and him 75. and when he was a hundred and she was and she was 90. he still he confessed that God's word was true see it has to be a confession has to be in here first so you can truly outwardly confess it something has to go on in here first it has to be quickened you have to believe it he confessed that God's word was true and he called those things which were not as though they were see even Hope Was there any hope he didn't even use hope well you say I hope I can get all right I hope I'll be well I hope I get the Holy Ghost I hope I'm a Christian I hope I do this you don't want that Abraham never looked at that amen against hope he still believed God's word faith is beyond hope faith comes from back here in the inside faith comes from here how does he get how does it get in through this mind the door the battle from standing there now when you get the battle set in a ray now the devil is sitting right to every heart this morning he's sitting in this little girl's heart he's sitting at your hearts he's sitting all around there he's saying oh I've seen you tries before I heard this before cast them out that's all cast him out when the Bible says hear our text casting him out that's right casting him out we've been trained so that's the thing that we have to do if you want to you gotta make that decision to cast him out no matter what the doctors say no matter what my symptoms are no matter what pain I'm in whatever you're seeking tonight if it's healing if it's the Holy Ghost if it's Deliverance if it's restoration if it's your family brought back together claim that God can do it no problem God doesn't see problems with small problems and big problems he just sees a problem that he can solve because there's not one problem that you can give me that God cannot solve but you have to have faith and trust in God and Play Your Part make sure you're in the right position that God wants you to be in so he can use you to help restore something that's how it has to be done that's that's the way God economies operated he cannot move in your life if you don't have trust and faith in him it's one thing saying you believe in God but God knows if you're true even Satan knows even Satan knows that if you're bluffing or not he does you can't fool Satan amen amen right down it reason right on down you say sin says oh I can feel it yeah there it is uh-huh oh I might smell it or so forth these things are they are yeah next thing you reason well it looks like he ought to know what he's talking about the doctor says I can't get well that ought to be yeah you right right there you're wrong that's the devil standing there the devil poking these things into you don't you believe that Hallelujah God's word I said above all things I would that you would prosper in health God wants you to prosper in health his scripture declares it that's right how can you be a real Soldier out there see I want you to prosper in health so you have to believe we have to believe for everything that we're we're needing of we believe that God supplies it if he even even a sparrow doesn't drop a bird doesn't drop without him knowing he even feeds The Sparrows the scripture says he's given us a cure to anxiety he said but seek ye first the kingdom of God and his righteousness and all these things will be added unto he knows you have back pain he knows you can't lift your arms he knows that you you want your children back serving God he knows these things but let God work in your life don't have doubt because God doesn't work through doubt he's waiting for you to have faith not for you hold on to doubt and say oh Lord I believe yo I think you can do this but say Lord I know you can do this your word declares that your word doesn't say you can't do this your word says you can and I'm holding to the word of God I'm not holding to what Johnny Johnny Appleseed said over here or Dr Suzanne over here I'm holding to What God Says amen then if Satan can get through there get these by the conscience and all these other things he gets right down there to the end of the soul and the mind so that's why it's a mind battle see your mind is gonna dictate whether you're going to receive the word or not because it says the right mental attitude it starts with that first if you can't believe the right mental attitude attitude is everything to God if you have a bad attitude then how can God ever move in your life he can't even speak to you because you're so focused on having a bad attitude amen then if Satan can get through there get these by these conscience and all these other things then he gets right down there to the end of the soul and the mind now if he can just get you you'll never you'll never look at one of them until you first have to let him in there wow you have to let him in then when he gets in he gets control see Satan can't just bombard in your mind you first have to let him in you have to give him access to to your mind so now same thing like with God see like our brother in the last couple men's meetings talks about God demands worship and Satan wants worship that that's the battle's right there the worship and if we're succumbing letting the devil plant seeds in our mind and we're manifesting those seeds then we're worshiping the devil because we're feeding upon him but if we're kicking things out and trying the spirit like the scripture tells us in John I think it's first John 4 1 it says try the spirit and see that be of me so we have to try these things that are going into our mind because we can't just have vanilla kind of thoughts that's going on our mind we have to try to make sure it is of god because Satan likes to come as he is of God but we can't be fooled we have to and it comes to practice like we're like in Hebrews 4 it was saying you got to exercise you got to practice if you want to be able to lift heavy things you got to practice lifting heavy things it takes steps there's gradual steps up you can't just go try to lift the you know 225 pounds just like right now you got to build up to it just like with faith you gotta let your faith be built up built up built up built up until we get that that Supreme faith and it's by little things that we do every day like brother Aaron says the little things that we do every day that gets us to that Pinnacle of faith and your faith keeps growing it doesn't just stop you get to a certain level and it caps out at 99 no it keeps going amen you have to let him in there then he gets in he's got control then what does he do he begins to use the conscience he begins to use this begin to use the outlet what is it see taste fill smell here imaginations conscience memories reasons affections he begins to use all those different little channels as long as he could get in above this one here he's got to come into your mind first and you have to accept it listen to it and can batter against it but it can't get until you accept it so we have to make that choice every day are we going to let Satan just take over our minds and just let anyone kind of thought in there are we going to say What God Says cast on all imaginations all reasonings every High thought and put every thought into the subject of Christ are we going to do that that's the choice we have every day if we make that choice guess what that's a good choice that's going to lead us closer and more intimate with Jesus when Satan walked up to Eve he and said you know the fruit is Pleasant she stopped for a moment oh that's what she made a mistake when she stopped for a moment don't stop for nothing you've got the message Jesus Lives God Is A Healer that's the message don't stop fighting for nothing no reasoning is nothing else that's from the greatest battle ever fought in 1962. so we're in a battle on a daily basis the the victory we're going to get the victory the battle is the Lord's but you have to play your part if you want that if you want victory in your life you have to play the part he's called us to be Overcomers in his age one of the hardest ages to live in but with anything is is possible with God it doesn't matter how hard the age is or this or that you you have if you look in the back of the book we win so what do we have to fear why are we holding to fear Satan is gives you fear God doesn't give the spirit of fear he can't it's impossible let's go to James 4. and read verses 5 through 10. so verse 5. do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in us lusts us to Envy just really hitting home in the battle that we got constantly on a daily basis just because she became a Christian the battle is actually even it's raging now that's when the battle really starts and as you grow closer with the Lord and the years go on then the battle it gets even more it gets even more hard because Satan wants to get you to think well you've been serving the lord for x amount of years or you prayed good yesterday or you had a good church service on Sunday Hallelujah you take a little break but it's no time to take breaks the hour is getting too late for us to take breaks we have to be full force Pell to the metal we got to be pressing into God if you want things changing in your life see change I'm talking a different subject now but change there's two things you you can change people in the world change people in the world get new jobs uh take on new new responsibilities all these things but what kind of change is God looking for he's looking for change in your life that's going to make fruit that's what he's looking for as a tree is changing you plant a tree in the ground water it and take care of it it begins to grow and what are you looking for the results for it to bear fruit and what does God look in our lives for us to bear fruit that's the type of change we need to have because a tree that's planted by the water is roots are grounded no strong wind can move it it loosens it so the roots can grow deeper and we have to grow deeper in our walk with god let's go deeper in the word of God that's what God is calling us to is change every decision you make is going to change you to the good way or to the bad way and we want we all want change we may want to lose weight eat healthier all those things are good praise God but I'm looking for Spiritual change in my life because that's what's going to matter that does not matter how many times I Juiced how many times I ate a Big Mac or whatever it is that's not going to matter at the end of the day what's going to matter was my soul prospering was I making the right decisions towards God was I keeping my mind staying upon God and was my life truly changing the way the scripture declares it too because the scripture is declaring us to all things be new all us to be born again and our Nature has to change if we never get a nature change if we never become born again then we miss what God is calling us to because Jesus said he must be born again he didn't say you may have to be born again but he said he must because you can't even see the things of God unless your Nature's changed and your nature our Nature's still changing he's still trying to restore us back to what we once were before the fall God wants to work in your life he wants to change you but he's not going to force himself upon you you have to make that decision every single day it's a hard decision yes but it's a decision you must make if you want growth in your life the right kind of growth amen but he giveth more grace wherefore he saith God resisteth the proud but give a Grace unto the humble so humility is something that we have to do it's something we have to Humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and we had to kill Pride because pride comes from what comes from Satan it's a perverted form of humility that's all it is Satan just perverted humility and made it to Pride because pride is overconfident Pride likes to build itself up Pride likes to act like humility but in reality all it is is prideful that's all it is is pride humility and pride are Polar Opposites night and day so submit yourselves therefore to God so we play a part we have to submit ourselves to God then resist the devil and he will flee from that that's that's the program right there submit yourself to God because you yourself your strengths you cannot fight the devil yourself you will fail it's a spiritual battle we're carnal beings we're we're born in carnality and we have to recognize that God is our strength Jesus said all power is given to me in heaven and in Earth so if Jesus has that power then to me I see that Satan is powerless against God he is he can't do anything against God unless God permits him to do something in our lives trials afflictions pains that's something that he can do anything but those things are going to work together for your good because he promised it to yeah yeah draw an eye to God and He will draw an eye to you so knows that choice that's a good choice if you're drawing nigh to God he's going to draw an eye into you but look at this we read this or I think Sunday cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts be double-minded see we can't be double-minded we may say oh I believe I'm gonna get healed oh I believe I'm gonna get delivered I'm gonna believe I'm gonna get the Holy Ghost but you're constantly saying well I might get it then God can't do anything he's looking for you to be anchored be stand anchored in his word stand upon that rock be firmly anchored in him so he can move in your life God is obligated to fulfill his word if you fulfilled your part he's obligated he he he can't his word his word can't return void verse uh verse 9 be afflicted and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to mourning and your joy to heaviness humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord knows it says humble yourselves doesn't say Lord's going to Humble yourselves but says humble yourselves in the sight of the lord lord can't do things to Humble you to you know get you off your high horse he can but it says humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up let him lift you up don't lift yourself up Let Him lift you up Hebrews 12. verses for Shepherds Hebrews 12 what's up with verse 1. praise God Amen wherefore seeing we also are compassed about with such a great cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight in the Sin which doth so easily beset us and let us run with what patience the race that is set before us looking unto the Jesus the Jesus looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith so you make a choice to look to Jesus or not in your trials in your depression in your Sorrows you can look to Jesus or you can look to the problem I'd rather look to the problem solver than to the problem because I know the problem solver can get me out of the problem that I'm in but you have to look to him you have to have faith that he's going to move in that situation who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross he endured all these things so we can become Victorious through him through his blood through his strength that's why we're Victorious not how good I can uh tie my shoes how good I can drive a forklift how good I can type on a computer now that stuff doesn't matter what matters is that why he endured for you that you can be an overcomer that you could he became you so you could become him that's what he died for he died so you can be that state before the fall of Adam and Eve that's what he's trying to get us back to is that that Eden moment it was perfect it was calm it was peaceful nobody had to die no killings and we're slowly we're getting back to that and it's coming sooner than we think he says that come into hours that you think not so that's why he said to watch and pray the script says in Peter to be sober and to be vigilant because we have an adversary who he's cunning he's crafty he's smart he's wise and he like brother Ferguson said he looks and see your weaknesses your faults he wants to accuse you he's studying you all the demons they've been studying the human race for I don't know how many years but they've been studying they know the things that that uh entice you that stimulates your flesh they give you entertainment and we have to get to know our enemy because Paul said we're not ignorant of Satan's devices so we have to study our enemy and see how we fell before in the past we had we got to look at these things and analyze these things so we don't fall on the same trap that we did see God when we make a mistake and he convicts us we have to recognize what we did to lead to that so we don't go into the same mistake again we're going to make mistakes we are but make those mistakes turn into growth but we don't want to keep making the same mistake over and over I want to keep walking on Wilderness 40 years and 40 years I want to go around that mountain once I want God to be able to go into the next phase to the next growth growth I want this keeping growth growth growth because we can have a testimony every day of the Lord moving in our life it's how bad do you want it how bad do you want to a a testimony and say the Lord's been changed in my life he's been dealing with me this subject I got a chance to witness to this individual this these things that can happen in our life but we have to want it you have to have a strong desire and a want for God to do those things in your life let's go to verse three for consider him that endured such contradiction of Sinners against himself lest ye be weary and faint in your minds you have not ye have not yet resisted unto blood striving against sin and you have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto a children my son despise that thou the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou are rebuked of him for whom the Lord loveth he chasteneth so when he's chastening us he loves us he knows there's potential inside of us he's trying to refine that he he he he sees those things but says if you endured chastening God deals with you as with sons for what son is him whom the father chasten not but if he be without chastisement wherefore all our partakers then you are bastards and not of sons and not Sons furthermore we have fathers of our flesh which corrected us when we get spankings when we get yelled at they did it for they did it because they wanted you to learn from that situation yes they may have done it in the right way every single time they're human it's okay but their heart was to help you but now our father who's a perfect father if we believe he's perfect then we we should just say Lord you know what you're doing I'm gonna just listen to you I'm gonna be obedient to you right now right then I'm not going to question you because you know the path my life needs to go in you know the things that I don't need in my life you know these things furthermore we have had fathers of our flesh which corrected us we gave them reverence so not much more we'd rather be in subjection unto the father of spirits and live for they verily for a few days chasing us after their own Pleasures but he for our Prophet that we might be partakers notice the reason but for our Prophet is going to profit us to listen to God it's going to cause growth in your life it's going to profit it's gonna bless you fruit's gonna bear because you're being obedient to him that we might be partakers of his wholeness I just love that of his Holiness I can't be holy without him it's his Holiness that makes me holy now no chastening for present seemed to be joyous it doesn't it's not to your flesh your flesh is going to hate it every single time but Grievous nevertheless afterward it what it yielded the Peaceable fruit of righteousness that's the type of fruit we need unto them which are exercised thereby oh look at that word exercise again wherefore lift up hands which hang down in the feeble knees and make straight the paths for your feet lest that which is lame be turned out the way but let it rather be healed follow peace with all men and Holiness which without which no man seeth the Lord looking diligently let any man fail of grace of God let any root of bitterness spring me up trouble you thereby may be defiled let's go to Daniel 3. I want to just look at a couple characters who made a good choice in situations where their back was against the wall before we turn that I want to read this a couple things I've written down notice it says despise not the chastening of the Lord notice you have to make that choice whether you despise it or it is accepted see that is a good decision we said before it causes growth a good decision spiritual decision will cause growth in your life a decision to be obedient in God will cause growth in your life it will be harder like we said before it may even cause your FL cause your flesh to rile up but Jesus tell us the what to crucify the flesh daily a decision to crucify your flesh daily is a good decision also to pray and to press and we don't feel like it is a good decision it's easy to pray when everything is going all right when your time is just open you everything's open you have anything planned uh no problems going on at work nothing but when those things come in are you pressing in because that's the that's what's going to show if you have the goods that you say you have because anybody can pray when everything's all good but can you get on your knees when your body's just beat down when uh Satan's has been attacking every inch your family your church members everything your your but that's the time to really get together and pray we see we see all everybody sister Kathleen's sick brother Marty um brother Johnson uh you see the devil's just been attacking with that prophecy said if we come together and pray for one another that's we need to come together that much closer and pray that much more for one another that's what builds unity in a church coming praying because the devil he'll attack but he can't he can't stop if you're fully surrendered a guy you're prayed up in the spirit he can't stop that in fact he doesn't want you to get there he wants you just to pray fleshly because he knows if you get to the in the spirit prayer then he is powerless he can't do anything let's go to Daniel 3. and we'll start with verse verse 6. so during this time um this is they are the children of Israel Exile and Nebuchadnezzar was uh the king and he made this decree that uh who who wouldn't fall down and worship this this Idol this this these Idols then they'll be cast into the fiery furnace now they had it now the three Hebrew children Shadrach Meshach and Bendigo they had a choice they could have bowed down to the image in fear of begin throwing a fire firmness or they could just trust in a living God because he's a living God and whoso followeth not down in worship it shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace verse 7. therefore at the time when all the people had heard the sound of the Cornet flute harp sackbut Upholstery and all kinds of music all the people the Nations and languages fell down and worshiped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up verse 8. wherefore at the time certain Chaldeans came near and accused the Jews they spake and said to the King Nebuchadnezzar O King live forever thou O King has made a decree that every man that shall hear the sound of the Coronet flute harp sack but Upholstery and dulcimer and all kinds of music shall fall down and worship the golden image and whoso fought not down in worship that he should be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace there are certain Jews who now have set over the Affairs of providence of Babylon Shadrach meshech and Abednego these men O King have not regarded thee they may serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image without set up so now uh sometimes at work I feel like I'm living in a modern modern day Babylon the music they play the language they speak but that gives me no excuse to act like them in fact they they still didn't have a church like this they didn't have brothers and sisters to call on the phone and they didn't have Bibles like we got like this to read every day like we are and to pray in their knees and quiet and calmness of their home they were constantly surrounded by paganism Hedonism 24 7 hours a day 24 24 hours a day and but they still made the choice they still made a good choice so where I work at I have a decision to make a good choice am I just gonna just sit like a little Christian in a box or I'm Gonna Let Jesus manifest in my life am I scared to let him manifest because he promised he's a light he called me to be a light because he's a light inside of me so I need to let my light shine no matter what the sick circumstances are situations that work I need to let Jesus Shine through me so others can see that I'm not just some regular nominal Christian but I'm a born a green Christian filled with the Holy Ghost that's what they need to see because all these people want to slap the name of Christian talk any old kind of Life cuss like a sailor and still say oh I believe in Christ oh I'm born again how are you born again if you're born again your nature is changed God doesn't gravitate towards those things he cares about your languages the things you think the way you dress he cares about all those things he isn't a God to say well you can serve me and just keep these things over here and still you know say any okay you can go to the bar and get drunk and all these things no he's been calling us he's calling us to a full nature change a full nature change not a partial but a fool he's not coming back for halfway Believers he's coming back for believers that are fully surrendered and ready to do whatever he says if he says pick up and drop something you pick up and drop it and go where we at now verse 13. the Nebuchadnezzar and his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach meshech and Bendigo their boss was mad they brought these men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true oh sheriff they could have said well no King it's not they're lying but no they told the truth brother Bram said tell the truth no matter the outcome no matter what I don't care if you did something wrong tell the truth don't cover up because it's going to come to light eventually David tried to cover his mistake up and it came to light if he just would have just came out and said Lord I did wrong instead of covering up his I believe his punishment punishment a lot less but no uh the the prophet gave him this uh this parable of this and David's like oh he should kill him like no it's talking about you David he's like but he did repent at that time but let us when we make a mistake make it right make it right with God and make right with that person just do it right then and there because the longer we prolong it the more our prayer life's going to suffer those around us are going to suffer like I said before last sermon I preached every decision you make is going to directly affect those around you your family your church members and we have to think about it think about the things that you're trying to don't hide things don't do it just don't do it don't do it amen Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true o Shadrach Meshach and Abednego do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image will have set up now if you be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute harp I wanna I don't know where the sackbutt is but it's something Upholstery and dulcimer and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if you worship not if you shall cast if you if you shall cast the same hour into the midst of the burning fiery furnace and who so that God shall deliver you out of my hands and who is that God that should live without my hands now he gave him a choice you can worship right now and your life be saved or you can get thrown in the furnace and your life be ended but they didn't count they didn't care he was like we're serving God no matter what as we read and not give it away let's keep this keep going Shamrock Meshach and Abednego answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter I love that if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us from the burning fire in furnace and he will deliver us out of thy hand O King but if not be it known unto thee O King that we will not serve thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou has said reminds me the Christians that the the Roman Church killed over 68 million I believe 65 million plus they had that same choice they could have said literally lions they were all these things they were executed but they chose to hold God was so real in their life that they didn't care what happened to their bodies because they could say what Paul said death whereas I sting grave where's our Victory they were totally sold out amen amen they knew that the god they served whether he delivered them or not he's still God and they knew that if they killed me I'm not dead I'm going on to my body over another side so they didn't care either way they were going to serve God they're not bow to any image no Roman paganism they didn't want to bow to any of those things because they knew those things like Moses said Moses thought he knew the season a pleasure of season this is for a season it's going to go away but living for we're living for God that's eternal life I'm not willing to give up eternal life to have some pleasure to have some money in my pocket I'd rather be flat out broke and have God than to be flat out rich and think I have God because it says in uh Revelations 3 they're rich and they need of nothing they have all these things but yet they have the very thing they're missing the very key ingredient to a prosperous life that's a rich life to me having God in your life not having 20 cars a mansion house pools uh girls and this thing doesn't matter those things are going to pass away but if I have God doesn't matter what state I'm in as long as I have God and he has all part of my life every fiber and being in my life it doesn't matter then so where are we at let's go verse 17 or verse 18. but if it not be unto thee O King that we will not serve thy God it's going to worship the golden image which I was set up then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fear that boss was really mad that day and fourth his uh of his Vestige was changed his countenance was changed so a Vestige means his face was changed was changed against Shadrach Meshach and Abednego therefore he spake the Commandment uh he he commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was to be heated and he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Sherry Meshach and Abednego and to cast him out and said burning fiery furnace then these men were about these men were Bound in their coats and their hoses and their hats and their other garments and were cast into the midst of burning fiery furnace therefore because the King's Command was urgent and the ferns exceeding hot the flame of fires flew those men that took up sharick Meshach Abednego because money that scripture don't don't touch my holy anointed ones so it kind of reminds me of and these three men Shadrach Meshach and Abednego fell down bound to the midst of the burning of fire reference Nebuchadnezzar is knew knew there could be burned to Ash they're going to be nothing left but to his surprise then Nebuchadnezzar the King was astonished and Rose up in haste and spake and said unto his counselors did not we cast three men bow into the midst of the fire they answered and said the king true O King he answered and said lo I see four men loose walking in the midst of the fire and they have no hurt in the form of the fourth is like the Son of God praise God then Nebuchadnezzar came near to the mouth of the burning fiery furnace and spake and said Sheikh Abednego ye Servants of the most high God come forth and come hither then Shadrach meshech and the Bendigo came forth of the midst of the fire and the princes and governors and captains and the Kings counselors but Gathering Together saw these men upon whose bodies the fire had no power now check this out nor was a hair of their heads singled singed neither will their coach changed nor the smell of fire passed on them that is all the act of God because any anybody knows if we're on a campfire a bonfire you're going to smell just like fire you can try your hards you can clone up everything you're going to smell like fire so the hand of God God himself came down and protected them they know why because they were obedient to God they were even willing to sacrifice their lives to God that's what God is looking for us to be as obedient to death no matter if if the gun's pointing your head be obedient it doesn't matter the situation be obedient then Nebuchadnezzar speaker verse 29 therefore I make a decree that every people nation and language which speak anything amiss against the god of Shadrach Meshach and Abednego shall be cut into pieces and their houses shall be made at dung Hill because there is no other God that can deliver after the source that's the kind of God we serve there's no AAA meeting there's no counseling that can take the place of Jesus Christ being the mighty counselor in your life people people can go to meetings and get helped but that that that is still in there is that linger to still do it is still in there and so any day something's going to strike that and go right back to what they're doing that's why true only delivers to come from God if you want deliverance from your life that Deliverance is going to last go to God he'll give it to you I can testify that personally in my life pretty sure we all can then the king promoted Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the Providence of Babylon so it looked like if you want a promotion a true promotion from God be obedient if you want to if you want your work you'll be promoted just trust God he can open the door that no man can close this is our brother said in the men's meeting no matter if you have a bad interview a bad what if God wants you to have that job you're going to have that job if God wants you to have that car that house that church building as we prayed for you're going to have that church building no matter how much they put the price up God's going to supply that Financial need it may come from a smile write a check for you or they may lower the price but God is going to supply that need what you have need of he's not going to feed your greeds but your needs that's what he's going to do he knows we have needs we need food on the table we need clothes to wear we need a car to drive we need heat in the winter he knows these things let him be the provider he is but you first be obedient God will honor your faithfulness to him every single time if you're faithful to God he'll be faithful to you and he would be faithful sometimes we're not faithful that's how the kind of God we serve a gracious and merciful god he's long-suffering are we doing on time not too bad um we finished let's go to see we're at oh that's your Battleground I wonder your quote your Battleground is back here at the beginning back here in the soul back in your mind that opens the mind is the gate to the soul the gate to the spirit rather so the gate to the spirit your mind opens up and accepts the spirit or rejects the spirit you have a little conscience and little feelings and Sensations all these things has nothing to do with it they're just little Sensations things but when it comes to reality your mind opens it up your mind either accepts it or rejects it that's it friends so Shadrach and Meshach and Abednego they had that same decision yes and they accepted God's word they accepted that word into him and they just whatever situation they would end up they still trusted God let none of them miss it see it's your mind that opens the door or closes the door listen to your conscience listen to your memory listen to your affections but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of that stuff I'll read it one more time maybe you didn't hear it okay I hear amen but when your mind closes itself to these things and let God the spirit of his word come in it blows the rest of the stuff out every doubt is gone every fear is gone every sensation of Doubt is gone every feeling is gone there's nothing standing in there but what the word of God and take this sentence out and Satan cannot battle against it one more time there is nothing standing in there but the word of God and Satan cannot battle against that he is powerless he is weak he's defeated creature he can do nothing in the presence of God he has to bow down he may not want to bow down but he has to bow down no matter what demon is on you or whatever it is whatever situation is on you that situation has to leave in the presence of God it's the kind of God we serve the demons couldn't even he permitted it and speak one word when he casts him in the into the uh the pigs and they were like oh you're coming to torment this already because they knew who they were standing in front of see the devil knows if you're connected or not to God he knows that he's not going to tremble if it's just you but if God inside of you he'll tremble that that's what he's going to tremble right no sir he cannot battle against it now we know that's true amen let's go to Daniel 6. we'll close here the next five minutes almost done 6 10. so now Daniel we see three chapters later it was a decree that you couldn't pray or anything like that but he still made the choice to pray he didn't care what they said in Babylon he was going to pray to his God even Jesus told us give give diseases with Caesar and God saw a God God deserves your praise no matter what Caesar saying if Caesar's going against the word of God then I'm following God every every time every single time 10 times out of ten yes but it's a balance because if Caesar asks you to pay taxes pay taxes no no because they're going to get you eventually IRS are going to get you they if they owe you money they're going to take their sweet time but if you owe them money just speaking the truth so we always get God was God don't if you have convictions because a lot of times Christians we used to have all these convictions we used to have these strong convictions and we let them down that's when the goats come in all these things we used not to do we're starting to slowly implement it see the devil is truly trying to implement it slowly slowly trying to get in technology internet you got TVs on your phone all these things we got all these distractions we got not a bad thing to have technology not not at all but don't let technology rule your life that's what I'm trying to say so let's go to verse 10. now when Daniel knew that the writing was signed he went to his house he even I love that he even knew and he's I'm still going to pray and his windows he even opened the windows being open in his chamber toward Jerusalem he kneeled upon his knees three times a day I think sometimes we can barely do it twice a day or once a day sometimes and he prayed with all the pressure he had against him everybody was against him in Babylon all these things he had a written bill from Congress that he couldn't even pray but he still made that choice to pray he prayed hardest one of his hardest to pray when everything was against him and we had to make that same decision same decision they're going to close these doors one day so every make sure you're in your post duty every time you can be every time because God wants to meet with you he actually he appointed this very time to meet with you the very God of heaven took time on his schedule to meet with you individually that's how much he loves you that's how much he wants to see you grow in his likeness in His image three times a day and he and he prayed and gave thanks before God as he did a fourth time then these men assembled from Daniel praying and making supplication before his God then they came near and spake before the Kings concerning the king's decree hast thou not signed a decree that every man that shall ask Petition of any God or man within 30 days of thee O King shall be cast Into the Dead of lions the king answer said the thing is true according to the law of the medes and Persians which alterth not then yesterday and said before the king that Daniel which is the children of the cafeteria of Judah regardeth not thee O King nor the decree that I was signed but make his petition three times a day and the King when he heard these words was so displeased with himself and set his heart on Daniel to deliver him and he labored till the going down of the son to deliver him then these men assembled unto the king and said unto the king now O King that the law of medes and Persians is that no decree nor statue which is the king established may be changed verse 16. then the king commanded and they brought Daniel and Castle into Lion's Den now the king spake and said unto Daniel thy God whom now service continued he will deliver thee he even had faith in his God Daniel had faith in his God he knew yeah I'm gonna get thrown in Lions then but God has a final say so God has a final say so to the decision you're in right now whatever it is he has the final say so don't let the Devils think he has the final say so but God has the final say so in your life he's the absolute and the stone was brought and laid upon the mouth of the dead and the King sealed with his own Signet with the sickness of his Lords and the purpose might be changed concerning Daniel then the king went to his Palace and passed the night fasting neither were instruments of Music brought before him and his sleep went before him while he's praying for him fasting then the king arose very early in the morning and went and haste into the den of lions and when he came to the den he cried with a little voice unto Daniel and the King spake and said to Daniel oh Daniel servant of the Living God is thy God who thou service continually able to deliver thee from the Lions then said Daniel unto the king O King live forever my God has sent his Angel and has shut the mouth of of lions they that hurt me for as much as before my identity was found in me and also before the O King have I done no hurt then was a king a seedly glad for him and commanded that they should take Daniel up out of the den So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no manner of hurt was found upon him because he believed in his God he had faith and the King commanded they brought those men's which was accused Daniel they cast them into the denim of lions then their children their wives and the Lions had the Mastery of them and broke their bones into pieces that came in the bottom look at the decisions they made and it caused their family to the parish there's that decision that they made and then we're gonna we're gonna close it right here we're going to reverse and close it now just looking at that just seeing that Daniel he prayed three times and if we look later in the chapter God said I heard your prayer every time it just it took time the angel was fighting here to take time so don't think that God isn't hearing your prayer he's going to answer in your due time you may want healing he knows it he's waiting for that perfect appointed time he's waiting for the right moment God is always on time always he's never late so have your faith and say Lord I don't know where it's going to happen but I know it's going to happen and I'm gonna be I'm I'm already accepting that Lord you ever healed me to speak into existence already speaking to existence all right it's got Isaiah 26 3. it's going to close at this last verse this is the key right here with anything you're asking for A Closer Walk anything so 26 3. says thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusted them one more time thou will keep him in perfect peace we all want perfect peace amen whose mind is stayed on me no matter the circumstances no matter the situation going on at home at work in life keep your mind stayed on him because because if you keep in mind if you can do that you're trusting in Him that's like keep your mind if you're trusting in Him but if you're not trusting in Him how can you keep your mind on him a double-minded man is unstable in all his ways so he said final final thought there's that scripture right there the power of a good decision right there stay into our feets our feets our feet amen thank you Jesus maybe
