desire the right desire amen let's look to the lord in in prayer at this time our gracious heavenly father we're truly unworthy lord to be holding this child in our hands for lord life comes from you and to think that we're holding the life that you created we're unworthy lord to be holding life that you created today god we know that the enemy would love nothing but to destroy life for when you walked the earth you said he's come to destroy but you come that they may have life and have it more abundantly lord and we pray for little emma jane this morning lord we pray lord that your holy life would be instilled within her from a very early age lord lord that she would stay on the path of righteousness that she would be guided on that straight in narrow that leads to eternal life lord we know that eternal life is a gift but lord it has to be chosen father we just pray that you bless little emma jane spiritually laura that father when she would reach that age of accountability that she would accept you she would choose the right path as this world is growing evil and darker and more horrifying in a much more rapid pace than we've ever seen it before lord i pray knowing that there'll be times that the enemy would like to come in and cause trouble and bring his sickness lord we're asking that you would hear the prayers of these parents standing here lord you are a prayer answering god and thou art no respecter of persons and i pray lord as they take a stand for you that you would stand for their prayers lord whatever they would bring before you that you would hear and answer their prayers and father is lord we're dedicating little emma this morning to you and committing her into your hands and lord we're also praying that you'd bless these parents lord that they would be exactly in the place that you would have them to be father that you would bless their relationship first with you and that you would bless their relationship with one another in god that you would help them through the trying times that they're in oh god you're a mighty god that's able to do extremely above what we're asking lord and you know the very very yearning in all of our hearts lord to see you blossom in their lives father now pray for this grace lord jesus we love you we commit this family to you as a unit lord lord finish the work that you've begun lord will be careful to give you the praise for all these things lord for we ask it humbly now in jesus christ precious name amen amen amen praise the lord hallelujah amen praise the lord jesus amen it is an honor to to be alive it's an honor to be with one another it's so precious to be with those of light precious faith and to think that we're the family of god and one day we're going to be eternally together in heaven and there will be no partying from one another i think we're just blessed we're a blessed people this morning that we could come to church and worship the lord and spirit and truth out of all the churches in the world god has sent a message to the bride even to be in a church where the truth is being preached we're blessed we have a chance to worship the lord in spirit and in truth and even though the songs are over the the choruses are over we want to continue to worship the lord amen in spirit and truthful god bless you let's stand together for the reading of god's word i want to say thank you for all your prayers that you have been praying for for my son jonathan from our family and for for ali i mean this young couple um needs god's help grace and leadership and uh when we take a stand for god even though we don't understand everything but when we take a stand for god god will take a stand for us we appreciate our brother tyler sister brooke taking that stand baptism and when we had our bible study this week at the house i kept calling blair emerson kept calling him by his middle name and i think i'm going to know his middle name more than his first name but what a confidence that we can have when we put make take a stand for god god is going to just take care of us it's nothing we have to figure out either he just does it amen so may we all continue our walk with the lord today amen amen we want to preach on the holy ghost relationship this this morning amen let's look to the lord in prayer and then we'll read one verse of scripture our heavenly father we thank you this morning that you've called us together from the north and the south and the east and the west of this little location we gathered together lord called church a place lord that we've dedicated to you years ago that it might be built for the relationship of man to you lord and father we invite that your spirit would come to the ministry of the word lord as it's been prayed as our brother ahmadi had prayed lord that we would be able to step out of the way that you would be able to speak directly to our hearts lord may it be so may there be such a faith in the camp today lord that we would just believe the word of god and and lord there would be no consideration that being a word from a man but lord it would be you and i asked that lord that you would confirm that word by dealing with our hearts and convicting our hearts and and drawing us closer to you father pray that you would give us revelation of this word lord draw us all closer as we commit now to you in jesus name amen amen first corinthians chapter 12 just one verse verse number three wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaketh by the spirit of god call it jesus accursed and that no man can say that jesus is lord but by the holy ghost and god bless you may be seated before i start i just have a question and um i'm going to ask you not to raise your hand at all if you don't really fully be feel what i'm going to ask you because i'm going to ask for a showing of hands but i don't want you to feel obligated i know we're actually missing a number of people here today but i still wanted to do this because this is even though we believe a lot missions here the the heart of of the ministry uh is about building our relationship with god and in the past two months i just have this question the best two months how many feel that your personal relationship with god has been helped because of this ministry here because of coming amen i mean it's so so important because we haven't had much of a five-fold ministry here and we may not for just a little bit even though we believe in it i'm in the reason completely the reason is i'm just trying to use wisdom in the safety of our church but i've kind of this has come to me a number of times these services that we've been having you know god told brother brandon to store up in the storehouse i really feel that's what's been happening here but i i didn't know if it was just me or if if you all felt that way that's why i asked that question a holy ghost relationship god intended from the beginning to have us have a holy ghost relationship with him no man has been willing to have a relationship with god from time to time but mostly under his terms under his spirit we see that with nicodemus we see that with the rich young ruler he wanted to have a relationship with god but just under his terms we see that with the 70 disciples that followed him want to be a part of the ministry until he began to to share more of his word and then they left we see this with the multitudes that followed jesus for one reason another for the loaves to be fed but after a while they left and he was left with his 12 disciples and he says are you going to go too i mean everybody else is leaving the church where would we go lord for thou alone has the words of eternal life we can't have a whole a relationship with god or a holy ghost relationship with god apart from a nature change apart from a new birth and that comes as a result of a holy ghost relationship and that's why we want to talk about this today first corinthians chapter 12 verse 13 says by one spirit we're all baptized into one body of christ we can't get away from this relationship we need the spirit of god amen almost everyone here has a holy ghost relationship and and a carnal relationship with god and we often mix them together but jesus is always separating them because the carnal mind is enmity with god and they that are in the flesh cannot please god first corinthians chapter 2 verse 14 says that the natural man receiveth not the things of the spirit of god for they are foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned so as long as we're in the flesh we'll never ever ever ever know god ever there hasn't been one man that's ever been in the flesh and has ever known god amen you can't figure out god amen we have the tendency of just blending these two relationships together but god's word separates the two so when brother brandon makes this statement that we've come to church to find out where we're at with god i believe what he's in one way that we could say that we're trying to find out where we're at in our relationship with him amen god separates the carnal from the spiritual relationship we have a spiritual relationship while we're living in the flesh by simply walking in the spirit let's see that's the only way because we're in the flesh we're we're fleshly beings we're natural i i should say we we go about doing our jobs but that doesn't mean our relationship with god is carnal and natural we have to get into the spirit we have to walk in the spirit pray in the spirit worship in the spirit so we don't fulfill the lust of the flesh if we don't do that we can have the tendency of of viewing god in a carnal way we cannot exercise a holy ghost spiritual relationship while walking in a carnal mind amen now we've all been taught that justification which is repentance and baptism i praise god for those who've gotten baptized it is a work of the holy ghost it is god working through the holy spirit in the heart of man that brings him to a place just as if he never done it but if i could say it like this we've also been taught that we can be filled with the holy spirit sealed with the holy spirit and still grieve god so what does that tell us tells us that whatever state we're in our level with the lord whatever we're at in our relationship with god we still have a need for more of the holy spirit in our relationship we still have a need for more of a holy ghost relationship too often people hide behind the thoughts that they have the holy spirit so why do they need to seek after more holy spirit hide behind the thoughts that god has promised that he would never leave and never forsake them so why do they need to seek for more holy spirit that jesus holds them in the palm of their hand and no man can pluck them out so why do i need to seek more of the holy ghost that nothing can separate them from the love of god so why do i need to seek more of the holy ghost because everyone has a holy ghost relationship and a carnal relationship with jesus and when believers find themselves thinking this way they don't realize it at the time but they're exercising their carnal relationship with god don't tell me you don't know what kind of relationship i have with god they're finding an excuse to remain in the state that they're in to be really exercising a holy ghost relationship for every one of us we need to be pressing towards getting more of the holy ghost pressing towards the mark manifesting more of the world not word manifesting more of the word not being satisfied with how much we are manifesting or that we're just saved amen we need to be exercising being steadfast unmovable and always abounding in the work of the lord now this to me is a holy ghost relationship and this is exercising a holy ghost relationship it's not about getting deeper into the knowledge of god it's about getting deeper into the love of god deeper into a holy ghost relationship where you lay down your life for one reason for souls let god use you i'm telling you you place yourself in god's hand and he's not going to make you a wallflower he's not going to make you a vase he's not going to make you a picture he's going to make you a living life that goes out there and fulfills his purpose you know the thing is that without that vision many people perish and we can make our relationship so carnal that the only thing that we really think about is ourselves but we can get trouble with that can't we bring marty brother braham says that's why mission work was always in the will of god he would always stand behind every single person who was trying to break get a soul no i can't say that about anything else in my life nothing even if i go to work because i could be going to work with the wrong attitude the wrong motives but mission work is always the right motive for every one of us we do understand that according to what jesus said when we stand before him to give an account of our relationship that there will be no substitute for complete obedience to the word of god matthew chapter 7 verse 21 so good to hear brother marty i mean when he was at home you couldn't hear any of the amens and i i i really like demons not for me but to know that there's hearts get into the world we really appreciate brother bruce he's like the example of amens amen matthew chapter 7 verse 21 not everyone that saith unto me lord lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven men who will say to me in that day lord lord have we not prophesied thy name in thy name cast out devils and in thy name did many wonderful works what are they doing here what are they doing by asking this question they're wanting to substitute the using of the name of jesus christ for obedience they're wanting to substitute their terms of the relationship with god they're wanting to substitute their carnal relationship for god's required holy ghost relationship he's not saying no you didn't do those things but those things didn't mean anything because it wasn't a holy ghost relationship you know we get stuck on things many people wanted to see the miracles that jesus did many people want to see the miracles of the prophet people like hearing testimonies of things that god's doing right but who is interested in a relationship that's filled with the holy ghost with god because it brings a man under subjection to the will of god and it's not appealing to the flesh verse 23 but then i will profess unto them i never knew you and resolved is depart from me in this relationship just get away in other words the relationship that people think they have with god today a lot of people it's not correct because they're they're going to church testifying do you know what i did i prayed over this person and just this happened i'm doing all these wonderful works i got this gift that i'm using and the emphasis is on that and not upon the relationship i wonder how many people are using the name of jesus christ this morning and don't even realize though it works has nothing to do with their relationship with god all over the world i question is the relationship that i am presently having with god on my terms or his people don't mind using the name of jesus as long as they can still do what they want to do we understand that jesus wants to be the lord of each and every one of our lives every day and in every way he wants his way not just today john chapter 13 verse 12. so after he washed his disciples feet this is the last supper taken his garments and sat them down he said unto them know ye what i have done to you most the things that god does to us we don't really always know what he does until he shows us and reveals it to us he says you call me master and lord and ye say well in other words you're saying the right thing because i really am right but if i then your lord and master have washed your feet you should do this you should do what i tell you to do because i'm telling you to watch one another's it's too many people want this relationship well i got a relationship with god he's my lord don't want to wash anybody's feet that's not by the holy ghost that's not calling jesus lord by the holy ghost that's your ghost for i have given you an example that you should do as i have done to you amen thank god for the example that he gave us all we can have confidence in the word of god amen one day every single person will bow and confess that jesus is lord of lords and king of kings amen philippians 10 that at the name of jesus every knee should bow of things in heaven and things in earth and things under the earth and that every tongue should confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of god the father amen now the word confess means fully agree fully acknowledge today people are walking around and they may believe that there is a god some may say jesus he is god but their life is not saying he is god because they're not fully confessing to the word of god to to following the word so it no matter how much they say lord lord they may be saying the right thing but we can only call jesus lord by the holy ghost the only way that he'll accept it he don't want to be accepted with less amen brother god wants to be lord of all of our lives and this is we're all in this boat somewhere this is not like well there's three people in the church you know that are there and the rest of us the message must be for today i'm sorry it's not like that oh you just be honest with yourself just look what happened yesterday just roll back the camera of yesterday think of the thoughts you thought the words you said the actions you did and tell me which one of those were was that all holy ghost think of the many confessing believers of all faiths that are gathering this morning to confess that jesus christ is lord many of them singing he is lord many of them are praying in the name of the lord many will say to me profess to them i never knew you people are missing the boat they're they're missing the required holy ghost relationship this should be the thing that we're focused on that's what our testimony should be that's what we should be striving for is our relationship with god and it has to be a holy ghost relationship it cannot be a carnal relationship it is the only way that god will accept a relationship god is a spirit they that worship him must worship him in the spirit so if we're going to have a relationship with god it has to be in the spirit can't be carnal can't be what we think about god it can't be well i know this is uh what god is because this is what the bible says this is what the preacher says this is what brother brandon said it can't be a knowledge relationship we don't know god through knowledge we know god through faith through revelation upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god call it jesus accursed so you got the holy ghost you're not going to accuse somebody can't stand in the presence of god and accuse another person it's not the nature of god it's your nature it's a nature we're born with the first time not the second time and that no man can say jesus is lord but by the holy ghost paul had a very carnal understanding of who jesus was before he was converted he thought he knew the lord god almighty but he had to give up all his carnal thinking that day he was riding on his road to damascus amen acts chapter 9 verse 4 and he fell to the earth and heard a voice saying unto him saul saul why persecuted thou me and he said who art thou lord now here's a man that was taught under the greatest men of that day he was more zealous than them all he stuck out above everybody and now he's saying who art thou art just because we feel we know who the lord is you're not the first we're not the first and the lord said i'm jesus whom they'll persecute us it's hard for thee to kick a kick against the pricks i i would think that there's things in her life that we try to get by with and then the lord comes what are you doing what are you doing who art thou lord what do you mean i can't do this philippians chapter 3 verse 10 still speaking on paul here paul wanted to know jesus wanted to know the lord he said oh that i might know him and the power of his resurrection the fellowship of his sufferings being made conformable unto his death if by any means i might attain to the resurrection of the dead paul did not want to know god or to know jesus in the flesh out of curiosity it wasn't that paul didn't know jesus because he had this amazing experience on the road to damascus i mean how many people could say what happened to them is is what happened to paul you know what i'm saying he had this experience where he was literally knocked off his horse he was blinded by the light of god he couldn't see somebody had to lead him away and this was an experience that he had with god he got to a place that his eyes became healed and he could see somebody prayed over him the body did and he received his sight and the bible says that he was he was filled with the holy ghost so he he knew god galatians chapter 1 verse 11 but i certify you brother and that the gospel which i preached of me is not after man for i neither received a man neither was i taught it but by the revelation of jesus christ so paul was all done sitting under the feet of gamalia he was all done he wasn't going to go to the disciples and sit under their feet and say teach me the gospel no he went got serious with god in his home amen his home was in little ways away in arabia he spent some time there seeking god and he got to know jesus by revelation without another human being around today you can be in church hearing these words and receiving revelation from god and i hope you're in the spirit to do that today because he wants to give it to you first corinthians chapter 2 verse 2 for i am determined to know to not know anything among you save jesus christ and him crucified it kind of sounds like to me that paul knew everything about jesus that's all he knew all the revelation he got was from jesus got filled with the holy ghost his own testimonies i don't know nothing among you except jesus christ and yet here he's all that i might know him what was going on here's a man that knew jesus but something inside of him says all that i might know him know him in the power of the resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering why did he want to know him what was going on the holy ghost inside of him was hungering to manifest more of christ to be able to love his enemies to truly intercede in prayer and compassion and love for those that despitefully used him the holy ghost inside was hungering to know god in that measure to know him in the fellowship of his sufferings to know him in the power of the resurrection to be able to manifest the power of god in his life amen we don't believe in a dead religion we don't believe in just carnal words and just some ten commandments on the wall we follow brother branham we believe in the power of god that changes a man's nature it's got to change his nature that is the holy ghost that i want to see in our lives one where we cannot be satisfied with salvation one where we can't be satisfied that i'm in a church that preaches the truth but i'll not be satisfied to awaken his likeness that's the holy ghost that we need that's the holy ghost relationship that we're looking for that i might know him in the power of his resurrection the fellowship of his sufferings romans chapter 8 verse 11 but if that same spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwells in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken in your mortal body by the spirit that dwelleth in you a quickening a holy ghost relationship quickens us look at the very next verse therefore brethren we are debtors not to our flesh to live after our flesh for if we live after our flesh we're going to die but if we through the spirit uh the john martin version of mortified the deeds of the body we shall live amen raw there and as long as we got breath in our lungs we need to mortify the deeds of our flesh i'll tell you today this flesh wants to rise up just as much as it did at the beginning [Music] we can never escape it right can i ever take the oars out of the water can never say i'm there i've attained we got to keep pressing on a holy ghost relationship god does not want a carnal relationship with his bride god's intentions from the beginning was to have a holy ghost relationship with man we understand that when god created man originally he created man in his own image not naturally but spiritually he had the very nature that god had inside of him god created man to love god back with the same love that he loved him with it was part of the nature god wanted to feel loved the same way that he loved them this love was shed abroad in their heart by the holy ghost in other words to love god the same way that he loves us it requires a holy ghost relationship it takes the spirit of god in us we cannot love god in our own feelings our emotions and our natural well he's just been so good to me how many people do you know they've said that you know god is good god and they name off all these things that god did for them but they ain't got enough holy ghost in their life to lay down their life for anybody so it is not a carnal natural love we could love god every day brother brandon said we could still miss it so we need to love god with his love that love and man was to be proven by the keeping of god's word the keeping of his commandments if you love me keep my commandments and do not partake of the tree of knowledge of good and evil for in the day that you partake of it you shall surely be separated from me from the holy ghost relationship that we're having in fact he said you'll surely die as long as adam and eve obeyed god's will they were a perfect there was a perfect holy ghost relationship they were in perfect harmony with god god brother and said god would come down in the cool the evening and he would just share his presence with them and fellowship with them and it was just a beautiful thing but when man injected his will now this is important when he injected his will instead of god's will into the relationship god separated them from his presence they were no longer having a holy ghost relationship yes amen generation generations genesis same three letters but a totally different word the beginning the sea chapter verse number 22 genesis chapter 3 verse 22 and the lord god said behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil now lest he put forth his hand and take also the tree of life and eat and live forever therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground where he was taken so he drove out man and placed him at the east of the garden of of eden cherubins and a flaming sword which turned everyway to keep the way of the tree of life so their holy ghost relationship got severed yes and even though they wanted to come back they couldn't [Music] god from the beginning is intended that a relationship would only be a holy ghost relationship it was not god's will for man to partake of the tree of knowledge of good and evil but when man made his choice to investigate it because he really didn't know she didn't know a lot about it just enough to what was enticing but didn't know everything that's why she could say he enticed me every one of us that fall in sin so often we're enticed by the devil we don't realize until it's late we were tricked are you with me can you say amen to that it's the truth and man is still making that choice today to investigate the tree of knowledge of good and evil it's amazing to me how much satan wants us to partake of it amen it's okay if you go to church okay if you read your bible it's okay you want to believe the message okay you want to pay your tithes as long as you partake of the tree of knowledge brother branham said man's first had to reject the truth before he could partake of a lie in other words he first disbelieved god's word before he partook of what satan had available to him that's on that basis is why brother branham could say the only sin is unbelief and everything else is just an attribute of not believing the word of god amen amen now there were two trees in the garden life and death right we're not ready for this yet but you can stay there hold on to it i had andy before service put something up for us to kind of give us a little visual i'd like to give you the definition of the tree of knowledge of good and evil this tree was the birth of self-will it's the birth of self-will its propaganda was self-will its fruit bore seeds of self-will that were planted in the heart of man to do self-will and self-will always takes us away from god's will now this is what's really important because we want to do our will and have still have a relationship with god but you cannot amen amen and that's what satan was trying to give eve oh god does know you're going to be just like him you're going to be buddies this is still okay having the knowledge of god's good will and choosing to do your own will which is evil that's what the tree is having the knowledge of what's right and making a choice to do what you want to do that tree is just as live today as it was in the garden it's not one of those spooky things that oh oh my that evil devil oh that tree of knowledge it comes no it's so enticing it's so beautiful you can have your will you can do what you want to do the choices here the two trees life and death cool keep them going just let them fly revelation knowledge love love less i didn't want to put hate god's will or your will your will is to love god less your will is to be satisfied with the knowledge we don't need revelation but your will will always bring forth death amen god's will god is love to love him first to love the lord thy god with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy might to have so much you just love your neighbor the same way you lay down your life for your enemy that's his way a love relationship a holy ghost love relationship god's will can only be received by revelation truly because he hid it from the wise and the prudent and he reveals himself to those he calls them babes i'll just say it like those the simplicity of somebody who wants a relationship a a child who hasn't reached that age of don't know the proper word to say in church but one where uh he hasn't reached that age where he thinks he knows more than his parents and he kind of depends on his parents doesn't want his parents to leave wants to hold their hand wants us to just stay with me i need you a dependency but a person who's like well i can do it my way i'm gonna have my own relationship with god it's between me and god will you leave that babe that that receiving god's word the sincere milk of the word because you already got it figured out and i'll tell you what that the attitude you stop revelation with that spirit you stop revelation because he resists the proud and he gives grace to the humble and to me revelation is grace you can't force it to happen you can sit in church forever and still never receive it but you just come once with a humble heart and god will reveal to you more in five minutes and you can learn in a lifetime amen god's will is the only way to eternal life the tree of knowledge of good and evil has always bore the fruit of self-will in the heart of man for it is and always has been the mark of the beast so we're in genesis let's go to revelation chapter 13. you know this is the end time that we're living in and people are like you know starting to think more about the end time of course these some there's some people that are so lost in the world out there hatred and things are they're just messing things up terrible they're not even thinking about anything outside of this world revelation chapter 13 verse 14 now the devil he deceiveth them that dwell on the earth by the means of those miracles which were which he had power to do in the sight of the beast saying to them that dwell upon the earth that they should make an image to the beast which had the wound by the sword and did live he had power to give life unto the image of the beast that the image of the beast should both speak and cause as many as would not worship the image of the beast should be killed and he calls us all both small and great rich and poor bond and free to receive a mark in their hand or in their forehead and that no man might bow to buy or sell save he that had the mark or the name of the beast or the name of his number or the number of his name excuse me here is wisdom homie wants wisdom let him that have understanding count the number of the beast for it is the number of a man beast man same thing same number and his number is six hundred three score and six now think about this when god created man in his image he created him in his image he was above all the beast he was above every one of them but because of what happened in the garden causing every man to be born with the nature of self-will that's right he now became the same number as the beast yes peter calls him brute beast amen second peter chapter 2 verse 10. second peter chapter 2 verse 10 but chiefly them that walk after the flesh in the lust of uncleanness and despise government presumptuous are they self-willed they are not afraid to speak evil of dignities yes whereas the angels which are greater in power might bring aurelian accuration against them before the lord but these as natural brute beasts made to take and destroy speak evil of things which they do not understand which understand not shall utterly perish in their own corruption when man fell he became a brute beast by nature amen which is simply a physical irrational and unreasonable animal he's got his own will he's just going to do what he wants to do so god looks at him as a brute beast so reason we have to be born again yes amen the reason we have to have a nature change romans 8 verse 7 because the carnal mind is enmity against god for it is not subject to the law of god neither indeed can be so then they are in the flesh cannot please god [Music] we must be born again and get back to the holy ghost relationship how many people in that beast nature are trying to have a relationship with god it's crazy see inside a man they all want there's something that wants to know god but they're not willing to give up their their self-will right amen and satan says you don't have to give it up you can still know god you can still make it to heaven that is hogwash i'm here to tell you that will never work if jesus said you must be born again you must have a new nature change there's no and if about it we need the new birth amen first peter chapter 1 verse 22 amen seeing you purified your souls and obeying the truth praise god i'll say today this is what brother tyler and sister brooke have done and brother ben they're purifying their souls and obeying the truth they're obeying the truth they've repented they've gotten baptized i have to say that this is oh purifying your souls and i'll say every one of you that hears the word of god and you take correction to the word of god you are purifying your souls today it's not just in baptism but every time we come to church i'm telling you god's got an eye on you his word is a discerner the thoughts intents of our heart and he's constantly separating the carnal relationship that we're having with him to the spiritual relationship being borned again being born again not of corruptible seed amen we were born originally by a corruptable seed yes that's why we have to be born by an incorruptible seed which is what the word of god which liveth and abideth forever i say friends today when you hear the word of god you say amen from your heart the born-again experience is happening and you don't even know it it's not a feeling it's not an emotion it's not something where you're just whoa everybody sees it it's dropped by drought sometimes it's word by word here a little there a little but you begin to manifest more and more of the word because you've been born by the word it's not a one-shot deal it wasn't over when i got baptized still going on when i get up early to read the word it's going on but you know what else is going on satan want me to exercise a carnal relationship with god a non-holy ghost relationship that's claiming god without the holy ghost obedience and that's the battle amen lord help us amen being born again another credible seed but incorrupted by the word of god we're serving by forever for all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man is the flower grass the grass withereth and the flower thereof fadeth and there are falls away but the word of the lord endure forever and this is the word which by the gospel is preached unto you we don't have to wonder where the truth is at we don't have to go outside this door and go look for something just have ears to hear what the spirit is saying to the church god's interested in our souls and god's interest in his relationship with you how many times did you want to give something to your son or your daughter but you wouldn't give it to them until they were first willing to obey this simple little thing you wanted to do first their only interest is what they wanted but you had a greater interest in giving them what you wanted you want to know if they could be faithful sometimes you're here to learn how to be faithful to him maybe not what you're wanting to come to church for maybe not what you're interested but this is what your heavenly father is looking first amen second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14. as we're closing we're in the closing we didn't close yet jesus said he's coming soon 2000 years ago jesus suffered and died for you amen that you could have a holy ghost relationship that the holy ghost could come back on you he paid that price now it's up to us to press into that i believe the book the hebrews tells us that there remains a rest for the people of god there is a a living word of god called the holy ghost that can live inside of us and we can be at peace of everything else that's just going on chaotic in the world second corinthians chapter 5 verse 14 for the love of christ constrains us because we thus judge that if one died for all then we're all dead jesus died suffered for us and that he died for all that they which live should not henceforth live unto themselves but unto him which died for them and rose again right amen here's the turning point now when we live for ourselves we're exercising our carnal relationship with god when we recognize i'm in debt to him i don't own my life anymore you're exercising your holy ghost relationship with him wherefore henceforth know we no man after the flesh yeah though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth know we him no more paul could say this therefore if any man be in christ he is a new creature he has gone back to the image of god amen old things are passed away behold all things have become new and all things are of god who reconciled us to himself by jesus christ god has reconciled us back to him wherefore i give you to understand that no man speaking by the spirit of god called jesus accursed and no man say that jesus is lord but by the holy ghost if you want god to recognize the fullness of the meaning when you call him lord walk in the light of the word that he's given your heart because it's not him that say lord lord but it's him that doeth the will amen let's stand together
